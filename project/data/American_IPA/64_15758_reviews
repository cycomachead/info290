"Delicious. Sweet on the nose but very balanced in taste. Everything blends together quite well with this one. Highly recommended. Very pleasant experience overall."
""
"I rather enjoyed the velvety mouthfeel of this one. Other beers should model after this ones feel. Taste is lacking a bit for me tho- not really detecting much citrus which is what I prefer. Bit of a quandary this one."
""
""
"O: The beer is very well-balanced with an interesting interaction between the maple and the bitter."

"This was a disappointment. After a great-looking pour, I just didn't get the aromas I was seeking nor any of the flavor. There was no trace of maple syrup in this, and no malty goodness like you get from 90 Minute either. The finish was somewhat tart, too, which was unexpected. Unsure if this was an outlier given previous reviews, but it was not enjoyable and, I hate to say, went unfinished."

"Had the version bottle conditioned with maple syrup. Strong, very hoppy aroma definitely has a hint of maple as well as a citrus fruity touch. Pours a nice clear amber with a fairly thick pale wheat head. Hoppy, lively flavor is more fruity than bitter and has a subtle maple syrup note but is not too sweet. Smooth texture has good body and fizz. Love the label on this version! Another winner from Dogfish Head."

"Pours an amber color with a thick foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are excellent.  Has a malty, syrupy aroma.  Smells like caramel apples.  Smells boozy.  Good malt to hop transition but more on the malty side for my tastes.  Can definitely taste the maple syrup bitterness at the end.  Good beer.  I just like a more hoppy, citrus IPAs."

"If you like barleywine and/or super-sweet saisons, this is a good one to try. Similar heaviness as a big belgian."
"750ml bottle served in a shaker pint.  Pours an orange-gold hue with a dense, three inch, off-white head.  Head eventually settles into a lumpy, half inch froth, leaving thick textured clusters and clumps of lacing as the beer recedes.  Nose is malty sweet with some notes of citrus zest and a hint of something floral/herbal in the back.  Taste follows nose - malty sweetness attributable to the maple syrup coalesces nicely with the hops profile.  Citrus notes are bright and juicy on a toasted malt backbone.  It almost comes off as an American Barleywine with a slightly lighter body.  Mouthfeel is light-medium with a balanced, even carbonation.  Texture is slightly oily.  Overall, a very interesting beer - nice complexity and I'd be curious to see what a little time in the cellar does."

"Not great. Quite bland and lacking any real character."

"Normally I prefer malts to hops. This was a great beer."

"Poured 750 ml bottle into willy glasses and shared.  A slightly hazy straw yellow with a smallish white head that dissipates and leaves lots of lacing.  Aroma is of yeast, bread, crackers, some citrus and herbs/flowers.   Taste is somewhat malty - crackers and biscuit, combined with a little bit of citrus and very little bitterness.  Mouth feel is dry, refreshing, nicely carbed, with just enough body to give it substance.  Overall, a pleasing beer that really does convey the feel of being a blend of 90 minute and 60 minute.  On the pricey side, but a very nice IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Great beer, I expected a bit more flavor but still great."
"Pours a light yellowish-gold, semi-clear with a big cake-like head and tremendous lacing. Aroma is very hoppy, with pine, citrus rind a touch of sweetness. Taste is definitely hoppy with lots of grapefruit and grapefruit rind. The maple is very subtle but adds just the right amount of sweetness to balance the hops quite well. This beer does an amazing job balancing itself, has a perfect amount of carbonation and the bitterness is just right. All around, Dogfish hit this one out of the park, wow !!!"

"An excellent IPA with a piney nose and just a hint of maple on the tongue and a lovely, velvety mouth feel."
""
"I prefer the homemade version (just mix a 60 and a 90, no syrup) to the bottled version, but overall 75 Minute is my favorite of the DFH IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't taste any notes of maple in this. Truth be told, I didn't find it to be anything special, just drinks like a 60 minute."
"Nice beer with a solid malt backbone and an interesting tart/champagne element resulting from the bottle conditioning."
"Had this poured into a nonic pint glass. The color is interesting, more hazy than I would have expected. Sort of a dark golden-yellow. Lots of head and lacing. The taste was interesting, it's awfully citrusy, but you definitely get the maple finish. This sounds kind of gross, but actually works pretty well. The mouthfeel is fairly soft. Really liked it."
""
""
"The hops are definitely present but play second fiddle to the caramel malt IMO. The hop and malt combo combine for a sweet orange marmalade flavor. The resinous hop profile really helps in the MF department.  This is a brew I have always looked forward to trying. It's interesting and one I'll come back to here and there. I would definitely like to try this one fresh at the source."
"This may be my all time favorite! We used to go to the Brew Pup on Thursday nights JUST to have this on cask, since that was the only way you could have it. DFH started bottling it just a few years ago."
""
""
"Rich foamy head and a pale orange color. Pleasantly hoppy nose. Taste is a biting, wonderfully bitter flavor nicely mellowed with a sweet, maple-enhanced maltiness and a very pleasant finish that seems almost like stone fruit in flavor. Expertly balanced taste profile. Mouth feel is sharp, almost biting. Overall another exceptional IPA remarkable for being incredibly well balanced and richly flavored."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Heavy! Hops abound here, but again, there’s something else going on here. The maple syrup adds a different element — a little spicy, a little sweet. Finishes a tad dry but definitely smooth. Absolutely solid and enjoyable. A nice twist on the usual IPA."
""
"Drinkability – This is a decent IPA, though I definitely prefer their 90 Minute."
"O:  I'll say this, 75min is an exercise in compromise, and while it is a solid IPA, I'm not sure it is necessarily better than it's component parts.  90min is one of my higher rated IPAs (admittedly, a style category that I'm not the most fond of) and one common knock against it that I often hear is that it is too sweet (I personally don't mind the sweetness).  On the other hand, 60min is a solid IPA, but without the same intensity or complexity of the 90min.  75min splits the middle - hop forward, not to sweet, but with enough balance between the two.  Unfortunately, the addition of maple syrup seems to fall flat - it didn't have the kind of impact on the palate that I was expecting, and there wasn't any real noticeable maple flavor at all.  The bottle conditioning, however, was a nice twist, and the mouthfeel was one of the better aspects of this beer.  Worth a try, sure, DFH's quality at least earns my money for one bottle, but I'm not sure I would reach for this again over the 90min."

"Great beer ... So under smooth yet hoppy"
""

"Beautiful pour into a snifter.  White, frothy, thick head that takes a long time to dissipate.  Patches of foam cling to the sides of the glass.  Slightly cloudy, golden hue, slight reddish tinge.  Big burst of maple, roasted malt, caramel and citrus and grass hops in the nose.   A bit of apple and dragon fruit.  A sweet beer in general, with some bitterness in the center of palate.  Well-carbonated, smooth, fairly full-bodied for an IPA, with a long fairly bitter finish.  You gotta love DH...they really make it work."

"O – As a lover of 90 Minute IPA but only a casual fan of 60 Minute, not surprising that this comes in somewhere in the middle for me.  The syrup / bottle-conditioning gives this a Belgian pale or IPA feel, and it’s going well with my Thanksgiving dinner, but it’s not quite an excellent beer."

"Real chunky body, has a syrupy feel to it. I suppose I like dry, crisp, thin IPA's. So be warned that my opinion in this one could skew bias. It has more malt than I personally prefer. Others may like that it's balanced out. Over all, the maple is rather subdued and not featured as much a I expected. At least not for me. Overall, has all the other redundant IPA characteristics. 'Bitter, citrus, earthiness.... Etc' None jump out. Was ok, but left me with a flat impression~"

"O: I am a little disappointed in this one, solely because I was hoping for more hops and more maple syrup. The syrup did start to come through more as the glass warmed up, but only slightly. I will absolutely keep my eyes open for a fresher bottle, I really like the take on the style, just wish the characteristics were more pronounced."

"Appearance is a darker shade of amber with a vintage white, inch high fluff of a head. Aroma is sweet, a bit reminiscent of brown sugar, along with the obvious citrus hops coming through. The flavor itself is intensely bitter and coarse, much more so than expected, and carries that 'resinous' characteristic. The maple syrup aspect is perceived to my tastebuds more like a molasses flavoring, and the finish comes with some heat. Recommended for major hop heads only!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber. Lots of head. Both beers poured from the bottle foamed over. Nice hazy orange color. Very citrusy smell. Small amount of malt in the aroma, but no sweetness. Just finished a 90 minute before trying this, and 75 minute is definitely smoother. Lots of citrus flavor. Maybe some smoothness from the maple, but not much maple taste. Overall, this is better then 90 minute."

"This pours a hazy, dirty yellow color with a thick, foamy beige head. The aroma is full of malts and hints of hops. The taste is big, complex and full of flavors. The maple really smooths out the flavor of the IPA giving it a much weaker hoppy flavor than I expected. Very interesting and a must try as with any Dogfish head beer."

"o. Outstanding beer - the only issue I have with it is the alcohol hit for a 7.5 APV beer. DFH 60 still rains supreme for me - but this is not far behind."

"A very interesting beer — I wasn't expecting the lemony features. A good beer that maybe would be better described as a Belgian IPA."
"I will agree with the stated description that it does have a very smooth and ""velvety"" mouthfeel. I just have to rely on others that say this is due to the bottle conditioning (because I'm not smart enough to know that). I don't necessarily agree with the comps on the side as this is just not all that hoppy. You can feel the 7.5%, but it doesn't overwhelm. I did pour it gently into an IPA glass and the head was enormous. I thought I messed up the first pour, but the second was just the same. Not sure if it was the glass or the beer causing this. However, after calming down, it was a pure treat to drink. I shared this one with the wife and the other will be shared with my drinking buddies. Well done, DFH!"

"Overall: I got home and realized this bottle was 8 months old. However, unlike west coast hop bombs with the same age, this held up very well in my opinion. I may be getting more malt than when fresh, but since it's apparently malty in the first place, age isn't a huge setback. I still think that if youre going to pay $10 or more for a bomber or 750 ml, the beer should be relatively fresh, or discounted otherwise. I would love to try a fresh batch and will definitely check the dates from now on before purchasing. Still a well made beer and recommended!"
"O-Enjoy this beer much more than 60 or 90 minute now. BUT blending both 60 and 90 worked out very well and the maple syrup used to carbonate the beer naturally adds a distinct flavor that helps to balance out the beer and create a entirely new beer in and of its self."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - nothing like the 60 or 90 minute. This is so much more complex. I really love the beer but I'm sure I'll probably by the 60 and 90 several times before coming back to this only because of the price. Great beer though!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Goes down so easy. I understand this is essentially a blend of 60 and 90 Minute - This is my first Dogfish brew, so I can't make any direct comparisons to those. It's definitely well rounded and is worthy of a try. The only downside I can think of is that the 750ml format is not the most ideal vessel when it comes to $$."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I supppose I can taste the 60 and 90 minute flavors in this beer. There's the brightness from the 60 minute hops, but then the malt profile i associate with 90 minute. The syrup doesn't add a ton in the way of flavor, but it adds a little, and it makes for a great, unique sort of mouthfeel. I'd like to try this beer a bit fresher (my bottle is over four months old), but it's still tasting pretty good regardless. I'm not too sure it's worth $14 a bottle, but it's still a beer worth experiencing. I'd try it again if I saw it on tap or in a fresher bottle."

"Pours a cloudy caramel color with a modest off white head and thick lacing. The nose is citrusy, floral and slightly sweet. The mouth feel is medium bodied and velvety with nice carbonation. The taste is slightly bready, but the citrus hops shine through. The sweetness from the maple syrup is perfectly balanced. Overall, this beer drinks incredibly well for being such a complex IPA."

"P.S. The price tag at 10.99 for my pint at the Beer Junction in Seattle was also perfect! Keep it there!"
"Pours a hazy, golden/copper color. 5/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, floral hops, sweet malt, hint of pale malt, alcohol, and yeast. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, floral hops, sweet malt, hint of pale malt, yeast, alcohol, and hint of caramel malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend. Not too bitter, malt and hops are well balanced, and decent complexity."
""
"This one gets an A from me. Love the innovation with the addition of maple syrup. Really makes this beer stand out from the thousands of other IPAs out there today."

"Ill start by saying that I've had the bomber of this sitting in my fridge for 2 days and very excited to drink it. Unfortunately I'm a little let down. The appearence looked pleasing. A golden orange color with a nice cloud to it. Many bubbles flowing to the top of the glass. It has a thick milky head that grew larger even 20 seconds after I stopped pouring. Not too much of a smell for what I had expected. I think the 60 min might smell more hoppy. No trace of the maple. Mouth feel and taste are average. No tongue numbness. And little carbonation feel. I feel as if I can taste more malt then hops. And no hints of maple anywhere. Not a bad beer in anyway, shape, or form. It not a great one either. Stick with 60min or 90min. Both great choices."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good variation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a long time if you want a slightly different IPA."
"Yet another twist on the ipa from dfh. This one pours a beautiful golden amber color with a thick foamy long lasting white head. The nose is typical dogfish ipa hops and malt with the pleasant presence of late autumn maple syrup. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy especially given the style. Almost wish it was a little fuller bodied so I could savor the taste longer. The flavor is everything the nose predicted, a perfect blend of hops, malt, and the earthy sweetness of maple syrup. I wish this was available more often; I'd drink it every day."

"I got this as a gift and found that it had been chilled to waaay colder than it should have been served. It was still a great beer. The appearance is a dark gold in color with a smell of maple and floral notes through out. The taste was very impressive with good floral and grapefruit in the beginning, with the sweetness from the maple coming in the end to give a nice sweet finish that was actually very clean. As the bottle warmed back up I felt you got more of the maple notes through out. If you are giving this as a gift or drinking it yourself, please, keep it at room temperature till your ready to drink and only slightly chill it. Still a great buy!"

"ton of head on this one. wonderful ipa with lots of character. got a brown sugar/molasses note I guess similar to maple syrup. at the same time lots of spice, bit of citrus, and caramel malt. very nice and not on the west coast/citrusy end of hops or ipa's"

"Very good beer. Pours an amber color with incredibly thick head. Creates a foamy lacing. To me it has a smokey flavor, malts, and with a hint of the normal Dogfish Head citrus arrangement. You can smell the citrus more than you can taste it. The smokey/malt flavor might be a little of the maple coming out."

"pours a beautiful goldish brown orange...big billowy foam head of about 3 fingers that takes forever to settle. smells amazing big grapefruit & tropical citrus notes ..definatly getting some mango and a slight peach hint and a touch of maple syrup. the taste is absoloutly delicious sharp and sweet bitterness up front. with a sweet cut from the maple syrup. finishes with a slightly peachy sweetness after its swallowed. i almost get the alcohol too. the mouthfeel is fantasic with lots of carbonation due to the bottle conditioning. this is definatly my favorite i.p.a from dfh. too bad its so rare in between that it is realeased...salud!"

"Taste seems exactly like a toned-down 90 minute, as well as a mix of 60 and 90, as expected. Taste starts with musty citrus and heavy malts, moving on to hearty bread, a touch of dark fruit, and creeping maple syrup. Finish contains more old and musty citrus, as well as assertive malts, and maple syrup. Mouthfeel is a touch heavier than average, with average carbonation, a ton of chewiness, and some creaminess."

"I really wish they'd put this as a year round in 6 packs! I know that's dreaming but I'd make it my go to IPA everytime. So well balanced but still appeals to the people who want a bitter hop profile as well. Thanks Dogfish!"

"Overall, my favorite IPA in the Dogfish line. Not cloying like the 90 minute. But a lot more going on than the 60. I didn't detect much, if any, of the maple. And that's fine by me."

"Really cool flavor profile for an IPA. I don't normally think about drinking beer with my breakfast but this flavor explosion can pull up a chair at the table. Realistically speaking it is a great mix up for IPA fans and the maple flavor is very prominent on the tongue but other than that runs similar in flavor to the breweries other IPAs with floral american hop heavy flavor."
"O: nice, but unexpected. I had some notions of this being a little sweeter because of the maple syrup, but that didn't come through for me. An interesting cross up between DFHs two very popular IPAs though."

"But last night we stopped by DFH Rehoboth to treat some out of town family, and found they had 75 on cask. Every once in a while the stars align, and it happened for us. 75 Min was born to be served via cask. Started off our night, and It was outstanding. All the special flavors characteristic of the 75 min blend just exploded in a sensual creamy decadent sipper. We drank a lot of DFH afterwards last night and had a great time, but agreed we could have gone the whole night just kickin back sippin off the 75 cask. Well done!"
"O: I would definitely recommend this beer as an IPA for anyone looking for something a bit off-center, something which Dogfish Head does very well."

"75 minute IPA a beautiful experience thus far after my first pour, paired with one of my favorite all time cigars CLE cuarenta which is a beautiful diadema tapered at each end tailored for Christian Eirora's 40th birthday. Overall a great experience between the roasted tobacco notes and black pepper I'm getting from the cigar, along with a perfume like spice note this is complex tobacco. The beer looks super cloudy amber ruby hued with a light khaki tan head forming fine lace in my chalice glass. Aroma has citrus with a complex sugar layer full of hops and maple syrup partially fermented out. Barrel aging can't be ruled out this is a refined IPA less hop machismo than either 60 minute IPA or 90 minute IPA. Flavors collide nicely with oak barrel aging and hops on the horizon, super complex malts and sugars blend it all into a balanced beast of an IPA. Mouthfeel has bitter aspects with alcohol soothing the backend it doesn't finish hot but the alcohol is definitely noticeable wow, what a beer. Overall the perfect beer to pair with a complex cigar don't think you have to have a scotch or bourbon to pair with your cigar when there is ale out there this complex."

"So, so, so good. Tapped the cask right on the 18th Street side of the bar. Dude in a button button-down had a taster, then questioned his outfit, the 75 Minute was so good. Folks dressed in black suits (who apparently had missed their funeral), guffawed out loud as they asked ""what's a cask""?, as they innocently dismissed their lost colleague. 75 Minute. 75 Minute in a cask. 75 Minute in a cask at City Taphouse in Philly. I'll see you tomorrow."
"All in all, this is a very good IPA, nicely balanced IPA. The bottle conditioning with maple syrup is an interesting twist that makes for a great looking beer, but otherwise adds nothing."
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice beer, and a nice idea- adding a bit of maple syrup to the IPA. The syrup adds a bit of sweetness, but just slightly. What it really does is round out the flavors and add a balance to the bitterness as well as a floral/earthy note. It tastes as if they used a lighter grade of syrup, which was wise in this case. It's definitely become quite a different experience than a normal IPA, but one that is crave worthy- for me at least."
""
""
"In reading other reviews, I realized they were reviewing two entirely different beers. The bottled stuff is made with added maple that adds an underlying sugar thats supplements the malt with a notable effect. ""Pub made"" 75 is a draw from 60 and a draw fron 90, and you get what the barkeep, not the brewer, measures by eye. Take it for what it is. Its not what they botle, but an in-between made up ib thy fly. Naturally in, consistent, its still a good bar option when you are in the pub. Not great, but drinkable when Mama bear and Papa bear are not what you want."

"I'd say 75 Minute doesn't match up to its counterparts. I'd personally prefer of 60 or 90 over this. The craftsmanship is definitely there, which it gets extra credit for. It's an enjoyable beer, but nothing to write home about, in my opinion. The hop flavors and aromas don't seem to shine. Reguardless of me not being crazy about the aromas and flavors, it's still a pretty fun beer to drink, like most DFH beers. I recall enjoying this much more in the past. I hate to sound so harsh, because I'm a longtime DFH fan."

"Tastes similar to what my nose picked up. It's juicy and then bitter, with the citrus dominating and, to my pleasant surprise, the maple syrup takes a muted back seat to the hops. Whatever role the syrup plays I like the end whole result, as an IPA flavored like maple syrup appeals to me in no way whatsoever. It comes off to me as a unique IPA with citrus zest. Of all other DFH IPA's I've tried, the citrus profile of this one reminds me most of the retired Squall. I least favor the 60 minute, but for a blend of the 60/90, this works. There's a puckering tart in the finish, yet doesn't come off overly dry. Nicely balanced, and with medium carbonation, and a lighter body makes for smooth sipping. Would like to see 6-packs. I hope this is on Texas shelves more regularly; should i have picked up more than one bottle?"

"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, dryer orange citrus rind like hops. In the taste, orange citrus hops, a dryer end, and a nice maltiness. A smooth and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry orange citrus rind in the aftertaste. A bit malt heavy, but really nice nonetheless."

""

""
""
""

"Slightly hazed iced tea color with a rocky and dimpled head that lingers very long. Low aroma of sweet malt, caramel, some piney hops and orange rind. Flavor is a bit rough-edged, a bit boozy upfront, thick honey malt, firm bitterness, but the hop flavor is subdued. Maple syrup emerges noticeably in the finish, semi sweet, it polishes up the rough edge. Mouthfeel is full and rich, with a warming of the cheeks, a bit slick. Interesting beer, seems like a novelty. I might prefer sixty minute or ninety minute each on their own."

"O - why is this only a rotating offering? That's the only fault I see with this ipa. The addition of maple syrup do what's intended in creating a smooth easy going ipa while still getting big unique DFH flavor across to the drinker. The balance and smoothness really go from how it sits in the glass to the last drink. I'm going on a hunt for more of this before its gone. I wish breweries would read these reviews because this needs to be in consideration for a year round spot. Put it in the same odd ball bottles, I'm not asking for a 6 pack of 12 oz bottles. I'm just asking that this particular 75 minute ipa is available more throughout the year. My favorite Dogfish ipa? Without question. My favorite Dogfish offering of any kind? It's close. A top 3 without question."

"O - Tasty offering, maple character brings something somewhat unique to this brew, although mostly as an accentuating factor for the malts. Better than 60, lacking the borderline roasty depth of 90"

"Overall I don't think I could justify the price again seeing how close it was to my beloved 60 minute but at triple the cost. Worth trying once just to have a maple infused IPA."

"Pours a hazy amber color with a great frothy head that has nice retention. Aroma a little underwhelming with some pine and sweetness coming through. Flavor is a great balance of earthy hop flavor with sweetness from the malts and what I am assuming is maple. Nice creamy mouthfeel and overall found this beer very drinkable and a refreshing change of pace from some of the hop bombs which I also do love. Will drink again."
""
""
"What makes me love this beer is that is is a perfect blend of 60 minute and 90 minute. The aroma is all 90 minute while the flavor profile is very very similar to 60 minute. If you have had either, you will understand and see that this beer lives up to the name and lies perfectly in between both brews. Solid, tasty stuff."

"O: a good quality although pricy IPA, unique from 60 and 90 min, bottle conditioning provides nice carbonation and feel"
"Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with a huge off white head that leaves lots of stickies on the way down. Smells of earthy citrus and resinous pine with a solid shot of bread and caramel to back it up. The flavor follows the aroma quite well but adds a hint of tropical fruit to the mix. Light hop bitterness with lots of flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. Nice solid old school leaning IPA, put it into 6 packs and its a winner."

"Overall, pretty good, but not what I hoped for. Granted I am not the biggest maple fan, and I do think they mixed it quite well into this beer, but the result is not that remarkable. Perhaps it is a bit faded."

"O: Interesting story about how this is made, similar to their Burton Baton. This beer is quite the gem, it is just so smooth. Very rare for an IPA. No harshness at all. It is perfectly malty and hoppy. Plus, the dude on the label looks like a younger version of Eugene Levy and it made me laugh."
""
""
"For a brewery infamous for odd experiments 75 Minute IPA is far from an intriguing blend, but it may be the best beer Dogfish Head has ever put in a 750ml bottle. A good IPA is not a concept that can be easily encapsulated by numbers but hand it to whoever thought to split the difference between the 60 and 90 Minute IPAs - I would take one of these over both of those."
""
""
"Poured entire bottle (1 pt 9.4oz) into a 34oz mug; cloudy bright orange-yellow with lively carbonation and a thick head from even a careful pour. For a bit, even in the huge mug there was almost equal parts head to beer. Smell is classic IPA; hoppy and floral, with a bit of sugary sweetness hiding in there somewhere. Taste is very much classic IPA. Clean and sweet up front, hoppy and bitter to finish. This one is quite tame compared to some of the hop-bombs being produced nowadays, very drinkable. The maple syrup isn't really detectable as far as I can tell, although that could be the source of some of the extra sweetness in the beginning. Mouthfeel is fuller and a bit fizzy, but clean. Big chunky lacing is left on the mug as it's drunk, a very pretty beer. Overall this is a great happy medium from DFH; it has the clean drinkability and hoppiness of the 60 minute, plus some of the body and alcohol of the 90 minute."

"O - It has been awhile since I have had a 60 or 90 minute IPA. This beer is more malty than the IPA's I have been purchasing lately. I used to love the maltier IPA's when I was a young BA.

"Slightly hazy orange with a sticky, tight, creamy head. A very attractive looking beer with its bubbly covering and patchy lace. Plenty of hops in the aroma...grapefruit, apricot, pineapple, and other fruit on top of some toasted caramel, nuts, and maple. Big citrus, pine resin, grass, biscuit malt, and some alcohol. Pretty well-balanced...closer to 90 than 60. Medium bodied and slick with a firm bitterness and more appropriate carbonation than I expected, since the cap only gave a weak hiss when I popped it. Nice..."

"Whipped up white head of mostly larger bubbles, dimples if not craters, the lacing is a little less sticky than expected, overall the retention is decent. Cloudy bright orange to yellow hued liquid, no bubbles visible. The nose is soft and actually unassuming, emphasizes sweet orange, grapefruit citrus, maple of course, pine sap and cocoa, smells like a bowl of fresh fruit with melon, grape, peach and apple scents, fresh and floral with nary a trace of bitterness and no booziness either. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied with a light fluffiness from the broad spreading carbonation. Has a drying texture underneath which sucks out the excess sweetness from the pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime citrus and peach, apricot, pineapple fruit. Here too leans on more agreeable pine, flowers and malted milk balls than hoppy bite, this causing the effect of a more easy drinking style but leaves you wanting in the complexity department. Sweet orange pekoe tea. The maple is there yet not really a major factor, could just as easily be called honey or caramelized brown sugar, just a thread in the weave. At times could be a sweetened oatmeal breakfast with a slice of grapefruit on the side. While quite nice, not something you’d especially remember even if you’d be happy if someone handed you a glass of it."

""
"I've had the simpler cask version at the brewpub in Rehoboth. This is a much simpler form of the beer- simply a mix of 60 and 90 dry hopped in the ""Johnny Cask," with maple syrup. The bottle version is a different brew- mixing the recipes for 60 and 90, but not actually blending the beer, then bottle conditioning with maple syrup. The cask version is excellent, the maple is a bit more pronounced, and the mouthfeel is dynamite, soft and lightly carbonated. It's less hoppy than the bottle version, though."

"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a large tulip glass. The smell was of molasses and syrup with strong piney-hop influence. I would describe the color that of clover honey. The taste was moderate pine hops up front with a mild malt backbone and a slight lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel was perhaps the best characteristic of the beer, a light/medium, very pleasant, making it easy to finish the bottle unassisted. Overall though, I found this beer to be between average and good."

"Overall: This is a fantastic brew. I've enjoyed DFH's 60 minute and 90 minute IPAs (with 90 minute being better in my opinion) and I may like this brew more than both. The maple syrup adds another dimension to this flavor wise. I'm not sure what the date on the bottle said because I'm not trying to decode those numbers, but it's not as hoppy as the 60 or 90. With that being said, I think that this beer is quite delicious and if I find this on the shelf, I may buy it every time. Awesome brew!"

"DFH did this one well, as I would describe it as between 60 and 90 Minute. Drinks more like a DIPA in my opinion. A good beer from DFH which I would pick up again."

""
""
"(from 2/9/13) Poured from 750ml bottle to snifter a dark golden color with a nice head. Aroma of hops and citrus with a slight maple undertone. Mouthfeel is a medium carb and smooth. Taste is bitter hops at first then becomes a bit sweeter Overall I love this. Very tasty and drinkable. Wish it came in 6 packs"

""
""
""
""
"This is very, very good stuff here, folks. I would have liked just a tad more maple syrup, but the rest of the beer is a super solid IPA, borderline dIPA territory with the heady hop profile. The more I drink unfiltered IPA's, the more I'm coming to realize that that is where the flavor I want is. Grab it if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
"I really like this beer and think it might be my favorite ipa from dfh."
""
""
"Poured a reddish seethru body with golden tints and a two-finger soapy head that died slow and left a lace ring down the glass. Strong floral hoppy aroma dominates the nost but getting some biscuity/bready malts as well (can't say I detect any maple aroma). Taste/mouthfeel is more of the same as the beer is hoppy, sharp citric, piney, some grape, a little bit of sweetness added in for balance for an overall very good hoppy beer that isn't a hop bomb."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty solid IPA all around. The addition of maple syrup was a nice twist to this style that has been beaten into the ground. I enjoyed this quite a bit and will have to revisit it again when I can get my hands on it."

"I have been waiting to get to taste this for a while as these have been scarce for some reason where I live. As a big fan of DFH's 90 minute and a not as big fan of their 60, I really didn't know what to expect here. But as stated above, it follows the naming convention well, and finds a happy medium between DFH's two flagship IPAs. A well rounded brew, the 75 minute will not dissapoint in any category, but it will not blow your mind either. While it is a nice crossover from light and heavy IPA, I think it is rare that that is what people will be desiring, and I doubt they will want to pay the considerable price tag when 90 minutes are far cheaper. If you like DFH, try it once, but don't be expecting a new favorite."
""
""
""
"The greatest thing is how it feels. It is dangerous drink since it feels creamy and pleasurable, like a tall glass of chocolate milk."
""
""
"O: This beer is a bit of a dichotomy. In one sense, it tastes just like an IPA should, but then there is the maple sweetness that is entirely out of place in an IPA. I'll admit, I prefer West Coast style IPAs, but I can appreciate a mildly sweet IPA when it's made well, but the maple in this beer just doesn't blend well and does absolutely nothing to improve it."

"O: I'm very glad I got to try this one. It's not a hop bomb, which I prefer, but it's very drinkable."
""
"Dogfish seems to be getting the IPA right here. 75 minute has a great body and at 7.5% it hits a nice place in the IPA world. The citrus notes are wonderful. The only problem is the malt is a bit too sweet and seems to take over when sipped."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Subjectively speaking, this beer is too sweet for me, especially if marketed as an IPA. I expect more crispness and bitterness; if I wanted a strong, sweet brew, I'd buy an Arrogant Bastard for half the price."
""
"Oh, yeah! A truly excellent AIPA. Although my primitive tasting skills didn't pickup anything specifically related to the maple syrup used in this beer's creation, it doesn't really matter since, no matter how this was crafted, this is one tasty, easy drinking hop bomb ale. Mellow in feel, powerful in taste and complexity."
"O-extremely well balance ipa with great flavors. Dogfish doesn't always blow me away, but they always make solid ipas. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I liked it, but I wasn't 'in like' with it. I was lucky enough to share this bottle with someone but I don't think it's worth the $25 they payed for the bomber. Just feels like it's missing something that could bring it to that next level. Would I drink it again? Probably not unless I was at the brewery having it on-tap."
""
""
"Well it's been a long time since I've had something from dogfish that was really quite nice. This is a very nice beer. Very smooth flavor profile. Touches of sweetness that don't get out of control. I like it. Nice firm bitterness that doesn't go over the top. It's good."
"750ml bottle poured into snifter. Pours amber with a little haze. Moderate fluffy white head with some lacing, good retention. Grapefruit and pine aroma with hints of pineapple. Pleasant hoppy pine flavor in the beginning with a light citrus/sweet fruit finish and a touch of malt. Well carbonated and crisp, nice mouth feel. Overall a great beer, enjoyed this IPA."

"O - Definitely would try again. I am rarely if ever let down by DFH and their IPA offerings. I would put this closer to the 90 min but with that small twist of maple added to it. Good Stuff."
""
"Imo, it is better than the 60 minute, but isn't better than the 90 min. but i would defently get it again and i would recomend it."
""
" O – Overall this is near where I hold the 90 minute, which is in a very high tier, but falls just slightly short. Very well done and an awesome beer though, and one I shall certainly enjoy again. Definitely worth picking this up and I highly recommend it."
""
"Grab one, it's great. I prefer it to the sixty & the ninety, though I do greatly respect the 60 minute in particular. Less maple then I expected, particularly considering the brewer. Evidence of bottle fermentation is also minimal. Smell & flavor were damn, damn good. Appearance less than stellar, and mouthfeel provides a squeeze I don't need. Indeed, had I drank this blind, I mighttt have mentioned maple in the scent, but probably wouldn't have pinned it in the flavor. In sum, it seems the maple ends up mellowing an impressively blended IPA into a beguiling and deliciously mellow brew."
""
"O - Share a bomber, quickly."
""
"Quite unique with the maple syrup being so forward - like Sunday brunch in a bottle."
""
""
""
"Overall, more traditional of what I would consider to be an IPA than the 60 minute. Good hop flavor character, nice, strong malt body, slightly sweet, and a good, bitter finish. Wouldn't have known maple syrup was added, by flavor or aroma profiles."
"O: so glad I finally found this as I've been searching for this for an exceptionally long time. Well worth the wait and I may have to go pick up some more bombers of this. If this doesn't make one a fan of American IPA's, nothing will. As of today, this is my all time favorite Dogfish Head beer."
""
""
""
"*from notes: 11-30-12"
"O: This is the real deal. Beers like this are why I will never hate on Dogfish nor Sam for his ambition. Some beers are hit or miss but overall the love is there and beers like this are there. This is a phenomenal beer."
""
""
""
"overall, a good beer, but I didn't rate it very high because of lack of maple flavor even though it is clearly marked on the label."
""
""
"O: Good, very tasty beer. It was not a hop bomb at all, and the balance of the beer was very well done, though perhaps not my personal preference for an American IPA. Not quite what I was hoping for, but I'll gladly drink another."
""
""
""
"Overall a different beer, it is OK but I don't think I would pick this again over a 60 Minute IPA from the same brewery."
"Been waiting to try this one for a while and im glad i found it. Really nice well bodied slighty sweeter than normal IPA. Not something i would go and find again but a solid brew for sure."

"D - A very nice brew from DFH... However, the bottled version while still very good is a distant cry from the cask version served at the DFH brewpub which I consider to be epic... The appearance and aroma aren't too far off, but the flavor and mouthfeel are a bit of a let down... Forgetting about the cask version for a moment, this is still a nice beer, but given the value proposition I'm not sure i wouldn't opt for a sixer of 60-minute or a four pack of 90-minute if presented the option in the future..."
""
""
"T: I was expecting this to be really sweet, but it's actually way more on the dry side, which is kind of nice. A slow lead in of bready malt and caramel leads to grapefruit, lemon rind, orange peel, peppery hops with a hint of floral hops and black pepper mixed in. A touch of tropical sweetness hiding in the background. Maybe the barest trace of maple on the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect and creates a refreshing sensation without showing much booze."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, 2012 bottling. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 3 finger dense off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Very nice dense soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, pine, lemon, herbal, floral, grass, caramel, bread, light maple, and light piney spiciness. Excellent aromas with great balance and hop complexity. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, pine, lemon zest, caramel, bread, herbal, floral, grass, earth, toast, maple, and piney spiciness. Good amount of piney bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, caramel, bread, toast, herbal, floral, grass, earth, maple, and spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice hops flavor complexity and balance; awesome malt/hop bitterness balance; zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, slick, sticky, and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent IPA! Great hop complexity and malt flavor balance with the maple syrup; extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering as I expected."

"Overall: The body of the beer is medium with a full finish. When I first heard about an IPA with Maple syrup, I thought oh no it is going to be nasty. But now that I have tried it, I will recant my statement. Probably one of the best in the series of the Minute beer. Great IPA all around."
"O. As with all Dogfish beers the crafting is clear. The drinkability of this beer is fantastic. I will seek and ensure I have one of these bottles around so that when looking for a great IPA, I have one. Non IPA lovers may find this a great way into the style. "
"Poured from a large bottle, this is a very attractive beer. Clear and a lightly-amber golden color, the beer has an enormous, firm white head. The aroma is full of fruit and herbal-hop characteristics. Grape, apricot, grass, and lots of resiny, earthy, spicy hops. The taste is very well balanced. More sweetness up front than I expected, backed by solid malt flavor and a frontal wall of hops. Long-lasting hop bitterness with lots of flavor. Firm and full in body. This is a great beer."
""
"750ml bottle found at BevMo in Valencia, CA. Pours a highly carbonated, cloudy, golden-orange color. The head is fluffy, white, and slow-going down. Scent is nothing like I thought it would be. When I saw that this beer was brewed with maple syrup...I was expecting it to be the most malty of 60 and 90 minute. However, both 90 and 60 minute are more malty than 75. Weird. Scent is a bit underwhelming with mellow hops...and hints of honey. Struggling to pick up the maple syrup. Taste is...still no maple syrup. I think I enjoyed Squall much more than this. Hops...but lack of depth. Doesn't have that malt profile that 60 and 90 minute have...yet, doesn't have that hoppiness I love as a California craft beer drinker. Mouthfeel is great with the smooth, creaminess. Not too harsh on the bitterness. Overall, I would drink this one over 60 and 90 minute any day. However, I need to review this to the style. It makes no sense for an IPA that claims to be in the middle of the two maltiest IPAs I've ever had...to be not that malty at all. Again, weird. Tasty beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours hazy golden with a massive exploding head. Aroma of citrus lemon hops. Smells so fresh. All the pine hops you expect up front, with an interesting sweet finish that keeps the bitter from hitting the back of your throat. Less citrus flavor than I would expect from te nose, but the maple keeps a smooth, faintly sweet pine hop taste. Good stuff. Prefer this to the 90."

"O: A great IPA, but would you expect any less from DFH? Highly drinkable, totally tasty, and definitely recommendable. Would have again."
"O: Not bad. Pretty good. Would drink again...especially for the price. Might be my fave of the DFH ""minutes""..."
"O: A great blend of two great beers that I might even like better than either of its parents. This combines the 60 Minute's smooth balance and the 90 Minute's sweet, intense profile with a nice sugary, syrupy foundation of maple, and the result is fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is pretty enjoyable, and I prefer it over the 90 Minute a lot"
""
""
"75 Minute IPA is good beer. Frankly, I think it’s just a tad better than 60 Minute and 90 Minute. It just seems to have a little more oomph than 60 Minute and a little less sweetness than 90 Minute. Good stuff. Definitely worth picking up."
"Golden yellow with an amber hue and a bit hazy. Poured with a huge, billowy white foam that leaves sticky lacings on the glass and maintains to the finish. Grainy, toasty , sweet malty aroma with citrus and pine notes. Delicate, smooth lager-like feel with soft carbonation. Citrus hop flavors ride a steady wave of toasted and sweet malty flavors from beginning to the finish. Citrus hops transition to pine hops at fhe finish. Malty sweetness seems to dial-up at the end too. More balanced than 60 minute and not as sweet as 90 minute. Wish this was available in the 12 oz format."

""
""
""

""
"Overall, a really good beer that does met your expectation of a slightly sweeter mixed 60 and 90. While I liked it, I didn't love it so I'll probably stick to the 60 for my DFH hop fix...maybe the 75 if it came in a 12oz format. Avail here in TX as an occasional release."
""
""
""
""
"This was a very good overall beer. I am a fan of the 60 Minute and like 90 minute so it falls in the middle. Not a lot of the maple syrup comes through, but I believe it helps create the color of the beer which is a nice amber. When I poured this into the glass there was a good amount of white head, but this did not fade fast. There were plenty of hops and malt to go along. The pine and citrus came through nicely. I have to say the only thing I do not like is that our local store only got a case of these in."
"Great to finally try this beer.Poured into a tulip glass a burnt orange tinged golden with a huge blooming head that ran over the glass even with gentle pour,I was not a huge fan of that.Great fresh citrus aromas along with ahint of nuttiness,not much in the maple category but the aromas are great.The label is right the mouthfeel is pretty smooth as it glides down pretty easily.Piney and citric on the palate with the malt backbone lacking a bit,it's pretty dry with the maple coming thru in the finish and aftertaste.The alcohol is well hidden the hops are generous but the malt backbone needs to be amped up a tad...in my opinion."
""
"Not bad, i like it better on taop. I don't get the maple syrup as a priming sugar for the bottles, i didn't get much of it at all. Also don't get why the suggest to age it."

"QUITE GOOD, WORTH GRABBING!"
"A very nice, well crafted IPA. Flavors and feel are the highlights here."

"O: awesome beer - the perfect marriage of their lighter 60 minute and heavier 90 minute IPAs - a winner. Must buy it if you see it."
"O: I've been wanting to try this one for a long time. It's pretty good. Not quite what I expected but good none the less. If you have a chance to grab one it's worth a try."
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a huge white head that dissipated very slowly, leaving massive lacing. Aroma of tropical fruits and light citrus, bready malt. Flavor is strong citrus hops with sweet pineapple, mango and citrus rind. Sweet bready malt with a resinous character that must be the maple, but does not distinctly taste like maple syrup. Finishes with citrus hops and a light syrupy sweetness. Well integrated and unique flavors. Medium bodied with active sparkling carbonation. A definite repeat on the rare occasions that I can find a bottle of this. It stayed on the shelves here for less than a nanosecond."
""
""
""
"O - a bright hop forward IPA with lots of character and depth without burning your taste buds"
""
""
""
"Overall - Nicely done, one of the more enjoyable dogfish beers ive had. It still has that roasted flavor that all minute series beers have, espically the 90 minute that i dont like. but with the sweet and bold maple, it really balances the beer and makes it enjoyable, and not over the top like most dfh beers. Easly my favorite minute beer, and one of the best dfh beers."
"O - A great brew. I think its up there with the Burton Baton as far as Dogfish Head's best. Definitely better than the 60 minute, and slightly ahead of the 90. Well done Dogfish Head!!"
""
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass, this just came in the shop so I'm assuming its fresh. This pours a slightly hazy golden brown with an enormous off white head with has long retention and leaves a lacing, almost over carbonation. The smells are of pine hops with some caramel and a hint of maple. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty good, a nice medium amount of hops with some sweet maple and caramel, nice sweet hop balance."

"This is very easy to drink and I personally think this is better than 60 or 90 Minute IPA. Good job Dogfish Head!!"
"Very nice looking beer. The beer practically glows with a rich orange-ish amber color. Nice puffy white head. Good lacing. Fairly hazy beer, which I sort of enjoy. Aroma is solid. Lots of citrus. Big grapefruit note. Some tropical flavors in the mix - pineapple, mango. Some raspberries. Warm caramel tone in the background. More hop forward than I expected. Pleasant yeastiness. I'm a bit less positive about the taste. It's just a bit of a letdown. A little too subdued. The hop bitterness is a tad bland. The maple syrup-tinted malt plays a larger role than in the aroma. Medium sweet for an IPA. Not quite as much yeast presence. Mouthfeel is harsh and odd. Bubbles are too big and strong. The beer doesn't puff up all that much in the pour, so this came as a bit of a surprise. The finish is also kinda sticky. It doesn't ruin the beer, but I think I'd strongly prefer this one out of a cask. Just doesn't quite translate to the bottle. Still, it's a fun beer, and as someone who isn't a big fan of 90 min or 60 min (I did quite like Squall) , I rather enjoyed this beer."

"Overall: You know what, drinking this brew sip after sip and a gulp here and there I have easily grown into it. I would buy it again but maybe for a better price than what I paid. I have been searching for this brew for quite a few and have been craving it, does it live to the ""hype"" depends who you ask. For me I have had almost every DFH IPA and right now wouldn't mind a ""90"" or Squalls (if I could find one), still a very descent brew. Salud!"

"Overall a solid IPA. Nothing particularly special or unique about it, clearly well crafted, but it's just OK."
"O - This is a really cool beer with a well rounded profile, exhibiting opposite ends of the spectrum. I would be interested in having this on occasion versus the 60 and 90, although I would not say this trumps either."
"C"
""
"O-This beer is a bit odd. I think I would like it more if it was a four pack. For the price I would choose ninety minute any day but it is somewhat session able. It's better than sixty minute but nowhere near as good as ninety minute and nothing near squall. Frankly I wish squall was back and this was removed from the lineup."
"Poured from a bomber to a pint glass. The appearance is nice and hazy golden with great opacity. The smell comprises of malt, pine and citrus with maple notes. It tastes sweet with almost a faint molasses taste followed by full bodied hops which gives a bitter yet inviting after taste. The body is full and rich while maintaining the perfect carbonation. Overall it is a great beer, another great brew from DHB and a buy again. Still preferable to the 90 minute but a great beer nonetheless."
"O: Really let down on this one."
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, this is a golden orange color with a slight fluffy head. Smell is heavy on orange and other citrus. Taste is also heavy on orange, but not overly bitter for an IPA. Alcohol presence is very low. This is brewed with maple syrup, but I didn't notice any flavors related to this. Overall, I would characterize this as a light and easy to drink IPA."
"Overall: IMO, a better version of the 60 minute. Not as malty as the 90, and far more complex than the 60. Again, I suspect this is where the syrup is the difference maker. Highly recommend and it is also reasonably priced at $7 a bomber--though this is pretty hard to find in ATL."
"Medium mouthfeel in the texure and very drinkable. Great combination brew with some near-perfect enhancements."

"O-Overall probably my favorite IPA from DogFish head. For $7.50 here in Raleigh, hard to beat the price. Too bad it's very limited!!"
""
""

""
""
"O: My favorite of all the ""minute IPA"" brews. 90 is too malty for me, and 60 seems to be lacking something. Was hoping for a bit more complexity with the maple syrup, but still has a presence. The lingering fluffy head and creamy body really caught me off guard, but in a really good way. My wife really liked as well, and I think she said it best when she said ""I would drink this again."" I concur."
""
"This IPA had a nice soft citrus taste. It was not extremely hoppy, but the presence of the cascade hops is definitely noticeable. I had Dogfish 60, 90 & 120 minute IPA's and I favor this one the most. Unfortunately, it is very limited. If you enjoy an IPA that is not extremely powerful (ex. imperial IPA), I would recommend drinking this. It's 7.5% ABV. The appearance has a nice golden/orange hue. I was expecting to taste more maple syrup because Dogfish uniquely use this ingredient when they blend the 60 & 90 minute together. However, I did notice a slight sweetness to the beer that I find enjoyable. This beer is limited and I suggest you try tasting it before it is gone. You will not be disappointed."
""
"This is a winner, winner beer. This should be the signature beer of DFH, it's that good. Perfect blend and perfect mouthfeel. Love it."

"O-A solid beer, but pretty similar to the 60 min., but with a little more malt flavor. Somewhat disappointed that I couldn't taste the maple syrup because I think that would have really elevated this beer to the next level. Would buy again if they offered it as a 4/6 pack option but not worth the 750ml treatment/premium."
"Overall, this is one tasty brew. Not what I expected, but a veritable treat for the palate. Nice to enjoy while watching the Pats dominate in London."
""
""
""
""
"This is simply an outstanding beer from the folks at DFH. I find it to be far superior to both their 60 minute and 90 minute IPAs. Enjoyable, not too boozy, well-balanced between bitter and sweet, and with citrus-like hop flavors instead of piney, resin-like notes. Excellent beer. Very well done!"
"O: I still prefer the 60 min, but its solid. Probably wouldn't buy again, but glad I tried it."

"O- I really enjoyed this beer, the tropical hops and sweet malt and maple syrup work really nicely together. It's also very drinkable. This is definitely one of the best offerings I've had from DFH."

"3.5 D: No complaints. A well rounded beer that anyone would enjoy."

"I like to think of this ale as an American IPA in tastee, but of an English IPA in proportion and mouthfeel.

"Very low carbonation, even for a cask conditioned beer. Excellent malt beginning--the sugars are caramelized so the beer is not sweet. For an IPA, this is a malty brew. Good hop presence, but not extreme in any sense. Long bitter aftertaste tells you this is an IPA. Still, I find the flatness a distraction."

"Overall: This is a must have not only for hop lovers as the title (and Dogfish Head themselves) suggests but for any and every craft beer drinker. This is such a drinkable beer that I am slightly upset that Dogfish Head has not released these in four- or six-packs yet. The bomber is great, but the quaffability begs for a four- or six-pack treatment. The worst part (or best, really) is the undeniable fact that this beer gets better as it warms and you drink more of it. Dogfish Head, come back to Wisconsin. I need this in my fridge at all times… 18/20"
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the strong appearance, and fresh nose. We were a little let down with this guy, to be honest. As a “special” beer that is rarely available we were expecting more of a punch, but it is hard to say from where. For such a renowned beer we thought the maple syrup might have a larger role here, or that the malt profile would be denser, to back up a massive hoppiness. These things were hard to find, and while it may have been in our minds, we are having trouble seeing what all the fuss is about. That being said, it is a tasty beer for the style, and something we would be happy to slurp on the regular."

"Perfect balance of the 60 and 90 minute IPAs. Pours closer to the color of the 90 - nice brown to amber. Significant head - sometimes too much but not a big deal. Head clings to the side of the glass, cup, whatever. Great fresh hop smell. Taste is better than both the 60 & 90 for me - the bottle conditioning with the maple syrup is present and gives the hops a sweet flavor. A favorite no doubt."

"Pours real dark caramel with hints of red and copper. Thin and bubbly white head, which starts out at about a finger or less but thins out to the edge. Can see through this beer. Roasted caramel and maple incorporated in smell, along with some light floral and malt hops. Taste dominated by caramel with hints of maple and bready goodness. Mouthfeel is light, creamy and smooth with a bit of bite, not much. Overall really like this from the cask."
""

""
""
"Medium bodied with some tight carbonation and subtle signs of infection. Balance of dry and sweet notes.  Dry bitterness with some earthy/soily notes that get overpowered by malt profile and maple.  Hints of toffee, caramel hazelnut and syrup. Too malty and sweet with little to no interesting hop flavor."

"The taste and feel lack compared to the aromas. Still, a quality IPA and very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel: Medium body, medium carbonation. Bottle conditioning makes this smooth and easy drink. The maple syrup adds a bit too much sweetness than I would have cared for. I think I like the straight up 75 minute at their brewpubs over this one. I would almost say it's a slightly toned down 90 minute. Not a bad beer just a little sweet for an ipa."

"O: This beer is pretty well balanced and quite enjoyable - not too sweet or too bitter which seemed like a real possibility after reading the label. Easy enough to drink and the alcohol is well hidden."
"O- Excellent IPA. Cask brought out a little more of the maple, but solid from the bottle as well."
"Overall a good beer. Level of carbonation was slightly annoying and could use a stronger aroma."

"O - Easy enough to drink, and by no means a ""bad"" beer, However, I prefer 90 minute, and feel this was enjoyed more as a ""tick"". Don't see myself readily grabbing for it if presented the opportunity."
"Pours a four finger white head that stays leaving a good lace. hazy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit hop nose and flavor is grapefruit hops that are mellowed by the maple syrup. Higher ABV is hidden. Light bitter aftertaste. $8.59 for a 750ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."

"O: Dogfish makes some great beers and this one is no exception. Drink it if you can find it."

"Best of the timed IPAs from DFH. Exceptional balance between hops and malt. Not an in your face hop bomb nor a boozy IIPA. Subtlety here. Both hops and malt are noticeable in aroma and flavor. The maple comes out at the very end where there is a tad of acidity. Body is medium, perhaps on the light-medium side. Despite the claim, mouthfeel is soft, but not soft as other bottle conditioned beers. A great compromise between West coast and East coast."
"O: Overall it takes a few sips to truly reveal the complexity of this beer, the first few I saw nothing special but as the drink progresses the sweet maple syrup and sweetly toasted grain lends support and balance coming though nicely and the hops become brighter. Drinkability becomes easier, smoother and more enjoyable. Reluctantly to say I don’t entirely agree with the “sometimes 60 is not enough and 90 is to much” bottle labeling. As with most instances of hybrids you lose the best part of the spectrum with the blending of the two. The 60 a much more crisper summer time treat, the 90 a more wine body and complexity with alcohol warmth, both I wouldn’t compromise for this."
""
""

"The nose is sweet, almost like molasses. The hops really arent that evident. There are some hints of piney hops though. The taste is definitely IPA. Sweet, sticky pine with slight notes of citrus which followed by a syrupy sweetness and quickly swarmed by a 90 Minute-esque hoppy/malt balance. This is just as awesome as I had hoped. I need many more."
"Overall, this is quite a good beer. It's a well balanced IPA worth a try if you can find it. If not the 60 minute will do just fine."

"O - Better than the 90, IMO. Less malty but I wish this beer was brighter in some aspects."
"There's a little alcohol burn at the end of each sip and the beer didn't have as much maple as I thought it would. Still, it's tasty, well balanced and easy to drink."
"D: This was a decent beer, but really not that great. The smell and taste were ok, and the body was better. It had a smooth finish, so it was easy to drink. Not a bad brew, but really not worth seeking out."
"Great IPA! Absolutely delicious and unlike any of its counterparts. DFH got this right."
"M&D - rich and complex, a great twist to the DFH IPA's we all love."
"Overall, a very unique ipa. I like the maple syrup, but it was a bit too malty for me. Still glad I got to try this one."

"Pours a slightly hazy golden-orange color. The head slowly develops, but rises to about 1"" tall in my tulip pint. It soon falls to a film with a single island of rocky head. As it receded it leaves some nice lacing in my glass. Smell is of green, citric hops. I also detect a slight roasted note in the nose along with some sweetness. The aroma is actually rather complex, alone more complex than some beers. The taste starts sweet and smooth, I get citric hops that aren't overly aggressive (very east coast) a touch of roasted malts, a bit of maple. I can just barely taste tha alcohol towards the end. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, not what I expected, but good."
"All that flavor is packed into a pretty smooth beer that starts off boozy, moves to sweet and then dries out in the end. This is easily one of the most flavorful IPAs that does not rely on the massive hops load, leaving behind the malts, using them only to deliver the alcohol."

"This is cloudy with hops and bits suspended in a darker orange amber fluid. Prodigious head and tons of lacing. Covering lasts and is reinvigorated with each sip. Pretty active carbonation. Smell is full of tropical fruitiness and hops. A maple undercurrent flows through and carries with it the bits of malt, bread, and faint alcohol that get me going. Taste has an intense complexity. A mild biscuit malt front that is not huge but at the same time big enough to balance the huge amount of hops in this beer. Quite a feat as the carmel and crystal malt flavors come out nicely. The hops are superb. Tropical fruitiness, (mangos, pineapples guava) from the yeast and malt serve up a platform that showcases the dry hopping and wonderful primary hops. They have the lovely effect of being pronounced and balanced at the same time. There is a bit of melon juiciness. The maple gives a sophisticated kind of smokey sweetness. Finish is dry and somewhat long with lots of hops, oil, resin, and tropical grapefruit. A light biscuit and toasted bread linger. Feel is superb with a crispness that is wrapped in a velvety carbonation. A truly wonderful beer overall as it is delightfully drinkable and intensely flavored with a complex array of IPA staples. I'm getting more to enjoy now and cellar for a year or two as the bottle conditioning allows for that."

"O: I would take this over both 60 and 90 minuet.... I love the flavors at work here and the way they blend together, there is a bit of sweetness bit not too much.... Everything was very well done and i highly recommend giving one of these a whirl."
"I'd recommend a bottle... I just don't know where to tell you to get it."
"Overall: Really pleasant to drink, but nothing spectacular. I prefer it to their 60 min, and it certainly is preferable to some of the overblown imperial IPAs. It's a bit too similar to the mold, however, to be worth a repeat buy. I don't know what would happen if there was more of a maple aroma/taste to an IPA, but that was really the reason that I bought the beer in the first place, and I didn't really get that."

"Overall: Definitely a stand up offering from Dogfish Head. They know how to make an IPA and this is no different. The maple is a nice touch and adds some decent depth to an all-around solid IPA."
"Somehow this combines some of the best elements of 60 Minute and 90 Minute to create a legitimately different and undeniably enjoyable beer. The maple is just the cherry on top. Remarkably drinkable."
"o: pretty good ipa, dont know that i would drink it again. for me the maple syrup dominates too much and takes away from the hop flavors, aromas and bitterness."
""
""
""
"O- I found this one really easy to drink and hope I can run into this one again."

"O: A bit disappointing but definitely drinkable. Very malty like most DFH beers. I like the molasses but the hops could have been more prominent. Thanks again, Michael."
""
"Notes: A bold choice, bottle-conditioning an IPA with maple syrup. It's honestly not something that sounded appealing to me right away, but it really works in this beer."
"O - I used to really like Dogfish Head IPAs, but have essentially stopped buying them in the last few years due mostly to the high malt presence. Having said that, I enjoyed this quite a bit and found myself drinking it pretty quickly. The dry-hopping is quite nice with this one. This is still too malty to be a go-to IPA for me, but I would have it again."

"D - Very drinkable with a nearly perfect balance between the hops and malt. The hop character isn't nearly as pungent as I thought it might be, but oddly it doesn't hurt the overall impression of the beer. The thing that really strikes me is that the maple syrup is actually noticeable, its subtle, but it adds something nice to the background."
"Overall: More drinkable than the 60 minute with this one smoother and more sweet."
""
"O: Like just about everything else DFH does, this is interesting but not amazing. A lot more fruitiness than most IPAs and balanced with fairly aggressive wood and hop notes. Carbonation is a bit low and the flavors aren't as well-integrated as they should be. A bit of a tannic sweet fruity finish mars the experience on this one a bit, but still a solid IPA. Good job, DFH."
""
""
"O: A very unique beer that offers the drinker smothing that is different. I thought this beer would be sligtly sweeter because of the additon of the maple syrup. but the additon of the dry hoppiness is over powering."
"o - overall I have had this on draft before and remember it being slightly better, that said, not a bad beer. The label speaks of aging it which seems an odd recommendation for an IPA, but this isn't a hop bomb in the traditional sense of an IPA. Worth checking out."
"Got really excited to find a bottle of this recently. Poured in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazy, steadily carbonated yellow-orange coloring with a tall, frothy, light, big bubbled, white head that slowly settles into an uneven, chunky topping. Aromas of dry, peppery hops, subtle sugary sweetness, maple and caramel backbones, and a hint of citrus. Flavors are even more complex, with a hop forward presence followed closely by a roasted maple and slightly smokey characteristic. The backbone is a subtle caramel flavor, giving rise to hints of grapefruit and orange zest. The body is light, and added to the steady carbonation this gives the hops bitterness a slightly sharp feel, keeping the beer light and providing a clean finish. The aftertaste is a sweet and bitter balancing act, with the citrus and syrup holding down the fort alongside the mouthful of hops. The aftertaste is smooth, with a roasted sweetness that lingers just the right amount. This beer is delicious."
""
""
"Overall; Balance is the key here. Thou i did not taste much of the maple flavor, I enjoyed this IPA."
""
"O: Very drinkable, smooth and not harsh at all."
""
"Great looking golden-amber hue. Once settled, about a half-finger of head lingers. Has that distintive Dogfish smell to it, a nice balance of citrus hops and maltiness. I do pick up some woody notes, which I assume is the maple syrup. It has a slight, what I'm picking up as, an off-putting vinegar smell. The taste is nicely balanced between hop bitterness and malt backbone, however, I do pick up some small green apple notes. I pick up the maple syrup at the end of the sip, which I think is well done. Not too much to overpower the sweetness. Mouthfeel is on point and well-carbonated. Overall, a good IPA, and I'm glad I finally got the chance to try it. I guess I might have been expecting more though."
"This is an interesting take on an IPA. It stands out from a crowded feild. It is bold in the eathyness of the hops and the molassas provides a backbone that is strong enough to offset the hops and stand out on its own because to the sweet molassas flavor."
"O - Not a bad brew, a good mixture of 60 minute and 90 minute it seemed like. I enjoyed this brew but for me personally id rather have a 90 minute."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: DFH really makes a unique IPA here. I have drank the 90 minute and 60 minute IPA's and this is my favorite of the three. I hope that they put this beer in a 6 pack format. It was easy to drink the entire 750 bottle, but I think it would be better served in the smaller 12oz bottle. The maple syrup was not a huge factor in this beer; I was hoping it would be more prevalent than it was. The mouthfeel and carbonation on this beer is fantastic."
""
"All I can say was I had my hopes to high for this one and that while its good, its not 10 dollars a bomber (5 dollars a single if they offered it, heck 90 is only 2.50 a bottle). I assumed that the maple was going to make a huge influence on this brew, alas I'm only really noticing it in the finish, The beer poured cloudy yellow, it has a taste very much like 60 minutes, a tiny bit hoppier but not excessively, you'd never notice the maplw syrup unless you were looking for it. Its easy to drink, but at 10 dollars a bomber it makes the decision between 60 and 90 minute ipas easy enough."
"O: A beer I enjoyed immensely and look forward to having again in the future."
""
"O - Great look, great smell, great taste and great feel - an excellent offering from DFH, and me being depressed that only one bottle was to be had."
""
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a visually overboard amount of carbonation. However, as it settles in the glass, it becomes light and enjoyable. This brew was fairly drinkable and went down easy but I would have enjoyed this so much more without the minerals, veggy and sulfur quality that was present throughout."
"Overall: IPAs just really are not DFHs thing. They make some great beers, but their IPAs are not (I do like the wood aged Burton Baton though, and Squall was decent). Don't waste your time/money on this."

"O - easily my favorite DFH IPA. 120 is certainly enjoyable (every now and then) in its complexity and uniqueness, but who can drink 18%. This outshines 90 in its lack of east-coast palate destruction. This is a very quaffable brew. Definitely well-worth the search. Wish it was produced on the scale of 60 and 90."

""

""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a hazy orange yellow, with a two inch fluffy white head, that leaves lots of lacing all over. Smell is mango, maple, tangerine, grass, and some grapefruit. Taste is all of those things, mango and grass starting and maple and grapefruit in the finish. Body is large for its ABV, plenty of life, a little dryness in the finish, and easy drinking for the large body. This is very good."
""
""
""
"O - Overall this was a very enjoyable brew. I really like the hop presence in this beer. Glad I got to try it."
" Flavors of pine come forward with slight stone fruit tinges and mild floral aspects come in with light caramel and toasted malt flavors after the hops and sweetness wear off a bit. The nutty biscuit-like toasted taste is good adds dimension to the maple syrup and caramel malt while the mild spice of the hops keeps everything nicely balanced. There is an alcohol tinge with piney note and slight woody maple in the last sips. Overall a wonderfully complex beer, very drinkable and I enjoy the blend of 60 + 90 they have achieved. most IPA's aren't this well rounded and I recommend you get a bottle if you are on the fence."
""
"O: I like this as a nice treat instead of the 60 or 90. The maple was actually detectable which was a bit of a surprise. Given the price I wouldn't buy it too often though."
"Overall: Not bad. I would like to have had a little more maple presence, but considering the price and intention of the beer, a solid production."
""
"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of pine and light citrus hoppy notes with some sweet caramel malt. Taste is a mix between some medium hoppy notes with some citrus and resin notes backed by a solid and a bit too sweet caramelized malt backbone. Body is about average with medium carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not bad but definitely a bit too sweet which makes me wonder if maple syrup is really bringing anything worthwhile to the mix."
""
""
""
"Overall impression - It's never a good thing when the product description of an IPA refers to ""age-ability."""
"O: This is a solid brew. I'm really glad that they made this brew. I'd drink it again, but it's not my favorite."

"Overall interesting, nice his at first but then they seem to disappear, nice addition of the maple that doesn't get too sweet either, a big fill beer thats not too boozy. I like the original Johnny Cask version much better."

"A very intersting IPA. Not your typical everyday drinker but one to seek out."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with an off-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest. Taste is pretty much the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good IPA but nothing all that special."
""
"O: Overall its a nice, drinkable ipa, unique use of the maple is nice but makes it a bit heavier than I had wanted"
" Overall, a great take on an IPA. I really enjoyed the addition of the syrup; it wasn’t overdone to the point of lending an overly sugary taste or feel, but is certainly present in ample quantities to be recognizable in it’s own right. Well done!"
""
""
"Overall: Decent IPA. On the verge of being too sweet like the 90 Minute IPA, but it's still a well made beer. Complex with great combination of flavors. Typical Dogfish Head."

"Bomber into crispin glass...major head with delicate pour which doesn't bother me in good ipa cause I like to warm it for full flavor. Hazy orangish hop filled. Hop zesty goodness another good job by dogfish get you thinking what this reminds you of. I smell Gordon bierch marzen malt back bone with crazy hops to follow. Tastes of hops and malts and maple syrup that will have your tongue going for all the sugary aftertaste! Med/high Carb that the hops entertain your tongue . Overall my favorite of ipas from dogfish. I would love to try on tap and ran out bought up remaining 4 from local bottle shop at $12 a 22!! If was available would drink like 2 hearted or stone when desiring good ipa!! Really good taste great drinkability and German malt or something foreign catches my tastebuds that really balances it!!"
"O - Terrific brew. Hop heads will love it. Not as strong a dry-hop experience as a SN Torpedo, but reminiscent. It's more balanced than a Torpedo. Simply delicious."
""
""
""
"But overall, a quality IPA that won't knock your socks off but is a nice offering that I would like to revisit on tap."

"O - E. Coast style for sure. A unique and sold brew. Malt forward and sweet."
""
""
"O- A really interesting beer, especially if you've had enough of 60 minute and 90 minute separately, as you can really pull out what each brew brings to this party. I'll certainly have this again."
"An interesting derivation of the 60 and 90 minute ipas. The addition of the maple syrup is a welcome on, as it combines nicely with the dominant grapefruit flavors in the beer. The smell has to be the best part though; the citrus that it presents is quite powerful... in a good way."

"another great beer from dogfish head . had a very huge head had to pour delicately and not use my chilled glassware . the taste , aroma , and texture were a beautiful blend of this hand crafted piece of beer lovers paradise . I can't wait to taste it on tap again. can't wait from the anual vaca to the candy store for adult men(or any beer enthusiast). truley sucks that my favorite bar to 2 hours away ."
"Overall: I highly enjoyed this beer. Great combination of two great beers, and great extra twist with the maple syrup. The mouthfeel is excellent, and the mix of bitter hops and the slight aftershock of maple syrup is deliciously palatable. I was expecting more of a maple syrup feel from the beer, but now that I’ve tasted it I’m glad they didn’t over sweeten it. Good beer."
"Overall: I rather enjoyed myself. Delightful array of hop flavors smoothed with that little hint of maple and the vigorous carbonation is very effective at keeping things moving along nicely."
"O- an all-around solid offering of taste and body. I was lucky to get it on cask. I have a bottle as well that I hope lives up to this."
"Pored from bottle to pint glass the beer arrives a fairly clear copper amber color with a good 2 finger white head, decent retention and lacing. The nose is a bit different than I'd expect: a lot of caramel malt sweetness with a hint of maple syrup earthiness and hints of piney hop resin. Not as impressive as I would expect. The flavor improves on a disappointing nose in that the hop character is brighter and more vibrant with a more fuller citrus and pine and earthy quality. Smooth in character, what I'd expect in the nose. The maple flavor is a little subdued but provides a gentle layer that is pleasing. Finishes with a lingering caramel sweetness and mild bitterness. Creamy and smooth throughout. Overall, a treat to try, I wish the nose was a little more pronounced, aside from that a good brew!"
"O - I enjoyed had this on cask at the DFH pub in Rehobeth, so I was excited when I learned they planned to bottle it. The prospect of a bottle conditioned IPA with maple syrup was intriguing. It has a wonderful complexity of flavors that all work well together. It could stand to have a bit more in the hops department, but that isn't what the were going for. I appreciate the unique aspect the maple syrup adds to this beer and overall it was very good. I will definitely get this one again."
"This beer pours a light bodied tarnished copper in color and a three finger, bright white soapy head. The nose is very smooth and mainly malt driven. I get nice soapiness and almost a touch of honey. There is also a touch of pine on the finish. It isn't as hoppy as t could be but it still has a really nice nose. The flavors are interesting as well. It's smooth and mellow. It's malt forward first with slight maple. The hops are there in almost an English style manner, very subtle. Despite not being ""IPA esque"" I still really like it. It's different and drinks exceptionally smooth. This beer is really approachable, and somewhere in pale ale territory with interesting treatments. The light and smooth mouthfeel make drinking the bottle by yourself a pleasure. I like this beer and I'd recommend it. It's too bad I had to find it in Florida since DFH pulled out of Indiana a year ago :( ."
"Overall, not bad. I'd say I like it better than 60 minute, but not as much as 90, and not even close to 120. Not bad, but think they missed the mark on the syrup addition."
"Appearance and Smell had me thinking this was going to be on the level of Squall or something, but no, it's a whole other sort of beast. One to sip slowly and ponder. It's not quite as simplistic as its concept makes it seem. I appreciate its depth and character."
"Well i did like it overall but it was a little disappointing thinking that this might surpass my love for 90 and Burton Baton. Its pours golden with a huge fluffy head, a little over carbed. Its a little more on the 60 min side with flavor, ture balance though. Huge hop flavors balanced perfectly with the typical DFH malt backbone and sweet maple sryup. The maple is not dominant, just balances out the hops. Nice flavor, but nothing beats a Burton."
"O - I thoroughly enjoyed this one; more so than when I had it on cask at the Brewpub. It is a very approachable beer that, to me, is quite sessionable. Great beer to split with friends on a hot summer day...which I will hopefully be doing very soon!"
""
"The beer pours a hazy orange color with a large white head. The aroma is a mix of grass, apricots and orange from the hops, as well as some biscuit malt. The flavor has a great mix of hops, with some orange and pine, as well as some apricot and mango notes. There is also a little bit of sweetness from the toffee and biscuit malt, which keep the bitterness fairly low. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very easy to drink."
""
""
"M - Medium body and full of fresh hop oils. Moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: Very creative IPA here from DFH, which comes as no surprise. The hops aren’t overly bitter and the unique maple sweetness is not unwelcome and goes perfectly with the creamy body. I love Sam’s creativity and inquisitive nature around beer and how Dogfish pushes the limits of style. This is definitely one to check out, and could be a home run for someone who likes a maltier East Coast style IPA, but for me, I’ll stick to the stuff out west."
"Tasty treat and a bit different from its 60, 90, and 120 cousins. There is distinct malt characters that really shine in this beer."
""
""
"I'm not a huge DFH fan, but this brew puts them back on my map. I hope they continue to roll out brews like this. 75-minute is one of the best, most enjoyable brews I've had in sometime. Highly recommended for a ""lighter"" IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a orangeish copper, slightly yellowish, well retaining head. Lots of soapy lacework is left behind. Aroma of floral cascade hops, some sweetness, but mostly hops. In the mouthfeel, bright citrus hops and an almost nutty, sugary malt body that does a good job to balance. Little alcohol, mostly pine and citrus hops, somewhere in between the 60 and 90 minutes, Go Figure! Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and prickly. Overall, a very fine beverage and another winner from the minute line of Dogfish Head."
""
"I like 75 Minute more than 60, but less than 90. It has a nice bit of added complexity over the 60, but’s missing the big East Coast maltiness prevalent in 90."
""
"This is a nice, drinkable beer with an amazing mouthfeel. Highly hoppy, but also balanced. I would drink this any day over 90min or 60min."
""
""
"O - Overall, an interesting IPA. Definitely has a lot of the Dogfish Head ""house flavors"" to it, but somehow misses the mark a bit for me. The smell and appearance are both quite good to excellent, setting high expectations but the flavor let me down a bit. The balance towards sweet was a bit off to my palate."
"Overall - It's good. It's not great. The maple is the most interesting part, because the hop profile is boring."
""
"O: Very enjoyable and I could drink several in a row. A nice fragrant and thoroughly enjoyable brew. This might just be better than the sum of its parts. Seems like the perfect pint to toss back in the sun."
"Poured into a DFH glass a very nice golden dark orange color, nice carbonation, with a very nice two-finger thick/creamy white head, with lots of very nice thick sticky lacing left behind. The nose is a nice blend of malts/hops, and some citrus thrown in. The taste is slightly sweet, with some bitterness from the hops, nice little touch of citrus. Medium body. A nice brew, but I was expecting more, not quite in the same league as a 90 or even a 60 Min. IPA. Thanks Ben for the opportunity."

"O: Overall, quite good, an interesting blend of the 60- and 90-Minute IPAs, quite delicious and worth having again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow – I think this the best IPA by Dogfish head. 120 is too over the top, 90 is very good, and 60 is pretty good. But 75 has the perfect balance of alcohol and hops!"
"It pours a nice, deep gold color with a dense, creamy, off-white head. It smells nice and hoppy, but slightly subdued underneath all that foam. The flavor has great pine resin, and tropical fruit notes. Outstanding flavor! Medium bodied with low carbonation and a lingering, smooth but bitter finish."
""
"O- This really is the best of both worlds. I really prefer this over 90 and as much as fresh 60 minute. The maple syrup really helps and adds a wonderful depth to this beer."
""
""
"O: This is just another great beer from DFH and I dont know many beers like it. Well done!"
""
""
"Pours a hazy, burnt orange with a one-finger bright white head. Good lacing and retention. Complex aroma. Woodsy, toasted bread, orange and citrus notes as it warms. Big 60 minute toasted bread notes to start the flavor. Woodsy notes as well. Finishes with sweet notes. Sweet bread, a bit of sweetness from the maple syrup. Thick, smooth mouthfeel, attributed to the syrup, but still light at the same time."
""
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter. Pours a nice medium amber with a very nice white head. Smells of flowery hops and a little hint of maple, a very nice combination. Tastes of slight maple with a lighter roasted malt, and lots of hops to give it a great bite. This medium bodied beer goes down smooth with its perfect level of carbonation. Overall, an outstanding beer, worthy of the hype and another wonderful offering from Dogfish Head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy darker amber with billowing, dense white head. Rings of lace down the glass. Smell: toasted grain, caramel, earthy, slightly minty, with some orange citrus. Taste: toast, tangerine, apricot, earthy with herbal notes. Medium+ bodied with a luxurious, creamy feel. Glad to have tried, but doesn’t quite impress. Bottled 2012 C."
"Overall a good beer! Just like expected from Dogfish!"
"A 750 ml bottle from Dog and Bull in Croydon, poured into a Duvel tulip. This appeared as a clear copper with a large white head. This settled to a coating but left ample lacing. The nose was pine, citrus (especially lemon and orange) and some maple syrup. Taste was a nice interplay of hops and sweetness with emphasis on notes of citrus, some breadiness and the maple syrup. Body was medium, creamy and with a healthy carbonation. This is NOT a hop bomb, but a pleasant and remarkably well-balanced IPA, and it is more than just a combination of 60 and 90- minute. I like both but might like this even better than either. If I can get any more, I am eager to try this again SOON!"
""
""
""
"O- Well i'm definitely a fan. I think 60 > 75 > 90 and i'll be trying and reviewing a 120 soon! 75 Minute is greatly balanced and very delicious. A little more nose and i'd put it up there with 60 minute."
"O: While I am glad I tried this one, I won't go back and will look for 90 Minute IPA when I need a DFH IPA fix. I am not a fan of 60 Minute IPA at all (too herbal, grassy) so I was glad that I enjoyed this, but I won't go back to this guy in the future. Still, worth a shot as it is very unique."
"Mouthfeel is good- medium body with moderate carbonation. This is certainly a strange one. Disappointed because of the smell- perhaps something went wrong this time?"
""
""
"O- good beer, but nothing I would seek out again."
""
"D - It's 90 minute with more finesse and control over the flavor. I can't imagine how this would age, as maple syrup seems to drop off far too quickly in other beers, yet the bottle conditioning somewhat supports cellaring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An interesting beer, overall, though somewhat simple. It'd be nice to have more depth of hop flavors and aromas. It's not as good as fresh 90 Minute, but it's still a decent beer."
""
"Overall I really like this offering from Dogfish Head; first one in a while to be honest. Their recent larger format series bottles have been a disappointment in my opinion. I wish the $ tag was a little friendlier and it came in a 6 or 4 pack like the 60 & 90 min, but good none the less. Glad I picked up more than one because this beer has been flying off shelves everywhere I have seen it so get it while you can."
""
""
"O: A light and refreshing ipa, not as heavy in the nose or flavor as I would have liked, but drinkability makes up for it"
"Very interesting take. Higher than 60 but lower than 90 as far as ABV is concerned. Highly drinkable though!"
""
"Overall pretty good but not something I would get again."
"Hazy golden amber with a huge, foamy white head. Fresh floral hops, citrus, and grains with some sharp pine notes. Big fresh, bitter hop kick with syrupy sweetness on the first sip. Lots of smooth, lovely spices. Cirtusy, mildly malty body with a bold hoppy mouthfeel. Crisp finish."
"O - This beer definitely has the DFH signature ""funk"" about it, but it's not what you would expect (a hybrid of 60 & 90 minute). By far my favorite of their IPA/DIPA series (120 minute not included...I still don't believe that beer is a DIPA...)."
""
""
""
"Overall, the flavors in this brew are excellent, and again, hop lovers will love this one. The extreme carbonation is distracting, but a good open sit will solve that one. I do wish the maple syrup flavors were a little more present, but there is still enough sugar and malt in here to counterbalance the hops. Great beer."
""
""
""
"O: really great beer for a nice night at the bar. Tastes and feels like a session, but far from it ringing in at around 7.5%"
""
""
""
"For not being the biggest fan of 60 and particularly 90 Minute, I’m pretty impressed by this one. Nice and hoppy, well balanced and the maple syrup adds a nice touch. Good one!"
"O-Wow this is delicious. This ranks up there with hopslam. One of my favorite beers right here. Much better than the half 60/90 mix."
"This was flavorful and a very enjoyable beer that goes down easy and to me is a session beer, but I do like the 90 Minute and Squall IPA’s better as far as flavor goes, yet this seemed to go down extremely fast and easy. Highly recommend trying this for any Dogfish Head IPA fan, and if for nothing else than just for the drinkability alone. Really nice and easy to drink, so grab one and try it."
"Now I'll be honest here, I've never been a fan of 90 minute IPA. It just seemed like a malt bomb, which isn't a bad thing, but I wanted more hops from it, since it's an IPA and all…. With that in mind, I almost didn't buy 75 minute IPA when I heard it was a blend of 60 and 90, but man am I happy I did. This beer is the best of both worlds. It's super hoppy up front, but it maintains a great malt body, and the maple syrup addition is genius."
"O: A winner in my book from DFH, I am definitely interested to see how this one will age. I almost prefer it to the 90 minute if I were to choose a DFH IPA to drink- mainly because it's supposed to have those naturally sweet flavors instead of just popping up in the ""in your face"" IPA."
""
""
"O: this was a bit of a let down, I enjoy 60 and 90 solo more so than this."
"This is a fantastic looking IPA, it's got a hazy yellow-orange body with a high level of visible carbonation and a massive head. Lacing and retention are exceptional. The aroma is great, the dry-hopping really pops providing a great hop experience on the nose. The taste isn't quite as inviting as the taste, but it's still an enjoyable experience. The maple syrup really rounds out the taste, hiding any sharp edges that the hops might have otherwise presented. Very balanced. The mouthfeel is fantastic, it's got a relatively heavy body, but has the perfect level of carbonation to make it go down smoothly. The drinkability is also very good. Overall, I don't like this one quite as much as Squall, which it replaced in DFH's lineup, but 75 Minute is still a very good beer that's worth a try."
"Didn't have it at the pub. Instead I bought another bottle from the pub's store, Liquor Loft. As I get into it I really love it! Ceretainly worth the wait!"
"O - The 75 Minute may be the best IPA in DFH's arsenal. It has amazing moutfeel and is really tasty. I would love to see this become a year-rounder (and to come in 12 oz. bottles). An all-around great beer."
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: I can't speak for the other two member of triple B, but I've never been in love with 60 or 90 minute. But, this 75 combines the best of both worlds. It's brewed with a touch of maple syrup which adds to flavor and feel of this beer. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"o: couldn't get much maple from the aroma and only tasted a bit knowing it had maple going in. nicely drinkable. well balanced. Definitely worth a try but nothing remarkable however."
""
"This is a damn good beer. I like the earthy, smoothness that the maple syrup adds. It's definitely shares the hoppiness of the 60 min with the malt character of the 90 min. It's delicious. It's definitely worth a try."
"O - extremely tight and balanced. achieves what it strives for - a well-rounded DIPA with a mild, but distinct sweetness. flavors are all somewhat delicate and mesh very well together. must if you like hops!"
"Overall I like it better than the 90min or 60min. Glad this is being bottled now. More IPA's should follow suit with adding honey/maple instead of loads of malt."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is substantially full and frothy for an IPA of this alcoholic weight, which was surprising and welcome. Despite all the bubbles, carbonation is evenly tempered throughout. Quite a solid product from Dogfish Head. Glad this made it out of the brewpub and into bottles for distribution."
""
"If you enjoy the 60 and 90 minute, I would definitely recommend trying the 75 minute. You will not be blown away, but you will not be disappointed. The 75 minute might be the most well balanced beer between sweetness and abv of the series."
"Notes - Really an impressive beer, and I'd like more. I appreciate the breadiness and the hop profile, as it retains what I love from the 90 minutes. I do wish there was more on the nose, and the astringency present in the nose never really makes an appearance in regards to taste."
"750 ml bottle, stamp on bottle says bottled in 2012D 14:52. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with a couple inch frothy off-white head. The head stays around a very long time, and there's a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is nice, it smells like citrusy (orange peel, tropical fruit, grapefruit) and pine hops, and caramel and sweet malt. It tastes just like the aroma, like citrusy and pine hops, caramel and sweet malt. I didn't notice any maple when I first started drinking this brew but once I let the beer settle for a while, the maple did become noticeable in both the aroma and flavor (but it wasn't strong at all). Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and slick with high but soft carbonation. I think this is a good overall beer. I have another bottle that I'm going to age for a while to see how it changes. Definitely worth a try at $7.99 a bottle."
"O- Supremely drinkable. As a matter of fact, this reminds me more of a blend of their 60 Minute IPA and Burton Baton. The aroma has that familiar fruity/citrusy/floral bouquet from the former and that biscuit/bready/vanilla quality I found with Burton. Since I am a fan of both, this brew is a dream...I only wish this could be a year-round offering 12oz bottles!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Like I said above, this is an interesting conceit that works well as an ""occasional rarity"" as they call it. Also, while the beer may not be a successful IPA, I personally enjoy the maple / 60min / 90min interplay. Would have again."
""
"O: A step in the right direction for a brewery that, in my humble opion, has lost it's way a bit. Keep making unique, delicious beers like this and I'll keep buying them. The best DFH 750mL release in ages. Well done, Dogfish."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy light golden amber with a clean white three to four finger head. Beautiful lacing present as the head subsides. The aroma of earthy hops and sweet malt dominate. Intially the taste of grassy hops and grain moves to slightly sweet malt and finishes dry with the mildest sweetness and a return to grassy hops. Abundant carbonation and malt backbone translate into a heavier medium body with a slick and satisfying mouthfeel. Just like most DFH brews, a unique and interesting brew which combines some the best aspects of 60 min and 90 min with some new surprises."
""
"Now if I only I could pull off this same taste by just putting half 60 minute and half 90 minutes in a glass."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Founder's tulip. Pours a brilliant but hazy golden straw hue. The head on this thing is voluminous. Even a gentle pour down the side of the glass generated a solid 3-4"" crown of foam that took a while to recede. Lacing is spotty at best, but no matter, this looks great. The nose caught me off guard. I guess when I read it was bottle conditioned with maple syrup added, the syrup was the first thing I looked for. I figured this would be malty and sweet smelling. Au contraire. This is a lovely citrus forward IPA indeed but but the slightest hint of maple. If you weren't looking for the smell, I dare say you wouldn't find it. The taste is awesome. The maple is a tad more apparent here, as is the malt. Still, the citrus on this is awesome, with a touch of pine. The mouth is unreal for an IPA. Fuller than usual, with an almost creamy element to it. Outstanding. There's but a lingering bit of bitterness on the finish. Overall, this is my favorite DFH IPA."
""
"The medium body allows the flavors to really present themselves but never becomes sticky or overly coating. The carbonation seems just right as the beer is held in the mouth. However, as the beer is swallowed, the carbonation causes an excessive foaming that detracts from the experience."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty tasty switch up from the 60 & 90 minute. Mouthfeel is the highlight here with a pretty good flavor."
"Overall the mouthfeel is the most impressive thing to me, and we got a classic hop beer that is truly somewhere in middle ground. Hooray I am happy, glad to have tried this, I thought I would never get the chance. Doesn't taste or feel like any IPA I have ever had, and I enjoy it. Thanks, Sam."
"O: Definitely not a west coast style IPA, pretty heavy malt balances it out evenly. There is of course some level of bitterness but it doesn't stand out like a lot of IPAs. Very drinkable, smooth and not harsh at all."
"O: Pretty self-explanatory and almost exactly as you'd expect. A solid blending of 60 and 90 with real maple taste without the sweetness associated with syrup. Solid beer"
""
"O: Very flavorful and interesting IPA at 7.5% ABV, this drinks like a DIPA with some more depth to it. The perfect balance of brash, grassy and citrusy hop notes you get with 60 Minute IPA melded with the smooth, bready drinknability of 90 Minute IPA. The maple and natural carbonation add dimensions that have me running to the store for another or to Rehoboth Beach, Del. ASAP."
""
""
"Very impressed by my first taste of 75 w/maple. Better this than mixing the two together. Recommended. 4.0"
"O - Glad to have finally tried this beer. This has all the pros of 60 and 90 minute. Piney and sweet with a nice maple finish. I liked this beer a lot. If it were in 4/6 packs I would probably never buy their other IPA's again."
""
""
""
""
"Hop forward but there are other things coming from the malt and yeast. You can taste both beers here and it is pretty cool, especially since they are the best DFH beers IMO."
""
"O: All in all, this is a good beer to try if you like DFH and want to try and interesting blend on their IPA's. It's an IPA that has a lot of syrupy sweetness too it the follows along with the hop bite."
""
""
"overall: DFH is known for extremes. A little surprised the maple isn't more in your face. I'd like a little more in the mix."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'm a little disappointed. I'll think I'll stick with 60 minute as my Dogfish drink of choice."
"Overall - A fine beer overall. Sometimes DFH gets criticized for going ""out there"" on beers, but they can make a solid IPA, and this is no exception. Perhaps my favorite between this, 60 and 90. Well done brew."
"A nice one."
""
""
"D: I've had this beer on cask a while back and loved it. Well it didn't disappoint my memory, it is a solid beer. Very well balanced and very drinkable."
""
""
""
"O-A wonderful beer, except the carbonation. The beer was too carbonated, cutting back on the carbonation would greatly increase the awesomeness of this brew."
"O- Not a bad beer but the combination of 60 and 90 Minute IPA pale in comparison to either beer."
"I will not hesitate to get this in the future. If you can put your hands to some, don't hesitate to get it and drink it. Well worth the relatively high price tag."
""
"This is really good, great balance of flavors and hops with a perfect body that leaves it very drinkable and easy to enjoy. Mixes good traits of both the 60 and the 90 but also is a beer all its own with the maple. Definitely grab this one if you see it."
"Overall - This is an awesome beer, really awesome."
""
"How long can you age this beer? Bottle conditioned and apparently ageable. Might just do so!"
"Low carbonation as expected. Light-bodied. Glad to have finally tried this."
""
"In the meantime, sip and enjoy."
"Overall this beer is fantastic, a new favorite of mine. Even if you do not like IPA's, it is worth a try. I live in Delaware and have easy, tax free access to these brews but I try my best not too be too subjective or biased. Nice brew!"
"I think this is one of the better DFH apecials to come out in a while if for no other reason than it's a mixture of 2 excellent beers. The taste really gets great as it warms and the syrup starts to come out."
""
"Taste:"
""
"Smooth feel, could have just a bit more fizz. Full body. Overall, I like this much better than the cask pour- but some of that could also be the temp, as the cask pour last year was slightly warmer, and this brew is better on the cooler side. Very good!! Plus I now have another empty for my DFH bottle collection."
"O- I've been waiting to try this one for a long time. Overly carbonated, but delicious none-the-less. Lots of citrus, and a touch of syrup. Coulda been better, but it was a really nice drinker over all."
"O/D-Overall, this beer blew me away. It is probably my favorite DFH brew (60 minute is its only real competition). I am happy I gave this a shot. This is a premium IPA. I truly love this one."
"a really nice balanced, drinkable IPA. i can definatly get both 60 and 90 minute. awesome, i want more..."
"O- Good beer worth getting again. I feel that Squall was better and wish this didn't replace it. Definitely will be trying to find this on cask."
"M: Medium bodied, strange pillow-like mouthfeel."
"Definitely worth a try and is recommended."
""
""
""
"O: This is a beer that sets the bar in my mind for IPAs. It's hoppy, it's got a subtle, yet supremely delicious malt profile, it's got an out-of-left-field quality with the maple syrup that I think sets it apart from other IPAs. It's not an IIPA but the appearance tells me otherwise. The ABV is a perfect 7.5%...just high enough to get me moving, and yet low enough to not worry about finishing the bomber on my own. Bravo, Sam et al. at DFH. You have yet another masterpiece although I'm still bummed you axed Squall..."
"O: This is quite a nice one. I think I still prefer the 90, but 75 is definitely worthy to try."
"Aroma: Eclectic malts, hops, with a sweet brown sugar undertone. Very pleasant. Poured a filtered rich amber with a weak head but persistent lacing. Taste: strong hops with a flash of bitterness that lingers nicely on the rear palate; ripe bananas and sugar -- I'm hitting on that maple syrup flavor here. Rich medium body with good viscosity. Carbonation is well balanced and alcohol present but not overwhelming. Excellent drinkibility - goes down smooth. Another memorable IPA from Dogfish. Will definitely indulge again!"
"O: Definitely prefer the original in cask form. Stoked to see it in bottles, but probably won't have in again this way. Still top notch though and comes recommended."
""
""
"Pours a glowing golden amber with low carbonation and ample suspended sediment. Airy, white head with nice retention and abundant dots of lace. Mild, weak aroma of trace maple and light pine; mildly soapy and and boozy. Flavor is less horrible than the aroma with hops taking a more dominant role and maple only adding a mild sweetness to the finish and slick texture to the body. Dry throughout the body, with pine hops and light bready malt body hiding behind the bitterness. More of an amped up 60 Min than a watered down 90 Min. Maple is a failure on the aroma, but subtlety in the flavor adds an unexpected pleasant balance and depth to the flavor. Didn't pick up the notes of dog shit that Thorpe found in this beer (and a few others tonight) but he just must have been getting too familiar with Bruce's functions tonight."
""
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This was an enjoyable beer that was easily drinkable. Its family heritage is obvious from the first sniff and the first sip. My overall impression is that if you like either of the two parent beers (the 60 min or the 90 min) this is worth a try. That said I’ll not go out of my way to have this one again. It’s a good beer and definitely an “in-between” beer but I never felt the need of an “in-between” beer and don’t know that this one has convinced me."
""
""
"Overall: As the bottle says sometimes 90 is too much and 60 is too little. In my opinion, 75 Minute IPA takes the best qualities of its two component beers. I'd still like to get down to Rehoboth and try it from the cask."
""
""
"Medium body, milder carbonation, creamy and slick on the tongue, very easy drinking. This is pretty nice, I enjoyed the cask effect although I felt the nose was pretty muted."
""
""
""
""
"Pours WAAAY too foamy... not sure if this'll be a widespread issues or if the bottles were so recently taken off the truck that they were still showing signs of having been jostled in some way. The smell and taste aren't quite on par with the cask version, but there is some nice dank hop flavor with a lovely note of maple on the back end - this beer is better than 60 and 90 Minute, for sure. Could be a lot less carbonated and have a bit less of a carbonation bite in the mouthfeel, but we'll see how a couple months in my fridge affect the other bottle."
""

"On cask last night at Sunset in Allston. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark orange color, with a slightly murky body. Not much head, but some lacing. Smell had a pine-like and citrus aroma. Not overly impressive to look at or to smell. Taste was hoppy, but mellow, which is what I like. The cask conditioning really smoothed out the edges here, and left a quite approachable IPA in my glass. Mouthfeel was on the thin side but still very drinkable. This was the first time I've had this since the big debut night a few years back, and it's still a nice treat to see on cask now and then. Helped me wash down a bacon burger and fries."
""
"This is one seriously good beer. Enough to make you want to visit RB, even without any other DFH offerings."

"Not worth the hype, but then I'm not an IPA person, so I pose again, what do I know?"

"dark amber copper in color, with thin white head of tiny fine bubbles. aroma is sweet - malt and orange citrus. taste is very well balanced between the malt and hops. extremely smooth body and soft carbonation typical of the cask treatment. very tasty."
"D: [DRINKABILITY] You could lose an afternoon or two throwing this one back. Top notch drinkability - and I think the cask serving has something to do with it."

"not sure if its always like this, but i had it casked with maple syrup at the taproom on the beach. poured a relatively flat looking amber color. smell was sweet and hoppy, more like the 90 minute, but with definite maple sugar notes and some mild woody vibes from the cask conditioning. taste is identical, light hints of maple, nothing overpowering at all. mouthfeel is less flat than the appearance, actually quite lively, with a sticky icky hop body, drinkable though. nice beer, wouldnt have 5 of them"
"Overall, a good brew, but I still prefer 60 minute."

"Poured a slightly hazy brilliant orange with a dense, creamy ivory head that settles to a pillowy cap, leaving lots of sticky lacing. Nice aromas of sweet caramel malt and pungent pine resin and grapefruit hops. Typical DFH IPA aromas, but very fresh. Getting just a whisper of maple syrup from the bottle conditioning. Taste is...60 Minute meets 90 Minute (duh). Sweet caramel malt, pine and grapefruit hops, and a touch of the signature DFH yeast. Expertly combined the drinkability of 60 with the hops of 90. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a medium body and solidly crisp carbonation. Just a great beer that combined 2 old favorites, can't wait to see this in bottles!"
"Going to the DFH Pub for the first time, this one was a must-get and I wasn't disappointed at all... one of the best beers I've ever laid my lips on. The super hoppiness of the 60/90 minute IPA's, but balanced with some nice caramel syrup to give it a great mouthfeel. This beer's flavor is delicious and goes down way too easy, would definitely go back there just for another pint of this!"

"amber with a frothy white/creamy head and some decent lacing. Smell was a citrus hops, mixed with a malty caramel thta makes this smell quite balanced. Taste was definatly hoppy, and again had that bit of caramel, and some spiceness about it. Very nice dry finish and not overpowering on the hops. This is a good session beer and will definatly have more."

"Unlike many IPAs this one holds up really well off the firkin."
"Overall, this is my favorite minute IPA from DFH. As I said before, it takes the best parts of 60 and 90 and makes them better. I'll seek this out again."
"From bottle to pint glass. good color and lacing. Good nose. Piney and citrus. The taste is really nice, very Dogfish. Good mouthfeel and carbonation. Overall, just about what you would expect from a Dogfish crafted ale. With the success of the minute ipas this one was a natural."
"Smooth, delicious, wonderous. A must try."
"O -- I don't typically enjoy cask conditioned beers, but the servers recommended this. Out of all the beers I've had at the alehouse, this has been the most surprising and enjoyable. The beer is incredibly smooth and the hop and fresh grain/bread flavors are clean. Great if you need a break from the bigger hoppy beers (but still want those hops!), and capable of displaying the awesome flavors of fresh ingredients that will keep people drinking. Definitely would have again (and again)!"
"O: Out of their very large and often zany line-up 75 Minute certainly stands out from the rest. I'd say its one of their best and most grounded ales they make. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance, even if you aren't usually a Dogfish fan."
"M: The mouthfeel elicits both hops and malts, the cask lending more strength to the malt side. Still good though, a drinkable cask offering."
"Had this at the brewpub in Rehoboth. I was excited to give this one a try, as it was probably my only chance to have it. Looks a little cloudy compared to the 60 minute and 90 minute. Not a strong smell coming off of this one. Taste is good. Slight citrus bitterness with some sweet malt from the 90 minute, I'm guessing. The mouthfeel is where the real difference is. Very creamy. This one went down pretty quickly. Solid, but I like both the 60 and 90 minutes better seperately."
"Overall: As a mix between the 60 and 90 minute IPA's, this demonstrates characteristics of both. Since I enjoy 90 minute and think 60 minute is just so-so, this falls somewhere in between."
"must say that it poured rather pungent for a cask brew. had a very long and deep finish of a well bitter IPA with a bit more definition. something about the abv was slightly off... a bit boozy. would have figured that would have smoothened out in the cask. pour was orange with a nice big head. very sticky. nose of orange citrus and flowers... brisk and fruit palate and a nice deep bitter. makes the 60 seem rather lean when set side by side."
"Intensely bitter where it needs to be, meaning throughout the whole taste. It truly is like a slightly jacked up version of 60 minute or a toned down version of 90 minute, which of course makes sense. Strong bitterness comes from pine and citrus hops that balance out perfectly with the light maltiness. No resin, so its clean and refreshing, with a clean mouthfeel. Finishes fairly dry, and slightly gritty, adding to the overall intensity. If you like 60 and 90 then be sure to make it down to one of their restaurants and check it out."
"O - I wanted to be at the brewpub on Thursday just so I could have this...and it did not disappoint! A great blend of the 60 and 90 Minutes...this is my favorite of the ""Minute"" gang"
"I highly recommend trying this special edition 75 Minuet IPA to anyone who is lucky enough to stop into DFH Brewings and Eats while the beer is still available. I happened to order the indulgence burger, and this beer complimented it very well. I found this odd as I usually expect strong IPA’s to pair with a more spicy fare."
"O - interesting, but a bit on the small side in all respects."
"D: Another wonderful creation from Dogfish Head and the combination of generous hops and maple syrup works even better than I thought it would. Easy to drink and very flavorful this goes down great as a cask ale!"
"Overall a great experience and I'm happy I'm here. A reason to come back!"
"Pretty easy drinking, although with temperatures in the 90's at Rehoboth it was hard to pass on the fresh Festina Peche. Great beer for the fall or spring."
"Don't drink and review."
"Cheers"
"Overall: this is a beer you can have several pints of despite the higher alcohol levels. Nice flavors and since this was very fresh, it created a very pleasurable drinking experience."
"O: Easily one of my favorite beers, especially on cask, making it nice and creamy. It is not as sweet as 90 and hoppier than 60. Extremely easy drinking, and my go to beer when I am at DFH."
"A rare brew when I first had it in 2009, with DFH only sending out a few firkins locally. Tentatively nicknamed ""Johnny Cask."" It's a blend of the 60 and 90 Minute IPAs, and cask-aged with a touch of maple syrup. Hazy copper pour with a moderate white head. Solid hop aroma consistent with the 60&90 Minute profiles. Tasty for sure, citrus hops, caramel malt backbone, but if there was maple syrup in it, I couldn't taste it at all...probably just gets lost in the mix with the malts. All in all, it really just tasted very similar to the 90 Min. Which is still a good thing, but I feel it lacks in uniqueness. Medium body, and easily drinkable much like its constituents. Very good brew overall."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall it was an excellent beer. It was a great balance between the 60 and 90 and is my favorite out of them. Great middle ground between the two beers and it fits my tastes better than each of them individually. A very nice beer to start out the meal with."
"Had at the Washington Street Alehouse in Wilmington, poured from a beer engine and served at cask temperature. Aromas muted due to the low level of carbonation (light malt/hop). Hazy dark yellow with a medium head that faded. Hop flavor muted, malt backbone prominent, for an IPA it was balanced (serving from cask really muted the hop character). Perfectly good beer, but not the best for serving on cask IMHO."
"O: Very drinkable and flavorfull, with a elevated but not overpowering alchohol content."
"O - Not a winner for me on-cask. Too sweet and not enough carbonation."
"Johnny Cask, I was dying to try this at the brew pub and I had finally got my chance. This brew is a 7.5abv blend of the 90 and 60 minute IPA. The beer has a really soft quality to it. A pretty good foamy head that laces the glass fairly well. The color is a foggy copper tone. The aroma is a great it just spews hops. It's a really great IPA that's cask aged. Little Carbonation in it but it's got enough of a bitterness that it doesn't really need the bubbles."
"O - As stated in some other reviews if you like the 60 Min IPA and enjoy the 90 Min IPA but often steer clear of the 90, this one is perfect for you. This one has all the developed IPA flavors but without the punch of alcohol or heft on the palate. This is a good session-able IPA for me. Though, I have a feeling that this too would sneak up on me even at 7.5%. I'd order again whenever I'm at the Alehouse or at the Rehoboth brew pub."
"o - Overall another nice IPA from DFH; if you like 60 and 90 minute, you'll like this one. I liked it more than 60 minute and about on par with 90 minute. Some nice pine hops jump out the most in the smell, and the taste wasn't too bitter. Would certainly order it again and wish they bottled it."
"I like the effort here (and would even try this again on draft) but the maple syrup addition just puts the sweetness of this over the top for me. This was just a bit too cloying for my taste but I could see how some others might like it."
"O - I enjoyed this more than the 90 Min., but it still ends up being cloyingly sweet, with a huge malt presence that the hops cannot balance."
"O- A great cask ale. The brewer designed it to be in between two of it's biggest sellers and they nailed it."
"The CPJ"
"On cask at the brewpub in Rehoboth. Pours a translucent light brown with a few inches of head. Some thick lacing. Aroma is of citrus hops. Mostly grapefruit. A slight bit of oak as well. Taste is a light grapefruit hoppiness along with some warming alcohol flavor. Some oakiness along with maple syrup. Somewhat bitter. Very creamy mouthfeel. This does taste like a mix between a 60 and a 90 min. This was the best of the brewpub exclusives."
"I'm not a massive Dogfish fan, but its hard not to follow what they do and this is one I've been looking forward to trying - mostly because I love a good ""real ale"". This doesn't disappoint! It can be real tough to find a well-excecuted cask beer (it takes a great brewery, great handling, and a great bar). This was done right. Not cold, but certainly not warm. Not fizzy, but not flat. Makes for incredible drinkability and mouthfeel."
"After my first beer I asked the bartender what the deal was with the sweet flavor, then he informed me that they had added maple syrup. Aha! Interesting."
"Being a fan of DFH in general, I love the IPAs. I'm not going to say that they are the best IPAs in the world because I know there are better but the 75 minute IPA is better than both the 60 and the 90 minute individually. I commented to my wife that it was rather stupid that they don't bottle this one. It's medium to light in body and pretty hoppy on the finish but without an aftertaste, the midpalate is populated with grapefruit and mild pine flavors. I really enjoyed it and would do it again. I wonder if the home version is as good. I should set up a tasting of 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 and 90 minute IPA to see what is the best blend."
"Fairly Easy to drink....but I only had one."
"Overall a very unusual ipa totally different than 60 and 90 min with lots of oak and maple notes. The low carbonation and and cask conditioning make it a delicious treat. It was the best beer of the night in my visit to the DFH brewpub."
"D - I'm all set after a pint of this but the flavors are spot-on and I'd definitely order it again."
"Poured on tap at DFH Alehouse into a pint glass. Pours a light orange amber color with an off white foam head. Has an aroma of grapefruit and pine with a slight hint of caramel. Brew is poured from the cask at near room temperature and is very smooth. The bitters are more subtle and smooth than its 90 minute bretheren. You get notes of the roasty caramel malts in this brew as well. Very good. I would put this a pinch above 90, and close but short of Squall. Usually order this with my dinner if there are no other better options (e.g., world wide stout, Squall, 90 minute, Immort Ale, etc.)"
"Mouthfeel was great, lots of body and it drank wonderfully, not to much ABV for me, perfect!"
"DFH 75 min IPA is an incredibly drinkable, well hopped IPA. I would choose this beer over the 60 min any day. As far as I know it's draft only. Too bad, because I'd have a sixer standing by all the time..."
"D - Easy drinking. Could easily have several in a single sitting"
"overall, great beer...had it at the Gaithersburg Dog Fish Head Alehouse, i would definitely order this again"
"Drinkability: Good but not great. The sweetness gets tiresome after a while. Glad I tried, but wouldn't session or drink often."
"D: Both the 60 and 90 are two distinctly different beers for sure. This is an interesting experiment and I'm glad DFH offers this option."
"Pint glass, pours a cloudy copper-orange, no head, no lacing, almost no carbonation, served about 45ºF. Slight aroma of grapefruit, pine and hops, heavy aroma of apricots. Taste has a fantastic balance between apricots and hops. No maple syrup was noticeable, but certainly added a sweetness to the beer that brings out the flavor of apricots. Medium-bodied and mouthy feel. This beer was a delight to drink. Compared to 60-minute, it was sweeter, and the hop flavor was not as prominent. I really enjoyed the lack of carbonation on this beer. I think my rating on this beer was a little high, as it is a unique beer and tough to find on tap."
"Bitter and sweet fight for dominance yet end in blissful harmony for a wonderful mouthfeel. Sweet apricot and maple balanced by a bitter oak and citrus bite - very nice."
"D: Extremely easy to put a hold bunch of this down, and definitely the best dogfish IPA out there because of the freshness aspect and how nicely it is balanced"
"I first got to try this beer at Lupulin Slam I, and I don't recall the beer being this good. Granted, that was several years ago, but this is really a very nice IPA from DFH. Also, this is one IPA where I think the cask conditioning has improved the beer. Very impressive."
"D: Second time I've had this beer and both times have been enjoyable. Very delicious beer. Hope it makes it way here again"
"Aftertaste is hops with a touch of malt/maple."
"D. A heck of a lot more balanced than I expected. The maple brings the sweetness and body up, but doesn't add much to the flavor or nose. If I ever see this again I'll be sure to grab a pint or two. Try it if you can."
"Pours deep copper with a small, lively head. The aroma is rich and woody, with a chocolatey, chicory bite. The flavor is woody, musty, and coffelike, with a cinnamony spice on the finish. There is a tight, woody bitterness on the finish, with a little milky sweetness. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich. B the flavor changes dramatically with food, becoming smoother and maltier."
"Drinkability: Glad I got to try this. A very nice change from the usual 60 minute and occasional 90 minute from Dogfish. I would definitely have this again if I have the chance."
"Smooth as hell, this beer hides the alcohol well. I wish that the hops were a bit more potent though."
"No cask 75 in Va, just blended at the tap by the local bartender. Pours a nice amber color with a frothy head which dissipates quickly. Smells sweet like the 90 with a nice piney hop from the fresh 60. Taste is full bodied with a great hop complexity shifting from piney, resiny, citrusy, and floral hops. Definitely an 85."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, not as chewy, or resinous that I get in the 90 minute but maybe it's just me."
"However, I drank this sucker pretty darn fast. I couldn't help myself. Yeah, I'd say it's drinkable."
"Note: Served from growler that was filled from a cask."
"Incredibly smooth drinking and perfectly balanced. One of the best beers I have ever tried. Could drink all night. I really don't taste how this is a blend of the 60 and 90 minute, there must be some kind of magic at work in there."
"Happy to find this at my newest ""local"" Birdsall House in Peekskill, NY. Pours murky/clouded, dull darker/chocolaty amber. The head is loose and minor with not much lace/sheeting to get excited about. Interesting brew, love both the 60 min and 90 min, so how could I go wrong here. Hopped up with ample malt. Super smooth over the tongue. Very enjoyable AIPA, mass produced this would be a sure big seller."
"The beer is darker in color than the 60 or 90, a dark red orange color. It is not as carbonated and I found it not quite as fragrant either. However this leads to a very pleasantly drinkable beer. It has a very soft and creamy mouthfeel, has a larger head and better lacing than the 60 minute. Still very flavorful and flowery. The hop flavor comes forward more than the bitter citrus notes that are prevalent in the 90 minute. Additionally, this beer is sweeter in a floral sort of way over the 60 or 90 minute."
"Pours a cloudy, muddy amber brown color, with nonexistant head. Smell is of fresh hops and sweet malts, with a carmel covered nut like scent. First taste if of the citrusy, piney and bitter hops, moving into a mellow sweet carmel molasses like taste... hints of raosted nuts as the big flavors clear. Heavy body, yet smooth cask beer feel on the palate, little sweet and bitter aftertastes. Decent beer, worth a try but nothing earth shattering."
"Pours amber in body with a creamy, white fluff head that lasts. Aroma of grapefruit, wet grass, citrus with rind, juice. Flavors of citrus, grapefruit, thick syrupy malt, wet grass, biscuit, and a tad of vanilla with big bitterness. Incredibly smooth and thick in body, almost no carbonation. Heavy in body with great warming characteristics. This is my favorite DFH offering, an experience you have to take part in."
"Served up a slightly hazy copper amber with parchment head. Great head retention and average lacing. Aroma is of citrusy American hops and caramel malt with a touch of earthiness. Mmm, I love 60, I love 90 and I love cask beer. This is a match made in heaven. Grapefruit, floral hops and nice biscuit malt combine with caramel and brown sugar notes in a super smooth glass of IPA heaven. It is really interesting how the two beers combined create something totally different. Maltier than 60, but seemingly has more hop presence than 90. Superbly balanced. As mentioned before the mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth with subdued carbonation. Medium bodied, but served up on cask I could suck these down all night. Highly recommended."
"Pours a clear amber color with a nice tight head which gives way to nice lacing the whole way down the glass. The aroma is of caramel malts with some brown sugar as well as a little citrus and earthy hops. The taste is fantastic it starts off with a caramel malt and sweet malt taste with hints of brown sugar sweetness. After the malt taste a nice citrus and earthy hop taste takes over. It is like a perfect combination of the 90 min and the 60 min. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. The drinkability is also fantastic you could easily drink these all night and continue to want more. There is more than enough flavor to keep you interested with nothing to dislike."
"Pours an clear amber straw with about a finger-and-a-half of creamy white head that laces quite well. The aroma is full of hops, mostly piny but with a nice bit of citrus and bitterness lying underneath. The taste follows, with those hops providing a boost of pine, bitterness and citrus (in descending order). A slight honey-like sweetness is subtly perceptible. The body is fairly moderate and runs quite smoothly, allowing for a pretty drinkable brew (especially if you're into hops...)."
"I usually tend to think of beer blends as gimmicks but 75 Minute IPA has changed my mind on that notion. This beer combines of sweetness and complexities of Dogfish Heads's 90 Minute IPA with the pure hoppiness and drinkability of their 60 Minute IPA. I cannot wait for this one to be bottled."
"It has a very smooth hoppy taste at first followed by a bit of sourness. It says there's maple mixed in, which probably gives it its strong sweetness. It also says that it's a blend of the 60 and 90 minute IPAs...so there no wonder why I love this beer."
"I usually have one or glasses from a cask and then move on. I could drink from this all night."
"Overall I'm glad I finally came across this beer, and a cask version nonetheless. Hoppier than one would expect and worth a shot."
"This was overall, an easy to drink, good but not especially ""off-centered""."
"D - Very drinkable IPA that really does well with the cask conditioning. The flavors jump right out of the glass with this beer. Very complex but not too overpowering. I could definitely session this beer."
"I am going to put that this was brewed once as I have no idea. If someone needs to change that, please feel free."
"Insanely drinkable I'm craving another"
"Last time I visited rehoboth Dogfish ran out of 75 minute Johnny Cask within 24 hours and I was unable to try it... Luckily, this past weekend I had 2 pints of this elixir and it was quite amazing.. Pour has an amazing cascading fall in the glass and it is amazing.. almost like when you see nitro stout like guinness fall.. its really incredible and foams into a huge frothy head. Aroma is hoppy and sweet though kind of light. Flavor has an interesting mix between the floral hoppiness of 60 minute with the sweet, sugary backbone of 90 minute. Cream soda-like. Quite interestingly complex. Mouth is silky and velvety.. very smooth and creamy. Amazing. All around it is absolutely delicious and the mouthfeel is exceptional. Could be a bit tough to drink more than one as it feels a bit heavy when sipping. A must try."
"Drinkability: This could be one of the best Dogfish Head beers I've had to date. I'm glad I had the chance to try it, and would always buy it if available."
"NOTES: I'm typically not an IPA fan, but this beer could make me an IPA fan yet!!"
"Overall this is super drinkable and one of DFHs best IPAs, worth seeking out!"
"Served from the first cask of 75 min IPA in Maine; poured into my Uprising Chalice. Pours a rusty orange color with a slight head of small white bubbles. Aroma is full of subtle hops. It doesn't overpower, but it is still quite strong. The taste is great. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be, but the hops are still there. You can also certainly taste the maple syrup that was added to the cask. As expected, there is low carbonation; also has a light body. This is incredibly drinkable. You could keep ordering these all night long. Very enjoyable. If a cask is tapped in your area, it is worth seeking out."
"It came with two thick, foamy fingers of eggnog colored head with fantastic retention. Color was a slightly deeper amber than the 60", but still with a fantastic NE-quality clarity. Nose was floral, piney, more in line with what I like in an IPA. Mouthfeel was slightly fuller than the 60"" and more malty at the same time. Actually, it felt like there was a power struggle going on atop my palate betwixt the malt and the hops with neither gaining the upper hand. It was on the finish that the hops became truly assertive. I got a spearmint flavor that lingered. It was not Life Savers or chewing gum prevalent, but it was definitely spearmint. It triggered a memory but I could not quite dredge it up - I used to know which hops strain imparts that flavor, but it simply eluded me. An excellent beer, highly recommended, especially on cask!"
"This is one of my favorite IPAs. I tasted this a while back and it was unbelievably good. I will skip the look of the beer and focus on the hop to malt to maple syrup ratio. Sweet, floral, spicy, and rounded out by the maple - it is really something! Citrus hops with floral characteristics meet the toasted malts and are enveloped by maple. Need I say more? The maple syrup is from Sam's father's farm in Mass."
"I had this several times at Rehoboth Brew Pub. I think that people who have left less than stellar reviews haven't had the best batch or the bar didn't handle it properly. Everytime I've had it at the Brewpub it has been stellar!"
"On-cask at the brewpub. Mmm. Delicious. This is certainly my favorite of DFH's IPA series. And while it's just a mix of the 60 and 90 minute, I don't think it really tastes like either. It lacked the dry biscuit malt of the 60 and had much softer fruitier hops than the 90. The flavor started with a mild earthy note followed by a long-lasting taste of apricot, then lemon rind, and pepper with grapefruit and a vague citrus punch in the background. The aroma was a bit more floral with a hint of that biscuit aroma. Overall it was very tasty and very drinkable. Check this out."
"D - This IPA combines the drinkability of 60min. with the aggressive hop character of 90min. but minus the latter's alcohol presence. Very nice cask offering from DFH."
"A great beer I will enjoy next time its available."
"Note: this review was from the original simulcast release even at monk's."
"becomes more drinkable as the beer warms and that burnt rubber taste fades and the hops step in....not sure how necessary the maple syrup is to this concoction, but i'd like to see if that rubber taste is there or not if the syrup isn't added to the cask...good balance of hops as expected from the 60 Min/90 Min combo"
"I think I preferred the on-tap version. It could have been toward the end of the cask though."
"smooth, light syrup feel, with touch of resins in the finish. light but tight carbonation."
"D: Incredible--much, much better than either two of its component parts. I'll be blending quite a few of these at home for myself in the future."
"D: This is, hands down, one of my favorite I.P.A.'s."
"Drinkability: Very high - could definitely have a few of these in an evening without feeling overpowered."
"This was the first cask offering I have ever had from Dogfish. I hope it isn't the last. This brew reminded me of the 90 min. with the randal. This was maybe a little smoother."
"D: I wish this was available regularly. This was excellent, and the event as a whole was a lot of fun as well."
"It was very smooth and somewhat creamy. A bit on the sweet side, but nicely balanced, a very nice beer, i would love to have again."
"D- Very drinkable and I would like to try a non maple syrup induced version to compare. I wonder if this is 7.5%, from what I drank it's in the ball park for sure. Again not as hoppy as expected which was is a nice change of pace, at least for me. Good stuff all around."
"D- very drinkable"
"Amazing brew one of the best that dogfish head has to offer IMO. Moreso that the 60 min and 90 min. My wife and I got there just in time when they just tapped it. When we ordered the second time our last two there was so much white sediment at the bottom of the glass it was pourely of hops. IT was great and we found out the keg was kicked when I returned with our drinks."
"I overheard that the cask kicked in 22 minutes. Good job, people! I hope they do a 120/WWS cask in the future."
"D: Wonderfully drinkable. I'd drink this over and over (and I do, every time I go to a DFH Alehouse)."
"Anxious for the Fairfax, VA DFH Alehouse this spring !!"
"Drinkability- Very good."
"This was good, but not as good as the 90 is alone. Perhaps better than the 60 alone, but sort of a jack of 2 trades master of none thing going on."
"Nothing wowed me about this beer. I do like it better than the 60 and it is far more quaffable than the 90. It would be worth a try if you happen to hit up one of the Alehouses or their brewpub."
"Drinkability: The balance between the finer attributes of the 60 and 90 minutes provides a nice blend that drinks very nicely indeed (the bottled version with maple adds a bit of maple sweetness on the finish)"
"I'm basically going to agree with everyone else on this one. Had it at the Falls Church DFH Alehouse, basically cause I'd tried everything else and the prospect of mixing two of my favorite IPAs (60 & 90) seemed like a good bet. And it was. Basically it tastes and smells exactly like you would expect, based on the idea. Delicious fruity hops and a solid malt backbone. Obviously, not as syrupy as the 90, but medium to full bodied and tasty. Seriously could drink this one forever."
"I had this on-tap at the Falls Church, VA Alehouse. Man, this is one drinkable blend of beers. It filled the glass as an amber colored brew with an off-white head. Nice lacing clung to the glass. The aroma was a very nice blend of the piney hops noticed in the 60 Min. and the sweetness of the malts from the 90 Min. The flavor was even better. Nice and hoppy without the sweetness that normally starts to get to me when I drink a few of the 90 Minutes. Solid mouthfeel. Nice oily coating on my tongue. Very, very easy to drink. This is one I will duplicate at home."
"Awesome brew.."
"Poured a clear amber color, deeper than the 60 minute, but lighter than the 90 minute with good off-white head, good lacing. Smells of grass, citrus, and sweet caramel. Taste is of grassy hops up front with a nice firm malty sweet backbone and a grapefruit and warming alcohol finish. Medium body with good carbonation, smooth yet crisp with bite, good balance. Easy to drink, a nice middle beer if you don't want the higher ABV of the 90."
"7.5%"
"Drinkability: Very high. While I still prefer the 90 minute, this is a wonderful beer and definitely worth a try at one of the Alehouses."
"This is probably the cheapest but most powerful brew that the Alehouse has. A whole pint for 5 bucks of two of the best IPA's mixed. Very drinkable."
"Alehouse 75 according to the menu at The Dogfishead Alehouse in Gaithersburg, but we all know what it is. The 90 min and 60 min blended for a delicious brew. Appears a golden amber with a touch of red. More head than any of my other dogfish pours and lacing that stuck throughout. Much more subdued nose than I expected. Hints of citrus, floral and of course some piney hops. Taste packed a punch and made up for any lack of scent. Very citrusy with grapefruit rind and a nice bite from hops. Nothing overpowers on its own but all the flavors present themself at once making for strength in numbers flavor. Finishes a tad dry and bitter, perfect carbonation and deliciously crisp, much to my delight. Drinkability is scary. Next time Im bringing the whole gang for happy hour and making a night off of three dollar pints of 75 mins. Wish I could snag a growler somehow but Im working on it ;-)"
"The drinkability is very good. toned down a bit you can have this brew anytime. I would get it again easy. Prosit, MK"
"Had this on tap at the Gaithersburg Alehouse. It is a 50/50 mix of the 90 minute and the 60 minute, although it appeared to be more like 70/30 when the bartender poured it (not that I'd complain!). It pours a light amber reddish color with a white head. It has a very strong piney aroma and the flavor matches. The hop bitterness is balanced by the strong residual sweetness of the 90 minute. It is fairly light bodied for the flavor but very drinkable overall."
"Easy to swallow and quick to finish a pint...all I can say is IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!"
"Drinkability/Notes: A nice surprise to see this on tap. A nice go between for the 60 and 90 Minute IPA's. More hoppy than the 60 minute and a little more fruity but not as fruity or hoppy as the 90 minute. I really liked it, a real nice IPA with plenty of hops and just the right amount of fruity sweetness for me. At 7.5% abv, alchohol was well hidden in the flavor profile for you could feel its warming effects. Wish this one was bottled to go with the ""Minute"" line of IPA's. If you see this on draft, definitely give it a try, its well worth it. Definitely recommended. Another fine ale from the folks at DFH."
"Other: Created especially for the Lupulin Slam, this is a 7 barrel batch of beer that mixes essentially equal portions of 60 and 90 Minute IPA together, plus a crapload of hops, among which were Columbus, Chinook, Amarillo, and Cascade."
