It is clean, bright and flavorful, yet I often crave a deeper, more biting bitterness and will opt for the rebel IPA in it's place. I like to vary my IPA's so as not to burn out on their taste.

3.25,-8.7,,,,,,"12 oz bottle from the "Hopology" sampler.  Pours amber in color with a very foamy head.  According to the label it has 5 types of hops, so I was expecting that to dominate the taste buds.  It does.  At this point I wanted to reconcile the bitterness to some kind of sweet or citrus flavor, but I found some caramel, grass, and malt instead.  It was a notch above okay due to the complexity of the hops, but I'm not sure this is a beer I would drink again.","ENogueira","Aug 28, 2014"

3.75,5.3,,,,,,"Didn't expect much from Sam Adams since most of their beers are mediocre at best, but I was impressed with this one. Pours a nice deep reddish amber with good lacing. Nice piney citrus aroma. The tastes are of malty sweetness, citrus and hop bitterness though not intense. I normally go for the high ibu ipas, but the balance between the hoppiness and maltyness in this one makes up for the lack of intense bitterness. Somehow it works. Nice job Sam Adams!","Seabass1964","Aug 27, 2014"

Very nice nose of both tropical, which is the primary, and pine hops over a caramel sweetness. Medium bodied with a slick, almost creamy, mouthfeel. Average carbonation level with a touch of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is quite nice, balanced, complex and hop forward. It begins with a rather unique blend of hop flavor - typical American citrus over the EKGs. Sort of an IPA and ESB cross. This flows into a mild bitterness which is grapefruit and EKG in nature. On the finish, tropical hop flavor takes the forefront over a slight sweetness. As it fades, orange is noted.","tillmac62","Jun 20, 2014"

I've certainly had better, but this is an acceptable hoppy ale that doesn't go overboard and remains highly sessionable for the style. Worth a try for sure, and something I'd consider getting again - although with quality, domestic IPAs becoming increasingly common I'm not sure this will be a regular purchase for me.","thehyperduck","May 18, 2014"

It leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass given the beer's abv and style. The nose on this one is hoppy but light. Definite pine and citrus notes but with a bit of a sweet malty backbone. The flavor follows suit. Not real hoppy but bitter and balanced by the malt. The beer is a little thick on the mouth for such a light beer. This one is interesting and enjoyable but not something I feel the need to return to.","lochef81","Jan 30, 2014"

It has lightly raisiny, caramelly-toasty sweetness under spicy-peppery bitterness with orange-wood-grapefruit hop elements. Bitterness is stornger in finish and lingers a bit but with increasing sweetness. Overall, bitter and sweet together, a bit English in character but also a bit America - a good, well-rounded IPA with dominant hop character but nice firm maltiness to support it and some complexity.","Offa","Oct 27, 2013"

3.74,5.1,4.25,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Close to two fingers of fairly dense foam, eggshell white, some dimpling going on, retention level is good, likewise the lacing comes in thick sheets with admirable stickiness. Bronzed orange liquid, closer to brown than yellow, good clarity with tight, active beads of tiny bubbles. Expressive nose, floral with heavy sweet citrus dew, pine sap and peach to apricot fruit, also hits you with some toasty, bready notes and roasted cocoa, at times close to coffee, more of a puncher than a finesse boxer. Medium-bodied, there is a bitter bite but this is quickly overcome by the fluffy carbonation and general creamy mouth feel. Emphasis remains on the orange, pink grapefruit citrus, flowers and pine. While it lacks a keen edge, there is some pineapple, mango in there with the peach, apricot base. The roast maybe higher here, dries out the finish with mocha, cocoa and bread crust. Not getting much caramel or butterscotch, more metallic or earthy accents. Pretty consistent profile nose to palate, not sure of freshness of bottle, may have had a fresher, more brisk demeanor in its youth. But pleasing enough in a basic sense and decently sessionable.","farrago","Sep 27, 2013"

3.16,-11.2,4,3,3,3.5,3.25,"Hadn't had a hoppy beer from Sam Adams in a long time and was excited to try this one out. From the start I noticed that this one had a much more herbal spin to it than I expected. Definitely not the traditional American IPA grapefruit/pine combo. Having said that, there was also a dullness to the hop character. The beer wasn't out of code, but it wasn't that bright hop flavor I've come to expect in an American IPA. I like that it wasn't over the top bitter, but would have preferred it to be a bit more aromatic an a little less earthy. Overall, I enjoyed the beer but was looking for something a little more true to the style these days.","Smoke","Aug 25, 2013"

3.93,10.4,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"I get why many are disappointed with this, and I think it's for the same reasons why I like it. Its ABV is modest for the style, and the malt, while not particularly flavorful, provides some level of balance. I know the "b word" may not belong in a discussion on IPAs, but personally, I think balance is a good idea. Anyway, I'll admit I'm not an IPA connoisseur, but I can't help but think this is well executed, even if its bitterness is placed into moderation. The flavors work, and if nothing else, it's a good introduction for a casual beer drinker into the style. Fresh citrus, grapefruit, and pine come from the hops in the smell and taste, and again, while the malt doesn't add much in terms of flavor, it does seem to give it that [insert "b word"]. Mouthfeel is great, with medium/high thickness and carbonation that is fairly low (it could be increased a bit I feel). Anyway, aside from the Boston Lager, this is without question in my opinion the best feature of the season's "Harvest Collection" 12-pack. Overall, this is an approachable IPA, one that may not be bold, extreme, or extravagant, but one that simply delivers great taste, a great mouthfeel, and clearly great quality ingredients.","DeFaz","Aug 19, 2013"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth and the flavors held my attention, but it's a little too bitter to drink a lot of so I think two of these would be my limit, but it seems like this would be a nice and refreshing American IPA to have during the summertime. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both pretty good and they were the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was that the citrus hops didn't carry over as much as they did in the aroma, but other than that there wasn't anything that I disliked about this beer. I would by a six pack of this beer on it's own when I'm in the mood for a solid American IPA and I would recommend this to anyone that likes American IPA's. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and I thought that it was an all around solid American IPA that was surprisingly refreshing. I'll have to keep this beer in mind when I'm in the mood for an American IPA this summer, good job guys and this one solid and enjoyable American IPA.","StoutHunter","Feb 26, 2013"

This is a great example of the style and would be a great beer to try for someone trying to get into hoppier beers.

It has a fresh, fruity, grassy aroma with an earthy quality to it. It has a smooth, medium light body with a crisp, clean finish. The flavor is nicely balanced. Crackery, peppery malt frames a nice wooden hop flavor. It tastes fruity but dry. The bitterness is never extreme. What a well crafted beer.","yesyouam","Oct 21, 2012"

3.86,8.4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"12oz bottle, best before Dec 2012, pours deep copper with a nice fluffy ivory colored head that holds good retention and leaves great lacing on the glass. Aromas are bready malt, piny hop, some caramel and citrus also. Tastes are flavorful and very well balanced with brown or rye bread crust, caramel, dank piny hop, somewhat citric - grapefruit perhaps, although mild. Mouth-feel is creamy but a little resiny, medium bodied with good carbonation. Once again, great balance here - it's not a hop bomb, but has good complexity with a bolder malt backbone to compliment the piny hop characteristics. I enjoy going back to this one from time to time, as it is one of my favorite Sam Adams beers.","barnzy78","Sep 21, 2012"

The smell is not lacking in sophistication and gives the drinker what one would expect in a proper IPA -- hops, some bitter caramel, and nuts with a flavor that backs it up. The mouthfeel and aftertaste do it for me, leaving a bitter cashew-esque flavor in my mouth that makes me eager for my next sip as one would enjoy a bowl of nuts.

Pours a good amber color with a nice stable creamy head that has good cling. Aroma is very hoppy with citrus and floral notes. Taste is bitter right up front that fades to a crisp clean finish. Taste is earthy and floral. Good residual sweet malt character, and a nice medium to full body. Medium high carbonation that provides a crispness to the beer that aids in it's clean finish. Overall a very refreshing and enjoyable IPA that is about halfway between a nice light APA and a true hop bomb. Recommend trying at least once for fans of Pale Ales, more die-hard hop heads might be disappointed.","scvance","Aug 27, 2012"
3.85,8.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"a very balanced ipa from sam adams. this pours a crystal clear honey color with a vibrant thick white head that sticks around. smells like some of the czech hops, bitter and fruity without a ton of the resinous characteristics. flavor is more than just hops, with nice german style malts that stand up to the hops. the hop profile is a little fruity and quite pungent, bitter in the long finish. mouthfeel is right on for this beer, medium bodied and fairly carbonated. not a total session ipa, as it can get a little heavy after awhile, but one you would definitely have several of. an excellent summer ipa overall.","StonedTrippin","Aug 27, 2012"

3.48,-2.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Notes: Back to trying this one as part of their Hops Mixed-12 pack. Still a bit of a boring IPA, nothing bad about it, but rather avoidable otherwise. In the deconstructed offering last year it was far more boring than its decomposed parts, which actually were rather stimulating as a tasting session, and socially they worked out rather well. On its own, and having a choice among other quality IPAs, this is still a pass… Does it have a predominantly European character? Maybe… I certainly would prefer if the American hops took a bigger role other than for the bittering, and the malty backbone sweetness with those Sam Adam's touches is not too exciting to the palate.","Daniellobo","Jul 16, 2012"

It leaves TONS of lacing even long after the beer is finished. The smells is of tons of hops, With nothing else really going for it other than that. I honestly didn't care much for the taste. A little bit of toasted caramel malt, not as sweet as I had thought it would be although there is a faint trace of perhaps some grapefruit and even some slight orange flavor far off in the distance. The mouthfeel was pretty nice, Although heavily carbonated and foamy. Overall, A pretty standard beer.

Pours fairly crystal clear orange amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of orange, herbal, grapefruit, floral, pineapple, mango, caramel, bread, earth, and light pine. Pretty nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of orange, caramel, bread, herbal, floral, grapefruit, pine, earth, pineapple, mango, and light toast. Fair amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, herbal, floral, tropical fruit, caramel, and light pine on the finish for a bit. Good balance of malt, hop flavor, and bitterness; with the maltiness being slightly more prominent that what is normal for an IPA. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice IPA. Not over the top hoppy like most people would prefer; but has nice balance and hop flavor, and is very drinkable. Very enjoyable stuff.","superspak","Jun 19, 2012"

3.88,9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This was poured from bottle into a jigger revealing a nice tan-colored three finger head. This slowly faded with nice lacing. The color of the beer is a nice amber/tea color, that was very clear. The nose started off with sweet bready malt then backing off to the hops consisting of pine and citrus. The flavor was tart from the citrus and pine of the hops and finishes with the sweet malt... A paradox to the nose. The mouthfeel is bready and fuller bodied than some IPA's that I've tried. This a drinkable beer but not as bold in the use of hops as other IPA's, it might make a good introductory IPA to the novice looking to expand their beer palate without shocking them completely.","Rantingfury","Jun 16, 2012"

4.08,14.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This brew is a bronze-ish amber color, clear, and topped with a white head. Notable carbonation throughout the glass. The aroma is a peppery mix of spicy hops...woody, earthy, herbal. There's a little background malt as well, toasted and caramel-like. The aroma, although very good, is a little muted for an IPA...it could be more robust. The taste, however, makes up for this small criticism. It's full, lush, and multi-layered. Malt and hops are very well balanced, as well as sweetness, which is pronounced up front, and hop bitterness, with lingers and is central to the beer. Spicy, peppery notes continue in the taste. Smooth mouthfeel, despite a little carbonic fizz. Great, hop-flavored finish. Nice beer.","Suds","May 20, 2012"

I can see some collecting along the boundary with the head, but there aren't very many. There is decent head retention. Lacing is left along the side of the glass as the head retreats. There's a malty aroma accompanied by hops. The hops bring floral and citrus notes to the nose. It's a pleasant aroma. It's not exceptionally hoppy like a West Coast IPA, but the hop presence is definitely there. There are big malt flavors. There is a nice blend of bitter, pine, and citrus flavors from the hops. It's not as well balanced as some other IPAs because the bitterness does tend to dominate the other flavors a bit too much. However, it is still good. The body is medium and the carbonation is average. It's fairly easy to drink. Overall, this gets a B from me. It's not the best IPA I ever had, but I do think Samuel Adams is on the right track with this one.","acevenom","Apr 29, 2012"

It’s a yellow tinged copper color with a healthy white fuzz and awesome, comprehensive lacing. I get a simple but adequate lemony, wheat-malt aroma. The flavor is more of the same with a medium light body, smooth near glassy feel, tiny bubble medium carbonation. Very bready, but the citrus bite is a nice balance. I get some caramel sesame seed graininess. Very solid. Easy drinker for some hop pleasure but not very memorable.","Durge","Apr 07, 2012"

4.03,13.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Bottle poured to a pint glass. Nice dark amber color with slight haze. Pale tan head persists well, with nice lacing to the bottom of the glass. The aroma is a blend of sweet malt and spicy hops, with neither one dominating the other. I expected a bit more hop aroma complexity from this beer. Taste is similar to aroma, but with the complexity I wanted. Sweet caramel malt is quickly overtaken by medium-high hop bitterness. Bitterness is a tad low for my taste, but balances the malt nicely. Hop flavor is fairly high, featuring perfumey and floral notes. I would like more of the spicy hop flavors in this beer. Medium body with good carbonation and a slightly astringent, dry finish. Overall a very approachable, drinkable IPA, but not in my top tier of this style, even for readily accessible beers.","CASK1","Mar 04, 2012"

This beer does a nice job of providing a good mixture of noble hops and some American hop varieties, all while maintaining balance with the caramel, biscuity, and toasty malts. I will absolutely enjoy this year-round offering from Sam Adams again.","TechTriumph","Jan 24, 2012"
4.03,13.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: Really impressed with this, I had it a few years back and thought it was horrendous, I think Koch changed up the recipe.

3.67,3.1,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Out of a bottle this beer was a rich amber color with a nice head of foam that unfortunately did not retain well and left only a little lacing. The aroma was of pale malt and some biscuity malt along with citrusy hops that slanted towards grapefruit. The flavors were nice especially for Sam Adams, a macro-micro producer. I tasted bitter, piney hops along with the grapefruit notes with a caramel malt background and a clean finish. Simple but effective. The mouthfeel was pleasant, the body medium and the carbonation good.","thekevlarkid","Jan 22, 2012"

3.62,1.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer has an amber hue, and the nose is sort of earthy, mildly hoppy, and actually pretty decent nose and look overall. Taste if basically what I would expect from an IPA, but maybe a little bit more on the malty side then west coast style IPAs. Pretty good carbonation. I will admit, I sometimes I feel I am too harsh on Sam Adams... this certainly is not the best IPa I have ever drank, but it's quite drinkable, and is pretty decent taste wise. It is also reasonably priced, and available all over. So in my mind, for these reasons, it is a pretty good beer.","ely2000k","Dec 17, 2011"

This is not a criticism; there is a place for such a beer. As such, if you're looking to expand your Bud-drinking horizons, but don't want to get your tongue sizzled off by 100+ IBUs of hop fury, this beer is a good place to start, as it will provide you with a good set of flavors that are largely indicative of the style.","jondeelee","Nov 14, 2011"

Earth and pine flavors dominate. It's not as smooth as I would like. Hop presence is there, but the hops don't stand out or shine. The beer is medium bodied with a healthy malt bill. Malt and earth flavors take over the beer, overshadowing the hop profile. Overall, an OK beer, but not something I will buy again. Mediocre in its class.","Huhzubendah","Aug 31, 2011"

Scent is dominated by hops, instead of pine and citrus found in most IPAs, lots of grassy, floral, spicy notes backed by nutty and lightly sweet caramel malts. Taste leads with a bitter hop burst, again earthy, grassy and spicy. Carmel and toasted nuts make up the lightly sweet and solidly malty background. Finishes crisp and lightly metallic, almost lager like. Dry and crisp, medium bodied and lighter shade of carbonation. Just doesn't spit for me in the crowded world of IPAs.","rfgetz","Aug 23, 2011"

Earthy, herbal hoppy aroma with hints of ripe oranges and a sweet malty undertone. Medium bodied with a smooth, oly feel. Herbal and citrus orange flavors up front and a sweet malty backbone throughout. Pine hop flavor starts in the middle and intensifies to the finish.

The nose was very piney and tickled my sinuses with its intensity. MY mouth began to water and I was off and running. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops seemed to pop on the tongue, first with intense pine, then with bitter citrus and finally giving way to a caramel sweetness, thanks to the malt. The dense lacing that began to appear reminded me that tonight was the night I was scheduled to do the dishes. The finish was literally breathtaking, thanks to the intensity of the hops. The pine hops created a kind of burning sensation in the back of my throat and the bitter citrus hops actually lent a drying sensation to the mix. Whew!","woodychandler","Aug 22, 2011"
3.88,9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Color is dark amber. Head light tan, stiff, lasted and laced. Smell went from citrus at first pour and then pine as head faded. Taste is all hop with only enough malt to balance and opposed to the single hopped latitudes which had a bit more malt to them. Its very hard for me to pick out the 5 single hops that I have sampled/learned from the other offerings in the pack. That said the combination makes for a very good IPA that's somewhat creamy and does have pine citrus and floral qualities (in that order).","Justin23060","Aug 21, 2011"

This is a very well made beer that goes down easy and tastes good. The 6% abv is deceiving and very well hidden.

Nice latticework of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest and herbal hops with a solid malt backbone. Taste is of citrus zest mixed with some herbal hops. The malt on the finish is not as apparent as I would have thought. Medium hop bitterness on the palate after each sip.

If I was blind folded I would have thought I was going to drink an English Ale (sweet). Mouthfeel is excellant. Sudsy small bubbles that you can swish around in your mouth. Again, all malt and sweet. Very heavy caramel until the finish which is hoppy. In fact, that little bitter/dry finish kind of cleanses the palate for the next sip. This beer is not what I was expecting but a nice surprise. It's complex but if I was to keep an IPA on hand in the fridge I would choose another. But I would drink this again.","Ilovesuds","Aug 11, 2011"
4.52,27,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Wow this beer is dark! It mirrors a Barleywine or Dubbel. Darkest IPA I have ever seen. Extremely dense amber. Got a huge head on the pour also. At least 2 fingers. Although the color isn't a good representation of the style. Most I see are quite a bit lighter. Smell is very sweet, grassy and herbal caramel malts with a big grapefruit kick and sharp hoppiness. Outstanding for a lower abv IPA. I must say the bitterness is quite prominent. Never really expected this out of Sam Adams. Taste is also very dirty and earthy with hints of tropical fruits. They picked a great blend of hops to play with. Mouthfeel is very creamy with well balanced carbonation. This seriously has quite a flavor punch to it. I can't help but think most people will rate is lower just because it is Sam Adams. It ranks right up there with the big boys or small boys rather in my opinion.

Cap drops to a thin cap but it sticks around for a decent amount of time and to the sides of the glass. Smell is very mild and dosent' grab my attention at all. First sip shows some pepper and spiceyness up front quickly followed by some bitterness. More of an earthy hoppiness than a floral/citrus hops that I've become accustomed to but still nice bitterness. The malt backbone really stands out in this one. Taste is more potent than the smell. Bitterness is enough to push this one unquestionably intonthe ipa range but to me this was very different from what I'm used to. I don't mean that in a bad way, but not a traditional American ipa.

3.86,8.4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a deep amber color with a frothy white head that sticks around for a bit before impaling itself to the sides of the glass. Smells of earthy and herbal hop flowers mixed with a bit of caramel and bread. Light hints of apricot and citrus in the aroma as well. The taste follows the aroma fairly well. Nice bready caramel base with just enough earthy hops to make this IPA like. A little bit of a mineral or metallic note in there somewhere. Medium body and level of carbonation, resinous slick mouthfeel. This is a decent readily available IPA, but it is not one of my favorites. I'd like to see a bit more caramel type maltiness and a bit more hop bite. Some cascade or centennial could have added some great complexity to the hop bill.","johnnnniee","Jul 01, 2011"
3.15,-11.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Overall: My hat's of to Sam for taking a shot at this popular style. However, this one is just not up to snuff. SA beers tend to be "gateway" options, but I just don't think that an IPA is the right vehicle for introducing someone to craft beer. Considering the popularity of this style, there are just too many other options that I would reach for before I have this one again.","JohnnyChicago","Jul 01, 2011"
3.37,-5.3,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Poured this AIPA from a 12 oz bottlie into a pint glass. This beer poured a copper color, it produced a white head. Head retention was average and it left some lacing on the glass. The aroma was dominated my hops and citrus. The taste of the AIPA has a malt base which gives way to sweet and then bitter hops. Overall, this IPA is better than I expected and IPA to be from Sam Adams. It's not overly aggressive but it has more "umph" than most safe mass produced versions of this style.","GossageBrewery","Jul 01, 2011"

But the taste is where this one really falls short; it's all bitterness, without distinctive hop flavors. No grass, citrus or what-have-you. Just a bitter flavor that's very unbalanced and just not very good. The mouthfeel is fine, drinkability is ok, the aftertaste isn't excessively long or unpleasant, but it's just not that tasty. After smelling the beer you're ready for something a lot more interesting and pleasing. It's not awful but I won't be running back for more, especially with the huge variety of excellent IPAs that are readily available wherever I go.","tobelerone","Jun 28, 2011"

The smell of the beer is generously hopped, lots of citrusy aromas on the nose with a little bit of malt coming through in the background. The taste follows the same way as the smell, big citrus flavors up front that finish with a biscuity flavor. The mouthfeel is light and not very filling.

The malts stands firm with toffee and caramel leading the way. The house yeast gives it a very "Sam Adams-y" feel to it however, and I think it hampers it here. I want it a bit more vibrant and crisp for an IPA. I am enjoying this beer though, pretty smooth and has lots of hop flavors...will be fun to work through the deconstructed 12-pack, no doubt.

I wasn't expecting a full-strength west coast style IPA, so the moderate hop bitterness and flavor does not disappoint. A light caramel and toast malt base supports a gentle hop flavor with leafy flavor and bitterness. With more sips, a slight nuttiness comes through as well.

3.71,4.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a hazy, deep copper with two fingers of sticky, off-white head with excellent retention. Aromas are very balanced between caramelly malts and citrus and floral hops. Flavors are consistent with the nose and remain well-balanced, but lack the vibrancy and assertiveness necessary to make it a memorable IPA. Lingering flavors become more resinous and woody than on the palate. Overall, I think it's tasty but tame for an IPA. Perhaps this would make a good "starter IPA" for the uninitiated.

Awesome lacing; the best I've seen from BBC and I've had the majority of their beers. Pretty mellow for an IPA. I'd say it's an IPA with training wheels. I'm not picking up the different hops; it's pretty straightforward and doesn't require me to think too hard. There are much better IPAs out there for around the same price.

3.58,0.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O: Overall this is a very balanced and flavorful brew that should please most beer enthusiasts. While there are certainly more hop-centric beers out there, I would imagine this would satisfy the palate of most hop lovers while remaining balanced enough to accommodate those who prefer a more balanced or malt-oriented character. This should stand as a great example of the American IPA style and a good entry-level beer for novice drinkers. This is also the Boston Beer Company doing what they do best.

3.7,3.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a Beautifil copper color with visible carbonation. The head is off white and about one finger tall. Retention is decent and it leaves a little lacing in my glass. The smell is of pine and citrus, with a touch of malt. The taste hits my tongue with the pie and citrus hops, them I get a bit of the malt. Aftertaste is a lingering bitterness from the hops. The flavor is more balanced than my beloved west coast hop bombs, but I find it to be a refreshing change. Mouthfeel is medium bodies, and it has a slight smoothness to it. Overall, a nice beer, and I enjoyed it, but I'll stick to my west coast hop bombs. One drawback for me is the 6% ABV, a little less and I'd be a lot more likely to drink it.","gkunkle","May 14, 2011"

The Simcoe piney bitterness shines through, blending with subtle peppery grapefruit oils. Smooth and well-rounded with a solid bitterness. A quality, easy-drinking, enjoyable ale.

The taste follows suit, with the lively, tangy, bitter hops taking the forefront. Really tasting the Simcoe which are one of my personal favorites. The peppery, resiny hops are nicely offset with a subtle caramel malt backbone that makes this thoroughly drinkable, and it improves as it warms up.

The hops are full-flavored, but not too sharp, and citrusy in the front and the finish. It's a very hoppy beer, but not extremely bitter. The hops more caress the mouth rather than attack it. There's a slight sweetness to it, malts and lemony flavors coming to life behind the in-your-face hops. Mouthfeel is spritzy but slightly watery and is the only thing that could use some small improvements. Good beer, nice and balanced IPA. Hopheads will be okay with it.","chodinheaven","May 09, 2011"

Loads of floral hops are in the aroma with a sweet maltiness kicking in the offset the bitterness. The body is smoothe and creamy. It tends to be sweeter than the IPA's I favor.

Lots of hops flavor, but not the most bitter IPA ever. I'm not sure what I'm tasting besides hops. I guess there is some maltiness to the taste. It's sort of like a strong flavored colby cheese.

3.64,2.2,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Mouthfeel is average with adequate carbonation. Overall, this is by far one of the best beers Sam Adams have ever made, much better than Noble Pils or their Imperial Hallertau Pilsner. Definitely their best hopped beer ever.","claspada","Mar 12, 2011"
3.95,11,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a deep orange to copper color with a very foamy head that never leaves. Good looking pour. Smells of sweet malts and earthy pines. Nice hop finis to round out a good smelling IPA. Taste is well balanced and amazingly smooth. Not a huge hop flavor but enough to keep a bitter finish. Very well carbonated and hints of citrus fruits and bready malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. This is an extremely drinkable brew from Sam Adams. Easy on the wallet and very sessionable.","abrand","Mar 12, 2011"

3.85,8.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"A copper brew with a bubbly tan head that fills the pint glass quickly after a medium pour. Has excellent retention and leaves a fine sheet of tall lace. A commingling of citrus and oily hops with hints of orange peel and unexpected gingerbread to the nose. Tastes of big oily hops with a pleasant fruity and citrusy middle and a slightly chalky aftertaste. A little spicy alcohol heat lingers. Medium bodied yet floats lighter than expected on the palate. Not a perfect IPA, but darn tasty and satisfying, which equals a win in my book.","stephens101","Mar 03, 2011"

There's way too much sweetness going on here. The taste too is super malty with slight bitterness to finish. It's hard to get past the sweetness.

3.93,10.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours an almost-clear amber color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is hoppy with a bit of malt as well. I also get some grassy notes. Taste is pretty well balanced. The maltiness and hoppiness are both mellow and not very "in your face". I get some tasty caramel malt and some piney hops with a bit of citrus. Mouthfeel is a little too light with a nice crisp finish. Drinkability is high on this. Overall, this is a very "user friendly IPA". Not too extreme that could get Coors and Bud drinkers into IPAs.","DovaliHops","Feb 19, 2011"

Smooth but bitterness is not as refined or refreshing as some other brews, nonetheless very drinkable.","stingrayvr6","Feb 16, 2011"

4.15,16.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall it's quite nice. I find it more English in nature than anything else, but I like the idea behind the hopping, and I really enjoy the way the notes of malt and hop intertwine.

I can drink this when I'm in the mood or when eating some nice pork ribs.","earthboundagain","Feb 07, 2011"
3.8,6.7,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a crystal clear amber color with golden highlights. Creamy off-white head with abundant lacing. Smell is a bit of caramel and tropical fruit. Upfront, the taste is of herbal, grassy, floral hops, followed by a wave of sweet malt, and finally, some pine, citrus, and a whole lot more floral flavors. Nice balanced bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, good average levels of carbonation. Quite drinkable, not too high in alcohol makes this a nice, well balanced IPA.

It's sorta piney-grassy. Lots of caramel malt. Fairly sweet. Bitterness is mild. Just a lot of bready malt that doesn't seem right with hops. The feel starts kinda creamy but gets watery. It's not a bad beer, just not a great IPA.","popery","Feb 04, 2011"
4.35,22.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: A winner from Samuel Adams. They'd gone without a regular IPA offering for such a long time, but this is a welcome addition with excellent balance and enough hop bitterness for most hopheads.

The hops smelled very herbal and earthy, and there was floral tinge to the smell as well. The taste was a well balanced affair, with malt sweetness coming across like hard toffee, and hop bitterness holding firm from start to finish of each sip. The mouthfeel was creamy and dry, with a puckering bitter finish and a drawn out aftertaste. A very well crafted AIPA from Sam Adams here, and the widespread availability makes it a beer I am probably going to fall back on quite often in the future.","rajendra82","Jan 21, 2011"

3.85,8.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Good moderately-full mouth. On the heavier side for the style, but not too heavy that it would be difficult to have multiples. Mild bitter hop bite at the onset, but this is fleeting. Gives way to a sweet bready flavor that finishes well. This isn't a "hop head's" IPA, but it's a good one nonetheless. Standard drinkable IPA that won't burn you out, yet still packs plenty of flavor. A good one to introduce others to the style.","Onenote81","Jan 18, 2011"

Very balanced. The taste is identical to the smell. This beer is a perfect marriage between sweet and bitter. Exceptionally balanced. This is a beer that should be a welcomed addition to your beer quiver. This beer goes great with spicy foods, but could also be a good session beer despite the fact that it is approximately one percent ABV % higher than a traditional session beer.

There is a nice bitterness throughout, both in the aroma and taste, but I'm not a fan of all the hops used here. The hallartaus here don't mesh all that well with the other hops, and the flavors are muddled. Pine, earth, bitter citrus, forest floor, and a tanginess that seems out of place. I don't hate it, but I don't love it. It also fades on the finish and has a slightly weird aftertaste- sorta like alkaseltzer.","Georgiabeer","Jan 06, 2011"
3.78,6.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"the beer presents as an orangey light amber with a short head. the cap sticks around well but doesn't leave all that much lace for an ipa. the smell is citric in the lower reaches of the register and there is clearly a lot of malt going on, some caramelized. upon tasting the malty sweetness is apparent, accompanied by some orange-like citric flavor and the bitterness is mostly a vague baratone orange rind. due to maltiness the body is at least medium, and the carbonation is pretty lush. the sweetness does not become as burdensome as it does in some east coast IPAs, like flying dog's, but it's enough to make the cracking of a second bottle less likely.","brewmudgeon","Jan 05, 2011"

The color of the beer is actually quiet dark for an IPA, almost amber, but very clean looking. The head retention is almost biblical. Almost 15 minutes after I poured the beer in the glass, it still has a well defined head. The malts really stand out for the initial time in the mouth, then it is the hops turn. The hops are very balanced, nothing overwhelming here. The beer finishes very crisp, very little after taste, and of that it fades rapidly. The beer has some very nice carbonation, very light but noticeable. Over all this beer is a great beer that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys IPAs, Sam Adams comes through again!","DaveCS","Dec 30, 2010"

Head retention is decent, with a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is mostly pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops, along with some sweet malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, as the beer tastes like pine and citrusy (grapefruit, orange peel) hops, and caramel and bready malt. There's a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent enough, it's not hard to drink at all.

Aroma is citrus hops. Tastes like a standard American IPA with one difference. The combination of hops yields a "green" flavor to the citrus. Like under ripe grapefruit. Not bad as such but unusual. I am more used to the "over ripe" citrus which yields a much sweeter IPA. Mouthfeel was just right for the style and with a modest 5.8% abv makes this one highly drinkable.

There are smells of hops (obviously), but also a sweet smell (maybe citrus?). The beer has a heavy hop forward flavor that hits all over the front of the tongue. The bitter hops flavors are balanced with the sweetness of the malt, and the beer is light and crisp. The beer is a little lighter than my preference for IPAs, both in body and ABV, but it's a pretty tasty foray for ol' BBC.

On the positive side, it was crisp and bitter, and the pine presence gave it a little more depth than it would have otherwise had. Still, it would have benefitted from a bigger body (maybe throw in some good malts from the 48th parallel? hehe) and a more balanced hop profile. Perhaps I enjoyed it too cold, but to be honest the taste didn't really seem to improve over time. Thankfully I got this one from a friend, because I doubt I'd go out and buy it.

It's okay, its not offensive, its quite drinkable, it just isn't a very good AIPA. There isn't much aftertaste because once the tart leafy hops are gone, there just isn't much left in the mouth to draw the flavor out.

Bone colored head is about two fingers in height. Head retention is middling, but the beer leaves sheets of lacing down the side of my glass. The nose is hoppy enough to be an American IPA, but has more of the aroma of an English IPA, very herbal and spicy, with just a hint of citrus in the background. There's also a healthy caramel presence. The malty sweetness is still caramel on my palate, and it's pretty brief. The hop bitterness comes in next and is fairly pronounced, right in line for an American IPA. The hop flavors on the back end are really great, it's a pretty balanced blend of grapefruit/citrus and herbal/spicy. Most IPAs I've had have either strongly American or strongly English/European hop flavors, but Latitude 48 lets both shine through prominently. In terms of malt/hops interplay Latitude 48 is a fairly balanced IPA. The result is a beer with a little bit more rich of a mouthfeel than one might expect (especially for a beer that's under 6%ABV), but it doesn't become too big for the beer. Carbonation is soild, but I would have preferred it to be even a little higher to go along with the body.

I still prefer a slightly drier mouthfeel than this beer has with less caramel to distract from the hops, but there is sufficient hop flavor in this and the aroma is very pleasant too. I think the feel and color would be the only categories I would change and I stand by this review I just wanted to share the insight the 'deconstructed' version gave me and point out I appreciat the fact Sam Adams did this.

The aroma has a really complex hop profile that is a bit extraordinary for an American IPA, with notes of grass and mint, as well as some citrus, pine and herbal hop character, caramel and toasted bread maltiness, fruity esters and a bit of alcohol. The flavor also starts out with some minty and floral hops, with a background citrus and pine character, along with some honey wheat bread, caramel, walnut, fruity esters and some alcohol.

I had one of these in my summer variety pack and did not get this smell, you know, that tragic smell of dead hops. It is slightly stale smell, not a big one. BUT, I am not getting even the same floral hop smell I get from a good old fresh Boston Lager. The hops are herbal, earthy, from the European hops firstly, and end with a grapefruity citrus from the American, must be Cascades. But there a malty sweetness, making this is very balanced IPA.

There is a slight caramel malt nose as well.

Has some bitterness upfront that is mostly floral with a touch of grass. The malty backbone balances things out, but it is definitely not sweet. I do like that soapy bitterness that you get in the finish. It just doesn't have the hop presence that I'd like to see. Had enough carbonation for a crisp feel, yet also felt a little creamy.

The hop aroma is promising, if a bit subdued, but the flavor is lacking. The toasted malt character effects the hops as well, creating flavors in the middle of the flavor profile that would be more at home in a American barleywine than they are in this IPA. I really don't understand why some brewers like to stuff so much toasted/toffee character into their IPAs when it is so unflattering to the hops.

Citrus starts and traverses a light, malty backbone before converging on a mild bitterness that continues on to the finish and lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency, with an assertive carbonation and a slightly oily quality. Acidity lightly stimulates the salivary glands. A very solid American IPA.

This is an IPA that, while I won't reach for it every time as I love West Coast IPAs and APAs, fills a niche in that it is truly an exhibition of hops from the world over. It uses hops from the US, England and Germany and produces a hop flavor that I'm not sure I'e found before. In fact, it seems like the German hops are at the forefront, which would normally be a no-no for the style, but it definitely works here.

But this beer has it's own character and is very drinkable. It's still a one beer per sitting for me (a lot of bitterness after awhile is too much for me to stomach) but it's quite enjoyable on its own or with a meal (I had it with Ham steaks and Mac n' cheese).

The hops are present but not overpowering like some ipas. There is also notes of toffee and pepper present. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated.

The nose is citrus hops, caramel, maple syrup, and orange peel. The taste is pretty similar, emphasizing the citrus peel, hoppy bitterness, and a slight edge of toffee. Very straightforward, though tasty, IPA here. The body is light, with moderate carbonation and a dry finish.

Dark leather colored body. Much darker than I was expecting for an IPA. Decent sized head formation. Smell was hoppy and a bit piney, smelled like an IPA. Flavor was good, but it was different from what I was expecting again. The hops were there, but they were much more subdued and were there more for flavor. There wasn't a hop bite at all; instead I got more of the mouthfeel from the malt in the body. I guess this could be considered an IPA for a drinker that wants a smoother IPA than the hop monsters that are usually on the market. I enjoyed this beer, because its drinkability was not overpowered by a huge hop presence, but was instead enhanced just enough for my liking.","morebeergood","Jun 13, 2010"

Alcohol is present in both flavor and warming ability. Slight malt backing with a hint of sweetness to balance out the hop bitterness. Medium to full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation.

The aroma was comprised of only a slight hint of hops and nothing else that I could pick up on. The flavor was a light malt with a small amount of hops. It was light on the palate and had medium carbonation. Overall this was not my favorite bew from Samuel Adams. I was expecting more when I first saw this 'new' IPA, but was let down. However it is still a nice brew, just not what I expected. It could be improved if there was more of a hoppy flavor to it though.","thagr81us","May 27, 2010"

Taste is very hoppy at first, wet leafy, lawny, grassy hops with a twinge of lime at the end. The malt base is subdued, but not-so-obviously there based on the deep color of this brew. A touch of raw-sugar sweetness within the sip. Finishes dry, but not a lot of aftertaste. Pleas for the next drink. I'm a bit confused by the multinational hops, maybe it is a bit of overload, but this is definitely a unique offering from Sam Adams, and something I'm glad to have sampled.","sixerofelixir","May 25, 2010"

On the nose noble pils is much lighter, grassier, spicier, brighter and fruitier hops where latitude is heavier and chewier hops with a little crystal malt. Taste is also much different with noble pils being a lot grassier, spicier, and more mild on the hops, and no real malt flavors except perhaps a hint of wheat, but latitude has some crystal malts, chewier and piny hops. So I guess I just cracked a pils when I didn't need to, cause they're not really alike. Latitude IS a nice beer though, but different.

Another hop beauty from Sam Adams these hops are so fresh this brew could fill a big gap in the Sam Adams family of beers, that year round IPA they have went without for so long. I like the concept a big hoppy but balanced IPA with hops from the 48th parallel from Germany, English, and American Hops. Aromatics bring out earthy and citrus hop leanings with a fresh grassiness as well, big caramel malt balance going on liquid dessert bread backing up the hop profile. Flavor has a big alpha hop punch with citrus, tropical fruit, and earthy grassy dankness. This is some special stuff going down the gullet, glad to get an early peak at this creation. No raw bitterness on the palate it's much more balance hops coated with caramel slightly burnt sugars, the flavors it suggests are more tropical/citrus, and dank earthy weed. The hop feel brings out an oily texture on the palate with ample carbonation and a bigger bodied than the average Sam Adams summer seasonal release also best buy August, catch this one earlier than later please this is the only new offering out of this variety 12 pack but it's damn worth it.","WVbeergeek","Apr 09, 2010"

The lemon-lime hop character is there, which I like, but I liked it first in Noble Pils, and it lacks bitterness. It's a good IPA, and I do enjoy the hops that give it that zest. I just think the Pilsner was great and they should try something new for their IPA besides adding darker, thicker malts.

Pours a crystal-clear deep amber-red body with a good inch of fairly persistent off-white head. Smells amazing - grapefruit, orange, mint, pith, with hints of some caramel-toffee malts to balance. A really bright hop presence is very apparent, with lemon, grapefruit, mint, herb. A robust toffee-caramel maltiness with a slight tinge of butterscotch helps to balance this IPA. Medium in both carbonation and body makes this quite drinkable. Honestly, I cannot think of a bad thing to say about this beer. I am very impressed with this and am thrilled to have it in the summer multi-packs this year, though I'd love to see it in its own 6-packs and 12-packs by itself. Awesome.","MrHurmateeowish","Apr 05, 2010"

3.88,9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Light, easy drinking IPA with a decent level of bitterness. While I know it is a hybrid, it reminds me more of an English IPA than an American one.","bsp77","Apr 02, 2010"
