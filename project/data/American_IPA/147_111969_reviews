"Gold in color with nice lacing. Grapefruity floral aroma hops hit the nose followed by... wait you cant follow up those massive hop aromas. This is a nice summer beer with strong bittering hops that finish subtly with grapefruit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like someone spilled watered down grapefruit juice into my Stone IPA."
""
""
""
"Would not seek out or purchase again."

"Tasted like watered down ipa"
"This low abv thing is an interesting and welcome new trend.  Especially knowing that fully developed flavors can be achieved, I think this is an excellent market move for breweries.  I enjoyed this with grilled cheese and sundried tomato bisque."

"Not even sure I'd want to session this, probably just drink less of something I like more. But for what it is it's solid. Just not my taste."

"Aroma is pleasing and tempts one to proceed as planned. As far as sessions go, this is one to keep on hand."

"Nice beer, drink it very cold with a ribeye."
""
"Overall: One of the best session IPAs I've had, doesn't disappoint and it feels like stone"
"Amazing scent on a session ipa!"
""
"I'm not normally an IPA guy, but this one is turning me toward the style."
""
""
""
""
"Straight ipa, nothing that  exotic."

"An excellent session IPA.  Does not fall short in the flavor department.  Have read a few negative reviews and believe that FRESH is the key to enjoying this beer and many IPAs."

"I bought this beer in a retailer here in México, it´s at least 4 months old (maybe more) and it was ok, not bad but no so great either. I´ve tried a couple of stone beers here in Mexico and both have been very disappointing, I must try one in the US."

"Stone ""Go To IPA""... should be an easy one, right? Let's see. Typical IPA appearance although perhaps a little more ""golden"" than might have been expected. Slightly hazy, but probably from dry-hopping, so no complaints there. The head retention and lacing seem quite good. On to the aroma: pungent, resinous, citrusy - actually quite dank... interesting. The flavor is also a bit pungent and resinous, as well as piney, but there's also much more citrus present than the nose let on (grapefruit, tangerine, lemon). I thought to myself, ""if there's no malt going on beyond these hops, that'll still be OK for me", and it's kind of true - both for myself, and within the malt, which is somewhat biscuity but really just basic. Hmmm. I wish I hadn't thought that, because now I have a conundrum... is it OK with such a basic malt, or do I need more to support those intense hop flavors? Or does the malt allow those hop flavors to do what they want and just go to town? In the end I guess that's a question that really can't be answered. This has the bombastic hops of a bigger IPA, but the base of a much simpler IPA... it kind of leaves me looking for the malt of an ""average"" Stone IPA... but then I don't quite get the hops... so it's a trade-off - other than going to a bigger IPA (with much more alcohol) I'm a little bit stuck with one or the other... hmmm??? What I'll say then is that it's a welcome addition to the Stone line-up that has it's time and place. I'll gladly have more of these in the future, and I'll have plenty of other Stone IPAs as well, but for something like a 5 or 6 hour long deep sea fishing voyage these'll do just fine and I won't wake up as we return to dock covered in fish guts and empty crushed cans of Bud Light! (Not that that has ever happened!)"
"I will buy this again, and also suggest it to others that are new to different beer styles."

"On tap this is one of the all time best ipas available"
"I know it seems ridiculous to rate anything 5/5, but I absolutely love this IPA. I'm forever embarrassing myself drinking a higher gravity beer. The description ""admittedly"" sacrifices flavor for a lower ABV. Not to me. Super piney. Tastes and smells like weed, actually. Ha. I often find double and imperial IPAs to be too sweet. This is perfect. Hoppy and dry. It's hard to catch a buzz drinking it, but that's what whiskey's for. Cheers!"
""
"This is a great beer. Poured into a pilsner glass. Finger head dissipates fairly quickly. Light amber color. Smells floral. Tastes kinda bitter like any other hoppy IPA but has a nice citrus-y thing going on. Not bad bitter just enough to add character. Reminds me of grapefruit juice but in a good way."
""
""
"I drank it in the bottle. Immediately I could smell notes of grapefruit, lots of them. Has a bitter like grapefruit aftertaste and it is very carbonated. Not a bad IPA 4/5"
""
""
""
"Really enjoyed this ""session IPA"" .... Not much is lost in terms of taste and ""hoppy-ness"" with significantly lower ABV.  I'll return to this beer for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"drink every day."
""
""
""
"Excellent beer, a very drinkable IPA for those who want something a little lighter and less hoppy. Unique flavor and character."
""
""
""
"Had a very citrus taste to the hops. Grapefruit? Not my style"
""
""
""
"O-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"By far and away the best session IPA. Pick some up and drink it all summer."
""
""
"Well balanced IPA that is as the bottle says quite sessionable.  The floral notes tend to overpower any of the more subtle fruity flavors."
""
""
"Lemon balm! Both herb and citrus; Citra doesn’t get out of control. A bit thin, natch. 3rd best session IPA behind All Day and Daytime. 4"
"Overall: A little disappointing per Stone's pedigree. A good beer no doubt, but nothing particularly special about this one. [3.75]"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I would take one of stones regular IPA's for three of these sessions. Just pick up a regular ipa!!! I would pair this with simple sautéed broccoli rob with garlic and Calabrian chile. It gets a 70/100."
"O: Extremely flavorful. Must try."
"Reviews were all over the place so I had to give it a try. Aroma was super strong, tons of citrus notes. Taste was great. This might be my new session beer! Super smooth, no bitterness."
""
""
""
"Very good. Hesitated trying for a while due to lower reviews and low abv. It is really good. Tastes like lighter version of enjoy by to me. Has those mango grapefruit notes that enjoy by blasts out that ipa and ruin lack, but a little more subtle /watered down. Very good."
""
""
""
"Found the beer to be very thin and way over done on the late addition hops. Maybe got a weird batch but the beer is over price with so many other like ""bouncy house ipa"" out there."
""
""
"Great session beer, perfect for BBQ's"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the other hand, this has probably the highest ratio of hop flavors to alcohol and malt heaviness I can think of.  So if that's what you're looking for, it's pretty much ideal."
"This was a very good IPA. I would drink it again. Possibly even seek it out."
""
"Great beer. It's a nice refreshing beer."
""
""
""
"Great for watching football games and bbqing. Only 4.5% alc. I actually like it more than than stone ipa. Take it anytime over some lite beer!"
"Body is light but very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good bitter session beer. In my opinion it's more bitter then Ruination  just not as nearly balanced. Can see myself liking these on a cold fireplace IPA night."
"Still, a tasty drinkable brew. Guessing it'd be even more favorable if it were not so old."
"O: Fantastic as always - Stone have the Midas touch. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour are sublimely hoppy. Citrus, pine and fruitiness backed up by subtle malt and yeast notes. Good body. A delight for the palate; well worth sampling if you have the chance."
"Overall a respectable session beer, just not one I'll purchase again. Founders All-day and FFF Yum Yum are preferable in my region."
"Pretty hoppy and sweet. Too sweet to be a session ipa. But it's good though"
""
""
""
"Another home run by stone! This is very hoppy! And a awesome session beer at 4.5% abv"

"It smells and tastes like I'm standing in a room filled with hops."
""
"Grassy, minty hops over light graham cracker and melon on the nose and the palate. Gold with a light haze under a 1” white foam cap that quickly descends to a thick film but produces good lace. Creamy medium body and carbonation. Very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy straw color, smells of citrusy hops, tastes of grapefruit and hops with a creamy smooth finish."
"As usual, a good product by Stone Brewing Co.!"
""
"Bottle. Didn't check best by date. Fantastic clarity. Huge tropical and pine hop aroma. Strong bitterness and excellent hop flavor. Slightly thin, but that tends to come with the style. Amazing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice citrus and pine flavor"
""
""
""
"love this ipa. great for a few after work or half a case to get loaded on the weekend. not a ""heavy"" brew so you can have a few. a bit piney and good amount of bitterness. this is my default brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've no complaints about this beer at all, it’s definitely one of the better session IPA’s I've tried and is quite possibly the best given that it pretty much tastes like a good, traditional American IPA albeit with a lower alcohol content. It has plenty of bitterness and hops, a solid malt base and an excellent balance; what’s not to like?"
""
""
""
"Delicious and refreshing. Aptly named. Pours a bright yellow, well-carbonated, persistent fuzz. Smells amazing, like grapefruit and pine. Smooth mouthfeel, clean finish. Citrus hops dominate. Aptly-named, good session beer."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a bright yellowish color ale with a medium size white head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of grapefruit and citrus notes is really enticing with nice floral undertones. Taste is also dominated by nice citrus and grapefruit notes with some floral undertones and limited bitterness. There is some small dose of residual sugar notes that are noticeable with some non-descript malt notes. Body is light with good carbonation. Nice to see that you can get this nice hops profile without having too much alcohol."

"Great lil ""session"" IPA (I hate that ""session""term) super clean 4+% hoppy pale ale that is bittered far more than some other session IPAs out there- but it works.  Bright with good aroma, I like it, just not quite as much as Founders All Day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really embarrassing from Stone -- so out of balance that it harms the drinkability in a lethal way. I will drink Levitation anytime over this -- although that also suffers for being overhopped to some extent. Not even in the top 50 of session IPAs. Really a poor effort and I doubt it will survive a year without a major overhaul."

"This is the best session IPA I had so far. Hops flooding ones nose and tongue honoring its 65 IBUs on a lighter body and abv."
""
""
"Pours like unfiltered budweiser. Heady hops character, Southern hemisphere heady. Dusty, pale stonefruit, grass, maybe the most pungent in a bottled beer I can recall. Super dry, light bodied, tannic almost. Alphas stick on the back of the tongue like bong resin. If it had some more malt character or less spicy bitterness, it'd rank a 5. Stone still cranks your palate with hops, no surprise there."

"Pours a golden color with a tinge of amber. Smells of hops, hops, and more hops. For being a session I was thoroughly impressed with how on par the scent was. The taste was off from the scent though. It wasn't as hoppy and felt a little lacking though the middle. The beginning had lots of hops but dropped off quickly and lingered for a short while. For being what it is this is a solid beer that I could throw down all day if the occasion called for it. I will be picking up another pack soon."

"Hopbursting-sounded alluring!  So the usually cool Stone Brewing bottle.  Pours a slightly cloudy yellow with a medium white head that has decent retention.  Nice foamy lace down the glass.  Nose is bitter and acidic.  No discernable malt character.  Mouthfeel is medium which is surprising given the thin appearance.  Taste is just a slight malt character followed by big citrus and pine hits.  Moderately bitter but finishes clean.  The second bottle was better.  Perfect for a hot summer day.  Let your friends quaff bud light while you enjoy big hop in a little beer!"

"Single 12 oz. bottle poured into a standard pint glass for purposes of this review. A light harvest gold color with billowing sudsy head that tones itself down to a more manageable three fingers or so. After being absolutely blown away by other Stone IPAs, expectations are high. And they are met, although this brew is decidedly different from Stone IPA or Ruination (obviously). I Googled the tech specs and there are many hops in here, including a few experimental cultivars: Goes beyond the Centennial/Columbus/Chinook stalwarts that perform so admirably in the stronger Stones. Lives up to the session IPA billing and indeed could be the best exemplar of this substyle I've sampled to date. The drinker is greeted with lush vibrant aromas of melon, passion fruit, grapefruit, canned peaches, mango, grapes, and something more herbal and resinous as well, juniper or pine needles. A whole fruit bowl with added seasoning. Add orange, lemon, and pear to the palate and a very gentle malt body almost devoid of clear cut sweetness and you've got a highly drinkable yet potently flavorful winner. Vibrant fresh citrus and melon flavors, with that characteristic Stone herbal overtone as well. I hereby coin the term ""melon forward"". Light bodied, almost airy, with moderate carbonation and finishes dry, fruity, and floral. Wonderful stuff nearly beyond reproach. Maybe the body is TOO light? Maybe I'm reaching there."

"Very light with a huge hop aroma. Low ABV and high drinkability."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden yellow color with a 2"" head. Loads of citrus and hop bitterness comes through to the nose. Caramel, lemon zest, a bit of grapferuit, and a load of hop bitterness. Crisp throughout with a bit of dryness late. Refreshing and easy to quaff."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O:  Seems like an immense amount of Azacca hops are at work here.  As delicious as that hop is, I think this beer could use some toasty munich malt and maybe another citrusy hop like Apollo or Amarillo in the boil to give it some added complexity."

"Also, Stone insists that the lack of flavor is due to the low ABV. In my experience this isn't true. Hops have nothing to do with ABV. More hops in the boil, and a decent amount of dry hopping would improve this I'm sure."

"poured into a 16 ounce pint glass from a 22 ounce bomber...this is quite a nice fresh IPA, all sorts of hints of that classic Stone IPA taste....another wonderful variation of it! recommend you get one of these crack it and enjoy the hop deliciousness!!!"

"Bottle from Warehouse Package. Pours hazy gold with frothy white head. Aroma pine and citrus. Taste of bitter hops and a tiny bit of citrus. Light bodied and very refreshing. Good IPA"

"Overall: A little HopBomb! This beer is delicious that is satisfying my hop tooth tonight, without all the calories of course. Like I said this brew has all the hop flavors I seem to enjoy in my IPAs yet I could crush this beer like no other. I usually don't chain drink but this brew might actually encourage me! All in all, this brew is recommended."

""

"Great looking beer- pale gold with a very big persistent head with great lacing.  Big lemony and grapefruit citrus hop smell.  Taste is big on hops and lacking on malt.  Not surprising since this a session IPA.  Unbalanced, but if you love hops maybe that's a good thing?  Pretty light bodied for an IPA, which again I think is intentional.  Very drinkable.  Overall a very good sessionable hoppy ale."
""
"Pours a pale yellow with a white head. Aroma and Taste is citrus, a big blast of grapefruit pine aroma hits your senses but mellows out a bit, there is some grass and pale malt as well, mild bitterness. Palate is a medium body, carbonation is there but mild. Finishes with a bit of floral, grapefruit pine, pale malt and mild bitterness. Not a very bitter brew and although its a session style brew the aroma seemed a bit overwhelming, an ok brew overall."

I'm just not sure I am ready to jump on the Session IPA bandwagon quite yet.  I am sure I will buy more of this however."

"I began with an aggro pour, resulting in a brief pseudo-cascade that settled into finger of dense, off-white head with limited retention. It did leave nice lacing in its wake as it fell, which was kind of nice. I would say that the color was more Yellow than Gold (SRM = 4 -5) and it had NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled very citrusy, like fresh-squeezed grapefruit. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was citrusy, all right, but it did not have the intensity of the nose. Therein lies my problem with these new ""Session IPAs"" - they rely on aromatic hops, but do not come with the bitterness expected in the style when it comes to taste, which is what really counts. The finish was kind of bitter, but until they develop a new style for this type of beer, I am not going to rate it terribly highly as an AIPA. I just found it to be unfulfilling as a whole."

"A hop fueled yet drinkable beer. Very nice. The appearance is dark yellow with a thin head. The smell is full of citrus from the hops. Very light yet still very present. The taste is full of hops that leave a crisp and clean drinking beer. Also a very nice beer mouthfeel wise for drinking during the summer. I thought this was a session IPA that should definitely be checked out if you're a fan of hop flavor."

""
"Mouthfeel is light. Very watery. Quite thin. Moderate carbonation. Still very refreshing. One of the better Session IPAs you'll find."
""
""
""
""

"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Cloudy golden color with a thick white head that dissipated after 3-4 drinks. Smell coming out of the glass was the strongest I've ever smelled. It was like a bouquet of scents bursting out of the glass. The taste was similar as the smell. Just a lot of things happening as once! Hops hops hops. Mouthfeel and finish were lighter and not as bitter as anticipated. A great and flavorful IPA."
""
"O: Overall would hardly believe this much hoppiness can be crammed into a low abv% offering and still maintain a sense of balance. Its a big drinking ipa squeezed into a session like serving much like a 6'11"" basketball player being squeezed into a smart car. Honestly its one and only drawback may be that the hopping is so aggressive and strong, as well its body fullness, it will be hard to pound this as a session like ipa. But it will still remain as a go to."

"O- super solid IPA, highly recommend for IPA lovers, pucker up the flavor glands!"

"Another ""session IPA""? Jesus, is 1% ABV really that necessary to trim from our beers, guys? Anyway, off of my soapbox, this stuff pours a lightly hazy golden brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light caramel-drizzled biscuit, lime zest, pine resin, grass, and light menthol. The taste brings in more of the same, the lime, grapefruit, resin, and menthol combining for that characteristic Stone assault on the tastebuds. Fuck you, balance, I guess, but, hey, Stone's done good work with that mentality in the past, so what the hell do I know? Here, though, there's not enough to balance out any of the hops' attack, so it just comes across as too much for no real reason. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a decent enough IPA, but the hops here just go too far for the beer's own good, a position I've found myself in somewhat often lately when it's come to Stone..."

"The taste is well done as well, but shows off its session able qualities having a slightly thinner mouthfeel. Citrus and pine are at the forefront. Lively carbonation, but leaves me wanting for a bit more body to handle the hop assault."
""
""
""
""
"While the flavor drop off is a bit disquieting, the hop profile is one of the very best I've ever had in a single IPA. So even though this beer isn't perfect, I'd still recommend it highly, and I'll still be drinking plenty of it throughout the rest of the summer."

"O: Who says session beers can't be good?"
""
""

"Overall, a good IPA. Would have been nice to have found out when it was bottled since the bottle tells me to drink it fresh, but I guess I can go to the Stone website for that."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I wish this one was in six-packs. Can't say enough good things about this brewery. Well done. Would I drink it again? Yes."
"O: This beer aims to do one thing: maintain full flavor while creating a lighter ambiance. It achieves both, as it would have to go in as the best sessionable IPA I've had yet. Great balance of flavors throughout."

"Pours a nice orangy-straw color, with decent head, especially for a low abv beer. Very clear. The smell is strong hops, definitely some citrus, also some skunky, oniony aroma as well. The taste follows suit and is surprisingly strong for a lighter beer. However, there's a bitter aftertaste that sticks to your mouth and really detracts from the beer. Mouthfeel is good; it does not feel like a low abv beer. Overall, it's a VERY impressive showing in the session ipa catergory, that just suffers from too much bitterness in the finish. If that went away (and maybe the skunky side of the hops got toned down a tad), I would declare it the best bottled session ipa I've ever had."

"O - A solid session IPA that does not ask the IPA drinker to give up any of the hop experience. Delicious, and satisfying. I'm not sold on the overall value of session IPAs, but this is a beer I'd drink regardless."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice work by Stone to execute a low-alcohol, high-hopped IPA. This is not an entry-level IPA despite the low ABV - it's basically a big, bold IPA where the hops are big and the alcohol is far in the background."

"Pours a hazed pineapple hue with a two finger head and clingy lacing,the smell is just like tropical punch with strong pineapple and citrus along with some sherbet very vibrant smelling,the feel is light to medium bodied with soft carbonation and has tastes of pineapple,tangerine,mangoes and finished with a lemon sherbet bitterness and overall would be great to session on in the summer and definately worth a bottle or two cheers."

"O: Not as smooth or delicious as expected. Alpha session is way creamier and lighter. This is a light ipa, but to me it wasn't as enjoyable as it could have been. Rough hop profile maybe."
""
"Strong hops flavor with low EtOH makes this a great summer beer. It has a unique citrus flavor. On opening there was very little ""pffft"" which resulted in a small head on pouring into a frozen beer glass. It's one of my favorite IPAs so far..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Word: Appropriately named, as this beer’s claim to fame is how drinkable it is; it’s a great beer to keep a sixer of in your fridge for warm weather drinking. The hop forward profile gives you a big, juicy, citrusy hop punch right up front, but with an almost completely clean finish. Speaking of the finish, that’s my only complaint with this beer; it cleans up so well that you actually miss the flavors that could be there. I don’t mind a clean finish per se, but the finish here sees the flavors completely disappearing, which makes it extremely drinkable and light feeling, but condemns it to only being a beer suitable for drinking while you’re out grilling in the sun. Pick some up if that’s the case, but outside of the aforementioned sun-baked-patio scenario, most drinkers seeking an IPA will want something more complex and robust."
""
""
""
"This really is my go to IPA. Good yellow color. Very little head. Sweet and bitter hoppy taste. Full feeling beer. When you drink this beer the first taste is sweet but quickly followed by a enjoyable bitter citrus flavour. Again this really is a ""go to"" beer."

"Overall: Whereas I like Stone and have come to find their signature taste pleasing I do not like this beer and wouldn't purchase it again. I think some people develop loyal followings and rate high because of that. I can't see how this beer deserves such high marks. It's way more citral, floral, bitter, and hoppy than a beer with this low ABV should be. Think Ruination but with an off-putting pledge after taste."

"O- This beer has some nice full hops flavor but they are pretty mellow and not that bright in flavor for the hops listed on the bottle. This was a nice beer but the pungent bitterness that hangs on in the aftertaste made this not very sessionable for me."
"It's actually also pretty bad for the Stone IPA that this is actually a better beer, for all it's balance issues. My experience with Stone Brewery has been quite enigmatic. They either screw the prom queen, or screw the pooch, and there really isn't much in between."

"Pours a hazy, golden color. 2/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of strong pine, strong floral hops, slight citrus, slight sweet malt, and hint of pale malt. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is a strong bitterness and slight dryness. Tastes of strong piney hops, pine, hint of citrus, hint of floral, slight sweet malt, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, strong aroma, simple aroma and body, but fresh and the lack of alcohol makes for a really good beer."
"Overall: Coming into this brew, I was looking for a good session IPA and I think I may have found the perfect brew. Goes down somewhat smooth, but lower ABV makes it totally drinkable. Very surprised with this lower ABV that the flavor is so full and pure. Would love to have this brew on-tap and would have again...and again and would definitely recommend to a friend. Cheers!"

"Poured out a light, cloudy gold with a light, creamy white head. The head has light retention and leaves a smattering of lacing. The aroma is great with big floral and citrus hops notes and great balance of malt. The taste is every-so-slightly smaller than the aroma, but it closely matches and is still delicious. It has a thinner body for all its flavors and is still a great session IPA."

"Stone GoTo IPA - 4.5% ABV. Much bigger on taste than the ABV would hint at. Pours crystal clear wheat yellow with fairly active carbonation. Frothy head reduces to excellent lacing and thin frothing. All grapefruit, oranges, and hibiscus aromas. Smooth grapefruit and hops nose. Mid-palate it sours and the bitterness comes through. IPA style hops, Fresca overtones, and a little wheat nibble. Slight pine and crisp cloves on the back palate with bodl grapefruit lingering into the aftertaste. Very drinkable. Refreshing. Crisp mouthfeel. Brillant on a warm day in a cold glass. More than a Shandy, but less than an IPA. Overall very good. 3.8 out of 5. Good. Recommended."

"Overall this is a masterful brewing job! Take it for what it is meant to be - a true session IPA! To coax this much flavor out of a 4.5% abv brew is incredible. Too bad Stone does not can..."
""
""

"Overall 3.0: Just an OK beer from Stone and certainly nothing special. This beer is obsessed with being dry and drinkable and fails miserably at every level. Stone is usually a dependable brewery, but I definitely would not recommend this one."

"Poured a clear amber yellow with a one finger white head that quickly receded to a ring of white foam. A nice looking light IPA appearance. Scents of citrus zest, grapefruit and pine resin upfront, with undertones of tropical fruit, orange, onion and cat urine and very faint hints of malt sweetness. A good West Coast IPA aroma profile, though nothing too out of the ordinary. Flavor is extremely bitter upfront, with pine resin and bitter citrus pith dominating. This moves into more forward flavors of bitter citrus pith and floral undertones with a bit less pine resin. Finish is again heavy on pine resin, along with bitter citrus pith and some floral notes. Aftertaste is bitter pine resin, citrus pith and faint floral notes. A very aggressively hop-forward flavor profile with no discernible malt flavors. Great if you love hops, particularly the varieties used in West Coast IPAs, terrible and undrinkable if you don't. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate-high carbonation and a watery feel. Expected and true to form for a session IPA. Overall this is an excellent session IPA for those who love West Coast versions of the style. The aroma and flavor profiles are top notch and allow the hop character to shine through without any malt getting in the way. The mouthfeel is light and makes this one go down easy as well. A treat for hop lovers, terrible for anyone else."
""
"Overall - For a light session IPA I'd say this is pretty decent, the hop flavor is nice but it lacks elsewhere and winds up tasting like thin hop juice. But as far as a 4.5% IPA goes, impressive."
""
"Overall this is definitely a good beer and like it's name says, can definitely be a 'Go To' middle of the road IPA. Stone rarely dissapoints and IPA's are most definitely their forte."
""
"I love the sudden appearance of self-designated session beers, and this is the best of the low-alcohol IPAs I've had. Very good. I do wish it was available in a can, though."

"O: I would much rather have stone's own levitation ale then this. They have around the same ABV, but I feel leviation has more malt and hop flavor. And if you dont care about calories just have there normal IPA. That said, I could easily drink these all day on a hot summer day."

"While a huge fan of stone ipa; this ""session"" aka light ipa is only ok. The hop flavor is there, but not overpowering to leave your taste buds satisfied. The color and smell of the beer are point on..taste lacks a bit. Overall, a summer IPA to enjoy on the beach."
"Yep!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An interesting and innovative brew. I applaud Stone for thinking outside the box. However, I think they should also think outside the box with their marketing - don't jump on the low ABV IPA bandwagon by trying to call this an IPA, because it just isn't. Be innovative in your marketing as well as your brewing. I would not buy this again - if I want an IPA, I want a real IPA..."
""
"O: This is a respectable session IPA, but I was expecting just a little more considering Stone's almost unparalleled talent for crafting hoppy ales."

"o - Overall a nice nose on it, but the taste is a little weak and quite bitter. Personally I was a bit disappointed with this one and I would just go for an Enjoy By or normal Stone IPA before this again. If I was looking for a lower ABV beer, I'd personally just grab Founder's ALL Day IPA over this again."

"B,otter picked up locally, still fairly fresh. Pours like an IPA with a hazy yellow look and a foamy head streaky lacing. The nose on this brew is fantastic, probably one of the better smelling IPAs I have had, especially for a session IPA. The taste is nice, but much like the others in this new popular style, kind of tastes and feels like a watered down IPA. Really nice session, and one of the better ones. Will it be my go to IPA? Probably not, but for session IPAs or an IPA for guests not looking for a 7%+ brew, perhaps."
""
"Absolutely world class!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a huge bubbly beige head that persists forever before sticking lots of lace on the sides. Dank resinous earthy pine fills my nostrils. Bits of green onion and a hint of bread round things out in the aroma. The flavor is moderate earthy spicy pine hop flavor with a thin light bready malt beneath. Light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a thin somewhat watery mouthfeel. This one has light and refreshing down, I could probably drink a ton of these on a warm summer's day. Unfortunately, I don't think I would, the body for me is too light and I hate to say this, but I want more maltiness. Nothing horrible or flawed here, but this one is not for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Highly recommended as far as session IPA's go. Why not just call it a west coast pale ale though."
""
"O - tastes like a much bigger beer than the ABV would indicate. This one is a winner."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice lighter IPA from Stone. It definitely shares a pedigree with some of its higher-ABV brothers. I'd typically prefer a fuller IPA, but this would be great on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To summarize, Go To is essentially a hop delivery system, which I can definitely get behind. Very easy drinking and an ideal session beer for hop heads. One of the better session “IPAs” that have hit the market recently. Founders All Day, Lagunitas DayTime and local fave Kuhnhenn Fluffer are comparable but definitely not as piney or dank as Go To. Impressive stuff when fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: yes a session beer, great for hopheads who want the hop and not the bitter. Definitely, a hop aroma beer but its surprisingly easy on the bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A heck of a lot of foam fills the glass and slowly recedes, loads of tiny bubbles racing up the body. Fresh citrus in the aroma. Flavor has some cedar plank, bit of minerals and a lemony finish. Finishes quite clean."

"Very tasty here...I'm glad Stone did this, and I'm glad there are more of these types of beers coming out!"

"I bought this because i like stone brewing and the bottle design caught my eye. I poured a 45 degree bottle into my Tree house brewing tulip glass. The color was good for a session brew. It was a darker golden color. When I brought the glass to my nose I was surprised by the awesome bouquet of hops. The taste of this beer was totally opposite of the nose. I was expecting a smooth flavorful taste and got a real bitter thin mouth feel. I feel is they took the bitterness down 3 notches that this would be a very good to great session ipa."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is simply one of the most sessionable sessions in session history. Hoppier than many non-session IPAs. Citrusy, acidic, bight hops, up front and in back. No malt balance -- screw that. Probably the best sub-5% APV beer I've ever had. I want to marry it. As usual, Stone delivers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fresh citrus on the nose--notes of candied orange slices and grapefruit. Body is bubbly and a bit thin on the finish. A more subtle hop profile on the palate, but it's kind of overwhelmed by the slightly harsh, husky bitterness of the malt. Not sure about the lofty reviews for this one; maybe I got a bad bottle?"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A great session beer, but then again, its a session beer"
""
""
""
""
"If you are a fan of limes and like fairly easy-drinking beer I'd recommend a Stone Go To IPA."
"Overall: Most flavorful beer around this abv. I've had to date. Blows my mind how they can make a beer as or more aromatic and flavorful than some IPA's or even DIPAs with less abv. than my PBR! Perhaps even too bitter for me, especially to be sessionable. I haven't had Enjoy By, but this reminds me of Dirt Wolf toned down a few notches. Amazing example of a low abv beer without sacrificing taste, which is all I want sometimes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer! I had a bottle of this wonderful brew at World of Beers. The color, aroma and taste were superb, this is a must have beer that you will enjoy; it is by no means a lawnmower beer, it is up there with Dogfish head IPA one of my favorites....and remember folks continue to drink beer and support your local brewery. HOG"
""
"Another great from Stone. Definitely my go to beer, I love the fact that they were able to fully deliver on the hop character, which is absolutely perfect as this beer comes in at just 4.5%. This is an all occasion beer and I like to have several pints because of the low abv. Enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy golden with short lived, fluffy white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of citrusy hops, bready malt, piney and fruity notes. Body is full and crisp. Taste is of, citrusy herbal hops, buiscit malt and lemon zest. Finish is long, and very bitter. There is some mismatch of hop profile in this brew."
""
""
"Overall - It's flavorful for a session IPA. Rivals All Day IPA, but they have taken a different approach."
"Overall: lovey session beer, would buy again and again. super fresh taste. some better beers in this category out there but they are hard to get."
"This is a nice session beer made by stone that incorporates excellent IPA qualities into a 4.5% ale, without making a mess. Super thirst quenching and full of flavor, this baby IPA drinks like a light lager but tastes like a citrus and pine bomb all in one. But it doesn't smack your palate around, its well crafted and balanced. Taste is slightly herbal and fruity, mouthfeel is spritzy, and the citrus component is right on the mark."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"The taste is alive with floral and grassy hops with the mildly sweet malts harmonizing and balancing it all out. Maybe a 70-30 hop to malt note but still feels balanced. Bitter ending."
"Bottle from Tipples. Pours a perfectly clear light golden color with a one finger creamy white head. Big hops aroma with pineapple, honey, grapefruit, citrus peel, grass. Flavor is light malts stuck behind bright grassy hops with notes of citrus peel and pineapple throughout. Medium bitter. Light bodied with plenty of carbonation, finishing slightly dry. Probably the best of the light IPAs."

"Great American IPA!!! Nice bitter Hoppy taste to it... This beer has a distinct taste to it like no other beer.. This American IPA almost stands out on its own.. Love this beer.. Certainly one of my favorite American IPA's.. Stone definitely has to be on of the best brewer's and this beer compliments there art..."
"Looked great in the glass and smelled amazing. Taste was basically pine, hop bitterness, and straw. Light mouthfeel. I'm generally a huge fan of Stone and their beers, but this one just wasn't for me. It smelled wonderful, but everything else was just too light for my tastes. I guess once you've had Ruination, its hard to accept anything less."

"A great beer all around. My second beer was overchilled, and it seemed more bitter at first. The sweet malts started to shine as the beer warmed, and it became more well rounded. I'm definitely a big fan of Stone's uber hoppy brews."
""
""
"O -This brew manages to somehow have lost most of the hop flavor but ratcheted up the bitterness. Not even in my personal top-5 for the ""Session IPA"" style."
""
"Overall this is the first session IPA I could say I would drink again but 9 chances out of 10 I would just go for the stone IPA before this light version. It was good!"
"Good beer, exact to what Stone is trying to accomplish. I'd love to have this right next to an All Day IPA from Founders and see which one I like better. This is on my ""to do"" list for the summer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: very drinkable, so points for that. At first the piney hops were not strongly working for me, but in this session context they aren't bad at all. I'd still like to see more beers in this vein."
"O: A very hop-forward session beer. I'm pretty sure the guys at Stone are physically unable to brew beer that's not extreme in any way, but that's totally alright with me - they always craft winners, this one being no exception. A superb summer brew for hopheads; if it wasn't so expensive ($12+ a six-pack), I'd have it in my fridge all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I consider this beer much like their Levitation. It's not their usual M.O. of palate-wrecking or boldness, but a very crisp, clean IPA. Refreshing for the warm weather, and an excellent alternative to their standard IPA."

"MF – Medium light bodied, good carbonation is felt on the palate, a dry finish. 4.25"
""

"O: very flavorful and smells great"

"Poured a cloudy golden body with amazing head and lace ring. The aroma is fresh, earthy hops that have a bitter citric tint to them and possible tropical fruit. Smooth, easy to drink, the hops are not overpowering and that's the point with a IPA that is designed to be less hop heavy and boozy and more sessionable. Does an admirable job as the hop presence is good, light, citrusy, malts are ok with minor sweetness. Not bad but something that takes accustomed to as compared to other IPAs it is a bit thin. Worth a try and I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"Brilliant golden colored with excellent clarity. A half inch of white head rests on top. Brussels lacing. Intense and fresh grapefruit hop aroma greets me. The taste is bitter grapefruit hops. The bitterness is pretty long lasting after the fade. The mouth is a bit sticky,but less than expected for such an intensely flavorful brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - nice flavor profile here. Of all the session IPA's I've tried and been fairly let down with, this is my winner. I'd still just prefer to drink a regular IPA, but this is good for what it is. I actually may have a craving for this one this summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great aromatic beer, but the level of initial bitterness and light finish seem a bit out of balance for my taste, but still a really nice beer to give a try. Particularly suited for enjoying on a warm sunny afternoon."

""
""

"Regardless, it's definitely not as bitter or intense (or sweet) as many of Stone's other beers, and this really benefits from having something to munch on alongside its consumption. I found garlic brie to be a good complimentary side snack, as well as a rich chicken or fish soup on a warm day outside. It's inoffensive, and perhaps a bit overpriced for what it delivers, but I definitely enjoyed it overall."
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was nice example of a session IPA, but I felt like the green onion hop profile held it back from being as good as it could be and those green onion flavors kind of clashed with the tropical fruit hop flavors. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, very crisp, not too filling, and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention and I think the carbonation might wear on me. It's smooth enough for a session IPA, but the flavors don't hold my attention like others in the style, so one or two would be my limit. What I like the most about this beer was the tropical fruit hop aspect and the appearance I thought they were both pretty good and the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the green onion hop aspect, it just isn't for me and I think it clashed with the other hop flavors. I don't think I would get this beer again, I think I would buy some All Day IPA instead. I might recommend this to people who like Session IPA's, but I don't think it's a must try. All in all this was a Solid Session IPA, but it had some aspects that held it back from being a great beer and stand out for the style. As it is I think it's falls right in the middle for session IPA's and it's for sure not my favorite Stone beer. Solid job, but I think with a little work this could be a standout for the style, better luck next time guys."

"Overall: I am a fan of session IPAs; it's nice to get through three beers with friends and not be much affected by alcohol. I love the citrus notes, and would definitely buy this in hot weather. However, my go-to session IPA is still Founder's All Day. It's higher in alcohol, but overall a more solid beer."

"A bit of an overall miss for Stone. It's got a unique hop profile, but it lacks any kind of depth and just drinks like a bitter hop seltzer."
"Overall: Great refreshing IPA! There are not any aspects that I would change, but the nose really steals the show!"

"Overall: A good use of citrus, which is always welcome in an IPA."

"Wow. Stone has done it again. Pours light straw golden color, with fairly decent head and nice lacing on the pint glass. Smell punches you for a session IPA. Big fruit nose, smells super fresh. Taste is phenomenal for what one would call a session brew. This would a great converter brew to offer a friend that isn't into the big DIPA's. Has the characteristics of a much bolder ABV brew in something that is very refreshing and sessionable. Mouthfeel is on point as well. Refreshing, not overly heavy and nice carbonation balance. Overall, an easy choice to buy again. Highly recommended."
"mostly clear, maybe a touch of cloud, not much head or lace. pale gold with barely any orange. great smelling beer: herbal, grassy, smells like nature but with a pale malt backing. you get some of that hop greatness in the taste, but only a little. light/crisp sweetness; vegetal/floral/grapefruit bitterness. great feel, especially being 4%."
"O - Overall, this is a solid, solid IPA offering from stone. A fresh 6 pack of this would get demolished in the fridge on a hot summer day."

"Served in a shaker pint. Pours a dull orange-gold with a slight haze to the clarity and a fluffy, half-inch, bright white head. Nose reveals cat pee; I'm guessing Simcoe. There's also a hint of citrus and an earthiness once you get past the urine smell. Taste is a bit biscuity, followed by some citrus - cat pee is not as present in the flavor profile. There's also a light, lingering earthy/herbal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation that falls just shy of prickly. Overall, not bad, but definitely not a ""go to"" beer for me."

"O: A very tasty ""session"" IPA from Stone. I would certainly drink this again."

"Overall: Stone joins the session IPA crowd with Go To IPA. It is similar to others I've had in the style in that it is really hoppy and dry with little to no malt flavor holding it up. Good for a quicky hop infusion. I've never actually tried to ""session"" one of these types of beers, I think I'd rather have fewer beers with more flavors than more of a ""one note"" beer."
""
""
"O: Tasty and easy to drink. Two things will prevent this from being a true ""Go To"" IPA in my book: it isn't my personal favorite hop profile, and trying a second while taking down a pizza resulted in the spice/onion hop flavors coming out huge - which was not an improvement. Still, good and one that I'll gladly drink the rest of the six-pack."
"Light, bright and full of flavor. Super smooth, easy drinker here. Lots of bright florals and citrus: huge grapefruit flavor. Bears some resemblance to Stone's recent Stochasticity Grapefruit IPA. Light feel, medium bodied, some malt character. Great beer, and good competition for Firestone's Easy Jack."

"Overall, this is an impressive low ABV IPA. ""Session"" IPAs usually taste watery to me, but this one, while not big in body, was definitely not watered down. It has some almost Belgian blonde/saison characteristics that, paired with the resinous hop backbone, makes for an interesting brew."

"Certainly a good beer. Enjoyable, even subtle, and not as in your face as other Stone products. Which I wanted to love. I do like this, and will be sure to pick up some more when I get the chance. Though, All Day and Pale 31 are still my favorites for this pseudo/sub style."

"After the initial, typical pale malt presence, the hop comes in as a total bomb. It's harsh and unforgiving. Interestingly, the aftertaste is not big, but it lingers. I like it with some hesitation. The complexity is interesting but the flavor is non-traditional. The body and carbonation is pretty conventional for the style."

"I decided to give Stone another chance. Maybe it was old, maybe it was me, circumstances of a vast array can make you love or hate a beer or for anything for that matter. I consider myself someone who can handle the IBU's I like hoppy beers and had some monsters that I loved. Which brings me to my point, I tried Arrogant Bastard and hated it, this was before my reviewing days so I may revisit it. I have been hearing a lot from friends and various other sources that the Enjoy By series is something I should try, I have two 4/20/14's in the fridge as we speak, but today I also ran across a six pack of this stuff it was on sale for $10, so I figured what the hell, I can go home this weekend watch the Masters and try a variety of brews and since this one is only 4.5% something I can get into. Now to the review, wow, I was really impressed. It has a lot of wonderful hop flavor and aroma without too much assertive bitterness with a very pleasant drinkability. Its pale, not really an IPA more of just a PA but its really good and if it were in the $8-9 range I could see myself drinking this frequently, but as I said it was on sale for $10 and that was down from $12. At $12 I can find better stuff, it was worth seeking out, and the price point was good, today, but they need to work on that a bit. Which is my only complaint. I think the ratings above are close to right on, but I would maybe move it up to low 90's."

Tip of the hat to you Stone, this is a masterpiece."

"O - Solid IPA, especially for a lower alcohol, session IPA. Plenty of hop flavor and bitterness, perhaps a bit overdone and a bit harsh in its hop bitterness. Certainly something I could easily be happy having more of. Session IPA's are starting to become more prevalent and creating a competitive style. Not my favorite session IPA, but still a good one."

"Transparent orange in body with thin white head. Mild aroma of mint, evergreen, and citrus. Tastes of light lemon, strong citrus rind and grass, mint, and then bitterness and a sweet citrus spritz ends the drink. Light in body with light carbonation. Easy drinking but the flavor profile is too pronounced for the thin body."

"O- pretty impressive that they managed to pack this much hop flavor into a beer that is under 5% abv, I'd definitely by it again when in need of a session beer"

"O-This is a tasty session-style IPA, and I would not expect anything less from Stone. The beer is a bit rough around the edges, but the hop flavors are relatively complex (I like the citrus and herbal notes) and there is enough malt to balance things out. It drinks like a lighter beer thanks to the airy feel and lower ABV, but the flavor is up to snuff. I could see drinking more of this beer this summer."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This new low-gravity IPA from Stone is the veritable face of the modern IPA in 2014. Hops qualities could scarcely not be more appealing and, at the same time, challenging in the best possible way. The marketing boasts of 'hop bursting' as a novel brewing technique that is responsible for this beer's character; one may naively assume that it is pure hype, but the results suggest otherwise. IPA has attained the next level in this beer."

"The aftertaste was as good as the start.. Clean and crisp, leaving a dry rewarding taste and just making you want another one!"

"Go-to-ipa beer pours a bright golden yellow color with a finger of head. The aroma is big with a strong scent of grapefruit and little bit of lemon. The taste is interesting. Lemon comes through the strongest with a grassy quality as well, but grapefruit doesn't translate over from the smell. I understand that this is session ipa, but this is almost too light. The hop presence is definitely big, but the lack of a malt backbone detracts for me. The flavor starts out great with a big lemony hop burst, but without the malt it fades out and has a funny after taste. This is a solid beer, but it wont be a go to for me. (79/100)"
""
"Pours clear and golden with a finger width foamy head. Lacing on the side of the glass is average. Strong lemon smell. The odor is very hoppy and bitter. When you drink it, there is a strong lemony taste with a pronounced bitterness at the end. It is a crisp, refreshing beer. Very little in the way of malt quality. Good beer but probably wouldn't buy again, unless it was only thing available. The strong lemon quality has to grow on me."

""

"I really like this beer. It drinks very well and reminds a bit of dirt wolf."

"Outstanding color and smell if you like hops and fruit. I have been waiting for this consistency for a long time. Others want more alcohol, but as it is a ""go to"" session beer, I have no problem with the 4.7. I do have an issue with the price. It is $10 a six pack? Maybe the hops are expensive, but it seems high for low alcohol content. However, it is a GREAT refreshing brew for those of us wanting crazy citrus flavor and a satisfying, non metal aftertaste."
""
""
"Notes: It's a blast of hops, but so is their regular ipa. I'm loving how quickly Stone has been getting beer on the shelves. Very low alcohol on this one."
"Overall? This beer kicks Founders All Day and Sierra Nevads Nooner out of the water! Stone is KILLING it right now! Always loved Stone, this just makes me love them more. Im glad I could purchase a single bottle though, because $12-13 for a 4.5% 6er is way too much, sorry. Wish it was in bombers."

"Poured into a Stone gargoyle pint. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a thin white head that dissipates to wispy patches. Nice aroma of citrus hops, mostly grapefruit and lemon, hints of tropical fruit. Flavor is grapefruit centric citrus hops, a bit dank, lemon and grapefruit rind, light bready malt, finishes a bit thin, but with assertive lemon rind bitterness. Light to medium bodied. Nicely hopped for a session ale, but the hops seem a bit stark without the support of a more substantial body. As expected from Stone, well made and nicely hopped. I guess maybe session IPAs may not be a style for me, I'd just as soon have a higher ABV, more balanced IPA than a couple of lighter ones. Within the realm of session IPAs however, this is a tasty one."
""
"O-a good session IPA with many out there this is more of the same but still very good effort"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is my second session IPA and I enjoyed it. However, it seems as though this new sub-style is just a genius marketing gimmick. I don't quite understand the need for a session IPA when we have pale ales. Perhaps its because pale ales were becoming more like IPAs with more alcohol content and flavor. My biggest issue is the mouthfeel-its so thin it frustrates me at times, but at the same time I believe it might be very enjoyable in the summer when I want something flavorful but not too heavy. I'm just perplexed with the style at the moment because I think it shows remarkable craftsmanship to have such hop flavor in a low alcohol beer but at the same time pale ales are more complex in some regards."
"Not bad for what is very much a session beer. Smells great, however it tastes a little watered down. Not surprising based on the IPA. Still, it's an IPA you can drink a lot of, and it still tastes better than a lot of others. Pleased with it, but not running out to get more when a six of stone IPA is the same price."

""
"O: A uniquely horrible experience."
""
""

"O/D-I enjoyed the aroma more than the flavor but despite that, the flavor was still amazing. They really must have dry hopped the Christ out of this brew. A hop bomb you can drink all night. Pretty staggering how hoppy this is at such a low ABV."
""
"A delicious, fruit-forward, light IPA. Enjoyed out of the bottle. It poured very clear into the glass, almost a pilsner light. The mouthfeel was also light, but as that fits super-well with the style, so I like it. The kind of beer to have when I'm having ... anything, really. The flavor is mostly citrus, with some light grassiness for good measure. Hoppy, but not overly bitter. I would get this again, for sure, would like to find on tap."

"o: Actually tastes and feels better and more substantial than might be expected of a ""session"" IPA. Compared to Lagunitas Day Time and SN's new Nooner, Go To would be tied with Nooner as the one to go to, if price was not a consideration. This single ran $2.30, the most of the three. I have only seen sixpacks of this at one store so far, and they were $12.29, still over $2 each bottle. But it's worth it. You certainly do not feel you are sacrificing any flavor or hopitude just because it is a low ABV ""session IPA."""
"Pours a clear yellow orange with thick white head that settles slowly leaving rings of chunky lace down the glass. Smell: whiff of apricot, white grape, lots of grapefruit and resin. Aggressive hop aromas. Taste: lots of citrus upfront, grapefruit flesh, piney and herbal edges. Oily, nice bitterness, light bodied with a hop soaked drying finish. Everyone else can give up on the session IPA style."

"The beer pours a fairly light white creamy head that dissipates quickly but leaves a lot of lacing. The beer itself is golden yellow and clear. The beer smell is mainly hoppy with a strong grapefruit smell as well as a lemon smell. There also appears to be a light malt backbone that comes off as bready. The taste is slightly different. The main flavor is dominated by the grapefruit hops with a slight bready malt backbone that is very light. The mouthfeel is very light and a little bit watery as well with biting carbonation. Overall, a pretty session IPA that tastes like an IPA but without the heaviness."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Overall, a very hop forward beer and a wonderful flavor and aroma profile. However....apparently I like more malt backbone to complement all those hops. This is good though, and while sessionable, I have to stop at one. This is too much flavor for me to have another one of right away. By itself, great - one bottle is enough. More than that....too much. So a very good beer, but not as drinkable as I thought it would be. More to savor over that session I think."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad offering and probably up near the top of this particular sub-style. However, I have a hard time bringing myself to drink more than one of these given the relatively straightforward, bordering on boring, taste. Which ironically defies one of the purposes of a session beer--to be able to drink multiple over several hours and not be completely bombed. My liver would do quite well with a bunch of these. My tastebuds, however, would not."

"Packed with intense flavor! Well done, Stone."
"Session IPAs are poised to push the venerable saison off its teetering pedestal as the beer style-du-jour. I'm of two worlds concerning this development - one, I lurve me my Alpha-rific hops, and could well do with them not making me speak in tongues after one freaking serving, and yet two, how is this just not a hopped-up APA? Comes down to meta wankery, I suppose, and my eyes are already drooping at the thought, and honey, it ain't the booze."
"another entry into the latest fad. a fad for now, but i think its here to stay. session hop forward beers are fun, good in all weather, and add a new layer to what we mean when we think about crushable beer, but stones offering is a little short of some of the best in the business, although still quite tasty. where others fail, this succeeds. it is truly sessionable in terms of abv and feel, which is definitely light and bright. great bubbling fizz and a tongue tickle with only low body, works. what doesnt work for me, at least compared to founders all day, which continues to be the measuring stick in this arms race of demilitarized india pale ales, is the raging bitterness that comes on early and lingers late. i dont want or need all that here, just add the hops to the boil a bit later, preserve some aromatics and save some bittering for the next brew guys. its not offensive or anything, this is rock solid beer through and through, but it lacks the citrusy or at least dominant hop flavor that isnt just bitterness. the smell shows it a little and the first sip confirms it. thats being critical though, because this really is outstanding beer, but with so many going right now, i think this takes a bronze medal in the field at the time being, some of the more obsucre beers like bikini from evil twin not withstanding."
"O: Super hop heavy session IPA. The hoppiest session beer out there in my opinion. As far as hop profile this blew Founders All Day out of the water, specifically in the aroma. Also better mouthfeel than All Day. However, after a couple of these your tongue may need a break from the astringency which kind of negates the purpose of a session beer. And in that case, All Day becomes the better session, while Go To is clearly the better IPA."

"Overall (4.0): The taste, aroma, and feel of this beer are all quite nice—the one thing that’s seriously lacking is the appearance. Seriously. It looks good at first, albeit a little anemic in the body, and then has no endurance at all. But, hey, looks aren’t everything. The aroma is hands-down the strongest aspect of the beer, and the taste and feel are both solidly above average the taste slightly moreso, but not by much. Either way, I’d say this is a somewhat better stab at the “Session IPA” trend than others I’ve had, and worth paying about $10/sixer. Unfortunately, this was $12.99 for me, like most stone sixers, and at that price I’m not sure it’s worth getting more than once."
""
""
"Overall, meh, not really up to par with the other Stone IPAs IMO, so much dankness, resin, cat pee, forest floor, etc, with no malt to help it so it just goes rampant and smashes your taste."
""
""
"Another very fine brew from stone! I like the low ABV, high taste of this one. Smooth and even a bit creamy, with citrus and piney flavors and aromas, plus a solid malty base. Drinks more like one of stone's regular IPAs, but without as much punch due to the lower alcohol. Hopefully I can find this one locally because I'd love to get a sixer on the way home tonight."

"O-Very impressive at only 4.5%. A great sessionable IPA."

" The taste is great -strong citrus with lots of herbal dankness and tropical fruity flavor with some light malt in the background and hits of hop astringency like a tea with that gentle grassy hint and subtle grapefruit bitterness lingers. Overall this is one of the better examples of a 'session IPA I have had - plenty of hops giving the impression of a more hoppy regular strength..very good for a small beer"
""

"Stone has been one of my favorite breweries for years. Maybe that is why I am a bit disappointed with this offering. In the past, they have produced some fantastic IPAs. This just kind of falls flat. They could have done better if they just watered down some Stone IPA, or Ruination, or <insert awesome Stone IPA here>. I'll stick with Founders All Day or Lagunitas DayTime if I'm in the mood for the style."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 5/25/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of huge peach, mango, passion fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops with a fair amount of malt balance; with great strength. Taste of big peach, mango, pineapple, passion fruit, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors with a fair amount of malt sweetness; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is an awesome session IPA! All around great complexity of bright hop flavors with a fair amount of malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: Admittedly, session IPAs are new to me (considering I choose to session with bigger IPAs) and this is my first actual experience with one. While it's certainly not a bad brew and it without-a-doubt pummels most beers of similar ABV that people choose to session with, I just find myself not overly impressed with it. I appreciate the attempt to make a sessionable IPA, but when I drink an IPA, I do so for the flavors and this one doesn't deliver as much as I'd hoped... Still a decent option in the future, I suppose."

"I love Stone Brewing Co,. so perhaps I am being a bit harsh in my assessment which is unimpressed. Poured into a pint glass, no head whatsoever. The color is a light honey, diluted caramel. Not much for the nose expect some distant pine. Front of mouth is fairly tasteless with a little fizz and the finish is tarry pine on the roof of my mouth. Not much else going on. Seems to me the marketing department said they should do a session beer and this is what we got -- certainly not a labor of love and I won't be buying again."
"Pours a crystal clear golden copper color. A one finger white head. The nose is all hops, citrus, pine and very astringent with a touch of wheat. The flavor is intensely crisp at first. A fruity and floral hop flavor takes over, lots of orange peel and lemon. Reminds me of a smaller Enjoy By IPA. The mouthfeel is of course rather light. But the beer outdoes it's % by a lot. I would have never guessed 4.5 and its hard to imagine how they got so much flavor into a beer the size of Bud light. I could drink this one all day. Perhaps the best session IPA out there."
"I've been on a sessionable IPA kick lately, and greatly enjoy Daytime IPA from Lagunitas, a beer that is low in ABV, hoppy, balanced, and very drinkable. I was looking forward to trying Stone's entry into the sessionable IPA arena. What a disappointment! This beer (or at least the batch I got) suffers from a serious case of isovaleric acid off flavor. Isovaleric acid compounds are usually due to using stale or poorly stored hops, and result in off flavors best described as ""cheesy"". Sadly this is the dominant flavor and aroma on offer here - nasty, stale cheese. Not pleasant in the least, and definitely not what I expected. Drain pour I'm afraid."

"Bold hoppy nose, pleasantly hoppy on the palate. Easy drinking and quite enjoyable. Nice fresh tasting ""session"" IPA. Well worth a try and I expect this will be enjoyed again and again. Went great with some cheddar and crusty bread."

"12oz bottle. Pours bright yellowish golden color with a half inch of head. Fair amount of lacing. The aroma is sweet grapefruit and citrus. Tropical fruit notes. The taste isn't quite as flavorful as the aroma indicated. Sweet grapefruit, white grapes, and tropical fruits. Minimal malt flavor but there is some slight breadiness. Grapefruit bitterness at the finish. Light and crisp mouthfeel, of course. Overall, this is a solid offering in the ""Session IPA"" category but the heftier price tag makes All Day and Daytime IPA better choices."

"Pours out a crystal clear gold with constant carbonation movement and a bone white head. Smell is bursting with hops: sweet citrus, funky BO, herbs, allium, earth. Light aroma of pale, crackery malts. Flavor is full of hop character: lots of tropical fruits, garlic chives, and sweet citrus peel. Tastes of white bread-like malts. I get an earthy, floral, almost buttery hit from the hops, as I would from English hops. Finishes very dry and very bitter. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and bubbly. I really like this beer. What a nice surprise to find something so hoppy, without big sweetness or booze. My only complaint is the butter I pick up in the taste."

"Pours into a nonic a dull lighter golden with a half finger white head that fades quickly leaving a half ring of broken lace behind.Lighter aromas with grapefruit rind standing out most with a bit of toasted cereal grain as well.A big shot of grapefruit and lemon oil hits ya on the palate and lingers for quite awhile along with sweet biscuit in the finish,quite a nice shot of hops.Maybe the best ""session"" IPA I have had yet."

"O - A fan of the concept, but I'd have to a drink a six of these straight to see if the trade-off is worth it. The hop bursting does give it a more hop forward presence verses All Day IPA. You would think this was a 8%er. We'll see where the concept goes."

"I have been looking for a quality, accessible, reasonably priced IPA with an alcohol content that allows me to function after drinking. I believe this is the one. This has everything I like in an IPA; it is hoppy, citrusy, and delicious. I can drink six while watching my favorite sporting events and still be relatively coherent after and during. A big thumbs up to Stone for ending my 40 year search."
""
""

"O: Tasty and very easy to drink. It's like SNPA with a bit more hops."
""
""

"Taste offers spicy hop notes and an expected light malt delivery. Light and subtle bitterness follows. Feel is thinner than expected after watching 'tasting notes' video from Stone and is closer to what I would expect from such a light ABV IPA. Nothing magical in the end in that regard. The smell is the high point in my view, the rest leaves more questions than it answers."
""
""
"O- Someone else on the forums had said this was ""Enjoy By Light"" and I actually agree with them. That being said, I'd gladly pay the extra money per ounce for some actual Enjoy By once in a while rather than pay the lower difference for this on a regular basis."

"Overall - Pretty simple, its a low alcohol, session ipa. There's no balance, its just some hops, but the amount, the flavor and overall strength of them is what makes this light, im guessing around 100 calories , low sugar beer a winner. This beer just might be the trick for when im dying for a beer during a diet or during the workweek when I don't want big beer, high alcohol."

"Clear gold with a white cap of fine bubbles. More skim + collar than a full head. A bit of lacing. Grapefruit pith, almost zesty, juicy pineapple and a bit of resin. The aroma was initially sharp, but this seemed to help it stay fresh and lively from start to finish. Solid bitterness, but the star of the flavour was the citrus character -- grapefruit and tangerine, pithy and fruity, with a hint of tropical fruits and slight hop spice in the finish. Medium bodied with active carbonation, dry on the palate. Quite drinkable with a sturdy hoppiness that kept it refreshing."

"Not being a fan of bitterness or onion hop character, this is not my bag. Lack of malt and hop flavoring."

"Pours a clear light golden-orange with a small head that fades to a thin ring. Fresh, perfumy hop aroma of oranges, pine, kiwi, melon, and flowers. Tastes like pine needles mixed with tropical and citrus fruit. Moderate bitter, floral bite in the finish. It lacks any malt character at all but it’s a session IPA so I guess it’s sorta supposed to be that way. Mouthfeel comes off thin and watery."

"It's not a good complement to this cold night, but I could definitely imagine this hitting the spot during the peak of summer. Aromatic like Enjoy By but without the punch. More than anything, this makes me want Stone's regular IPA to be retooled with some ""new school"" hops."
""

"12 ounce bottle, stamp says enjoy by 05/14/14. Served in a DFH IPA glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like citrusy (grapefruit) hops, melon, and some bready malt. It tastes like citrusy (grapefruit, lemon peel) hops, bready malt, melon, mango, piney hops, and it also finishes bitter. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp, smooth and easy to drink. I thought this was a good overall brew, I'd buy this again."

"Overall – Now this does give you a nice dose of hop flavor in a low abv. beer. For me however there was not enough base to balance the beer, making it a bit to “hopped to be just overly hoppy” in flavor without a real balance. It is nice if you want a session with lots of hop, but otherwise if looking for a truly enjoyable and smooth drinking session well…."

"I love bitter and citrusy hop taste. Stone is one of the best at doing that. A nice citrusy smell and hop forward blow to the nose. The one taste and almost heaven. Now you will notice that the body of the stone IPA or big dog ruination aren't there but the taste and feel...awesome. I recommend this for any hop head that just wants the good well done hop flavor and feel with out the heaviness...enjoy."
"I could see this maybe being a beer for the summer heat. Easy to drink, but way too heavy on the onion notes for any real session enjoyment."
""
""

"The taste is a hop bomb, with very little malt characters. Mango, peach on the aroma. The taste is just that with that pine greatness. I don't get much grapefruit, but a slight taste as the beer warms. This beer has come out during the Session IPA explosion. I rank this one near the top."
""

"O: A very nice take on a session IPA - a type of IPA that I am partial to because I like to be able to have a few beers in a session without really feeling the effects. Slightly thin though that is something I expect in a session IPA but great flavors and aroma. I would get this one again as it is quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a golden-lemon coloring with a thin, low profile, clingy, white head. Aromas of tart lemon and grapefruit, rich resinous pine pitch notes, and a subtle candy sweetness. Flavors are a blast of lemon sweet and tart, pepper spice, and pine pitch forward, with a more subtle blending of citrus fruits as the beer crosses the palate. Crisp and effervescent throughout, keeping the beer extremely light and refreshing. A grapefruit bomb by the time you get to the aftertaste, with the pine notes now nothing more than a highlight. Crisp, dry finish. This is a very good beer, and easily drinkable. Bravo!"

"Just in time for the warmer weather, Stone's hoppy session ale, I will take it now and later. Look it's about time Stone went extreme with a session IPA abv 4.5% check, almost fizzy and yellow...check, and a new hop addition process, hop-bursted session IPA...check. All of the qualities I've been looking for in a beer, hop flavor without all of the miles on the hepatocytes (liver cells). This is the palest colored ale I've seen from Stone really bordering a shade or two darker than most fizzy yellow beers, bright white billowing head evenly dispersed head with some retention. Calorically speaking this could be my new diet beer, forget Michelob Ultra I will take the Stone Go To IPA when I try to lose extra lbs. Aromatics offer up some very pleasant hop notes dank citric notes, bitter pith, a hint of pine even some garlic notes, very pale mild biscuit malts give it an edge of bready malts in the background. Flavor wise, watered down IPA, but I can take it garlic/vegetal hop notes citric bitter lemon rinds with pale biscuit malts barely breaking through with any sweetness all the fermented sugars had to be converted into the minimal alcohol level this beer does have. I wonder what the original gravity was on this brew? Hop bursting is a success, hop flavor is here, light cereal grains a hint of alcohol and lingering bitterness in the finish it's a few notes of genius in each sip...we all seek complexity this is great for brushing your teeth with hop water, but for sustaining hophead cravings it's like taking a placebo...about 30% off my hop cravings have been met. Mouthfeel slightly textured with hop oils and mineral water carbonation comes off on the higher end due to the lighter bodied low carb hop head beer, this feels like. Overall, I will continue to drink it, it joins the rotation of Founders All Day IPA, and the Lagunitas DayTime IPA (which I haven't had yet)...Founders gets my nod so far...in cans if I can find them."

"Overall - thanks to Gene for bringing me a pair of these last night, along with an absolutely bitchin Stone beer glass made from a bomber of Arrogant. A fine session beer, hope to see this on tap somewhere."
"Crystal clear yellow body beneath a small, sticky white head. Pungent ruby red grapefruit, peach, mango, and resinous pine aromatics. Super hoppy, chuggable, refreshing flavor. Dank, oily hop resins, zesty citrus, herbs, miscellaneous tropical fruits. Pretty much nothing in the malt department. Light bodied, bitter, and crisp. Lots of great hop character in a light, easy-drinking format...what's not to like? My only wish is that this was priced more like DayTime, which is a more reasonable $8 a sixer for your sessioning pleasure."
"O - 4.25 - This is a great session IPA. It's still a hop bomb @ 4.5%"
"O: There's some great hop aroma and flavor to be had here, and true to its style it will sit lightly in the stomach and not throw you for a loop after a few pints. However, like most other session IPAs I've had, the lack of malt body really detracts from the drinkability. It feels too watery and the hop astringencies build to borderline unpleasant levels. In all fairness these are the same criticisms I've had of the vast majority of session IPAs I've tried to date. If you are a fan of the style, this will probably hit the spot for you."
"O- I am enjoying this and it is a very drinkable session IPA. I see myself picking up a 6-pack to enjoy on a nice spring day."
""
""
"Great beer to be sure, not just for the fact it's 4.5%. $2.19 for a single though? I could just buy a sixer of Two Hearted for less and call it a day. I can see the time and place for this beer no doubt, but the price is too high for my liking."
""
""
""
"O - Stone's love for the lupulin knows no bounds; I'm just surprised it's taken one of the masters of the hop this long to make a session IPA! Stone certainly perfected the beer before unleashing it, however. From it's bright, aromatic hop nose to the incredibly sessionable taste and crisp, drinkable body, Stone Go To IPA can certainly be one of my go-to session IPAs!"
"Pours with total clarity and a thick off-white head. Nose is bursting with hops, at first, but calms down a bit soon after. Flavor is not as boisterous as I would have liked, I suppose. Earthy hops with resin in there as well. Consistent and lasting. Personally, I like it with a good bit more punch. But for a casual beer, and a session ale, it's pretty good."
"Has a light/pale golden color. Aroma is certainly ""bursting"" with hops, some citrus rind and a slight hint of honey. Taste is very light, but quite well done. Lots of floral hoppy taste, citrus rind again and some pine as well."
""
""
""
""
"Its a marvel of a beer and one that can be taken down with a few quick drinks. But with its light alcohol content, I think I'll have another."
"An awesome new style that I want every part of. A great counterpart to All Day and DayTime. Maybe even better than the aforementioned."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and slight tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and grapefruit juice flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is easy to drink and has a great hop presence that comes through especially well in the aroma."
"O: Definitely at the top of the list when it comes to session IPAs. It tastes great, but I still prefer the classic IPA mouthfeel, so I won't be buying too many (also, there are just so many other beers to try out there). However, this might be my go to beer if I need one for when I go to my friend's parties (beer pong) and don't want to get tipsy. Also, this would be a great beer to get people into IPAs probably."

"A clean light yellow in color with a finger of fizzy white head (fizzy yellow beer? Lol). Smells of fresh hops, pine and grapefruit with a bready background. The flavor is pretty well balanced.. Lots of citrus and grapefruit and caramel breadyness. Light/medium body with medium to high carbonation. I drank way too much yesterday and I gotta say this is a great hair of the dog."
"O: Kudos to Stone for packing so much hop flavor into a beer (not that Stone's ever done something like that before, right?) but also keeping the abv so low. That being said, overall I feel like the malt is almost completely absent from this beer and that the liquid is just a hop flavor vehicle without contributing anything itself. Still quite tasty and I imagine I'll drink quite a bit of this"

"Overall: Really good SIPA; The hop-bursting is apparent in the aroma and flavour complexity"

"This is another solid offering by Stone! The beer carried fresh hop scent that leaned toward pine with a nice citrus backing. The taste was very well balanced. There was nice sweet malt to balance the hops and the pine and citrus was present. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is one heck of a sessionable IPA!"
"i am personally a fan of the session ipa style, since it is conducive to the starting early-going all night approach i favor when imbibing. that said, i find the Go To IPA a worthy addition to the category, and one that i hope will become as ubiquitous as their flagship india pale. color and appearance are more like the 'fizzy yellow' brews Stone rallies against. minimal lacing left on the sides of my pint, but i'm not drinking this through my eyes. aroma delivers a fragrant burst of ruby grapefruit, tangerine, and some herbal sage. while the mouthfeel is on the thin side (no surprises there), the bitterness makes up for that aspect, lingering on the sides and back of the tongue pleasantly. carbonation is medium, making for a most refreshing sessioner. i will add this one to my list of regular purchases."

"10/10, best session IPA out there. Bring it on Easy Jack."
"Worth a try."
""
"So what we have here is essentially a light lager beer base and floral/tropical hops. Tastes decent, drinkable but also completely unbalanced. Without the malt presence it seems Stone was unable to go to their typical hard hitting flavor and bittering hop varieties leaving this one feeling out of place in their extensive lineup. With the session IPA trend just building up I think there will be plenty of opportunities to not, go back to this beer in the future."

"Stone definitely succeeded in what they set out to do here: a low ABV yet west coast hop intensified beer. I love the idea of a session IPA, though it's hard to say if I love the finished product. It's very good, don't get me wrong, but just like some IPA's can get too strong on malt, this one borders on being too light. That being said, I am still going to drink more of this, and hopefully it grows on me more."

"12oz bottle that I got from a $9 sixer, bottle date indicates it might be three weeks old. bright yellow-orange color, good white head. Aroma is really nice tropical fruits, tons of hops here, very west coast. Flavor is the same, lots of tropical fruit hops, not much pine or dank, very hoppy ans also doesn't taste thin like a lot of low alcohol IPA's seem to. I was hoping this would be like the Kelsey McNair collaboration and while it is not as good it is quite a nice beer."

"A friend who works for Stone brought over a pre-release bottle for me. Labeled and to be marketed as a ""session"" IPA, it comes in at a manageable 4.5 ABV. A superb IPA. Utilizing Eldorado hops (so sayeth my friend, then again he works in IT), it is floral and hoppy in the extreme. Exceedingly piney in character, the flavor hangs on the palate. Refreshing and easily sessionable, definitely a go to once the weather turns warm again."
