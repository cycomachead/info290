"Pours a clear deep golden color with about a inch of foam. Foam dissipates to leave very nice lacing of the glass. Smell is faint, but very nice...featuring tropical fruits, grapefruit, and pine. Taste is of citrus and tropical fruits, leaving a very pleasant hoppy after taste. Mouth feel is lightly carbonated and extremely smooth. Overall an outstanding IPA."
""
""
""
""
"The smell is tropical and piney - it has a wonderful aroma, I just wish it was more pungent. It doesn't jump out of the glass like some other IPAs do. I actually think the taste was better than the smell. It has a very tropical fruity aftertaste, with some subtle grapefruit and pine. Not very bitter and I enjoy this beer more and more as it warms up. I will definitely buy it again, as a bomber was only $4.99 here."

"Keg of racer five drank."

"Just a really well-crafted brew. I highly reccomend this. It has so much flavor, yet is so well balanced and easy to drink. Any critique would be maybe a tad bit more carbonation, but this is me nitpicking (plus I like over-carbonated beers). Also it is just a tad bit thick, nothing crazy, again just nitpicking. I would pair this with a grilled chicken breast with a nice salad with a citrus vinaigrette. It gets a 94/100."
""
""
""
"Overall- Finally got a hold of this popular IPA. I get the hype it has now. Very smooth and quite flavorful. Lots of hop flavors and a nice malt blend. This seems more like a 2xipa to me than a regular one. Very good."
""
"Nice clean DIPA that behaves.  Highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is both caramel and juicy with a modest lingering hop finish.  Balanced."

"What a beautiful brew, thick and delicious with tasty residue visible in the glass. Malty and fruity in its own unique way. A real treat."

"Wonderfully flavorful and Bursting with that floral, citrusy, hoppy taste I crave.   Now among my top beer choices."

"Great West Coast IPA, should have the reputation of Sculpin."

"Outstanding Beer.  My buddy Ben turned me onto the Racer.  We found it at this little hole in the wall store in Maryland.  I don't think they even knew what they had because it was the only quality beer they had.  One of my best afternoons was spent drinking this beer with my boy Ben.  Heres to you big guy!"

"Just had one of these for the first time,I drank a stone enjoy by(2/14/15)just a little 2 hours before, and I gotta tell you its right up there pound for pound,really really tasty,not to bitter just perfect with a little bit of sweetness awesome fucken beer for $4.99..BTW the stone was $7.99..if I had to pick one I might just pick racer 5 just by a little cuz the price Lol.cheers everyone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To me there was a little bit of a funky after taste."
""
""
"O: I give it an A. It's a bright, easy-drinking, Ã¼ber sweet IPA. My only qualms are that the syrupy sweetness is a little too lingering, as I prefer a cleaner, dryer, style."
""
""
""
"Not sure why I hadn't picked up one of these before. Its like a party you go to and only know one person there. Then that one person leaves so you don't really know anyone but you're too drunk to leave yourself so you end up sitting in a corner just waiting to sober up. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"A fantastic IPA...and potent... Hoppier than most, but great taste profile reminiscent of Red Hook ESB I grew up with in the late 80's..."
""

"I liked it, but was disappointed for the price."

"Freaking massive!  After starting your pint wondering what you've gotten yourself into and you finish ordering another.  This beer is special.  This hits a limit for how bitter yet delicious a beer can be at this ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really hoppy with a slight alcoholic taste like an imperial ipa. Really hoppy but good"
""
"Nice big hoppy west coast thing.  Got some yeast to it...yum.  Along with some bigger bubbles that takes away from the potential creamy feel i love.  I'll be back."
""
"Delicious beer! Hope rumor is not true and I can still get this in Massachusetts"
"The IPA for non snobs.  Always reliable and smooth going down.  Easily accessible to those who don't normally drink IPA's, and is quite common.  You get way more than what you pay for."
""
""
"Pours a light golden with a white head. Smells of light flowery citrus. Grapefruit up front, grassy/earthy medium body with nice citrusy resinous aftertaste."

""

"My all time favorite. A treat to savour."
""
""
"Overall, this is a refreshing beer. Tastes, bright, crisp, and clean. If you like your IPA to be hop forward with minimal malt presence, you will love Racer 5."
""
"Solid IPA; definitly a go to IPA. I'm sad to see it leave my disto area here in MA."
""
""
"Great look and pour.  Great aroma and taste.  Would recommend and we'll have another, probably soon"
""
""
""
"""Go To"" beer.  Never leaves me wanting or desiring a different pour!"
""
"I feel like this almost sessionable until I realize it's 7.5%. Nice flavor and a pronounced bitterness that isn't out of control."

"I love this IPA.  Hoppy, tangy, light on the tongue."
"I don't like the Speed Racer label but looks are not important when drinking beer. Like other people I have gravitated to drinking this beer on regular basis. This is definitely one of top taste, ABV, price and always cold beers at the store where I am at in California.  Please don't change anything with this beer. Enough said. Enjoy. Update, still drinking it and other beers. Nothing has changed, still the best of the best based on taste, ABV and price."

"22oz bottle served in pint glass.  Beer pours orange amber in color, lightly hazed, with a large yellowish-white head.  Ample, piney C-hop aroma.  Flavor is aggressive and hop-forward, as promised, without being harsh or bitter.  Pretty well balanced, with a hint of sweetness in the finish.  Just a little bit to the left of fully and dangerously drinkable."

"This is an oustanding beer. It's everything I want in an IPA. It's hoppy with a malty back bone. There's a hint of citrus and pineapple. just love it. This has become my go to beer. I always keep some on hand. If there is ever anyone who says they've never had an IPA or they don't like IPA, this is the beer for them to try. A true classic that shows what a west coast IPA is all about."

"O: A very well done IPA. Smooth balanced bitterness and hop aroma. Surprisingly less bitterness in the finish for an IPA. Nice clean malt profile. A complex and highly drinkable beer. It's an IPA in the beginning but more like an APA in the finish. Love this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If I did a blind tasting of this, I would think itâs a solid IPA. That being said, I had heard some pretty high praise of this beer and I donât know that I completely vibe with that. Good drinkability, good full flavor, but I was looking for a juicier palate. Overall, I like this beer, and I like it better warmer."

"Mouthfeel is a bit flat. I see that the alcohol content is 7%, and after drinking half a bottle, I feel that, but it doesn't taste like it."
""
""
"12 oz. bottle coded 1/10/15 poured into a goblet. Deep orange-gold with slight haze from yeast in the bottle. Orange/citrus hop aroma with pine, somewhat subdued, with Chico yeast twang. Little malt character. More pine as it opens up. Tastes similar to its aroma, then almost pine-sol like hops burst through after initial balance. Aggressive bitterness, long hoppy finish. Medium-full mouthfeel. I would love a little more hop aroma and slightly less bitterness, and less of the yeast character."

"This is a consistent good beer. Had it on tap and bottle/Glass. Always nice color and lacing. The smelly is very fresh, citrus, grapefruit, some pine. Good medium taste with just the perfect easy bitter finish not overwhelming at all. I find it a bit similar to Firestone Union Jack IPA."

"A cloudy amber/orange pour with an attractive but quickly dissipating head. A fresh scent of tangerine and lemon. A light and drinkable beer with a nice combination of tangerine (following the nose) and grapefruit. An excellent IPA which I will seek out again and hope to try on tap someday. Thanks Monty in AZ for this one."

"If you're rating this IPA sub-4, your taste buds are garbage. Great f***ing IPA. This is a top ten IPA if you know or drink them regularly. This is an example of why American micro-brewmasters are mad scientists who challenge the industry at large with a Steve Jobs cockiness of giving you what they like knowing that you'll love it too."

"O: I could deal with this beer any day of the week, but with that said, there are other IPAs I enjoy more. I can see why this is considered by many to be a classic, for it's easy drinking and plenty tasty -- and the bitter bite here is not a crazy in-your-face deal that ruins your palate."
"well balanced bitey Ipa. had fresh, enjoy by 8/24. from tulip glass. orange color, white head, smell travels , piney, mango, citrus, resin, dankness. flavor has all the bitterness it needs, fruitry citrusy and fresh , clean. lovin this, wish I picked up a whole case"

"O: I like this brew alot. It's an easy drinker but still hoppy and bitter enough to make most hopheads happy. Racer 5 is one of those ipa's that got me over the ipa hump so to speak."

"O - A very, very solid IPA. This beer is very balanced with no one element overshadowing another. This brew is a regular of mine ... very enjoyable."
""
""
"Poured a cloudy orange-gold with a thin white head that left slight lacing. A good looking IPA. Scents of pine resin, cedar, slight citrus, tropical fruit and sweet malt, a bit of an onion-like off-aroma as well, possibly an old or otherwise improperly kept bottle. Otherwise not bad. Taste begins with grapefruit, orange and nectarine, along with citrus peel, moves into a bit of nice pine resin and finishe swith bitter pine resin and citrus peel. A nice malt sweetness, caramel mostly, is also present throughout. The aftertaste is bitter and slightly grainy, with hints of caramel. The flavor is quite nice, not the most hop forward, nor the most malt heavy IPA, but it strikes a good balance and has a nice flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation, an oily feel upfront and a sticky feel later. Quite good, very easy to drink and pleasant feeling. Overall this is an excellent IPA with a good flavor profile, mouthfeel and scent. I just wish the store had kept the bottle in a cooler so it didn't get that onion off-note in the aroma. Otherwise a solid IPA."

"This ale pours a orange straw color with a small white head and minimal lacing. The nose is a beautiful balance of malts and hops. The flavor is surprisingly deep and complex. Lots of hop bitterness up front but quickly followed by a rich malty sweetness. If this was the intention of the brewers than I say bravo. I think this beer may have sat on the shelf a little longer than normal but it seems to have turned it into an even better, more balanced ale than was originally intended. Its just unfortunate that Bear Republic has pulled out of Michigan. I'll miss this and Hop Head Rye."

"O - 4 - It's a great standard west coast IPA. However, if I was looking for something very special I probably wouldn't go with this one. It's more the equivalent of any given region's go to, every day IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"At least 1/4 inch on the ground. Typical, or perhaps archetypical, for an IPA: golden good. Bottle-conditioned and hazy as heck. Lovely foamy head. Nothing particularly smell-nice or taste-nice, just good ol' fashioned hop love. Bitter and balmy. Mouthfeel is especially nice: rich and inviting. Extra-sessionable for a bitter 7-percenter. Obtain multiple."

"Overall: Fantastic - thanks to Danial for sending this up and over!"

""
""
""
""
"Overall: Coming into this brew, it came highly recommended and I must say I am glad I chose this brew. Fills the palate with earth tone hops and an undertone of citrus flavors. Quite nice overall, really enjoyed this brew. I would totally try again and have already started recommended this brew to friends. Can't wait to try again. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O- this is a great, well-balanced full flavor IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad at all. Fairly cheap price and well worth it. Could use a little more complexity in the taste, but a worthy beer to try."
"The Racer 5 pours an amber-tan color, with a rich, caramel-orange-tinged hue. It has this wonderful candied-orange hop aroma to it, with an orange-heavy hop profile. Malty sweetness turns into a bitter piney finish. Dependable, reliable, and Iâm glad Iâm finally giving it its due."

"Overall: This is a very flavorful smooth IPA. Has a very good spicy banana flavor, with quite a hoppy finish. Bold, smooth, delish. You can't stop drinking them."

"One of the best I.P.A.s, and one of the best overall beers I have ever had! This one is as hopped up as Rob Ford at a crack house during one of his drunken stupors. Much like the Toronto Mayor, this one will knock you down if you are not careful! The look and the smell are just as intoxicating as the brew itself. I would like to proclaim that it possesses the perfect I.P.A. aroma! I love the racer theme bottle and pretty much everything about this beer...except for the price unfortunately. It is definitely worth ten dollars for a six pack, but just as much as steak dinner is worth the price, it is not practical to have all of time. This is worthy of being called the steak dinner of beers, and I would highly X 5 recommend it."

"O - I had a bomber of it years ago and never reviewed it. I just found it in a six pack and will be going back and picking up another."
""
""
"O- Very nice IPA. A great example of being hop forward, but having enough of a malt backbone to balance it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I remembered this being really hoppy but maybe my palate has adjusted since I had this 2 years ago. Nonetheless, I like the balance in this and would certainly have again. My tendencies now though lean towards something a bit hoppier."

"Mouthfeel has a sharp citrus start then mellows into herbal hops and mildly nutty malts, mod carbonation. Good all round session ipa, quite bitter but nice balance and really fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"From a bottle. Pours golden with a frothy head that dissipates to a one-inch rocky head. Good retention. Nice aromas of pine and citrus, but also biscuit, caramel and herbal tones. Upfront flavors of butterscotch, herbs, leather and grapefruit. Finishes with a hint dried apricot, citrus and some resiny notes that are less than pleasing. Noticeably higher alcohol content. There are some significant herbal flavors in this beer that don't seem to work too well. I was expecting a traditional IPA, but this is maltier and not as strongly hopped. Creamy mouthfeel that leaves a syrupy coating on the tongue. Not your typical IPA, and not the best IPA I've had. Not a bad beer, but it's almost as if this beer can't decide what it's supposed to be."

"I'll keep searching for the perfect IPA, but I will definitely be drinking Racer 5 again!"
"The Bear Republic Racer 5 was a flat out excellent IPA. It poured a great golden color with a nice white head and plenty of citrusy hops in the aroma. It was a perfectly balanced IPA with plenty of citrus hops and a slight hint of pine bitterness to keep it interesting. It has to be one of the top IPAs for me. There is not much else to say about the Racer 5 other than it is Fantastic."

"4.4/5.00"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a world class beer, it is absolutely the best beer ever brewed. It has the perfect balance of hops and bitterness. It is smooth and smells amazing. Color is an amber golden. Smell has definite hop presence and just a bit of citrus. Pour it a glass and let it breath for a few before tasting perfection."
""
""
"A - pours up medium gold, hazy in a tulip glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Racer 5 pours a clear golden color with a soapy head and good lacing. It initially smelled of grapefruit but as the beer warmed, it took on more of a pine smell. Pine is also the first thing I tasted followed by malty caramel. Then the bitterness took over. It totally dried out my mouth and tongue. A little too much for my liking. But overall this is a pretty solid IPA."

"Very good IPA. Nothing more nothing less. I'll always say yes to Racer 5"
""
"Poured a slightly hazy golden, copper color with a small white head. Very thin lacing. Unfiltered with quite a bit of sediment in the bottle. Hoppy aroma that tickles the nose and smells delicious. Citrusy, mostly grapefruit. A little resiny and has a slight malt sweetness to the smell as well. Smells nice, no doubt. On to taste, this is a real hop bomb IPA. A strong malt backbone fueling the 7% abv but the hops really dominate this brew. Bitter, but once the palate adjusts there is a bouquet of hoppy flavor packed into this beer. Fruity, grapefruity and some pine. A delicious IPA! but a definite hop head's brew. Light carbonation, bitter but very smooth, some resin in the aftertaste. Bottom line, I love this beer. As far as I'm concerned, It's a damn masterpiece!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Definitely a good beer, but I wonder if this one sat on the shelf too long and some of the hop aroma and taste has been lost based upon other reviews I've read about this beer. A solid AIPA, but not as flavorful as I thought it would be. Very balanced though, with distinct hop flavors. I found this beer to be more of a slow sipper rather than something very drinkable that I wanted to reach for another when I was done. One was enough, but glad I tried it."
""
""
"Overall, the musty smell threw me off, while the hops don't provide the complex flavor I came to love in such IPA's as Lagunitas or Alesmith."
""
""
""
"T/M: little bit of a few things with not too much of any: sweetness of honey, some papaya (maybe bubble gum), subdued lemon and grass ending bitterness, slightly dry ending."
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a plastic hotel water cup. Dark golden hue, quickly dissapating head that left lacing on the sides of the cup, with a medium mouthfeel and aggressive carbonation. Pine dominates the nose with some herbal cattiness noted. Taste is of pine and citrus, herbal pungency, caramel and toffee; beginning and ending with the pine, pine, piney goodness of chinook hops. I prefer a more citrusy hop profile but this is a different and welcome IPA that I'd like to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a Pilsner. It has 1/8"" head which quickly reduces to thin lacing. It has a cloudy golden color, perhaps unfiltered, which i don't mind. Aroma is rich hops and pine. Flavor is rich, complex, balanced. Mouthfeel is moderately thick and tingly--I like it. This is an outstanding IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very well crafted. A very pleasant and balanced IPA, relatively delicate and flavorful, but that knows how to bite. Godsâ juice."

"Just got this from my neighborhood growler shop. It goes down smooth and just hoppy like I enjoy. Used to drink Balantine Ale back in the day. Reminds me if this! Glad my carryout just tapped it finding out on facebook. Now to find some good and hot chicken wings to go with it."

"Read about R5 on a recent 'top xxx"" thread. Went to my local bottle shop today, not necessarily looking for it, but was thrilled to find it nonetheless! Now one of my top 5's. Actually reninded me a bit of ZD(easy, ZD heads). Going back today to grab a another 6 or two..."

"O - throughout this experience I was shocked at just how laid back and simple Bear Republic kept this though its so good I never became bored with its perfect balance and simple flavors. It has the hoppiness and bitterness to allow yourself to take in a real world class American ipa while letting you take big, flavorable drinks. I'd recommend this to anyone and this lets me automatically love Bear Republic. What a California gem this thing is. The highest of marks from me"

"So after having some amazing IPAs it's always tough to have a new one after Heady, Pliny and Ghandi. This is a respectable and really tasty beer. Drank it out of the bottle and would explain it as bitterness that hits on the front and back but not too intensely. Can definitely smell and taste some piny hops with less citrus than some other ipas. I viewed it as a good session IPA and would buy again"
""
""
"O: Outstanding beer. Purchased only one in a self chosen 6 pack. Will definitely purchase a six pack in the future."

"Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA is a fantastic ""gateway"" beer for those considering new styles of beers. If you are interested in trying craft style American brews, this one opens the doors to a new take on beers. The taste is mild hoppy, no bells and whistles, and is a solid IPA."
""
"overall - this is really a top notch IPA, I need to pick this up more often. I bought a bomber of this while I was on a ski trip in Cali to drink"
""

"Pours a hazy golden could with a 2 finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are moderate.  Grassy, citric aroma.  Resin.  Hoppy.  Great malty flavor that blends nicely with a grassy hoppy bitterness.  A slight grapefruit, citric taste at the end.  Great bitter aftertaste.  Slightly soapy.  This has been and still is one of my favorite beers and breweries overall."
""
""
""
"overall, like other bear republic beers I've had, this one is lacking on that big kick of flavor. its balanced but the flavors just aren't intense. this isn't a favorite of mine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into becker pint glass; slightly cloudy golden yellow with a medium-thin tight white head that leaves tons of lacing. Smell is resiny hops with floral/citrus notes in the background, and lots of malt as well. Taste is delicious; hops hit first with bitter and fruity flavors, then smooth creamy clean malts come in and smooth everything over leaving just a bitter aftertaste. The bottle-conditioning really smooths this one out, the 7% is well-hidden and this is delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light golden with a one-finger white head that quickly fades to a nice cap. Subtle citrus aroma. Grapefruit bitterness hits the tongue first. Pine and sweet malt follow. Nicely balanced. Finishes hoppy bitter but not over the top like other West Coast IPAs. Body on the light side with slight carbonation. An extremely well crafted IPA. Matter of fact, its my favorite West Coast IPA to date!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Very good. One of the smoothest, well balanced IPAs I've had. Definitely a West Coast style. Plenty of hops without being a hop bomb."
"Had hype behind the name. Got a bomber and was let down... Average IPA with a nice balance but if a beer is hyped and I get my hopes up and they are shattered by a par beer... I weap. It had some fruity notes to it with a balance of malt in there... Drank a Stone cail-belgi after and enjoyed that about 3 x more."
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with medium-low levels of carbonation, leading to a gently foamy, smooth mouthfeel. Closes dry, with little stickiness remaining on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- An excellent and unique IPA that I always love to drink. Has that west coast citrus bomb aspect to it but in a way that's still different and remarkable."

"O: A delicious representation of this style. Reminds me a lot of a double IPA, perhaps due to its weight in body and taste and alcohol, but its not quite there at a double. Would go well with spicy food, or enjoyed as I am on a hot day in Kunming China."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Dialed back in every respect from my experiences in IPAs, I think that is exactly against the grain of West Coast IPAs in general. Not a fan. Heres one for people who say ""I love IPAS, just dont like the hoppy tasting ones"". What?"
""
""
""
""

"Racer 5 must be consumed as fresh as possible. It's a classic dry-hopped California IPA with loads of citrus hop aroma. It has a strong bitterness, though it's well balanced with a pretty heavy malt. It's at hoppier end of IPAs, though it isn't going to blow your head off. A great regular drinker."
""
""
"Overall a great beer. I think I had my expectations a little too high considering the ratings it received on BA. However I'm glad to try this. Each IPA is often different in its own way, just like this one is different. This is worth trying BUT if it's not distributed to your state, there are plenty of other IPA's just as good if not better. If you do have one, pop open the bottle, relax, and enjoy!"
""
""
""

"I'm really happy with this. We don't get Bear Republic anywhere near home and this didn't disappoint my excitement. An easy drinker for the style, good taste and nice alcohol. A very solid American IPA."

"Wow, I can't believe this stuff went under my nose for such a long time, it really is a delicious IPA. Very good perception of extreme hoppiness while maintaining a great balance with the malt that keeps this beer drinkable as all hell. Goes down like a champ - and it helps that the 7% ABV goes primarily unnoticed. Delicious stuff, no joke."

"Great but not quite what I had imagined it to be but not one that disappointed anyway. Very easy to drink with lighter bitterness levels than anticipated but the taste was great and the 7% abv. didn't show at all. The aroma was a little weak but nothing that spoiled the beer."

"O-This brew hits the meh button for me. It wasn't unpleasant, but I expect an IPA with 7% ABV to provide a little more flavor firepower than this. Perhaps my bottle was old, but I felt like the hops had faded, almost into oblivion, and the result was a so-so brew that did not measure up to other examples of the style."

"O - good IPA. The grapefruit profile is not quite my thing, almost too mild of a profile for the overriding bitterness if the grapefruit. I would definitely order this again though."
"A popular but in my mind mediocre West Coast IPA. In some cases, like with BR's Hop Rod Rye, balanced is good in that the ingredients all contribute to a nice, complex brew. In Racer 5's case, it has been balanced into insipidness. Not nearly enough hop complexity for hop-heads, and there is an odd brackish taste at the front end of the palate as well. Very disappointing."

"O: Needless to say, this is one of my favorite, go-to beers and has been since my first bottle. A solid hop punch, but balanced enough not to kill the palate. I can't say there aren't better IPAs out there, because I haven't had the pleasure of trying them all. But given the relatively modest price and widespread availability, this is a beer that will always be represented in my fridge."
"Real nice IPA. Not the hoppiest, but it has some zip. Nice sweet malt in the background but really smooth for the 7% ABV. Initial aroma is pine forest. Orange amber color with a moderate off white head. Flavor starts fruity (apricot, orange) turning light grapefruit bitter and finishing kinda dry and orange rind bitter. Medium body, smooth with moderate carbonation."

"Overall: A nice IPA, skewed by living on the west coast. This is a nice, more balance IPA that probably appeals to a larger audience (though I admit the hops in any IPA are going to turn some people off.) That said, those of us on the west coast like to turn the hops up to 11, and in that regard this beer may seem as lacking. I'm sure it's a matter of preference, but I think I may have developed a Pavlovian response to my hops."

"Pours a firey orange golden with prickly white head and some lacing. Aroma is solid and enjoyable but not great and can get lost in the forest of great aromatic IPA aromas; juicy orange, its rind, doughy bread, and some grass. Flavor offers some nice sweet and juicy orange and its rind, some doughy bread, and a touch of some florals....so similar to aroma but a bit more filled out. A medium bodied, somewhat creamy, active mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice IPA. I dig it."

"I guess I love the west coast IPA's where there is a blast of citrus and piney tones. The big bubble head was one to two finger depending on the pour. The lacing was like a steam of clinger-ons without rings. But whoa, the fragrance is my kind of IPA whereas the blast is complex and delightful grapefruit and piney resins. The taste is equally good. I love this beer. The price is right and the lack of alcohol presence is just mt style. Try this one soon."

"This was one of my first favorite IPAs and a major gateway beer as I started diving into the craft scene. I could literally smell the hops radiating out of the bottle before I even popped the cap. Poured a nice goldenrod, somewhat cloudy, with a very small white head. Citrus, floral, and piney aromas really come through the nose, and are reflected in the taste, along with some subtle lemon and passionfruit. A nice west-coast style IPA that delivers complex bitterness, but is also nicely balanced by a nutty malt character that lends a fairly sweet caramel finish."

"Pours a nice hazy shade of gold, very good color. One finger of foam with acceptable retention and good lacing. Smells of a nice mesh of hop and bready malt. Some floral tones come through, as well as some pine and grapefruit. Taste follows the nose well. Hoppy malt come through strongest with some pine resin, not much citrus going on here. Feel is pretty good, nice crisp and dry finish, and a good amount of bitterness. Over all I was expecting more from this beer, but it's still pretty good. If it was available in my area I'd pick some up every now and again"

"I am stunned that this is not a top ten AIPA. Gorgeous in the glass. Two finger head that stays for what seems like a forever. Lots of lace. Beer stays covered all the way down. Fluid is a hazy stained oak color. Microfine carbonation continuously streaming up give a portent of the lovely feel. Smell is lightly bready with a mild caramel sweetness. Firm yeasty component is blanketed in hops. A citrus tinged light tropical fruit aroma as well. A dry graininess with a touch of sourness. Taste follows the nose. Light pale ale flavors are wrapped in a dry hoppiness. Pale malt and yeasty light bread. Dry grains and a faint orange flavor. Bit of biscuit. Dry hoppiness is tinged with both earth and citrus. Lovely dry finish leaves a trace of hop oil. Feel is crisp and light while not actually being a light beer. Dry and quenching with a perfect carbonation that lens itself to sessioning and refreshment. Wonderful drinkability that has you gulping the deliciousness. A superior American IPA. It just is and that's the way this beer hits me."

"O - This beer gets a very high rating, but taste is what matters most, and I just dont get that nice citrus flavor I have come to enjoy from the west coast IPA's. Certainly has a lot of hop character, good bitterness, but without the citrus and malt, there is not much in the way of balance. Very drinkable for the 7% ABV, I dont usually go much beyond 7%, as I dont care for the alcohol to take over, I like it hidden in the beer."
""
""
"Pours a clear pale gold color similar to adjucnt lagers. Nice fluffy pure white head. Aromatics are citrusy, orange, cedar and grass. Taste has excellent balance between sweet and bitter. It is dry and finishes with some nice spice notes, black peppery. Aftertaste is bitter and lingers a bit. Very good IPA. I have yet to have anything disapointing from this brewery."

"one of those ipas that you just keep on buying, this has everything. it pours mostly clear honey colored with a long lasting thick white head. like marshmallow fluff. it smells like resinous piney hops, bitter, with lighter english malt only in supporting position. full bodied bitter flavor with plenty of forest hops. not citrus or floral at all, just stright hop oil in bitter form. still theres some sweeter element in the finish, the mouthfeel is velvet, and the alcohol is strong enough to buzz you out without too much potency to lay you out for the evening. great carbonation and just an all around aggressive hoppy happy delight. again and again for me"

"Pleasantly surprised to see this one, unannounced, on the shelves here. Can't read the jibberish bottling code, but assuming it's not too old, given that it's new to the area. Pours a golden color with fine sediment in suspension, two finger thick white head which settles to a quarter inch, leaving a few blobs of lace down the glass. Smell: biscuit, grapefruit, honey-ish + white grape sweetness, alcohol and dried tropical fruit notes. It's nice, but it's not Big. Taste: grapefruit with some herbal and vinous stuff going on, backed by pale malt sweetness. Lingering citrus peel oiliness, as well as a splash of booze. The feel is almost-creamy cut by booze, which is odd for only 7%. Drying finish. This is good, but it's a bit rough around the edges, which is, less pleasantly, surprising given its rating around these parts."

"Taste is all hops, with a finish of alcohol. The hops aren't bad. Just simple. Like a canvas painted a single bright color. Not ugly, just doesn't hold your attention that long. There is a grapefruit rind taste that lingers on the back and sides of the tongue...because it's an IPA. There is a very slight alcoholic zing with every third sip or so. Mouthfeel is meh. That bitterness lingers a bit too long. Overall - good for a 6-pack. Well brewed, but not my favorite."
""
""
"Racer 5 pours a crystal-clear golden color with a light head that retains well. The aroma is a citrus bomb, this beer's got a heavy citrus nose, primarily grapefruit and tropical fruits. The taste is yet another burst of hop flavor, it's got the strong citrus from the nose hitting first along with a massive bitter presence that strikes after a few seconds. The malt hangs to the back, anchoring everything well while letting the hops shine. The aftertaste is a great, lingering bitter resinous hop. The mouthfeel is lighter and well-carbonated, it drinks like an APA. The drinkability is amazing. Overall, Racer 5 is a top-tier IPA. It's just very satisfying and has a unique flavor profile that stands out from the pack."
""
""
""
"O: An excellent, excellent west-coast style IPA. Hop flavor and aroma is strong and delicious. Not overly so, having said that, it still retains excellent drinkability without being a ridiculous hop bomb. I enjoyed this one a lot. Great balance between a super hoppy beer and a blander but drinkable pale ale."

"This time I'm finally getting it on tap. Kind of a dirty straw/honey golden color. More clarity out of the tap than out of the bottle. Creamy just off-white head. More of a floral hops for me. This time the citrus and pineapple reveal themselves. I didn't notice this with bottles, but this keg was freshly tapped and obviously had never seen sunlight. Hops are also more prevalent. Malts seemed to ride in the backseat where they belong. I get some grapefruit on the back end along with an odd hint of vanilla. Felt nice in the mouth. Although this has let me down out of the bottle, the fresh draft was very good. I'd have to give this a Rachel Ray Yum-O."

"All I have to say is that it looks tantalizing and retains an amazing, creamy head to the end. Nice medium carbonation can be seen through the clear amber. The smell is sweet with strong tropical fruit hop smell. The taste is a spot-on balance of sweet maltiness and piney/tropical hop bitterness that sits just right, not too bitter and minimal bitter finish. It feels thick and chewy but not overbearing. It is truly an easy, smooth drinker with a slight resinous and oily feel to chew on. I gotta say I really like this one and will be the only IPA other than Pliny that I would actually purchase."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Sometimes these are just too easy to drink...at 7% that can be dangerous, but it is tasty. This is a perfect summer time IPA. Light in body yet tasty, closer to an american pale ale i think. Differing from someone like sierra pale in a good way with more citrusy/floral hops."

"Finally got a pint of this. Pours a brilliant golden orange with sticky head. Hops abound in typical IPA fashion. Nicely balanced too. It's an IPA at its most basic, but it's done to near-perfection. Hoppy, but balanced. Strong, but not too strong. Can't complain! It's a really solid IPA that makes for a great go-to beer at the bar or with dinner."

"O: Very easy to drink and easy to reach for a 2nd or 3rd, but the alcohol level would make that a little dangerous. I suspect that if I drank 3 of these, then finishing the six pack would not be a problem (until morning). I suspect that this was a ""better"" beer a couple of months ago, but it is still excellent, very nice. Worth seeking out for any American IPA fans, I would purchase again."

"It doesn't offer the smooth, refined piney goodness of certain competitor brews, but it's certainly very drinkable and refreshing. What it lacks in piney goodness it makes up for in easy availability."

"This is simply the most solid American IPA I've found this side of the Russian River. Buy it, drink it, be it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: one of the best American IPAs I have had, by a fair old margin. It is heavily hopped per the style, but it doesn't make the usual mistakes of over-carbonation and no malt to back up. Really, a lovely brew."
""
""
"This is one of my favorite IPAs. I never turn down a chance to drink it. Itâs delicious, hoppy, bitter, fruity, floral, and is always a great way to spend a few minutes, a couple of dollars, and the end of a day."
"This is definitely an underrated beer! I rarely give all 5's but this deserves it! It is a very well balanced IPA that has a good malt backbone to back it up. It does have a big hop forward taste that lingers a few minutes after the gulps. Best part is when I'm done I can still taste this beast in my burps :) OUTSTANDING BREW!"

"This beer is the second IPA that I absolutely love from Bear Republic. Definitely a solid 4.5. Don't like it as much as their Hop Rod. But definitely well balanced...A newcomer to IPA would know that this is definitely a good IPA. Hoppiness isn't too strong nor weak. Its fruity accents make it seem like a ""dessert beer."" Fruity guy to freshen your breath? No, Racer 5."

"A very fine, even head about the width of a fingernail. Lasts for the entire drink. Fine fizzy champagne bubbles throughout as well. Not an awfully strong nose, but this may be because I'm drinking it from a wine glass--I smell pale green tea, maybe a citrus note or two. Thank god we do not have an overblown hop-hammer here: this is an expert, discreet tasting, though full-bodied and strong, IPA, with citrus, pine (and not pine resin, which is what the ostentatious, begging to be Bad Ass think passes for IPA) vegetal flavors. A long semi-dry finish -- no, actually smoother at start and then fairly dry from mid to finish. No lingering estery chemically taste at all. Tastes like a totally natural beverage, not overhopped like some of its chemical panel kin. I'm a fan after just one. Thanks to the BevMo dude that recommended this as I was on my way to a sixer of Deschutes Inversion (another great IPA)."
""
"Overall: The first time I had this beer it blew me away. I still love this beer. It's not quite the earth-shattering beer I remember, but it's damn tasty. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that it's next to impossible to get super-fresh in MA. Oh well, I'll keep it."

"Overall, an excellent, complex ipa. It really hits on all the right hop notes. Definitely not for the faint of hop!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, yellow copper, almost honey looking drink, with a low head, with little lacing. Smells malty sweet over bitter notes, but not getting prominent Cascade hops as advertised, or any of the other mentioned, but probably wouldn't know it. Bitterness does not sustain long but is there, somewhat muted, and appears modulated by the grain bill a bit. Not a 'nose forward' IPA. Oh, and mouth-feel is fine, with discreet carbonation, but not at all scrubbing. I've since had this fresher, and rated it higher on second try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The bottle conditioning adds a nice extra element to the hops, not so much the malt, some decent layers of depth to the hops here. A tasty American IPA that is worth seeking out, but boo on Bear Republic for their legal action against Central City, their Red Racer IPA still does laps around Racer 5."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A bit much for me. I wouldn't call it balanced. This ale is so crisp it reminded me of Listerine."
"An average IPA I won't buy again. There are far too many IPAs out there that are worlds beyond this one. This was my first beer from this respected brewer, but this won't stop me from trying a few others."

""
"recommended."
""
"Overall this was a wonderful IPA. I normally shy away from IPA's because they can be almost too intense with the hop bitterness, but this beer got out of the way quick enough for the bitterness to be pleasant. I would drink this IPA anytime I'm in the mood for a hoppy beer."

"One of my favorites, Racer 5 is a solid, go-to IPA like Two-Hearted, 60 Minute, White Rajah, or Commodore Perry. If you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out on a classic."

"O - Bear Republic's Racer 5 IPA is a great American IPA. If you want a great example of the seemingly ubiquitous style, this is it."
"It was a very enjoyable beer that was easy to drink and did not come on too strong with the hops. Had a hop kick in the end but was not overpowering. Not bitter at all and, while it may not be overly important, had a very cool label and was eye catching. With that said, good beer, not my favorite IPA but its near the top"
"0: Outstanding overall. A very pleasant hops forward taste, but doesn't need to hit you over the head with it. The begining blend of sweet malt and pine and resin is a great start for the transition to the slight orange. The heavy body really works well here, too."
""
"O: An excellent & drinkable beer. On par with CCB Jai Alai for a truly excellent IPA that you can grab in a six-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall I would say this is a winner and the high ranking on beeradvocate is well deserved. It could have been one of my all time favorites for an IPA if it had more aroma. I never did get over the lack of scent. Would purchase again to share with friends."

"I've heard great things about this beer and it did not disappoint. However, I rank it behind Stone and Loose Cannon but not by much."

""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty IPA, with a great nose. I'll be buying this again."
""
""
"this is really an excellent ipa. wish i'd bought more."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a small cap. Nice tight rings of lace line the glass on the entire drink down. Smell is all about the hops: grassy, herbal, earthy, and some slight citrus zest. Taste is mainly of grassy and herbal hops with a malt backbone to support everything. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a medium bodied mouthfeel with a lower level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good IPA but it features a hop profile that I am not all that crazy about."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very approachable and easily enjoyed beer - for fans of IPAs or people just getting started with the style. The beer has a really nice smell and taste, while hoppy is not overly aggressive in the bitterness. I could definitely have more than one of these at a sitting and will likely do so. This beer is easy to drink."
"Certainly one of the better choices in the world of ipas. Can't go wrong with this one...."
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy white head that lingers around for a while before forming a nice ring. Nice lacing on the glass as well. Nose is pine, grapefruit and citrus. Taste is all about hops with a pine taste, and nice balancing sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium, and drinkability is high."

"22Oz Poured into pint glass. hazy pale yellow orange with almost no head and no bubbles. smells flowery, citrusy, and hoppy. Yummmm. Tastes is very good, citrus and floral hops, alcohol, hop bitterness stays on the tongue long after swallowing. the mouthfeel is light. carbonation is too low for me, thats the only complaint i have about this one but it is still very drinkable. Overall a very tastey beer"
"O: A nice and smooth ipa, not incredibly flavorful and fragrant however, but refreshing all the same"
""
"Overall: Definitely a top IPA. Great beer that is absolutely worth buying again."

""
"Overall - An exquisite IPA and quite possibly the best i've had... My first Bear Republic brew and it lives up to the hype... highly recommended..."

"O: Average IPA. In comparison, Yards IPA has the same abv, but with a better flavor with a better management of alcohol. I might try this another time just to see if I got an old batch."
""
""
""
"Review from 6/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium orange amber, light head and minimal lacing. Nice fresh sweet herbal hop and malt aroma. Citrus, hops, light malt. Grapefruit and light pine. Hop and citrus aftertaste. Moderate body. A pleasant, moderately intense IPA."
""
""
""
"Overall - good beer - a style I find somewhat 'meh' delivers a more subtle example."
""
""
""
""
"Hazy gold, with a tint of red, and a medium sized white foamy head. Excellent lacing. Strong floral and citrus hop aroma, well-balanced w/ a smooth malt finish and a bitter aftertaste that goes down smoothly. Medium mouthfeel. Refreshing and very drinkable IPA."

"o- solid ipa. glad i got a chance to try it (i don't think bear republic distributes to georgia). i expected something much more like port's mongo, though."
""

"Overall: A unique interpretation; but a beautiful one at that."
"Also I did not buy this beer a friend gave it to me. I will never buy anything from Bear Republic after they sued my local brewery for copywrite infringement. http://www.redracerbeer.com/ Get over yourself Bear Republic!"

"O - Better overall than the sum of its parts, just a very solid beer, happy to have this in regular rotation."
""
""
"O â I am growing fonder of IPAâs everyday and this one really has great tastes. It ranks high on my list with a nice balance of light sweet and hop punch. Winner from Bear, wish they sent these east."
""
""
"Amber color,Medium sized off white head that lasted for a decent amount of time before fading to a nice lace.The aroma was malty and sort of sweet with a nice citrusy side and piney tones to it.The flavor was much the same malty and very hoppy with a nice fruit side to it,slightly heavy feel in the mouth."
""
"12 oz bottle poured into a duvel tulip. Nice yellow orange with a 1/2 inch off white head. Aroma is piney but nothing special. Flavor has a nice caramel and malt back with a strong hop hit. Bitter citrus fruits are apparent with more of that pine coming through. Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky. Overall a good ipa, just not amazing."

"O- I really like this beer and it's not to expensive. I live in Sonoma CA and I have a wide variety of local IPA's to choose from. My go to IPA's are RR's but I got to Racer 5 when I want more bang for my buck. This is a solid IPA and although it's not the best IPA there will always be a spot in my fridge for it."
""
"Easy going. Medium bodied. Very dry on the end. Good."
""
""
""
""
"Not quite as all-out as WCIPA but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Finishes with a floral bouquet of hops that snap any residual sweetness in half leaving you with a crisp dry finish. Super complex and layered beer with a mildly tannic aftertaste. The huge body thins out slowly as it travels along the tongue into a pop of satisfaction in the back of the month (thats what she said?) Not your everyday IPA but definitely delicious. Something I'd go for in the bomber rather than the 6. Slaps the taste buds around."
"O: This is what you want when you buy an IPA. Awesome hop extraction, well rounded bouquet of flavors. West coast classic. A tad over hyped IMO but certainly a heavy hitter in the category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy amber-orange with a tight, thick off-white head. The Columbus aromatic hops come through nicely, but a bit restrained, resulting in a fragrant pine needle and spice nose with just a touch of citrus. Mouthfeel was creamy and full with a subdued carbonation level. Initial flavor was a well balanced presentation of orange, grapefruit, sweet caramel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great IPA here- strong and assertive. Would love to try this on tap."
""
""
"O - I feel like this is a standard west coast IPA. Nothing memorable about the flavors, but they are well done. It's an above average brew, but it does nothing for me to seek it out again and again over some of the more memorable IPAs I've had. Definitely give it a try, you may think differently. There certainly is nothing wrong with this beer, and if you enjoy west coast IPAs, you'll most likely enjoy this too."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is a smooth sipper. The body is full and robust (for the style), which let's it coat your mouth and is only slightly sticky. The carbonation isn't overly noticeable but is definitely noticeable in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"No photo finish here. This one leads the pack."
""
"This is a superb balanced AIPA. Tons of C-hop deliciousness without being overly bitter or unbalanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle pours a medium clear amber with good head and lacing. Aroma of spicy citrusy hops and sweet candy malt. Hop profile is in your face and subtle at the same time with mango, grapefruit, and lemon flavors. Good chewy mouthfeel starts wet and finishes very dry. This one is an old favorite of mine."
""
"Overall i was expecting a bit more flavour but it was an okay IPA. I will let it warm up a bit and then maybe i'll get a bit more out of this."
""
"well balanced and drinkable IPA. Bittering and aroma hops are well balanced, pine and floral nose dominate with malt being overpowered by alcohol and dry hop character. Served from bottle and cold. Drinkable but quite heavy in body. Carbonation lighten the beer overall. Dry but not lasting bitter finish."
""
"Mouthfeel is nice- not too carbonated but good enough with a light body. Very drinkable ipa- one of the better ones."
""
""
"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled recently as my local store got a fresh case a couple weeks ago. Pours slightly hazy and cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent lacing on the glass. Aromas of big pine, grapefruit, herbal, lemon, caramel, and toasted bread. Very nice and well balanced aromas. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, herbal, pine, light caramel, honey, spiciness, and toasted biscuit. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pine, herbal, citrus, and honey on the finish for a bit. Great balance of sweetness and bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink at 7%, with only a slight alcohol warming after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent IPA offering. Great balance, hop flavor, and smooth drinking. At 6 bucks a bomber I really have no complaints."
""
""
""
"Overall: B"

""

"O: Very enjoyable Pale Ale - has a ton of drinkability and very affordable. This is my first beer from Bear Republic, so the bar is now set high. I'll certainly be picking up more of these for casual drinking."
""
""
"Bomber from the shop. Pours a clear golden color with white fluffy head and lots of bubbles. Aroma is a nice mix of big big pine notes with sweet citrus and bready malts to back. Flavor follows with a good bit of light citrus on top of pine bitter. Strong malt backing, but manages to highlight the beautiful west coast hops. This is extremely drinkable, with medium high carbonation. Awesome brew, and a top level single IPA."
""
""
"The aroma is very hop forward and compliments the taste very well. A very enjoyable drink."
"Orangey-amber colour, 1.5 fingers of white head, dense and lots of lace. Smell is loaded with hops, grapefruit, mange, tangerine, lots of citrus, some malt backbone, subtle notes of pine as well here. Taste is all citrus and fruit, grapefruit, tangerine, mango, tons of bitter hop, light sweet malts keep this from crossing the line of being over the top hoppy, light pine in the finish but gets overtaken by clean smooth citrus. Light-med carbonation, incredibly oily, medium body, slick all over the palate. This might be the best IPA I have ever had, if its not the best it has to be like top 2 anyway, no doubt about it I will drink this again and frequently."

"O- I really appreciate how readily available this beer is, and how little it costs for the quality. The only thing that I would change is that I would have it have a bit more body, and be a bit chewyier, but overall, and excellent beer."

"Appearance is a crystal-clear amber topped by a full billowy head. Lots of lacing left behind too - a gorgeous beer. Citrus scents of mango and maybe some orange are very pleasing to the nose. Taste is all hops - juicy and bitter. Mostly citrus flavor, although pine and floral tastes are noticeable. Mouthfeel is the one weak area of this beer - it's a bit thin. A solidly good and enjoyable IPA."
"O- Wonderful straightforward non-extreme IPA. Good for someone who loves hops but not sweetness. 7% ABV; just barely sessionable. It's the third BR beer i've tried after Hop Rod Rye and Red Rocket. All three were awesome and I will certainly be on the lookout for any new BR in Michigan."

"Overall: A well balanced brew. Unfortunately, the smell is more complex than the taste. This beer is perfect if you want an IPA but not an all out hop bomb. Normally, an American style IPA should have a stronger hop bite. Otherwise, there are no complaints."

"Overall-I find myself gravitating back to this IPA whenever I see it. This is a great IPA and one that you could drnk a few of. It is well balanced between the malts and the hops but also has a unique taste."
"Overall, pretty solid ipa. Would I recommend? Yessir you're god damn right I would."

"Ghostly haze to a light orange color. White thin head. Not much for head retention, although it could be the glass. This beer smells great. Piney hop resin upfront. Some sweet malt. Hops are piny and almost pineapple in flavor. Aftertaste is citrus hops and malt. Really soft and clean. Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth. Soft bitterness that doesn't linger, and considering the ABV very smooth beer. Thickness is suiting. Highly flavorful and surprisingly drinkable."
"Like It? Very Much So"

"Had this on tap served at right temperature. Clear crisp color with hopping nose. The hop flavor was very up front but died quickly on the tongue. Very refreshing IPA enjoyed looking over the Sonoma coast on a surprisingly clear January day undoubtedly enhanced the drinking experience!"
""
"O- pretty good but there are plenty other widely availabe IPAs that will keep me from seeking this out. I'm glad to try it (& will again, most likely) but I fear my review may have suffered from drinking an older bottle. I'd like to try some fresh sete if I ever male that beer trek out west... Â "

"Finally, hops. Nowhere near what I want. Hop oils are dominant, with a very slick soapy feeling taking over. It's like a jumbled mess of an IPA. I finally get why twaddlac hated this thing. The aroma hops are AWOL. Light body."
""

"O: An excellent example of the west coast IPA...definite up front hops with a light malty, sweet background...very easy to down a few and definitely a go-to IPA that is not overly difficult to find"

"Served with at a good temperature with a nice off white head. Color is a clear honey amber. Aroma is hop, malt, cookie dough. Flavor is similar to nose; hop on top, a little caramel below. Finish is perfect for style. Finish is like flavor.there are huge optons here"
""
"Cost: $4.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle, or $9.99 for a six pack."

"Golden yellow in color - respectable head with good lacing and hops suspended throughout the beer ... guess the crud on the bottom of the bottle got in there ... oh well. Decent hop aromas, but nothing overwhelming. Hops certainly come out in the taste - somewhat floral ... a little grapefruit as well. Medium in body with a creamy texture and a lingering hop finish. Very nice. This ranks right up there with some of the more costly IPAs I've had."

"Great beer, very soft and easy to drink, elegant like and less pungent. I really enjoyed it but I am more taken by the Michigan and 3 Floyds style that hits harder with aroma and hops taste. I think the bottle conditioning mellowed and subtle the edges on this beer and it works. I reccommend trying it."

"This beer has been tempting me in my fridge ever since I picked it up a couple months ago in Phoenix with my wife on our anniversary. Faced with literally hundreds of beers I hadn't sampled before, I was forced to only bring 12 home with me. Glad I chose Racer 5. Hands down this is the best IPA I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Though not a hop-heads delight, this beer is incredibly smooth and balanced despite being very complex and having a rather high ABV of 7%. Hopefully I can find this beer in New Mexico as I would love to make it a staple in my fridge. It is beers like this that make obtaining, tasting and reviewing beers from around the world such an exciting and rewarding hobby."

"O: This is not a balanced beer. That being said I love hop forward IPAs. The prickly carbonation really keeps the bitterness from being too strong. Extremely refreshing. I could have this beer any time of any day. Love it!"
"overall I WANT MORE (sums it up)"
"I would prefer more of a balance in the flavor profile. The pine and grass are much more dominant over the citrus and tropical fruits. This beer is still very good and better than most IPAs I have had."
"Bomber w/ my roommate. Pours an incredible clear light copper color with a nice off white head. Smells of mixed tropical fruit, sweet pale malts, and a pungent bittering hop aroma. Taste follows the nose but definitely not as heavy on the palate as on the nose. Lighter body makes this brew seem quite sessionable, but I would recheck the abv on the bottle before doing so. Could use a bit thicker body but overall pretty solid IPA, but nothing to trade for imo - unlike some other Cali (D)IPAs."
"O: Different in that it is simple, and has good qualities, but it's not one I would jump for."
"This is an experience worth documenting. I have tried this before in a bottle, but see the true spirit of this ale straight from the regulated beer tap. Happily surprised that it was at my local five napkin burger, I am ready to enjoy it with some tasty wings. The color is an opulent brass and although the head was thin(mainly from how the uneducated bartender poured it) it looks highly drinkable. There are still bubbles rising 5 minutes into the drinking of this crisp, light, piny-dry mouthventure. Can't wait until the wings arrive."
"This is an excellent beer. I recommend picking up a fresh bottle at a store near you."
"Overall - I love this beer. It's everything great about a westcoast IPA. Strong on the hops aroma and bitterness, yet subtly followed by a mellow sweetness."
"O: Second time having Racer 5, both were enjoyable."
"O- ok first.. wow. this beer is really nice. i always passed by it when choosing at the store. i think the reason i didnt pay attention to it was the packaging, heh. i heard it mentioned by another BA in a thread and thought i might try it. This is definately one to atleast try. its not complex but not in a bad way, just really good Hops."
"The taste is not as robust as the insanely hoppy IPAs that you find now on the West Coast, but still a true IPA with all the flavor profiles that you will want to find in a higher end IPA."
"good beer."
"O: solid beer, not all that complex for an IPA. Maybe it's old and the hops have gone with the age. $5 Bomber at Charleston Beer Exchange was a decent deal."
"My normal rating process is to rate the beer then look at how other people (most the top raters) rated the beer, and I was shocked to see how many people really, really liked this beer. Maybe I got a âless goodâ batch or maybe itâs a bit old, I donât know but, I didnât see what others saw in this beer."
"O:Good IPA I would say this beer would go really well with food that has a little kick too. Not as drinkable as some, I'm pretty sure after my second I wouldn't want any more."
"O - I Love this ""aggressive"" style American IPA. Hop hop hop hop!"
"Drinkability: Hands down one of the most drinkable IPA's in existence. No wonder this one flys off the shelves with such regularity. A solid hopped up IPA that even a timid beer drinker could appreciate."
"Overall: I liked it! It was definitely out-of-style for an old school CA brewery (especially with the hop bomb that is Hop Rod Rye), but it is a first cousin of beers like Two Hearted. Solid IPA."
"O: Impressed with this one, just tasted unique in this very competitive beer style."
"O- Great- kind of like a mix between an IPA and something more citrusy and floral. Definitely enjoy it."
"Overall this is one of the best IPA's around, and worth drinking any chance you get. Does not get old."
"After a disappointing start, this beer really improved for me as soon as I tasted it. Donât hesitate to give it a chance."
"O: Overall, this is a good IPA but nothing special. A nice appearance and aroma arenât really backed up in the taste which to me comes off as generic and middle of the road. I will say though that you canât beat the price (around $5 for a bomber) and I do plan on trying the Hop Rod Rye which most seem to agree is the best Bear Republic offering."
"I have had many bottles of this; I nearly burned out on its magic after splitting a case a few years ago. Fortunately, after taking a break, it still holds up. In a way, it's a hop bomb, but it also respects the notion of balance with its interesting malt profile. This is a classic, in my book."
"Overall: Way above average for an American IPA, and definitely true blue to the west coast IPA style. Its a prime west coast IPA flavor. A palate destroyer. Will drink more before I decide if I will seek this out again. Its a total ""go to"" beer. I don't like it more than Two-Hearted, but its a close second as far as ""go to"" IPAs go."
"Overall: a good everyday IPA. I would like to keep a case of 12oz bottles if it wasn't so hard to get by me. the bombers are abundant, but I like the single servings."
"Overall I've had this a few times and I really like it along with every other Bear Republic beer I've had. This one didn't seem quite as fresh as others I've had in the past but still a very nice beer."
"Overall this is a solid brew from a brewery I am finding to be just as solid. I think it could have been more aggressive, as it lacks a certain complexity and depth for me to rate it any higher (recommend their Hop Rod Rye). I look forward to trying more from Bear Republic. Cheers!"
"one of my favs, thanks for the bomber honey. pours golden hue, good foamy head ok retention. nose and mouth are caramel overbalanced by citrus. Yum! mouth is slightly sticky but a very drinkable 7%. always get me in trouble when more that 36 oz is down the hatch."
"Overall - I really enjoyed this beer. Nice balance, really nice flavors, and just enough sweetness. Highly recommend, would defintitely purchase again."
"Bottle in my mix 6 at Nikki's in RI, $2.29 before discount."
"O: A drinkable and refreshing IPA that might not be bitter enough for some pine loving hop heads, but hits the spot for me."
"This is a hop forward, west coast style IPA that many use as a benchmark for west coast IPAs. Excellent!"
"O/D: Very enjoyable, finally glad I got to have it on tap, worth seeking out."
"This is a nice citrus, light fruit, peachy beer that has a big, but not too big, hop kick in the end. It goes down smooth and is pleasing."
"O- This is one of my new favorite beers. I love this but have only seen this at White Horse in Boston. This needs to expand on the east coast."
"Nothing real flashy but a solid IPA with a good citrus hop forward presentation. It is quite easy to drink, part of which I attribute to the solid but not overwhelming components."
"O- This is one of my favorite IPAs so far. Very drinkable and one of the most balanced in my opinion."
"Overall, this is a great beer. Besides Harpoon (for the price) this is probably my favorite IPA to have around and drink a few of at a time. Great beer."
"You really can't detect the alcohol in this one and it's very drinkable. Bear Republic makes great beer, just wish they sold it in Indiana!"
"O - Sweet style west coaster."
"O: For those interested in a complex, chalk-dry and bitter IPA, this is it. It's tasty, but oddly disjointed and disharmonious. I'd rarely pass one up, but there are more superior IPAs out there. I wish it tasted more like it smelled."
"No doubt a well made beer that perhaps did not show its best to this drinker. Just not enough complexity to excite."
"O - Id heard fantastic reports of this so was a little bit disappointed. A solid IPA but I think are many better out there."
"O/D - A pretty solid example of the style. A good hop forward IPA that is nice to drink. Highly drinkable and well executed."
"Overall: At first glance, this beer does not look spectacular, but everything beyond the look of it is actually pretty excellent. This is an easy drinking beer and I would have no trouble downing a few (assuming that I had more than one)."
"Tried this for the first time and was expecting a little more from a west coast IPA. It wasn't a bad IPA, just seemed to be little subdued."
"Its`s smell has grapefruit, resin, caramel, floral hops...it is indeed an inviting aroma. The taste has quite a bit of hops, more grapefruit, pineapple too, biscuit, a very enjoyable ipa. MF is medium with quite a bit of carboantion. A very good IPA from Bear Republic."
"O: Well, itâs far from perfect, but itâs damn tasty. I wouldnât be surprised if this one were called a Belgian-Style IPA; it has that dark smell and malty flavor that Iâd expect from an import. Very nice. It makes me even more excited for the Hop Rod Rye in my fridge!"
"O: a very nice IPA not my favorite due to a slightly backed down smell, but definitely highly drinkable and a great brew on the whole"
"O - One of my favorite IPAs. The malt doesn't add much complexity, and it's not overly bitter, but the hop flavor and aroma is amazingly full."
"O: As my introduction to this brewery, I was quite impressed. A prominent grapefruit hop profile lives up to the West coast IPA style and is sure to please hop enthusiasts, especially those (like me) that love citrus. I wouldn't call this a balanced brew, as the malts are very subtle and hardly noticeable, but it doesn't come off as overly bitter or overwhelming like some IPAs. I look forward to trying out more from this brewery. Cheers!"
"Plenty of hops at Bliss today. This case-in-point pours a mostly clear sunrise golden-amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet flowers, light grass, greens, grapefruit zest, orange zest, lemon peel, and a few drops of honey in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, withe the citrus and greens really complimenting each other quite nicely. The malt is almost completely drowned-out, but the hops somehow don't o'erpower the tongue, even though they easily could. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice, hop-forward IPA that doesn't strangle the 'buds with lupulin. Pretty damn enjoyable."
"This is a good one; falls short of the hop bomb category; not overtly bitter and has a fairly crisp finish. Really nice, mainstream example of a West Coast IPA."
"Came across this one by happenstance as the due to a mixup when my better half was deciding between a few different options - anyways, when the bartender said it was a IPA instead of the scotch ale, I was the beneficiary of the Racer5. The pour was at the perfect temperature with- foam was modest. Minor floral and fruit aroma. Taste was of citrus. Clean. Definitely will keep on my list."
"This is one of my favorite IPA's a definite go to when I want a good IPA and don't want to risk trying something new. Has just the right amount of hoppyness to give it a kick without being overpowering. Very Smooth and easy to drink would never guess it was packing 7% alcohol. It also looks spectacular I poured it in to a pint glass and it has a spectacular orangish hue with a fluffy orange tinged head that lasted all the way till it was gone."
"Overall: A really great IPA this could be one of my favorite IPA that I have had."
"A really great IPA! I'll be having more of this one."
"Possibly one of my new favorite IPAs, this brew is complex but fantastically drinkable. Not excessively bitter by any means, it really showcases well the several different kind of hops involved. Considering I'm probably not going to be seeing too many AIPAs in the coming months, I'm glad I grabbed this when I did."
"D: pretty light drinking AIPA considering the 7%ABV nametag. well balanced while accenting tropical american hops. not my all time favorite, but certainly in the conversation of great AIPA's."
"RACE to your nearest beer establishment and grab the BEAR by the REPUBLIC. Close enough."
"M: Medium bodied with really nice carbonation"
"Get this beer! You will love it, and if you paid what I did for it you will be in one of those WIN WIN situations! Cheers!"
"Hell yeah. This was the kind of hop bite I've been craving. I'm a total hop head and few IPAs can quench my thirst for bitter hop flavor like this one can."
"o- Good Ipa. Not great, but enjoyable."
"O-definitely an enjoyable IPA though its not as great as everyone makes it seem to make it. the hops and bitterness seem to be faded. this might only meet hops heads half way."
"O â Not a bad IPA. The dusty note on the backend keep this a solid point lower than where it could have been imho."
"O - Not my beer, just far to sweet"
"D - This one is great!! I think what make this beer so good is the fine line of not over-doing 'it' in any particular area (hops, fruity-flavor, pine/spice, carbonation, and last but not least, alcohol level). VERY refreshing and will get again and...â¦Goinâ to look for a tap ASAP!!!"
"O - One of my favorite brews at the moment, so definitely something that I would recommend. Don't see this one falling out of my regular rotation anytime soon..."
"O - The flavor is really well-balanced and the mouthfeel is great. Plus, the relatively low abv make this a truly phenomenal IPA."
"O: A really good IPA with a terrific nose, and even though it didn't 'wow' me with its flavor profile it's still an 'A' beer all around. Really good drinkability."
"O- I've let it warm a bit to get a better grasp on the taste and mouthfeel. This is a tasty, high-quality American IPA. However, for the price in Ohio ($11) I think I'd grab a $9 half-rack of Smuttynose IPA before buying this again. If I came across it as the only IPA on tap at a bar, I'd probably end up spending a lot of money on it. Well worth a try."
"O-A very well put together IPA however the lack of carbonation is disappointing, however solid bitterness and balanced pine notes make up for it."
"12oz bottle. Pours a slightly murky amber color with a 1/2inch of head. Some lacing. Great hoppy smell. Sharp aroma of citrus hops as well as pine. Smells a bit on the sweet side. Taste has a mix of pine and citrus hops, but the pine is the most prevalent. Good amount of sweet malt flavor as well. Bitter and oily pine towards the end. Nice balance of dryness. This is a damn solid IPA I wish was available in CT. I always grab some when I'm out of state. Overall, easily one of the better IPAs out there."
"D - Good drinkability. Very hop oriented, but still nicely balanced with many different flavors. This has become one of my favorite IPAs, it is simply delicious. Highly recommended."
"Now to my Two Hearted comparison (which won't be part of this review)..."
"Racer 5, pours a dark copper color with a nice lacing head. The smell is hoppy, and floral. The taste starts of almost sweet and very floral, very hoppy, and finishes with the bitterness that you would expect from an IPA. Good strong flavor, but very easy to drink, hard to get sick of this one. Overall a good IPA, very solid, not the greatest, but an sure choice to goto."
"O: Great summer drinking beer. Big thanks to a good friend who brought some by my apartment!"
"O - this isn't a very complex west coast IPA but is a very solid example, not palate wrecking but is piny with a superb balance, very drinkable and smooth, like the mellower little brother to Green Flash West Coast IPA, a really nice IPA example but does kinda lack that big fresh grapefruit/fruitiness character."
"Overall, this is a good IPA, featuring strong, balanced, and flavorful hops. Beginners might find the intensity of these hops overpowering, but hop-heads will surely rejoice."
"The mouthfeel is on the moderately-full side. Low, yet fizzy carbonation."
"O: Pretty much the only IPA I buy six packs of regularly. Really enjoy this beer. It is a perfect representation of a west coast IPA."
"I love this beer, and at around $10 a sixer year around, its nearly impossible to beat on the value front. Outside of Lagunitas, I really don't see how you can do much better. Cheers!"
"Notes - There are some who would choose to knock this beer for lack of complexity, but the truth is that this beer really is one of the great in the single-ipa department for how well everything is blanced and melds together. That may contribute to a lack of depth, but honestly, how complex do you want thing thing to be? A great example of a bottle conditioned IPA."
"Appearance 3/5; Aroma 3/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 4.5/5"
" Overall very tastey IPA, A hop bomb in every sense of the word.I like it! A must try."
"Another very good offering from Bear Republic. I've enjoyed every beer of theirs I've ever had only wish I wouldn't have to drive to Ohio to get them."
"These IPAs are starting to appeal to me! This brew poured up a cloudy/hazy golden-orange body with a frothy head possessing excellent retention and lacing. Loads of aromas of citrusy hops with just a tiny hint of roasted malts. It has a good sharp bite all the way through followed up with just enough sweet malts to smooth it out for a nice, crisp, clean finish with no harsh aftertaste; almost like a mixture of flavors of cotton candy and caramel lingering on the finish. As it warms the hops and malts blend so much more âflavorfullyâ."
"O: A decent brew, but nothing more. Certainly one-dimensional, with the hops taking the lead from the start and never giving way to the malts. Bitter without being sweet, I didn't find much refreshment here. Oddly, this is slightly ""watery", with a faded flavor profile, similar to Bear Republic's Big Bear Black Stout, which was equally unimpressive. I'm being generous giving this a B-."
"O: I like this. It's a good, solid IPA. I'd have another. Recommended."
"""This hoppy American IPA is a full bodied beer brewed American pale and crystalmalts, and heavily hopped with Chinook, Cascade, Columbus and Centennial."""
"Arrived a light copper with no head, carbonation bubbles cling to the side of the glass. Nose is citrus and hop flowers. Taste is mildly sweet with grapefruit-citrus and floral hops. The bitterness from the hops is evident, but very well balanced and mild. Medium body and nicely carbonated. I could drink this beer for hours (as I have done in the past)."
"Overall a good IPA. I think I like the Smutty better."
"I don't think the palm trees are as common when you get as north as Healdsburg, but this thing is tropical enough to serve with an umbrella garnish. That said, it is still a tremendously bitter beer and the combination of the two qualities makes this among the best of American IPAs, as good (and better than many) as any others produced in the Golden State."
"Postscript: This is why I need to read more and drink less. I absolutely had NO idea that bottled versions of this beer were bottle conditioned. That explains the flaky, murky appearance of this brew... and also another reason why it's so damn tasty."
"I enjoyed this beer. It isn't over complex, but does a great job of what it attempts to be."
"D ~ It was poorly toeing the line between hop-bomb & malt balance. Boozy and very spicy, I was turned off but what they were going for with this one. As resinous as a IIPA without the cleverly masked ABV. Wouldn't recommend."
"Pretty good IPA here. I like that there's some balance to it, but there isn't any mistake that it's a pretty hoppy one as well. I was in the mood for a more hop forward IPA, and this fit the bill."
"Poured a meager 1/4"" white head. Attractive hazy apricot orange and yellow in color. Smell and taste are both fairly mild but sweet and fruity. This is a much easier drinking IPA than so many of the other craft beers, but then again it doesn't have nearly the hoppy punch that real hopheads crave. Good but not outstanding. And might I add just one pint of this gave me quite a headache the next morning."
"O - A great example of a AIPA. Really tasty."
"O - One of my favorite IPAs so far. So smooth and drinkable for how brilliant the hop character is. Highly recommended brew."
"O- The hype this beer gets is for a reason...it's awesome."
"Overall - I wasn't all that impressed. I had high hopes, but the hop presence just wasn't there."
"Pours a clear orangish gold, finger of off-white foam with medium sized bubbles, okay retention and good lacing. Smells like orange, pineapple, passion fruit, mango, some pineyness in the secondary. Delicious, clean aromas. Tastes is a little more pine forward, with orange and pineapple, a moderate dose of malt, and a long, moderately bitter finish. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, slightly oily. Overall, this is a great everyday IPA: good taste, great value."
"D - Very good but I like it better on-tap, which improves the mouthfeel and aroma."
"Pretty hazy brew, light gold color on the bottom half and a darker orange color on the top half. Small white head leaves its impression on the glass. Sweet malts backed by sticky hop sap for the scent. Mmm. Thats a goodin. Sweet malt start gets dominated by a nice thick blend of hops. Citrusy, oily, flowery, bitter. This brews for the hop-lovers. Medium bodied and smooth. Lovely drink."
"Bear Republic rarely disappoints. They are one of the most consistent breweries going and definitely have an appreciation for hoppy beers. This beer has a wonderful color, smells delicious and the taste meets those expectations. This is a tasty IPA that provides that crisp hoppiness you get with a good IPA but doesn't overwhelm the palate. This beer is very drinkable and should be consumed often."
"All were in agreement it was just okay - and being able to have the option to try anyother IPA blindly in front of us over that one would do so."
"Overall I knew this was a fresh bottle and when fresh this is a must try IPA."
"Mouthfeel: smooth and creamy with a full bodied texture."
"A very tasty, mostly hoppy IPA, with great pine and subtle citrus flavors. Not overpoweringly bitter, but really brings the tasty aromatics out of the hops. I have nothing bad to say about it, and I will definitely drink it again."
"D/O: Drinkability is High. Very high. I love this beer. So much so that this bottle is actually my second of the evening. I liked the first one so much I decided to review the second."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good IPA. The hops are there in abundance and are pretty assertive and combine citrus, pine, and floral hops together to make for a great hop profile that is balanced well and doesn't completely overshadow the malt base like it did in the aroma. Everything was pretty spot on in this IPA and I liked the drinkability and mouthfeel the most with the rest being almost as good, if I had another one I would drink it, it hits the spot on this warm summer night. I would buy this beer again, I like how it combined the different aspects of hops together rather then just focusing one aspect. I recommend this beer to any hop head or IPA lover, it will calm your hop cravings. This was another home run for Bear Republic, now I feel like I have to try the rest of their lineup since everything I have had from them so far has been very well done."
"D-This is an incredibly balanced, yet flavorful IPA. I've had this one before, but I'm not sure why I haven't revisited it since. I'll be sure to in the future."
"Poured into a paper cup (I know, but it was all that was available. At least I got a cup!). Dark gold with a yellow-white pillowy head. Bottle conditioned, so some sediment. Pine hops aroma and taste with some malt and alcohol aftertaste. Went well with a pepperoni pizza. A solid IPA."
"Pours a hazy orangish copper like color that has visible floatees with a one finger head which gives way to skim and leaves a little bit of lace on the glass. The aroma is of a nice floral presence combined with a citrus, lemons, oranges, and grapefruit smell. There is then a hint of an earthy hop bite at the end. The taste is balanced by a sweet malt backbone with hints of citrus. In the tail end of the beginning the rest of the way through there is an earthy hop bite, not a huge bitter bite, but a nice and smooth hop bite. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is a solid beer, it is something I would go back to for sure. It is well balanced yet pretty straight forward for an ipa."
"Overall this is an excellent IPA with a full on confident hop flavor, that's very easy to drink and not overwhelming. It's a great balance and I think close to ideal for an IPA to me. Looking forward to trying it again!"
"Hits you with powerful citrus hops, lots of flavor popping around, backed up by a solid, sweet malty spine. An excellent beer. I had this on tap at Shady McGrady's after the Harrisburg beer fest and it stood out against all the other IPAs I tried that day."
"Not the best BR I've had"
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Marble Brewery shaker glass. Golden orange and slightly hazy. Fluffy pale head, about 2 fingers deep. Straight up citrus in my nose (mostly orange and lemon). Light bitterness on the palate up front, then a kick of pine and citrus, followed by a huge lingering bitterness. Very tasty. Simple but excellent. Creamy while the beer is in my mouth. After swallowing, a tacky, tannin-y, resiny finish. One of my favorites."
"A tasty American IPA."
"O - an outstanding Amer. IPA, particularly suitable for those who prefer a strong aromatic contribution from hops more than a strong flavor or pronounced bitterness. Quite different than, but overall about on par with, the local Sweetwater IPA I had (for about the 20th time) earlier this week."
"This pours a nice light brown/orange. The head is moderate with larger pebbles and acceptable retention; the lacing is good as well. The nose isnât super strong, but the usual smells are there. I wouldnât call this a hop bomb, but it has a fairly large hop presence, but then a smooth malt finish. This is a solid beer that has a great well-rounded taste and feel. My only criticism is that it seems a little heavy and slimy and I wish there was a little more distinction. Then again, not all beers need to taste like a grapefruit I suppose."
"Overall: Very drinkable IPA not excessively hoppy, great to sip on. One of the better IPA's i've ever tasted."
"O - Overall, I really like this beer and if it were easily accessible I would drink a lot of it. The only offering I've had from Bear Republic, would love to try more."
"Racer 5 was a beer that a friend of mine suggested that I try. I ran to my local Wegman's and grabbed a bomber of it the next day. Opened it up and it poured out as a really nice yellowish gold color. The head a lacing were very nice. The smell of the beer was really hoppy for just a regular IPA. The taste was also much hoppier than I expected it to be, lots of citrusy pine flavors that fade into a strong bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very drinkable. Overall this beer kicks ass. I could drink this one over and over again. I'd love to try Racer X one day."
"O- A very good IPA and one worth seeking out. It certainly is a hop-centric beer, but it never pretended to be anything else. Aggressive, yet refreshing."
"M - Medium body with a juicy, lush finish. As mentioned earlier, this beer has an incredibly smooth, creamy character to it that lends to its drinkability."
"This is a very nice brew and I intend on enjoying my six pack. I recommend you do the same."
"If you like Lagunitas, Stone, and other big West Coast IPAs, I'd recommend this one, and like these other representatives, it has a substance to back up the hop punch. Cheers."
"O- Nice solid IPA, little too malty for my taste, was expecting the hops to be more pronounced, still overall it was a tasty beer."
"This one fell a bit flat for me. Appearance and smell are alright, but the taste is just not quite there. I expect a west coast IPA to have a certain hop-forward character and this did not at all. Perhaps this 6-pack was old, but this just did not satisfy my hop craving. A solid beer overall, but lacking in hops."
"As soon as I cracked this open wafts of hops hit me and it was incredible. this is the classic IPA. The hops were not listed, my pet peeve with IPAs... Hoppy, amazing aromas and lingering finish! I was expected something huge though based on the aromas."
"Overall- To be honest this beer was overhyped a little too much by my go to liquor store guy, I guess I was expecting more from it although it was not bad in anyway at all. There is a big hop presence although not overpowered and equally balanced by a nice malty flavour. I would pick this one up again although I would not go out of my way to get it, happy I tried and didnât overpay for it but unless it was under $8 a six pack I donât think I would revisit it, thereâs just too many other east coast IPAâs that are miles ahead of this one."
"Overall: A great IPA. I'm not sure that it live up to its enormous hype but it is still a well-made, well-balanced West Coast IPA. Worth a try at least..."
"O: A fairly decent IPA. Very hop oriented"
"I'd grab this again but I think they're hop rod rye has a bit more going for it... Lots of hops with a balance of rye."
"Overall good IPA. Typical flavors done well"
"Overall a good beer."
"O: This is definitely a fine brew that I would associate more with the East Coast than Cali, but it is delicious for sure"
"Also a testament to the tried and tested wisdom that car-themed beers are usually good."
"Overall/notes - Really good IPA! The flavor, while perhaps a bit unbalanced, is spot-on in its citrusy tones. This makes me eager to dive into my bottle of Hop Rod in the fridge!"
"O - This is a straight up good beer. Very well balanced IPA. Well worth the 10 dollars I spent on the six pack."
"I grab a couple bombers a month. It's a nice, affordable, West Coast IPA, and super easy to find. Just tried their Hop Rod Rye which I liked (and will review later). Go Bear Republic."
"Overall this is an IPA for IPA lovers. Seriously, the label is just dern silly but you must try this beer if you like hops."
"I poured this beer into a Gulden Drak tulip glass hoping to focus the smell better. I cooled the beer to 45 degrees, and when it poured, it had a finger's worth of off-white head that left a faint lace on my glass. The smell was a very mellow citrus smell, like OJ from concentrate at room temperature. I wasn't beaten over the head with the hops, and I liked it. When I drank it, the whole beer seemed balanced. It was one of the few times that I wasn't focused on one specific aspect of the beer, and that made it extremely drinkable."
"Wow a go to IPA. One of the best out there for sure."
"It seems full bodied and properly carbed in the mouth."
"Drinkability is off the charts... Unfortunately drinking too many of these in a short amount of time will render you incapacitated."
"O: well crafted brew. Diamond in the rough for me. Always have this beer available, don't know why I've not been hooked to this before - likely due to no bottle date."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange-ish color with some visible carbonation. Head is about 1 finger tall, retention is moderate, but it leaves some lacing. Smell is of sweet citrus with a bit of a floral smell. I am impressed with the taste of this beer, citrus is highlighted well while still retaining a malt balance. The floral and citrus hops come out at the beginning, but the citrus isn't sweet like the smell. Towards the end of the drinkni get some of that malt balance that helps regulate this beer so well. Mouthfeel is just below medium, and carbon is appropriate. Overall this is a good IPA, if I lived in Cali I'd definitely drink it regularly, but I've already got Portland beers."
"D: This is one of my favorite IPAs. its pretty sessionable because of the light body, but the hoppiness is very present without being overwhelming"
"O: A nice IPA, good but not great, plenty refreshing for a warm spring day. Would buy it again, if only it were available in Iowa. An easy drinker whose flavor stays alive until the end of the glass."
"I will buy more of this to enjoy this summer!!"
"Wow. This is a great American IPA. Really what a great brew. Looking forward to finishing up this six pack and then getting some more for the hot summer."
"O: For a standard IPA, it doesn't get much better than this. Perfectly balanced and hoppy in all the right ways. This is the kind of IPA that you keep coming back to."
"D- Extremely drinkable, and very balanced. A pretty good example of a west coast style IPA. Almost in the center between IPAs and DIPAs. While I always tend to try brews I haven't had before, I'm sure sooner or later I'll come back and get a bit more of this."
"Now available in some East Coast locations, hopefully more soon!"
"Overall, a delicious beer that I would love to smell every day. As far as the taste goes: it doesn't blow my mind, but is a very solid specimen."
"Thin off-white head and very good head retention. Hazy golden colored body with a lot of tiny yeast particles. Good hoppy aroma. Mostly grapefruit, slightly minty. Has a nice acidic twang from the fruity hops. I'd like the malts to play a bigger part in the taste, but that's a minor gripe. Overall a good IPA if that's what you're in the market for."
"Definitely would try this again. Top 5 IPA for me."
"Ending notes: This is one of my favorite IPAs. It's on the complex side, and it's very sessionable. I will definitely be getting this one again."
"For seven percent this is extremely drinkable and satisfying. Also for only five bones for a 22 oz this is good value ."
"Overall: A very refreshing beer and a great example of an American IPA, big American hop smell and flavor, but very the bitterness is very well-balanced with malty sweetness."
"O. A very good IPA that I'd now rank in my top 5 IPA's. A must try."
"This is something to definitely seek out if you get the chance. I'm honored to have tried it."
"O- one of the best american ipa's I've had. I may be a little biased because the west coast style is my favorite. regardless of that, this is a solid ipa that any fans of the style will like."
"poured bomber into sam adams glass. had 2 fingers head with a good amount of lacing. cloudy orange in color. smells of citrus and spice and everything nice. theres grapefruit, orange, pine and big floral hops. taste follows the nose with a slightly bitter bite left on the tongue. mouthfeel is slightly over carbonated. overall this is an excellent ipa."
"O-Probably one of my top 5 most readily available IPA'S in Ohio. If you haven't tried this yet, get some!"
"O: Ask any hophead: this is one of their staples. I have to say.... I'm a fan."
"O- Send me more. I only received 1 22 oz. yesterday and this bitch is now gone."
"All around, this is a very good AIPA. I do like a more assertive hop presence in this style but I am iffy on how fresh this is. As already stated, I purchased this at PG on a shelf at room temp. I would love to try this knowing it was fresh and will take the opportunity if it presents itself. Again, a very good AIPA but far from the best in the style."
"D-Overall this was just ok for me. Too much grapefruit came through. But it was still enjoyable. Just not somehting i would pick up everyday."
"This is a winner. I'll buy it again without hesitation."
"Not a top-of-the-line IPA, nor as good as the in-house draft, but worth the price of admission."
"O: Really amazing brew, certainly one of the best IPAs from California, and it's on tap pretty much everywhere I've been that has a decent beer menu here in LA. Really top notch beer and I am looking forward to finishing this 6 pack this week."
"Pours a light orange with a little bit of head, beautiful! Smells very citrussy, little hoppy but overal extremely inviting. Tastes so many things at once, buttery, citrus, hoppy ooo this is nice! There is an alcohol kick toward the end that I didn't expect but it's not bothersome at all. Overal a great beer, wish we could get it in MS!"
"Overall this IPA is yummy. There is a considerable deviance fron the blossoming nose to a more two-dimensional flavor experience. The flavors aren't bad, just a bit narrow and restrictive. It reminds me of a terrific homebrew that I'd definitely scrounge a growler of. Very rustic and unrefined, but I believe this is the simple allure of this ale. I absolutely enjoyed it."
"Pours exceptionally cloudy with lots of chunky sediment and an off white head with above average lacing. Smells mostly of pine with a bit of citrus. Not much malt smell getting through as expected. Surprised by a bit of nice floral hop in the taste. Warms the throat slightly but not boozy at all. Hop bitterness is dry but last for a long long time. A little astringent but in a good way. Pretty solid IPA and a good example of what this style should be. I'll get it again and would recommend it to any who appreciate hops."
"I gotta say, this is one really good IPA. I'm an IPA guy and this one is heavy on the hops but also balanced in a way that is perfectly pleasant. Really good beer."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the aroma. It was nectary sweet amongst a bouquet of flowers, with some oddities, like that spicy mustard seed. Unlike many others in the style, here the hops took a delicate back seat, making this more than the typical IPA. One criticism is that it was a bit on the sour end, but this ultimately didnât take much away, but rather gave it another unique aspect for the style."
"Overall-Just an outstanding beer. It usually takes a higher ABV brew to get this much flavor. Probably the most flavorful and drinkable 7% IPA I've had."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. The American IPA poured a hazy orange color. It produced a thick creamy head and had excellent head retention. (Most impressive head I have ever seen on a beer.) There was a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma was dominated by hops and citrus. When I say dominated by hops, I meant this aroma is HOPTASTIC! The taste of the IPA was like a slap in the face with a hop club. BAM! The front, middle and finish of the taste was all about hops. This is a hopheads dream come true. Somehow despite all of the hop bitterness, the smoothness of the beer was off the charts. Awesome beer, one of my new all time favorites!"
"D - Very nice, this is clearly an IPA with generous hop character and an emphasis on pine character. The malt, however, is by no means lost in the shuffle. There is plenty of rich bready grain character and just enough caramel to add complexity without drowning out or dulling the hops. Well worth trying, I only with it was available closer to home."
"Definitely a beer I will seek out again..."
"Pours a hazy, hazy pale orange with a one-finger slightly off-white head. Very good lacing and head retention. Hoppy aroma. Sweet orange, grapefruit, mango and pine. Tastes begins with an excellent sweet creamy orange flavor. Sugary grapefruit follows. Biscuity and caramel malt and a bit of pine resin finish it out. Extremely smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Awesomely sessionable IPA."
"Overall- this beer is better than two hearted but behind huma lupa in my opinion. this is my first six pack but hope the rest i buy are all solid unlike my luck with two hearted's consistency. the only thing negativie i can really say is the $11.99 six pack isn't too great."
"Overall: Definitely worth a try, but only if you're into IPAs and their compadres. I almost wish I had bought a six-pack of these (rather than the single that I found), but there'll be another chance, I'm sure."
"Overall, I feel like this is a somewhat quintessential IPA. It's not extreme, not overly bitter or sweet, not pushing any limits; it's just a solid, well-crafted beer. Very ""to style", but nothing that really makes it stand out to me."
"I have mentioned in other reviews that I think my pallet is changing over the years. This beer is a perfect example of my theory. Racer 5 has been readily available to me for years and I have enjoyed it for as long, but as I sit here to write down what I am experiencing I realize it is kind of a one trick pony. Which at on time I really enjoyed, and still do, but not quite as much as I once did. I think that it is only fair to give it a score based on it's entire life with me not just tonight. Highly recommended!!"
"T: There's a ton of really nice hop bitterness here with just enough malt to hold it down. The hops hit right away, hard and piny, and they are drawn out forever. There's a touch of tropical sweetness towards the end and then a nice and fairly clean finish. Really nicely done."
"O â A contender and now on my best of IPA list, alcohol not even on the radar, very drinkable and (short) sessionable, looking forward to my next glass and more BR beers 4.5"
"Overal Racer 5 is a standby in the IPA culture, worth a look."
"D: Certainly deserving of top-tier status amongst West Coast IPAs, Racer 5 may be one of the worthiest and most appropriate benchmarks by which to measure others of the style. Not only are flavors bright and clean in a way that is not at all self-conscious, they are nicely balanced. It bears similarities to Port Wipeout IPA and Ballast Point Big Eye IPA (especially to the former)."
"Overall, this is a great IPA and one of my all time favorites. There are better examples out there but this is in my top five. Give it a whirl!"
"Overall, this is another great west coast ipa. The golden colour and lightness of the body as well as the fresh and dancing hoppiness exemplify this variation. Brews at this point in the spectrum allow enthusiasts to experience some dynamics within a style that can take on some interesting variances in characteristics, but often gets pegged as mundane. From the golden end, where this delicious treat marks its territory, to deep copper and all points in between, the ipa style can still raise an eyebrow. This is a very enjoyable brew. Glad to see it on the shelf in Michigan now!"
"O- This is a fantastic IPA that packs a nice bite and has great balance between all the different hop flavors. This is now one of my favorite IPAs."
"Very well balanced IPA with good ABV. Easy drinker. Good with a steak, burger or fried pub grub. Oh ya, a Nascar race works too."
"D - fantastic. This is one of the best IPA's I've ever had. It's up there with Cigar City's Jai Alai in my opinion. A Tier 1 IPA. Give me more!"
"O: This one seemed a bit off for the style. Got it from the store's cooler so I think it was fresh, but this one seemed slightly weak and more hop forward. I would drink this again, but believe there are much better American IPAs out there."
"O: I cant believe the score on this but the brew was near perfection for me. Juicy hoppiness with the right amount of malt and bitterness. So floral and citrusy. I drank two."
"O - can't go wrong buying this one for $5 a bomber. this is a good ipa and i enjoyed the different malt presence, not my favorite ipa but i don't know what is. I wouldn't mind some more tropical flavors for deviation..."
"Overall - A fantastic IPA. I really enjoyed this one. I thought it was a little too sweet at the beginning but the bitter hops really helped balance it out. The mouthfeel left a bit to be desired, but I thought this was a top IPA."
"An awesome IPA when fresh. Yum."
"Served on-tap at the La Jolla Brewhouse in CA. The beer was served in a pint glass, and it pours a clear yellow-gold color with a thin, filmy head. Well rounded aromas of sweet malt and light hops, with citrus and slight spicy highlights. The flavors are bitter and sour initially, with a bit of green and peppery taste at the end. The body is creamy and buttery; very smooth. Hoppy and tart aftertaste, which is very pleasant, and an easy, smooth finish. A very tasty brew!"
"O: Bear Republic beers all have a very distinguishable taste; it's the essence of California. No matter what your preference is, definitely check this one out."
"Bomber finished in a flash."
"O- A good IPA. But not great. I'm not sure of how fresh this one was but I'm sure it would be better the fresher you can get it."
"O: For a single IPA, this is great stuff. It's nothing extreme, just juicy tropical fruits with a good balance of bitterness and a light malt body. I tend to love the more extreme IPAs, but this is really solid for what it is."
"O:"
"Drink - Definitely one of my favourite IPA's but I might have ran into an old keg. It seemed to have a more toned down flavour than it did from the bottles I've had in the past."
"Mouthfeel is very sticky, very full, and only slightly carbonated. This is a very malty beer, and the caramel malts add a lot more to the feel than the hops. The finish is nicely bittersweet. Drinkability is helped a lot by that, and also by the fruity beginning to each sip, although the sweetness may put some off. I'm sure this beer when really, really fresh is a hop monster to be reckoned with. Definitely one of the better single IPAs on the market along with Surly Furious."
"Overall Drinkability - Best IPA I've had so far."
"This beer is my favorite IPA. It has everything that I expect from an IPA without being ""extreme'/ 'imperial'/ 'double"": a nice fruity aroma which explodes with great hop flavor. In spite of the hoppiness, it maintains a nice malt balance. I love it!!"
"Very very good."
"Overall this is a very good go-to beer!"
"O- What a great beer. It doesn't go over the top, but that's part of what makes it so great- it just hits all it's marks quite perfectly and on time. This may very well be the standard-bearer in my opinion. It's somewhere between IPA and DIPA in the way it feels and tastes, but it's all goodness. So well balanced and drinkable it's scary."
"D: Good"
"Second beer of the night last night at the Yard House, Dedham, as my drink with appetizers. Served on tap into a pint glass. Bright yellow color with a fizzy white head and plenty of carbonation. Smell was hoppy, but not overly powerful. Taste was much more agreeable than I expected. While I am not a huge IPA fan, this one tasted excellent. It had hops, sure, but it didn't blow your palate off. Just a nice dose of hops that tasted great. Mouthfeel was not overly bitter like some IPAs, but instead was smooth and crisp. This IPA was a surprise because of how much I liked it, and it rose to the top of my list of the style. Very well made beer for all types of craft beer lovers."
"O - Actually the first time I've had this beer, and I can understand the popularity, great sessionable IPA."
"This IPA is certainly unique in the way the yeast and malts combine to balance out the hops. This combination makes for a beer that delivers in hops yet is delicate and very well balanced."
"Overall it's extremely drinkable and palpable. Two thumbs up."
"O- This is a brilliant IPA! I have a feeling that this is going to be my new go to India Pale Ale. I'm really digging and wishing this one wouldn't end!"
"Pours a light, hazy amber with minimal head and minimal carbonation. Wonderful aroma of pine and citrus with a bit of maltiness in the background. Up front pine and citrus followed by some mild fruit flavors and finishing ever so slightly tart. Very drinkable beer, light on the palate with a bit of a lingering aftertaste."
"O: A good IPA, a very drinkable beer, but it's basically a mild hop bomb. Not much complexity, just delicious hops. I have given up being impressed with simple, heavily hopped beer, but it is good and well balanced. If you're looking for something unique, though, look elsewhere."
"Overall, the hoppy bitterness may have faded overtime in this barrel but im not sure if this is due to age or if it is the intended direction. Either way, nicely done and quite refreshing"
"This beer was easy to drink and I could easily but a few back in one sitting. I really enjoyed it and would pick up a few bottles again ."
"This is one tasty, easy drinking IPA. Very close to perfection as far as an IPA goes. Definitely on my top five IPA list."
"overall - id recommend this to any ipa fan. wouldn't get a 6 pack but single is nice"
"Bear Republic's Racer 5 is one of the top AIPA's for a reason, and is a cornerstone of the style. I have returned to this time and time again, and will continue to for years to come. This one borders pretty close to perfection."
"Overall - a very good beer, very available, reasonably priced, and bitter, like I like my beer."
"O: Yummy, very drinkable beer that is light but potent. Pretty yummy hop blend overall."
"O=Great IPA, readily accessible, and inexpensive. What more could you ask for?"
"M- clean with a lite cling of pine"
"Drinks very well. A really nice IPA."
"Overall a decent IPA. It has a great look in the glass and an aroma that really makes you look forward to that first sip. The hoppiness is on the mild side. Fits an IPA style, but lacks a little substance. I prefer really hoppy beers and this one comes up just a bit short for me."
"Very drinkable IPA. Have to keep my eye out for more of this."
"If you're an IPA fan and have not tried this, do yourself a favor and pick some up."
"I never really paid attention to this beer. It is always on the shelf at the local shop, very affordable and doesn't have a stand-out label (I know this shouldn't matter but a label can go a long way in making you notice a beer on a shelf among 100s of others). It's a real gem though - very drinkable; I'll have a few more for sure."
"This did not let me down. Instantly became one of my favorite IPAs."
"drinkability - this is a beer for someone who likes powerful IPA's. If you've never had one, wouldnt recomend starting off with this beer. Wish i had more, looking fwd to the DIPA now!"
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this was better than the bottle version because it was fresher. However, there are other versions of the style I prefer over this one."
"The most upfront component of this complex IPA is the gratefruit flavor. The gratefruit flavor blends nicely with the strong hoppy character. It is not a brew for those that don't care for the citrus / hop bite in an IPA. In the glass the Racer 5 is lovely. It is a gritty golden-orange color. The aroma is light and the mouthfeel is pleasantly bitter. This beer is very drinkable. Give it a try."
"Very impressed with racer 5 ipa. Not being a huge ipa guy i thought i'd finally give it a go. Sure glad i did! Appearance had me thinking i made the right decision right from the start nice reddish-brrown hue with an and above average malty head. Good aroma and tasted even better, excellent drinkability with every mouthful, definitely shoots right into my top five faves!!!"
"Good IPA, but not the hop attack I was craving."
"Very drinkable IPA. While it falls short of the top tier I would have no issues drinking a few in a sitting. I do hope we see Bear Republic expanding their offerings availability in Michigan, I will certainly pick this one up."
"One of my favourites, have only had a few times but this is one of the best beers I've had, regardless of score. Something about the total package that is really excellent."
"D - Every time I have Racer 5 I want another, but I usually end up savoring one for a while."
"D - Very good. I really like racer 5 quite a bit and this version was even better. A touch one dimensional with all those pungent hops but that really isn't a bad thing."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer. Very easy to enjoy the 22 oz bomber by yourself or with friends. Very easy to consume and given the 7% ABV. A must try for an IPA fan or one looking to try an IPA."
" This IPA is delicous, just so tangy and citrus flavored with some herbal elements giving a well round flavor of bitter orange/grapefruit notes that aren't hampered by the malt. The taste of the malt is very dry, only enough sweetness there to compliment the slight pineapple quality. The bitterness level is optimal with a low level of astringency and the hop goodness lasts for a while after the swallow. I could enjoy a quart of this IPA it is so drinkable on cask, I have enjoyed it equally in each delivery method -tap, bottle and now cask, just delicious in every way. I would prefer it on cask as the hops seem so much more vibrant and fresh this way."
"Drinkability: This is a very good beer. I really like the hop profile and will visit it again."
"D: Little unbalanced on the hoppy side. Serious beer that won't leave you underwhelmed. As good on the last sip as the first."
"This beer is dominated by citrusy and piney hops. The first word that comes to mind is resin. However, it's not too bitter. Each sip invites me back for more. It's one of those beers that tastes sticky going down your throat in every right way. The balance of hop flavor and the weight of the beer make this a very solid IPA. I'll never be disappointed to see this on tap."
"Drinkability- This was a good beer. Smooth and drinkable. Just felt more like an PA than an IPA."
"Pours a standard copper color with a small whispy head. Smells hoppy with grapefruit and orange. Palate is suprisingly balanced. Sweet and bready malts provide a canvas for the citrusy west coast hops. Soft bitterness in the finish. Moderate body and low carbonation. Very solid and tasty IPA that would probably be better fresh and on-tap."
"D - This is a quite nice west coast IPA. everything is really good for this brew. Very drinkable if just slightly one dimensional with just pine being front and center."
"Aroma is less potent then i suspected, but citrus is the theme coming through the pipeline here. Same thing with the aroma, it's mostly a citrus show, but there is baked biscuit and subtle caramel in here. Wish i had a bottle date. Has good flavors but the amplitude needs to go up a few levels. I can tell this is a good beer, but i'll pass on it until they get me some bottle dating."
"Pours a filtered golden, and has a smooth white head with good lacing. Smell is very hoppy, with a slight yeast note. Taste is amazing, very smooth for 7%. Not super sour, but with a good kick. Has a fruityness that is quite light. This is a solid beer!"
"D- super easy to polish off the pint a well done west coast ipa..had this in the bottle many times ..but it was so much better on tap"
"Edit: just visited Bear Republic's website. They don't use Simcoe hops in this beer, but rather Chinook, Cascade, Columbus and Centennial. The beer that this reminds me of (Green Flash West Coast) uses the latter three of those plus Simcoe."
"D- I wish I had more then this bomber right now. I could have a couple of these without exhausting the flavors of this brew. Racer 5, welcome to my top 5 IPA list."
"D - I enjoyed this IPA very much. Was very well crafted and balanced. I could definitely see this becoming a staple in the rotation."
"D: I'm into my third beer from the 6'r - no worries and don't plan on stoppin til they're all gone. Super easy drinker!"
"The last time I had this I went late into the night in old sac town! Much to the chigrin of my wife, as she left me to stagger back to the motel, LOL. Good stuff here, seek and drink!"
"drinkability is good but not great. I haven't had the beer for a few years and remember liking it more back then than I did now."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Very tart and bitter. Hoppy and fresh with hints of yeast."
"D: Goes down extremely easy; even if this bottle has a good deal of floaties in it, the taste is all there, and I've really enjoyed this beer both times I've had it. Will definitely pick it up again, especially at its affordable price."
"D-If IPA's are your thing, then you could sit down at the bar and down a few of these. First time I have tried this beer after hearing great reviews. Very well worth it."
"D - I could drink this one all day. It was a nice treat on the hand pump."
"D: Moderate. Not entirely sure I could session this beer. After I finished it I was looking to try something else."
"D: very good drinkability.. these things go down too quick ;)"
"Smooth and the bitterness gives it a nice bite, quite refreshing drinkability is above average for me, the fruitiness I got from this ipa helps it stand out makes it a staple when I go to the bar"
"I would recommend this to all!"
"A perennial favorite, Racer 5 sitting on the shelf at Barriques Fitchburg was a sight for sore eyes. This is a fantastic IPA and always a worthwhile purchase."
"D- Very nice, balanced and drinkable for a beer of this magnitude. All around a nice complex and flavorful beer that puts a different spin on an IPA. Not a traditional IPA, but very good none the less."
"Simply the best IPA on the planet. I have had so many, but yet, this one is still my favorite. The clean coudy harvest tone look, awesome. The head is usually thin in length but dense thickness.(if that makes any sense) Tons of citrus tones in smell. Awesome hop smell with floral with light fruit, slight pine. Fruity/floral big hop upfront with a clean finish. So easy to toss them back as the hops never overbear you. So tasty... If you enjoy IPAs, try one ASAP"
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy-orange with a lasting, white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops and bready, biscuit malt. Full, smoother than usual for IPA body. Citrusy hops balanced by bready malt on the palate with some hints of ripe fruit. Medium, not so hoppy finish. Very pleasant, delicious IPA."
"Drinkable and enjoyable, and it was quite good, especially to an IPA enthusiast such as myself but I must need to have several others to see what all the hype is about and buy into it. Would have it again..."
"Reasonable. It's not my personal #1 IPA, but it's very good nonetheless. If I'm looking for hops with less fruit, this is probably the one for me."
"Drinkability. A good drinker. Medium bodided but 7% is concealed nicely. This bomber is going, going, gone!"
"D - high, would make this a go-to six pack when I make it into NY or MA, but lack of freshness dates on bottles means I usually steer clear....great beer tho"
"I'll change the review if I get the opportunity to try this again at home from a bottle in the future --"
"D: At 7%, and with it's incredible balance, this brew is definitely a good drinking IPA."
"Drinkability is very good. Strong hop flavors with a light enough body for multiple pints but nothing too overpowering."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a small head. Smell is of hops, some citrus. Taste is dominated by hops, some citrus and hints of malts, very flavorful. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"A strange twist on an IPA for me. The smell was lacking the characteristic grapefruit/hops smell that I tend to notice most frequently associated with American IPA's. The taste is very balanced for being as bitter(75+ IBU's). From the pour, to smell, to tasting this beer was a wonderful ride that being constructed so well culminate in an award winning brew. 7% ABV is the only thing that keeps it from a session. GREAT BEER BEAR REPUBLIC BREWING CO!!!"
"D: Really enjoyed this beer. Passed this beer up one time before and really glad i went with this at dinner tonight. Will definitely be getting this again very soon."
"More drinking, less typing...."
"This pours a hazy orange with a white head that fades in the snifter. The small bubbles don't leave any lacing. On the nose there is a bright pine presence, not overwhelming, probably due to a sweeter mixture of figs and such below the hops. On the tongue it's predominantly grapefruit. In the mouth it's a little thin, but with a pleasing carbonation that keeps the hops around after the swallow. It's quite drinkable, and I think it's a pretty good example of an IPA."
"Overall, this is fantastic. This will be my go to IPA for the time being. I think the checkered flag on the front of the bottle suits this podium finishing beer."
"Pours a nice golden color with a white frothy head, sticks to the side of the glass all the way through. Big citrus hops, lots of grapefruit and mango. Solid. Taste follows suit... citrusy hops with a good amount of bitterness. Finishes pretty dry and clean, giving it great drinkability. I could definitely get most of the way through a sixer if I had a little motivation. Very solid IPA, and one I pick up when I get the opportunity."
"I don't think I could drink more than one or two bottles in a sitting due to the heavy, sticky, syrup texture of the beer. Prefer the dryer finish found in a Sierra Nevada or Russian River IPA (RR IPA or Blind Pig)"
"the consistency is jut amazing. Im very impressed by such a quality!"
"D: Loved this beer, I have had it many times and I keep on coming back to it when I want an affordable and consistently good IPA."
"D- This beer is extremely drinkable. I often pass it up, i will not be so unwise next trip at the beer store. One damn fine IPA."
"This beer lives up to the hype. I've been putting off trying this beer for a long time because of the label. Boy was I wrong...Basically a tropical citrus wonderland resting on a crystal caramel malt crust. The herbal and evergreen balances out the huge hop profile wonderfully. This a flavor assault...period. The great thing about the hops is the flavor and not necessarily the bitterness. The malt is perfect and is in perfect unison with the hops. This beer is a flavor giant and you should not let this pass you up. Don't judge a book by it's cover....lesson learned."
"Decided to finally review this the other night...I thought I had already reviewed it since it is one of my go-to IPAs for everyday drinkin. Pours slightly clear amber color with a medium white head. Scent is extremely sweet and hoppy with a lot of pine. Smells AMAZING! Taste is citrusy (grapefruit and orange) with nice fresh hop flavor. I also get a light malt backbone (very light---this is the west coast afterall). The pine flavors dominate throughout, making this one tasty IPA. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and very complex. Drinkability is very high. This beer is AMAZING fresh! It can turn for the worst rather quickly though. Definitely one of my favorite IPAs when fresh."
"Final Thoughts - This beer used to get much more praise from hopheads 3 years ago and before. Along came the Sculpins being bottled and the Blind Pigs and Union Jacks and I feel Racer 5 fell a bit by the way side the these. Make no mistake, a fresh racer 5 is arguably as good as all the other over hyped single IPAs mentioned here on BA. I'd never turn one down."
"Drinkability- This was a really good beer. It went down smooth, but you could still feel the slight burn of the alcohol."
"d - drinkability is very good. I'd drink it again but have to deduct just a little bit for the mouth-wrecking it gave me. I'd drink it again but would stop at 1."
"7 is my favorite number, and i could drink a few bottles of this easily. Each time i put the glass down i find myself reaching back for it. Shame i went for the bomber and not the six pack."
"This is a well rounded brew that is medium in body with a modest amount of carbonation. It is quite drinkable and balanced. This is another bear republic offering that I have passed by multiple times without giving a try. I have no idea how fresh this offering is but I would love to have this again as fresh as possible."
"Overall this beer is fantastic, definitely a unique ipa thats a similar to a double ipa. If it had not been for the overwhelming malt character, this beer may have been 5's all across the board. While the hop character was strong, it was a little disappointing to see some of the the hops hidden behind the sweetness. I feel like a little less sweetness could be a literal perfect ipa. BUT, it still made for a truly fantastic beer that I would recommend to anyone."
"Notes: Pretty good IPA. Solid with a good level of hoppiness with a decent level of bitterness and malt to balance it out. Pretty strong floral/herbal flavors with citrus being second. Very tasty and would gladly have another. It may not be my absolute favor IPA, but it is up there."
"Racer 5 is definitely a staple in my lineup. A great all around IPA. Being in CA it is a relatively cheap purchase for a bomber ($4) and never dissapoints when I need my Lupulin fix!"
"Note: I wish this were more readily available in 6 pack form in NYC. 5.99 a bomber , I don't think so, especially when their superior and stronger Hop Rod Rye is 5.99 a bomber, but a 9.99 6er I'd pick this up to mix it up once in a while. Hard to say I would pick this up over Smuttynose IPA at 9.99 'round here."
"Nice looking beer with some carbination and a decent head that left plenty of lacing on the glass. Plenty of hops and a nice subtle pine taste that was not overpowering. Felt very good in the mouth and was quite smooth going down despite the up front hoppiness. Some citrus flavors helped this beer stand out among other IPAs I had recently."
"Drinkability: Often gets lost in the talk of all of the great west coast ipas, but this is a very good ipa that is a good deal for the price. Very enjoyable."
"this stuff is highly underated. pured hard into tulip and sniffed with deligh. resin hops. delicious in every sense. more resiny hops and a strong bite. not off balance quite delicious. I will drink many more of these. always easy to find and cheaper than many other choices."
"Final thought - I used to think this beer was just okay. Now, I am starting to think it is pretty neat"
"By far the best recommendation someone has ever made to me at a bar. I'm always willing to try new beers as the come on tap at my local bar, but this was by far one of the best. By far is the most drinkable IPA i have ever had. Not an overly alchol taste, sweet with citrus and balanced with hops. It was the perfect combination, about 7.5% ABV and it can sneak up quickly. Another must try."
"With that being said, the first one I drank, I was only O.K. with. A bit different flavor profile than what I had been drinking lately in the IPA category... a bit more grain/cereal notes to it, so that threw me off. I had another one yesterday and liked it a bit better, even though it had minor yeast/sediment inclusions at the bottom of the bottle when I pulled it out of the refrigerator. I didn't remember seeing sediment a couple of days earlier in the previous 2-bottles?"
"NOTES: An enjoyable light to medium carbonated 7.0% ABV IPA that keeps you coming back. The alcohol is hidden until it's too late, and the beer is smooth as can be."
"22oz bottle, poured to an initially marginal head, but pretty good retention. Nice bronze-orange color, smell is a great blend of citrus, pine and just enough maltiness. Taste - paired this with some chicken divan and french bread - de-freaking-licious! Well-rounded palate with more than enough hoppy goodness to cleanse the palate."
"12 oz bottle dated 11/24/10 into a tulip. Bottle pours a nice 2 finger head with decent lacing. Yeast/hop particles float about the liquid, due to bottle conditioning. The scent is a pleasant medley of pine and grapefruit. Taste is citrus/pine with some bready malt and bitter grapefruit on the back end. Mouthfeel is medium with nice carbonation and very smooth. Drinkability is top-notch. I can always knock down several of these. One of my favorite IPAs, and always easy to find in my neck of the woods."
"D- not the most drinkable ipa I have ever had but still very easy and enjoyable. The smell really brings you in and your not left with an incredible bitter aftertaste"
"D- if you like hops this is your ipa. drinkability is awesome for 7%abv. almost session like. not too heavy, but not light either. have no problem achieving my hop fix with this bad boy..."
"O - One of the best IPAs around. I'm actually excited when I see it on the draft list. That said, it is a huge under-performer in the bottle. I've never had a bottled Racer 5 that can come close to comparing to having it on tap."
"This is a fantastically drinkable IPA--not something that makes me go ""wow," but good enough that I'd want to go for another once I'm finished and good enough to make me wish it were cheaper here."
"A solid IPA, another great West Coast/California brew. And coming from wine country,no less. Would have again, when I see it. Hope to acquire some of their other brews as well."
"Bear Republic is on par with any other brewery in Cali (in my opinion)."
"Overall I was very let down by this beer, I had high expectations and there are some good things going for this brew but the cheesy/cheddar thing ruined it. I bought a bomber and couldn't finish it."
"D-Ridiculously approachable and a good ""starter"" IPA.Definition of sessionable."
"The CPJ"
"Highly drinkable beer. Smooth, tasty and refreshing. After one i'm already beginning to feel a buzz from the 7% abv. Overall, this is a very solid hop forward IPA."
"Highly recommended and a must-try for every hop-head."
"Would choose another west coast IPA next time around."
"GRADE: B/B+"
"Honored to review one of my favorite IPAs. I've had several Racer 5s from tap as well as numerous bottles and bombers usually into a pint glass. Pours slightly hazy amber with off white one finger head. Nose of citrus and piney hops with a hint of malt. Flavor is incredible- hits harsh and bitter but subsides into an incredibly smooth aftertaste. Nice citrus (grapefruit) and pine elements. Palate is great- despite its ""pale ale"" status, it is actually quite rich and by no means watery or thin. Lots of alpha acids and great palate make this a definite winner any day!"
"Overall, a solid West Coast IPA. Obviously there are many better choices from that area but this is quite nice."
"Overall i love this beer and it's one I try to pick up every once in a while. Might pick up a keg to have on tap since I see it around alot."
"drinkability - this is a solid ipa, a bit weak on the hop side of things for a west coast ipa however, that being said, it showcases the complexity of the many hop varieties used"
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable, a touch dry on the finish though."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Bottled on 11/29/10. Pours a cloudy amber orange with minimal foam, carbonation, and lacing. Lovely nose. Mango, pineapple, bright lively hops and a slight hint of malty sweetness underlying it all. Medium to full body. Low carbonation. Palate doesn't lean as hard towards the hoppy side as my favorite IPAs but still quite resiny and piny. The hops are balanced relatively equally for the style with a roasted malt flavor but fresh hop taste wins out to dominate the finish. Good drinkability but the malt profile definitely detracts from this a bit."
"A very soild American IPA that I would have again."
"D: A very enjoyable IPA. Nothing puts it over the top but its also reasonably priced, especially for a 7% IPA."
"D - Good California IPA. Very dry and easy to drink. Certainly a beer that merits a regular spot in the rotation."
"Drinkability - this is one drinkable IPA. Very delicious, and I would not have a problem having a few of these in one sitting. I can't wait to pick some up the next time I go for a beer haul."
"This is a very tasty IPA that is very well thought out and brewed. One of my favorites at this point."
"This beer is an awesome IPA and lives up to the bill of one of the best IPA's that is readily available on the market. Happy to have it tonight."
"This brew pours a semi see through golden hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head and some sporadic clingy lacing,i really like this aroma of pineapple,mango,orange zest,caramel and piney hops rather enticing,the mouthfeel is between light and medium and nicely carbonated and the first flavours that hit me is pineapple,paw paw and some lychee very tropical indeed and thats nicely interrupted mid taste by a light toffee sensation that prepares you for the dry piney hop bitter finish and the ABV is nowhere to be seen,overall its a tasty drop that with a few corrections could be super tasty i mean ive love to see abit more head and lacing and a fuller body but other than that very easy to knock back."
"It has a mellow taste of evergreen and flowers. Not malty, but there is enough body to this beer to make it pretty filling."
"I'm not sure if this was the freshest bottle, so I will seek it out again and I'll make sure it's fresh. Everything about this beer was right on, it's just everything was subtle and not in your face, which is how I like my IPAs."
"(You might wonder why this translates to an ""A-"" rating with what I say. I just like IPA's, and a flawed IPA is still a damn good beer)"
"Mouth is a little off for me the dryness with the malt backbone coming through leave a slighlty weird feeling, other than that its a fairly drinkable beer"
"D: A really well-balanced and drinkable, delicious IPA; kudos again Bear Republic"
"Drinks easier than most IPAs. It has a mild carbonation and is very refreshing. Went well with a nice cut of sirloin."
"D - Drinkability is where this beer really shines. The lightness and crispness of this beer, combined with the citrus hop bite that isn't overdone makes this beer enjoyable without being tiring. This would definitely be a good session beer, although the 7% ABV might make it a shorter session."
"Very drinkable- either with dinner or for the whole evening"
"(D)- Definitely a great IPA. Has everything you would expect. Good stuff."
"D: High - have had this one before but finally decided to grab a single to add it to my reviews. Great offering."
"Lovely creamy med-high carbonation, could be lowered a little."
"Pours out a hazy gold color with a thick head, which is retained throughout and provides a nice heavy lacing. Hmm, no freshness date to be found and I took a chance on this one at $10 a six pack, and was in a cooler which perhaps has contributed to the freshness and hoppiness. Nothing worse than opening an IPA or APA and getting that stale smell, you know what I mean. Brewers, PLEASE, date code your beers, from a consumers standpoint it just isn't right not to. Anyway, fortunately smell greeted me with a big citrus hop twang, nice grapefruit and pine in there and some alcohol in the nose. Taste has nice malt backbone to help balance out some of the hops, overall a nice interplay between the two flavors and I can see how this is an APA as opposed to an IPA. A good residual blast of resinous piney hop aftertaste reminds me I'm drinking a west coast ale. Mouthfeel is rich and quite smooth and this beer is very drinkable for such a high ABV, big pale ale. Overall this beer was a pleasant surprise and was a great drink to go with my hickory BBQ chicken on a cold midwestern night."
"Very good IPA. Big Citrus which I love."
"Drinkability- extremely smooth and pleasant. very well balanced."
"M: Good carbonation, as said before heavy on the sediments."
"Drinkability- the balancing act of this beer makes it so drinkable."
"d. overall really really tasty ipa. bear republic knows what to do when it comes to hoppy brews. check out hop rod rye if your a fan of this, that beer is incredible. but, that this is a review for racer 5, this beer is quite incredible as well. there's a reason for the hype."
"This is an IPA that competes with Doubles/Imperials. Huge hops and very fruity."
"One of my favorite West Coast IPAs."
"Big fan of Bear Republic. Hop Rod is an outstanding beer. Even though I got, what I think was, a bad bottle...would seek out again based on other beers I've had from BR and reputation alone."
"Pours a light clear amber with minimal head. Nose is mostly grapefruit, big citrus aromas. Taste is floral on the sip, smell transfers to the taste with a big citrus bomb flavour which leaves a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is a bit dry, medium bodied. Drinks really well, I was expecting alot more from the appearance; kinda let down by a weak head/pour. Gonna retry the second bottle I bought with a more aggressive pour. Otherwise this is a great tasting citrus flavoured forward IPA."
"Overall, a solid IPA, that is a great benchmark for the style. It is a well established favorite and is recommended.I've had both in the bottle and draft, and draft, when fresh seems better imho."
"D- very nice IPA, definitely one of my top 5 in that category. I've had it several times, I think this bottle may have been a touch too old as it wasn't quite as fresh and vibrant as some of the others. can't read the code on the bottle though."
"D- I would think that you could drink this IPA and be happy."
"D: Great drinkability. Tons of balance. Not incredibly hoppy, but just enough to drink lots of."
"Well blended flavor of citrusy hops and malt make this brew highly drinkable."
"Drinkability - This beer has the wow factor. Great IPA with great hoppy flavor with a nice balance for sweet maltiness. Not a record breaker but an overall west coast IPA."
"D: I want to drink this all day long."
"A solid West coast IPA. Nothing outstanding to distinguish it from others such as Stone, but nothing bad about it either."
"D: I had this shortly after Heady Topper. While HT is a DIPA and this is an IPA, I was surprised by how well this one held up. It's a neat reminder of how good some off-the-shelf beers can be next to their limited-release counterparts."
"A really well crafted IPA, very smooth and inviting. Definately one of my favorite IPAs now."
"One small thing to mention, this beer was strongly recommended to me and I held of because I thought the labeling looked cheap and generic. I wish I wouldn't have waited."
"D: High. To be drunk in gallons (preferentially, sitting in a pub around the San Francisco bay area :p)"
"Pours out light amber in color. There was not a lot of head upon pouring, perhaps a bit old? Smells of flowery hops. This beer is so delicious. Not too high in Alcohol, the sweet malt and bitter hops are in perfect balance. Racer 5 is one of the easiest drinking IPA's I have had!"
"Wish I hadn't waited so long to try this IPA -- really nicely done!"
"Don't know much about Bear Republic, but let's say I'll definitely be coming back to this company. Next, I want to try their Nor Cal."
"Had this for the first time at a Goose Island tasting event. Poured into standard pint glass. It has a robust, billowing creamy head that lingers. Has a straw gold color with moderate clarity. The hops are very present in the smell. Wow, the flavor is perfect; Pretty well-balanced with the hops being a bit more present than the malt. The malt hits first and is a bit sweet and syrupy. This gives way to the bitter hops and finishes with a lasting biting flavor. Moderate carbonation. I could have a number of these. The quintessential IPA."
"Racer 5 pours an ever so slightly hazy light copper with a nice white head that leaves beautiful lacing. The aroma is sweet, almost melon-like malt, and tons of orange and grapefruit hops. Tons of hops squeeze into the flavor, citrusy and herbal. Nice light malt sweetness is well balanced by the bitterness. Overall this is a delicious IPA, I feel like they crammed the flavor of a DIPA into an IPA."
"D: Very drinkable; one of my favorite IPAs."
"medium-bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation... great drinkability. i could easily session this beer. not to be confused with a session beer..."
"Medium bodied mouthfeel. For a beer topping out at 7.0%, Racer 5 is ridiculously drinkable. In my opinion, this one of the best IPAs available at the moment. It never fails to deliver."
"Overall: this is one of the better American IPA's that is readily available. The malt profile is what makes this one stand out for me. I like the interplay between the sour hops and the malt. It is simple but it works."
"A good solid IPA. It isn't blowing my mind, but there's lots of nice West Coast hop character and a good balance struck for nice easy drinking."
"I am disappointed that I only have five left in the six pack. I would love to give it a 5.0 rating for drinkability but I do not believe I can truly justify it yet."
"This is an IPA at its best. There are many that could be describe this way but I think this one does a few things exceptionally. First, the carbonation is just wonderful. Second, while having a wonderful hop forward attack the malt shines wonderfully in the back. Finally, the mouth feel here is beyond exceptional. Cannot recommend this beer more and the price as I recall was extremely reasonable."
"Drink- Why didn't I have this before. Very nice beer. Could easily session this."
"D- a very drinkable IPA. Not as much ""pop"" as a lot of other West Coast IPA's."
"This is made exactly like a west coast IPA should be, but unfortunately it just doesn't quite compete with the big dogs. Although, for the price, and style-wise, I haven't found anything that matches it."
"D - A very good high production west coast IPA. Definite a go to beer if it were available here in the 50th state."
"Very good IPA, just wish I knew how fresh this was. Seems to be within a reasonable timeframe for freshness but who knows?"
"D- Great beer, definitely would love to drink again! Very different from other IPA'S.."
"i just want to keep sipping and sipping, great drinability. and 5$ a bomber makes this very sessionable. one of the best IPAs going...go get yourself some!"
"D-Very drinkable ipa."
"I did this review in about 15 minutes, versus the normal hour or so it takes me to review. I think that's a testament to how straightforward, clean and delicious Racer 5 is."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of off white head. The color is amber/orange and hazy. The aroma is full of citrus. The caramel malt comes through as well. The taste begins with the citrus flavors. The malt comes through in the middle and I am left with a mild pine bitterness. This is a well balanced beer. I really enjoyed this beer. I will look for it again."
"Pours an orange amber haze witha thin white foam head. Has an aroma of grapefruit with a subtle hint of cinnamon. Has a resinous taste with more malt than usual for its style. Gives it a different aftertaste. The malt lingers. Plenty of sweet on the front end. Good IPA, more of a DIPA feel. Definitely worth a try."
"Mouth is pretty much perfect, and I could drink this one all day. Easily A top 5 American IPA, in the same league with Sculpin, 2 Hearted, and other highly heralded IPAs."
"Pours nice golden hue, with a small white head. Aroma of floral hops, some citrus, and grapefruit notes. Taste is floral hops, citrus, slight sweet notes of caramel and malt. Palate is nice medium body, smooth crisp mouth feel, nice carbonation. Finish is floral hops some citrus, spices some malt and good amount of bitterness towards the end but well balanced by slight malty presence, hop presence dominate. Overall a very nice, smooth and drinkable IPA. Very enjoyable"
"Clear, light copper with a pillowy white head that leaves sticky sheets of lace on the glass. Candied grapefruit, pine sap and sugar cookie in the nose, this beer smells really good. Racer 5 has what I really like in an IPA, tons of fruity hop flavor and a subtle but strong malty backbone. I am not sure of the hop bill but I think it must contain Centennial, Cascade and other C-hops it is magnificent. Medium bodied and hop oily with soft carbonation. Racer 5 is a nearly perfect IPA for my tastes. World Class."
"D - All night long baby. Light enough to ""keep em coming"" and heavy enough to know you're drinking a real beer. If you are an Odell IPA or Two Hearted fan I feel this is right up that heavenly alley."
"M/D: Great mouthfeel, very smooth and clean. Good carbination, refreshing! I rather enjoyed this beer."
"D/O- What an awesome IPA! Would have no qualms with putting down a few of these given the opportunity. Racer 5...you my only friend."
"Notes: An amazingly good beer that lives up to its hype. A balanced hop bomb that is quite drinkable with perfect mouthfeel."
"Nice creamy one finger head. Pale golden in color. Smells heavily of American hops, some sweetness. Tastes of creamy sweetness, piney citrus bitterness and finishes balanced and clean. No lingering bitterness. Medium carbing, medium body. Quite drinkable with the creamy hop malt balance. Nice job Bear."
"D: While 7.0% ABV isn't terribly high, there's no traces of alcohol here. Extremely drinkable and very enjoyable. Great example of a West Coast IPA."
"Considering that this is locally made (for me) and it is so delicious certainly explains why I continuously opt to put 15-gal kegs in my kegerator! Cheers!"
"Only 'weakness' if you want to call it that, is a slight lack of nose. Otherwise, The Poster Child for West Coast IPAs."
"Overall, this is a hop head's dream. If you like hops punching you in the mouth like I do, go for this guy. Definitely worth picking up. Cheers!"
"I had this beer on tap at a bar in San Francisco. It was in a pint glass and poured to be a copper color. It smelled of citrus and pine. This beer was very crisp, hoppy, and flavorful. It was medium-bodied. Medium carbonation with this beer and good drinkability."
"Summation: I like. I like alot. I am still learning IPA's so I guess I expect the good ones to be very similar, then something comes along and surprises me. This IPA seems simple (in a good way) but actually there is more there than meets the eye (or palate). The character changed over a 20 minute period, maintaining the original presence but getting more complex at the same time. Nice. I give this a very solid 9. YUMMEE."
"D: A big IPA for sure, and I could do a few of these in a night. I saw some sixers of this, I may pick one up to take home for Thanksgiving break in my craft brew deprived hometown."
"D: Leaves you craving more. Just as you start to grasp everything about the flavor its time to swallow. I have had this beer many times, I love it, it loves me and I will definitely drink it again and again."
"A class IPA. Great look; head retention was fantastic, sexy lace. A nice mixed nose of grass, pine, hints of tropical fruits and nicely integrated malt notes. Solid bitterness and a full, well balanced mouth feel. Aftertaste is long, persistent and pleasant. Overall a really sexy beer that has balance and flavour in spades. A good benchmark."
"D- Overall, a decent IPA. I wouldn't likely have again."
"I have had the chance to drink this beer on a number of occasions, and it always pleases. Really a great beer after it warms down a bit. Great citrusy hops. Holds the glass great, and delivers a great, dark amber color and a really fresh aroma."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: A bit under medium bodied with good carbonation combines for a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, one hell of an IPA. Every time I have this I'm impressed. This beer possesses all of the qualities that I'm looking for from this style."
"D- very drinkable, dry finish makes you want to have another sip. long lasting bitterness too."
"Medium body... true to category."
"This beer pours a nice darkish, murky yellow and has a very nice rocky white head. Its smells of the typical piney, fruit hops with little noticable sweetness. Taste is excellent with hops up front and a touch of malt in the background. The mouthfeel is medium body with a nice creaminess to it. Very drinkable and the ABV is at a good point. This beer is delicious and extremely well balanced. I am glad that it comes in bombers and 6 packs!"
"Drinkability: Very hoppy, but drinkable. Enough variance in the flavor experience to keep me interested and coming back for more."
"Racer 5 India Pale Ale has a slightly-cloudy, light-orange colour and a good head and lacing. The smell is quite strong and is mostly of citrussy hops. Some malt is noticable to begin with followed by bitter hops and a delicious citrussy tang. This is a really good IPA."
"D-The beer is approachable for a new beer drinker but still retains enough characteristic hop aroma and flavor to be unique. It is a solid example of what an American style IPA should be."
"Great Drinking ipa. flavors are well balanced. I especially enjoyed the lingering mild sweet orange peel notes & hops that linger after the finish. A definite keeper!"
"would be one of my go to beers."
"All in all, it's a pretty good beer though. I'd definitely pick it up again if I wanted a solid IPA that goes down smooth and isn't overly bitter. I liked it alot and I'd recommend it to any IPA fan. It's worth a try, pick it up if you see it."
"D: I could session these, but I would have to take the time to strain it. Ugh."
"Drinkability - Relatively so. Drank this quite easily. Yes, as I always freaking say, I would chose many other IPA's out there rather than this, but hey, not bad on tap and would get again if there was nothing better to drink."
"I didn't find this IPA as nice as the other Bear republic brews.. but still an excellent brew. Deep copper color with ample froth which lightly laced the glass. Nose is hoppy with pine really standing out. A gentle bitterness which is nice and the way I personally like IPA's to be. Good to the finish with consistent flavor throughout."
"By far my favorite IPA. Could drink these forever and not grow tired of it. Alcohol is VERY well masked at 7%. If you can pick some up, I highly recommend doing so."
"I am going to have to chain myself down after this to stop myself grabbing another. It's that delicious."
"I really enjoy this as a change up to the normal Dogfish Head 60 min, Smuttynose, and Victory Hop Devil that are readily available in my area."
"-solid go to IPA in my area. better than lagunitas, obviously not as good as russian river, but i always enjoy it"
"A light bodied beer with good carbonation. Very drinkable, and affordable as a session beer. Pretty widely available here in the Bay Area."
"Got this on a Wisconsin beer run. Pours with a nice big head that stuck around for quite a while. The flavor is mostly hops with a light bready malt that barely fought its way through - you get more malt as this warms which I think improves the flavor. The hop here are mostly bitter with a very little sweet charatcer that helps to round it out. I thought this was a very good beer but I don't know if I'd make it a regular. There are just too many others that I prefer to it."
"Wow this is a very good IPA! The color is a nice amber with a nice head which quickly diminishes leaving a beatiful lacing around the glass. The smell is awesome not over powered by hops as some others do. The taste is exceptional one of the best IPA's I've had. I wish I had another one however sadly I don't. This beer is truely worth getting."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet. Pours an orange amber with a decent head, nice lacing. Fruity, hoppy aroma, lots of great piney and grapefruit smells going on here. Really solid beer from start to finish, probably much better fresh on the West Coast, but a really nice beer overall."
"D - One o the easiest IPAs I've ever drank. Exceptional."
"Pours a light amber brew with a nice brownish crown. Sweetish malts and hoppy aromas. Nice body with great drinkability. A little dry in the aftertaste but nice brew overall."
"Drinkability -- This is certainly a solid IPA, but there are plenty others I would gladly take over this. Perhaps when I come back to this one it will excite me like it has so many other reviewers. Time will tell..."
"A refreshing and pleasant IPA. It has a good citrus and hops balance. This would go great on a warm day."
"Nice golden pour yields a thick head. A nice array of hop aromas, grapefruit, lemon zest, as well as some floral and pine notes. Very fresh tasting, lots of hops upfront with a decent malt balance - the hops are the standout though, just how I like my IPAs. There is a slightly bitter and dry finish, but remains quite refreshing and drinkable. Solid offering from Bear Republic."
"I won't be buying this one again. There are to many other IPA's out there I prefer to this one. It was worth a try, but that's it."
"D: It's goes down rather easy."
"MF- Good body and carbonation level."
"Medium body, thick for the style, slightly slick, with moderate carbonation. Sweet bitterness hits the tongue, reminiscent of orange peel and grapefruit, with pine notes. Long, dry, bitter finish is pleasing. Refreshing and balanced, very enjoyable. This will become a staple in my fridge."
"Drinkability: Just the right ABV, hoppy enough to please, dry and refreshing. Very very good in the drinkability department. I only wish we could get it locally."
"This was a nice beer to have from a tap on a hot afternoon, with an alcohol level that is sessionable. It ranks up there with the better tasting IPAs."
"This one of the great IPA's it's bottle conditioned hoppy nectar."
"D - one of the better and more consistent IPA's on the market. A welcomed tap option at many places that don't have the best beer selections."
"M="
"D - Yep! I enjoy this thing and expect more soon!"
"D - Very drinkable. Perhaps this bottle is a little old. That could explain the mellowness of the hops. Of course, having been drinking mostly imperial IPA's lately my palate could be off. No matter, this is a very good beer."
"I regret I'd skipped over this so many times. I'd had several Bear Republic beers in my decades in N Cal and now, after moving away I finally tried Racer."
"As for drinkability, it is highly reccommended, but I would at least try it on tap first. Like previous comment(s), I wish it had a date on it as to when it was bottled. Perhaps it might have been affected by the long ride east."
"MF/D: smooth to start with an increase in carbonation that fizzles on the tongue well after the swallow."
"This is a very light beer. A light sweetness accompanies the grapefruity hops. There isn't much else to it, which makes it rather dry. I might have got an old beer (maybe they should put a date on the bottle). There was bit of a stale, sour taste and the alcohol was rather strong when I breathed out from my nose. The hops never cleared themselves, obscuring the subtleties with every drink."
"High carbonation, dry, with a long bitter finish. I like hoppy bitter beers, but not bitterness which lacks complexity. I also don't like for a beer to be astringent. Not something I would seek out again."
"A smooth golden color with a nice fluffy white 2 finger head. The smell was overwhelming with hops and I was unable to detect anything else. My wife commented from across the table that my beer smelled like flowers. The taste was just like the smell, an overkill of hops and and bitter citrus bite on the back end. Carbonation was average and it went down okay. It was an okay drink but not something I would purchase again."
"I am not a huge IPA fan, but this one does the trick especially at this price."
"Please do not support this companies."
"Drinkabilty - I took a chance on this since hop rod is soooo good, i grabbed a 6- pack of this and man im happy. This is right up there wwith all my favorite ipa's. Will drink again"
"Poured into a Stone pint glass, Deep gold color, some sediment floating around. Hop aroma is instant, and from 2 feet away, packs a punch. A slight ring around the glass as the foamy head gives way.Taste starts out with a bitterness that blends into a smooth malty body and eventually turns into that hoppy, grapefruit, piney finish that you expect from an IPA. It's not one of The big boys, But this is a very good IPA."
"Awesome IPA. Dont sleep on this beer, especially since youre probably wasting money on something far less tasty."
"Awesome. One of the finest examples of West Coast IPA I have had. Enjoyed many bottles before this review. Pours a golden amber, lighter than typical. Nose is unreal---fresh juicy hops and tropical fruit. Taste follows suit. It's just flat out delicious. Word to use here is ""balance"". Perfect harmony of malt, hops and grain. This and Stone are my go to IPA's. A must try."
"I could drink this all night long."
"I feel like I should have enjoyed this one much more than I did - no doubt, it's a good beer. Really solid in its merits. But it's not one that I'll crave, as it doesn't seem distinctive enough to earn the right."
"On a hot night this is a nice thing to drink. Very piney aroma; leathery smell with a very sharp edge. There's even the smell you get when you pull a strip of scotch tape from the roll-- something you will remember from your grammar-school days, I'm sure. Very tight flavor, full of little pins from the abundant carbonation. It starts out resinous and loaded with pine needles, but mellows into a peachy taste when it warms up. I couldn't drink such a thing in the winter but it's welcome in August."
"Mouthfeel is more partial to being more medium-bodied, with the carbonation at a moderately light level. Drinkability is decently high -Â quite flavorful and easy drinking. Admirable example of a Cali IPA; worthy of your buy."
"Pours a somewhat hazy orangish amber brown IPA color. Some small sediment floating around. The head was a little thin on the first one, even with an agressive pour. The rest of the six pack was a little thicker. Average lacing for an IPA. It has a really good fresh hoppy herbal/floral grapefruit smell. Nice. Taste starts out with a hard bitterness that blends into a biscuity malty body and eventually turns into that hoppy grapefruit piney herbal flavor that you expect from an IPA. This reminded me of Stone's IPA with that little hint of burnt rubber on the back of my tounge. All in all this is another example of the greatness that is very hoppy west coast beer. Not the best, but close enough."
"Cheers..."
"This is a perfectly balanced, and superbly drinkable IPA."
"Smooth carbonation makes this hop juice ultra quaffable for it's respectable 7% abv. When this stuff is fresh it is one of the best everyday IPAs around."
"D: Great warm weather beer; easy to finish several at a single sitting. Overall, a very enjoyable beer that I would be happy to share with friends."
"D: Extremely. A perfect beer to go with either eating, smoking, or more beer."
" This beer is about as drinkable as it gets love to drink this alongside GreenFlash,FlowerPower, 2-Hearted & Columbus Brewing IPA(Latter is Hardest one for me to get!) GREATLY CRAFTED BREW!"
"Bear Republic Brewing Company--Racer 5 India Pale Ale--2008 12 oz. Plastic Stick On Label Bottle. 7.00% ABV. 69 IBU's. (4.5 / 5.0) Thin light lace white head. Clear thin bright light gold color. Crisp rich floral hop front. Tasty dry sweet crisp grapefruit citrus grassy pine pale malt light caramel body. Tangy clean crisp rich bitter hop spice mild citrus end. Hop Infused Floral tasty IPA. Sampled 10/30/2008. 6-Pack $10.99."
"Drinks: like a happy accident. I have to admit, I came here looking for Racer X and found 5. But I'm glad I gave it a try. An all-around solid IPA."
"OVERALL: A very good IPA. This is probably one of my favorite in the style, and if it were local to me, I'd probably drink it all the time. Bold flavors with a great look and feel, really only the aromas need to be brought up a notch. Regardless, this is a very good example of the style and worth checking out if you get the chance. I'll get a couple more if I see them on next year's trip south of the border."
"D: Amazing for an IPA. One of the best go-to beers out there."
"D. This is my first Bear Republic beer and I am not disappointed. Maybe not an upper tier IPA but a damn good one nonetheless with excellent drinkability. One bomber could easily lead to two with this stuff."
"The mouthfeel really paves the way for an excellent drinkability. Multiples can be had in one sitting."
"D - Pretty impressive for an IPA, especially at 7%. Couldn't drink this all night like Columbus, then again there's nothing like Columbus IPA. This came from my first six pack of Racer 5. Definitely one i'll purchase again."
"A well rounded IPA done to perfection no groundbreaking work here, but no room for disappointment."
"D - dont think i've ever realized what a great beer this is. west coast hoppy goodness all the way. this will be making more appearances in my fridge very soon."
"But it's ok, just give it a little time to warm up and watch as the flavors emerge."
"Drinkability is good, but one 22 is enough with this amount of hops, malt, and alcohol."
"reasonably drinkable at 7% - I'll finish up the bomber no problem."
"Always a joy to drink, this beer. An underappreciated west coast IPA that's up there with Pliny when fresh."
"DB- I have had this one several times before but I have never really sat down with it until now. This beer is in every store for a reason, it is a truly iconic IPA. One that will probably outlast 99% of the style during the inevitable test of time. This one joins the ranks of Weihenstephaner and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale in the true staples of beer."
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, and has an above average amount of carbonation. This is a fairly drinkable beer, something that goes down pretty easy, but not overly sessionable. Over all, a great beer, something I will go back to again."
"Body was beautiful & light/crisp. Well, carbonated. This beer is just full enough to balance out the hops. A really nice IPA."
"Found this for $1.99 a single. Nice all around, but nothing to special. Grapefruit notes, some alcohol warmth, but easy enough to consume. Less malt balance than some other seven percent IPAs. However, nothing blew me away but would try more from Bear Republic."
"Clear caramel, copper pour with quickly fading head and great lacing. Big West Coast piney, citrus nose with a nice caramel malt background. The taste is perfectly balanced with the sweet bready malts complementing the bitterness of the hops. Tangerines dominate the citrus side. The finish is crisp and dry with with a slightly resiny, chewy mouthfeel. The balance makes this extremely drinkable. A great beer from a great brewery!"
"Racer 5 (should it be called Racer V?) appears a very clear yellow hue with many particulates meandering about the vessel. The scents are floral and hops, with just a hint of citrus. The taste is quite good, though not in the uppermost echelon of American IPAs / DIPAs. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. There is a nice, sticky hop feel, especially noticeable in the aftertaste. I'd happily drink this again."
"The mouthfeel is on a little below medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is very good, it had some great hoppy flavors to it and went down very smoothly. Excellent beer overall, and one of my personal favorites."
"D - Very good IPA, doesn't kill your palate, you could go through a few of these easy in one sitting."
"D: I had a 22oz and it was plenty for one sitting, I think 1 22oz or 2 12oz would be my limit, the alcohol really comes through you can feel it before you're half way done."
"overall-being one of the easier to find IPAs around here, I wouldn't hesitate to pick this one up again."
"This is a very drinkable and pleasant beer, though I do wish there was a slight stronger emphasize on the hops, as I could easily mistake this for an American Pale Ale."
"Overall a nice IPA. Good hop presence, dry finish."
"D-One of my go-to brews. Love the taste. Not too much booze. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Well rounded. Could drink alot of this. Solid craft brewery in Bear Republic, who make a fine array of hoppy beers."
"Good medium body, and well balanced make this one of the most drinkable IPAs out there."
"All I can tell you to do is get a beautiful cask pour. Just get it! GO. BYE."
"If you like IPA's and hoppy beers, this one is worth finding."
"Racer 5 on cask was delicious with abundant pineapple, peach and mango flavors, with assertive bitterness and a sweet cracker-like malt background."
"D- This IPA is very good and very drinkable. Great amount of carbonation. I can see drinking this beer on a hot summer day, or on a cool fall day. Very good example of a west coast IPA. I will seek this on out again! For sure!"
"Mouthfeel is light to medium light. Carb is perfect and finish is clean with lingering hops. Excellent body and feel. Drinkability is really nice too, this was a great beer to enjoy with lunch. When it's fresh on tap, this is just about as nice a widely available IPA as the world has seen."
"Drinkability: A very good IPA. Not quite the best, but this is a beer that's definitely worth a try and is one I would be more than happy to drink again."
"A surprisingly nice IPA. I wasn't expecting much given the high volume production, however, the West Coast Hops shine, as usual. Nice balance of sweet maltiness (but not too sweet which is a problem with alot of IPAs) twinned with hoppy bitterness; its a very drinkable IPA. Superior to a number of higher rated IPAs out there."
"For being what appears to be a very mass produced IPA this gem is delicious. I cannot really say that this is very unique but I love it regardless. It pours a golden semi carbonated color and has a very piny smell to it. Taste is the same as the smell but the alcohol is definitely hidden. Regardless this is a great intro beer."
"D - this isn't going to be a hophead's delight, still, this is an interesting West Coast take on an IPA. great balance, attractive combination of hops and malts and at $5 for a 22oz bomber, it's not going to break the bank. Racer 5 may become a new standby on my list!"
"This is a great West Coast IPA. Might be the only IPA I like more than Union Jack, which is why I had a few pints. Very happy this is available at my bottle shop. Will buy this often."
"Drinkability: I could have a couple of these. A decent IPA that is very true to style."
"Overall I am just not a huge fan of this west coast style of IPA that has very little malt profile. This is a very good beer but I prefer a little more complexity in my IPA."
"Drinkability is great! As I had this on tap and had a few more!"
"D: Very drinkable beer, very enjoyable. I didn't dig earthiness on the palate but it didn't get into the way too much, there's plenty of other hop flavor there to satisfy."
"D: A very good overall beer, blending all aromas, tastes and sweet hop, lingering sensations, this is an all around beer. Nice to have a bomber of this stuff, and at a good price, not bad."
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Pours golden with a one finger white head. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of malt and hops. The flavor is of malt and a slightly sour hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was very nice and easy drinking. The hop profile and intensity was very nice and the malt counterbalanced it almost perfectly. If this brew had some more complexity to it, it could be a world-class brew, but it is still VERY nice to say the least. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall - Set's itself apart from many IPAs that I've had. The combination of smell and taste are the 2 attributes that distinguish this brew. This is a must have if you're an IPA fan."
"D - Drink it, enjoy it, and drink another!"
"pours a copper orange color with average off white frothy head that recedes at a moderate rate. average lacing and lively carbonation. strong fruity citrus smell. taste is similar with some piney floral hints. lifgt body and a thin slick texture. long flavor duration. goes down very smooth and is very easy to drink. excellent brew."
"Pours a slightly amber yellow with a resiny white head that leaves nice lace on the sides of my pint glass. The aroma is lovely, and the fact that I could smell it right after popping the cap is always a good sign. It is quite perfume like with plenty of citrus, both lemon and ruby red grapefruit, a hint of pine and some nice flowery aromas. I also detect a hint of earthiness and pale malt sweetness. The flavor is bursting with hops. Lemon, grapefruit, pine and floral flavors mix with the sweet slightly caramel malt character and a bit of earthiness. This beer is quite bitter, but seems to have just enough sweetness to keep it from getting out of control. Not as balanced as a east coast or Midwest IPA mind you, but I am not one to be overly concerned about that, especially with a hop flavor and aroma as great as that possessed by racer 5. The body is medium with a good amount of carbonation, yet a fairly smooth texture. The finish is very dry with a lingering hoppy flavor on my tongue. A very drinkable IPA, and one of my go-to favorites. I am surprised it took me this long to get around to reviewing it."
"Poured a golden orange with yellow highlights that had a nice finger of head and left good sticky lacing on the glass. The aromas given off from the beer were quite enjoyable with the hops dominating the nose but had a good sweet malt presence and hints of citrus grapefruit and slight caramel notes. As far as the taste the piney hop were a little bit more punchier but still maintained a decent balance between the sweet malts. The citrus grapefruit also helped out some to enhance the bitter flavors on the palate and I could also detect a caramel undertone. The beer was medium body with a fair amount of carbonation for an IPA and had a slight sweet but sticky bitter finish. Overall the beer was good across the board and drank exceptionally well without a huge alcohol punch considering the ABV."
"D : Very. Very. Drinkable IPA. So well balanced and delicious. At 7% you should take your time with it, but that's a challenge."
"Most drinkable 7% beer I've tried. It's a sessionable big ipa."
"D - Not my preference of flavor dynamic; I favor less malt, more dynamic hops. That said, it is definitely a good brew."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours a crystal clear golden color with a nice dense head and moderate carbonation. Strong caramel aromas dance very elegantly with the bright citrusy hops. After a nice palate saturation I get waves of caramel, toffee, and brown sugar with some spicy/citrus hop flavor. Mouthfeel feels nice, full, and creamy with a mellow hop bitterness. Love the taste and aroma on this one, more please."
"My favorite american IPA's include stone IPA, Great Divide Titan, Avery IPA and Racer 5. Though after having yesterday at Lord Hobo on tap and today in a bottle, I have to say, it doesn't compete with the aforementioned others anymore. Great Divide, Stone and Avery are very close to each other, and from now on, I will buy whichever is the cheapest out of the 3. Racer 5 lacks the complexity and mouthfeel it used to have. I have even travelled to the brewery itself 2x, and although it is still a very good beer, I can no longer call it great."
"I've noticed that the more recent reviews have been below the average. Perhaps Bear Republic's quality control has decreased. This is the reverse trend of Weyerbacher's beers. Their controls have improved and their recent reviews tend to exceed the average. I wish I had had this one when it was getting more As. I heard so much about it and was a bit disappointed."
"For the price that I paid for this brew, there is no doubt in my mind. Buy it! Now! It is delicious, affordable, and comes in a great size. I will definitely be purchasing this beer again, if not for its solid offering to the IPA style than for its price tag."
"Fruity notes lead off, melon or cantaloupe again, some resinous bitter hops in the middle giving it a dry grassiness in the finish. The fruit lingers behind it, which is a nice combination. Medium bodied, almost slippery, not too heavy or sweet. Easy to have another if so inclined. Today I just have a single for the purpose of this review. Will drink again many times hopefully..."
"D - Very easy drinker. I will get this again and recommend it"
"Overall decent value but will probably not buy again just because I'd appreciate a little less malt."
"I know that since it is 7% abv it probably shouldn't be a session, but this is one of my favorite IPA's to drink in numbers if I'm at a pub or bar. Highly recommended for hop-heads."
"D: That English BA user that always yells at people for referring to beers over 4% ABV as session ales is going to be pissed in 3...2...1: This is the closest I've ever found to a sessionable beer at 7% ABV. It is easy drinking and very flavorful."
"Mouthfeel is full and satisfying and it's drinkability has been tested and proven outstanding many MANY times."
"Pours a hazy drk gold with a modest head. Aroma is HOPS and citrus, standard West Coast IPA/DIPA. Taste is the same, this beer is all hops, just a hint of light bready malt underneath. Nothing complex here, if you like hop bombs, this is yet one more beer that'll do the job for you. Occasionally I enjoy that and on those occasions, I'd buy another."
"Drinkability - Pretty good beer in general, maybe a little too IPA for me though. But a worthy beer nonetheless."
"Stupidly drinkable. This is my 5th case of the stuff. Until Russian River starts selling Pliny by the case, this WILL be my go-to session beer until the weather starts to cool off and I start looking for browns, porters, and stouts."
"My server, to be named later, brought this to me with a finger of bone-white head with good retention, Color was a deep-gold with NE-quality clarity. Nose was redolent with pine-y hops. Mouthfeel was medium with a palate-cleansing hoppiness. Don't hold back! Finish was gaspingly bone-dry. More, please, Raquel!"
"Pours a very clear, golden orange color. A sticky, ivory colored head tops this brew. All the carbonation bubbles look like they're having a party. A great and inviting appearance. Aromas of strong, delicious hops. Pine. Hop oils. Citrus. The taste is sweet with intense hops. Intense in an awesome way. The head was thick and creamy and laced amazingly through the 22oz. Great balanced between the hops and sweet malt. A good bitterness lingers. I very muched enjoyed this brew. Will look to pick up another."
"The feel of this brew is kind of dry and coarse upfront, but the citrusy finish leaves the palate wet."
"D - Goes down alright, but I've had more drinkable IPA's."
"Very good IPA; not quite up there for me as the best West Coast IPA (or best offering from BR) but still a solid go-to option for a citric hop blast."
"Poured into a lovely tulip glass. Nice orange gold color to this beer. Pure white head, not the tightest of bubbles but nice. Lacing sticks to the glass a good bit. Pretty beer in the glass. Very citrus aroma forward ipa, great west coast hop aroma right on the nose. Very balanced malt to hop profile. Citrusy, flowery and bitter with a lingering bitter bit on the tongue. Crisp clean ipa taste. For a 7% by volume the alcohol is well masked and tastes like a lower abv ipa. Smooth beer in the mouth and over the tongue with the hop bitterness that makes your tongue take notice. Maybe could be a little more bubbly for me. Like most ipas this one is easy to drink and delightful."
"I will be buying this again as a steady drinker. Hopefully my next bottle has a little more carbonation."
"Poured into a large 24 oz pilsner type glass. poured out a nice golden/lightamber brew with 1 finger head. Head seems to dissipate quickly.Medium carbonation.Smells of beautiful citric/grapefruit hops. Very nice sweet hoppy taste.Nicely balanced,of course hoppy but not overbearing. Mouthfeel is slightly better then avg.A very good beer."
"Creamy soft body, barely sticky, carbonation perhaps just a touch low. There is little to slow me down here. A winner!"
"Verdict: Racer 5 is a solid, balanced, and drinkable American IPA and another satisfying brew from Bear Republic. A little more focus on the Cascades, and this could really be up there for me."
"This is a great beer. More pleasant to drink then some IPA's I have had, to me this is very well balanced brew, not to hop heavy. It's not my typical style of beer but it's one I would drink if I could get it."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden colour with some floaties. Thick white head that leaves a nice layer after dissipating. Lacing down most of the glass. Smells of citrus hops as well as a yeasty aroma. Very bitter hop bite to this, with some bready malt backbone. I would drink this all the time if we had access to this in Ontario."
"D: Very nice job on this IPA. All the flavor, but nothing harsh. Everything is in balance. One sip invites another."
"Deep yellow color with a very faint amber hue. Big dense head with thick sticky lacings. Surprisingly light carbonation feel, although dense lazy bubbles would linger in the glass after a bit of a swirl. Light yeasty malt aroma with hints of citrus, orange and grapefruit. Very smooth body with well balanced malt and hop characters. went down very smoothly. Very drinkable."
"D-if you're looking for a bitter ipa this is a very good example imo; not a great session beer, but it's definitely nice to fulfill your hop cravings; the alcohol is well hidden and a 22oz is easy to finish"
"D: This is a classic. Something I would get on tap at home for a daily drinker. Really nice. Not quite sessionable but I would session it."
"D - Overall a pretty solid IPA, if a bit ""entry level"". I will say I had a fresh Maharaja prior to this brew so perhaps my tastebuds were blown. May have to re-visit later."
"D- scary drinkable. at 7% abv, I could easily have a few pints on a hot Summer's eve. enjoy!"
"Golden in color and very cloudy, with visible particles and tons of bubbles. The head was thin and dissipated rather quickly. Aromas were primarily pine and resin, some floral aromas in the background. This is a beer with great backbone and mouthfeel, medium to full bodied without the sweetness that some American IPA's bring. Overall a prototypical West Coast IPA with bitterness and hops that are pronounced but not excessive; this is one of the beers that drew me to liking this style. Since it is not overly sweet or heavy, it would be pretty easy to put away a few of these in short order, and the 7% ABV should be noted."
"Fruity and citrusy - cali hop supreme with great balance. Grapefruit hop nose with some floral and pine notes as well. Light pale malt definitely takes a backseat to this well hopped IPA. Light mouthfeel and easy to drink considering its ABV. This is one of the better IPAs I have tried and if I find it on the shelf, I always try to pick one up. You won't be disappointed here."
"D- racer 5 is an off the chart west coast ipa that can be dunked anytime. The brew exhibits properties of a tropical hurricane that develop into a bitter hopfest. Any ipa lover will dazzle in the characteristics. I can drop a racer 5 sixer in a instance. So worth it"
"An all-around great IPA, especially if you are a hop-head. Definitely NOT true to the UK style, but just how I like it. Also, this beer is widely available, at least here in San Diego. I can usually pick up a bomber or ten when I go grocery shopping, or my trips to Bevmo and Holiday. I think I paid about $5-$6..."
"D- This beer goes down very easily and is easy to enjoy. I believe that this is the best IPA that I have tried and will never just walk by a 6 six pack of this."
"On tap at Toronado in San Fran. Poured into pint glass with a small off-white head. Aroma is piney and grassy, not too over the top. Soapy, sticky lacing sticks to the glass. Taste is bitter in the front with mild malt sweetness on the back end. Nice balance, easy to drink. Not the most delicious ipa on earth but solid."
"overall: one of the best IPA's I have ever had this beer is sick easy to see why so many BA's love this beer because its great and one of the best IPA's I have ever had."
"Drinkability - An all around kickass IPA. Right up there with Smuttynose IPA and 90 min on my list. Great grapefruit dominant hop balance with a big body. A big, burly, lip smacking IPA. Unbalanced, but this is how I want my IPAs to taste."
"5- I love this stuff. I've enjoyed it many times but on cask this shines. All day every day racer 5."
"D I like it, it's very drinkable and I would not have guessed at the 7% ABV. It's not as hoppy as I had anticipated based on what I read here. I bought a single bottle but I think I'd like to try and find a few more."
"This sampling was not as intense as some reviewers reported. Maybe the bottle is a bit old (but not over the hill)?"
"D:Extremely drinkable, especially compared to some heavier IPAs and DIPAs. Extreme hopheads might not find it to be their favorite, but an extremely enjoyable beer."
"A bit one sided and on the stronger side for a ""regular"" IPA, there are better IPA's to get that have more dimensions of citrus and grapefruit, whereas this is all pine."
"That being said, it has almost become the Sierra Nevada of 7 years ago for me. I rarely buy it in a store or at a place with a wide selection, but at a bar with 6-10 taps, Racer 5 being the most exotic, I'll often go with it by default."
"D: Rejoice hop heads! This is a crisp and refreshing Hop Hop Hoppy blast to the palate that doesn't get old..."
"Overall, Racer 5 is a very nice example of the style and is yet another good product from Bear Republic. Unfortunately, the dating code is, to me, completely unintelligible, so I can't say whether or not this is a fresh bottle. I'm inclined to think it isn't because the hops seem a bit faded, but regardless this is a very nice IPA and one that I will drink again."
"d - Could break the bank putting these away."
"D- Really drinkable, if only it wasn't for that high alcohol content. You don't taste the alcohol one bit. Its like drinking some alcoholic juice thats more bitter than sweet. In other words, totally awesome...I should actually try pairing one of these with an omelette or something"
"D: Drinkability is better than most IPA's in that the palate paralyzing hops are not in abundance in comparison to most IPA's, probably somewhat of a disappointment to many of the hopheads out there. I like my hoppy brews, but those brews that are in excess of 100 IBU's (Stone's Ruination, pretty much any heady DIPA) are beers to drink maybe one or two of, and the palate is decimated. This one could be that rare moderately sessionable IPA. Seek it out, moderate hopheads."
"Tried it, based on the recommendation of the authors of The Naked Pint (highly recommended). Nice juicy hops come through, from the very beginning, incredibly citrusy, balanced with a malty biscuit flavor throughout. This is a beer that I""d like to always have around. Good for nearly any occasion."
"I am an IPA novice, not having yet had the opportunity to try some of the better examples, but can't imagine any being better than this. The bitterness, the smoothness, drinkability were all exceptional. I wish it were available in Indiana, this would be a regular without question. Great beer."
"Poured into my DFH signature glass. Racer 5 is a hazy orange, with a disappointingly small head that quickly fizzled out. The nose makes up for it though nothing but unabashed citrus hop goodness. The taste follows the nose pretty much exactly, No real malt presence to speak of. Racer 5 is a little bit undercarbonated, which I should have anticipated given the lack of head. Despite that, it's eminently drinkable, and the ABV is hidden well. There's just something about it that doesn't put it in the same league with some of the other hop forward IPAs I've had."
"I would rather drink Hop Rod Rye but this was the only option available at the time."
"D- A very nice I.P.A. by Bear Republic brewery, bought a 22.oz of this ale drank it with my wife and we both enjoyed it very much."
"D - I'd sit down and enjoy a couple pints I'd say. This is a pretty damn good IPA, maybe not my favorite but I'd buy this one again sometime. Definitely recommended. Cheers!"
"A great IPA! I like my IPAs to be generously hopped but have the malt to just slightly bring the balance back. This beer does that perfectly."
"One of my staple beers, not going to go too in-depth on this one. It doesn't pack the best punch for an IPA, but is better than average IMO and for the price is better than say, Stone IPA; definitely a mid-range IPA. I am happy to see that it is becoming more and more available in Southern California at places that are not necessarily ""beer bars"". The beer zeitgeist moves forward..."
"D/O- A great beer that is clean, crisp, and gives you everything you need and want in an American IPA. Just another great, easily obtained, and very affordable beer from Bear Republic. Give it a try. Cheers."
"D: If you drink this before it warms up, any hint of alcohol is completely masked. The beer packs a lot of punch in the way of flavor and is very drinkable."
"I would definitely recommend this beer to a friend. A nice, very drinkable IPA."
"D - Man I need a case of this! A+!"
"Overall very good. Looked amazing in the glass. I didn't get much aroma from it but the taste made up for it. Above average ipa. Will get this again."
"Had to edit this in the end, as you get down to the bottom of the beer, where the gunk and the chunks are, you do get that bitterness, so it does get you, but it does not resonate through the whole beer, gets better as you go on."
"i was recomended to try this ipa ffrom a fellow that works at u-pick 6 on peach street erie,pa. he has never steered me wrong and sure was on the money with this one!it pours an orangeish amber color,nice half inch head on it,leaves a bit of lacing around the glass,and tastes of hops,and citrus.this beer is excellent deffinate top five india pale ales i have ever tasted.this has become a must have for me,though i have to travel 25 miles to get it definately worth the trip!"
"Overall a solid IPA and wil be looking for more from this brewery."
"The mouthfeel and finish are dry and bitter. However, this is not a palate killer. It hits the mark. The medium carbonation keeps this from being too syrupy despite the hop resin presence."
"Not as bright and juicy as the bottled version. Still, a solid West Coast IPA."
"D: Almost like drinking liquid hop juice but yet not overwhelming. There is a decent malt backing but the flavor comes off all hops. It is easy to drink and pairs well with aged cheddar or other aged hard cheeses."
"I will buy this beer for the rest of my life. I want to make sweet sweet love to it and raise a family together. I want to wake up every morning to have this beer staring back at me. I want to mount it from behind and ride it into the sunset. Nothing can compare to the passion that I have developed upon first taste. I will always remember this moment of my first Racer 5."
"d - A pretty good and drinkable IPA. I enjoyed the pine and ctirus hops smell and taste. Would have again."
"D: Not sure if it lived up to all the hype but definitely a solid IPA. Think I'll be having this one again."
"Pours a slighty cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, huge foamy head, nice lacing throughout the drink. Scents of hops aplenty, sweet malts, yeast, and citrus. The taste is sweet and bitter. Very nice bite at the finish. The finish is also dry. Medium body. Very nice balanced and slightly carbonated feel."
"Twelve ouncer pours into my chalice a light golden orange color. Not much head to speak of, thin cling of lace encircles the entire glass. Hazy with what appears to be floaties floating by. Appetizing. Smell is pretty mild, citrus aromas abound. Tastes wondrous, nice grapefruit and piney notes greet the tongue. The hops are not overpowering in this brew, my opinion is that it is wonderfully balanced for an IPA. No overkill in the hop department. Really no maltiness to be detected here. Has a slight oily, slick feel about it. This brew does feel light in the mouth for the slightly high alcohol content. Though I am not complaining here. I could make this a session brew, as it is that good. Definitely a good score on the drinkability scale. This is a top notch IPA."
"This was a pretty good IPA. Not quite as good as it's rated IMO, but hey, everyones taste is different. Recommend others give it a try."
"Another thing that bugs me is the fact that Bear Republic prints ""Honest Ales"" on the six pack packaging, however, no freshness or bottled-on dating can be found anywhere."
"I have drank Racer 5 on multiple occasions and often hear it acclaimed but I can't say it has ever inspired me. I finally decided to pay more attention to Race 5. While enjoying the aromatics, I find the rest of it rather ordinary and a bit out of balance. It also leaves me wanting a more complexity. The bitterness on the finish seems out of place. Happy to drink if it is served to me but not a beer I will be purchasing with my own money."
"Served in an English style pint glass. Bright copper color with about 2 inches of foamy overflowing head. Strong smells of hop aromas both grapefruit and pine. The flavor comes forward with strong citrus hops, flavors of grapefruit, orange and lemons. Hop flavor profile added pine-like nature. No real malt balance. Mouthfeel is smooth and very drinkable. Very drinkable, a second or third, yes very possible."
"D- Amazing taste, amazing abv, amazing everything. Extremely solid brew that i will drink over and over and over again."
"Drinkability is good for a beer of its bitterness and ABV, but then again, I love American IPA's."
"D: Very drinkable IPA with a nice citrus hop and light body. Slightly complex hop flavor makes it fun for the hop head to try and distinguish."
"D: Yes. Pretty much the prototypical IPA perfectly executed. One of my favorite IPAs."
"The Racer 5 IPA pours an orange color with good clarity and brightness to the pour. A nice frothy 1 finger head and good retention on the glass. Smell and quaff are mostly sweet lemons and grapefruit with a subtle hop finish. In between are characteristics of malts and pines. Very light and delicate tasting but nice and refreshing. Mouthfeel is thin bodied but good carbonation and quite refreshing. Drinkability is solid. A very sessionable style of ale and the taste and abv are par compared to others."
"Overall, a very good IPA that has a good malt backbone without being overly sweet. Delicious hop profile."
"very good west coast IPA a little boozy though. can drink a few but not too many."
"I'm just starting to get an appreciation for the Pale ales, APA's/IPA's and DIPA'S. I feel like I got a good start with this entry, a reasonably priced bomber (~4.50) and a beer with good flavor."
"Medium bodied. Fairly light carbonation, not very active on the tongue. Very, very drinkable. An approachable West Coast IPA."
"Great drinkability! This tasty gem can be enjoyed anytime."
"I poured this hopped up beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was hoppy smelling and poured a cloudy wheat looking color. The smell and taste also was like it had pineapple in it and was fruity beyond what I like tasting. I will not buy again."
"I can drink this one all day."
"drinkability is obviously great here. 12 bucks is maybe a tad much for a 6-pack, but I will continue to buy this again and again. Bear Republic certainly knows how to make an American IPA - Racer 5 and Hop Rod Rye are both among the best, most notable ones available. This is easily my favorite go-to for this style. 5"
"This is a full body beer with a slightly dry or bitter ending."
"Pours a nice dark golden color with a firm white head. Big citrusy aromas (grapefruit and maybe a bit of zesty lemon). Taking a drink, the big hoppy flavors assault the palate, but in a very good way. Mid palate I get citrus, followed by a lightly sweet maltiness leading to a lasting bitter finish. Eminently drinkable, this is a perfect example of the west coast ipa style. Highly recommended."
"The body is medium. It has nice carbonation making it quite smooth drinking. Overall a very solid IPA. I don't know why it has taken me so long to try this one but I'm glad that I did."
"Good drinkability. A beer that can definitely keep you entertained for a night of drinking."
"A local beer for me. Brewed within 50 miles of my home. Short lived head, burnt copper color, nice hop come on with a slowly pleasant diminishing of the hop aftertaste. A beer to keep around! fairly persistent lacing, nice clarity. The brewery has recently started to distribute this beverage in six packs, as opposed to only in 22oz bottles."
"Overall very good."
"D: Overall, excellent. A great version of an American IPA. Very drinkable. I love big IPAs, this is not one of those. But, it is a perfect example of this style of beer."
"I'm surprised by how bitter the Racer 5 ISN'T. Compared to the nose, the hops are more refined, less ""in your face"" than you would expect, but still pleasantly hoppy, and perfectly in line with the style. The sweet, fruity, thick bodied malt tastes roll along the tongue so smoothly, I almost want to compare it to a sweet milkshake (lol), but that wouldn't be quite appropriate. Very delicious, nonetheless. Easy drinking, medium-thick bodied, velvety smooth mouthfeel."
"Could easily kick back a few, even at 7% abv."
"D: Quite smooth for a hoppy west coast IPA, an easy 7% ABV. Tastes just like an IPA should be, very tasty."
"One of my favorites. probably the beer that I have had the most of over the past year, a very consistent brew that I'm sure to visit again and again. I love the bottle-conditioning, the up-front citrus followed by a bit of pine and oh-so pleasant bitterness. Highly recommended."
"Awesome, awesome IPA, this might be my favorite beer!! Extremely well balanced, their is a strong hop presence but not overpowering and goes down so smooth, it taste so great!! PLEASE TRY THIS BEER!!!"
"Light golden hues, nicely hazed with a firm, ivory head sitting one half finger high. Emitting both light khaki and warmer amber highlights when held to the bar light. Straight. Not far off in the nose - bold with an easy blend of pine, grapefruit and an echo of sugary sweet grains. The epitome of IPA, if not totally memorable. This classic nose is taken much further in the mouth, and especially the mouthfeel. The drink starts off with a small kick of light bready malts, just enough to stand at attention, then blossoms smoothly into a pungent blend of flowers, fruit and mothers milk. An experience of wilderness brought to life by the brewer. mountain grasses, pineapple, mango and mealy apple are brightened by some high sugary notes and a lightly crisp carbonation. steady as she goes, full as the beer has spread, floral hops and supple yeast combine in the back of the mouth to provide a soothing sense of satisfaction. Velvety. Long. soft. finish, but not a lurking presence... fades with a slow dial. No bitter resins pooling, instead the fade is lightly sweet and milky. truly gorgeous. The brewer has tuned in to a recipe that should not be touched. Difficult to improve this experience. I can't capture the full satisfaction with words. Truly special."
"D - A great west coast IPA. Definitely worthy of being a regular in my fridge."
"D: Sir, may I have another? A unique IPA which disappeared all too quickly and deserves a place in the top shelf of my fridge."
"M/D: The most drinkable IPA I've had so far. Alcohol is near undetectable. Carbonation is spot on, with bitterness kept to a minimal level. Only after two, I actually felt a slight buzz going on. Definitely worth a try."
"D-7% abv isn't too bad, and if I had a couple more, they would likely disappear by the end of the night as well. I'll have ot make sure I get some more of these next time I'm in Mass."
"22 oz. bottle. Lovely strong aroma of sweet malt and pineapple citrus hops. Beautiful clear golden color with a substantial sticky white head that forms a web down the glass. Quite bitter but even more sweet. Full bodied and smooth with a long finish that manages to be both sweet and bitter. Finely crafted but a bit too sweet for my taste."
"Very good IPA. Probably not at the top of my favorites, but high quality nonetheless."
"Though I will stand up for East coast IPAs in their own right (Berkshire Lost Sailor, Smuttynose, Mayflower, etc) I'm a sucker for a West coast citrus bomb. This is a go to when I have the urge."
"D: Not a palate-ruining IPA at all and its crisp, clean citrus tastes lead me to believe that I could drink several of these puppies and be pretty joyful."
"A nice bright orange color with virtually no head (which may have been the way it it was poured). It has a wonderfully robust fruity hop aroma complements the sweetness of the beer. A nice velvety feel lingers with the bitterness and sweet alcohol flavor."
"I will delete my original review. This guy deserves an A."
"Overall Impression: This is an excellent IPA from California! This beer should go over well with Newbeez that do not have an aversion to hops."
"D: Very drinkable beer, the flavors blend well and it's a pretty sessionable IPA."
"The mouthfeel is just a bit thin for such a great, complex beer, but it's so delicious I could drink a sixer if I wasn't careful. An absolutely outstanding beer, one of my favorites."
"D: Very drinkable beer that I could easily see becoming a staple IPA in my beer diet."
"The bitterness of this beer combines with a bit of sweetness to produce a light to medium body, and the carbonation gives it a bit of a crisp, almost silky feel in the mouth."
"Drinkability - One of the best. I like different types of IPAs and this one is an excellent hoppy treat. Great job Bear Republic..."
"D: Like this one could drink a few on tap and would be liking it very much."
"D: This is a damn fine example of an American IPA. Very balanced, yet on the hoppy side, it goes down easy. It's a shame that this beer is not available here. Thanks Tyler!"
"Dangerously drinkable."
"The feel was very lively. It had a good chewy thick feel to it, the bubbly carbonation kept it crisp and interesting. The dry finish lingered long and kept me wanting another sip to quench and ponder. It is definitely a no dillly-dallying IPA, awesome flavor."
"D- Dangerous. Good easily sit down and have a few of these."
"D- This is a pretty good IPA. Nothing crazy going on here but definitley not boring either."
"Really good with a spicy dish. I tried this with homemade Panang Curry and it was perfect!"
"No harshness or woodiness, coupled with intense hop flavor and good mouthfeel makes this brew a good sipper."
"Overall a very solid IPA and wil be looking for more from this brewery."
"D: ipa's are my least drinkable style, but I could put these down, due the fact this beer has balance and tastes refreshing."
"Worth a try for the lovely orange and grapefruit flavour, but shake the bottle first."
"Initial sniff after pour was fantastic- got that really piney hop hit. Golden color with minimal head. Admittedly surprised at all the hype given to this IPA because I honestly didn't get it in the taste. Malty with some floral and pine hop aftertaste- expected more. Overall a decent enough IPA, but somewhat middle of the pack for me."
"clear amber color very light tan soapy head with some retention clinging, smells like pine and grass clippings, really a odd smell not like other ipas I have had. Seriously the smell reminds me of something more earthy. taste is a huge dissapointment. Malty with some pine hops at the end to back it up but very weak. Easy to drink since the flavor is weak. Not going to lie, my least favorite IPA I have had."
"Overall: Nice example of an American Pale/IPA - not a punch-in-the-gut, over the top IPA. Very drinkable."
"D: Great flavor and not too heavy or overpowering in any specific area. Very nice beer and very drinkable."
"D - Goes down easy, could drink a lot more."
"This brew surprised me as a very approachable IPA for non hopheads. It has a very solid malty backbone with noticeable hops for support in IPA fashion. It reminded me a full body amber with the hop schedule dialed up to IPA status. Malty sweet without being cloying. I enjoyed this brew much more than I expected."
"Overall this was a fine beer to have with wings. Not a session beer, a bit to strong for that. Not mind-blowing, as the website might imply, but a good solid hoppy IPA. I'd have this one again for sure."
"D- This was was a very drinkable IPA. I was actually quite shocked as to how much I enjoyed this beer. The drinkability on this is good but not over the top. After about 3 of these I would like to move onto something else."
"Drinkability- I'm going to have another right now."
"All around, a great beer! Love the taste, texture, and the value. A reasonably priced bomber that I would put up against some higher priced IPAs that I have had."
"Bear Republics strength as a brewery, seems to be getting the most out of their hops. The distinctive qualities of three relatively similar hop varieties all come out in this beer. Love."
"Pours golden orange with a white head. The aroma is floral hops with some citrus and some malty sweetness. The flavor is grassy, piney hops. There is some hop bitterness, but it is secondary to the hop flavor. A nice, fruity well-balanced American IPA. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation."
"Very drinkable, well balanced beer...greatly refreshing!"
"D: Pretty drinkable. The dry finish and large amount of hop presence doesnt' balance as well as if it probably had more of a malt backbone. Still a very good ipa worthy of the high marks it has recieved."
"D: Pass the bottle, please. This stuff is really good."
"Overall, a very good IPA"
"Beer poured to a cloudy dull golden color with a good sized white head that has nice retention and left thick lacing. I see a lot of floaties suspended in the beer, I am not sure if they are pieces of hops or yeast but I would think it could be due to the bottle conditioning? I will say this the smell of this brew is great, a nice mix of hops as pine is clearly there but also a nice juicy citrus aroma. The malt is faintly there but it is hard to pick up. The taste is great, the hops are in the forefront and give a nice flavor, more on the citrus side of things with a slight tea like finish. Has a somewhat sweet feel to it as well as a slight toasted character and does feel slick on the mouth. Adequate carbonation and the 7% ABV seems to be completely hidden. Overall this is a excellent brew, now for my taste the bomber is the perfect size for me as this hoppy style is usually a one and done for the evening. Very impressed with the Bear Republic beers I have been able to try."
"I would assume this bottle isn't too old given the level of hop flavor, but I wouldn't call it super fresh, even though my review yields an ""A". Sky's the limit for this drinking man's IPA."
"I call this beer ""the most convenient backup."" When I go into a bar for the first time I look at the lineup just like every other beer geek. I take my time to scope the varieties and countries of origin. If I see Racer 5 up there I at least know that I have a beer that I will enjoy and will keep me planted on a bar stool for a few minutes. Racer 5 is easy to drink and it's murky volume allows for a great texture. Although 7%, the alcohol is not incredibly present which generally leads to multiple pints. Hops are significantly present with a touch of citrus. I love that this brew can serve as an everyday choice or become a great session beer depending on how I'm feeling. I would always suggest Racer 5 as a great starter I.P.A. and Bear Republic has been consistent with this beer for many years."
"d- very good. decent malt backbone, makes it a lil less drinkable than some west coast ipas"
"D: especially good after something softer, like the Avery Kaiser"
"Lighter end of medium body with a clean crisp dry hop presence. Light malts provide a nice balanced backbone. Dry piny notes with lemon and grapefruit as well as some subtle biscuit and graham cracker malt. Sweet with a dry lingering finish."
"D: A go-to/fall-back kind of IPA for me. While it will never offend, it certainly won't excite either."
"D - very high. Overall delicious well rounded. good hop notes. Balanced malt notes."
"Golden honey colored, minimal head but nice sticky lacing. Crisp piney and floral hop scent. Taste is much like the smell, very clean bitterness. Feel is smooth, light but nicely balanced carbonation, and finishes bitter on the tongue. Great beer to have a few of."
"Golden color with a frothy head and lovely lacing that seems to be sticking around quite well so far. Scents of citrus and alcohol, standard IPA smell coming off of this. The First Swig reveals a really smooth balanced standard IPA taste. Very nice mouthfeel and drinkability seems to be right up there with many of my favorite IPA's. I think this is a solid brew, but I am not convinced it is anything to really go crazy over. If you see it on the shelf and haven't tried it, give it a go. It won't disappoint, but won't make your jaw drop. A Solid IPA, Bear Republic!"
"D - A great IPA. One of the best I've tried. Stone and Victory's Hop Devill are probably of the few that compete with this. Super sessionable."
"D: VERY drinkable, goes down easily on a warm ""winter"" night in California! Fantasic IPA."
"D: This is the best IPA I have had to date."
"Drinkability: Wow I would definitely have this again and recommend this to those hop heads out there who enjoy different hop profiles in their brews."
"Drinkability:A great West Coast IPA which for the price, can't be beat. This beer certainly has earned a spot on my shopping list of awesome IPA to rotate through my fridge."
"Poured from a cellar-temperature bottle into two standard pint glasses. Beery is a crystal clear honey-amber color with a quickly dissipating off-white head that leaves plenty of lace. Smell is of hops, with some citrusy grapefruit and woodsy notes. The flavor is very hoppy, with the woodsy hop flavor dominating but other less identifiable notes present as well. There is a hint of malt at the end, but little to no sweetness - this is a dry beer. The ABV is high, but this brew doesn't taste strongly of alcohol - just a hint of heat indicates the strength. The carbonation really carries the hop flavor through my mouth, and the hop bitterness lingers long after I've swallowed due to the way it coats your mouth. This beer feels good in the mouth, with an appropriate amount of body, and plenty of carbonation. This is truly a great IPA, very drinkable."
"Served from a cellar temperature 22oz bottle, split between two pint glasses. It has a translucent golden orange color, with a pretty head of pure white foam. It leaves some good lacing on the glass. The aroma is all hops, both citrusy and woodsy. As you would expect, the flavor is also dominated by the hop character. It starts out dry, then builds to sharp bitterness that lingers on after you swallow. You can detect some alcohol, especially in the finish and aftertaste. There are flavors that remind me of fruit and forests. This is as good as an IPA can get. It has a medium body and a higher-than-average amount of carbonation. It leaves a coating to your mouth that evaporates while you let the bitter flavors linger. This is an impressively drinkable IPA. There are hops everywhere, but I never grow tired of them. I wish I had more than this one bottle."
"D: Just a rock solid IPA. Seems sessionable to me, but I see it listed at 7%. Already kicking myself that I picked up just one bottle instead of an entire 6 pack"
"D and overall impression: drinkability is just ok for me. I think it's a little to thick on the palate to be sessionalable, but the flavor is definately there. Overall this is a good beer but I'm not as high on it as some other ba's. Skal."
"-Bye"
"D: As I said, this is probably my favorite easily attainable IPA. A fixture in my fridge that I can (and do) drink all night."
"D: Good and smooth."
"Also have tried the bottled version."
"D: I'm glad that I took notes on this one, I thought that I had tried Racer 5 before, and hadn't. Nicely balanced, good bite, goes down easily and we certainly made a night from this beer!"
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a clear copper. The head is 2 fingers deep, rock solid and sticky as hell. Really strong aroma for an IPA. The piney hops really hit hard. The flavor is hop forward, copious amounts of pine and citrus. It has enough malt for some balance. The beer has a sticky mouthfeel, is medium bodied and generally a well done brew."
"Drinkability: Solid IPA. Over the top in terms of hops for most IPAs out there and it borders on the flavor and intensity of DIPAs but its delicious so that makes this very drinkable and sessionable."
"D. Smooth beer that is quite drinkable. Didn't quite live up to my expectations but good non the less."
"Shows a golden color in the glass with a thick white front, excellent head retention, and an above average lacing. There is sediment in the glass...wish I knew that the 12 oz bottle was bottle conditioned. Yep...there's hops in there. Aromas of pine, grapefruit, orange, lemon-lime, subtle mango, some hop spiciness, fresh hop flowers, carmel maltiness, & a touch of biscuit. If you're looking for a great example of a west coast IPA...look no further. In terms of flavor, everything that you get on the nose, you get on the palate. The bitterness of the beer is unavoidable, but smooth and tingly from beginning to end. Well balanced from the malt character to the overwhelming hop presence. Long finish. Overall a great IPA! if you haven't had the racer 5 before....it's about time you did!"
"D- This is a pretty easy drinking IPA. It is not bad but there is nothing that really distinguishes it from other IPA's."
"D: Easy enough to drink, nice flavors and a strong hop profile with a light bitterness is nice. Needs a little more sweetness to kick it up to the next level. Definitely will get again though. Recommended if looking for a hop fix."
"D- All around, a phenomenal American IPA. I could drink these all night. I am aware that the boundaries are quite loose and pliable, but for an American IPA (not a double, imperial, ""triple", etc.) this is one of the best I have had."
"I get some wildly inconsistent ones of these, probably because of the lack of bottle dating and large distribution footprint. When its on, its on. When its not, it lacks the hop vibrancy and takes on that vague woody bitterness."
"D: This is an excellent IPA... very flavorful and hoppy, but still quite easy to drink."
"Very good IPA, up there with the best of them. Especially nice combination of citrus and bitterness. I would drink this regularly if I was fortunate enough to have access."
"D: High ABV - you might not want to session with it if you aren't used to 7+ ABV but if you can hang with it, you will not regret it."
"D- really drinkable IPA, larger than average ABV, but that doesnt stand out too much."
"Overall it is a decent IPA, I was expecting more, but it is not bad."
"well this beer falls in the category of least favorites of IPAs!!! i got this on tap @ barneys beanery in santa monica a great place for food too! lots of draft beers too! anyway it poured off an orangey gold yellow color! th esmell was amazing i loved it but then i tasted it and was not impressed! it smell very citrusy and grassy sorta!! i did not enjoy the mouthfeel too much it was a bit nippy and finished bitter!! i givve it a low drinkability because i was barely able to get this one down!! ugh!!"
"D - In your face flavors, but so fun to drink. Solid."
"D: Not my favorite IPA, but it's very good. Very drinkable and lots of good flavor. Hops just a little too overpowering in the finish, but that's only a minor complaint."
"Drink: Pretty good brew here, could drink a few i am sure. This is a good IPA I have wanted to try, but Bear Republic grabbed me by the juevos with Mach X."
"Overall this is a very drinkable IPA, even at 7%. It's also a real looker, and the flavor definitely doesn't disappoint. I'll buy it again, for sure."
"Final thoughts: A nice semi heavy IPA. It's not an imperial or double or anything like that, just a nice hoppy IPA. A slight malt and alcohol presence, and seems like a few different blended hops, but not much on the grapefruit end, so this is a completely different beast than most. But overall a good consistent IPA."
"D-so drinkable, one of my favorite straight IPA's and a go to. The carbonation and bitterness will tend to make it fizzle out after a couple; but one is never enough!"
"Overall: Don't like hops? stay away from IPA's, Love hops? You'll ask for another in no time flat. I don't think I would change anything about it except maybe make it exist more in my fridge."
"Clear amber pour contrasts with a nice tan head that almost looks like it could be used in an advertisement for beer. Citrus hops make me very excited to drink. Tastes as great as it smells. Hops are present, and not overpowering, but most certainly present enough to let you know that you are drinking an IPA, and a damn good one at that. I want to keep drinking this all day, and very well could. It's a perfect combo of taste and smooth feeling. This is one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of tasting and i cannot wait to do it again"
"I don't understand why they named it what they did. There must be a story there somewhere."
"D- Quite an awesome beer indeed. Could easily have many of these in one sitting. Will definitely be getting more of these next time I get the chance."
"This beer is my favorite non-Stone IPA. A nice, west coast Hoppy beer for a session or for just a couple. Great citrus-y hops, perfect color and head, just an all around great beer at a reasonable price. Nothing bad I can say about it. Just try it out."
"Drinkability: the funkiness is getting to be too much. I will definitely finish the bottle; who knows, it might start to grow on me. This will definitely be a beer I revisit when I've got another hundred or two beers under my belt."
"The nose is big with citrusy hops. There's a second variety in there as well, something that gives a slightly more pungeant, earthy aroma. This has great flavor with grapefruit being prominent. The finish is long and increasingly hoppy and the body/mouthfeel is full and buttery smooth."
"D - Definately will get another have to get a racer x next time I am down in MA as Bear republic is not distributed in Maine."
"drinkability is great - this beer is in my top 5 of all-time great ipa's"
"d- all in all this beer is an unoffensiveand enjoyable IPA, but comes off a bit unbalanced with a lot of sweetness and not enough malt to carry it. The hops are fairly substantial but stay sharply to the fruity/flowery side. I would call it a decent to strong summer IPA, but drinking it in this season feels slightly out of place and unsatisfying."
"This was a really good beer."
"D=enjoyable, and very drinkable. nothing keeping me from downing a sixer of these."
"Overall, another solid brew from Bear Republic. I definitely liked Hop Rod Rye more, but this is still a great beer."
"Tons of hops but it doesn't rip your tongue out. Great beer."
"12 oz bottle (from make your own variety pack) to glass. Color is about like apple juice, head was a bit thin. Classic IPA smells, fruitiness and citrus. Good balance on the taste, I usually get malt up front and hops in the back and no different here. Bitter but not the biggest, which is fine with me. Pretty standard west coast IPA."
"D - That lingering hop bite just makes you want to keep going back...a fresh bottle of this is dangerously drinkable...a well balanced beer that never becomes to hoppy...if there is such a thing!"
"Served on tap at a restaurant, I erroreously thought I was ordering Racer X. Oh well. The beer arrived at my table in a standard pint glass, and by the time it got to me there was only a thin circle of white around the perimeter of the glass. The beer was nearly clear with just a slight haziness. Color was difficult to discern due to the low lighting. Certainly smells like an IPA. Pine and citrus are evident. The taste was consistent with the smell, but a bit more perfumey. Very hoppy. Apparently my palate is not sophisticated enough to comment on the malt character, as I really detected none. Just alot of juicy hop bitterness. That's not a bad thing. Went well with pizza. I enjoy the occasional super-hoppy beer, but only one per session."
"Mouthfeel is nearly perfect for an IPA and almost starts to border on what I would expect from a DIPA. Sticky, sweet, smooth and bitter all in one. This beer is highly drinkable. I could drink this all day and all night. I will definitely be seeking this beer out again and looking for more Bear Republic brews."
"The bottle-conditioned thing had me a little at first, but this is a pretty solid beer. I'm gonna poke around now for some Racer X!"
"Pow! Really nice light hoppiness with a good amount of sweetness but just the right amount of bitterness for a west coast IPA. Good thick mouthfeel, slightly syrupy but still good!"
"Poured into my X-Mas in July Winking Lizard glass. This beer is a nice golden color with arousing smell. I just love IPAs but this wasn't just any other beer. It's smooth with a great finish. Would be great with steak dinner. Described as an ""agressive IPA"" this is no joke. Try it if you get the chance. If you like IPAs then this is a must."
"until recently i'd never heard of Bear Republic. i've only had two of their brews and i'm already a huge fan! i love the bold hops flavors they bring to the table. racer 5 and hop rod rye are now my IPA of choice, if only they were a bit cheaper."
"22oz bomber. Pours a nice hazy orange colour. So smooth, nice amount of bitterness. So delicious...did I say how smooth and delicious it was? Fantastic beverage. God, I need this beer again. Can't wait to go back to Buffalo for more of this beautiful beer."
"Overall, This beer is definitely ""an aggressive styled India Pale Ale", as the bottle describes it. Although it is straightforward, I can't help but desire more complexity in an American IPA."
"The overall drinkability is very smooth and not overpowering, which makes you want to have another glas!!. I highly recommend this IPA and it may just be the best I have had in a while. To the store...for more!!!"
"Still do not have a taste for these overly hoppy IPAs. I like the look, nice gold with lots of floaties from the bottle conditioning. The piney aroma is not overbearing. The taste gets better as you go but I am still not a fan of chewing pine needles. I would never buy any of these, but will drink one occasionally when offered in a trade."
"Overall this is a standout among standby's in the world of IPA's. Worth a shot if you haven't had it."
"Ripe citrus hops and a soft, green bitterness intermingle with some flowery/stone fruit esters. These flavors are nicely integrated and give Racer 5 a slight ""funky", high-grade marijuana flavor that I can always recognize in a blind tasting. The mouthfeel is soft, with medium carbonation. Malts lend a a bit of substance mid-palate, along with the esters. The finish is softly bitter with a hint of raw grain. One of the nation's best IPAs, partly because of it's availability and ability to taste good in the bottle as well as from the tap."
"Golden amber body with ivory head. Poured into a pint glass with a big frothy head. The smell is fantastic offering vanilla cake batter and pineapple syrup. Nice hop presence in the nose and great hop presence in the taste. Medium malt presence in the backing but much larger hop presence up front. Nice ripe tangerine, bitter ruby grapefruit, sprucy and piney. Really well done, has the mouthfeel of a great Imperial IPA or close to it. Reminds me of the Two-Hearted Ale. Not as smooth but close to it and hoppier with slightly more malt character. Hard to find a better everyday IPA."
"Hop heads take notice, track this down, find it. The hop character is a nicely balanced mixture of pine and citrus. A great great beer."
"D - Can definately do a lot of these, citris will become a little overpowering after a while, but it would be a while. This is a very fantastic beer."
"D- overall a very good beer, wish they had better availability, a go to IPA for sure."
"Dull amber color with an off-white crown of foam and some light lace. The smell of hops is noticeable on the nose with a faint citrus aroma. Strong citrus flavors come through first dominated by a semi-sweet orange with a trace of grapefruit held in check by a malty backbone. A nice fresh, cleansing hoppy quality on the finish that's dry and snappy. Everything is blended to near perfection. For a relatively high ABV beer this one goes down easily and is delicious to boot. I could probably drink a handful of these before I knew what hit me, and I mean that as a nod to the beer and not my stupidity. At any rate, I highly recommend this one."
"Drinkability: This seems even more of an easy drinking beer than a good deal of the other ipas I have been having lately, like Ithaca's Flower Power."
"This is my go to IPA"
"You must consume atleast 1 of these in your life."
"Drinkability- This beer is very delicious. I loved it. Will drink it again. Bear Republic does a good job. Wonderful"
"D- I could and have drank this beer all night long"
"Pours a deep straw to reddish yellow, smell is piney hops. Taste is fresh, lots of piney hops and citrus with enough malt to balance it just a bit, this is a hop bomb, almost a DIPA? Which was what I first thought. Mouthfeel is perfect, slightly oily and chewy. This did not get a chance to warm, very drinkable, but too high an abv to session. I would buy this again, really enjoyable."
"O: A very good IPA, and at 7%, this could get a person into trouble somewhat quickly. I would have guessed it in the 5% range. Alcohol is not that evident, although you do suspect it from the warmth in your throat. A tasty beer indeed."
"My favorite IPA. Just claimed a permanent spot on the tap. Has a great orange color and an easy drink as far as IPA are concerned. It has become a favorite at the restaurant in a very short time.In fact, people have traveled to Slater's 50/50 for the sole reason that we have this beer on tap. Real bitter real hoppy real good!"
"Medium to medium low carbonation, lingering bitter finish that builds"
"AFTERMATH. Not my favorite. I would have liked a little more balance. It smells really, really wonderful though."
"D: For me, this was an easy drinking beer. Refreshing."
"D-- Not bad. I am not a hop head and the first time I tried Racer 5 I struggled finishing it. 7% is barely there. Great beer but one is enough for me to do in a sitting. Good beer to build hop palate on"
"Drinkability: very solid offering. very drinkable. definitely would drink this again and look for it when on beer runs."
"Finding a beer with such drinkability is like having an epiphany. Just had Brooklyn lager the other day and it was the same. This is another very pleasant surprise. I have always avoided IPAs, but I had a feeling that this one would turn the tide."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability. This beer is the bomb! So smooth and easy to drink. Excellent session beer"
"The mouthfeel is smooth, and a moderate carbonation gives a crisp bite to it. The body is medium to full and really supports the creaminess."
"D: Good, but not great. Odd combo of strong piney hops and malt backbone. Cask is not my favorite IPA serving device."
"Poured into a pint glass hazy orange with a thick white head, good lacing, but lots of sediment. Smell isn't too strong, but has floral hop hints. Taste is very smooth. A nice hop bite up front, could use a little more sweet flavor on the back end, but it doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste like most AIPA's do.n The mouthfeel is good."
"We accidentally paired this with Asian pears and damned if it wasn't the best accident of the day. The crisp sweetness of the pear helped balance the bitterness of the beer, dancing toward a mix of vanilla, banana and tropical fruit. Wow."
"Overall, this Bear Republic offering is not an IPA that blew me away (unlike Hop Rod Rye, which ranks among my top 5 IPAs). There are other IPS that better showcase the totality of what the hop can be. But a solid, drinkable, tasty IPA is nothing to be ashamed of. I wouldn't throw rocks at this IPA. Its clearly west-coast in nature and would satisfy a hop craving. Its good stuff."
"Moderate body and and mild carbonation. Solid medium mouthfeel and very drinkable if you can stand the huge hops. An exceptional IPA."
"D: Drinks pretty easy, though for some people I would imagine the bitterness could get in the way."
"D: Light to throw a few back, but needs more flavor. Again, the big knock on this beer is inconsistency."
"Perfect for a hot day."
"Mouthfeel of moderate wieght. Drinkability smooth, light, refreshing. This is a fine -- albeit heavy-hopped -- IPA. The ""heavy hop"" works well here and is balanced by the beer's refreshing drinkability. A great summer evening brew."
"Poured cold at Moe's in Lee, MA this one shows a clear amber color with a slight bubbly white cap and good lacing. The aroma is not very strong but suggests piney hops and caramel bread. The flavor jumps out bold and delicious with a tangy pine hop and orange toffee complements. Solidly mid-bodied for a smooth feel with modest carbonation. This leaves a decided lemony bite but it's mostly a beautiful bready hop blend that's plenty drinkable but may be a bit much to session for some. Nice..."
"Have had this on tap a number of times. Anywhere from blah to beautiful, this brew is too unpredictable to buy again. It's all over the place and too dependent on carbonation for success. I'll stick to more reliable options in the future, and this 'bottle conditioned' serving seems no different. Buttery, sweet and unpredictable in the hops/carbonation/feel."
"Overall impression: Nice example of a west coast IPA - lots of hops, highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: I really wanna give this one an A-, but I can't seem to find a category where I would rank it higher than ""Good"" (4.0). This is a very solid IPA that I would recommend to anyone, and I myself will likely be ordering it again. For those that like piney IPAs, you'll especially enjoy Racer 5."
"Drinkability: excellent standby brew; well balanced but with enough hops to keep my hop head gears turning."
"Drinkability is fine - several of these is no problem. For a hophead, this is a very nice effort from Bear Republic. Bravo!!"
"Easy drinker very smooth."
"this is my first bear republic brew, and i have to say its pretty good. i have no clue where i can get a hold of their racer X, but who knows maybe i'll find that in a glass of mine in the future, but i'll be trying other bear republics for certain."
"D- Dangerously quaffable. Now I know why people talk about this one so much. I'd probably take a 90 Minute over this, but for the price, yeah, I'll have another twelve."
"Notes: I decided a while ago to continue to try all styles but I am really getting bored of IPAs. To me they are too one dimensional and frankly, don't taste good. This one is a solid IPA with big tastes in the genre of Bell's Two Hearted but I am bored."
"Morey's Bottom Line: VERY similar to Bell's Two Hearted, and I mean VERY similar. Which obviously means that it's darn good."
"Had this on-tap at the Rogue Public House in San Francisco. A lovely beer that seems to get better with time- or maybe that its really easy to find fresh these days, and this beer is just fantastic fresh. I actually like it better than the Racer X. Pours dark golden with a fine white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves some great lacing. Smells nicely of bitter citrus and pine with just enough malt to keep things balanced. Tastes great when fresh, like this is. Wonderful sappy pine and zingy, bitter citrus, along with some dill herbal notes, and a bracing bitterness throughout. Not watery at all, so there is enough of a malt component to keep the beautiful hops supported. A delicious beer."
"Racer 5 definitely competes with the best of American IPAs, but for some reason it doesn't seem to stand out. Maybe it's just me from having too many IPAs lately, or maybe there's not enough going on in the recipe to keep me interested. I'd recommend it to anyone, but I don't see it working its way into my regular rotation."
"This is very drinkable."
"Definitely something I'll be picking up again and again, I just wish I could get it in 6-packs. Delicious and a solid IPA."
"D: I limited myself to one glass. It seems a little to boozy to be enjoyed in multiple servings."
"Notes: Not a DIPA but it is a great IPA leaning on the heavy personality side. IÂ´m making this one a regular on my fridge for this style."
"This tastes great, nice slow start with a citrus tinge and great smooth finish, with a very very late bitter finish. Wonderful tasting beer. Here."
"The color is hazy golden with thousands of suspended particles of yeast adding body to Racer 5. The aroma was citrus, but instead of the usual grapefruit, I got a snoot full of lemon. The taste, more true to form, was grapefruit, but sweet. All those hops and no bitter aftertaste. With all those yeasties hanging around it was almost like drinking a gel, but actually just medium bodied. I'm guessing drinkability is about a 4 because by this time I've been over-self-served. Thank you very muck."
"Nice looking amber pour with a thick finger of head and solid lacing. Smell is caramel malts punctuated by sweet floral hops. Taste is malt driven with a bit of bitterness and some piney hop oils. This taste like it is perhaps past its freshness window, but since there is no bottling date I must assume it is meant to taste this way. Very solid and easy to drink, and actually somewhat tasty, but still it appears faded. Mouthfeel is on the full side of medium bodied and very oily. This one went down pretty easy but lacked the hop profile of a true standout IPA."
"Drink is solid. Not to crazy hoppy like some other IPA's but certainly has a nice kick for a hophead. Easy to enjoy a few of these."
"If you haven't tried Racer 5 and you like IPA's, I encourage you to crack one open. You won't be disappointed. I beleive that this might be the gold standard of American IPA's."
"The gold standard of IPA."
"Slightly hazy deep orange color. Nice white head. Well balanced hops and toasted malt smells, citrusy and herbal. Flavor much the same. Very tangy, earthy hops flavor that is not at all aggressive or bitter. Nice maltiness and medium body. Slight citric sourness towards back of tongue. Nice long pleasant finish fading to soft grassy hops, then biscuity malt. Good lacing. A delicious and well-balanced IPA."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable IPA. Good hop smell and taste without being to bitter or syruppy."
"D - great drinkability, easily could have had 2 or 3 bombers. I would seek this beer out. It's a well done IPA for sure."
"Poured into my pint glass the beer is burnt orange with an inch of off white head. After the head retreats it leaves a coating of lace all around the glass. The aroma is super hoppy. Piney and sour. Hints of sweet fruits as well. The taste is hops and sweet malt. The alcohol seems to come through in the finish. Medium body with moderate to heavy carbonation. Sort of dry and bitting after taste. This is a decent IPA. Nothing out of this world but good."
"Bright orange color, hazy, nice head. Smells like citrus and hops. The taste is hardcore citrus with a nice bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice. This is a pleasure to drink and the price is fair at $10 per sixer or $4.50 for a bomber. This is a fantastic IPA as far as my palate is concerned."
"D-The definative American IPA. Just a well crafted beer and great on tap when you can find it."
"D: it's okay, but I think I'll stick to hop rod rye!"
"Had this on tap. Same as my bottle review, just a wee bit more intense. Great hop flavors, great body, great drinkability. Piney, bitter hops dominate, but on tap more floral hops come through. Very good blend of bittering and aromatic. This beer is pretty damn good. I would recommend this one to any IPA fan. Went great with BBQ Chicken Pizza at Big City in Allston, MA."
"Drinkability is great with this one. Its got everything i love in a beer going on. This is one i will be having again, and again."
"Awesome hop profile and quite refreshing and drinkable. Could drink these almost any time. Pairs great with many different foods, especially spicy. Great American hoppy IPA."
"D- An awesome American IPA; great if you love beers with tons of hops."
"Finishes with sweet malt that quickly gives way to to strong pine resin finish. An extremely well balanced, flavorful Double IPA. Just great with all kinds of food."
"D: Amount of hops makes drinking a couple of these just perfect."
"Pours a decent mid-copper color with some good head and lacing, even if it goes away fairly fast. Nice scent, very hoppy with some nice citrus American hops, and enough malt to keep it from being too ""un-sweet."" Good taste, mostly hops, with some malt thickness if not some malt taste. Goes down well."
"Without a doubt, one of the best IPAs that I've ever tried... I'd love to see Bear Republic in TN soon..."
"Nice refreshing IPA and very well balanced."
"D- drinks well and despite ABV of 7%, you can drink in session"
"Good enough, but lacks the depth and intensity of flavor as other IPAs in this price category. Solid and inoffensive, but a beer I'd be quite content to do without."
"Mouthfeel is pretty well spot-on. Maybe a bit more prickly than I would ask for, but it doesn't do anything to hurt the drinkability. Without any alcohol making its presence known, I know that this would be dangerous if it were regularly available. Good job, Bear Republic."
"M&D- Below medium bodied with light carbonation as well, but it is felt on the mouth. Kind of a slick feel going down. Not sessionable at 7%, but who cares, this is good stuff and a sixer would not be a problem in the course of a day."
"Can't get this beer in Michigan, so I'm kicking myself for not getting more of it when I was recently in Toledo. This is a powerful IPA. Huge bitter hop kick in the pants - relentless. Not balanced, but that's OK. It's all about the hops. Not something I could drink all of the time, but definitely one I'd love to have in my normal rotation. Highly recommended."
"This is one of the best India Pale Ales but i have to say i think it used to be better. Like some of the other beers from this brewer, it is very good but I think they used to be better. Good hops/sweetness balance. Strongish for a single IPA but always great to see on tap on the east coast."
" Get Some!!!"
"D- easy to finish and i wish i had grabbed a bomber. a great example of american IPA. ultra hoppy. check this one out if you havnt had it before or in a while."
"This is my go-to IPA. I can buy this for $1.69 a 12oz single year round. When in Northern California for vacation earlier this month, I bought a half-case of 12oz bottles for $15.99. An exceptional value! Especially compared to Stone and Russian River offerings. I am stingy when giving praise, but this beer garners top scores across the board for me. I like variety, but if this was the only beer I was permitted to drink, I would not be an unhappy camper."
"A great drinkable IPA with lots of flavour, great aromas and good bitterness. A really top notch IPA."
"I could enjoy this all night long. I can't imagine how much better this would be fresh. This is definitely going in my top ten beers. One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Will definitely be seeking this one out again."
"Overall this beer reminds me a lot of the fabulous Stone Ruination IPA. It's a little less complex and more straightforward in its flavor profile, but both beers have a terrific fruity nose and sustained drinkability despite their hoppiness. I'll think of this as Ruination's little brother, which is quite a compliment."
"Very good IPA that has alot of citrus smell and flavor."
"Light/medium bodied, nicely smooth, crisp and refreshing, nicely drinkable. Definitely worth a try for the hop heads out there."
"D: A great IPA that you could drink all day."
"This is a great IPA. That is coming from someone that is not a great fan of the style. Really well balanced. Highly recommended."
"Perhaps one of my favorite IPAs. I regularly get these for home."
"The feel of the beer is a nice crisp taste. A bit sharp at first but not overpowering. Some hoppy aftertaste."
"I am not a huge hophead - or should I say I wasn't before Racer 5. In my mind this is right up there with Pliny."
"D: An excellent American IPA with huge maltload that screams top-shelf and classic American hopping to create a superb brew. The hits just keep on coming from Bear Republic. If you are a hops lover, check out the Hop Rod Rye."
"As far as drinkability goes, it reminds me of a good ""malt liquor"" oddly enough. Doesn't get annoying at all, though keep in mind the hop strength. Overall it's a nice casual IPA, the most session-worthy one I've had thus far."
"Easy and smooth in the mouth, yet exciting and invigorating the taste buds. Everything balances out perfectly in this IPA."
"Great beer."
"D= This is a very cool and refreshing IPA that did not lack any character or complexity. Great on a hot day with any flavorful cuisine."
"The body is moderate to full. Would like a bit less body but does support the huge hop character. Carbonation is light, could use a touch more to help with bitterness. But overall a fantastic example of a west coast ipa."
"Drinkability is fantastic! Big IPA, 7%, tastes great. What else can you honestly ask for. Wish I had year round access to this bad boy."
"D - This was an awesome beer. I'll admit this was pretty complex for me in the beginning. But the more I sipped the more I could realize all of its beautiful complexities. This beer was great!!"
"Nice smooth body with wonderfully understated carbonation. A good beer, fits the style to a T."
"D: Holy crow, this is a strong tasting IPA! At 7% ABV and with a hop profile like this, it'd be tough to session this, but great to have one or two with a meal. I had mine with a light meal of steamed clams and raw oysters."
"Pours slightly cloudy gold with a small to medium persistent head. Nice lacing on the surface and sides of the glass. Smell is fantastic resiny piney hops. Really big aroma of fresh hops. Taste has very pleasant piney citrusy earthy hops from beginning to finish. Nice background sweetness provides some balance. Some bitterness but not as much as some other IPAs. This beer is full bodied and lightly carbonated which suits it well. Very easy to drink would be a (dangerously) good session beer. Overall an excellent IPA."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with a slight prickle from the carbonation. Drinkability is higher than average.. you could put a few of these away without feeling you like you were sucking on a pine cone! Overall - a solid beer and one that I'd have no trouble reaching for again."
" A very nice IPA. Very easy to drink. You don't want to stop sipping. But it gets so much better when it warms, so serve at the proper temperature. Damn, i shouldn't have given the other half of the bomber to my girlfriend. I would like to get a case of this stuff, if it was distributed in Florida."
"J"
"Drinkability? YES YES YES. I've now officially got my buzz on! I really wish I had another."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Despite the higher ABV, this is still highly drinkable. Having this on tap is a real treat and I'll absolutely be drinking this again."
"Drinkability- Great."
"D - The beer shines here - it could easily be made sessionable despite the ABV."
"In all a good beer, but a forceful beer."
"D: A nice combination of mouthfeel and taste made for a very nice drinking beer. A nice, smooth, IPA that was quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability: This is great stuff. Could drink it all day."
"Drinkability? For me, it drinks stronger than the 7%abv it carries and the flavours don't tickle my fancy that much so....it will probably be a while before I revisit this brew."
"The body was solid, which gave the hops something to cling to, a pleasant change from most thin west coast IPAs. A very drinkable beer, especially for an IPA, I recommend this beer, but find Hop Rod far superior."
"Edit: I can and I did. Just an outstanding IPA in a world being driven by DIPA's. Modus, Racer 5, = the best everyday IPA's out there. Sculpin is great but it's seasonal."
"Drinkability: I could see myself having one or two of these in a night. Not a terribly strong beer, and a great tasting IPA that will undoubtedly end up in my crate again."
"could drink this all day long in any weather."
"D: Could pack away a few of these. Goes down without a problem."
"Pretty drinkable, and overall a good beer."
"D= great. This beer wasn't what I expected it to be but its still very nice. I think its somewhat mild and tame but still very good and ill likely have it again."
"Bottom line: I'd never even heard of this brewery, but I try almost anything that is put on a hand pull. Bear Republic delivered with a great IPA though, and one I'll definitely have again if I run into it."
"Drinkability: A versatile beer that can be enjoyed as a stand alone or with a meal."
"D - Full flavored, bitter, and well balanced. A very solid offering I will definitely have to try again."
"Pours clear orange with a dense white head that leaves lots of lacing down the glass. The smell is honeysuckle, grass, citrus, and pine. The taste starts off sweet, moves through some rich malt, on into a long, bitter grapefruit finish that hints at juniper or pine. It's mildly carbonated, rather viscous and thick. Delicious, but a sipper."
"D: Drinking it again reminded me why I thought it was one of the best IPAs I've had."
"Job well done!"
"Pretty good kick at 7%, be careful if you are driving."
"Also, it definitely has inspired me to seek out Racer 10."
"4.0 D: Good beer overall, but doesn't stand out."
"This is a great beer! I wish I could get it in MN, but I guess a drive over to WI isn't too bad."
"Overall-This is a good IPA, I'm not sure it's as knock your socks off as many feel but I can't deny that it's a good beer."
"Drinkability is almost good: I would enjoy it just about any time, but I'd almost always prefer something better."
"golden, pretty translucent. last time i had one there was no head so this time i poured vigorously, getting about a 1.5 finger layer of white fluff. Smells like citrus hops - primarily grapefruit and orange, maybe some pinapple. Citrusy hops dominate the taste too. Bitterness is about optimal - not palate-assaulting, but you know it's an ipa. The sweet, biscuity malt that pairs with the hops really makes for a wonderful balance. or at least as much balance as you would want in an ipa. medium bodied, medium carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Tastes great, very drinkable, yet the bitterness keeps you from guzzling it down. Awesome beer."
"Drinkability: I could happily drink more than one of these. (In fact I've done so at least twice in the last week during happy hour.) I'll most certainly be returning to this beer. It is a full flavored, tasty IPA that has just a enough malt backbone to keep it from becoming boring."
"Overall the only downside was the appearance but besides that this is a great IPA and I would recommend it."
"Pours a nice light cedar color. Silky beige head with perfect lacing. Nose has a bouquet of floral and fruity malts over caramel malts. Taste has nice citrus and piney hops over bready malts. Well balanced ale. Nice medium body has a crisp carbonation and lingering bitter finish."
"Drinkability would only be hindered by the fact that every time I drink this I would need a glass. This is a bottle conditioned beer and thus it has some yeast leftovers in the bottle that I prefer to drink. You can't have this while you are mowing the lawn....but I could have quite a few after."
"With all of that bitterness, you'd almost think you'd have to pace yourself. Not the case. This goes down very easy. One of my favorite IPAs. No funky flavors, and great balance. Try it."
"taste is refreshing, grapefruit, touch of caramel, some pine, citrus, very bitter, and sweet malt, end is bitter."
"D-I could easily down a 6 pack, will definitely buy this one again."
"It's still in the fridge and I haven't had one since a visit to Yardhouse San Diego months ago, but I will tell you it satisfies everything you need if you love hop slanted monster IPAs."
"Translucent orange complexion with a quickly dissipating head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma is a bouquet of citric hops. Tangerine, orange, grapefruit. Classic. Taste follows the nose, hops persistent throughout. A gentle tingling carbonation and a soft, oily feel. Dry finish. A classic west coast IPA."
"D: Definitely a drinker. Lighter body adds to the drinkability while the fresh citrus flavor makes you want to drink more. A great beer all around and one I'll be visiting again soon."
"this is one of my favorite IPA's. huge bold flavors but not too huge. i love this."
"Overall this is just a great IPA. Nothing but great things from start to finish. It may seem expensive at $10 a six but it's worth it every time."
"Hazy translucent golden amber that gets a nice deep orange color in the middle of the glass. Nice solid dense head, leaving a thick chunk of lace at the top, but not really much more as it works its way down the glass. Nice color. Aroma has some fruit candy-like sweetness. Complex hop aroma, but not potent - citrus with a little grassy earthiness that comes out more when you swirl it. A little biscuity malt, but sweet-smelling. Nice balance, not a puckering bitterness, but not syrupy sweet, but the hops still get to shine. A touch of white pepper spiciness, with grassy, citrus hops that lean toward sugar dusted grapefruit flavors. I'm pretty sure there are definitely some Amarillo in there. Malt is sweet caramel that never gets in the way of the hop show. Finishes with some bitterness, but right in the middle of the dry-sweet spectrum. Perfect amount of carbonation and not too syrupy or bitter to enjoy on a summer day."
"A very nice beer. Not surprising from BR."
"T: What an IPA. Quite possibly the best in America. At least, the best that I have access to."
"Mouthfeel was medium-bodied. Drinkability is great as this beer has a very clean flavor and it is not harsh at all. The alcohol is not present at all."
"Prost!"
"While this may not be the most complex ipa, it still a great straight to the point one and true to the style. Sometimes the simpler the better. Delicious!"
"Overall a great beer that's packed with flavor and balanced by the slight sweetness, not letting that 7% ABV hit you until then end of the bottle. Each sip got better and brought out more flavor. A great beer on its own or mixed with food, this slides down easy like a fine beer should. A great beer that is steady, always enjoyable, complex and full of flavor; a top notch IPA that is one of the standards for any hophead."
"D - Wow, this one knocked my socks off. What a great available IPA. Perfect bitterness and citrus matched with quite a bit of maltiness."
"Drinkability - A perfect session beer for a warm summer day in my opinion. Pretty good ABV and a smooth flavor make for a good combination. Will look forward to having this one again."
"Nikki"
"D= Bear Republic states that they do everything, huge. And thus they have. However, expect a 6-pack of 12oz bottles to cost you about US$2 more than most other micro's. Worth the treat."
"Not bad but it would probably be better fresh. Again, it's a case of me not reading the bottling date before buying. Still a decent IPA though."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass at 47 degrees. 2.25.09 indicated on the bottle. Poured a translucent copper with a half inch bright white head consisting of a layer of tiny, compressed bubbles. Head eventually settles into a thin, fairly consistent cap. Delicate waves of lacing were revealed during the course of the tasting. Nose consists predominantly of grapefruit notes with some light, floral aromas. Taste follows nose, but a nice malt/hops balance comes out in the mouth - some sweetness up front, with a light kiss of hops bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied and mildly effervescent. A tasty IPA with a well-hidden abv; however, somewhat lacking in the crispness I've come to associate with the style."
"D-This is a very drinkable beer. Big flavor without the big ABV. My ""go to"" IPA, session brew, cooler filler. There are better IPA's out there, but none so drinkable as this."
"This is a great example of a flat out quality IPA."
"D: Very drinkable. Lots of flavor, but great balance. Disguises the abv well."
"D - A nice west coast IPA that is balanced unlike a lot of the strong IPA and DIPA offerings from the left coast. A great beer that I would drink again."
"Pours white head that dissipates very quickly, amazingly clear light amber color. Nice bold hop smell. Strong but controlled bitterness, then easy malt flavors followed by the pine/citrus bitterness that lingers in your mouth with a touch of sweetness. Mouth feel is good, if the bitterness wasn't keeping it under control you could say it's slightly syrupy. Carbonation is perfect."
"A very good IPA which I highly recommend. One of the best."
"Drinkability: Strong finish, but inherently and unabashedly smooth."
"Feels great on the mouth, smooth and slightly sticky. Great drinkability."
"Rigorous pour revealed a light orange colored ale with some mild particulates. Head was bubbly but thin, off-white in color, and had good retention with decent lacing on the glass. Aroma was terrific - hop presence of pine and citrus, with hints of caramel malt. Tastes were mild caramel malt followed with strong earthy pine and citrus. Seemed to lack complexity, but is well balanced with a bitter, lingering hop finish. Hop resins coat the mouth well, especially towards the end of the ale as it warms. Overall, very good example of the style, but again for some reason I'm not crazy over it."
"As IPAs go, gritty is a good word for Racer 5, which feels like a dingy, dark dive bar on a chilly and rainy spring day."
"D- Very drinkable. This is a great American I.P.A. This is is my favorite stlye so I'm a little biased but the great crisp, refreshing, piny taste is there. Pour me another please!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Has a pleasant light copper/gold color and a 1/4 to 1/2 inch white head that does fade rather quickly, leaving decent lacing on the glass. Smells piny and hoppy (which I like). Has a very nice combination of bitter hops on the palate and maltiness. The two balance each other nicely; this is not an over-the-top Hop Bomb. Mouthfeel is also pleasant, and this drinks very smoothly. Very easy to like, and at the moment, this is my favorite California IPA next to the Ballast Point Sculpin... it's wonderfully balanced and very drinkable. I found it for $2.99 for 22 oz, which ain't too bad. Solid."
"D = This is a very good IPA. I always expect anything from the west coast to be a completely unbalanced hop bomb, but that wasn't the case with Racer 5. If it wasn't so damned expensive, this would be in my regular rotation."
"The color is golden with a good head that falls apart quickly. It smells very sticky, piny, citrusy, all things hoppy. Tastes bitter with hardly any malt character. Mouthfeel is good, just enough body. Drinkability is good. I would have this again and again, one of the best IPA's I've tried."
"I'm not too familiar with the style, but this is obviously a quality IPA. I could go for a glass or two every now and then."
"D- Nice IPA to get someone into the style. The hops are very much present but not dominating."
"D: Ask for another! This is one terrific IPA, and I can't wait to get out to CA to try more of Bear Republic's brews."
"D: All night long!"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a big tan head. Smell is of toasted sugar and citrus. Taste has a sturdy malt backbone with a ton of caramel and biscuit in the flavor. A nice pine flavor finishes the beer nicely, as well as a hint of citrus peel. Bitterness levels match up with the malt nicely. Mouthfeel is super creamy, very nice carbonation. Bottle Conditioned. Quite drinkable, a good IPA that I plan to drink again."
"I could drink this beer all night, hides the abv well, excellent beer."
"I would drink this beer over and over, a great American IPA"
"Overall: I'll not tell you that this is the best IPA I every had but it's in my top ten."
"Future outlook: Very good. I'd be happy to have this again."
"Rereview. Changed from a 3.3 B-"
"I could definitely drink a bunch of these in a sitting when it comes to flavor, probably a very nice summer time ipa, refreshing. nothing crazy going on but a solid, drinkable ipa. I'd pick up a six for a hot day but nothing that floored me, even for a regular ipa."
"A great beer that can meet my hop demands and it is easily available.Along with SNPA, this has been my old standby for years when out at local restaurants and/or pubs with limited beer menus."
"D - This is a beer to sit down and savor. Enjoy one or two, but it got a bit tiring as I drank more. This is called an IPA, but felt like a DIPA to me and because of that it is only so drinkable even though it is quite good."
"poured from tap into an imperial pint glass. appears a golden orange with a very nice looking thick white head that slowly dissipates, but leaves beautiful webs of sticky, crystaline lacing. smells as advertised, floral hops, herbs (particularly oregano), some grassy notes, slight citrus sweetness. taste follows smell, though it is VERY herbal tasting when it warms; almost in a medicinal way.i have drank this beer several times, and cold and room temp glasses make a big difference here. i think i'd opt for the cold normally, but its just a nitpick. has nice lively hops, some citrus notes, with the alcohol barely noticed. the mouthfeel is medium bodied, not overly carbonated but has a nice zip going on. tasty bitter finish. fairly drinkable. a very interesting and bold (though not traditional) ipa. recommended."
"Very drinkable. Just have to be careful of the 7 percent abv that is barley noticeable."
"Drinkability is amazingly good, the abv 7% is present only in the mind not on the tongue."
"D - Wow, this goes down easy. I could drink a few of these."
"2 finger lingering white head with nice lacing over slightly opaque amber orange body. Hops are pretty noticeable in the nose but not overwhelming. Spicy hops on the back end of taste balanced by sweetish malt up front. A nice example of NoCal IPA, though my preference runs towards Racer X in terms of complexity and taste. Maybe it's a carbonation issue related to the bottle conditioning, but I'm not having any problems with the yeast. Worth a shot, though definitely better on tap and superlative on cask at the Horse Brass"
"Overall, definitely not on par with some of Bear's other offerings, though I am willing to grant it some slack because of the age of the bottle and because it's still a very drinkable brew."
"This one is a medium yellow with a quarter inch of white head. Plenty of lacing on the glass. Smells of grapefruit with some orange thrown in. Solid citrus aroma. Tastes of grapefruit, orange, and some other fruity hints in there. Finishes with a medium bitter aftertaste, but not overwhelming. A good solid IPA, very drinkable. Glad I tried this one at Papago."
"Not that impressed with this one. Decent IPA."
"This is a great beer from C02, kick that up a notch with the cask conditioning. Simply superb. What a west coast treat that we are lucky to have here in PA. Thanks to Jeff at TJs for bringing in this gem for us to try."
"The first thing that attracted me to this beer was the graphics on the tap. A tribute to Speed Racer no doubt. So naturally I ordered a pint and enjoyed the light amber color and the distinct citrus smell. When you taste it you get grapefruit but it is not overly tart or fruity. This has become one of my favorites and I always have it on hand. Everyone I have sampled it with has become a fan as well."
"Overall, this is an EXCELLENT IPA, would get this one again, and for $5 and some change a pretty good deal also."
"D: For such a big, hoppy IPA, this manages an impressive balance. A nice malt backbone along with some unique hop flavors makes this a very nice beer indeed."
"All the while, its still a beer that many enjoy and I agree that it is a well crafted beer. I have my first Hop Rod Rye in the fridge and look forward to trying it soon and I hope it surpasses the Racer. If you are an IPA lover, you do want to get your hands on this. If not, there are better beers out there."
"D: A really good IPA offering. Although a 7% abv, worth having more than one in a sitting!"
"D: A pretty solid IPA. Not the best I've had and definitely not a bad one. I tried this after the Hop Rod Rye, which really overshadows this beer. It is worth a try, but there are some others I would drink on a daily basis before this one."
"- Very drinkable... somewhat bubbly and filling.. but a great strengthy basic IPA. Would buy again.. but there are others that come before it."
"Truly exceptional. Get some!"
"D - Definitely a full flavor brew. 7% ABV gives it some kick. I could drink a couple of these....at least!"
"Verdict: 8/10. You can find this in many bars in San Diego, so I often recommend it to my friends. It's only a $4 bomber (insane for a bottle-conditioned beer). Reserve a little in the bottle, and drink it separately. Yeast is good for you"
"D - This is a drinkable beer. The first time I had it, I didn't like it, but it's been a while and I've grown as a beer drinker. This is a fine example of a good west coast IPA. Lots of piney hops in the nose and they come through on the taste as well."
"A: A coppery gold with a hint of pink, light and frothy head, lots of resiny foam on the glass - 4.50, S: Fragrant citrus and bubblegum, some tropical fruits - 4.50, T: Pine sap, extremely bitter, faint flavors that remind me of a barrel aged beer, malt plays second fiddle to the hops - 4.25, M: Silky - 4.00, D: This has been one of my go to IPAs for a while, very West Coast style of IPA, loads of hops, very drinkable in my opinion - 4.50"
"very recommended. i really scored on my brew hauls this past weekend. can't wait to try the rye hop rod from Bear Republic"
"This is a great IPA. Excellent taste and drinkability. Tons of hops, but still some balance. Between an IPA and DIPA in strength. My first beer from Bear Republic and it's fantastic."
"Has the taste to match, full hop taste, nice bite. Has that crisp smooth mouthfeel you want in an IPA. Not a super hopy IPA, just a clean and well made one. This is super drinkible, nice and chilled these go down great. Will want to keep these in my fridge on a regular basis."
"good drinkability."
"Extremely drinkable. Very tasty, and not too heavy."
"A pretty solid IPA that doesn't push the envelope of sweetness or bitterness. I could drink a few of these on cask."
"D - One of my favorite IPAs out there. And how do you make an incredible beer even better? Cask condition, of course! Simply an excellent West Coast IPA."
"Oooh...thick malty IPAs, I f*ckin love them. The sticky, sappy, wood; hint of caramel, creme brulee scorched sugar ceiling, spicy toffee building a supportive foundation for the hops that hop out the glass. The head rests for a while then slips out the back door, leaving a thick ring of residual sucre lacing. The aroma is so inviting, fresh damp greens and cinnamon bread pudding. The ending bitterness is refreshing and lingers way after the pint is set down. These are the IPAs I crave, the malty backbone IPAs dominate the realm. Hail the perfect relationship of tough malt and aggresive hops."
"Golden amber hue with large frothy head. A nice aroma of pine, hops, and some citrus. A tad thick in mouthfeel, tastes of hops, pine notes, alcohol, and some tang in the finish. A very good IPA that holds down the fort against the competition. My first Bear Republic but definitely not my last."
"D - very enjoyable and very nice IPA. Wish I didn't have to go trading for this one. It's what drinking an IPA should be."
"A little over one finger of light tan head grows to the rim, stabilizes for a few seconds, and then slowly fades, leaving a spotted lace all around the glass. Has the color of aged brass. Smells of oily hops, citrus rinds, and sweetened grapefruit. The hops linger on the palate for a while, before some bitter sweet malts and oranges shine through, balancing everything out. Mouth-feel is medium, and it goes down in a sinewy wave that begs the throat for more. This is a well-rounded, tasty and quite drinkable IPA that truly lives up to it' billing as a top tier IPA."
"A brief sniff of this elixir is like plunging your head into a box of oranges and lemons. There is the faint odor of a few grapefruits down at the bottom. When you pull your head back you can sense the delicate odors of fresh cut wildflowers. The warm amber liquid, accented by a slight haze, is asking, no, screaming for you to take a taste. As the tender bubbles of carbonation play across your palate you are again reminded of fresh citrus fruits. Then a warmth passes across your tongue, like being curled up in a velvet blanket. This is followed by a tangy, pungent finish that completes the experience and invites you into the next. There will be no speed racing through this pint."
"I like this one."
"D: Extremely drinkable & smooth. I was expecting more bitterness for an IPA, but still very good."
"The dry finish, massive hop character and whimsical malts make for a spectacular combination - an amazing offering and one of my favorite IPAs."
"The taste is good, again with the hops, man it sure does make its presence felt. Hops hops hops. But not over-powering at all. Each sip refreshes the hop vigor but never gets annoying. I would drink another bomber if I had it around. I'm going to buy this one again, this time in the new six-packs my local store started carrying so I can drink this more often."
"On-tap at Woody's City Market, it's great to see an established sports bar really step-up their draft selection. Served in a standard pint glass a crisp dark yellow with a thin lasting head that left great lacing. Aroma was a great citrus hop bouquet with some sweet malts. The taste was a great balance with citrus hops just overpowering sweet malts lasting with a great bitter finish. The beer was medium bodied but still crisp and refreshing. I've always enjoyed this beer, and it certainly proves to be just as good if not even better on draft."
"Poured a beautiful golden/amber, slightly turbid, with a white head. Aroma was easily discernible, but not overpowering. Nice citrus in the form of grapefruit and orange dominated with pine and honey present as well. Taste was sweater than I expected. Initial flavor on the tongue was ample sweetness of grapefruit and honey, giving way to a strong piney/earthy bitterness, which lingered a bit. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall, I really enjoyed this IPA. With the exception of a minor lingering of bitterness, the taste of this IPA was a very pleasant surprise, which continued to impress me to the last drop. Light and refreshing, I could definitely have several."
"Poured from a bomber, had a golden straw color with an impressive head, about 3 fingers, & great ""map of the world"" lacing. Smell was pretty standard IPA: piney, citric, my wife smelled some pineapple. The taste was all that good stuff PLUS a toasty sweetness up front that stood out like a diamond in the rough, didn't have that bite that most IPAs do. Mouthfeel was nice & creamy, like a cask almost (might've kept the bottle a little long before drinking, but definitely to the beer's benefit), definitely softer than your typical IPA. Good & drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is a tasty beer, I would have maybe two in a night. There is a lot going on when drinking this. Would I buy it again? Maybe. This beer is labeled as I.P.A. but it does not taste like a standard I.P.A.. So if I was looking for an I.P.A., no. But it is a good brew."
"Drinkability: Not as aggressively hopped as IPAs I'm accustomed to, but not a bad example of the style. Unique. I will enjoy this brand again."
"D: Very drinkable, almost sessionable. Nothing outstanding about it, but a unique IPA that I will drink again. Good availability in my area."
"Huge hop nose but with a malt backbone. Tasted hops front middle and finish but was still balanced and driankable. Hoppy but not bitter. I could drink multiple of these."
"Excellent and will have many times again."
"Taste is a biitter hop with a decent little malt that lets the hop overpower a bit. Mouthfeel is very nice for a nice drinking higher end ABV IPA. Will never pass up another one of these."
"Pours an amber clear yellow colored body, with a big foamy head w/good lacing. Has a hoppy aroma, sweet, almost grapefruity, citrusy. Has a sour sweet taste, a little too bitter, but the aftertaste is clean. Pretty good for a West Coast IPA."
"D: extremely drinkable IPA, top notch in my opinion."
"There is not a lot of carbonation and the alcohol is hidden very well. This was a very easily drinkable IPA. I have my girlfriend to thank for this one."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0901-Larry"
"Incredible on draft. Plus six packs are now available in my area for the low price of $10. This will be a staple in my fridge."
"D-This was not what I expected for an IPA.I could get hooked on these but bet that supply will be limited in my area."
"I had this on tap. As an IPA it is a little less hoppy than perhaps I've gotten accustomed to. The beer was a pretty bright gold color shading to amber, clear with a creamy off white head that definitely carried the hop aroma. I don't know what hop accomplished this feat but it tasted of tangerines. I hear there is an experimental hop that is supposed to do this and I doubt that is in this beer but something combined to make a distinctive tangerine flavor. It's an unusual thing to notice in an IPA, and sooo tasty. I detected quite a bit of malty sweetness from an IPA. It was highly drinkable, would love this every day in summer!"
"I think I enjoy this beer in the 12 Oz bottle over the Bomber. Regardless...its good."
"D- this is a really nice IPA. Very well balanced and it is reasonably priced and very drinkable. I could easily drink this beer any time during any season."
"Wow, this beer would be in my top five if the malt were bigger and balanced the huge hop hit more. Even more so, as the malt character that comes through is very good."
"lighter carbonation and not so much of a hop bite - drank it like water against blind tiger's 7 pepper chili -"
"Overall, this is a nice IPA. It's got some good floral hoppiness, and decent intensity. It's just lacking a back end, and that extra something that sets the great ones apart. Still, a very solid bev. I've always thought of it as a reliably good beer, and this has done nothing to dissuade that opinion."
"D: Pretty sessionable, alcohol is well hidden. I just wish there was more flavor...but the combination makes this very drinkable"
"Website says they are using Columbus and Cascade, but this tastes far sweeter and less dank than what I would expect from that combo. The bitterness isn't huge, and the malt bill is basic, but it's still very tasty and is one of the more interesting IPAs I've tasted."
"all in all still an anjoyable enough ipa, but there are a good many i would choose before it."
"d: I wasn't in the mood for a DIPA and I think this borders on one. Just a little too sweet for my taste."
"D: The nice balance makes this one very drinkable. This is a great example of an IPA."
"Overall: Absolutely awesome IPA. Well balanced such that non-hopheads will enjoy it."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle..Pours a clear golden-orange color with a head greater than one inch which is very frothy and white. Aroma is very strong of bitter Columbus hops and very light notes of citrus but barely detectable. The beer has a very smooth flavor containing a great citrus and grass hops flavor which meshes well with the light sweet malty flavor. The beer leaves an awesome lacing on the glass and has great carbonation which really brings the aroma to the nose. After the flavor has been lingering in your mouth after a sip, it starts to taste a bit salty. Overall a fantastic IPA for the price and a very well balanced beer."
"**Of note, I had out of a bottle a year later, and it was not quite as good as before...but still very nice. So I will keep the grade."
"Just an amazing beer. Smells of citrus, cascade/centennial hops. Wonderful hoppy smell, but that fruit background isn't lost. The taste is wonderful. Delicious hop flavor without losing any of that citrus background. I think we were all shocked by it's amazing balance and bold flavors. I think the long-awaited taste of Bear Republic was well worth it, as that first sip proved how great of a beer they can make. This is one of those few brews that I think other breweries should follow as a model as a terrific example of the style."
"A standout beer."
"D- Easy to quickly enjoy a 22oz bottle"
"Poured this into a wine glass that I use for most of my beer tasting so I can get my nose in it and swirl it a little. I just finished a Three Floyds Alpha King so I could get a good comparison. The head was about medium, off white and seemed to quickly disappear. The color is on the golden side, as opposed to amber or otherwise. The smeill is grapefruit with some solid bitterness at the back. It tastes like it smells except the sweetness of the malt prevents that bittier aftertaste. This is one of the best IPA's I have tasted that has that malt on the back. A lot of IPA's (Harpoon, Decadent) over do that sweetness for my palette. I would buy this again, but this a once and a while beer. For the price I'm better off some of the better IPA six packs."
"Purchase in 22oz bottle in a liquor store in Chicago. Not used to seeing too many CA beers in these parts. A dark golden IPA with a medium white head. Nothing to wrong with this IPA. On the flipside, nothing to distinguish itself.Smells of plenty of hops. A very balanced beer. Enough malty sweetness to match big hops and kick."
"Glad I bought this again. The 1st bomber I had did not taste good at all. At only $6 a bomber I figured why not? Nice amber color with a one finger head. Smelled mostly grapefruit which was fine with me. Very balanced brew but you can certainly taste and smell the hops throughout. Left a nice lacing on the glass. I liked it alot and will be buying again. Recommended."
"Drinkability. A drinkable offering for sure. It goes down smooth and is a delightful IPA. Perhaps the best American IPA I've had to date. Next time I'll pick up a six pack."
"D: A very very nice IPA, very drinkable. I could drink 3 or 4 of these for sure!"
"Drinkability - Surprisingly easy to drink. I could drink this throughout the evening without wanting a change of pace."
"This is great stuff and one of my favorite ""regular"" IPAs."
"Nice IPA, good price too. Got this one for $6 I think? Not bad at all, worth a try at the least."
"Semi-foggy amber orange color, few visible bubbles, thick appearance with a dense foam which does not want to call it a night any time soon. Sweet nose of white pit fruit and orange to lemon citrus, feels juicy, dewy flower petals, beeswax, manages to stay sweet given its hoppiness, not the longest finish, tactfully concise. Medium-bodied, noticeably foamy as you start to sip, grapefruit, orange citrus upfront, less floral but perhaps more piney and waxy. The hoppiness bolder here in the mouth, brings a mild astringency to the finish. Tries to achieve a lot, at both ends of the sweet/dry spectrum, and mostly pulls it off."
"Recommend."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. A very nice American IPA. One of my favorites."
"D - This IPA was really good, but in the way of Bear Republic beers, I would defiantly pick up the Rye over this, however, when I am craving a good IPA, this would be a great answer"
"Grabbed a 650 mL bottle for a great deal (1/2 off) at Callandro's the other day, and it's pretty solid for an IPA. The beer was a burnt orange color and had a 2 finger head with decent lacing. The beer smells of piney hops and a bit of citrus. Hops dominate the taste, but it is lacking on something to counterbalance the hops. This beer is more bitter than some of the double IPAs that I have had (not that it's a bad thing, just that there could be more for the style). The thickness of the beer is just about perfect, but it is overcarbonated. Less carbonation would allow me to enjoy the flavor more. The beer is a solid IPA, and definitely worth the cost at the sale price."
"If the alcohol taste wasn't as big this beer would be more drinkable, but it wouldn't be as good if you ask me. I rate drinkability based on can you session the thinkg pared with the criteria for the style. For example, I could just about session some Chimay Blue or some Kwak even though they are relatively large beers. This one almost gets it, but the alcohol finish makes this just shy of sessionable, though by all means a fantastic IPA. Bought to go eat some salmon with this brew. Here I go...mmph... delicious. Would definately reccomend this brew with some seafood. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability- So much hops that anything lighter in hops will taste like water if drank during the same session. A very strong and enjoyable IPA. Not many better ones out there."
"2nd tasting, 3/3/13 - Madeleine malts, lots of peach/apricot fruit, a good dose of citrus, and real aspirin/IBU finish. Still one of the best."
"Bomber bottle. Pours a slightly hazy amber-orange with a tight, thick off-white head. The Columbus aromatic hops come through nicely, but a bit restrained, resulting in a fragrant pine needle and spice nose with just a touch of citrus. Mouthfeel was creamy and full with a subdued carbonation level. Initial flavor was a well balanced presentation of orange, grapefruit, sweet caramel and faint background of Juicy Fruit chewing gum. Late palate to finish is moderately bittersweet, but a bit short and syrupy. Overall a fairly solid IPA and worth a visit, but not all that outstanding"
"Conclusion: A nice, earthy, raw (in a good way) West Coast IPA."
"Drinkability: Yes. This is one of my favorite IPA's. A fine session beer if there ever was one. Will recommend to all."
"Highly recommended for anyone with a huge hop pallet."
"D - I hat to say it, but this is almost too hoppy in that it's pretty one dimensional and isn't supported by a big malty base like a DIPA. Fortunately, the one dimension shown here is done extremely well. This would be the perfect beer to give to someone who asks ""what do hops taste like."" Boom, here ya go... this is exactly what hops taste like."
"Cloudy orange, nice thin lacing. Impressive clumps of stickage all the way down the glass. Pine sap, mint, and citrus aroma's. The nose is all about the hops here, with nary a hint of cracker maltiness. Crisp mouthfeel, with lively carbonation. Hops attack and scour the tongue, with and array of citrus and pine resins. This is a hopheads dream. No hint of 7 % abv. Dangerously drinkable. So happy to finally see this available here in NC. This immediatly goes into the regular rotation along with Foothills, Founders, and Stone as a killer hop fix. Great stuff."
"this beer may be my favorite ipa of all time."
"The aroma is citrus followed by malt. The flavor starts bitter, reminiscent of lemon zest. The middle is sweet malt and it finishes bitter but not dry with sweet flavors as an aftertaste. The mouth feel is dense with good head and a medium body, denser than the color suggests. My overall impression is that this beer is well crafted to excel in the cask beyond what it does in the bottle, and I feel privileged to have gotten a taste from cask."
"Had this on tap at the Capital Ale House in Fredericksburg, VA. This was an excellent IPA. The aroma was of pine and citrus with slight malt nose. The taste was hops foward with a malt backbone providing a nice support. Slight toasted grain shows through the hops. This was a medium mouthfeel with very good drinkability. I will definitely buy/order again as it was a very nice example of the style."
"Poured a a golden orange color with a nice 1.5 finger head that stuck around for a while, decent lacing, Smelled like grapefruit, orange. Tasted awesome, less grapefruit then in the smell but still there, had a piny aftertaste. Medium bodied with a nice oily/creamy feel. Very drinkable beer @ 7%"
"The drink is medium-bodied with nice carbonation, and is a succulent, poundable IPA. More great stuff from Bear Republic!"
"I am not a fan of ipas but this one hits it perfect. It is not a hop bomb like some other ipas."
"Beautiful orange pour with a solid pure white head. Citrus fruit in the head, mainly oranges with a tangerine back. Huge orange and grapefruit aroma makes one feel like they are standing in a fruit grove. Very well balanced and one of my favorite IPAs."
"one of the best beers i have had on tap at home."
"This is my favorite beer,so far. The hoppy sweet smell is intoxicating, and 7.00 ABV dosen't hurt. I really can't say anything bad about this beer. I have been drinking every weekend rof the last three weeks. The number spaek louder than I do....A great beer!"
"A decent ipa, not really as big as I was expecting it to be but very serviceable."
"D-Wow! Racer 5 out of the bottle ROCKS! I am impressed with the hop pop and smooth biscuity sweetness. A surprising amount of flavour for a beer that has been left in the bottle for months. A bomber of this was easy to finish off."
"Mouthfeel is medium, and drinkability is awesome."
"This beer has your typical color and head. All round great beer. Too bad this does not come in a 24 pack as I would definitely rate it above most IPAs in the market today."
"D - Several more of these would be appreciated."
"a must try for anyone who likes hops"
"This went great with my pulled pork plate, and I could have easily drank it all night, but alas I had to move on."
"Not as good as I thought it would be. I purchased this one at Jungle Jim's in Fairfield, Ohio unrefrigerated. As it does not have a freshness date, I may have purchased an old six-pack. This well worth trying if it is in your area. The 7.0 ABV may keep this one from being sessionable."
"D- Quite drinkable. A very balanced IPA, but at the same time quite satisfying for any respectable hophead."
"Quaffable, would definitely down 3-4 of these if work didn't demand my presence tomorrow."
"Great orange color on the pour, good foamy head and the aromas during the pour are fantasticly pleasing."
"(rated Jun 11, 2007)"
"D - This is a very easy to drink IPA another solid beer from Bear Republic that I can't say anything bad about"
"A very good IPA, glad it was recomended to me."
"On the palate, it comes across with a little bitterness right off the bat. Some heaviness comes in body and flavoring in the form of apricot, as mentioned above. A really smooth finish to end, with a ton of orange and grapefruit."
"Plain yellow color with some bubbles. Sweet grapefruit smell. Tastes like straight up hops. What make this beer exceptional is even though it has way too many hops it is not over the top. It is just a great example of a floral and bitter hoppy bear nothing more nothing less. What keeps it normal and drinkable?"
"Hell yes...this is and always will be one of my favorite californian beers. If anyone ever comes to Lake Tahoe, you must have it on tap at the wonderful locals pub The Divided Sky. Pours a beautiful light color with smells of floral hops, a little pine and a light yeast effervescence. Tastes like an american IPA should, hoppy but not overkill with no noticable booze flavor and a good bitter finish."
"Orange-gold out of the bottle with a big, fluffy head. Aroma of grapefruit hops and fresh-cut pine trees. Smooth hop taste that is tempered by the malt without drowning it. More of a bittersweet West Coast IPA than a pucker bomb. Its toned-down but still has a strong hop flavor. A nice change of pace for hopheads."
"7/4/8/4/16 (3.9/5)"
"Pours a golden orange with an amazing, soapy head that dies slowly in bunches and leaves lace all over the mug. A very large citric burst in the aroma along with hints of dry malts. While it has a huge hop burn for the taste and finishes dry, it is mostly a smooth and citric flavored beer that does dry the tongue a little as it leaves its mark (not that this is a bad thing). Didn't really taste any malts but there must be some in there because this beer's body had a subdued creaminess to it. ABV hidden well and no alcohol burn; I could have another draft of this any day of the week."
"Drinkability: Not too bitter, very sweet. All around a very pleasant drinking experience. I'll definitely try it again. I could drink this beer til it comes out my nose (in a good way)."
"Drinkability: Very nice IPA. Will drink it again if I can find it!"
"Pours a slightly hazy pale copper colour, with a few fingers of thick puffy white head, that persists for a good while, slowly leaving a solid ring of lace around the glass. The smell is big grapefruit citrus hops, with a little bit of pine in there too. I'm not getting much in the way of specific malt, other than a general sweetness mixed in with the hop essence. The flavour is a large smack of citrus and pine hops at the front, which are quite astringent. They carry through right to the finish, dancing the watusi on my tastebuds. The malt body is there, but I only detect it in the mouthfeel, which is actually quite full, with a moderate carbonation. Any warming from the elevated alcohol is hard to discern: I'm all warm and fuzzy from a hop coma. This is indeed tasty, and obviously unbalanced at first due to all its bitter goodness. But as it warmed and I became accustomed to the bitterness, the sweet malt finish became much more evident. This slow to arrive balance would make for a decent drinkability, once suitably primed."
"The beer is tan with a small head, but pretty damn good retention. There is a small head during the entire beer, with great lacing. The nose on the beer is sweet and hoppy, and pretty balance. Mostly a fruity aroma from the malts and yeast though. It was different than I expected. When taking a drink the beer hits you with a large amount of hop flavour and bitterness. A bit of alcohol comes through with the hops as well, which is okay. Behind the huge amount of hops comes a slightly fruity flavour, but it's hidden by the slight watery mouthfeel. The beer is pretty god damn drinkable!"
"Drinkability: A very nice IPA. Very distinct. However, that being said . . . I don't know if I would be down to drink more than one at a sitting. The citrus tends to blow me away. I don't think I'm man enough to sit through another wave."
"Notes from 10/20/04"
"West Coast!!!"
"D: Very, wonderful beer."
"It's good, but not a favorite."
"I found this to be very drinkable and could definitely have more than one (my girlfriend thought so too ... good, maybe I can get her to drink more beer this way). I wouldn't go as far as to say this is a session beer because it is 7% abv, but I wouldn't mind having this one all night long."
"Medium bodied and medium to full flavored beer. Very drinkable and worth trying!"
"Pop this one open and let it sit in the bottle for a good 10-15 minutes before serving this one - and you'll have one of the better IPAs you've ever had."
"D - Very nice. Hop aroma is slightly betrayed by the aroma. I was expecting more hops. Tastes more like an English pale ale than a California pale ale."
"pours a solid IPA look. amber clear with a slightly off white head. thick head that taste really delicious upon first sip. sort of leaves the rest at a stand still. when dissipated. nose is that quintessential IPA citrus candy. similar to the marsala mama... great body but i am left wishing for the body in the first pour. taste is pine, particularly grapefruit and pineapple blend. orange mandarin... nice. well rounded. with a great malt backbone. a good session IPA. not as sweet as some."
"Drinkability. So refresing I really like drinking these IPA's like this one."
"Clear pale amber with a very low head thatâs gone in a flash. Interestingly, a completely covering lace is there and hangs out for a long time. Smells like it's going to taste like cascades. Oh. Well, interesting. Crisp, bitter at the end (in a throat clearing kind of way), lingering citrus peel aftertaste. Not so dry or bitter as, say, a Pliny. And, golly, itâs a good thing. This is an IPA. Hello! Anyway, Iâm not thrilled with the after taste (makes my mouth water â and thatâs not a good thing in this case). As an IPA, Iâd say it would be better with more rounded hops to it â a little less of the citrus and a little less bitter at the end. Of course, Iâd probably not change this recipe and make it more of my perfect IPA â Iâd change it to make it a better beer. So Iâd up the body and take the alcohol up about a degree. Not changing the current hops, the alcohol and body would probably make this into an excellent old aleâ¦"
"D: As I mentioned, this has been a bridge for me in the beer world. I was lucky enough to have my first pint of Racer 5 at the Moan & Dove in 2004... It, along with stone and DFH, carried my journey into the wonderful world of IPA's... so yes, this review may stink of sweaty sentiment... but there is no denying the quality of this beer. A fantastic west coast IPA!!!"
"Overall, this was a very, very good IPA and another good beer by Bear Republic."
"D: This is a great IPA to have around. I tend to prefer the bottle conditioned IPA's (2H Ale, Bridgeport, et al), so I will add a few more bottles of this to my beer cabinet. Actually, the similarities between Bell's 2 Hearted Ale and Racer 5 are striking, both even have numbers in their name...hmmmm"
"Well done. I loved it. This beer is right up my alley and I can't wait to get some more."
"D: Very tasty IPA. Doesn't do much to separate itself from the multitude similarly delicious IPAs, but it is a quality beer. Hope the rumors are true about these guys coming back to the Colorado market, this beer would do very well here."
"Overall - Wow! One of the best well balanced IPA's I've ever had."
"This is a pretty stand up IPA. I had the pleasure of having this at the Common Market here in Charlotte NC. Very typical IPA appearance. This beer uses a Columbus hops which is a new hybrid hop that typically would only add bittering aromatics but this also ads some taste. The smell is obviously hoppy with a little citrus zip in it. It isn't overwhelmingly hoppy like a lot of IPAs but it's a nice floral smell. The taste leads in with the bittering hops but the cascade hops really balance it out well and the after taste is not super bitter like your typical IPA. I enjoyed it and really like the contrasting hop notes."
"Overall its a good drinkin IPA. Stong on hops but enough maltiness to mellow it all out."
"D - I hope everyone wants to drink this all night. I think I will!"
"This is probably my favorite Bear Republic offering to date, and one of my favorite IPAs as well."
"The taste is better, more complex, and less grapefruity but still clearly dominated by citrusy hops. It has fairly strong citrus, leaning to grapefruit, hitting up front but immediately tempered with underlying slightly caramelly raisiny, malty sweetness and an interesting yeasty quality, making it sweeter before a somewhat bitter finish. It's full bodied in flavour and feel, with quite a bit going on, with a silky, creamy feel."
"Drinkability: I just had to give this beer a high drinkability score because it's a well balanced IPA and it's easily affordable. You're not going to break the bank buying this IPA. There's those factors and that it's a Bear Republic beer. They always do an excellent job on their beers and this is another one of those beers that shows it."
"I am very impressed with Racer 5 on this second try. I'm a lover of DIPAs and I find this IPA almost there. Lots of hops. Lots of character. Great IPA."
"D - This is a very nice double IPA and comparable to my favorites of the style."
"What I have here is a good looking hoppy, blonde IPA. The bright, white foam is dense as it sits on top of clear yellow ale. The head leaves a lot of lace behind as it falls. Pretty. The nose is citrus hoppy with a touch of honey. Fresh and leafy citrus hop flavors dominate. Crisp fresh malt is detected up front, but it is quickly followed by an assault of spicy, citrusy hops push the malt into the background and merely support the hops all the way to the dry, spicy, slightly hot (alcoholic) finish. A very drinkable IPA despite the 7 percent alcohol. It goes down very easy no doubt in large part due to its dryness. Body is surprisingly light. Methinks I have a fresh bottle of this stuff. Lucky me. I can't believe I hadn't reviewed this beer. I first tried this several years ago at the Real Ale Festival in Chicago."
"M/D: The taste and light carbonation, coupled with the medium to light texture of the beer make this very drinkable. If you wrap that all up into the fact that I love hops, this beer ranks really high on my list of favorite IPAs."
"All and all not a bad IPA, it has been quite a while since I've had one, but this one may get me back on that horse."
"Another great offering from BR - especially if I'm looking for my hop bomb. Reminds me of HopWallop a bit."
"Definitely a legendary American beer that deserves the hype."
"Still waiting to try Racer X - it's never a given when you take these solid IPAs and make them doubles."
"Aroma is of floral hops and citrus. Hops hit the palate immediately - floral and piney, white pepper, tangerine. Light and clean, this one is at the upper limit of being an IPA without becoming a DIPA/IIPA. Another excellent offering from Bear Republic - if you like this one, try their Racer X."
"When it gets down to the nitty-gritty I really don't care how the label on an ale bottle looks. I can't say that for the first-time buyers of premium IPA. Bear Valley Racer 5 is a truly great West Coast IPA and one of my new favorites. Thanks to some very talented and uncompromising brewers at Bear Republic!"
"D- Easy drinking IPA for all my fellow hop heads out there. An exceptional brew thats a must have for any fans of the IPA style."
"Had one of these after a hard days work. The hops were definitely prevalent but not overpowering. There was enough malt backbone to balance it out and keep it out of ""hop bomb"" range for my taste. Nice 1/2 inch head. Great copper color. Tight bubbles coming out of solution. It had a great, floral hop nose that really invited you into the glass. Very nice beer."
"this beer has to be tried! if you like ""hop bombs""then this beer will turn into an every day pleasure. not quite stones ruination ipa but is still a superb brew!! after being exposed to the breweries that brew these double ipa creations & their other varieties, everything i've had before is not as appealing."
"D. This has a good drink ability i need more, definitely!"
"smooth on the mouth, but a bit oily, a spicyness really helps bring the bitterness to the tongue. easily drinkable but would probably move to something different after a few."
"D: Very High for an IPA, I could have had a couple more easy. Very smooth not too bitter and not too dry which allowed for a very refreshing IPA."
"An excellent, well-balanced, very drinkable IPA. Highly recommended."
"D: Very drinkable, may not get again on tap but will likely pick some up to enjoy at home."
"D: Excellent balance for an IPA, extremely impressive. I continue to fall deeper in love with the West Coast IPA's. My first offering from Bear Republic, a new fav brewery who's other offerings I'll be trying soon!"
"D - A very balanced IPA. Great hop taste and just enough malt. This is a great beer to sit and chill with at an afterwork happy hour, yet hoppy enough for hardcore hopheads!"
"D-Easy to drink not nessarally the first IPA I would reach for but one i'll for sure go after againit should also be noted that the 750 was only 4.99 which makes it an exceptional value."
"I've enjoyed this beer on tap before, but I had never had the chance to review it. From memory, it's slightly better on tap, but the bottle is very good, too. If I can't decide when I'm at my favorite beer bar, I'll always go back to this beer. This is a fine example of the style and an essential for anyone seeking a broad understanding of American IPAs."
"D - I would like to rate this a little higher but it is on the citrusy end of the IPA scale for me. Very bitter which is what I look for most in an IPA. I will come back to this one."
"A very good brew. Works perfectly for a chicken tandoori dish. A great brew in the style. Well worth trying to find yourself a bottle."
"D: This is one of the better IPAs I've had. I do wish this was closer to the 6% range, I'd drink a ton. At it's price, there's few better"
"D - Very excellent. Am always down to get a pitcher. I always use this IPA as the standard for comparison."
"D: At 7% it'll do the trick if your liver's not pickled. For a veteran a good session ipa."
"Drinkability: Can see this beer being a problem for me! goes down very smooth and quick could lead to intoxication rather quickly."
"This is a very drinkable beer that you will try to savor to the last drop, but no matter what you do you won't be able to have your cake and eat it too (it will end). Stop crying and buy some more Racer 5. Enjoy friends!"
"D - Easy drinking for a 7% IPA. Goes down smoothly. I imagine it would be a good beer for pairing with food."
"This is a pretty decent IPA - it doesn't knock my socks off, but it's solid, drinkable and enjoyable. At least it's a good example of the style."
"One of the more drinkable IPA's I have had. Not sure which is better this or the Hop Rod. Not sure I have personally ever had a head this impressive; at one point was two inches out of the glass without falling apart."
"Poured from the 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, golden-orange color with a pillowy, one finger, off-white head. The beer leaves a wall of lacing around the edge of the glass as the beer recedes. The smell is all hops, very west coast IPA. Citrusy like grapefruit, slightly piney. The taste starts like the smell, all citrusy hops, slightly sweet and finishes very bitter leaving the mouth dry and puckered. The alcohol is pretty well covered by the bitter finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Drinkability suffers slightly due to the unbalanced finish. If they could maintain the excellent initial flavor throughout, they'd really have something. As it is, this beer is a good IPA, just not as good as it could be."
"On tap at 99 Bottles in Santa Cruz. Poured into a pint glass. Light clear amber color with a tan head that recedes to a ring leaving some wispy lacing. Aroma is pretty much just citrus and pine. Hops galore. Flavor is piny with some neutral malt. Clean and herbal, high bitterness with no astringency. Nice prickly mouthfeel, crisp and dry. A solid drinkable IPA."
"There are so many good IPA's on the market these days that I rarely order Racer V. Nevertheless, this remains one of the better IPA's on the market, and quality is refreshingly consistent. Unfortunately, after having it's stable mate, the Racer X, I just find it difficult to get too excited about Racer V any more. Still, this remains a good quality, solid IPA."
"D: While this was not intensely aggressive it was still a great IPA and very drinkable. I still have other favorites but I would put this back into the rotation."
"D - this is a very good IPA. It had a nice balance and I enjoyed the fruitiness of the hops in this."
"For an almost hop monster, this is quite drinkable. It stays crisp, with barely a trace of the syrupiness that bothers me in a lot of hoppy brews."
"D: Lots and lots of flavor in this, which almost becomes overwhelming by the end of the beer, but a very enjoyable IPA."
"Bring on Racer 5. Glad they finally started importing it to this Anheuser-Busch controlled state."
"Not much to say for this beer. It's a typical West Coast IPA drowned in hops. All the usual notes - pine, citrus, some sweetness. Good carbonation. Nice looking beer. I probably won't have another one for a couple years. Not nearly enough flavor balance. Give me a Dogfish 90 minute. Or a Pliny."
"Pours glowing amber from 22 oz bottle. Enormous, creamy, delicious head grows with time. The taste is fantastic -- for lack of better descriptors, it tastes like a west coast Two Hearted Ale. Mouthfeel is smooth, a little sticky, and lingering. I would gladly drink this regularly, and probably will. Great new (to STL) IPA for the rotation."
"Very nice IPA from Bear Republic. Very glad these babies started coming in six packs in my region."
"D - This beer was very enjoyable and easy to drink. I liked it more and more as it went on."
"The beer has a great color, a deep gold or light amber that pretty much nails my mental picture of how an IPA should look. The head could stick around a bit longer, but that's really quibbling over details. The beer smells good. It's not as overtly hoppy in taste or smell as Hop Rod Rye, Racer 5's cousin, but it has some nice citrus notes, which Hop Rod doesn't. I feel a bit silly talking about each category for this beer, so I'll sum up my feelings quickly. The taste is well-balanced and dry. The mouthfeel is very nice with great carbonation that plays an excellent supporting role. Finally, it's just exceptionally drinkable. The beer is sweet, hoppy and dry. The flavors don't linger and the bitter aftertaste is just right. For me, Racer 5 is a perfect storm of drinkability."
"Picked up a bomber of this at Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, VA and am I glad I did. Orange colored, pours with a nice off-white head and a little bit of retention. Aroma is wonderful, floral with loads of pine needles and hops. The flavor follows suit, citrusy with a blast of pine needles and hops up front. Crisp and bitter in the finish. There's a syrupy malt base that is noticed more as the beer warms a little. This is terrific stuff and a true top notch IPA."
"D - Not as overpowering as I expected, but still packs a little bit of a wallop... Solid and enjoyable, but not spectacular..."
"Pours a very nice cloudy copper with a thick off-white head. Good lacing. Smells primarily of grapefruity hops, though malt and spices are also present. This carries on into the taste, though the malt becomes a bit more prevalent. Nice roasted flavors. Mouthfeel is decent; thick and with a hint of carbonation. A bit too unbalanced for my taste, but I'm admittedly not a hophead."
"First sip was ""WOW""...this is a serious beer. Huge hoppy/grapefruit flavor with some alcohol taste following, a little think but very dirnkable. BR didn't hold back in making this beer, it's really good!"
"An amber to golden color, with a half inch white colored head. The strong scent of grapefruit and pine strike the nose at first sniff, that is followed by the mellow fragrance of malt at the end. The malt comes out at the start of the taste, then it blends to an intense grapefruit, grassy, earthy bitterness takes over and dominates till the end. A thin watery feel at bthe front, it then gradually becomes more of a medium bodied feel. This a really good IPA, bringing a strong aroma and excellent flavor, which are the backbone of a great beer, makes this one outstanding."
"Pours a deep orangish copper color. Hazy in clarity. Nice white head forms right away. Very good head retention for the first few minutes, it then settles down to a nice lacing on top of the beer. A good floral smell, hops are right up front. Maybe a little fruity note, apricot, maybe hint of orange? Mouth feel, slightly sweet start but the hops kick in almost right away. Oily feel going through the mouth. Good bitter hops note but not too much, alcohol (7%) is well hidden but does help balance out the hops, you do feel the hops on your teeth between sips. All in all I had forgotten how much I love this beer. May need to stack it up against the 90 min when I get home in a battle royal for my top IPA. If you are a hop and IPA fanatic then go get one of some Racer 5, a supreme example of a West Coast IPA. I have got to figure out a way to get this stuff in GA."
"Overall Impression - This is a good IPA. It's very drinkable, and not overwhelming with hops, and bitterness. I see that as a detractor, but many others trying to develop a palate for hops, or who just aren't hop heads would probably love this IPA. The hop aroma, and flavor are very nice. For a 7% abv beer the alcohol is a little to noticeable. This is probably the biggest problem that I have with this beer. Long story short, solid, but nothing to write home about."
"Racer 5 has a great taste without being too bitter giving it a nice drink-ability. Definitely give this one a try."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Just a really tasty brew, and with moderate alcohol it's definitely easy to consume. I'm kind of mad at myself for walking past this one for a little over a year now!"
"pitcher at Galaxy Hut, Arlington"
"Racer 5 India Pale Ale is a well crafted west cost style IPA that is crafted brilliantly with the right amount hoppiness, which after all is what this beer is all about."
"Smooth, soft mouthfeel for an IPA. Medium body. Very drinkable, plush, velvety, and smooth. So well balanced and tempered. Prolly the most drinkable IPA ever. I don't care about criteria - this is a session beer!"
"The appearance was fairly clear light amber color and had a nice lacey head. I really enjoyed the clean hoppy smell. the fell is very smooth and followed by, The taste came on strong a bitter finish. This beer is defiantly an enjoyable beer for IPA lovers"
"Pours a clear orange/amber with a nice stark white fluffy head that leaves behind good lacing. Nose is pretty much all west coast hops with some slight hops. Taste follows with balls out west coast grapefruit and pine hop flavors. A subtle yet apparent malt presence here that provides a mild sweetness. Some small spice in here, but not much is noticed over the standard west coast hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is just on thick side here for a standard IPA as is the abv. drinkability is quite good. A very slammable IPA. Overall a very good brew, one of the better IPAs around, and one that Im sure would be a staple if it were locally available. Good Beer."
"Poured a 22oz bottle into my Smokestack goblet (3 pours). This beer pours a cloudy amber orange with a big fluffy white head that leaves hints of lacing as the head recedes. The aroma is spot on for a West Coast IPA. Big citrus notes with orange and grapefruit with just a hint of its malt backbone. The taste is much the same with citrusy hops dominating every other flavor, even living a biting bitterness coating your mouth. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated but still very resiney. This is a great IPA that I will definitely be seeking out again now that Bear Republic has found its way to Kansas liquor stores."
"D: very drinkable brew, nice and light and refreshing... drinks like more of a pale ale than an ipa."
"D: Good taste and no overwhelming aftertastes give this a thumbs up. The ABV probably makes this a beer that cannot be sessionable...though that 22 oz. went down pretty quickly. Another West Coast IPA that has won my heart and/or liver."
"Six 12oz bottles purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston for $14. No freshness date found. Pours a nice cloudy gold. (Though a later bottle is more clear, at least by the end of it.) Strong hop aroma. Strong warming American hop flavour. A straight-forward west coast IPA - god bless em."
"Excellent, and worth a try (or several)."
"Very drinkable with very mild carbonation. Refreshing. I'll try this one again, & that's two-for-two winner from this brewery for me. Time to delve into some more Bear Republic stuff."
"oh.. this will make your face hot"
"D - Very. I'd serve this to friends with no mental reservation or purpose of evasion."
"It's taking a little while for me to appreciate IPA's. While not a preferred style, it wasn't too bad & I'm glad I had an opportunity to try it...."
"Damn good IPA, just enough malt to keep it from being overly bitter, just where I like it. Good stuff."
"D= A bit unbalanced toward the hop side of things, but still, a great tasting ale for those craving hops!"
"All in all, a fine IPA. Though my particular pint was a little less overwhelming than anticipated, I have had superb brews from this Left Coast craft brewer. Perhaps, I just need to drink some more ....?"
"Pours a light golden with a one finger of white head that dissipates quickly and leaves little spotty lacing. I get a strong hop smell right off the bat. I almost smell some woody accents. taste is of strong hops and little else. Kind of weak support for such strong hop dominance. A slightly bitter finish. Better than most beers, but not as good as my favorites."
"Pours a clear, light amber with a small head that sticks around. Aromas of pine, citrus and sweet malts waft in my nose. Taste is hoppy, citrusy and sweet all at once, and finishes slightly bitter with a touch of alcohol. A light body on this beer makes it very quaffable and refreshing. Kind of on the light side for an American IPA, but very tasty nonetheless. Another winner from Bear Republic."
"d: a nice IPA with good hop flavors"
"M: medium carbonation, practically unnoticeable abv (although on the high end). crisp, refreshing and flavorful. easily redrinkable. hop lovers rejoice!"
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth, with pretty good drinkability."
"A great Ipa in my book!"
"D: Yep. I'm surprised there are so many reviews when this is the first time I've seen this in my local. Fresh from the tap, this would probably be outstanding."
"Drinkability? It's good. Full bodied yet refreshing and very enjoyable. Just be careful, it's 7% so you'll end up feeling it."
"Appearance is burnt orange with an intferesting thick white head with very light orange tones. Smell is strong of citrus, specifically grapefruit, apricot, and floral/herbal hops. Taste is very strong of grapefruit and herbal hops. It is interesting in that it has a crisp, almost sweet flavor at first, then has an acidic bitter taste as it goes down. Overall, a nice IPA that has a bite to it."
"Overall, a very nice IPA. I'm looking forward to having this one again."
"Overall, a very respectable American IPA - nothing I'd go out of my way for but worth sampling if you have the chance."
"All in all this is a top notch IPA. A Very nice job from Bear Republic once again."
"This is a very smooth and drinkable beer for the amount of hops, malts, and alcohol involved."
"This is one of the finest beers I've tasted for a while. Piney, citrusy, grassy, hoppy, grapefruity... it's all those things, and the brewmaster has managed to balance them well. A rather pale golden colour with a good head that subsides and leaves moderate lacing. Plenty of aroma on raising the glass to the nose and a powerful hit of flavour on the tongue, but it retains a degree of sublety. Slightly oily mouthfeel, but not bad for that. I think this is a one-bottle-a-session beer for me, either to get things underway or round off the night. Either way I'm very happy to drink it, and I think this is a beer that would pair well with very many types of food, even curry."
"As this beer pours from a 12 oz bottle I'm immediately greeted with a wonderful pine-like aroma. I can't wait to settle into this one. As I finish pouring I am left with an inch of tiny micro-bubbled foam, reminiscent of egg whites. Retention lasts less than a minute. Lacing is nice and sticky. AS expected the piney hops are very evident in the aroma. This has a really mellow flavor profile with a nice bitter bite at the end. Slightly carbonated with an oily feel that coats your entire mouth. Very nice. I'm sure I'll be cracking open a few of these over the next few months!"
"I was in San Diego, CA at the Yard House when I ordered this one. I got it poured from draft into a half yard glass. It was smooth with a really nice citrus ting. The beer left a nice full lacing on the long yard glass. This offering has a nice clean, fresh taste that leads to a really great social beverage. Awesome head retention."
"Serving type: 22oz bomber"
"D: This might be a once a month or two purchase for me, though I do love IPAs, I've definitely had fuller, more complex ones, namely Coast's HopArt here in Charleston, SC."
"A very good IPA, I definitely recommend it."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Pint glass. Real good lacing, nice head. But the nose...WOW!! I went around the house and got the wife, kid, and finally the cat to sniff this baby (Yes, he even licked some foam!!)!! Awesome! Taste, just as good. Beautiful and drinkable, too drinkable. I've had some of this stuff a year ago in a trade, and now it's available locally in PA. Thank the good Lord! I will be gettin' this stuff often. One of my fav IPA. Cheers, shertz"
"Pours slightly hazy amber with off white one finger head. Nose of citrus and piney hops with a hint of malt. Flavor is actually pretty incredible- hits harsh and bitter but subsides into an incredibly smooth aftertaste. Nice citrus (grapefruit) and pine elements. Palate is great- despite its 'pale ale' status its actually quite rich and by no means watery or thin. Lots of alpha acids and great palate make this a definite winner."
"If you are a hop head, look elsewhere."
"Thick frothy fluffy huge bright white glowing head, hazey brillaint orange in color. Smells of sweet carmal malts tropical fruit and some floral and piney sents. Tastes beautifully bitter with a spicey hop note throughout carmal malt backbone with some citrus fruit flavors here and there. Feel grand on the palate and 22oz may not be enough. LOL"
"Pours a chilled golden color with a slight, frothy head. Nice citrus hop aroma. Taste has a solid pale malt background with some rind like citrus hop bitterness. Very juicy flavor and mouthfeel. Not an overly complex hop flavor, but satisfying nonetheless. Mouthfeel is slick, almost watery with a medium body and carbonation. Not being overly aggressive helps the drinkability, which is quite good. Recommended."
"I'm not normally a big IPA fan (so sue me), but this was a beer I really enjoyed and will certainly revisit. Thankfully one of our local liqour store chains is now carrying some of the Bear Republic brews, and I am certainly thankful for that. Another excellent choice from a fine brewer."
"I am very impressed with this brewery so far. Not distributed to my area, I have to pick these up when I travel to Ohio. So far, every beer from this brewery has been finely attenuated, but rich in proteins and all have supurb head retention / formation. Racer X is no exception. The onset brings a rich, but clean looking copper / amber color, thick foamstand, and lively co2. The beer takes on a rich, biscuity malt character in the aromas and flavors. I was really impressed with the clean attenuation, with no harshness-- a perfect balance. Great hop balance for IPA-- I would prefer a stronger sharper hop influence, but I think I got an aged bottle where the hops have settled out a bit. At any rate, this is a truely expressive, hop-oriented IPA. Citrus notes hinge more on oranges than grapefruits due to the sturdy malt base and ester profile. Very full to the palate, again close to a Double IPA. The finish is very clean, crisp, and cracker-like, but with a long dry hop flavor and a touch of caramel. An extremely nice beer. I'll take a few points off because of the sediment in the bottle which may come from too much age, but look forward to trying a fresher bottle."
"This is a very nice IPA, and one that I have heard nothing about. I bought this at Julio's, MA. Apparently, this is quite ubiquitous given the number of reviews. I thought I was trying something less popular. The beer pours a golden amber with lots of carbonation, a foamy head, some retention and lacing. The aroma is all hop, juicy, estery, oily hop. There are grapefruit notes and florals too. You can whiff a bit of biscuity malt if you try. The taste is a blast of pungent, citrusy hop, with plenty of estery and oily resinous hop as well. There is a nice creamy backbone to the beer that balances out the hop bite. The grapefruit like tartness and the malty breadiness in the rear make this a fine offering. The beer is quite well carbonated, very refreshing, lots of effervescence, and just nice all around. The aftertaste is about right, not too mild, not too lingering. L'Chaim."
"Very drinkable and very enjoyable. Another IPA I wish was available in NH."
"Very rarely do I saw an IPA needs more malts, but this could use a pinch. I'm not complaining at all. I love the assaut, but some malts could frame this and make it even more punchy."
"A very drinkable IPA and one that I really do appreciate for what it is. However the ABV will actually shock you. It creeps up on you."
"Split a 22oz bomber with allthetimeineed. Pours a pale amber color, slightly hazy due to dry hopping. Two fingers of white head slowly dissipates slowly leaving plenty of lacing. Aroma is hop forward, very flowery, citrusy and somewhat sweet. Flavor to match: floral, citrus, sweet pine and a dry finish. Somewhat heavy mouthfeel with good drinkability. Typical example of the West Coast hop bombs that I love."
"You have probably had one by now - if not go get one now."
"Pours a clear, golden/orange color, with a tremendous rocky off-white head, which stays put! Leaves behind a ton of lacing. Smell is piney, with a good amount of sweet malt in the nose. Taste is beautifully balanced, the citrus & pine of the hops duke it out with the malty goodness. Nice bitter & slightly floral finish. Incredibly drinkable IPA, and in terms of what I have easy access to, quite possibly the best."
"D - I feel that this is a very drinkable brew. The abv is a little on the higher side, and it is a bit of a fuller body, but it is tasty and, to me, not difficult to drink."
"D: Racer 5 is a top-notch American IPA. It's higher ABV and less-than-pleasant finish limit drinkability somewhat, but Racer 5 is still a damn fine example of the style."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This is one I'll buy again, what a great IPA. Goes down smooth and the higher level of alcohol is hidden quite nicely. Carbonation at first seemed a bit high and too prickley, but is actually quite fitting given the characteristics for the rest of the beer. This is one tot try, get out there and find it. I'll most likely be getting this again, most likely when I'm in the mood for a good IPA. One of the better IPAs I've drank."
"D- A very nice and solid brew. Will be picking some more of this up."
"D: A really refreshing IPA... I could drink several of these tonight ... and just might."
"The light balance makes this extremely drinkable. No way of telling this is 7% abv. If you like balanced, drinkable IPA's, this is for you. Well done."
"mouthfeel is thick bitter, very drinkable, a really good ipa"
"Pours a nice shade of orange with a little haze to it. Nice 1 finger head with great retention and good lacing. Smell is strong of hops but there is a definite malt presence as well, a bit of caramel. Taste is good, however I have to say I was expecting more hops. Hops are there but I think I noticed the malt a little more, especially as the beer warmed. Leaves an oily bitterness as it goes down and slight warming effect from the alcohol. Medium mouthfeel. Overall a good beer."
"Chewy mouthfeel. Smooth and sessionable. Take a couple laps and pull Racer 5 into the pits for a high-performance bitter fix."
"First sip of this beer is tongue numbing. Absolute hop bitterness. Tastes like fresh squeezed grapefruit juice with a cane sugar finish to balance things out. This beer is very refreshing. Its hard not to take big sips of this. I should have bought a second bottle so I could savor the tastes of that one and drank this one in big mouthfuls like the hop pig that I am. Great job Bear Republic!"
"has a sharp bite that leaves quickly, although the hops stick around for a bit. a slightly piney aftertaste. a bit thick mouthfeel. well balanced. a little mild for an IPA, but in no way weak."
"Mouthfeel and flavor are a little thin and one-sided. But is that so bad, when the hops are so good? Excellent and flavorful IPA, highly recommended for a fix of bitterness."
"Pours a hazy tennessee orange with a sticky white topping. Nose is definitely juicy grapefruit as well as pine-tree car freshener, citrus dominates for me. Taste is juicy at first with the spicy hops and a slight alcohol burn taking over quickly which makes you smack your lips after each sip. A very good west coast style IPA, this brewery does a wonderful job with the style."
"D, notes: A great IPA. Very drinkable."
"overall,this is an excellent american ipa.i was elated to see this beer being offered in six packs in ohio.hopefully more of bear republic's beers are offered in that form as opposed to bombers.i don't mind the bombers,but 6 packs allow for a more prolonged experience with the beer."
"12 oz bottle. Very nice hop aroma. Gives you the hello, you're about the hang with some hops chat. Nice flavor, hoppy, but not obnoxiously over the top. Pleasantly hoppy that goes nicely with the malt. Good lasting aftertaste. One I will have to get again."
"Overall, I cant get enough of this aroma! It's a truly amazing hop aroma profile. However, the taste just doesnt live up to the hype the aroma sets forth. Still a very good beer and one I will definately go back to. Cheers!!"
"Very good beer and it's not just hop tea with some alcohol. Very well rounded for a West Coast IPA."
"An extremely pleasant, drinkable brew, great balance, not overpowering in any way but thoroughly solid and flavorful. Would highly recommend this brew to all comers."
"Mouthfeel is mellow and smooth with moderate carbonation."
"D: Drinkability is actually pretty high on this and I could drink this one most of the night."
"Love this brew the more I drink it. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Deep amber with a one finger head on a gentle pour. Smell is super fresh hoppy goodness, some pines and other woods. Taste buds get super excited with the brew rolling over my tongue, just the right amount of alcohol, bittering hops, aromic hops, and malts. Highly drinkable for any hophead."
"Drinkability- Nicely drinkable. Bear Republic's best effort yet. Worth a revisit soon."
"D - Not my favorite. Actually does remind me of throat medicine somewhat. I know it's an IPA, but the hops are harsh, coarse and tough to handle."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very smooth. Bitterness is a little strong but by IPA standards it is very drinkable."
"On tap at the Moan and Dove. The beer had a murky orange look with some slight amber in the light. Eventual lacing from its thin head. The aromas of alcohol were pretty strong, supplementing the hop and malt flavors. The taste was similar to the smell: bittersweet with malty, hoppy goodness. Medium body helps this pretty malty IPA be an enjoyable drink for the evening."
"D - Overall, this is a really great, extremely well balanced IPA."
"Pours very similar to the pale ale from bear republic, only slighter darker. Intricate balance between the hops and malts yet again from them. Smell contains a slight bit of pine needles, but really balanced by a heap of sweetness of malt. Lots of sweetness, richness and theres always a bitter side hanging on the background but really only stays there on the back of the palate. Only a slight bit of spice to the ""piney"" side to this balanced IPA. This beer is 100% a school girl that is smart as hell and down for doing work, and always good to bring to your parents house. Great IPA. Did i say creamy malts?"
"Really, really good IPA, one of the best ever, up there with Bell's, Stone, and Green Flash versions of the style (among exalted others). Yum."
"Thanks again to hurleymanvw for sharing this one with me."
"D - A joy to have and easy to enjoy, Great IPA."
"The aroma is a typically wonderful fresh, floral, fruity, citrusy hop burst. On the palate there is a fruitiness up front, with a sweetness that doesn't cloy, isn't really sweet actually, just serves to perfectly balance an experience of complex hop flavors that come on citrus and fruit, finishing with pine and flowers. Classicly near-perfect West Coast IPA, closely resembles Stone to me (need to try these side-by side). Great effort, wonderfully drinkable beer. Reaffirms my love of the balanced IPA, no DIPAs for me..."
"Drinkability: I wish I could get it in Boise Thank you again Jason for hooking me up! I would love to buy a six pack of this beer and hike up to the top of camelsback at dust and share with fellow with fellow BA's and enjoy a fine Idaho sunset."
"If this were available in my home state, it would be a worthy competitor for Smuttynose IPA which, to me, it very much resembles."
"Racer 5 has always been one of my favorite IPAs but this keg was outstanding. Hoppy without being very bitter (though that would be ok). A unique and special IPA that would please hopheads and newbies alike."
"D-Due to relatively high abv I wouldn't call this a session brew but two 12's or one 22 oz. would be great anytime. Very nice IPA."
"D: If you like IPAs, this is one for you. It goes down very easy and has a lively personality."
"Pours a hazy dirty orange color with a nice dense white head that left a wall of lacing as it dissipated. The smell is of juicy floral and grapefruit hops and some pepper. This is followed by sweet malt aromas. The taste is of big grapefruit hops, some tropical fruit, pepper. Some malt sweetness to help try and balance. The feel is moderate with soft to fizzy carbonation, finishes with a big bitter bite. Also has a bit of a slick feel to it. Really reminds me of a DIPA without the bigger ABV. Definitely a very hoppy AIPA and a great call for any hop-head. Big on grapefruit and tropical fruit hops. Only negative is that it is a bit slick."
"this beer poured a golden color with a straw colored head that receded pretty quickly leaving scattered patches of thin head all around the top of the beer. WOW, this beer smells good. citrusy hops, grapefruit, lightly peppery fragrances dominate the nose. the citrusy hops EXPLODE in your mouth from jumpstreet, but leaves with just the right amount of sweetness to make you want to take another sip. this beer BEGS to be drank. fortunately, at 7% you can get a little reckless with them without paying high prices. not to mention, at under $5 a bomber, this things a steal. the mouthfeel is nice and suits this style beer and i could drink one after another until i passed out. another fine offering from bear republic, which has proven to me that they make all their beers very well."
"I've only had this brew one time before.. but I am truly thankful I had the chance to try it again."
"pours a hazy honey color with a off white one finger head with a hard pour and lots of lace. strong pine hop and bitter citrus aroma. big hop taste hits you right away, lots of biscuity malt, but its all about the hops from start to finish and lingering after taste. medium mouthfeel and excellent carbonation even after a hard pour. if you like india pale ale give it try."
"Drinkability> Its not my first choice for an american ipa, but its far from my last choice."
"One of my favorite IPAs, this beer is absolutely rock solid. I just realized that I typed that I could put away a few of these, no problem, and although that's probably true, I would advise doing that on a full stomach, and not before you need to drive anywhere. Either way, this is a delicious beer. It's coarse and rough in taste, but smooth in the mouthfeel; it's sweet and dense in its foundation, but crisp, fruity, and floral in a big way up front; and it's typically pretty inexpensive. A sure bet."
"This was very drinkable, but of course as any good IPA, it was tough to move on to a non hoppy non IPA following this - burned my taste buds a little!"
"I've drank Racer 5 on multiple occasions, just not in succession. I would probably score higher if it weren't for the alcohol feel. I don't mind the ABV at 7%; there are plenty of awesome brews much higher. The balance is a bit lacking for my palate, which is why I don't enjoy it more. That said, it is loaded with hops, and that's worth being thankful for."
"A strong pour generates an inch and a half of rocky light tan head with solid retention. Body is a hazy straw orange that leans almost twords amber. A quarter inch of wavy lace is left behind. You really pick up the nose on the pour with soft creamy hop notes that have an almost chewy character to them. Maybe a bit of sweet sap also. The first thing that grabs me about this beer is the drinkability of it, it is odd to notice so soon on the palate. A balance of dandilion like hops mixed with a nutty mineral zest that stays on the mouthfeel. This is a dry woodsy IPA with almost no sweetness, which is must how the style should be. Alchol is right on at 7%. Clean and refreshing while being longly bitter. A super IPA that really hits the tongue."
"A good tasting IPA in my book. I'll buy thin again."
"I was really looking forward to this beer as I have heard many good things about the brewery. I was very disappointed."
"This had a light yeasty taste with tons of hops in the aftertaste. It was more of a pine flavor rather than citrus hops, and the texture was great. The bitterness was almost overpowering - a hophead's dream - making this a decent sipping IPA, but could be difficult for the average enthusiast to enjoy. (I personally enjoyed it quite well.)"
"HV"
"A very solid West Coast IPA. It has a very pronounced hoppiness to it but the citrus element and malt really help keep things in check and make this one hugely sessionable affair."
"Overall: If you like big hoppy IPAs you'll love this one. Highly recommended."
"Pours a cloudy golden,with a thin white head.Excellent retention,and lacing. Aroma is piney hops,and sweet fruits. Body is medium with some carbonation.Taste is really somthing! Sweet up front,with a grapefruit finish. Without a dobut, one of the best IPA's out there."
"Better than I hoped for -- I'd like to have more of these. Think of it as a big glass of ruby-red grapefruit juice that'll give you a nice buzz. Which is a wonderful thing."
"Delicious!"
"D: Overall great drinkability, even if your not a big hophead. Refreshing, huge citrusy hopping that was very smooth and bitter/sweet, citrusy and dry. Highly recommended."
"Pours a glowing, hazy, pale orange color with a dense and compact white head with decent lacing. Light spicy orange aroma. Tasty with spices, orange & other citrus, and a mild bitter hop aftertaste. Light- to medium-bodied and smooth with light carbonation. A light, enjoyable, and very drinkable IPA."
"Just had this for lunch at Frisco Grill in Columbia, MD. It was my first Bear Republic beer and I'm happy that I got it. It poured a slightly hazy dark orange color, with about a half inch of head that decided not to stick around for too long. Very spicey and fruity in the nose. when I took the first sip, the spiciness was almost overwhelming. The spiciness evolved into a simple bitter and finished nice and sweet. The beer was very crisp and sharp on the tounge. I could see myself having a couple of these before switching to something else. It was a very nice change of pace, though."
"This is an awesome IPA!!! As all of Bear Republics' beers they are beatiful when poured even gently it produces a fantastic head, thet lingers and leaves a sticky lace around the glass. 5 is generously hopped, but very drinkable for such a big beer. The aroma is great, flavor is right on, looks great, there is little to flaw here just a great IPA."
"Great orange hazy/straw color - with great head retention and tight bubbles. Smell of spicy hops and balance of sweet malt, simple balance. Expected flavor for an AIPA soft hops upfront and rounded mouthfeel. Hops linger but not for long. I could almost drink this all night, a first for me from Bear Republic - I was very excited about finding this on my trip."
"Medium-full bodied, smooth, and a little creamy. Not too crisp, but not heavy either. Great drinkability - could definitely stick with this one for a while. Possibly my new favorite IPA."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Good balance. Almost a little bit on the chewy or oily side in terms of mouthfeel. Almost leaning towards being slightly full bodied...I wouldn't call it crisp, which I generally prefer in a basic IPA. Pretty much a good standard IPA, though. I don't know that anything makes it stand out against other examples....except it has a much bigger head and a lot more lace most I've tried. Certainly a session candidate."
"Right now it's UCLA 28 Stanford 24 with 3:33 left in the first half."
"D: Very, very solid... well balanced and hoppy enough to satisfy us hop heads but still accessible..."
"Smooth and complex, this is a great American IPA!"
"D. Definitely an IPA for when you want more than one!! Very drinkable."
"D: enjoyable and not too hard to drink, high alcohol makes less sessionable"
"another great product from bear republic."
"A good beer, but honestly, I could not tell a bit of a difference between this and the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Worth trying however, when you can find it."
"Would buy regularly if it was available in my neck of the woods."
" The 7.00% ABV are about the closest that this beer will get to being an IPA. This isn't overpowering, but it's about as solid as this style gets and was quite a sight to behold as the tiny bubbles and clarity combined to form a near perfect image of what a beer should look like. Bear Republc's hit another homer with this beer, even though I still wish it was classified as a style more appropriate to it's taste. Nevertheless, like SN, Stone, and Anchor, this is another reason why I'm grateful for beers from the Golden State being available in this neck of the woods. My big bottle is nearly empty now and my soul is all the better for it. Long live Bear Republic!"
"I could get into real trouble with this beer because the taste begs me to have another. Just what I'd hoped for and one of the better AIPAs I've had. Ruination, DFH 60 and 90 Minute fans would like this."
"I'm a bit disappointed with this brew, I was hoping for a big-hop experience, but i though it paled in comparison to their Hop Rod and XP, both of which were superior. Not a bad brew you should turn down, but there are many better IPAs out there."
"Pours a hazy amber color with one finger of creamy white head that left sheets of lacing on the walls of my imperial pint glass. The smell of this beer hit me as I was pouring it. Big scents of citrus fruit and an earthy grassy scent that both equally vie for your attention. A slight bit of sweet malt is also trying to make itself known on the nose as well. The flavor profile is a duel battle between the sweet caramel malt and the citrus and pine flavor of the hops. Neither flavor dominates each other and this flavor profile is well crafted and well made. The mothfeel is a bit thin, but overall it is medium bodied with lower than average carbonation. The drink ability on this beer is impressive, and it leaves me wanting Bear Republic in Indiana."
"Mouthfeel comes off as smooth, but I'm reaching out for a slight amount more carbonation or perhaps finer carbonation. I'm nitpicking though. Drinkability is very high given the balance. No hint of the alcohol in the nose or taste. While this will not blow you away it won't offend either. Can serve as a great introduction to IPAs."
"Decent carbonation and mouthfeel. A bit toned down compared to some other west coast ipa's. Not too strong with resin/sticky hops. Great balance!"
"This beer poured a hazy yellow/orange with a huge rocky head. The aroma is fresh and green - big hop nose. The taste is bitter and citrus like with a balancing sweetness. It is intense but not harsh. The mouthfeel is medium and a bit creamy. Overall, a great drinking IPA!"
"man on man i've had some good beers past week. this one is no exception. pours a slightly cloudy golden orange color with a marginal head, and some decent lacing. the smell is darn good has a wonderful spicy and piney hop aroma. the taste is also very very good, its surprisingly smooth for a dIPA but has enough bitterness and alcohol warmness to make it unique. a real treat of a beer, glad to try it, and hope to have again."
"Foamy, citrusy, hoppy, lively, a cluster bomb of aromatic and taste explosions ripping from my nose to my lips to my tongue to my sinuses to my gullet. I'm full of Bear Republic beer shrapnel, critically wounded by depleted uranium nuclear hoppy goodness, and I'm McLovin it."
"A very tasty version of an IPA, attractive, aromatic, and satisfying. Differentiated among other IPAs by it's light but strong malt profile, slow hop ascension on the palate, and full body. I would drink more of this if I had more to drink. Overall a great beer."
"D: Very flavorful, easy drinking, balanced IPA. Right up there with Two Hearted and Blind Pig for me."
"Pours a three-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Fairly clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Grassy/piney hoppy nose. Starts balanced with a hint of sweetness but the hops kick in and dominate, bitter grapefruit finish. Good IPA but I don't like the hops in-your-face which the brewer has done all too well. $4.55 for a 22 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Bottle. Rich, hoppy/resiny aroma. Clear orange/amber color with thick, long lasting white head. Lots of fine bubbles coming un from bottom of glass even after several minutes. Very hoppy, resiny flavor with a nice malt backbone balanced by plenty of hop bitterness. Medium/light carbonation. Medium body with somewhat sticky finish. Nicely lingering aftertaste of hop flavor and bitterness. Excellent beer."
"D: Very solid ipa, definitely something I could enjoy for the night."
"D: This is perhaps a case where it's 'bigger is not necessarily better' for me. It could be a case of needing to be in the mood for the hops assault, but this is one I think I may hesitate on in the future. I really enjoyed their stout, though, so it hasn't thrown me off the brewery."
"My second sample from Bear Republic, and I am continually impressed by their big, bold, flavorful, aggressive beers... their IPA is an excellent depiction of the style - full-bodied, aggressive, loaded with hops, bittersweet, with caramel and vanilla essences... clear, lucid amber and copper appearance with a strong aroma suggesting of caramel and hops... in terms of taste, the hops certainly do dominate this one... bursting with enormous, strong flavor, the hops really come through on this one, crisp, clean, and ultra-refreshing and thick... great taste that is very true-to-the-style and full of quality... smell is loaded with hops, citrus, lemon, and florals... flavor strongly complements the aroma and does a great job at making its full-flavored quality known... if you're looking for a true, authentic, full-bodied IPA, this is the one for you, great stuff from Bear Republic... great creamy, rich mouthfeel and good drinkability make this a great American brew... really good stuff, and definitely recommended..."
"22 oz. into a mug - enjoyed over an hour or so to observe its evolution. Clean amber color with bountiful head. The frothiness of a root beer float has a decent half-life. This looks like good stuff - slightly cloudy, not overly carbonated. Beautiful flowery hop aroma - so much it's slightly soapy but not offensive. Unfortunately, the soapiness emerges more in taste, tempering the bountiful almost sweet, deep hop taste & texture. The soapiness fortunately dissipates quickly on the longer-than-average but slightly shallow finish. A little puckery in the mouth, consistent with a wonderfully deeply-hopped beer such as this. Drinks well; evolves positively through the length of the bomber. Well-done."
"Pours a cloudy amber color with a small soapy white head. Aroma is mainly the floral hop variety, with fresh cut grass and pine needles coming to mind. Taste consists of floral and citrus hop flavors, with the slightest of bread like malt flavors behind it. Very clean on the palate for a hop-bomb, 7% ABV is the only real drawback (if any) to this brew. Awesome!"
"An excellent IPA. One of the better American IPA's available. A great hop aroma when you stick your nose in the glass, only to followed by an equally impressive taste and mothfeel. While some might say, slightly over hopped, I feel it hits the style perfectly."
"The Racer IPA poured a cloudy hazy reddish orange with some solid lacing. The smell of was of cascade hops and a nice citrusy aroma. The Racer 5 was really well built and smooth and well balanced with a strong hop presence. It was sweet and luxurious in the mouth. It was a very pleasing IPA."
"Pours somewhat cloudy orange-gold a good whitish lasting head and nice lacing. Smell is very nice and slightly sweet smelling and big floral hops. Taste up front is smooth, clean, refreshing, and hoppy, but not overly so. Finish is with a fair amount of bitterness, but nicely tolerable. As it warms up slightly, it comes together better and is definitely more balanced and a touch sweeter and less bitter. Overall a great IPA, and maybe the first time I downed 22 oz. of any IPA and actually wanted more before."
"Overall: It was the thinest IPA I have ever tasted."
"N- What a great beer! Too bad I can't get sixers of this, I would keep it around at all times. Good for any season, heavy enough to stand up to spicy food, but refreshing enough for something light. This is the shit."
"Oddly enough, I'd never even heard of this one when I got to the dive bar in DC that had it on tap. Looked nice, a fairly deep amber color with slight haze and nice looking carbonation. Nose is nice; lots of grapefruit, some deeper malt notes, a good bit of fruitiness as well. Taste is delicious, a really excellent beer. Lots of bitter grapefruitiness, sweet malt, in basically a perfect balance. Feel is fairly thick and tasty with near-perfect carbonation. Overall, I was really blown away by this one. One of the best IPAs I've had."
"I can't help but feel a bit disappointed after expecting more. Anyway, still a very nice IPA for sure."
"This brew came with a lot of hype, and I'm extremely happy to say that I was not disappointed, even with the 40+ dollar bill for a case of 12 bombers. Thanks to Stockertown for bringing this brew to eastern PA. The only reason I dock points is because the sediment completely changes the beer."
"Yum. Its a sweet brew that has some nice citrus flavor with malts and honey. A good workhorse of a brew. This one is cheap in the stores, has big flavor and is very pleasing to drink. Not a big hop bitterness, aroma or flavor but there is enough there to make me smile and look for more of it in the store."
"Drank this while brewing a homebrew this past weekend."
"Drinkability is high, this is a nicely sweetened IPA with strong hop presence, the alcohol is lurking at 7% but this is could be an all-night drinker"
"This is one hell of a drinkable IPA. Great flavor, manageable bitterness. Fantastic beer."
"D: This is quite bitter but a lovely IPA to enjoy a full bomber of. I would order this if I saw it while I was out."
"O- This is a decent beer, and probably even worth the small price I paid for it. But not an exceptional IPA, the complexity isn't quite there."
"quite the IPA, but honestly just a bit overrated"
"A solid beer, not a favorite of mine, but worth a try for sure"
"I noticed Chicone's finally got this back in, so I picked up a bottle. Just as good as I remembered, very close between this beer and Hop Rod Rye for my favorite Bear Republic brew."
"Racer 5 poured a nice dark tan color from the bottle and had a nice head form at the pour. Unfortunately the head faded to a thin wisp, but it did lace the glass. The smell was a wonderful bouquet of earthy and spicy hops. There aroma was crisp and clean and adds nicely to the overall enjoyment of the beer. The taste did not disappoint. It first touches the tongue with good carbonation and then the earthy hops are right there on the tongue. The beer finishes nice with the spicy hops leaving a pleasant aftertaste. This beer has a great body for an IPA, not too thick and definitely not watery. A very drinkable beer and easy to enjoy. A great offering from Bear Republic!"
"The vibrant orange color mixed with the unfiltered haziness looks like a lava lamp from a distance. This one poured a big thick head that leaves large webs of lace. The smell of fresh grapefruit and fresh melons,and floral accents. Bright citrus fruit and hoppy sting on the palate. The mouthfeel is lacking some malt-backbone for you traditional types. But if your a true hop head this over the top assault of hops is just for you! I also like that the abv. is not to high. very drinkable at 7%.abv. The fruit and hops aftertaste last for a long time. What a great find!"
"Dark straw, slightly amber in color with only about a 1/8"" of white head by the time it made its way to my table. Aroma was pleasant but fairly subdued; piney, citrusy, and floral hops with a nice slightly caramelly malt backbone. Taste was quite good, citrusy and piney hops with a solid malt presence, a touch of sweetness and an assertive but not overwhelming bitterness. Overall fairly well balanced. Mouthfeel is good, light-medium bodied, moderate carbonation, a bit slick from the hop oils yet still somewhat creamy, very nice. Drinkability is good as well. This was quite tasty and well balanced. This is a great IPA with good hop presence that was quite quaffable."
"Had on tap into pint glass. great looking IPA- nice burnt orange color sith slight haze. Good off white one finger head, leaves good lacing. Smell is of citrus and pine, with slight alcohol finish. Taste is divine. This is a true IPA, or at least what I wish I could always have when I choose an IPA. Great Hop bitter bite, but finishes fairly smooth- great balance here. Bear Republic does it again for me!"
"Enjoy"
"Poured into a pint glass and it came out a clear (unfiltered) golden orange color with a two finger tan head that was very fluffy and lasted a while, and it has some thick lacing that just covered the glass. It has a strong malt aroma along with some mild citrus smells like lemon and oranges and has slight hint of that all familiar alcohol scent. Very smooth on the tongue and mouth which is completely not what I expected, it has a very hoppy flavor with some mild citrusy undertone and a lasting bitter aftertaste with a medium body all around. This is a pretty good IPA"
"Great beer, cant wait to be able to get more in Jersey. Far from what I had expected in a west coast IPA, but still a great drink. Went ridiculously well with sausage tacos at the Linkery."
"This is a damn good IPA, full of bitterness, but also finely balanced. I could drink this all night!"
"D:Another great example of a great IPA baby."
"This isnt the knight rider of beers, but not the herbie the love bug either. I would say it's a 1961 Dodge Charger. Cherry Red, and kicking Ricky Bobby's ass at Talladega."
"Pours a hazy amber with golden hues, nice off-white head and good lacing. Smells are strong even before it reaches the nose, citrus and floral hops. Taste is great, lots of grapefruit up front followed by orange and lemon peel, a good malt backbone, and a grassy finish. Medium in body with a great balance and good carbonation that lasts throughout the whole glass. A very drinkable IPA, great flavors that don't overpower each other. Good to see it finally be available in Pennsylvania, makes it easier for me to enjoy this one more often."
"note: MUST be consumed at warmer (room) temperatures. if too cold, the bittering take over."
"D- A very decent IPA. I am impressed. I would love to try this on tap."
"D - A safe bet and a solid example of an IPA. I'd say it is definitely worth a try. Now I'm interested in finding the Racer X..."
"Taste is of hops (of course) and citrus. Very smooth. Citrus become more of pineapple on palate. Bitter but ever pleasant taste is quite smooth very nice finish. I wish I had another bomber of this. Excellent start to the new year as this is my first beer and review of 2008."
"Pours slightly fogged orange amber with a great crÃ¨me head and a lot of lacing on the way down. Nose is very piney hops. Flavor is super hops. Stays full and unwavering. Feel is smooth with a thicker liquid body and a good carbonation. It feels just as good as it tastes. This is pretty damn drinkable and pretty damn good."
"D - really good IMO; nice, strong IPA (you can't tell from drinking it) that feels really refreshing. Definitely pick it up. Liking this brewery a lot"
" Mouthfeel is full and a bit sticky, with a coating of resin left all over the interior of my mouth. While this one goes down easy, it's also a rather heavy hitter, and a bit dangerous to have just flowing out of my living room wall. Oh well, that's the price you pay for greatness, I guess."
"Drinkability: This is an extrenely drinkable IPA, moreso than others. No cloying bitterness or disturbing finish, well hidden alcohol, and floral flavors make this a clea cut winner. While it doesn't blast me with hops, I can still appreciate them in both the aroma and taste. Bear Republic makes another winner in my book. Highly recommended. Could easily do 3 bombers, and at $4 apiece, it wouldn't be so pricey."
"Poured an attractive golden/orangey color with nice head that hung around for a while. Aroma was nice; very hoppy with notes of pine, citrus, and grass. Taste was very much the same with the same hoppy flavors up front, but ended with a nice malty finish. Mouthfeel was excellent and lacing on the glass was good. This was extremely drinkable and one I will buy again."
"Its weakness is that it's initially sweet and a bit sticky, and the nose is not potent enough. Otherwise, it's great stuff. Not as good as the Hop Rod, though."
"Tastes exactly like the nose. Lots of tropical fruits, citrus, pine and some spiciness that I really enjoy."
"D - Fantastic IPA, very drinkable. A perfect balance of flavors, great first experience from this brewer. Sonoma wine country has some competition."
"D: Beautifully balanced IPA. Reminds me a bit of Three Floyd's Alpha King, which doesn't seem to be available over here on the East Coast anymore."
"it's hard to score beers when they are above a certain level of goodness. this is an all around great ipa. if you haven't tried it, you're missing out. great mix of hops. nice use of malt. smells wonderful and tastes heavenly too. goes down silky smooth and makes sharp cheese and spicy food even tastier. always room for improvement, but bear republic brings it proper like for a nice price.... i'm a devotee"
"I'm a huge hophead and would quickly order this beer again if I came across it."
"D: I like this a lot. It's not quite as hoppy as some IPAs out there, but the balance of flavors is very good. And it's not like there's no bitterness there. The hops have less flavor character than more citrusy beers, but the sweetness of the malt really makes up for this. Better than the Hop Rod Rye in my opinion. Now if only I can get my hands on some Racer X."
"this is a great beer to relax to over dinner or in front of the idiot box. this is one of my 'anytime' beers."
"Orange copper in color. Poured with very little head. Light trails of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a walk in piney forest with grapefruit aromas behind the pine. Tastes rich and full, something you want a real mouthful of, not just a sip. Good balance between sweetness of the barley and the astringency of the hops. Alcohol is well disguised. IÂm sorry I only bought one, this is a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability- Despite it's alcohol content this beer is remarkably easy to drink. I enjoyed it very much, and would gladly consume another any time after noon."
"-Oelergud"
"Poured a clear orange/amber color, solid whit head, good retention and lacing. Nose is absolutely huge, very piney. Taste is surprisingly malty for such a big IPA, along with some bready notes. mouthfeel has a high amount of texture, possibly due to being a bottle conditioned beer. A very nice, well balanced IPA. Flavor is well rounded, abv is just right, would definetly not mind having this again."
"I've been drinking this beer for years now and it's always been a favorite of mine. It's really a classic west coast IPA in my opinion. The body is full yet also light enough to be quaffable. The bittering is just right with a piney aroma and citrus flavor. It's good to know that this beer is so widely available on the west coast because its a quick choice for easy drinking. A great standby beer. It always kicks up a good fluffy head and goes down real easy. Bear Republic is one of the best breweries in northern California and Racer 5 is a good reason why."
"Overall, this was a really tastey Beer, and a great example of a North West Pacific I.P.A."
"22 oz bomber for $2.99 at the local BevMo. Light orange with a sudsy head. Thick sticky lacing as I work my way down. Lots of hops in the smell. Piney and citrusy mainly. Fantastic flavor. Grapefruit, orange, peppery with some malt sweetness. Smooth creamy mouthfeel. I could drink this one all night. This is my favorite IPA and I pick this up often. A definate winner imo!"
"On draught at 69 Taps in Akron. The beer is a dark golden amber color with a medium thin light beige head with good retention. Patches of lace. The nose is floral hops, with touches of sweet malt and pine. Medium body with a floral, hoppy character balanced by a fair amount of sweet caramel malt. Touches of citrus here and there too. The finish lightly dry, and is moderately hoppy initially, then offset by sweet malt. Overall this is a well-balanced and enjoyable IPA."
"Pours a clear, sparkly, bright -- nay, luminous amber with a pristine, sticky white head that leaves thick lacing on the glass. Very pretty beer. Pure American hop nose of grapefruit, pine sap and perhaps some chili oil. Malt influence on the nose is subdued -- just a hint of sweet nuts to provide a bit of a base for the hops. On the palate, bracing, fruity bitterness first off, then some big carbonation makes itself known. The mid-palate smooths out a bit to showcase the malts, although things remain wayyy off balance toward the hop side. This is a great American IPA -- brash and harsh and chock full of hops, with fairly little nuance, but the beauty of the hops is, in this case, enough. Excellent."
"I just wish Bear Rep. would come to Atlanta."
"D- Despite the near absence of balance this is a very good IPA. I love the bottle conditioning and the overall smoothness of the body. Not really the best tasting IPA I have had...but it's still very good; and probably in my top 5. Great West Coast IPA."
"M/D: Light on the palate and just a little watery. Carbonation is a tad high but that doesn't spoil the experience at all. This is definately something that I could down many pints of given the chance."
"Na Zdravje!"
"I bought one bottle of this on my honeymoon in August, so it may have been even better when the hops were fresher. I will buy and trade for this beer every chance I get."
"if you like hops this will be a great selection. Definitely worth the time and money!"
"Got this bottle from HotterThanHell. After spending the week in Bavaria this beer is a shock to the system. No subtlety here, this is an AIPA and nothing else. Pours a cloudy orange with a good creamy white head. Has a very strong citrus hop smell (that I like). Taste is that of an AIPA but incredibly smooth. Very malty with a citrus hop kick. Not too bitter in the end but very enjoyable. The 7% ABV is a little noticable aftter finishing a whole bomber."
"D - easy to drink, as abv is hidden well."
"Overall- A session IPA without a doubt. I polished off a bomber in 10 minutes."
"Beer poured a golden amber color with a well-sustained white head. Nose is of wonderful floral hops that allude to what is about to happen next. Taste is slightly malty to start but those malts are quickly overrun by a blast of those northwest grapefruity hops. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and glides very nicely across the palate. Overall drinkability is near perfect. This is an excellent example of the west coast ipa style which is one of the best values out there given the cost."
"D: Brilliant taste and smooth body make it easy to drink. Much cheaper than I expected, too, adding to it's appeal. I'll be getting this regularly."
"D: I can't think of too many situations in which I would want to drink this. Overall, a middling experience. Perhaps I had a bad batch."
"D: This one is really fun to drink, a brew that is on the lighter side of medium and not too boozy either in heat or in effect (if you know what I mean). Bomber is the perfect size for this one and would try this again in the future. Can't wait to try the Racer X whenever that might be."
"D- totally drinkable and tasty IPA, must try, well brewed"
"a little thin since it's very alcoholic, but not an unpleasent at all. Balance masks the alcohol. Incredibly drinkable and enjoyable. Would be dangerous on tap."
"Overall: pretty cool. Racer 5 is most certainly an acceptable & worthy AIPA. ItÂs on the stronger/hoppier side of the IPA spectrum. I like that itÂs on yeast."
"D: Excellent. If I were to try and create the perfect highly drinkable IPA, I think this would be it. It's tasty without being heavy. There's hoppy bitterness without it being too much. Like I said: nicely balanced. Extremely drinkable, especially for a 7% ABV beer. Enjoy."
"D - I'll have another please. Quite drinkable."
"Drinkability- Easy with regard to the strength... the initial honeymoon, however, fades rather quickly and it gradually becomes much more ordinary in its overall presentation."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in the ""new"" Sam Adams Boston Lager glass, the beer pours a clear light amber color with an inch frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. Aroma is mainly citrusy (grapefruit) hops and caramel malt, very nice. It tastes like citrusy and piney hops, with some malt noticable in there too. Finishes with a nice bitter hoppy aftertaste which lingers around a while. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit oily/slick. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a very good and refreshing IPA, I'd definitely buy it again, it's worth the money."
"This one tastes strong for a 7%er but it's still a great beer for a night of imbibing."
"Some reason makes me think this beer is old cause it doesnt deem a ""Outstanding"" to me atleast.This sorda taste like aged SN Celebration.That was the first taste that came to my mind.I would like to sample a fresh bottle or try this from a tap."
"I could drink this beer all night and all day. Very nice. Don't know how this beer is in the bottle, but it is one hell of a treat on tap."
"Try Crystal Wit or Racer X if you ever see it, some of the best beer I had this summer"
"By no means a bad beer, it's just not my favorite IPA. The real problem is the price. For a few dollars more I can get union jack ipa or ruination, for a few dollars less I can get mission street, alaskan, or torpedo ipa, and for the same price I can get celebration ipa."
"Sign of a truly pleasing beer? My girlfriend, who DESPISES hops (I'm working on that, trust me...), actually enjoyed this one."
"In comparison to the Hop Rod Rye, I prefer this one a little more (although I should point out I had this one on-tap, the Hop Rod came from a bomber). It doesn't have the dryness of that, but the flavor is a bit more tasty."
"Very good, I enjoyed this one."
"Overall, it's my favorite all around IPA, and I am lucky to be able to find fresh, affordable six packs in the bay area... Thank you Bear Republic, always consistent, amazing brews from you guys."
"Recently had a Racer 5 at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth, ma. A nice IPA from Bear Republic Brewing from California. I definately expected a little more hoppy aroma than I got when I too my first wiff of the brew, but it did much better on taste. I nice strong american IPA mouth feel and great hop finish. May not be the best IPA I have ever had, but definately better than a lot that I have had in the past."
"Very nice IPA, very drinkable, despite the strength. Just as much a hop explosion as Dogfish Head's, but whereas theirs tend to be heavy beers to savor, this is one to be quaffed."
"Needless to say, I was very hoppy with this one. The color was a beautiful copper color with a pure white head and several floaties in the bottom of the glass. The smell and taste were pure hops, but that's what we buy these for now isn't it? It was extremely smooth and drinkable for a hop bomb and will definately have to revisit this one again."
"My first journey to Bear Republic was fantastic. I must try other offerings"
"D- This is a very good IPA. I loved the smell and it was well-balanced, not overpowering."
"Another great product from Bear Republic! Although I've had this beer several times on tap, I actually prefer the bottle. Both are excellent; however, I prefer this beer slightly warmer than the standard bar-serving temperature (about 44*F, instead of 40*F). I think it brings out a slightly maltier taste and also helps emphasize the hop flavor. Pours a nice copper color with a nice compact head. Aroma and flavor is mainly citrus, with pine notes in the background. Mouthfeel is regular - nothing notable or otherwise. I love drinking this beer with my spicy chicken gumbo."
"Purchased at Stateline. Amber in color. Pours with some foam that settles quickly. Big hoppy smell & taste which is mostly citrus. A classic West Coast IPA. Mouthfeel is smooth and this is a very drinkable IPA. Cheers to Bear Republic for making an affordable and available excellent IPA. It is even better on tap than the bottle to boot."
"22oz bottle into a pint glass. This beer filled the room with a very nice hop aroma. Citricy hops. That, along with the beautiful head and slight cloudyness of the beer made me real excited about the first sip. The taste is very complex. Very good. The bitterness lingers nicely. One thing I look for when tasting an IPA is the ballance between the Bitterness and Sweetness. The bitterness of this IPA does overpower the malt. The sweetness of the malt is subtle. But, since I'm a hop-head! This is just fine for me!"
"Pours amber with a sizeable head that looks great. Sticks and laces like the best of em. Smells of strong hops, grapefruit rind, citrus, a little dried fruit. Tastes delicious. Lots of hops complimented by citrus fruit and a little malt. Finishes dry and a little hop bitterness, fantastic. Feels medium in the mouth and extremely drinkable. Strong characteristics for a single IPA with perfect drinkability. Sessionable, you bet your sweet butt. Ill be coming back to this one many times."
"pours out a faded, clear copper with a thinnish head and loads of raised, bumpy lacing. Aroma up front is a hop assault of grapefruit peels and fresh mowed grass. A caramel malty backbone is there, but the hops are running this. Flavor starts off sweetish with toffee and fruity esters, accompanied by a Bear Republic house flavor. Hops come in with loads of pine resin, grapefruit, and aspirin. Finishes really bitter with that lingering aspirin flavor. Mouthfeel is a tad light compared to other IPAs, but, on the other hand, it helps the drinkability. Smooth carbonation."
"Pours a somewhat hazy burnt copper hue with a nice two finger fluffy white head that dies down to a thin layer. Stickiness is all over the place, just how I like 'em. Smell is a nice citrus burst, mostly orange and pineapple. Noticable caramel malt in the nose as well. Taste is a very crisp citrus hop with a hint of dirty pine hop as well. Midway there is a good biscuity malt balance. This one finishes somewhat dry and a bit creamy too. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Pretty solid west coast hop bomb of an IPA, glad this is easily available here in CNY."
"I pledge allegiance to the checkered flag of Racer 5 and to the Bear Republic for which it stands, one brewer underdog, independent, with deliciousness and hops for all."
"Hazy golden-orange..particles of yeast (some rather large) seem at home floating about. Bold floral hop aroma that demands attention. Orange & lemon flavors thrown in the mix as well. The grainy malt flavor actually has much more staying power than I remember this beer having. It's been over two years since I've had had a Racer 5, and I gotta say, I think I should be drinking this more often..just wish I could find the damn thing within 1000 miles. A beer deserving of it's many accolades."
"Overall this totally lived up to my expectations. It was just great. I would love to have this again and again. I am glad I have a couple more bottles. Just a damn fine IPA if I have ever had one."
"Moderately high carbonation makes for a crisp, clean finish. Refreshing and fruity. Well balanced and a nice summer IPA."
"Pours a cloudy orange amber color with a big loose head that resists fading. Good lacing generated. The smell is big too...orange citrus, pine and grapefruit. Very sweet smelling. Full bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated, smooth and creamy. It complements the full fruity hop flavor and is balanced nicely by a solid malt character. This is a really good drinker. Well done."
"Overall a really good ipa, bottle conditioned to boot. Bitterness dries out the mouth so keep a glass of water handy."
"D: Expecting more of a hop bomb, I was surprised by the calm nature of this IPA, and would gladly have more. Bringing out the lighter side of this style makes for a great take on a style that can be overly bitter. Nicely done."
"Poured from a 650ml bottle with no dating info into a pint glass at proper temp. It was a hazy orange color with modest visible carb. It had a small head that settled to a constant, broken film. Good lacing. The aroma was strong floral hops, some pine. Really had a good smell to it. The taste was solid. Good bite of hops with a great malty backing. Very well balanced. No overly bitter finish. Great creamy mouthfeel with good carb. Overall, an outstanding beer that will see some more time in my fridge. Glad that Bear Republic is finally in Texas. Highly recommend. (4.5, RR, T, Y)"
"Taste is lovely but less hoppy than I imagined. Hops are licoricelike and a bit piney and floral, but there's a very healthy balance of malty sweetness that has some nice vanilla and cakelike sweetness. Lemon peel bitterness rounds it off. Medium body and medium carbonation. This is a drinkable and balanced IPA, and a really lovely sipper for a chilly SF evening."
"22oz bomber pours med-light amber with a dense rocky head. Looks great. Smells like lemon iced tea and a piney fresh hop. Spicey hop flavor that's upfront, big and fresh. Malt flavor is big to match. A toasted marshmallow(golden not black) caramelization. Fruitiness sneaks through with canned peach and apricot. Is there rye in this beer because it has a very spicey flavor? Slight bourbon comes and goes late in the fading finish. Overall it's big, bIG, BIG. Aftertaste is excellent and keeps you going back for the next sip. Big and aggressive but still somehow balanced to make an exciting flavor and aroma profile. Easy to drink, huge IPA."
"The Racer 5 IPA poured a golden copper liquid with a thick fluffy head that lingered and left a fair amount of lacing. Smell is strong piney hops. Some citrus notes as well. Some sweet malts. Taste is all hops, and quite wonderful. The hops are piney with grapefruit tones. An awesome tasting IPA. The malt is almost nondescript due to the hop overload. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, with a bit of the piney resin leaving the hops on the palate. I found this to be one of the most drinkable IPA's that I have tried in a while. Outstanding!"
"Pours a golden red hue with a huge head that seems like it would stay forever. The smell is sweet, hoppy, notes of pine and berries. The taste is very full, bitter bready, pine. Mouthfeel is very thick with quite a bit of carbonation. This beer seems drinkable enough for an IPA. The bitterness makes me just want to sip on it but all in all a good brew."
"Overall Bear Republic put together one of the best West Coast IPA's I have tried."
"A beefed up IPA with wondeful flavors and body. One of my favorite Cali IPA's without a doubt."
"Overall, a very nice ipa. A nice flavored ipa when i want a heavy citrusy hop craving."
"D - VERY easy drinking beer. Not too much going on in the taste, its nonabrasive, creamy and simple. A simple tasting IPA, with strangely high alcohol (not detectable). It would have amazing sessionability if the alcohol weren't so high. I could see drinking 5 or 6 of these if that were the case."
"This is a great beer, a quintessential example of the west coast style. Next time I drink this, I will be sucking them down and probably getting drunker then I should, rather then take to much time breaking it down, because it's very good and every sip just beckons another."
"D: I could have this with anything!"
"Poured out of the bomber and into an American pint glass. The beer is a deep golden/light amber color. Chunky, frothy head and very active carbonation. It smells like sweet grapefruit, chlorophyll, and apples. The taste is pleasant. The hops aren't as explosive as the smell hinted at leaving a very smooth, yet dry mouthfeel. Dry and bitter up front with sweeter, more forgiving citrus in the middle followed by a very sharp bitter grassy taste at the very end. Smooth and rich flavor profile, not overly teeming with flavor keeping it light and refreshing. Slight alcohol heat after a few more drinks. Great example of an American IPA. Quite similar to Southern tier IPA."
"D: Very good, a delicious example of the West Coast IPA style, its balanced character makes it a good anytime beer, the alcohol level does not show at all. Another great offering from the fellas at Bear Republic."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, but not exactly sessionable due to the fairly high ABV."
"Pouring with a super massive over the top meringue like head, this reddish topaz brew shows lots of sediment and all the good stuff left in, relatively unusual for an IPA. This is a great beer; beautifully balanced piney and citric hops and huge malting make for an IPA with all the right elements to make this a very refreshing and very impressive brew. Careful metering of the ingredients result in an IPA that is properly and proportionally put together. Everlasting, never ending, and lip smacking sticky hop sensations last for minutes in the mouth and tongue. This is a brew made to a recipe that reflects integrity, ingenuity and restraint resulting in a beer that is well beyond the sum of its parts. Bravo!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, nice kick, good representation of style, this beer is certainly on the lighter side for an IPA, but it works very well. I could definitely stick with this beer for a full evening."
""
"Poured from the bomber into one of my DFH tulip pint glasses. The Racer 5 delivers a brightly colored orange/amber body with a full-bodied, off-white head. Sticky lace remnants cling to the sides of the glass as the beer recedes, and the foamy head soon dies down, leaving thick, clumpy foam globules in the middle of the beer. I like what I see so far. The nose on this beer is bold and hoppy, with strong grapefruit and pine scents being the most recognizable. Also apparent are some malty cut-grass scents, and other resiny citrus smells. The taste is tart and tangy up front, with a nice malt balance in the middle, and a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish that lingers for a while. More pine than citrus in the overall taste, with some light fruity esters permeating throughout. Mouthfeel is sturdy. A nice, strong IPA here. Even modest fans of hops might find a few things to enjoy here, and devout hopheads should definitely seek this out as yet another addition to the repertoire. Bold and refreshing, but unoffensive. An all-season beer, in my opinion."
"T: very solid. i got a 22ozer at the bar. it tasted very nice, with some hops and a slight fruit citrus taste but nothing overwhelming. it was less bitter and more light than i expected but was extremely drinkable because of this. is was very enjoyable"
"This is a very drinkable IPA. Not overly bitter. I'd have this one again."
"D: A very drinkable IPA due to the great flavor of the hops. Not a lot of bitterness in this brew so it goes down east. A classic IPA in my book, one of the best out there."
"update: have had this many times since it's release in 6ers and it hasn't been as impressive as in the bomber format. hops have seemed faded in both aroma and taste, leading it to be a bit on the sweetish side and overall not quite as impressive. Have even started seeing some particulates."
"D- high, could drink a ton if i wanted"
"Very cloudy orange color, with a very substantial head that goes the extra mile. Smell is lively west coast IPA all the way, pine & citrus. Taste is typical, nothing out of the ordinary. Big, cloying nugget hops dominate. Mouthfeel is rich and sticky. Not in love with this one. It's well-executed and all, but pales (sorry) in comparison to offerings from some other west coast micros. I loved the Hop Rod, but found this rather one-dimensional and not terribly interesting."
"Pours a nice orange-ish hue, and a white head. Hops in the aroma, somewhat smell like pine. A nice malt that leaves a sweet presence, pine like hops, and a nice dry finish. A very tasty beer, I wish this would be a bit easier to get around here. I think that it would a regular staple beer for me."
"This is a west coast IPA. It's a not so subtle, highly hopped beer that may scare the uninitiated, but is a good choice for the hop-heads."
"All in all, this was a hop monster, pure and simple. While the 7% ABV was rather well hidden, I found my tolerance for the lack of balance and overwhelming bitterness waning from the very start. I really had a difficult time finishing this one. Definitely a beer to be enjoyed only by a true hop head."
"This is a great West Coast IPA. Distinctive, substantial and even addicting by some standards. This one gets my recommedation for sure."
"An excellent IPA. I'd rank it second only to Moonlight's Bombay by Boat."
"The mouth is medium thick, with excellent carbonation, just enough to keep things lively. This is an easy drinking, stimulating IPA that I could see myself trying every once and a while, despite the fact that I often don't like the style."
"Downed this one after mowing an acre of lawn and it was really sweet. Gotta get some water now to balance the body but if I could thrive on this, I would do so gladly."
"This is a good, refreshing IPA. Not quite as ""big"" as advertised on the bottle."
"D: This one reminds me an awful lot of Two-Hearted, and it's consistently as good. A must try."
"Overall a very nice beer - I admit that I prefer the Hop Rye a little more regardless this is an outstanding session beer. Props to ""From the Vine"" on Polaris and Old State - for continually bringing in new and interesting beers."
"This beer is absolutely outstanding. Pours a dark straw color with a tan, creamy head, that follows the body down to the end of the glass. Nose is of sweet, sticky, pine needles..really a great smelling brew. High hop concentration but balanced by some rich malt which gives it tremendous balance. Great summer thirst quencher!"
"Good body and carbonation. Very nice here. A solid IPA. Glad to see it in Ohio now."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Carbonation and abv are pretty much ideal. I really think I could almost session this beer. It's that drinkable. Overall, it's an excellent IPA. Clearly one of favorites in this style. Highly recommended."
"Pours a deep golden with a slight orange/copper hue. It is pretty clear with a generous off-white head that disspipated leaving a thin but noticeable lace. The aroma is of hops, floral, but not overly citrusy. I smell some piney, resiny hop notes. I get an initial hop flavor that gives way to the malt, but finishes nice and dry. The hop aroma builds as I near the half pint mark. This beer has very good everything, but excellent nothing. A very good all aroung IPA, just not quite with the truly great ones."
"Overall impression: Understated. An approachable West Coast IPA. Seems a tad one dimensional. May benefit from a more complex grain bill but nothing off here. Well done."
"Drinkability is pretty high despite the 7% ABV. Man, I think I have a new favorite IPA. This is very well balanced, flavorful and refreshing. Highly recommended. Bottoms up!"
"I would drink this regularly if it came in sixers, but it doesn't so I won't."
"Pours a golden amber with a huge rocky head and chunky lacing. Aroma is mildy sweet malts and floral hops. Taste is floral and grapefruit with a lot of sweet malts. Not nearly as aggressive as I expected. Much more drinkable than many bigger IPAs. The sweet aftertaste leaves your mouth watering for another sip. Extremely sessionable, excellent IPA."
"Cheers!"
"D- I had three pints, and can't get enough. Unfortunately, at 7% ABV I cannot have many."
"A big thanks to Talisker for letting me try this top-notch beer. I poured it out and fell in love immediately. Amber in color with a reddish hue that tells me this one means business. Somewhat hazy after the second pour leaving a mammoth creamy head and superb lacing. Carbonation is on point as well. Hops burst through, mostly piney and a small hint of citrus in the background. More hop attack on the first sip which is well balanced by malts. It's a bigger hoppy flavor for an IPA which is rather refreshing to me. Tingly, yet smooth mouthfeel. I almost started to gargle but swallowed instead. This beer is great in all categories and I could probably have a couple bombers. For what it is, this is one hell of a beer and one that I would love to get my hands on more often."
"I've had this bomber sitting around a long time, and finally got around to drinking it yesterday. Fortunately, old age seemed to have no ill effects. A very straightforward, blatantly American IPA, but a good one; I imagine this would be a nice drink on a summer evening. Powerful grapefruit-heavy aroma and flavour, with some other citrus fruits and pine thrown in. Nice, although I'm not sure I'd choose it over some more interesting IPAs."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, despite high alpha acids; well-balanced and hides the alcohol well. The finish is a tad much for me towards the end of the glass. That being said, I could still drink a couple of these, although it would have to be toward the end of the evening, so that I don't suffer palate fatigue."
"Smooth and even buttery with a bitter ending; bite at the finish. Thickens as it warms, just excellent. Bitter. Creamy. Excellent. A complex IPA."
"It's smooth texture and pleasant hop character make this a very unique and tasty Pacific IPA. By far my favorite Bear Republic offering which is saying a lot."
"On tap at the Bodega March 26, 2007. The smell of delicious grapefruity goodness from the cascade hops hits you as soon as the pint reaches your nose. Pours a deep, cloudy orange with a thick full head. The flavor is a wonderful mix of citris overtones followed by the hop bite on the sides of the tongue that is pronounced yet doesn't linger. Highly drinkable, would be a great ""session I.P.A.", which is probably an oxymoron, if not for the 7.0% ABV."
"Taste updated to 4.5."
"Bear republic. Racer 5. On tap o briens. Poured a nice dark golden hue with a nice fluffy head. Smell is citric hops. Taste is well balanced between the malt and the great citric hop bitterness. The hops dominate the aftertaste in a very pleasent way. For a hophead this a mild bitterness but perfect for a warm sunny day. This is a superior ipa."
"A bit of a cloudy orangish, amber color. It has a nice and thick white head which dissapates fairly quickly leaving excellent lacing. The smell is not overly strong but is of citrus. The taste is citrus and a little pine with a slightly bitter back taste. The body feel is medium. Easy to drink and goes down quickly for me. This is a very fine example of a strong IPA. I wish it was easier to get here in eastern PA."
"Hazy orange with a medium head. Low head retention. Good lacing. Aroma of citrus and pine hops and caramel malt. Flavor is moderately sweet and bitter at the back end. Medium to full body. Slightly astringent. Another fine example of a west coast IPA."
"Overall- one of the best IPAs I have had. I will have to go back and do a horizontal tasting with my other favs, but it may actually be the best for me."
"IPA is my favorite style along with Double IPA This tends to affect my scores. This one came from a 22 oz bottle. Love that label. Deep golden color tending toward amber with a rich and foamy off white head. Aroma of hops with citrus in the background. Nice feel in the mouth and a very fresh taste that makes this a pleasure to drink. Finish is hoppy, with just the correct bitterness. The alcohol is present but is again well balanced with the malts and hops. An excellent IPA, and for me is about as good as a beer can get. We have a lot of great IPAÂs around here. I guess it is time for a blind tasting IPA party to sort out the very best."
"22oz. bottle poured dark gold with some slow bubbles and a spongy white head that sticks to the glass. Smells of citrusy hops and taste much the same with some orange, tangerine flavors and a rather mellow sweet, bitter grapefruit. The feel is slightly watery at first and is followed by a bit of a dry bitterness that makes me want another sip. I find this IPA to be very easy to drink due to it not being as much of a bitter hop blast than some and it is also very thirst quenching."
"If one wanted to drink IPA's all night this would be a good one."
"D - Pretty good. I wouldn't say this is fantastic, but it is undoubtedly a solid IPA from Bear Republic."
"Wow- the aromas alone were enough for a perfect score. Strong pushy citrus hop presence throughout, but very complex. What a tasty hop filled IPA! Almost perfect balance with the slightly spicy malt, nice body and sweetness. A little oily on the finish, but what else can you expect. Hops are strong, but no annoying burning aftertaste, your palate will be safe and satisfied. Extra smooth going down and the light ABV and masterful blending makes this one a very sessionable IPA."
"12 oz. bottle- color of hazy amber , with a medium lacy white head - nose of tar , resin , great hopps , grapefruit , and slightly malty Â taste of tar , resin , great hopps , and grapefruit , and slightly sour/ bitter - body creamy butt resiny, and mildly carbonatedÂ aftertaste of resin , tar , hopps"
"Drinkability: I could easily drink 3 or 4 of these in an evening...but I'd probably pay for it the next day. This is not a light beer, and probably wouldn't be the best choice for a session beer, no matter how badly you want it to be. Besides not being a wimpy IPA, this beer is entirely drinkable!"
"Pours a hazy orange with a thick frothy head that sticks around pretty well and leaves plenty of lacing. Smells of piney hops with a nice solid malt background. Nothing mind blowing but smells great. Taste is near perfect I think. Perfect hop and malt balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and refreshing. Drinkability is awesome. Hops dont overpower, alchohol is masked and it keeps flowing. This is one of my favorite beers. Probably one of the beers that I buy most often. I am a fan of all the Bear Republic beers I have had so far and this is no exception."
"This here IPA is one good west coast example - good malt body, but not too sweet or sticky to get in the way of the dominant hop profile - lots of sweet, fresh sticky green hops here. It's halfway to being a double IPA, or these days ""west coast"" style about sums it up. Back east here we don't always get regular fresh supplies of hoppy west coast goodness, but when we do, we must keep drinking it over and over until it gets fully impressed on our minds. Only then can we return to defensively enjoying our ""well-balanced"" east coast beers."
"D: A perfect example of the West Coast IPA: Full of flavor and impeccably balanced. Wickedly clean and refreshing. A true session beer for the hop lover!"
"drinkability is excellent. you'd never guess this one is 7%. delicious and very well balanced. fantastic."
"What are you waiting for? Racer 5 defines the style."
"Drinkability: In all honesty, this reminds me of Avery's Maharaja with the Racer 5 being just a bit more drinkable."
"Poured out a slightly orangey honey gold color with a HUGE foamy off white head. The nose offered grapefruit, spice, yeast, green hops. The taste is mostly yeast to me, backed by malt, then with lots of oily hop resin bringing up the rear. Has a slightly crisp mouthfeel and is pretty drinkable, hiding the 7% very well."
"Quality consistency, not to thick. Hop head here so I could drink this anytime a beer is called for."
"Racer 5 India Pale Ale pours a light copper color with a white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. It has a nice, hoppy aroma that is somewhat floral. The taste is definitely dominated by hops, once again of a somewhat floral nature. The flavor really falls somewhere between a typical ipa and a double ipa. The malt is definitely in the background, but does a nice job of balancing this beer. An enjoyable beer."
"D- I have had a lot of HopBombs and this is one of the best. Some leave too much resin and no sweetness to balance out the beer. This one is great and would have it again and again."
"The flavors were hops, hops, and more hops. Some hints of grassiness and some smells and flavors that remind you that the hop plant is related to the hemp plant. Rich, aromatic, yummy. Enough malt to balance it (if you're a hophead), but not enough to distract from the main attraction. The mouthfeel was medium-light, the finish was clean and bitter and flavorful, the beer was not just drinkable, it was gulpable, inhalable, guzzlable. I Coulda woulda shoulda got another one, BUT I as in a 30-tap establishment and I felt the need to sample more of their offerings. But I will look for this again, in bottle, on tap, whereever, whenever. Recommended, for sure."
"The taste is a virtual explosion of hops that starts with a fruity pine and ends with a bitter grapefruit bite, along with a creamy, buttery aftertaste that was present in the nose. It's very complex and very well rounded, a noteworthy combination...giving a bold quality that is ideal for this style of IPA. Mouthfeel is perfect: Full and bubbly and easy all the way down. Drinkability is great too, although this brew is definitely more of a sipper because the taste is so rich. I would definitely drink this one again."
"D - As I mentioned earlier, this is exactly what I expect from an IPA. My favorite style has become a DIPA, but they're obviously not too drinkable because of the high ABV. This would make for a perfect session beer and one of my top after-work selections."
"It poured a copper/amber color with a fairly abundant head with good staying power (and left nice lacing). Aroma is Cascade/citus hop goodness, but is not overpowering (BTW - I like overpowering Cascade/citrus-ness). Taste is more of the same; assertively citrus-y, but not really powerful flavor. Mouthfeel is good, but not overly sticky. I liked this beer, but with so many wonderful choices in this category, I have a hard time putting it at the top of the stack."
"D: The balance makes the drinkability high with this one. The wonderful hops and subdued malt are an exercise in expert balance. Good thing this beer has excellent distribution in IL."
"I would consider this as high on the drinkability scale as 7.0 abv would allow. This is a very enjoyable IPA and I would look forward to having another if offered."
"This is one of the best American IPA's I have tried..get one."
"Very nice beer. An orange color with a fairly thick, sticky head. It had a floral aroma, with a little bit of grapefruit. Nicely hopped, not too aggressive. Good in the mouth, again kind of understated. This is an IPA to enjoy. Certainly will have this again."
"Poured from a bomber courtesy of HogtownHarry of ratebeer. Pours a beautiful golden classic IPA colour with a nice thick white creamy head. Smell is very floral. Smell reminds of Stone IPA. Taste is very balanced with a fantastic hoppy sweet malt backbone. Very flavourful and aromatic. Everything one could want in an IPA. Medium carbonation and extremely quaffable. I could drink this every day. A wonderful classic west coast IPA."
"There was more malt sweetness up front than I anticipated. Nice!! It was quicklu and wonderfully offest by citrus sweeping in as expected. Nice mouthfeel, a quaffable beer. Would love to try it on tap."
"Bottle (Courtesy of Hogtownharry): Poured a dark beige color ale with a big foamy head with good retention. Aroma of fresh citrusy hops is totally dominating. Taste is also dominated by fresh C-hops and can be best describe as chewing on a grapefruit. This is truly the most ÂÂgrapefruitÂÂ I have experience in an IPA. While this is a very interesting beer, it is also a one-dimensional beer lacking complexity IMO."
"The first sip really coats the mouth with a lot of hop flavor and essence. Balanced by the citrus flavor that was in the nose. There is some malt presence, but make no mistake this one is about the hops. It has a nice medium mouthfeel, and a smooth yet spicy finish. The beer for this review came from a bottle, but I've since tried it on tap and it is even better. Outstanding IPA, stands up well to the likes of Stone."
"I've also had this from the bottle and it is equally good."
"This beer's been around for a while and anyone who sips a pint will surely hope that it stays for some time to come. An American classic."
"Its reputation precedes it, and it does not disappoint. It's full, lively, balanced, blended, and damned good. The ABV is moderate, but aptly wrapped inside a very drinkable offering. So, Trixie cries, Go Speed, beat the Acrobatic Team! Oh, and bring me another Racer 5, too!"
"Mouthfeel- Is chock full of pleasant bitterness, but just lacing that balance needed between malts and hops to be a great IPA."
"I'd be happy to quaff several pints of this at my local were it to be found on tap. But it's not, so I'll have to be content to pencil Bear Republic into the itinerary of the long anticpated, perhaps mythical vacation I'd like to make at somepoint amongst northern California's brewpubs."
"Drinkable?...I could have spent the night with this one."
"Quite simply, I could sip this stuff all night."
"Pours a hazy orange with lots of carbonation rising to a great, thick creamy head on top. Exploding aromas of citrus, pine and alcohol on the nose that beg for sniff after sniff. Just enough malt flavor to balance it out but still feature the great hops. I had this six hours ago and I can still smell and taste it. Sit down with a big bowl of chili with this one!!!! Bear Republic continues to impress me."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a plus sized medium body. The beer is aggressively carbonated and prickly. The flavors are long lasting. This is a dam fine and tasty IPA. The beer was very easy to drink. I had problems setting this beer down. I could session this over the course of an evening."
"D - This Great IPA from Bear Republic is, to me, a catch 22. It is so good that I just have to have sip after sip, yet at the same time, so close to perfection that I want it to last as long as possible."
"I have always considered this one of the better made American IPA'.s It is a tad bit high on the alcohol compared to some others, but this is a very good and drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel is perfect and this is a pretty drinkable brew."
"Medium crisp body initially, then after a second the carbonation bubbles up and makes it feel creamy. I like dis. Nice balance between carbonation and body also. Very refreshing and drinkable. I'd like to have a 6-pack of this for a cookout in the summer."
"Medium bodied, extraordinarily drinkable. Definitely a four pinter."
"D - Very high. I enjoyed this beer immensely."
"The fact that this beer is readily available makes it even more appealing to me. If you can't find it, trade for it, call Liquid Solutions, do whatever you can to try it. A truly great offering!"
"This beer pours a golen amber with a frothy and rocky white head that holds fantastically well and leaves tons of lace. The smell is very sweet with tons of citrus hops. The taste is full hop bitterness and flavor but malty enough to not overwhelm you. There was also a bit of piney hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with nice natural carbonation. Overall a highly drinkable IPA, one of the best IPAs out there."
"This is a big IPA, and it's good. But for me, it doesn't live up to the hype."
"Outstanding and delicious Â IÂm in IPA Heaven!"
"Drinkability- Quite drinkable for a strong IPA. One that would be worth having/seeking out again."
"Poured a deep gold color almost orange. Huge clumpy head that slowly dissolved with peaks and valleys. Deep piney citrus aroma. This IPA is impressive right out of the gate Sweet malt body and mouthfeel with an intense bitterness that dominates but is still balanced. This is a killer IPA that gives you everyting= Killer aroma, great malt body with a wide variety of hop aromas, flavors from the beginning to the finish. This is my first beer from Bear Republic and I am impressed. Almost sessionable for hop-heads and at 7%, not too alcohol heavy. A CHOICE offering."
"I had this one over the summer at Redbones, and I gotta say that I wasn't exactly impressed with it. Everything deserves a second chance though right? So anyway, this one pours a sort of plain amber color. What made it really pleasing is that the head sticks to the glass like crazy, along with the just barely visible sediment floating here and there. Smell at first seemed slightly metallic, then with another whiff, gave way to some citrusy aromas, really juicy smell. The citrus is accompanied in the taste by a literal attack of hops on the palate. These are some really aggressive hops, that never quite seem to end. The initial citrusy presence seems to end with a more earth based ending. The mouthfeel is medium in body. Drinkability is great, but i guess thats assuming that you really like hops, cause this one definitely has them. Im really glad I gave this beer a second chance. I think i will get it again folks."
"Drinkability: This is one of the better IPAs that I have had. This is a hoppy beer but it's no hop bomb, just a very refeshing ans tasty IPA.. I saw this beer in lots of liquor stores, and beer stores and even the local grocery stores many times yet never tried it. My advise to you: pick one up!!! You will not be let down, I could drink this everyday."
"Opinion: I am not a hophead, but I am really impressed with this beer. Yea, it has the essential huge hop character, but it still remains drinkable. I don't really know what else to say. This is a pretty fricking good beer, and I would certainly drink it again. Nuff said!"
"I can't believe I ddn't pick up more of this beer. This has to be my favorite IPA that I've had so far."
"This beer pours a clear golden amber with a giant foamy head. The lacing is great and this has a ton of carbonation. The smell is all citrus hop aromas that are very nice. A nice American IPA that doesn't go crazy with hops. don't get me wrong,this is hoppy,but it's not overly bitter. The citrus flavor and aromas dominate this beer. The taste is very crisp with light bitterness and a very drinkable citrus flavor,grapefruit? This is a truely great beer that should not be missed. A 7% beer that could be a session beer. Cheers."
"D: Definitely a hop-bomb, but I love that. The malt sweetness disappeared as I drank, but that's just a function of palate destruction. I really, really liked downing this bomber. Tomorrow after work, I will really enjoy downing another."
"Easy drinking. No problems with the bomber. I will seek this out again."
"CONDITIONS: MOWING/WORKING ON CAR- nWITH FRIENDS- ySIPPING- yGET MY BUZZ ON- y"
"D: I could easily see myself downing a few pints at the local pub with this one. Bear Republic has never let me down and this IPA doesn't disappoint."
"Been wanting to try some of Bear Republic's offerings for awhile, and my trip to San Francisco has finally enabled me to do so. Racer 5 did not disappoint. An excellent IPA that I'll definitely enjoy a few more times before I leave the Bay Area."
"Upon opening a strong fruity, floral aroma emerges. Noticeable across the room. Intense alpha acid sting follows the fruitiness. It's like an intense hop garden. I'm sure there's malt and yeast there but the hoppy smell is amazing. Pours a hazy orangish color with a large off white sticky head. Head maintains well. Good lacing. Taste is strong bitter at first but soon subsides into a complexity which is quite nice. Lots of herbal character and piney grapefruit hops in the middle. A touch of sweet fruit rides the entire wave. Almost apple like, maybe grapes too. A touch of toffee, some banana. It's complex but straighforward at the same time. Hops control. Bitterness never relents its hold at the top. Depth though is outstanding. Finish is long and dry and bitter. Just all around enjoyable. This is how an IPA should taste like."
"Drinkability: For those of us who love hops this thing is going to go down easy and fast. Buy a few of them."
"Pours golden amber, with high lights around the edges. Pure white head that is decent, looks as though it might stay a while. Smell is floral, mild bitter hops presence, some citrus, maybe even hints of pine apple and mango. Taste is well balanced, bitter hops and mild spices shine through the fruit favors nicely finishes with a hint of bitterness right before the fruit. A little sticky, but just the right amount. This is a swell beer, I was a little thrown buy the packaging's unappetizing colors scheme, but once I tasted the beer I could careless. This is a super IPA, one of the better California beers I've had. I will definitely be drinking this in the future.."
"Served a just under room temp. Many thanks to Dertbert for the bomber."
"Thank You!!! Dertbert"
"D - As I said before, this is a staple to me. If some how I could only be stuck drinking one beer fort he rest of my life (perish the thought) this would be it. I love Racer 5. I had a solid appreciation for beer for many years, but this is the beer that turned me into a geek. Thank you Bear Republic."
"Truly an all-round GREAT beer!"
"Thanks to jj21 for this fine beer."
"Drinkability: An all around fine IPA; not out there like some more recent IPA concoctions but excellent, nonetheless"
"A nice piney resin flavor hits the taste buds first, followed by a softening citrus sweetness. A nice dry woodsy finish wraps it all up. A good offering in the IPA department, though not the best I've ever sampled."
"D- Great beer. It is one of my favorite IPA's. Really wish I could get it here."
"Poured a hazy copper color with a medium sized off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma was piney, and full of orange and grapefruit citrus. A very nice aroma. Taste was dominated by grapefruit hops taste. Seemed very abrasive with the hops and alcohol and a little more malt would have made this world class."
"Widely available around here. I often overlook it. This one, and the Hop Rod Rye, should not be missed. Cheers."
"Not the biggest beer out there, but very good. Well balanced beer, in my opinion. This makes it very drinkable. If Racer 5 were available in my area, I would definitely purchase it again."
"Middle-of-the-road mouthfeel, with a very comfortable alcohol level. This is a pretty drinkable beer for a serious IPA with plenty of booze. A winner."
"D: A very interesting IPA. This is definatly something I would get again when in the mood for something as odd as this. As good as it is, not something I could drink a whole lot of. It was a little hard for me to finish the whole thing. I'm a huge fan of Thai food so I'm pretty stoked to find something that would go well with it, though I probably wouldn't get this under any other circumstances."
"Yet another kick ass California IPA. Packed with bitter, citric hops and yet well balanced. Thanks to Volo for offering such great American micros!"
"D: Solid westside IPA."
"This is a highly drinkable IPA, due to its extraordinary balance."
"I would love to have this beer as readily available as SNPA."
"This is a really good IPA. Very smooth and drinkable. Hops are aggressive, but not overpowering when compared to the malty fruitiness."
"Very nice beer, although not in the realm of the truly elite IPA's in my opinion. Still a great everyday IPA that is good drinking and won't break the bank. Recommended."
"Pours a hazy golden/orange, thick white head forms, lots of lacing, great retention, head lasts until the end. Smell is rad, pine and grapefruit up front, pineapple, toffee, citrus, superbly balanced. taste is grapefruit and pine, pineapple again, oranges, maybe some vanilla, nice and full flavoured. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low to medium carbonation, some warmth going down. Very clean bitterness in the finish, great balance. Excellent IPA."
"On the palate the peachy/apricot/mango whatever sweetness is quite pleasing, and of course the blast of hops to round things out. Surprisingly very drinkable for such a big IPA. Fuller bodied than I had expected. Preferably drink this one on its own. No food please."
"Without question one of the best AIPA's I've had, and as a highly-biased drinker of AIPAs to all other styles, that's saying something. If you lie this one, Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye is also a winner for many of the same reasons."
"Drinkability: I found this fairly drinkable due to the balancing in the taste. Also, I didn't detect a lick of alcohol, which is pretty impressive for a 7% abv. For some reason I get the feeling that this is better from the bottle."
"This is a very smooth and drinkable IPA, personally a little too soft for my tastes but nonetheless a good brew."
"D - A nice IPA that emphasizes the piney/grassy hops. This one goes down very easy for 7%."
"World Class."
"Overall: A very nice IPA. The toasty and bready malts balance but don't steal focus from the hops."
"Tasty and easy to drink, a very nice IPA."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" beige head over the clear golden amber brew. Pillowy head lasts nicely, with heavy but sporadic frothy lacing. Aroma is lightly lemony hops with an undercurrent of controlled sweetness. Taste is upfront a nicely balanced flavor of grains and citrus hops, which slowly gives way to allow the hops to gain center stage. Mouthfeel is smooth and clean, and drinkability is superb. One of the more controlled West Coast IPAs, I like it."
"Tastes mostly of grapefruit and pine, with some maraschino cherry again, and a slightly astringent, woody finish. Good bitterness, not over the top. On the dry side. No noticeable alcohol. A well balanced and refreshing IPA. Get a bottle!"
"D- Easily finished a bomber and wish it were a six pack. Great IPA offering and one that I would pick up again, also a bargain price."
"This beer is certainly enjoyable and certainly very drinkable, but it pales in comparison to others of the style. The beer's balance is quite good. I would have like some more assertive hop character and bitterness with this one. A good beer on the whole, but not high among my favorites for the style"
"Very nice beer overall, although I notice a trend in Bear Republic beers.... they all seem to use the same two or three hops. Not a bad thing, just something I noticed."
"D - Very drinkable for the marvelous flavors, though I'd probably stop at one due to the powerful hop kick."
"A fruity, juicy IPA...all out hops yet, this is far from one dimensional. Pure, fresh squeezed Cascade and Columbus hop juice. Top notch."
"I generally don't give 5s unless a beer just blows my mind, and Racer 5 is *just barely* below the border for this. But it's damn near perfect, and awfully close to 5s in every category."
"D - Great."
"This brew pours a cloudy orange color. The head is large, thick and somewhat creamy. The lacing is thorough and thick. The aroma is pleasing and rather complex with citrus and pine both being prominent. The taste leans a lot more toward pine than citrus. The mouthfeel is exceptional for an IPA. It is medium bodied and very creamy while still being very lively carbonated. Overall, this is a great IPA, one I wish was available in Minnesota."
"An orangeish amber color, with a creamy head with hints of brown in it. this head won't quit, all the way down. Bear Republic sure has it's head retention down! Great Hoppy IPA. Not the hoppiest, but a great solid IPA. Nice malty balance. Another very drinkable offering from Bear Republic!"
"All I can say is try this beer. Bear Republic bottles like NO ONE else and it is a pleasure to drink any of their beers."
"This is now up there with my favorite IPAs. Great balance with a lot to offer."
"Into a pint glass, pours somewhere between clear and translucent copper, with massive head and fluffy lacing. Has a really herbal earthy hop nose, a little remincent of a barley wine if you ask me, with pine and citrus and grapefruit, not too agressive, just right and quite nice. Taste is the same way, really earthy pine hop, a solid biscut malt base, with that same barley wine kind of hint in the aroma, perhaps from yeast?, with a slight bittering at the end. Either way, Really smooth and delicious mouth. Overall, just a really good beer."
"Disappointing experience, though. DATES ON THE BOTTLES, PEOPLE! PLEASE! There's no excuse not to."
"Comments: This was a very well balanced IPA. Great malty sweetness & hop finish not overbearing. Excellent!"
"Crystal clear pour aside from a distant haze. Perfect pour yields a nice off white head rising and falling to a nice cap on the brew. The color is a light amber/honey with some reds...very nice. The smell is very pronounced, citrus outwieghs the piney hop notes with a background of toasty malts and an almost varnishy, sweet cedar smell, if that makes any sense I do find it quite nice. The hops and toasted malts come together to form the cedar aroma. The taste is pure and clean smooth toasty malts in the beginning, citrus in the middle and both mixed with a subdued hop finish. Nice and well rounded. Somewhat unimpressive compared to the Hop Rod Rye from this brewer. But still a darn fine entry. The mouthfeel is quite nice if not a bit watery, overall it is quite good. Immensly drinkable and easily quaffable. The quasi-high levels of alcohol are masked very well and do not effect the taste but do sneak into the aroma. Try this one if you can."
"I likey this one, doesnÂt have the floral taste that I really donÂt care for in PAs/IPAs."
"This is a very tasty beer, but not for those who don't like hops."
"editing this review down as I could not even finish the bottle."
"Definitely worth the price of admission, all things considered."
"D - Very drinkable. This is my first BR brew. I've heard great things about Racer 5 and now I know why. This IPA is very tasty, one of the best I've ever had. I'm glad I bought 2 bombers."
"Certainly a sessionable IPA. I'd be more than glad to do so if I found it in sixers or on tap."
"The smell is overwhelmingly hops, and the flavor is mostly hops but with some malt balancing it slightly. Almost no bitterness in the after-taste, so it was really easy to drink. A very good IPA."
"Drinkability: It seems to be easy enough to make an IPA, but likewise it seems hard to make one that's singular in nature. This brew, however, is pretty awesome for the style. As I said, it's sweeter than most I've had, but for the balance it ends up working well. Still, if you're a hophead as far as the bitterness goes, you may not dig this as much."
"Very good mouthfeel and drinkability. I had no idea this was 7%, felt like any other good IPA. If I had this all night, I might end up on the floor."
"D: Tasty and fun to drink. I'm drinking it a bit too fast because it is so enjoyable."
"As I said, this beer might be on the old side. Not that it's gone bad mind you -- at 7% ABV it has a decent shelf life, but it seems to me that, as good as this beer is, it's likely even better and hop-licious when fresh."
"Poured a very pale orange color. Medium, white head, with plenty of lacing as the beer is consumed. Smell was mostly citrus with some peach flavors showing in the background. Taste was similar to the smell. Light to medium body and pretty drinkable. I have a tendency to get bored with hoppy beers after one or two of them, but this one kept my interest long enough that I would grab another."
"CRUX: AWSOME WEST COAST IPA. As Stone Ruination has become impossible to find around here, this has taken it's place in my DBF where it's ALWAYS at hand, and my world is all the richer... With this and their masterpiece ""Hop Rod Rye"" in their portfolio, Bear Republic is indeed a WORLD CLASS BREWERY. REALLY, REALLY GOOD STUFF: I wish my voice was loud enough to sing their praises. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"I thought this was highly drinkable. A little higher ABV but I polished off this whole bomber and wanted more. This is my first Big Bear brew, and I sure hope its not my last."
"Two hundred and fifty characters eh? Ok, um, dark amber, sort of like, beerish, color. Tastes like IPA. Great burp taste too. Do not discount that."
"Picked this up while on business in Maryland. Fair amount of hops in th earoma, but not a whole lot. Has a different hoppiness that most other IPAs, in my view, even though there is a lot of grapefruit present. Head disappears quickly.at recedes fairly quickly. Carbonation is good. Can't say that I would want to pick another of these up."
"This is a huge kick-in-the-mouth American IPA. The smell incredibly pungent; the stong citrusy hop scent foreshadows what's to come. The taste of hops really nails the palate, and it is uncompromised in its dryness. This is one hell of a west-coast IPA, and has long been one of my favorites."
"The body is fairly light, but it has a sticky, syrupy hop flavor that dries out somethin' fierce. Not something I'll be drinking again, unless it's just a small sample."
"Although I favor the Amarillo/Warrior hop flavors, it's hard to beat the tried and true C-hop flavors for AIPA's. One of my favorite examples of the style."
"D - Amazingly drinkable considering the ABV & IBUs. Like this brew in a 22 oz bottle, but nearly amazing on tap."
"I think this beer would be a good session beer. It is not overbearing. It is just slightly high in alcohol, so that wouldnt be too much of a problem. I will have this one again."
"Orange/copper in color, a little hazy. Nice head, some lacing. Smells of high-grade cannabis and grapefruit. Smells wonderfully hoppy. Full-bodied and smooth and somewhat creamy. Very nice. Taste is hops and more hops -- citrus and grapefruit -- and a malty, biscuity background, but hops dominate. Wonderful."
"I can drink several of these"
"This is a cloudy orange beer with a foamy, tan head that leaves a creamy lacing on the glass. The smell and taste are both strictly hops. Mouthfeel is a bit oily but makes for a smooth drinking beer. I understand the whole west coast vs. east coast debate, but I know many east coast IPAs that are just as good, if not better. I drink this again and it is a good IPA, but I can do just as well in the east."
"Bottle Pours a clear golden with a fizzy white head, that produces good lacing and lasts fairly well. Has a good hoppy aroma of spruce. Has an oily texture with good carbination. Has a real good duration with a nice strong bitter finish.This is what I love in an IPA. Bold and powerfull. Very well done. Has a very smooth ability to hit you with a solid bitterness. I highly recommend this one"
"Fairly clear light golden orange in color with a fluffy, thick bubbled sticky white head that laces exceedingly well. Smells like fresh cut pine with a citric quality to it. Starts with a dry bitterness which is fleshed out with nice caramel and toasty malt through the middle with scales moving back toward pine sap and orange through the finish. A very nice even keel bitterness is present throughout and lasts long on the palate. A bit of alcoholic spice bite near the end too. This is beautifully balanced, definitely avoiding the candied hop taste that some IPA's lean to. Body is medium full with creamy carbonation. Fairly drinkable, i'm finding, i'm taking no time with this bomber..."
"This was poured from a 22 oz. bomber leaving a 2 inch head that subsided into an inch by halfway down, to 1/2 inch the rest of the way, leaving thick lacing all the way. Hazy golden orange amber. Aroma of pine and more pine, slight malt sweetness. Taste was exactly like aroma- pine, and citrus, with slightly underrepresented malt backbone, but good nonetheless, finished with more pine. Mouthfeel was full and smooth with thick (oily?) bitter (good) taste on tongue and in mouth. Drinkability- I enjoyed this- a very good IPA and one I will get often."
"One of the many good beers from this series. This beer gives off a very light rustic color, but packs a good punch. The nose is strong and very potent. To me, it gives off the smell of 2 different kinds of finishing hops. Its like drinking liquid copper. The supper hop flavor is complimented by smooth malt and grains. Goes down smooth with not to much of a citrus bite. The boiling hops are a little more calm. It doesnÂt leave your mouth dry. Sharp finishing/aroma hops matched with mellow boiling hop makes the best combination. This is the IPA that drinks like a golden ale with a kick ass hop combination."
"This brew has a huge white head, foamy and rocky, that sits atop a golden-amber colored liquid. ItÂs fairly clear, makes for an attractive beer. Smells like a whole lot of hopsÂgrapefruit and pineÂhugely West Coast. The hops almost wholly eclipse a faint malt character. The taste is centered on bitterness, with a detectable malt sweetness in the foretaste that offsets the hops. Lots of hops and edgy sharpness in the finish. Medium body and very pleasingÂcertainly a hop monster!"
"A velevet like mouthfeel and a great smoothness make this an excellent version of this style. One of my favorite IPAs. Even better on tap."
"D - This one of my favorite IPA's. Very well balanced with just enough snap to remind you that you're drinking an IPA and not an APA."
"This beer poured a nice amber like color, with an awesome head. You can definitely tell that this beer was bottle conditioned. Extremley smooth for an IPA. I would actually consider this beer to be quite dangerous, no alcohol taste at all. The malt in it is outstanding, it laced the glass all the way down. I never had such a smooth IPA, if you haven't tried it yet, be sure to do so. I'm an Alesmith IPA freak but when you are looking for a smooth IPA please look at the Racer 5. I was pleasantly surprised with this ale. This beer is awesome, can hardly imagine it being an IPA,. I have seen a beer that laces all the way down to the bottom,. :-)"
"Although this is an IPA, it was the smoothness of the malt in this beer really stole the show. This oneÂs delicious, and I highly recommend it."
"Overall = a serious disappointment considering Bear Republic's reputation. I had high hopes for this beer but I can think of 15 IPAs of the top fo my head that I'd buy before I try this one again. I hold IPAs to an extremely high standard and this one did not meet my constaints. Did I possibly get a bad bottle?"
"I have had this on tap at Publick House and Redbones. Both times I was pleasantly surprised. I was unfamiliar with Bear Republic and this was my first of their offerings. Granted most of this is from memory, but I do recall enjoying the well-balanced hop and alcohol. I did not realize that this was a 7% beer, the mothfeel is nicely rounded since the amount of hops and alcohol do not overwhelm the other. The brewer did a good job with the full flavor. They did not just hop-up a beer for hops sake"
"Drinkability: superbly drinkable. This should be a staple in everyone's refridgerator."
"Flavor was a classic Californian IPA. Lods of hops up front that was loadied full of sun-warmed fruit. Oranges, lemons, apples and pears. The bitterness was balanced erfectly by a nice malty background. Actually, it was maltier than I was expecting from its appearance. Very full mouthfeel. Juicy and chewy. that 7%ABV really snuck up on me too. I could have staed at RBs all afternoon sipping a couple pints of this beer."
"I could easily have more than one of these. Excellent example of an American IPA."
"All in all, a race well run."
"I was suprised how smooth this was off the first taste, but it finished strong with a hoppy kick of a finish. A crisp orange/citric taste stands out over a very mild malt presence. This beer clearly focuses on the hops and is one of the more drinkable IPA's I've had at 7%. With a smooth yet lively mouthfeel provided through the hops and carbonation, I'd recommend this IPA to any of you out there."
"This is a very good, enjoyable, quaffable beer. That being said, nothing about it really stands out to me - I feel as though I have had many beers very similar to this, though not many better. Possibly the least distinct beer in the top 100 currently, but I will enjoy it now and then since it is, indeed, a very pleasurable drinking beer."
"I recommend this highly, an excellent example of this style...enjoy!"
"D- This is a good solid IPA with juicy hops and a good malt backbone. ItÂs hard to believe this is a 7% abv beer and it has a bit more sweetness than most IPAs. That changes the profile of the hops with is a nice twist."
"Racer 5 is a great IPA. It is well balanced and very drinkable. I have to say that Bear Republic is quickly becoming one of my favorite craft brewers."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is good. Very smooth tasting offering from Bear Republic. Goes down smooth being a well balanced IPA. Very drinkable beer. Carbonation is descent, not overpowering."
"Thick, yet not oppressively so. Hoppy, yet not overwhelmingly so. High abv, but not dangerously so. What a beer... I am extremely impressed."
"Easy drinker. Goes down nice. Not too bitter, despite itÂs huge hop profile. Great beer."
"What else is there to say? This is an awesome West coast IPA. Another great beer from Bear Republic."
"This one went down supper easy. Very drinkable. First i've sampled from bear republic. It has me looking forward to more. Another of the many fine IPA's. It's tough to pick a favorite because there are so many good ones."
"22oz bottle. Light orange in colour with lots of carbonation and a bit of haze. Very floral aroma with some mild background notes of orange and black pepper. Medium bitterness, with flavor notes of green hop cone, orange, grapefruit, light (yet fairly sweet) malt, and a touch of pine. A bit light bodied for the style and AVB, but would be a good IPA for warmer weather drinking. Solid."
"Giddyup!"
"Drinkability: Quite easy to drink. Not too aggressive, and not puckeringly bitter. Good stuff!"
"Head is fairly thin, and dissipates fast into a decent ring of foam. Carbonation looks pretty active. The color is a beautiful copper/orange, mostly clear. I smell primarily fresh hops, maybe a bit spicy or peppery, but mostly hop aroma. The flavor continues to be hoppy, with a hint of sweet/nutty malt. The finish is dry and only moderately bitter- less than I expected. The mouthfeel is a bit too thin for my liking, but carbonation is adequate. Alcohol is not very present. Despite its shortcomings the beer is still very drinkable. It's a good beer, but it could be great if there were more balance from the malt."
"I have enjoyed other bear offerings to a greater extent, this isn't bad by any stretch but it certainly didn't knock my socks off... I wouldn't be averse to having it again but I won't go silly looking for it."
"What an outstanding California beer! This seems to be a ubiquitous favorite around the bay area from what many at the phenomenal Toronado bar had to say. This pint was barely amber, almost orangey, and had a stable two finger, dense off-white head that had superb retention Â surprising for a 7% brew. Maybe the water in California has different properties than Pacific Northwest waters when it comes to head retention. The smell is phenomenally hoppy. The taste is surprising and original. ItÂs only 69 IBUs, but I would have guessed in the high 80s. They are using Cascade and Columbus hybrid hops. The later are usually employed early in brewing for bittering, but these in the Racer 5 are utilized more in a finishing role and other breweries could really take a hint from this. They are superb in that capacity. The mouthfeel is bold and sharp and the finish is long and wonderful. It should be noted that there is actually some discernable malt taste lurking behind all the hops and it has a subtle caramel malt body. This is a real drink-em-all-night IPA and one of the most enjoyable of the style IÂve ever had."
"I'm waffling a bit on the drinkability; It's good, for sure, but not outstanding. This is a tasty, quaffable beverage, so it's definitely worth a try! Good on Bear Republic!"
"Appears a soft orange-red in color with an off-white colored head that is thick and intense and seems to just sit there for quite awhile. Nice lacing is left behind on my pint glass. Aromas of pine, oranges, carrots, and hops seem to come out nicely. The taste is quite hoppy with a bitterness that is present in every sip. A fair amount of malty sweetness is also present, adding texture and variety to each sip. I felt this beer was too carbonated and hence it was too slick and creamy in my mouth. The drinkability is high as the flavors are enticing and enjoyable."
"This probably makes my top three IPA's ever tried (with Stone IPA and Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale). I would love to do a blind tasting of these three. I could drink this all day."
"Taste: Relatively mellow carbonation, the malt tastes like cookies with a bit of cooked vegetables. The hops show up nice and easy, and slowly grow momentum, without ever going into excess. Almost no alcohol to be found in the taste, somewhat ashy finish, perhaps from the yeast shot. Not my favorite Bear Republic, but a nice sessionable IPA."
"pleasantly balanced in the taste. sweet, carbonated mouthfeel with a nice piney hop aftertaste. everything in the aroma comes through in the flavor, which is not overwhelmingly bitter but has a strong, complex hop component. nice juicy feel with a prominent grapefruit rind flavor. very drinkable."
"This is a very drinkable ipa and goes down very easy. A great tasting ipa."
"poured a medium golden color with massive white puffy, chunky head.Slowly settled to a thin coating that lasted throughout the glass. Amazing lacing on the side of the glass. Lovely glass of beer. Smell is strong on pine hops mixed with some citrus-like notes. Taste is initially very strong on hops with a nice btterness, bit some malt flavors begin to show through to give an excellent balance. Each taste brings the pleasant aroma, to be finished off with the great taste. Finish is more dry than malty,but the combination is fantastic. Very drinkable. I will have to visit this one again (and again)."
"Big beer with enough seductiveness to lure you back in, great hops sandwich!! Wish I could fond this at better price than $5 a 22oz bottle"
"Pours a murky amber with a finger of khaki head in my weizen glass. Nose is bitter herbal hops with some sweet caramel malt. Taste is pretty well hopped, a little on the bitter side, with some balancing caramel malts and a bit of brown alr nuttiness. Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, but crisp. Overall a pretty drinkable IPA, not outstanding but worth the $3.49/bomber."
"Pours a clear golden hue, shot thru with red highlights. If clear copper could be defined any better, I don't know the beer to do it. Massive billowing head that sticks to every glass surface it can find. Pure hops in the nose, oily and citrus-like. Hops are upclose and personal in the taste, but a perfect level of malt sweetness manages to rein in the bitterness. Mouthfeel could have benefitted from the brewers using water with a higher mineral content, I think. It might have complimented the hops just a little more, but that's a minor hit on an awesome West Coast IPA."
"Wow. This may be the Holy Grail of mainstream IPA's. Pours a deep amber with thick, very foamy head that lasts forever. Smell is of pine, citrus, caramel, and alcohol. Taste is forever smooth, with a nice, sweet finish and a nice bit of bitterness. A very drinkable IPA. Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye has long been one of my favorites, but Racer 5 outpaces it..."
"D - Pretty good, not my favorite IPA but definitely one to enjoy, especially if you want an IPA with a little sweetness every now and then. This'll keep you coming back for more sips."
"Drinkability is very high. Could be a great session beer. Just a little too costly and somewhat hard to find around here. I will grab this one again."
"Outstanding."
"This is good stuff, just wish it came in 12oz bottles instead."
"Drinkability is good. At 7%. Pretty big for a regular IPA. This however would not stop me from finishing my bomber. An excellent IPA. Would love to be able to get this on a regular basis."
"Not at all what I was expecting. On the east coast we hear so much about his hop bomb or that ""extreme"" beer. IMO, this is the one beer that qualifies as both. Great beer."
"Beer is good. Happy big hops IPA beering."
"Pours a clear, copper color with a finger and a half of head that sticks around fairly nicely. Nose is nice and hoppy, with good sweet citrusy and some sharper piney notes. It is balances by a modest caramel backbone. Flavor is dominated bot the hops initially. More sharpness in the pine flavor than sweetness from the citrusyness. The sweet caramel backbone comes through more after the swallow, followed by a moderate hoppy bitter that grabs and hangs on, drawing me back for more. Tasty beer. Feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation. Nice and chewy. Just looked at the ABV. 7% is nowhere to be found. Burps are much stronger in the caramel than hoppyness. This bomber is going to find its way to empty very fast. Enjoyable."
"I've been meaning to try this for a some time, and now I can't believe what I've been missing out on! This is perhaps more floral and less spicy than your traditional west coast IPA, but who cares? This is one outstanding beer. My hat's off to Bear Republic, I was truly blown away."
" This beer is like a double ipa in character...it's just so well put together. It justifies being only in bombers. (actually in sonoma i saw it in 6 packs but that ruins my point :) i toyed with giving this all 5's since it probably the best ipa i've had...but i guess there is a hair of room for improvment."
"My old standby for IPAs, this is one of the best. I can only get it in 22 oz. in MD. Pours a hazy orange/yellow color with slight head. Nice bouquet. Orange peels, pine and yeast. Hoppy taste with a nice malt and yeast finish with is a welcome change from a lot of IPAs. A very balanced and drinkable beer. The higher abv doesn't show up in the taste making this one a little too drinkable. Another hit from BR."
"Cheers!"
"I've sampled the Racer X on cask, so I expected this to be a smaller, less hoppy version - and it is - though I expected a bit more hops overall. Pours a golden amber from the bomber, very sweet floral citrusy aroma, hops are noticeable but not overpowering. Flavor is initially sweet, with vanilla and pineapple flowing. Hoppiness is present throughout, though not with a lot of bitterness and actually a butterscotch, malty caramel presence seems to take over in the finish. Very thick and coating and a bit heavy for an IPA. Carbonation is light and reminiscent of a hand-pulled cask pour. The big malt profile balances this quite nicely. As a hophead I still prefer the more hoppy, bitter X. However, as a west coast IPA, this is quite tame in terms of hops, and could be a great crossover IPA."
"Drinkability: High. Very, very easy to drink only I wonÂt be drinking much of this one. I can think of at least 5 IPAs that are better and more affordable."
"Pours a cloudy/hazy orange or amber color with nice head. Head had decent head retention. The aroma is strong. Hops show through as expected and are citrus slighty floral. The taste is bold and hoppy as expected, however not overpowering or too much bitterness. Great hoppy finish."
"This is a beer to be enjoyed as well as respected. It is big in a lot of ways and you will feel it by the end of a bomber."
"drinkability: no issue downing this bomber"
"This one's going on the ""get again"" list."
"By the way the head ROCKS! Right now there is a frickin cavern developing above the beer. Hard to describe but amazing. haha actually i want the foam to fall down and become beer."
"22 oz. with no freshness date. Pours a bright orangey/copper with a fairly thin off-white head that doesn't leave much lacing. It becomes cloudy on the second pour. Mostly tropical and sweet in the nose - pineapples, grapefruit, oranges, a strong sweetness, and a bit of nostril-burning alcohol in the back. The flavor is about the same with a hefty sweetness and grapefruit, pineapple, leafy/oily hops, and some nutty/biscuity malts. It is both quite sweet and bitter at the same time with both lingering for awhile. At the beginning it has a medium body but it becomes thicker and creamier as the beer warms up. A solid IPA that I could easily make a session out of."
"tasty, but i couldn't drink too many because of the aforementioned sweetness"
"Ahh, the hops do a nice job mellowing out the citrus, but still let just enough come through, pretty tasty. Also was surprised by how creamy this went down. This is a pleasure on the tongue."
"Overall, an exceptional IPA. Not anything particulary stand out, but definitely solid and definitely worth drinking if you can get it."
"Good god! Huge biscuit drizzled with grapefruit icing served up with a side of tart berries. Drinks like an egg cream. Awesome! From the company whose motto is ""Bigger is better"" what would happen if they made an IIPA, huh?"
"Bear Republic doesn't dissapoint with this monstrous offering. everything you'd expect from an american original...the bold american IPA. Big hoppy smell that is countered by a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Amazingly it finishes ""fairly clean"" for such an overhopped beer. This is pre-night cap material. Like the setup man in the bullpen this is an eighth inning Tom Gordon style or for the west coast folks this is a Brendan Donnely. I found this beer to get a bit harsh on the throat as it warmed up...whatever thats getting pretty petty in my book..The only downfall I would say is its almost a double in taste...if your gonna be an IPA be an IPA....fundamentally sound."
"I like the mix of flavors and the balance of them. Great blending."
"Reddish copper with a big frothy head and some suspended yeasty bits swirling in my pint glass. Lots of floral and citric hop aroma, some yeasty notes and just a little malt sweetness. The aroma is good but seems a little subdued. Tastes great. Grapefruit hop bitterness mixed with quite a lot of fruityness gives me my needed hop fix. A bready malt character evens things out a bit and makes it very drinkable. Vinous, lingering bitter finish, alittle on the oily side. Well balanced but still hop forward."
"Damn. I love the 5 but not enough to match the score to name. Racer 4.x doesnÂt exactly roll off the tongue but Racer 5 is certainly built for it."
"Drinkability: Very, very good. I like this beer a lot, I just wish it had a nose to match its taste. I do wish I had another."
"Drinkability: absolutely an explosive and powerful American IPA for me--a delicious present from Bultrey!"
"Bottle obtained from Total Beverage (Colorado) and consumed a couple evenings later in July 2005. Pours a one-finger wicked silky creamy fine clingy head. Light tan that stands over a slightly cloudy light apricot liquid. Smells potently and smooth clean grapefruit pith with some hoppy orange and tangerine. Tastes sweet honey-like malt with moderate hop bitter and strong hop flavoring. The hop flavors are distinct and clean, but supported by underlying malt sweetness. Fruity esters are mild beneath the hops, but are honey-like, with apricot and tangerine. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Medium body with moderate carbonation. This is a really enjoyable IPA. Great clean hop flavor without"
"Still a Big Favorite - hope to clone this one day!"
"Overall, Racer 5 is still a pretty nice IPA; easily quaffable and well constructed. To me, it seemed like the hoppy edge had been worn down to create a more balanced brew. I still recommend it, though."
"Found this one at a local Brew house. Appearance is a cloudy gold with good foam and lacing. Aroma contains a massive amounts of grapefruit hops and malt. Aroma contains hops and sweet malt. Initial taste has bitter hops, lots of malt and crackers. A great IPA."
"Picked this up on a road trip to Halftime beverages in NY. Pours a fairly clear amber color with a whitish head that quickly dissipates. Pleasant hoppy aroma. Taste is very smooth for such a well-hopped IPA, with a bit of a pine-needle flavor. None of the puckering bitterness that you can get sometimes with some of the west coast hop monsters I've tried. The alcohol is subtle, definitely an easy drinker. I only wish that I could find this beer more easily in Connecticut."
"This is a ballsy brew."
"Long sought after bomber, finally acquired across the Wisconsin border. Pours with amazing clarity, a light bronze color, and a large creamy head that fades after sitting for a minute to a creamy layer. Smell is bursting with citrus hops, lemon zest, and floral hops, an explosive array of hops. Taste starts out with hops, transitions into floral hops, and closes with more hops and some doughiness. Starts smooth, then eviscerates your hops craving. Excellent beer. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, well carbonated and smooth. A very nice beer."
"This is a fantastic IPA and I could drink this anytime without a problem. A must try for any IPA fan."
"Pours a bright gold tinged with reddish hues , a solid finger of off-white head and great retention. Smell was more subtle than I expected, sweet malt, orange and grapefruit hops. The taste of this is excellent--nice pine needle hoppiness upfront, a smooth sweet malt balancing perfecting, and an assault of citrus and grapefruit hops leaving a long hoppy finish. Medium bodied with a slick juicy hop-coating feel--feels just like an IPA should. Another very well balanced IPA from the west coast that I could drink all night long."
"($3.99 / 22 oz.)"
"Smells citrusy, mostly orange and lemon, and piney. A hint of sweetness as well. Earthy. Also some spicyness in here, black pepper. Tastes citrusy, slightly bitter, and definitely hoppy. Sort of a biscuity flavor and feel. Mouthfeel is very chewy, some bubbles, mealy- very, very nice. Drinkable- I'd say so. I could have a few of these, no problem. Tasty and refreshing. God bless IPAs."
"Slighty hazy orange colour with a generous, fluffy head. Good retention and lacing. Toasted, malty aroma with mostly pine and some citrus hop character that is more on the orange side. Also just a bit spicy. Excellent balance with plenty of bitterness balanced by bready, biscuity malts. Hop flavour is strong pine, citrus, and spice, without being over the top. Sweetness backs off towards the end, which lets the resinous bitterness come forward, along with more orange hop flavour, and a bit of alcohol warming appear. Finishes off-dry. Body is a little on the heavy side, moderate carbonation. Bottle conditioning seems to contribute to the creamy smooth texture, which improves even more as it warms. Very nice..."
"Light-bodied and easy to drink, a nice, straight-forward IPA that really grows on you. Yum"
"golden orange amber color with a thin sticky white head. piney herbal and grassy hops dominate the aroma. some grapefruit comes out as it warms. the smell is a little subdued, i don't really pick up anything else. while the aroma doesn't have a lot of grapefruit to it the taste does. the other grassy hebal aspects take a backseat to the grapefruit now, to combine with some really nice piney hops and a light honey-like sweetness that balances things out a little. medium body with subtle carbonation that lends to a nice smoothness that these type of beers are sometimes lacking. good drinkability, i had no trouble finishing the bomber and could easliy finish another with out it getting tiresome. an excellent example of a west coast IPA. highly recomended."
"Mouthfeel is a touch thin but still coats well enough to provide lingering time for tasting. If this was a bit heavier this would be right on par with what I woudl expect. Drikability is really what this beer is about and some of that could be due to the lighter mouthfeel in my opinion. No problems will be encountered finishing this bomber off."
"Highly drinkable. Had a bomber on a hot day and it went down like candy. I was begging for more. Another great west coast brew. Perfect for sessions or whatever. Super versatile, flavorful, Racer 5 is always a good choice. If you are begging for more hops, Racer X is your answer."
"Body is solidly medium with medium bubbles of carbonation and a slick, oily, hop-juicey mouthfeel. Perfect for sitting on the porch watching an afternoon thunderstorm and ensuing downpour, as I am now."
"Let me start by saying: I love Bear Republic beers. They make top notch west coast style ales, that are packed with flavour over and over. This one is no different. Excellent IPA. Pours extremely hazy, amber orange colour, with a large, fluffy white head that lasts the entire time. Great lacing. An explosion of hop aromas. Pine, citrus, toasted malt. Juicy, oily, and well full of cascade hops. Somewhat balanced. Excellent beer."
"I can't believe I hadn't picked this one up yet... I got obsessed with their Hop Rod Rye and really overlooked this one. Glad I finally decided to try it. A near perfect beer. Appears a cloudy yellow amber color with a dense head that lasts until the very end, leaving nice rings of white lacing on the glass. Smells quite hoppy, a mix of grapefruity pine and citrus. The taste is actually perfectly balanced, a must for a truly great IPA, though the hops come get you first. As the smell suggested, piney and citrusy, which sounds pretty typical and we've all seen those words in just about every review of an IPA, but there's a bit more to this one. Nice lemmon and orange peel zest, and a bit of dry dustiness. The deliverance of this beer is key as well; perfectly smooth mouthfeel, nice and dry yet thirst-quenchingly refreshing. I wish this beer came in sixers or growlers, because I could easily pound a half gallon of this delicious nectar. You might call this the ""De Ranke XX of America", but this beer stands strong by itself as a unique west coast IPA."
"Racer 5 pours a slightly cloudy amber, with a good sized white head. It has a big aroma of citrus (namely grapefruit and lemon) and pine. The mouthfeel is lively but, a little too thin. This brew is pretty hoppy, not quite as hoppy as it could be, but it has a nice malty backbone. I could easily drink a gallon of this stuff."
"Pours a beauty hazy orange with a foamy antique white head. Nice lacing on the glass. Nose is pine needles and citrus rind. Taste is hops right from the get-go, yet not harsh. There is more of the pine taste, some balancing sweetness, but oh so faint. Mouthfeel is thin to medium, with a long hoppy finish. Tasty IPA and easy to consume. Recommended."
"Drinkability- Classic example of a good session brew. Wish they came in 6 packs rather than bombers."
"Finger licking good."
"Pours out a clear amber-orange color with an extremely sticky white head that left rings of lace all over the glass. The aroma is filled with citrusy hops and screams huge hop additions. The taste is packed with a great hop start but smoothes out over the tongue wonderfully with a perfect balance of bitterness. The semi-high ABV in this is well hidden but makes a presence letting you know that it is there very sublte in the finish. The smoothness of this beer is incredible for having so much hop flavor. The intense hops in an IPA that are normally too much for malt-lovers, is so well balanced, that this is a perfect beer for those who want to explore the world of the hop-heads. I personally can not get enough hops, and this one (not being a IIPA) is just phenomenal. As far as the IPA style goes, I have yet to find one that is as well crafted as this."
" feels like it could be a bit more carbonated, and the finish drops away a bit too fast to be perfectly brilliant. But those two qualities make this beer quite drinkable despite its bitterness and strength. Overall an excellent IPA."
"Now this is what an IPA should be. Hoppy but balanced, slightly creamy, a bit malty, and just plain refreshing. An immensely pleasurable beer to drink, especially on tap. Pours with a thick rocky head, nice lacing. Smells slightly sweet, floral. Taste is slightly sweet caramel malt up front, lots of hops, well balanced, crisp hop finish. Slightly creamy mouthfeel. A great IPA, not quite a double IPA, but close."
" One of the best IPA's out there, only rivaled by Diamond Knots gem in my book."
"I'm quite taken with this; I think it's overtaken my top IPA spot. The hops are huge, but the malt is really creamy and strong enough to balance it out."
"NB: The bottles all exhibited a slight medicinal hint, not present on draught. Score the draught ~0.25 higher overall."
"22 ounce bomber. This beer has a light copper color with a big, creamy white head. Be carefull not to pour this beer too hard, or the head will get out of control. Aromatic hop aroma, with just a bit of malt. The flavor is huge, caramel sweet at first with a load of hops. You could call this a double ipa. A little spicy in the finish. Medium to full mouthfeel. There is a nice alcoholic bite. Good west coast ipa."
"Taste is one of my favorites for an IPA...sweetness is just enough to offer delightful flavors of carmelized malts and piney hops. The carbonation is perfect...just enough to overcome any sweetness this brew has to offer. The mouthfeel is not thin or too syrupy...a very clean aftertaste allowing me to cruise through this bomber. Oh yeah, this is one hell of a session brew!"
"Notes: Solid, well balanced IPA, comparable to Craftsmen's IPA, which has a slightly better balance and mouthfeel."
"This beer is one of those big IPA's that has balance and class by the truckload. Like Smuttynose or Stone this is the Ivy league of the style; in your face with a pedigree. I had 3 of Bear Republic beers in a tasting with Malto and all of them were highly impressive. Complex and powerful with a sense that the brewer has the chops."
"Overall a very nice representative of a West Coast IPA."
"Conclusion: Very very tasty, have it with a fried lunch like a fish and chips or a plate of calamari. Issss so good!"
"Decent deep golden color. Nice tight white head and very nice lacing on down. Very nice aroma. Big, wet, hoppy smell. Nice sweet malt in the backround. Big hop flavor up front. Very grassy and citrusy. Good mellow malt sweetness in the finsh. Oily and velvety body. An extremely drinkable brew. My first taste from this brewery looking forward to more."
"Overall a very fine IPA that is nicely balanced."
"One of the better IPAs that I've enjoyed..."
"Drinkability: This is a beer from heaven, give me more and more every day. The beer is very easy drinking (even my Mom who thinks beer is âhorridâ liked this)."
"22oz. Bomber: This one pours a hazy, slightly orangish color. There is a fairly strong white head that leaves some lacing down the glass. The aroma is a mix of grapefuit and pine hops. The taste is actually a touch sweet before the hops kick in. They are strong without being overpowering. A really decent beer!"
" Drinkability is good a nice drinkable IPA from a good brewery can't wait to try their double."
"The mouthfeel is light, crisp, and clean, especially for a 7.0% brew. This makes for dangerously easy drinking."
"Very nice IPA on of the best in my estimation..will buy again..soon!"
"My only complaint about this beer is that I've not tried it before. From now on, when this is on the menu and there's nothing new that jumps out at me, I won't have to spend 5 minutes deciding what I want to try."
"Go speed racer, go!"
"The drinkability is excellent and maybe a session beer until the seven percent is too much before the not too syrupy taste."
"Pours a hazy copper gold under a 2.5 finger white head, thick and long-lived. The lacing in the first glass was a bit thin, but ample upon second pour. Lots of citrus and pine greet the nose - yum! The mouth is very prickly and medium-bodied. The taste presents a race, with distinct sweet citrus and malt contending wiht the pine and espresso bitter. Nicely balanced, this one is smooth and subdued, at least compared to some other IPAs. The finish is mild, almost fruity, but the race isn't over yet. The true dry espresso-grinds experience comes through in the aftertaste, leaving a delicious bitterness (and the one enjoying it) as the ultimate winner. Very interesting brew."
"Pours a light copper color with a medium head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is very hoppy - mostly pine and grassy hops, but there is some citrus there too. Caremel malt flavor with a strong hop presence. A bit sweet."
"Drinkability: A pleasure to consume from start to finish...definitely recommended."
"Drinkability. This is basically a hophead's delight, but it's also on the moderately flavored for an American IPA. For anyone attempting an American IPA for the first time, it's a good example of the style that won't overwhelm."
"Bear Republic is a great little brewery and brewpub. If you live in their small distribution area I'm guessing you've already tried their brews. Too bad the rest of us can't enjoy their good beer."
"Go speed racer go speed racer go,sorry.Pours a light golden with a orange tint to it as I neared the bottem of my bottle the chunks and floaties came.A very floral aroma poured a foot and a half away from my nose and picked up the citrus and piney aroma very tantalizing and bold.Taste is a hop heads dream but there is a firm malt backbone very piney almost medicinal in its hop character with a light nuttiness coming thru late.A hop fix for me really liked this beer wish I had more."
"A slightly hazey orange/amber colored ale with a nice off white head, no lace. A lovely hop boquet both piney and a sweet grapefruit intertwined. A sharp piney hops at the start of the taste with a smooth hint of grapefruit sweetness on the finish. Another good west coast IPA."
"Bear Republic is becoming one of my favorite breweries, and it's all because of the hops. Anyway. Racer 5 pours an orange-golden with a fluffy, off-white head. Smells of big, piney, resiny, citrus-tinged hops. But there's also a sweet, sugary malt backbone. Taste is much like the smell. Nice, sugary malt backbone up front, followed by big, fresh evergreen logs, dipped in grapefruit juice. Dry finish, with lingering maltiness. Full-bodied, chewy malts, yum. One of my favorite West Coast IPAs."
"Tap, Toronado, San Francisco. Pretty hoppy and bitter, citrus rind, lychee, pine. Intense, but nice softness round the edges, and really good balance, which setes it apart from the slightly stickier versions of the style you find in the US, really well made and just plain tasty. Yummy stuff."
"pours a crisp orange colour with a bubbly, foamy head that sticks all over the glass. smell is a balanced mix of caramel, other sweet candy, hops, bread, coconut and bubble gum. no one thing dominates here. the flavour weighs a bit mor eto the hop/bread side than the sweetness picked up in the nose, though that characteristic is still here in the flavour. starts out a bit sweet and juicy even, then moves into a touch of malt biscuit flavour before being hit with a full on hop attack that, while not huge, is a nice kick in flavour and mouthfeel. an overall tasty ipa from bear republic."
"Pours a golden amberish color with a fluffy off-white colored head. Big sprucy, Columbus hoppy nose and some bready, grainy, caramel-like malt sweetness in the nose. Malty sweet and grassy up front and a hop smackdown that puts you in the Figure Four leglock and doesn't let go. Dry resiny, hop oily finish. Alcohol is noticable, but behind all those delicious hops, who cares. Finely crafted IPA, and hands-down one of the finest IPAs in the country. Bear Republic is one of my favorite breweries, and we've desperately trying with our Pennsylvania distributors to get in contact with these guys and get their great beers here. The sound of dragging feet is deafening. Good thing I stocked up on a recent trip to New York. I don't want to get to into the East Coast/West Coast thing because it sounds like early 90's gangsta rap, but this the real deal in what would be classified as a West Coast-style IPA."
"Clear, light amber hue, paper thin bright white head, decent lacing maintained. A decent hop/citrus nose, you can nearly smell a 1/2 pound of beautiful hops awaiting to be destroyed! Pine and citrusy offerings, very well balanced up front; the obvious hop presence is felt, thick and creamy. Juicy hops in the body, backed with a decent malt-base. Finishes a touch piney and dry, yet very satisfying, a top-five IPA in my book!"
"A very nice IPA, more than just the big piney/citrusy IPA's so common."
"ng"
"Pours a light copper, with a nice head. No lace to speak of from the bomber I had. WOW, citrus, grass, flowers from the nose. This is a hops forward beer. An explosion of fresh hops on your tongue when you drink. Because it appears so fresh, the flavor is of grass and flowers, with a slight bitterness on the back, It has a nice mild mouth feel, and a great dinkability."
"This beer pours a gorgeous brown yellow, with a tempting dense tan head. The nose is a little lacking. I get malt and alcohol and a little bit of hop aroma. The hop taste is also underwhelming. Lots of nice malt and a fair amount of alcohol. The hops are complex with a little citrus and little something else. I could not find a freshness date, so I definitely need to try this again, maybe on tap."
"In conclusion, I don't quite have the expertise to say why this beer was particularly good, but stands out a bit from some of the other IPA's I have had. More balanced than many, has the taste I expect from a California IPA, but not quite as good, IMHO, as DFH 60-minute and some other premiere IPA's. Nonetheless, very drinkable, but then again, American IPA is my favorite style."
"Another great beer from Bear Republic. A solid IPA that manages a very nice balance and doesn't become hop juice. Quite good, and one I'd have when Bear Republic makes it into Pennsylvania!"
"Medium bodied, a touch oily."
"An interesting beer and one I hope to try again."
"Thanks Bruiser81!"
"Pours cloudy light copper color, aroma of pine and citrus, hops and hops and more hops, nice white head with large bubbles that leaves good lacing in my glass, some malty sweetness to balance the loads of hops, medium body with a thick and sticky mouthfeel, very nice."
"Deep golden-amber body, clear with little sediments surfing accross the bottom of the glass. Aroma is mostly constituted of grapefruity C-hops. There are also floral hop notes, but really, grapefruit is totally dominant. On the tongue, youÂre hit by more of this high acid alpha hop fest, a bit of flowers and a decent malty body which comes out as peachy and cookie-ish. Good balanced american type IPA, but the style doesnÂt do much for me. While the mouthfeel is very well rounded and display high carbonation a bit like a belgian, the flavors still feel rather simple, akin to grapefruit juice with a very warming finish where the 7% gets felt. Thanks to Mzwolinski for the opportunity!"
"Quite a nice IPA. The huskiness is a little much at times and the honey taste is quite strong. If you're not afraid of these things in an IPA, you've love it. A sweeter version of the style with a ton of hops, but very little pungency and resinous acidity. These guys are underrated in my opinion, and brew some world class brews. Alas, this is an wonderful brew, but not quite world class like their Big Bear Stout."
"A nice big bottle of my favorite kind of beer. Pours a nice medium orange yellow with a nice head. The nose is troubling but I will let it pass. What smells strong to me is good to others. The taste covers my goals here. Nice hoppy and malt character with excellent mouthfeel. The alchohol is a little strong for 7%. Another fine IPA"
"This beer tastes wonderful. I enjoy Goose Island IPA on tap at the Clyborne pub and this is right up there with it except a bit stronger. A medium body mouthfeel and a high drinkability. Huge hops is such a hot weather thing."
"22oz Bomber. Pours a golden orange color with pretty good clarity and a good-sized frothy white head that laces a bit. The aroma is strong pleasant one made of a citrus hops and lesser malty sweetness. There were notes of fruit as well as it warmed. The taste is mainly hoppy bitterness with a citrus flavor to it and a slight sweetness. Even though I didnÂt taste much at all in the malt department this was a well-balanced beer. The aftertaste is a pleasant bitterness that lingers for a bit. No alcohol was detected anywhere in this brew but the effect were warming by the end of the bottle. It has medium body with good carbonation. I found this to be very drinkable, a good hop fix and went great with some spicy steak fajitas."
"22 oz Bomber. Pours a clear golden color with a white head. Light clean fresh hop aroma, nothing assertive. Flavor is big in both hop flavor and bitterness, yet lets the malt sweetness shine through. The malt seems to coat the mouth nicely. Hops linger to the end. I am liking this...."
"Drinkability is very good with the 22 oz. flowing smoothly."
"One of my favorite IPA's. Just a great effort by Bear Republic."
"as my sister said ""not as bad as stone old guardian"". i thought the opposite."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades. The aroma is good. It has a very intense, but pleasant citrous hop scent that is enhanced with a nice pale malt aroma. The taste is good. It has a complex pale malt core with a wonderful bitter hop flavor. It refreshes and goes down easy. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good IPA. It has a malty character and good hop additions; very well balanced."
"This is a really drinkable beer and I would definitely reach for another after the first is done."
"Had on tap very fresh 8.5 years later and this classic with juicy orange this time worked just fine, long finish, lacey."
"22 ounce bottle. (I think I have had this beer awhile and the hop aroma has faded somewhat.)"
"This beer is something of a legend here in NorCal, and I was very much looking forward to a controlled, objective tasting, rather than the usual drunken Healdsburg post-wine tasting pallate cleanse. Sadly, not impressed. Bought this 22 at a Napa gourmet mart, so it should have been fresh; glass should have been clean. This might have been the victim of some soap residue, but the beer seems the most likely culprit. Not awful, but not interesting--Stone Ruination blows its door off."
"This was a great beer for sure. It poured a amber color with a big cloud like white head that left tons of lace down the glass. The smell was very bready but at the same time the citrus notes from the hops crept in as well. The taste was alot smoother than I was expecting, with a nice creamy mouthfeel, great malt presence and a nice biting but not too bitter hoppiness. This a very tame west cost IPA IMO but a very sessionable one nonetheless."
"Golden color with a thick white head. Little to no lace. Citrus and pine come across the nose. The flavor is thick chewy and creamy, citrus and malt come strong. Very smooth and creamy in the mouth. Drinkability is way way good. Another IPA that can be enjoyed all night, any night."
"Bomber bottle. No freshness dating. Pours nice auburn, with some golden hues, white,tiny bubble head and leaves alot of intricate lacing. Hoppy, hoppy nose. Large malty backbone, biscuity. Grapefruit, pine, grainy hops carry the weight here. Pac. NW jolt of HOPS is what were talkin' here. Big and bold IPA. High quality creation, seek-drink-enjoy."
"This is a hop lover's dream. Pours a light golden amber with an off white head that disapates to a thin layer but leaves a nice thin lacing as you enjoy. Hops is what this is all about.A lttle to cloudy for my taste. Initially just a wonderful wake up call to your taste buds and then settles down to a maltly feel but not for long. Get ready for a hop explosion that just continues and finishes with a dry hop flavor that just begs you to have another to quench your thirst.This is just a great example of an American IPA that has raised the bar of what can be done. A definite keeper. Bittering is a little heavy but i love that. Not for the uninitiated."
"Pours a golden amber with a white creamy head. Smell is pine & gentle hops. Initially I taste rich, rich malts - but not to worry loads of cascade & columbus pour in soon after to balance this bad boy out very nicely. The mouthfeel is nifty - slick & buttery. Well balanced & highly drinkable."
"Mmmm-mmm, a sweet maltyness. Nose candy, and mouth candy. Like sucking on a malty-hop lolly-pop. Quite drinkable."
"Zum wohl!"
"22 oz. bomber delivered by LBB and tasted by myself and BelgianBeers."
"Taste is fruity and citrusy. Nice malt backbone to lets the lupulins shine. Hoppy bitterness but lots of more complex flavors in there too. Dandelion and daisy flavors if you can believe it. Grapefuity citrus and a slow assertive lingering hop bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied and rounded hop profile. Very drinkable IPA and refreshingly complex. A good bet for sure."
"Racer 5 is somewhere between an IPA and a DIPA in terms of flavor, body and ABV. While I do have some quibble about the choice of hops, the quality of this beer is not to be doubted. A little heavier with the Cascade and a little lighter with the Columbus and this would easily be one of my favorite IPAs. Now, if they would only bottle Racer X."
"Overall Impression: A very drinkable big brew. Quite easy on the eyes, itâs a beautiful beer. The noble hops kinda threw me, Iâm used to more of American cascade, but different is good."
"Wham! What great hops! Smell was extremely hoppy with a nice pine essence. Coppery appearance with a great head and outstanding lacing. Taste was fantastic.Extreme hop presence with a great bitterness....but smooth.. a great combination! Mouthfeel was rich, with some creamy quality that I was not expecting...great! Strong on the abv, but not overwhelming....could drink a couple but then...This is my second Bear Republic offering and certainly not my last....their brews are at the top of my list."
"A great beer to start off the night. Now I need to clean my palate with some cream havarti cheese and ge ready for De Dolle Oerbier Reserva 02."
"A very drinkable brew. The label on this reminds me of ""Speed Racer."" Go Speed Racer Go!"
"Source: Liquid Solutions"
"This beer is really quite over the top, more in the double IPA category by my standards, but so endearing in it's jolly bigness. One of the most spectacularly fresh tasting IPAs I've had the pleasure of drinking. Really amazing, considering it's from a bottle. Great stuff."
" Medium - full mouth feel with a controlled, peppery bitter finish and a warming tickle of alcohol. Tasty hop burbs!"
"Pours a pale yellowish orange, with a quickly receding head, and leaves little spots of lace. The smell is grapefruity pine from the hops, with a subtle hint of musty groudcover, kind of like fresh mushrooms. The taste is, interestingly, strong with peanut flavor. There is a brief hint of syrupy sweet hops right before the peanut kicks in. The flavor melts into a blend of all these tastes, with a slightly astringent bitter taste. The beer feels both dry and lightly syrupy on the tongue. An interesting beer to be certain."
"From the bomber, this IPA poured a light sparkling gold topped off by a medium snow white head. The aroma of hops wafts potently up from the bubbles, and the grapefruit esters are prevelant as I bring the pint glass to the nose. The taste is tart and hoppy--very hoppy. The bitter grapefruit aroma dominates too in the taste, but there is a strong nutty current--this is nicely intricate, well-balanced, and with a substantial mouthfeel. Much like the Dogfish Head 60. I like. A lot."
"Racer 5 is a damn fine IPA, one whose periodic on-tap availability is eagerly anticipated by regional beer quaffers throughout the Pac Northwest. It pours with a tall head of soapy white suds that leaves thready lace garlands as it recedes. The crisp hop nose is a genuine standout feature owing to a hearty infusion of Northwestern grown Columbus hops. Racer 5 is golden and clear but yeast particles will not stay in the bottle. They pour out in thick chunks and gobs that might appear unappetizing to some. The body is smooth with a bitterness that is striking but not excessive. Hearty, drinkable and clean. Racer 5 delivers everything you might expect from a good IPA."
"Pours a clear copper color, and is topped by a 3 finger tan head. Nice aromas of orange, apricot, and a general pungent fruitiness course through my nose as I take a big whiff. Interestingly enough I also get some notes of just over-ripe plum as I go in for another sniff. The first sip, ahhh, this was the hop fix that I have been looking for. This beer is ripe with hop notes from beginning to end. There is a medium level of sweetness, and a toasted maltiness in the finish. The sweetness helps to pick up and accentuate the fruity hop notes that are in this beer. The hops taste of apricot, lychee, and ripe citrus fruit. It finishes with a solid bitterness that ties the whole beer together and demands that you take another sip. This is the beer I was looking for tonight, it just hits the spot."
"Who is this beer for? The people who would enjoy this most are the more discriminating drinkers. Someone who truly appreciates a complex ale such as this. I would also suggest that someone who is just starting to build their palate stay away from this until they develope a strong palate for hops. This is a true west coast IPA. There is little balance in order for the hops to make their pressance known."
"This was a very nice sampling. It kept me interested and on my toes with a nice floral taste. It's definitely hoppy, but not excessively so. This is my third beer from this brewery and they've all been of suprising quality and had a very nice taste. It's substantial, but not overwhelming."
"Overall, a very enjoyable brew. Thanks to WVBeerGeek!"
"Taste: Nice citric hops initially, well balanced by the maltiness. A little green in the finish, and quite bitter and drawing at the end. A good IPA, but not one of my favorites."
"I have to gush about beeradvocate turning me on to good beer. The appearance was this golden reddish colour, with hop schmutz floating around the glass. Being a homebrewer, I appreciated this touch, even though it was probably unintentional, and would have settled to the bottom had I kept the bottle in the fridge longer. The smell is slightly sweet with a clean and crisp hop aroma. The taste- yum yum yum- a sweet malt flavor that coats the mouth with a great balance of hops. More hops than in normal beers, but deliciously balanced by the malt. While drinking it, the phrase smooth bitterness popped into my head. This feels full, rich, delicious with light carbonation and a dry hop aftertaste. I love this beer. Can't wait to try more. Am particularly lucky to have found this in NYC. Let's hope my supply doesn't dry up."
"p.s. After some deliberation, I want to add that this tastes a lot like Hop Rod Rye without the rye (also by Bear Republic). I'm thinking of Racer 5 as the delicious, inferior twin."
"22 oz. Bomber. Poured a clear golden color with a frothy, eggshell white head that receded into a ring around the edge of the glass and tons of sticky lace on the sides. Smell was super citrusy coupled with an orange sweetness and other fresh citrus fruits. The taste was brutal in the hop department which smoothed into a very malty profile for the color. As the beer warmed the 7% ABV really takes hold. However, with the adition of the sediment the taste mellows considerably to a grassier flavor with a honey-baked sweetness and the hops took a more subdued floral approach. Quality IPA and glad to have it in the Rochester area."
"Musty sweet hop flowers with a touch of pine on the tip of my nose. Nice airy white head on the pour with a very filtered golden color look in the glass with a touch of amber color. Initial blast taste-wise of orange rind, sweet malt, pine, and grapefruit juice in the bitter dry finish on the tongue. Fullish soft mouth upfront this then turns dry on on the back of the tongue in the finish. The finish could be slightly better balenced (malt wise).. but that is just me being picky. Overall this is a wonderful ipa that impacts the mouth and tongue with its hop presence. Very good!"
"1-10-04...excellent citrusy IPA with a great nose and flavor....raised scores slightly after really having an enjoyable second experience.."
"Notes: Very nice. Should be better from a fresher bottle."
"Starts with an agressive hop flavour up front that seems to cover the tounge, then has a hint of sweet malt that finished with a slightly dry roasted flavour."
"One of the five best IPA's I've ever tasted and a beer that continuously delivers excellent quality. The balance of hops and malt is fantastic. This is what the robust California IPA is all about. I can only think of a few IPA's that rival this one. Unless you've tried one, you have not achieved beer nirvana."
"Like this one alot and will grab it when I can."
"They must have dry hopped the hell out of this brew. I braced myself for a hop overload, but was surprised to taste a pretty well balanced beer (balanced for an IPA anyway). There is an initial bite, mixed with a bready malt tone, then hops all the way through to the finish. Every sip was an explosion of flavor!"
"Drinkability: A superbly balanced IPA. I'll be looking for this again and again."
"An excellent IPA from Bear Republic. This pours out a creamy orangey/peachy colour with a large white head of foam. The aromas are all fresh cut piney/citrusy hops with a nice malt backbone to boot. The taste is a hop explosion with some great bready malts on the finish. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and reminds me of real ale. Bottle conditioned magic, I tell ya. The drinkability is excellent as well. All hail the bear! Why is this stuff SO EASY to get anywhere in NYC, but impossible to get in PA, why....why....why....!?"
"Very soft beautiful bottle-conditioned mouthfeel really keeps the hop bitterness in check. Simply excellent. Its nice to find an American IPA that has the malt to balance, not just support, the hops."
"Pours amber/copper with a large white creamy head that somewhat lasts and leaves a fair amount of lace. Aroma has hints of sweet maltiness, but is dominated with strong citrus hoppiness. Flavor starts with some fine malts, then comes a pile of chewy, juicy, super fresh tasting hops that linger around for a while. Medium-full bodied, slightly acidic, ends pretty dry."
"The taste is amazingly full and round for an IPA. I am very impressed. It has a big, lovely, solid body backing up a hoppiness which brings green, growing things to mind. Its metallic bite is embedded in an overarching rounded taste which protects me from what might otherwise be a harsh experience. Toward the end of the pint I notice a slightly woody element. This beer is not all that complicated but its fullness provides an enjoyable drinking experience."
"This is a big IPA...could be called an Imperial IPA. It pours a bright shiny copper with a medium-sized off-white head and some trails of lace. The aroma is mostly made up of fragrant floral hops, with a hint of sweet malt. The body is fairly full and sweet for the style. Caramel and vanilla wafer come to mind. A big blast of fresh sharp-edged hops jumps out with grapefruit, lemon zest and a faint metallic tang. The warming alcohol mixed with the lush sweetness gives this brew a sort of brandied candy flavor, only a tad more astringent in the finish."
"Regardless, a very good West Coast IPA fighting hard against the competition, but is more drinkable than some of those hop-monsters though."
"Nice ambery copper color, somewhat hazy with little floaty things, hop leaf bits probably, finger high off-white head of thick bubbly froth, fades slowly to a thin haze and a ring which remains present the whole glass. Lace is sticky in large webby sheets. Aroma is oh so nice with lovely hops of piney deepness and citrusy oils with a soft, round caramel maltyness. Straight up IPA nose from the West coast eh, quite nice, could smell it at arms length. Taste has a nice piney sense with a mellowness thats welcoming; increasing citrus of dull orange oil and grapefruit mixed with a touch of woody dryness and a nice even bittering hop bite thats resin filled and quite nice the whole way through. Caramel malts keep a sweeter notion overall on the under side. Feel is solid medium bodied with a nice little creamy smoothness and fluffyness that slides right down. This beer clinched it for me. I love hops!! I've held back on wanting a hop fix, but no longer, I'm going to start hoarding hop heavy beers dammit! This was a very nice IPA! The bomber was gone in no time! And I thank Drewbage1847 for it!"
"Pours a pale amber with quite the short head for a slightly hard pour of an IPA. Hops are bitter and citrus tinged. Malts are a bit bready and sweet, but do an admirable job of mellowing the hopster. A very mild taste of the 7% still shows through. Overall a very decent IPA. Worth a try."
"Overall an excellent example of the style that would drive most of the drinking public running towards the nearest case of Keystone."
"Drinkability: A great IPA; much better than I remember. Would love to make this one a regular at my house."
"Overall just an amazing IPA. Very smooth, clean and easy drinking. Lots of big malts, and huge fresh hops, all perfectly balanced and yet so well mellowed it doesnât overshadow anything else. A must try beer. Yum."
"The taste of this beer is just great with strong malt and hop presence. The feel is great as well with a nice medium body and a crisp and dry finish. Very good drinkability from this nice brew."
"Comments - The brewery is located in Healdsburg, home of the CA Wine Country. It's a beer island in a sea of vino, so woulid probably appreciate a beer-lover's visit."
"Overall, a bit too hoppy for my liking. Could use a bit more balance. It literally tastes like hops steeped in boiling water. Introducing the worlds first IPA Iced Tea!"
"The beer as itÂs poured straight from the tap a cloudless golden amber with the head a majestic crown of white, creamy in texture with a fine sealing coat of lace upon the glass. The floral aroma of the hops greets your senses first, followed by the sweet fresh malt sweetness; start carries on the malt sweetness to the middling top. Finish is perky in itÂs acidity, the hops potent and pleasing in their spicy bite, desert dry aftertaste, and one ÂdamnÂ fine IPA in my books, and one I always keep on hand in the bottle and a great example of a California IPA."
"This IPA poured a hazy, copper color with white foam that settled to a thin coat that clung to the glass a bit. The smell was sweet malt and fruity hops. The taste was sweet and tangy malt balanced with fruity, floral hops, and some hoppy bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and very hoppy, though well balanced with malt. The body was medium with modest carbonation. The finish was dry. This was a very nice IPA. I would like to try this in a bottle."
"Notes: This is one of those Hop-o-licious brews. Sock it to me baby Â I love those hops and keep them coming. Paired this one up with a bowl of secret Mexican Surprise Casserole Â delicious!"
"Since arriving in the Burgh and becoming accessible two blocks down the road this has been by go to hoppy ale, amazing in all regards."
"Drinkability: Oh yeah. If this is on the tap when I go the place next, I'll probably snag it. This is a rock-solid IPA. Me likey."
"Had this on tap at Redbones...Color when served was of cloudy apple juice. I didn't pick up too much aroma from this one. Not too much head, but left beautifully striped lacing all through my glass. Taste was very citrusy, fresh, with a nice tart mouthfeel. Not a lot of malty notes in this one. I didn't find it it overhopped or anything, but the one taste sensation was: citrus. Would drink again (actually I have a bomber in my bier kabinett waiting for me). Reminiscent of Rogue Brutal Bitter imo. Pat"
"Appearance of the Racer 5 is a nice early sunset orange, with a whitecapped frothy white head. Very good clariy on draft. Aroma is good and freshly hopped -probably due to the freshness of the brew - they apparently brew 2 batches a day at BR, with the majority being Racer 5. Also smells fairly fruity, more than expected. Good flavor of citric hops, lightly malted, and pinish bitterness. Very smooth and not too heavy considering it's on the bigger edge of IPA's. Very drinkable, right up there with my other favorite IPA's such as Stone, though the two aren't very comparable. I could drink this stuff all day...."
"Dark orangey apricot color with a beige thick, oily looking head that clings to the sides of the glass. Aroma is of hops, honey, pear, and alcohol in equal amounts. Flavor is not very hoppy, but has hints of orange peel and honey and some floral notes. There is a distinct alcohol flourish in the back of the tongue in the finish, and it also lingers afterward. Mouthfeel is a little watery, a bit low on carbonation. Tasty beer, but needs more balance. The flavor is overpowered by the alcohol."
"An enjoyable beer."
"I would definitely put this in the stable of cross-overs beers into the more extreme IPAs available on the Westcoast."
"Maybe I should eat..."
"Mouthfeel is clean and medium bodied. A little density to this IPA. It drinks very easy. A very minor syrup quality to the feel of the IPA. A well thought out and complex IPA. I'll have another."
"Bright copper color topped by a thick cream colored head. Slight chill haze, active carbonation. Much more reserved and fruity aroma than I was expecting. Instead of smacking you with hops, it's got a bit of balance and some complexity in the aroma. The taste is hop laden, to say the least. Very bitter up front, then a puckering hop quality truly sucks your cheeks together. A nice floral sweetness comes in at the finish, along with a bit of malt. Initial bitter either subsides as the beer warms or numbs the taste buds to leave a smoother, softer flavor experience in its wake. Aftertaste is multiple types of hop notes, with pine, florals, and just down right bitterness mixed with a touch of sweetness. Hop burps start after two drinks, with a nice herbal note to them. Combination of alcohol and hops create a burning warmth in the throat and stomach. Mouthfeel is full and somewhat silky. For the intensity of flavors and moderat ABV, this is an insanely drinkable beer. Very good. I like this one a lot."
"Taste is tight, sharp and bitter. Very good IPA flavors. Bitterness is sharp and cuts through the palate. Leaves huge bitter hole on the tongue. Sweet malty undertone. Very gulpable. Easy to guzzle, and guzzle. Resounding hop burps. Cleansing. Very good IPA. I paired this with a grilled barbecue pork chop and horseradish cheddar covered broccoli. It did the job perfectly. Cut right through the tangy barbecue sauce and horseradish cheese. Highly recommended. I wish I had more of these Bear Republic beauties. It was pure pleasure to drink them the last 2 nights."
"22oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy reddish-orange with 1 small finger of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is a rich hoppy floral aroma, with some fruitiness also. The taste has good hops, and isn't overpowering, like some bigger IPAs. There are also some cirtus notes, and just enough malt for balance. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth. The drinkability is very nice for being 7%. A good offering for hophead rookies."
"Pale gold colored IPA with a large foamy head. Aroma is malty and spicy. Lightly malted, heavily hopped. A highly hopped IPA, yet there is a definite malty overtones. Nice balance of hops and malts. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is bitter with some malt sweetness."
"Originally sampled on 13 May 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. This is a nice drinking IPA. It is certainly better than average with a good hoppy nose and flavors. Others (Stone, DFH, Victory, Bells) are better, but I wouldn't pass this one up"
"Taste and mouthfeel: Hopheads rejoice! Bear Republic has managed to extract a ton of PNW hops flavor into this brew with only a scant amount of bitterness. All the aforementioned smells translate to the palate backed by a sweet, bready, lightly kilned maltiness. Creamy, slightly chewy mouthfeel, yet a bit lighter than say, a Stone IPA. Good Stuff!"
"This doesn't taste like it's 7%, I could handle 4 of these easily before I figured out I should've stopped at 3. A unique taste every hop lover owes to them self to try."
"What a great, tasty beer. It's intriguing... I can't quite grasp the complexity. But I'm going to ding it a little on drinkability: with the thick body I was satisfied with one."
"This tasty IPA pours with a slightly hazy amber color and a slight lace on the glass. Mild buttery and floral spice aroma. The complex flavor involves a stronger malt presence especially bringing out a caramel roundness paired nicely with a moderate bitterness and a mild spice compared to the style. Quite drinkable and very well-balanced. There is a distinctive toffee flush through the finish."
"I didn't find this IPA as nice as the Alesmith but still an excellent brew. Deep copper color with ample froth which lightly laced the glass. Nose is hoppy with pine really standing out. A gentle bitterness which is nice and the way I personally like IPA's to be. Good to the finish with consistent flavor throughout."
"There are many layering effects, though, and many rewards for this souped-up ale."
"Another fantastic brew from Bear Republic. The more I try these California micros, the more I want to move out there..."

"Overall this is a real nice IPA, but it didn't take it to that next level for me like I though it might."
"Highly Recommended!"
"This beer poured a nice amber cold color and formed a huge foamy white head that left circular lace coating the glass as is slowly, very slowy subsided. Some steady carbonation is also present to account for this. An aroma of malt, hops and some burnt caramel present. A flavor of malt, hops and caramel. A slight burnt aspect and bitterness to the finish. Slightly sweeter than most IPAs I drink, but a good beer."
"Golden caramel color. Aroma shouts ""hop-city"" right up front. Flavor is a soid dose of hops, immediately followed by sweet malt. A touch sharp up front, then the subtle floral hops flavors emerge. The finish is moderately sour and astringently bitter. Well balanced - highly hoppy but not overwhelming. Drinkability is quite good. This is my first Bear Republic beer and already I'm a fan."
"This is a highly interesting beer, reminiscent of HopDevil in its mix of hops and creaminess, but with that added odd twist of bitter. Another winner -- another unique and tempting beer -- from Bear Republic."
"This is a tasty IPA, but fell below my expectations. Drinkability suffers due to the lack of real hop flavor and hearty, lingering bitterness."
"A well-stored bottle pours a surprisingly crystal-clear deep amber body (I can see my fingerprints through the glass on the first pour - the second becomes more hazy). The aroma of fresh piney/citric hops greets you immediately. The full and creamy vanilla head needs a few moments to settle just so you can fill the glass; and once calmed holds fairly well. It drops but keeps a solid 1/4"" of foam across the surface and leaves excellent layers of lace until the very end. The nose expresses piney/citrusy hops over a gently caramelish malt. It's very nice, and not overdone as some IPAs can be! A moderate carbonation combines with a firmly malty body to leave it creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor re-itereates what the nose indicated with a rich, caramel-soaked malt that's infused with piney/citrusy hops. A firm bitterness balances this big beer without going over the line; and leaves it quite drinkable (still, it is a bit filling). Really well-balanced! It finishes dry with a swiftly disintegrating maltiness followed by a flash of bitterness and then some residual piney hop flavor. An exceptional beer that's well worth seeking out."
"The usual IPA orangish amber in color, and nice and clear. Great white head that stays extremely well! It's well presented. Big points for that. Pine hits you first when you take a whiff of this. A big malt backbone comes through underneath it. As for the taste, it's rather smooth for an IPA. No overwhelming bitterness, but it maintains the big character flavor profile that I like. Hops do play a big role though. In the front, some rind-like and leafy hop character makes its presence known. Malt stays in the background, but it's like a cloud over the sun in Phoenix, you don't pay it much heed but you know it's there making everything more comfortable for you. In the middle and back, malt is ready to come out more, and it's got a very nice ""buttery"" sweetness to it. A bit bready. The bitterness shows up in the finish, nice and crisp. Well, I think this is a very enjoyable IPA, I'll definitely have it again, hopefully more than a few times. It seems a bit underrated to me. But it's all in one's own taste, right? I'd say definitely give it a try and see for yourself!"
"This beer came in a 22oz with a cool label. The beer poored a beautiful copper color, which was a surprise for an IPA. The smell and taste are all IPA though. Great Citrus smell and flavor. Also, the maltiness isn't sublte, which I like. This is a big beer, though most of the bitterness is actually in the aroma. There isn't a strong bitter body to it, though i'm not sure what the IBU level is. I'll definately have this again."
"A good, if standard, IPA"
"Nice shiny copper body with a good head. The aroma is sweet and citricly hoppy. The flavor is nicely malty with a lightly sweet breadiness that makes me want more of this. The problem comes in the hops that, while nicely bitter, lack a certain zing and has a slightly medicinal quality. Man, I hope I can manage to figure out this malt profile and the one in Anchor Liberty for my own homebrew when I start next week."
"Drinkability: A well-balanced pale ale. Not as assertively-hopped as some of my favorite IPA's, but not bad. Personally, I just like my IPA's a little hoppier."
"Clear orangeish/gold in color, with a thin but persistant head. Big, tart citric hop aroma -- very crisp and lemony, with an underlying caramel sweetness. Flavor too is big on hops, citric in flavor with a very bitter finish and an aftertaste combining biscuity malt and fruity hop flavors. A bit of a solvent-like flavor mid-palate, which is a bit distracting, and unexpected for a beer whose alcohol level is quite moderate. Crisp and drinkable, but not one of my favorite IPAs."
"P.S. S**t, I've just realized this beer is 7% - Take Care!"
"Amber gold in color with a chunky pure white head that left exceptional lace patterns. Fresh hop scent, taste was very nice, not overpowering like some domestic IPA's. I thought just right. Carbonation was on the low side, much like English ale. A great IPA, easily the best domestic one I have had. While I will buy it again and enjoyed it totally, drinkability rating was lowered due it's fairly high alcohol content and it only coming in those damm 22oz bomber bottles. Enjoyed it with a deli sandwich. This beer gets better and better, I have just upped it's rating due to realizing how great this beer is. Tremendous appearance, aroma, and taste. yes it's my favorite IPA, and my favorite domestic brew! A total winner."
"Wow, is there anything this beer cannot go with. This clean looking amber beer seems to accent nicely with whatever you're eating. Full hop flavored, yet not too over powerful with hops. Nice citusy aroma that tickles the nose. Thin head and not much lace in the glass. Another great product from Bear Republic. This is one beer that you cannot go wrong with if you love IPA's."
"This is a wonderful beer.  Sitting in Healdsburg, pondering the bicycles and pondering this beer.  So rich, great balance of malt and hops, but the finish - bordering on one of the best IPA's.  One of life's pleasures."
"Wow,I really love this beer. The balance if just great. There is a little bitterness in the finish, with a hint of lemon. I would put this beer as one of my favorites. One sip and I couldn't imagine anyone not loving the taste and balance hops and yeast of this beer!"
"A superb example of living beer."
"Another damn fine west coast IPA.  A nice gold/orange color with that familiar Cascade smell and piney undertones.  Head retention is good, but it leaves minimal lace on the glass.  I'd enjoy it more with a bit more malty sweetness, but I'm not complaining."
"Hazy golden with fine particles of matter in suspension. Nice bubbly and rocky white head. Piney/citrus aroma. I can taste a little sting of alcohol in this one. But it also has a really good bitterness. Nice malt backbone and good hop tones. Slight pine and citrus on the palate. Easy drinking brew. Good IPA."
