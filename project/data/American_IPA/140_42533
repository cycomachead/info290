Broke my cardinal rule of checking dates on IPAs... however, I guess that this one is still within the acceptable window (107 days since bottled)... I guess you always wonder what could have been. In his defense, I haven't seen it there, so... Anyways, here goes. Poured from a bomber ($7.99) into my snifter. Rich amber hue with a small head (lacing galore) with a unique lemon meringue hue. Really had to work for the aroma, and was able to detect some hints of citrus, almost like lemon peel, and a bit of booze as well. Crisp bitterness on the taste, nice clean (Sierra Nevada style) aftertaste. Would have to imagine that some of the hop flavor has faded. Great, continual carbonation and a nice light mouthfeel. Excellent after 4 hours in the yard, quite refreshing. Overall, there were some unique aromas and flavors going on, and I think that I will definitely want to try this around May next year.","Mikus","Aug 09, 2014"

I enjoyed it so much, I went on a wild goose chase looking for it at all the local beer stores with no avail, I asked a beer store if they would get it on the next shipment and sure enough it came in! I will be picking more of this up, that is for sure. The beer has so much to offer, and yet it is so smooth with a perfect blend of flavors and aromas. Its balance has no offensive flavors to speak of. If you want an excellent fresh hop ale look no further, this is a must get cheers!","DrinkMoreBigBeers","Jul 30, 2014"

Different from it's northern hemisphere counterparts, any fan of IPA or Sierra Nevada or even the ""Enjoy by"" from Stone will love what they've done here.

Orange amber with cloudy activity, yeast or hops. Medium body, excellent carbonation. Fresh hops have a whole other flavorless bite & smooth.

4.18,3.2,5,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,"BOD 4/24/14. Pours a clear medium amber with a moderate dark ruby cast. Massive head with superb lacing and retention. Moderate nose of citrus and pine hops over a light sweet caramel background. Almost medium bodied with a smooth texture. Slightly below average carbonation with very little effervescence on the finish. A very unique flavor profile that is complex and well balanced. Less bitter than it's Northern counterpart, this variant focuses more on hop flavor. It begins with a blend of citrus and pine, then flows into a bit of dankcentric with a spicy counterpart. Throughout all of this, a slight caramel sweetness is noted in the background. The finish is a bit dry which leaves a touch of sweet bitterness. An outstanding ale!","tillmac62","Jun 23, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, lime, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, lime, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, lime, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice fresh hop IPA. All around good complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. It is not as bold as most IPAs, but is still a very enjoyable offering overall.","superspak","Jun 18, 2014"

Yeah, that's a great set of flavors, but Sierra Nevada imparts them in all their IPA's, it seems (kinda like the nutiness from New Belgium). However, as this one warmed, it became incredibly good. The incredibly aromatic and spicy New Zealand hops really worked well with the generous malting, creating and awesome boquet of flavors. If this beer could find a way to incorporate the amazingly fruity charactersitics of the hops with a more subdued malt billing, this beer would be almost perfect.","McStagger","Beers"

It's fresh hops do the same with undercurrents of sweet caramel dribbled over pineapple and honeydew melon with a bouquet of delicate floral notes throughout.

Smell of heavy pine and hemp, may have been more complex on a fresher date. Big hop flavor, not super citrus more on the piney spicy side with some hints of lemon and grapefruit. A nice sweet malty backbone at the very end. Hops dominate but the malty sweetness at the end as a bonus. Have had this a few times, this being the first review. I imagine the caramal l malts to have more of a part in this brew when fresher but a solid brew still and for the price still totally worth it!","Mrappinin","Sep 17, 2013"

4.42,9.1,5,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"2013 release breaking in my new DFH IPA glass. Pours a clear golden-orange with a massive fluffy white head that barely fades at all, and leaves tons of sticky delicate lacing when it finally does. Smell is big aromatic hops; juicy citrus, leafy/herbal/minty, soft pine and citrus rind, nutty and spicy alcohol and malt, some caramel malt too. Taste is clean caramel malt at first, then blown away by all sorts of hops. Crisp leaf, spicy herbal and mint, juicy citrus and fruit, pine, and then a good bite of bitterness at the end. Finish is slightly sticky, with hints of the malt hanging around, but mostly it's bitterness. A hell of an IPA, just like its Northern Hemisphere Harvest sister; a must-try for hop-heads.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Aug 14, 2013"

Hops star to come out in the middle: very tea-like, with floral notes. Some toastiness develops in the finish along with a bitterness that grows like a ""slow burn"" of some chiles. I almost pick up some watermelon flavors; not sure if it's the yeast or a character derived from the hops. Solid mouthfeel all around. Good carb and not thick or sticky.

4.33,6.9,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,"what an unreal brew, something so special to have a fresh hop ale in the spring months. the freshness of this beer is top notch. it pours a darker copper share, nice and clear, with an excitable off white head an inch high. the nose is citrusy hops, really juicy, but also plenty bitter, and the pale malt profile is just right as balance. the hops really shine in the flavor, and there is some pineapple type of tropical complex that I seem to always get from hops from new Zealand, although I am largely unfamiliar with these specific varietals. this beer oozes sierra Nevada quality, it is just a work of art. every bit as delicious as the northern, this is a beer I could happily drink every single day. the feel rocks, its soft and creamy, almost cask like, but well carbonated and very refreshing. the color is darker but the body is light, and I find 6.7% abv to be exactly what I like in an ipa I am going to drink all day. I just wish this was available all the time, its everything I want in a beer and nothing I don't, an exceptional product from sierra Nevada, who in many ways is still the kind of hop.

Tastes of caramel and pine with some earthy peppery characteristics and a dry finish. The hops in this don’t “stick out” in the way I’d expect from a fresh-hopped ale, nor do they exhibit the vibrancy I’ve come to expect from Southern Hemisphere (New Zeeland) hops.

From the start of things, the look is inviting, but the aroma tapers off into metallics, adjuncts, and overpowering maltiness. This actually plays well into the flavoring, as the strong grain base is enough to balance the dark, bittering Pacific hop varietals. Thus, the flavoring remains robust and interesting throughout, helping in large part to make this guy a success.","TheBrewo","Feb 22, 2013"

Smell is of malt and some earthy herbal hop aromas. Taste is of malt, herbal hops, and alcohol. There is a fairly high amount of hop bitterness that lingers on the palate long after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but the mouthfeel is off and the bitterness is quite high which lessens the drinkability in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 01, 2012"

This is a very malty beer, not what I expected, although I have never had a beer focusing on fresh hops. I can imagine that the fact that the fact that the hops are fresh may effect the bitterness. There is little hop flavor, the malt overpowers all. It is refreshing and it does have a good mouth feel, but it tastes a bit much like a barleywine. This is one of the least bitter ales I have had from Sierra Nevada, not what I expected. Perhaps this bottle may be old or mishandled, I did by it off of a dry self from my local grocery store. Too bad Sierra Nevada obfuscates their bottle dates, I'm not in the mood to decipher their code.","omokoro","Jun 27, 2012"

Smell is tangerine, pine, grass, and hints of carmel. Taste is a very balanced citrus, with a grapefruit finish. Body is medium large, plenty of life, lush, and drinkable.

Pours a clear medium to dark orange amber, nice two finger white head with excellent retention and nice lacing. A great presentation. Piney and herbal fresh hop aroma with a hint of malt. Creamy and medium bodied. Nice hops up front with a modicum of malt support. The finish is piney, herbal hops, slight earthiness with a quiet malt base, which presents the hops nicely. I like sweeter malt bodies on IPAs, but this seems nearly perfectly balanced. A very nice IPA. Will definitely buy again.","LiquidAmber","Mar 16, 2012"

Spicy and very bright and floral in the nose (high grade marijuana buds) with malts present in the background. Dried fruits and spices...Big fruity hops are abundant. Earthy and grainy, the barley malts add a depth that surround the huge amount of hops beautifully. Pine nuts and a tangy finish. Dense, oily feel foamy on the tongue. This beer is really good. It really has the depth and hops of a double IPA. This is a well named brew. Tastes and feels like a harvest. Pairs nicely with turkey and cranberry salad. This is my second bottle this autumn and hope to have more. Great!","JohnWaynes44","Nov 08, 2011"

Solid dry malt body, caramel and toasted bread, solid hop bite, grapefruit an pine. Not very sweet, body is fairly average, with not a rich smoothness to it. I found this beer to be brighter than the northern hemisphere in its hop/beer focus.","manitouman84","0"

The mouthfeel is light to medium and the carbonation is relatively high. Overall this is a fine IPA. The aroma is really lacking, but the taste makes this a good IPA.

4.12,1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Enjoyed on tap at My Place in Newtown, CT this IPA just made my day. A deep copper color with light yellow-orange edges and a honorable light brownish head that holds pretty well. Lacing is solid throughout. The aroma tells you this will meet all your IPA needs with those lovable pine/floral hop combinations and maybe a wheaty overtone to take the sweetness out of it. The flavor marries well to the lead of the aroma, a bright citrus hop mellowed by edible pine and some trace hints of pumpkin I think, though that may be a stretch. This stuff is solidly mid-bodied with a effervescent feel that quenches supremely, goes down way to easily and delivers a nice dose of hop goodness. A classic, highly drinkable west coaster!","Durge","Jul 17, 2011"

Slightly resiny with the hop oils coming through the whole taste, but not too in your face. The hop bitterness and smidgeon of citrus and grapefruit could not complement the malts better. This is the taste of fresh hops. Very complex, but clean and not at all heavy-handed. Same with the malts. I've had other IPAs that have a big barley and caramel malt taste, but they end up taking over the whole taste profile. This is the closest to perfection, as far as balance goes, in an IPA that I've had. I've always believed that Sierra Nevada is one of the most consistent breweries in the U.S. and this is a testament to that.","chodinheaven","Jul 05, 2011"

Smell- buttery, citrusy, tropical fruit flavors. Taste- big citrus, almost tart sour effect. This is a super enjoyable celebration of hops. All the citrus effects are highlighted, none of the bitterness. The malt backbone to this plays second fiddle, but its not needed. Mouthfeel- creamy, rich, nicely carbonated.

The nose definitely does not come on strong, but the taste isn’t a crazy hop bomb either. This is really more of a perfect balance of tart/bitter hops, crispness, and smooth malt rather than a crazy kick in the tongue. Don’t get this expecting some flav-o-ninja to captivate your senses.

Some earhty hops and bready malt are hinting me towards a bitter tasting beer. Sure enough, big time crisp hop offerings akin to bitter grapefruit, maybe even some rind. Alcohol is tasted after the hops and is followed by a bready/sweet malt that balances this beer out nicely. Because of the intense bitterness, the mouthfeel is sharp and prickly at first and then smooths out at the end, creating a great finish.

Avail here in TX and glad I got it fresh this year after somehow missing it last year. Rotation - it's good for what it is but these days I'm in the hop bomb or at least more citrusy camp so wouldn't buy another this year.

Aromas are piney and earthy, big robust hop character, but maintains a malty base. Flavor is bold and has a big malt front that quickly gets pounded over by a huge hop blast. Very earthy and sticky hop character, quite yummy. The caramel malt is well masked by a big blast of piney hops, and a very pleasant bitterness lingers for minutes. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly, but has a good resolution. A solid brew overall, not bad for $5 a bomber.","Tripphop","May 20, 2011"

Very earthy aroma. The taste is bitter up front with a strong caramel finish. Honestly, a little too much caramel tasting malt for me. Even a little alcohol on the finish. The bitterness is not very flavorful, just bitter. This beer smells a lot better than it tastes. Overall - probably wouldn't buy again. I have no problem finishing it, and it is enjoyable to drink, but there are much better options out there. I'll take Torpedo for half the price.","atowle25","May 16, 2011"

Light floral and pine hop aroma with a touch of orange zest and fresh grassy and caramel malt undertones. Medium bodied with a smooth oily feel with a resinous feel at the end. Carbonation is somewhat subdued. Floaral and light cirusy orange flavors in the front and into the middle that transition to a bitter hoppy pine finish.

The nose has a descent balance of citrus and hops aromas, and the hops are slightly subdued. Subdued is not the word for the flavors. Grapefruit tastes explode on the tongue, and the hops are actually balancing the citrus sweet flavors in this case. Hops are a dry flavor with some peppery highlights, and it does a good job of bringing some sharpness to the round, sweet and tart grapefruit flavors. The beer is slightly dry and very crisp in mouth, and it has a very subtle aftertaste of hops. The finish is surprisingly quick. I was actually expecting a lingerer for this brew with all the aromas and flavors, but it vanishes in mouth. Very tasty brew, and the quick finish makes this a fairly easy drinker.","GarthDanielson","Beers"

The same can be said of the spicy bite of the hops. I appreciate the pine flavors, although it isn't entirely noticeable. So, like I said in the beginning, I like these beers, including the Harvest pale ale, but it's simply not extraordinary enough for me to laud it. The bottom line is that it's good, but it's not distinguishable enough from Sierra Nevada's regular Pale Ale.","BeardedRiker","Feb 04, 2011"

Easy drink at 6.7% but the taste got tiresome for me. The New Zealand hops just don't agree with my buds too much. A good beer, just not something I will seek out again.","kaseydad","Jan 23, 2011"

3.99,-1.5,5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"22 ounce bomber. I've always liked the idea of Sierra Nevada's Harvest line, beers brewed with ingredients from specific places. 2010 vintage. I really like the label on this bottle. Reminds me a little bit of a map from the 1600s. Poured into a basic glass. I like the head retention on this beer, it looks almost oily. The color of the brew is burnt orange, almost like the crayon color of my youth. Light aroma that I'm guessing may be due to the beer's age - the website states this was bottled way back in April. Interesting flavor profile. More malty than I was expecting, but again I'm betting this is due to the age. As my palate adjusts I get more hop character in the nose, but it's still not as much as I was expecting. Gets better the more I drink it. Pretty easy to drink really. The body and flavor of this beer is just really well balanced and quite delicious. It's a nice beer that straddles the line between their Pale Ale and their Toperdo. Nicely done.","eclaycamp","Aug 08, 2010"

The flavor was of malt, nutty, and a slight hop flavor. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew that was very smooth going down.

The whole Tom Friedman thing, hops from one corner of the globe being in another within a week of harvest, etc. But still, when it's all said and done, as an IPA, compared to the field, it's a middle-of-the-road effort, through no fault of the brewer.","bigeyedfish","Jul 21, 2010"

Pretty good, yet standard aroma. Surprisingly thin body and not much malt presence, some sips taste almost watered down (that could be from drinking too many DIPAs). Nice, mellow hop presence. A little citrus is a nice contrast from the aroma. This is a decent IPA, well done from Sierra Nevada. For a widely available, seasonal beer, this is worth picking up if you need a quick hop fix. There are definitely better one's out there, but this will do just fine. Definitely a good one for friends who are curious about hops, but aren't ready for DIPAs.

Taste is a nice balanced grassy/floral/earthy/piney/citrus balance, bitter but not scalding to the tounge. Amazingly fresh dreied grain profile, the star of these Fresh/Wet hop beers from SN in my opinion. Medium bodied, slick, somewhat oily and bubbly.

I couldn't any longer so I took a nice big gulp of this beer and I was not disappointed. It was delicious and refreshing.

Pours extremely nicely with great color, good head and very good lacing. Smell is solid with a lot of straw and earth. First sip was underwhelming. As it warmed, the taste improved but never hit a high note. Definitely a value for the price but lacking, in my opinion, in its overall flavor and balance.

A bit of a subdued nose from what I was expecting, but definitely complex and pleasant. Lots of caramel and vanilla with a nice malty sweetness and earthy undertones of fresh hops. The flavor is all fresh hops. Initially there's very little evidence of the sweetness that was present in the nose. This really lives up to the fresh hop ale name. It's easily the freshest hop flavor I've ever had. The caramel malt sweetness peaks its head out on the finish, but it's quickly overtaken by the hoppy bitterness. Very drinkable beer. I'm on my second bomber! Sierra Nevada does it again!","beerdrifter","May 24, 2010"
4,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4,"This poured a clear copper with moderate light tan head. It smelled like pine and citrus hops with a little earthy caramel malt. It tasted like earthy pine hops with copper and some caramel malt. It was slightly thick with a little carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this wasn't too different from any other Sierra Nevada pale ale, which isn't bad but it's not exciting. Good body and easy to drink. The earthiness from fresh hopping was subtle but noticeable. I personally prefer a cleaner and sweeter hops (Lagunitas?).","Pencible","May 23, 2010"

On the tongue it's a harmonious blend of malts and hops, initially earthy and herbal, then bready and malty. Flavors of tropical fruit and bitter orange peel are faintly detected before a firm herbal bitterness picks up in the finish.

The taste confirmed the herbal/grassy nature of the aroma, with a very dry finish. Medium-bodied, decently carbonated, and again, a very nice dry finish.

Head eventually settles into a solid half-inch cap with delicate strands of sticky lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose reveals grapefruit/citrus on a sweet malt backbone. Taste consistent with nose - sweet and malty, with a pleasant citrus current throughout, as well as some floral hops character. Mouthfeel is light- to medium-bodied with a bright background carbonation and a slightly oily texture on the tongue - does not finish clean, but is somewhat palate cleansing nonetheless.

Dry finish with hints of vegetal, fruity, and herbal hops. One of the most complex hop flavors of any beer I've tried. Medium bodied with ample carbonation to boot. No alcohol presence or warming to speak of. Extremely drinkable on account of every trait of this beer. I was expecting a lot from this beer and it did not disappoint.

Smells hoppy but less so than an average IPA; attractive aromas of lemon citrus and clover honey. Drinking this beer gives me a rush because it taste is immensely powerful. The flavor is perhaps best described as a barleywine-IPA hybrid. Very grapefruity and sprucey hops hit the palate upfront but layers of sweet malts come to rescue a second later and give it very well rounded finish.

The crispness of the hops is very nicely balanced by the fullness and body of the malts, which are much more felt than tasted. Creaminess is present on the palate, but tart dryness is what lingers in the finish. Foam clings heavily to the glass. It is thick and filling, hoppy and thirst-quenching, all at the same time. Unusual dynamics, something different, and very enjoyable precisely for that reason if none other.","BeerNinja007","Jun 17, 2009"

I could taste caramel hints mainly dominated by the floral/citrus charachters though. Lacing is evident. Smooth to swallow. Finish is a bit resiny with a almost woody aftertaste but enjoyable. The drink seems to mellow out and balances out as it warms up. This brew seemed stronger than what I anticapated but is a joy to drink.

Crisp bubbly carbonation, resinous slick sticky mouthfeel, medium body bit of a dry finish. Nice drinker, needs more aroma hops, but easy to drink.

Mild gauziness to the deep bronze color, suggests as much brown as orange, holds light inside the glass nicely. Fresh biscuity toast to the nose but it's really the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus which sparkles here, the strong floral dimension never gets heavy while apricot and peach fruit speak up now and then, field grasses present without any herbaceous bitterness. In the mouth it's full-bodied and manages to convey a dry texture in spite of the ripe sweet tang in the grapefruit, orange citrus. The hops have a sour tightness to them, some tea leaf and tar resin notes too. Carob and cocoa show at times but the malts mostly integrated into the whole package.

Taste is more of the same as the malts and hops hold each other in check - the beer is smooth and creamy with some chewiness, from bread malt I presume, as well as having a sturdy malt base of some roasted and toffee malts.

As soon as the bottle was cracked, a pungent citra-pine aroma slaps you in the face. This is only followed by an intense slam of fresh hop goodness billowing through the air as I pour. The head is like a sticky, fluffy cloud that settles nicely. At first, the mouthfeel was just right, with yummy sweet malts to carry the fantastic hop flavor... But as it warms it almost seems like it should be a little thicker. I guess for an APA, its really quite nice. Anyway, that just enhances the drinkability. Goes down smooth and has the flavors and aromas that are still enough to get me excited each time. Beers like this one are hard to come by. You can tell that they put a lot of work into it to make it just right. As far as superior quality and product goes, SN does it again.

As soon as the glass comes within sniffing distance of the nostrils I know I'm about to get a beer of the highest order. Citrusy, piney resinous hops are there, a slightly yeasty aroma, and a touch of fresh cut grass. The malt character of this beer makes itself known in the mouth, balancing the abundant hops nicely. When the beer falls down the back of the throat there's a bitter finish but the sweet malt remains on the tongue. It doesn't get much better than this. I'm glad this is only available for a short while - you really can have too much of a good thing.

It is very pretty; it has a nice color and is quite clear. There are many tiny bubbles rising up to form a modest white head. The beer has a great hop bouquet that is noticeable as soon as you lift your glass to your face. The aroma is of fresh floral hops. It has a crisp, carbonated, hoppy taste. It is very bitter. This isn't necessarily a bad trait, it just took me by surprise. There is some malty sweetness to the taste hiding behind the strong hop flavor. It has a dry finish. Overall, I think this beer might be a bit to hoppy and bitter for me to drink all night; I prefer a less strong hop presence in a session beer, but I could certainly enjoy a bottle or two in an evening.

Brewed with pale and crystal malts, bittered with Pacific Hallertau and finished with New Zealand's Motueka and Southern Cross; 66 IBUs. It pours a dark coppery hue, unfiltered, with moderate carbonation and two fingers of loose, tan head that leaves big sheets of lacing. Surprisingly light in the nose, with spicy and citric hops. Peppery and citric hops on the palate, with tropical fruits, tobacco, gentle orange pulp and strong citrus zest. Malts contribute light caramel and a little sweetness, while the hop's bitterness slowly becomes stronger and stronger. The body is almost medium, tingly and prickly, with a dry finish, and the flavor is a bit sharp to make it much more than a sipper.

Taste is nice too, again very fresh tasting, some caramel, melon, grapefruit, oranges and citrus, some grass, biscuits, nice fruity hops balance it out very well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth and goes down nice. I dug the hops they used in this, gave it a different element than a lot of other IPA's, it really tasted nice and fresh, good stuff.","Viggo","0"

The smell was underwhelming compared to the taste. The hop taste is super huge, not a super bitter taste, but the power of the hop is used well in this brew. The taste is not over the top, but still is full flavored. The mouthfeel is great because of the hop focus, the bitterness is expected but not experienced. A medium body and a good balance.

The scent of grass and earth are the strongest at first sniff, that is followed by a touch of citrus at the end. The taste surprisingly malty, with very mild bready flavor. The malt last till halfway where a grassy and citrusy bitterness takesover, it blends nicely from the malt and is not ovewrpowering. A medium bodied feel at the front and thinning out at the end. The back of the palate is left dry, after each taste. An evenly balanced beer, though it states it is fresh hopped beer.

Some intermittent lacing. Light to medium carbonated with a very forward hop heavy flavor. Cleary a fresh hopped brew, very 'green' in character and semi-spicy without being as sharp as an IPA.

Fresh hop flavor, a bit of sweet caramel malt, hints of orange and citrus, plenty of pine resin. Smooth, almost creamy in the mouth, goes down rather easily. A fantastic APA, most certainly more tasty and well balanced than their standard pale. Very good, and wish this could somehow be year round.","KeefD","Aug 17, 2008"

The beer actually finishes with a strong hop bitterness that leaves a strong aftertaste, but a nice one. The taste is exceptional and well balanced, another great beer from Sierra Nevada.

I picked up a bottle of this before a radio show I do sometimes and it treated me quite nicely. Pours a beautiful dark gold color with a huge head and a very refreshing amount of carbonation. This is a balanced beer, not an over the top Hop Monster, and with a relatively low < 7%ABV, a very drinkable beer indeed. There's a lot of good malt, a lot of good hop spice, flavor, and aroma, and Sierra Nevada succeeds again in the realm of highly quaffable session beers which aren't boring, bland, or shallow. This is a truly great beer for Summertime when you want something a little on the darker side of a Pale Ale or Lager. Enjoy it while it's around.","brewdogmrb","Jul 01, 2008"
3.82,-5.7,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A light golden ale, darker than straw witha little ruby tint, witha clean, fluffy white head that lingers for a bit. Strong citrusy hop nose, orangey rather than grapefruit continues with a strong fresh hop bite on the palate. Light biscuity malt back bone that's a bit too weak for the hop, as intended, but for me the hop is a bit grassy, chewy, and takes away from the beer overall. Sharp, lingering grassy aftertaste as well. While a noble experiment that I'm glad to have participated in, it misses the mark compared to SN's previous fresh hop ales with American hops.

The nose is of spicy hops, black pepper, and floral hops. The flavor is spicy in the back of the mouth. There is bitterness, but then peppery notes take over, closer to what you find with a tripel, but not the sweet malt profile. There is a buttery coating that seems to come from the hop oils. There is a malt taste that shows up to balance the ale. The body is full and hop oils coat the mouth quite well. I find myself being content with just one sitting of this. It is different in hop characteristic to their Harvest Ale, but that would be expected.

The taste isn't up to the nose, there is an overall sweetness kind of candy like, but not as cloying, not a malty sweetness, I can't figure it out. There is a good spicy hop (peppery) bite at the end of each sip. It gets spicier as it warms up. The mouthfeel is interesting, like an oil slick riding on a clear lake.

Light caramel and biscuit. Also less dry in flavor than smell, with the fresh hop goodness coming through.

Aromatics bring out ripened tropical fruit, citrus rinds, fresh cut green grassiness that just works in a cohesive force. It's like hop perfume basically very aromatic biscuit caramelized malts balance it out nicely. Flavors work so nicely, SN has been doing this for years, lip smacking bitterness fades as the malts blend so cohesively with the big hop layers going on. A perfect marriage of the malt and the hop, citrus rind, tropical fruit, grassy hops collide into a wave of fully fermented malts caramelized sugars breathe a bit of alcohol depth to add more complexity. Mouthfeel is slightly resinous medium bodied but refreshing with each sip, the dichotomy of drinkability and big beer in one glass.

The bitterness is soft, yet substantial. Pine needle and lemon peel lead the way in this area (Southern Cross?). I love the oily texture and slight orange marmalade feel to this (Pacific Hallertau?). And I also get a lemon/lime type of yin/yang thing going on with tropical fruit overtures (Motueka?). To me, this hop profile is very appealing. But why no Nelson Sauvin?

The smell was mildly hoppy in the earth and leafy sort of variety. The taste was divided between the caramel malt backbone and a citrus wave of hops. The finish leaves a moderate bitterness, in fact it left somewhat of a lingering unpleasant bitterness to me that I find in the SN Pale Ale also. Anyway, the taste was actually more similar to SN's other beers that all use Cascade, Centennial, and Chinook. Since this beer doesn't use any of those it surprised me how similar it was.","MiScusi","May 22, 2008"

The beer poured a clear reddish-amber with a thin, rocky white head into a pint glass. Not much of a hop aroma, which was a bit strange. The taste, however, was a fantastic blend of malt sweetness, big hop flavor, building up to a clean, crisp, fairly intense, high-alpha hop finish. SN really knows how to balance the malt and hop profiles in their highly-hopped ales. A great beer.","pershan","May 21, 2008"
4.15,2.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Sierra Nevada Southern Hemisphere Harvest Ale pours a dark orange with a thick white head from a brown twenty four ounce bottle.

4.25,4.9,4.5,4.5,4,5,4,"Pours with a deep red-amber color, with brilliant honeyed highlights and a head that leaves some thick lace in spite of not retaining its form very well. The aroma is certainly identifiable as an APA, but the hop character has an earthy, herbal character about it that is different from that of a lot of American hop varieties. Malts come through, too, with a big measure of honeyed sweetness. On the palate, full bitterness throughout, with bright but soft citrus elements midway through. The finish dries out considerably, and the overall level of fruitiness is low. Great mouthfeel that combines lots of hop bitterness with a substantial, balancing load of caramel malts. Overall, this is excellent stuff. Once again, Sierra Nevada proves that they really know their way around a hoppy ale.","geexploitation","May 21, 2008"

Hoppy flavor, herbal and peppery throughout, hints of apricot, finishing with a solid leafy bitterness and sweet grain. Quite different from most American-made hoppy ales...not so much citrus and resin. Solid medium body, solid bitterness, and solid carbonation. Very nice all around...a different kind of hop bomb.

When poured the beer was crystal clear and the color was pale tinged with red (I guess we can call it a darker shade of pale). The head atop the beer was only about one finger thick, but steady carbonation kept it quite stable, The beer smelled milder than a typical IPA, which has been my experience with most beers using wet hops. Despite the mildness the grassy and floral hop presence was quite notable. The taste was spicy, herbal, and oh so juicy. The lack of aging made the hops taste quite sweet and delicate. The pale malts were sweet and unobtrusively clean. There was a drawn out soft bitterness in the finish. The body was only slightly thicker than their Pale Ale and not quite as thick as Celebration. The mouthfeel was creamy and sticky. I enjoyed this a lot, but I am a hop head, and a beer showcasing hops is going to win me over in more cases than not.","rajendra82","May 16, 2008"

I would say that SNPA has a more noticable hop presence. The feel is moderate with nice carbonation. The finish is quite good, nicely balance, with a perfect subtle grassy hop bitterness.
