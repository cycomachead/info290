4.02,-5.9,3.5,4,4,4,4.25,"On tap at Ashley’s, poured into half pint. Slightly hazy golden color with thick white head that clings nicely. Really fresh smell - hop oils, fresh grass/hay, citrus. Flavors are briefly bready, but quickly yield to bitter citrus, grass, and pine. Medium bodied with higher carbonation and an oily but dry finish. Really enjoyed this.","SierraFlight","Feb 24, 2015"

4.49,5.2,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: This is my favorite IPA i have had from Founders; even better than Double Trouble. The fresh hop character to it is what makes it stand out and the citrus and malt notes round it out superbly. This is one of if not my favorite wet hop ale iv had. I just love that dank quality to it. Its spot on in this style as far as availability goes. Also, at 7.6% abv, this is in that perfect grey area between IPA and IIPA. That being said, i feel this bottle was past its prime with a very subtle malt skunkiness. I can only imagine how much better it is super fresh. When fresh i see myself easily scoring it 4.75. Its that good. Do yourself a favor and seek this out!","Bone53","Jan 20, 2015"

It couldn't be tasted and was overshadowed by the earthy pine that lingered in the aftertaste. The slight dry-hopped bitterness combined with the balance and soft crystalline sweetness all combined for an amazing mouthfeel that made this irresistible. I loved this beer and am upset that I only have one bottle of this. Founders has a stud of a brew here in a category filled with other heavyweights. If you want to introduce someone to an IPA and what one is capable of, start here. If you love beer, you may want to finish here - balanced beers don't get much better than this.","JerzDevl2000","Nov 25, 2014"

Taste is a big wave of citrusy hop flavor dominated by grapefruit and barely any malt presence to keep the hops in check.  Medium body and lower carbonation combined with a bitter hop finish and dry ending make this very drinkable.  Overall this is one of the better wet hop IPAs but a touch of balance to keep that bitterness in check could have elevated this one more.","HopBomb515","Nov 20, 2014"

Pours a translucent gold with a loose, 1/8th inch, bright white head that quickly dissipates into a froth towards the edges.  Nose expresses grapefruit, floral notes and a hint of spice.  Taste consistent with nose; however, hops presence is a bit subdued.  There's also a pleasant malt backbone.  Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with an even, lightly crisp carbonation and minimal acidity.  Overall, a decent wet hop beer, but I was expecting more.","Jwale73","Nov 14, 2014"

Perhaps that would take from the mystique. Today marks the 41st anniversary of Hall and Oates' Abandoned Luncheonette. No, I'm not in my upper 60's like they are; in fact, my mother is subdued in age to the group I'm most glad she introduced me to while growing up. What does all this mean? I have no idea. All I know is that this beer surpasses Founders' Centennial and All Day. For that alone, it should be on rotation. For reasons undefined, it's not. I take one sip and I hear Daryl crooning: She's gooooone, oh why, I better learn how to face it, she's gone. Yes, she is, but she was damn good while she lasted.","weiserr","Nov 03, 2014"

The beer is clear and, therefore, obviously filtered. The smell has a strong tropical citrus and pine notes with a slightly bready note at the end that makes the smell rather sweet. The taste is similar to the smell. The taste starts off with a citrus and slightly piney hop taste with a slight malt sweetness at the end and in the aftertaste. The beer has a very hoppy aftertaste that lingers for a while. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a bit of carbonation. The beer also has a slightly sticky afterfeel. Overall, a fantastic beer and one worth getting again. The only regret is that it's not more widely available.","HattedClassic","Oct 29, 2014"

Not sure the age of the bottle I got, but it could have been on the shelf for a while. I couldn't find a date. Some citrus and pine combined with caramel. Taste was very good, but again the hops had probably faded a bit as they are not 'in your face'. Nice balance of sweet caramel and bitter hops with just a bit of citrus and pine flavor. Overall, its good but I was hoping for more from this. Its solid and I'll try it again, but hopefully a fresher bottle.","FFreak","Jul 30, 2014"

It had a nice earthy leafy aroma upfront on the nose, hints of citrus, underlying grain notes and mild hop character. The hops came through more on the palate alongside some citrus notes, slight bitter flavor, bready grains and a touch of earthiness. The brew was light in body with a fair amount of carbonation and a clean crisp finish.","Gobzilla","Mar 19, 2014"

My first wet hopped IPA. Poured from a bottle into a stamddard pint glass. Generous head that quickly fades but leaves nice lacing on the glass. Nose is just a bit piney compared to other IPA's I've had. Maybe it's th wet hopped style. Very clear compared to other IPA's as well. Taste is fantastic. It's delicious. This is so good it's almost sessionable. Wow! I think this is better than Founders Centenntial IPA. I love this beer!","BreakfastStout","Dec 31, 2013"

Beautiful golden color, nice wet hop aroma, distinct simcoe, and beautifully malted. What really stands out is the fresh hop citrus flavors that explode on the palate, balance the key here. Really perfect juicyfruit mix, lemon, pineapple, grapefruit finish. Very smooth and easy drinking, though the second does get a little sugary sweet in the finish. Amazing, last year I passed on this because I really didnt care for it the year before. This is my third four pak, the beer is even better now than one month ago as the fresh, green piney notes have dimmed, leaving the citrus to shine. One of this years best.","RacerX5k","Nov 18, 2013"

The balance on this beer is amazing b/c at times it's almost sticky sweet, then there is a bready fullness, almost chewey beer, and then it has this sharp, cutting hoppiness of grassy and wet hops. Really comes together and there's a crisp finish on the backend that is pleasing.","clayrock81","Nov 16, 2013"

Ultimately the bottom line is this is a very good beer. Just because I was hoping for phenomenal should not take away from the truth of that.","kemoarps","Nov 10, 2013"

Smells of grapefruit, lots of floral notes, pine, dank, sweet carmel undertones as well. Taste starts with the grapefruit, some pine, along with quite a bit of bitterness. Then in the middle, the malt mellows out the bitterness. Get a lightly toasted flavor as well as a good amount of carmel sweetness. Then on the back end that sweetness blends nicely with the fruit flavors that have lingered throughout. Get a bubblegum flavor, along with some grapefruit, floral, and pine, and dank. Bitterness lingers, but is mellow. Nice carbonation that makes the beer crisp, refreshing, and easy to drink. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Well done wet hopped IPA.","brewskis","Nov 08, 2013"

A snow white head settles into a white ring leaving minimal lacing. Intense aromas of grapefruit, pine resin, pineapple, and, well, wet hops fill your nose. Layers of hops coat the palate followed by a massive amount of citrus and a light touch of yeast. Great acidity makes your mouth water for more followed by the quintessential hop bitterness.

Wonderfully fresh hop aromas of citrus and resiny pine. Swirl the glass, take a whiff, and grapefruit rind becomes more apparent. One of the most aromatic IPAs I've had. Sharp bitterness greets the tongue, leading to a pithiness and dryness on the finish. 70 IBUs sounds about right. The malt body is well in the background, light and cracker-like. Bitter citrus rind and some resin are at the forefront. Mouthfeel hits all the right notes with respect to carbonation and hop oils. Having tried this, my enthusiasm for Sierra Nevada Celebration is admittedly dulled a bit - Founders Harvest truly showcases the beauty of fresh, wet hops.","gr0g","Nov 02, 2013"

Bitterness is bold but oddly not overwhelming. Not balanced but one of the most pleasing and refreshing bitter flavors I've ever tasted.

The nose has a smell of grapefruit and some sweeter citrus fruits like orange, papaya, and mango. I get that same grapefruit and sweet citrus profile on the front of the tongue, which reminds me of Cigar City Jai Alai, but then it leaves a stinging bitterness with not much of a malt backbone to balance out the taste. The body is medium with a high carbonation that intensifies the sting you get from the bitterness. An interesting beer, and a good one, but not among my favorite IPAs.","itsscience","Oct 31, 2013"

The smell is piney with citrus rind. The taste is near perfect. Enough brightness and citrus on the front that blends into a piney bitterness with a clean, crisp finish. You can tell this beer is fresh and it shines. Really hit the spot, and it's a top notch ale. You do get a hint of the booze on the finish too.","PHBoiler","Oct 30, 2013"

Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with herbal and spicy hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid fresh hop quality in both the aroma and flavor.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 28, 2013"

Pours a yellow orange, with a beautiful sticky one inch white head, not a ton of lace, but attractive stuff that does stick behind. Smell is very floral, mango, tangerine, hints of Marijuana, and pine. Taste is bigger than the nose would have expect, just delicious fresh hops, floral and tropical in the start and some dank marijuana and grapefruit in the finish. Body is large for a single IPA, almost an extra IPA to me, perfect amount of life, not really dry, and so dang drinkable. Going to drink many of these in the next month.","SawDog505","Oct 19, 2013"

An alluring nectar sweet hop forward aroma gently lifts into the nose with hints of lemon rind and pine. Lush hops glide through in the mouth feel with nonabrasive but dominating bitterness. Smooth flowing, incredibly well balanced IPA packed with all that hop goodness. An instant classic in my book.

Lovely, piney aroma with some nice orange and pineapple scents. Taste is just as it smells. I love how this one lacks in the malt department. Great for not being from the west side. Delicious, well-balanced bitterness with great pine and citrus flavors. Citrus rules here, but there is a hint of tropical hops. Great bitter finish with a bit of grapefruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a crisp, refreshing finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a great IPA that I wish I had readily available over here in California (I know it's greedy of me).","DovaliHops","Dec 11, 2012"

Fresh clean citrus hops are in the forefront of the smell with a bit of pale malt in the base. Well there is no doubting that this is an IPA as the taste is all hops. The west coast citrusy hops dominate upfront and all the way to the finish with lemon, orange and grapefruit flavors combined on top of enough malt to provide balance. The mouthfeel is right for an IPA with good body and carbonation, the hops provide great tingly liveliness and a puckeringly dry finish. Overall this is a very nice IPA, wet hop character provides assertive bitterness and the clean hop flavors are just great, I'm definitely pleased.","fank2788","Dec 01, 2012"

There was such a floral blend of hops, with earth and citrus, while sweetness and light malts came in to cut and balance. This left the drinker feeling light and airy, and excited to sip. This was, however, disappointing. The flavoring was relatively one-dimensional, with huge, raw bitterness from start to finish. While this gave nice robustness to the palate, it really washed away many of the other balancing aromatics. The feel was equally as thin, and felt a little cheap off the lip, taking away further from the experience.","TheBrewo","Nov 28, 2012"

This beer had good drinkability, if I was really in the mood for hops I could see drinking two of these, they were pretty smooth and not overly bitter with more then enough flavor to hold my attention, I wish I could drink this all year round. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was spectacular, it had that dank and resinous hops aspect combined with a great bouquet of tropical fruits that seemed to steal the show, one of the best aromas I have ever encountered. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, after drinking a few of these I can't think of one single thing I didn't like or would change, this beer is great just the way it is. I would for sure buy this beer again, it's a little pricey, but it's worth every penny, if this was available year round it would be a regular in my fridge, I highly recommend this beer to anyone who likes hoppy beers, I don't think fresh hopped beers can get much better then this one, it's for sure worth seeking out. All in all I was very impressed with this beer, it really delivered that huge punch of fresh hopped flavor and aroma that made this beer very enjoyable. Founders Harvest Ale, is now my favorite wet hopped beer, it's so damn good it's now my favorite hoppy beer from Founders, they really did an awesome job with this beer, it blew my mind with just how tasty this beer was, great job guys, with beers like this it's no wonder that Founder's is one of the best Brewery in the country, I highly recommend this one.","StoutHunter","Nov 14, 2012"

4.23,-0.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Founders Harvest Ale pours surprisingly light. It's goldenrod in color and crystal clear, topped by a finger and a half or so of white foam. Head retention is pretty good, and does a nice job of coating the glass with lacing. The nose is wonderfully floral, with a strong grapefruit aroma supported by a secondary pineapple note. The flavor does allow the malt bill a little room to feature as well. Bready and more caramel flavors are both appreciable. The bitter bite is attention grabbing, but not palate scorching. As with the aroma, the finish features a strong grapefruit presence, offset by a subtle tropical fruit, pineapple flavor. The body isn't quite bone dry, but it's damn close. The carbonation falls just short of being lively enough to make the mouthfeel great. Founders Harvest Ale is a delightful IPA, better than Centennial in my opinion, and it's a shame it only comes around once a year.","axeman9182","Nov 06, 2012"

4.45,4.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Bottled 10/04/2012, poured into a perfect pint glass. About a finger of white head disappears within a couple of minutes, leaves some lacing on the glass, not much. Color is a nice blend of light golden orange, some haze to it, but relatively clear; holds light well. Aroma at first introduces mild grapefruit and floral notes, but balances out with more a more mellow earthiness to it. I also get a bit of malt character. Taste is superb. It's like a much more hoppy All Day IPA, with added ABV. Mild hop flavors, sweetness, and well, no dry finish. Small amount of malt in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is very pleasant, even refreshing, with balanced carbonation and smoothness. Overall I really like this, but what Founders don't I enjoy. I guess this in the bottom half of Founders for me, but still great. I had it on tap at a tasting back in March or so and thought it was just OK. This is much better. I tend to enjoy Founders more in a bottle. I'll look for more of this, only grabbed two bottles last time. Cheers.","rodlavers","Nov 01, 2012"

This is what an IPA should smell like! The flavor is very nice, but a bit of a letdown after the awesome smell. The fruitiness doesn't come through as prominently as expected after the aroma, nor is it as sweet as I had anticipated. That said, it's still quite good, it's citrusy, grassy and a bit grainy with a light biscuity malt characteristic and a more-bitter-than-expected finish that lingers. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer, but it seems to be more in line with the 2010 version that I liked, but didn't love, than the 2011 version which absolutely blew me away. Last year's was a little sweeter and more fruity, which balanced out the grassy, grainy qualities of the beer a little better.","starrdogg","Oct 26, 2012"

Resinous, dank, grapefruit, and apricot aromas atop a sweet sugary base waft into my olfactory system. The flavor is a hint of bready and caramel malt up front before the palette is filled with hoppy goodness. Pine and resinous topped citrus and tropical fruit flavors tip the flavor balance well onto the hop side. Light to moderate hop bitterness. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. I felt this was a touch on the sweet side, but I really enjoyed it nonetheless.","johnnnniee","Oct 20, 2012"

Opens with citrus, sweet and juicy pineapple joined slightly sweet biscuity malt, finishes semi-dry with just the right amount of grapefruit rind bite. Medium-bodied, sticky, and oily mouthfeel with a perfect level of gentle carbonation. In my opinion, the most exceptionally well balanced wet hop IPA I've had the pleasure of enjoying.

4.47,4.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from a bottle into a brand spankin' new Firestone Walker tulip. Pours a hazy, translucent straw hue with a finger and a half crown of foam that dissipates after a minute or two, leaving some sparse lacing behind on the sides of the glass. The nose is a real winner. What a hop profile. Nearly absent of the citrus quality many IPA's have, this is real subtle and mellow, but hoppy nonetheless. The taste is neither piney nor a citrus bomb. Again, the hops are at the forefront, and while they're far from burgeoning, they're not meek either. It's just a perfect, mellow hop presence. The mouthfeel has a decent bitterness to it that trails off into a creamy finish. This is a real smooth beer, and one that I love, and anyone who wants a more sedate representation of the style would thoroughly enjoy this.","Retail1LO","Dec 20, 2011"

Taste is big on the pine and resin with a powerful initial bitterness, but is quite mild in the end. Overall if you are a big piney IPA fan the you might of found one of your favorites. Very good, but I prefer the tropical citrus ipas.","ChrisSimpson1968","Dec 17, 2011"

4.5,5.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5," This harvest beer is wonderfully juicy with bitter flavor up front setting you up for a strong peppery orange rind combo and some tea-like herbal taste riding along. The flavor has a subtle tinge of mango and pine pokes through in places with a mild toastiness from the malt that only emerges momentarily til a light apricot mellow earhty flavor and fruit accent comes in. There is a slight touch of lemon oil with citrus juiciness, but the vegetal element of the hops is minor as it finishes. Overall -the best Harvest or wet hop whatever the style. the hop taste is so refreshing and only a mild amount of vegetal is introduced with very vibrant hops and enough balance to satisfy fans of the style without going toward 'hop assault'. This has that resiny hop tangy flavor after the swallow telling you it is a seriously hop forward beer.","Slatetank","Dec 13, 2011"

In the aroma, I detect pineapple, flower petal, pine needles, and a bit of grassy, savory undertone. The latter note mentioned is slightly off putting. The taste is fantastic with fresh hops dominating - it starts off bright and ends with a bitter finish. Pleasant medium mouthfeel. Less dry than most IPAs. It's a hit!","Neorebel","Nov 05, 2011"

4.6,7.7,5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a very deep gold for an IPA, and reminds me of Belgian strong pale ales I've had in the past in color. Nose is crazy citrus, with a nice yeasty malty background. Flavor follows suit, with some sweet citrus and toffee and malt flavor. I could literally drink this beer all day if it came to Maryland. Great example of a wet hop IPA.","finewinemike","Nov 01, 2011"

4.11,-3.7,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pretty impressed by this beer. I was apprehensive as it smells like Devil Dancer-lite, and if it tasted as such, I was going to like only marginally more than the disfavored Devil Dancer. I was pleasantly wrong. Citrus up front cuts into a decisive piney bitterness that quickly dissipates into a very pleasant crispness. It's something I could drink a whole lot of really quickly.","Franch","Oct 26, 2011"

4.42,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a pint glass from 12oz bottle. Pours a light amber-orange body with slight haze and small white head. Aroma bursts with notes of fresh fruit - orange, grapefruit, and some citrus - and has some bready notes as well. Mouthfeel is way lighter and smoother than expected. The hop is very restrained with notes of citrus and grapefruit hop lingering in the background. Very slight malt in the finish as well. Although, this beer is extremely smooth and masks the 6.5% abv very well. What a great Harvest Ale!","CuriousMonk","Oct 25, 2011"
4.32,1.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Drink- This is a good tasty little beer. Very smooth, balanced and crisp. The low IBUs matched with the citrus do a wonderful job together. Would love to have more of these.","FosterJM","Oct 24, 2011"

3.58,-16.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The appearance of this offering from Founders is a golden tone with a bright white head. It has a nose of lemon, pine and some subdued hops. While the taste has some spices such as sage and cloves. The citrus hops are also present, with more lemon and some grapefruit. MF is medium with a lower carbonation level. All in all, a pretty good beer, but not one of my favorites from these guys out of Michigan.","mltobin","Oct 22, 2011"

4.35,1.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer is orange and mostly clear, with a small white head that leaves sparse lacing in it's wake. The aroma is of dank hops, with fresh citrus, herbal, and floral notes. Wonderful, though lacking strength. The taste...wow. Fabulous. So fresh. Glass almost gone already. Oops, got a little too excited there. Fresh hops, not much malt...superb. Founders Harvest Ale showcases hops brilliantly with this autumn release. A must try.","Huhzubendah","Oct 18, 2011"
4.34,1.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Overall, this is a very nice example of a wet hopped ale and it's well worth picking up. It's also nice finding a seasonal ale that can make the most out of the hops while they're around and fresh from harvest.","BBP","Oct 18, 2011"
4.47,4.7,4.5,5,4,4,5,"Genuine hop juice here. An outstanding effort to capture the essence of hops, while having enough malt backbone to stand on its own. Bravo.","cnally","Oct 17, 2011"
3.73,-12.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"overall: i was a little underwhelmed on this one. a seasonal by founders carrys some clout with it, but this wasnt quite as good as others by founders. it drinks very easily and it has enough hop to it to make it an overall good beer. just dont get as excited for this one as backwoods bastard, KBS, etc. dont get me wrong tho, its worth a pick up if you love founders beer","mobius387","Oct 17, 2011"
4.17,-2.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer is really good, and founders should be proud. Though I am one who thinks many BA's fret too much over the age of their IPA, this is one that probably will fade noticeably, being a fresh hop ale that is still quite fresh. The hop flavor and aroma are both very bright. If single IPA's typically had this kind of hop flavor, with its relatively moderate bitterness, maybe I would be less into DIPA? If you like hops and can get this fresh (or even fresh-ish), you should.","sprucetip","Oct 17, 2011"
4.5,5.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: I really enjoyed this ale. It has layers of flavors that are pretty common with Founders and yet again did not disappoint me. A favorite as far as a seasonal brew for me.","kennylopez","Oct 17, 2011"
4.35,1.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Overall I would pick up more of this if it were available in my area without hesitation. There is allot of complexity to the taste. Heck, I just enjoyed the burp after finishing this review.","redblacks75","Oct 17, 2011"

4.47,4.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O - Another solid performer from Founders. Picked up a 4-pack of this and will definitely look for another when I'm back in the US next. Too bad you can't store it, I'd love to hoard a bunch of this for summer.","StarshipPoopers","Oct 15, 2011"
3.95,-7.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This is an outstanding example of a wet hopped ale. It's piney, resiny and really fresh. There is just enough malt to balance out the hops, but don't be fooled, the hops are the main attraction. Some citrusy tones would have really put this beer over the top. As it stands it is well worth seeking out.","dgugliuzza","Oct 15, 2011"
4.05,-5.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O: A great beer. A touch much on the grapefruit. Could've mellowed it a bit with pineapple or a touch more caramel malts, but that's hardly a downfall.","doughanson78","Oct 15, 2011"

4.44,4,4,5,4,5,4.5,"I picked up this beer on a strong recommendation and it didn't disappoint. Easy to drink through this four pack and will look for it again.

Poured a bright golden brown that was slightly cloudy with a nice radiant white head that lingered longer than expected. The taste of this beer is extremely delicious. Great mouth feel that lets you enjoy the fruity hops that you get in the aroma. The flavors are a little more subdued than i had anticipated but not in an overly bad way. I think this beer had been talked up a little too much and I was overly anticipating the flavor. Still a very good beer and I will enjoy the whole 4 pack without a second thought.","TheTot","Oct 13, 2011"

4.47,4.7,3.5,4,5,4,4.5,"Purchased from the Lager Mill in Frankenmuth, Michigan, at the encouragement of a sign stating ""limit 2 per customer"". Pours with a thin head which dissipates quickly leaving behind a good lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops without the familiar, dominating aroma of cascade (grapefruit). This is promising. The first sip, followed quickly by a gulp, is perfectly balanced. Seriously. The hop is there- there's no denying that this is an American IPA- but the malt backbone is just there like a great rhythm section behind the star singer. Very good.","matt20102","Oct 12, 2011"
4.24,-0.7,4,5,4,4,4,"Picked this up along with devil dancer when I got my CBS. Pours with relatively small head into a stella glass. The smell dances on the nose, full of floral and hops.

4.16,-2.6,3.5,5,4,3.5,4,"O: Definitely a solid beer, but at the price point I think I can do a bit better. I would certainly drink this again, but wouldn't necessarily go far out of my way to get any. Worth a shot!","Aberration","Oct 12, 2011"

4.32,1.2,4.5,5,4,4.5,4,"O: Best wet-hopped IPA I’ve ever had. The nose blew me away, just like with many harvest ales I’ve tasted, but the palate was able to back it up this time.

My obligatory wet-hopped comment: tobacco, I get it in every one, it's a nice association, got sharp bite. Big grapefruit here, cleaner than a lot with a slight BO flavor. Dry malt character with sharp prickly carbonation makes this a quite enjoyable wet-hopped IPA. Enjoy thoroughly.","wcintula","Oct 10, 2011"

This one has a nice fresh piney smell along with a sweet pinneapple scent. Upon drinking right away there is a massive hop flavor along with a bit of lemon and grapefruit.

It really almost seems to remind me of a wild yeasty and wheaty kinda of IPA. I will say that this is an amazing brew; i think founders did an amazing an here. I get the resinous of the hops and the overall freshness of the brew. The mouthfeel is great, a little heavy up front but goes down smooth making this an amazingly sessional beer. One thing i will say.. if this brew was made with another 3-4% alcohol content and made to an DIPA i would have so much more respect for this mammoth of a flavorful brew. I mean it has the feel and taste of a DIPA but i just feel like it would pack a bit more punch if an alcohol finish made the last impression.","HOPPYKC","Oct 07, 2011"

3.97,-7,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Bottled just over a week ago. Who doesn't love seriously fresh IPAs? This one pours a mostly clear golden auburn topped by a finger of light khaki foam. The nose comprises pine, sharp grapefruit, sharp cantaloupe, buttery caramel, and peach. The taste seems to focus heavily on the pine aspects, sharpening them even further than in the smell. The fruit isn't nearly as distinct, and the caramel has gone from buttery to spicy. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a pretty solid IPA, but the pine character comes off a bit much for me, especially considering the fruity tones imparted by the smell. Still pretty tasty, though...","TMoney2591","Oct 02, 2011"
4.47,4.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I did one of my crazy person shops today at my local craft beer warehouse. Grabbed a bunch of new exciting bottles and also tossed in a 12 oz of Founders Harvest, never having tried it before but hearing good things. I've also been knocking back a lot of imperial stouts and big IPAs lately, so the idea of a wet hopped ale sounded like the perfect respite for a fatigued palate. MAN, this did NOT disappoint. Founders just knocks it out of the park every time. Really beautiful hazy amber gold color pouring deliciously into a glass with a great crisp head and carbonation popping everywhere. Big, wet, juicy hop smell; piney, citrusy, grapefruity. But the kicker, totally balanced on the palate. That hop taste isn't overwhelming, the body incredibly light and crisp with a fair amount of bitterness and just enough malt to round it out. This feels like the prodigy child offspring of Centennial IPA which had a rounder more dense flavor and Dry-Hopped Pale Ale which has an aggressive hop scent. We got an easy drinker here, just under 7% ABV makes this one I can knock back a few of but still feel impressed with every sip. A super exciting version of Sierra Nevada, just absolutely jumping with flavor but still sessionable.","MrELovesBeer","Sep 30, 2011"

Nose was grapefruit-citrusy with an earthy undertone. Man, I really did what wet hopping will do for a beer! Mouthfeel was silky but with a pleasant hops bite, like a 1-2 combo to the palate. The bitterness was somehow muted, less sharp than many of its counterparts. The mellowing effects were immediate. I had thought that I had (finally) conquered my hop jones, but this was like mainlining. The finish was hoppy, sure, but with an earthy aspect that simply lingered.","woodychandler","Jun 14, 2011"

We are not going for IPA standards of hoppiness, which helps accentuate the more subtle and delicate flavors fresh hop brews can deliver.

4.57,7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Purchased this at Oak Tree Buy Rite in S. Plainfield, NJ. Into a pint glass, it poured a cloudy golden hue with one finger of white; good retention and lacing, and very little visible carbonation. Smelled of bitter herbs, grassy menthol, grapefruit peel, and slightly apple. The taste was initially bitter herbs, followed by apple maltiness and grapefruit, and then finishing off on a dry bitter peel note which lingered. As it warmed to room temperature, I detected more grapefruit in the finish as well. Smooth, creamy medium body. Excellent session pale ale, that is as well balanced as it is flavorful.","donniecuffs","Nov 19, 2010"

Flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma. Lemon and grapefuit. Big hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma for a pale ale. There is almost no malt flavor in this beer, just a straightforward hop lovers delight. I even let the beer warm up to close to room temperature and still got no malt presence. This beer has the body of a pale ale and the hop presence of an ipa.

The hop profile focuses on the flavor not the bitter, which I enjoy. The malt is fairly light and takes a way backseat to the hops. The malt seems quite light for the style but it works. The feel is moderate with tingly carbonation, finishes slightly bitter. This is a very yummy pale ale. Nice hop profile with a light malt makes this extremely drinkable.

Nice aroma of freshly picked hops right off the vine. Quite green and dense with bittering citric floral pollen thats got a rounded lemony/white grapefruit sense to its nature. Taste is a bit more muted and paled down making for some excellent drinking as its rounded off muted maltyness of semi toasty biscuityness and paled doughyness compacts nicely nuder the crunchy citrus tones of the hops. Good balance as it allows just the right kind of grip to its bite in bitterness levels and flavors.

A grassy and pine fragrance strikes the nose, with the feint scent of citrus, mostly grapefruit and lemon. A strong malt flavor, with a hearty bread flavor then halfway across the palate, a hop bitterness brining the flavors of grapefruit, grass, and pine dominate the taste. A slightly thin feel at the front, then gradually gains weight to become more of a medium bodied feel. This beer is drinkable, for a hophead, a strong bright color, an intense aroma, with palate abusing hop flavors. The textures inconsistency does bring the beer down.","cameraman","Jan 09, 2010"

The aroma is as green as I've ever experienced. I think I can accurately describe it as smelling as if there are hop cones still submerged in the beer. And I'm actually surprised that there aren't. The malt bill is reminiscent of that of Founder's Centennial IPA, and Pale Ale, and that is alright by me. The taste is akin to the aroma. The leafy, grassy, hoppy character is very sharp, while the malt profile is nice and soft. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a great beer. If only someone could invent a hop that could be harvested year round so beers like this could be brewed year round.

Too often when we get hopped beers, it becomes a hop bomb, and I am of the persuasion that interesting beers are interesting, but quaffable beers are paragon. The familiar grassy, floral smell of hops is present in the nose, but the taste was not dominated completely by hops. They were there, of course, but played well with the malt too and neither bashed you over the head. That's what I appreciated about this beer.","nanchen","Dec 01, 2009"

Nose is potent punch of grapefruit and grassy hops, slightly sweet, not much else. Very nice, excellent for an APA, though not very complex. Thick bodied with strong carbonation in the dry finish. Flavor throughout is heavy on oily grapefruit hops and earthy/grassy notes, with minimal presence of malt backbone. This is pretty great for an APA, about as much hops and flavor as you could hope for and finishes with a lingering bitter pungent citrus flavor. Overall, the flavor is a little too sweet for more to rate this higher, but this is one of my favorite harvest ales I've had this season.","yourefragile","Nov 29, 2009"

Very nice grainy background with some asprin like tastes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly oily, slight grainyness to it. Very good, non extreeme beer from founders.

4.09,-4.2,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The head crests at about one finger, bleached white and mostly large to very large bubbles which helps it dissipate swiftly, moderate stickiness to the lacing. More dark yellow in color than light orange amber, has a gauziness which traps light inside despite the overall lighter hue. The hops-driven nose is more peat moss and forest floor scrub than grassy, more relaxed and less stiff than expected, orange peel, very light honey, more so pineapple, nectarine bite with softer apricot tones, pine oil, the malts very much in the background. Medium-bodied, here the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus leaps out at you. Resiny pine, more of the forest scrub, has a yeasty side that just manages to carve out a niche. Starts off dry and ends much drier, even as it adheres to your mouth walls it prickles and falls away. Again, little malt balance, a smooth residue at best. Comes across like it serves two masters, one make a big impression, the other stay true to your roots. Very good but not benchmark.","farrago","Nov 13, 2009"

The nose was full of pungent fresh wet hops esepcially citrus/herbal/grassy tones, of course there is a light pale biscuit malt feature addeded in the nose as well. Pretty damn good bitterness balanced with enough pale biscuit malts just to take the edge of it, but as a whole it's a dank super hoppy harvest ale from our friends at Founders...damn I'm going to get some 12.99 4 packs at Giant Eagle this coming week a damn tasty fine beer that should be drank in number meant to be enjoyed with friends. I was buying this for a friend not familiar with the hops and he kept calling it the ""weed"" beer, by the way he was loving it. Mouthfeel was bitter dry clean finish, with ample carbonation and the drinkability factor was inasane for something so hoppy.

The smell is probably one of the better smelling IPAs I've had yet this fall. Very hoppy, citrus but mainly a nice piney hop smell for me. The taste isn't as bitter as I was expecting, but not exactly smooth. Very hoppy, pine hops are there and the citrus hops are a bit more apparent than in the smell. The only real bitterness is in the aftertaste. Not a high ABV so this one I could do the four pack of in a night and it's that good I could.

The usual IPA flavors of grapefruit and pine are noticeable but there's an unusually strong fruitiness to this one. Hard to pin down really, it seems at times musty and yet also leans towards a tropical melon-like flavor. Very intriguing and different.

It smells like fresh hops. Ever made hop tea? This aroma reminds me of hop tea. Flavor is very light - not much malt, average bitterness, then fades to a wet grassy note. A bit more sweetness and peppery hops appear after a few sips. Body is solid - carbonation is well balanced and enhances the flavor - the bitterness and the grassiness just linger. Hop burps provide a very pleasant hop flavor as well! Sweet! Drinkability is OK. Sort of like a heavy-bodied, over hopped pils.","aaronh","Oct 21, 2009"

This is really the first wet-hopped ipa i've had that sort of shows me what the real difference is between a wet or dry-hopped ipa (not that i've had tons of wet hop beers, that is). So its quite delicious. A nice light mouth (not watery) with crisp carbonation adds and increases the drinkability. I could down a ton of this stuff, especially say at a party or such.

Perhaps the hops variety just isn't hitting the spot for me, but I found myself uninterested in going for a second bottle.

The lack of depth in color was shocking for an APA, but the head and lacing that comes from the hops saved the score. Has a highly hopped aroma of grapefruit, flowers, and pine needles. That is about it from the aroma. The flavor is likewise one dimensional. This beer has one focus and that is to show off the hops. But can't we have some malt flavor? Bitter and astringent. A little hard to drink. The body is too light for so much hops and bitterness. Carbonation is ok. Not the easiest drinking beer unless you are a hophead.

4.41,3.3,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5," The taste started out gentle, with a typical crystal malt presence and a hint of biscuit. Quickly, a lip-smacking alpha acid presence from the hops rode from the middle to throughout the finish, delivering a nice bitterness that seemed more in the ballpark of an IPA than a regular Pale Ale. A bit of fruity sweetness was detected as well, similar to the aroma. Mouthfeel was excellent, equal parts resinous and crisp, perfectly carbonated, and refreshing. A bit thick for a Pale, but that's okay with me. Overall, an impressive brew that lives up to the Founders repertoire, and one I hope to encounter down the road.","wagenvolks","Dec 17, 2008"
4.45,4.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color with some darker, more syrupy hues of amber. Two fingers + of foamy white head has excellent retention and yields some nice lacing stick. Smells fresh; citrus, pine resin, floral hops, caramel, grainy malt, and honey. Tastes of citrus fruits like grapefruit and pineapple, along with some lemon and even a touch of pear mixing with honey, grains, and saltine crackers in the backbone. Finishes with a spicy hop kick along with pine. Medium in body with fabulous carbonation for the style. A great balance of sweet and bitter with some saltiness thrown in to keep the tongue active. Creamy yet crisp with some good lip smacking action, and really fresh tasting. After having a bottle of last year's batch last year around this time I thought it was more of a British style IPA, but this year I'm really impressed with it. Very easy to drink, tastes excellent, and could definitely be sessioned. Great stuff.","HopDerek","Dec 17, 2008"

The flavor still allows a little bread crust malts through to provide balance. Otherwise, there's a nearly overwhelming pine and grapefruit taste. Frankly it could be more complex, like some of the great harvest ales out there, but this is still a tasty ale and finishes with a black pepper-tasting bitterness.

This is the closest experience I've had tasting a hoppy beer to the first time I sampled Two Hearted Ale in my basement bar 12 years ago with ZAP and Senior Shit. I'm just gonna take a guess that the hops for this bad boy are Centennial. It has that sourdough like malt and yeast contribution as the base. A little funky in that way.T he hops splash accents of orange marmalade, tangerine and grapefruit. The bitterness is not overboard, even though the bottle claims 70 IBUs. Carbonation is a bit overboard. Almost like some secondary reaction occurred that was not intended. But luckily it didn't impart any noticeable off flavors. This is pretty good. Solid.

The nose on this beer is hop oils all the way with varying scents of citrus and pine, and I also get more and more earthy undertones as the beer warmed. The flavor profile starts with a big rush of citrus flavor with bitter pine coming in quite quickly and just a touch of pale malt to balance out the hop flavors. The mouthfeel is slick and oily with medium carbonation with no alcohol present on the mouthfeel.

This Pale Ale poured a hazy golden color, with an average sized head...did not last very long, and eventually became a white lace...pretty pedestrian so far. Smelling this one right out of the bottle, I could tell I had something interesting. This one is busting at the seams with grapefruit and resiny hop smells. Pine, earth and more citrus also come to mind, but the hops are dominating. Tasting this beer is like turning the volume up on an amp to ten suddenly. The burst of hop flavor sort of rises on the palate, but tones down just as quickly. Again, the hops play the biggest part. The size of this beer is a notch or two above light, making it a good session brew. I should have gone for the four pack instead of the single with this beer. Rates amongst the top of the pack for fresh hop ales I have encountered. So much hop flavor, most IPA's and DIPA's pale in comparison. Cheers","jamie2dope","Oct 02, 2008"

This is a very refreshing style of beer, it would be wonderful on a hot summer day. With the well hidden 7% alchol it has enough backbone to stand up but is just sessionable enough.

I either attribute this to being bottle conditioned or due to the hop fragments from ""wet hopping"". Great APA aroma, the usual citrus notes. I noticed that there was hardly any head to it, so I was anticipating a thin mouth feel. First sip was good and reminiscent of most APA's, nothing outstanding, but still very drinkable.

3.76,-11.9,4,3,4,3,4.5,"Pours a hazy golden color. A nice thick head settles quickly to some sticky lacing around the edges on my pint glass. Smells of citrus orange and grapefruit hops. Taste of some light pine, juicy grapefruit and balanced with some sweet malt. Some green leaf appeared as it warmed. Not complex, kind of simple in flavor. But never the less, very delicious. Mouth feel is light and has a nice carbonated fizz to it. Overall drinkability is very good. I like this one. Has enough going on to enjoy many through out the night. Recommended!","DavidEddie","Nov 10, 2007"
3.95,-7.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"12 oz stubby. The beer is an oranged straw color with a 3 finger white head over top that is maintained by a massive stream of bubbles in the brew. The clarity on this one is moderate at best. The aroma is full of dank citrusy hop that are tempered by an orange fruityness and a spicy pepperyness. The caramel is towards the back in this one and the green quality is not apparent. The flavor is a little less hoppy than expected. The first flavor to hit is a vegetative citrus hop with an earthy bite to it. The orange and light caramel come through in the finish. This one just feels a little wanting to me, which is in stark contrast to the tap version I had last year. Moutfeel is moderate with a very light carbonation. Overall, this one is very drinkable with pretty good flavor. The mouthfeel is a little light on carbonation making it just a little less active than I was hoping. I know it is too early for this one to be on the down slope, but it just feels like it is not all it is meant to be. Don't get me wrong, it is good, but nothing like the tap version from last year or the previous harvest ale from another company I just sampled.","kmpitz2","Nov 09, 2007"
4.1,-4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D- This beer is a nice IPA. It is not a huge hop monster but it has nice flavor with a unique flavor to the hops. This is a nice session beer.","rhoadsrage","Nov 09, 2007"
4.59,7.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark hazy orangish yellow with a decent white head. The smell is amazing, the hop aroma jumps out. It is very rich and floral, very distinct as if the hops are still floating in the glass. The taste follows suit, very rich with the hops without the bitter bite seen in heavily hopped beers. This could be from this beer being wet hopped. It is also somewhat sweet, with a hoppy aftertaste that lingers. The mouthfeel is smooth, good balance in the characteristics. This beer is easy to drink, the hops aren't overpowering, but this is for the hopheads. This is one of my favorite pale ales. Enjoy.","wingman14","Nov 08, 2007"
4.4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Thanks to Dan at South Bend City Wide Liquors for letting me know this had come in (along with Backwoods Bastard...mmmm). Pours straw to orange colored with little suspended sediment throughout and a tiny bubble head that settles to a thin film. I love it. Smells citrusy and delicious. Almost smells like a ripening fruit. Flavor is great. I'm not really as much as a hophead as I used to be, primarily because of how one-dimensional some of the big hoppy beers can be when they're not made well, but beers like this remind me why I was a hophead...and why, when well used, hops are so important to a beer. Here, they are the main feature and donate a strong, mediumly-bittered grapefruit and grass flavor on top of a slightly creamy malt body. Its a great tasting beer...subtle in its attack, but extremely well-constructed.","aforbes10","Nov 07, 2007"
4.12,-3.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice creaminess and solid carbonation. A sturdy pale ale that brings a wealth of flavor while at the same time being quite drinkable and refreshing. This is a darn tasty wet hopped brew and I'm glad to see this in bottles. Get on it and try this one while you can. Another solid brew from Founders.","orbitalr0x","Nov 06, 2007"

3.2,-25.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"D- This is my first wet-hopped ale and it didn't quite meet my expectations. The hops are prominent and good, but I feel like the recipe might need some tweaking to improve the strength of the taste and the heat of the alcohol.","zdk9","Nov 04, 2007"
3.97,-7,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"A modestly light bitterness on the finish and mid palate and lacking the big citrus profile the nose suggested. More cereal grainy, toffee flavors come through than hop. A bit green with more stone fruit than citrus. Nectarine with zippy acicdity and carbonation. Finish is suprisingly lengthy. A beer that goes down very easy and has a real honesty too it that really makes this drinkable.","mcallister","Nov 04, 2007"

4.27,0,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Hazy, apricot-orange body with golden edges and a thick, creamy, glass-crawling beige head. Huge fresh hop nose. Pungent, resinous, oily, and herbal. Some citrus and pine in there too. Pineapple and caramel cookie malt aroma in the background. light toasted malt and herbal hop bitterness up front. Becomes more citrusy and soon explodes into juicy pineapple, powdered sugar malt sweetness, and, of course, resinous hop goodness. Good balance of numbing fresh hop bitterness and sugary malt in the long finish. Medium-bodied with a creamy feel. Very even and smooth carbonation. Delicious and I'm really glad to see this bottled!","alexgash","Nov 02, 2007"

4.11,-3.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,5,"Just released to the public for the first time yesterday. I had a couple of these among a few other beers at the HarvestFest party last night. I wasnt sure what style of beer it was supposed to be and was not able to talk much to anyone working there as the place was jam-packed. Fresh from the tap it had a nice copper color and good head retention. It tasted like a somewhat mild version of a pale ale. Brewed with the freshest hops (less than 24hrs off the vine), and you can taste it. A clean, fresh hoppy taste throughout. Maybe a little dry in the finish. I noticed a few citrus flavors, but nothing overpowering. It was somewhat difficult to really pull much of an aroma out of the glass, but I'll blame most of that on the atmosphere. The mouthfeel was maybe a little on the light side, but not watery by any means. Drinkability was great, I could have stayed and downed these all night if only my wallet was a little thicker. I'd like to try this one again soon. I wonder if they're bottling it or if its only available on tap?","jasonpeckins32","Nov 06, 2005"
4.33,1.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I had quite a few of these last night at Founder's Harvest Party where they brought out this new beer. I would say it lies somewhere between the Centenial and the Dry Hopped in terms of hoppiness. But the hops here take a really nice dimension and the malts seem to sit back. The malt base is honeyish but not really sweet at all but slightly toasty. It's just there to prevent the hops from being too much. The hop flavor is strong from the beginning and lasts throughout the finish. There is some bitterness but moreso hoppiness with flavors of grapefruit, orange rinds, and estery notes. I don't think this was dry hopped but I could be wrong. Goes down very easily, the body is on the lighter side, but to me is the ultimate session beer.","granger10","Oct 24, 2004"
