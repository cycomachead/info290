I'm not sure that adding grapefruit improves Sculpin which, in my opinion, was pretty damn good to start with.  The extra citrus boost does give this brew a different character, but if I had a choice I'd stick with just plain Sculpin.","dbl_delta","Today at 04:58 PM"

4.91,12.9,4.75,5,5,4.75,4.75,"Nice golden straw color pour into an ipa glass and just a very slight off white head that retreats to a layer of bubbles on top.  Lacing is spotty and sporadically travels down the glass edges.  Beautiful, grapefruit forward, sweetness arrives first with other citrus notes following.  Citrus flavors help through the the hop bitterness and the grapefruit really shines on the taste buds.  Decent bodied brew that is sweet and bitter but goes down so smoothly.  I find that I enjoyed this variation more than regular Sculpin, but I am a sucker for grapefruit forward ipas so I'm not surprised.","dpgoblejr","Today at 04:45 PM"

Without reinventing notes from my initial Sculpin review, I'll insert the opinion that I get more bite on the palate, from beginning to end, which can only be attributed to the addition of grapefruit. I also detect a fresh bread characteristic from the malt that adds to the overall balance of the beer.  If you enjoy the original, you should appreciate the variance on this one, too. By incorporating grapefruit, Ballast Point did nothing to diminish the properties that worked with its predecessor. Although the original tasted better the first time I had it, I would be more inclined now to reach for this version as a result of the inevitable palate shift. Like Christopher Cross rocking an Earl Campbell jersey in the late 70's, this IPA has me "Sailing".","weiserr","Mar 31, 2015"

The Julian date on the bottle reads 15057.  Pours very clear and orange with a bone white head of foam that held well and left handsome lacing. Nose is so authentic with grapefruit. it's heady with it,  then for perfume it has the scent of fresh orange.  A bit of twiggy and woody pine.    It smells so fresh and tantalizing.  Drinks like a an ocean breeze.  All that tantalizing citrus.  The orange is bright and light. The grapefruit is something wonderful.  It has all the flavor of a real grapefruit but none of the pucker or bitterness of it.   it's like they took all that flavor and sweetened it just enough.  The malt is elusive but a touch sweet with honey and so soft that it simply cascades over your tongue.  Mouthfeel approaches medium but is still wonderfully light with just enough weight from that honey malt to satisfy the palate in a very sensual way.      Right before the swallow is this breezy little spritz from carbonation that is so whimsical it made me laugh out loud.  It's as though you got a little sea mist at the back of your throat.  Perfect crisp finish that brings a little bit of the fruit rind a touch of bitterness to end this amazing beer.  It's  so good.","utopiajane","Mar 28, 2015"

Pours a translucent burnt orange with a loose, quarter-inch, off-white head.  Nose expresses bright citrus, candied fruit and a hint of zest.  Flavor profile begins with a light biscuity character, followed by an earthy/herbal dank hops presence and finishing with a hint of sweet citrus and some medicinal notes.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, but closer to the light side of the spectrum, with a lively carbonation and a kiss of acidity.  All and all, a great American IPA - well worth the wait.","Jwale73","Mar 28, 2015"

The aroma was big grapefruit (as it should be), with some flowery and piney notes.  Just a tinge of malty sweetness in the background. The taste was identical to the smell - huge grapefruit -just awesome!  I got a little sweetness in the finish as well. The body was pretty heavy for an IPA- very nice, with a nice crisp finish and good carbonation on the tongue.

Unblemished, bright liquid of a coppery orange color, the random bubbles are fat and avoid beading. In the nose the citrus has more focus than raw sweetness, pink grapefruit supported by solid tangerine notes, floral with saline and pretzel accents, pineapple, nectarine and peach fruit scents likewise more apt to jab than give you a hug. Full-bodied, more dense than heavy, might benefit from more powerful carbonation. Still manages good crispness and the herbaceousness, pine sap and general savoriness give it more spine. For an element which is ever-present, the grapefruit shows restraint in that it willingly shares the stage. The finish displays the underlying caramel and toffee sweetness, particularly when it warms some. Apricot, peach, pineapple fruit there, again not a fruit-driven experience. As one might expect, and want, the grapefruit outlasts all else. Good drinkability, doesn’t wear you down.","farrago","Mar 23, 2015"

This is a beer for people who love grapefruit juice and citrus, and is meant to fully focus on its grapefruity aspects.  Another great beer from Ballast Point!","HorseheadsHopHead","Mar 18, 2015"
4.49,3.2,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Grapefruit Sculpin pours a brilliant copper-gold, with a healthy head as white as snow.  Carbonation is moderately strong, and the head retention is excellent, displaying laced remnants of froth as the beer goes down. Absolutely incredible zesty citrus flavors come off the brew after a tentative breath. Quite literally smells like a thirst quenching grapefruit-orange breakfast juice, with some resinous hop elements hiding beneath the surface. A slight whiff of malty booze as well. Certainly seems like my kind of beverage! On to the tasting! Wow, I have to say, this really exceeds my high expectations based on the aroma. I can't believe how natural and fresh the juice aspect is, and how beautifully it is married to the resinous hop flavor. It's not unlike Hopslam actually, in its unique recipe and success in pulling it off. The finish has a nice bitterness to it, that is somewhat harsh and tart. Perfect. The feel of it is nice and light, almost like how you imagine juice to go down really, however, after a full gulp goes down, some warming makes you aware that it is indeed alcohol. Overall, this is sincerely a must try, not some novelty or anything of the sort. I need more!","Neorebel","Mar 18, 2015"

4.64,6.7,4.75,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Full disclosure: Avid fan of the traditional Sculpin, and was highly doubtful you could improve upon that beer. All things considered, though, this variation manages to be incredibly excellent while also not taking away from the original. The grapefruit finish is not overbearing and complements (instead of taking over) the flavor profile that's already there. Instead of being "Sculpin with some grapefruit," it's its own standalone beer. Too excellent and among the more interesting variations around.","JohnCassillo","Mar 13, 2015"

There's a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness with just the right amount of acidity.  There's nice sweetness upfront, followed by some citrus bitterness, some acidity, and follows off with a nice dry bitter finish.  Really good all around beer.  I wouldn't drink it every day , but it's really enjoyable and has good drinkablity.  It's an IPA to kind of savor in my opinion and the grapefruit helps with that.","AndyAvalanche","Mar 13, 2015"

I'm not a huge fan of adding flavors to beer but this was one of the few exceptions to that case as the grapefuit strongly enhanced the original version of this while complementing it perfectly. IPA's are a dime a dozen (as I always say) but hopheads and aficionados of quality brews would be wise to seek this out and pay the premium for this. This beer's certainly worth the praise and hype it's received.","JerzDevl2000","Mar 12, 2015"

The aroma is grapefruit with some citrus and tropical fruit hops. Mango, orange, lemon and lime. The taste is grapefruit, lemon and lime upfront followed by some grainy malts. Finishes with more grapefruit and the lemon and lime. Very citrusy, and not just from the grapefruit although it is the main flavor. Light, oily mouthfeel. Overall, really good variant to Sculpin. My only gripe is I seem to not just get grapefruit but more of the lemon/like.","PicoPapa","Mar 11, 2015"

Some light sweetness from the malt but the aromas are a bit one dimensional.  Taste is much the same with a big citrusy grapefruit profile.  Juicy grapefruit pulp, rind and pith with a touch of sweetness.  Prickly up front carbonation carries through a bitter and semi dry finish.  If I think of this as an IPA I appreciate it less as I feel the flavor comes from flavors not added by the hops.

3.67,-15.6,4.5,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,"Bottle. Grapefruit Sculpin is clear, brig orange with a fluffy, bountiful head. Plenty of lacing. A powerful grapefruit aroma. Not just grapefruity hops, more grapefruit juice. Almost too grapefruity for me to believe it's not artificially flavored. Also smells slightly bready. If I smelled this without knowing what it was, I would not think it was Sculpin. Flavor is also dominated by grapefruit juice. I think regular Sculpin is very tropical fruit hoppy. This is not much like it. Grapefruit juice with grapefruit hops solely. I can tell the hops are citru buying to the flavor because the finish is very bitter. The lightest malt profile. Bitter finish. Medium bodied. Crisp carbonation. Not much like the OG original Hopfish. I'm skeptical because I feel as though this brew is using artificial flavoring for such a concentrated grapefruit flavor. Regardless, it's pretty yummy.","VelvetExtract","Feb 21, 2015"

4.5,3.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a crystal clear, bright, vibrant, orange-gold coloring with a foamy, clingy, off-white head that slowly recedes into a surface coating, leaving a decent lacing on the glass. Aromas of tart and sweet grapefruit all over the nose, with a backbone of subtle cracker, and a bold ribbon of hops resin. Very inviting for a hophead. Flavors are very balanced, with a tart and sweet grapefruit character forward, with some more subtle citrus notes blending in the background, all on a roasted caramel and cracker backbone. The hops characteristics come through towards the end of the palate, with a sticky bitterness of pine pitch, moss, and cut grass. Very balanced, all on a smooth, lightly effervesced body. The aftertaste is much more hop heavy, with the resinous notes really taking the main stage, and the grapefruit stepping back into a supporting role. The finish is dry and sticky with the lingering hops dankness. This is a truly fantastic beer!","GarthDanielson","Feb 17, 2015"

I would love to see this consistently. I would definitely rotate this into my line-up. I would pair this with old-fashioned fruit cake. The sweetness of the cake would help off-set the bitterness of the beer and grapefruit and any fruit in the cake would pair with the flavors of the beer. Another great option would be the Indian dish chicken tikki masala. Would love a little more carbonation to get it an even higher rating. It gets a 96.6 from me.","DaverCS","Feb 12, 2015"

The taste had citric, sour, and tart grapefruit flavors up front and center, with a hop bitterness providing a second potent punch.  Some sweet hard candy sugar poking through here and there.  Medium thin and slippery on the palette, this beer was easy to drink.  Alcohol was completely hidden, and the beer was very quenching.

Halfway between copper & orange with a gigantic off-white fizzy head, and nice lacing to follow. Nose is dominated by the candied grapefruit, but there are other tropical fruits back there too.

Now if they were to double Dry Hop this with say...Citra, then I might be a bigger fan. They nailed what I believe they intended this beer to be, just too much grapefruit that cancels some of the hops that make Sculpin what it is. All in all this brew is Worthy!","Shroud0fdoom","Beers"

Will try not to be influenced by previous but I think that will be hard to do... Started with gf and it absolutely is (grapefruit) from start to finish. Aroma is nice and strong gf but more sweet and florally than bitter. Big foam that quickly settled to a good layer. Seems easier drinking than the reg Sculpin, milder hops that allows the gf flavor to come through. Obvious well made beer like a 2 hearted, super smooth bringing out the intended flavor(s). The aroma remains strong while drinking, as I was drinking from a tulip glass, and leads right into the mouth with the same flavor. The sweet gf fades and you are left with a (good) bitter taste, more gf than hops. I liked that the gf was imparted well but it def overwhelms any hop flavor. You need to have an open mind in this one to enjoy. I would drink again but prob not buy more than one at a time.","hotpauko","Jan 18, 2015"

After having 4 of these, I don't think it was as good as I initially thought it was.  The grapefruit kills all the nice stuff that Sculpin is.  A well balanced Sculpin now tastes like a grapefruit radler.  While still well done, I've revamped my rating to 4-ish from 4.5.","alienlifeforcecube","Jan 13, 2015"

Some leafy, floral hop notes come through as it warms.  Flavor has more depth - plenty of grapefruit for sure, but the hops bring some deeper tropical fruit, lemon, grass, and cracker-like grain.  The grapefruit remain amazingly fresh and bright, bringing a nice zesty, oily aspect that seems to blend well with the hops.  That being said, it is VERY grapefruity, going well beyond the limits of what hops can normally contribute.  Medium bodied, bitter, and pleasantly dry.  A quality IPA that really harnesses the fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice quality, but still lets some of the base beer shine through (if only slightly).","wedge","Jan 09, 2015"

Served in a DFH IPA glass, the beer pours a mostly clear golden/orange color with about an inch and a half white head.  Head retention and lacing are both pretty good.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like pink grapefruit, citrusy hops, and a bit of bready malt.  It tastes like citrusy hops, pink grapefruit, citrus peel, tropical fruit and bready malt.  There's also a lingering bitter finish.  Ballast Point was right when they named this beer, because it's all about the grapefruit!  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and has a good amount of carbonation.  It's also smooth and easy to drink.  I think this is a pretty good brew, and if you like grapefruit then you'll really like this one!","bluejacket74","Jan 01, 2015"

I trust them. Deep copper hue, with 3 fingers of white head with pretty big bubbles. Mucho lacing. There was literally a 3 foot radius aroma of grapefruit eminating from my glass throughout the consumption of this beauty. Also some aromas of citrus peel, some dank notes, and overall very clean! Big huge, juicy grapfefruit on the front of the palate. Clean and bitter bite on the end of the palate. Some funky (mosiac?) in the middle. Very hop forward, though there was enough of a malt foundation to carry it. Refreshing and clean, no major lingering aftertastes/etc. but it really kept the palate fresh. This was delicious and juicy. Love Sculpin, Grapefruit might be a +1... can't wait to find Habenero! Ballast Point. Find this!","Mikus","0"

Big hop character is present with tropical fruit, mango, peach, but really this is all about the grapefruit, pithy and zesty. The palate opens with a big grapefruit juice character, bright, refreshing and breakfast like. Moderately sweet, which hampers drinkability and takes away from the awesome hop profile, the mod palat is super juicy. Light in body and moderately carbonated, this beer has a long and bitter finish with a blend of grapefruit juice, honey and pine. This beer manages to be everything I hoped out would be but still disappoint. Recommended.","DefenCorps","Dec 26, 2014"

It seems too light bodied and subtle for me in comparison to like-style beers like Stone and Lagunitas.  So, perhaps the citrus bite of grapefruit will enhance it? It did, but not enough. Still too light bodied for my personal preference. I really enjoy so many of Ballast Point's offerings that this baffles me. Chalk it up to individual palate issues...","MisterGone","Nov 16, 2014"

Grapefruit is a common adjective of hoppy brew, but it's really just how your palate interprets and parses the spectrum of flavors in an hop-forward ale. Adding grapefruit proves there is some molecular similarity in how hopped ale and bitter citrus affect your palate. Bitter rind against tangy sweetness amplify the bitter-sweet duality inherent in beer...after reviewing IPA's for so long it's interesting how many times the first flavor that came to mind was grapefruit.","rand","Nov 01, 2014"

I tried Habanero Sculpin and the habanero heat overwhelmed the hop flavors and aromas of Sculpin but the grapefruit enhances Sculpin really well. While Sculpin is world class on its own grapefruit just enhances Sculpin. Definitely a must try for Sculpin lovers.","Catracho5","Oct 31, 2014"

4.75,9.2,,,,,,"Poured a nice, slighty hazy amber body with a thin cap of white foam. Exactly what I expect from an IPA, nothing amazing, but still quite nice. Scents of tropical fruit especially pineapple and mango, pine resin, grapefruit peel and flesh, light pine resin and indeterminate citrus. Faint malt is also present. Overall impression of aroma is of a fairy grapefruit forward aroma, fitting the addition of grapefruit, with the same pine, tropical fruit and citrus that we have come expect from Sculpin. A wonderful aroma. True to form and what I expect from Sculpin. Flavor begins with a nice flavor of grapefruit zest and flesh, far more fresh and fruity than the normal hop-derived grapefruit. A hint of pine resin complements the grapefruit. The middle continues this fresh, grapefruit rich flavor, along with a bit of indeterminate, likely orange zest, citrus peel and moderate pine resin. Finish is rich in grapefruit flesh, peel, pith and medium amounts of pine resin. A light malt sweetness balances the hops and grapefruit throughout. Aftertaste is grapefruit flesh, rind and a moderate level of pine resin. Overall impression of flavor is of a wonderfully refreshing IPA that takes a strong presence towards grapefruit due to the addition of grapefruit. It is wonderfully balanced and works well with the base flavors, particularly the pine resin, but also the malt. The fresh, bitter, fruity notes of the grapefruit peel are on full display and make the beer feel fresh and crisp. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with medium carbonation and a crisp, drying, resinous feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice, resinous IPA, the typical Sculpin, though notes of raw grapefruit also push through. Very nice. Overall this is a wonderful IPA. It takes the base Sculpin and adds a fantastic level of grapefruit to the base and balances it wonderfully in aroma and flavor. The resinous mouthfeel helps. Truly an excellent IPA that is full of fresh citrus and pine flavor. Highly recommended.","Auraan","Oct 15, 2014"

The hops are backed by a slight malt adding gentle sweetness with semi-toasted taste of malt and nicely bitter grapefruit flavor into the finish. This is a great IPA and the grapefruit is a natural flavor addition but actually enhances the original Sculpin, certainly does not detract from one of the best American IPA's","Slatetank","Oct 13, 2014"

It was bitter (in a good way), the feel was good but to me had way too much grapefruit character going on which just lost me. I love grapefruit as well but I guess I thought I was gonna get an overload of grapefruit hops type of taste as apposed to an actual Grapefruit type of taste.

The aroma is dominated by a sweet candy citrus with honey and light floral hop aromas. The sweetness in the nose, thankfully, is the only thing that doesn't come through in the flavor. Grapefruit and orange citrus take center stage over a clean and smooth malt profile nicely balanced by a floral and citrus hop profile. While the candied grapefruit up front tastes a little fake, the perfectly bitter pith finish keeps me coming back. Crushable and refreshingly delicious, Grapefruit Sculpin is a great take on an already great IPA.","brianmandell","Beers"

Sculpin is a very good IPA, but the addition of the grapefruit really makes this one explode out of the glass, especially when it comes to the taste. The only negative in my mind is that I feel like I've had beers before that accomplish this kind of sensation without the use of actual grapefruit, so in a weird way, the grapefruit feels like a crutch. Nonetheless, it's a great beer and one that I'll probably try to get more of next season.","LambicPentameter","Aug 12, 2014"

Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and grapefruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and grapefruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a very nice citrus presence that make this one easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 09, 2013"

4.84,11.3,4.75,5,4.75,4.5,5," Sculpin is my favorite beer hands down and when I was visiting Diego me and my friend who lives around the corner decided to go get it started. I saw the grapefruit Sculpin on the menu and went for it. Was thinking it would be meh but it was actually amazing. It tasted exactly like Sculpin but with a bright grapefruit juice taste on the front end. Halfway throught the distinctive Sculpin flavor washed over my palate. If this was available in stores I would be running to get it. Would be the best summer beer ever. If you see this at the brewery get it immediately.","totallyrelaxed","Jan 19, 2013"
