"I spend a couple of months in Florida during the winter and the ABC folks down there do have a great selection.  I usually just pick up a few brands I haven't tried but this time I asked about what was popular down in Florida.  The guy told me this Jai Alai so I got a six pack.   As you can tell by the ratings - many rate it high.  Can't do it.  I found it oddly sweet and lacking a good hoppy flavor.  Rather flat in its carbonation as well.  So, in all fairness, let me say I like a strong IPA with a real hoppy bite.  I bought it in a can and usually don't do this.  I hope the difference isn't  that great.  Didn't finish the six pack.  But again, with a rating of 95+ I must be the oddball.  Good Luck."

"A phenomnal ipa. Loads of tropical fruit in the nose and on the palate. A bit boozy for everyday sessioning but overall a great ipa. Nice full body and mouthfeel with a gorgeous Amber color and foamy head."

"Too much foam. Smell is pretty lacking but not the worst smelling beer. Taste is great and smooth. It's kind of like wolf among weeds but I like wolf among weeds better because wolf is refreshing and crisp"
""
""
"In a 12oz can. Much better than the oak-aged Jai Alai"
""
"Super hop! Excellent End to any day"
"I'm a huge IPA fan. I live in Tampa about 20 minutes from the brewery. It is always a treat to visit the tasting room. I enjoy and home brew double IPA's and this is a nice full bodied brew. At 70 IBU's it is up there near the (undefined) double IPA level. Really enjoyable."

"This beer smells of grapefruit and hops, great on a hot day and finishes smooth.  For 7.5 it feels like a 9%'r"

"Shocked at how underrated this IPA is on this site. Simple put, the best, most balanced, drinkable IPA on the planet. Quite possibly the perfect IPA."
"Near perfect IPA.  Not over the top with hoppy bitterness.  Great citrus notes.  Nice long finish.  Very sessionable.  Cheers!"
""
""
"Appearance: Copper with a slight haze under a persistent 3‚Äù off-white foam cap that produces thick clumps of lace. The beer turns brilliant as it warms.  Smell: A light earthiness, pitted fruits, light biscuit, some tropical elements. Taste: The attack begins with creamy malt with a mild sweetness and then grapefruit rind bitterness followed by apricot and citrus. It dries out on the finish with a repeat of the citrus rind bitter accent.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, clean, medium body and carbonation."

"Refreshing flavor. Beautiful color. Great in the morning."
"Love this IPA! Wonderful aroma of grapefruit and awesome citrus taste. It's Florida in a glass!"
""
""
""
""
"This has been my default beer of choice for awhile when I can't make a decision... I might be a little bit prejudiced, being from FL though.. but it IS delicious.. just sayin..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of flavor, good depth. I'm good for 2-3."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very nice copper/orange color with a 2 finger head. The citrus hops are very prominent and give it a wonderful aroma. Taste is very smooth, the bitterness fades quickly and has a nice balance. Overall a solid IPA."
""
""
""
"Overall: I wish this beer was readily available. Easily my favorite go-to IPA. Not the greatest n the world, but way better than even the most common above average IPAs (90 minute, sculpin, etc.). If your in the same situation, Victory's Dirtwolf is a nice replacement thats pretty easy to find around the more northern southeast united states. Highly recommended."

"This is my favorite beer."
"O: Fantastic, wonderful refreshing tropical fruity hops with crisp bitterness. A boon to the Florida craft scene."
""
"An outstanding beer and an outstanding IPA. Significant amount of carmel malt, and the hop flavor seems a little flat for a 9 day old can. Comes across a little more balanced than some others in case you are looking for a hop bomb. Reminds me a lot of Two Hearted. Maybe a tad overrated, but I would gladly drink this any time."
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious, amazingly vibrant, complexity on every sip and it just feels like have a full tropical buffet on a beach somewhere, with strong florals as well. This beer takes you there and its amazing, tough to say where it stacks on the top IPA list, it no doubt deserves consideration, I suppose a lot will be personal preference. For me this was especially zesty and tropical, pronounced grapefruit and melon notes, and especially bright. All together a showstopper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really piney bitter taste at first but leaves a slightly sweet after taste."
""
""
"Very tropical. Tasty but nothing too amazing."
""
""
""

"Now that I am leaving Florida I will have to see where in CT I can get some"
""
""
""
"This beer smells and tastes so fresh, was canned just 10 days prior to drinking this. The only word screaming out in description is tropical. The citrus is so fresh and juicy, like a good pineapple or a peach. The taste lingers with no bad after taste, making it so drinkable. I'd recommend this beer for any season and any occasion."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a spiegelau ipa glass.  Enjoyed with some super spicy indian food and they complimented each other perfectly.  This beer is incredibly balanced, just bursting with tropical fruits, peaches, apricots, and tangerines.  So easy drinking.  The taste lingers but never bitter or biting.  I love this beer and could drink it all day.  It's juicy but balanced and feels lighter than the abv would suggest."

"Pours Cooper, with a fluffy, lacy head. Smells sweet, roasted, citrus hops and citrus fruit. Tastes of citrus fruits, citrus hops and finishes with a caramel malt. Feels creamy and lasting."
""
""
"Great session beer. Fruity but not overpowering. Well balanced with a clean finish. It isn't a west coast hop forward beer, but it hits the mark strong."

"O- Phenomenal. Picked up a six while traveling in The South. Wish I had picked up a case."

"Can poured into tapered pint glass with a 3in head.  Beautiful Amber orange color, with lots of carbonation, and the head held well.  Smells citrusy sweet and light.  Malty caramel flavors up front with a nice citrusy hoppy note on the back end.  Very drinkable, very pleasant IPA.  Would love to drink these regulars, great go-to beer but probably not the hoppiest IPA if you're looking for that over the top bitter bite."
"Nice hoppy flavor with a slightly fruity undertone."
""
""
""
"As solid as it gets. I can drink this beer any time of day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Can into shaker pint. Pours clear copper-orange with a finger and a half of white head that leaves great lacing. Aroma is full-on citrus hops with tangerine and apricot notes, and some caramel malt. Taste is briefly sweet then a moderate to strong citrus rind bitterness takes over. Medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish."

"This is one of my favorite beers and favorite IPA so far.  I've had it on tap, from the bottle, and from the can; delicious every time.  Malt and hop characteristics are well balanced and a hearty 7.5% ABV compliments this pairing.  Smells of tropical citrusy hops and has a clean finish, not too hoppy.  Overall taste is crisp and has notes of tropical fruits.  Overall a well balanced and fantastically executed IPA.  While both are world class IPAs I prefer it over Heady Topper, just sayin."
"I was sadly underwhelmed by this brew.  I do not think it holds up to some of the world class quality IPAs. Very heavy on the malt and the hops did not really pop to me."
""
""
""
""
"O- very nice beer but spoiled being a new Englander.  Certainly would buy again in Florida but wouldn't trade for it."
"Poured in Belgium style pub glass. Color is medium amber pour with quarter inch acing head. Nose has hints of tropical fruit, citrus zest, and citrus hops.  Taste comes remarkably close to the nose as citrus hops are present with hints of caramel  and pineapple.  Not a terribly bitter after taste and is fairly sweet.  A very nice IPA from an outstanding brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good. Not great. Deck was probably stacked against this one as I recently had a few Headys - a tough standard to live up to. Would not turn one down though."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"Very bitter finish, off putting aftertaste"
""
""
""
""
"How they got 7.5 abv to taste so smooth I will never know? I live on the beach in south Florida and drink beer all day everyday, this is my new favorite beach beer. You only need a few and your where you wanna be! I love beer and Really think Jai Alai is the best beer I ever had! Hands down!"
""
""
""
""
"For the greatest selling craft beer in Florida this is just ok. It is a very refreshing pale ale though."

"Although I see many good reviews, i am expanding my taste buds. Not quite use to the extra hoppy taste. Moving forward, looking at the description it is hard to note the citrus tones. I feel like I smell and taste the hops from start to finish. I didn't give it a bad review because it isn't a bad beer. In fact it may take me some time to get use to IPA style beers. So I give it a middle.of the road rating. Sorry if this offends anyone."
""
"It‚Äôs got a caramel like sweetness with a really nice green front to it but even that strong green front has a citrus taste with it. It finishes with citrus and almost a tropical mango on the backside. Great balance of piney greenness and citrus flavors. Easy on the tongue with a light feel."
"Tons of tropical juice flavor and sweetness start off with a minimal hop bite at the end. Pours a clear light copper body with a bright white head, with very fine and sticky lacing. At 7.5% this is very smooth and the alcohol is well hidden behind the flavors. Perfect beach beer. At only 3 weeks old Im excited to have gotten some."
""

"Golden brown piss color. Medium hop body. Extremely floral/fruity hop taste. Tropical like. Dragonfruit. Starfruit. Guava. Fruity malt sweetness with a crisp fling before a smooth rolling finish."

"Really surprised me on this one. A very delicious beer."

"Had this on tap on vacation recently.  Have had it in the can as well on vacation over the new year.  Wow was it good on tap, better than the can for sure.  Was impressed at how  the hopps was real apparent and fresh.  I'm used to a stronger hopp presence and was happy that the fresh Jai Alai had it more than i recalled from the can.  Very sweet ad fruity finish.  Wished I had a keg in the cellar.  Keep up the good brews."
""
""
"All in all a great beer.  In regards to a 6 pack right up there as a top 10 IPA in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A new favorite beer in the fridge."
""
"Great IPA. Pours a nice Amber color with a great three finger head. Very present citrus and hoppy aroma but not overwhelming. Has a nice bitter taste but leaves a dry finish, begs you to have another drink. Overall great beer."
""
""
""
"May be the best beer I've had to date. Really hits a great after flavor of citrus/grapefruit . I just enjoy it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"I was able to pick up some 2 week old Jai Alai while I was passing through Florida. This beer was awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bought a case of 12 oz. cans in the summer of 2014 in Allentown, Pa. Illegible canning date. Very good but seemed to have a ""chemical like"" aftertaste that I didn't like. Will try again at next opportunity to rate again."
""
""
""
"Just a great IPA. Cigar City comes through again with another great beer. Thin head, full bodied and tropical flavor gives the bitter hops a unique twist throughout the tounge."

"Woody, smokey, hoppy!  Drink it daily when I'm in Key West, Florida."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is chewy and bright with a pleasant courseness and an everpresent citric  hop presence.  Touch of ethanol eminates from the glass.  Offers a rather complex malt structure/hop mystery.  Bit woody in nature.  Hop forward yet skillfullly balanced.  Actually quite remarkeable and easy on the palate.  Not a San Diego IPA by any means but pretty damn solid,."
""
""
"I hate IPA's and I'm giving this an extremely high rating...'nuff said."
""
""
""
"Like many have said this is a solid IPA.  Very tasty, I can almost feel like I'm in Florida drinking it.  I would replace my OJ in the morning with this beer every day.  Very solid- I hope to try more from Cigar City"
"O- Nice little Florida gem! I'm glad I got over my can hatred to try this! One of my favorites, now!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"No complaints.  I'll have this beer again.  I think it's great for just a solid easy to drink IPA, but still has a unique, balanced, and enjoyable taste to it."

"Citrus flavors in beginning but subtle and excellent finish.  This is one of my top 3 east coast IPA's"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Thus far this is the best IPA I have ever had. No doubt. It is rated highly and for good reason. I have a few more CCB beer waiting for me, but those are a completely different style, but if this is indicative of what this brewery can do, I am happy to trade again for just about anything! This is truly an outstanding IPA!"

"wow. one sip in.... nice balance.  the other guy said it perfectly....""caramel malts, citrus and spicy hops..."" why not a 5 in taste? this is definitely one of the best I have had.... maybe a little 'dense' or 'syrup-y' but I think I could drink these all day...."

"Pouring a yellow-orange in color, Jai Alai gives off a subtle creaminess to the background of it's nose.  The hops are citrusy but smooth and give none of the aggressive bitterness there's a mild malt note in the note as well as though vanilla or caramel.  The nose is amazingly balanced and has a touch of tropical fruit as well.  On the palate the carbonation is smooth, keeping the texture remarkably creamy. Flavors of citrus, pine, orange and a hint of honey drive the profile. There also a subtle spiciness. The balance of the entire experience is what makes this IPA special.  There are elements of malt that keep the hops from overtaking the beer, even on the finish, which has only a small amount of bitterness, but lots of flavor."

"Got this in a can only 14 days old.  Pours a hazy yellow orange color with a very persistent foamy white head. The smell is dominated by very fruity hops as is the taste. Initially the citrus (particularly grapefruit) flavors dominate but there is a quick transition to a rich malt flavor.  The mouthfeel is smooth and rich and the finish begs for the next sip.  This is my new go to IPA."

"12 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 11/4/2014. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, peach, mango, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, peach, mango, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate amount of pine/citrus peel bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of big juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome IPA. All around great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; and very smooth and fairly crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: very well done IPA it's fruity finishes clean not too bitter it's very good¬†"

"Wow. Best IPA I've had in a while,  well crafted, and a great take on the style. Glad to finally get to try it on a trip to the Keys. Spent two weeks getting to know this gem. Pours a dark honey with a half inch creamy head, and great lacing. A big nose of tropical fruit and hops. Taste is plenty of fruit, mango, pineapple, and tangerine, with a great hop presence and a nice bitter finish. A touch of caramel malt balance it out nicely. Not boozy, but full bodied. A truly great IPA that I will look forward to on my next trip to Florida. Room for some in my suitcase home for sure."

"O - Jai Alai is a solid IPA.  On the sweet and fruity side for an IPA, but the hops still pack a decent punch.  A very good beer."

"Having this side by side with a zombie dust. Overall I think I prefer the jai alai because it is just so balanced and smooth. Zombie is all about the pow hops hit. Jai alai is classier and smooth"

""
"Poured a four finger head with a gorgeous amber body from a can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. A tropical nose, if that makes sense. Presents with a  citrusy hop blast, with a pervasive and fruity sweetness; there are pine notes, but they are almost too subtle to mention. A refreshing and light mouthfeel, resulting in a session-beer-like drinkability. This is a unique IPA, and one at least in the top ten. I'll fight anyone who says otherwise."

"O: This should be on everyone's short list of IPAs to try before they die. It really doesn't get much better than this."
"With an intense citrusy hop profile and a hefty caramel malt base, this IPA reminds me of a beer that people would have flipped out over in the early 2000s. Even today, it is pretty solid. With its balanced flavor profile and lighter mouthfeel, I could definitely imagine myself drinking this all day long on a hot summer day."

"Deep orange to copper hue with a slightly off white khaki tinged head.  Head sticks around for a few sips then dissipates leaving a ring and big chunky lacing.  Nose has some major hop action.  Earthy, tobacco, grapefruit and a touch of tropical fruits.  Taste has brings big hop flavored to the front.  Grapefruit, tobacco, mango and papaya.  Some caramel and biscuity notes are there but they don't get near balancing the resinous hops.  Bitter on the finish and a nice grapefruit linger.  Medium body and sticky feel on the palate.  Somehow, this finds a way to crud pup and finish slightly dry.  Overall a fantastic IPA with a unique flavor all it's own."

"Pretty tasty. You get the citrus tropical fruit nose that you get on most IPAs these days but it's a little more assertive in the bitterness category. I like that! Plus I'm a fan of beers in a can. A really solid backyard, lawnmower, bbq beer."

"Beer had a great copper hue. Immediately you were hit with a nice hoppy smell which is to be expected from an IPA. Taste was not as hoppy as expected but still very good. Nice after taste with not too much bitterness. Overall this is a wonderful beer and folks who do not like IPA's will enjoy the beer!"

"Thanks to Paul for picking this up for me in Tampa! Slightly hazy amber-orange pour with a two finger foamy off-white head with good retention and great lacing. Big fruity, tropical nose with lots of resiny hops along with hints of pine, caramel, tangerine and mango. The taste follows suit with mango, pine, and resiny hops up front along with hints of sweet caramel, peach marmalade, and subtle grapefruit. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation and balance and a nice slightly syrupy, subtly bitter finish. Overall, this is one bold and flavorful IPA with huge drinkability."

"Straight from the can, a delicious beach beer. When poured into a glass and paired with blackened grouper, it's devine. The head is frothy and has staying power. Not to be ignored, the scent is reminiscent of a floral, bright IPA, but with subtle notes of something sweet and alluring... I've read ""caramel", but prefer to think it is the aroma of something brewed especially for fairies at play in the land of dreams and sweets and candy."

"I know the true characteristic of a beer is realized after it has been decanted but Jai Alai is great straight out of the can. Refreshing and well balanced hop profile with a clean crisp finish. Does not linger on the tongue and only leaves you wanting to go back for another sip. Even when poured the beer exhibits a beautiful color and wonderful citrus (orange peel) aroma. A great tight head that lingers on the edge of the class tells me that someone has taken their time to get it right."

"I would definitely credit this beer for making me appreciate IPAs. I was lucky enough to live so close to the Cigar City brewery, going to USF's Tampa campus, so I was able to try Jai Alai right from Cigar City's tap. This beer has a very full flavor, with the bitterness from the hops blending smoothly with notes of citrus and tropical fruits. I highly recommend this beer to those who love IPAs as well as those who are skeptical of the style."

"This beer quickly became a favorite of mine when I started spending time Southern Florida. A perfect warm summer day beer. But honestly, when isn't it a warm summer day in southern Florida.

"From a can which was 2 months old so have to do this review with a grain of salt, so to speak. Beautiful copper color with huge head. I really looked forward to the tropical fruit aroma and of course citrusy smell / taste go a long way with me in an IPA anyway. maybe it was because this can was 2 months old but it was very hard for me to pick up any significant citrus and tropical fruit notes from start to end. Just sort of there is all. have to have when super fresh to do a proper comparison but I would say just pay attention to the canning / bottling dates when pursuing just like any other IPA."
""
"Taste: Hoppy at the front of the tongue, but surprisingly smooth and easy to drink unlike some aggressive IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is beautiful hop citrus punch up front with sweet and bitter notes delicately and only slightly balanced by sweet caramel malt that finishes with a thick pine resin syrupy feel. This one has an excellent play between resinous pine and tropical citrus without either one dominating. It just works."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While the hops are a mouthful, and lacy in both look and feel, the malts are where Jai Alai shines. This is a balanced IPA: piny and citrus in hop character and caramel and light malt to finish. If I were stranded on an island (with a refrigerator), and had to choose between Hop Nosh, One Claw, and Jai Alai, I would pick this one. Not only does the name invoke a sense of lazy (or survival-induced intense) afternoons, but the beer backs it up. Jai Alai!"

"O: One fantastic IPA. I remember, recently, when I started hearing about this beer. I wanted to try this beer for awhile and I walk in one of my local stores and they had it on the shelf. I almost planned a trip down to visit my uncle near Tampa to go to the brewery before it arrived here. I will still be planning that trip. CCB rules."
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A very nice IPA that is very easy to drink and very flavorful. I wish the vegetal flavors didn't appear but as the beer warmed up, they became less of a factor. It's easy to see why this is the gold standard of the southeast, fine beer."
""
"TOTAL - 41/50"

"Cigar City's Jai Alai is the definition of an East Coast IPA. It's definitely malty, so much so that you can smell the caramel coming through along with the tropical fruits of cascade and simcoe hops. There is also is a certain amount of bread-y or toastyness to the malt backbone. Overall good IPA. It used to be my favorite until I drank Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA. I've realized that I'm more of a west coast drinker than east coast over the past couple of months. Follow me on Twitter: miamibrewer305"
"Tried this over nachos and World Cup soccer at On the Rox in Richmond's Shockoe Bottom neighborhood. This beer is definitely a new addition to my favorites list. Pours a hazy golden color with a huge floral, citrus and honeysuckle nose. The taste had citric hops, sweet malt, and a bitter finish. This is a sensory experience in the best of ways."
""
""
""

"O - Given its availability, it's an easy choice, especially in the spring and summer. Good for the lake or beach."

"Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of an American IPA, it was just dominated by fruity hops and I didn't mind it one bit, sure it wasn't that balanced, but the hop profile was so nice that I didn't really think about it too much. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, fairly refreshing, slightly sticky, not too filling and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, If I had a bunch of these I would have no problem taking out a six pack throughout the day, especially on a warm summer day. What I liked the most about this beer was the hop profile, it was great and it was really juicy and fruity. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't a single thing about this beer that I disliked or would change, it's great just the way it is. I would recommend this to just about everyone, I think it lives up to being called a must try beer. I would for sure buy some if I ever saw it and if I knew it was fresh and I hope Cigar City makes it to Michigan one of theses days. All in all I was impressed with this beer and I was happy that It lived up to the hype, I now see why this beer is sought after, it's just a great beer with good drinkability, it's got a lot of appeal to it. So far this is up there as one of the best American IPA's I've had. This beer made for a great first impression for Cigar City and I would love to try more of their beers. Great job guys, this is one world class IPA, keep up the great work."

"O. One of the better IPAs available. It has a fairly sweet and robust body and is more malt-forward than most, but the tropical flavors and the very green, grassy bitterness provide a nice counterpunch. In the end, everything comes together very nicely, leaving you with a beer that is better than the sum of its parts. There are a lot of IPAs out there, but few as unique as Cigar City Brewing's Jai Alai. Recommended. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Overall: I had this on vacation in Florida this past winter and loved this. Not sure why this is coming off so malty to me this time around. I'll keep drinking this week and see if my perception changes."
""
""
""
""
"I had a couple bottles of this back in 2011 and never actually posted a review because I wasn't particularly impressed by the beer. I thought I might have had a couple of bad bottles or something. Now, hundreds of beers later, I can say with confidence that Jai Alai is not really what I'm looking for in an IPA. It smells great, but it's too sweet and too sticky. All of the wood-aged variants are a notable improvement."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What sets this beer apart from other IPAs is its great balance. A lot of IPAs are aggressively hoppy, which is fine, but what keeps me coming back to a beer is nuance. The biggest defining factor was how the orange-citrus touch to it gave the hops a nice uplifting buzz. It balanced out the piney hops and left a warm lingering aftertaste. This makes Jai Alai the perfect summer drink for an IPA fan. I could imagine making multiple return trips to a cooler to crack one of these open! Great beer."
""
""
"Over All - One of the more balanced IPAs, Unique complex taste kept me wanting more. Well crafted brew. It will definitely be in my regular rotation. Top notch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth, balanced IPA, rugged and resiny, I was taken aback at first since I translated Florida IPAs to mean that they are all tropical. Complexity is to be admired as well. Thanks for the opportunity Brandon."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a good ipa. Good hop character and some nice malt back bone."

"A solid but not earth-shaking IPA. It's a testament to the east coast style and that's appreciated. Perhaps super fresh it's something to envy, but 3-4 weeks makes it nicelt drinkable if a bit lackluster."

"So here goes my first review ... This is a fantastic IPA , at only 7% abv it packs a lot of flavor. Its a great anytime IPA and has become really popular in South Florida and is almost always available. Nice opaque orange color , great mouthfeel, and tons of citrus hoppy flavor. Is great out of the can but I prefer in a glass to really appreciate the color and aroma of this IPA. Has a great balance of bitterness and sweetness. I usually drink IPA's in the 9-10% abv range but this IPA stands up right next to them."
""
""

""
"Overall: Yeah this stuff is phenomenal. If you are a fan of huge citrus and tropical fruits with a minimal yet present malt body then this is an IPA for you. Wish I didn't have to trade for this stuff."

"Classic Southeast US IPA. This is the first beer I ever had from CCB in NYC a few years back and I hope to keep having as many as possible. CCB has proven to me they are a true powerhouse in the US craft scene. They produce great one-offs (LiL, DB Huna, Brandy Huna) but can fall back on a classic like this, now in cans!"

"Burnished copper in the glass that pretty. Smell is sweet and tropical -- almost like you can feel the humidity. Lots of guava, mango and pineapple, but less on the citrus front. This is a bit less forward hop forward than a lot of IPAs. The hops are buoyed by a thick syrupy malt that sticks to the tongue. Overall, a very nice beer that is dangerously sessionable."

"Canned 9/22/14 so this is super fresh. Thanks to One1Asterisk for the trade! Smell is just a huge amount of orange juice. Maybe some tropical  fruit and a touch of pine. Taste follows the smell. Just loads of orange juice. A really great malt backbone too. I gotta say this is one of those beers you gotta drink fresh or else there's no point. Last time I got a lot of malt sweetness, but this is almost perfect in taste. Not a hint of alcohol either."

My family went through about 6-6packs while we were vacationing on Sanibel. This just tastes tropical. Doesn't smack you in the face like a dirtwolf but is dangerously sessionable. My wife absolutely loves this beer, and she is not an ipa fan. If you can get your hands on some fresh Jai Alai, do it!"

"Nice to get a fresh can of this (canned in March), the only other bottle i had was clearly infected, this was not. Dark orange color, good foamy head, looks fine. Aroma is sort of hoppy, tropical fruit mostly but its not as robust as I would like. Flavor is very hop heavy,tropical fruits buta strong alcohol component that is quite unpleasant. Very strong astringency. Not sure why Cigar City is so popular I wouldn't drink this again and I plan on giving away my remaining can. I also think their aesthetics and branding are sort of tacky."

"O: Hitting all the characteristics of an amazingly drinkable IPA that commands interest and is refreshing enough to satisfy the taste buds at a very high level. So dreamy this beer is I am glad to have finally experienced this one! Hop lovers must try this!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a great deep amber/copper color with plenty of translucent quality. Smell is super citrus, sweet citrus - clementine and tangelo. Even a hit of mango in there. Taste is just as good, it is a unique IPA citrus to jai alai and really sets this beer apart. Great IPA."
"Great beer. Fits my palate nicely, as the bitterness is restrained. That eggy character is odd, but it works. Love the soft tropical fruits."
""
""
""
""
"There's no information on the back about the beer, beyond why they called it Jai Alai or what food pairings you should try. Fine. Who needs gobbledygook? This is a class act IPA, all the way. Belongs up there with the best of the them. Sure wish I had another."

"O - really enjoy this beer. Wish it wasn't so expensive up here"
"O: Very different than any of the IPAs I‚Äôve had in the past. It honestly reminds me of a tripel and therefore lacks the robust tropical fruitiness that I find crisp and refreshing. While the flavors I encountered were not displeasing, they weren‚Äôt exactly what I‚Äôm looking for when I scoop an AIPA. Definitely a unique beer, an interesting spin on the style"
""
"Fantastic brew that I'm happy a friend of mine was willing to part with, seeing as there are plenty of miles between us and the nearest state that sells Cigar City brews. Well worth your coin, even if you're not a fan of most IPAs."
"Overall- So damn good for a shelf beer! We get no CCB beers here in Ohio, so this is a real treat. One of the best IPAs I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good but not great. I can think of many other IPAs that accomplish the true ""tropical fruit"" feel better, however this is unique in its relatively forward malt profile. Balanced? Maybe, sort of just malty with some lemon zest and an average IPA hop character."

""
""
""
"O: This is a phenomenal IPA. I picked this up as part of a pick six, but will be going back for a six pack while they still have them. Easily a top 5 IPA for myself. It just tastes right. Not too much in hops, just right. I look forward to drinking this late spring. If you see this, grab it."

"I'm so glad I found this IPA. Jai Alai is my go to, year round IPA. Being on the East coast, we get super fresh Jai Alai weekly in Philly. Thanks Cigar City!!! I'm never surprised to go into my lbs and find Jai Alai that was canned within two weeks of my purchase. Jai Alai taught me to always look at those bottle on dates and with the exception of the local breweries, no brewery pumps out awesome, fresh beer like Cigar City. I can't get enough of this stuff!"
""
"This is an exceptionally drinkable IPA. Mouthfeel is heavy and thick but very enjoyable."

"O - A tasty IPA that would taste and go down so well on a warm summer day. A must try if you like IPA's, and not to go unnoticed. I love the hops, Cheers!"

"This is my first experience with Cigar City, a friend gave me a can and I cant wait to try it. The pour is a somewhat hazy orange copper color with little head but very nice lacing. The aroma is pure hops. Lots of pine and citrus accented by some mango and tropical fruits. The nose makes it hard to believe that this is a single ipa and not a double. The body is medium and a little chewy with lots of hop resin beautifully coating the mouth. The flavor is an awesomely fresh hop bomb with all the notes that the nose promised augmented by just enough malt to balance the beer yet lend it virtually no sweetness. I still feel like the flavor is closer to a dipa than a single. This is a damn good beer and one that I would definitely try if it is in your area. Cigar City please come to Michigan."
""
""
""
"This is easily one of the best, if not the best, IPA I have ever had. I got a 6 pack as a present and I was surprised that I had never heard of Cigar City Brewing before (even though I work in a beer shop) When you pour the beer it has a very slightly opaque copper appearance with a fantastic foamy head. You can smell the hops, not overpowering but absolutely there. There are also some hints of a citrus and another smell I can't quite describe except to say it reminds me of fresh baked bread, but it is enticing. It is full bodied, but not to heavy. It found the right spot on the bell curve. The taste starts by hitting the salty and sweet taste buds then the hops hit the bitter receptors. However they made this combination it is amazing! Another great plus is a fantastic aftertaste and not overly carbonated. I would highly advise any IPA fans to try out Cigar City Jai Alai!"

"Good head with good retention and lacing. Nose is citrus and pear. Taste is smoothly bitter, with silky heat more than its purported 7.5%, not in a bad way. Medium bitter taste with fruity hop finish. Great beer, but perhaps not quite world class. This wasn't a super-fresh can, so I'll certainly taste it again if I ever have the chance."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear straw/orange color with a thin layer of foam clinging to the edge of the glass. The suds fall back into the drink, making lacing difficult and sparse, going more for the mosaic look than the ring look. Pine and resin accompany an overwhelming citrus aroma: grapefruit and orange are the heavyweights. There is some biscuit behind it, but you have to look for it especially when it is freshly poured and the carbonation is going well. The biscuit comes out a little more in the flavor, cooked well with some doughy presence, it comes first, then lots of citrus and resin, followed by a strong bitterness, but it isn't overwhelming. The citrus is almost tart and balances the bitterness well. The hop flavors are enough to knock me off my chair, they're so prevalent. The feel is quite dry, the body on the light side. This beer is focused on hops a lot, but there is some maltiness to it as well, balancing it out very nicely. The hop bite is a little harsh in this, so I'd switch to another drink sooner than, say, a Stone IPA or Racer 5, but the flavor is more of an experience so it's a trade off."
""
""
""
"Obviously I can't see the appearance but it tastes like a 4. Can't get a good smell but likely moderate fragrance with a major hop profile of citrus and flowers to get to another 4. I see a trend. The taste is the first metric that's palpable. Very hop forward with a moderate hop profile but decent smoothness. A little tingle. A dusty grain finish. Drink it if you can but I will likely try from a tap next."
""
""
""
"O- This is the beer that first got me into IPAs. It's got that brutal kick upfront that takes you aback, an orangey/fruity middle, and the bitter follow-through that reminds you what a hell of an IPA it is that you're consuming. Jai Alai is not only a terrific beer, but also a great marquee of the Florida beer scene."

"Overall a very Soild IPA. Very Soild as the flag bearer IPA of the brewery. Drinkable too, not exactly a session beer but ou can easily drink a few and on a warm day it would do nicely as opposed to some Heavier IPA. Like it a great deal and good for the price point."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Really nice flavorful beer. Has a real distinct fruity flavor that's smooth and easy to enjoy. Very balanced yet the hops stand out. Really glad to get to try this, my first cigar city beer. I cant get this too easy, but if I did, this would make my regular rotation, world class for sure."

"O- Overall, a great IPA. It's definitely in it's own category when it comes to flavor. It's original, I can't compare it to any other IPA I had. It has characteristics of 3-5 IPAs I've had in the past blended together."

"Pours a slight dark orange with a bit of cloudiness. Half inch off white head that settles into some moderate lacing on the side. On the nose, it smells of a combination of citrus fruits and caramel sweetness. Heavy on the hops though and it comes through on the first sip. Strong fruity flavors; both citrus and tropical. Leaves a nice aftertaste at the end of the sip. Bitterness is on par with all great IPAs. Really enjoyed this one and hope to have again soon!"

"* I also like that the 6pk cans come with the full cover retainer rings, ala Heady Topper, keeps the top of the cans clean, and they're recyclable -"
""
""
""
"It's probably worth mentioning that this beer was about three weeks old. There's a lot of good flavors going on in this beer. The really sweet malt, most noticeably on the front, and the tangy, resin-like bitterness from the hops on the back. Not necessarily balanced as other world-class IPAs, but still very pleasant. I really like how the sweetness comes through right from the start. Overall, this is a really enjoyable brew that I could see myself having a few of. A significant step above the Racer 5s and Hop Devils because of it's malt character and fresh flavor, but not well balanced or diverse to hang with the world class Plinys or Headys. A great beer that I would drink often if I had better access to it."

"Had this when I recently took a trip to Florida; bought a 6 of cans and was really surprised how good it was; a canned beer that really was noticably good. I drank one from the can and was very suprised and poured another into a glass and loved the way it looked and tasted. If this becomes a permanent presence in VA, I'll always have some in the fridge. If not, I'll always grab some when I'm down in Florida. It's nice when the rumors are true..."
""
"The body was orange-amber in color, clear, and gently carbonated; forming a two finger thick head that proved very durable. The first thing hit me as the can was opened was the tropical citrus smell, and it intensified upon pouring. Bringing the glass under the nose revealed a ton of grapefruit, mandarin orange, bitter orange, and a hint of papaya. The taste was very hoppy, revealing layers of grapefruit, pine, hay, and some butterscotch. The finish was spicy and earthy, and the body felt quite sticky. This straddled a line between a regular IPA and a DIPA, and should probably be considered a double. I am so glad I bought two sixpacks, as this would keep me happy for a while."

"Deep amber with orange tint and a hazy look to it. Just a light touch of foam on top covers most of the top of the beer. Brussels lacing. The aroma is an intoxicating burst of citrus hops. I get orange and mango notes. The front of the palate is like biting into a grapefruit. Intensely fresh hop flavor assaults your palate. This is quickly followed by a good malt backbone. That hop fades slowly away and beckons further sips. The mouth is moderately carbonated and the hops definitely prick the tastebuds."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste isn't as bitter as was my first impression of this beer. The piney hops are strong. A long slightly bitter finish with a clean sweet malt taste. Highly carbonated with the alcohol completely hidden. Medium bodied. Overall impression is this is an ipa with lots of flavor-big on those sticky pine like hops with high carbonation, a sticky lace and a sweet malt bill. Well made ipa. I prefer a more fruity, tropical hop bite with less bitterness but can see why it's so popular."

"Overall: I think this is a great beer, and well worth the anticipation. I honestly feel like if The Alchemist made a smaller IPA to compliment their Heady Topper DIPA (a lighter version), this would be it, or something very similar. In a recent trip through New England, I was fortune to pick up a case of the Heady, and thus I am impressed by the pleasant similarity here. Great Beer."

"O: Good, but not great. It may well be the best IPA made in FL, but I don't see myself hunting this one down aggressively in the future. That said, I'd be happy to drink it if it's what I had in my backyard, although there are some widely available IPAs I'd definitely take over it."

"12oz can. Pours a hazy copper color with a 1/4 inch of head. Some lacing. The aroma is rich tropical fruits. Mango, guava, papaya. Sweet orange and grapefruit. The taste mirrors the aroma. More of those tropical fruit flavors. Juicy. Some floral bitterness as well as a fair amount of malts. Bitter tropical fruits at the finish with some flowery hop aftertaste. Great amount of bitter hops throughout. Medium bodied. Overall, fantastic IPA I would love to have again."

"I searched high and low for this, but before they began distributing to Alabama it was next to impossible. I ultimately found it at a gas station and made my purchase. Poured into a glass, I immediately noticed the beautiful lacing and the delightful aroma. The taste was intense, but exactly what you look for from an IPA. I couldn't bring myself to finish it, because I didn't want it to be over. Thank you Cigar City for this beautiful execution."
""
"Overall, this is an awesome tropical fruit-forward IPA. I'm super glad I found it and I understand why it's consistently listed with other top-of-the-line IPAs such as Heady, Sucks, and the like. Awesome!"

"The mouthfeel was a bit slick with an understated carbonation. Medium body. Solid and worthy of the glowing reputation."
"I had this before from a bottle, but the legendary woodychandler hooked me up with a can, and it was even better. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a orange/brownish color with a 1/2 inch head.Smell is very hoppy, some notes of citrus. Taste is the smae, big hops up front, some citrus, bitter and dry, a tasty beer. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"D: This was a solid IPA with great hoppy scent and taste. The body was fine, and the finish was not harsh despite all the bitterness. So it was pretty easy to drink, and improved further as it warmed. Seems like this could fade quickly, so make sure to drink this brew while it's fresh if possible. Delicious."
"O - A good IPA, but a little overrated. Nice fruit taste, but very thin."
"if you live in florida, this is a must buy."

"I love when the Crack! reveals a brimful craft CAN and this was no exception. I would have liked to go with an inverted Glug, but given that the CAN directs me to ""[p]our gently", I have no choice but to do so. The ex-Old Lady said it drove her nuts to see me employ an inverted Glug, but my response was that unless directed otherwise, that is how I roll. Mission accomplished! I still produced a dense finger of tawny head with decent retention, but great lacing forming as it fell. Color was a slightly-hazy coppery-amber (SRM = > 13, < 17). Nose was citrusy, but not in the usual way for an AIPA. Instead, it was softer and more rounded at the edges, grapefruit and some malt as well as some fruity yeast-driven esters. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste evinced pine, grapefruit, wood (like oak) and even banana! Wild. I CAN imagine what all of the different modifications to this beer must be like. No wonder people are so crazy for this one. Finish was semi-dry thanks to all of the different flavors going on within this beer. It has to rank as a unique AIPA IMHO."

The citrus is just what I expected out of this, and was much more impressive than the pour I had on draft while in Florida."

"The beer pours a coppery/malty looking amber topped by a tightly-packed and thin off-white had that laces. The nose has big caramel, malty sweetness upfront with citrusy hops and a touch of biting booze making noise in the background. The taste is a super balance between assertive, citrusy hops and malt sweetness - there are no lingering unpleasantries. I don't remember the mouthfeel being so balanced and juicy when it was pumped through draught lines @ tgif in Orlando... but the beer's sweet, medium body pushes back hard against the potent, grapefruity hops and linger in harmony with utmost drinkability. I'm really impressed by this beer, though I've had it several times, and would definitely drink again."

"Overall: This has been on my wish list for awhile. I am so glad we can get it in Northern Virginia and hope this means we will get more Cigar City beers up here in the future!!!!"

"Loved this beer. So happy I finally got to try the hype that is known as Jai Alai. The beer definitely lived up to my admittedly high expectations. Drinking this beer fresh certainly helped but it may very well be the best east coast IPA out there."
""
"Excellent IPA, wish we could get it around here. Poured at a good temperature with a nice size, cream-color, foamy head that soon settles to a light cover and some lace. Color is a nice clear amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is equal parts hop& malt, some toffee, caramel, fruit, spice. Flavor's like nose, great balance, clean, and just plain flat out yummy. Body/carbonation spot on. Finish is like taste, average length, no off flavs, and I want to drink this till the cows come home. Pity we can't get it around here."

"12 oz can. Pours hazy orange with huge, long lasting, fluffy, white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops, orange marmalade and bready malt. Body is full and crisp. Citrusy hops, orange marmalade, biscuit malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long, fruity and bitter. Tasty, complex IPA."
"Purchased at publix in marco island , florida for 9.99$ a sixer...what a steal."

"I drink this guy out of the can, so I'll assume appearance is as good as all other aspects. The smell is such a unique aroma for an IPA. While I know it's going to be citrusy, JA just has this X factor that I'm not experienced enough to put my finger on. Taste is the same way. It's like Cigar City took an amazing IPA and an amazing grapefruit juice and said, ""you will now be one"". Feel is great, carbed well, goes down smooth with the sightest hint of dryness after taste leaving me craving more. Easily one of my all time favorite IPAs, and one that I certainly hope makes its way to Indiana distribution so I don't have to travel/trade to enjoy."

"Served in a funkwerks goblet - nice tangerine body with a huge white fluffy head. Pretty pungent aroma - tangerine, tropical fruit, mango, papaya and even some nice maltiness (akin to the first aroma that hits the nose upon walking into a brewery). Flavors follow suit pretty closely - relatively light bodied and light bitterness. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Now I see why this one's so popular. My new favorite IPA, beating (dare I say it?) Heady Topper. Could drink this one in abundance. Well done, Cigar City."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer starts with hops upfront. They are not overpowering however and it is well balanced overall. Excellent IPA pretty much from start to finish."

"A flavorful IPA with great balance, but also relatively mellow enough to be sessionable. Quite different from the tropical Cigar City Dry hopped on the High Seas."

"Great IPA very enjoyable for the first time having Cigar City. I will definitely be travels back to NVA."
""
"Overall - I'm completely blown away by this beer. I think it is the best tasting beer I've had the privilege of trying to date. The nose is really impressive with a huge piney dose but the citrus notes are still very prominent. If it was readily available in my area, this would be my beer."
""
""

"O - A delicious IPA with very fine balance between tropical sweetness and hop bitterness. The tannin/tea aspect adds a certain Je Ne Sais Quoi that really works. Good stuff."

"Thanks to Three Fishes for sending a sixer over the summer. Reviewing from memory, but it's pretty well burned in. A crisp, aggressive blast of juicy mango and grapefruit. Personally I think the drinking experienced is enhanced a bit by the can design. The retro 70's green and orange screams ""juicy fruit"" and that's exactly what you get. If ya got it, drink it fast. I mistakenly shoved one can to the back of the fridge, and while it was still enjoyable, with a few months on it , Jai Alai is not the same beer. Unconditionally recommended for hopophiles."
""
"Overall; Extremely happy to have this readily available once again. Digging the cans! Just incase it does pull another vanishing act I stocked up making this my go-to beer of the moment. Would love to try some of Cigar City's other offerings if they are ever available around my way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall both are exceptional IPAs and if you see either you should get it. However, I do think Jai Alai is better because it has a really distinct earthy flavor that I've never quite tastes before and is incredibly well balanced. Cheers!"
""
""
"Overall- I haven't had this in a while and just started seeing it in cans, its probably in my top 5 American IPA, just juicy hop goodness."

"I am a little surprised and very pleased with this one. I thought this ale would be a hop bomb with little balance. At 7.5% ABV, this IPA is dangerously quaffable. I am only disappointed it is not available in my area."

"O This beer should be talked about in the same discussion as Heady Topper. Unlike most AIPA, this one is not overly bitter and extremely well balanced. the overly sharp hop bitterness that's associated with ipa's is balanced by the malt sweetness. In all honesty, YES i have had heady topper (family lives not far away i have it a lot) YES i have tried Gandhi bot the brewery is down the street. YES i have had pliney the pine bomb elder (i like that about pliney). If i had to choose of the three, I'm going to take the Jai Alai. it is now available in NYC so I am able to get my hands on it, and for that i am grateful!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really good stuff. Tons of tropical and citrus hop qualities with a good malt backbone to keep things balanced. Definitely worth trying if you can get it."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is great, really citrusy and bitter. Tastes like drinking orange/grapefruit juice straight outta the can. More like citrus juice than the other IPAs. Most comparable to Elevated IPA from Le Cumbre or Sculpin from Ballast Point. Tried in Florida while there for an interview."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice hazel-orange with almost no head (if you tilt pour!) and smells like spring time...flowers and fruits and rainbows (not the rainbows really). Tastes phenomenal. Really holds its own against other IPAs. Super smooth drinking, I wish I had a lot more of this! Would highly recommend, enjoy! Cheers"

"Poured from a can, dated 10/3/13, into a Dogfish Head tulip. A dim, hazy, well carbonated orange-red color fills the glass. Splotchy lacing sticks to the sides with a frothy white head that receded to a thin ring. Dipping my nose into the glass reveals a huge citrus-forward aroma of oranges, grapefruit, and pleasant pine scent. It's nothing that you haven't smelled before in an IPA, just balanced perfectly to make you smile. The flavors mirror the smell with more pine on the finish. Medium-bodied and a little more viscous that I anticipated, but not in a bad way. This is very well-made juice and I hope that one day Cigar City makes it to VA. With this one being my first, I can guarantee it won't be my last. Cheers!"

""
"Certainly a top tier IPA here. No question. Solidly and pleasantly hoppy with a nice balance."
"Overall: Yep, this one is a winner. I love how it leans toward the sweet hops with the bitter ones hanging in the background. The malt backbone is pronounced and strong, but is nicely balanced with the hops. The alcohol is also hidden exceptionally well (except for realizing you may be a tad tipsy while writing your review). My fridge will definitely see this one from time to time."
""
""
"O - Good IPA, I've had it a while back, definitely easy to drink just the right amount of everything."
""
""
""
"Poured into a sam adams glass, nice head developed, off white to tan in color. Head was more frothy than dense with mild retention and lacing. Appearance was slightly hazy with an orange, amber color. Aroma had hop and fruit notes. Hoppy taste with some malt notes on the back, hints of spice and toffee. Medium mouthfeel with a malty and lingering aftertaste."
""
""
"Attractive burnished orange-copper color, impressive head with good retention, strong grapefruit and tangerine on the nose, zesty hops-centric flavors of citrus fruits and pineapple on the palate, good balance with the malt for such a potent, hops-forward ale, excellent length. A terrific IPA with bright, zesty hops reminiscent of tropical fruits, an IPA that nonetheless offers good malt balance."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: another top tier IPA - all accolades are appropriate - if there weren't so many great IPAs I could rave, but suffice it to say that this is right there with many of the best in the style, such as AleSmith's IPA, Union Jack, and Flower Power."
""
"Overall: Definitely lives up to the hype. I should mention that I am not a hop head, I'm not even a big IPA fan, plus, its October (I should be drinking an Octoberfest), but this beer defies the odds. It is an amazing IPA. Definitely one of the best IPAs I've ever tried. In fact, it almost restores my faith in IPAs. If you're thinking about picking this up or trying it, definitely do it."
""
""
""

"Overall this is an excellent IPA, not quite as clean as some of the west coast ipa's but awesome nonetheless. Although quite pricey it was worth the sample. Will definitely seek this out if i am in Florida in the future!"

"Very good IPA. Would definitely drink again. Well worth seeking out."
"Clearly a matter of taste here, but I prefer a hop forward IPA, and Jai Alai doesn't meet that qualification for what I am seeking. Anyone expecting a tropical fruit blast from Jai Alai is bound to be disappointed, and I wouldn't bother to seek it out again despite the unusually high rating."

"Good beer. Poured from the can into a glass. Comes out a nice golden type color with minimal head. You can immediately begin to smell the hops. Very citrusy. The taste is just like it smells. Very hoppy with just the right amount of kick. If you like hops and you enjoy a great ipa, this is your choice."
""

""
""
""
""

"This is super light and refreshing and would make a great beer for just every day drinking."

"Pours a clear amber with a thick, white head that settles into a long-lingering cap. Good lacing. Aroma of pine, tropical fruit, and fresh cut grass. Big, juicy hops hit the front of the tongue with lots of pineapple and mango. Finishes with a bitter hop kick. Sweet malt balances all this bitterness quite nicely. Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Overall, an extremely well crafted IPA. Great job Cigar City."

"O- Really enjoyed this beer. The moment I smelled it, I knew I would like this beer. Didn't expect the slight bit of peach in flavor, but really liked it. Great IPA. Would definitely drink again."
""
"For what I am told we are spoiled with Cigar city only distributing in Florida. Jai Alai is most definitely enjoyed at 4 days since canned. Wow it is fresh IPA and when you crack open a can during a hot Miami summer afternoon its dammmn good. I have had this stuff from the brewery in Tampa and it's great on tap too. They don't ship bottles of this stuff so if you find it in a bottle you're probably having it old as f##K. Anyways CCB always prints the date on the bottom of the can when it was made. So anything less than a month its gonna be awesome. It still taste good after 90 days but they don't like selling anything past 90 days so CCb is serious about putting a quality product. MUST DRINK. OVERALL_Amazing beer"
""
""
"O - Pretty awesome drinkability, blanaced really well, hoppy initially but all the tropical fruit swoops in mellows things out in the finish - fruits and juices are very very flavorful."
""
""
"To date this is the finest IPA I have ever tasted. Discovered it at a small restaurant in Ybor City in Tampa. I found 6 packs available only at Whole foods in Tampa and no where else since. I judge all IPA's based on this one and Sierra Nevada my old standby which I gave an 8. Learning more each day about the brewing and chemistry of IPA beers. The beer was equally good in the bottle."

"Poured from can into HF snifter. Pours hazy darker orange, almost copper. Half finger head, great retention. I've always liked the smell of this beer, very citrusy, with a hint of bitterness. Taste follows the same. This can is about a month old, and it has fallen off a bit. The citrus doesn't have the same bite that it does fresh. It angers me a but when IPAs fall off that quickly, but this is still s great IPA."
"This was my first introduction to IPAs, found it available on tap at The Living Room Restaurant in Boynton Beach, FL a few years ago. Prior to that I was a pretty undiscriminating beer drinker, choosing anything from Bud Light to Heineken to Sam Adams. It was a revelation to find a new type of beer with a really great taste. The thickness and smoothness of this beer combined with the tingling bitterness made an instant impression on me. Now I've taken every opportunity to try different beer varieties and IPAs remain my favorite, with Jai Alai being one of my top five or so."

"While not my favorite style, I recognize the superb quality of this beer. Great hazy and foamy appearance, strong citrusy smells, and piney and medium-hopped flavors. For the abv, this is a very easy-drinking IPA, with much complexity. Very floral and the right orange and lemon smells. this is the kind of beer that could change my mind about IPAs. Excellent."

"Poured into a snifter glass. not much heads, beautiful golden orange color. Aromas of pear, mango, tropical fruits, hint of citrus. First sip was quite magical, very pronounced citrus hops and well balance bitterness, dry malty finish. Little lacing but that was ok with me. As I agitate in the glass, the aromas of the tropical fruity notes are really vibrant! Solid beer, great job Cigar City!!"
"Quick note... the difference between a fresh Jai Alai and a Jai Alai that might have sat a while is pretty substantial. If you truly want an idea of just how good and complex this beer is, it would behoove you to seek out some fresh cans. Enjoy :D"

"12oz can, thanks to Ken for picking this up while in Florida.  The ale is a hazy tangerine color topped with a creamy, off-white head, good retention¬†& lacing on the glass. Fresh tropical aroma of mandarin, mango, pineapple with some biscuity grain.  Juicy tropical flavors of mango, passionfruit, mandarin, and pineapple gush on the palate with biscuity and toasty grain. Nice moderate carbonation allows flavors to meld, finishes somewhat bitter but not overly.  Truly a unique IPA. I haven't had anything like this one before. Definitely gives a Florida feel with all the unique tropical notes. A must try if you get the opportunity."

"One of my favorite IPAs. Nicely balanced, refreshing, maybe a little cloying for some but this is a fantastically juicy, hoppy beer that is perfect for consumption in hot, humid climes."
""
""
""
""
"T: Unfortunately, it seems this can is past its best days (2 weeks! WTF!) Still, what's left of this is a solid beer. Lots of bready malt coat the palate upfront, with some grapefruit pith, lemon seed and tangerine rind in the mix as well. There's a bit of a peppery, earthy hop note on the finish, and I get some herbal hop resin, mint and white pepper as the finish fades. Still very good and drinkable, but far from the hop bomb that I've been expecting. I'm gonna have to go to Tampa."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice hue, decent head, and some persistent sticky lacing. Nose is bready with pine, spice, citrus, and honey. Very well-balanced. Super-hoppy flavor with strong citrus notes and some slight sweet and wood character. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Overall this is one of the best IPA's I've had if not THE best IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An incredible IPA. We were able to compare this two day old growler to some 2 week old cans, and I hate to say it but the growler was indeed better. The canned was, of course, awesome as well. Interesting regardless."
""
"O:"
""
"As a Florida native and Jai Alai fan, I may be a bit biased on this beer- but hopefully my general feeling of ambivalence towards IPA's will even out my review. Let me start off by saying that it is not as well-balanced, in my opinion, as Bell's Two-Hearted or Longhammer IPA; however, it is amazing for a hyper-hop brew. As others have mentioned, it is distinctively fruity, tasting like grapefruits and passion fruits. The malt is very light without being unnoticeable, and the high alcohol-content is masked by some kind of . . . voodoo sacrifice? It is beautiful, truly. It is not the best . . . but perhaps among the best of the IPA's."
"O - Fantastic combination of heavy heavy resin, piney and also citrusy hops, sweet caramel malts and tropical fruits. Unique but very welcome mouth feel, definitely one of the better every day IPAs I've had to this point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours light apricot in color, very little head, because I had to pour very slowly to keep tons of yeast out of the glass. Lots of citrusy aromas here, grapefruit, lemon, orange peel, pineapple just to name a few. Really a great smelling beer. The taste is just as good if not better. Bitter mango and pineapple, dank and dirty grapefruit peel, refreshing sweetness in the end. The feel is quality as well with medium body, easy to drink, especially on the beach. Too bad I can't get it in Ohio, every trip I make to Flordia I'm going to pick this up."
""

"o: as a fan of the sweeter IPAs i am enjoying this. its refreshing yet has a fuller body than i expected. it is on the sweeter side, with the nice East Coast bitterness as well. i am really enjoying this."

I'm not a big IPA fan (like it, don't love it) but this is one of my favorites. The hops and bitterness are very well balanced and not overpowering. Overall just a good beer."
""
""
"Expected hoppy pine bitterness was definitely there but very drinkable. Remember chewing on a long blade of grass when you were a kid? A little bit of that taste and a hint of sweetness. Very smooth finish with no overpowering bitterness. Couldn't wait to grab another. Not my favorite what with Zombie Dust and Daisy Cutter in my neck of the woods, but very, very good. Liked it better than Two Hearted."

"O - I was really worried this beer wouldn't live up to the hype; instead, it blew away my expectations. I cannot say enough about this beer; I haven't been as impressed with an IPA since I first sipped Enjoy By."
"O - Yes, this is a very nice IPA. I can't get in WI without trading, but I have a tropical hop bomb right here in town called Fantasy Factory. I really enjoyed this one and want to thank Grant for hauling it all the way from FL."
""
""
"Best IPA I've tasted. Not really such a profound statement since I'm pretty new to the craft beer world. Mine had lots of floaties in it, but from other reviewers comments I guess that's to be expected since it was not kept cold. It was brought to me from Tampa by a friend. As far as I know it didn't adversely affect the taste though (first one, so how could I know). This is not a one dimensional beer as I think is often the case with a lot of IPA. Jai Alai is much more balanced, with a healthy malt presence. It also has a much thicker mouth-feel than your standard IPA. A fantastic brew that I hope returns to Georgia very soon. Floridians should not be allowed to keep this to themselves (blatant jealousy intended)."

" This would've gotten strait 5's from me but I had to lower the taste and mouthfeel to 4.5 due to my humble opinion that this is a little more resemblant to a DIPA than an IPA... sort of a hybrid. Appearance and Smell reel you in right away that this is gonna be a damn good IPA than you taste it and BAM hoppy as hell followed by a subtle sweetness only the subtleness of the sweetness becomes less subtle the more you drink. I'm not complaining very very enjoyable just the more you drink the more it morphs into DIPA territory. Damn find beer and I cannot wait until CCB can maintain the demand for its home state and this native Floridian can enjoy his home states best when CCB decides to come back to the ATL."

"Overall: I had a Zombie Dust just before this and ZD is fantastic but I find this just so much easier to drink because it is so damn smooth and citrus bitter-sweet perfection."

"This was canned 5 weeks ago so the malt may be more forward at this point. It's a decently hoppy IPA with nice tropical fruit notes, but the malt notes are a bit too much in the mix for my personal taste. Would definitely like to try this more fresh. Good beer nonetheless."

"Poured from a can into a standard pint glass. White head with enough foam, nice lacing as the glass was emptied. Color was light orange. Looks very good. Doesn't smell as strong as I remember. But whats there is very citrusy. Love the taste, but again, not as strong as I remember it being. Very balanced with citrus, grapefruit and orange. Mouthfeel is just a tiny bit syrupy. Overall, love this beer and it is my go to IPA."

"O: Overall, a very nice IPA. I had this beer many times when I lived in FL and was never too impressed, but revisiting it now for the first time in a year or two and I liked it more than I remembered. Maybe the canning has allowed it to hit distro fresher than before (or maybe I was just drinking unfresh bottles/drafts back them). Either way, not mind blowing, but well above average, and an enjoyable beer that I will certainly drink again."

"I'm finally getting to try this one. Popped up at Abe's in Bethlehem PA, in cans. I have sat on this for a little while (canned Jan 15 2013) but it still tastes rather fresh. The appearance may have suffered, but I can't be sure whether this is due to sitting in the fridge or not. It's a nice golden amber color, but has a lot of unpleasant looking sediment... and I mean worse than Heady Topper. Anyway, not a big deal at all though. The lacing is fantastic from the bubbly white head. Good amount of carbonation. The aroma is fruity, tangy, and juicy. When drank, the taste is no let down compared to the very pleasing aroma... although it is more bitter than the smell suggests. Sharp and resinous. The fade lingers for the finish, and is medium to full bodied... excellent. Overall, this IPA is up there with the best of 'em!"
""
"O - Very solid offering; perhaps not as crisp as some, but quite tasty"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O/D - Such a delicious IPA. No alcohol evident in the flavour. So well done. Very sessionable. Really juicy and flavourful and well crafted very properly. A lovely IPA."

"O: A beautiful IPA that is not only very easy drinking but also one of the best hopped with Citra that I have ever had."
""
""
""
""

"O-A top notch IPA, could have used a tad more bitterness for my taste but still great."
"O- A great IPA bursting with great flavors. The look and aroma make this seem like a Heady Topper Jr."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. There are small bits of sediment seen floating around after the pour. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with a citrus zest flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Just picked up a six pack on Longboat Key. Canned two days ago. Smells like candied tropical fruit, tastes the same, creamy malty tropical citrus, very little bitterness, slight spice. My wife loved it too. Who knew they could brew such a great beer from Florida gator p@@s water. Not a tongue bruiser hut one ofthe best I've ever had."
""
""
"I wish I wasn't spoiled with the White Oak version first. This is still fantastic. Peachy O's in a can!"
""
"The beer pours a ruddy copper orange color with a nice rocky head of smaller bubbles. The head leaves behind a lovely sticky sheet of lacing that forms a ring with some nice stalactites running from it. In the body, the beer is very clean and light, and completely clear of particles. On the nose, the beer smells of tropical pine trees with a touch of mango citrus. The beer smells even better from the can, where the citrus is amped up into pineapple range while the pine amplifies as well into dank resinous hops. The hops are big but not overpowering, and really quite inviting. The malt base behind it is warm and bready with a terrific yet subtle rye spice. On the tongue, the beer tastes bittersweet with a nice warming heat from the spice flavor. The flavors begin as bready spice, which builds into bitter pine and grapefruit flavors with a touch of pineapple. The finish is strong with bitters which move towards medicinal in flavor with a nice little hiccup of spice to close out the finish. The aftertaste also tingles with spice and bitter pine. This is not an in-your-face IPA flavor, and certainly not a big double IPA, but it is delicious and still fills my bitter-thirst. The nuances between the hops and the generic spice flavor continue to unfold different flavors on the tongue, and really make this beer fun to drink. In the can, this beer‚Äôs fruit flavors are intensified and made crisper while the spice is diminished. I get a lot of juicy pine and orange citrus hops with a touch of cool mint at the back of the throat. On the mouth, the beer feels medium creamy in carbonation with just a touch of tingle. The beer‚Äôs body feels medium light on the tongue, and the mouth is left properly dry and a touch sticky. Alcohol is present only as a soft tingle in the sides of the mouth. Overall, this is a damn fine IPA that stands out by being different. I love the spice and I love the mixture of the hops with the spice. This is a terrific in-the-can beer, and this is a terrific out of the can beer. It is my first taste of Cigar City, and I have to say that I‚Äôve enjoyed it, they pack a hell of a lot of flavor into it, and they hide the alcohol brilliantly. Try this beer."

"This ale made my hotel nights at Disneyworld tolerable. Pours a hazy dirty orange color with rather thick and creamy off-white head. Nose is nicely enticing with some candied fruits, fresh fruits, and an herbal/grassy presence. On the palate there's a big juicy fruit hop quality right away with plenty of tartness, some decent malt balance, and a very good body. Savory, rewarding, and drinkable. Probably my favorite on the shelves in Florida."
""
"Hop forward with noticeable spice.. I enjoyed it but the the spicy flavor to the hop profile is not my go to for IPA's, still I enjoyed it. All in all worth seeking out and trying. I was far more impressed by the Maduro Brown ale. This being offered in a can was a plus."
"Served from a can to a snifter glass. Cigar City's Jai Alai a crisp and refreshing IPA. It has a nice dark orange color. You can smell the tropical aromas jump out at you as you begin to take a sip. Smells of grapefruit and pineapple jump at you. The initial citrus flavors invade your pallet with a crisp hoppy finish towards the end. The mouthful is crisp and refreshing with just the right amount of hops, the bitterness doesn't linger in the back of the pallet. Truly another delicious beer from Cigar City."
"O ‚Äì This is a great IPA. The aroma and taste are great and are just packed with fruity, juicy hops. It‚Äôs a bit thinner than I would like, but that‚Äôs really the only complaint I can have about this beer. I‚Äôve been wanting to try this one for a while and I‚Äôm so glad that I finally did. Thanks, Joel!"

"I've had this beer plenty of times, most of the time with about 3-4 week's of age on it. However I was able to get some 10 day old cans today and I thought I would review. Pours a beautiful hazy orange-gold with a decent amount of fluffy creamy head, great lacing. This is by far one of the most unique smelling IPA's out there, the aroma just says Florida! I'm getting a ton of citrus, pineapple, mango and slight canned peachy goodness! Taste is right there with the nose, this is a perfect beach beer after a long day of surfing. Overall a very well balanced easy drinking offering from Cigar City. A must try for everybody who loves great beer!"

"Glad to finally try this. Poured can into tulip. Pours hazy light orange with a frothy two finger head. Smell is bready, sweet fruit, tropical, slightly piney. Tastes is tropical fruits, biscuit , pine, very subtle malt backbone. smooth for the amount of flavor and the ABV level. This ipa is fairly complex without being overpowering, it is very very drinkable. Floridians are lucky to have this at their fingertips, great iPA that packs tons of flavor without overdoing the hop profile."
""
""

"Overall- Not a bad IPA. Maltier than expected. Can't wait to try the white oak I have as well."
""
"O) I've been waiting to try this one, and it definitely met my expectations. This is one delicious IPA. This is definitely one of those beers that you wish was available where you reside, but sadly it is not. I will make sure to savor the few cans I have left. Glad to recommend this beer."
"Great that it comes in cans, which say (Drink Fresh, Dont age.)"
""
""
""
""

"Orange hazy appearance. Smell is citrus and tropical fruits. Represents exactly what I look for in an ipa. Taste is like juicy nectar. Citrus from the hops dominates the palate with a light malt backbone to balance. Hops definitely take the spotlight. Mouth feel is nice and light. Overall I'd day this is my favorite ipa at the moment. Gonna bring done back to Chicago for sure."

"Some guy said its not as good as Pliny or Hopslam. Well no kidding. Add Zombie Dust Abrasive and others to that list. That said this is a very solid IPA at 7.5 ABV not a session beer but drinks like one. When in Florida it can be tough finding fresh beer of this quality from out of town breweries (found some year old Two Hearted Ale). This is the best beer brewed in Florida. Cans are nice touch too for many of the activities people do when in Florida."

"Drinkability, however, is remarkable. The perfect level of bitterness on the finish, perfect balance of flavors that belie the 7.5% abv, making this one feel bigger than it is. Smooth and inviting. The only thing that could make this just a bit more fantastic would be if it were filtered but I won't let my likes get in the way of a great ale review."

"O- this is borderline DIPA, the hops certainly dominate. I really enjoy the leafy-hop notes and the clean finish. Solid IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is about as close to a DIPA as you can get without being one. Lots of malt and body, almost enough hops to make it excellent. Still enjoying this immensely, but this could be close to perfect with more hops to lend to the aroma and flavor. I compare this to Lagunitas Sucks - both have impressive malt backgrounds and similar ABVs and mouthfeels, but Sucks is just better hopped. Again, still really enjoyed this, just not in my top 5."
"Overall: I'll admit, I'm just getting into the IPAs, but this was a good start. It makes me definitely want to seek out more. I've had a couple of others, and I'd rank this one above them. It's light feeling, fresh, and the smell and taste stay throughout the entire process. When I'm in the mood to revisit, this one will definitely be on my mind."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the kind of beer that can elicit alot of different reviews because nothing about it is very pronounced. It is a very well balanced beer that does a superb job of melding its parts harmoniously. Yet, nothing really stands out about it either. Overall, I really like this beer because it is a breath of fresh air in the craft beer scene where IPAs tend to try to ""out-hop"" each other. I can imagine sitting back and rolling through a sixer of these on a beautfiul spring afternoon. This is my kind of beer."

" nothing special i won't have a 2nd i will stick to good beer its not brewed in florida"
""
""
""
"have to thank my mom for this one, best fedex package ever! thanks mom. poured a rich coppery red color from the can, with sudsy off white foam that lasts forever. sticky and sweet is the nose, sappy, resinous, and fresh. the hops are very woody, pine-like, but maybe not so aromatic as some of the more spruce heavy IPAs. mid round caramel malt body underneath all the hops. the flavor of this one is huge, super fresh, and unique in the sense that its got a very foresty feel to it, and some mineral richness that are both uncommon for the style. not that location matters, but this feels more like a Canadian beer to me than one made in florida. its got the real sturdy bearded sort of fortuity that I just don't associate mentally with the sunshine state. this is super impressive. big creamy feel that keeps the foam going in the mouth but doesn't get heavy. its sort of soapy in feel, but not in taste obviously. bitterness in the finish isn't very intense at all, almost tranquilizing really, and the alcohol is invisible. I could not have asked for a better sixpack for cold weather drinking on the Furthur lot this weekend. truly one of the few beers that lives up to the hype, this is a gem."
""
""
""
"I was surprisingly impressed by this IPA. Living in Florida I've had total access to CCB's line up of beers. I have to say that I don't love them all but Jai Alai Is my kind of IPA. The color is very golden and pure. The aroma is a terrific citrus smell with the familiar pine presence as well. The taste follows the nose with a up front citrus presence followed by the hops to back it up. Just the right amount of hops without getting out of control but enough to keep the hop heads happy. Excellent balance with the 7% abv completely hidden and all you can think about is popping another beer. Overall this is an excellent IPA and is now part of my regular rotation. I only wish it were a little less expensive."
""
""
""
""
"O - It is a pretty good IPA. Maybe it's the fact that people down in Florida don't have many good craft breweries to choose from, but I think this beer is a bit overrated. After having this for the first time it wasn't one of those beers that I had to tell my friends about or something that I would seek out to share with a fellow beer geek. When I think of the single IPA's that made me want to share them with everybody I know (Alpine Nelson, Fat Head, Kern River Just Outstanding) it just doesn't fall into that same category...it's somewhere in the second tier. It's a good IPA, but there are tons of good IPA's out there...so don't go out of your way to find this, but definitely try it if it's readily available to you."
"O- Some of the strongest mango notes I've ever tasted from hops are in this beer. Absolutely Delicious. I am going to annihilate this sixer."
"D: I was hoping to be a little more blown away here. certainly a good AIPA, but cant say that I am blown. maybe I had too high of expectations....anyway, like I said nothing bad, just nothing mind blowing."

"A great year round IPA by Cigar City, you can only get this beer in can or on tap. Cigar City has halted bottling this beer. A fruit bomb IPA that has a beautiful golden hazy color with a nice two finger head. Hoppy and sweet with a nice dry finish. This is truly one of Florida's great beers that the rest of the United States needs to discover. They are starting to brew some great beers in Florida."

" Sweet citrus and malts hit upfront, with bitterness from the piney hops in the back. The finish is mostly grapefruit. Damn refreshing. Absolutely no alcohol bite here, just a smack in the palate of a damn good IPA. So very easy to drink...but not light. This is just a good, hearty, flavorful ""west-coast style"" IPA made in Florida. So happy to finally get a chance to try it. Very much wish I could get it in Texas."

"Jai Alai. Blown away. There. I said it. This beer was fantastic, and it was much better than I was anticipating. I mean, I've heard good things about it, but I never thought it would be this good. Alcohol is seemingly absent, and 7.5% ABV isn't anything to scoff at. So goddamn drinkable and so goddamn tasty. Why don't they sell this in Michigan?"

"O-Not a bad IPA, I can see the allure. I just prefer my IPA's lighter with crisper flavors. This was canned 3 months ago, but this was the last out of the 6er and the first one I had a month ago, I felt the same way about."

"Canned 12/30/12. Pours a tanned leather with a frothy 3 fingers of rocky foam - nice head and legs. While i am writing this i already know how i want to score this but the ""bros"" 100 for this beer is amazing to me. As far as i know they havent given us sixes to rate with. This beer is nowhere near heady, pliny, anything by alpine, sucks, columbus ipa and the list goes on. Really, if 100 is perfection its unfair to rate this beer that high but it is a good beer; but i digress. The nose brings caramel malts, lime rind and honestly not much else this is very malt forward and struggle to find any tropical qualities to this beer (i love cigar city and have many of their beers i am just struggling to see why this is rated so high). Mouth brings a slightly herbal twinge, cat piss and some light shades of citrus - beginning to think my less than a month old can is past its prime (this is the second one i opened and both are consistent). Easy to drink much in the same way moretti doppio malto is, overall this is barely above average in my book."
"M- Medium-high carbonation, medium body. Overall a very solid IPA, refreshing and complex. Recommendable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drank it out of the 12-ounce can. Very first Cigar City beer and I was blown away. Poured a copper to golden color. Drank smooth and had a great citrusy and tropical fruit aroma. Drank it straight out of the can most of the time. This beer has everything you want in an IPA. Has jumped up very fast on my list of IPA's. Great Beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"I hope it's OK if I freestyle here. Everybody else has summed up the basics. I really like this beer and can't believe something this good is available at my local Publix, in a can no less. A true west coast (of Florida) IPA. Super delicious. My wife is on antibiotics right now and it really pisses her off when I squeal like a little girl after each sip cause she can't have any."

"The body was good, smooth over the tongue, with a dry and bitter finish. Drinkability was good, but as a penalty for not reading the can first, my last pour came with a huge amount of floaty yeast chunks. Ooopsie. Overall, a very nice take on the style, if this were local to me, it would be in my regular rotation for sure. A must try if you see it, and probably worth trading for to try."
"Overall this is excellent."
""
""
"Poured from the can into a pint glass, the ale was a copper color and producing a 1 inch head. Sediment was evident throughout the glass after the initial pour. The foam left lacing on the glass, demonstrating some retention. The nose was a big citrus hop aroma, an array of citrus fruit were present. In the initial taste one detects notes of ginger, grapefruit, papaya, guava, and a certain degree of earthiness. After the initial pour, the carbonation mellowed pretty quickly. This allowed the fruit to linger nicely on the tongue, giving the impression of citrus fruit skin. In the aftertaste, one detects grapefruit and pineapple continuing. A mild warming sensation lingers on the back of the throat. A very well produced American IPA with a diverse palate."

"Thanks to the bartender who gave this to me from her personal cigar city stash when I was in florida recently because she didn't like IPA's!!!"

"I was soooo disappointed in the taste and mouthfeel. Most overrated beer I have had. Tinny, no body, extremely hoppy but lacked the fullness. I don't understand the raves. Bitter hops w/ grapefruit and orange peel. Seems unbalanced and almost metallic to me. I was disappointed. I would not order this again."

"O - This is wonderful. So easy to drink. I'm noticing the heavy tangerine could be a little off putting after a few, but nevertheless, this is really a great beer. From beginning to end. Easily one of the best single IPA's I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Perhaps a tad too bitter, lacking in head retention. Not a trace of alcohol to be found in the nose, taste or mouthfeel, which is rather impressive for a 7.5% single IPA. All in all a really, really juicy IPA that is absolutely perfect for the oppressive humidity in Florida. SO happy I live just on the opposite coast from them, my fridge will never be without at least one can of this."
""
""
"Pours a dirty copper with a big frothy cream colored head. An aroma that is biscuity and citric, nice interplay between malt and hops. Flavor follows suit but the citric is more upfront and is both juicy and sweet and some tropical fruits are also there. A touch of bitterness in the finish. A medium to light body, nice activity. Overall, this is a great IPA and right up there with Odell's IPA, Bell's Two Hearted, Brew Kettle's White Rajah for favorites of this style."

""
"Pours a hazy copper, with dense white head. Settles to a thin ring, leaving a sheet of delicate lace halfway down the glass. Smell: grapefruit rind, tangerine with passion fruit and a woodsy note. Taste: sugared grapefruit, apricot, light caramel and biscuit, a little toast. Medium bodied, juicy into oily, finishing sticky and drying with a mouthful of citrusy hop flavor. Canned Dec 10th. Hadn't had one of these for quite a while, which was a mistake, because this is excellent."
""
""
""
"O- This beer speaks for itself. Such an awesome go-to IPA."
""
""
"Bitter throughout the tasting, even up front. The malt is in the background--it's a little sweet and very ""round"" (full bodied). The bitterness is prickly and peppery. The aftertaste lasts a very long time. Overall, this may be a hop heavy IPA, but it has superb fresh flavors that go together well."

Taste full of light malts and moderately bitter floral, grapefruit citrus, and a touch of mango. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Really enjoyed it, solid IPA Cigar City has some great things going for it!"

"O: The first time I tried this beer I did not like it at all but tasting it now a second time I realize this is a solid hop forward balanced easy drinking IPA now that CCB is being distributed in VT I think I will be enjoying this beer much more regularly especially due to its sessionablity and high abv. There is one thing I will say is although it was quite good it did not blow my mind by any means."

"Crisp looking and deep gold/amber with some sediment present; exceptional foam, nearly a full inch; heavy lacing as well; smell-wise, this beer is really floral; smells like tangerines and oranges; Jai Alai has a pretty subdued taste given the heavy hints of hop and citrus on the nose; I'm getting notes of hops, bitter orange and tropical fruit, and some kind of cream; there is depth here, but I can't pinpoint what the layers are; it's crisp, creamy, and makes my glands salivate when I drink it; there's a solid malt-hop balance in the mouth; the bitter hops linger long on the tongue; overall, this is a solid IPA...plenty of punch packed without tasting too boozy. Great can of beer that I liken to Ska's Modus Hoperandi...with a little less bitter-hop up front and a lot more creaminess."
"O: One of my favorite beers. Not as much balance as some other IPA's, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."

"Update: fresh new can, consumed 1/29/2013. Definitely some floating yeast sediment or other particulates in this beer. Still tastes delicious though."

"Overall (4.0): This is a great beer, and I love it, but it‚Äôs not quite a 4.5 overall. The smell is the best part for me, but the taste isn‚Äôt far behind. Cigar City used a great blend of hops and a pulled this one off very well‚Äîjust very well-balanced without sacrificing in any way. My only real complaint is with the head, which could be thicker, chewier, and lacier, but that‚Äôs just me. This is a top-tier American IPA in my opinion, and certainly for the price it‚Äôs hard to beat. Now I just need to find it in cans!"

"Have had this from the can and the bottle. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a creamy white head on top. Aroma is huge mango and grapefruit, with some bitter pine. Flavor follows with beautifully tropical citrus notes, and a nice hit of bitter pine on the back end. Supported by plenty of malts, and no hint of the abv here. Light and airy, high carbonation, slick, and beautiful. Awesome beer to have regularly."

"I've had this beer on tap and it wasn't the same. It tasted much more like the standard American IPA. The amazing malty balance to the hops wasn't there and the body was lighter. It was also clear so it is likely the keg just wasn't agitated as necessary."
""
"Overall this rocked my socks! Seriously the ONLY brew I have ever wanted to just suck down."
""
""
""
"I haven't had anything like it. It is very, very good, a perfect IPA for someone who seeks sweetness in their beer."
""
""
"O- My first offering from Cigar City is a hit. Look forward to trying more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours beautifully and the fragrance is equally impressive. Flavor is citrusy tang on spicy hops. Robust, but still somewhat mature in it's delivery. Bitterness lingers on the tongue. Carbonation does a slight bit too, but provides no flavor interference. An excellent brew."
""
"Overall (4.0) - Overall a very drinkable, enjoyable IPA with a complex fruit character. Sadly that fruit character is overshadowed by potent bitterness, yet the resinous bitterness is also well done and pleasant so the end result is still a very good, enjoyable beer. Tasty and strong, this is a great one to try."
"O - Nice IPA, better than most you'll come across and surprisingly easy to throw down."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I liked this one a lot. A nice East Coast/West Coast hybrid. It's got big hop and malt flavor profiles going for it but keeps the palate from becoming overly complex. A very enjoyable IPA."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- I dont think this is a brett IPA, intentionally. The infection really takes away from what this could have been. Interesting to try something like this though."
""
"O- A really nice IPA, I'm a big fan of these juicy, tropical hop IPAs, I could easily drink several of these in a sitting without getting bored."

"Drinkability: A simple and fantastic IPA."

"Must be an old bottle. The taste and odor are faded, which is a shame, because what's left seems to suggest it's a real pleasure fresh. Have to try to secure a fresher bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think this bottle took on some stress in transit. The appearance, frankly, sucks. When I got this bottle it seemed to be about 80F. Chilled it right away, but the carbonation seems to have suffered. Mouthfeel and Appearance will be underrated. The taste; however, was spot on. I can only imagine what a fresh, well -kept bottle or pint would taste like. Still, an awesome experience!"
""

"O: I will be sad as hell to move away from florida.. COME TO NC CIgar City!!! Great beer, and visit the tap room if you are in or near Tampa!"
""
""
""
""
"Wow, this is a really good IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very murky grapefruit color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is initially malty, quickly followed by citrus and tropical fruits. Lovely hop aromas with some nice pine and pineapple. A bit of melon with some grapefruit as well. Taste is bitter hops at first, which fades to tropical fruits (mango, pineapple, guava) and citrus (grapefruit, orange, lemon). Quite complex flavors here. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a fantastic IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not sure if this was the freshest bottle but it was still really enjoyable. Definitely a quality beer that I would be happy to have again - I enjoyed the flavors."
"Pours a hazy, copper color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, slight yeast, hint of dough, slight floral, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of floral hops, slight alcohol, sweet malt, hint of citrus, and a hint of caramel malt. The mouth feel is great for a strong IPA. The hops are bold, but there is enough malt and citrus to balance the flavor and not let the hops become overpowering. Great appearance, aroma, good body, and blend."

"Taste is quite fruity as well. Tangerines and pineapples. Once again, a touch of pine. A nice malt backbone to support the hops. Bitter, but not overly so. Juicy, and refreshing. Medium bodied and somewhat low carbonation. Incredibly smooth and crisp.Just how i like my IPAs."

"O: I enjoyed it, but it wasn't the best IPA or anything like that (in fact, I wouldn't consider this top 20 or 30 IPAs I have had so far)."
"If you like your hops, this one is for you. I found it unbalanced and just too much... on second thought (and subsequent encounters), it's actually pretty great."
""
""
"Overall, this is a really good beer, but it's not distributed in my state, so I probably won't seek it out. There are many Michigan beers that surpass it as well."
""
""
"O - An interesting IPA from cigar city. It seems to have an interesting flavor profile that seems to add in some oak and more barnyard flavors then mixed in than I like or am used to in my IPAs"
""
""
""
"On tap. ¬Ω Pint glass. Enjoyed on jan¬¥12. Amber color, crystal clear appearance. White in color, rocky froth. Sweet malts & tropical fruits, resins & floral hops to the nose. Dry bitter flavor, slightly fruity with malty hues. Voluptuos palate. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Citric finish & fruity aftertaste. Refreshing, but quite fat drinkability."

"Good stuff, a top notch IPA that's easy to drink."
"O- I am enjoying this IPA, I am writing it as I am sipping on it. It is not blowing me away but I am really glad that I got to try it. I am wondering if I have a slightly older bottle (I can't see any dating on it) due to the maltier-than usual character and lack of smell/aroma/bouquet. I'll revisit this again at some point!"
""
""
"O - Overall this was a surprisingly good IPA. This must be a fresh bottle because the citrus really pops. Quite delicious really."
"Overall this is a very solid year round IPA. It's a beer I've had before on vacation and will continue to purchase when I can."
"Fantastic. So Tasty. The smell is great - candied grapefruit and peachy/tropical fruit and floral something. Wonderfully pungent. Taste follows suit and isn't particularly bitter. Enough to not be round but not so much as to be distracting. This goes on my long term winners list."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not for everyone, but I can see how a fan of (imperial IPAs with strong hops would like this. I like it too, but it can't compete with something like Dogfish Head 90min."
"O-this is a great go to IPA. Not to bitter but nice enjoyable beer at a reasonable price. Nothing exceptional but very good all the time."
""
"Pours a nice clear dark golden with a decent off-white head. Aroma is strongly hoppy with an undertone of grapefruit and a hint of orange. Hoppy flavor has grapefruit and fresh-cut pine wood tones, not overly bitter, and a hint of Mandarin orange. Lively texture has firm body and good fizz. A good, if not outstanding, IPA, worth a try if you like this style."

"Damn this is one delicious IPA. Sweet, creamy malt profile, solid bitterness and delicious floral and tropical flavor bursting through the whole beer. Easily one of the best I've had in recent memory. Another home run from Cigar City."
"Overall: For a IPA this is great. There could easily be more with this; a bit more in the grain bill and some extra hops would make a great double out of this"

"In all, this is a decent IPA. A bit unique with its fruity notes, which differ from some other IPAs."

"Update: 7/5/12, thank God I live in Tampa and can spend time in the CCB tasteing room. I have sampled over 25 IPA's since this review and still can't find one that compares. Great IPA!"
""
""
"O - This beer definitely attacks the senses. The tropical aroma was wonderful, while the bitter pine kind of caught me off guard on the taste. I expected the tropical and citrus to continue in the flavor."
""
""
""
"D ~ A very good IPA that is better closer to room temp. Thanks Pops!"
"Drink- It's a good IPA. Nice flavors develop and envelop and it's a quick drinking beer. Has a very refreshing combo of the pine/citrus."
""
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is both smooth and creamy. The body never becomes sticky or coating and rolls over the tongue easily. The carbonation is a bit fizzy but must be doing wonders to support the body so well. The swallow is crisp and satisfying while the finish is juicy."

""

""
""
""

"Overall - A wonderful IPA here, great balance."
"O - Unique, in a word. I haven't had an IPA with such a sweet hop profile before. Citrus-type hop flavors exist in their sweetest forms, paired with sweet caramel. Very taste, and beautiful to look at. The aroma doesn't live up to the taste, nor does the feel. Overall it is a wonderful and slightly niche take on a classic style."
""
""
"Orange amber color with a decent white head... Pleasantly aromatic, big grapefruit notes.Taste of tropical fruit, hops, pine and floral notes. mouthfeel is medium in body with a nice lingering bitter finish. This was my first experience with Cigar City and a good one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours medium amber with full foam that settles down. Lots of lacing. Grapefruit smell. Some grassy notes too. Strong bitter hop with a malty background. Toffee/caramel swirls in the background. Some lingering bitter. Well made IPA."
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty tasty beer. A good one for sure."
"This is a very tasty and nicely balanced beer. Although it's more hoppy than malty. Get it fresh when you can."
""
""
""
""
"O: Thank you, Cigar City for gracing my state with your beautiful presence."
""
""
""
""
""
"Resiny hop bitterness in the taste, lingering long into the finish. Leafy green, pine and herbals, some pale malt in the middle. Fairly rough hewn and straightforward. Medium body and carbonation levels. Overall a good IPA, sort of middle of the road."
""
""
""
"O: Good, but not great. I was fortunate to come across a bottle of this and would try it again, but not hunt it down. It does satisfy my hop-thirst!"
""
"O- The Jai Lai is a great IPA. A lot of times IPAs are too bitter, but this IPA had exactly the nice balance between hops and sweetness. Definitely a good IPA, probably one of my top 10s. I love the nice sweet fruity flavor that blends with the hops."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied but very smooth."
""
""
"Overall: This is a delicious, drinkable IPA that is very hard to just sip. Please come to VA Cigar City."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had this beer which is as of the review unavailable in my home state of CT about five times now... consistently Jai Lai has delivered... this is among the cream of the crop as far as east coast ipa goes! I am greeted by cloudy glowing orange brew a light lacing resting on the edges of my glass. Earthy and Fruity on the nose the beer is a mouthful of grapefruit candy that finishes with great focus... The finish is what makes this beer... dry and hoppy your left with an uplifting foresty & piney goodbye."
""
""
"Overall is outstanding. Very high drinkability. ABV is not really evident, drinks like a 6% IPA. Wish this were local, I love this beer!"
""
""
"Overall, I really enjoy this one. There's a lot going on with this one. The hops come through big but there's a lot of malt to back it up. There's also enough of a booze presence to indicate that this is getting close to imperial territory. Really great IPA. If only it was distributed in MN!"
""
""
"O - this is overall quite possibly the most perfect beer i've ever had. i wanted to see if it was mostly just hype (was a little disappointed with pliny the elder), but now i know this beer deserves the recognition."

"Serving: Bottle poured into Bells tulip glass."
"12 ounce bottle dated Dec. 2011 courtesy of markwise poured into a pint glass. Opaque bronze color with a sticky tan head. Smell is rich in malt and hops alike, with gobs of caramel weighing down a piney citric hoppiness. Flavor is along the lines of your typical ‚Äôbalanced‚Äô IPA, plenty of crystal and caramel malt notes with a complementary hop profile instead of a showcase. Nice big bitterness in the finish, with a chewy mouthfeel that dries out well. A perfectly adequate IPA but I‚Äôm left wanting more hops."
"Pours a hazy deep Orange/copper with amber hues and an off-white head. Huge aroma of pine and citrus hops with some sweet malt and caramel. Taste is a citrus hop bomb that has a hint of tropical fruit with a touch of pine and grassy hops coming through in the finish with a touch of sweet malt and caramel. Medium mouth feel with a moderate to strong amount of bitternees and well hidden alcohol. Freakin delicious. This reminds me more of a Double IPA, full flavor."
"O - I'm surprised that I even found this in Virginia, so I was pretty happy to try it regardless of it not being too fresh. Even after being bottled for three months or so, this beer was quite delicious and had a good bit of tropical and citrus fruit aroma/flavor. Even with the moderate presence of bitterness, this was still super drinkable and enjoyable. There's no doubt that if I saw this beer around here often, it would be one of my go-to IPA's for sure."
""
"O ‚Äì This was really nice and paired perfectly with the spicy stew I was eating. I would highly recommend this IPA because it was not overpowering just really good."
"Served in a pilsner glass at Bonefish Grill, Plantation, Florida. Pours an orange gold with a thin head. Aroma is passion fruit and sugared grapefruit. Taste is a bit rough - grilled grapefruit skin, no sweetness here. Paired decently enough with my grouper and mango salsa. However, this will not be a go-to IPA for me. Plenty of much better stuff out there."
""
""
""
""
"very nice ipa... be sure and leave about an inch in the bottom of the bottle and swirl vigorously to get all that cloudy goodness @ the bottom... i also like the 7.5abv for it being marketed as only a straight ipa and not an imperial... oh damn... not enough characters... how about now?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper color with no head or lace. Tha aroma is of bread crust and grapefruit. The flavor begins with grapefruit and caramel notes with an overpowering hop bitterness in the finish that's almost medicinal. There's a strong bitter aftertaste long after it's gone. The mouthfeel is medium-light. Cigar City Jai Alai IPA is a so-so beer that fits the style ccriteria. Not recommended."
""
"O - Not my favorite beer ever, but got dayum ... Is love to have this one in tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is probably one of the best East Coast IPAs that I've had. Easy drinking, but it's defiantly a sipper. Great job Cigar City!"
""
""
""
"Overall I thought it was pretty dang good. I acquired a few bottles in a trade, but I can see if I lived in a market that sold Cigar City, this could easily be a ""go-to"" IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I really enjoyed this. It's really easy to drink fast, and as long as you are being careful, I think that's the way to drink it. There were a few little metallic notes that crept in here and there - I think that this would be more pronounced if you were sipping slowly, writing a review for some website. Bottle was shipped from Florida, so that may have affected it. All in all, quite glad I got to try this. Definitely recommended!"
"OVERALL: This is really, really good. One of the better IPAs out there, and it throws a lot of flavor at you while keeping the ABV to a modest 7.5%. Could have the flavor profile of a double IPA in that regard. Another quality brew for Cigar City, this is definitely one I could drink regularly. Recommended."

"This is a good IPA, but I'd have to put it one or two levels below my favorite go-to IPAs (Founders Centennial and Bells Two-Hearted Ale). Still, I'm glad I had a chance to try this."
""
""
""
"O- Really impressive IPA from Cigar City, the aroma was fantastic, really easy drinkability could drink this one all day."
""
""
"Medium texture in the mouthfeel with a bit of oily hops noticeable and a very smooth feel for an IPA. I almost hate to say it, but if I could get this regularly, it would clearly rival Two Hearted for place in my beer fridge. Highly recommended."
"It has candy notes all over it, not sure where it is coming from. I can see why people dig this one, it is definitely unique among IPAs and tasty to boot."
"Overall, a good balanced IPA that is great for drinking with friends, but still has a good taste to it."
""
""
"O: This is an excellent IPA and very enjoyable. Very solid example of a good balanced IPA."
"O: This was a nice beer, but nothing stood out. The mango pulp body in the nose was different than any other IPA I've tasted."

"tastes like it smells, carmel, hops hops and hops, slightly dry finish. I usually go for more floral ipa's but this one is delicious, I love the hint of carmel/malt. Really wish this was readily available anywhere remotely close"
""

""
"o- not bad at all for my first cigar city brew. Big time flavors for this ipa. If you are into the earthy piney scene... this is the brew!"

"In short, a bit indecisive American IPA with hops that seem more European than American in character."
""
""

"Highly recommended!"

""

"poured a classic orange-amber with a respectable head that left some lacing along the sides of my pint glass. nose is extra malty, with molasses, honey, and a bit of a floral apricot/stone fruit quality in there as well. definitely more of an english or east coast approach to the style. hops are pretty well hidden in this ale, with some dryness on the back end. so much maltier than i was thinking i'd get, and that detracts from american style ipa in my book. mouthfeel is creamy and a bit chewy. overall this beer is certainly drinkable, but at almost $11 on the six i'd choose loads of ipas before this one every day."
"Overall a really nice single IPA that falls a bit on the bitter side of balanced."
""
""
"Fantastic tropical fruit flavor with some pine and grapefruit notes with a bit heavier body make this a fantastic IPA...if not a bit different. I'd pick it up regularly if I could."

"O - Terrific IPA. A little lighter than most, in my opinion, but delicious."
""
"I avoided this beer for a while since I'm from Florida and figured no Florida Brewing company could actually brew great beer. I was wrong? This American IPA is one of the best I've ever had. From popping the cap to the last drop, it is one excellent IPA. It will become a regular in my beer refrigerator."

"O: Love it. On the first smell, I wasn't sure i'd like this beer at all because it has literally no hops smell. It's not an aroma hopped beer, but I think they dumped a ton of fresh hops in the boil."

"Overall this is a solid IPA. I would definitely order it again."

""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty decent IPA, overall. I like the mix of sweet and hoppy on the nose, but it doesn't really translate to the flavor. It's a bit too bitter for my tastes and I'd like some more of the malt backbone to show up with the hop characters."

"O/D-Really wanted to try this beer. Happy to have had it. Would love to be able to drink this regularly. Just a very solid IPA. Love the bottle too."
"D: This is an interesting take on an American IPA in the sense that you get some tropical fruit flavors as opposed to the typical orange or grapefruit notes. Yet another solid beer from CCB."
"M: could use more cArbonation. Not easy drinking."
"O - Great IPA, would be in my regular rotation if it was available. Thanks mikesgroove."
"O= This is the second beer I've had from Cigar City and it's another home run. I'm very very impressed with this. One of the most unique IPA's on the market. Really interesting. I feel like Cigar City is really making a unique product that is top notch."
"O- This has to be one of the strangest IPA's I've ever tasted. Belgian yeastiness, sweet tropical fruit, serious hop bitterness, and tai spices. I wasn't crazy about it when I first started drinking it, but it really grew on me and I started craving each sip."
"Cheers..."
"O - This is very interesting beer from CC with more of an herbal nose/flavor than I have had from an IPA. I would have preferred a bit more bitterness, but other than that it is very well-rounded."
"Overall: Strong ipa."
"Good Everyday IPA. Nice inviting aroma of Hops. Nice balance of hops and bitterness. Crafted very well compared to other craft breweries. Slightly Hazy with a light frothy head, Jai Alai is tasty if your only drinking one....or six of them. Cannot wait to Locate some of their other beers."
"12 oz bottle courtesy of MikeLuke23. Thanks Mike. Pours a cloudy light amber with a small light tan head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is light grapefruit, sugar cookie, and a bit of tangerine. Quite sweet. The taste is sweet sugar cookie, caramel, and some light grapefruit. The finish has a strong bitterness. Medium body. Medium-low carbonation. Overall, not that enjoyable. Too sweet. The flavors are in general quite bland with not enough hop presence."
"Overall: Really nice IPA I think the flavor is the only thing keeping it from being a great IPA"
"Pours a clear but slightly hazy orange with a two finger head that sticks around. The aroma is orange and pine. There may be some mango and pineapple coming through as well. The taste is slightly sweet caramel with tons of orange and decent pine. Tropical fruits are also coming through as well. Mouthfeel is creamy and the carbonation is perfect for the style. Overall, a deliciously sessionable IPA that has become my go-to brew. This is a typical east coast balanced IPA and one that I keep coming back to time and time again."
"o: Definitely a first rate IPA, hope I see it on-tap again sometime."
"O: I gotta say, this reminds me a lot of Three Floyd‚Äôs IPAs: Alpha King especially. It‚Äôs mostly about that peppery hop bitterness, which isn‚Äôt my favorite hop taste; however, they pull off these bitters quite well (seriously, this is legendary balance). I really can‚Äôt think of a better dinner beer for Mexican food, seeing as it‚Äôs hoppy, but not too hoppy to make spicy food unbearably intense. At this rate, I‚Äôll be loving their White Oak version ‚Äì and, thanks again to Chris, I have one in my fridge at this very moment! Great‚Ä¶a bit of woody complexity would do wonders for this palate."
"Overall: This is probably the best IPA I've had thus far, and if not the best, it's definitely the most balanced. The flavor really helped me move past the weak nose and allowed me to appreciate the full glory of this beer. I'm already looking forward to the next time I have an opportunity to have some of this beer."
"About a finger‚Äôs worth of off-white foam, not especially frothy and the retention is average at best, the lacing comes in solid sheets but little stickiness. Murky orange-amber in color with more of a brown than red cast, solid glow throughout, not too many bubbles visible. Sweetly hoppy nose of pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus, pineapple, nectarine, apple fruit and flowers, does show a piney resinous to cut grass and herbaceous side, peppery too, powerful lift and staying power. Full-bodied and close to thick, coats the palate and heavy on the tongue. The carbonation has more fluff than prickle but not that strong in either sense. Dry on the whole, the orange, lemon, grapefruit citrus dominant yet without sweetness. More biscuit, bread here with a touch of honey. The florality very pretty and spreads through the finish. More bite than juice in the peach, apricot, nectarine fruit, falls short of tropical. Very consistent presentation and very good balance, perhaps not that complex but easy to enjoy and doesn‚Äôt unnecessarily seek to push the envelope."
"Overall: A good east coast IPA. Not as hoppy as I prefer and a bit too much malt profile."
"Thank you miamichael2 for the trade!"
"A solid east coast IPA."
"Medium body with a round, vinous mouthfeel. Delicious and satisfying. A big, well crafted IPA. Thanks to 1stbiermeister for the bottle."
"O- Not bad, but I remember my previous bottles as being better. Maybe i'm more analytical when I taste to review, but its just not quite as complex and having a layered hop profile as I remember."
"Overall: What a great IPA! A great hop smell and taste. An all around terrific IPA. A regular in my household. CHEERS!"
"O- While I must say I've been slightly disappointed by other east coast IPAs, this one really shines. I'm not really much of a malt lover (as I prefer the west coast hop-bomb), but this is a great beer. Glad I went for the 6 pack."
"Cheers Cigar City."
"Overall I stick with the fact that this is the best IPA I can get readily at a good price and will keep giving cigar city my money."
"O: Can't say anything bad about this beer. I think I have a problem, I am way to spoiled when it comes to tasting the best beers in the world. Right now this beer tastes average because I am thinking of the white oak version (OMG!) or tocobaga which is as hoppy as most IPAs. For what it is, Jai Alai is spot on for a typical IPA, should be the up and coming benchmark for what a balanced hoppy pale ale taste like."
"O: This was bottled on Aug 20th so it's reasonably fresh. Disappointing though. I didn't like the flavours provided by the hops. 3.5"
"O - Not quite an IPA, but by far the best Mango IPA I've ever had, this revitalizes my thoughts on Mango... There's only one thing ""off", can't quite put my finger on it...So, it gets a ""4" overall. Nice work CCB!"
"This beer pours a slightly hazy beautiful orange color with thick ivory head that leaves a large amount of lacing to the glass and retains well. The aroma is strong with caramel malt and some earthy hops. The taste is similar with the caramel malt notes being up front and a slightly piney hop finish... Could be a little more hoppiness to the flavor/aroma. The mouthfeel is very smooth and clean finishing. Overall a great IPA."
"O: Well done, looking forward to having the white oak next."
"O: beautiful interplay of hops and malts. A must try."
"Overall: I like Jai Alai a lot. If I could get it up here in the Pacific Northwest, I'd have it all the time."
"This is excellent IPA that should certainly appeal to IPA lovers who enjoy a well-hopped, complex beer. Highly recommended."
"O- This beer is a great IPA that really impresses me. I am a little burnt out on IPA's right now, but I would drink this again frequently, but not in large volume. Even if this wasn't local, I would still be as thrilled with this beer."
"O: I really like the smell, but the beer is a bit more bitter and less flavorful than I'd like. Overall, a pretty solid IPA, though."
"was this as good as i hoped? hm....not really. it's good but didn't have nearly as much hop character as i expceted. i definitely need to get a fresher bottle of this stuff."
"Ok, i think i need to find a fresher bottle as this was quite malty but still quite pungent."
"O - Thought it was a great IPA, with a lower bitterness than most styles in this class. Felt it was a unique IPA with more of a malt presence. Found the beer challenging to evaluate, but don't let that fool you, it was a great beer!"
"Very drinkable IPA, but not especially stands out about it to push it over the top. I'll definitely drink it again if it comes my way, but won't go out of the way to get it."
"I suspect they've used some Sorachi-hops in this one as that's what i usually associate with coconut. A very drinkable ipa but nothing i could drink all night. 750ml was no problem tho. Quite nice!"
"Overall - Lots of DIPA qualities in this beer. It has a lot of sugary sweet pineapple flavour and some nice hop bitterness. I definitely couldn't drink this all night long, but I would love to have a few on hand for throughout the week."
"O- this beer has some hype and for me it doesnt live up to it. That being said, i like my ipa's more towards the citrus side, and this is piney. I do get citrus in the nose but not in the taste and for some reason the alcohol is slightly off-putting in this beer. I usually dont mind it, but it just doesnt seem to work for me here. Still def above avg, and something i will try again, but being from upstate ny, not something i will try hard to seek out ""B-/B"""
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I would love to try it again."
"Overall - A good IPA, and certainly one of the more balanced IPAs that I prefer. Certainly glad to have tried this. Thanks so much to coreyfmcdonald for this as an extra in our recent trade!"
"good beer given by a buddy with a florida friend."
"Overall Impression- Once again, CCB has REAL beer! Awesome aromas from the start and then a good hoppy but not too strong IPA. I would even recommend this for the non-hop heads out there because the alcohol warming keeps it smooth and easier to drink. Love this Brewery! Move me to FL and I'm keeping anything from this brewery in my bridge."
"One is greeted by a hazy orange/copper body resting beneath a voluptuous white head that dissipates a little too quickly, but leaves ample sticky lacing in its place. Smells of piney hops, flowers, rich citrus, and some faint dark fruits in front of an even fainter malt background. Taste begins with a hop assault but quickly mellows into a smooth caramel flavor rounded out by loads of citrus (grapefruit, orange, and lots of lemon). A oaky, wood flavor also makes itself known throughout the drink. Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp, and finishes very well. Overall, an excellent IPA that I will gladly seek out again in the future."
"Overall: A nice IPA. Not the best out there but very smooth and drinkable. Decent amount of flavor complexity."
"Overall: This IPA was great. I do wish I could purchase it at will."
"O: Too malty for an IPA, although some may like it. It‚Äôs got a decent hop presence but it‚Äôs not remarkable and doesn‚Äôt make me want more. Too much caramel malt. Not balanced enough for me for the style, and not my kind of IPA aroma or taste. 3"
"Poured an attractive dark copper color with a head that hung around for quite a while. Aroma was of caramel, tobacco, and hops. Flavor was dominated by caramel malt and hops were not as dominant as I would have liked. Mouthfeel was good and overall this was an easy-drinking beer. Good, but I would not rush out to get it."
"O: A nice IPA. I enjoyed it. Would recommend."
"Cigar City can lay claim to a damn fine I.P.A. Impressive hop character, balance, and drinkability."
"Overall, this is an excellent IPA and I must say that even though I'm not a big fan of this style this is a must-drink for all the beer lovers out there."
"O: Extremely drinkable and refreshing brew that accompanies spicy food quite well. Will definitely have more of these now that CCB is becoming available in Georgia!"
"Im glad this finally got to my area of georgia and its joining sweetwater as my favorite local IPAs"
"Overall an enjoyable hop forward IPA."
"I tried to decode the ‚Äúlabel date‚Äù as noted above. My online resources state that CCB does not use a bottling code but this sure looks like 04/23/2011 to me. Who knows."
"o- A bit more carbonated than I like my IPAs, but it's hard to hold that against what's an exceptional beer from Cigar City."
"It's like a big hoppy IPA with the malt bill of a DIPA. Either amp up the hops or town down the malt."
"A long-time want and a pretty darned good IPA overall, although more caramel malt than I generally care for in the style."
"Pours a slightly hazy deep amber color that would have been clear had I stopped the pour a nano second earlier. Frothy white head slowly dissipates to a cap and leaves moderate lacing in its wake. Smells yeasty, earthy and citrusy, pine and resin mixed with a fair amount of caramel. Taste is sweet caramel malt up front followed by an earthy piney resinous taste. Hints of citrus follow then a fairly dry finish that leaves a bitter hop bite on the palette. Medium body and carbonation level with a resinous bitter mouthfeel. I liked this one, but nothing about it knocked my socks off. I really wanted more hops in here. I got this bottle in trade and with no bottle dating I have no idea how fresh this sample is. Maybe one day I will get to try a version at the source."
"O- This is a very solid IPA. I really enjoyed this one. Thanks again Steve."
"O- Overall not too bad, but was expecting some more hops from this. I'm going to assume its an old bottle or has seen better days. Will definately give it another try in the future however."
"An excellent IPA, and one that grows on me the longer I drink it. In fact, I drank through 2 six packs before reviewing one, because for me it was hard to nail down the flavors here, as they were changeable and fleeting, but oh so tasty. A nice pour, orange amber with a head that sticks around and leaves some lacing. Very citrusy with a nice bitterness throughout, but it's hard to place the particular citrus flavors and aromas. A bit of orange, grapefruit, and tangerine, and some carambola comes through for me as well. A veritable fruit salad here. There is a touch of woodiness and a little bit of a sour zing, but it all seems to belong. The malt is very well integrated and merely provides a sweet counterpoint to the fruit notes. Very smooth, and not chewy at all. At the finish there are some additional light notes of coconut that help add a little creaminess to the bitter undercurrent and fruity topnotes. A very nice package indeed- a great IPA/"
"I had an IPA from 512 from Texas that was legit. This one is not and I wasn't expecting it to be. The best IPAs are from my backyard, I was hoping for something more unique in this trade but was a bit let down."
"Great IPA must try!!!"
"O- Certainly an upper tier IPA and likely top 5 I've ever had. I'd certainly seek this out. Ranks up with Victory HopDevil, Bells Two-Hearted, Southern Tier IPA, Great Divide Titan and Bear Republic Racer 5 on my list!"
"Mouthfeel is light to medium, bubbly and a little rough around the edges. Overall this is a great everyday drinker that improves even more in the brewery's aged versions."
"O: Aside from the bizarre smell and endtaste, it's a good IPA. I'll drink another couple to be sure I didn't get an off batch -- maybe the date-stamp is a best by. Not really recommended."
"A bit of an alcohol burn up front detracts from the mouthfeel, but only a little. Overall a top notch IPA. I wish I was driving on this trip because I would love to bring a case of this home with me."
"So I'm not an IPA guy in general, but this one is pretty darn good for a single IPA. Bought this 6pk for a party and would happily purchase it again for myself in the future."
"O: Not as hoppy as I'd like but nice and balanced, leaning towards the sweet side."
"Excellent IPA, especially if you like them citrus driven. Coming from Florida, what else would you expect from Cigar City."
"Overall it was a nice tropical tasting IPA. Very refreshing. Tough to not hold the hype train against it but I was very pleased with this beer and wish I had more"
"Overall: I really enjoyed Jai Alai. Very well balanced, while having one of the most unique hop and malt-derived IPA flavor profile out of most any of the ones I've tried. I'll definitely be getting my hands on some of this again when I'm in the Southeast."
"O- Good stuff, unique for sure. Don't think I've had an IPA that tastes like this one."
"D - A great beer, could drink a ton of this any given night."
"D: Very drinkable and an enjoyable IPA, however, it's a little disappointing. ¬†I really expected a bit more from CC based on the other beers that I've had from them, but maybe IPA aren't their thing. ¬†I've got a couple bottles of the oak-aged version, so hopefully that will add a bit of the complexity that I think this one is lacking. ¬†"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy deep orangey color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention and some very good lacing. Aroma consists of citrus notes with loads of floral hoppy notes and a sweet malt base. Taste is a very nice mix between aromatic and floral hops with balanced bitterness and some citrus notes. Malt base is maybe a tad too sweet for my taste though very solid with no watery notes. Boyd is full with limited filtration and great carbonation. Very well brewed and something I could drink on a regular basis."
"I'm glad I got to give this a shot. It was my first CC beer and I'm curious to try some more. I wouldn't mind trying this again, but I won't be seeking it out."
"O: Not the hugest fan of some of the variations of this beer, but this base version is actually decent."
"Pours a reddish gold with a big persistent rocky head. Smell is a great combination of hops and sweetness. Honey and lemons with some great floral notes from the hops as well. Taste has just a bit of sweetness up front followed immediately by a hit of intense bitterness. Herbal and floral notes develop through the middle. Finishes with a very pleasant grapefruit bitterness that lingers for a while in the aftertaste. Very unique- would be immediately recognizable. Medium to full bodied and well carbonated. Overall a really great IPA."
"2014 NOTE: Had this out of the can and it was just as tasty and a damn good IPA."
"O- I was a bit worried after my initial smell on this one, but the taste more than made up for it. One of the better IPAs I've had. I wonder if a fresher bottle would be less malt-forward?"
"I've drunk a lot of this but it's my first review of it. Luminous golden amber in color and produces a thick, high, rocky head that sticks to my snifter as it falls. Getting a lot of yeasty malt and caramel sweetness in the nose. Sweet forward with the hops coming through in the middle. A bit bubble gummy in the middle, with something strangely like a Belgian character just before the hops rush in toward a dry, bitter finish. Good carbonation and a slightly resiny, drinkable mouthfeel. I realize now that I've been drinking much more hop forward beers lately and this is more complex and a bit sweeter than I remember it being. Nice to know this is from my neck of the woods. Good."
"O - very strange experience i will definitely be re-reviewing this one as i feel like something was off with this batch or something happened to the bottle. i expected more in the aroma and much more sharp charaters in the taste."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. A very solid IPA for what it is, but I'm not sure I'd actively seek it out. If I had it available near me, it would definitely be on my rotation, but as I had to smuggle it in my suitcase after visiting Manhattan, I'm not sure I couldn't find something comparable local to me without the hassle. Convenience obviously isn't going to affect the score, just something I thought I'd mention."
"Overall Jai Alai is one of the best IPA I have ever had the pleasure to drink out of a bottle."
"O: I actually love this beer. I could crush this all day long. The flavors definitely come more from the malt than the hops, but the hops season the flavors in such a way that it's a trip. Unusual sweet chili and tan fruit notes. I love the places that this beer is going, especially with light bodied (but still carbonated) IPA. This is getting all the flavor I need in an IPA, with some interesting contrast -- PLUS a refreshing drinking experience. I'd grab this on a hot day real quick, too bad I don't have steady access!"
"O: Impressive for a single IPA, good character and flavor packed within. Not the typical flavor profile or mouthfeel I seek in an IPA, especially not a single, but I appreciate it for what it is. Worth trying if you have the chance but I can't recommend going out of your way to try it."
"Overall: This is a huge IPA. Lots of flavor and nice complexity. Great balance between the malt and hops. I am a fan of this beer for sure!"
"Poured an amber color w/ a nice thick head that becomes thin but lasts. I'm picking up a fruity musty aroma at first whiff. Apricots and sweet grapefruit come to mind along with caramel and malty notes. There is a nice hop bitterness up front with caramel malt taste in the middle that almost reminds me of a marzen (crazy). It ends with some tropical fruit and earthy tones with tobacco and pine at the very end. Tobacco lingers on my palate for a good while after the last sip of this beer. Perfect balance in my opinion and the fact I can't buy this in my state makes it taste even better. This is a great beer to add to any ipa lovers lineup."
"O: This beer might be too big and bold for someone that prefers standard IPAs. It fits the characteristics more to that of a DIPA. With that said, I wish this was available to me on a daily basis. CCB knows how to make a fine brew."
"The mouthfeel is a touch on the rough side with an aggressive bitterness pair with a firm carbonation. I'm all for a hop bite but this Jai Alai gets almost acidic with it's IBU's. But who cares about such a minor inconvenience when you have such a great flavor profile. This is an outstanding IPA and it makes me sad that it's not distributed everywhere."
"O: This is one of the best IPAs I've tried in awhile."
"Stupidly I drank this after the Oak Aged version. What a dumb dumb. While this beer doesn't fail, it fails in comparison to that version. This is a very solid offering nonetheless."
"A well above average IPA, a treat after some recent disappointments. Seek it out, especially in Florida."
"A very well balanced, tasty, though somewhat unaromatic IPA. I'm extremely grateful I got an opportunity to try this."
"MF- Nice full body. Very creamy actually. Seems to just float on the tongue and a hop flavor that seems to last forever."
"I was really looking forward to this one and while it was pretty good it didn‚Äôt quite live up to my expectations it is still a well above average IPA."
"O- I am really happy that I was able to get a six pack when I was in Florida. This is a solid IPA, a little sweet, but very enjoyable on a hot summer day. I wish they solid it near me."
"loved, loved, loved this beer. wish it was on the shelves in the west coast."
"The ""fastest sport in the world"" is heavy on the palate... in a great way. A medium-full body may not encourage a session of this beer, but it does make for an unexpectedly velvety-textured IPA. All in all, Jai Alai is a good beer, but isn't quite there in my book. I would buy it again (if I didn't have to drive 700 miles to get it), but the last sip doesn't pull me to the fridge for another one, like so many other great IPAs."
"Overall I am more impressed than I was expecting. I can easily see this beer re-emerging again and again with fruit and other additives. Hope the White Oak version waiting to be opened this weekend is just as good, and I hope to try a fruited version on my trip to FL coming up."
"Overall, quite a tasty brew. Wouldn't mind having this on a regular basis."
"AMAZING, MUST TRY!"
"This is a spicy herbal treat. I like the leafy greenness of he hops. Good malt bill as well. Alcohol shows up a tad but is mostly covered by the hops. This packs a punch with the hops."
"O - This is a pretty solid IPA. Easy drinking, flavorful and nicely bittered, its quite easy to put down a few of these in a night."
"As my first intro to this brewery I am excited to get through the rest of my box and hopefully many more in the future. Nicely done!"
"This pours very cloudy dark orange and has nice fluffy head with good retention and lacing. The smell is citrusy and slightly malty‚Ä¶you can almost smell the tartness. The taste has a unique fruitiness that I have not quite had before. There seems to be a robust tea-like presence in the flavor, and I can detect some peppery hops as well. There is quite a bit of flavor going on here, and the body is medium-heavy. There is a pleasant crispness that allows this beer to finish pretty smooth, just as you expect it to linger and be overly syrupy. I‚Äôm drawn back to this beers unique complexity again and again. One drink begat another, and so on‚Ä¶"
"Overall: Sickly drinkable, such a pleasure! Beautiful flavors and aromas. Sessionable, alcohol is not too noticeable. One of the best IPA's in America."
"Okay I just have to say that I am glad this beer has made it to Alabama and in bottle form. I know it is in keg form also but I have not tried it out of a keg yet. I grabbed a bottle the other day when I got my delivery at the store and love it. I have been drinking Bells Two Hearted and SN Torpedo alot lately. This brew was awesome. The pour was a light golden haze and right away I could smell the hops and grapefruit. The taste was smooth and hops were upfront the finish was full of citrus and grapefruit and then smooth after taste. I love this brew and will be drinking more very soon. My new go too."
"poured from bottle into standard pint glass. lots of wonderful soft head. about two fingers (i was aggressive). pours a beautiful golden haze. nose is all malt, tid bit of hops. taste is malty caramel up front then a solid hop finish. not much citrus in this one. if i had to pin-point, id match some subtle grapefruit. mouthfeel is great, awesome and refreshing. overall, great beer. i would drink it again, and again and again. i would definitely like to try it fresh!"
"o: I'd love having a fridge full of this waiting for me after a long day of work.."
"Overall I'm not so impressed with this. I feel line it doesn't carry the weight I thought it would. This is my first cigar city and I had heard good things but I am let down by this."
"Poured on-tap at the Cigar City Brewing tasting room in Tampa. The beer was served in a pint glass, and it poured a light, yellow-copper coloring with a light, fluffy head. Aromas of fresh fir trees, slight citrus, and fresh cut grass. The beer has a great lacing as you drink. Flavors are light, citrus sweet malt and a heavy foundation of fresh, peppery hops. Very well balanced. The aftertaste is crisp hops and grapefruit, with a dry and bitter finish. Tasty and light!"
"Overall - Slightly above average beer. It is fairly easy and cheap to get where I live so it would be my choice over mainstream beers, but not the best craft IPA I have had. I would have liked to be greeted with stronger citrus notes than I was with this beer."
"When I picked this up at 5 points, I asked one of the guys what it was like and he described it as ""just...good."" That's really what this beer is. I love this."
"Pours a malty-orangish, golden-light-brown (or maybe the light is low in here). Has a real nice egg-shell head on it. The nose is hops, malt. I get big simcoe and pretty big, sweet malt. The taste is big, sugar malt balancing a nice hop flavor. There is a definite simcoe presence (which I firmly believe makes an ipa taste horrible when old), but this beer is evidently fresh. More sweet than hoppy, this really drinks like a lower ABV DIPA. There is a touch of piney-hop flavor that I think brings this beer around and elevates it from an average IPA. Mouthfeel is sugary and thick (for the style) hanging on the tongue. Overall, I actually really enjoy this beer, but when I break it down it sounds less positive than it is. This is a good one and really nice to try next to the cigar box one (5 nose!) and the white oak one. In fact, this beer comes off like it was designed to be put in barrels. Oh well, I like it."
"Overall, a real solid brew. Just wish I could have gotten some fresh. I'll have to be on the lookout for some more later."
"O- This is a Florida IPA that certainly has its roots from the west coast."
"Overall a really great IPA. Glad I finally got a chance to try it."
"Dangerously drinkable for a 7.5% ale. Excellent, but just a hair's breadth from world class. Look for this when you're in the area!"
"Pours a hazy orange color with a big foamy head that left behind some good lacing. It smells of hops with some sugar and malts. The taste is slightly better, there is kind of a weird wood to this but it isn't a bad thing. Mostly citrus and pine hops on the malts. Mouthfeel is fine for the style. This beer is a pretty easy drinker and not bad, but not great."
"Solid IPA..."
"Overall, this beer is really a joy to sip, and a perfect addition to a summer meal. The bitterness is pronounced but not overwhelming, and the extra fruity notes really help Jai Alai stand out from the rest."
"O - Great offering the CC base IPA is pretty delicious and a solid IPA."
"On tap from my kegerator, keg filled days ago, picked up from ccb. Poured into my ccb pint glass, orange amber with a sticky two finger head. Lacing is crazy on this one, beautiful beer. Aroma of citrus, floral hops and tropical fruits, this is a very complex ipa. Taste follows the nose, again this is very complex, it borders on a dipa, very intense. Mouthfeel is moderate, smooth with substance. Overall this is the beer that made me fall in love with craft beer. Match Jai Alai up with any of the super-hyped ipa/dipas and I believe it rises above!"
"overall: awesome. hoppy, fruity, delicious. and alcoholic, oh yes alcoholic. imo, cigar city is the best that florida micros have to offer. get you one, enjoy it. thank me later."
"O - this is a well done IPA. Not my favorite, but it's enjoyable and I'm glad I got to try it.¬†Not extraordinarily complex, but gets the job done to keep IPA lovers happy."
"This reminds me a lot of Burton Baton, but with the hops dialed back a bit. Very good IPA."
"D: CCB has a balanced base of an IPA here. Not getting too complicated in hops taste, and providing a solid backbone. No wonder they do so many different versions of this beer, as it seems to be a great foundation IPA. Bitterness and flavor is all kept in check."
"Overall - CCB does it again. I've had 3 or 4 of their beers so far, and have yet to be disappointed. An excellent IPA that is close to being a DIPA / Imperial... one of my favorites."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy golden amber, with one finger frothy off-white head that retains its lacing throughout. Aroma is of pine, pineapple, grapefruit, and spruce hops, with a bit of caramel malts. Taste is sweet resin from the start; caramel malt is more pronounced here, and the pineapple flavor of the citrus hops really stands out. Nice bitter aftertaste from the hops balances things out. Thin, smooth body with medium to high carbonation. Overall, a solid sessionable IPA."
"Overall though an extremely quaffable GREAT feeling IPA on tap."
"Taste is really bitter and sharp but fruity and smooth, super mellow and creamy with a smooth mouhfeel. It's super tasty dam drinkable."
"Cigar City doesn't distribute in my neck of the woods, so I was pleased to have a chance to sample something from this brewery. A very nicely done American IPA - emphasis on fruity/citrus hops, with a well-moderated bittering throughout and a clean, hoppy finish. A touch of sweetness toward the end is pleasant. Big abv is well integrated with little alchohol evident."
" Overall this might be my favorite IPA! This is one nicely crafted brew.A must try,its just a shame I cant get it were I live."
"D: Very drinkable, this was a great take on the IPA."
"Wonderful"
"Down the middle pour yields a two finger head of dense white foam. The head recedes leaving wispy remnants floating atop a hazy amber body. The nose is sweet biscuity malt and citrus. Taste is orange and mango hoppiness backed up by a very nice pale malt backbone. There is a pleasant bitterness that is well balanced by the malt making this an easy drinking and refreshing IPA. Not over the top bitter like many IPAs that I enjoy immensely, but a very solid take on the style and one I'd have again if it was local. Recommended."
"Pours a dark orange, with some reddish-amber hues. A few fingers of super creamy white head is produced, with some big sticky lace left. The head retention here was particularly unique I found, as this creamy 'mocha'-style head remained, and almost looked like a batter because of how thick and dense it was. Nose has lots of tropical notes, pineapple and mango come to mind initially. Sweet, with some light caramel as well. Taste has more orange and mango, with a nice malt profile to support it. Malt base adds to a great full mouthfeel and a moderate bitterness that's almost fruity in nature; juicy and real tropical fruitiness to be found throughout. Medium to full mouthfeel, a solid but not substantial bitterness and fantastic drinkability for the alcohol. Thank God for the rest of this 6 pack."
"This IPA will knock your socks off! Delicious! One of the best IPAs I've had in awhile. Probably the best since my trip to Minneapolis and Masala Mama several years back. Excellent example of the style. Poured a beatiful coppery/golden hue with great foamy head and retention to the last sip. Aroma gave me chills, as I felt as though I'd been dropped in a pine thicket, or grapefruit grove. Taste is earthy, piney, citrusy, with just a hint of malt sweetness to balance it out. A great beer for hop lovers and hopheads. Definitely one of my go to IPAs for now. Great brew!"
"O - Another great beer from CCB. Fresh, this is a great IPA and a very drinkable one. Can't wait to try more"
"O - Nice balanced IPA, nothing out of place. Hops are a bit muted to make it higher rated IMO."
"Wonderful."
"Overall, a different spin on an IPA, or maybe it is a bit old? The malt has much more presence over the hops but the hop bitterness remains to pack a punch."
"O- Very good. Ive had the beer several times, but it has been a while since I last had it. I had forgotten how much I like it. Much better to me than the cedar version."
"Medium in body with a slightly creamy texture of malt, light carbonation helping the balance. Citrus and tropical notes are well balanced with the malty caramel background. This one leaves me wanting more hop bite but I don't feel it comes across too malty or sweet. Very different from what I expected, more tropical fruit notes than citrusy hop bite. Overall a good beer but my expectations left me a little underwhelmed."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. This is the second time I've had it, and the first must have been from a not so fresh bottle, much more impressed from the tap. I'd definitely have it again. I enjoy the malt sweetness along with the bitter hops."
"O- This beer was a very nice drinker. A good beer that shows a nice balance between sweetness and bitterness. The ABV really doesn't show itself which could be a dangerous thing if you drink this too fast. I would love to get my hands on more of this stuff!"
"O- This IPA impressed me. I wasn't sure what to expect. Not the best tasting IPA but deffinitely in my top 10. I would highly recommend and will look for again. I'm bumping up my overall because this IPA will be good no matter very fresh or aged for some time."
"Overall - Good IPA. Barely this side of a DIPA. If it were a bit hoppier, it could be a DIPA."
"Overall-The right a amount of hops, but this beer would be so much better if some of these bittering hops were pushed into the later stage of the boil, producing a more aromatic and flavorful hop presence with less raw, harsh bitterness."
"Overall: A pretty nice IPA, though too heavy on the malt for my taste. Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing the freshness of this bottle, but it doesn't seem too old."
"The amazing thing about this beer is that it always stays in balance with a lush mouthfeel and the hops always winning out in the flavor battle. CCB has done something few brewers can do, they have crammed all the flavors of an Imperial IPA into their regular bottling. This is without a doubt one of the best IPA's available."
"Jai Alai (said like ""hi lie"") is a game with origins traced back to Basque and was once a big part of florida. This brew pours a deep copper with a medium head of bone color. Lacing is top notch, excellent. Smell is enticing, to say the least, with great attributes being sweet, fruity, spicy HOPPINESS! The taste is clean and fresh with huge floral hoppy notes. Its bitter but the best kind of bitter. I liken it to wasabi(the heat is intense but leaves quick without a trace). Doesn't linger around on the palate like some other well known IPAs. Feel is incredibly smooth, refreshing with a perfect light carbonation. I can't say enough about this beer, easily the best IPA I've had to date. Highly recommended to anyone who likes hops and even those who don't."
"Flavor is big and bold with enough bitterness to really overpower the caramel maltiness. Hop flavor comes throughout with a floral, leafy character. Medium bodied mouthfeel with not enough dryness to accentuate the hops more, but still having a relatively weak malt flavor."
"O - Overall it's a very good IPA. While not the best I've had, the flavors are a little different from the standard citrus-bomb. It's bready, a little sweet, and has a substantial bitterness in the back. Definitely a hop-forward beer, but they managed to balance the malt in as well."
"O: A little too much sweetness IMO for an amazing IPA, but it‚Äôs easily drinkable and very flavorful as well as one you can have a few of in one night. First time having Cigar City, but look forward to trying their other brews."
"like the cedar aged version better but this one is a bit more drinkable version of that."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the sweet inclusions in both the aroma and the taste. While it was clear that the hops were the stars of the show, the supporting cast was beautifully sweet, without going overboard. To make things even better, the source of that flavor seemed to be multifaceted, with fruit and malts all playing their equal roles to give us a unique production."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: The body is just a touch under medium, and the carbonation is very fine. It comes close to syrupy-feeling in the mouth. I'm a fan of IPAs with some substance, so it suits me just fine. Overall, this beer didn't disappoint at all. Very flavorful and one of the more bitter IPAs I've had in a while. I liked it a lot."
"D/O- Overall I loved this one. Going in I knew it was rated as a top tier IPA and it totally lived up to that. Treat this as a special IPA because it is. Cheers to Cigar City and thanks to TATURBO."
"perhaps we were not made for this world."
"Pours medium amber color. It has a nice dense 1 finger head wich leaves sticky lacing down the glass. The beer has a distinct citrus piney hop presence. I'm fortunately missing a lot of the sweetness that a lot of people have noted. Mild caramel backbone with big citrus and piney hops in the forefront. The taste has a bit more of a sweet presence than in the aroma. The hop profile is the same combo of citrus and pine. The beer is a little under-carbonated for my liking and is also a little more body than I would like. Really solid example of an IPA. Happy to get to try this one."
"Drink and overall: Fantastic IPA. I wish I could grab this whenever I want. Once again, thanks Colin!"
"Very easy to see how this beer put Cigar City on the map and I'm fortunate enough to travel/work in Florida frequently enough to get my longing for this beer filled!"
"D: Good. At 7.5% watch out though. A good choice for a sunny day outdoors."
"It was our annual trip to Tampa...the night before THE BUCKEYE CRUISE AGAINST CANCER!!!! The better half and I walked a couple of blocks down from our hotel and found a wonderful spot to taste numerous different brews. The second beer I tried, thank to the suggestion of our server...was Jai alai IPA...WOW. This was quite AWESOME!! The color was a rich cloudy amber. The nose inclued a combination of hops, cirtus, and pine...what else would you expect!. This of course fed into the taste of the beer which was WAIT FOR IT...citrusy....and piny. I could drink this....wait for it....give it to me Lionel...ALL NIGHT LONG!!!!"
"Pairs well with raw oysters on the half shell, cerviche cocktail and stone crab."
"O- Overall a nice IPA, but the West Coast Style has ruined/influenced me too much."
"Overall (Drinkability): Not a bad drinking IPA. Got some good hoppy flavor, but is drinkability balanced. I've had better, sure...but I wouldn't turn this one down if it was offered to me."
"Overall- Good for this style. I prefer traditional American IPA's. Give me my hops! Keep the Malts!"
"Had a 10-oz. draft served in a tulip shaped glass at City Tap House. Poured a hazy-like light orange copper color with nice bright white finger width head. The foam clung to the sides of the glass with each ensuing sip. Smelled nice & hoppy, mostly citrus-like, but not too overwhelming. Tasted great - not too overly bitter, but enough to satisfy just about any hophead. Overall, a pleasant surprise. Had previously never heard of this brewery before, but I'll definitely give this one (and other brews from their lineup) another try."
"This is my first beer from Cigar City Brewing Co. Overall a quality beer. Nothing stands out as exceptional, but it drinks smooth and has a nice finish. Nice color with a surprise slight smokey finish, that may be the oak aged coming through. I would buy this beer again."
"Personal note to myself...this one is a bit out of my tolerance range for bitterness. A great example of the American IPA style, but a bit too assertive for my taste."
"D- Interesting ipa. I usually like mine hoppy but the syrupy malt backbone complimented the citrusy hops very well. Cigar City does some very cool stuff."
"D- Overall this is a really nice IPA. Not ur typical IPA, As added sweetness or different cirtus flavor that most ipa's don't have. Pick this one up and give it a try. I know ill trade for this again."
"D: Nice, drinkable and balanced IPA; it doesn't quite knock your socks off but this is a very solid, well-balanced, extremely drinkable IPA"
"Beer has great texture, but I'm not digging the hops. Average rating, but if the individual parts were configured a bit differently... :)"
"Highly recommended!"
"O- like I said....wow. Way to go, Cigar City. This is an oustanding IPA! I need more, like right now!"
"pours a golden brown with a nice head that retained nicely. Smelled of a good amount of citrus, cedar wood and a light malt backbone. Tastes a bitter hop pine flavor little citrus and slight malt presence. Not as complex as I would like but a solid beer indeed. Medium bodied and decent carbonation, very refreshing and good mouthfeel. Overall, a very good IPA but nothing crazy. I would have liked more tropical fruit and floral presence. But that is just me."
"A unique beer that is ill-served by calling it an IPA. It's more than that."
"O/d- it's a great lite session type of ipa, maybe not an all dayer for most but I'd like to spend a whole day drinking this."
"O: I find this to be a possible faded IPA and will look forward to finding (hopefully) fresher batches. But still a nice average IPA, with a nice hidden ABV."
"Nice beer but the nose is lacking and this beer is probably not the freshest. Would like to revist a freshly drawn pint."
"This beer pours a dark amber, burnt orange in color with a one finger soapy white head. It's mildly cloudy and has constant bubbling from the bottom of the snifter. It smells of dry, sticky, sweet, piny hops, some light citrus and bubblegum. The flavor too is pretty top notch. It features a nice array of piny hops, sweet and sticky malt, and citrus and bubblegum in the aftertaste. It drinks well for the style, is both sweet and bitter but like most IPAs it gives me cotton mouth. This is a really good IPA and very drinkable. I had a few on the beach last week and it was perfect. I'd highly recommend it and I'm glad it's one of their year round releases."
"O- This was a good beer. Easy to drink with a nice taste. I could easily put a few of these back without much thought. Nothing all that overpowering about it, yet the lingering bitterness made me want a palate cleanser after a while, be it food or water. Will gladly have another of these when I see it."
"Overall, glad that I was able to try this one. I had been searching for a while. Big shout outs to Tim and Dan at Pinocchio's for getting this in."
"Really well balanced IPA. I'm not much into hops so I usually have to make an effort to keep these IPA reviews fair, but this one was nice and easy. Still very hoppy, true to IPA style, but just a little bit of malt to soothe my buds a bit."
"First tried this at Dos Caminos in Fort Lauderdale. Amber-orange appearance with a nice white head. Aroma is a very citrusy scent. Taste was fantastic; I occasionally drink a beer that makes me stop and say ""wow", and this was one of them. Incredibly refreshing citrus/grapefruit hop character with a little bit of pine; perfect bitterness. The hops are perfectly balanced with the malt flavors; it avoids pushing over in the hop bomb type of brew. After drinking this in Florida I was incredibly disappointed that we couldn't get it in CT; didn't take me long to make a NY roadtrip to stock my fridge!"
"Drinkability: This brew is definitely a hop bomb, but a tame one at that. Flavours and aromas are very nicely balanced."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a hazed burnt orange with just a really well definded whitemgreat defintion here,it faded slowly into a frothy mass leaving two rings of lace behind as it did.Tropical fruits and some herbal notes in the nose,underlying caramel biscuit.Fresh overripe tropical fruit,some resin,and herbal hops are not in your face they just flow nicely together.There is a bigger sweetish malt base that holds firm to the hops till the end.A very well made IPA with the alcohol being well hidden,I could drink alot of this."
"Overall, I find this to be a unique example of an IPA being that it has a significant malt presence rather than just a punch in the face with hops. Not to say it isn't hoppy because it certainly is."
"Overall : this was a very good beer if you love hops as I do this is a great beer to seek out. I love the orange peel aroma. There is something very unique about this beer!"
"This is just as good as I remembered it being the first time I had it. This beer it a really nice amber color on top of the glass that fades to a golden yellow. The head disappears fast and there really isn't much lacing. The aroma is really hoppy, makes me want to go for a swim in this beer. It's aroma is wonderful. The flavor is aggressively hopped, floral and citrusy. The mouthfeel is medium and begs for you yichang another."
"Overall I just knew the name and now I have a beer to that name. A bountiful hop presence, extremely balanced malt body, and low detectible ABV make this an overall great beer. If I was ever in the Florida area I would snag a case but in the meantime I hope I can someday find a cheap sixer since now it's pretty expensive IPA. Looking forward to more offerings guys! If they can do this well with an IPA I can't wait to see what stouts they offer."
"Verdict: Good beer, but not for the noob to the hop world. A touch overpowering."
"D: Understanding the many varietal beers of Cigar City Brewing involves getting to know the base beers--this being one--that do the heavy lifting in many of the recipes. Jai Alai IPA is an aggressive example of the style, and its standing somewhere between the typical IPA and DIPA is surely by design. Sweetness is cloying early and wherever sweetness appears, so does astringency. This beer is cleanest and most enjoyable in the middle, where some dryness is allowed in while astringency takes a back seat. It reminds the drinker of its immensity and importance with every sip, but it also has the palate-fatiguing potential of a strong ale. While it may not be the best choice for an approachable, everyday IPA, it does suggest at Cigar City's ability to one day brew a big and impressive APA."
"Overall-If there were a beer that was categorized between a IPA and IIPA this is it. This beer is absolutely exceptional. Going by the style, being an IPA and not a double, probably the best beer for the style I've had in 2011. Extremely drinkable."
"Clear, coppery orange with a thick, 2 inch cap of light beige foam. Tons of sticky lace, clumpy, with great head retention. Bubbles of carbonation rose slowly through the beer, making it look viscous. Citrusy sweet aroma, oranges and grapefruit, tangerine, fruity. More earthy, spicy hops notes and caramel sweetness as it warmed. Nice balance for an IPA, plenty of hop flavour (still very citrusy, but with more pine than the aroma) and sturdy bitterness tempered by caramel/crackery malt. Slight pineapple and spicy alcohol towards the finish. Medium bodied, lowish carbonation, nearly creamy in texture with a bit of dryness. Overall, really quite tasty. I'd love to try this on tap."
"O- I would like point out that no where, except on the bottle: ""Pair Jai Alai Oak-Aged India Pale Ale with..."" is there any mention of this beer actually being aged in oak. Cigar City's website mentions nothing, and neither does BA. However, I certainly can detect subtle hints of what can be described as woody and oaky characteristics in this brew. If it isn't oak, then either my palate is off and/or these hops are more complex then I give them credit for. Either way, I really enjoyed this beer and wish it were available in Chicago. I would definitely drink a lot of it."
"O-one of my top ten ipa's. Very well hopped and great anytime I can get it."
"Amber body with a small off white head. Smells kind of fruity, citrusy with something strange that I can't put my nose on. Tastes more citrus with a good amount of bitterness in the finish,not much hop flavor just bitterness. Once again there is just something off about this beer that I just can't name. Mouthfeel is a bit heavier than I would expect with a decent amount of carbonation. I dunno this one just isn't for me. Not as much hop flavor as I'd like. Very strange considering White Oak Jai Alai was one of my favorite IPA's I've had. I'll try this again but wouldn't seek it out."
"D - This a great IPA that I'd love to have over and over. My glass was empty before I knew it and I was left craving more. Solid."
"O: Good beer overall, enjoyable to drink, like the variety of flavors and look foreword to trying more Cigar City Brews"
"Drinkability: A well balanced IPA that highlights the hops well. Unfortunately, won't be getting any more of this in my neck of the woods."
"O (D) - over the course of my glass, it definitely grew on me. pretty tasty. A nice change-of-pace from the normal IPAs I drink. Not my favorite, but it's very good."
"D- Very easy to drink IPA. Very crisp and clean drink. Good beer here and big thanks to Jordan for it!"
"Overall: Loads of flavor and definitely very tasty, but slightly too much orange and sweetness to be a top-rate IPA for me. However, it kinda works really well as a lower abv DIPA."
"O - The drinkability here is great. I could drink this all day long. The flavor is great, and never gets boring. There is a slight oakiness to it that I find great, and the hop presence is perfect. This is my first Cigar City beer, and I look forward to many more. I recommend trying this one."
"O - A highly drinkable IPA. I will buy and drink this one over and over."
"Pours a copper/orange color with a huge off white head. Nice pour. Smells like the usual IPA with plenty of hops and floral notes. Some citrus and malts are also present. Taste is quite bitter. Not much citrus sweetness on the tongue. A very bitter dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and good carbonation. Overall a tasty IPA. I would love to get to sample some of the other Jai Alai that are available."
"D: The drinkability is very high."
"Drinks like a champ. This borders on the line of a DIPA, but is as well balanced as any other IPA I've had. A solid flagship for CCB."
"D- Very drinkable, quite good. Very glad I was able to try this as This is at least a month old b/c it was procurred by a fellow BA down south somewhere, but I wish I had a bottling date."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for its higher ABV. Definitely a little less hop-centric than a lot of IPAs, but I really don't mind that. Certainly a beer that I will go back to!"
"D - A very solid IPA that I would enjoying having in my city. CCB has yet another solid staple in their lineup. Nuff said."
"Drinkability: A good, not great IPA. It seemed very off-putting at first, but becomes better as you drink it. I'd have it again, but this is not the first thing I would go for."
"Nice IPA overall. If I lived in FLA full time this may be my go to IPA. As it is, coming from the NEO region, my options are limitless, and I would much rather have a GLBC Commodore Perry or Fathead's Headhunter."
"Glad to finally see some Cigar City in Alabama. A good beer for sure but not my favorite IPA."
"Bought this at total wine in Fort Myers, Fla. Pours a hazy orange. Smell is of lovely hops and grapefruit. Taste is very hoppy, and you can really pick up the fruitiness of the hops, I'm getting some malt coming through too, mouthfeel is definitely thicker than the IPA's I have tried, syrupy but with some carbonation. I love cigar city's brews and I want to drive up there and take a tour, this brew I could probably drink 3 bottles but the ABV packs a punch, Excellent DIPA"
"Pours cloudy copper with a finger of white head. Aromas are in your face citrus hops. Grapefruit and pine. Flavors follow with a citrusy hop explosion but are balanced out by a perfect amount of caramel malt. Good carbonation, and a sticky residual mouthfeel. This is a solid IPA."
"Gotta love it, strolling through TW and Cigar City catches my eye. Pricey but so far proven. Jai Alai? That's usually rigged, but how do you rig a bottle of brew? it is good or it isn't. On that note, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top this brew has a nice citrus hop note with some arid maltiness. On the pour its a slightly cloudy yellow with a big beige head On the taste this brew is big citrus , starting with a tinge of grapefruit, moving quickly into orange then very quickly into banana then finishes big into a high test licorice . The AC stands out big on the finish but it is very smooth. This is almost like a reverse shot with a chaser, or a pain in the ass with a 151 floater. Extremely unique. Mouthfeel is like silk. I'm drinking this brew at about 62 degrees in a 68 degree climate. Incredible! I see what all the rage is."
"D - A drinkable, cleanly made American IPA, but too one-dimensional with focus on the hops to be a great example."
"Really impressive."
"overall, this is a really good brew. I am thankful I had the chance"
"Seek this one out."
"I think this one may be an acquired taste. I really like the oak aging idea - it definitely shows in the beer. The vanilla-oaken undertones make this beer unique as far as IPAs are concerned. I want to try it on draft."
"I'm not sure what defines Imperial or Double vs. a regular IPA, but to me, this is an IIPA! Similar in character to a 90-Minute. This has become my official vacation beer. I'm excited to try more of their beers soon!"
"D-Very drinkable considering the abv. Would like to try a fresh one and see what it tastes like"
"With lower alcohol and a solid taste, this beer is easily drinkable. I like the Jai Alai a lot, and for now it is probably my favorite Cigar City brew. It's a really hoppy and bitter IPA. You can't really ask for more."
"Pours a hazy orange with a tight fluffy head, has some floating sediment in the body. Smells of sweet citrus and pine resins. Something else coming through, can't put my finger on it. Very resiny, oily, citrus component comes through as a sour bitter grapefruit. Has a touch of sweetness at the end. Leaves my mouth puckered and watering. This is a drinkable 7 1/2 %. My first beer from Cigar City, impressive."
"Good drinkability. Overall a pretty balanced IPA with strong malt and hop flavors. Definitely surprised to see that the ABV is 7.5% because it feels like a beer that you could have a more than a few of. But with an ABV that high it would catch up sooner rather than later."
"Medium body with nice carbonation. Fairly creamy mouthfeel. Quite smooth. Overall a decent ipa."
"D-I have had this before and I was pretty excited about it at the time. I enjoyed it today, but I am almost wondering how fresh this is. The hop flavors are way down from what I remember, and it is unpleasantly hot. The fruit flavors are nice, and the aroma is pretty interesting. I appreciate their deviation from the normal American IPA, but lets get some date codes, and maybe drop the ABV and build some body."
"Pours amber-orange with a pearl white one-finger head. Not much lacing, decent head retention. Big hoppy aroma. Tropical and pine hops dominate, also a bit of floral hops, bready malt and alcohol present in the nose. Taste is what you'd expect from the nose. Big citrus hops, a little sweetness from the tropical fruits mix well with bittering pine hops. A little bready malt sweetness on the back end. Pine hops linger a bit into the aftertaste."
"D-Loved having a homegrown Florida beer that was absolutely delicious, a great tasting beverage that I'll definitely be having again."
"Back to the beer, the Jailai IPA boasts a very well balanced, hoppy nose with an excellent full mouthful, without being too creamy. Hints of hoppy pineyness coupled with citrus and slight orange flavors mingle nicely with caramel malt and a very minimal alcohol flavor(extremely well balanced for its 7.5 ABV profile). Lasting head about 2.5 fingers leaving significant lacing on a pint glass. Very drinkable IPA, can't wait to try more of their offerings."
"Future outlook: Very good beer that doesn't make it here via distribution, so I won't get to have too often..."
"The hop character was less citrusy than I remembered with a bit hit of flowery fruit punch. It's smooth at first and then finishes with peppery grapefruit (ok, there's some citrus). For balance there's a slightly sweet fresh bread malt note. Overall, this a great IPA and something a little different than the rest."
"D: Great; flavor has enough to keep you interested, its crisp yet complex, and you'd never guess it was 7.5%. One of the most enjoyable and drinkable American IPA's."
"D - Great IPA from a great brewery. Can't wait to try the other variations."
"Pretty good IPA and Im very glad I have a few more I received in a trade but nothing that I couldnt live with out."
"D- I am abbreviating this as I only opened it about 10 minutes ago and it is GONE..I should have had another in waiting. What a great beer. I am impressed and will have this again soon."
"Would also recommend the cedar aged version."
"I think perhaps I should have let this one sit a bit longer as I just received it today and it must still have been shaken even after 7 hours of sitting. This beer was a tad foamy out of the bottle, but once i let the gas escape it settled down and poured a nice finger of ecru foam on an amber body. It's much darker than most IPAs that are out there. The smell of this beer is pretty good mostly there is some pale and caramel malts backed up by a strong lemon scent. The flavor of this beer has much of the bittering hops in it, but the flavoring hops seem to not be as present, if they were ever there. There is a deal of barley husk/toasted malt and toffee to go with the minor citrus flavor and there is a distinct bitterness to this beer that might even be off putting to some not acclimated to the style. This is still a good beer to drink though perhaps a tad aggressive on the carbonation."
"great all round beer!"
"Between this and the other Jai Alai variations I've had (Humidor Cedar aged and Oak Aged) I'd have to say the Oak Aged is the best (and one of my favorite IPA's) but this original is pretty great too."
"Drinkability is pretty good but I think it needs just a tad more sweetness. Still a great IPA."
"drinkability is good. nice balance, hiding most of its alcohol. i only wished that the flavour had retained some of the depth that was present in the aroma. still, a damn tasty ipa."
"D: A very impressive IPA with West Coast aggessiveness combined with more muscular hoppiness and more caramel in the malt bill. It tastes a lot like PtE Jr. would taste. A top-tier IPA without a doubt and I am glad I had a shot at it this trip."
"Drinkability is high. Light enough and mild enough to knock a few back."
"Overall: Jai Alai IPA is a great brew. It's got a lot of body for an IPA and combines hops and citrus very well. It doesn't have that bitter hops bite that many IPAs produce. I was surprised by the thick head, but it was a nice aspect to the beer. Overall, a good brew!"
"I can't believe how brilliantly clear this beer is, I don't know whether to marvel at how pretty and shiny it is, or to cry over all that lost hop character that is stuck in a bed of DME somewhere; but this last is not really much of a complaint, as the hop character that made it into the beer is aggressive enough to satisfy any hop head. This is a thoroughly enjoyable IPA and the perfect night cap after driving a total of 3 hours on the road and spending 12 hours helping brew a double batch of beer on the CCB pilot system; I am so happily satisfied right now."
"Pours a deep yellow orange color with a thick yellowish white head and a ton of lacing. Smells of piny hops and tons of oranges. Tastes of piny hops, yeast bread, and orange. Mouthfeel is very nice and has a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"Note: This is my first sampling and I am hooked! I rarely see this in NY but I will actively seek it for a nice change of pace from the typical American IPA. Bravo!"
"D: Overall I like it, maybe not as much as I like Sierra Nevada. I think the bitterness is too high for an IPA (i think thats just me). I could enjoy a few of these."
"I like this one"
"Medium in body with a good bit of coronation. Overall, a nice IPA that is more balanced than others and not super bitter."
"I was expecting something more aggressive or assertive. I'm glad, though, that what I got out of Jai Alai IPA was a balanced, well-conceived IPA that highlights the underused, underappreciated grassy & floral hop flavors. I'll buy this again."
"This ale puts its foot on the border of IPA and Impy IPA, a blurring of the lines. Clear copper hue, impressive lacing but coming from a highly hopped beer ... not a surprise. Big hop stink, heavy citric of ruby red grapefruit and tangerines ... faintly catty with some taffy undertones. Hops smack down hard, though some caramel and biscuity flavors from the malt appear; aside from that, it is a full-on palate bashing of citric, earthy pine, tobacco and wild herbs with a tropical fruitiness to compliment. Seriously epic beer, we can only hope a pint of it is waiting for us at the gates of hop heaven."
"d - A pretty good IPA with some nice citrus. Would have again."
"D- a very decent IPA I still think the Bell's hopslam is one of the best and the nugget nectar but this is a nice top 5 IPA for me. i would do a sixer."
"Taste of a very well rounded India Pale Ale. Not overly bitter and not overly sweet. A lot of the IPAs out right now have a little too lopsided of flavors on the hop side ; this is not in that category. Bits of grapefruit mixed with toasted sugars. Everything that I like in a barleywine only at a lower level. This is a great IPA. Medium bodied and light to medium carbonation levels make this very drinkable. A great IPA that tastes remarkably fresh considering it had to make a trip up the east coast to get here."
"Drinkability: I could have several of these, if CCB distributed to Utah."
"D: The alcohol is masked nicely, very refreshing."
"The mouthfeel is probably a little bit too thick (perhaps due to the relatively high IPA,) but is otherwise good. The drinkability also suffers just a little bit due to the thickness and sticky aftertaste, but is otherwise pretty good. This is a great and unique IPA that's worth seeking out, especially for fans of the style looking for something a bit different."
"I found it utterly more-ish...I could drink these very regularly; the missus said it was very good but she wasn't really overwhelmed by its flavor. Reminds me of a really hoppy west coast IPA, but with particularly juicy tropical-fruit flavored hop varieties. I would definitely recommend it and would like to see more from Cigar City."
"A friends Uncle Bob shipped it from Tampa. Pours a copper orange with a white 3 inch sticky head. Very cloudy in my 13 oz tulip glass,with awesome lacing that sticks around the whole time. Smell is nice, but fairly mellow for a IPA with 7.5ABV. Some citrus and piney hops. The taste is wonderful oranges, pineapple, and pine. Not overwhelming but bitter. Plenty off carbonationand great mouthfeel for a IPA, one of the best I have had. I think this a wonderful IPA. So glad to have a beer from Florida. Wish I had more."
"Feels more like a double with a mosh between west coast aggression and east coast balance that works well. A nice, slightly different IPA."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter a nice orangy copper color with ample offwhite head that laced nicely. Smell is of pine with some citrusy grapefruit background. Taste is citrusy with some caramel malt notes. Good smooth, medium bodied feel with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall a great IPA that has quickly become one of my new favorites."
"D: Very drinkable (dangerous for the abv). I had no problem finishing the glass and would gladly have more. Overall, a very refreshing and well balanced IPA that does not bitterly stress the palate and at the same time does not sacrifice much in terms of a dominant hop profile to achieve its drinkable means. I'll be picking up more 6 packs guaranteed."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an excellent malt scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and Carapils malts. The hop character is good. It has a mildly aggressive citrus hop aroma that's spicy, yet compliments the malt bill. The taste is good as well. It has a nice bitter hop punch up front along with a well balanced malt profile. It's an east coast IPA with west coast hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good IPA. It's full flavored featuring both an excellent malt and hop character."
"Drinkability: I think that is has good drinkability. I am getting into IPS's, so for me a little too bitter, but I think that it was really well made and would recommend to those that like this style."
"Personally, not the best IPA I have ever had, but it's up there for sure. It's a nice change from the citrus/grapefruit IPA's that seem to dominate the American scene. This beer is very well done, and would buy another pack in a heartbeat...if I could friggen get it in NC."
"D- This is a pretty good IPA overall. I've been trying to get ahold of it for awhile and while its good-it doesn't quite live up to my expectations-but I would still like to have this again(maybe super fresh and stright out of florida?)-luckily I have two bottles of it."
"Medium-bodied and smooth, this is a pleasant drink. I just wish it tasted a little better."
"4s across the board here; while this may not be one of my all-time favorites, it would be a staple in my fridge if only I lived in Florida."
"Nice mango amber color has a sudsy, white head. Very nice fruit aromas mix with passion fruits. Lots of mango and grapefruit mix with citrusy hops in the nose. Taste is smoothe and bitter, passion fruits mix with tangerine, orange and lime. A tad sweeter than some other IPAs, but this brew stays balanced. Another great brew from CC. Not quite Two-Hearted, but a welcome changeup."
"Carmel malts upfront. Sweet and tasty with a little bready chewiness. A good complexities of flavor, but I'm not sure that they work that well together. The sweetness in the beginning is immediately overtaken by a very bitter aftertaste that lingers for a while. Hop feel circles around the back of the jaw. ¬†Overall a decent beer, and I wish I hadn't heard the hype on it beforehand.¬†"
"Pours dark orange and very cloudy. Some citrus and pine and big malt sweetness aromas. Taste was pretty much the same, some faded hop flavor, a little bit of bitterness, sweet malt dominating the beer. Really was hoping for an outstanding beer from Cigar City, and while it wasn't bad, the malts were tasty, it just wasn't as bitter or hoppy as I was hoping for. Ahh well."
"Pours a bit murky and very orange/gold. A bit of head that dissipates quickly. Some nice lacing. Smells a bit sweet and hoppy. Sme citrus and floral flavours coming through. Taste sweet and full. Sme citrus hops and floral flavors. Thicker than a normal ipa but very drinkable"
"D - this was a solid IPA by CCB. I can see how the humidor series sounds appealing for this brew as it has a nice spiciness and earthiness to it that most other IPAs don't have."
"This is a solid IPA with above average drinkability."
"d - drinkable but something seems a little off w/ this one, not one of my favorite AIPAs."
"D- can't go too fast with it, because of the lingering bitterness, but it's really juicy and good"
"It's a solid IPA that I'd rank among the better ones, though not quite the best."
"D: Drinkability is very high. I expected it to be harder to drink then it does. The alcohol feels significantly lower than it is."
"My first from Cigar City did not disappoint despite my high expectations. Recommended for all hop heads."
"D- A sipper. enought intensity here to make it be a slow drinker."
"Overall I couldn't believe that I'd overlooked this beer on so many occasions - a very well done IPA that's fairly well balanced. Worth a shot."
"Update 2/1/11 after having another sixer of this, I am liking it a lot more. Pretty unique."
"Really smooth, moderately complex, and quite well balanced. Good looking, flavorful beer with pleasant texture. But the aroma could be stronger and hoppier. I'd get more of it if I could. Thanks to Iowahawk for gifting it upon me and sharing a bunch of other really impressive stuff (including cedar aged Cigar City) in a tasting!"
"Drinkability: There are several components that seem to dance in a circle here, continually nodding and giving space to one another, yet existing mainly as one. The malt dominates and steps forward but then needs the hop bitterness and spiciness to keep it in check and steps back. Nicely balanced. Full flavored. Oddly compelling in its heavy-handed finesse."
"Drinkability: Amazingly flavorful, almost too much so to drink a lot of it. The drying mouthfeel sensation makes you want more immediately and the non-existent booze flavor present in the nose does not slow you down. I could drink two or three of these maybe, but not a six pack."
"Thanks again DmanGTR!"
"Overall, Jai Alai is a really nice example of a hoppy American IPA. I suspect that this would be a superb beer on tap. This is my first brew from Cigar City and I can tell already that these guys know what they're doing. I'm about to review the cedar aged Jai Alai of theirs to see how it stacks up, but this is already a good beer in my eyes beer in my eyes."
"While IPA's aren't my favorite, this is a really good one. Carbonation is sharp up front, mellowing quickly. A fuller-leaning medium body. All told, a fine brew."
"Jai Alai IPA, 12oz bottle poured in Delirium snifter. Interesting redish amber color with nice solid white foamy head. Head fell quickly but never quite left. Musty hop and carmel malt aroma. Malty, piney hop flavor, slightly bitter carmel finish. Little alcohol presence. Medium bodied and easy drinking. A strong offering."
"M/D - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. As I continue through the drink it actually becomes a little heavy on the tongue. My favorite IPA/ No, not at all. But certainly a worthy contribution to the world of American IPA's and I would be happy to have it again down the road."
"Serving type: Tap"
"I would love to try this again, and I will certainly do so soon, as I am moving to the Tampa area in the near future. I may update this review after that. As it is, though, I found this to be too malt forward, which is not my favorite style of IPA"
"drinkability is good - this was an extra so i dont know the price but i would be game for picking this up if i was in the need for ipa"
"Received this as part of a mixed case. Never been a big fan of IPA but after trying a few other very enjoyable examples I was looking forward to this one. Very unimpressed. Color was of your average IPA, smell was nothing special. First taste was mostly alcohol and overt bitterness (not a good hoppy bitterness either, just sour). Finished with more of the same but some light fruit and pine coming through. After beginning to enjoy IPAs more this one reminded me of what I don't like in an IPA."
"Drinkability: As good as this beer is, I'm not sure that I could have more than 1 or 2 in a sitting. The heaviness and the bit of alcohol warming makes me glad I opened this up on the coldest evening of the year, and I'm definitely thankful to Jon for giving me a chance to try this beer. If I'm somewhere CC distributes, I'll definitely seek this out again."
"D: Drinkable for sure, and makes an impression. A touch run of the mill as IPAs go, but everything is going in the right direction here."
"D: Super easy drinking IPA. One of the better examples that I have had recently. Very easy drinking. Really nice east coast IPA."
"A good drinking IPA but the high ABV is a concern for continued consumption."
"Another sip before wrapping this up, and again, bitter and strong grapefruit.. ""I am an IPA and I PROVE IT"" is what it shouts at you, not sweet, not dry - I am very malty once you start drinking me!"
"D - I'll try it on tap to confirm this tasting, but I won't be buying any more bottles until they put some kind of freshness dating on it. There's no way of telling if this bottle was fresh or not."
"Jai Alai is a solid beer. It is not quite what I desire in an IPA, but I can see why others rate it so highly. This is my first offering from CCB and I'm really happy to have tried it."
"D-A tasty IPA, typical, could drink a few of these"
"D: Pretty good."
"D: very nice"
"This is a solid staple American IPA from Cigar City, with an aggressive, yet well balanced, hop presence and a body that maintains a smooth feel despite the ABV being on the higher side for the style. This was nice but I really need to give this a shot on draft as well."
"Pours a pumpkin golden in my tasting glass with a generous creamy head. Enjoying it with - A Cigar - Hoyo de Monterey Palmas Extra. It holds its own with a cigar, wonderful smell - piney and citrusy - plenty of grapefruit. Lots of mounds in the creamy head, still. Nice hoppy grapefruit tast with some creaminess - not sure if I should call it hop con leche or not, but it is a splendid flavour. Sweet, low on bitterness but the hops keep it toned down. Alcohol seem lower than advertised, but I'll press the I believe button. Mouthfeel is great, I like the creaminess to the texture, I would say medium bodied. Very drinkable but will wait to see what the alcohol does before I pound a few more. I'll try again!"
"D: I have only had one other Cigar City brew beside this one up to this point. They sure have made a great impression so far. Highly drinkable!"
"Drinkability is good and solid."
"I was really excited to try this beer because it is not available in New England. Unfortunately after a lot of hype this beer did not live up to my expectations. The hops were not as in my face as I wanted and the malt notes came through more then I care for in an ipa. Having said all that tho I did enjoy this beer and would drink it again."
"D-honestly, the more you drink it, the better it tastes.this might be my favorite go to beer in the world actually. one thing about this...i always make it my last drink. for some reason when i have it first, it tastes almost mediocre. but if its my last drink of the night, i always find it to be my favorite."
"I think this guy probably wasn't fresh. Normally I wouldn't submit my review given these circumstances, but as I acquired this via trade and I believe this isn't readily available here at my bottle shop, I'm stuck in kind of a tough spot here. I will revisit this brew another time, and if a re-rating is appropriate I will do so."
"Jai Alai is a pretty tasty IPA, especially for beer lovers who really like big fruity hop flavors as opposed to more resinous, bitter-tasting IPAs. I'm also a little bit surprised to see that the ABV is over 7%, so the alcohol is well-disguised."
"D - The cedar/cinnamon flavor I picked up in the taste is bothering me, because I can't exactly pinpoint it, plus it's sticking around. But, the tropical fruityness is keeping me interested and wanting more. Overall this is an unusual ipa, but still a tasty beer."
"Very good, tasty & refreshing. Again, nothing new or unexpected here, just a common style done very well."
"d- awesome beer, proud that it's from my state"
"D - not usually a huge fan of these types of IPA's but this works quite well, I actually enjoy it a bit more than the Cedar-aged version. big bold and hoppy, yet interesting with a wel perceived malt backbone. well done."
"very very nice, and a good example of AIPA. kind of straddles the line between east coast and west coast, and definitely has a Florida vibe to it. dark amber with an off-white head that holds forever and leaves tons of lace. nose is soft-caramel, citrus, flower, pine and a touch of tropical fruit. just like an ipa should be. extremely well-balanced, juicy and delicious, with pine and citrus rind coming through in the finish. just the tiniest hint of alchohol (which is remarkable, considering the 7.5abv) and a very cleansing kind of feel to it. great brewery doing things proper in a relative beer wasteland. can't wait to try the mango grove..."
"D= Really nice beer I really enjoyed it and would like to drink this one again."
"D: This is a different beer, but its definitely good. Easy drinker and solid beer overall."
"D - This is a beer for the hop heads out there its a good tasting hop bomb for sure worth hunting down to try sometime"
"D: All night long. I need more of this IPA."
"If you make your way to FL be sure to pick up this beer. Wish we had in TN!"
"A really pretty hazy cherry wood amber color with moderate head and some nice lacing. Smell is a bit sweet, malt forward, a little weak. Taste is decent, though this is a far more balanced IPA than I was hoping for. Decent piney hop bill on top of a spicy amber malt (and maybe some rye?) bill. Medium body, nice for an IPA, not over-carbonated like so many out there. Good drinkability, not my favorite IPA, but glad to be able to try it."
"Don't be fooled by the 7.50 ABV%! It's there but you won't even notice it and this could easily sneak up on you if you decided to have more than one sitting. I don't do the whole cigar thing but if these guys have the pairing of that with their beers down as well as they crafted this, then they're onto something. Damn shame I can't find more offerings from them up here in the northeast!"
"Drinkability: This is really an all-day kind of IPA, despite the 7.5% ABV; great flavors that are refreshing that accompany a body that isn't going to sit heavy at all -- I would gladly have 3 or 4 of these over the course of any day."
"Got this one from beandip."
"It almost feels like Cigar City brewed this beer just for me. Stop reading this review and go drink some Jai Alai."
"There are so many big and good american IPA's these days and this one is right in the mix."
"overall - solid IPA, but more bitter than I like."
"drinkability: it does kind of taste like a 7.5% beer, but goes down a lot easier than most other beers of the same strength do. I could probably have two maybe three at a sitting before I wanted to switch it up, or was feeling the effects of the 7.5%."
"I've now had this on-tap a few months back and out of a bottle again I haven't found anything bad Cigar City has come out with."
"An excellent IPA. I wish I had access to this on a regular basis. Not the ""best," but would definitely drink the hell out of it."
"I wish I could tell how fresh it was....PUT DATES ON YOUR BOTTLES!!!"
"Pours into a snifter with a half inch white head that does not retain. Smells very caramelly with a bit of a hop presence. Tastes very much like caramel with a bit of pine to it. Very smooth with a bit of an afterbite. Very drinkable when it is warmer outside but not as much during winter. I really enjoy this beer and may be underrating it because i enjoy dipas more than regular ipas but this is a great beer."
"Big malty sweet/bitter hop finish. Very drinkable. I'm not convinced that I tried ""the freshest"" bottle. I'd like to try it again although this bottle was very drinkable and appealing."
"Its a main stay in my fridge now!"
"Pours a moderate copper color. White head that starts a few fingers high and has pretty good retention. Nose is quite hoppy with pine and citrus taking the front. Taste is strong hops along with a light bit of malt in the background. Good dry, resinous mouthfeel with superior drinkability."
"Overall this is an enjoyable beer. I'm not sure it's one of my favorite AIPAs but solid nonetheless. Perhaps with more of a hop nose I'd enjoy ths more."
"Taste, eh, a little thicker than I like ideally in a single ipa, heavy on the caramel, but this is a good beer. Pretty balanced, a higher degree of sweetness than was expected. This is a big, single ipa. . . but not what you might expect, it isn't hugely hopped relative to its malt heft. This is just big all over. Made me think of Eye of the Hawk a little bit, not right on point, but you know, just that level of abv and big all over."
"I had heard nothing but good things about Cigar City. I have to say that the Ja Alai IPA is a disappointment. It's a good but not great beer."
"Drinkability -- Just goes to show it's always worth going back. Cracked another bottle of this and found the second to be much better than the first in regards to carbonation. While I'd still like to see more carbonation in this one, It's pretty damn solid. If your aim is to try all of the best American IPA's this has to be on your list. Period."
"This IPA pours a honey gold in color with a perfect one inch white head with great sticky lacing. Very aromatic, sweet and hoppy with hints of herbal citrus. The taste is sweet from honey, loaded with hop, and has a good citrus bite. This IPA has a medium body a bit syrupy. This is IPA is great, one of my favorites and a great example of what IPAs should be."
"Light amber and clear. Nice head with decent lace and retention. Citrus-floral aroma. Carbonation noticeable up front. The middle brings out the flavors found in the aroma, a bit of citrus, with some floral characteristics. Back of the tounge bitterness on the finish and afterwards. Medium mouthfeel."
"D. It remains dry enough to go down easy, and the balance is right on. Very solid ipa."
"I placed this at the top of the blind IPA tasting that we conducted (ahead of Sculpin, Furious, Red Racer, Two Hearted, Columbus). I'd love to see one of these as an extra in any trade I conduct or in a BIF!"
"The disappointing start gave way to a pretty decent glass."
"D - Wow. As a general non-hoppy beer fan I expected to be trying yet another overly hopped out IPA but was pleasantly surprised to find such a balanced beer. For the hop-heads this one might not be up your alley, but this could be a fantastic cross over beer into hoppy beers since it is so nice and gentle."
"D: Straight foreword IPA. Good, but a bit sweet for my tastes. Thanks again StormKing for this one!"
"D: A surprisingly unimpressive beer from a great brewery. Decent at best: Overly malty and underhopped while being somewhat watery at the same time."
"This was a very good IPA, complex flavor, well balanced and very easy to drink. This is something I will definitely buy again."
"Jai Alai pours with a nice looking, foamy head and moderate lacing. The color is a deep reddish amber, perhaps just a tad more orange-red then your usual IPA fair. The smell is surprisingly sweet, resinous, with the addition of tropical fruits. The taste is strongly grapefruit, however, with the familiar sharp pine tang accompanying the style. Sweet pineapple surfaces briefly in each sip, cutting through the bitterness, and addind considerable more interest to the profile. The carbonation level and heaviness in the mouth are quite suited to this style - easy drinking, with just a hint of weight. All in all, this is definitely a great IPA, and I'm glad to finally have had the opportunity to try something from Cigar City."
"Drinkability: A very solid IPA from Cigar City. I picked up a six pack and probably will pick up many more in the future."
"And the Floridian IPA is born! It's both bitter and sweet. Slightly leaning towards an east coast IPA, but a bunch of bitterness and a touch of hop flavor keeps it from being completely east coast in IPA style. Personally, I enjoy an all out well attenuated bitter hop assault. A little too sweet for me."
"Note: I just looked at their website and I would guess the ""juicy/tropical fruit"" that I am getting is from the Simcoe hops. I had the same flavors in a Simcoe IPA that I brewed, need to get more of those hops."
"A very good beer regardless of it not being my preferred style of IPA."
"Slightly good mouthfeel and above average drinkability (like most IPA's in this reviewers opinion)."
"12oz bottle into a Cigar City Snifter pours a crisp bubbly orange with a nice frothy eggshell head that lasts and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight crisp Earthy hops and subtle sweet malts. The taste is loads of fresh citrus hops in front of a nice sweet malt backbone that leaves a nice lingering bitter finish. The beer is on the light side of medium with smooth carbonation and well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable beer, one I would love to have again."
"I had pretty high hopes for this beer - it was definitely tasty but not one of my favorites."
"D - good drinkability for this very tasty beer."
"D- real tasty hardly cant detect the alcohol here excellent brew a must try! i dont see a single flaw here really a great IPA."
"The beer had a nice medium body feel to it, but perhaps a bit on the heavier side. The beer had very nice carbonation. The beer was very easy to drink and the higher ABV was masked nicely. I wish that I could have taken some home with me as no one in GA sells the stuff. Overall, a fine example of an American IPA."
"D: Very drinkable, a fine beer, just not my favorite."
"Overall: An average IPA. Maybe a bit heavy on the mouthfeel for an IPA. Would definitely try again."
"(29th)"
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into an SA perfect pint glass. The pour is golden honey and a 2 finger white sticky head. The nose is sweet with mangoes, pineapple and citrus. The beer taste better than it smells, tropical fruit blend with grapefruit that finishes with a slight bitterness. Jai Alai has a sticky medium feel to it and is nicely carbonated. Kinda wish I had picked up a sixer of this instead of the single."
"The aroma is malty and hoppy with hops dominating. The hops are citrus and grass. The malt is caramel and a bit of corn. The appearance is beautiful gold amber with a foamy head. The taste is like the aroma with an astringent finish. The palate is smooth and thick for the style. Overall this is a good IPA."
"Received as an extra in a recent trade. I was in the mood for something hoppy so I pulled it out. Poured a hazy amber color, with a medium off-white head. Pretty good hops on the nose, peaches, citrus, pine. On the palate, a little caramel, and plenty of hops keep this one nicely balanced. I enjoyed the cedar aged version, and was quite pleased here as well."
"D - An excellent IPA!"
"D- Very good beer from Florida very tasty well worth another buy."
"(D)- I cannot be positive on the freshness of this one due to no date, but it seems like the woody pine takes center stage over the citrus in this. Good, but a bit one dimensional."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Hennepin globe glass. This beer pours a dark amber peach with a massive 3 inch head that leaves some seriously sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. It's like the lacing creates curtains all the way down the sides of the glass. That's some serious lacing. The aroma is, well, hoppy. There is a slight bit of tropical fruit a bit of pine and just a hint of flowers but nothing to distinctive. More then anything, it just smells medicinally bitter. Almost like hops dusted with aspirin. The flavor is big hops, but once again rather nondescript and still there is that medicinal aspect to it. Citrus hops show bits of tangerine and a little lemon peal. Slight bit of pine, a little caramel and pale malts. Big medicinal bitterness. It really is a bit off putting. I think it kind of drowns out pretty much everything else. The mouthfeel is light with a crisp carbonation. It finished nice and dry, just like I want it to, but unfortunately that medicinal bitterness is just overpowering. Man, I understand there are people who really like that flavor but for me, its just to overpowering."
"Pours a hazy, deep copper color with 1 finger off white head that dissipated rather quickly. Moderate lacing. Aroma of sweet malts, bready yeast and grassy, earthy hops with hints of pineapple. This was brewed about a month ago and the hops have taken a back seat a bit but that just leads to a nice balance overall. This is a pretty ""heavy"" IPA or rather the bitterness has a death grip on my palate. The carbonation is spot on though. Don't think I could have more than one of these in a sitting."
"definitely a sipper, but does not overwhelm the palate. well done. seems like another step forward for big ipas."
"In all, I think I would've liked more bitterness from the hops and a pine or resin character to really drive the beer."
"Living here in Florida you'd think I would have had a chance to try Cigar City beers before now, I just live in the wrong part of Florida apparently. It is a real pleasure to try a world class beer from a Florida brewery (a rarity indeed). Though the bottles carry no freshness information this bottle is as fresh as you could ask for as far as hop flavors go. Excellent beer!"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation. Even with a very noticeable presence of alcohol, there is no problems finishing this off and looking for another. I fully enjoyed the darker offerings from Cigar City and this IPA has me equally impressed. Very well done."
"Overall, a really nice and balanced IPA. Very easy to drink with a pronounced malt backbone. Also highlights some of the sweeter notes of hops. Recommended."
"Drinkability: A beer that does a decent job of displaying the natural beauty of the hop plant. It's good, though maybe I shouldn't have gone from trying the Cedar-aged and Guava versions to trying this."
"D - Very drinkable, would love to try this on tap someday."
"D: I could suck this down all night, it hides its 7.5% well."
"It is not really hoppy enough for me. I would have liked more citrus and less honey. Its not bad though. The pine flavor is pretty strong so I dont know how many of these I would want to drink."
"D: Very easy drinking IPA, will definitely be revisiting this one. Bitter and hoppy, yet sweet and delicate."
"The body if pretty full. Moderate carbonation balances out the heavy mouth. Not sure when this was bottled, but it seemed to me that the hops had faded quite. The malts came forward much more prominently than I remember from the fresh growler I had previously. Bitterness is still present in a good way, but the fresh sharp hop bite that I enjoyed is hidden now. Still a great beer, but it is *much* better fresh. Thanks for another opportunity, Kevin!"
"D - A very quaffable American IPA that hides it's 7.5% ABV extremely well... An excellent aroma, terrifc balance, and luxurious mouthfeel combine to make this a standout offering... While I like hoppy offerings, I typically don't like more than one in a sitting... This Cigar City offering is an exception to that as I could enjoy a couple of these in a sitting and I suggest you do the same..."
"Served from bottle into a COAST imperial pint. Poured a hazy red-yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to minimal quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of malt, sweet hops, citrus, and subtle caramel. The flavor was of intense malt upfront that subsided to allow a subtle hop character to come through that intensified as it sat on the palate, and was ended off with a sweet citrus note upon swallowing. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a very nice and smooth IPA. As stated by Jeff (PDXHops) there was no date on the bottle that I could find to confirm freshness. The hop character of this brew was definitely present, but it was not the star of the show. This was a very nicely balanced IPA however that was quite enjoy to drink with dinner. Definitely worth trying if you get the opportunity. Can't wait to try the Humidor version of this one so I can compare."
"Overall impression: Not particularly memorable, although I have no idea how old the bottle is. Given this mystery, I'm inclined to give it another shot (will update my review with any new developments)."
"D - Exceptional, hands down. I'd love to sample this beauty of an IPA on tap, it must be fabulous. If a bottle can be this good, then in my opinion, the tap is most likely that much better. DEFINITELY worth a try."
"M/D: Smooth with a nice bitter finish. Great carbonation. The alcohol isn't noticeable at all. Extremely easy to drink, only wish I had more of it!"
"Overall: Not your typical IPA that's for sure. Don't expect a hop bomb but do look for some real flavor. I would have preferred a bit more intensity but i still liked it."
"Sk√ÖL!"
"DELICIOUS!"
"D: Goes down easily, mild kick, nice representation of style. I would certainly have a few more of these!"
" D- This beer has big hops but they keep changing throughout each sip. There is a great nose to this beer and it has the flavor to match. The hops are delicious and juicy but there is not a big bitterness to them, making this beer very drinkable. There are hops that support hops and malt that helps tie it together. I think a lot of the great depth of this beer is lost in the cedar aged version."
"We usually drink west coast ipa (green flash), lagunitas ipa, torpedo, rubicon (local brewpub ipa), and pliny. Yes we like hops. But each of these beers has different maltiness and a rotation brings that out."
"Oh man this is good stuff, the alcohol isn't noticeable at all. It's wonderful and smooth and it's the perfect citrus, pine, malt balance I've ever had. I have a feeling this 6er isn't going to last me long."
"This was one of the first CCB beers I really enjoyed. Fairly unique for an AIPA, occasionally reminding me of the chewy bread and caramel malt forward body of an aged Imperial Amber except with fresh citrus hops. Color is a darker and cloudier rust amber with a dark cream colored head that never fades away and leaves ample streaks and webs of lacing. Aroma and flavor are both fairly sweet with strong caramel malt backbone and a resiny citrus hop bite. Body is lighter side of medium with moderate carbonation, thin for the style, but works very well with the strong sweetness in the flavor. Not my favorite IPA, but recommended for not just being another face in the crowd."
"This was an interesting IPA. It mores much cloudier and darker than other IPA's. The color was a golden mahogany with a small off-white head. The remnants of this head stayed throughout the entirety of the glass. Smells really sweet with nuttiness and rich bread. The hops are definitely there, but in a somewhat subdued citrus note. Really fruity with the hops once it hits your mouth. Tastes range from grapefruit to lemon in this department. Then the sweetness hits. You really get a full dose of bready caramel malts on the back-end of this. This is probably the thickest IPA I've had. It really drinks much bigger than a typical IPA...more so than even some DIPA's I've encountered. I really like this beer. It's certainly big for the style, but quite good nonetheless."
"Pours hazy amber with a sticky white head with nice lacing. The aroma is slight but hoppy. The flavor is very strong and citrusy, with apricot, blood orange, and peach. Very intense, sweet and super hoppy. Mouthfeel is strong and the finish is so hoppy I almost has a menthol feel. It is delicious, but a palate killer."
"Overall: Great IPA. I would recommend this to anyone."
"Value: Pricey. Even here in FL I paid around 11 bucks for a sixer."
" absolutely delightful. Very impressed."
"D: This beer would be easy to pound down 6 in one sitting being that it's smooth and simple. Very good example of an IPA."
"definitely easy to drink, even with the slightly elevated ABV. Interesting, I would have again."
"Thanks to Black13 for this sucker. Really great."
"MF: A little more aggressive than I generally like, but awesomely delicious. A new go-to at the bar."
"D: A great flavorful IPA without Harsh Bitterness and muddled flavors. The hops and Malt stand out by themselves."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this beer has everything you would want in an IPA. This is a beer that I could drink for a whole evening without looking for anything else."
"Found this at Willards in Largo, Florida. It shows a pleasant, hazy amber color with a solid off-white head and great lacing. The aroma is sweet orange and grapefruit with pine undercurrents. Very solid. The flavor offers strong grapefruit sweetness and grain malt goodness. Considering the ABV, this is very drinkable. It's got a rye touch that bleeds into wheat and citrus. It's medium bodied with a moderately crisp carbonation feel. It's almost syrupy but not quite, with plenty of citrus sweetness with slightly syrupy breadiness. Plenty drinkable for the ABV. Quite a memorable IPA with very good drinkability! Nice."
"Pours a darker hue than most other IPAs, bordering on a rich, honeyed gold, with plentiful pinpoint bubbles coalescing up to a fluffy, creamy head. Smells sharply herbal without much tropical fruit or citrus. Seems to follow the 'house hop' character of many of Cigar's brews. Note this is in no way a bad thing, but I have noticed a similar hop profile to many of their beers. There seems to be almost a hint of eucalyptus in the aroma. The flavor coincides with the nose and offers up a robust hop profile that leans heavily on the piney, earthy, herbal side as opposed to grapefruity, citrusy, fruity character of say, Lagunitas or Two Hearted. Different and no less delicious. There is also a well measured malt character lending balancing substance without over-stepping to sweetness. A long, lingering, drying bitterness wraps up the package nicely. A tasty surprise on my trip in the south. Cheers."
"Cigar City Jai Alai IPA is a hop-soaked treat that doesn't overwhelm its malt support. In other words, it's right up my alley. Thanks to ktrillionaire for not 1, not 2, not 3... but 4 bottles of this wonderfully delicious Sunshine State elixir."
"D - Drinks more like a DIPA, in my opinion, only without the over-the-top hops flavor (which I like). Makes me wish Cigar City would release a year-round DIPA, to see how it compares to this ""regular"" offering. I'll have to grab the new 110 K + OT to see."
"D - Actually, this is a bit too malty, possibly from age like I said, but still fairly bitter to the finish, Jai Alai is a good first go from Cigar City and makes me excited to try their other stuff!"
"Overall glad I had the chance to try this one. Maybe not a world class beer but enjoyable for sure."
"Overall, I've been very critical of Cigar City (keep an eye out for my upcoming review of 110K+OT Batch #3). I love their Marshal Z. Stout, and Humidor IPA is just out of this world. As far as IPAs go, Jai Alai can rival any IPA on the market sold in a 6 pack. Honestly one of the best IPAs I've had, and possibly in the top 3 of the east coast IPAs."
"On tap @ Rattle n Hum. First off, I am extremely surpised and not in a good way on this beer. It is a nice beer but I believe it was hyped way too high and got my expectations up. Tasted like a standard west coast IPA; undistinguishable if you ask me. Average mouthfeel, amber color, carbonation, bitterness, underwhelming aroma, and not enough sweetness to balance it. Aroma was nothing special and the mouthfeel was average. There's not much I can say about this beer. Good but not worth seeking out and would order many others before this in the future."
"Pretty decent drinkability, but it does suffer a little due to the boozy finish. Worth a try and recommended."
"Drinkability: I had one, then moved on. At first it was a pretty decent IPA (although tasted more like a bigger DIPA), but as I kept drinking it was really starting to turn me off. The alcohol and dark fruit flavors began to be the only thing I was tasting. With about 8 or 9 other IPAs on the list (including pte, sculpin, two hearted and speakeasy) I moved on pretty quickly. Overall not a bad beer, but I'll pass."
"Drinkability: This was an ok beer that I enjoyed having once and would not turn down if offered in the future. That being said I'll probably not be putting this one on my shopping list to seek out in the future. I found that about 2/3 of the way through I had slowed down and was actually wishing I'd ordered something else"
"Served up a slightly hazy orange amber with a very whipped looking slightly off-white head that leaves decent lace. The aroma is much less hop-centric than many of the IPAs I have had recently. The hop character in the nose is quite nice, with notes of candied orange, mango and peach. There is also a very strong caramel malt presence and plenty of sweetness in the aroma. One sip and I can tell this is not a west coast style IPA. It is hard to say this is balanced, because even when compared to Midwest and East Coast versions, it would appear quite malty. Flavors include orange, grapefruit, apricot, spice, brown sugar toast, and toffee. It also carries a decent amount of alcoholic kick that would seem more in place if it were a double. As I sip this it is like the malt and hops battle for supremacy, each trying to shine. This not necessarily a bad thing. The mouthfeel however, is free from all criticism in that it is smooth with just the right amount of carbonation and an amazing finish that is neither drying nor cloying. The aftertaste is also a great aspect of this beer, in that it really brings out some of the hop flavors that the malty body obscures. As far as drinkability, this is not the best IPA I have had in that department, but it does go down fairly well, especially for being closer to a double in power. This is a very good beer, but it is not necessarily the type of IPA I would most want to spend an evening with."
"Reddish orange with a light haze. Big foamy head that left a white cap and wet sticky lacings. Big hoppy aroma, predominanty grapefruit with a hint of orange. Very smooth feel with soft but lively carbonation. Hoppy, grapefruit and citrus flavors at first that transition nicely into a brief malty character and smooth clean finish. Dangerously drinkable. An excellent IPA!"
"touche cigar city...TOUCHE"
"If this were not seven and a half percent, this would be a 5. Drinks heavenly. As I said before, the flavor is perfect. This has to be one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Thanks again to Shawn and thankfully I have one more bottle left!"
"O A good Am IPA and worth trying. I will be having another of these on my next visit."
"D: Nice solid IPA, very drinkable. Knocked it down just slighly in the taste, but overall this was enjoyable and something I would have no problem consuming again."
"D - The aroma on this is good, but the flavor really stands out above the other traits (and if I had to choose one thing, flavor would be it). Definitely enjoying this beer and it is going down very quickly...dangerously quickly. Hope distribution of this eventually reaches MA...would love to have this one regularly."
"D: I could certainly go through a few of these. A great IPA that goes down easy. Unfotunately this was my last bottle and now I need to get some more."
"Draft @ Underground Bluz. I had been wanting to t;ry this beer for a long time. I was not disappointed. One of the smoothest, freshest IPAs I have had. Taste was pink grapefruit from the start, but not bitter like some of the yellow varieties of grapefruit. (Being a Floridian, I know the difference.) Nice hoppy finish with no distractions along the way. Refreshing."
"Consumed: 6/19/2010"
"D-I'm liking this beer quite a bit. I'm sure glad I got a 6'r of this 'cuz I'm looking forward to the next one."
"d - clean and fresh tasting IPA that has enough nuance mixed in with the hop assault to keep it interesting, the intense bitterness does wear on the palate a bit"
"The beer pours a hazy orange-amber color with an off-white head. The aroma is awesome. I get some grapefruit and also some pine. There is also the slightest amount of orange citrus in the aroma. The flavor is a even mix of pine and grapefruit with neither standing out or dominating. There is some caramel malt in there as well. The bitterness is about medium. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very refreshing and easy drinking. I had this after a 12 hour day at work and it was the perfect beer. So glad I got to try this and happy I have a few more."
"Drinkability- Overall still not bad. It might have lost a bit over the past couple weeks but still tasty. I reminds me of a cross between Flower Power and Furious. I really hate the mouthfeel on this beer though. It reminds me of an extract homebrew. All and all pretty decent though, thanks!"
"I think this was a good drinking IPA easily sesionable. I would be proud to call it my local IPA"
"Drinkability: This is very tasty, and the creamy feel puts it up there as one of the more drinkable IPA's I have had."
"This is a good go-to IPA. Drinkability suffers a bit due to the booziness, but there is enough hop bitterness to satisfy any hop craving."
"My new model for how the East Coast can be so not California and still be great."
"Cheers!"
"Chewy medium body that is very hop forward with lots of dry earthy pine and sweet tropical/citrus fruit flavor. Hi ts of mango, pineapple, grapefruit and citrus peel along with a slightly toasty caramel malt backbone and sweet alcohol heat. The alcohol is noticeable in the finish but overall the ABV is very well masked makig his beer extremely quaffable."
"Pours a nice coppery orange color with a good cap of solid white foam. Scent is of tropical fruits (mango, pineapple), citrus (grapefruit) and a slightly sweet carmel background. Taste brings all the components of scent. Medium bodied, smooth and slightly dry. An excepionaly drinkable IPA."
"Overall a tasty full bodied IPA."
"Drinkability: This beer is not very drinkable. That's not to say that it isn't an excellent brew--it's really very good. But I haven't had much at all and I'm afraid that if I weren't splitting it I'd be knocked on my ass."
"Drinkability, however, is remarkable. The perfect level of bitterness on the finish, perfect balance of flavors that belie the 7.5% abv, making this one feel bigger than it is. Smooth and inviting, just a fantastic IPA. One of my new favorites. I've had the cedar-aged version of this, and it just doesn't compare - so much better in its raw form."
"Yeah, I think the eastern US finally has a contender for best IPA. It took us awhile. This is much more caramel forward in the bottle, as the hop sensation will fade with age. Still excellent, but to get the true essence and promise of this IPA, you gotta have it on draft."
"Jai Alai is amazing... Not sure if it lives up to the hype, but it's a very nice beer."
"I had this on tap at the Cigar City taproom. The beer was light copper color, with some chill haze and a thin spitty head, lots of lacing. There were some strongly acidic citrus aromas, primarily grapefruit. Strong caramel malt balance, more balance than I'd prefer, but still the grapefruit from the hops is well appreciated in the flavor. Well carbonated, standard IPA body. Good but not great, again I'd prefer less caramel malt."
"D: Maybe it is sessionable after all (see my on-tap review for that). A good to very good IPA."
"Very nice flavors in this ipa. Highly carbonated with an acidic push and very flavorful. Nice bready mouthcoating caramel malts with a moderate hop bitterness and long finish. Pine, citrus, grass, flowers. Very nice."
"D: Were it not for the ABV, this would qualify for a great session beer. I'd gladly have several."
"Its quite remarkable the effect that these deeply citrus and tropical flavored hops have with the embedded starch and yeast all have on this new wave IPA taste. Its a smoother and more balanced approach will appeal to a wide range of beer drinkers- even those who have traditionally steered away from hoppy beers."
"Drinkability: Very high, I really enjoyed this one,"
"Flavor is slightly opposite...more hops up front, followed by a slight light fruit, and then finishes with hops again...and slightly dry finish. Creamy and light mouthfeel, carbonation is right on, and the hops versus sweetness really compliment each other. Not my favorite IPA, but a very nice beer!"
"I very much like this and think it has a place among the best IPA's of the moment, regardless of region."
"J"
"Tasted from 12oz bottle. Pours clear amber with a frothy and long-lasting beige head. Nose of caramel malt, some vanilla, and peach and banana fruitiness. On the front, the flavor is caramel malt. In the middle, the peach and banana begin to come through, and on the back the hops start to kick in with some nice citrus and bitterness and a bit of soapiness as well. The body is fairly light with average carbonation. The finish is long with banana and bitterness. This is an awesome IPA. It is very balanced, and it is the first beer that reminds me of banana that I actually like."
"D- Great! If this weren't 7.5 abv I'd drink quite a few most nights!"
"All in all, this was a decent IPA. Not ground breaking, but good. I think this might be a good IPA to try if you're not a huge fan of IPA's. It might make you a little more of a believer. Not worth hunting, but definitely try if you have the opportunity."
"Very drinkable, a little more of a malty IPA, but not too shabby."
"D: Nice. The solvent alcohol got a little much the longer I drank this, but everything else going on here more than made up for it."
"What sits in the glass is a bright amber bit o' Everglades murk (...okay, so I don't know Florida geography very well, but they aren't too far from Tampa, right?). And I mean that in a good way. From the hazy maltiness below, a gator of ruby grapefruit snaps at my nose, joined by some piney snappers, who dredge up some water lilies as they jump; I enjoy the florality, but the soup in the boat just leaves me with wet clothes. At least my cooler's still safe. Just for the sake of vengeance, I dive in bedecked in a fully-working model of my own tongue. (I used to shop at Sharper Image...a lot...) Once fully immersed, it's immediately evident from my instruments that more tasty creatures lurk beneath the surface: Schools of caramel and toffee glide lazily about; more snappers dart to and fro, some taking daring little bites at Y.H.N.; and that original grapefruity gator's got himself some comp'ny, a tangello- and and orange-zest-resembling set o' luggage. Clearly intimidated by my lingual armour (it's British), these aquatic beasts pose no threat, but rather swim about for my amusement. All animals bow to man!! Back in the boat and back in my civvies, I find I don't need to wring all that much sludge from my suit. Instead, the murk's moderate body (listen to me, making it sound like a beer or something!), refreshingly dry finish, and what I assume to be natural and normal carbonation (hey, I've never been in a friggin' swamp before) coat only slightly before lithely gliding right off. Though initially shaken, as I motor off into the sunset I think to myself that I would definitely revisit this part of America's wang--er, the Sunshine State."
"D: This beer was very drinkable and I would definitely try this IPA again."
"Overall-- This is a highly delectable beer. I have had all of the big west coast IPAs (except younger) and I would put this right up with any of them. I would even say this is better than most!! Flat out-- get your ISO post ready and trade up for a little piece of Florida goodness!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I enjoyed the beer a lot. It was a very flavorful and tasty drink for this Friday afternoon."
"Overall, this is a very nice beer, but a bit too sweet for me. Undoubtedly well made and delicious to boot, but I'm not reaching for seconds."
"My favorite FL IPA I've had in the two years of living here."
"Jai Alai is a pretty, tasty and smooth IPA, nothing ground-breaking. It plays it safe but is nice all the same. If you can't buy this, buy Torpedo. If you CAN buy this, do so and support one of the most innovative breweries in the American South."
"Drinkability: A little on the high side as far as an IPA goes (7.5%), but it's neither tasted or felt. Just a really well made and enjoyable beer, and really a stellar IPA (one of the best of the style I've yet to try) from a very young brewery. Thrilled to have had the chance to try it."
"Overall, a good IPA with a nice hop punch. Not my favorite and I greatly preferred the cedar aged version overall, but very good nonetheless."
"D: This is my go to craft beer. Being relatively new I know, but still very tasty and easy to drink."
"Overall, this is very disappointing."
"d- goes down as easy as any I can think of and packs a punch at 7.5%. I'd definitely have again I see it anywhere"
"D-this is a very good IPA, I do like my IPA's to be all hops; but this has a good malty front with a hop explosion in the back. Very tasty and the light bitterness keeps true to a good IPA and doesn't overpower like some so I can keep enjoying."
"Overall, a very good IPA and another good job from CCB."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear dark copper color, nice carbonation, very nice thick/creamy two-finger off-white head, with some very nice thick sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, citrus, slight pine notes. The taste is hoppy, with a nice malt balance, fruity, with some citrus/pine notes. Medium body, nice bitter/dry finish. Drinkable, a nice brew, but there's something about it."
"Overall this was a very solid IPA from Cigar City and one that appears to be quite sessionable. Thanks again Kevin! Recommended."
"D: A very, very good IPA. But alas, just short of fantastic. Cigar City is a real-deal brewery though and I can't wait to try more of their offerings."
"D: wow, wish this was more readily available for me. A very solid and well balanced IPA that distinguishes itself from other IPAs. very nice."
"D- just about perfect. Before I was hooked on craft beer, bud lite was the staple beer that you could always find in my fridge. Now it's jai alai."
"Medium bodied, maybe even medium-full. Very soft, creamy texture. Packs enough heft to keep it from being a pounder. No hint of ABV. An easy drinker, but that ending bitterness knocks it down a notch."
"D- easy drinkin for the abv but its a flavor packed ride and I'm feelin a one and done. Nice stuff would absolutely get another one some day."
"Bitterness is surprisingly tame, but so is the sweetness I expected from the aroma. Beer is medium bodied and has a nice finish to it, slightly dry. Second taste, I got more malt than bitterness this time. I think I like the body of this beer but the hops should be moved to the front of the flavors. Its a decent IPA."
"Overall a decent beer. I would have it again. Don't think I would seek it out in a trade though."
"2.5 D: I really liked the first sip, but after that I grew to dislike each additional one more and more. Some combination in here that I really don't care for."
"D- Yes! I am fortunate to get this beer on a regular basis around the area. This is definitely my go-to IPA."
"Pours a dark golden orange with a fair head with decent retention. Aroma has a sharp citric twang with a cabbage-like musty dankness. Flavor has a mild malt sweetness next to a full bitterness that is slightly floral, leafy, and a bit vegetal. Finish ihas bitter flowers and cookie. Full in body, somewhat warming with a mild-moderate level of bubbles. Plenty of hops and bitterness but not too much flora or fruit to speak of, and an odd nose. Decent drinking but twelve ounces is enough."
"D - Good! This is moderately sessionable. The one pint I had went down very smoothly."
"The flavor is mostly floral hops, the malt backbone is solid, i'm just not sure that it's so good. It's a little too sweet and not so clean, not that it's bad, it just doesn't stack up with the best period"
"D - I like the hops but it seems to be too hoppy for the style - I guess I mean too bitter. The bitterness seems to take over and makes the beer seem one dimensional which takes away from the overall drinkability for me- a good Ipa but one pint is plenty IMO."
"This beer tastes incredibly hoppy, and the hop flavors are more complex than I'm used to lately. This initial impact of hops what bigger than expected and very fresh tasting. Bitter herbal hops dominate as by palate slowly recovers into the full bodied malt that really takes up the back half of this flavor profile. The sweeter hop flavors, grapefruit etc., come across mildly and still in a very bitter way. Overall this is a very well made IPA with a big bold flavor for something that's not a DIPA, but at the same time it never even comes close to being a DIPA. It just a tasty and very hoppy American IPA."
"Ok, I'm more of a stout guy, but this beer (along with Pliny, Huma-Lumpa-Licious, and Two Hearted- on my second attempt) is a great gateway into the style. Scary drinkable."
"Yep, Cigar City has done it again. This is not your normal IPA. Jai Alai starts with a nice citrus odor and then slaps you in the face with a great balance of malt and hop bitterness. This is a great tasting and perfect IPA. I have had this beer in bottle and on tap and I can say the fresher that you can get you hands on it, the better it is. This is my type of IPA!"
"D - I love it. It is my favorite hop-centric brew. Period. Well, at least excluding Belgians."
"On tap at the world class beer spot called Rattle N Hum in NYC. Poured cloudy medium amber, with a typical light khaki head, that left nice looking sheeting and spotty lace. Bold nose of grapefruit, with the hop juices oozing out, nice. More grapefuit on the tongue mingling with minty tee notes and general hoppy IPA goodness. More then espectable hop pesence, malt in the rear. Enjoyable and agressive IPA."
"Pale clear amber honey colored with a soft sudsy head. Looks very nice. A very interesting IPA on the nose. I picked up a lot of Sauvignon Blanc like aromas which included grapefruit and melon. It was also grassy and slightly herbaceous. Soft and easy drinking with juicy melon and pineapple. There are citrus and pine flavors along with biscuity malt. Carbonation is silky and gives a custard-like mouthfeel. I would have liked a touch more hops but overall an extremely pleasing brew."
"D- Easy drinking IPA. So tasty and so well done. I could tell I was drinking a quality brew. Look forward to more CC stuff! Excellent!"
"D: This is certainly drinkable and enjoyable, and I'd have it again. Jai Alai would be a good choice for a football game, playing darts, or whatever you prefer. I wouldn't seek it out or trade for it, now that I've had the opportunity to try it. It lacked any special or unique qualities, and didn't make up for it by being incredibly smooth."
"On tap at Cigar City takes NYC event at Rattle 'N' Hum. The regular Jai Alai is a very good IPA. Above average mouthfeel, bitterness. Very cloudy with white head. Grapefruit flavours. Of course more complex on cedar. Good palate cleanser, and good drinker, as many of their beers are sippers."
"D-Good stuff. Tasty and enjoyable if it is just a touch to malty....but barely. Good hop presence and I like the woody dry finish."
"D: Yes!!!!"
"Pours a nice clear amber color with a tight cream colored head that left a sheet of lacing around the whole glass as it dissipated. The aroma is of grapefruit hops, with a touch of pine. Has a juicy fresh aroma. The flavor has more of a pine hop with an asprin like bitterness. The asprin character is not too harsh. There is also a fresh grassy flavor as well. The hop profile is supported by a fairly sweet malt, perhaps with some brown sugar notes. The body is light to moderate with tingly carbonation, not that strong, has some nice balance but does finish with a hoppy bitterness. Another very good cigar city brew. This AIPA has good balance and is quite easy to drink. The hop profile doesn't blow me away but it is good."
"Excellent IPA. Being a Minnesotan, Furious is, & probably always will be, my go-to IPA, but Jai Alai shares some of those angry notes. If this appears in six-packs it should make a lot of hop-heads happy."
"d- i'm so glad that i got to try this beer out, it was a very drinkable ipa that i had no hard time polishing off, i shared with a non ba and they loved it, i could have several pints of this!"
"Reviewed on 10/10/09. Growler from Big Z Beverage. Pours a deep orange/brown with a small white head. Aroma of citrus, caramel malt, and grassy hops. Flavor is malt-forward with grassy hops and crystal malt character. Not very hoppy which was a disappointment to me. I am rather underwhelmed, especially since I enjoyed the cedar aged version so much."
"D- Very easy drinking, deceptively so for a 7.5% brew. Overall, I prefer a less balanced IPA, but I know that this is strictly preference. Definitely some great flavors and masking of the heat. Another good brew from Cigar City."
"D: Good flavor, I could drink this for awhile."
"All combined this beer is far to easy to drink."
"Draft at Cock & Bull Pub. Poured a clear copper color with an average ceeamy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate sour citrus and earthy aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met."
"O: Probably my new favorite IPA. A great, sessionable beer (although the ABV might get me soon). Now if only they'd send up some bottles to PA..."
"Excellent hoppiness, with a decent malt backbone. Very drinkable, and well worth checking out. I look forward to drinking many more of these!"
"Overall, a damn great ipa. This beer is just delicious. It is drinking easy and the pints are going fast. Thanks Grant for letting me drink a lot of this great beer!"
"D - Good IPA that should be mostly enjoyed in the summer."
"Really nice brew, and a tasty IPA."
"Drinkability: A Florida IPA to match the best of the west coast - who would have thunk it; a tad too sweet for more than one but still a fine brew"
"D- A solid IPA for sure, it has the piney bitter with some floral & fruit notes to it. I do get bummed sometimes when the taste doesn't fully deliver what the nose had advertised. I will have no problem drinking this growler. I look forward to trying some other CC offerings."
"Overall: A very sessionable IPA from a local Florida brewery!"
"Jai Alai holds a bright orange color with a lighter bronze built in from certain angles. A nice tight bubbled off white head with a creamy look. Window covering lace. The usual tropical blast of grapefruit and some mango with pine. A sweet malt base giving caramel/toffee. In taste the hops beat out the malts but not by much, but good enough for me to get a lot of fruit and pine with malt backing sweetness. Grapefruit, mango and some pine. A nice clean crisp medium body with some bitterness in the end. The alcohol peeks through just a bit and the finish has some mango slices. Pretty drinkable but not a standout, I do think it's better than some other east coast IPA's though. This is enjoyable with just the right amount of bitterness and a nice flavor"
"While nothing special, this is a solid enough IPA. I realize it's difficult to find good IPA's down in Florida, but the A grade for this beer is puzzling. It's a solid enough beer I suppose, but I can't imagine why I'd want to order it again. In the SEPA market, there are many more IPA's superior to this beer (IMHO)."
"BTW, after reviewing two other beers afterward, I ordered another one of these."
"D - I was pretty excited to try this beer since Cigar City is new to PA...overall it was a decent IPA and I'm looking forward to more Cigar City brews"
"D: At 7.5% ABV. It is a,'to be respected beer'. It is so tasty you'll wanna have more than a few, but I suggest a couple and done."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, resinous, sticky, and sweet."
"D: Medium, I enjoyed it much more when cold, but as it warms the sweetness starts to take over. A sweeter IPA that still shows lots of hops. Nice balance, but I left a bit disappointed. The hype on this beer was crazy and I left wanting a bit more. Still, a solid, solid IPA."
"D - The West Coast comes to Florida... kind of. Cigar City has crafted a very tasty, drinkable IPA with a balanced malt profile, though it perhaps can get just a tad sweet and malty overall. All in all, this is very good stuff, and I'm happy to see Cigar City is now available in PA."
"I didn't think this was an out of this world IPA but it was quite good. Had the Cedar Aged version last week and I think it's better fresh and not aged. If I were local I'd definitely get this on tap with regularity. Just a nice, easy drinking IPA."
"What a great citrus hoppy taste. Some floral notes as well. My favorite ipa sorry DFH. Big taste almost like a double. Taste lingers in your mouth soooo smooth. It packs the taste of a double but wont leave you totally tanked after 3. Could and have drank these all night."
"D: Highly enjoyable and tasty, this one is like a less malty DFH 90min. So if you like that, you'll probably enjoy this. Not a hop bomb by any means but with a great balance."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Always drinking this beer from a fresh keg, I'm sure because Cigar City can't keep up with the demand for this beer. Citrussy, grapefruity, almost west coast style of IPA with a twist, tasting like a double IPA. This beer has to be one of the best IPA's on earth. It would be impossible to say that one is better, it can only be said that one might be as good, in a different way. This beer will destroy your palate and keep you coming back for more carnage."
"D: Fairly good brew. Eager to try it on tap once it lands here in PA. The trick that the nose played on first sip was a bit disappointing, but all things considered I was pleased."
"drinkability: overall one of the best. I would love to try this with some other top IPAs. Very very close to being double."
"D: drinks easy and is nice and tasty."
"Will continue to seek out more of their beers."
"Wow. Am i surprised by all the positive feedback on this beer. I found it to be worse than unmemorable. The flavor was too strong for a standard ipa, very alcohol tasting and not enough sweetness or bitterness to balance it. Aroma was nothing special and the mouthfeel was average. Color is a typical amber. There's not much I can say about this beer."
"Golden Copper in color, nice head reduced to bumpy cratered cap. Nice aromas of dark citrus fruits dancing with nice sweet malt. Taste follows aromas, hop forward taste with balanced caramel and toffee support. Mouthfeel is a medium+ body supported by medium level carbonation."
"Floridians should be very proud to have a brewery like Cigar City and I'm very happy that my buddy NutBrown was able to send me this wonderful tap offering from the great state of New York. This is an amazing brew!"
"All in all, a very solid effort from these Tampa guys. Lots of hype for the new kids on the block, with a darn good IPA. I give them credit for crafting an IPA different than most you would find brewed in the Southeast."
"D - Well balanced and, if anything, a bit on the malty side despite the big hop aroma. Very drinkable, this combines a great hop character with rich, thick malt and almost comes across as an east coast DIPA like DFH 90min."
"D - Average-plus for an IPA."
"The drinkability of this one is extremely high given its ABV. I shudder to think what Wayne and Joey would do with a DIPA considering their IPA is pushing about 7.5%. Goood to the last drop."
"Drinkability: I would defintely have this again and definitely worth a try. Cigar city's brew have been very consistent in their line of beers."
"HV"
"Had this one a couple of times thanks to mfielden; thanks Mark. Dark amber color with a thick white head that retains well. Toasted grain and caramel aroma. Moderately hoppy nose, but leaning toward the malty side; the hops have a resiny, citrusy character with a touch of tropical fruit. The taste is decidedly East Coast, very balanced between caramel malts and citrusy hops, with malts taking precedence slightly. Mango and grapefruit hop flavors appear mid-palate, but never truly shine due to the heavy malt backbone. Bittersweet in the finish. Solid stuff, but not my favorite take on the style."
"Put FL on the must have map!"
"D and overall impression: Huge marks on drinkability here. 7.5% ABV can get dangerous, but this is sessionable. I really like this beer. I little heavier than most IPA's but the taste is soooo refreshing. I can't wait to review the ceadr and flora versions of this one. Kudos to Wanye and Joey for crafting a very fine beer. Skal."
"Overall not sure what else I can say here, this is easily one of the best and most solid IPA;s I have come across. I would love to have this one on tap everyday"
"Another beer I had on tap a few times in Tampa, even had notes, but am having to finish this growler off before its no good. Previous tastes made me feel very strongly about this IPA. Pours a burnt orange color with a solid 1 1/2 finger head. Nice sticky lacing left on the glass after a few sips. A real pleasant floral hop aroma, some nice pine and a little less bitter grapefruit citrus hints too. A solid bitterness in the taste, much more pine based than the hop aroma would lead one to believe. Well balanced though. I am normally more of a fan of the stronger citrus hop taste, but this pine works very well. Fair carbonization helps lighten up this rather strong & dense IPA. A very smooth drinker, easily a sessionable IPA for me. Obviously freshness of hops is key to IPAs, and this growler was poured at the brewery a few days ago, but wow, I wish we had this locally, I'd buy it all the time."
"Poured a cloudy golden orange with a two-finger head that dies quickly but leaves some lace. A heavier than usual smell of citric and floral hops; hints of grape and heavier fruits. Medium-bodied and smooth, but great hop presence w/ both the citric fruit flavors as well as a great dry backbite. Decent malts tucked in as well, but what surprised me was the higher-than-usual ABV. They really hide it here and it creeps in a little on the end, but I give Kudos. Glad I saw it on bottle or else I'd think this was a session IPA and get a little crushed."
"Many thanks to Gillard for sending me some stuff from this brewery, which I have been looking forward to trying for quite some time. This came in a large swing top bottle. Color is a dark orange, close to copper, with a sizable white head. Hints of pine and grapefruit in the smell; which never become too heavy. Resiny hops that taste like a combination grapefruit and tree sap are balanced out by a larger than expected malt presence. Despite the somewhat high alcohol level, this has been a session beer for me; at least for tonight. Jai Alai is a really respectable IPA from Cigar City. It reminds me somewhat of Victory's HopDevil IPA, which is also a really great, balanced version of the style. I look forward to seeing what else this brewery has under their belt in the future. Cheers"
"Had this on tap at Oldsmar Tap House. Pours hazy orange with a nice creamy head, definite carbonation (bordering on more than I would like). Upfront hops, slight citrus and a nice pine scent. Decent hop bite with a good malt backing, very balanced. Drinkability is high. Perfect for a summer afternoon, and I will definitely be on the look out for more of it. Looking forward to an increase in distribution as the popularity of Cigar City increases in the Bay Area."
" Okay, now that i know it's 7.50%, it is right at what i expected. A strong IPA that could have been classified as an Impy IPA. Very Very fresh. The freshest IPA i have ever had. Thank you, Cigar City."
"Thanks to the waiter at Mr Dunderbak's in Tampa for recommending this wonderful beer. In a pint glass the beer was a slightly hazy cherry amber color. It had a medium-sized white head and some specks of lacing. Very nice floral and citrus aroma. Hops came through well in the taste, mostly grapefruit, but also a bit of pine. Very well-balanced with malt. This is a well-brewed beer. Wish I could get it here in Maine."
"Great usage of hops, and although that is to be expected for an IPA, the brewers at Cigar City really knew what they were doing with this beer. Lots of piny, leafy, fresh hops in the mix, balanced by a solid backbone of caramel and biscuit. Lingering hoppiness rounds out a medium body with a good carbonation level. Jai Ali drinks nicely, and measures up to many of the other top-notch IPA's out there. Would gladly have again."
"Thanks to markwise for the 32oz growler. My first taste from the CCB and I must say I'm hooked! Dark hazy amber pour with a thick off white head and spotty lace. Color is a little too dark for an IPA. Caramel and citrus on the nose. Nice resinous body & great balance. Earthy resinous hops with a twist caramel malts. Long bitter finish."
"On tap at Vine and Barley in Port St. Lucie. Pours a nice orange tan color with a bit of head, leaves a ton of lac eon the glass. Smell is of citrus and outdoor freshness. Taste is where this is at, leaves pine, orange, tangerine the flavor is all there with a nice overall bitter aftertaste. This is an amazing IPA and it grealy exceeded what I was thinking it was going to taste like. Finally we get an amazing Florida IPA."
"this beer is a huge ipa. beautiful."
"On-tap at Underground Bluz in Orlando. Pours a clear dark amber color with an off-white head that leaves a good amount of lacing and retention. The aroma is loaded with lots of pine and citric hops and some malt as well. The taste picks up right where the aroma left off with a big dose of hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a fantastic IPA that is highly recommended! Well done Cigar City!"
"This is a very good IPA and I've been pretty impressed with the two offerings I've had from Cigar City. It's not over-the-top hoppy and was a nice, balanced IPA."
"Had this on tap at OLDSMAR TAP HOUSE, undoubtedly tampa bay's best pub....overall awesome IPA! Strong hop flavor...close to the Sierra Nevada Torpedo...I was shocked it came from Tampa! Excellent with cheese and crackers...gonna have to check out Cigar City Brewery and see what else they have! Wanting it to come out in bottles locally!"
"Cheers."
"EDIT: I received a beermail from Wayne (head brewer from Cigar City) telling me that there will soon be a 2nd batch available that is filtered slightly different. I will re-review when I have a chance to try this new version."
"Florida finally has it's tasty yet sessionable IPA."
