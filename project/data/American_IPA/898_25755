A hoppy scent leads to a fruit basket of flavors, with a light bitter finish. I also get faint lemon. A well balanced and solid ale with lots going on. This beer was the only thing that went right that day LOL!","RobbDogg","Dec 05, 2014"

The smell was full of hops and a lot of citrus scents with a little bit of toasted bread at the end. The taste was great with a full hop burst starting the beer off and then mellowing out into a semi-sweet finish with the toasted malt. I found this beer to be very refreshing and quite delicious.","WhiteHillsStore","Oct 19, 2014"

Mouthfeel grew as I downed the hopped up elixir. Seemed a bit out of balance malt vs hops. A little more malt would balance this brew.  Would order again.","chrismorebeer","Beers"

3.81,-5.2,4.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Final Word: Well balanced for such a heavily hopped American IPA, and the overall character is sweet and malty. Obviously, the plastery/oxidized flavor is not a good thing, but could also be the result of something outside of the brewery’s control. My guess is that this problem won’t exist if you snatch a glass around town, and even with the negative flavor, I still enjoyed the beer. Not the best IPA I’ve ever had, especially considering the oxidized flavor I encountered, but still well balanced and worth picking up if you need a change of pace or if there aren’t any top tier IPAs around.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 21, 2014"

I wasn't too crazy about it when I tried it again tonight though. You can taste the alcohol, and it has a lingering aftertaste that isn't exactly unpleasant, but it could be better. Solid IPA that is great on hot days, but its nothing spectacular.","DanLane","Jun 03, 2014"

It's an average IPA with decent taste. Nothing that will knock your socks off, but worth buying if your in a restaurant with few other choices. I was not disappointed by the taste, though the alcohol was present in it. I'd say a middle/upper-middle tier IPA. I'm not going to purchase it at my local beer store, as there are much better options, but I won't be afraid to order in over other beers if its offered where I'm dining. You will be pleased with it overall. Not quite the Big Leagues, but a AA player who just started playing AAA.","Seanem44","Apr 27, 2014"

Great beer for most every occasion. It held up perfectly to grilled red meat and the cheese platter. I'm not shocked that this classic beer could universally stand with everything thrown at it.","RoninVP","Mar 26, 2014"

Very good beer, great appearance with outstanding smell and taste, very balanced from a typically non-IPA guy. Overall this is an excellent beer that is a step behind some of the very good IPAs I have. Would certainly buy this again as it was a great value due to cost.","JamieDuncan","Mar 24, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy bright orange amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, light mango, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of bright citrus hop and moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, light mango, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, orange/lemon zest, light mango, floral, grass, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of citrus hop and moderate malt flavors; with a great hop/malt flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice IPA. All around good balance and complexity of citrus hop and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 15, 2014"

Interestingly the hops, the malts and the grapefruit come up front and also stay on the palate too. Mouthfeel is classic bitter and bready. Had four of them last time and I'm not a big drinker, usually! Drinkable. This gotta rank higher than the current 91! Excellent brew, great job and thanks.","imdsyd","Mar 02, 2013"

3.77,-6.2,3.5,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"From notes, 3/20/11. Pours a transparent amber with a good slightly off-white head. The aroma is pine, grapefruit, floral hoppiness, honey and caramel. It’s not a terribly hoppy beer, but it’s relatively assertive and pleasant. The taste is on the sweet "East Coast" side of DIPAs. The caramel malt flavor is a bit strong for me, but it finishes with some citric bitterness. Medium carbonation, slightly slick finish. It’s easy to drink and refreshing, but there’s not really enough there to merit a higher score for me.","popery","Feb 26, 2013"

There is a pleasant smell to the beer, a floral and hoppy scent. The taste is similar to the smell and has well blended rich flavors of hops with hints of floral. There are four different strains of hops and three types of malt, and these flavors are really well blended. The carbonation is good quality and gives it a good feel.

This is a great beer for introducing people to the IPA style it is wonderfully complex and very gentle. You don't get much malt or sweetness in the aroma its all hops and once again hop resin. Carbonation is light as a beer of this style should be. It goes down smooth but that is irrelevant because drinking loose cannon quickly is a crime. A Maryland favorite, its easy to see why, a must try if you get your hands on it. Maybe it's state pride but I have to give this beer a perfect rating on taste. It's a unique IPA I've never had another quite like it.","Theheroguy","Sep 08, 2012"
4.07,1.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours up a hazy deep straw color (not quite deep enough to call it amber) with a one finger off white head and plenty of lacing.

Taste is excellent with a strong grapefruitiness well balanced by strong hops on the finish. A nice offering that I would recommend if you love the hops.","Mojo","Sep 07, 2012"

Good retention and lacing. Very nice fruity mix of pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, mango on the nose. Hints of piney resin and a mild crystal malt base. The flavor very much follows suit with the same fruity character found on the nose. Sweet but balanced with a medium bitterness. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, a very good AIPA.

4.05,0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Poured on-tap into a tumbler pint, the beer is a crystal clear, vibrant, honey-gold coloring with a steady flow of carbonation bubbles and a half inch of frothy, foamy, big bubbled, off-white head that clings to the glass and retains very well. Aromas of rich, fresh, green and spicy hops. Slight caramel malt highlights with the spicy and green hops, along with a citrus highlight. Flavors are very well blended, with a subtle grapefruit blending along with the smooth crystal malt sweetness and the grassy, bitter hops that bring a cleanness to the palate. Amazingly balanced. The aftertaste is slightly bitter from the hops, with a smooth citrus sweetness. The finish is slightly astringent, which helps clean up the smooth body and prepare the palate for another drink. A little high in ABV to session, but amazingly easy to drink. Very solid representation of the American IPA.","GarthDanielson","Jan 15, 2012"

Strong bitterness, but a clean balanced mouthfeel. Wide range of hop flavors. Maltiness is just enough, slightly filling out the body. Alcohol is obvious but not offputting or hot/burning.

Firstly, it pours a nice cloudy orangish papaya color aith a nice measure of off-white colored head. The beers aroma is of tropical fruit coupled with some slight bitterness from the hops. When you taste this beer you must fight the urge to think that you are drinking a blended fruit juice. The hops impart so much fantastic flavor to give this beer the flavor of a passionfruitpinapplemango. It is really some true mastery on part of the brewers to bring this unique flavor out and giving you such an effortless drinking experience. The beer tends to lack a robust carbonation but overall is very silky and smooth which really brings out the flavors.","pzrhsau","0"

Some citrus, apricot, and fresh, wet earth. The balance is tilted notably toward hops...Malt is notably pale. No real roastiness, just a touch of malty sweetness.

When you take your first sip, it tastes like a cloudy hefeweizen, mellow and sweet with a hint of peach. Then comes the hop bitterness, which isn't overwhelming, which I am perfectly fine with. The fact that the hops aren't overwhelming speaks to its excellence balance, and I recommend this to anyone looking for an introduction to IPA's. If you are hop fanatic then you may find this a little weak, but if you're simply looking for a beer with great drinkability that's not bland and light and would like a nice introduction to the world of IPA's.

4.1,2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Bright coppery gold in the glass with a white head that settles quickly to a thin film of fine bubbles, lace follows the beer down the glass. The nose is all hop aroma. Most of the hops come through as citrusy fruit namely grapefruit, orange, lemon and tangerine. The taste too is good. I get a lot of the flavor of the hops, meaning what I smell comes through in the taste directly without it being ridiculously bitter. The balance is pretty tight despite the high apparent hoppiness the malt balances it well without ending overly sweet or cloying in any way. The mouthfeel is nice, the right level of carbonation supports the beer all the way through yet it is has enough body to fit the style. Overall a very good IPA, yet different in the way it blends so may hops to create such a pleasant citrus flavor without going overboard leading too something overly bitter.","fank2788","Jun 22, 2011"

Not that this is a sweet beer, but compared to other IPAs I've had recently like the 21st Amendment IPA or Bell's Two Hearted the Loose Cannon has a little sweetness that I find less attractive.

Orange/citrus aroma, flowery and planty as well. Some caramel malt mixed in. Nicely sweet flavor, fruity, citrusy, caramel malt. Medium body, not too bitter and pretty well balanced. Not a bad beer but it's about as generic as an IPA can get I think. Nothing stands out in it really.","goldbot","May 26, 2011"

Smells of standard pale & crystal, with a good dose from Simcoe's and Cascades. Citrus resinous hop aroma dominates. Tastes rather sweet for me, but the dose of hops are very present doing their thing. Mouthfeel is medium, with a coating thickness across the tongue. Overall I think this beer is pretty good, with multiple AIPA quality's. On the other hand, I think the (Hop3) thing is just a marketing ploy. I usually make IIPA's & AIPA's with seven or eight hop additions, plus 2-3 dry additions in the secondary, so I look at the whole thing like Miller's stupid triple hop bs.

I'm sure glad I did; I will definitely buy this again. Although its color could be more exciting, it has a wonderful bubbly action and ultra smooth, sticky head. It really packs a punch with its floral and citrus aroma that had me wanting to dive right in, and the flavor doesn't disappoint. It was tasty and balanced. Although slightly dry, I could put down several of these bad boys. The dryness just makes me want more! I will definitely get this brew's name out there to my friends.","KYBrewgrass","May 18, 2011"

In tasting I find this beer to be extremely balanced. Definitely some malt present that does not come through in the smell. Really nicely balanced. Still dominated with grapefruit/general citrus but a hint of pine and some malt backbone really make this a smooth beer rather than a face puckerer. A slight hint of alcohol heat quickly disappears after a sip or two, and the beer becomes the definition of drinkable.

When I first poured it, the first thing I noticed was not only the beatiful color but also the thick creamy head. We were off to a good start. The aromas were strong and sweet, plenty of citrus and a bit of floral from the hops. Upon first taste, to be honest, I was a little put off by it. It was not what I was expecting from an IPA, definitely more citrus tones than I was used to. With each following sip, however, I began to expect, and then soon enjoy the citrus flavors. To say this beer grew on me would be an understatement. It's been cycled into my regular purchases now. I would definitely recommend picking up a six-pack if you can find it.","mbuzzard","Jan 26, 2011"

Looks very nice, but I like a little darker orange IPA (I don't mean this to be a point against the beer, however). The abundant hops come through in the aroma very nicely, as well as a malty undertone. Mouthfeel is what one would expect from an IPA. Maybe just a shade toward the watery side, but that's what makes this one so easy to drink. It is hoppy, but not ridiculously so. The hops are well balanced by the malt, and the beer has a very pleasant, slightly bitter aftertaste. I had a glass with dinner and it was a very good complement to the food. I didn't know the ABV until after I was done with the glass, and was surprised to see it at 7%+!

The bottle was notched for February 2011, so freshness was not an issue, either. Nose was very grapefruit-citrusy and my mouth immediately began to water. Mouthfeel was medium with a really citrusy hoppy bite on the tongue. To think that I toyed (briefly) with abandoning bottles in support of The CANQuest (TM)!

Some clustered, thin delicate strands of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose is sweet grapefruit. Taste consistent with nose with a little bittering hops revealed in the middle which continues to the finish and lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium - a little oily upfront with a pleasant background carbonation that gently pricks at the roof of the month. Excellent IPA that falls somewhere between an American IPA and a IIPA. Lots of flavor without the alcohol bite. This may be one that enters my regular rotation.","Jwale73","Oct 20, 2009"

Solid hop flavors but no lasting bitterness, much more balanced than I expected, and maybe even on the malty side.

While the hop flavor was interesting I don't find the "fruity," hops to be the most exciting, and I remember thinking I was drinking some sort of beer with tropical starburst. This brings me to the malt, way too sweet, no balance with bittter specialty grains that could have made this beer more drinkable. The smell was amazing, and if you like the "pineapple," hop flavor in beer then this is for you, however I can't stop thinking that the malt choices were seriously overlooked by the brewer when formulating this recipe.

The flavor is surprisingly malty at first but quickly balanced by the hoppiness of the beer. Incredibly balanced! Finishes very smooth with only a small hop kiss and barely a hint of alcohol. Very well done indeed! The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a thin yet creamy carbonation. Overall very drinkable given the ABV, one tasty AIPA that could sneak up on you.

I have not been wowed by a beer in a while and this does it in a way that is not ostentatious or over the top. It poured a hazy, golden-yellow with a nice eggshell-white head that left plenty of lacing. The nose was slightly nutty, with sharp hops presence. There was a faint whiff of alcohol deep in the inhalation. The taste is excellent. Very dry, hoppy, and fruity without an overly bitter flavor.

Medium-bodied, very good interplay between the sour, bitter hops which create an initial puckering only then to open to sweeter malt and toffee flavors.

Easy on the palate this is extremely drinkable and the finish is clean with an aftertaste that quickly fades. Well hopped flavor, medium malt presence that is well balanced for this style.

There's also a bit of an apricot edge there. Vibrant and a bit high in flavor, but it's working. There is an unusual tangy bitter edge on the backside though. Liquid feel is slick and sticky. Carbonation is low, as you'd expect. It helps this beer out by allowing some of the more subtle characters to pop out. Overall this is a pretty nice brew on cask.

Deep hazy amber color with a one-finger head of sticky "cask-style" foam that left gobs of lacing along the sides of the pint. Nose was heavy on the citrus hops, a combination of clementine oranges and grapefruit. Grapefruit shows up more prominently in the taste, along with a nice, prevalent sweet malt base. Pleasantly bitter, but never overly so. This is definitely not a "tongue-bruiser." An extremely smooth and balanced medium-bodied brew with a silky mouthfeel (exaggerated likely by the cask-conditioning) and a well-hidden ABV that facilitates having several in a sitting.

Slightly sticky/oily moutfheel, with some spiciness on the tongue. Super-balanced IPA, and just a completely unique tasting beer. I love it.","corey0212","0"

Also some sugar or yeast in the smell (like bubblegum) and a decent malt presence (roast or bread to be more precise). A large hop presence in the taste, mixed well, but keeps a smooth body with a smoother than normal IPA finish because of the fruit taste coming from the hops and the malts/caramel or honey seal the deal. I think this is a quality IPA that any hophead should try, even if it isn't the most complex IPA out there.","clayrock81","May 09, 2008"

The smell is about as good as it gets for the style. The taste is just bursting with hops, very fresh, very lemony, very grass and tea like in their consistency. It is a newish type IPA and may not be to everyone's liking, but it is a beer for true hop heads. The mouthfeel is modest with little aftertaste. The hop flavors are not subtle and they don't linger into the finish and aftertaste, and in that, the beer differs from the more subtle British IPAs which tend to be more subdued in the middle but come on stronger in the finish and beyond.

Heavy grassy and resinous aromas. Taste has a wonderful malty sweetness to it. A touch of honey enters in the finish. The hops are definitely noticeable, but extremely well balanced.

Till each mouthful hits the back end of the palate, where a strong citrus and grassy flavors takes over, to finish it out. A thin, but not watery, mouthfeel at the start, it gradually gains weight as it crosses the palate. There is the additional touch of carbonation coming in midway and finishing at the end. This a fairly easy drinking beer, an inviting aroma, is let down by a very mediocre taste and feel though.","cameraman","Nov 20, 2007"

A little darker than I expected and falls just shy of what I might call copper. Very little head or even lacing to speak of. Aroma came off a little floral to me at first mixed with the citrus I was expecting but that certainly wasn't a detraction. Smell was also quite sweet. In tasting I recognize the grapefruit that I hear much about being representative of this style. Even with strong hops this beer also has quite a bit of malt flavor as well though neither dominates. Quite balanced. I like a chewier beer so I enjoyed the body of this one very much although it might not lend to extended drinkability. A solid recommendation.","djgray1200","Nov 14, 2007"

Lots of fruit and pine resin with a little bit of grass and malt present. Theres a big hops taste without the big hops bitterness. Strange, and strangely good, even if it doesnt necessarily fit the style. Wonderful flavors, just wish they stuck around longer. Thats probably my biggest complaint about this beer, the short finish, very short for the style I think. Nice smooth mouthfeel.

The nose is surprisingly delicate for the predictable dominance of the hops--even more sweet and floral than it is bitter. The taste is nearly as impressive--soft and balanced with the unmistakable clingy bitterness of hops rounded out by an unexpectedly sturdy malt base.

Pours an initial cloudy orange that clears as it settles. An absolutely wonderful aroma of fresh, fresh, fresh floral hops. Is there any better smell in the world than a hoppy cask ale? My first perfect aroma rating. Taste is a fresh hop bomb of the kind that only cask seems to be able to offer. I loved this one as much as I love the Black Oak Cask. Heaven. BOTTLE: 12oz bottle. Pours a light gold with notable carbonation. Lots of lacing. The aroma is a bit faint, but nice of what you get. The bottle aroma is galaxies apart from the cask version.

It had half an inch head of white foam that had decent retention that left behind a small white film, some white foamy rings along the edge of the beer, and loads of white sticky lace around the glass. It had a mild aroma of sweet juicy fruits, a slice of grapefruit, touch of sweet toasted malts, and then suddenly ended with a medium sized citrus hop punch. The taste was that of a few sweet juicy fruits, sweet toasted malts, sweet caramel, and with a dry mild citrus grapefruit hop punch. I mentioned a few sweet flavors, but it really wasn't that sweet. Every sweet flavor kept the other sweet tastes in check. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a not too strong aftertaste of juicy fruits that were mixed in with a huge helping of citrus hops. The mouthfeel is also a bit on the slick side. I could taste or feel it's 7.5% ABV.

It poured a copper color with a light amber hue mixed in. There was a clean white head. Smelled of mild hops but not an overpowering scent. Mild tones of malt in the background. No real cloudiness and no real lacing in the pint glass. Taste was of a sweet malt flavor up front followed by a rather light hop profile.

The taste is very smooth with a nice biscuit malt flavor that quickly breaks to a robust but what seems to not be an over powering hop taste. The hops stick around coating the tongue and back of the mouth allowing for a lingering hop taste. The way that the hops (floral flavor) seem to interact with everything it seems to be giving up some fruit flavors. I would say that this is a very hoppy beer but the way it tastes it seems very well in balance, maybe I have had to many real hop bombs so this does not seem to be out of sorts with me.

Pale malt sweetness upfront, followed by wheat and a pinch of caramel... then the hops take over. Fruity and piney at first, then becomes acidic and bitter in the semi-dry aftertaste. The malt is sweet but never becomes cloying, although a hint of apple ester becomes more obvious in later sips. Overall, a balanced flavor for an East coast IPA. Medium in mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation; it could stand to be more crisp, but this kind of mouthfeel accentuates the alpha oil slickness, if you dig that kind of thing.

A sunny syrupy copper when held to the light. Very resiny smell, a little sweeter than expected. The hops is a little too astringent and leave some of that resiny hop flower on the tongue a touch too long. More sugary than biscuity when it somes to the malts.

The aroma is a mix of floral and piney hops, but not as overwhelming as some of the other Double IPAs out there. There is also a distinct sweetness, which is echoed in the taste, and might steal the spotlight from the aroma hops, which are harder to notice. This is not the case with the bittering hops however, which come through nicely with a piney, bitter finish, and help mute the 7.5% ABV. The body is creamy and malty without much carbonation in the mouthfeel. This is not the most drinkable big IPA, the benchmark in my mind being Southern Tier's Unearthly, which is something like 11% ABV and much smoother.

I haven't had a brew from them yet that hasn't thoroughly impressed me. The appearance is nothing out of the ordinary but the nose, as the previous reviewer had noted, is like being lost in a giant field of hops. A smooth sweetness mingles with the strong and fresh, but not overpowering at all, hop flavor. Has that nice hop kick without being overly bitter, so they go down like water without being watered-down at all.

This cask ale is much more reserved than bottle or draft; the cask treatment has really mellowed the hoppiness and has created a super smooth/creamy taste and one hell of a mouthfeel. The hop nose is much lighter pine with light notes of citrus. I love this in bottle and on draft, but the cask is by far one of the best I have ever tasted! I highly suggest ...

Lovely scents of dripping pine oils, crushed flower petals, Juicy Fruit gum. However, this pleasing nasal performance is quickly drowned out by the cacaphony of bad tastes that assault the palate. Start off nicely with a honey-laced sweetness. This is rapidly crushed by a very unpleasant mixture of hop flavors. It's bitter, but in a bad way. What first came to mind was wet cardboard.

Head fades steadily, but lasts better than some, with plentiful delicate lacing. Aroma is fresh fruity hops, with some malt sweetness present upon further reflection. It's clear what the focus is here. Taste is fruity hops upfront, with a light pine character as well, and little to no aftertaste, just the memory of those yummy hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is quite approachable for a style that is almost defined by being over the top. This one is a reasonable session DIPA.","ppoitras","Mar 21, 2006"

Good malt backbone combined with citrusy, floral and piney hop flavors. For as much hop aroma and flavor as this has, it is not overly bitter. Medium body. Balanced, maybe even tame for a Double IPA.

A pine, mint, woody flavor rides above the malt sweetness. Sweetness is moderate but shadowed by hops and a mild grain flavor. Medium, creamy body that swallows easy.

Fruity and floral, orangey, with a sweet under-layer of toasty caramel malt. Very nice, even if it's a bit mellow. The flavor starts surprisingly mild, none of the flavor burst you expect with a big beer style. Looking at the abv, it's about right for a regular IPA, so I'll treat it as such. Toasty malt provides moderate sweetness, the hops gaining speed into the finish with an orangey citrus shine. Pretty fruity, apple esters coupling with the citrusy hops nicely. Fairly balanced finish, leaning slightly towards the hops, as you'd expect from a good IPA. Bright, citrusy aftertaste. Modest levels of carbonation. Medium to full bodied, very smooth feeling, with a nice hoppy snap in the finish. Very drinkable. I could go for another.","UnionMade","Mar 10, 2006"

A 2 finger slightly off white head falls slowly to a finger over top with just stray bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. The nose is definately hop forward. There are big notes of pine along with some grassy/very fresh herbal notes giving it a very fresh and green quality. On the tail end of a big sniff, I get some light peppery notes from the hop as well, finishing with the lightest hint of the alcohol. The malt is not as prevalent as I would expect for balance in a beer like this. I'm getting just a moderate caramel and light toastyness. Flavor is big in fresh pine character, with a more grassy charachter as it progresses. The bitter hits secondarily to the flavor of the hop. Its not too big, but it has an edge to it that bites a bit, and it hangs on pretty long into the finish. I'd like the bitter to be more smooth. Mouthfeel is on the lighter end of moderate, with a solid moderate carbonation. I'd like a little more substance here as well. Overall, I find this beer to be highly drinkable. Even though the bitterness grabs a little harsh, its still not offensive. There are no real flaws, just things I would change if I were making this beer myself.

My nose and tongue were held hostage by the full out assualt of the flavor and smell of the hops.

Looks like a treat. The nose conjures up images of fresh and green hops. This beer smells juicy and pleasantly piny with a somewhat grapefruit inflected accent. This is a very nice hop bouquet, although not super pungent. Fresh is the word. The taste is charcterized by a quick sweetness followed by a bittering citrus and formidable dryness. Pine like flavour mostly. It feels oily and resinous with some slight vegetable overtones from the generous hop additions. The mild sweetness of the malt base allows the hop character to take full reign and showcase itself. Mouthfeel is a bit light with the lesser expressed malt foundation, but still feels acceptable. The drinkability is good. This is a very fresh tasting brew overall. Just a pleasure to have flowing through my alimentary canal.","SupaCelt","Jan 29, 2006"

Pours extremely clear golden color, giant bubbles cascade to the surface to meet the well-retained white head. Conifer trees to the max in the aroma, herbal hop leaves, dank buddha and grapefruit. Not as floral or fruity as I recall the draught version being, but has those elements in the flavor, just not as pronounced as I'd hoped. Malt profile seems more on display here...toasty and biscuity. Carbonation nips the tip of the tongue and lingers for a moment. Alcohol is slightly present in the flavor and certainly is warming me up on this cool November evening. Not as packed with hops and grapefruit lushness as I'd hoped...a bit more herbal this time, but nonetheless a stellar DIPA and one that beer drinkers hopefully catch on to.","IrishRedRock","0"
4.1,2,4,4,4.5,3,4,"This brand new DIPA arriving in Georgia proudly proclaims itself to be a Hop3 Ale, so I had to buy it to see if it had the goods. By the looks of it, pretty much like a regular IPA, with an ultra clear, pale amber body, and a persistent egg shell white head. Smell was that of floral, citric, and spicy hops. Neither very pungent, nor piney like a west coast DIPA, this aroma felt fresh, yet restrained. Taste was very acidic with grapefruit rind astringency. The malt was rather sparingly used for the style with a basic sweet honey caramel taste. Quite pleasantly medium and very appropriate for a regular IPA, the mouthfeel felt short of expectations for a DIPA. Not quite as far off the mark as the Peg Leg Imperial Stout from the same brewery. And like the sister beer a very well made product, but just not what one would expect.","rajendra82","Nov 06, 2005"
4.1,2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A clean amber beer. Has a big foamy off white head and a little lace. There is a very peppery hop aroma with a fruity grapefruit background. The peppery hop aspect attacks the tip of your tongue. Setting up the bittersweet grapefruit hop finish with just a light carmel malt sweetness in the middle.","ybnorml","Nov 05, 2005"
4.42,10,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice dark amber with a finger of off-white head that settles to a thin cap rather quickly. Pretty nice lacing however. Nose is big and hoppy--fruity mango/tangerine, flowery perfume, and a smattering of pine needles. Taste is hoppy once again, big juicy grapefruity hops jump out right away, with a sweet malt trying to poke it's head in the middle but getting drowned out by the piney resinous hops that kick in on the finish. Bitterness is a little more subdued than the nose would indicate, but the hop taste is really superb and comes out in every sip. Medium bodied with a smooth and slightly slick mouthfeel. Overall, I really enjoy this beer, a nice full-flavored IPA, currently my favorite of the Clipper City offerings.","cubedbee","Nov 03, 2005"
4.32,7.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Nice amber to darkened golden in color. Head is ok though its gone all too quickly. Big, wet, sticky hop aroma. Nice bitterness upfront balanced by a healthy dose of malt. At first I found it almost too astringent for my liking but the lingering sweetness of the malt really balances the whole thing out quite nicely. Great body-really carries through and makes for a complete package. Overall a great beer. Once again Clipper City comes thru.","lackenhauser","Oct 31, 2005"

4.8,19.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability and Overall: A wonderful offering from Clipper City. This is definitly the best of the Heavy Seas brews yet. Pick this one up if you see it, you will not be dissapointed. A classic already.","santoslhalper","Oct 13, 2005"
3.88,-3.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"It poured gold with an egg shell head. The aroma was as promised one of strong floral hops. The taste had a small amount of malt, but was mainly a very nice floral hop. The feel was light, clean, and dry. This was a good example of a hop beer, they gave you flavor not just bitterness.","claytri","Beers"
