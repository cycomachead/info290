"O: kinda a cross between west coast ipa and English ipa that is really smooth. Hop heads will enjoy!"
""

"Fairly light. Nice citrus hop aroma and flavor. Some sweetness on the back end as well. Very sessionable at only 5.7% ABV. Would buy it again."
"sticky sweet mouthfeel and sweet perfumey  smell, slight banana flavor. its much better on tap , a decent session ipa."
"whiffs of alcohol. opaqueish yellow. Not very bitter, mostly in aftertaste. Honey sweetness. a little womens fruity perfume.light to medium bodied oily after. More booze than is suggested by abv. some banana in the nose as well."
""

"One of the IPAs I recommend living in Wisconsin the most."

"Overall; Very interesting beer wish I had a few more of em !"
"This is kind of a biased rating because it wasn't close to fresh. I like to remember what I have had so I gave the ratings anyway."

"High clarity, color on the citrine side of amber. Strong foam on the pour the recedes to lace the glass. Initially, I smell and taste the hops. Citrusy, with a bit of astringency. In a sip or two, I am accustomed to hops and the malt begins to shine. There is some sweetness and toastiness, and as I drain the glass, toasty recedes and something like chocolate takes its place. Did they use a bit of chocolate malt to increase color?"
"Tasted like a malt heavy piece of wet cardboard. Hopefully the just oversparged this batch."

"Overall:  I was surprised to find that Cascade hops were the sole hops used in this beer, albeit they have been added in eleven separate additions; I was expecting something different, given the interesting tropical fruit tones;  in any event, quite a good pale ale and a solid flagship beer for this brewery"

"Creamy, medium body and medium carbonation."
""

"One of my favorite beers, nice and fragrant with decent bite but not overly fruity so I, at lease, can session this beer.  This beer is one of the main reasons Ale Asylum grew so fast."
"Brownish yellow color. White head. Slight flowery smell. Nice balance of hops and malt. This is the original beer that got me into hops."

"A really pleasant, almost classic pale ale that reminds me of Sierra Nevada in its heyday. There's a really strong grapefruit and orange scent that is mirrored in the taste. The malts aren't strong but balance out the citrus well. This and the light but slightly oily mouthfeel make it an easy drinking but really flavorful APA."

"The Hopilicious is a solid IPA. The beer poured a clear orange with white head that left a nice lace all the way down the glass. The scent carried fresh hops that leans towards pine and citrus. The taste follows the nose quite well. It does have a more bitter than balance. The mouthfeel is medium with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a great beer and could be sessioned."

"This really is a pinnacle of American IPAs and I hope that Ale Asylum—with their spectacular new facilities—are able to expand their micro-brewed gem to a larger crowd."

"Overall- Good drinking, nice and hoppy APA. Not mindblowingly good, but a solid buy for an everyday drinking APA."

"The look and smell was very appealing and the hops shine for a pale ale. It is a good west coast type pale ale."

"Ale Asylum Hopalicious ---3.5/5"

"They've found a way to keep the citrus flavor of the cascade hops while limiting the bitterness. The result is a delicious, hoppy brew. I can't say enough good things about this beer. Highly recommended."
""
""

"4 O - really dig this APA. I'd get it again if the opportunity presented itself."

"I absolutely do not like hops. However, I have heard so much about how awesome this beer is. The brewery is 28 miles away in a college town so I had to try it. It actually has a very smooth taste and has the perfect carbonation. I still don't like a hoppy beer, however, this beer has a very smooth taste and isn't all that bad!"

"D) Not a bad beer despite being too malty for my usual fancies. I drank it warmer than fridge temperature; probably would have liked it better if I had it colder."
"O - Bought a 6-pack of this on our annual Fall trip to Wisconsin for apples. I love a lot of hop-forward beers but this one was a bit too dry for my tastes. Still not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I love buying this by the box of 12, and I've been doing so for years. A great, all-around bier; hoppy, but not too bitter, a touch of malt. An absolute go-to."

"tasty overly hopped pale"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very solid pale ale. Leans very much to the hoppy side with lots of citrus esters but doesn't have the bitter bite of an IPA. A nice lighter hoppy option."

"O - A tasty IPA with loads of citrus hop flavour, easily sessioned and well worth picking up. I could take down a 6-er of this no problem."
""
""
""
"O: The flavors aren't going to knock your socks off, but it's nicely balanced and highly drinkable. This is like a ""dumbed-down"" Daisy Cutter. A solid brew that I could enjoy a few pints of on a hot day like today."
""
""
""

""

"This is a really nice, really drinkable pale ale. Great hop aromas, clean taste and mouthfeel. I see more of this in my future."

"O - Ale Asylum has struck gold with Hopalicious, a delicious and round-bodied pale with a great aroma and inviting appearance. The flavor lends itself very well to a (richer) hoppy session beer that has great drinkability!"
""
""
""
"It has a nice yellow color toward brownish. It has a nice head when poured into a pint glass. They recently moved the brewery to a larger facility and have switched from the stubby bottle to long necks. The quality is still A-1."
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all I will base my score off of this beer, I do not review beer from bad batches or that is infected as it is not fair to the overall score."
""
"Overall- of all of the ale asylum beers that I have tried (Ambergeddon, Contorter, Madtown, Satisfaction Jacksin) this is my favorite"

"Light mellow feel, extremely drinkable with grassy green hop notes and sustained bitter orange peel in the aftertaste. Easygoing malt character that isn't overly sweet thankfully. The composition is seamless, and its just an effortless APA to drink. Definitely a gateway craft beer for those hop-averse but craft-curious beer drinkers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"if this were more carbonated it would change the beer entirely. it is a unique hope flavor, definitely, but unfortunately that's all this beer has going for it."
"o - Overall a pretty nice local pale ale. Nice hops and citrus in the nose, though it wasn't quite as strong in the taste. Easy to drink and would have it again, though I enjoyed some of their other stuff better that weekend."

"Overall: Really Nice APA. Drinkable and flavorful. Big ""N" Bold hoppy oranges in this beer. This is an awesome local that more people need to discover. Ale Asylum really did this beer right! i did not even know what was sitting in the beer cooler, I have passed this beer by way too many times...not any more! Seriously underated WI local."
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall a solid APA, nothing over-the-top, just a nice mix of citrus to pine and hops to malt balance"
"O - Great APA and one of my favorite offerings in WI."
""
"A very nicely done APA. Well balanced and flavorful."
""
""
"O) A nice APA right here. Definitely worth a try. Glad to recommend..."

""
""
"A real nice drinking beer. Soft feel overall and very inviting."
""
"This beer poured out as a clear lookig yellowish gold color. The head was white and fizzy, with a good amount of bubbles rising to the glass. The lacing was minimal with just some scattered suds around the glass. The smell of the beer is a bit more earthy and malty than I expected. The taste of the beer is also more grainy than I originally thought it would be. The mouthfeel was clear and crisp, light bodied and had a sharp carbonation to it. Overall this beer sounded like it was going to be a bit more hoppy than it actually was. The beer itself isn't bad just not exactly what I was hoping for."
""
"Overall a very average APA. Wish there was some more complexity and flavor to it. Tastes a bit watered down and is not very exciting."
""
""
""
"Overall, a disappointment that brought to mind an unfortunate shandy made from MGD and Sprite."
""
""
""

""
""

"O: Went down oh-so-well. I was actually pissed that I drank this one so quickly. Blame it on today being the first workday of spring where it actually FELT like 'spring' (dry, mid 60s). Or blame it on this being a damn tasty beer. Whichever the case, I'd like more."
""
""
""
""
"Of all the great Hop pun beer names out there, Hopalicious is one of the least creative. But who cares? It's the quality of the beer itself that counts, and this one is excellent on all the levels that matter. Bottom line: super solid and super satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was pleasantly surprised by the hop profile and this beer in general. A very good easy drinking beer I'd be happy to have again."
""
"Overall- This beer has just enough flavor hops and a solid malt backbone to be a wonderfully balanced pale ale. The hops could be even more pulled out and explored in my opinion, especially if you are going to call it Hopalicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It’s pretty ordinary Pale, nothing really standing out, and nothing really special. I wouldn't recommend this beer for a good example of the style, nor a bad example."
""
"O: a good pale ale for those tart bitter hankerins."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-If I am ever back in Wisonsin, I will seek this out again. Tasty and economical. It was great to have with chips and pizza."
""
"A very nice IPA. I got a nice bitter hoppy taste. There was a fair amount of citrus and pine notes as well-maybe not as much as my favorite IPAs but enough to make this something I should try and purchase down the line. I am always partial to local breweries and this was a good version of a pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, this is a very easy drinking brew. I'm happy to have had this brew, but am sad this is my final beer of the six pack."
""
""
"Cascade is the star but doesn't outshine a simple but tasty malt base. Very nice creamy feel with great carbonation. Wish this was available where I live."
""

"O - It's a pretty enjoyable APA to me. Everyone consistently looks to have their taste buds blown off by the latest and greatest IIPA, so brews like this go unappreciated. When looking for a carefully done APA, I think you should give this a serious consideration!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Big foam that slowly became a thick film. Nice amber color, slightly cloudy. Wonderful hop scent. Bright and citrusy. Easy drinking mild taste. Hops, citrus, light bitter finish. Medium mouthfeel, not to light. Overall a good beer. I could easy drink several."
"Overall just an average APA."
"D/O: This beer appears to have originated from what was a great plan on paper, but it shows either timidity or a low-grade inability in its execution. Its principal sensory qualities are well positioned but muted, allowing minor features such as carbonic acid and peanut butter to compete for attention and even interrupt at times. No failing derails it, instead just adding up to a list of misdemeanors that pile on to the forget-ability factor."
"O: Below average for an IPA for me. Malts too dominant without the hops to justify. Too sweet. Hops seem dead."
"Overall a good beer for sure."
"I wish I had easy access to this beer as it would be in my regular rotation. Very good APA. It's only second to NG's Moon Man for me when it comes to WI APA's."
"O: From the name, I was expecting an IPA, but it's definitely an APA, and a good one. Mellow, well executed, nicely done. Wish they were available locally, would but it often if I could."
"This is an odd beer; smells like a DIPA yet drinks like the best of the session beers. If this were on tap I could easily park myself and drink this beer for several rounds."
"O: An excellent APA. Very flavorful. Fruity. Well balanced. I wish this was available in in my area."
"O - a very solid APA, easy to drink with appealing flavors but not overly complex, got this six-pack free though, so I can't complain"
"Light amber with blonde highlights when backlit and a creamy bone colored cap that leaves beautiful lace on the glass. Some suspended micro floaties make me worry that this bottle might be past it's prime. Hopalicious is a good name for the aroma, I love the smell of Cascade hops even if everyone says it has too harsh a bitterness and is an ""outdated"" hop flavor. The nose is pure, fresh Cascade hops and smells like sticking your nose in a bag of fresh hops, candied grapefruit and pine sap with light malt. I love this beer for it's simplicity, the glory of Cascade and a pretty light malt base to let it shine without being really bitter. Medium bodied and slightly chalky. I dig this brew."
"Pours an opaque golden color, half finger of white foam. Pretty good lacing and retention. Smell and taste are mostly floral, biscuity, with a tiny bit of sweetness. Almost no bitterness. I guess my only wish would be for a little more hop flavor; right now, it's tending toward thin. Medium body and medium-high carbonation. The carbonation seems a bit harsh? Overall, this is a good, easy drinking, floral pale ale."
"O - This beer is one to enjoy over time. I think pairing it with some sharp cheese would be amazing. It's highly drinkable, and doesn't demand that you pay attention to it too long after you've had a sip. It's simply amazing."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden color, decent head and nice lacing. Very mild citrus and floral hop aroma and a little caramel sweetness. Pretty lacking for something with the word hop in the name. Taste is the same as the nose, not hoppy enough, but overall very enjoyable though not even as bitter as the Sierra Nevada Pale that was in my glass before it. I'd buy it on occasion if it were available around here."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a hazy golden color with a medium white head and a good lace. The aroma is nice & fruity with some mango and citrus with just a mild caramel hint. The flavor follows with some nice melon and citrus. There is some distinct bitterness in there as well, more bitterness than say your average citrusy fruity pale ale/IPA. There is a mild biscuit maltiness in there as well and not really any sweetness. This is very tasty and one I'd gladly have again from Wisconsin!"
"Pours a semi-clear amber color with a rather thick head of off-white foam. Scent is heavy with hops, a scent of crisp apple, and bitter malts. Taste is smooth, clean, and crisp. Hops are well blended with some spice for a good taste and I'm getting a hint of apples as well. Ends with a dry after taste. Hits the taste buds well with flavor but is still light enough to be enjoyed at a cook-out etc. One of Ale Asylum's most popular brews!"
"Overall is pretty good, not amazing though. Maybe a nice summer drink."
"Maybe. The most offensive thing about it is not intense, over the top, American-style IPA bitterness. No, the alpha acid levels are actually quite bitterness. But the beer has been gassed to all hell, and on top of that, there's relatively little grain to be found in this bottle (maybe that's how it can get away with being unfiltered), resulting in a way too light malt backbone and a thin body. That said, there's nothing else wrong with it. Still way more drinkable than many American IPAs. Hopalicious is a fine, if one-dimensional, profile of what cascade hops can do."
"Hopalicious is a decent beer overall but not really impressive in any aspect. The flavor is relatively mild and too laid-back to be much above average. Hopalicious is misleading"
"The beer is a golden orange with just a wisp of pale foam that decorates the snifter with a thin ring. The beer smells very fruity like tangerines and of fresh toasty malts. The beer is delicious with just sweet citrus flavors, well rounded malts and just enough bitterness for balance. This is probably the best tasting APA I've every had. Often I feel like APA's are too bitter without the fresh hop flavors, but this beer hits all the notes and is just so juicy and sweet. Delicious."
"O: This beer shouldn't be named Hopalicous. I started with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and then moved on to this beer in hopes that the hoppiness would exceed the Sierra Nevada. If you take a closer look, you will see the description of this beer claims that its cascade hops give it a ""bold hop flavor without crazy bitterness."" I didn't expect this APA to be ridiculously hoppy, but the very subtle hop flavor in this was a real let down."
"Very nice pale ale. Nothing particularly stands out, but a solid APA with high drinakability; would buy again."
"This beer pous a hazy golden color with a small lacing head. There i a nice floral aroma from the hops. There is a nice hoppy taste that is rather mellow but still present. There isnt that lingerng hoppy flavor, and could use more carbonation. Overall a reallly nice apa, very enjoyable."
"Nice amber color, not too much head. Smell was full of hops as expected. I enjoyed this beer. Good flavor, not too heavy. Very refreshing. I wouldn't mind drinking a few more of these in the near future."
"D: This is my 2nd Ale Asylum beer and bit let down. The aroma had me excited, but the flavor and mouthfeel was very weak and watery. Not an awful beer, but certainly much better beers available. Very sessionable, almost like a macro version of a American Pale Ale."
"Haha. Now theres a gay beer name. Poured a pretty golden color with a frothy white head. Aroma is supper hoppy fresh. Taste was actually a little weak in the hop department, especially considering how this smelled. This was still pretty fresh and enjoyable though. Medium body, drinks pretty well."
"If you enjoy IPAs and Pale Ales, this is a MUST try."
"A bit of a blast to the palate being so dry and grapefruitey but I love these flavors so I could drink these brews a lot. Will be making the trip back to Wisconsin soon for more of these."
"It says enjoy it with passion on the label. Doubt you could do anything but enjoy this brew."
"Beer is medium bodied with a nice bitterness at the back and some hop forward flavors. There is an earthiness to the midpalate and the beer finishes nicely without being too dry. The forward isn't sweetness just gives way to midpalate chewiness with the hop resins. Its the kind of beer that coats your mouth. its OK."
"(D)- A lighter bodied IPA, but still tasty"
"Alcohol/Solvent: 2"
"D: I could drink this all day long.... if only I could click my heels together and end up in Wisconsin."
"Firm crisp mouth with decent carbonation. Not too filling. Starts out with a smooth mellow sweetness, then switches to crisp sharp hops. Great bitter bite there. Finish is bitter, but not scalding. Excellent hoppy beer. I would love to session this beer, and would if I had access to it locally. Thanks, Andy!"
"A sharp bitterness begins the taste and then a nice fairly bright orange hop flavor. Then a bit of biscuity malt flavor shows up. As an APA goes it pretty standard, big American hop flavor, a bit of malt and a pretty dry finish making it for a decent drinkability."
"Pours a moderately-dark yellow with a several finger white head that quickly recedes withot leaving too much lacing behind. Nose has a good amount of citrus hops. Taste is fairly one dimensional with citrus hops as well. Not bad to be one dimensional in this regard, but if that's the case It'd prefer that flavor to be a bit stronger. Good light to medium body and drinks quite well."
"D - Highly enjoyable and drinkable, could do this one all day. Really liked this beer."
"Tasty, and something I would definitely drink again."
"Really solid hops beer!"
"D - Very drinkable APA. It's smooth, refreshing and very easy to drink more than one."
"Drinkability - I could drink this all night, when in Madison I consumed 10 bottles in one session. This beer screams drinkability. I wish I could get it all the time."
"Drinkability - a mild abv and a strong hop flavor makes this beer very drinkable. I would even say its session worthy if you can handle the hops."
"Pours a beautiful orange yellow, iced tea sort of color with a 2 finger fluffy head with great retention. Aroma is on point with many IPA's out there and really doesnt smell like an APA. Huge hop aroma with some honey undertones and some cheerios cereal breadyness. Very attractive nose. Taste falls short of what i expected but still nice and balanced. has some sweet pineapple like sugary aftertaste that is appealing but throws me off from the lack of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice as its carbonated well and has a great lasting head. Drinkability is low for me as i would really pick a SNPA over this any day. worth a try but not going to seek this out anytime soon."
"Overall a very drinkable and smooth beer with some fresh and refreshing flavors. Easy to drink. I would drink this again but I cannot get it here in WA, my wife brought this back from WI for me."
"Update: I'd say drink these fast, they degrade over the summer. They don't degrade to anything horrible, just not tiptop."
"Overall, not a bad pale ale, but nothing I want a lot of. Too malty for me. Drinkable, if I would want more. Not bad, but not good."
"Pours a cloudy golden copper color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus creamy off-white head, with alot of nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some nice malt notes, some citrus. The taste is very nice, slightly sweet, hoppy, nice little malt note, a nice touch of citrus. Medium body, nice little dry/bitter finish. Drinkable, a nice brew, surprised me, thanks Todd."
"I've had this on tap and I would swear it was much better then - could this be a freshness issue? This particular beer's target flavor seems susceptible to that."
"Nice drinkability that makes this an awesome session beer. Very flavorful, but not overly bitter with the hops. A really nice beer that I wish I could buy at will."
"Taste is nice and crisp with mostly citrus and has a rather dry finish but the mouth feel is nice and carbonated. A very drinkable and good pale ale."
"D: Refreshing and well-balanced."
"Great first offering to have from Ale Asylum. Just picked up a 6er of the Contorter Porter today."
"D- A little misleading by the name of this brew I expected more hops and it fell short. Not bad just expected more from this one."
"Third time I have had it 9October 2011) and its very good each time."
"D- very very drinkable, could easily drink this all the time. wish it was available in my area."
"Enjoyed on tap at Ale Asylum in Madison, WI. Pours a cloudy grapefruit color with a thin white head. Aroma is of citrus hops. Medium bodied with a sweet caramel flavor to balance the hops that linger long into the finish. Very good pale ale. I will be having this again."
"An all around decent Pale Ale here, that possessed a surprising amount of earthy hop dankness to it, which took a little getting used to. Definitely a more interesting use of American hops here."
"D- A pretty good offering from Ale Asylum. Pretty true to style and not as out there as some APA's. This is a good beer that you could sit back and enjoy a few of without having your taste buds being killed."
" ~ I certainly recommend this brew be tried. It's worth a sampling."
"As long as you like the bitterness of hops, it's a keeper. Personally, I'm very glad to have had the chance to try it. I don't plan to search it out again, though."
"drinkability is good. an easy-going pale with a fresh and pleasant character, and a satisfying finish. the only complaint is that the hops could be a bit more concentrated, but otherwise this is a solid brew cheers!"
"Drinkability: Sessionable"
"D: A very good APA. Light, flavorful with higher carbonation and a noticeable, but not over-the-top hop presence, lends this to being a very sessionable beer."
"D- It isn't an everyday beer and overall this isn't a very satisfying ipa rather a mediocre one."
"It only takes a moment. Just a moment, then you're gone. The life is like this cup in front of me... drained readily, gone from the face of the earth... everything's gone. You're above average, but you were never meant for greatness."
"Medium body, average and crisp carbonation, and goes down easy. This is a sessionable ipa."
"D - Very balanced and drinkable if not a little boring. A 6 pack of this would disappear pretty fast."
"Pours a slightly clouded golden orange with a nice enough cream head. Flavor is salty a bit. Citrus and pine are barely there. Comes off as one dimensional. Feel is thicker on liquid. Nice enough to drink, but like I said: not bringing a lot of depth. Just a punch in the mouth more like it."
"This is Ale Asylum's most popular brew for a reason."
"standard pint at Dotty's followed by pitchers at the Terrace"
"In my pint glass this beer is a light gold color. almost light enough to be yellow. Moderate head that leaves little bits of sticky lace around my glass. The aroma is hoppy but not bitter. A bit sweet with piney and orange peel tones. The flavor is grapefruit and pine with a nice sweet malt backbone. This beer has a nice bite but not so much that you pucker up. It just sort of goes over the taste buds nice and smooth. Medium body very crisp and refreshing. A great beer to sit back and enjoy all night."
"I had this on tap with a bacon cheeseburger (medium-rare, Maytag blue cheese) and will think of it often after leaving Madison this week."
"Pours a rich gold, a great color example of pale ale. A little hazy and moderate head that dissipates fairly quickly. Aroma is wonderfully citrusy and floral Cascdes. A hint of carmel might be there too. Pleasant bittrness is light enough to let the lighter malt sweetness to come through. Taste is citrusy with a little grassyness. Very appropriate carbonation level and good finish, maybe a bit of residual sweetness and lots of residual hops. A nice and hoppy pale APA but lacking a bit in the malt backing. Overall quite drinkable."
"A light straw color, very clear, moving towards copper in the very center and thanks to a moderate haze on this one. A 1-2 cm head forms on top, leaving some sticky lacing. This one looks nice at the start. The smell is kind of normal, just a moderate citrus hop presence comes to the nose, mixed in with a light powdery maltiness. The taste comes out first with a light lemon-lime flavor. There's also sort of a hop tea flavor, kind of herbal, leafy, floral - but actually hop tea light might be better. The idea sort of comes because of the lack of malt presence here (but to be honest, the hop presence isn't impressive or overwhelming either). This one is very, very dry - which may also detract from the maltiness I desire, at best I can taste a bit of milled/crushed barley, but without the sweetness. No bread, no caramel. This one really tastes like the average American Pale Ale if I had to say so. The mouthfeel was really thin, very watery. The hoppiness is really the only thing in the body that would help me distinguish this from water - in terms of body alone. This one is very easy to drink - thanks to the wateriness. But it really is not that enjoyable I guess. Actually, the best way to describe it is that it is stuck somewhere bteween what I expect. If you have time, I have a little side note I'd like to go into: with APAs, there seem to be two schools of thought: (i) make the beer malty, kind of bready - a bit more body, but still light in color compared to other styles, add some hops, enough that you notice the flavor and aroma, not a lot of bitterness, but a good citrus presence - not too resinous though, (ii) make it light in color and light in body and light in alcohol, pump it up with hops, especially dry hops, to really show off one particular variety, you let the hoppy flavors carry the mouthfeel and the flavor and everything. Now back to the beer - this one is stuck between the two of these, it had the hop profile of type i but the body of type ii, which is not exactly the best combination to my taste buds."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells strongly of hops, sweet malt, and slight citrus. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. There is a good bitterness level. Tastes of strong hops up front and throughout, slight hint of fruit, sweet malt, toffee, sand slight pine. Overall, a really good beer."
"D: The hops are not one of those that will leave you wanting more, seems to be more of an APA that has bittering late stage hops than anything else. Not a bad pale ale by any means, just not unique or anything that sets it apart."
"Drinkability: I think this could fall into the IPA category instead of an APA, but regardless I find this very enjoyable. Most of the APA's I have had have not had this much hop flavor to them, but I find it very pleasant. One of my favorite beers, and it's nice living only a few miles away from the brewery. The ABV is hidden quite well, and this could definitely be a session beer."
"Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into my nonic tumbler, the ale appears a clear golden amber color with about a finger of creamy off white head. Tastes and aromas are of resinous pine, grapefruit pith, grassy, bitter, caramelized malt, a touch of orange. About medium bodied with ample carbonation. Worth a try."
"The beer is light bodied with high carbonation and a dry mouthfeel."
"D= A damn drinkable and very enjoyable APA here. Would drink this again in a heartbeat."
"D- This is a nice little APA which reminds me a lot of my homebrewed apa. Refreshing."
"Overall, I have to say I love this beer. Its tough for me to rate beers like this because it becomes a struggle between rating it on its own merit vs. rating it versus the style. I would say that as far as the style goes this is an A+, but I must also take into account that it is not a style known for huge flavor (which I love), and therefore does not stack up against the other beers I consider to be the best. In the end, I will settle with the score I gave it and give Ale Asylum themselves an A+ for doing a great job with this beer"
"Not a fantastic beeer, but above average in all respects. A very nice pale."
"This is a decent APA that has a pretty hopped up aroma and a more balanced malt-forward taste where the hops offer more of a supporting role."
"Mouthfeel was a bit thinner than expected but adequate."
"Nice to try something from the midwest,I dont get enought midwestern wares anymore.Poured into a standard pint glass a dull hazed medium golden with a bit of dark orange tintAromas a a little light mainly a mix of caramel/biscuit malt and citric hop.Well rounded flavors with the hops winning out by a nudge,starting out with a pretty firm lightly sweet caramel base,melding nicely into a nice prsh citrus/hop finish that lingers.A solid APA borderline IPA,quaffable and flavorful."
"D: With a name like Hopalicious, I was expecting a lupulin bomb. Instead I got a well-balanced pale ale with an assertive hop profile. A welcome surprise."
"Of course like every beer I like the fresh, draft version better, but this is still a good ale."
"Pours out a great cloudy golden amber with nice bright white head. Smells like a spring prairie, flowers, spiciness, with a hint of orange. Cascade all the way baby, this is one nice smelling brew. Taste is very refreshing, and hoppy. Big lemon, grapefruit, and orange being thrown in your face, with a nice bittnerness in the middle that follows into a pretty sweet finish that leaves you wanting more. A hoppy pale ale for sure, but still a very nice drinking fallback beer anytime I can find it on tap. Good brew."
"D - This is a pretty tasty APA. The Cascade hops really give it a floral touch."
"Expected more of a hop bite from this one."
"Top notch brew!!!"
"Special thanks to asmokingoat for this one!"
"A very good light-bodied APA that still manages to feel creamy in the mouth, and retain a nice refreshing carbonation factor. I have had this out of a bottle and would give that about a B, however on tap at Ale Asylum is where this beer really shines, undoubtedly due to the freshness which really makes the hop profile ""pop."""
"A: Resiny head along the edges of the glass, slightly opaque, color of a dark peach juice - 4.00, S: Nicely hopped aroma, lots of citrus and pineapple, possibly even some mild bubblegum, balanced with some biscuity malt - 4.50, T: Lots of bitter bite in this brew, hops play the primary role, I detect Cascade, there is the faintest hint of some other grain in this beer - maybe a rye - 4.25, M: Medium bodied - 4.00, D: Though identified as an Pale Ale this one borders on the line of an IPA, I would happily purchase this beer again - 4.50"
"Pours gold with copperish tint, one finger of white head-decent retention and moderate lacing. Hop aroma is a mixture of citrus and grass with a mellow caramel malt scent in the mix. Taste follows the aroma-big hit of pithy grapefruit before the hops mellow, pleasant cascade finish. Light bodied, perfect for an APA. this has been one of my go-to APAs since i moved to madison and i haven't looked back. easily meets the snpa lithmus test for quality APA."
"Peach body. Thin white head. Kind of glows. Lacing is quite full. Really nice aroma of sweet caramel/toffee malts blended with plump juicy cascades. 10 additions of cascades. Nice. There's a lot of hop flavor in this beer without a lot of bitterness. Grapefruit pulp and orange. Some bright lime. Some underlying smoky, resinous tones. The malt base is solid with some sweet caramel tones providing a nice little blanket for the hops to rest on. This is really drinkable. Could drink a lot of this in a session. Nice beer."
"Notes from 4/6/07"
"D - This is a nice little hoppy ale that is well-balanced and boasts a pretty complex blend of flavors and hops."
"Thanks brdc for this intro to Ale Asylum. Pours a hazy golden-straw with a pillowy, nearly three finger white head. Mild floral scent with a splash of pineapple. Similar tones to the taste - pretty single-mindedly Cascade dominated. Sweet pineapple, a bit of orange rind, flowery herbaceousness, and resinous pine-sap - all very mild and muted. A slightly soapy flavor as the sweetness recedes. In addition to the gentle but dominant hop flavors, a biscuity malt backbone shows itself in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and slightly creamy. As with a simcoe-only IPA i just brewed, I get a bit tired of the soap and sap as the hops fade off the tongue, knocking the drinkability down just a touch. A rather nice APA and a good Cascade showcase."
"Not to much else to say, a very mellow APA to put it lightly no pun intended. Probably wouldn't buy again."
"No complaints here, I can't think of an APA I like better, but I can't get this one in IL so I'll have to wait til I go back to Wisconsin for more. On the other hand, I did have a Three Floyds Alpha King on tap recently, and this stands up to it well."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of pine and grapefruit with a hint of malt beneath it. The taste is full of citrus, pine, and grapefruit. The mouthfeel medium bodied with a velvety texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice pale ale that I could easily drink again."
"Overall I had to say this was an ice little APA. I could have easily had another, and another after that, but alas only the one was to be found. Nice structure with nothing over the top or outrageous in any way. Overall great little beer here that I would not turn away."
"Not a classic for the ages, but a nice IPA."
"Hazy, bright orange with a very nice 2 fingers of white head. Aroma of fragrant navel oranges. Bitter and malty on the front end, with a super citric hop taste thereafter. Clean and balanced nicely. Long lasting hop flavor in the mouth. Damned good APA."
"D- I don't think this is high in alcohol but who knows. I could see this being sessionable as it isn't at all cloying or harsh on the palette in the way some hoppier brews can be."
"A different IPA. Tasty nonetheless. Again the malt is sweet and bready and engulfs the mid palate. Hints of grassy floral hops with a nice hop bitterness on the finish that finishes sweet again. Not much going on otherwise but a easy drinker on a warm day."
"All in all, a pretty decent beer."
"Overall, simply Awesome APA. One of the best I've ever had, bar none."
"Nothing spectacular but a good solid brew."
"D: Very drinkable/sessionable."
"Hopalicious pours a hazy, coppery-golden in color, topped by a voluminous pale tan head. The head itself is creamy and rocky and exhibits excellent retention with good lacing as well. The nose is very good, being one part orange-citrus, another part lemon rind, with an English ale yeast topping it off. Best of all is the rush of Cascade hops as this beer is cracked and poured. Semi-sweet and lightly tart on the first sip, this one leans well-toward the dry end of the spectrum. Light biscuity malt notes linger along with a mild and comforting bitterness. Fairly soft on the palate yet exhibiting adequate carbonation, this has a rather smooth, round mouthfeel. Definitely worth picking up another six the next chance I get!"
"Drinkability: Pretty good APA, but not my favorite. Would definitely try again."
"Wow! This is just great beer!! Poured with a nice frothy foamy head and some lace. Hazy amber color. Very hoppy aroma with some malt and caramel in there. I don't pick up on the citrus; but, I do get a real dry chewiness. Great mouth. Satisfying with a clean pleasant finish. Superb session beer."
"Smell is a punch of citric cascade hops. Almost IPA like, but refreshing. No malt filler. This is all cascade hops in their full glory. Very drinkable and sessionable. Very straightforward and simple for when you are in he mood for something easy and enjoyable. I found myself wanting more when the pint glass was empty."
"Some may find the hop character/bitterness lacking, regardless this is a truly enjoyable brew."
"Well worthwhile."
"If you're an IPA drinker who has all but given up on APAs, try Hopalicious. It's hopariffic!"
"D: This is a fantasticly easy drinking APA. It's got fruity hops and spicy hops, and sweet malt and toasted malt.I'd love to sample this on draught."
"My introduction to microbrewed beers back in the late 80's started with the pale ale style with beers like Sierra Nevada PA and Anchor Liberty. I liked them back then, but through the years, they seem to have become milder and milder tasting to my palate. Heck, with all the aggressive IPAs as well as DIPAs on the market now, no wonder a ""simple"" pale ale seems so mild now. With that being said, Hopalicious is certainly one of the better American-style pale ales I've had in a while. The bitterness is decent, but not too strong, and there's plentiful hop aroma and flavor. It's a clean-tasting brew which goes down easily. It's probably not a a true session-beer in the ""English sense", but it's about as sessionable a beer as you'll find in most pubs in the States. Given the choice, I would pick this brew over almost any other standard American pale ale on the market. This beer has such great hop character without being high in alcohol. I could go for more micros which are modest in alcohol, yet are bursting with an extremely fresh dry-hopped flavor/aroma character found in this very clean-tasting brew."
"This is a good brew. I am very satisfied with the flavor and the balance. As with buying in a growler the beer needs to be drank sooner rather than later...I feel I lost some of the crispness this beer had to offer waiting 2 days to review after my first pint."
"D-I had some of this fresh and it was remarkably better. After a few months in the fridge, it got a bit oxidized with a loss of hops. Needless to say, this a nice overall example of a micro APA."
"D-Ale Asylum is one of my favorite local breweries in the Madison area, and I will buy this again, but not until late spring when it would better match the climate. The taste is enjoyable, and the body is not altogether lacking, but between the two there is some imbalance."
"D - drinks quite well. I had enough taste buds left after this to appreciate either another one or my dinner."
"Pours a orange-ish/ yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, grapefruity hops dominate anything else. In the taste, a small sticky sweet grapefruity hop, small but effective. A small bitter mouthfeel and a dry grapefruity hop aftertaste. Nice bitter and hops, easy to drink."
"Pours a murky sunset orange with a fluffy white two finger head that slowly descends to a frothy layer. Stickiness is damn good, lots of lacing on the sides. Smell is of fresh pine and the slightest bit of citrus. Some caramel malt and some dirty earth-like aromas tickle the nose as well. Pretty dry smell overall, but not in a bad way. Taste is a slick pine flavor with some sweet malt as well. The sweetness seems to over power the hops a bit. Aftertaste is white bread like with a lingering grassy flavor. Medium bodied with a creamy carbonation. I figured this would be a bit hoppier by the name, but it still doesn't disappoint. Look forward to getting my hands on Ambergeddon one of these days."
"Pours a honey-golden hue with a finger and a half of a eggshell white crown. Very few bubbles rising to the top of this beer and the crown is slowly diminishing. The aroma is exquisite, its soft yet strong with a blend of floral and citrus and a touch of malt underneath. As I let the beer warm up a little, the flavor becomes much more pronounces. There is a nice hoppyness to this beer but it fades a bit too quickly. The body is somewhat light and the finish is dry. Mouthfeel is less than average and drinkability is also average. This was my first Ale Asylum beer, was hoping for a bit more flavor than I got. Still a decent beer."
"Overall, this beer was a letdown (I hesitate to use stronger language), and was just another in a line of beers trying to be hoppy for the simple sake of being hoppy, with nothing else to offer. Fellow IPA, APA, DIPA drinkers, avoid this one if you can."
"Some might clamor for more malt assertion, but that's not what this is about. It's like an IPA-Light, juicy as hell, but stripped of untoward bitterness, and showcasing boring-old Cascades in a new light. For those suffering burnout of said hop, this is a revitalizer...it was for me."
"This brew is pretty darn good though not a bit of residual sweetness, odd for a Pale Ale. I like this much but wish maybe a bit more balance."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is definitely a great beer to drink for a whole evening. I think I could drink quite a few of these and not look for anything else. This is one of the best APA's that I've had."
"This beer should satisfy any hophead. Went and purchased a six of bottles the next day."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with a good blast of bubbles. Goes down easy and is quite refreshing as a good APA should be. I enjoyed this brew and could easily have a few more. A tasty Cascade bomb of an APA that also does a good job of packing in the hops without much bitterness. Maybe just needs a little more in the malt department though. Check this one out!"
"If you are in the Madison area, you need to stop by Ale Asylum and sample this beer - very good."
"The drinkability is ok, but that lingering bitterness is not as pleasent as other IPAs. It's good but not great."
"This golden ale is very solid, though maybe a little light colored for an APA, but has a big,clean head that lingers on top. Hoppy nose with big citrus but a little bit grassy underneath. Light, sweet body with the IPA level hops. I think a real hop head beer. Hops, for me, are a bit overboard for the base of the beer, but truly accent the hops and lives up to the name. If it 's what you want and love--drink up. I enjoyed the three I drank over the course of my fantasy football draft."
"D- solid pale ale, enjoyable."
"Sweet, toasty, hoppy, and excellently drinkable...I could be fond of this. Glad I grabbed a 6-pack..."
"poured from a 12oz bottle into a nonic, this was a clear orange-copper in color. nutty, flowery, and citric in the nose. a hint of something else as well, maybe honeyed, buttered biscuits is the best way i can describe it. taste is a light malt sweetness balanced by a lighter than expected hop bitterness. light, crisp mouthfeel that is a bit thin for the style. not sure about the abv but it must be in the 4-5% range. that, along with the interesting nose makes the drinkability just ok."
"These guys are new - will give them time to work out the kinks."
"Very fine mouthfeel with a low level of carbonation that accentuates the malt that is there. Lovely session APA that I'd love to have available to me regularly. Bottle 6 of a six pack."
"I was pleasantly surprised by Mad Town Nut Brown and I'm also pleased with Hopalicious. These guys better be careful or they'll start being mentioned in the same breath with Lake Louie, New Glarus, Tyranena and Capital. If you're looking for a well-brewed Cascade pale ale, Ale Asylum will be only too happy to oblige."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, mildly sweet, yeasty, a bit tart of the citrus notes."
"Appearance is a hazy pineapple juice color, with minimal head that clung to the side of my glass. Aroma was very fruity; it smelled like peaches to me. Taste was also very fruity; I got more peach and apricot. It was very good. Mouthfeel was quite smooth, with very fine carbonation. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"D: Too dry for my tastes. I think I would have liked some sweetness to balance out all the dryness. I thought with all the caramel in the nose it would have been a bit maltier."
"This APA pours a cloudy golden in to my mug with a frothy white head that lingers nicely and leaves a nice lacing. The aroma is very high Cascade hops. There is absolutely no mistaking what is in the beer, an in your face citrusy Cascade bonanza. Any malt aroma is very low, maybe a hint of sweetness. The flavor is through the roof with hop flavor. Very fresh, grapefruit-like citrus hop flavor, but the hop bitterness is nicely done at a moderately to moderately-high bitterness. The bitterness is rather clean and as advertised strikingly less than what the smell would lead on. The finish leaves just enough hop flavor on the palate, but not to the point where it is overwhelming. The carbonation is medium, as is the body, and the drinkability, despite the intensity of the hop flavor and aroma is rather high. Overall I enjoyed this beer very much. I think the aroma and flavor of the hops are in your face without lingering to the point where it is over done. The lower hop bitterness than one might expect I think keeps the beer from being out of control. I would highly recommend this beer if you enjoy a fresh American citrusy hop flavor and aroma"
"Like opening a bag of fresh, whole leaf flower Cascades, Hopalicious delivers a bright, resinous and citrusy hop nose!!! The body is a hazy golden-amber, beneath a creamy white head that holds well and leaves patchy ""walls"" of spotty lace in its wake. The Cascade hops continue into the flavor with resinous notes of citrus (grapefruit, lemon, pineapple) and pine over a lightly caramelish and just slighty biscuity malt base. The bitterness is well balanced, and it finishes dry and subtly acidic with some lingering notes of piney and grassy hops. Quite nice! An impressive APA that takes the hop flavor and aroma of an IPA, and jams it into a standard strength ale. Very west coast! Remarkably drinkable despite the intense hop charge. Very well done!"
"Misty copper apricot body below a finger of soft, plush, off-cream head. Fresh hop nose; mostly pine sap and ganja resins. Some powdered sugar. Nice. Taste is all about the hops as well. Bitter, pungeant hop resins throughout. Some candied fruit malt and light biscuit, but not enough to balance. Hop flavor in the finish is a tad stale, but plenty bitter. Light bodied APA with a lightly creamy feel. Puckeringly dry finish. Decent."
"Drinkability/Overall: a less robust version of their Ambergeddon with less aggressive hops and less malt complexity and more grassy lightness. Remains quite tasty and thoroughly drinkable."
"A Hazy copper/brown brew with a thin tan head. Lacing is excellent, leaving a nice trail as you drink. Looks very nice. Nose is hops and maybe a little pine. Taste is strong cascade hops, some balancing malts in the middle, and a bit of sour fruit. Like grapefruit and lemon, but not sweet at all. Mouthfeel is nice, it's not too thin and goes down smoothly, with some tingly carbonation. Drinkability is decent as well."
"D- This beer has big juicy hops and the ginger is a perfect amount to give the hops a twist but not being a ginger dominated beer. Whenever I am in Madtown again this will be the first beer I seek out."
"drinkability: pretty good despite the bitterness"
"A rather interesting and unique brew that suffers from one deep flaw  a complete lack of finish. Otherwise, Hopalisious stands on its own. Bright orange amber with a thin creamy white head, this brew looks just great. The aroma is strongly citric and obviously Cascade. Flavor is uniquely nectarine skins, subtlety bitter without any of the pine or juniper that sometimes comes with oodles of Cascade hops. This beer is nearly perfectly balanced. It has immense citric flavor without more than a slight bitterness and yet I am not entirely happy. This is because the front offers a perfect medley of citrus while the finish offers nil. This beer dies after the each sip and that is simply unforgivable in an APA. Strong potential and otherwise magnificent, but still lacking any finish."
