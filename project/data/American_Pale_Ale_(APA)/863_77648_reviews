"Great flavor.  A lot lighter than typical RR hoppy beers in a good way."
""
"A really excellent APA. I think this deserves consideration alongside the best APAs in the business."

""
"Fav RR beer by far. Citrusy hoppy well balanced all in your face."

"Love this brew, another quintessential classic from RR. Pours a nice rich light copper color with a lite white head that wisps away quickly. Classic west coast pale ale. The 100% smicoe hopping makes it even better!"

"One of my favorite beers at Russian River. I usually take advantage and drink Row 2 over Pliny or Blind Pig, or even some of the sours because it's not bottled.  Top notch pale ale that can compete with any other beers in it's style category.  Just right with hoppiness and abv.  Had it on tap at the Russian River bar area.  Ask for a sample if unsure."

"Had on draft two successive days on a visit to CA.  The first time I tried it I didn't know the ABV and guessed that it was around 7%, not because you could taste alcohol, but because there was so much flavor.  Hop forward with plenty of citrus, missing some of the pineyness that I expect from west coast ales and substituting tropical and earth notes, riding a sufficient and perfectly complimentary malt backbone.  I find single hop beers to have more personality than usual, and not always in a good way,  but here  RR nails it.  I've almost stopped drinking pale ales because they are less interesting to me than IPAs, but this is one I sorely wish was available locally."

"perhaps one of the finer american pales happening right now. i can recall very few that do what this one does, which is showcase a hop varietal brilliantly, without being filling, boozy, or tiring. this is so clean and light on the palate, golden in color and frothy to the feel. the hops are simcoe i think, but its such a delicate usage. not delicate in flavor, they are dripping resins and citrus notes, but they never get heavy or bitter like they sometimes do in other beers, quite often really. i never miss the bitterness here, and i dont wish for a more complex grain bill. i think its straightforward nature is impressive. not trying to cover flaws with tons of esoteric grains or anything, its just perfectly made beer. there are a few pales i like as much, but not one i can think that i really like better or would prefer to have a steady stream of, this is top tier."

"I can't help but think of Row 2 as a more hop forward, single IPA version of Pliny. The drinkability factor is off the charts, the IBUs and the tropical juiciness continue to shine with each pour. Row 2 is a sensational IPA that comes highly recommended."

"Part of a sampler at the brewery. this one poured a clear light golden with a small white head. Not much aroma, which was unexpected. smell of light pine and a hint of citrus peel backed by some very lightly sweet malts. Simcoe grapefruit flavor dominates alongside some piney medium bitter on the tongue. Resinous yet dry finishing pine, medium plus carbonation, and super easy drinking. A really nice beer, but one that I was expecting more from. I will have to try and revisit this one."

"This is a truly sippable, rather than gulpable, Pale Ale. I was glad to have the chance to try this, and it's great to taste a less intense yet pleasurable beer than their usual over-hopped IPAs ."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light/medium body with low-ish carbonation. Mouthfeel seems about right, maybe could use a little more carbonation for me. Drinks about to its ABV. Overall, a really nice pale ale that I would have again. Good one."

"This really pushes IPA and surely is a Russian River beer with huge amount of hops. It really has tons of flavor at this ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is probably one of the best APAs I've ever had. It showcases the simcoe hops extremely well in a full-bodied, incredibly drinkable APA. Its like how Zombie Dust showcases the Citra hops so well. Vinnie really should bottle more of this beer."

"Huge thanks to yamar68 for this bottle. Bottled on 08/26/13 and served into a tulip glass. Pours a crystal clear amber body with two fingers of thick sudsy bone white foam. Awesome lacing and retention. Aroma is very pine and grapefruit forward with just a touch of crackery malts. Bitter grapefruit leads into resinous pine and smooth bready malts. Falls a bit flat towards the end but then again it is a pale and not an IPA. Very tasty and refreshing. Mouth feel is coating and sticky. This is just a solid, no frills pale ale. Damn good stuff, mmm simcoe!"
"Has a fruity malty hoppy bitter peachy finish."

"Piney hops come across with a dry finish. Nice use of bitterness and hop flavor working togather to create a very nice pale."
""

"O-this is the beer that sets the bench mark for drinkability. i've never in my life had a beer so savory. i can drink this like water. it definitely reminds me more of the ""day time/all day"" IPAs. it's so much more fresh and clean that most APAs."

"Simply the best Pale Ale I've ever had, the new benchmark. After the sampler set at RR, I was planning on ordering the Pliny, but I ended up getting this instead. Blew my mind! So hoppy for a pale ale, move over Lagunitas Dogtown! Thank you Simcoe hops!"

"Simcoe is very evident from the outset, almost to the point of smelling it before the glass officially hits the table. Great malt balance as well, not just one dimensional. Really nice beer, would love to have this as a regular in the midwest."

"Served in a pint - pretty excited to try this. An exceptional APA - grassy and fresh, bright citrus flavors, orange peel, lemon, nice malt balance. Juicy - 100% simcoe, true class. I'd likely pick this over Blind Pig any day of the week. Wish I had access."

"D/O: This pale ale is enjoyable for the balance it displays, despite also featuring focused--if a little simplistic--hops qualities. Side-by-side it matches the look of Russian River's Pliny the Elder immediately after pouring, although that other beer coats the glass better. Although the aroma is shy and tends to hide, the flavor stands up to expectations."

"Overall - this is one fantastic beer. If you love hops; this one's for you. If I could use one word to describe this brew I would say ""balanced."" Nothing overpowers your nose or mouth and this beer begs you to take another sip. Great job Russian River!"

"Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub. A big hoppy pale, featuring Simcoe hops. Light orange head and lace sheet. Very good drinkability.Well malted, providing above average mouthfeel.Bang on the style, juicy orange citrus.Best beer of the night, and of the newest RR on tap."
""
""
"Not as well balanced as the other Russian River beers sampled last night, but I enjoyed it enough to buy a second pint and am disappointed that bottles weren't available."

"On tap. pour is a clear golden orange with a creamy white head. Nose is tight with light malt caramel and some nice grainy malt. Good hop profile, notes of citrus and strong herbal presence. Taste is balanced, dry finish, tight balance, grain and faint sweet caramel with citrus and herbal hops."
""
""
""
""
"O: great beer overall. Well put together, and a really interesting hop flavor. Once it warms a bit mroe it has more smell."

"T: A great blend of citrus hops, grapefruit, orange, lemon and a touch of pine. A nice malt backbone with some notes of caramel and cracker hold the beer up nicely. Really good stuff."
""
""
"Pours a light to mid orange with with a monstrous white head. Great lacing throughout. Really hop sticky aroma. Citrus, grapefruit and orange, dank pine and some earthy qualities. Nice light, but hop showcasing flavor profile. Very nice citrus notes to start. Orange, grapefruit and a hint of tropical notes. A sticky, fresh and earthy pine hop follows that adds a bit of bittering on the tongue. Finishes very light and dry, much like the flavor profile. This is a awesomely, single hopped Pale Ale."
""
"O- One of my favorites APA's, and is more true to the style. Up there with Zombie Dust and such, although I feel its a stretch to call ZD an APA. But thats another discussion"
""
""
"Big time flavor on a microscopic abv'ed beer. Highly drinkable. Another winner from Russian River. Thanks kawilliams82."
""
"Flavor snaps, with a clear citrus squeeze and some light bitterness. This goes down all too easily. Definitely one I’ll have again."
""
""
""
"Big thanks goes out to BilbosNuts for this one! Served from bottle into a COAST Willi. Poured a nice golden yellow with slight orange hue with a two finger slightly off-white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, grapefruit, grapefruit hop, fruit, and very subtle pine. The flavor was of sweet malt, tropical fruit, citrus, citrus hop, grapefruit hop, fruit, and subtle grapefruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really intrigued by this one upon seeing its release from the brewery. I know RR is good at making IPA/IIPAs so I wanted to see what they could do with an APA. I can honestly say that they did quite a nice job on this one. The simcoe is a very nice hop and this brew definitely showcases this fact throughout each sip and especially in the aroma. This brew also brings a very nice balance of flavor and aroma with it as well to keep your palate intrigued throughout. Up there as one of the best APAs I’ve had, but not quite up to Zombie Dust standards as I would have LOVED to find."

"O: A great pale ale. Excellent showcase of the simcoe hop."
""
""
"Medium bodied with tight carbonation and a spicy, floral hop bite up front that provide some dry bitterness that lingers throughout.  This is countered mid-palate by pale malt, subtle citrus and some light fruit.  Bitter but not too much so with the perfect amount of dryness that's countered by bready yeast, biscuit and pale malt.  I'm also picking up hints of straw, apple and pear.  Well balanced with great hop flavor making this beer very quaffable."

"Fuckin eh, another homerun for Russian River."
""
""
""
"O: Having drank 5 or 6 growlers of this, I think I'm prepared to say I like this beer. However, it's a poster child for craft beer inflation; its $6 / bottle asking price at my local shop is simply too much for an APA. I think Russian River also found this out the hard way, as they distributed more to local stores after it apparently didn't sell out at the pub. I'll drink the shit out of this in growler form, though..."
""
"Drinkability is high. This is a fantastic pale ale. Wow. Love it!"
""
"O- nice pale that's not overpowered by the spicy hops which is good by me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle date is 6/26. This one pours a light bodied unpolished gold in clor with a very soapy two finger head. The nose is fresh and like sticking your face in a bucket of Smcoe. It's light and floral and the malt certainly takes a backseat. I do appreciate how pale the malt is, allowing the hops to shine. The flavors too are hoppy, clean, and floral. There is also a perfumey essence. I love how straightforward it is. Simcoe isn't my favorite hop varietal but that doesn't phase me from cherishing this beer. It would be fun to see what other hop varietals could do with this recipe. It drinks light and is very smooth. Overall this is a great pale. I would place it behind Zombie Dust and the Hill Farmsteads but that already puts it in an elite class."
"bottle"
"Just an outstanding Pale Ale, venturing into IPA territory but retaining a nice light drinkability."
""
""
"Taste is similar to the smell with the citrus hops being at the forefront, light sweet malt presence, it not smack you in the face hopy like Russian River typically does but instead is a well rounded APA."
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a taster glass. A good 1"" of thin white head sits on top of a light yellow body. The aroma is huge grapefruit. Not like this surprises me. Aroma on Russian River beers always seem to smack you in the face. Taste is nice and clean. Great balance. I'm not to sure if I can recall another single hopped pale ale, but I know that from now on this will be at the top of the list when anybody asks me if I'd had one. I could drink this beer all day. Super sessionable."
""
""
"O - This is one helluva APA. So much flavor for the lowish ABV. As good or better than Zombie Dust. Wow."
"Just had another, liked it even better this time."
"O- This was a very good APA, definitely one of the better ones I've had. I might even say I prefer drinking it over Zombie Dust. I liked how it a nice light lemony citrus hop taste to it. Definitely a nice summer beer. I recommend any APA fan to try this."
""
""
"O: The aromas alone are worth getting the bottle. I'd like to see more flavor but I liked it."
"500ml bottle dated 6/26 so this was three weeks old when I drank it, perfect. Thanks to bugdoc for sending this to me, appreciate it man. Orange yellow appearance, good head and lacing. Smells like simcoes, hints of cat pee, delicious. Mouthfeel is thick. Flavor is delicious simcoes with a good maltiness. This is a great hoppy pale ale but not something I would probably drink a whole sixer (not that I could ever get one) because it was a little chewy. Very glad to have had a shot at this beer."
"One of the best in the world. I've drank a little more than a gallon of this stuff the past week, between having it on tap, getting a growler of it and about a dozen bottles, and the coolest part about it is how sometimes the pineapple is just nuts, those are my favorite bottles."
"O - It's a really awesome beer except that the flavor is just boring. Nothing to wow you or keep your attention. It's very drinkable though."
"O: Definite similarities to SNPA in flavour and mouthfeel. A very good product, Russian River always puts out great hoppy beers."
"A- pour produces a 1-1/2 finger white head resting of a pale golden body. Good retention and lacing. 4.5 "
"A"
"Overall - Simcoe may not be everyone's favorite hop, but this is well done for what the hop delivers."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer highlights the hops quite well, but it's a bit of a letdown in light of Russian River's other offerings."
"B-"
""
"Overall a superb pale ale. More please!"
""
""
""
"O: this beer is at the top of its class even beating so called IPAs on the shelf. Really well balanced and great hop forward pale ale. I expected nothing less from RR."
""
""
"Pours a clear golden amber color with a tall white head. Nice fresh citrus hoppiness. Tons of grapefruit, lots of tangerine as well. Pine and a hint of grass with sweet bready malt. The flavor is a bit sweet, but good pine and grapefruit. A little bit of floral hop character as well. Nice beer, easy to drink."
""
""
"A pretty good beer overall, but I was a bit disappointed overall. That being said, I’d still give it another go."
""
""
"Picked up a couple fresh specimens this afternoon. First time with this brew. Poured into my tulip the brew is a pleasant pale copper with a nice inch thick cap of foam that reveals nice lacing as I drink down. The nose is fragrant with bright citrus, sticky resiny pine, all things Simcoe.Flavors falls right in line with red grapefruit, bitter lemon peel and bitter pine sap on a crisp dry mouth that leaves behind a very pleasant unique biting orange peel note. A delicious APA, much needed here on the west coast in a sea of sameness with this style beer. Very drinkable and almost sessionable at 5.8 abv. It's not Zombie Dust, but it's a serious APA for all of you that seek out quality in this style."
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a great APA, and another great hoppy beer from Russian River. The nose is super hoppy and full of citruus and pine, and the taste is great too. Glad to see them bottling this one, will love to have it again."
""
"Drink- Call it an APA its fine. Ill stick with a small IPA all day long. I'd like another bottle on a hot day but wont go crazy trying to find one."
""
""
""
"very easy to drink, very flavorful and never overpowering. light malt lets the simcoe shine."
"O-A wonderful, refreshing and most of all balanced beer. RR really knows how to craft balanced hoppy brews."
""
""
"O: Overall, excellent. Big citrus and pine, although not as profound as say an IPA or IIPA but the citrus and pine are profound above anything else. Delicious and session-able. A real winner here."
"The beer is very nice, a great summer drinker I wish I could just session all day!"
"O: This is a very good hoppy APA, and I feel like I'm being a little picky on the flavor profile. Still, it doesn't quite rise to the world-class category in my opinion. I would certainly drink some more, however."
""
"O - quite tasty offering and can't wait for the next in the series."
""
"O: A great hoppy APA, this beer is very tasty and highly drinkable. I hope Russian River continues to produce this ale, as I will definitely buy more. Cheers!"
""
""
"Overall, highly drinkable and enjoyable. Another tasty offering from an outstanding brewery."
"One finger pure white head, small bubbles, over medium gold clear body, multiple streams of rising carbonation. Nose is a combination of fruitiness, grapefruit pith, clean non-assertive malt with a bit of pine resin. Taste mirrors nose, more fruity than malty until the pine notes set in on the back end, increasingly so as it warmed. Mouthfeel on the light side of medium, good effervescence. A real revelation re single hop APA, glad I got the last glass before the keg blew. One of the hoppier APAs I've had, and one of the best tastewise. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"OK, OK, Russian River. I give up. How did you perform this magic trick with Simcoe? This is gorgeous stuff, like no Simcoe I've ever had before—to me Simcoe was flabbily and lazily hoppy, giving citrus and oily pine with residual sweetness that always detracted from the beer. This is fragrant, juicy, tight and delicious. I'm just going to put it down to your skill."
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0) - A fine showcase for Simcoe in an extremely sessionable pale ale. Really seems more like a diet IPA with all that fruit and pine. The aroma is killer, and the taste follows suit, but I feel that the slightly watery texture loses some points for this beer, which is still a great product overall."
"Well done Vin and crew. You hit this outta the park."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- this is a very well made beer that shows off Simcoe. No flair needed here. It does lack the hop complexity that Blind Pig and Pliny have but it is refined and delicious in its own way. Very drinkable as well."
"Russian River takes seemingly their favorite hop varietal, Simcoe and formulated a pale ale to showcase it's very robust aromas and flavors. What Row 2/Hill 56 turned out to be is a fantastically hoppy pale that has a malt/hop ratio that isn't all that dissimilar to their legendary Pliny the Elder. Very crisp and amazing pale ale that really allows the Simcoe hop to shine!"
"O - Another amazing hoppy beer from RR, who continues to produce some of the best beers in the country. I would drink this all day/every day along some of the top APA's out there (Edward, Parking Violation, Hoppy Birthday, and What Is Enlightenment, to name a few)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel is at about light and really easy drinking here. A pint is easy and the 2nd if i got one would of been easier to drink. A nice pale ale with flavor that wont hit you over the head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very excellent brew for sure. I'm glad I got to try this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hugging the line between a hoppy APA and an IPA is a beautiful place. The lighter abv and body are a welcome treat. I realize at 5.8% this isn’t a traditional session beer, but man it’s close. I am hoping that other brewers realize this is a great space and continue to produce beers like this. Kudos Russian River. Well done."
"Nice bronzed ale with a finger of light yellow foam and brilliant clarity. Smells of tropical fruits, pineapple most notably, with grapefruit and mango in there as well. Fantastic nose. Taste follows suit with a really citrusy, fruity flavor and lighter biscuity malts - Fantastic flavor I can only imagine would be even greater a week earlier. Medium bodied with lively carb and a wet finish. Man, this is a great beer, I hope they bottle it as i've heard might be in the works. Really, really delicious beer."
"I had a few pints at the brewpub. It pours a gorgeous shade of gold, relatively pale. Nice white head and lots of lacing. The aroma has a ton of flowery hop aroma. It's a mouth-watering mix of bright citrus, tangerine, lemon, some tropical fruit (pineapple/mango) and light spruce/pine. Just wonderful. Some light sugary caramel malt peeks through the hops. The beer is dry and light on the palate. There's a gentle caramel backbone with definite but light bitterness. It's very easy to drink. I keep using the word light but it's a very flavorful lightness. For my palate, it's perfectly balanced and as good of a session-ish IPA (not really sure what to call these APAs that are dry and hopped up like IPAs/DIPAs) as I've had. The finish is crisp with more marvelous floral hop character. It's an excellent beer. I still remember liking Hopfather a touch more, so I'll stick with 4.5s, but this is an absolutely worthy edition to RR's APA/IPA/DIPA lineup."

"I've been brewing pale ales lately and man, I wish I could brew something like this. I like the hoppiness and malt base. It's something you'd find in an IPA, but it's not high in ABV. I love a beer that I can have a couple of without being too tipsy."

"Pours a clear golden peach color with a white head and nice retention. Tropical nose and citrus hops with light pine and pale malt. Mild flavor compared to the nose, but pleasantly fruity and sweet, particularly mango like hops. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very nice and easy drinking."
"O - A nice fragrant and light IPA. Perfect way to start my day."
""
"So this is a single hopped (simcoe) pale ale. And of course, it's got heavy hops goin' on. Salty piney goodness. Consistent, full, and extremely tasty. I would expect nothing less from RR, so I'm glad this is so well done. Only detractor is a salty aftertaste. My first beer at the brewpub, and a good way to start."

"D - This is ridiculous. Could substitute for water. I'm kind of hoping none of my friends stop by to try this, as I could easily put away the entire 2L. I'm actually a tad surprised this is almost 6% - other than a slow-growing buzz there's nothing to suggest any alcohol content at all. Gee, who would have guessed that Russian River could make (another) world-class hoppy pale ale? Not quite as good as Hoppy Birthday, but pretty excellent nonetheless."
"Pours a clear peach color with a nice white head and pretty good retention. Nice lacing as it falls to a collar. The nose carries some tropical fruits along with a bit of citrus and a touch of pine. Really nice nose with multiple dimensions. It's not particularly over the top, either. Flavor is similar, but scaled back a little too much. Body is light-medium with good carbonation and a solid bitterness. Quite good."
"O: Recommended if unremarkable. Would drink again as a tasty IPA."
""
"Beer is light to medium in body and smells better than it tastes, the beer is good though, nice finish, good body, nice mild bitterness at the end, good throughout. I could easy pound pints of this beer for a long time. Very enjoyable."
"The beer is like an IPA up front, but feels lighter and finishes without a lot of sticky residue. This actually has a really similar flavor profile as Pliny the Elder...just turned down a notch. It's like PtE's little bro. Could it be the most session-able pale I've encountered? Right up there. Hope to have this again."
"Verdict: Fantastic pale ale from Russian River. Currently a draft and growler only option, but soon to be available in bottles and I can not be more excited. For anyone near the brewery, this is worth the trip!"
"Pours a clear honey orange with a bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is quite awesome with herbal and earthy hops, citrus zest, and some slight tropical fruit aromas. Taste is the same with a malty finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I really enjoyed the aroma more than the taste."
"Simply awesome, though I do believe Humulus Wet, Zombie Dust, and Hoppy Birthday are just slightly better."

"On tap at brewery for Beat release. Pours a nice, clear, bright, golden orange color with an inch of white, frothy head. Scent has that typical Russian River hoppy beer aroma...so fresh and piney. Lovely citrus mixed with sappy pine tree aroma. So inviting! Taste is just as good... probably the most user-friendly pale ale they offer (from ones that I've had). Not as flavorful as the nose would seem to imply, but so much complexity to make this beer as light as it is...it's ridiculous. Lovely ""in your face"" DIPA flavors, just mellowed out a pit to suit the pale ale profile. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is light bodied and crisp...refreshing. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is one fantastic pale ale from RR...as expected."
""
"O- Phenomenal beer. Another glorious showcase of hops by the master. Pray to the beer gods that they bottle this one in the future!"
"Recent trends in American Pale Ales continue to push the hop envelope further with increased levels of bittering and a more pronounced hop character. Zombie Dust is a great example of this and Row 2/Hill 56 isn't far behind. Excellent flavor, balance, and drinkability make this an exceptional beer and one I'm glad to have a growler of."
"O: Enjoyed every drop, so I got another. Do yourself a favor and get this. Wonderful."
""
"Light body with soft and ample carbonation. Very refreshing and easy to drink beer."

"A vigorous pour results in three fingers of rocky white foam. As the head recedes it leaves intricate lacing along the sides of the glass. The beer is a deep amber color. The scent of oranges mingled with pine resin fills the air as I pour. This smells more like an IPA than a Pale Ale, and I must say that it smells great. Taste opens with huge citrus flavors. Orange, tangerine and mango intermingle with hoppy bitterness. A sugar cookie malt backbone imparts a bit of sweetness which plays nicely against the hops. The beer finishes semi-dry with a very subtle aftertaste. The beer is medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation. This brew is yet another masterpiece from Russian River. The malt melds seamlessly with the hop profile providing an incredibly balanced brew. Fruity, piney, and mildly bitter, the beer is insanely drinkable and very tasty. Well done Mr. Cilurzo. Keep up the good work!"
"From a growler. Pours a clear light amber with small white head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is big pine hops, some dankness, some light caramel , and a bit of grapefruit. This certainly smells amazing like most Russian River hoppy beers. The taste follows the nose, with pine, grapefruit, and a dankness. Just a enough malt comes through to balance it with a little bit of caramel and sugar cookie. The finish has a decent bitterness to it. Medium-light body. Moderate carbonation. Quite dry throughout. Another great Russian River beer."
"So I've split this one with my dad and am ruing my decision. I think the appropriate serving size for this beer is 2liters. As it warms up, it becomes increasingly juicy and delicious. The nose exudes a certain classiness and delicacy that really calls out for a slightly higher score. I want to up the scores, but I'm hesitant."
"Overall: It's a crime that this went under the radar while Younger was pouring. This is an incredible Pale Ale. Move aside, Parking Violation."
""
"Only thing lacking especially for the Pale Ale style was a malt backbone. Almost none to speack of. Just enough there to showcase the citrus hops upfront first and for most. Never had a more citrus forward pale although Zombie Dust just landed on my doorstep (thanks rfragga77) today and I'm currently in Tahoe. Only complaint for the style is that it should have a wee bit more malt but still, if this ins a Pale, give me this all day."
"D - Very drinkable. The hop flavor and aroma is just fantastic on this beer. It is so fresh and strong from start to end without being overpowering. The beer also stays quite sessionable."
"Overall-- I continue to be impressed by the hoppy beers coming out of Russian River... Maybe someday I'll be able to make the Younger release (or maybe Vinnie would allow some one a growler fill if I begged him hard enough!)"
"It's hard to find fault in this beer. I've got a soft spot for low ABV hop bombs, and this beer delivers. The only reason it's not a perfect 5.0 for me is because Alpine's Hoppy Birthday exists, but this is pretty damn close."
"O: A very clean, refreshing and flavorful beer. Hops were fresh and easy to drink. Bitterness is mellow. I am having no problem finish this growler myself."
"I'm looking forward to ""Segal Select", the next in the Hop Grower's series. And I just happen to have a growler of that waiting for me too!"

"O – I’m really happy to see a beer like this from RR. They were missing this from their line-up. This would easily become my go to pale ale if it was bottled. Its not exactly a “session beer” but at 5.8% abv its damn close. PLEASE BOTTLE THIS!"
""
""
"I guess on occasion I might like a pale ale with a bit more of a malt back bone, but otherwise this is as good as it gets, and so this is a beer that would be my ""go to"" pale ale were it available where I live. Tried a sample size glass at the brewpub and immediately had to have a full glass. Would be nice if this were around all the time (I assume it won't be), but regardless, this is another well made beer from the folks at RR."
""
""
"O- This is a great beer. I want this to be sold in bottles immediately. It's great. It very much reminds me of zombie dust and that is a really good thing. RR is awesome. Bottle it please!"

"This is a very nice pale ale from RR. Easy drinking yet it has a lot of complexity."
