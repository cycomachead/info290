"A great Pale Ale, I doubt this would really make it to May though (at least for my preferences) as it is the fresh hop character that makes this beer so interesting. I have a feeling that if this beer is served below 53°F that the hop character wouldn’t be nearly so expressive and the light body could come off as being too light; sampled near 60°F + though, it is quite nice (especially once you knock out the excess carbonation."

"O: A very good Pale Ale with a great blend of hops. A refreshing beer that is easy to drink and in my case a great to cool off with after working on the car most of the afternoon."

"Overall, this beer is solid, not quite an IPA but still having a nice hop profile. Could be a bit fresher. Not quite balanced enough and, as I said before seems a bit messy and directionless. Almost went for too much here, but not bad. Very drinkable and good for everyday drinking or with friends. An alright seasonal."

"O - This is a nice beer, it is very pleasurable to drink. I don't think it really brings anything 'new' to the plate. That being said I would buy it again since it is a solid beer for a good price."
""
""
"Drinkability: This is definitely not as zesty or citrusy as I expected. The earthy and grassy hops dominate, which imparts a completely different character — though it is fitting. It is still drinkable and decent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid pale ale. Darker than most examples of the style. Tasty and drinkable nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"Poured this APA from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear pale amber color, produced an average white head, average retention and it left an average amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of fresh baked bread, citric lemon, white pepper and pears. Medium bodied, very smooth, there was a foundation of malted grain, balanced well with white pepper, herbal hops. Overall, decent session beer- average attempt at the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz from a six pack bought at MIssion Street Walmart in Salem Oregon. $6.97 Pours darker than the usual APA ..amber with a large thick and frothy creme coloured head. Nice light fruity,papaya,lime hop aromas.Some caramel malts. Taste again is caramel malt, but also a rather intense pipe tobacco/cigar ash taste, again some papaya but also plum pit...bitterness lingers than drops off strange but OK. Good palate..not thick but well rounded. Nice unusual APA."
""
"O-I really like Sorachi Ace hops, the lemon flavors they impart if nice and this a good example."
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Good beer. This seasonal is just right for a warm spring day, especially after a long hike. Well balanced between malts and hops, and between sweet and bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty average beer. Not a ton of flavor and slightly watery"
""
""
""

"O - pretty tastey and easy to drink but is more like an american amber than a pale ale. Was looking forward to the nelson sauvin hops because i purchased a few oz and wanted to see their flavor and aroma profile. But in this beer i only detect hop bitterness and little else. I have no problem drinking this but would rather buy a 12 pack of alaskan amber for less money and drink that."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty refreshing. Really does remind me of a somewhat lighter version of Fat Tire, with a bit more hops... more drinkable/sessionable than Fat Tire, in my opinion. A good beer in its own right, but pretty average, to me."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 5/19/2013. Pours crystal clear golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of lemon, mango, peach, pineapple, orange zest, grapefruit, light pine, floral, caramel, light honey, and bread. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes with good malt balance. Taste of lemon, peach, orange zest, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, pine, floral, light caramel, bread, and light honey. Light citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, tropical fruit, pine, floral, light caramel, bread, and light honey on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop notes; with a solid malt balance that still showcases hop flavor; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale ale. Damn nice complexity and balance of hop flavor with good malt balance; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O-I was hoping for a little more from this brew. The flavors are kind of timid, especially the hops, which you would think would put on more of a show. Perhaps I am too spoiled by pale ales in the Sierra Nevada style, but even if New Belgium was going for the more subtle, Belgian style pale, they could have giving this a little more flavor firepower."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"More of an amber than a pale ale, I thought that the hop profile would be much brighter in both aroma and taste. Underwhelming spring offering, bring back Mighty Arrow please."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-it's a different APA. It's not hoppy whatsoever. In fact, it reminds me more of a red ale really, or even a red lager. It's tasty though and super easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid and worth a shot, but I probably won't dig this one again as there are just better options in this class."
"The taste is sweet toasted bread from the malts and a nice lemony flavor that has some nice bitterness form the hops. I thought this was a very flavorful and refreshing beer... perfect for spring. I could enjoy this on a cold day or on a warm day in the sun... perfect for spring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Although there's nothing special about this one, there's nothing wrong with it either. It's a very enjoyable, easy to drink APA."
""
""
""
"Overall- Not my favorite NB, but it's really not too bad. It’s easy drinking and straightforward, the sorachi ace hop offers a different spin on the commonplace pale ale. Everything in this beer is really subtle and refined. It's not the most flavorful beer, but it's refreshing and clean. I’d try it again on draft"
""
""
"An excellent example of the style. I do tend to like my pale ales with more fruit esters, but if you like the west coast style hoppy IPAs but want something lighter, this will definitely fit the bill. Recommended."
""
"Not bad...but not really special. Reminds me of a higher quality amber ale, not really all that different from Fat Tire honestly."
""

"Alcohol shows through a little more than I'd like and it's lacking in hop flavor, otherwise it;s alright. Definitely not my favorite NB or my favorite pale."

"O: Really impressed with this beer for an easy drinking pale. Hoppy enough to meet your hop desires, yet super easy to drink. Definitely will visit this one again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice for the style, Above average but not top of the class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark, shiny copper orange with strong, persistent, hilly head, lovely! Nose is mild, some bitter notes, some malt, overall clean, cold and inviting. Taste is well balanced, refreshing, well integrated malt notes, bitterness entering slightly later, again well balanced. Mouthfeel is quick and refreshing, carbonation assertive but not scrubbing. A really nice PA, I'd be happy to drink at times. Would be low in the 'habit forming' area, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A well done pale ale, enjoyed seeing some different hop varieties used than the standard offerings."
""
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Overall, not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - As far as American Pale Ales go, this one is a pretty solid offering that does bring a fairly unique flavor, but not to an overwhelming level. That said, this beer is super drinkable, very smooth, and a solid choice for just relaxing, socializing, and enjoying the long overdue days of Spring."
"Overall: A very nice summer/spring beer. Its light for the style and very drinkable. That being said the hops take a back seat, more than I would like, for a pale ale. Cant complete with sessionable beers for drinkability for the time its released in my opinion. But still one of the better bottled pale ales for the season."
""
"Pours a nice copper amber having light head and lace. Nose is soft with sweetened light cereal from the malt and citrusy hops. Taste is also light almost dulling the malt and hops, nothing really stands out. A medium light mouthfeel with good carbonation. Overall nothing complex, but a fair brew that deserves a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On-tap at the brewery in Fort Collins. I also had it numerous times from the bottle and on tap around Colorado. Pours bright copper. Broad spectrum of nice hop flavor - earthy, minty, slightly citric, a hint of melon and pine. Bready, grainy malt with some caramel sweetness. Nicely done - the hops could be a little more pronounced and vibrant but this definitely captures the feeling of a spring day in Colorado."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with noticeable, but ""soft"" carbonation that creates a very smooth, flowing mouthfeel. A bit more carbonation would be desirable, I think it would express the hop combinations in the beer a bit more, which is needed here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The flavor profiles in this were not my favorite. A decent IPA, but not one I’ll have again."
""
"O - A sessionable amber with some interesting hop notes, probably originating from the Sorachi Ace. Aroma has died greatly in this dated, but refrigerated sample. Get it fresh."
"I've had this many times from the bottle, but I finally had it on tap at the Pantry on 3/22/13 and it just reaffirms how much more I like draft beer. This poured a deep amber color like tree sap with almost no light penetration. The head was generous, puffed up and the color of fresh pizza dough, leaving great lacing all over the glass. The smell was very much west-coast hop resins and oily citrus fruits. There was lots of lemon zing and some grass notes as well. The taste and mouthfeel made a good show on the palate. It was a good medium mouthfeel with that zing and crisp finish. The taste was pretty sweet, again like lemons and maybe some oranges with a good strong bittering finish. Overall a very good showing of a true american pale."
""
""
""
"Nice choice for a spring seasonal. I'll probably get some more, before it's too late."
"O- nice, easy drinking pale ale...maybe a little overly dank, but I can't complain about much"
""
""
"4.13/5.00"
""
""
""
"A decent option when looking for a straightforward pale ale that doesn't douse you in hops. Or at least not pungent hops. Not much in the way of distinguishing malt flavors. A decent option to have, but nothing that is going to make me rush out for a second purchase. Standard fare for the most part in this neck of the woods."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the fruitiest APAs that I have encountered, and it doesn't even involve fruit. It's an interesting twist to the style, and I like it. This was much better than I expected."
""
""
"pours a slightly hazy deep golden orange with a light tan head and some lace. The nose has some doughy bread, very light grain, hint of peppery spice, faint citrus and grassy hops. The taste follows the nose to a t, very doughy with a light hop, strong carbonation and soft body, light and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty well balanced ale."
""
""
"Overall-Great beer. Drinkable. Cheers New Belgium!"
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: I think New Belgium has something here. They need to balance things out a bit first."
"Served from bottle into a New Belgium globe. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, caramel, and pine resin. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, pine, earth, and earthy hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. This was actually quite a surprise if I am honest. The aroma and flavor on this one were really quite well balanced and intense. Even the earthy character on this one tied in really nicely into the rest of the things going on here. Quite refreshing as well… Definitely worth trying if you get the chance or need a lawnmower beer."
""
"Overall - Kind of like a Fat Tire meets a SN Pale Ale. It reminded me more of a English IPA than a APA. Still a good beer that is worth a shot."
"**date on bottle: ""03JUN12"""
"Bottle to a nonic pint glass. Pours a clear amber orange with a finger of off white head and minimal lacing. Head dissappears quickly. Aroma is faint. Light grass and bread. Flavor is mild citrus, light caramel, and something sour that I can't place but do not like. Mouthfeel is thin and over carbonated. Sorry to say this beer will not be bought again. Not a very good Pale ale."
""
"It' not a showy beer, but it doesn't have any reason to be. It's refreshing and balanced, and remains a good quality product. I really hope that this isn't a seasonal beer, as it's fantastic. If it remains as such, I'll be looking forward to getting some around this time of the year."
"not a bad beer for summer days, it IS refreshing, it just lacks character in pretty much all aspects."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I am a fan of these sorachi hops. I like the light lemony flavor that it brings to the beer to over the malt backbone. The beer is well balanced and very drinkable, if not all that interesting or different. Good thing it's only 5.6% because I could see myself drinking quite a few of these in a row."
""
"Easy drinking ."
""
"Poured into a pint glass, this beer is crystal clear and is a light burnt bronze color. It has medium carbonation and is topped off with a nice semi thick white head that sticks around for a bit but eventually thins out into a fine layer of welcoming bubbles. There’s some pretty good lacing too! The aroma is a bit bland but citrus fruits like lemon and mild grapefruit come through, the malts are present with a slight hint of hops. It’s nice and crisp on the tongue; it really warms up your mouth. There’s a slight alcohol taste as you swallow, it’s slightly bitter over all and become a little sweeter in the aftertaste. This ale has a medium body to it and goes down pretty smooth."
"Overall, a solid pale ale with good bitterness and nice hop profile. Nice to see that NBB can do something with hops that I like."
""
""
""
"Overall: The key here is balance. Very mellow and drinkable. Insanely so. Nicely complex, but not so much that you wouldn't want a dozen of these in your fridge at all times. Nice drinking beer with tons of potential."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Was not expecting very much at ale from this pale ale and so I am very pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed how nice and sweet this pale ale was. I'm happy that New Belgium didn't decide to join in on the Hop madness that seems to be going around, and try jamming this pale ale full of IBU's like a lot of the other brewery's are doing right now with there, APAs, IPAs ans IIPAs. That being said though this pale ale definitely doesn't leave you particularly wanting in that category either. I really like how unique this pale ale is, it's definitely one worth remembering. It's mildness coupled with it's low ABV make this beer incredibly sessionable. I could definitely see myself enjoying this beer while doing some work outdoors. While hop heads may want to reach for something a bit more their style, anyone who considers themselves an all around beer lover should give this beer a shot."

""

""
""
"Overall, a nice seasonal effort by New Belgium that makes it standout just enough from other breweries' Spring releases."
""
""
"Overall a good beer but not great. Run of the mill pale ale with a lemony spring zest flavor thrown in."
"Will probably pick up some bottles to see how those are drinking."
"On tap at Our Den (IUPUI campus). Pours a nice decent mid-copper, semi-golden, very bright, with some very nice head and a bit of nice lacing. Nice sweet scent, bright and colorful in the nose, with a nice hit of hop bitterness (hard to discern, some citrus and some floral, but it's light). Nice flavors, with a wonderful sweet malt and a nice easy bitterness at the end, with some slight citrus and slight floral. Goes down very easy, a smooth and light spring pale ale."
""
""
"Overall - Great seasonal. Glad I picked this up."
""
""
"Overall - If I had to describe this beer in 6 words, it'd be 'Fat Tire with a hop kick'. Very good beer. Maybe my new favorite from NB."
""
"Overall this is a pretty tasty beer. I would definitely drink it again."

"I really liked this beer and I thought it was a really good example of an American Pale Ale. This beer had great balance and was very true to style, with just enough hops for the style. It had very good drinkability, it went down way faster then I expected, it was refreshing and crisp, it wasn't filling, and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention. I would be perfectly fine with drinking a six pack throughout the day. What I liked most about this beer, was just about everything, with the balance being one of the highlights of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was the fact that I can't buy it in Michigan, if I could it might be one of my go to American Pale Ales. I would for sure buy this again if I was somewhere where New Belgium was sold, but since they aren't available in Michigan, I doubt I will be having it again any time soon. I recommend this beer to just about anyone and especially if you are a fan of American Pale Ales. New Belgium came though with one damn good American Pale that I really enjoyed, I just wish I could buy it at the store, good job guys you are one solid Brewing Company and with beers as good this you can be sure that I am more than willing to try more of your different brews. When Comparing this beer to their Mighty Arrow Pale Ale, this beer comes out on top in every aspect and that makes Dig a better American Pale Ale."
""
"This is a good American pale ale that could have been improved with a more aggresive hop presence. This was not up to par with former spring offering, Mighty Arrow."
""
"Wow, this is a GREAT APA!! Poured at a good temperature with a large, foamy, billowy, thick, golden tan head, that lasts a long time, and good lace. Color is a very clear orange amber with some nice bubble trails. Aroma is malt, hop, caramel, earth, spent grist, a little fruit and citrus. Flavor's much like nose, very well balanced with the bitter, sweet, and tang just right. Body is just right for this beer, a few round high points from hop and acid, full mouth. Finish is like flavor, quite short and extremely satisfying yet ready for more. Very well done."
""
""
"Overall: a crisp, fruity, very refreshing lighter bodied beer with a nice balance of malt to match the Japanese/USA/New Zealand combination of hops."
""
""
""
"O: An okay pale ale but not balanced enough from the hop perspective; drinkable and pleasant but just not quite enoughh of what I like in my APA"
""
"Drink- After reading the hop additions on this one, I had higher hopes. Just didnt work for me. It was a bit cold in So. Cal today so might have been the wrong choice."
""
"Body is about perfect for the style...very easy drinking....nice pale ale..."
"hmmm. It's pretty good. I would definitely never turn one of these down, though I don't see myself buying it or going out of my way for it."
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice beer but take this review with a tiny grain of salt...it was my first of the night after a long day of hiking in Zion National Park."
""
""
""
"But this one is good. I do like it"
""
"Still, an easy drinking warm weather beer, but certainly not the APA I'd recommend to friends."
"DOA"
""
""
""
""
"D - Disappointed in this one. This should be a nice bold hop combo but it never appears."
""
""
"Smell is mild, vague dried citrus peel and light hop earthiness, light grains. Taste is similar, a thin flash of hop character fades into a watery and malt forward middle, and an earthy aftertaste. Body is thin and somewhat bland. Drinkable but not assertive at all. Seeing as this was just released for the season, it should be fresh, and therefore was a bit of a letdown."
"Cheers!"
"NOTE: Having had a 6-pack of these, one bottle had a bit of diacetyl which wasn’t really present in the others. Not sure how common that is, but 5/6 were just fine."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a refreshing, light, and easy-to-session beer for the warm months. Enjoyable."
""
"Overall: Fairly decent brew, remind me more of an English PA than an American PA. Very mild on the hop bitterness, and taste, but overall a very solid drinkable brew."
""
"Great medium body and very smooth. Biscuit malt underneath bitter, herbal and drying hops. The flavor is not mind blowing but it is refreshing and I will have another."
"Beer is a little bit of a let down after the appearance and the aroma. The finish of hte beer is solventy and strong. The midpalate of the beer is hoppy and dry, earthy, it is the finish that bothers me the most, could have been really good but this won't be a repeat for me."
""
"Overall, wasn't bad. But I'd say it was more garden variety.. Reminded me a little like Sierra Nevada's torpedo ipa, but with a little less punch or zing."
"Lighter bodied, an active carbonation. Easy to drink but a little watery. More lawnmower beer than SN pale."
""
""
"Clear and golden hued with a half inch of white head that leaves ample lacing on the tulip. The aroma is pretty nice, offering some dank hops, floral scents, pine, toast, biscuits. A balanced flavor, perhaps a hit grainy and bready for the style. Not great, but drinkable. Light bodied and suitable for a Spring day on the deck."
""
""
"This is a high quality great tasting beer that can satisfy an IPA craving. The hops are way more fruitier and less piney than anything I've had before. I love this beer."
"O: not bad at all, not what I expected but it's a tart suprise. definitly sessionalbe"
"Overall, I was very impressed with this beer. It tasted great and looked great as well. I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad APA, but not stellar. The fruits really come out in the taste after the beer warms considerably. I like Somersault much better as far as the New Belgium seasonals go."
"Overall a brew with a refreshing citrusy fruity taste and had a really nice springtime feel to it..."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: nonsweet, savory, very bitter; cracker and barley flavors come out; quite a dry beer (a bit too much for my taste); malt is underplayed"
"New Belgium Dig Pale Ale: New Belgium has made it big because of Fat Tire. Fat Tire is not a bad brew. My theory on its success is that is has a catchy name. These days it takes more than a good product to hit it big, branding is key. So where did New Belgium come up with Dig? As a name for a beer, it is pretty poor. Anyway, Dig, despite poor branding is not a bad effort from a drinkability standpoint. Amber in color, thin but persistent head, but not much in the aroma column get things started. Smooth experience going down, almost a dry feeling, with very little aftertaste. Flavor is a balance between malt and subtle hops from start to finish; one never gets in from of the other. In the end, the Dig is a very drinkable beer, with no outstanding qualities, but no shortcomings other than an odd name."
""
""
"D - drinkable and well crafted, it has a light touch without being bland. Not focused on the hops, the malt is the primary player here, but there is enough bitterness in the finish to keep it balanced."
""
"O: Mild mannered in the glass, its cordial without being bombastic."
"O-I am tempering this review with 3.0 ratings as a 'benefit of the doubt' perspective. Maybe it's me, I just didn't get this beer. And I wanted to."
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice APA featuring Neslon hops. Good hop profile and balance."
"Bright amber in the tall goblet. Excellent foam retention and lacing. Fresh scent of clover or alfalfa. I'm not sold on this particular flavor combo, but it's definitely worth a try for the education value. Modestly bitter, but it creeps up in the aftertaste. From the 12 oz bottle."
"O: a very easy going Pale Ale, good for anyone and still a world class beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A clear golden orange in color. Smells of freshly cut melon. Taste is predominately passion fruit, with some caramel and citrus. A bit of woody hops in the finish. Smooth mouthfeel. Overal a solid pale ale. Super fresh and worthy of the New Belgium name."
"3.5/3.5/3.5/4/3.5"
""
"O: I don't know what to think. The diacetyl-butterscotch flavor is so apparent I feel like it must be some kind of mistake. It doesn't really make the beer any harder to drink though, and it actually kind of works out to be an interesting and almost pleasant character in the beer. But still, its distracting. Otherwise this is a pretty mediocre beer."

"Pours a golden amber color with a half inch foamy head. Mild scent of hops and malts. Overall has a crisp and clean taste that delivers the perfect blend of malts and hops. Some bready citrus tones mixed in with bitterness. Slightly dry finish. A well made refreshing beer to get you in the mood for spring."
""
""
"The taste was pretty much the same, nice but really notable in any area. The body was decent and smooth. The drinkability was very good, the beer went down quickly and easily. Overall, a nice inoffensive brew that really doesn't do anything to make you notice it. worth a shot as your spring ""chore beer""."
"It is an easy drinker, light & refreshing, but to me at least, not overly memorable."
""
""
"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Pours a clear, bright medium orange amber. Slight off-white head that dissipates quickly to random bubbles and a ring around the glass. Mild, pleasant aroma of sweet malt with a hint of fruit and hops. Flavor is dry, bisquit malt, grassy hops and light citrus. Finishes with dry, slightly medicinal hops. A bit dark colored for a pale ale, but flavor is well balanced and more robust than an average pale ale. Light bodied, but appropriate for the style. A nice pale ale that leans towards an amber ale."
""
"Pours a clear, amber/copper color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, hint of citrus cops, slight earthy malt, and a hint of floral hops. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of earthy malt, sweet malt, hint of pale malt, citrus hops, and a hint of caramel. Overall, well balanced between hop bitterness and malty sweetness. Not a strong body, but it is not weak, either. This definitely fits into the New Belgium line-up of brews."

"I liked this offering. It's a neat take on a spring seasonal for people who get sick of all the Bocks and Barleywines."
"This was just average at best for me, which is saying something consider how most of the other New Belgiums I’ve tried."
"D - It's a fresh pale that's fairly easy drinking, and definitely a good foundation, though it's too simple. With some work it could be a great beer."
""
"Overall - I think this beer is a fine representation of an APA that beer drinkers (not beer nerds) can appreciate."
""
""
""
""
"O- A decent pale. Really not too much to comment on for me. It's certainly not shouting to be noticed. I have had other beers with Sorachi Ace that had a more noticeable lemon character that I would like to see here. Also the aroma is minimal. Some of these issues could have to do with warm storage on the shelf and/or age."
"O - A very nicely balanced brew, lots of grassy hops, lemon type flavors, sweet malt, and spice. Thumbs up"
""
"Jumping on the new hops here, some say they take some getting used though I disagree. It is like spicing your food, either some go well together and others you have to be more subtle with. I understand what New Belgium was trying to accomplish but the hopping misses the mark for me a little bit, still a decent quaff."
""
""
"O: Overall I think this is a nice APA. Grapefruit and caramel notes take much of the flavor, but the beer still feels fairly 'easy drinking'. It isn't the best APA I have had, but it certainly is a nice brew."

"O: Looks like this is New Belgium's new beer. Good flavours, well made, I'd like to see this on-tap."
"clear orange color with a one finger off white head... very little retention or lacing. mouthfeel is on-par with the style... smell is pine, slight grain, very easy drinker. quite refeshing but middle of the road pale ale, glad I got to try on-tap."
"O- Not bad, easy to drink, but I don't see myself buying this again."
""
"O - I think this is a well balanced Pale Ale that I'd enjoy any day of the year. There's nothing that wowed me, but it's affordable, drinkable, and refreshing. I'd drink it again but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it. Definitely worth a try. Cheers!"
"Golden pale color, tons of bubbles, sudsy a frothy white head. no lacing. Light caramel, toast bread and lemon on the nose. Biscuit and toast bread hide underneath lemon/grapefruit rind and a piny hop profile. Medium bodied, medium-high carbonation. A basic page ale, nothing remarkable."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, best before May 27th, 2012. This pours a clear golden color with a large off white head which leaves a lacing. The smell is slightly of hops a little citrus and most malts, bready and caramel. The feel is medium to light. The taste is less hop forward than I was hoping, the caramel and bread malts take the centerstage with a mild ESB hop bite. Its okay for an english pale ale though."
"Overall, pretty okay. Or did I say that already?"
""
"The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma has quite a bit of tropical fruit as well as some grass from the hops and some biscuit malt. The flavor is more of the same. I get some pine and orange citrus, as well as a little bit of grass and some biscuit malt. The bitterness is very low and the beer is very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O: a nice, balanced pale ale; spring refreshment, but with how early in the year it comes out (Feb), the extra malt layers are nice; good beer."
"D: wow, this is a very tasty pale ale. great complexity, however subtle, from the use of several different hop varietals. as far as tasty, quaffable APA's are concerned put this one on your list."
""
""
"This is a copper auburn colored brew. There’s a pleasing, hoppy aroma, with some zesty citrus notes and a dominant grassy smell. Flavor is big citrus (mostly orange with some lemony-grapefruit notes) with some hints of soft peach, followed by a nice finish. Not much of a malt profile to speak of, really, but with a brew this tasty and full flavored I’m not going to complain. I’ll certainly be picking up more of these."
""
""
""
"Overall, was looking for a bit more bitters in the finish but not terribly disappointed. Not terribly impressed, either. Drinkable for what it is and if offered, I'd gladly take one."
"Overall a very good pale ale. Too bad it won't be around all summer. It is very good."
"D - Easy drinker on a hot day."

"Overall: A nice take on the American Pale ale. Nice lemon zest flavor and well balanced by the malts."

"Feels a little chewy for some reason, but wetting to the palate. This is a good outdoorsy kind of beer."

"This is an odd APA. The malt character is off putting. The burnt toast notes are unusual. Otherwise this is an alright, refreshing beer. I probably will avoid this in the future."

"I'd call this one of those seasonals you wish they would make year-round...but with New Belgium's lineup as it is, this one might not even bear mentioning. Good pickup this spring either way."

"New Belgium Brewing Company is trying out a new rotating seasonal line, usually 3 years as a seasonal, then a new brew will replace it. This go round, Mighty Arrow Pale Ale was replaced by Dig Pale Ale. Dig pours a light copper, almost amber with a thin, off-white head that provides a lot of lacing. a bouquet of hop aromas dominate the nose, with whiffs of tropical fruit, grapefruit, and lemon all very noticeable. Very little malt flavors are detectable on the pallet, with the bolder notes going towards lemon, orange and passion fruit hoppiness, before a dry finish. This medium carbonation and bodied ale use some newer hop strains, Sorachi Ace and Nelson Sauvin, creating some new and unique flavors."
""
"O - The best part of this beer is that it's clearly an American Pale with the characteristic Cascade aromas, but there's more complexity to it with the other hop utilization. It's got more bite than many Pales and could be considered a wanna be IPA (maybe New Belgium set out to build a complex IPA, but settled with this Jr. version and slapped on the Pale label...or not, they're pros after all). Finishes drier than some of the easier drinking Pale Ales, but I still like it. In my opinion this beer will be a good companion for summer BBQs."
"O - Pretty good stuff. This stuff is going to replace my fat tire purchases while its available."
"Overall – somewhat interesting in taste when one considers what’s hinted at on the label. The taste itself is ok, an odd blend of bitterness and sweetness and even still tanginess."
"On the palate, it's a step up with what seems to be a deliberately understated bitterness with enough hop flavor to gently prod my tastebuds. The chalky character is reduced, and there's more lemon, peach and even some floral characteristics present. Bitterness is medium-low, and the hop flavor is quite nice in the mix. Sweeter flavors, with honey, toast and a little caramel, are noticeable, but aren't prominent right now. Drying on finish with a refreshing bitterness, this is quite nice on the palate. Almost over-carbonated, this has a mild carbonic acid bite, especially on the finish. While the bitterness is low, it does have a nice snap to it. Apart from that, however, there isn't much I can say in a particularly positive light as this beer is just... bland. Decent, I'd drink it if offered but I doubt I'll seek this out again."
"Bottle poured into glass. Light amber in appearance, some head. Let is warm up a bit to open. Nose is very peachy, pine and some citrus. Taste is more bitter than expected and stays with you. Some lacing. Average pale ale, not sure I ""dig"" it."
"Well, this beer sure is interesting. I love sorachi ace hops, and I love nelson sauvin hops, but the combination (along with a few others) leaves me scratching my head. I'm not sure that I'm totally on board with this one, but it's intriguing enough that I'd be happy to have another."

"Quite nice. Thumbs up indeed. Not sure I will pick this up again this season, but will look forward to trying it when it comes out again."
"Pours a clear amber color with a large white head that goes down at a steady pace. Scent is a nice blend or citrus and earthy hop aromas with a nice kick of malt. More citrusy as this beer warms. Taste is first a bit of caramel malt, then immediately I get some lovely bitter hop flavors...lemon, grapefruit, and pine as well. Finishes with a smooth malt profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a very refreshing beer. I'm really ""digging"" this seasonal...Get it???"
"Not bad here. Nothing out of this world, but as spring seasonals go, this hits the nail on the head. Bright and citrusy, crisp and fresh. Exactly what you'd want on a spring afternoon watching the flowers bloom."
""
""
"Medium body, lively carbonation. Easy to drink. Nice beer."
""
""
"A light amber color with an off-white head. Lots of citrus aromas to this one. Heavy on the lemon with a bit of grapefruit juice. Some floral and pine notes in the background as well. Lots of toasted bread throughout. Tastes quite heavy on the lemon. There is a bit of orange peel and just a hint of grapefruit. A light bitterness on the palate with a solid bready malt flavor."
"Pours a dark, clear, copper with a thin white head. Nose is surprisingly hoppy. Taste is grassy and citrus hops with a heavy bready malt backbone and a hint of diacetyl. The label describes it as ""earthy"" which is a pretty good adjective, has that dank kinda flavor. Fully medium bodied. There was some kind of funky, lingering aftertaste I can't quite put my finger, or a description, on but it wasn't good. Really liked this at first but that funky aftertaste just took away too much for me."
"The smell of this beer was really more the smell of an IPA, or at least an extra pale ale, but the taste was far more chill with lots of malt and only light hops. Nice abv for the taste. Flavor might be a bit weak, but then again this is a pale ale and not an IPA. Very high drinkability, an awesome beer, I think it is better than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"O: There are a lot of flavors going on here but they just dont seem to combine well for me. Good but just not compelling for me."
"D/O: This new pale ale boasts of some impressive hop cultivars; while their inclusion is evident, the entire beer seems like something of a compromise. It is a decent APA, not really better than Mighty Arrow which preceded it--just different."
""
"Overall a pretty good beer. Just not a huge fan of the malt/hop combo. But I think it will grow on me as I get through the bottles."
"A pretty basic American Pale, its decent, but nothing special."
""
""
""
"Overall, this has that traditional New Belgium hoppy taste, but it's really good. I do like the crisp apple/caramel malt taste."
""
"Best APA offering I've run into in a long time, such a shame that it's only a seasonal."
""
""
""
"Overall: Surprisingly light in the hop department, but, then again, the diacetyl was also a rather unexpected encounter, leaving me to wonder if this particular batch was off or if this is indeed what they had intended."
"O: Nothing special but an easy drinker. Modest hopping, decent earthy & lemon hop hop notes, relatively clean finish."
"O: This is one of my new favorites. With the ""mainstreamification"" of Fat Tire I tend to forget that New Belgium does a lot of great beers. I'll definitely be reaching for this beer again. It's one of the best examples of a pleasantly bitter beer I've had since I started this ""enjoying my beer"" thing."
""
"This is not a deep beer, but an easy drinker."
"Overall a tasty ale with Pilsner qualities. Nice refreshing ale, this will be great as a summer beer."
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass. Nice copper color, nice head, fruity crisp smell. In fact, the smell of the beer is its best attribute. The taste, however, is another story. I would describe it best as a bitter/dry variation of Fat Tire. Not a very balanced beer. Disappointing to me since Mighty Arrow is one of my all-time favorite seasonals."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like the use of Sorachi hops. Otherwise it's your usually New Belgium six pack offering. Simple and highly drinkable but nothing to blow me away. I enjoyed Mighty Arrow and I don't think this can replace it."
"Pours a nice dark amber, you could also say bronze, with a thumbs width white head. The head, though, doesn't stick around for too long and within a couple minutes (at most) its vanished, leaving behind a spotty coating on the surface with majority of the remains around the edges. Wonderful aroma; initial hit of some sweet but bright lemon rind. Following behind that is the sweet tropical fruits and caramel malt. As it warms, the sweet layer becomes the dominant aroma. I wish the aroma could have been a little bigger and bolder but it is still mighty fine. Flavor is awesome (though again, I wish it could have been a little more assertive and smacked you in the face); sweet, tropical fruity, some peach, and a touch of prickly bitterness. A little pepper and hop bitterness lingers. Very nice and well balanced. A medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel with a bunch of carbonation. It needs the carbonation, though not sure it needs as much as it has. Not that big a deal though. Overall, I think this beer is pretty much fantastic and my first New Belgium six-pack offering that I have been genuinely pleased with. I tried a bunch of stuff I didn't care a heck of a lot for (some were decent but average, others just plain no good) but it was all worth it to get to this. Great seasonal, I look forward to drinking a bunch of this during its release."
"O: Meh. Just another in a long line of mediocre Spring seasonals. It's not terrible, just not all that great though, either."
""
""
""
""
"Dig Pale Ale from New Belgium is another fine creation. The beer poured a clear copper with white head that left a nice lace. The smell included citrus and peach. The taste was a bit bitter with peach at the front and grapefruit in the end...decent malt balance throughout. The mouthfeel is lighter bodied ale with good carbonation. Overall it is a good beer, but there is a Belgium sugar twang at the end which I am not fond of...I hope this didnt replace might arrow."
""
""
""
""
"Clear amber color under a persistent bubbly head that leaves behind abundant lace. Zesty, resinous nose...leafy citrus oil, light grain, and a touch of ""cattiness"". Fresh oily hop flavor. Earthy lemon, stone fruit, sweetness, some buttery malt. Definitely has a certain dank-ness going on. Medium-light bodied with appropriate carbonation. A quality, refreshing Spring seasonal. They seem to be switching up the seasonal selections all the time, but this one's a keeper."
""
"A spring seasonal that has been out for a few weeks in early Feb. seems kinda odd,but heh I picked it up anyway.Poured into a standard pint a clear copper with a frothy 1/2 finger white head atop.Lemony aromas with some caramel sweetness,not overly assertive but not bad.Drunken apricots and caramel sweetness on the palate, the light sweetness makes me wanna grab more,the hop profile is not big but plays a big role in bringing everything together in this beer.Iam not a huge fan of the Sorachi Ace hop but it goes well with the other hops in this beer,a very good sessionable ale here although the alcohol is a little high for that title."

"O - This is a really nice brew. I like the choice of hops in this one."
"O: While this beer seems almost more like a straight up IPA than an APA, it is sweet, smooth and easy to drink."

"This beer pours a clear bronze color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel, and fresh cut grass. The taste is nicely hoppy with good balancing malt. There is a nice moderate bitterness in the finish, but nothing overboard. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a slightly watery texture, and high carbonation. Overall, this is one of the better beers I've had from New Belgium. I could drink this beer again."
""
"Subjectively I find it rather forgettable in the taste department. It's like a half and half of Fat Tire and SN Pale Ale."
"Overall- This pale ale is good, but I do not like the peppery, musty quality of this drink. It almost imparts a phenolic quality to this beer. Otherwise it is well done."
"O. Overall, a nice seasonal offering from New Belgium. Very refreshing, and makes me wish there wasn't snow in the ground."
"O - This is a great pale ale. Well done again, New Belgium!"
"Amber and pretty clear, decent head and lace. Smell is quite malty, with a little citrus, fruit, and spice. Subdued, but nice. Taste is far more bold than you'd think it would be from the smell. Earthy malts are plentiful, balanced with a bit of citrus, some crispy hops, and maybe just a touch of peppery spice. Body is pretty light and well carbonated, with just a touch of bite. It's a rather pleasant beer to drink. I like that it's not heavily over the top, with NB instead just producing a solid, tasty APA for this seasonal. I would certainly drink this one again."
"New Belgium does beautiful things with these less common hops. I love the Nelson sauvin hops and the sorachi ace add a great spicy note."
""
"Coppery pour with an inch of white foam. Leaves lacing as it recedes. Interesting lemony-citrus, sweet, clean and tropical nose. Taste is citrus and caramel-nutty, sweet, but crisp and clean due to generous carbonation and hop. Not bitter. Finishes clean. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery. Interesting beer and easy to drink."
"Overall, a pretty solid pale that is fine on its own, but wouldn't hold up with most of the classics/standards of the style."
"This is one impressive beer. I love the maltiness along with the nice bitterness to balance it off. New Belgium really hit a home run with this one."
""
""
""
""
"O- Phenominal spring Pale Ale, can see myself going through a case of this before NB moves on to the next seasonal"
""
"In the end I like it and I don't. I feel like with the seasonal beers, New Belgium is always holding back. Everything seems to be in a Pale Ale sort of mold- not too strong, a little hoppy, appealing to everyone. I like the Nelson Sauvin hop alot, and when I get a note of it it really wows, but unfortuantely it isn't intense enough, and gets lost in the mix mostly. I would guess this time next year NB will be coming out with yet again something different."
"Overall: This is a surprisingly awesome beer. Give it a shot and check your prejudice before you pour. NB is pumping out some super high quality stuff right now."
"do you see where im going with this one!?!?"
"O - Overall a perfect Springtime brew, clean, delicious, and fresh!"
"Basically, it's Fat Tire with a slightly different hop schedule. NB seems to be getting away from their original Belgium focus. We get new seasonals each year that are difficult to tell apart, I'd love to see them bring back the great Porch Swing Single from the late 90s, as a spring seasonal. Oh well."
"Pours a golden on copper ale with a finger of off-white foam and excellent clarity. Smells fruity with pineapple, mango, cherry (sweet) and a nice sweet and english malt profile. It tastes sweet and candy like with the hops. I'm really surprised/intrigued with how they get such a sweet beer with the hops - and the hops are obviously fruity and tropical. The mouth is thin with moderate on hi carb and a forgettable finish. I could probably drink this all night, it's fun, but easy."
""
"O- It's a fine beer. It actually isnt all that different than Fat Tire. On the whole it's ok."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. Enjoyable and goes down so pleasantly."
"Overall, this is a perfect spring time beer and involves some great flavors. However, It's not even spring yet and it's really crappy outside! By the time it's nice enough outside to enjoy this beer, the hops will have fallen off, into the distance. Other than that qualm, great beer."
""
"O: New Belgium makes ANOTHER solid beer. It doesn't blow me away, but it is a perfect sit around and do nothing beer. I am glad this is a new seasonal."
"Overall: I like the use of the Sorachi Ace and Nelson Sauvin hops. The typical New Belgium biscuit flavor annoys me slightly, but ultimately the beer works quite well and is refreshing. Slightly better than the previous seasonal, Mighty Arrow."
""
"I grabbed a bottle of this the other day, as it was new to the shelves, and found myself pleasantly surprised by this latest New Belgium offering. The complimentary mix of hop varietals here really bounced each other nicely and just gave this a flavorful crispness that really made this an easy drinking quencher. I’m going to be grabbing a full sixer of this. It’s darn tasty stuff."
""
"Overall this was really enjoyable. Nice, hoppy pale ale while not being overly bitter. Very drinkable."
"I am a big fan of NB, and this doesnt disappoint."

""
"Balance is the word for this Pale Ale. I must say the New Belgium Brewery has failed to disappoint me yet. They are damn good at this. I think I found a Pale Ale that is as delicious as Liberty Ale!"
"Foamy creamy head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Citrus smell is outrageous. Some earthyness as well as a hint if biscuit. The taste is exacty how it smells. Grapefruit.. lemon zest and maybe a but of peach? This one caught me off guard. Solid brew by new belgium."
""
"4.1"
""
"A tasty, fruity pale ale and a great spring beer, light and refreshing but full of fruit and well balanced. I love me some nelson sauvin hops, and the sorachi ace contributes nice subtle citrus zest notes. I feel like there's something missing that keeps me from rating it higher, complexity maybe, but it is good."
"Overall, this is a nice little beer. I like how this beer is different than most Pales, and sets itself apart. Won't go out of my way to revisit, but certainly wouldn't turn one down."
"Overall a very nicely balanced, beautiful boquet of hops, nice aroma and flavor balance. Easy to drink, great beer."
"Overall, this is an average pale ale. I wish that it was more hop forward.... I feel like that would have given it a nudge in the right direction to take it to above average. I'm sitting in my back yard on a beautiful day and it definitely is the right beer for the situation. Very easy drinking and very sessionable. Worth trying if you are in the mood for a sixer."
"Pours a clear copper with a 1 inch foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Nice tight rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of tropical fruits, citrus zest, grapefruit, and some earthy herbal hops. Taste is of tropical fruit and citrus zest up front with a malt backbone. The aftertaste has a mild herbal bitterness that quickly fades from the palate. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pale ale that has a nice smell and taste. Very drinkable stuff."
"overall - who cares about the look or the nose when the flavor is there - this is solid pale ale that is reasonably priced and very sessionable - well done NB"
""
"Taste shows some well balanced use of malt and hops, but thats not what I want here, dammit! The yeast here is most assuredly the same as used in Fat Tire, it has the same nutty creaminess to it. Which is fine, but the malts are too prominent for me. Its baffling really, New Belgium certainly is not afraid to throw out plenty of hops (Ranger, 2 Below, Snow Day, etc.), so I am surprised at this one. Its not bad by any means, I just think they could have showcased the zesty, lemony Sorachi hops better with a cleaner, more lightly malted beer. Oh well, fun to have once, but I am on the fence whether or not I would buy a whole sixer...leaning towards not."
""
""
"Light orange pour with a two-finger cream head but minimal lacing, smells like orange peel and musty malts. The taste has more hops and more fruit--orange and lemon zest, too much grapefruit, biscuit malt, but also a very bitter grassy quality which kind of ruins it for me. It drinks well otherwise, on the light end and well-carbonated, but I just didn't like the flavor profile enough to go for this one again."
""
""
"Damn, this drinks so easy, clearly one of the better hop forward beers I've had from New Belgium. Having said that I really dig (pun intended) Belgo too. Dig would be a nice summer time brew fat into the dog days. A top rung APA to me"
"Yeah, this is a textbook 3. Certainly don't feel like I wasted my money, but there are far better uses for it in the future."
"O - It is fresh and spring-like so Dig will make a great seasonal. A little cold out right now but I can envision myself sitting out on my back porch after a day of work sipping on this and watching my garden grow."
""
"overall - 4/5 - Tettering here. I think the grapefruit flavor is a bit much, but it's very refreshing which is what it aims to be. I will enjoy this as a light alternative to double IPAs and Belgian beers."
"O- tasty and drinkable i like this one like i enjoy hoptober in the fall this is a winner for NB, will drink more this winter and enjoy it even more this spring"
"A well crafted brew here, me thinks."
"Can't tell you why I'm so jazzed to try out the new New Belgium seasonal, but I kinda am... It pours a clear amber topped by a finger of cream-white foam. Something about this beer strikes me as unusually good-looking. The nose comprises sparkling lemon zest, light peach, light caramel, and a touch of minty pine needle. If some of these were a bit stronger, this would smell damn pleasant; as it is, it ain't close to bad. The taste halts the love train, bringing notes of orange peel, grapefruit rind (in both cases, the white part only, along with a lick of the unwashed outside), light caramel, light pine resin, and bitter, chlorophyll-laden grass. I'm gonna assume the Sorachi hops ruined things, as usual, but it's not normally like this when they do, what with the sharp bitterness and all... I got nothin'. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a nice-looking and -smelling beer, but one that falls apart in the flavor department. Still, it could be a lot worse, and I wouldn't necessarily turn down a free bottle of this in the future..."
"i am a whore for sorachi ace hops. ever since brooklyn's introduction, i sleeze for this hop profile. this one smells like tropical compost. decaying mangos, banannas, and citrus fruit. not like flies all over the shop, but just past ripe, really nectary. flavor is more lemony from the hops, bitter to a degree, but not an bitter bomb. this brew is extraordinary. super super drinkable with a lighter body and a crisp finish. one of my favorite new belgium beers. i could go on and on about this one and its food pairings, but ill just say, this is a must try!"
"This was a pleasant surprise indeed! One of the better NB brews I've enjoyed in a while, good stuff!"
"Overall, with good taste and good drinkability, i'll buy it again. Can't say I won't miss Mighty Arrow though."
""
""
"Aroma is a very heady mix of juicy red grapefruit blended with lemonade and a background structure of spicy/herbal hop aroma blended well, of appropriate mildness for the Pale Ale category. Biscuity malt scent is hard to pick up on until the brew has a chance to warm up somewhat. Has a transparent coppery amber color and a two finger soap detergent texture of a head with nickel-sized loops of lacing left behind with each sip. The taste starts out with a white pepper and Saaz-like crisp spiciness emphasis, than somehow manages to visit every kind of hopping flavor profile in rapid succession EXCEPT for tropical fruit and pine resin, all at an appropriately gentle level for a Pale Ale, and balanced with a bready malt. I'm impressed with the high level of flavor complexity considering how restrained and subtle it is. Texture is medium-light, well carbonated, zippy and crisp across the tongue. I'd recommend giving this one a try, it is one of the best APAs I've ever had."
