"On tap at the Bryant Lake Bowl. Brilliant copper gold under a 1""" white foam collar that clings to the side of the glass. Floral citrus nose with traces of fruit. Sweet malt and light fruit on the palate give way to a balancing citrus rind bitterness. Medium body and carbonation. A bold, easy to drink pale ale."
""
"Draft in a pint glass....nitro....thus the incredible creamy mouthfeel. Light brown/Amber with a 1/2 inch creamy head that stayed until draft was half gone. Light hoppy nose.  Tasted as expected light malt...light hop...slightly bitter... The nitrogenized draft made for a pleasant creamy mouthfeel...some would call it flat, but again just how I expected it to be......I had two!"
"Pours an enticing golden copper with a nice foam head; good lace retention throughout. A fruity aroma hits you as well as a malt backbone and some floral esters that develop as it warms. Spicy, herbal, and bold piney hops taste as well as a slight lemon finish. Good pale malt backbone; I nevertheless would have liked some of the fruity elements of the aroma to match the taste a tad more. Medium light bodied, prickly carbonation and very drinkable; definetely a session brew. I  liked it a lot and will get again for sure."

"What was missing for me when I had this beer was the smell and taste. Hardly any smell at all and then the flavor just came up short for me. Part of the issue, though, is that I am a Stout, Breakfast Stout, and IPA lover, so Pale Ales just don't do it for me. However, I have had other pale ales and enjoyed them more than this particular one. This is my least favorite Founders beer."

"3/21/15 (Bottle) - Nice foggy golden brown pour, minimal head, mild carbonation. Citrus and malt scent prevalent. Nice contrast of citrus and bitter hops. Light clean and refreshing feel. Overall very good beer."
""
""
"Decent pale, much better options out there though."
""
""
"Surprisingly clean, crisp, and refreshing. Akin to a German pilsner. Very drinkable. Much lighter in flavor than a typical APA. Overall, a surprising find and very enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Feels dry but goes down easy. Also disappointed with the alcohol appearing at the end"

""

"Had on nitro. It was good pale ale"

"Poured from a single bottle. Look- brighter gold/orange. I like how it is very cloudy, you can see a lot of floating residue in it. This tells me it is a smaller batch brew; not mass produced! Smell- not entirely distinctive; faint hops but not very fragrant. Taste- very good for style. Well balanced-  crisp high quality water is used here, light in the hops. I am not the biggest APA guy but this is a good one. Feel- carbonation, dry finish as advertised. Overall- I dug this, it is a nice beer and I really like Founders' output. It just is not extremely memorable"
"Overall a nice APA especially with the meal.  And it was only $2:50 a bottle"
"O:  An OK beer.  Not one of Founders better offerings."

"The best Pale Ale around....after Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale of course!"
""
""
""
""
"No hop on the front end even though it claims to be dry hopped.  Poor head.  Cindery flavor on the back.  Astringent bite.  Maltose dextrose is evident.  I champion APAs but unfortunately not this one"
""
""
"Overall not a bad entry, but people looking for hop bombs won't find it here."
""
"Pours a bright straw color, clear with a thick bright white head. Smell is grains, cereal, light malt, faint hops. Taste is notes of citrus, wheat, grass, malt, fairly mild. Feel is light and crisp. Overall, nothing bad but not quite as exciting as Founders reputation led me to think it would be."
""
"Not a whole lot of flavor. If there were more of a floral scent and it was maybe a bit more flavorful it would be much better."
""
""
""
"very good american pale ale"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Was very disappointed.  Really enjoyed other Founders beers.  This one almost reminds me of drinking a flat soda."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Minimal flavor, primarily wheat and caramel without much hoppiness or other inviting taste."
""
""
"Hazy amber in color with a large, white fluffy head.  Good lacing and retention.  Caramel, citrus, bread, and earth in the aroma but it is all a bit muddled and difficult to pick out.  A little bit of grass and skunk in the flavor to combine with the citrus hops.  Fairly bitter in an unpleasant way with a dry and chalky mouthfeel.  Medium bodied.  Nothing against Founders, but I have been unimpressed by many of their beers (with the exception of Centennial IPA and Red's Rye) and this was no exception."
""
""
""
"O: good ipa, dry and earthy, less citrus and more muted earthy hop flavor"
""
"The feel if this beer is light with a good drinkable feel that goes down smooth. This may not be the beer the brewer intended but still has some good flavors and aromas that makes for pleasant beer."
""
""
"O - On the dry and bitter side, otherwise a pretty average pale."

"If you're in the mood for a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, I say go for Founder's instead. I love both, but this takes the cake. It does a great job balancing the Cascade hops with fruit to avoid a too sharp pinch-you-in-the-face experience. I enjoy it from the bottle, typically poured into a goblet or weizen glass. It's very hazy with a nice, hoppy and floral aroma. I dare say the hops are mild. The head leaves you rather quickly but I see lacing. Hops are very present in the taste but its again mild and balanced with citrusy fruit and a clean, dry finish. The best news is that I don't count this among Founders finer brews, and it's still great! If ever you find yourself in/around Grand Rapids, MI, the brewpub located downtown is a must see (seriously, it's impressive only to look at) and sports amazing, seasonal offerings."

"O: This beer is Not one of my favorites from Founders, in fact I find myself a little disappointed. It seems a bit weak. The body is just a bit too light and thin to suit me. The hop flavors are good and the beer is fairly well balanced, but I don't notice a distinct hop that I would expect with dry hopping. Just seems a bit muddled over all in its flavor."

"good beer, pale and sweetness prevail. Overall a good dry hopped beer. Color is acceptable but look past it and try to feel the flavor. It is good but is missing some complexity. Overall, Founder's Brewing does an ok job with their beers but could use a little extra care to take it to the next level"
"A nice pale ale. I may have underrated this a tad. I’d have it again for sure."

"This beer has enough flavor to make it tasty but is not overpowering or heavy so you can drink it all day long. Hoppy aroma but not overly bitter. refreshing and crisp, my go-to pale ale. If you are looking for a balance of drink-ability and flavor I highly recommend. Great for BBQ or tailgating."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Definitely a session ale, this Founders’ offering shows off some high-quality ingredients as well as an expert’s touch by the brewmaster. One of the most quaffble APAs I’ve ever had."

"O-A very drinkable PA with a strong hop presence, definitely better with nitro than the bottle I had in the summer."
""
""
""
"This beer is solid but nothing spectacular. It is easy drinking enough but there is hardly any malt backbone and the only real flavor is a bitter hop taste. There isn't really any other hop flavor to speak of. I would say this brew would be good for a summer outing because it is decent and could be refreshing on a hot day but it is certainly nothing spectacular."

"This is a nice, light pale ale; a pleasant break after winter’s mixture of stouts, porters, and IPAs. This is easily a potential lawnmower beer."
"Not a bad IPA, just not the most enjoyable. A bit more balance and some more character in the taste and aroma department will go a long way. Oh, and fix the finish. Minor gripes aside, it's a solid IPA - there are better offerings available however."
""
"Overall: Light, easy to drink and floral. Cascade all over it, would wish for a bit more malt backbone, but changing that would change the niche of this beer - the thing to grab instead of ice tea at a hot summer day."

"O - A charming version of the style from front to back, Founders' Pale Ale is a beautiful demonstration of the Cascade hop variety with it's floral and citrus aroma and flavor but, above all else, it's exceptional drinkability! This pale ale would pair well with nearly any pub fare."
""
""

"Bottle: Poured a light orangey color ale with a generous head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of citrus and fruity hoppy notes is very interesting. Taste is dominated by very nice flavours of fruity and citrus hoppy notes with lightly sweet malt notes. Body is full for style with good carbonation. Very nice beer with high-level of drinkability with some very nice notes hops flavours without too much bitterness."

"O- Outstanding example of the American Pale Ale style. Out of a total of 14 pale ales in the blind tasting, this ale tied for 1st (with 4 other beers) on my list, and ended up at 7th on the collaborative list."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a great sessionable pale ale, well brewed and put together, I'm not sure of the bottled date on this beer but it tastes reasonably fresh, can't pick up any oxidised notes. I'd love to smash down pint after pint of this on tap, everything I've tasted from Founders so far has been excellent, glad to have them available here in Australia, cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very nice PA that will get passed over by many that want a bigger IPA or IIPA, not realizing just how darned good this is. It is very light and nearly sessionable due to moderate ABV. This is a go-to for me now. Very very good Pale Ale."
"The taste begins with a decent pale and grainy malt note, a kind of citrus feel, and a definite hop bite that is not overpowering but balances well with the rest of the sensations. Above average but nothing I would remember a few weeks from now."
""
""
"O: Nothing really special here, which is partly why this is such a bare-bones review. A really unspectacular beer that isn't great and isn't awful. Entirely drinkable, but definitely not something I will actively seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Best feeling pale ale on the shelf, hands down. Awesome brew."
""
"O - Another solid offering from Founders. It has a great taste and is very easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Taste is ultra grainy with a fine finish of leafy hops. It is not as hoppy tasting as I thought it would be with the 'dry hopped' terxt on the label. The beer is well crafted for sure, but I was hoping for some more hop flavor...bitterness is fine. It's a pounder, for sure...a sixer of this would disappear really fast in my fridge, but I was expecting a bit more - one of the few pedestrian offerings from this fine establishment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall, this is a good beer that I would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden pour, that has a haze, with a nice head and lacing. Light bodied with good carbonation. Mild nose of pine resin. Taste is laid back and not complex. Slight hop flavor and bitterness that is well balanced. Crisp finish that is a laid back form of slight bitterness against a slight grapefruit hop flavor. A good beer to transition from the megas into the crafts that doesn’t launch a full assault upon your taste buds."

"Slightly hazy orange gold in the glass, the head starts out about a finger thick then fades to a thin layer of bubbles which throws some lace. Great citrusy hop aromas due to the dry hopping process dominate the smell, there is also a bit of clean caramel in there also to give some balance. The taste too is almost all hops. A lot of resin and bitterness with the typical cascade flavor profile is all right out front. The rest of the beer is pretty clean with the malt flavors falling into the caramel, biscuit range perhaps not enough malt or enough range in the malt flavors to balance the hops for the style. Nice levels of carbonation along with assertive bitterness make this a tingly beer, the finish is bitter and long lasting. Overall this is a middle of the road APA, the hops are trying to push this beer into the IPA category while the malt just isn't where it should be for this style."
""
""

"2nd tasting: OK, that's a bit harsh. There's some lemon hard candy hopping at the center of this which is basically pleasant. Bumping taste by .25"

"Founders offers big and bold beers at both ends of the colour spectrum, but their Pale Ale is definitely not one of them. While its familiarity and moderation may disappoint some of the snooty beer geeks out there, I like that it contradicts the notion that American craft beer must be extreme. It's a conventional offering, yes, however a very well-made one."

"O: Not being a big enthusiast on pale ales it was enjoyable and I'd try it again if the opportunity arrived ."
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer, but not that impressive either. It really makes me wont an IPA, but I think it's fair to say this one is a pretty good example of the pale ale style."
""
"O- Overall, I think this a a great pale ale that stays true to the style. It is light bodied, well balanced, and has a good amount of flavor. Recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Founders Pale Ale is a much more classic-styled pale ale than even SNPA. Besides the hoppy aroma from the dry hopping, the flavor itself is delicate with floral/citrus hops and grainy malts. Very quaffable, if lacking a bit in excitement. Overall, a solid pale ale in a style that's beginning to die out."

"In the end, this is a very clean pale ale. It’s not very hoppy as I like my pale ales, but I hugely enjoy how easy drinking and clean this beer is. One of the weakest beers from Founders, but still very competent. Going into this as a pale ale would be the wrong move, I would think of this more of a Helles lager. Very clean, a bit of hops."
""
"Overall an interesting, strongly flavoured but more """traditional""" tasting pale ale."
"Founders Pale Ale ---4/5."
"O - very good APA. Dry hopped and delicious. I forgot how good this thing was and ill definitely have to review a bottle of it soon. One of the best American pale ales you'll find and Founders does a nice job of keeping it simple but with loads of class. Sometimes these classic hop and malt flavors are just what an ale needs. This does what it's intended to do and does it very very well."

"Crisp and smoothe. Goes down well. I've enjoyed the first half of the six pack so far, but probably would look elsewhere first. Maybe I was spoiled with the APAs I was drinking before, but this doesn't quite hit the sweet spot for me. Especially coming from such a (deservedly) acclaimed brewery as Founders, I was hoping for something... else. Well crafted, just not the complete flavour profile I was looking for."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 6/4/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, grapefruit, bread, light honey, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and citrus/floral hops; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, grapefruit, floral, grass, bread, light honey, light pine, and floral earthiness. Light floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, bread, light honey, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice flavor balance of citrus/floral hop flavors with bready malts; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, lightly sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale ale. Very nice balance of hop and malt flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering when it is fresh."

"O- a good warm-up before I hit the hoppier stuff. Easy drinking and flavorful."
""

"The Rest: Nothing fantastic or remarkable, just a solid drinking beer."
"Overall: Not impressed by this. I typically like Founders but I wouldn't rush out to get this again. There isn't really anything wrong with it...it just fails to stand out at all"
""
""
""
""
"A slow starter in that it wasn't at all what I was expecting, particularly from a beer with the words 'dry hopped' on the label but once the beer had time to settle and open up a little this became more apparent in the taste. A nice beer that slowly grew on me and turned out okay in the end."

"Even this old, this is a drinkable beer, although I can't tell where the dry hopping has really played a part here. Dry hopped pale ales are becoming my new favorite thing, so to see it so muted at this point is rather saddening. I bought this two weeks ago, and broke it from a six pack, but I've no clue why it was still sitting around. It still is crisp, and amazingly resemblant to the flagship West Coast PA flavor, but it has way too much lemon going in on in it, and not enough else other than the earthy grains. Not horrible, but not up to par on Founders' standards."
""
"O - Weird brew that doesnt really match up to its label or class."
"I poured this into a glass, it has a orange amber colored body with a thin tan heas. The smell has sweet malt aroma with a hint of hops, The taste has a very nice malt up front then the hops come right after. the bitterness of the hops leave a nice resdue on the back of the tongue. Overall this is a good pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""

"D - Goes down easily enough... However, this does not live up to the lofty expectations that other Founders offerings leads one to expect..."
"O: this is a pretty good beer. Admittedly I am more of a porter and stout fan and prefer Founders' selection of stouts and porters over this one."

"Pours copper, light and dark with white foam. Clings at the edges, dissolves atop. Malty pine nose. taste is a fruity open, middle of the road bitter, but layered below. Smooth, nice buzz from the carbonation. Kind of a tropical fruit finish. Very good."

"Pours a dark orange color with almost no head. Aroma of flowers and sweet candy and some yeast. Tastes very dry. Lots of lemon and orange and an overall dry citrus taste. The body of this beer is very watery. The lack of carbonation gives this an awkward stale apple juice feel and taste. This beer really did not sit too well on me. Bottle and standard tap options are very appropriate as this can be a tasty pale ale when fresh but the lack of carbon dioxide changes this one."

"O A great representative for the style. Light, smooth, sweet, got some hops and bitterness. Great 'lounging around' nay I say session beer. This joins FIS and Dirty Bastard as great Founders beers for their particular style."

"This pours a cloudy, golden orange color with a slight beige head. The aroma is full of wheat, fruity scents, and hints of hops. The taste is smooth, flavorful, and very easy drinking. Founder’s is known for making these big, bold beers; but this brew is very simple in comparison but just as tasty. It drinks a little sweet and finishes a little crisp. This is well made and is very enjoyable."
""

""

"Pours gold with nice tight white head & ample carbonation. Slightly hazy. Smells sweet from malts with touch of hops. This isn't a hop bomb APA by any means. Citrus hops that give off lemon notes. Tastes sweet initially then bitterness coats the tongue. Touch of sweet crystal malts. Feels light bodied with no astringency and very even balance. Overall, this is a solid pale ale. Thought it could be more since it was brewed by Founders, but it still makes for a solid session ale."

"Overall this offering from Founders tends to underwhelm, which is a shame because it tastes as though it has potential. Founders usuall makes very high quality brews but this one fails to blow me away or even excite me."
""
"Taste/feel: An absolute delicious pale ale, and no doubt one of the best I've had. Extremely smooth and easy drinking with a very, very nice balance. The score may """only""" be an 84 for this beer, but pale ales never get very high ratings, it seems. Founders Pale Ale is one of my favorite pale ales, and yet another good one from Founders."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Like I said, I think anyone who was looking for a very solid beer to begin their transition into craft beer would enjoy this brew. Pale Ale's seem to be getting more and more hoppy but this beer sticks to the mold and really is very pleasant. Nothing to make you jump back but overall does the job."
""

"Gold/amber with a slight haze. Herbal scent. Light mouthfeel. Slight head and little lacing. Of ALL the Pale Ales I've had (NOT INCLUDING the India Pale Ale style) this Pale Ale made an INSTANT impression on me and actually SURPRISED me because it had the agressiveness of an IPA - certainly due the dry hop treatment. It instantly had a nice crisp burst of flavor with a citrusey edge and that slowly dissipating aura of a green forest. Very, very nice beer - NICE JOB! I have had about 7 styles of the FOUNDERS so far and I have liked every single one. I expect Pale Ales to be more malty - this beer encourages me to look for more dry hopped beers."
"Overall, not my favorite brew from Founders, but a very drinkable APA for sure."
"Taste is very, very smooth. The first thing that hits you is that sharp floral lemon noted in the aroma, but as it works its way toward the back of your mouth, there's a slight waxy bitterness the brings out the """floral""" nature of the hop profile in a much more pronounced fashion. Malts are fairly absent from the taste, as I can only faintly pick out the general """sweet""" bready notes I found in the aroma. Others seem to find them more forthcoming in the taste, but whatever. Carbonation is medium, and the slick mouthfeel makes this incredibly sessionable. Again, this isn't going to blow any minds, but it would be foolish to think that this is the beer's intention. Get a 6-pack of this, find some good company, and make a short night of it."
"IPA's aren't my top choice, but even so, this isn't my favorite."
"Big grapefruit - sweet and bitter - up front, followed by a chewy bread, malt middle. Finishes dry with floral notes and bitter herb. A delicious pale ale with more character than most that I have tried."

""
""

"Cheers."
"Overall: Kind of a bit disappointed about this beer. A very light pale ale with little hop characteristics. Not sure what happened here, but wouldn't mind trying it out on draft."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Dig it. My first sample from Founders Brewery is a success. I will buy another of their products. I thought this stuff might be a decent bridge beer for BMC drinkers into better stuff, but it might be kind of hoppy for that. Fans of real beer will enjoy."

"Bottled on 5/21/12 and poured into a pint glass on 12/1/12. A hazy dirty yellow gold lurks under an off-white head. Aroma of earthy zesty citrus comes through in the nose. Blended pungent citrus rind headlines the flavor to a crisply carbonated mouth feel. An overall easy going, brightly hopped, and full bodied American pale ale."
""
""
""
"Unfiltered orange body, with a fluffy off white head. Sticky webbed lace and good retention. Nose is piney, grassy, slightly dank, orange and grapefruit. A bit of sweet malt, but subtle. Taste has grass, orange, grapefruit and general bitter citrus zest flavours upfront, slight spicy and earthy hop on the back end. Light crackers pale malt as well forms a base. Medium bitterness and medium light body, adequate lower med carbonation. A tasty standard pale ale."
""
"Pours a light orange and cloudy copper color. A bit thin on the head that did not even reach 1 finger in thickness. I am not an super IPA/pale ale fan but even I was looking for more intense aromatics on this one. What aromatics are there do offer pleasing notes of citrus, clove and tangerine. Good a bit light on carbonation this beer is incredible smooth and easy to drink. For that reason I probably would not turn down having this one again though I don't think I would seek it out again as a must have."
""

"O: One of the hoppiest and most flavorful Pale Ales I've ever had. As good aroma as the best IPAs out there. Surprised by this one, try it."

"Found at the Great Lost Bear in Portland, Maine this pale ale is a hazy yellowish amber color with a delicate but steady white fuzz on top and copious lacing. I can smell iced tea lemon with a faint hint of pine. Pleasant for a pale ale. The flavor offers much more hop bite than anticipated with a cracked wheat explosion of dry citrus and grass hops. It really roughs up the center of your tongue with crisp, slightly angry bitterness while tagging along a bit of grain sensibilities. I expect most would say that this is a bit harsh for a pale ale and could probably use some balance toward the malt and grain side, but I'm not complaining. Leafy, perhaps a bit oaky, this stuff is medium-light bodied, very fine but highly effective carbonation for a completely titillating feel with a bit of an aqueous quality. Not sure I'd want to session this pale ale, it's not Sierra Nevada, but bravo for the hop love in a pale ale!"
""
""
"OVERALL: An impressive pale ale from Founders, a Michigan based brewery that does not disappoint. This fine specimen of a dry hopped pale ale is exemplary on draft."
""
""
"Dry hopped pale ale. cloudy, orange and red shades. While there's not a lot in the smell, it's easy to drink With some piney and floral elements. I found it to be crisp and a good pale ale. Not my first choice but it is good. Good beer and pizza choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well carbonated. Tastes bitter with some sweetness from grains. Hints of citrus make it refreshing. Light body makes it an easier APA to drink (who already overcome bitterness), good for beginners or who wants to drink several of it. Though not for someone who is looking for one notch down IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"This offering from Founders pours up a hazy gold with a two finger off white head, some retention, and some lacing. Smell is citrus, pine, grasses, and maybe some floral notes. Mouthfeel is full with lots of carbonation. Taste is sweet on the front, well balanced with bitterness on the finish and a coffee aftertaste. Definitely worth a try if you haven't had this one yet."
"I was looking to try a new pale ale and was suggested by a salesperson to give this a try once I indicated to him what I liked. Thought this was okay but am still looking for something sold in the Midwest that is as good as DesChutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale. Any idea if Mirror Pond will be available in Chicagoland someday?"
""
""
"Founders Pale Ale is a sparkling, hazy, golden ale with a soft, foamy, off white head that leaves some lacing. There are piny, floral hops in the nose, along with dry, light grain. The soft, medium body has a crisp, acidic finish. Juicy, resiny, fruity hop flavor is backed with a solid grain. It's bright and top heavy with bitterness. It's very American. It's bold, refreshing and very tasty!"

""
""
""
"O - Solid APA - could make this a session brew. Also, this is an all year round brew - very versatile."
""
""
""
""
"This is decently hoppy but all of the flavors are very faint. The herbal, floral, piney notes come through, but the malt doesn't balance it out. This was good once, but I won't pickk it up again."
""
"Overall: Great beer, I will enjoy this six pack for sure."
"Founder's take on the classic Pale Ale is a pretty good one. Quite strong in hop character, but simply so, and not too overbearing for those not exactly looking for an IPA. This would be a good transition from APAs to IPAs for someone who is afraid to make the leap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Decent pale ale, I thought founders would go with the hoppy approach but this is a little different."
""
""
"O: right now I'm wishing I bought a six pack of this but would definitely come back to this."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty decent pale ale, and I think one that follows the style guidelines well. This bottle was less than four months old, but I do wonder if it would have been better if I had drank it when it was fresher. Still, very enjoyable. Recommended."
""
"O-Very easy to enjoy, and very easy to point out the dry hopped difference. Not a whole lot of character to be found, but likely more graspable for a introductory beer geek."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps not as fresh as it needs to be. Pours deep gold. Strangely, almost no carbonation. Aroma is musty and piney, not as citrusy as expected. Chewy mouthfeel. Taste is mostly classic pale, little roastier than expected. Solid pale ale, not quite what I expected, but a solid beer."

"O – This is a nice example of the pale ale style. It’s well-balanced between the sweet and toasty malts and the bitter hops and has a healthy dose of each. There is nothing earth-shattering about this beer; it’s just a very drinkable and tasty pale ale. I’m telling you, Founders cannot make a bad beer."
""
"Somewhat hoppy and bitter. I would drink this beer again but it would not rank as one of my favorites. I am new to microbrews and am really starting to enjoy them. I am not a fan of heavy hops nor am I that fond of citrus drinks. I am willing to try any and have not really settled on a style of beer yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear deep golden/amber color with a decent white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of citrus grapefruit with some bready and biscuit malt to back it up. The flavor is bready and biscuity with a hint of caramel that is balanced with some grapefruit and a bit of resin. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. This is the first time I've had this beer, its a nice mild pale ale. I could use some more hops, but I don't think that's what Founders was going for, probably shooting more for an entry level craft type beer. Nice solid beer that might end up in my fridge when non beer geeks are coming over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy gold-orange with a white foam that dissipated quickly without lacing. Smell is caramel malt and light citric pith. Carbonation zings the tongue then fades into a mild citrus pith and resin bitterness. Some grassy elements. Malt washes into semblance of balance. Medium body. Finish is fairly clean with slight lingering bitterness. Nothing to really complain about nor to rave of here. Solid pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: ...A great session beer! Tasty, but not overpowering; light, but with some complexity; alcoholic enough, but not so much that you'll risk it all on 2 beers. A nice summer time Pale Ale, that doesn't get bogged down in the nitty-gritty, this light, crisp, refreshing beer is as tasteful, yet playful as the Mucha gracing its label."
""
"a solid, super clean, super sessionable pale ale. not something that i would need to run out and get more of, but id definatly drink this again if i crossed paths."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to TheBishopco for this one!"
"Pours a hazy golden with a thin white head. Not much retention, and just a bit of lace. Aroma is of tart fruit,and grassy,piney hops. Body is light with just a bit of carnonation. Taste is hoppy upfront with a touch of bready malts in the finish. Far from the elite in this style, but still good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is pretty easy to drink and is quite refreshing. There is a pleasant flavor with light amounts of bitterness that makes it enjoyable. Just about sessionable. I find this one enjoyable enough to want another right now."

"Pours a pale copper with a half finger of head that does not stick around very long. There is the mild aroma of hops in the nose. The flavor profile is very drinkable with light maltiness and a nice dry hoppiness on the finish. One of the better pale ales out there."
""
""
"Overall, this is a really solid pale ale. It's not in any way an aggressive beer, but it's also super-easy drinking. Why people here in Alabama put up with shit pale ales like Sweetwater 420 is beyond me; more bars here should carry this very approachable craft beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden pour, slight haze, fine small head, good lacing. Smells like a lager, pine, a bit of grapefruit, bread. Taste is much the same, decent hops though fades quick, doesn't linger much on the palate. Possily my least favorite Founder's thus far, though still a solid beer, and a good pale ale - from someone who often isn't a huge pale ale fan."
"3.5 D: I like what they did with this that separates it from the majority of APAs which are much cleaner."
""
""
""
""
"O: Extraordinarily easy to drink and quite refreshing, but largely because the beer doesn't seem to ask much of the drinker– this is a pretty straightforward brew, with a light sweetness upfront followed by light bitterness on the finish, and the sweet/bitter qualities largely overshadow any particular flavors. I have nothing but love for Founders, but when I look to buy a pale ale in the future I will probably look for a different option."
"Light bodied with light carbonation too. It translates to thinness on the palate. Overall it's not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
""
""
"Overall a great session brew. Am tempted to stock up the fridge with some of these. A great intro for anyone getting into hoppier beers."

"o - pretty good but not on par with the rest of the founders lineup. it's been a while since i've had this so i'm going to check it against another to rule out the possibility of a bad bottle."
"Nothing really stuns me about this beer but it's unique enough to be Founders for sure. Very complex for a single-hopped pale ale. Incredibly well thought out and brewed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good showing again from Founders but this one doesn't bring as much to the table as their other beers.... although I don't think they were trying for anything spectacular. If you're looking for a solid ale this is it. Might be good for getting someone away from lagers."
""
""
"O: A nice, sessionable pale that is very drinkable and well balanced. Certainly won't kill the palate with hops (leave that to the IPAs) and does a nice job playing middle ground. Also does a nice job at showing off the aromaticity of cascade hops"
""
"This has a very nice flavor and enough body to satisfy my tastes. It also is well suited for drinking many at a time."

"O: a good beer overall, but could stand a bit more balance in the flavor. I attribute the skew towards bitterness to the dryhopping. Nice for the summer."
"Overall: a decent pale ale with a very classic flavor profile. I would have this again."
""
""
"O: Nothing spectacular but very enjoyable, and with a moderate ABV and very balanced flavors/mouthfeel it would be nice to kick back several during a game or warm summer afternoon."
""
""

"O- Meh... not really much to tell here. Very subtle and subdued all around. The hops aren't hoppy enough, the malts aren't malty enough. I'll pass on this in the future."
""
""
""
"Pours a golden amber with a medium lasting off white head. Aroma and Taste is citrusy piney hops, grapefruit, sweet caramel malt and some light grassy notes and a bit of a nutty flavor. Palate is a medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt some light grassy notes followed by some good grapefruit citrusy piney hops with a light dry nutty lingering flavor. Overall a good all around solid pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"The smell makes this beer what it is. The flavors are fine, but they're not potent enough or complex enough to satisfy. But the smell is divine."
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how refreshing it is. Each sip was nicely cooling and calming, while delivering even flavoring and bite throughout. The flavoring actually kind of petered out by the end, giving a rather mild impression to the overall quality of this guy. Regardless, the drinkability is huge, with nice freshness. Best served at a cooler temperature, this beer is a nice complement to any warm spring day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is light and smooth. No heavy coating of the tongue. Leaves you wanting more."
""
"O: It certainly didn’t seem dry-hopped, but it was still a good drink. This shows Founders has range: and from the ultra-thick alcohol monsters to the lightest of light pales, they always make it memorable. For this one, I’d be down for a six-pack any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Of all the styles of beer that Founders brews - and brews exceedingly well - it is somewhat surprising that the American pale ale is one that they've never excelled at. This dry hopped offering is rather unimpressive and, being inferior to several APAs from my own backyard, namely Yards Pale Ale and Victory Headwaters, I'd be much happier purchasing local instead."
""
""
""
""
"355ml bottle. Tumbler glass. Enjoyed on jun´11. Pale amber color. Yellowish creamy froth. Lasting crown,rings on sides. Citric hops & subtle maltiness to the nose. Citric flavor, bready notes. Thin & watery mouthfeel & finish. Medium body, correct carbonation. Dissapointing beer, unexpected from Founders."
""
"Overall - This is an exceptional case where the spirit of the beer is reflected accurately in the label, a nature-esque pixie gazing upon a stock of barley. It's a decent pale ale, but nothing really too surprising in terms of flavor."
"O - A decent pale ale. Although not the best example of the style, it's a solid brew. I could easily drink a six pack of these in one sitting. Good flavor and balance."
""
""
"O: Decent pale ale, though I've had better."
"Overall - A nice very drinkable pale ale that has a well balanced taste. Every flavour works well together and I could see myself drinking a number of these easily. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"O: A really delicious pale ale with a distinct citrus hoppy quality. Yum!"
""
"Overall – A nice easy drinking beer with a good hop shot. Flavorful and very refreshing."
"Quite a tasty pale, not in the top tier for sure, but its easy availability and tasty refreshingness make this a definite recommend."
""
"Well, it's no SNPA. Very yeasty - this is pretty much the only flavour. A restrained and balanced bitterness. Not bad, but pretty bland compared with other APAs I've tried. I suspect the age of the bottle has given the yeast plenty of time to grow and dominate, while the hops have faded somewhat. Oh well, I'll have to be wary of buying beers from webshops in the future."
"O: Too bitter and not enough hop flavor. Not bad overall. I liked the He'Brew Genesis slightly more, but it was close."
""
""
""
"O/D-Overall, this is a pretty legitimate APA. The flavor makes up for the slight nose. The flavor is not very unique or complex but it plays to my beer preference. Far too expensive at nearly $12 for a run-of-the-mill APA. Glad I only got a single. But still, a nice little beer."
""

"o: not what i expected, hardly any hops, kinda disappointed. oh well, founders makes plenty other tasty brews."

"M - Light body. Good carbonation. Clean, crisp and somewhat dry finish."

"O: Overall a slightly above average pale ale. It's tasty but i'd rather have one of my Homebrews or some snpa, dale's, or daisy cutter. I was quite disapointed with the aroma. If your gonna write on the label title that it's dry hopped, at least make it aromatic."
"overall: I scored a six pack of this stuff at my local bottle shop but two days later I went back for more and it was gone. I knew I should have picked up more when it was around, because this stuff is good and refreshing."

""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, received in a mixed 6-pack of the month from Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, Virginia, into a 14 oz """pint""" glass. Pours a straw amberish color with a one finger head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smells of hops with a slight piney smell. Tastes of lots of hops, slight malt, but a dry hop, like the bottle says, dominates. Finishes very smooth with not much aftertaste, with good carbonation. Overall, a good pale ale."
"Another light drinkable pale ale, fairly middle of the road."
""
""
"Pours a nice copper color, but with almost no head. Very sweet, almost pungent aroma. Overly sweet for a pale ale - it almost tastes artificially sweet (both I and the person I was drinking with said it tastes like Splenda was added to it). Nor is it very hoppy - I would never have guessed this was dry hopped. Also, way over-carbonated. Overall, not a great representation of an American Pale Ale, nor a beer from Founders."
"O- Pretty mediocre beer all in all, not bad, but there are much better selections in the style"
"Pours a hazy deep yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a mellow orange citrus hop. I the taste, a small hop, mostly citrus, and a bit watery. A small hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry and small citrus hop in the aftertaste. A bigger nose, but easy to drink and nice."

"O: A great American Pale Ale. Above average. Downright delicious. Love this with a light meal."

"Overall: A-. Would like to have this again and would be good to share with others."
""
""
"O- Very good pale ale without much to complain about. Everything is a little above average in my opinion and I would definitely buy this again."
""
"D/O: While not a home run, or even particularly groundbreaking, this pale ale does execute the style with technical proficiency. It is something of a sleeper; interest builds steadily from start to finish, eventually juxtaposing a nearly ideal malt bill with hops that are finally able to catch up. In fact, the malt qualities offer a welcome reminder of Founders Harvest Ale. Hops come in a distant second, although this beer stops short of seeming truly malt-focused."
"Pours golden with fluffy head and lots of bubbly carbonation. Aroma is big citrus peel and some nice sweetness. Citrusy hops with some pleasant sweetness starts the flavor, very light bitter, and a lingering sweet citrus left on the palate. Light-medium mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation. So drinkable, and maybe borders on the IPA style with a light malt bill. Awesome pale!"

"This pale ale is cloudy with a light orange amber color. I received a thin, half a finger's head and little to no lacing from this bottle. Nice color, though. Has a very sweet malty smell with a hint of citrus and grains. Faint aroma but very pleasant. The sweet malt hits first in the flavor, followed by a smooth rush of bittering hops and light grain, with a touch of fruit. This one leaves you empty handed on the finish, dry and watery. Very drinkable, though. Crisp feel with medium carbonation and a medium body. Overall the only thing I didn't like was the finish in the mouth. Founders has a lot to offer, and I wouldn't make the pale ale a top priority to try among a lot of the other brews. But this is a good, mild session beer."

"O: Perhaps an old bottle, the date LOOKS like it said it's from August of 2011, so it's probably a bit dated though it was kept in the fridge the whole time. Either way, I don't care much for this, there's just not much to make me want to try it again."
"An unmistakable APA if a bit milder than the likes of Sierra Nevada. Maybe not one to seek out, but definitely one to be thankful for if it was handed to you as you walked in the door of a friend's house."

"Overall though very interesting. It does sort of remind me of Bell's Pale Ale but nowhere near as bad, considerably better by far. It's alright."
"three finger frothy head on a pure golden, hazy body. lots of lacing and nice head retention. Aroma is a nice orange peel and grapefruit. A little soapy. I felt this to be very aromatous but many other reviewes didnt feel so. May be due to this one being bottled. The flavor is actually a little disappointing. Flavor is more soapy and way to watered down. There is a very light earthy and citrus mote. Light to medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall aromatous but watered down is what I take from this. I love Founders but I this one let me down in the flavor."
"Not sure why it's taken me so long to review this guy, especially considering how many times I've had it in the past year or so... Oh well, here goes: It pours a clear light amber topped by a finger or so of dirty white foam. The nose comprises pine resin, mint, a touch of menthol, light spicy greens, and soft caramel. The taste holds notes of pine needles, lightly toasted caramel, light balsa, grass, light greens, flowers, and the slightest possible touch of orange peel. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a pretty enjoyable pale ale, one that's not too hoppy, but doesn't go too far in the other direction either. It's almost too easy to drink at times..."

"O - Tasty APA, nothing jaw dropping but a very solid go to session brew. I like how the malty sweetness is more profound than in most APA's"
"Poured a one inch custard yellow head of velvety foam. The body is a slightly hazy golden yellow color. The smells is rather nice with rich malts and mild hops in a medium complex combination. Taste is a pretty close approximation of that smell, though I have to admit I'd wished the flavors had been stronger. It's a wee salty but not overdone."

"This poured a golden color with a light foam on top. There’s a light hop (piney) aroma to this. It’s crisp, which I like, with some dark citrus notes and piney pine playing around on the palate. A little chewy sweetness rounds out a nice finish. It has a real pleasing hop profile—thanks to the Cascade hops—and I don’t expect my pale ales to all be big and hoppy but it’s almost as if the volume is turned too low on this one to really appreciate the nuances. It’s a good pale ale but this is Founders and I expected something, well, amazing."

"O: Good pale ale. Perhaps not as hoppy as advertised but decent."

"o - i was expecting more out of this. good, sessionable pale ale but nothing mind-blowing or anything that really stands out."

""
""
""

""
"D - This is a very standard pale ale. Some hops, quite a bit of malt, very drinkable. Nothing to write home about."
""
"O- I was expecting a lot more hoppy characteristics in this beer, the bottle may be a little older which would explain the lack of hoppy notes. I will have to revisit this beer when its fresh."

""
"M - The beer had a light-er feel to it, very smooth, the right carbonation and extremely easy to drink. The beer also had a nice hoppy aftertaste, but not too hoppy. Perhaps the beer was hoppier than expected from an APA, but this is easily one of the best APAs that I have tried. This will be a constant in the beer fridge. How this beer is not in the Top 50 of APAs I do not know."
"O: Founders is a superstar in the brewing world no doubt -- they do everything well, and there are several things (BA stouts and ales, IPAs, porters, heavily hopped APAs) that they do exceptionally well. This beer bear that out even further."

"An Ok beer from a Great brewery."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops present. Taste is hoppy up front, some citrus notes, malts kicking in towards the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is as decent brew."

"Some may say this is pretty standard for an APA due to the use of Cascade hops. They would be right, however I think Founder's has done it right. Very tasty brew with lots of character."

"Nice copper look and lovely white head, but the underlying pale ale is somewhat one-dimensional--lots of grapefruit, some pale malts, some unresolved sweetness and not enough bite, body on the light side--and Cascade not being my favorite hop, I would probably give this a miss in the future. Anyone who likes Cascade should give it a shot, though!"
"O - A tasty pale ale that's easy drinking and possesses a nice balance. Nothing spectacular, but a solid hop presence to satisfy the criteria of the style."
"O - a very pleasant and drinkable APA. A bit timid, however."
"Clear gold in appearance, very nice look, with good foam. The smell is the hoppy you want in a pale ale, invites you to taste this beer. Mouthfeel is hoppy in and on tongue, then it is gone, nice. Taste is crisp and clean with an nice balance of hops. Overall this is a fridge worthy beer. An anytime beer that will go well with any side order. We want this on tap at the local pub."
"The finish is a bit bitter but not overly long. A well-rounded pale in which the aroma is perhaps the best aspect."
"O: Solid APA, would expected nothing less from Founders."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall it was a pretty easy drinking and nicely flavored beer. It wasn't an overly hoppy version of the style, nor did it really wow me in any category. Overall I though it was pretty tasty, drinkable, and an above average but not outstanding beer."
"Yellow gold in color with a thin head of carbonation. Little to no lacing. I am getting maltiness, grapefruit and orange peel from the aroma, the latter 2 not very strong. The beer tatses similar to the aroma but with much more grains coming through in the middle and finish of the flavor. The mouth feel is light but I am definitely left wanting more. Good session beer - very balanced. Not the best APA, but not bad at all. Perhaps their Rye beer spoiled me a bit..."
"Appearance is a light amber with a moderate pale white head. The scent is excellent and strong, with a bouquet of citrus. The taste is more subdued. Hops are most prominent, with a tart grapefruit flavor and a slight bitterness, but the malts are not totally pushed away; it's pretty well balanced. Mouthfeel seemed ordinary. This would make a good starter beer for those wanting to move toward the hoppy end of the scale."
"Not a bad pale ale but probably won't pick it up again"
"Pours a hazy orange color with a nice 2 finger white head that retains. Smells of oranges, grapefruit, malts, and a little hop presence. Crisp and fresh smelling. Taste is pretty smooth with plenty of citrus fruits in this APA. A nice bitter finish leaves the palate dry. Mouthfeel is fairly thin but nicely carbonated. Overall a very sessionable pale ale."
"Overall - Pretty good for an APA."
"Overall, this is just a good beer. It doesn't really blow you away, but it doesn't disappoint either. It has no real flaws, except perhaps lack of depth, but the rich Cascades are nice enough for me. I could easily drink a lot of this, and I'd have no reservations buying this again."
"Pale golden color. Finger of head. Smells faintly of citrus and piney hops. Smells like I'd expect--as if it will be thin and only mildly hoppy. That is the taste indeed but it is certainly refreshing. Nice balance of hops and malt. Mouthfeel is thin. Great session beer."
"Overall, this is the best pale ale that I've had. The balance between the malt and hops is just about perfect. It's very refreshing, and I would recommend it if you're looking for something light."
"O- I enjoyed the dry-hop work, but otherwise it's only an average pale ale for me."
"O: Nothing special, just a simple, solid APA. Surprisingly lacking on hops which is why I scored it a little lower than I wanted to. I think this is closer to an EPA than an APA. Definitely a good starter beer if you're trying to get into the style. 35 IBU says everything, very little bitterness."
"Overall this is a solid brew (they can't all taste as good as Breakfast Stout) and a good representation of the style. It would be a good choice for a newb, or if you're trying to bring a good, craft, sixer to a party and actually have people enjoy/drink it. Cheers!"
"O- Maybe I'm having an off day when it comes to tasting, but this beer didn't impress me one bit. Boring, bland, and an all around disappointment. Don't worry about it Founders, you can't hit it out of the park every-time. Not recommended. Cheers."
"Pours a beautiful orange golden amber, with a thin head that dissipates rather quickly. Some turbidity present. Pine and citrus hops hit the nose first, although they seem a bit subdued with the strong woody malt character that shows through next, mild caramel to finish. Caramel, grass and pine anchor the flavors, a bit woody and paper, perhaps a bit oxidized. Body is lacking, seemed a little watered down, not balanced to hop bitterness, and husky on the tongue. Not what I expected from founders."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this one pretty drinkable and its not a pale ale I’d pass by when given the opportunity to drink it again. That said however, there are other Pale Ales I prefer and would pick in preference in the future. My overall impression is of a good workman-like beer that is a nice middle of the road pale ale that would find its natural place at an evening of good food and good conversation shared with friends."
"(O) This one kind of caught me off guard. The label says Dry Hopped Pale Ale but it's not overly hoppy. Most pale ales that I've had give a bit more to the grainy, hoppy side of the brew. They usually have a great malt base but remain pretty hopped up. This one wasn't as aromatic and was sweeter on the taste. it was by no means a bad brew, just not what I was expecting."
"Overall: Nice. Sweet and slightly bitter. Excellent flavor."
"Slight carbonation which makes it nice and refreshing. Not too heavy. Really an easy drinking beer. Perfect post hockey game libation ;)"
"Easy to drink, if you don’t expect too much from the hops – just enough to even everything out, and lo and behold – you’re ordering another…"
"Overall, a standout Pale Ale deserving of its year round production. If this was available to me I'd pick it up frequently."
"Color and clarity were great, light head although it looked a bit chunky...nice. Aromas were as expected from a Pale..nice piney and a bit hoppy. Taste was average, but a nice refreshing taste. Carbonation was on the medium side, but the malt presence really worked for me. The warming of this was exactly what I was wanting. For the style it is upper class. Nice and fresh and a good example...not too harsh, not too bland...a good balance. Not my favorite Pale but a very good one."
"O: just a decent overall brew, not bad at all, drinks very nicely, nothing outstanding but i would imagine it is a good session brew"
"The taste was decent, it wasn't a bad beer at all, nothing about it really stood out in any special way. There is a bit of hop bitterness upfront with citrus and caramel malts in the middle that end with a very dry after taste. I thought this one was on the light side with a bit of crispness. Overall I'm glad I gave it a shot and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys American pale ales."
"O: I'm a little disappointed in this one. Its underwhelming and could use more hop presence in the aroma and the taste."
"Solid fresh hop ale. Could've used a bit more carbonation, but really good overall."
"Pours a clear gold with a thin heaad that disappears quickly. The aroma is floral with hints of caramel and dough. The flavor is spicy caramel with mild malt sweetness and strong hop bitterness but not overwhelming. It's mouthfeel is mediumn, dry and refreshing. Founders Pale Ale is a decent beer, recommended."
"I love Founders - I was just debating this past weekend whether Founders or Bells is my current favorite brewery. Sadly, this is the first """miss""" I've had from Founders. I really hope it's the last."
"D - Super drinkable. Solid pale ale and a great session brew. Could have used just a bit more flavor and kick to it through."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"SOLID, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"Overall: This is a fairly tasty and decent pale ale but the taste and body isn't quite full enough to be a true representation of an American pale ale. The flavors that are present are pretty good. Its more like a light version of a pale ale."
"Another fine beer from Founders and a fine example of the style"
"O: Yum. 4"
"Pretty ho hum. I do believe this is my idea of a session beer."
"I am guessing the """Pale Ale""" is the same as the Dry Hopped Pale Ale I am reviewing here. Anyway, the appearance is a nice copper slightly cloudy. Great carbonations is giving the beer a nice froathy white head that appears to be lacing nicely. The nose includes subtle pine and weak citrus. The taste is failry smooth with pine beginnings then it turns malty and a slight roast/smoke tange at the end. Mouthfeel is fine it can be sessioned."
"Cheers!"
"This beer poured out as a nice golden color. The head was white and it pretty thick looking. The smell of the beer is hoppy and malty, smell like it's well balanced. The taste of the beer is pretty good but kind of falls short in my opinion. The mouthfeel of the feel is nicely carbonated. Overall it's a good social drinking Pale Ale, it's a good brew to offer people who might be interested in drinking Craft brews."
"Pours from a bottle Ito a snifter a light golden amber with minimal white head that fades quickly. Decent lacing. Aroma is light and yeasty. Mouthfeel is light, slightly dry. Taste is of slight hops, slightly piney, yeasty, and grassy. Tasty, light summer time brew."
"12oz bottle. Bottled On Date of 04/29/11. Pours a translucent amber color with very little head. No lacing. Aroma is sweet and hoppy. Some citrus in the nose. Hint of floralness. Taste has a lot more malt flavor than I expected. Floral hops, grains and some pine. Resiny pine at the end. Pretty dry. Flavorwise this has alot more pine and floral hops to it than the aroma indicated but it's still pretty good. Overall, solid Pale Ale."
"I recommend it, and I am enjoying it as I type. If you see it in the store give it a shot, but beware of the price. I have noticed that this beer is very pricey for an American beer. I think 13.xx (6 pack) is a little too much to pay for a standard craft American Beer."
"Sample from a bottle with no freshness date. Light copper in color with hues of yellow on the edges of the glass. Not much head on the pour, but a light wispy cap. Biscuit and light toasted malt aromas with a hint of floral and citrus hop. Smooth feel with a tangy hop bite toward the finish. Flavor is similar to aroma with toasted malt and biscuit with an underlying tangy cirus and floral hop bitterness beneath. Finishes with a tangy, crisp, semi-dry bitterness. A very pleasant and easy-drinking pale ale."
"O- one of the best pale ales out there. it gives sierra nevada a run for its money. check this out if you havnt yet."
"O (D) - I think this is pretty good. But there are other pale ales i'd rather have (alpha king). SOlid brew."
"O: I have no major complains about this beer, its defiantly worth a try. It’s up there with the best APA that are readily available."
"I'm disappointed with this one to be honest. Founder's has always been one of my go to breweries and this one didn't quite deliver the goods. For a pale ale that labels its main distinguishing attribute as being dry hopped, I was expecting more of a bitter kick. I'll have to seek out a fresher bottle to see if its any better."
"Really a nice balanced easy drinking pale ale with a lot of character. Fresh and floral on the nose...similr hop impression on the flavor but more malt than expected here...kind of a caramel drizzled biscuity malt flavor....drinks easy...medium bodied at best....perhaps more of a light medium bodied...very nice pale ale."
"A decent beer overall, nice, clean hop and malt flavors although they are somewhat subdued. The beer is only about a month old. Normally a hoppy beer is ok at that point but what stands out is that the malt flavors are also somewhat muted at this point."
"Overall - A decent offering from the great founders brewing. MIld flavor, low alcohol, not to sweet, not to bitter, just a good overall easy to drink beer."
"I give a Schlitz for Founders' Dry Hopped Pale Ale; but for the price, I'll pass."
"After having been blown away by the first Founders product I had (Red's Rye PA), I have been less impressed by the others I have had. The Centennial IPA was mediocre, lacking the hop kick I was hoping for, especially with the Centennial right in the name. Same can be said about this Pale Ale. The label calls attention to it being a Dry Hopped Pale Ale. I get very little hop aroma from it after pouring into a pint glass. There's some bitterness (label states 35 IBU) but the malt backbone seems to dominate. Not a bad thing, just not what I expected given the label calling out the dry hopping and Cascade hops used. Maybe I've just been trying too many West Coast brews when I can find them here in MA. I fully expected much more hop aroma and flavor due to the label's description. Again, not a bad pale, just not what they seem to advertise it to be."
"Not off the charts flavor wise, but the drinkability is killer. A poundable Pale Ale."
"A decent offering, but nothing that overwhelms. The aroma, frankly, is almost non-existent, and the taste is light and easy. If I'm going to have a session-tasting beer, I'd like it to actually be a session beer, not a brew clocking in at 5.4%. In that vein, give me a Founder's Endurance any day over this ale from Founders."
"Overall a decent beer but nothing I would seek out. Flagship, classic, reliable, but a false impression (especially given other Founders beers and the """dry-hopped""" labeling)"
"Pours out a golden brass color with a thin off white head that has minimal retention and lacing. The nose has a pine and bread with a sweet malt scent to it. The taste starts out with a sweet caramel maple like taste mixed in with some orange that follows some biscuit and finishes off with some pine. The mouthfeel is rather watery with not much consistency. Overall a very unimpressive beer, and a big disappointment coming from one of the best brewers in Michigan."
"Very refreshing."
"Overall an average APA, not overally impressive."
"Pours a clouded gold. A ring patches the glass a little. Smell is piny, sharp hops that are woody, and almost a bit sweet & smoky. Definitely pick up the dry hopping on the taste. Sweet, oily goodness, with a moderate malt backing. Finishes tight. A decent pale ale for sure, seems hoppier than its 35 IBUs.."
"Founders Pale is a solid APA. I ordered a couple of them last night and was happy."
"Overall I'm not too impressed and find their double trouble to be a much better experience."
"O- This is a solid true to the style beer. Falls right in the middle for a great American Style Pale. This is one I could sit down and have more than one for sure and overall its a winner for this brewery"
"O-A decent beer, so far the worst I've had from Founders but that isn't say much of anything. But if you can only get one Founders beer don't pick this one."
"O - while it's a good APA there are others I'd reach for over this one."
"O: the finish is the best part of this beer, and it isn't enough to rescue it from mediocrity. For a dry hopped APA, it lacked sufficient hop character, IMO."
"O: The label describes everything you anticipate and it unfolds without fail. Its a bona fide APA, comes recommended."
"I enjoyed this beer, but probably wouldn't buy it again for the simple reason that Founders makes other beers (like Red's Rye and Centennial) that are just as available and (to my palate) a bit more satisfying. I'd give this beer higher marks, but I usually like a bit more maltiness out of this particular style."
"Not great for the style, and in fact, one of the worst pale ales' I've had. I expect better from Founders. All in all, it actually smells, drinks, and feels like a ok pilsner."
"Impressions: The smell, even though it was dry hopped, is a bit weak. The hop bitterness is maybe just a bit too much on the finish, although it is spot on at every other part of the mouth. The mouth wetness leaves my mouth feeling like I just had a fluoride treatment at the dentist, which I don’t care for, OK that is exaggerating a bit, but it does lean in that direction."
"656"
"Overall, a terrific APA that I will come back to again and again. It's so well balanced that it may lose points for some people. I put it easily in the same class as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"Taste is hoppy but oddly muted by the nitro. Very smooth and creamy. Highly unusual bit well tasty."
"Great brew that while iin Michigan I was drinking a Bell's Two Hearted Ale and when I finished it the watress put me oon this brew. Wow I loved it before this brew I thought the best simple Pale Ale was Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Not anymore Founders pale ale uses cascade hops and is a very easy smooth drinking Pale Ale. A tad sweet finish, light alcohol and worth every penny. Drink this beer and you'll never drink a Sierra Pale Ale ever again."
"Good drinkability, and a good beer overall, but I must say that I was disappointed that the dry hops seemed to bring out the earthy and herbal tones and not the sweet, oily hop character. Will definitely drink this beer again."
"A very balanced APA. Pours a hazy amber, thin white head that does not last very long. Smells of flowers and has a fresh scent. Love the smell. Taste is of floral hops, balanced, slightly bitter, with a dry receding mouthfeel. Overall, a nice balanced APA. Founders rarely disappoints."
"O: Just a wonderful APA."
"Into the snifter it goes. A glorious orange, hazy, with sexy legs. Smells vaguely of some citrus and malt, not very exciting but there is a little going on. A quick hit of soft bitterness rolls into the malt and more or less dies. Little bit of citrus and pine hop flavor. Decent body, bitterness I'd like a bit more of. A little more hop presence too. Strange too that this is dryhopped. Not really getting that punch of aromatics out of this beer. Age?"
"O- Overall ok, but may be due to how old it is."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. i'd like a more decidedly american hop presence, but i like it regardless. it's certainly not going to be mistaken for an english pale or an american ipa, so it's doing something right. one i've had many times before and will surely have many more. good stuff."
"Under a finger of off-white froth. Hazy golden and some sticky lacing. Citrus and a bit of weird sour earth...not sure how else to describe it. Taste falls a little flat. Bitter and floral, but it's nothing that makes me really excited. Mouthfeel is light and dry. Not the best beer coming out of Founders...I'd be hard-pressed to pick this one up over a Red's Rye."
"Poured a cloudy burnt amber, with no real large head. What was there faded quickly but left a film of gooey, drippy lace skimming on the top, lots of eddys and swirls rounding about on it. Deep dripping lace down the glass, and a bit of a bubble stream coming up from the bottom. Smell was big and strong. Big citrus players here, lots of orange and grapefruit. Very sweet smell, like orange sherbert or candy. Very nice and plesing to the nose, smells like it will be a winner. Taste struck me as odd, after all the sugary itrus in the smell, none really came through in the taste. There was a strong bitter hop presence, providing lots of IBU's however it was more of a pine,resiney type of hops, rather then the sweet candy orange that came through at first. Nice and crisp, clean, very dry and long lingering finish, leaving a taste of burntor raosted pine for several minutes after a sip. Goes down very smooth and clean, not overally carbonated, and not syrupy either."
"Bottle. Poured into a NB tulip glass a clear honey, amber color with a 1 1/2 finger off white head. Subtle aroma of orange and grapefruit, not overly in your face but there. Semi sweet start with a nice transition to a light/medium level of bitterness. Ends rather crisply with some lingering bitterness. Nice lace. Medium mouthfeel. A tish more carbonated than I would prefer and ever so slighlty takes away from the flavors. No real trace of alcohol. Overall, I nicely balanced beer and easily drinkable."
"I was really hoping for more, seeing this is one of my favorite breweries, but it is what it is. Poured in Sam Adams Perfect Pint, chilled, not frozen. One finger head of white, medium foam. Little broken lace, with little cling. Color is a 6 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is high in roasted malt and some citrus. Taste is balanced, but lacking in real body. Flavor of roasted wheat, sweet barley, and citrus. Mouthfeel was somewhat creamy and had some zing, but just seemed to be missing something, just can not lay my tongue on it. Maybe I am in a off day or just got a bad bottle. I think there is better Founders APA out there, I just got a bad bottle....I hope."
"O: The perfect summer day-drink for hours beer. Refreshing, light, simple, and crisp. Flavor could use a bit more character but overall, this is a solid example of its style."
"O: I didn't find this beer offensive in any regard, but I also didn't find anything particularly interesting about it. I expected much more from the dry-hopping, which turned out not to have much effect. There is nothing in here that impedes drinkability, but there's also nothing that keeps you coming back for more. With so many tasty American pale ales out there, I don't think I will choose this again."
"Easy drinking! Go does extemely smooth. Nothing complex or overpowering about this, but hits the spot with a nice pale ale and could easily enjoy a couple of these on a sunny afternoon."
"For those looking for a gateway beer, this could be the one. Try it, you wont be disappointed."
"Mouth feel is goodly carbonated. I found the beer to be easy to drink and fresh tasting. A good example of the style."
"D. A poor pale ale indeed. I hope the other Founder's beers I have are better than this rather tasteless thin bodied ale. Have another one of these that I was going to save until the end of the year but it isn't worthy enough to save until Christmas/New Year. Did I really pay £7.56 for 2 bottles of this rubbish?!!!"
"D - Very high. This is a nice tasty beer for a hot summer day. Very refreshing, and I could drink several of these in a row."
"O- Very drinkable and great tasting. Founders has not let me down yet with any of there approaches. Cheers Founders !"
"Not nearly the best pale ale I've had, unfortunately. I can see myself drinking this on a hot summer day, but not in many other situations. I love Founders, but mediocre is the best way to describe this beer, I think. Meh."
"O - Surpising off-flavors. Possibly a bad bottle?"
"Overall: As mentioned earlier, a pretty easy drinking beer -- nice flavors that are pleasantly bitter and come across as refreshing and tasty without presenting anything to """think about.""" Moderately low ABV also makes it pretty easy to drink."
"Very nice, easy drink. Nice on the light malt flavor, and good level of bitterness. Nice coloring and fair head retention - kept alive to the bottom of the glass. Not much there in hop aroma - true to style (I note that it's 100% cascade). Great warm weather pint."
"Overall this was a good Pale Ale. This beer was pretty flavorful while still being very drinkable. This would make a good beer for the summer time when you are active in the outdoors. A lot of American Pale Ales tend to be very close to being an IPA, this one wasn't and I liked that. I don't think I would buy a six pack of this, but one at a restaurant with dinner would be nice. I think bell's pale ale is better but this one was good and would probably be better if it was fresh, I'll try and track down a fresher one and see if my opinion changes but for now Bell's is on top."
"Textbook APA, flavorful yet highly drinkable. Not the most flavorful APA out there, definitely could use a dash more of hops but not a bad everyday beer."
"O- Great beer if your weary of the highly hopped IPA's but still want some hops in your beer. This is a great brew to just quaff while sitting back and watching tv and would pair well with anything."
"(119)"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A very crisp and drinkable pale ale. My main gripe with this beer is that it is perhaps a little too sweet with caramelly malts. I get almost a sort of sickening sweet floral note all throughout. It is medium bodied and quite dry on the finish. Very crisp."
"O:"
"Drinkability is fine. Just not a drink that yells """have another"""."
"Certainly a solid pale ale, but it doesn't really stand out from the pack. Strikes me as just kinda meh."
"Lingering pine and citrus linger on the tongue. This is a nice oily pale ale that really goes down well."
"D: had to come to harrisburg to find a Founders beer but once they come to MD I can see myself buying this as much as SNPA."
"Drinkability: This would definitely be a welcome hopped up addition to a BBQ in the summer, but it does not quite find its place into my regular lineup."
"D -- A nice pale, worth a try."
"A good beer for a warm summer afternoon on the porch."
"D- A very drinkable PA with a strong hop presence."
"Aspirin = suck."
"D- A very nice, accessible unfiltered pale ale, I'd pick this one up again, especially with some buffalo wings."
"This is a nice drinkable pale, but nothing too special. Definitely a solid beer by a great brewery, and one that I am glad I tried."
"The dry hopping in this beer is a nice touch compared to other pale ales. A good beer with reasonable drinkability. Some may consider it too bitter for its style, but the perception of bitterness fades as more of it is consumed. I would buy this again."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, but not the best pale ale I've had. That said, I'd drink it again for sure."
"Serving: Poured from a bottle into a Saint Arnold's pint."
"EDIT 11-11-11 had this one again, liked it a bit better the second time around. Bumped the overall half a point. I could taste a tinge of grapefruit on this round, overall I liked it a bit better than the first time."
"Overall: A good pale ale."
"This pale ale pours slightly hazy and appears orange in color. The aroma is of hops, with some citrus notes. The taste was decent, but not great. The beer is not aggressively hop forward, nor does it have a substantial malt presence. The beer has a thin body and finishes with some hop bitterness. Overall, I found this to be a decent, but unexciting offering from a world class brewery."
"Oh! and on a side note.. The labels were falling off much like the one in the picture here ;0)"
"Poured from a 12oz into an oversized snifter...a soft clear orange with a generous white head that left a slime-like lacing on the glass as the head vanished. Smells like citric lemony candy...really nice. pretty bitter on the mouth. a touch of a hoppier pale ale. finishes a bit sweet and leaves a pretty dry aftertaste. not a bad pale ale, but not one i'd run for. smells and looks better than it tastes, but an easy drinker."
"D - I think the drinkability is good. Like I said, It goes down easy and leaves you feeling refreshed. It would be very easy to drink a 6-pack of these."
"drinkability - not good - the only weak link in founder's armor - i have had this beer a few times before but didn't want to throw up a negative review but this beer just never got better - shame on you founders"
"Easy to drink, refreshing and flavorful. Terrific example of the style."
"Founders Pale Ale is a bit lackluster, it is a hazy orange amber with little head retention. It does have enough hop flavor or bitterness and is a too sweet. I like a malty pale ale, but not one this sweet. The body is slightly thin and under-carbonated. However, this is perfectly drinkable and enjoyable, just not a wow beer."
"Into a pint glass, it poured golden, with one finger of white which retained and laced very well. Visible carbonation, but not overly done. Very floral, pear and apple in the nose; a little surprisingly for a 'dry-hopped' pale ale, but it smelled inviting nonetheless. The taste mirrored the nose, with floral herbal hops coming to the fore, mixed in a nicely balanced way with apple and pear malt notes, and finished on a very modestly dry note. Lightly carbonated, and medium-bodied. This is a great session pale ale, as long as you are not expecting a huge cascade-type citrus hop presence. A pleasant pale ale alternative."
"Appearence is golden with a amber tinge. Cloudy due to the dryhoping. Pours with small head and not much lacing. Slight hop and malt aroma. The earthy hops really come out in the taste. Hops are well balanced. No real strong flavors stand out. Medium body. Drinakablity is above average. Good session beer."
"This is a nice clean Pale Ale with big dry hopping notes that make it stand out a bit from the American Pale Ale crowd."
"This is probably my least favorite offering from Founders - not bad, not great - simply an average Pale Ale."
"D- The lower ABV of this pale makes it a example of a American """session""" beer. Good drinking beer that seems to be the common output from Founders."
"Pours a straw yellow, cloudy, unlimited head... Normal pour produced only foam. Took forever to die down and finish the pour. Lacing is incredible. Flecks in the body, carbonation always rising. Nose of apples, grapefruit and pine. Hoppy, as expected! Lightly bitter from start to finish. Sour and hoppy at the back. Bready aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel. Highly drinkable."
"Light mouthfeel; highly drinkable and flavorful, but a little less than I hoped and was expecting. Guess I need to change my """favorite style""" to American IPA."
"Very nice sessionable beer from Founders."
"I poured into a pint glass to one finger of off white head. It is amber colored and hazy. The aroma is citrus hops. The taste is rather bland. I get faint citrus and sweet malt. I expected more of a hops presence. It's an ok beer but it does not stand out in any aspect."
"MF/D- Medium bodied with a good feel from the carbonation level. Drinkability is amazing. I'd have no problem having another. A very good pale ale."
"Slightly cloudy orange-yellow pour with quickly fading head and decent lacing. Pleasant but subdued floral notes with a touch of citrus in the nose along with a hint of straw and grass. Taste mirrors the smell, but with a bit more bitter hops than I had expected for a pale ale which was a nice surprise. Unique earthy, but fruity hop character with enough sweet, bready malts to balance it out nicely. A tart, crisp and dry finish that makes this quite drinkable with a nice mouthfeel. This makes the fourth great beer in a row I've had from Founders. Quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"The flavor is bitterer than the smell but the lemon citrus aspect is focused and well executed. Pretty straight forward and well balanced. Ht body isn't too thick and the drinkability is very good."
"I guess I was expecting more from the people who give us KBS. They make some crazy big bears at Founders and I expected their dry hopped pale to have more oomph to it. Still good, though."
"12oz bottle into my Orval glass...Dark honey gold with a light tan head, two fingers of head, good retention ok lacing...Really nice aroma, light caramel, grass hops, light metallic hop...Taste is not as successful, not impressive really, light bitter, chalky, metallic hops aftertaste, misses the grass, just blah overall."
"The beer is a light gold color with a thin white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. The aroma is of fruity citrus, hops and light caramelized malts. The taste starts out with a nice burst of grassy hops bitterness. Then a citrus and caramel sweetness comes in to provide a good balance. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet. Smooth and crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is dry and slightly sticky."
"Overall impression: Now that we're getting Founders in SC, I hope we get this in bottles, because it's got """beer fridge staple""" written all over it."
"Simple and enjoyable is the name of the game. An easy drinker and a nice pale ale."
"Taste, light enough on the palate, but a fair degree of bitter and hopping to satisfy, yet be accessible to those not chasing numbers. A really good pale ale from the Midwest. Perfect weekday beer."
" ~ Overall this is a brew I would really like to like. Founders is a great brewery and deserves every benefit of the doubt, seeing as they've earned it with the lineup of every other beer they brew being so solid. I'm going to give this beer an average rating overall. However, don not let this sway you from sampling others they have created for our consuming pleasure."
"Overall - A pretty good beer... nothing too exciting but very drinkable.... certainly worth a try..."
"D- easy drinking, solid pale ale."
"D- Crisp and refreshing, dry spicy, hoppy finish, nice balance at 5.4% alcohol."
"D: A nice flavor profile, but still a easy drinking brew. Flavors on the lighter side, but still good lingering tastes."
"Mouthfeel is ok, but the carb is too high for me, it's distracting. This beer is average for Founders, but better than many others. Enjoyable but I like more interesting and expressive flavors in an APA."
"D: it was a very drinkable pal ale that had a good hop bite for the style. I wish pale ale's were as punchy as this one ."
"For me, this isn't high up on the list of APA's I enjoy. I find it just too aggressive and unbalanced."
"It was very easy to drink, this beer has good feel"
"Bottom line, I love this style and this is a very tasty beer. That said there's countless better examples of the style. This is at best average and perhaps a hair under average for the style. I love living in a world where this is average though!"
"D: Very good."
"MD- The feel is a step above thin with a crisp carb going for it. Finishes on the dry side leaving you wanting more, so this is pretty drinkable considering the taste could be amped up. Not my favorite but for sure worthy."
"D: It goes down easy, but I was extremely underwhelmed by it. Maybe it's because with Founders you expect nothing but the best. The worst Founders beer I have consumed so far."
"D- nice stuff for a warm day. Boldly hopped and rather refreshing."
"Overall- being much more of an ipa (india pale ale) fan this apa (american pale ale) was pretty hitting the bill. anyone who comes into this brew expecting a hop bomb you will be dissapointed. for the style (i'm not usually a fan of) this brew his the mark and maybe down the road when i'm in the mood for another apa this one will be top choice."
"Overall this as a light and easy-drinking beer with a nice hop presence. Worth a shot."
"I've never had it out of the bottle, but on-tap this was great. Founders nailed this one. Comparable to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale in my opinion."
"D: Very easy drinking, refreshing beer. Could drink multiple of these in a sitting. Very solid"
"Nice, hoppy, refreshing Pale Ale."
"D: Enjoyable. Went down a little too quick. Better than most so-called pale ales I've had."
"Founders does it again. Damn these great Michigan brewers (I guess we have a lot of great Buckeye brewers too)."
"D - Lower ABV makes this a very drinkable beer for a sixer. Nice beer."
"Light to medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Finishes very dry, which just doesn't seem to work here. It's fairly drinkable, but not quite tasty enough for me to want to go back for more."
"Drinkability-Yea I can drink it but I am disappointed. I much prefer PA like Sierra Nevada and Mighy Arrow from New Belgium."
"M/D: Medium to lighter body, average carbonation. Easy drinking APA. I could see this being a staple in the fridge. It would probably be my go to beer if it was on tap here."
"A nice bear for a session or if you're just looking to unwind after a long day at work."
"D - Great session beer but nothing spectacular for a Pale Ale. A decent beer overall."
"Pours a clear darker orange with a nice white head that stays around the edge. Nose is disappointing for being advertised as """dry hopped", where are the hops? Lots of pale malt in the nose and the taste, balanced by bitterness but not really hoppiness. Bitter long finish with some yeast. This is pretty disappointing,"
"drinks ok, but lacks anything that would make me reach for another. again, are they sure this is dry hopped?"
"D- Highly drinkable because the bitterness wants you to keep taking more and more sips. Overall, a nice, refreshing beer for a summer afternoon"
"Light body, lots of carbonation and overall a nice drinking PA. I like the dry hopping but it certainly don't take this to a hoppy heaven by any means. An easy drinking ale that I will revisit at some time but doubt I'll rush."
"D - Should be easier to drink than it is, although it's not difficult to get down."
"The flavors of fresh citrus hops balance well with nutty maltiness, where they alternate in dominance on the palate. But the finish is bitter."
"D: Very enjoyable, although not phenomenally interesting by any means. Your basic APA, although the dry hopping adds a bit to the hop flavor. Tastes like a lighter and more balanced version of their Centennial IPA, which is perfectly acceptable and to style."
"It's not a bad beer by any stretch, but Founders has certainly done better."
"drinkability: Great session brew. Enjoying it during a hot Georgia summer."
"D - A good beer. Could have a few of these on a hot summer day without hesitation. Not one of the best pale ales that I have had and certainly not one of Founder's better offerings, but still worthy of a try."
"D - Well overall I like it more than the IPA which seems to have west coast hops and taste soapy yet this beer was dry, hoppy, malty, and delicious. To buy it again would be individual or case considering the extreme price of craft here. Someday I will find founders cheap here..."
"pours a hazy orange yellow color with good white head that recedes quick, and good lacing. fizzy carbonation. pine hop smell and flavor thats slightly bitter, with some floral hints. light body with short flavor duration. great ipa but nothing special."
"Conclusion: Good, simple American Pale Ale. The hop aromas are prevalent, but if I didn't know this was dry-hopped I probably wouldn't have picked up on it. Solid quaffer, but at $10 for a sixer, there are several I'd pick up ahead of this one."
"A pale golden ale that pours with plenty of carbonation forming a bright, white head that settles to a thin layer of foam. Smells of citrus and pine, (mostly pine) well dry-hopped as advertised. Tastes of toasted malt and piney hops with some hard candy sweetness, but actually quite dry. Light-bodied with a somewhat spritzy mouthfeel and dry finish. Overall, an enjoyable and very quaffable pale ale. Extremely drinkable."
"D: very drinkable, a nice summer-y beer."
"Drinkability is good. Nothing too impressive about this one, but it's easy to drink."
"D - huge fan of Founders, but this is a bit - meh. slightly refreshing but cant get over the weird feel and aftertaste."
"Great example of a """boring""" style that I think is often over looked. (Myself included.)"
"D: Nice Pale Ale but the taste leaves a little to be desired. I could see ordering this at the bar when I'm looking for a nice refreshing yet hoppy beer."
"Drinkability: Nice and refreshing; a well-balanced APA"
"D: It was very easy to drink but the lack of a distinct flavor did not leave me with the feeling that I wanted another of these anytime soon."
"Drinkability - not impressed! I usually enjoy founders very much, but this lacked any taste, flavor, and complexity their beers usually contain. Next time I would pass on this beer. It looked good to start, but it was all downhill from there."
"Overall a gods APA. Nothing really stands out though."
"Overall, not a bad pale ale, but with all of the IPAs and DIPAs out there it is really hard to respect a beer like this. It is great and to the style, but I have grown accustomed to the more hopped up beers. Still, definitely drinkable and worth a try!"
"D- Very easy to drink. Again a well balanced out brew nothing is over powering here."
"So I've been hearing about Founders coming to New York for weeks and have been looking forward to the introduction since it was announced. I tried the Centennial first and didn't like it as much as I had hoped. The Pale Ale, however, was outstanding!! I have long been a proponent of the Captain Lawrence Pale Ale, which I love and have always thought it was a great alternative to Sierra Nevada. This pale ale however is a great combination of the two. Not quite as hoppy as the west coast versions, a little more filtered than Captain Lawrence. This is the quintessential session beer and if it's around for a while i'll drink it a lot."
"Would I buy more of it? - not sure. There are a lot better beers from Founders and as a hop fan I might go for something with a little more ooomh, but this one does qualify as a solid session APA."
"D: A good APA, but not a great one. I would like some more hop flavor/aroma additions, I would never guess that this was dry-hopped. I suspect that I would reach for SNPA before this given the likely price difference. Definitely worth trying, especially if you are tired of caramel sweet APAs. Recommended."
"D= 4.0 this would make a good session beer. It would have received a much higher score but I was comparing it to IPA's. For a pale ale this is really nice."
"taste has some grassy hops upfront,nice caramel midway through,finishes with some biscuity malt flavor.over all really nice and balanced.medium bodied,this is one style of beer i love to drink.you can whack back a few of these no prob,a great session beer."
"D: A decent pale ale, but not one of Founder's best efforts. Definitely doesn't live up to the likes of APAs like SN Pale Ale."
"D-Perfect for any occasion, from one beer on a mellow evening, to a moderate-sized session."
"this is the only beer i've had from founders that didn't knock my socks off. i know it's only a pale ale, but some of my favorite beer's are pale ales (dale's/sierra nevada) so i know they have the ability to wow. also, at 5.4%, this isn't really a session beer either, pretty much my favorite thing about PA's."
"Poured a cloudy orange color with a nice creamy head with a small lacing. Smell was piney and earthy and not very strong. Taste was roasted malts and hoppy with a very dry finish. Mouthfeel was light and a bit watery for me. Drinkability is decent but not what i was expecting. Not up to the standards of other dry hopped beers i like but not a bad beer overall."
"The bottle I drank was bottle on 02/01/10...1 month before I drank it so there was no freashness issues."
"D - I could see drinking this more towards the summer time but a good pale ale from one of my favorite brewerys."
"D-easy drinking, very crisp, would be nice on a warm day as it is low in abv and has a fair amount of taste for a pale ale. Nothing special going on; but a decent beer for the style"
"Distinct dry-hopping aroma - very herbal and tea-like, wiht a hint of dry hay. Up front the tea flavor predominates. Moderate sweetness and hops bittering follow. Finish is slightly dry and the hops do not linger long. A bit on the mild side for the APA category, but just edges out of the pale ale class. Reasonable ABV makes this a good session candidate."
"D: I can't get into the finish of the beer. The part that reminds me of drinking green tea and smoking cigarettes. More malt would be appreciated too."
"The thin and crisp body with low abv make this a sessionable beer, but it doesn't offer much depth or creativity. Founders is one of my favorite breweries and I'm guessing this one is brewed to appease those that are less adventerous or maybe just scratching the surface of craft brews."
"D - This was fantastic, an APA that almost tastes like an IPA. Founders continues to crank out great beers."
"It's a good beer to drink if it's hot out, having a lazy day, or watching some sports with friends. But I could think of a few more pales that I'd prefer in that case."
"Pours a hazy golden with a short, creamy head that leaves a bit of lacing. Smells clean, a bit grainy, and a touch fruity with some juicyfruit notes. Somewhat light. Tastes a bit light, and even a bit watery up front, but this is followed by more of that burst of juicyfruit and a dry herbal and citrus hop flavor. Crisp and fairly light in the mouth. Not bad, but the juicy hops could use more of a platform than the rather ascetic and thin base."
"Drinkability: It is official - Founders can do no wrong. Very solid APA overall with an emphasis on hops and an unusually dry body for an APA."
"The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, and the hop bitterness coats the mouth. The carbonation is lighter than expected, and the overall mouthfeel is somewhat disappointing. Especially for a Founders beer. Overall the drinkability is pretty good, but I wish the flavor and aroma were stronger, and the mouthfeel was better."
"I wasn't too impressed with Founders rendition of an APA. The taste balance wasn't that great and I just wasn't excited."
"Overall, not impressed but for 3 bucks, I get what I pay for."
"D - Drinks very nicely. A nice sessionable ale. Could probably use to be a bit more fresh with some more hop character, but that's on me, not the beer."
"Pours a hazy copper/golden color with a one finger head that is neither very creamy or fizzy. It retains at about a half of a finger for a fair amount of time. A tiny bit of lacing is left and the beer ends up looking almost like juice. Smell is big on malts and has a nice earthy hop backbone. I also get a tiny bit of citrus hop. The pale malts and grains are nice on the nose. I would like a bit more strength here as it is hard to get a large amount of anything on the smell. Taste has a very nice massive malt backbone. The hops are earthy and some are floral. There is nice hop taste melded in with the flavors and bitterness to compliment the overall taste and feel of the beer. It is very nice to get huge malts in an APA. The hops certainly help to add a nice backing to the malts though. Body is light but has some creaminess to it, which I like. The carbonation feels extremely smooth and there is no warming at all. Very nice feel for an APA. If this one was a bit cheaper it would be the ultimate session beer. It is however a very good example of an APA. It is like a classier, more complex version of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (the ultimate session APA). Founders continues to amaze me with the quality of their beers."
"Overall a much better beer than that which I had in a bottle years ago. I soon realized I had an old bottle which the flavors had faded. This is a great APA that can be drank anytime. Another winner by Founders."
"Ppretty decent pale ale of the dry hopped variety. Poured with a large fluffy, frothy, foamy off white head and lots of lace. Color is a clear light to medium amber. Aroma is not overly bold, but hoppy, malty, earthy, not much citrus. Flavor's about the same. Body is excellent and great carbonation. Nice clean balanced finish. Session beer."
"It's not bad, but there are a lot better choices out there right now. I don't factor in price when reviewing, but there are better values."
"D: Not my favorite beer from Founders, but overall pretty darn good. It's easy to drink, and quite sessionable."
"D: Light and crisp, well balanced, and refreshing."
"D: The appearance and smell of this beer are amazing. The taste and mouthfeel are lacking. I would choose Founders Centenial IPA over their Pale Ale."
"CHEERS!!"
"Pours a hazy golden color with two inches of white head that sits perfectly in the glass. The head had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Nice hoppy aroma with citrus and floral hints. Also hints of bready malt. The flavor also is hop centric. The hop flavors consist of oranges and pineapple. The malt has a little toasted element that helps balance things out. Bitterness is moderate. A nice refreshing flavor and it finishes clean. Medium body and nice carbonatin for a pale ale. A very drinkable APA but not sure if it is worth Founders prices. I like the low ABV as well so it is sessionable."
"Getcha some."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a slightly hazy gold with a sparse white head. Pretty subdued aroma of citrusy hops and some carmel malt. Solid malt base to this one with a crisp hop bite, but not a whole lot of bitterness. On the lighter side of medium body. Nice lingering dry finish from the hops, but not a mouth puckerer. Very drinkable, a solid Pale Ale."
"a very easy drinking pale ale although it has a bit more flavor than most pale ales. this is quite drinkable"
"A good clean beer all around. This could use oomph in aroma and maybe some flaked barley for a bit more foam presence and longer lasting head."
"D Very good and I believe that this is the main point. 4.5"
"D: Session beer that has big hop aroma and well balanced flavor. I would order another and buy a sixer."
"Another solid offering from Founders. I'm not the biggest fan of Pale Ale's, but I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these in a pinch."
"D- Really easy drinking brew that I would consider having around often."
"Overall, a pretty standard pale ale, not the best one I've had but it is good. I would buy it again."
"This would make an outstanding session beer. I could easily make a night of these. Solid pale ale from a solid company."
"Drinkable, and a pretty good session beer."
"Drinks pretty easy, but had higher expectations for this one, especially since it was about $11 a sixer, came back to Mizzou & found other Founders for $8.50, not cool..."
"Poured amber with a generous head with some staying power. Aroma was a nice, solid citrus. The taste fell a little short of the mark though. While I normally applaud the lack of bitterness, in this case, it would have aided a rather bland flavor. The feel is OK, nothing special here. Drinkability goes up on a hot, humid day."
"A good hand crafted pale ale that would be an excellent choice for first-timers. This ale's biterness/dryness sure keeps you thirsty!"
"Pours a cloudy light peach hued beer with a massive 1""" thick white foamy head. The aromas are strongly citrus hop characters of the Cascade hops. The flavor is less bitter than expected with a sweetened grapefruit flavor. Fluffy mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. This is a tasty example of a good dry-hopped APA."
"The carbonation is a bit much. Not a bad beer just really didn't do it for me."
"(D)- If you are looking for awesome balance in a Pale Ale, then this is it. Not overpowering in any direction. Its on the lighter side strength-wise. Superb citrus, hops, and creamy mouthfeel. An overall winner in my book for drinkability. A 6pk would not last long. Its also interesting to note that they used 100% Cascade hops in this beer."
"There may not be all that much complexity, but it's tasty and pure."
"Good, but was fairly pedestrian. Nothing wrong persay, just didn't shout out at me."
"D - Mostly smooth, but all the ingredients shine through. Perfect step back in hoppyness from the Centenial IPA. Very drinkable."
"Russet orange with tons of suspended yeast particles and blonde highlights with a medium cream colored head that leaves thick lace behind. The nose is citrus fruit, orange and lemon with a nice caramel malty background. The flavors are nice and fruity up front with orange and grapefruity hops balanced with caramel malt and just a touch of fresh, bread dough. The mouthfeel is creamy with fine carbonation. Highly drinkable if consumed fresh, I've heard this beer can oxidize pretty quickly."
"Taste: The flavor of this beer is dominated by the big flowery hops that are used. The yeast adds a little bit of a spiciness. Bitterness is a little higher than I expected but it's nice."
"D: Quite high."
"This isn't the tastiest Pale Ale I've ever had, but its got a crisp refreshing character that earns some points. Mouthfeel and light-body make it desireable on a hot summer day."
"Jordan."
"Poured in a pint glass. Appears a nice light copper color with a thin head. Wonderful floral aroma with a light citrus hint. Taste is on the lighter hop side with more tastes of pine, citrus and some light spice. Ends with a nice hoppy aftertaste. This beer had pretty good balance and quite smooth to drink. A good session beer. Nothing exceptional but will definately have again."
"A good example of the style that's drinkable. Nothing memorable but it succeeds where it should."
"This would make an excellent sessioner!"
"D- Big time session beer for me. Truly a pleasure to sip. Easy drinking."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a bite of carbonation."
"D: This isn't a bad brew, just not up to Founders' normal standards. There's just nothing special about it when compared with other APA's."
"Overall, for me, not enough malt balance from this pale ale."
"Incredible amount of hops for a pale ale; furthermore it tastes more like an india pale ale than a pale ale. Although, it doesn't have a lot of bitterness except the aftertaste. Overall, it is an exceptional pale ale and should be treated with respect."
"Pours a cloudy dark golden yellow color, way too much carbonation, huge three-finger head which took almost an half hour to pour, tons of sticky lacing, I think I got a bad bottle. The nose is malty, some hops, and not much else. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, not much hops at all. Medium body. Would not trade for this one again, but like I said, I'm sure it is a bad bottle."
"Hmm surprised people aren't loving this beer, but I guess I am not surprised that there often is not a lot of love here for lower ABV non- super hopped souped up beers... This is just a pale ale, and with in the style, it is excellent. Very light amber, clear, this beer has a damn nice head and excellent lacing down the glass, decent retention. Aromas of dry earthy herbal hops and pale malt, grainy. Perfect dry finish to this beer, just the perfect balance of dusty hops and a nice light biscuity maltiness. That's it. Very simple, very good beer. So drinkable. This beer will be lucky to survive 36 hours in the fridge..."
" I'd consider this a session beer even though it's over 5.20% ABV. It went down nicely and I couldn't feel any of the alcohol in this as I was enjoying it. This isn't the best APA that I've had, but it was solidy crafted and the dry-hoppiness of it kept it from being too over-the-top like so many other hop bombs that I've had over the years. Arguably the easiest beer of this style to drink..."
"Drinkability: nice APA that is easy to quaff. Definitely a solid beer that anyone will enjoy."
"Thin head but frothy and dimpled, off-white in color, credible lacing, dissipates at a rapid clip. More a gauziness than cloudiness, you can see through it from up close and yellow mixes with the orange to lighten the overall hue. The nose is grainy with oat, meadow grass elements, on the whole somewhat flat, corn with a little oiliness, the citrus indistinct, the malts impart a rye bread quality, for its relative cleanliness it is heavy and without much lift. Full-bodied, moves at a slower pace, not languid, but in no rush. More hoppy than malty without being so in a biting manner, just has that herbaceous graininess which keeps it dry and cresting on and off the tongue. For its weight the carbonation is noticeable and helps to funnel things forward. Orange, lemon citrus, not much, if any, grapefruit. More generic """resin""" than pine, some nuttiness and malted milk ball flavors. Entirely without flaws, however, needs a touch more verve."
"This is a fantastic APA, and has been my favorite one for a while now. Good job, Founders!"
"On tap at Carson's American Bistro in northern Ann Arbor, MI . It poured a hazy coppery golden and smelled of delicious floral and citrusy hoppiness. It had a pleasant citrus and hop taste with a decent bitter hop finish falling just short of an IPA. The body was a solid medium but lighter in color just as I'd want from a pale ale. This one went great with my mushroom burger and fries. A decently heavy yet very drinkable brew."
"D: Big Time drinkability. Quite a bitter-hoppy beer to categorize as just plain pale vs. IPA, but that's what makes it go down fast for me."
"D - Very smooth, interesting and refreshing."
"D: I've had one of these before and remember it being better. While this beer is a good beer, there is nothing about it which makes it stand out from the crowd. A decent, but standard, pale ale."
"overall it's east to drink and it's got a light feel to it, but the flavor isn't that great. The tart grapefruit aspect isn't too enjoyable for me. It's not bad but i woulnt buy it again"
"light taste - a little bit of flavor - not much in here. a bit disappointed. mouthfeel is super crisp, the hop is 'flash' comes and goes in seconds. and was super carbonated (was it a bad bottle?)"
"Taste starts out with a flash of grassy bitter hops, with citrus taking over late. Pretty good biscuit malt backbone. Finish is pretty dry. The pine/citrus combo is a bit too much for an APA, a bit too little for an IPA."
"Flavor is well balanced and refreshing. Strong citrus and pine hop flavors up front leading to a mild malt middle, but really light on this front, some underneath yeast character and moderate alcohol once the beer has warmed. Overall, well balanced, drinkable and clean."
"Nicely done. Balanced a bit towards hops, but certainly not out of balance, and quite drinkable."
"A little thin but at least drinkable. Carbonation is ok with a bit of lacing, white head atop a pale straw beer. Not the color or taste that I associate with a Founder's beer. A little on the light side on hops and mouthfeel. If this this dry-hopped then it is very lightly hopped. For a dry-hopped pale ale it is very weak. There are better offerings from Founders that your money can be spent on."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark-straw yellow with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was slight citrus hops and pale malts. Taste was loads of Earthy citrus hops well balanced with sweet pale malts. The beer was a tad heavier than what I'd expect for the style, but not too much. This is a decent pale, but not quite the best."
"Straight off the bat I am surprised and disappointed. I expected the best from Founders, but this one doesn't deliver. No aroma, and if there is, you have to try too hard to pick it up. Appearance is excellent, pillowy head that retains and gorgeous, thick lacing. Very sharp and crisp; the aggressive carbonation is like sandpaper scarping the tongue. Quite bland, hint of malt, hint of hop, dry and sometimes a bit metallic. A nice bitterness at the end but otherwise a weak addition to Founders' awesome line up, I'll stick with the Centennial."
"Honey color with feeble head. A very pleasant dry hop, biscuit, slight spice aroma proceeds from the drink. Tastes is straightforward and impressive: slight citrus skin, biscuits with a touch of honey, hop dryness at the end but more toward the sweet rather than bitter side. A light carbonation throughout the amiable drink along with a light,fresh crisp mouthfeel. Highly drinkable session that is very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: None what so ever, although I did use it in a soup I made today instead of white wine and that came out ok, so I guess it does have some redeeming qualities after all, drinking is just not one of them."
"this is almost a perfect APA ... the pour is a beautiful straw/golden color with outstanding lacing ..perfect.. the smell is is of hops straw and pine up front but not much malt... the taste starts out with hop aroma some pine and spice a tiny bit of sweetness and a to strong bitter/flat finish ...malt would help here... mouthfeel is good drinkability is above average 35 ibu and 5.2 abv. another solid brew from founders but not my favorite a little more malt to smooth things out at the end and this would be a solid A.. still a good brew! try it!"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer to drink a lot of when you're looking to pound down something mild but hoppy."
"Thanks again Karl. Founders #2 later this weekend."
"decently smooth, only a touch of wateriness. light resins in the finish. moderate carbonation."
"This beer pours a hazy copper hue. One finger off white head with decent retention, wispy lacing throughout. Nose is of citrusy hops, pine spices and slight malts. Taste is a bit hoppier than most pale ales that I have had. Citrus and pine are the most dominant flavoring. Crisp feel but an extremely dry finish. I enjoy dry beers, but the dryness was too much and took away from the taste. Overall, it's well balanced, but the dryness detracts from just how good this beer could be."
"Notes: definitely a great pale. it has a lot of flavor and hopiness, so its not a pale you want if you are looking to branch out from lagers."
"Worth trying, and good for the style, but not worth moving mountains for."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing. I had this with some chicken encheladas which was a great match. Very enjoyable."
"Overall the beer looks, smells and feels like a decent APA but I was let down a little bit in the flavor department. While the hops were at an appropriate level for an APA, the flavors seemed a bit subdued plus the slight sourness turned me off a bit. I'd consider this to be an average to slightly above average APA."
"Overall a pretty good beer - look and feel is spot on, nice aroma, but the big aspirin presence could use some work."
"A good APA, the best one that I have tried so far. Good hoppy notes and a nice combination of appearance and smell."
"Mouthfeel is spot on. Sudsy, chewy, slick, carbonated, oily- just lovely, couldn't ask for more. Overall this is a tasty, highly enjoyable beverage. I would pick this up- often- if it would just come to Florida! Til then, I'll be begging my NJ friends to send me care packages."
"D: Once the head dies a bit and you can drink it, its pretty tasty for the style."
"Overall, an OK beer from a great brewery. Grab something else from them unless you are just trying to expand what you've had from them. One and done for me."
"Not a ton of flavor, but still very full in the mouth and quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: This to me tasted like an average pale ale...This is very representative of the style, but I do not think it excels...I will not be buying this again."
"Not a bad Pale Ale at all. It was a bit too heavy of the ruby red grapefruit. That's fine and dandy, but only if there were more flavors backing it up. If it would have increased the citrus hops, I probably would have liked this beer more. I could possibly see this as a session Pale Ale. Not for me though. Too much grapefruit and not enough of anything else. Since it's brewed by Founders, it's worth a shot."
""""I smell chocolate... it's the very first thing I smell.""""
"Pours a hazed orange with a small bone colored head that is both thin and in hurry to retreat leaving very little remnants of its short life. The nose reminds me of graham crackers and citrus,more citrus than anything else. This tastes dirty to me and I kind of like it. A good balance of malt and hops as it should be. Founders PA leans heavily on the malt in this offering, some citrus hop shines through, just not quite enough for me to put this up there with my favorites. This has a solid quality taste none the less. The body was the biggest let down for me. Thin and not nearly as creamy as I would hope for, losing almost all its carbonation after a couple swirls of my snifter. I may be being a little bit too critical, I just expected something a little more on the edgier side of the style."
"I was somewhat disappointed in this ale from Founders. I find most of the ales they produce to be outstanding. I will skip this one next time and grab a Red's Rye or a Centennial IPA. This is one of the best Midwest brewers that I have tried and wish them success. Have you tried their Backwoods Bastard Ale?..."
"So kids - when you let this one sit, it turns into a nice light lager with some sweet flavoring. Not what Founders is intending for - but turns to be a decent tasting brew."
"D - Hard to say. Undeniably a well-made beer, but for some reason it's not really wowing me."
"Drinkability: A solid beer, though definitely one of the less impressive Founders I've had so far. This one's just a little too overcarbonated and a little too tart (I like the leafyness to come through in my dry hopped beers). That being said, it's still a very drinkable, low abv% beer, highly sessionable and recommended."
"D: very easy drinking."
"West Michigan Beer is awesome."
"Note: Evidently, this bottle was over-carbonated. I'll revisit this beer in 2009."
"D - An average pale even w/ dry hopping. It seems light bodied/thin and just doesn't justify repeated tastes(for my palate). The most dissapointing ale I have had from Founders, but still completely drinkable."
"(3.7/5)"
"Orange amber color with a thick off white head. Aroma is pine and citrus with an underlying malty sweetness. The mouthfeel is smoother and creamier than I would have expected. A little hoppy dryness up front ,and some sweet fruit notes. The flavor is extremely well balanced. Grapefruit and pine leads to some caramel sweetness. Fairly dry finish with little aftertaste. A nice pale ale, I could drink this every day."
"D: Delicious, a little bitter, but not overpowering...just enough to remind you what your tastebuds think of bitter."
"Nice thick head. Golden brown in color. Good hoppy, citrusy smell. The lacing on this brew was a sight to behold you could still see the first mark after the pint was gone. The malty carmel flavor was good but could of been more hoppy for my taste. A full bodied beer for sure with a smooth finish. Could drink many of these in a sitting."
"The taste could use another dose of hops, in my opinion. Maybe I'm just a hop-head, but it seems like the hops used for the secondary dry-hop should have been thrown into the boil at some point. A touch of pine and bitter resins greets the back of the palate, but for the most part this beer tastes like (slightly stale) crystal malt. Mouthfeel is a step in the right direction, with a light body that's well-carbonated, giving it a crisp, clean finish that allows the bitterness to linger for just long enough. I can't say that I'd ever buy this beer again--there are just too many better choices out there--but if it were a hot summer day and all I had were Founder's Pale Ale, I wouldn't turn it down."
"Pours a orange/copper color, with almost no head and just a tiny bit of lacing. Great smell, absolutely great, a full nose of American hops with a great floral and citrus kick to it. Good taste, but it doesn't match up with the scent; good hops, nice floral and citrus American style, but has a slightly watered down taste. Goes down fine, with just a bit of roughness, nothing horrible, though. Worth it for the scent alone."
"D - Easily drinkable if you're into a more bitter brew."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with foamy white head. Aroma is very hoppy with a nice malt backbone. Flavor very similar to aroma; pretty malty for a pale ale with a lot of floral hops."
"Overall a delicious brew, with the dry-hopping providing such a wonderful aroma, and the dry, bitter finish encouraging another quaff."
"D: This only gets better as it warms in your glass. I drank my first one quick, but I let the second sit around a bit and just sipped on her. The flavor really gets going when you let it warm a bit. Great BREW!"
"I enjoyed this beer."
"On an aside, not a beer I would continue to pay a premium price for."
"D: Low ABV, tasty, and easy drinking."
"d: A pretty god pale ale, but nothing outstanding."
"Overall - Very good pale ale. I'm assuming that the zesty flavor and mouthfeel are a result of the dry hopping process that is used to make this ale."
"overall, i'm glad i got to try this beer, but wouldn't really seek it out beyond the first experience. not a bad beer, but there are so many i haven't tried out there. this is a refreshing non offensive summer beer that goes down like water."
"D: This is a refreshing beer. Something to grab when you want a cold one to work outside."
"Here's a quintessential hoppy pale ale done in the American tradition. Great body and well-carbonated, a generous dollop of hops with a solid malt base. A dry flavor, but not lip puckering. Longlasting hop bitterness after the swallow. Would be a great regular APA to have when friends come by--no errors, good flavor."
"Definitely drinkable and sessionable...crisp and clean, no caffeine...maybe not as heavy of a flavor profile as desired but it's a quencher."
"D: A refreshing and hoppy beer. Overall a smooth finish with no asstringency."
"This is an exceptional pale ale. There's not too much to say about it other than clean, balanced, refreshing, lightly hoppy... If you want a good hoppy beer that you could still drink a ton of... this is the one. Rides that line very well (better than Dales) at not being an IPA, but still being assertive. Highly recommended. Cheers!"
"D- Here is where things get tricky for me. While it is lacking in complexity, somewhat in taste, it has a good drinkability factor added to it BECAUSE of that. Chugging this tailgating or grilling would be way too easy. I see where you could get bitten, too, with it being 6.2% ABV. It is well hidden and quite a bit stronger than the standard BMC most folks tailgate with."
"Bottle poured into pint glass - light head - not very tight - disipates - I see sediment. Smells like a crate of grapefruit - the crate and the fruit. Big malt up front citrus hop finish - not huge though kind of watery finish. Mouthfeel watery thin. Drinkability - decent due to the lightness - might keep the interest beyond one but not two but I generally don't like hoppy for session beer."
"M/D: Nice mouthfeel, smooth, light to medium bodied, almost a creamy feel, a bit of oiliness as well. Drinkability is good as well. Overall, there is nothing wrong with the beer but I was expecting more."
"D - An OK beer, but nothing exemplary. Perhaps worth a try, but not an APA that I'd seek out."
"Nicely medium-bodied with fine carbonation and excellent drinkability."
"Pretty much golden in color with a nice creamy white head that falls fairly slow, leaving some patches of lacing down the glass. Smell doesn't have a whole lot to it. A touch of grain or biscuity bread. Light sweetness of citrus fruit and maybe a bit of caramel. Nice flavor with a good balance of hops and malts. While it's not too deep or complex, I like the balance and the hop profile. Cascades with a resiny feel to them. Grapefruit citrus, a little peppery spice, balanced well by a light caramel sweetness. Very nice mouthfeel that is smooth and has solid carbonation. A nice crisp finish and light dryness. A good and hoppy Pale Ale with a nice hop character. My kind of brew. It doesn't seem to interesting at first but it gets surprising after that. Founders is yet another brewery I'm thankful to have now in NC...they just keep coming."
"D: Because price is on the steep side, and there isn't too much impressive going on in the beer, i wouldnt buy this again, but I'd definitely drink it if given to me. I'd definitely go for a Sierra over this one."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, though it's atypical for a pale ale. Nonetheless, it's quite tasty and well made."
"A delicious beer but not a particularly noteworthy one. I'd probably choose a Smuttynose Shoals Pale over this."
"Overall: A good beer no doubt and great for the style. For 11 bucks a 6 pack tho... I would rather go with the cheaper and in my opinion better sierra nevada pale ale."
"Good beer from a fantastic trade.. thanks Jon."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Too easy... in the best way possible. The light, borderline-watery entrance foams up just right, creating an airy slickness in texture. With this much balance and flavor, this drinks great by itself but would shine further with pizza."
"I really wanted to like this beer. And I do, but it just leaves you wanting more. Alittle more longevity of the taste would go a long way."
"These are perfect for a nice warm day. Sessionable if not for that abv north of 5%."
"A classic style APA, the kind that gets overlooked in DIPA/IIPA/Need more and more hops frenzy of todays craft beer world. It won't rock your world, but makes a solid everyday craft brew."
"Bottom line: A decent APA that looks good, smells good, tastes ok, has a pretty good mouthfeel, and is pretty drinkable. There you have it in a nutshell. ;^)"
"An amber to light orange color, with an off white colored one inch head on top. A malty scent at the start, that is soon followed by a grassy and light citrusy aroma at the end. The atste is malty at the front, then the hops begin to come foward with grassy, earth, and grapefruit citrus flavors. The hop bitterness seems to fade very quickly, and it tastes as the malt is reasserting itself. A light to medium bodied feel, finishing light and dry on the palate. It is an easy to drink beer, with very good feel and good aroma. But, the taste was very lackluster and brings this beer down."
"D- I could go through a 6 pack without much trouble I think."
"Pours a hazed golden with a small filmy off white head. Aroma is medium sweet with orange, light citrus biscuit malt. Flavor is orange, grapefruit and light caramel. Light astringency. Light to medium body, crisp texture. The astringency really detracts from the overall score of this beer."
"D: Decent drinkability making for a good session. enjoyed it."
"Body super carbonated at first, but slick and creamy once settled a bit. Obviously something wrong w/ this bottle as per the excessive carbonation. But it tastes fresh and very tastey."
"Felt a bit thin, as I expected from the pour, but again not bad. Went down easy. I certainly wouldn't mind having some more."
"Same taste. Malts & hops are in evidence, & for the first time I taste some biscuit, but very gentle. Easy to drink. Good summer beer, not terribly complex, goes down just fine."
"easy to drink, finishes crisp and clean."
"This is a decent simple beer that I could make a session out of during the summer."
"D - This was a great dry-hopped pale ale. This was a bit bitter for me at first, but as it warmed it became quite tasty."
"Overall- Sweet and mild make this enjoyable and easy to drink a few before going out."
"Living in Grand Rapids, I get the luxury of getting this stuff right from the source (Along with all of their great brews). This is a very strong scented pale ale and is quite tasty, however I'm in a mix as to my favorite pale ale between this one and that of Magic Hat's #9. Anyhow if you see a bottle of this around it is sure to not disappoint, especially on a hot summer day! If your ever in Grand Rapids, Founder's brewery is a must on the trip!"
"I wouldn't call this beer an Extra Pale Ale but it tilts toward the more moderate or lighter end of the Pale Ale spectrum."
"Carbonation was good and definately one that could be drubk again. I was okay with this one and would be okay with it again although I want to try others more."
"D - Pretty drinkable brew. Expecting more of an in your face taste. If I want a pale with a flavor this laid back I'm probably looking for a more sessionable brew than a 6.2% beer. Still it is easy to drink, just watch that ABV sneaking up."
"M&D- fits well in the mouth, and goes down easy. Though not a beer with any particurly special qualities, every part is done well and is worth a purchase if you like the APA style."
"Not a guzzler of a pale ale, as its flavors ask you to take your time and enjoy it, with more depth than many in this style. Looking at the Founders logo makes me brace for an alestorm wallop of some kind, and this is clearly not meant for such things. As is, it's quite good, nothing major to complain about, just don't go looking for transcendence."
"Possibly, this was a bit old, hop nose (dry hopped!) was not noticable, so age maybe declined it)."
"This is a very nice APA - quite hoppy, but with balance. LIke I mentioned - more like a somewhat restrained IPA."
"Pours a light golden in color. A nice inch deep head forms on the pour. Smell is subtle hops. Taste is hoppy and clean. Decent amount of hops for being only a pale ale. Very refreshing, smooth beer. Very good beer that is way too easy to drink. Doesn't get old, and is perfect for a day at the lake."
"Far from bad, far from great."
"Pours bright, hazy yellowish orange with a fluffy white head that lingers for a while leaving some delicate lacing. Aroma is light hops with citrus - lemons, floral and grassy. Taste is bitter floral hops up front which gives way to a subtle bready malt backbone. The bitterness comes back in the finish and hangs around in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and creamy with a dry, bitter feel at the end. This one is a tad bitter but still drinkable and a nice summer brew."
"Decent balance. I was able to drink a fair amount of this and I would again."
"M/D- Medium/light body, the perfect amount of carbonation. Very drinkable, another excellent session beer choice from Founders. Thanks for coming into NJ!!"
"Recommended..."
"good carbonation. mid body. good beer. would love to have this on tap. cool bottle- love the flowers in her hair."
"A very easy, if unspectacular american pale ale. Since there is no freshness date, I can not determine if the hops have simply diminished in flavor. I suspect this one is at its best very fresh or on tap. It is very easy to drink several of these despite the 6.2 % ABV."
"This is the first BIG clunker I've had from Founder's :-("
"This is pretty easily drinkable, but I expected a little more character from a Founder's beer, especially one that's labeled as a """dry-hopped pale ale.""""
"Final Thought: Not up to par like some of their others, but this is a nice base for a beer to work from. Very good for its style."
"M/D - Smooth and easy drinking. Doesnt fry the tastebuds and just a well balanced beer. Proper amount of carbonation."
"I bought this bottle as a 12 oz single from Woodman's in Oak creek."
"T: Like the smell, strong biscuity malt backbone and a very dry, clean hopped taste. Creamy, fuller body with a lot of carbonation. This beer is what it is for a pale ale. Nothing spectacular, but very drinkable."
"The beer is golden amber with appropriate carbonation and head. I was surprised at all the flavor in this beer for being called a pale ale. I thought it would be much more bland and constrained. Unortodox and tasty style that makes most pale ales essentially pale in comparison."
"Decent, except for that weird aftertaste/smell I can't identify."
"The citrusy hops are right up front in the flavor but aren't screamingly dominate due to them being dry hopped. Very good (and dry) taste none the less on first sip especially with the good balance of malt, a orange like tinge and some bitters nuances that show up in the mouth. A clean and refreshing feeling all around in the mouth and the hop flavor lingers a bit in the back in the throat but not as crazy as some of the other superhopped and over 5 % abv (this is clocking in at around 6.2). A very good and quite drinkable beer here."
"My runneth over with foamy white head, beneath which a pale orange blond brew awaits. Once it subdues I am able to make out the nice hoppiness of pink grapefruit and citrus rind. Toasted grains mix in with some pleasant grassy, earthy, spice. The light medium body is almost overun with tons of fizzy and sharp carbonation (It may be a little bad, but I kind of liked it all the same). Tart and citrusy with some rind bitterness carry lightly to the finish. Toasted golden grains wave as earthy spice finishes fairly dry. Pretty damn strong on the hops front for an APA, but very good. One of the best."
"Orange amber sedimenty laden hazy pour with about the biggest meringue like head ever.. Ridiculously carbonated and a HUGE psssstttt sound when popping the cap. Also underfilled bottle. Very strange. That aside it had an earthy, grassy hop aroma and flavor, along with a very light sweetness. Big hop flavor, mild bitterness, kind of over carbonated and felt like champagne in the mouth towards the end of the glass. Flavor needs a bit more body, sweetness, but still a good pale overall."
"D&W (a local grocery store) used to make an awesome beer brat using Founder's Pale Ale."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, some caramel malt or something would help to give this some body and balance. I could drink more than one of these in a night and it certainly wouldn't be a chore, but this really could be more balanced."
"D: I am a fan of the well hopped american pale ale. And this definitely fits the bill. The alcohol is a bit higher than I like out of an APA to truly make this a session beer, but a pleasant lightly hopped (with respect to my normal appetite of american IPA's and IIPa's)beer that I wouldn't mind having again. Definitely not my favorite APA, but would suit me well if I am every lucky enough to have this available to me."
"D: for the style, its a little bitter for me... but still crisp refreshing enough to be close to the 'session' IPA i'm accustomed to"
"D: Pretty decent, very hoppy and a bit dry a nice beer but really not what I was hoping for."
"A good pale ale, I like the dry-hopping. It adds an extra crisp hop bite, which is still gentle and in line with the style. Unfortunately, this didn't come off as the most complex ale. There's just a good balance of caramel malt (few distinguishable flavors) with citrus hops. Basically there's a some malt, some hops, and it feels good."
"Overall Impression: An enjoyable beer, but you have to like the hops to get this one."
"Pours a nice foggy gold with a minimal crème head. Nose is mild with a slight citrus tone. Not much to it really. Flavor is bitter hops with a leafy, earthy edge. Feel is a bit thicker on the liquid and the carbonation is decent. Overall a fairly good one here. A bit bitter and lacking a smooth even profile, but nice enough to try."
"This bottle opened with a crack reminiscent of a steroid-fueled home run hit. The first pour into a shaker glass yielded a quarter inch of liquid and head up the rim. I thought it was a bad bottle, but WTH, let it calm down, and by the time I finally get the rest of the bottle into the glass it ought to be at primo tasting temperature, a cloudy light orange with a not-quite-white head, and few dregs on the bottom. Once it was all in the glass, the nice left-coast hop flavors with pine and citrus aromas rose over the malt. The flavor was nicely balanced between the malt and hops, and was satisfying without being quickly sating. All in all not a bad beer despite my misgivings at the pour."
"D  Given the great balance of taste and body, I think this is a very drinkable beer. Very refreshing and inviting all the way from its cool serving temperature to a warmer room temp."
"D: Very drinkable and quite refreshing. Would be great in the summer when the beer store is out of their Centennial IPA (perish the thought!)."
"This is the first Founders beer I've had that doesn't boast an assertive, pretentious character. It's one of a pack of fine APA's, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It may not stand out, but from the glass to the belly, it comes across as good, fundamental, and an easy quaff. There would be no issue if I were offered this again. I'll drink it gladly."
"Full bodied and creamy but with a nice refreshing finish. An excellent warm weather beer that remains satisfying. Nicely done and very well balanced. Another good selection from one of my favorite breweries."
"Drinkability: Another solid offering from Founders! Can't go wrong with that fine brewery. Session this one all day long!"
"Not bad overall but there are plenty of better PA out there. A little disppointed. Maybe my least favorite Founders beer; or maybe I am growing tired of the same old same old in most Pale Ales."
"Tasty, good summer beer. Decent balance with plenty of hop flavor."
"Extremely drinkable. The beer could've used more malt presence but at the same time I appreciate it's unique taste. Would be a great choice to consume during dinner and as a session beer. I adore their Centennial IPA and really like their spin on an APA with this offering."
"Poured into pint glass and very little head, seemed unusual when compared to other reviews. Nice, clear, light orange color. Smell seems a little off. Some hops but mainly a bread like smell with some sourness, but it seems like something just doesnt belong. Taste is very good, finally something impressed me. Great balance of malt and hops, more malt profile than I excpected. Nice hoppy taste is left behind and present with each sip. Very crisp, light mouthfeel with a somewhat bitter and dry aftertaste. Put down two of these very easily. While I was thrown by the smell, the taste makes up for it."
"This Founders brew pours to a half inch of liquid, and a 4 inch fizzy head. Dumped that pour and tried a different glass, same thing. Very annoying. Took me 6 minutes to empty the bottle. Smell is a medicinal hop aroma, seems artificial. Taste is again the artificial mediciney hop flavor. Not much else can be discerned. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. I barely finished this brew, I have no idea what happened here, and I hope this was an old lot."
"Overall: I'm not a huge APA fan, but for the style this gets decent across the board marks. The hoppy aspect of this beer is different, and the overall package is solid."
"D- It still is alright even with all the flaws in my bottle. I would like to try a fresh bottle. If I find another bottle I will re-review it."
"Appears a pale copper hue slightly hazed much akin to a Two Hearted with fluffy slightly off white eggshell hued head, dimples nicely sticks to my HopDevil pint with no excuses looks beautiful but we've heard to watch out for those. Aroma contains piney and citrus layers of freshly opened hop packs before adding to your homebrew these are pelletized bastardized at their best blended with a touch of skunk, citrus peel, herb, and pine but a bit heavy on the pine sol component with light biscuit malt sweetness arising around the edges. Flavor....mouth full of pine cone and citrus peel great stuff dry hopped with alpha acids in mind great oily texture flowing mild tame biscuit creamy sweetness excellent pale ale, actually just as magnificent as the label. Refreshing as all hell with hop oils floating thank god for Founders, yes I did capitalize one of those sorry G man. Mouthfeel is resinous medium bodied evenly carbonated the kind of lusciousness that goes a long way, at least until the bottom of this glass. Great stuff watch out, of course it's drinkable give me a mini keg so I can die in peace."
"Overall- Good beer. It had a full flavor, was quite balanced, and was an easy drinker. It lacks that something extra to set itself apart from other pale ales, but is worth a try and will stay in my regular rotation."
"M/D - Smooth and full of flavor. Better than the average Pale Ale with a great hop presence from the dry-hopping. I'd love to try this on draft."
"Lightly hazed, mandarin copper body with lighter edges and a thick, whipped, meringue-like head of creamy white. Good lacing. Grapefruit, mild pineapple, powdered sugar, and orange zest on the nose. Hoppy, lightly acidic citrus notes up front. Toasted biscuit malt comes in, but the citrusy hop bitterness still dominates. Mildly sweet fruits before a pine and citrus hop bitter finish. Drying. Moderate body with a spritzy, bottle-conditioned feel. Not bad at all. Not Founder's strongest beer, but a good one nonetheless."
"This pale ale is very drinkable. Sure, it's super dry, but it's also got a nice light body to it. The modest ABV and the hops make it great for all occasions, in my opinion. I'd rather kick back with a Centennial IPA from Founders instead, but this is a quality brew (and completely different than the IPA) and makes a nice evening session beer."
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a pale malt scent along with nice floral hop aroma. It's light and refreshing. The taste is good. It has a very light pale malt flavor, although it reaches 6.2% abv.. It also has a kick ass hop flavor that quite floral and bitter. This is an easy drinker; very light, yet flavorful and full of hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I love the hop presence; very well done."
"Got this one because I've been so impressed with the other Founders I've had. This one was a very prototypical APA - even with the somewhat higher ABV, the flavors were quite mild. Lots of citrusy fruit, and a solid hop character. A fairly drinkable beer, for what it was, but I'm always more inclined to have the Centennial IPA. Doesn't quite reach the levels of really good APAs like the Stone or Alpha King, but not bad, for what it was."
"Overall: I might grab another BUT if I saw a Stone PA I would certainly choose that over this Founders. With that said, its worth a try."
"Pours a slightly hazy light amber color with a full finger off white head that's wispy and fades quickly to spotty lacing. The smell has a timid floral character. Light bodied, the mouth feel is is adequately carbonated, refreshing, yet singular. The flavor is fresh and light also. A nice drinker."
"Amber,cloudy body with almost no head.Some nice lacing.Smells like """Spray Starch""". Very floral hop aroma.Creamy mouthful,taste's like it smells.Floral hops.Some bittering,nice mouthful.I like it but that spray starch taste bugs me.Ive tasted it before in another companeys beer.Still a well crafted beer though and worth seeking out."
"Vety nice beer, refreshing and tasty."
"Highly recommended."
"Nice little beer. Clear gold color. Decent head that leaves average lacing. Nice hop smell. In fact quite a bid of hop aroma. Very nice balance of flavors. The hop bitterness is only slightly stronger that the malt tones. Finishes slightly dry but not harsh. I would say this beer is very drinkable. I did not even notice the slightly high alcohol content of 6.2%. I have only had two of the offerings from the Founders brewery but have enjoyed both of them thoroughly."
"Drinkability: Great. This is a serious summer quencher. I could easily drink a bunch of this stuff. Definitely worth seeking out again. Cheers!"
"The drinkability is good on this one. Very refreshing beer."
"Light-Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Incredibly easy drinking. At 6.2% this could probably be a little thicker, but damn, it is really smooth as it is."
"Taste is light malty and hoppy with mild grapefruit characteristics. The bitterness is a little sharp. Body is very light and should be a bit higher. I miss the caramellic notes normally present in an APA. Not the most flavourfull APA I had. I had higher expectations of this beer, especially because of the dryhopping."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, very well carbonated, and I really think the abv is great. A bit high for an American Pale Ale, but it works. I could session this beer. Overall, a very nice offering from Founders."
"Nice dark golden color. Head is full of bubbles and looks like a sink full of dish washing soap. Rings of soap trail the glass. Smell of citrus and a little bit spicey. Taste is grapefruit hops up front. The malt kicks in and balances things nicely which is followed by a dry bitter finish. A little bit of a nutty flavor. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side but probably appropriate for an APA. Overall another winner from Founders. I love their beers and I'm thrilled that they are available in PA now. I'm going to try everyone that i can get my hands on."
"D: For an APA, the abv is pretty high. I could drink another bottle or two though, the hop body is spicy and enjoyable."
"Drinkability is high, i'll probably down a few of these over some barbeque this evening."
"Pours a crystal clear beautiful light amber color, nice soapy head forms with good tracing. A very citrusy, fruity aroma comes out with some first notes of apricot followed by a nice nutty malty aroma. It's overall, a very toasty feel, akin to Fat Tire. Flavor is quite weak. I get this generic hop feel with no structure; a bit of bitterness, and no nice crystaly malt finish. I feel like this sample is probably very old because this, in no way, tastes dry-hopped. It reminds a bit of SNPA with a little more body, but it's rather boring and I'm a bit dissapointed considering where it came from."
"the brewery website says 5.2%"
"Poured a cloudy, amber with a huge head. Lacing is thick and clumpy while carbonation appears moderately vigorous. Smell is somewhat hoppy and spicy, but muted. This is likely due to the fact that this was the last of a six pack that I purchased in December. Hop aroma is bolder when this beer is fresh. Flavor is hoppy with moderate bitterness. Very good for an APA. Mouthfeel is also very good; smooth, crisp and dry finish. Overall, this is a very good APA."
"A real woody brew, I guess thats the dry hopping. Small pops of citrus in there, but this is generally lifeless. Glad I only had one bottle, Ill pass on getting a sixer of this."
"Pours a copper color from 12oz bottle to pint glass. Little head and practicaly no lacing. Smell is mild pine hops with a very mild carmel malt behind it. Taste is primarily piney hops with a touch of grapefruit and very mild sweetness from the malts. Very dry, bitter finish. More bitter than most APAs. Light mouthfeel. A little too much unbalanced bitters for me. Drinkability suffers from the bitterness. Good, not great APA. Great value at $1.25."
"D- A good pale ale and it went down pretty quick. It would make a good session beer."
"Good Lord! Audible pffft as I pop the top, and a massive head formed the minute I poured it into the glass. It went into a Duvel tulip, and seriously took me 5 minutes to pour the damn thing. Looking through other reviews, seems some people have this problem and some don't - a bad batch or quality control issues? Big off-white head, forming huge bubbles as it falls. Aroma: they weren't kidding about the dry-hopping. This is 6 months old, what was it like fresh? Great example of Cascade hops. Unfortunately, seems kinda like a one note chord. It's nice, would be very drinkable outside in the summer, but not too much going on in it. Worth trying, though, especially if the head is under control."
"Cheers!"
"This beer pours with a big, fluffy, white head that leaves lots of lacing as it falls. The color is a not quite clear orangish-amber with a steady stream of carbonation. It smells strongly of grapefruit and not much else to my nose. The taste is grapefruit without any strong bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin with some carbonation and smooth going down. Easy to drink. A solid Pale Ale that doesn't stand out for any reason but you're unlikely to be disappointed either."
"Slightly hazy (but mostly clear) orange/yellow brew with a big 'ol white fluffy head and a couple little swimmers. Head fades after a bit. Nose is floral hops, and lots of 'em. Slight rose scent. Taste is a footrace between hops and malts all the way through, with bitter hops pulling into the lead in the last few meters. Hints of pine. Alcohol is well hidden. Nice mouthfeel, and drinkability is up there. Solid beer choice."
"I love a good IPA. This one is very nice and I'll definitely be having one again."
"Poured into a pint glass. Had a little bit of a head, but I pour really slowly. Amber color with lots of bubbles. Mouthfeel is tingly with a bitterness at the end. Citrusy and a little sour I'm a new beer reviewer so I know I'm missing some of the finer points. I didn't catch any of the """horse blanket""" or pine smells. Doesn't mean they are not there, it's just that my palate isn't sophisticated enough yet. A very good pale ale. I like almost everything Founders makes."
"D: Quite drinkable, but not exciting enough to return to over & over again. Decent though."
"Not a bad drinking beer, and I would have rated a little higher had it not been for the pain of pouring and waiting for the foam to subside."
"Nothing at all wrong with this ale except that it has no particular thing that is does that stands out from the crowd. Nice ale but I think my local Pale Ale is better."
"12oz. bottle poured in to my glass a clear golden color with slow bubbles and a large spongy white head with good retention that left spots of lace around the glass. Smell had a fresh floral scent. Taste is one hopped up pale ale with a slight hint of malt in the beginning that turns to big floral hop flavors with a somewhat mild bitterness. The feel is medium bodied with a bit of stickiness and a tingle of carbonation. This is a very easy, flavorful brew to drink and there is nothing pale about this ale."
"Overall, a very unique take on a pale ale. The dry hopping adds a great layer of complexity to this classic style. It does feel a bit awkward though. It's probably a great lawn mowing beer because it smells like freshly mowed grass, high quality grass though."
"Overall a really good IPA and I would expect it would taste even better in the hot summer months"
"A nice IPA alternative for hop heads, but little here for devotees of malt. But what did you expect from something with dry hopped in its name. Seems a tad overboard on the hops for me, and totally unbalanced, but then I like things on the maltier side."
"D - Nearly perfect. I could pretty much drink these all the time. This may become a 'fridge favorite."
"Thinner medium body with average carbonation. A bit dry, yet slick. Very easy drinker. Downing a six pack would be no problem, but it's not flavorful enough for me to want to do that. I probably will not buy this one again."
"Drinkability: Inoffensively light and crisp, though what you gain in sessionability, you lose in depth of character."
"Decent drinkablility. Decent APA. Not my favorite, not bad either, wouldn't go out of my way to get one, and at the same time I wouldn't turn one down."
"drinkable?: better be, its a damn pale ale, and yes .. it is. a small hint of acidic finish prevents me from putting up a 4.5"
"Drinkability - with its hop domination, this could be an AIPA, it's one for the hopheads. More importantly though, it's very good and it's very sessionable."
"Poured a golden amber with a little over two inches of cream colored foam. Sweet smelling with notes of orange and lemon. The taste is lighter on the citrus than the smell. More of a flowery quality. This beer was highly carbonated. I would have another, but not my favorite offering from Founders. They could do better and should."
"Medium bodied, this is a very well done front hopped pale ale. Great hop flavors, with only the subtlest bitterness."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is golden with a very slight amber tinge. Huge frothy head, four fingers with incredibly bubbly lacing. Smell is of the cascade hops, slightly citrusy - orange, lemon maybe even a little grapefruit, nice. Taste is not nearly as enjoyable, with an initial taste of the citrus smell followed by a corny malt taste and a finish that leaves an undesirable taste. The mouthfeel is pretty light with creamy carbonation. Overall I would have to say that this beer is drinkable, but not impressive. I was expecting more from Founders!"
"Drinkability: Poor, but not a sink-pour. I really hope this was a bad batch. It's hard to believe this is a dry hopped beer, since it has no hop aroma. From this sample it seems as if they tranferred the beer early to the bottling line--neither dry hopping it nor allowing it to ferment out completely before bottling. I'm going to come back to this beer in a couple months to see whether it was indeed a fluke, since Founders Red 's Rye and Founders Centennial are so nice."
"Overall a nice beer... nothing I'm in love with, but quite nice."
"Significant white head on grapefruit copper. One dimension understated IPA based on cascade hops, malted. A good though drying taste from all the malt. Stickly.Because of my upbringing, whenever I start a pale I think British.I agree its a lawnmower beer."
"M: Fizzy, sweet, and bitter. Easy to drink. These could sneal up on me after a couple. More than two would be a waste of hops on a shattered pallete."
"The body is light and easy to drink with a crisp finish. A better then average APA and borderline IPA (which cant be bad). A nice citrus zing with a peppery finish. But what is in a name?"
"I was just in Founders this afternoon and I really love that place. I had this beer on tap and it poured a light golden with a two fingered head. The smell and taste was very hoppy, maybe a bit too much so. It did not have the grassy hop flavor I was expecting, with very little fruity esters to it. Overall, a nice brew, but I would go for a different Founders product in the future."
"An okay APA. I usually expect a little better from Founders, but this surely isn't horrible."
"Slainte!"
"the drinkability is great, quite satisfying, a must try in this style. Prosit MK"
"After the pour, I see a orange-brown beer with a small but subtstantial, stagnant head. Lots of floaties. It smells dry and hoppy, nicely floral. Nothing sweet about it. The taste is similar, with citrus and pine notes, and a lingering hoppy aftertaste. It's quite satisfying, feeling fresh and crisp. Nicely carbonated and easy to drink."
"Man, do I love this brewery! This pale ale pours yellow/orange with a big, fluffy head. The beer's floral nose is enticing. Upon tasting, I am reminded that this brewery hasn't disappointed me yet. The taste is quite complex. Big, bready malts are mixed well with a huge dry-hopped bitterness. I love the way they purposefully made this a pale ale, rather than an IPA, with such a big hop presence. Good job, guys."
"D: Fairly one dimensional but a hop lovers delight."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a white head that disipates rapidly. The nose is loaded of cascade hops giving it a grapefruit aroma. The front taste is largely of grapefruit though not very overwhelmind with a balance of slight maltiness coming up in the mid with a dry hoppy finish. Light crisp body with carbonation present present on the tounge. With the grapefruit aroma and taste it's a nice breakfast beer."
"I have never seen a beer other than Rodenbach with an explosive head such as this. I poured maybe two onces into the glass and it overflowed the top of my pint. Explosive is the only word to describe it. A aggressive pour would likely be all head. The smell is faint but hoppy. The taste is more subdued hops. And if you use your imagination just a hair, it kindly tastes like Mountain Dew. The mouthfeel is wild too. I have been pouring it from the bottle into my mouth and letting it foam up. I know, lame. But it is getting late and all. The drinkability is good. A fine pale ale. Too bad it is not sold here in NC."
"I'm still a little wary, but this beer is not too bad even if a little old. Certainly good enough to try again."
"I had some more tonight (12 Mai 2008) and this time, it produced a huge, foamy, off-tan/khaki colored head that looked like the top of an ice cream float. My original review is still pretty solid, although I would add the extreme grapefruit/citrus flavor both in the mouth and on the finish. It's hard to believe that this is an APA and not an IPA. I've had IPAs from some places that were not even this hoppy. Well done!"
"Overall a drinkable, but one dimentional APA. Founders Centennial APA is an amazing treat. This brew on the other hand isn't bad, but lacks enough depth of character to be great."
"A tasty easy to drink session pale. Will definity be drinking more of these."
"Poured a fairly cloudy coppery peach color with some floating sediment present, huge billowing off white two finger foamy head slowly fell away to moderate white lacing. Smell is citrusy hops paired with some piny citrus aromas as well, slightly sweet and caramelly malts finish out the clean, crisp nose. Taste is hoppy and fruity, mainly grapefruit, sweet maltiness rounds out the cascade hops and brings a stable balance to this beer. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation, for an overall light and smooth beer. Slightly hop-bittered dryness in the aftertaste. Very drinkable beer with an enjoyable balance about it, hops hit right where they should and the malt steps in right at the expected moment. Would recommend to anyone looking for a well-hopped up APA that doesn't disappoint."
"single bottle purchased at Woodman's and smuggled back from my WI trip...appears to have been bottled in either May or June."
"D- This beer has good hop flavor with some interesting flavors. It would be nice if the malt came through a bit more in to balance the hop bitterness."
"Light amber color with a soft white head leaving good lacing. Smell of pine needles and some citrus. Pine and citrus flavors as well with a little bit of malt showing up in the finish. Low carbonation, light bodied. Pretty easy to drink, could easily make an evening out of this one."
"Overall very nice, but not enough bitter hops for my taste, this could be a first or second IPA for someone to try."
"Overall this is a decent offering. It is more balanced than most other pale ales or IPAs I drink. Nothing spectacular but definitely tasty. This might be a good hidden crossover brew."
"Excellent hop nose that translated into a great light hop taste that was not overpowering in the least. The dry hopping hit the nail on the head with its intent. Very smooth and refreshing. Slight sweetness of malt that cleans up without getting in the way of the hop flavor. Reminds me much more of a PNW pale than most that I've tasted from around the country."
"This is a hoppy and refreshing brew. I wouldn't call this spectacular, but it's a good hop fix."
"Appearance is an amber color, fairly dark for a pale ale, and the head was fine. Smell was a good mix of citrus, sweet hops and a bit of caramel. Taste was a great balance of hops, citrus, caramel malt and a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was nice, somewhat thick for a pale ale but with a clean finish. Overall, one of my favorite pale ales and something I'd certainly recommend."
"Another one of my favorites that I have just never gotten around to reviewing. Beer is currently being served at fridge temp (I've had it at all temps by now, and on a hot summer day nothing beats a cold PA). Poured into an American pint glass. A nice fluffy off-white head formed, and slowly receded to a layer of foam floating on top of the beautiful brew. This beer is clear, and straw colored. Aroma is clearly dominated by citrusy American hops. Lots of aroma is being eminated, no need to even swirl to get a full """wiff""". The aroma told the truth, flavor is dominated by a smooth and mild citrusy hops flavor, with a nice smooth maltiness to bask it up. For a pale ale, this is pretty damn hoppy, but still alittle mild for me. Definitely not your average PA. Founder's seems to like to have a certain degree of thickness in its beers, and that is seen here. Most other pale ales I have are pretty light bodied, but this has alittle more to it, no where near the body of its others though. Drinkability is amazing. I love this beer, but normally go for the more hoppy Centennial IPA, or Red's Rye. If you are liking your PAs and are afraid to move on to IPAs, I'd use this as a stepping stone. I think its one of the better pale ales out there."
"Pours a light orangish yellow. Smelled mostly of hops and citrus, maybe some yeasty tones. Taste was bitter and dry, mostly of hops and citrus. A decent offering but there are better Founders beers out there. Mouthfeel is ok, mostly a dry bitter aftertaste. This is a fine beer, good for an APA, holds its own in the pale ale catagory. I would suggest this beer to hop fans or looking for a beer that pushes its boundries."
"This is a decent pale ale from Founders. It does not measure up to many of their other beers in complexity, but those are some high standards. There is a strong dry-hop flavor in the finish and up front, which only somewhat balanced by residual sugars. I liked this beer, but it is not anything special."
"Not really what I would call a """refreshing""" beer as it seems heavy and a little too sweet. It is a fresh, juicy brew though. But seriously, whats the deal with these rediculous heads?"
"On tap at Slow's BBQ in Detroit,poured a hazed light copper with a orange hue a small but well retained white head.There was a dose of American hops in this brew you could tell right off the bat in the nose quite piney and citrusy but there was a very noticable sweet caramel aroma that nearly matched the healthy dose of hops.Very well balanced with a real American character piney and citrusy and very crisp over top of a firm slightly sweet doughy malt backbone.Solid what else to say about this beer,very food friendly with good bbq cutting power with those hops."
"I wasn't shocked at how exceptionally smooth this one is, being I've never had a poor founder's beer. Not much smell, a little citrusy grapefruit on the nose. Hundreds of these can be drank in one session and it is extremely smooth. Small malt on the front, quick smooth transition to the back with a slight, and highly dry finish, making it bold. Highly recommended!"
"Not an overly complex brew but overly drinkable. A subtle hop component with a nice malt mid palate. A creamy thick mouthfeel leaves a desire for the next drink and the next. Buttered toast is one of the main components I can pull from this one. Could drink a lot of these but I think there are many other beers out there that are a tad more complex that would get me hard earned money first."
"I think this is a very drinkable beer."
"D: Hop lovers could session this, if it wasn't quite as carbonated."
"Mouthfeel- Medium dryness at the tip and center of the tongue. Lights of light malts also mixing well with these complex hop flavors."
"An interesting dry hopped beer in that it almost overdoes it with the hop flower bitterness and not hop flavor. The nose is bizarre because you can barely smell any hops at all. It's good, but I'm not sure if I'd have it again."
"Pours murky apricot. Very coarsely filtered--almost too much. I dont want to see big floaties in my beer and there arent here but --its close--I'd advise drinking this stuff as freshly as possible or discard completely--else the floaties might grow. Tastes more like an IPA than just a pale ale. Probably Centennial hops which Founders seems to like to use. Overall-its a decent beer and the hops are more subdued than most IPAs, it is a pretty good beer but not much more."
"good drinkability, a more than decent pale ale. i wonder what's causing the astringency though. wihtout that, this would be a pretty damn good beer,"
"Notes: Good all-around pale ale. I would lean toward Founders other selections, but not with too much prejudice. Not my favorite pale ale, but I wouldnt turn one down when offered."
"Dull amber-orange. The body of the beer is speckled with particles in suspension. No head to speak of . Just a slight collar that leaves sparse lace. Nose is citrus, orange peel and light biscuit malts. Flavor is sweet over bitter. For a pale ale, I'd call this a cloying sweetness even. Just not appropriate. Hops are minimized in it all. Some dry cedar like tones derived from hops I believe. Body is thick and syrupy. Really not that enjoyable."
"Verdict- Tasty and satisfying. The hopping might be a little light for the style, but it avoids the harshness sometimes seen in beers of this type."
"A nice APA from Founder's. Pours out to a slightly foggy bright yellow color with a nice 1/4 inch head of foam. Medium low level of carbonation. Nice lacing was noted on the interior of the glass. Aromas were of roasted malts and hops. Hints of citrus hang in the back. Taste is very straightforward, but well crafted. Lots of malt mixed with blends of citrus flavors and some dry grain and hops. Nice. Mouthfeel was good enough, but I would've cared for a more slick feel. Drinkability is pretty good. I'd go for this again. Recommended."
"I got a bottle because it was recommended to me, I'm a big hop lover, bet this beer was pretty average in my opinion. It was easily drinkable, but the taste only lasts a second and then disappears leaving more to be desired. This is a beer that could have been great but for some reason just ended up less than expected."
"The color is like a blonde with high lights, golden with sparkles of red and amber. The aroma is wounderful with a slight citrus, rich malt and hint of yeast. The flavor is rich with malt and hop flavor, little citrus refreshes the middle with hop flavor and finishes smooth with a lingering citus on the tounge. Not to heavy on the mouth and is an easy drinker. Easy drinker and great taste make this an all out good buy."
"drinkability: a little above average for APA"
"Is there beer at the bottom of this foam? ..I can't quite tell. Even with the most careful pour, the foam erupts in the glass...making me wait patiently to try it. I gotta say..I am not a fan of the overcarbonated bottles (other reviews show this is not an extremely rare thing with this beer). Aroma is pale malts and light citrus (orange peel?). The taste is good for a pale ale..very flavorful without being over the top in any single aspect..mostly pale malt character with a notable dry-hop addition. Definitely a better-than-average pale, but I'd be a bit more pleased with this if I wasn't sucking in so much foam with every sip."
"Yet another fine offering from Founders Brewing. Keep up the great work!!!"
"Great biscuity bready flavors with a hint of caramel sweetness. Well-balanced hop bittering is more subdued than in the bottle, and is accompanied by the slightest hint of diacetyl, which I'm starting to enjoy. A light body and delicate carbonation add to an already very drinkable brew. Time to go to the bar!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a very drinkable smooth pale ale. Not alot of carbonation to be had. I think I will pour myself another."
"Smells lightly of cirtusy hops. Tastes quite excellent, up there with Anchor Liberty Ale for a pleasant, balanced APA. Malts are complemented well by a prominent, but not assaulting, citrusy hop flavor. Just a touch of bittering in the finish. A nice, creamy mouthfeel completely a ridiculously drinkable APA."
"this beer is a pretty good APA and i would buy it regularly if there weren't much better examples readily available (Great Lakes Burning River, SNPA) . There is a bit of an off taste to me that is very difficult to describe as it doesn't taste like anything else i've ever experience, it does not make it a bad beer but it does make me want to stick to other pale ales when i'm in the mood for one."
"Thinish, light mouthfeel. Might receive a higher rating if the carbonation was reduced a bit to """thicken""" the feel up and uncover some of the flavors. Still drinkable though. I feel my scores undermind this brew a bit, but I dont know what to change..."
"Overall this is a very nice Pale and highly drinkable beer. Not overly bitter or mega-hopped, but very enjoyable on a session-type level. Another point for Founder's."
"Drinkability was excellent. I would definitely get this one again. An excellent session beer."
"This is a very drinkable beer once the carbonation calms down. it is super good!!!! I do highly recommend this brew, and I would even go a bit out of my way to look for it!"
"This beer pours out brownish yellow, topped with half an inch of white foam. Fruity malt aroma with some hops, but not as much as I expected. Sweet malty base, with apricots and orange. Hops come in midway through, but does not taste very fresh. This beer in general has a stale taste. Mouthfeel is medium. This beer did not really leave me wanting another. Not as good as most Founder's beers."
"Pours a semi-cloudy pale golden color with faint reddish hues along the sides. The head is absolutely enormous, creamy, and white. The aroma is floral and fruity. Not overpowering, but pleasant and relaxing. The taste is rather balanced. The sip is a plethora of fruits, while the aftertaste is slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than medium bodied. Overall, this is a darn good pale ale if you want something that is not overly hoppy."
"Notes: I couldn't handle this beer. This was only the second beer I've ever had that ended up in a drain pour. Most definitely AVOID."
"Little head to speak of and what there was disappeared quickly. Strong, earthy and bready smell with hops prevelant. Very dry with little more than a weak, residual yeasty flavor left on the tongue. Not a brew that is prompting me to quickly grab one of it's brothers-in-cardboard. One is certainaly more than enough as the experience leaves something to be desired."
"Hazy straw yellow topped by an enormous white head. I could only pour about a quarter of the beer in my glass at a time, there's so much carbonation. At least it leaves some lacing on the glass. Strong aroma of piney and citrus hops, to the point of smelling acidic. Very light malt flavour, balanced quite far towards bitterness. Hop flavours are mostly citric and a bit harsh. Finishes extremely dry with a bit of malt and lingering pine needle bitterness. Carbonation is indeed very high, giving this lighter bodied beer an airy texture. But the astringent dryness and harsh hop character make this less than a favourite."
"This is just another nice, clean, safe Pale Ale. A hazy, orange-hued, body with an airy head. The aroma is citrusy and filled with a fresh cut grass smell. The taste is nice and filled with a moderate hop presence. The finish is nice and dry with the sweetness of the malt pulling through. Definately not a bad beer, but there are so many good pale ales out there, that this doesn't stick out in the memory."
"Pale golden color-somewhat slight amber hue but fairly light in color. Low aroma-for being dry hopped as the label states theres not too much there. Ok malty flavor-ok balance of hops behind it all. Decent body-well rounded and a good balance between hops and malt. Ok beer-pretty standard stuff. Thanks to crjmellor for the sample."
"ng"
"12 oz bottle pours a hazy bright copper with a small white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Citrus grapefuit-piney aroma, typical hoppy flavors of grapefruit, lemon and pine. Medium bodied with a crisp carbonated mouthfeel that finishes bittter, an average but very drinkable APA."
"Nice golden color with a slight haze from lack of filtering. Slight head that leaves a nice lace. Lots of floral and citrus aroma, obviously cascades hops. As it says on the bottle, it was also dry hopped. Nice upfront bitterness, not overdone. Enough malt sweetness to balance. Goes down smooth. This is a nice standard APA, nothing overdone."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 4""" white head over not much beer at all. Must be the dry-hop effect on the carbonation or something. Head fades slowly above the warm golden brew, and lacing is nice and foamy. Aroma is of fruity and piney hops. Taste is minimally of pale malts, and the switches to hops mode, which are restrained, yet remaining flavorful. Just seems the flavor profile lacks a bit of something, but still good. Mouthfeel is good, and the drinkability could have been even better if I didn't have to wait around to get the beer into the bottle. A nice beer I would revisit."
"Tastes """juicy""" from the hops paired with a good malt backbone. Very hoppy in the finish, but its not overwhelming. Goes down easy."
"The flavor is loaded with hops. The malts are noticeable, but the hops rule this one. Citrusy and wonderful. Impressive. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied; nothing more, nothing less. Carbonation feels perfect. This beer is also easy to drink. Didnt take long to finish a pitcher at the local watering hole and leave a little buzzed... Another elite contender from Founders, great work guys!"
"Drinkability is ok not one I would seek out but worth a try. Thanks go to merlin48 for this sample."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation. This is easy to drink but the particular flavor profile doesn't have me going back for more. The first Founders offering that I've been less than pleased with."
"Pours a slight ruby pale yellow color with a small fizzy white head. Smells of pine and grapefruits. All hops in the nose. Taste is fairly straight forward. Rather dry in the mouth, not much residual sweetness or malt backing to this, more of a grainy taste. Hop flavor isnt really too evident here, I mean it is here, but not very noticeable, you couldnt pick it out of a line up. The bitterness rounds out this brew. Kinda just eh in the mouth, but highly drinkable, not that I couldnt find a better session brew than this. Kinda just average and nothing more. Go for the Centennial IPA, pass this one up."
"From notes. Pours a yellow color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of citrus hops and it also has some spices. The flavor is packed full of the citrus and pine hops. It also has some spices and a little bit of caramel. The body is slightly more thin than what I expected, but the drinkability is good."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a very thin head which quickly dissipates. Smells of citrous hops and some caramel. I was looking for more of a nose due to their advertising of dry hopping, though. Taste is overall kind of bland. Smooth malt moves into astringent bitterness and some husky grain flavors. Not enough malt to balance this ale. Finish is dry and astringent. Although not a bad beer, there is nothing to make me want another one - especially with much more interesting examples of the style."
"Drinkability: One or two Founder's Pale Ales will make an excellent aperitif for a dinner with salomon fillets."
"Beautiful deep golden color, mostly clear with a bit of sediment (bottle conditioned beer, I hope...). Topped by a fluffy white head that slowly fades. As it fades it leaves a sheet of foam on the sides of the glass. Great citrus hop aroma with a nice complement of sweetness. Not really floral, more of a caramel malty sweetness. Absolutely wonderful hop flavor. Nice malt backbone as well. The hops have a solid bitterness to them and a noticeable but restrained citrus flavor. Very smooth both in bitterness and mouthfeel, with a vibrant tingling from the carbonation. Drinkability is terrific, as 12 ounces was finished much too quickly. A great APA, and a great beer as well. Somewhat unrelated, founders also has some very nice label art, IMO."
"Pours a slightly hazed honey amber body with a white head that is small but longlasting. Good patchy lace is deposited on the glass. Aroma is citrusy grapefruit, lemon, and mandarin orange with caramel malt undertones. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied, with spritzy carbonation. Taste is dominated by the citrusy hops, but not overly bitter. Fruity grapefruit and orange work well with the caramel malt backbone. Another fine ale from Founders, that is crisp and refreshing. I enjoyed this one more than Founders Centennial IPA. Thanks to brewedlyhooked13 for the trade."
"Medium bodied."
"Slightly hazy, pale gold in hue, it is a pale color, even for the style. There is a barrage of carbonation, the head reached epic proportions, at the zenith this foam was five-fingers, I mean, there was a fist of foam. It sat on top of the beer like meringue. It took multiple attempts to fill my pint glass. Those are the breaks. In time the head faded to a tight, frothy cap. Subsequent lacing was clumpy and widespread. On the whole this beer looks good. The nose offers flaky citrus, kisses of pine bark, orange zest, sugar, and neutral grain hints. The bouquet is very muddled; it fails to articulate its point. Based on the nose, it seems to be saying, Im not very bitter and I have little malt base. Those comments dont compel me to quaff. There is nothing off about the bouquet; it just is messy with no direction, no depth, no start and thus no finish. Flat. The palate isnt exactly what the nose said it was going to be. There is some bitterness in the middle; it is heavy and awkward though. The start is skinny and weak with minimal flavors, speckles of citrus and pine. In the middle these flavors turn louder and some raw leafiness is introduced along with some musty, hoppy residue. This aspect is quite pleasant. In the finish the beer houses a good dose of fruitiness (rather nondescript, more berry-like and citrusy then anything else) and some yummy marshmallow flavors. Sugar. Heat. The nose was correct about the malt; it is unremarkable aside from a kiss of caramel. The aftertaste is warm and raw. This beer ends much better than it starts and it tastes more complete then it smelled. But at its best this beer is only above average, as an APA it is solid. Overly carbonated mouthfeel, I really dont like this feeling it is spritzy and airy. Medium/medium-light in body, this beer needs more malt as it falls apart right before I swallow. Empty. This beer is easy to drink; it is a BBQ beer or a beer for chili. Im not knocking it but Im not going to go out of my way to drink this beer again. I was very happy to purchase a six-pack in Iowa City, IA. If the circumstances were right I would drink this again. It is solid overall but lacks finesse and depth. In that sense this beer is forgettable, in the moment it is quaffable. I shall enjoy the rest of the bottles I have. It is uncomplicated but tasty worth a try."
"This beer pours an ever so slightly golden colored yellow with a 2 finger head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is slightly citrusy sweet and spicey hop. It really smells nice. The flavor is nice, though a touch thin. The hop is dominant, slightly sweet and with a very nice bit of spice in it. The caramel malt hids behind, coming through on the swallow. The feel is moderate, with a medium carbonation. I find it very refreshing and quenching. A fine example of an APA if you ask me. Very enjoyable."
"The taste is not overly interesting. Mildly bitter, citrus and sweet with a pleasantly dry aftereffect. This is a pretty lightly flavored offering. A typical pale ale. Well balanced betwixt malt and hop kingdoms. I could drink a goodly few of these in a session since it is miles away from overbearing."
"I enjoyed this fine sessioner on tap in Ann Arbor. Poured light amber, hazy and supporting a minimal medium bubble head. Left alot of light, fine lacing behind. Nose is delicate hops and fruity esters. Notes of honey, vanilla, and slightly flowery, This is a moderatly hopped ale, nicely balanced and supremely drinkable. More fine brew from Founders, when are you going to be available in New York??"
"Drinkability: Pretty good. Would be an excellent summer beer to relax with after a round of 18."
"Not a tremendously interesting rendition, especially from Founders."
"This beer poured a clear gold color with a thick and dense white head. It took me 5 minutes to pour this beer due to the head formation. A stream of champagne bubbles feeds the head for a good period of time. A thick sheet of lace clings to the side of the glass as I taste the beer. The nose is primarily light grain aromas with a touch of floral hop. I expected more hop aroma with the advertised dry-hopping. The flavor has a little more hops, much more of a citrus character than hop flower. Very fruity, less malt than I expected. Carbonated mouth feel leads to a medium drinakbility. I was not overwhelmed with this beer."
"Not bad, but not good enough that I'll be revisiting after the six pack is empty."
"Too sweet to drink much of it; still, impeccably balanced."
"from the bottle. poured a cloudy golden color with a off white head. aroma hoppy, caramel, sweet malts, citrus. flavor, grapefruit, honey , hops, some malts, hints of peaches and oranges. this was a very drinkable beer will buy more. so far I like all the founders I have had to date"
"I could drink this beer any time, any place, any where and in any amount. Disturbingly addicting. A session beer for marathon drinkers. Bottle is gone moments after opening. Simply delicious. I am a sucker for citrusy pales like this."
"This APA pours an effervescent dark golden color with a medium thick and foamy white head. Thin lacing. The aroma is floral hops with a touch of citrus. Medium-bodied with a creamy texture at times. Hops, caramel and malt flavors. The finish is citrus hops with a piney character. All in all very easy to drink, straightforward and enjoyable."
"I like Founders. Dave and Mike do a great job running the brewery. I have yet to taste one I don't like. I am lucky to have a brewery of this quality close to where I live."
"Copuld stand to be a lot hoppier, then I'd be happier with it, but as it is, this is a very nice pale ale, one I would accept in any situation."
"So I was drinking this beer tonight and decided to look it up and maybe update my review of it when to my surprise I see that I've never reviewed it! I really cannot believe it as this is often my session beer of choice and one that I recommed to my non-micro friends. There's a good combination of cascade hops mixed with sweet malts. The malts seem to be caramel with sweetness and bready with dryness. The hops are flavorful but not too bitter. Sometimes this beer tastes a bit too oxidized but that's only happened a few times. Not a great amount of depth on this beer but definitely one that you could drink a few of."
"I would describe this as an easy drinking yet very flavorful pale ale. I will be buying more of this. I love trying beers from other parts of the US."
"Pours a nice light amber with a half inch white head which laces the glass nicely. One nice thing about the appearance of this beer is that the head takes forever to recede, its like its glued to the glass. Initial aromas are of citrus and piney hops with a little malt backing. For taste, this beer hits initially with citrus hops followed by some nice bready malts and a little caramel. In the middle there is a little nutty character. Afterwards more hops come up and leave an almost lime taste with yet more citrus and a light bitter finish. This beer is nice and crisp with a creamy mouthfeel almost. As for drinkability this beer is quite nice, almost like a mellow IPA that still has a good hop hit. Overall a solid beer that's nicely balanced with the hops dominating only a little over the malts. I still think its missing just a little something to fully bring this beer to be a classic."
"Pours a golden, light copper color with a white foamy head. The head disappeared fairly quickly. There is a fair amount of lace on the glass. Smell is big on citrus. The label says, """A testament to Cascade Hops""". This is the truth. Nice malt sewwtness, balanced well with Cascades, leaving a grapefruit, dry finish. The hop bitterness is not as much as might be expected by the nose, but it was nicely balanced. This beer is very drinkable, and certainly worth a try."
"Thanks to trbeer for the many samples!"
"Not a bad brew....Nice light copper color ...little head, but decent lacing. Smell is light citrus hoppy. Taste is a blend of initial malt sweetness foloowed by a light bitter hoppiness. Fairly smooth, slightly oily mouthfeel. Easy enough to drink, but not spectacular."
"Hazy gold with a small creamy head on top that has good retention and stickiness. Smell is not huge, but clear and fresh cascade hops remind me of SNPA. Sweet bright fruit with a bit of biscuit and caramel. Taste is a smooth, balanced, unchanging mix of the bready light grains with cascade flavors. Finish is long. smooth, and herbal but fails to make me want more. Well made, just uninspiring."
"The hop flavor is crisp and a bit resinous. Mild citrus bitterness and a slight metallic edge provide quite the snappy hop taste and mouthfeel. It's a good brew that could be so much better."
"The second bottle this evening had nearly no carbonation. Surprising variation between bottles! Still good tho."
"You'll find more memorable beers, but this one holds its own."
"This is immensely enjoyable and drinkable beer. I also have a few Centennial IPAs in my beer fridge. They should be a real treat after tasting what Founders has done with Pale Ale. Thanks to deejaydan for the bottles."
"This is a little different than I was expected. It has a complex flavor that I think I'll appreciate more the more I drink it. Overall I like it a lot!"
"Thanks CRJMellor."
"Some malt on the palate, but the hops are out of balance. This one is grapefruit city. Lots of chalkiness on the long bitter finish. Mouthfeel is OK due to bottle-conditioning, but the excessive water treatment makes the finish a bit harsh."
"An awesome pale ale, nearly rivaling Stone's IPA but less bitter and with a touch less body. Not as intense as the Centennial, but very solid. This will become as staple of my fridge in the summer when I want something a touch lighter than an IPA. Highly recommended. Royalty amongst American Pale Ales. World class."
"Alittle late on my review of thisone being I sought this brewer out in mid-december at a company annual meeting in this beers home town of Grand Rapids.In fact we stayed just two blocks from the brewery, a very nice area.I hope to try all the styles they offer as we return over the years. Anyway the pale poured a nice golden, almost light rust color, with a slight off-white, one inch head that maintained ok to a film that laced well. The aroma is hoppy with hints of citrus. The taste is also more hop than malt for the malt is more of a point of balance for this brew. Almost like a not so strong IPA. The cascade hops are well blended to bite at first sip with a crisp citrus mouthfeel then smoothed out by the hint of malt. A good well balanced brew. Sorry so wordy, but I gave half a point to drinkability for I would seek michigan again for this brew!!"
"For a beer style that's become a dime a dozen, this beer does a tremendous job of differentiating itself by being dry hopped, by not being unbalanced toward the hop and by sustaining that wonderful orangey-danish flavor."
