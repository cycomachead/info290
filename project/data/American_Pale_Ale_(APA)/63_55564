A finger of fluffy, white head on top of a deep tangerine body, hints of red in the light. Light piney aromas, hint of grapefruit, clean and subtle with a hint of lemon grass or saffron. Nearly perfect for a PA. Balance is the word on flavor. Light grapefruit rind, citrus bitterness on the front. Mid palate has a nice lightly toasted malt base. Super clean. Perfect finish like a cool glass of lemonade on a summer's day. This may be my summer lawnmower beer. Hands down beats the pants off SNPA.","Mikus","Apr 05, 2015"

S: Citrus and grapefruit with some floral, fruit, melon.  T: A rich, creamy fruit filled palate sweetened with light caramel that dries out with a grapefruit rind bitterness on the finish.

A lucky customer can snag a 12-pack of this at the supermarket for as cheap as $12.99 (but usually a bit more), making it in Seattle *the* best beer that one can buy in terms of quality to price point. Significant head dissipates to a enduring lace around the edges. Strong and sweet slate of light malt, lightly toasted, is prominent. Fruity, but not citrusy or cannabisy, aromas--saffron?-- and taste of hops balance the flavor but don't dominate. One of my ATF beers, which I buy regularly, and this tasting hasn't changed that perception a bit. Easy drinking and a crowd pleaser.","takusan1000","Feb 27, 2015"

It has all the fruity hops you want in an APA, but also has a wonderful bready backbone that carries the flavors through the finish. I like my pale ales to be a subdued version of a juicy IPA, and thats exactly what this is. In fact, this is basically the little brother of fresh squeeze.

The balance in this brew is ridiculous. A sweet citrusy hoppy profile gives way to a smooth caramel/bready maltiness that then, just as quickly, lends itself back into a crisp piney finish that lingers while reminding you of the malty profile it just impressed upon you. This seriously may be the most well balanced beer I've ever tasted. I've had this beer for the past four years before finally reviewing it. It is simply unmatched in balance. Damned near a perfect beer in my humble beer loving opinion. Cheers!","beerdichampion","Feb 06, 2015"

But, let me describe it for you the best I can, OK?   First, pear, apricot and cherry hits the note with the right amount of carbonation. Cherry note finish, but dry and soothing with creamy finish.  Spot on in my book, this is a A+ beer, got to get it every season.  Great job, Deschutes!!!!","ta_hagen","Feb 04, 2015"

I do love hops, but it's nice to have APAs like this one, which is very well balanced. The hops are there, but there is a really great malt presence too. The flowery and piney hops come on first, then the sweet bready malts take over. The flavors wash over and over. This is an excellent beer.","WAbeerfiend","Sep 23, 2014"

3.78,-7.8,4,4,4,3.25,3.25," Pours a pretty medium-amber in color with almost a 1-finger thick off-white head. A decent amount of lacing is seen that sticks to the sides of the glass, which is common for this type of brew. The aroma is of light sweet bread, with some floral hops. The taste has more going on with some citrus zest in the mix as well. Great taste but has a slightly bitter finish that stays around a bit. Does take about half the drink to get used to it. Overall great taste and even better with a less hoppy finish. I did drink the whole glass as wouldn't be the case if it was a I.P.A.","BeerWithMike","Jul 03, 2014"

This beer is for those of you that tried Mirror Pond but thought it too malty, not challenging/potent enough, or simply that you prefer a stronger hop character over a maltier one. This beer is never too hoppy though, and isn‚Äôt for hop-heads, as it is still superbly balanced and rich.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 21, 2014"

May not be a fair comparison since the named it NWPA, it certainly favors the taste of those living from Oregon North!Starts great and finishes even better. It was by a complete fluke I even bought it, a person at working stocking the beer at Safeway in Ballard suggested it. I was smart enough to listen.","ssteakley","Apr 12, 2014"

The taste of the yeast adds a slight hint of tangy sweet apple skin with a mild toasted malt element and light herbal flavor in the finish 4.25 Overall I really enjoyed this about equally in the bottle as the draft version the only exception is the hops seemed more aromatic in the draft, but the overall enjoyment is the same -4","Slatetank","Mar 28, 2014"

As I continued to taste, this pale ale leans more toward an amber like a Troegs Nugget Nectar; again, pretty high praise. Bottom line is that for 6.2% ABV, this beer packs a lot of flavor and feel and I'm glad it made it to south-central PA starting this week.","Tucquan","Mar 26, 2014"

The aroma signals that this is indeed a hoppy ale from the northwest. The citrus, orange mostly, and floral character are sewn together beautifully. A very subtle malt note lingers in the background. This theme continues on the palate. Orange, grapefruit, and floral hoppiness scrub the palate and leave a faint oily residue of hops. Malt sweetness isn't a major player here, but there is enough to prevent this from being a one trick pony. Nicely done.","BeardedBoffin","Mar 23, 2014"
4.73,15.4,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Poured dark amber color. Slightly hazy. Very thick foamy head with large amount of lacing along the glass. Strong citrus smell. Can also pick out pine, maybe grapefruit. Hop forward tastes that mellows to a more malty smooth presence. Still retains the bitter aftertaste I love about pale ales and IPAs. Strong citrus and pine taste with a hint of grapefruit. For some reason, I keep on thinking cherries as well after taking a drink. Excellent, smooth beer that you can enjoy in multiples on a nice spring day.","jngrizzaffi","Mar 23, 2014"

4.45,8.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Poured a cloudy amber orange without any head to speak of and some slight bubbles coming up. Not the best looking pale ale I've seen, but its pretty nice. Scent begins with a big hit of orange zest from Centennial hops, mingling with some pine resin and slight grapefruit along with a nice, pleasant malty sweetness and some nice grassy aromas. Quite appetizing, very well done. Taste begins with orange sweetness, a bit of pine resin and some nice caramel malt. Pine resin comes out more in the middle, overpowering the orange and caramel sweetness. The finish returns to the caramel and orange but also adds a good hit of bitter citrus pith and pine resin. The aftertaste is bitter with hints of toasted malt. A good, robust, but not overpowering flavor profile. Complex but accessible, very well done. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of prickly carbonation upfront and a smooth feel in the middle and finish. Very easy to drink as a result, expertly done. Overall this is an excellent pale ale. It highlights citrus and pine forward hops, without the high bitterness of an IPA, balances them with some nice sweet malt and combines that flavor with an excellent aroma and mouthfeel. Another winner from Deschutes.","Auraan","Feb 15, 2014"

Silky creaminess gives way to sweetness that cuts through a dry edge it begins to take, adding depth to the overall feel.

Keep 'em coming guys. A light bronze colored brew, just a notch above dark gold, with around an inch of beige head. Aroma a pleasing blend of rich crystal malts, bubblegum and red berry fruit esters, and fresh citrus zest, quite balanced although the citrus is probably the main component that jumps out. On the palate I again get considerable citrus: Grapefruit, mandarin, lemon, and lime zest/juices along with orchard fruit (peach?), white grape, baby aspirin, and a mellow brown sugar malty backbone. Some booze winks through from time to time and the hops morph a bit from citrus to celery stalk. Body and mouthfeel are right on point for the style, more chew than a lager but about the same degree of carbonation. I might ratchet this latter element down a notch or two. Has much of the Cascade hop character of its stablemate and fellow pale ale Mirror Pond but with more west coast citrus flavors layered on and a higher ABV. A nice enough jaunt. The mellow sweet malts let the hops shine through. It would be great to crush a six-pack or two with a few buddies.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 08, 2014"

Scant patches of bubbles linger to decorate the surface as wispy trails lace the glass. The aroma is of varied, citrusy hops and a malty, caramel background. Some orange up front with balanced toffee in the rear; not aggressive, not underwhelming, but balanced and reasonably complex. Flavor follows suit, with a nice malt component playing second fiddle to fresh, citrusy hops. Some orange, pine, and lemon zest meld with caramel, toffee, and subtle notes of brown sugar in a very drinkable manner. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and refreshing with a slightly resinous finish. The carbonation level is appropriate for this style and does well to liven the beer. Overall... while there may be pales out there that fit a specific flavor profile or showcase a different ingredient better, the Red Chair offers a surprisingly refreshing degree of balance and quality in a beer that does not decimate a single population of taste buds. The substantial malt background makes it an excellent choice for the colder months, and the superb drinkability/affordability is why I return to it (by the case) every year.","eclipse54","Jan 21, 2014"

3.79,-7.6,3.5,3.25,4,4,4,"Overall - Nice "alternate" pale ale that would be a great introduction for some to craft beers. Very drinkable...I wouldn't describe this as flabby; it has a nice balance and does what it says.","babayaga","Dec 29, 2013"
3.71,-9.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,"Pours a copper color with a three finger off white head. Good amount of carbonation coming off the glass. Smells of Northwest Pacific hops like the title suggests. Citrus notes like grapefruit, tangerine, and mango. Also a good amount of pine. A hefty dose of carmel malts and breadiness sweeten the aroma and stay true to what the beer description suggests: a well balanced american pale ale. Taste starts with some nice hoppy flavors. Get grapefruit and orange, almost like a marmalade. The middle brings a big malt profile to go with the hops. Get some grains, breadiness, and carmel sweetness. Maybe get a belgian-like malt in there too. This balances the beer in a really nice way. The finish brings a lot of pine that gives the beer a resinous quality, as well as more grapefruit, marmalade, floral esters, carmel, spiciness, and breadiness. Light medium body with a pretty creamy, smooth, and slightly watery mouthfeel. This is a solid pale ale that lives up to what it says it will be. In the world of american pale ales nowadays, it is nothing to ride home about; however, it‚Äôs great balance stands it out from a lot of the hoppy, one-sided american pale ales that are being produced today.","brewskis","Dec 28, 2013"

This beer is somewhat of a hybrid between an easy drinking american pale ale (think Sierra Nevada Pale Ale) and a more complex IPA. It has a nice malty backbone and a decent amount of sweetness allow for easy drinking while the burst of aromatic hops (pine, grapefruit) give it a great deal of depth. It has a decent head and is a nice cloudy burnt orange. Not a ton of a carbonation and a long-lasting almost sticky aftertaste.","JesseMurdock","Apr 14, 2013"

While its nice that they are distributing to Chicago (easy to drive down to get it for me being in Wisconsin), I think I would rather have Alpha King if I want a nice hoppy pale ale- it does what this beer does but quite a bit better, and I can still get it in Wisconsin.

This beer still is very solid. It's no longer my favorite, but its toward the top of the list though. A word of warning, the bottle serving is a tad too bitter and woody for my taste. Though still good, the bottle just doesn't seem to finish quite as clean, diminishing the best quality of this beer.

The aroma seems like it should stand up more‚Äî I just gets a creamy, mild floral and tangerine hop character. The flavor, however, has big, biting grapefruit over a subtle caramel malt backbone. There's also a nice juicy hop undertone that sets this apart from your average all-citrus pale ale. I'm a fan, it's a touch thick for the style, but damn tasty and a good break from the often-boring APA. Have a couple pints, you won't regret it.","tempest","Jan 12, 2013"

The baance is a little more hops than malt overall, but that being said, I'd this is a very well balanced APA. The malts and hops each have there influence on your tasted buds and palate.

Yep, the mouthfeel is just about right, maybe a little more carbonation. Oooo baby, this one tastes perfect. Totally pale ale. Slight hops greet me with a full flavored ale which i WISH wasn't only a seasonal. This one needs to be a full-time offering for sure. Overall, great beer indeed.","Jellopants356","Jan 09, 2013"

The aroma of this APA consists of orange peel, grapefruit and floral hops. The foundation of this ale contained toasted malted grain, spicy white pepper, sweet caramel and citric orange peel. This is an outstanding APA, well balanced, excellent "hop factor". If your looking for a unique APA that is "hoppy" try this excellent brew.","GossageBrewery","Oct 16, 2012"

Light and enjoyably carbonated, but not low ABV like a lame "session ale". I'm grateful to have access to such an exquisite beverage, thank you Deschutes #We'reNotWorthy","kchannel9","Apr 09, 2012"

One of the best grapefruit aromas I have come across from any beer, like I just cut open a fresh grapefruit and put it right up to my nose. Sharp, pointy, crisp. Flavor is just as good with the marriage between malt and hops. A light caramel malt base alongside a wonderful hit of ruby red grapefruit. There is a very balanced layer of piney bitterness throughout. A very crisp, silky mouthfeel aided by the carbonation. Wow, this is a great beer. Extremely balanced, extremely drinkable, extremely good. I can't get enough of this one and can't believe its only seasonal. I could drink this 365 without any problems.

Peering into this deep cherry wood color brew, you can‚Äôt see through it due to a medium amount of haze. The head is thin, but the aroma is wonderful. Lots of hoppy spice and fruit notes. The flavor is outstanding; the malt is subtle while the hops do the talking, but not too loudly. Lots of flavors come and go: apple, spice, and flowers. There is an undercurrent of bitterness, and in a good way. In the end, this is a winner. Maybe not as smooth as other beers, but it is well balanced, and the rich variety of hop notes are wonderful to experience. It will show up in my fridge again.","iSip","Jan 25, 2012"

Poured into half glass and gives an amber orange appearance with a thin white head and just a touch of lacing. Aroma of citrus, grainy malts with touches of toast and caramel. Dry and spicy aroma overall. Citrus hops upfront with layers of spiciness. The semi-grainy malt backbone is fairly complex with biscuit, toast, caramel and some grassy characteristics. Ends with a spicy bitterness. Moderate carbonation, medium body that is fairly full and smooth for an APA. Nice dry finish.

Upon the second sip, I got a creamy hoppy flavor, with a hint of yeast, citrus and spice, but just a hint. There was also a sweet/bitterness that made it interesting. Loads of components that would have been more evident if not for the overpowering piney flavor. Might as well advertise this as an IPA, not Pale Ale!","BeerManDan","May 22, 2011"

3.83,-6.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a nice light orange amber with a half-finger whitish head that leaves a bit of lacing and a thin layer on the surface. Smell is pine and earthy hops, rather gentle on the nose. Taste leads with hops, fairly strong but not overpowering, backed up by a decent bit of caramel malt sweetness. The flavor is pleasant and soothing. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with below-average carbonation. Everything about this beer says "Drink me." Nothing about is says "I'm amazing," or "I'm delicious." It's a nice, balanced pale ale. Not overly flavorful, but very drinkable. I guess the ABV is a bit high to call this a session ale, but it definitely drinks like a session ale.

Taste is smooth for an APA, starts with the hops in the front of the tongue then moves to the malts in the middle. Deschutes tried to emphasize the malts in this one, it's a really good argument for a great APA that doesn't have a jr IPA. The balance leans a little more to the malty side, but it still seems "right" the finish contains some bitterness from the malt and hops but the after taste seems clean. Mouthfeel is perfect for an APA with this flavor profile, just a hair heavier than a hoppy APA, but it still has good carbonation.

Red Chair enters the market at a time when APAs almost seem like old news, as though with the growth of IPAs this style is antiquated or redundant. Red Chair shows that APA still has something to say, it is still relevent, and when done right, you can tell why so many APAs have become brewery flagships over the years. This is a great beer.

I am sure there are differences, but it very much resembled an IPA to me. My drinking buddies couldn't tell the difference either. Smells like pine, grapefruit and slight cannibis. Loved how smooth this went down though. I drank it with a buffalo chicken sandwich and the spiciness of the chicken was tempered by the hops in the beer, very refreshing and crisp. I went home and immediately bought a 6 pack which was gone in like 2 days. Also tried it with a burger (excellent) and pasta (not bad). I like it because it doesn't dominate the conversation like a strong IPA or 2xIPA, the food has a chance to be complimented by the beer as opposed to being overwhelmed.

There is a lot of citrus, and pine that coats the mouth long after the beer is gone. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively, fine carbonation, and a velvety texture.

Red chair is very full-flavored, not to mention fairly strong for an American-style pale ale. While acidity gets in the way or becomes distracting in many beers, here it elevates the other qualities.

It definitely has some caramel malts as well. The hops and malt flavors are well balanced. I feel the yeast character is what makes this beer enjoyable.

Both are very fine beers. The Pale Ale version is very good, maybe one of the best. Too bad it is a limited edition ale. Probably my favorite Pale Ale so far.","Spikester","Aug 29, 2010"

A lovely aroma wafts off it--piney, with a little floral spiciness. The taste provides a mix of pine-resin, distantly citrusy hops, backed by sufficient caramel malt. Bitterness is moderate, but hop flavor is very prominent. Finishes both dry and toasty. Excellent mouthfeel--carbonation is of course restrained, it being casked, but it has an excellent soft creamy texture. Very good.","allengarvin","Jul 30, 2010"

Pale ale? Whatever. it's a killer beer with killer drinkability. Soft carbonation amid medium body. Enough pale malt sweetness to not-quite-balance the hops, but even the flavor of the malt is towards lightly toasted and untoasted sweet, not really caramelly.

4.15,1.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Another awesome extra from rmjavanut. Also my first beer from Deschutes. Pours very dark for a pale ale, dark orange, almost red. A small but sturdy white head sticks around nicely. Leaves some pretty nice lacing here and there. Smell is faint, much more malts than hops with a slight, pleasant whiff of citrus. Hops are more present in the taste but malts still have the upper hand here. Has a sweet butterscotch and caramel smoothness, carbonation is low which makes it stand out above anything else. Ripe citrus and hops pop in now and again to say hello. I really question the style categorization for Red Chair, it drinks infinitely more like a red ale than a pale (hence the name?), especially with the biscuity aftertaste coming into play. Hops seem to show their face a bit more in the finish. I loved the mouthfeel here, perfect thickness, very smooth. Some may want some more carbonation but I enjoyed the lack of it here. Very drinkable as well, if this were available in my area I'd pick it up as a session beer.","Chico1985","Apr 18, 2010"

The aroma is spicy and floral with a hidden malt butterscotch or pear tart to back it up. Fresh and hoppy with an elegant malt backdrop. The flavor is rich and full The flavor up front is hoppy with fresh floral notes that develops into a spicy flavor where the malt background develops, here the hops become more earthy and a light cookielike malt character reveals itself. This one is robust and delicious yet also approachable, balanced, and easily drinkable. The body is medium to a bit thick, the carbonation is high but it lends itself to a creamy fullness that gives a rich feel. Overall this is an exceptional brew, flavorful, well executed.

Medium in body but rather crisp, this is somewhere between a pale ale and a Pacific NW-style IPA. The finish reveals a faint metallic twang and a light, smooth bitterness. The body seems a touch heavy to me for this to be a session ale, though the overall mildness makes it very easy to drink. Solid and enjoyable stuff with a distinct Deschutes quality.","largadeer","Mar 23, 2010"

Hops are well integrated-- green and fresh, but not overpowering. Dryish, a bit minerally, with fine carbonation. Balanced and composed-- the definition of finesse.

4.1,0,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Bottle, home. Red Chair seems like a cross between an APA, IPA and Amber Ale. The color is somewhere between pumpkin and amber. Tight, dense, off-white cap of bubbles. The aroma has a clean caramel malt note with a fair bit of piney-floral hops. Flavor has a touch of sweetness from the bready, caramel malt, but hops provide a bitter finish and a mildly bitter sense of resin throughout. The feel is round and chewy with some hop oiliness. It's an easy beer to drink with good balance for a West Coast style Pale and a tame but flavorful profile. Enjoyable.","popery","Feb 18, 2010"
4.3,4.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"I had the Red Chair IPA that was discontinued from the Bond Street Ales. That brew had a ton of hop flavor with subtle hop bitterness and was labeled an IPA I guess it shook up the Pacific Northwest brewing scene a bit too much. This is the newly released Red Chair NWPA. Appears a bright copper with a bright white head forming thick and dwindling slow, leaves fine speckled lacing down the sides of my Otter Creek fluted pils glass. Aroma has bitter citrus peels with a fruity floral component. Complex hops very nice offering from Deschutes the flavor really explodes with a nice rolling hop bitterness and citrus zest. A mild fruity sweentess comes through but mainly citrus zest, floral hops, and earthy herbal hops. Hoppier than most IPAs, I don't get it they made an IPA that tasted like a pale and now a pale ale as hoppy as an IPA. Mouthfeel is nice with slick hop oils medium bodied not heavy, carbonation rolls on without a problem.

This is like a tamed-down IPA in flavor. Nice crisp hops at the forefront that bitter this one up. Semi-sweet candy-like finish. Not as balanced as I'd like, as it leans a bit more towards the hoppy side, but this is a NWPA, so that's expected. Great beer. Glad I had the opportunity.

Drying on the finish with a light sweetness and a lingering bitterness, a touch of alcohol is perceived as well. This is solid stuff.

The appearance isn't that impressive, not much lacing at all, and not too much of a head. Nice copper color though. The smell is very mild, with a very subtle citrus aroma. The taste was what made me want to write a review about this beer. I was very impressed with how well balanced the hop and malt characters were. The hops are there, but mostly in the background, most of the flavor up front comes from the malt. Usually for me, the hoppier the better. Even as subdued as the hops were in this beer, they were present enough to make me happy. The two positives that really stood out for me about this beer were it's pleasant citrus flavors and its drinkability. I could drink this beer for days. So refreshing!
