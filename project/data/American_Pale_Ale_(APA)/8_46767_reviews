"Has a really nice aftertaste, and ""after-fragrance", but not all jasmine-tea flowery (the way regular Bud is). Doesn't have much head, but I don't suppose it's meant to--and I HATE excessive, ""show-off-y"" head anyway! Wouldn't hurt if the hops were slightly more bitter, but I don't mean that as a criticism; the ale's compatible with its own type."

"I got a finger of tawny head from my pour, but it quickly dissipated. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled minty with a caramel/biscuit undertone, much like a Girl Scout Thin Mint. Mouthfeel was medium and the mintiness of the hops was immediately discernible on the tongue. It again begs the question of where does an APA leave off and an AIPA begin. As a self-avowed hophead, I have no problem with this sort of thing, but it surely was hoppy. Finish allowed the caramel/biscuit malts to get a chance to balance things out and they did so, nicely. A pretty good beer."

"Overall not awful but not getting that excited about this one."
"Overall this beer is very drinkable but yet distinct. I’m not the greatest at putting words to flavors so I will just say that I wouldn't change this beer in any way. For years it has been my favorite pale ale. It is also very affordable at $6.99 per six pack and $26 dollars after my case discount. I have always thought its the best beer for the money. RIP Drfter…. You’re a legend as far as I’m concerned."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium red coppery amber. Thin white head dissipates slowly to a film with light lacing. Aroma of grassy, slightly piney hops and biscuit malt. Flavor follows, biscuit malt and light grassy hops. Light bodied with decent carbonation. A good sturdy pale ale that looks a bit more like an amber, but the flavor is on style for a pale."

"Drank it straight from the bottle, actually drank three, one right after the other while watching football. BAP BAP BAP! Pleasantly surprised - Oregawn brew is usually too hoppy and the various brewers down there are in an arms race to outhop their competitors."
""
""
""
"Fairly mild mannered, with a bit of malt and handful of hops. Smooth, well balanced, and drinkable. Widmer makes solid brews."

"Superbly drinkable, without sacrificing taste. Excellent beer that I wouldn't mind having again."
""
""
""
""
"It's all over Florida, so it's there for you if you're lurking around the sunny-rainy ""Sunshine"" state. Unlike Florida, this beer always appears to deliver."
"The taste is something I can remember with a sweet malt flavor up front and quickly followed by dark fruit like pomegranate then a medium floral hop bitterness to tie it all together at the end. Likable through and through."
""
""
"Overall: A fairly by-the-numbers APA, but a decent beer nonetheless. Nothing I'd go out of my way for, but nothing I'd turn my nose up at either."
""
""
""
""

"Overall not a beer that stands out among the rest, but a good session ale. I probably won't buy it again though."
""
""
"This is the ""go to"" beer of choice. In my opinion, it is the best $7 six pack in the grocery store. Widmer does a great job of producing a high quality beer at an average Joe price. This is the working man's craft beer. Great amber color with just enough bite to remind you that it is a high quality beer, without the sticker shock."
"Overall a good pale ale that was above average with it leaning towards the malty side versus a hoppy pale ale. Easy drinking with just enough hops to let it flow like a good pale ale should."

"Deep copper orange in color with good clarity. Poured with a short off-white foam that reduced to a wispy cap that left a ladder of sticky lacings down the glass. Sweet caramel and ripe orange aromas with resinous pine beneath. Buttery smooth feel with slighty subdued carbonation. Sweet caramel and fruity flavors out of the gate that quickly transition to a resinous pine hoppiness to the end. Finishes crisp and dry."

"Widmer Brothers Drifter Pale Ale is a very clear, sparkling, amber ale with a soft, thin, off white head that leaves nice lacing. It has a fresh hop aroma, like pine trees, sweet caramel and a light toastiness. It's pretty light bodied and very smooth with a clean, dry finish. It has a lightly bitter, grassy, floral flavor. It tastes very tea like; very herbal. It's very refreshing. It's clean, but not weak. It's very drinkable."
""
""
"Widmer's ""The Original Drifter Pale Ale"" manages to be both hop-forward and drinkable. One of the ways it accomplishes this is by offering clean, focused hop tastes and aromas with a light malty backbone. The latter lets it down a bit, otherwise this beer would have earned a solid 4.0."

"I'm not a fan of this ale. I kept getting this tasted of body odor while drinking it. It looked nice in the glass- a pretty amber color with carbon bubbles rising. Interestingly it didn't smell of body odor; it has a sweet hoppy aroma. The mouthfeel was kind of thin. I just cannot get over the body odor flavor to it. I poured it into a glass to let it breathe thinking that the BO like flavor was from bottle skunk but the flavor didn't change much. I would not recommed this ale to anyone."
""
""
""
"Toasted grains lead off, quickly followed by piny, resinous hop bitterness. Biscuit and light fruit malt fill in. Resin and citrus hop bitterness into the dryer finish. Lingering caramel, orange citrus and leafy hops. Moderate body with a smooth feel. Decent pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, a decent brew. more hoppy than i prefer, but i can see its finer points. still trying to get into the hoppier brews and understand them. guess i'm just a 'traditionalist' (?) and subscribe to the maltier recipes i became accustomed to when i though germany was the world of beer."

"O: This is a very drinkable pale ale that has interesting aromas and flavors imparted by the Nelson Sauvin hops. There is a good balance between the malt and hops because you can taste the hop flavors but these aren’t accompanied by a strong bitterness like an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ya know, if this beer had blew me away, I would do the whole ASTMO thing and spend more time on it. But, it WAS a pleasant surprise. I love their spiced ipa, and was skeptical to try this PA (cause I often stick to IPA's), but it was good. Citrus-y."
""
""
""
""
""
"If you think about downing a sixer in an afternoon, this could be the beer with which to do it."
""
""
"I'm sure it could be because it was a gorgeous summer day, but from the second I sat down behind this beer, I was happy. It tasted like a straight, down-the-middle pale ale should. Malty, the right amount of hops, some foam. The color was bubbly amber. I enjoyed this beer deeply, and could easily have spent the day happily drinking them. No tricks or surprises here, just a hands-down easy-going happy-drinking pale ale. I can't wait to have another."

"Amber with an etched white surface and excellent clarity. No lace. Smells herbal with a slight resin character and a bit of canned spinach alongside the crystal malt which is sweet but not overplayed. Slightly bitter with a good moderated malt through the center and a fine overall pale character. Nice and limited body with slightly low carb and an off dry finish. Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very mediocre, yet very sessionable pale ale here. Pours to medium amber with exceptional clarity. Nice fruity-herbal smell with minimal alcohol. Taste is clean and crisp - this would be an excellent, not-heavy amber for a hot summer evening. It's just another beer, but if the price is right, I'll pick it up again..."
""

"had a sale on sixers of drifter - $4.99! excellent at that price, but i'll put that aside for the moment. drifter pours an orange-ish copper color with a white head that leaves a little lacing clinging to the side of my pint glass. aroma is citrus, some pacific pine notes in there too from the summit and nelson hops. very quaffable, with a light body across the palate. pretty well balanced with the caramel malts and hops each making themselves known. finishes a touch on the sweeter side, but still has that west coast pale ale hop presence. a fine session beer that isn't a game-changer, yet will satisfy enthusiasts and novices alike."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nicely balanced and crisp pale ale. Good hop and malt balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An overly sweet and uninteresting pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fruity notes on the nose such as orange peel, apricot and various spices. Also, has a grassy aroma with a slight biscuity tone. Taste follows closely behind. Cracked pepper and a semi hoppy backbone. Tropical fruits remind you of the style. Close to a california Pale Ale, but not quite. Medium bodied with a good kick of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this was a good beer. There was nothing that made it stand out, but it was still very good and would make me want to have this any time or any place."
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours copper in color with a thin beige head that leaves no lacing on the glass. Aromas are fruity and sweet with floral hops and caramel malt. Tastes are similar to aromas - fruity, overly sweet caramel maltiness, still floral and refreshing. Thin body and low carbonation, but smooth. Overall, nice meld of flavors, but could have used a bit more bitterness to balance out the sweetness. Still pretty good though, altough I wouldn't seek it out again."
""
""
"It was decent. I will definitely still grab some bottles if I ever find some."
"O: Not remarkable but not at all bad. Balanced drinkable pale ale. Can't say I wouldn't drink it again but would most likely shoot for something a little more impressive when I am buying."
"Pale ale color that I expect. Strong head with good lacing that stays with the glass. The smell is pleasant, with citrus notes. The taste is good, but not impressive. Flavor I expect from a Pale Ale. Appropriate balance and bitterness. Good floral notes that match the smell. The mouthfeel is clean, lightly carbonated. Strong overall beer. If I found it on tap on a pale ale kind of night, and there was no Summit EPA available, I'd order it."
"Pours a clear copper-amber with nearly no head at all. Very little lacing around the edges of the glass. The bouquet is characterized by sweet lemon, almost Pledge-like. There's a mild sting in the nasal passages that has a piggybacking aroma that is difficult to distinguish. A very nice, pleasing, balanced mouthfeel. Beef jerky and buttermilk flavors compete with a little tart citrus. Not a magnificent beer, but certainly a better effort than their lifeless hefeweizen."
""
"Not stellar but an easy going darker pale ale."
"Love the grapefruit. Very clean citrus flavors. Nice graham cracker-like malt adds good balance. Light bodied and very session-able."
""
"It felt a little heavy for its appearance. It had a touch of citrus and a bready base. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't chose it over something else."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice well balanced very drinkable pale ale. The flavours are fairly subdued, but they are good. I wouldn't pick this one up again, but I wouldn't turn it away if offered. There are just too many better beers out there."
"Pretty sure this was my first Widmer Bros brew. Pretty sure it won't be my last."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A very approachable, very drinkable pale ale. What it lacks in bold or complex flavors, it makes for in a smooth, velvety texture and great balance. Session friendly. One of the better Widmer beers I've had."
""

"Five different malts and four different hop varieties give this beer its unique flavor. The beer pours a amber color with about 1 fingers worth of an off white head that leaves nice lacing. Aromas of fresh picked oranges, lemons and tangerines shine through. The taste is equally delicious with a well blended malt to hop ratio with very little bitterness. Nice light mouth feel."
""
""
""
"Pours brilliant bright amber with very little initial or resulting foam. Sharp malt smell, lighter grassiness, some citrus. Bready taste, very mild hop keeps some sweetness in check. Touch of caramel. Mild carbonation keeps the smooth feeling. Subtle pale, good beer."
""
"O/D-Pleasantly surprised as I asked for a glass without being able to see the name of the beer. Just knew I hadn't tried it and was happy with the results. A pretty legitimate APA. Would have it again."
"A great thirst-slacker for summer time fun. For that reason I will use that vernacular. The color was sunny, and head followed the tide of beer as it ran up the side of my glass. OK lacing. The smell is what first caught my attention. It slapped my nose with demanding floral scents as soon as the seal was broken. The taste was mediocre but not exceptional. My mouth enjoyed the refreshing sensation but seemed thin on flavor. Overall way better than your average pale ale."
""
""
""
""
"O- love it, always have. My solid go to beer anytime. Will be drinking this stuff forever. Get some! Love to Widmer"
""
"D- finding a positive point, it's easily drinkable and refreshing due to the lack of flavor. the remainder of this bottle will go into a foil packet to keep a brisket moist while I reheat it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty freakin' good pale ale from one of those ""sellout"" breweries. Widmer makes some good stuff and don't discount them just because they are owned by a bigger company. Give this one a shot if you have the chance."
""
""
""
"Poured from brown 12oz bottle to pint glass the beer is a translucent lighter amber/copper color with a nice 1 finger head, some retention and lacing. A nice citrus nose with hints of grapefruit, orange, tangerine and a hint of piney resin. A light malt background. The taste again begins with a nice citrus character, mild bitterness, sweet crystal malt flavors. Finishes clean and crisp with a lingering citrus bitterness. Nice. Very approachable and drinkable, on the old drinkability score this beer would shine. Lighter bodied with good carbonation. Overall, a good APA. Perfect for a summer day, would be easy to put several down in a sitting."

""

"This is a well hopped, balanced, sessionable, enjoyable beer. In the APA category in my opinion it is among the most refreshing and drinkable."
""
""
""
"O-One of my favorite Pales. The hop character of this beer is its best feature, the smell starts you off just right!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Delicious scene and taste. Not the best at anything and but above average on everything. Definitely among my favorite pale ale's."

"1, 2, 3 ""simple"" good beer."
""
""
""
"o. when i first discovered this several months ago, it immediately became my favorite pale ale. with flying dog and bass in the same conversation, it yet remains my favorite."
"O: Pretty decent malt forward APA. Not the best, but I wouldn't turn it down if another was offered to me."
""
""
"D- Overall, a drinkable Pale Ale I can see going well with food. I'd like to have this again, definitely with a fresh bottle (maybe in portland)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This APA maintains a good amount of pungent bitterness without going overboard; very quaffable and enjoyable."
""
""
"A very ""different"" tasting beer which is well-balanced and a true delight to drink. Wish I'd received more than a six pack, and will definitely look forward to tracking down more..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is rich for an APA and crisp. Drinkability is very good, crisp and tasty, a good candidate for a session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice pale ale...quite drinkable and very flavorful. Should satisfy the hop lovers out there. Should make it into my rotation of daily drinkers."
""
""
"overall: this beer is pretty average."
"I was in Jacksonville and tried the Drifter Pale Ale at Miller Ale House. A very good pale ale. Pours a copper colored body with an off-white head with good retention. Aromas are a bit atypical from what I'd expect from an APA, but I like them: I get a lot of pineapple and grapefruit notes from the hops with caramel maltiness playing a less pronounced role. These flavors define its taste as well, but the caramel malts are more prominent, making for a well-balanced beer. Well done, Widmer."
"Moderate carbonation with a nice crisp finish. Overall an incredibly fresh, well-balanced, and interesting beer. This one went down fast! Will definitely drink again, and will likely become a fridge staple."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer didn't blow me away or change my drinking worldview. However, it did offer a very pleasant drinking experience. If I found one in my friend's fridge, I'd certainly give it a whirl, but wouldn't purchase one myself."

"Honestly, this must be my favourite straight-up pale ale these days. It's crisp, has a good amount of bitterness (but not super hoppy...though I like that), has a good bite and no nasty aftertaste at all. I had a few flavours of Widmer's when I was down in Oregon a month ago and everything I tried from this brewery was delicious. I'd definitely recommend - I just hope I can find it in my neck of the woods again some time soon!"
""
""
""
""
"I was really surprised when I first tried this one because I wasn't much of a Widmer fan. After tasting some of their other offerings I've come to realize they've stepped up their game, starting with the Drifter Pale Ale. This would be a great beer to introduce a beer noob to the awesomeness that is hops. It's not too bitter, but the hops are definitely in the nose, which is how I got into hops myself. Although this isn't a remarkable beer, something is to be said about its balance and drinkability. A solid go-to beer, I think this beer could easily stand up to be Widmer's flagship."
"In sum, I found this to be a highly drinkable and satisfactory beer."
"O - Very drinkable pale ale. After drinking the latest christmas/winter offerings it's great to try something opposite. Citrus notes all around but lacks in carbonation"
"Overall: This is actually a good APA that I can see myself drinking from time to time. Will have to thank a buddy for leaving this treat in the fridge. Will have to invite him over more often for Sunday football."
"A very good pale ale. Pours a copper colored body with an off-white head with good retention. Aromas are a bit atypical from what I'd expect from an APA, but I like them: I get a lot of pineapple and grapefruit notes from the hops with caramel maltiness playing a less pronounced role. These flavors define its taste as well, but the caramel malts are more prominent, making for a well-balanced beer. Well done, Widmer."
"Overall: Highly drinkable, well made, classic example of style, enjoyable."
"Overall: an average pale ale without many memorable aspects to it. Very refreshing for a pale ale"
"Overall this is a great beer for its price. I was leery of it because it's attached to Widmer. But this may be one of the best affordable beers I've had. Very nice."
"O: Fine enough for what it was, but I won't be reaching for it any time soon..."
"A Pale Ale that I could drink every day."
"The feel of this beer is pretty smooth and is easy going down. It has a great drinkable feel with a good amount of carbonation."
"Wow! Widmer has done it again! This is by far the best IPA I have tried in a while. Upon first pour I noticed it smelled sweeter than average IPA. It poured a nice golden color, has minimal foam and carbonation. It has a sweeter taste and great aroma. This is a superb beer."
"Sweet! I getta review after the lil white mouse. I like. Pint glass pour and I am met with a copper/amber colored ale with a beige foamy head. Slight lacing. The aroma has a nice pineapple and grapefruit combo. The grapefruit really starts shining through as it warms. The taste has a mouthfeel of hops and a very light grapefruit aftertaste. Malt backbone is definitely there. Dry and spicy finish. The mouthfeel is very watery which is disappointing....but a lot of carbonation going on too. Overall I was expecting more from this brew and it didn't live up to my high hopes. A nice Pale Ale for those wanting to get into the style though. Just not my cup o' tea."
"Quite disappointed in this. Of course, the extra Nelson Sauvin addition raised my hopes, but there wasn't a lot to it. Drinkable in its way, but drinkable in the generic way that most beer is."
"Really a nice palatable beer that a child could suck down."
"O: It's okay. I guess I like it. I wouldn't recommend one, but I'd have another. Characterised by its 'sweetishness'."
"Pours an orange-copper-gold with a dense tan head with a yellowish cast. Medium carbonation. Stunning citrusy orange-grapefruit-lemon-passion fruit and pine aroma. Could sniff this one all day. Good malt with pine wood taste. Dryish finish. Exceptional aroma carries the day here."
"Medium carbonation. Somewhat one dimensional though not boring. I actually thought it was pretty enjoyable and refreshing. I really like the tap handle too!"
"I need to try this again but I need to be sure that it is freshers."
"Seems like Widmer has been stepping their game up the last few years and this is a great example of how they got it right in making an APA. The hops are there but so well melded into the malt profile that you want another one before you have finished the first. I really see this beer developing into a PNW classic like Deschutes Mirror Pond . Complex yet drinkable to the tenth degree."
"Great pale ale. I'll certainly pay my roommate for the one I stole. Mmm."
"D- I find this to be a very pleasant pale ale. Check it out. I wish I had more of these and would consider buying them again. Lots of hop flavor opposed to just bitterness and it is balanced quite nicely."
"O - not a lot of complexity but nice and refreshing"
"O - A very surprising beer for me, starting from the pour all the way to the last sips. I was expecting an average overhopped APA, but I thoroughly enjoyed this not so pale pale ale."
"At 5.7% this beer is kinda like SN Torpedo little brother. It's a great session beer for a hop head that won't disapoint."
"Widmer beers vary a good deal in my opinion and this is my least favorite of all of their offerings that I've tried. I'm not sure why it's so popular. If they'd completely change up the hop it might be a nice beer but the hop if pretty forward and pretty off-putting."
"D - This is a very refreshing beer, nothing is over the top, everything is balanced into a very enjoyable brew."
"This beer is refreshing. It's light mouthfeel and strong citrus notes make it the perfect beer to reach for after a hot day and it's a refreshing change of pace from the deluge of textbook, less than inspiring pale ales on the market. All in all, a very satisfying brew that I will continue to come back to (Especially if I discover a place to buy it in New Mexico)."
"This is an enjoyable and refreshing ale that drinks quite sessionable despite its 5.7 ABV. I look forward to trying other selections from this brewery."
"Dr: Easy drinking for one or two bottles, but beyond that it suffers from those damned bittering hops. It's overpriced - especially for the quality."
"Pours a clear amber with a 1 inch tan head that settles to an oily film on the top of the beer. Foamy thin rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grapefruit and citrus zest hops and some malt notes. Taste is of grapefruit, citrus zest, with a sweet malt finish. Very mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. A lower level of carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good, easy drinking APA from Widmer."
"Overall - Awesome APA reminds me of Dale's with the heavy focus on the malts. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"I go to Portland, OR about twice a year, and whenever I decide to go out, this is the beer that I choose whenever I want a steady night of the same beer. It is dependable, surprisingly complex and flavorful, and I just do not get sick of it. The fruity/citrusy undertones complement the hops well without being overbearing or getting into anything novelty. This is a reliable beer that I will love until the day I die. The ambiance of green Portland is captured in this beer. There will never be another Drifter."
"Cheers!"
"its not something to brag home about, just an overall great brew for the style!"
"Fine and likeable, this is a superb session-worthy pale ale."
"12oz. bottle served at 53 degrees in my SA Perfect Pint. Apr 25 11 indicated on the label. Pours a translucent amber with a half inch, frothy, off-white head that dissipates into a fairly consistent skim. Some spots and strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses caramel malt, a faint citrus character and perhaps a trace of earthy hops towards the back. Malt is much less pronounced in the flavor profile and citrus intersperses throughout. Earthy bitterness comes out at the finish and gradually dissipates between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a crisp carbonation that leaves some residual tingles on the roof of the mouth. There's also a slight acidity and a light oiliness to the texture. Overall, a fairly drinkable and accessible APA."
"It’s pretty good for American Pale Ale."
"O: A good west coast Pale Ale, in the SNPA, Drake's and Red Chair tradition. Not the most balanced beer. On sale every couple of months around here, and I'm always good for six."
"Would definitely order this beer again. Probably wont seek it out, but will not have any issue of buying it in the future."
"Overall, the beer impresses."
"Not a bad pale ale overall. Definitely on the above average side of a pale ale. That being said, I don’t see myself ever searching this beer out to try at a bar or at BevMo, but I’m glad I tried it."
"Bright copper with a radiant orange glow. The white head builds high, but falls to a thin wisp of lace. Subtle, but extremely complex and beautiful hop notes, including freshly squeezed grapefruit, lemon drop, melon, peach, and an undertone of pine. Malt is sturdy, but dry with mild caramel and a light graininess. Nice and clean on the back end. I can't believe I'm enjoying a Widmer beer this much, since I haven't been too impressed with their stuff up to this point. But Drifter has an extraordinarily unique, yet understated hop profile that makes it a pleasure. This is my second or third beer brewed with Nelson Sauvin hops and each time I become more enthralled with their delicate, yet uniquely flavorful character."
"overall: well hopped pale ale, has everything you need in a basic pale ale, very drinkable."
"Drifter is a very good pale. Different enough to stand out in a very crowded market but well within the realm of the style. The herbal component is nice, and the citrus notes are prominent. Light and ways to drink, befitting the style. Excellent effort."
"12oz bottle. Part of the Brothers' Best Variety Pack. Pours a translucent dark amber color with very little head. Some lacing. Spicy aroma of floral and citrus hops. Smells a bit sweet. Tastes basically how it smells. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be but still has some floral and citrus as well as some caramel flavor. Fair amount of malt flavor along with some sweetness. Slightly bitter at the end. Has an overall bready taste to it. This beer is alright in a mix pack but I wouldn't get it on its own."
"This beer pours a clear amber color with a trace of head that doesn't lace or retain well. The aroma is pretty fantastic with notes of citrus hops, as well as a little sweet malt. The taste starts with bready caramel malt characteristics and then finishes with citrus and grassy hops. The mouthfeel is balanced, but slightly empty. Overall a great pale ale."
"Appearance is a darker orange amber with a thin but steady head and fair lace. Smell of lightly sweet malt and floral citric hops. Taste has a good balance of the sweet malt and floral citric hops with a note of grapefruit and pine that finishes clean. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. What I would consider a hearty pale ale that goes down nicely."
"Taste-Faint citrus zest, toasted malt, subtle caramel, nice hop bite adds balance. Tasty and snappy, a very nice American Pale. Certainly worth a try."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce longneck bottle, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"M - flows nicely and pure feeling for the after"
"22oz glass of dark red goodness. Almost no head but a good ring around the glass makes me think it was just the pour. The aroma has a solid amount of caramel and sourdough but that is dominated by a large amount of orange citrus and grapefruit. I was expecting more malt in the flavor but I was overwhelmed with fruity hop flavors. A ton of grapefruit and orange, like the nose, but with a tasty combination of malt and hops that is fruity, tangy and sweet. This went down very smooth because of how tasty it was. Medium/light body with a juicy, thirst quenching finish."
"This beer is pretty blah. Not much malt flavor, not much hops other than bitterness that's also blah. Don't have a whole lot more to say about it."
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is a deep, auburn-copper color with a smooth, creamy white head. Decent lacing while you enjoy. The beer has a semi-sweet citrus and caramel aroma, with some floral notes. Light, sweet flavors, with very light spicing. Notes of lemon zest, caramel, and light hops. Peppery and tangy sweet aftertaste, with a spicy and astringent finish. Easy drinker, and great on a hot day."
"O-Drifter Pale Ale is overall a drinkable pale ale with an impressive aroma. The lighter body and carbonation makes one able to have more than one pint in a session. The beer could handle more hop bittering to secure it's place being called an ""American Pale Ale"" but with this being said it was definately enjoyable."
"O: Really a fine pale ale, and one of the better offerings from Widmer."
"PS, at $7.49 for a 6 pack it is also cheap."
"This is the only beer by Widmer that I really like... This to me is the perfect summer beer, so refreshing. It has a nice citrus, lychee fruit flavor that I really like. I just wish it had a little bit more hop bite to it.. not much though. When poured into a glass there isn't much head on it... all in all a good beer."
"Drifter Pale Ale has a creamy, off-white head, which would probably be thick and fluff,y had the barmaid poured it in a manner to build such a head (this was on draft). Lots of thick lacing rings are left down the pint glass. The aroma is initially almost nil, but as one drinks down the glass, the citrus and pine really show out. The taste is pleasantly hop forward, with strong citrus and piney aspects. Some say it has grapefruit taste in it, but I’m not sure I found that. There is a good bitter aftertaste with this. Mouthfeel is medium, and Drifter Pale Ale finishes mostly dry and has a relatively crisp finish. Overall, this is a very enjoyable and delicious beer. RJT"
"At a buck 49 this one is a no brainer - stock up."
"This is a great session pale ale. Looks bright and inviting, smells nice, tastes of more citrus hops than I was expecting. I was expecting a flat hop sort of taste without any bite, while this beer doesn't really have ""bite"" it is indeed very crisp and fruity. I really enjoyed it, and was pleasantly surprised. Great beer to have a lot of, and has definitely found a place on my ""go-to"" beer list."
"O: Very enjoyable beer, much better than I expected. This is not an in your face kind of beer. Goes down easy and ordered another without hesitation. Well worth a try."
"D - A very drinkable beer. Initially the grapefruit took me by surprise, but I warmed up to it. I would certainly try this one again, maybe from the bottle next time."
"O - decent beer, heavy on the hops, better overall when it warms and smooths out."
"o - Overall a little bland but easy to drink. A pretty average pale ale with some ncie fruit in the nose. Would give another shot."
"Pours a clear amber color with a medium off-white head that hangs around for a bit. Scent is very nice grapefruit and malt mixture with a bit of caramel malt. I'm really liking the nose on this. Taste is a bit maltier than most pale ales I've tried, but is quite delicious. Lots of grapefruit and pineapple flavors, much like an IPA, but lacking in the heavy hop presence. The hops are there and not overpowering, just like a nice APA should be. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit on the syrupy side. Drinkability is high. Overall, Widmer tends to impress me with this beer. A very tasty APA."
"Widmer Brothers Brewing Company, Ltd.--Widmer Brothers Drifter Pale Ale--2011 12 oz. Bottle. 5.70% ABV. 28 IBU’s. (4.25 / 5.0) No sediment. Foamy thin short lived mild quarter 1/4"" inch off white head. Very pretty rich bright thin dark amber color. Sweet floral citrus hop malty hint front.Mellow sweet slightly creamy doughy rich delicate toasted hint caramel minimal fruit rich malty Pale Ale body. Rich clean balanced mild hop spice nourishing end. Rich tasty hoppy Pale Ale. Excellent! Sampled 5/2/2011. Purchased 6-Pack for $6.99 at Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 5/2/2011."
"Pours a golden copper. Appears to be a highly carbonated beer from all the bubbles. Thin head and little lacing. The smell of ruby grapefruit mixes with malts. A small amount of grass notes. The taste is bitter to start then flows into a roasty malt finish. Very dry and full, chewy. A good starter pale ale that would be great to get new people into craft beer."
"O-A good pale ale. Not my favorite style of beer but i did enjoy drinking this beer"
"Beautifull clear copper with bright yellow/orange highlights. There is a thin off white foam. Tropical fruit, tangerine and a gentle boozyness. The smell is intoxicating! On the taste I get fresh orange that lingers with some pine and just minimal bitterness. The taste is so smooth and complex yet very refreshing. The mouthfeel is lightly dry. This is a very nice beer that is full of flavour, very easy to drink and just enough bitterness to keep it interesting. This is a perfect example of a hoppy Pale Ale. All the hops of an IPA but brewed for flavour and aroma over bitterness. Wonderful."
"D/O: This is an unremarkable pale ale that looks and smells better than it tastes. While it is inoffensive, it loses the attention of the drinker with every sip. It reminds of Boulevard's equally uninspired pale ale--drinkable, but not compelling."
"Just trust me on this one fellow B'as, this brew Fu$%# rocks...."
"Overall a solid beer. I was really happy with it. I wouldn't mind having this one again."
"Poured a cloudy amber with no real head and no significant lacing. Smell was very grainy, almost like cereal. Grassy and earthy tomes as well. Taste followed suit nicely. Hoppy but not citrusy, more of a grainy, grassy type of taste. Very mellow and different. Nice carbonation and easy drinkability make this another good brew"
"This was a decent APA from Widmer that drank very nicely for close to 6% ABV. I had no idea that they used Nelson Sauvin in this and I liked what it brought over; giving this a soft fruitiness that helped balanced the more aggressive aspects of those bittering hops. Nothing mind blowing here but this was crisp and flavorful enough to keep me happy."
"Pours a nice one finger head, it’s very see through though. The body is amber in color and it has lots of carbonation. It looks like a pale ale, but not quite as thick as I would like, it looks decent though. The smell is nice and hoppy with a little malt sweetness. It doesn’t smell like a weak pale ale at all, it smells legit. Yeah, nice hoppy flavor on the taste. Not too overwhelming, but good and hoppy with a nice malt balance on it. This beer is very drinkable, not too watery though. The mouthfeel could be a little bigger, but it’s not too bad. There really isn’t anything wrong with this beer at all. Overall a good pale ale!"
"Heavy orange color, almost amber and a very small head, maybe my glass wasn't clean enough. The smell is very subtle but sticky oranges, not bad. The taste is sweet citrus, a little bread, only a little bitterness on the finish. Overall, not a bad offering from wider brothers."
"Overall I was very surprised from this beer as I find most of the Widmer creations kind of bland and just average. This one gave a renewed faith for me in the brewery. Very nice beer for the season."
"My second of the Widmer beers and I so far have enjoyed them, the first of course was the ever so popular Widmer Hef, which isn't a favored style of mine. They're lighter beers aren't so complex they tend to lean to one flavor which makes the beer and in my opinion sort of unbalances it. My perfect example of a balanced APA/ARA is NBB's Fat Tire, a beer that even the BMC drinkers can respect. This is definitely a hop heads beer. Its an easy drinker, not to bitter, very fresh earthy feel, but nothing that makes it amazing-ergo- the score. I gave it 3.5 across the board, it came in a lovely sampler which I would pick up again however I could not see myself buying a six of this. Stay thirsty my friends?"
"Good mouthfeel. Overall, I like it and it was a decent value as part of a sampler 12 pack from this brewery."
"12oz bottle. Pours clear and copper colored, thin cap of foam. A hoppy pale ale aroma, a little citrus and maybe cat pee (just a little), some caramel malts beneath. Malty tasting, sweet and grainy, with some bread and grapefruit in equal measure, but not too much of either. Middle of the road flavors, not objectionable at all but not memorable either. Light bodied, fairly easy to quaff but nothing really stood out for me."
"Overall: I would call this a drinkable, mostly enjoyable APA. It's not bad, just standard. A mild but pleasing APA, it straddles into amber ale territory as it warms because of the lack of hop forwardness. Ho-hum."
"The liquid was an amber, copper color with a filmy, eggshell colored head that hugged the glass. The smell is mostly lemon, pepper and tabacco. It tastes just slightly bitter with some spicy, lemony hop accents. There is a hint of bubblegum and a bready finish. Feels pretty light and watery with lots of carbonation. This is a pretty average pale ale, still enjoyable though and I would drink it again."
"Overall, the smooth malt character of this APA makes it one you can drink a bit longer than others."
"Pours a nice brownish color (yet clear). Surprising for a pale ale (unless you count my home brew pale ales). Has a nice one finger creamy head with a sweet hops smell. Lots of bubbles, looks interesting. Taste is also unique for a pale ale. Not bad though. Has a fruity taste, but I'm not sure what fruit. Maybe apricot or something. Definitely not a tart citrus taste. This beer has a rounded, for lack of a better word, taste that makes it easy to drink. This is my second time drinking this one. I knew I thought it was decent, but couldn't remember much about it. It's pretty good overall. I may try it again some day."
"this beer was a very very pleasant surprise. The color is a beautiful golden brown. The smell is of grapefruit and floral citrus. The taste of drifter is a very interesting grapefruit combined with complex piney florals. All of this flavor is surprisingly smooth and drinkable. This was the first time I have ever had drifter pale ale but it won't be the last."
"This was my first experience with beverages from Widmer Brothers Brewing Company. Had a great grapefruit scent that carried through to the taste. Was crisp with good hop flavor. Nice amber coloring. Easy drinking and very enjoyable, could definitely have a few of these. Will be sure to look for it again."
"Feels like a totally reasonable session ale, but it's got to be the darkest maltiest pale ale I've had in a while. Too sweet for me."
"Had this at the Brew's Best Craft beer festival this weekend. It was my first taster of the day and was such a good choice. Fruity smell was the first thing I noticed. Crisp feel once it hits your mouth which is a delight on a warm day. Clean taste after you're finished, no lingering after-taste. Overall I would definitely pick this beer up again."
"Overall an exquisite tasting Pale Ale that left a very nice hoppy citrus flavor lingering, letting you really enjoy all aspects of this brew."
"Drinks very easy, wish I'd popped the top on this 3 or so weeks ago when I got this, although I may have found it too hoppy! Well done Widmer, will revisit this one again"
"The beer fills your mouth with a good level of carbonation and is pretty smooth . Overall, this beer goes down easy and fast and is very approachable. Recommended for Saturday afternoon on the porch. Enjoy responsibly."
"D - great but strong citrus flavor could interfear with some foods"
"Overall - mild bitterness for a pale ale. The malty taste nearly overrides the subtle citrus flavor. Very drinkable but not entirely memorable."
"A good beer, best one of the night, and one I went back for seconds of."
"Could drink this every day and be happy with it... although it really doesnt go well with food, in my opinion. Gonna keep this as a session beer. When i drank it with food it tasted like alcohol and rot."
"Not a bad little pale ale. Very drinkable with no notice of the 5.7% alcohol. I'd buy it again."
"D-Overall a very drinkable beer. Not exactly the best example of an APA but still a good beer nonetheless."
"Drinkability is good. This is an easy drinking and fairly tasty Pale Ale. Seems to be kind of British in taste with hoppy American aromas. I like this one. Nice offering Widmer."
"Drinkability - Another shocker, Drifter nets a 5.7% ABV. Thus leaving it on the higher end of a sessionable beer. But it drinks more like a beer at 5%. Overall, after tasting the beer at our local Beer School I immediately bought a full bottle at the bar. It's well worth trying if you can find it outside of the PacWest or New England area (thanks to the craft beer merger of Red Hook Brew and Widmer Brothers)."
"D: This is a great session beer, goes down way easy, smell and taste is very nice."
"D: Okay, I would not buy again or order another. Sort of good session beer."
"D: Move over, Sierra Nevada. Take a hike, Liberty Pale Ale. There's a new standard for American pale ales. I'm really happy to see Nelson Sauvin hops showcased in a mass-produced beer."
"Drinks great in every way. Definitely looking to buy this one on a regular basis. A fine tasting beer that I definitely recommend."
"Highly recommend"
"On tap at The Globe in Boston on XMas Eve procrastinating from shopping. This beer is a good diversion. Clear burnt orange color with reddish tints and thin white head. Decent lacing. Smells mainly pine. First sip was bad for some reason but rest was really good and kept getting better. Mild hops, resin, pine up front followed by refreshing mildly spicy (clove) citrus and apple. Excellent taste. Crisp smooth feel. Could go for a few but alas last minute shopping calls."
"Had this on tap at some dive bar in Vancouver, Washington. This was only craft on tap that I hadn't had, so figured I should try it out. This poured an amber-orange colour with thin white head, not too much lacing. Smells very mildly of hops, with some bread and caramel malt. Flavour is a bit bland for a pale ale, but there is nothing off about this. Medium-bodied carbonation. I could see drinking this if it was cheap, but I wouldn't seek this out again."
"If I could get over the fruit on the nose this would be sessionable."
"At 5.7% it is not bad to drink, but the taste is a show stopper"
"D- nothing to run out to buy but if someone handed me one I would drink it."
"All in all, I'd recommend this. It's a pretty good beer. Nothing that'll blow you away or anything, but a great looking, good tasting pale ale with mild biterness and high drinkability."
"Notes: A good level of hops, but not really bitter, much more sweet. Orange, grapefruit, and some tropical fruit along with caramel provide most of the flavor. I enjoyed it, but I don't know if I would search it out."
"Pours a dark amber color with a thick luxurious off white yellowish head and mountains of lacing left on the glass after each and every sip. When held to the light it shone ruby hues on the table at the bar. Smells of pineapple, grapefruit, other citrus peel/zest, hop aroma, and a faint sweetness. Tastes of subtle bitterness from the hops, strong grapefruit notes throughout, with a well blended balance of malts to round out the flavors. I also noticed pineapple and pine and a little grass in there. A very dry finish with biscuit notes dominated the ending of the brew. Mouthfeel was medium and somewhat creamy with a mild carbonation that gave the beer good life. Drinkability is very high. I really enjoyed the beer."
"D-it goes down easily due to the lightness but the tastes just are not something you want a lot of."
"Aftertaste remains clean and fresh. Wonderful session type brew for a hot afternoon, albiet a bit strong in ABV to really session more than a couple."
"Overall, this is a good beer. It is refreshing, easy to drink, and tasty. If it wasn't for the alcohol in this beer, it would be a great replacement for water and soft drinks."
"D - It's refreshing and sessionable. It's crisp and smooth to drink. Although it's a pale ale, it really has no true bitterness substance to it."
"Had on tap at Galvin's in Georgetown, KY. Didn't see it being poured, but arrived with little head. Much of the glass was covered with lacing as I drank it, though. Beer is a transparent copper, way more transparent than ale usually is. Smells just like sweet grapefruit. Tastes just like sweet grapefruit. So much so that I can't even bring myself to find other flavors or scents. Drifter is very crisp and satisfying to drink, I could have had two or three more pints."
"Pours a transparent copper color with very little head, I tried to pour aggressively, but couldn't get much more than a quarter inch that quickly dissipated. I can smell some fruit as well as a little malt. The taste was where this one fell short for me. Its a little stronger on the malt side, and I am getting a fruity taste I don't like. (I usually enjoy a little fruityness in the background of a beer, but this was odd) The aftertaste wasn't very pleasing either. Mouthfeel was fine, just how a pale ale should be. Meduim/light body with medium carbonation. Overall, I love Widmer, but there are other Pale Ales that I have access to that I enjoy more, this one was only average to me."
"Pours copper colored with a light white head and some sticky lacing. The nose is surprisingly quite bright with some fairly heavy citrus notes and a bit of caramel. The taste is similar with some hoppy citrus flavors coming through as well as a bit of pine. Some caramel and bread in the background. Not much bitterness in the mouthfeel; the hops are definitely more there in the flavor and aroma departments. Drinks fairly well and while not nearly my favorite, it's something that more and more is becoming the best option at a lot of places."
"d- this is an average pale ale, nothing sticks out as being really great, i wouldn't seek this one out."
"This is an interesting beer. It pours a dynamic, clear copper color with no head. It's aroma is an odd mix of vanilla, pine, biscuits, and some other stuff. It's very strange. The flavor again is odd with molasses, licorice, and metallic notes. This beer has a light mouthfeel with a light alcohol warmth. Original Drifter Pale Ale could be a session beer for some. It was just ok with Mexican food. Slightly recommended."
"All in all this is an exceptional american pale ale, and it's cheap too! For the 7 bucks a six-pack I can find this for locally, it's a no brainer. It's probably not quite as good as Sierra Nevada, but it's still great if you want a little more citrus in your pale ale. As it is it's a wonderful warm-up beer for a great session."
"D: Very drinkable and smooth could drink a few of these easy!"
"DB- Sessionable flavor. Not very bitter or tiring. I have had this one a few times and am still satisfied by it. Refreshing and nicely priced."
"Drinkability: very very drinkable enjoy a lot drank out of a pint glass."
"Thin white head but with good retention and lots of big, popping bubbles, not much lacing. Red copper color just deep enough to hold your gaze and get past transparency, nice fade to burnt orange hues along the rims. Admirable mix of pink and white grapefruit in the nose, floral with chamomile tea notes, spoonful of pine sap, no herbaceous nor ultra-sweet elements, stays within itself and on message, you could sniff it for some time. Medium-bodied, however, most of it is palate pressure and a sense of marching forward rather than flavor. The grapefruit and tangerine citrus starts things off well, after that there's momentary pine, green hay, wet stone aspects. But after that it's evanescence leads to homogeneity. Credibly, the carbonation ratchets it down to fit the body profile. It's drinkable enough for a bottle or two before your mind starts to wander. If the palate could match the nose, that would be something."
"Good call on making this one a year-round beer from the get-go--a lovely beer to be had. Looks like Widmer was trying to raise their own bar and accomplished that task."
"I like very much the exotic fruitiness, but the hops don't quite keep up in the end. I could see the herbal sweetness becoming tiring after a few rounds."
"This beer is more amber color than the Drop Top Widmer makes. Good lacing(drinking it in a pint glass right now). Minimal carbonation, very thin head and there is hardly any citrus taste to me and my brother(we are rating this as we speak).. My brother says( IT'LL GETCHA DRUNK)!!!! LOL... Anyways we like this better than the other Widmer product... I would definatly buy this one again!!!"
"Pretty blah. Can't recommend much at all. It passes the lips credulously enough. More than that? Not."
"Taste, good hop crispness, it does degrade at times into a woody mouthfeel, haven't been able to tell whether due to age or not. A warm up for hopheads and fans of good warm weather beer. Seen the price vary wildly for this, but is a good deal @ $7 I would say for a 6 pack."
"Drinkability is very good. Refreshing and tasty."
"HIGHLY recommended!"
"T- Sure enough, the caramel definitely comes through. It has a hoppy bitterness to it. But I don't know. It lacks a little something. Maybe more of a floral taste would've been nice. The sweet and hops aren't mixing for me. Not bad. I'd like to try again."
"D- This beer is very drinkable, for all. It serves a purpose. It is a well done American Pale Ale, that would do very well at a function, or just to have around during the summer. Its enjoyable, especially those fun caramel notes."
"D: I finished it, but moved on to other selections after the first one. Maybe this would be a good beer to have in the fall or winter, but on a hot summer day, I needed something with more bitterness or less caramel."
"D- A very nice beer to satisfy a person's thirst....I personally don't think I'd drink it all night though. It's a very nice patio beer and I think that it would do well with a salad dressed with a tart vinaigrette! The acidity and bitterness would also help balance out a spicier dish. A very good example of this style!"
"Clear amber body, prolific amount of carbonation rising from bottom of glass. One finger white head, creamy, slow dissipation with significant lacing. Hop forward aroma, some citrus and floral notes, bready malts more noticeable than caramel, pretty dry nose. Medium full mouthfeel, good effervescence. Taste is a bit sweeter than the nose would appear, hops are floral, grassy with minimal bitterness in finish. Not my favorite APA, but a nice hoppy interpretation. Pretty drinkable. Worth a try."
"Overall, Drifter Pale Ale is an easy to drink, yet tasteful APA. This is a nice starter beer for someone who has yet to try this style. Its mild bitterness allows for easy consumption, unlike some of the hop bombs that are produced by other craft brewers."
"Drinkability: A pretty enjoyable APA. It's not the most flavorful out there but it has a unique citrus flavor to it that's very appealing. The bitterness is pretty mild which makes this very drinkable. Definitely worth a try."
"Bottle found at a princess lunch at disney world epcot center. Pours a golden orange with good head that fades quickly and leaves a small lac. Excellent hop aroma. Taste is juicy grapefruit upfront followed by a mild maltiness. Hops are not biting in the least. A very easy drinking pale yet has plenty of hops flavor"
"The smell of this beer is really attractive. I generally hesitate buying beer from the left coast(being from the right) but wanted to try a number of new ales. I'm glad I did. I have many friends who, despite my best efforts, drink right from the bottle. Shame on them as they would be missing a great asset of this brew."
"Distinct grapefruit/citrus aroma. Smooth/rich body with a medium amount of malt. Tastes just as it smells. The grapefruit/citrus flavor is evident, but well done. Nice sweetness. Finishes with a taste of citrus hops. Very good American Pale Ale, although a little light on the hops."
"12-oz bottle. Clear amber color. Light airy head. Marked citrus aroma with some floral notes. Light body. Medium sweetness up front. Some tanic notes. A dry slightly astringent finish. Interesting but the metallic side notes take too much away from this beer. Needs a food pairing to complement the finish, but I see that as a negative."
"D - This is very good stuff, unjustly maligned or underappreciated. Every time I've had it on-tap, I've been very pleased."
"Drinkability: A very nice, middle-of-the-road APA that adds some interesting elements while not risking accessibility"
"The flavor mirrors the aroma. Again, predominate hop covers up most of the malt. It leaves a long lasting aftertaste of citrusy bitterness. Relatively thin for the style. Certainly a pleasant, if hoppy, brew."
"I wouldn't want to drink much of this because I think it is inferior to other easily obtainable Pale Ales. That said, it does go down as easily."
"At $2 less per sixer than some of the bigger guys I would Widmer has a hit a home run with this. Sure it isn't the best in it's class but it is a damn fine beer especially for the price. Heck it is a fine beer even without the price."
"D: A light and refreshing brew. Easily drinkable and one of its strongest attributes. Would gladly sip another."
"D - This is a great tasting APA. Great citrus flavor from the hops."
"just ok. pretty average but certainly not bad. almost a lawn mower APA. one could pound these back pretty easily on a warm day."
"Drinkability: Overall, this is a decent beer. I'd have it again, but there are many better options before it."
"It was creamy and the citrus could be picked up in the taste. Surprisingly with the citrus character there was no tartness. More sweet, not bitter or dry."
"D: A pretty solid APA. Nothing phenomenal, but definitely not a bad one. For the price, this is a good, easy drinking pale ale. I'll buy it again."
"Even allowing for the style, the hopping was sub-par and muted to the point that the malt competed for dominance in the flavor profile. Mild caramel malt with equally mild, slightly fruity hops. Finish was clean with slight astringency. While this would certainly make a more than acceptable lake or lawnmower beer, on the pale ale scale it ... well, .... pales."
"This is definitely good for a summer night but the taste was a little too muted for me. I'll have to try it on tap sometime if I see it."
"I hadn't heard of this beer when I snuck out for a nice lunch at Lir with the missus (pretty decent food too). Every beer was fairly common/decent and I hadn't been aware of this Widmer offering before. The pint came thankfully not pre-chilled, a nice dark russet with thin lilght brown head and very little lace thereafter. The aroma was a fruity roasted malt with a hint of lemon. The flavor likewise was a fruitier Bass Ale, not much in the hops leaning towards a maltier ale. the carbonation seemed a bit low, and the mouthfeel was slick with a bit of a syrupy aftertaste. I'd try this again, maybe with a better pour, as it seems to have potential..."
"Pours a nice semi-transparent mahogany with a decent pale beige head. Aroma is strongly hoppy and almost evergreen. Flavor is hoppy, slightly spicy and slightly floral with a subtle undertone of sweet apple. Smooth, lively, fizzy texture leaves a fruity and hoppy finish."
"D: I've never been a big fan of this, it's decent, but won't drink it unless there are no other options. However, it's easy to put down and tastes pretty good, so if you like it, got for it."
"Drinkability - This was OK to drink but it really lacked substance."
"Bottle smell nice and hoppy. Smells like tangy citrus, grapefruit on top of a nice malty base. Pours to a translucent pale golden brown with a nice head. Taste is also good and hoppy with a nice hop bite. The hop bite is more sweet that bitter, almost floral like a chardonnay wine, or dandelions, quite different. Mouthfeel is good and carbonated but not overly so. Over all a very good beer al the way around, excepting for the rare hopping, just not bitter enough for my tastes."
"drinkability - smooth, decent flavor, easy to drink"
"D - A Very nice pale ale. Not my favorite but very nicely crafted."
"Drifter is a nice smooth drinking beer, it may not become an everyday beer for me, it's a bit on the citrusy side, but I'm glad I bought and my wife and I will have no trouble whatsoever polishing off the six pack. Recomended"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a gas colored concoction with no head what so ever. The beer had a bit of a caramel smell. The beer was flat tasting and looking and I thought terrible. Then I discovered it was a year old by the brewed on date. I took the 6-pack back to Food Lion and got a refund. I am also sending Widmer Brothers Brewing a note explaining the ordeal."
"nice surprise after their hefe"
"Taste is a lot of dough, a bit yeasty with light, juicy orange, yeast, hints of dried herbs and hay. It is very balanced in sweetness ans bitterness, hop and malt character, but not weak in any element. It is very drinkable and has a faint, subdued English quality to it."
"D- This was a alright pale. Nothing at all that I would really want to try again. It was good for one beer but left me hanging for something that has a little more flavor to it. I take that back...something with a little more balanced flavor to it."
"I like this beer a lot. If it's a hot day on the beach, or a barbecue, or whatever, this is an awesome beer to make your taste buds rejoice."
"Ordered several and will be looking for six paks at my local Friar Tucks."
"Great atmosphere. Appearance is maybe a bit above average, nothing to write home about. Nose is great though. Full and floral, but not overly sweet. Flavor is full, robust, and has really strong outstanding components; but nothing overwhelms anything else making for great balance. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"D: It's not an amazing, life-changing beer, but it's definitely worth a try if you like a good pale."
"D- decent enough, but it'll likely fall into the every-now-and-then status I've seen from Widmer thus far. a good sessionable brew, nothing more, but then again, it doesn't need to be"
"It has a little odd soapy taste in the finish but not enough to turn me off. Overall a nice APA. I will try again for sure."
"(This was a very fresh bottle, I plan on trying this beer again for a re-review )"
"Con: Has a great lack of full body."
"A really nice beer, has an almost wine like character to it, probably due to the Nelson Sauvin hops. Bitterness is pretty low but the hop taste comes through nicely. A solid APA. A solid beer, reminds me a lot of SNPA, very similar flavors."
"This beer falls somewhere just on the weak side of IPA. The hops are prominent and somewhat bitter but don't linger long leaving the ambient citrus background wanting. A refreshing beer suitable for a mid-week lunch break."
"D-This is very drinkable and is frequently on sale for $1.00 a 12 oz. bottle which makes it a very good value."
"Bottle: Poured a light golden color ale with a small foamy head with good retention and not much lacing. Aroma of light citrus hops with nice mango ester. Taste is a nice mix between some citrusy hops with nice mango notes and a light caramel backbone. Body is about average with good carbonation. Very well done with nice mango ester and well balanced sweetness."
"- the hop bitterness doesn't blend well with the overall taste."
"d - decent offering but not a great APA."
"D: Drifter makes for a nice session brew. It's pretty mellow overall, and not too terribly complex. But it does its job in a very workman like manner. It's not a beer I'd seek out, but I wouldn't ever turn it down."
"A pretty unique APA. Taste is very light and unassuming. Faint, but pleasant citrus and light maltiness. A bit of a metallic taste that I get in some APAs. Its almost like I'm not drinking beer, but its still somehow good. This beer goes down like a hooker on death row after she found out that she was pardoned and can start being a hooker again."
"Drinkability - Not overly crisp and no bitter bite but a lingering flavor. So, nothing stellar and nothing bad - Enjoyable!"
"in a sense, this is an intensely hoppy pale (not a IPA?) that is everything except bitter. weird, but i'd sit down with these for an evening."
"D: this will be my beer for the weekend at bw3's"
"Decent pale ale, nothing spectacular."
"D: A really good APA with solid malt backbone and a unique hop profile which provides big flavor. This would be an exceptional session brew."
"Very solid start with a hoppy but mellow pine and citrus tongue and crisp texture that unfortunately gives way in the finish to a bit of a malty muddle. The texture likewise starts crisp but doesn't finish as strong. Still, the overall product is decent if not spectacular. i wouldn't turn this down if offered."
"Pleasantly drinkable and spot on for style."
"Terrific beer! Very easy drinking. No tough overly candied or bitter aftertaste. Smooth, pleasant, and drinkable. Needs a bit more intensity to be great, but pretty close. Loved it."
"Pours a beautiful, deep copper in color. Lots of head on this bad boy, with very soapy, sticky lacing on the glass. Smell is of really light fruit aromas, not your big IPA or APA malt forward aromas and hoppy overtones, but a very subtle showing of some passionfruit. Taste is on point, I get almost a peach-like tinge that overtakes the palate, followed by a decent amount of some citrus from the hops. Malt backbone is light enough to let the hops dance around on the tongue. Great mouthfeel on this, a bit slick and wet, yet holds up on the tongue smoothly with decent carbonation and bitterness. Overall, a valiant effort from the Widmer Brothers and one of the better APA's out there. Even my girlfriend wanted more Drfiter. Recommended!"
"Drinkability: this is a pretty solid beer and I wouldn't mind having another one after this."
"A good pale ale. The ""bite"" is grapefruity but not too harsh like some. I bought it as part of a sampler pack at my local Hy-Vee liquor store... purely on a whim. Probably mellow enough to enjoy at dinner, yet quite drinkable if you're trying to get a little tipsy."
"Pours a surprisingly reddish amber with a thin but satisfying head that drops a little too fast, but does leave good lacing. The aroma is pleasantly hoppy - strong with grapefruity hops. The flavor is even more grapefruity, with a sweet, almost candy-like finish. Bitterness is muted both on the tongue and on the finish, though there is a little citrus-like bitterness, like the oil on an orange rind. The mouthfeel is insubstantial, which is the one clear flaw in what is otherwise quite good."
"I drink these between the more spendy beers in my cellar (victory storm king, bells expedition stout, founders breakfast stout...). Widmers Bros (aka Brewmasters Bros : ) have created a niche - bringing an excellent beer to the masses while keeping cost down. Bravo!"
"Also, the label is very cool. The selling point of this beer to me when I first saw it. Very well designed."
"My first experience with the Widmer Bros. seemed less than enjoyable, but they have obviously redeemed themselves and are making higher quality beers!"
"Aroma, and the flavor follows suit, seems a nice combination of biscuity malts and grassy hops, although nothing special. Bitterness is minimal, but this was quite refreshing on an extremely hot day."
"D- Easy to drink, very tasty."
"Drinkability is pretty high if you like citrus hop flavor, a real nicely balanced, tasty Pale Ale from Widmer."
"my beer ratings are kind of dull. either i like the beer or i didn't . so i am still new to this and not that picky with the ratings. LIke here I gave all 4's becuase i liked it. I guess i could of varied it with a 4.5 here or there but oh well.. wow i keep needing to write more on these things jeez.. isn't it enough already ??"
"Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy, and the carbonation fades fast. The beer is easily drinkable. Definitely a laid back brew that will go with just about anything. Unexceptional, though that can be a good thing if you're not looking to overwhelm your tastebuds."
"pours a medium to light amber /orange color with a thin head and little lacing.. smell is pine and grass and grapefruit wth some sweet malts all on the slight side taste is fainter then the smell im not wowed with this pale ale from the color to the pour and taste its on the light side the hop profile is light... there are so many ipas and pale ales out there that this one just gets lost for me on the flavor and drinkability..its just a bit above average"
"D: A nice session beer."
"Drinkability: A decent flavorful American Pale Ale. Would definitely seek this out and drink it again."
"Dark cinnamon orange with a fine creamy tan cap that leave sheets of lace behind on the glass. The nose is fresh and hoppy with pineapple, toasted grain and plenty of caramel maltiness. Caramel slathered toast with a mild resinous hop bite that lingers into the finish. Medium bodied and mildly carbonated. This is far and away the best WBBC offering I've had. A pretty spot on PA and perfect session ale."
"D: Decent enough; when I first tried this back in late winter/early spring I was more impressed than I have been in subsequent tries. Not sure if the newness wore off, later batches were lacking or what exactly. All I know is it's easy enough to drink, but doesn't do much to set it apart from the pack."
"Wasn't really wowed by Widmer's Drop Top Amber, plus I'm aware this is a craft brewery bought out by the big guns so I was weary of this one. To my surprise, this was a pretty good pale ale. Pours a copper sort of color with not much to it, very little lacing. You can actually detect some hops in the aroma.. good start. Nice mouthfeel and a nice medium body to this one. Some light hop bitterness and definitely some citrus notes in there. Nice smooth and easily drinkable beer. I've had better pale ale's but I've had a lot more sub-par ones compared to this."
"Average."
"Widmer Drifter is good beer that is probably even better beer immediately after bottling. Of course that's true of pretty much all APAs. This is one of WBBC's better efforts and is an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoy a well-crafted pale ale."
"Poured form a 12oz bottle dark copper color, decent finger sized head with good retention. some sticky lacing left on the glass and lots of noticable carbonation. Smell of toasted malts, citrusy hops, and hay. Well balance taste of hops and malt, dry on the finish. Body on the light side, some lingering hops and malt on the finish. Slightly sweet. Nothing special, but overall a decent brew."
"Drinkability: I'd say this is good solid APA. I'd be happy to have another and may if it is still on tap next time I'm here, but on the other hand there are some other APAs I'd prefer given my choice"
"Cheers Widmer Brothers! Great job on this one!!!"
"Pours nice with a copper/brown appearance with a good summer cherry smell to it. with the first taste it has a good crisp almost fruity taste with a decent drinkabilty and I can taste a nice hint of the Hops which is always nice however not the best Pale Ale I have ever had maybe not even in my top 5 but a good pale ale none the less. I might buy it again if Sierra Nevada is not on the shelf"
"Pours amber golden brown I'm going to call it. Thin white head, with some retention and nice lacing. Aroma is of grassy piney hops with a hint of caramel. Body is light with just a hint of carbonation. Taste is light yet full flavored. Good mix of bready malts and grassy hops.Hints of grapefruit too. Very enjoyable."
"Pleasantly surprised to see this on tap at the Atlantic Beer Garden in the Seaport District. Served in a normal pint glass. No head whatsoever. Dark orange in color. Nice carbonation. Can definitely smell some hops. Pronounced hop flavor, but balanced nicely with a touch of malt. Not overly hoppy like an IPA, but I think a decent take at a pale ale. Not overly impressed with the mouthfeel, but I found myself ordering two at dinner. It was just good enough that I didn't mind another. Paired well with barfood apps and a burger."
"The body was good, full without being heavy, and well balanced. This is a very drinkable brew, having several of these easy, well balanced, very enjoyable brew would not be a problem. Overall this is a good beer that is in the wrong style category. The appearance, smell and taste would all rate higher if the brewers chose not to call this ""brown"" beer a PALE ale."
"D: Perhaps something was afoul with the tap lines here, but this Drifter was one to let pass me by. Not bad to try, but I'd be hard pressed to session the motha. Not terrible, but buyer beware."
"Quite drinkable, though not the most complex Pale Ale out there. Still, it is quite a cut above the mediocre-at-best ""Hefeweizen"" that is the brewery's flagship beer; this one should be bumped into that status, as the nose alone is enough to win out over the Hefeweizen any day."
"Pours a clear, amber/copper color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of strong hops and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops up front, slight sweet malt, slight grain, and some earthy malt. Overall, a light and refreshing pale ale with decent body, but very little complexity."
"D: Decent drinkability with moderate enjoyment. Goes down fairly well enough, with an overall worthy recommendation."
"D- Nothing spectacular but a nice easy flavor and feel."
"Feel is average. Not bad at all."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a clear copper color with a little rising carbonation. The one finger of rust-colored head displayed mediocre retention and acceptable lacing. The aroma was wild! Sweet and tropical fruits most notably papaya and guava with only hints of malt behind the gushing, fruity hops presence. The flavors were equally hop oriented but much less fruity and floral. I tasted the hops again first followed by some sweet, doughy malt and a little wood followed by the tropical and citrusy hops that made for a clean finish. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation solid. I enjoy sweeter beers and this definitely was one; for my palate it was sessionable and enjoyable."
"Drifter Pale Ale is a good summer ale with a great deal of flavor; however, it leaves nothing behind--on the glass or the palate."
"Medium bodied, a nice round feel mildly syrupy in the finish. Carbonation is on the low side."
"Draught: This one pours a clear amber color with a decent sized off-white head. It leaves some lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is interesting. There are grassy, earthy hops and another aroma in there it too. Others have said spruce, but I think it almost smells like a whiff of mint. The same characteristic translates into the taste. It is slightly bitter, with a decent body. The earthy and grassy hops are there, but so is the other hop note. Maybe it is psychological from the aroma, but I get a faint taste of mint."
"Poured from brown bottle born in mid june. A clear dark amber / orange with thin eggshell head. Smell: bready malt with a piney, lemony, vaguely grapefruity hop character. Taste: sweet bready and caramel malt with a light citrus kick, and a touch of an odd musty astringency. The hop character is fine but the malt is too sweet and a bit funky. A little on the thin side too. Not bad but won't return."
"I was very surprised to find this on tap at the down and dirty (but always entertaining) Cousin Larry's cafe in Danbury, CT. This poured cold into a pint glass with a cloudy dark amber color and a goodly light tan head with good lacing. I got a decent grapefruit/lemon aroma with some bready malt. The flavor takes on a sharper but less flavorful bitterness. It warms up with more bready malt, oak and some salty grass with nice, tastefully refreshing carbonation. It is mid to light bodied, quite decent stuff and plenty drinkable. Generally a reasonable pale ale for sure, not the best, but better than most I would say."
"Enjoyed on tap @ Cork & Vine in Dayton Ohio. Drifter is a surprisingly solid pale ale, solid but not amazing. Pours almost amber and darker hue than most PA's I've drank. Smells of hop infused with a bit of a caramel and bitters but the smell is weak. Tastes like a traditional pale ale. Hops aren't overpowering and malt character although not perfectly balanced is present. Overall a solid Pale Ale Session brew."
"Overall, this is a great sessionable pale ale that I was pleasantly surprised with for the sale price of 5.99/sixer. I will definitely be buying this up before it's gone! My favorite offering from Widmer so far."
"Pleasant, quaffable. Darn. I was gearing up for hate."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, the sweetness kind of over-powers everything else in the beer, but overall it's a fairly good beer that is worth drinking for a while."
"D- Not a bad Pale Ale, but pretty mediocre compared to some of the other top beers in this category."
"The flavor is a good mix of bittersweet with some grape fruit characteristics, but there's some lingering harshness to the hops that isn't pleasant. Nothing crazy going on here. It could be much better, I would rather have Sierra Nevada, but this is much different with a much different malt bill. Plenty of flavor going on here, but it seems a bit of a mess."
"Pours a pretty, dark amber with only a hint of head. Not much haze and smells of a solid, fruity hop. It's got a solid body with good mouthfeel, and the flavor is delicious. It's crisp and piney with overall good hop character to finish. This was a very enjoyable pale that I would definitely recommend!"
"Very tasty without trying too hard, well-balanced, great poolside beer."
"amber bodied brew with a good sized cream colored head thats the result of a little cascading action. Good amount of lacing left behind on the glass. Pale malt nose dominated by a nice citrus hop note. Standard pale malt front with a very nice floral hop background, slightly bitter. Creamy medium mouth. Not a bad pale at all."
"D - Not the first beer that I'd order but at those bars that only get things from AB distributors its a good stand by"
"I was a little aprehensive about buying this because I havent overly impressed with other Widmer products but this was pretty good I have to say.Poured into a standard pint a clear medium golden with a nice tight formed 1/2 finger white head that had good lasting power.Aromas of caramel/biscuit malt with a firm toastiness,a tinge of citric hop comes thru as well.Pretty balanced on the palate,a big sweetish caramel base with some dough up front that yields to a citrusy lightly piney finish.A real summer quaffing pale ale,it blow your mind but its pretty solid."
"Taste is dry and slightly bitter. Not bad and somewhat sweet for its own good. Decent feel and drink yet a bit bland when first sampled due to low carbonation. A revisit with a fresher bottle shows better carbonation and better balance."
"Clear copper with a bubbly head that dissipates. Has a light, candied orange nose. Light, flowery orange flavors up front; slight sweetness from a light malt body balances a hint of minerals. Hops are mild but distinctive, bringing more orange and floral flavors than bitterness. Well integrated flavors and light carbonation make this a fast-drinking beer. Finish is quick and clean, with only a faint lingering flavor of soft leafy hops. A real summer afternoon beer, but not quite complex enough to inspire a long session. A good value at $5.99/sixer."
"Overall I found Widmer Bros. Drifter exhibits a complex/distinctive taste and was very drinkable on tap; I would drink again when offered on tap."
"Dang, just when I thought I had Widmer pegged as a brewery that didn't fit me, I run into a beer I find to be pretty dang solid. Reminds me quite a bit of a OB Dale's Pale Ale."
"A solid offering. A great hamburger and fries brew. A definite beer to session with. This is a great choice to bridge people into the craft brew world."
"Overall- Smooth and fresh tasting. Nice balanced Pale Ale. Widmer's best offering!"
"D-This is an awesome pale ale...maybe the best I have had."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid malt scent that boasts of pale, Carapils, and bisquit malts along with a piney hop aroma. The taste is decent. It has a very malty flavor that really focuses on the bisquit malts. It's smooth with a mild hop finish. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinker. It's nice to see a different take on the APA."
"D: The dry finish and low alcohol make this a very drinkable beer. Nothing overly complex, but a classic example of the quintessential beer. Not intimidating for beginners at all."
"I had high hopes for this beer as I love Broken Halo and their hefe. But this on just didn't work out for me. The amount of bitterness is perfect for an american pale ale but the type of hops they used disagrees with my palate 100%. Their website said they used summit, nelson sauvin, and alchemy hops in this beer. I'm assuming its the summit or the Nelson Sauvin hops because I like their IPA and it has alchemy hops in it. Would be a great beer if they used something like cascade instead. But then I guess it'd probably just taste like Sierra Nevada."
"Pours a reddish amber color. Small head disappears into a thin lace. Smells sweet, a lot of citrus. Maybe some lemongrass. Tastes strongly of grapefruity american hops. Its medium bitterness is enough to balance any cloying sweetness from the caramel/bready malt backbone. Pretty decent, the grapefruit stands out for me in this one."
"Poured a deepish orange color with a small white head. Nose is on the mellow side of citrus notes. Taste is a little hop forward with some citrus and floral notes. Mouthfeel is nice, bubbly and pretty good. Nice ABV makes it a good session brew. Very drinkable indeed. Surpsise by Widmer."
"The feel is smooth and buttery. Like silk, and almost perfect. The drinkability is high, because this beer is really impressive. Has an unexpected sweet/bitter balance."
"Tarnished copper body. Thin beige head. Spotty lace. Very pleasant aroma of vibrant aromatic hops and carmelized malts. As with the nose, there's a nice balance on the palate between hops and malt. Bright citric hop notes meld with caramel malts to create an agreeable flavor. Medium to medium-full body. Moderately carbonated."
"Actually quite a pleasant surprise. I will not lie, I wasn't expecting too much. Appearance is nice copper color, looks somewhat light and refreshing. Smell and taste have very nice hop characteristics. Deep and grapefruity with enough malt to balance it out. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but acceptable. Drinkability is very good."
"The drinkability is awesome. I finished this beer before I could even finish typing this review and this is the last one of the six pack. (I didn't drink them all today)."
"The taste is quite good. The hop is very juicy and estery. The beer itself is a tad bit thin, doesn't have lots of bready backbone or a substantial creamy base. What you do get is a very nice, slightly thin, malty beer with some very nice hop notes throughout. It is a tad drying in the finish, and there is some leafy bite in the finish as well, but this beer is quite good, refreshing, enjoyable, with a mouthfeel that is a bit citrusy and an aftertaste that is very mild. Worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Pours a light amber with thick off-white head. Good lacing down glass. Smells like sweet grapefruit hops. Smells great, but kind of one dimensional. A nice blend of citrus, fruity grapefruit hops and toasted malt. Mouthfeel is a little thick and full for a pale ale but good. Great drinkability, could drink these all day."
"Overall, a decent beer with some nice light fruit flavor, however I would not consider this a Pale Ale. A decent, sessionable beer though."
"With a pint glass it came up with one finger of head that faded fairly quickly. Smells of malt and fruitiness, peaches and apricot, with a slight hop. Clean mouthfeel with good caronation, smooth and drinkable. Tastes like a good pale ale with a decent malt/hop balance. The one thing I did appreciate about this beer was a unique citrusy, peach/apricot flavor that I enjoyed. I will probably buy this again."
"Awsome amounts of citrus smell on the brew, makes you think you're going to get a real hoppy brew. Good deep amber color with a head on the beer that disapears quickly. The taste is amazing. Good hops, with a great balance. I can't say enough of how good this beer is. I'm very impressed with Widmer Brothers brewing for coming out with this one."
"Pours dark amber with white head that doesn't last long. Nose has a nice citrusy element, particularly grapefruit, and some candied aromas. Palate is on the dry, hoppy side with a small backbone of malt to balance out. Not a bad offering from one of the BMC affiliates."
"12 ounce bottle with bottled on dating on the lower front label. (040609) Pours clear darker amber, fluffydarker tan head, that sticks around for ever, leaving more then respectable lace on the glass. The sniff reveals more then typical wiffs of citric hops. Nice, drinkable pale. Pineapple tinged hops, with hints of lime and mango with floral/fruity flourishes. Dry, yet still fruity finish. A pleasant suprise. Well worth a try."
"D-This I could session all night long. Very drinkable. Please go out and get a sixer of this bad boy. You wont be dissapionted."
"The drinkability is decent. I did end up having 2 decently sized pints (16 oz) and had no problem finishing them both. Overall I'd say this beer was a decent surprise at a location I figured I would have to order wine in order to be happy."
"D - Good, but couldn't taste much in the form of malts in this pale ale."
"A keeper."
"12oz bottle obtained at the local Hannaford, bottled on 4-10-2009. Pours a crystal-clear dark amber body with a very short-lived quarter inch of off-white head. Smells very citrussy and pithy, grapefruit and lemon come to mind. Lemon hits the palat first, with a fair bit of grapefruit and hints of pith in tow. A reasonable amount of caramel malt helps to balance the hops, with hints of breadiness too. Smooth light to medium body with moderate to low carbonation. Very very drinkable, even for the style. Simple and balanced, some may well view this as a bit pedestrian. But nonetheless it's a solid APA and much better than I expected."
"sample bottle. What a surprise after having the amber. This poured a much richer color with a thicker head. I suppose the 5.7% on the front might have something to do with a fuller bodied beer. Nice darker hue than the amber. Goes down smooth and has great balance between hop and malt. It's not the best thing I've ever had, but considering the previous beer I drank, this one is a solid, accessible beer."
"Body is on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation level is appropriate. Pretty smooth drinker. Dry finish. Not bad."
"Drinkability: A decent, simple, but easily accessible American Pale Ale."
"Oh yum, that hits the spot. Now I wish I bought another one. My favorite Widmer product to date."
"D: Very drinkable. The floral hops and sharp bitter provide nice contrast. Malts givie it some character."
"Drinkability-Smooth and flavorful, medium bodied. An excellent session if a touch high ABV for one."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0903-DanM"
"Seems like a lot of negativity comming out of this review, but these ill attributes don't kill the beer. I think it's fine but suffers from some tomato-catty things in the initial aroma and poorly chosen hops."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Tropical, grapefruity hops supported by a toasted malt backbone. Light in body with a slight alcohol presence. Wet, hoppy finish, only mildly bitter. Solid stuff."
"An interesting beer to be sure. Drinkability suffers a little because it's really focused on that grapefruit note and it builds up sip after sip, but was really surprised at how much I liked it."
"a good pale ale would recommend and buy again. Probably one of the best beer ive had from widmer."
"taste is light, hops, malt in the back, some citrus, earthy, and a little pine in the back too, ends a little dry and a little bitter."
"Good beer. Grapefruit flavored hops with a really sweet taste and almost sweet hops with a grapefruit aftertaste. But still sweet and hoppy. Odd. I like it. Crisp and clean. Nice. Mostly no head but a constant very little ringer left. Smells grapefruity sweet, again odd. Mouthfeel is good, full of flavors, hops, maybe different kinds of hops, not sure what. Very easy to drink, good beer..."
"I might just have something against Widmer but this pale ale just doesn't do it for me. I got a case for 13 bucks, which was good...but i don't know if i'd even spend that much if i had a second chance."
"Starts out on the right foot but there's just something that's not right about it. Otherwise, it's drinkable and at least they got the hops part right."
"D: Quite drinkable, I can say that I really enjoyed this beer would definitely not mind having this again."
"Drinkability: Taste is good, mouthfeel good. Easy to drink a few. Recommended"
"Pretty average APA, relatively new, I believe. Grassy citrus notes throughout, but without much of the bitterness that usually accompanies these aromas and flavors. Its drinkable enough, but isn't on the same playing field as SNPA or Dale's Pale Ale, in my opinion. Pick up a sixer and try it out, its a good session beer and you may love it. Or may be like me, and go right back to where you came from."
"Pours a clear amber color with a large white head that had excellant retention. Nice lacing is left on the glass. Has a nice citrus hop aroma. A little biscuit malt sneaks past the hops. The flavor starts out very good. Nice bitter, citrus hop flavor. Hints of grapefruit and orange. The malt is not really detectable. Unfortunately things diminish quickly leaving a medicinal aftertaste. Bitterness is on the high side for an APA. Has a nice body and carbonation. A surprisingly good APA and sessionable."
"I recommend this beer. I think it is a prime gateway beer for some people that are not ready for the torpedo or the furious."
"D - Great session beer! Not a life changing brew, but great for summer BBQs and late nights around the camp fire."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and slightly dry. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is bitter and a tad dry. I was rather surprised by this beer, this is a descent APA. It is a little harsh around the edges, but overall I enjoyed it."
"Pours a clear brownish red color body with a small off-white head, quickly diminishing. Aroma is dry grapefruit. Some bitterness too. But pretty weak overall. Somewhat watery dry taste. Some malty nuttiness. Some hoppy bitterness. Weak bland taste."
"D) Yum. Hope to see this on my local shelves, I plan to get more. This is my favorite Widmer Brothers beer to date."
"This is a hopstrong brew. It's surprising that it's only 32 IBUs as another reviewer mentioned. Tons of grapefruit, a little pine, and a good healthy amount of bready malt. This is an excellent APA. Dark bronze amber. Nice head, spotty lacing. The drinkability is good, along with the mouthfeel. I was not expecting this level of goodness from this little gem."
"Overall, this is a very good average APA that I think the average non-BA beer drinker will like alot. I would have no problem ordering this at a bar if offered."
"Weird beer--they must have added a huge amount of late-kettle hops after a very light early hopping schedule. It's not a bad beer, but it's vaguely disappointing... I take a whiff of the aroma and expect a nice hoppily bitter beer, but it doesn't ever pay back. I could understand someone else enjoying it a lot."
"D: A real nice surprise from Widmer, I think I like this one better than Sierra Nevada, well done, certainly worth a purchase at a $7.99 six-pack."
"Goes down pretty well, easy to drink overall."
"Were this beer not knocking on 6%, I'd say it was a great session pale ale. Definitely something I'll be buying more of as the weather warms up, and I just might go grab a sixer of it tonight. I really hope Widmer makes this a regular offering."
"Wow, This is a Horrible Beer.It tastes like it was Fermented in Dirty Socks,with Body Order added for Flavor.The Date on the side says Feb 10 09.I don't know if thats the ""Born on Date"" or ""Expiration Date"".? Widmer Dropped the ball on this one.I liked everything else they produced."
"D: easily a all around drinker. Has a nice standing and drinks smooth. I still found the hop flavors a bit timid for what the nose presented...still a winner"
"Drinkability is off the charts. Great balanced pale ale, and sure to be a summertime staple for me. This beer makes me want to buy a kegerator!"
"The mouth is smooth and benefits from great low carbonation and slightly warmer serving temps. Easy drinker."
"Drinkability? On par for the style me thinks. It surely goes down easily enough and is tasty enough. Widmer did a good job with this one."
"The taste was light and had a decent malt profile with a light tinge of bitterness. It is listed at 32 ibu's and doesn't make much of a fuss that way. It was lemony on the tongue with that grapefruit and well carbonated. Overall a unique and pretty darn good APA."
"D. I wish i had a keg of this on tap. well balanced with the hops and malt"
"Probably my new favorite Widmer in a bottle. Thanks Widmer."
"D: Very drinkable. This will be another go-to APA for me right next to Sierra Nevada"
"Pleasantly surprised to find this kind of output from widmer. I poured it from the bottle into my chalice. The head didn't stick around for that long, the beer had a nice clear, slightly ruby hue. The smells were the highlight of the beer for me, without looking i would guess it was some combo of west coast hops. Very nice. The taste was nice because the hops came through initially but it was a surprisingly balanced pale. The nose prepared me for a near ipa style, but it was nice to have the balance between the hops and the malt. The mouthfeel definitely fit the style, and i felt like i could definitly drink a few more of these upon finishing. Spot on widmer...spot on."
"Overall impression: Interesting beer - tons of hop flavor and aroma with no bitterness - pretty drinkable. This is a nice gateway hop offering."
"a very drinkable beer. i think this is by far the best selection from widmer brothers."
"Unique and worth trying."
"-Malty aftertaste and doesn't leave too dry. A bit on the weak side.. so a bit watery.. but it's a pale so... very drinkable and quite good. Would love to see a summit hopped Imperial IPA. Reminds me of the 3-time dry-hopped Workhorse IPA from Laurelwood... but much more mild and store-shelf ready."
"Pours a nice amber color with a one finger head and some light lacing. Aroma has a nice citrus character, mostly orange, some light pine and a certain malty sweetness. Taste is very similar to the nose. Plenty of orange juiciness, bitter grapefruit, and a solid malt backbone. Medium bodied, light carbonation. This is a pretty good pale ale, though it's not an everyday drinker like SN. Very drinkable and enjoyable, though."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. Probably the best Widmer that I've had yet. Nice change up in the APA space for me. Not sure I'd buy many six packs but could see grabbing a few singles or having on tap or taking one if offered out of someone else's stash. Recommend."
"O: Excellent Pale Ale. The fresh, bright quality of the predominant hops flavor makes me envision the Widmer brothers harvesting the Oregon Cascade hops right outside the brewhouse."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this pale ale. It smelt a lot like an IPA which was pleasant. I could definitely have another."
"This is a very drinkable beer. A nice multi-dimensional pale ale."
"Full amber with a modest white head from a gentle pour. Fair amount of lacings. Aroma of citrus hops. Taste is citrus orange pinapple with a sweet caramel malt. It does have a moderate amount of hops bitterness and an IBU of 32. A very drinkable, slightly sweet Pale Ale."
"Enjoyable and balanced is the name of the game. I would recommend this."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Not my favorite APA but affordable & extremely drinkable. I could enjoy about 2-3 of these on just about any day. I liked the zesty fruity flavors of this beer. Pretty sessionable, not bad. Worth a try."
"This is actually pretty damn good pale ale... I could see drinking this one for a while in the long run, and it makes me wish I would have picked up a 6'er today to have a fridge beer..."
"Quite a bit better than expected. Website says 32 IBUs seems stronger than that."
"This beer pours a clear bright ruby color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of floral hops, tea, hints of citrus. It is very nuanced. The taste leans towards the hops, but it is quite balanced. Tea, flowers, cirtus, and nice caramel notes throughout. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a very good APA. I was really not expecting something this good from Widmer Brothers so kudos to them. I will certainly drink this again."
"I'm sold. this may be my apa/ipa six-pack choice for a while. Enjoyable on all levels, with enough character and pop to make each sip enjoyable. definitely one of my favorite recent bottled offerings from Widmer (by a long shot, actually). Definitely worth a try if you have any appreciation for balanced hopping what-so-ever."
"On to the taste...unfortunately it's a slight letdown. The hops start off with a spicy-fresh burst of greenery, but the malts pursue with somewhat of an off-putting flavor of burnt caramel and nuts. A slightly sour finish lingers too long. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium (a bit thick for the style), but with a good carbonation level. I do like the bitterness on the beginning, but unfortunately this beer doesn't hold up in the long run. Still, it's a decent brew that deserves at least one try from the hop-lovers out there."
"Thin white head but with good retention and lots of big, popping bubbles, not much lacing. Red copper color just deep enough to hold your gaze and get past transparency, nice fade to burnt orange hues along the rims. Admirable mix of pink and white grapefruit in the nose, floral with chamomile tea notes, spoonful of pine sap, no herbaceous nor ultra-sweet elements, stays within itself and on message, you could sniff it for some time. Medium-bodied, however, most of it is palate pressure and a sense of marching forward rather than flavor. The grapefruit and tangerine citrus starts things off well, after that there's momentary pine, green hay, wet stone aspects. But after that it's evanescence leads to homogeneity. Credibly, the carbonation ratchets it down to fit the body profile. It's drinkable enough for a bottle or two before your mind starts to wander. If the palate could match the nose, that would be something."
"Its drinkable OK..like an IPA lite. . Good stuff"
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer very much (four times over). I look forward to trying it out of the bottle at home."
"Nice clear copper colour with no head to speak of (none of the beers at the bar were pouring with much head, so Ill put that on them and not the brewer). Hoppy, tropical fruit aroma. Tangerines, nectarines and the like. Sweet caramel malt aroma in the finish. Flavour is great, lots of fruity hops and a nice caramel sweetness, not overly sweet as to be cloying though. Bitterness is very understated and smooth, its there but doesnt bite if you know what I mean. Pretty light bodied for a beer of 5.7 % ABV. Carbonation is medium. This one falls somewhere between an APA and an IPA. Its to strong and hoppy to be an APA but just not aggressive enough to be an IPA. I really like this beer and hope that Widmer sends some bottles my way."
"This spa was a nice surprise. The second widmer beer to surprise me lately -- I liked brrr a lot also"
"Drinkability: Indeed, a highly quaffable brew. Worthy of the high scores it seems to be generating out of the chute. Well done and looking forward to this beer hitting the east coast soon!"
"Overall: This beer has a flavor of no other pale ale, It is very approachable and has great flavor, making me yearn for another."
"Not your average pale but rather a twist on the same old pales that are on the market today!"
