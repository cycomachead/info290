The beer is a clear orange gold with a decent amount of sediment floating around in it and is topped by a floating, soapy white head that has a light retention and a light lace. The aroma is a bright tropical and citrus note with a touch of pine and a subtle bread toast undertone. The taste is a balanced, medium bittersweet. The texture is oily with a foamy carbonation to help it go down smooth. The medium body is flavored much like the aroma - citrus, pineapple, mango, and pine. It finishes with a waxy, bitter grapefruit and pine that turns lightly cloying and astringent, but mostly clean, with an aftertaste of bread toast.","ARoman","Tuesday at 06:31 PM"

4.04,0.2,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Pours two fingers of light tan fluffy head with good retention and some spotty lacing. Clear, light amber and orange. Some small particles floating around. Zesty, spicy smell of pine. Floral background with citrus notes from Cascade hops. Semi-sour citrus flavors, like lemon, with pine lingering more on finish. Bitterness is right about what I would expect in a pale. Straightforward and not too complex, but quite refreshing. Good carbonation, and stays on front and middle of tongue for half a minute or so. Acidity seems slightly off balance compared to lighter side of a medium body feel, but thats not a bad thing. Foam expands and dances around mouth, even with a small sip. Overall, a great example of a pale ale, perhaps not the pinnacle, but a highly recommended go-to. Easy drinking and easy to find at a good price (about $1 per beer, even in a six pack).","sporklift87","Mar 18, 2015"

Even the smell isn't that much of a downside, which is saying a lot considering just how sensitive I am to bad smells (as in ""if something smells really bad to me, I can't bring myself to eat it."")  I can see how this was so many people's ""wow, beer can taste like THIS?"" beer way back in the day when craft beer was a much smaller chunk of the market than it is today.  I'm glad I decided to pick up a fresher six-pack of this one after trying an old one in a restaurant once... although I don't mind the old version either, it is definitely better with only 2 or 3 months of age on it rather than 10 or 11!

Sierra Nevada really fits the bill, setting the bar for other APAs with a beautiful, lustrous amber hue and two-finger, bubbly white head.  The lacing sustains throughout.  The aroma is floral and citrus with the hops coming through nicely, and the taste is not harsh at all, just enough bitterness to tease the tongue, and a nice hoppy finish (not overpowering).  I've always admired the balance in this beer, and the carbonation is moderate but present.  Overall, this is a standard for APAs, a really solid brew.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Feb 27, 2015"

Some hop bitterness but also an earthy taste and an occasional sweet undertone. A very balanced beer.  This is the true embodiment of an American Pale Ale.

The bottle-conditioned brew leaves large pieces of sediment gently drifting to the bottom, while the finer particles stay suspended. The otherwise translucent appearance of the beer really highlights the unfiltered nature of this one. Adorning the liquid is a massive, fluffy head that mounds over the top. In time it settles to a rocky layer of white foam, with impressive staying power. In its wake, mottled lacing clings to the glass. A sweet Hawaiian roll aroma beckons, with some tropical fruit in the nose. Faint caramel malt flavors dance with some pale malt varieties and a complimentary orange citrus hop bitterness. There's a little toasted grain and dryness in the finish. After a few sips, a pleasant bready yeast flavor lingers on the tongue. Nice juicy body with adequate carbonation. Perfectly balanced. Everything is apparent, but in moderation. This is an artful example of how the sum of a beer's parts can be much greater than the whole (or in this case, the whole cone hops!). This one is easy to quaff and entices you to take the next sip. They don't call it a stylistic standard because it's ordinary.

This one is nicely balanced.  Kind of a woody aftertaste.  One of the best pale ales I've ever had.  Great beer!","mhuber","Jan 24, 2015"

It has a great amber color for the pale ale style of brewing, an inviting floral citrus aroma, and an upfront hoppiness that fades at just the right time to a malty backbone, leaving a great balanced aftertaste in the mouth, with a moderately creamy mouth feel, all in all a great beer, one that I would buy again anytime, not to mention that this beer is a classic in the craft beer industry and certainly brought more awareness to craft brewing in the nineties.","taters21","Dec 12, 2014"

4.1,1.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 9/10/2014. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit, caramel, bread, light honey, floral, grass, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit, caramel, bread, light honey, floral, grass, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit, caramel, bread, light honey, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and fairly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent pale ale. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 22, 2014"

Aroma is of citrus and floral hops, with just a touch of bready malt. Taste has a lot of floral hops with a bit of orange notes and just a touch sweetness from the malt, very well balanced. Mouthfeel is somewhat light and crisp, with a nice dry finish. I can see why this beer has kinda been somewhat of a standard to which all other Pale Ales are measured.","timontheroad","Nov 08, 2014"

Malt character is present but gently hiding behind the hops, adding a necessary body to the beer. Watery ending with only small hints of hops, which lingers long on the tongue. Carbonation adding a freshness to the beer, without being too present, well balanced. This ale does deliver as being an every-day IPA, without trying to offend in any way, by being to extreme on any of its ingredients.","aleigator","Nov 04, 2014"

3.5,-13.2,,,,,,"I struggle to rate this beer. If you go purely by taste.. then you basically have a showcase for cascade hops, which craft drinkers are familiar with and by now may find dull. But I can't drink it and not appreciate the contribution to craft beer history and the rise of good beer in America. This beer is a classic. I also give it points for being so highly available.","JohnIrving","Oct 27, 2014"

A light feeling beer with a little to offer everyone. Light hop presence, a little bready malt, a touch of fruit and a subdued bitterness. I get a spicy, peppery finish more than bitter. An overall well crafted, balanced ale with not much in the way of wow factor. Solid, but nothing special, so I can't approach the 4.0 it is currently getting. To me a 4 is a beer I will seek out again, and this I probably won't.","RobbDogg","Oct 24, 2014"

This is the best beer to introduce the flavor of hops with your friends unfamiliar with craft beer.  There is plenty of pine and citrus hop flavor but not too much and the bitterness is restrained, especially compared to most modern pale ales.  This is a great hop forward ale that is consistent in quality and easy to obtain.","Tuck_leepulin","Sep 24, 2014"

4,-0.7,,,,,,"The greatest thing about Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is that you can find it in so many places. It's distributed wide and far and, unless you've wandered very far off the beaten path, it's usually one of the few worthy brews you'll find almost everywhere. It's a pretty amber and it's hoppy, that's apparent right away. The Cascade hops throw a strong shadow over the malted barley. A nice, mellow head adds a smoothness to the mouthfeel but the sharpness of the aroma, to me, throws the floral notes and malty finish out of balance. One is usually enough before my palate asks to move on. Unless of course there is nothing else at which point you'll see me order another and complain not! It will always be a solid, go-to APA for if/when you can't find an alternative to try at your local brewpub.","ob_carr","Sep 14, 2014"

Teenage me was at a Grateful Dead show at Soldier Field in Chicago, IL. I can still hear the call of the gentle hippies, as they pushed coolers of it around on skateboards. "" Ice cold Sierra Nevada!"" I thought it was the nectar of the gods. I also later thought I was in an Ewok village. Not sure where I'm going with this anymore, but in any case this is a great beer.","RoamingGnome","Sep 13, 2014"

That's not to say it's a bad beer. I can review a beer on its good merits even if I don't agree with them.

4.11,2,,,,,,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and great example of a classic American Pale, even though this beer seems a little mild compare to most American Pale Ales that are on the market now it is still exactly how the style was intended to be and it had that great balance that a lot of Pale Ales seem to overlook.  This beer has great drinkability, it's very smooth, crisp, clean, not filling at all and the taste does a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these especially on a warm summer day and I like to think of this beer as the original craft session beer.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance and they drinkability, to me those were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I would change or that I dislike, it's really nice just the way it is.  I would buy this beer again, it's usually a good option when at a bar that doesn't have a good selection, it an old reliable.  I would recommend this to anyone who is getting in to craft beer or American Pale Ales, it's a must try for any craft beer lover.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it's always the same and it always delivered when I want a nice and easy drinking beer.  It's one of my favorite American Pale Ales in the sense that it's exactly what the style is all about and I think it's one of the better beers from Sierra Nevada, especially for their year round beers.  Good job guys, I've been enjoying this beer for a while and I hope to continue to for many years to come, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Aug 24, 2014"

The taste is great with a burst of hop flavor in the beginning that fades into a toasty malt flavor that finishes the beer well. I can definitely see how this one is a popular beer today.","WhiteHillsStore","Jul 30, 2014"

Everything is well-balanced, and you can kick back a few of them without hop overload. Someone with an IPA-warped palate will barely be able to notice the bitterness, but that makes it more approachable for non-BA's just starting out in craft beer. It's a solid, everyday pale ale at an affordable price.","enjambed","Jul 27, 2014"

3.75,-6.9,3.5,3.5,3.75,4,4,"Still thought this was great. The appearance was beautiful - poured a deep golden amber but did not have a very thick head, thin and white with no lacing at all. Would have rated Appearance at least 4 if it had more persistent head/more lacing. We'll see if the next bottle is any different. Smelled kind of. piney in a way. Smells hoppy. Spice-y. Smells good. The taste is one of my favorites for a pale ale. Absolutely perfect blend of hops and malt. Got a hoppy flavor which transitions into a bready spiced barley kind of flavor. Finishes a bit dry. Light-medium bodied, closer to the light side. Slightly above average carbonation. Overall I'd say a 3.75. High drinkability, might purchase again if I'm ever in an ale mood.","Lordhelmit","Jul 22, 2014"

It has a distinct piney hop aroma. The taste follows the nose, but with a more prominent malt backbone. This being said, the piney hop taste is featured most prominent. A pleasant resinous hop bitterness, along with a hint of breadiness, lingers on the tongue for a bit. An exceptional example of the style.","thomda11","Jul 05, 2014"

Great hoppy flavors that go with any foods that I want to pair with it. Of course my palette has refined from a Western Pennsylvania guy that grew up on Iron City, Rolling Rock, Schmidt's, Miller High LIfe, and Stroh's through college.

Had a much better experience with it there, much smoother. But, I have the bottle again and reviewing from that. This beer is really great due to the bottle conditioning. The carbonation spike is probably due to the conditioning of the brew, which I've come to like. It does offer a different flavor profile from it. The carbonation being one. The second, being a thicker flavor profile. Citrus and pine flavors persist. On the nose and mouth it feels like I'm getting the raw form of all the ingredients put into this brew. Although I do prefer the Torpedo IPA, i would have no problem purchasing this beer again, if on tap. But as long as the Torpedo exists, i will not purchase the bottle version again. Lacing is sticky and has a nice hue to the head. Flavors get more intense as it warms. 5.6% alcohol keeps you stable for the long haul. Overall a awesome brew!","silverevo9","Jun 25, 2014"

4.16,3.2,4,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a half finger of off-white head with good retention and lacing. Nice aroma of light tropical fruit, citrus, pine, sweet malt. Flavor of mild sweet malt, tropical fruit, citrus, piney and citrus hops, finishing with piney, citrus and grassy hop bitterness. Awesome creamy medium body for a pale ale, great mouth feel. Seems slightly subdued after getting used to the abundant NW IPAs, but quickly won me over with a nicely balanced array of hop flavors and the creamy body augments the incredible balance of malt and hop in this ale. I understand why this is so highly regarded. A bit old fashioned in its flavors, but absolutely holding its own. A great pale ale from one of the world's great breweries.","LiquidAmber","May 07, 2014"

The aroma is spicy, piney, and citrusy with a pleasant maltiness that balances out the hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is a tad too heavy for the style. It is very nice and coating but given the abv and style, I'd prefer it just s smidgen lighter on the tongue. The flavor is a refreshing blend of subtler west coast hops and light caramel malts. It is very well balanced and almost as distinctive as the nose. There is a reason that this has been one of the most popular and benchmark ales in the realm of craft beers. Its a good and consistent apa worth trying and respecting.","lochef81","Apr 30, 2014"

The smell is overwhelming with citrus (mostly clementine). The taste is primarilly grapefruit, with a balanced amount of hop bitterness (this is hoppy for a pale ale, but not bitter enough for an IPA, this beer sits somewhere in between). The mouthfeel is nice and clean. Perfect beer if you're not looking for something too intense, but still want a great tasting beer.","caseyrobertson","Apr 01, 2014"

A very rich aroma of spicy malts and and orange citrus gave me a good punch. Very tasty; citrus mixed with a caramel, bready flavoring and a malty aftertaste. Crisp carbonation with a subtle creaminess; really helps to make the drink refreshing and makes you want to go back for more. Overall, a fantastic pale ale.","fitzy84","Feb 08, 2014"

Pours a honey yellow with a big white fluffy head. Tastes delicious. Remarkabely smooth and refreshing with a hoppy bite to it. This is one of my favorite beers ever.

Despite a purchase made out of complete desperation, this turned out to be a great American pale ale due to it's absolute simplicity. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is like a good burger. It would not be prudent to add too many other toppings and over complicate things. The aroma is amazing, the taste of hops is perfectly balanced, and this beer goes down really smooth. The price is fair, and this one is about as easy to get as my women. There are only 175 calories in a 12oz. bottle, and since its loaded with hops, it's also loaded with healthy polythenols, that will hopefully balance out the damage my liver takes whenever I buy this beer and end up drinking too much! This A.P.A. should be enjoyed straight out of the bottle, in my opinion. A solid brew for sure.","Isrealite","Dec 20, 2013"

I am loathe to associate myself with those who whip themselves into a righteous rage over the thought of a store that lets IPAs sit on shelves longer than a week, but it's nothing so ridiculous to acknowledge that 4 months is too old for this beer.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Dec 07, 2013"
2.48,-38.5,3.75,2,2.5,3.75,2,"I am writing this review because I am concerned about Sierra Nevada. I am a huge supporter of craft beer especially Sierra Nevada, but today I noticed something... Earlier today I enjoyed a pale ale in the can and it tasted great just as I would expect. Hoppy, balanced, a typical SN pale ale. Later in the day I had a pale ale in the bottle (bottling code 319311014) which was totally different. It was malt forward and sweet. The hop character was subdued. It almost tasted like fat tire or Sam Adams. What's going on Sierra Nevada? I have heard that Sierra Nevada was adjusting some of its recipes... I hope this is not the future of the beer I love.","jbweld","Dec 07, 2013"

This brew is a golden copper color with a nice white head some thin lacing left on the glass. The aroma is sweet and hoppy as is the flavour. The flavour is very well balanced. The malt is sweet like honey and contrasts the bitterness of the American hops perfectly. I don't see this as a world class beer to be sipped out of snifters or a beer to impress anyone. To me, its just a great beer that goes perfect with any occasion any time of year. As i said this is my go to beer i drink it all the time. Perhaps you should too.","CA_brewster","Nov 22, 2013"

4.25,5.5,4,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,"I was looking at the recent reviews for this beer, and I was surprised that it isn't rated as the exceptional beer that I perceive it to be and as the beer that it used to be. Is it because the quality has gone down? I think not. I think right now--the age of the double IPA and the triple IPA--there is the desire for more and more--more hops and a higher ABV. This APA isn't about quantity, it's about quality, and the hops are nicely composed but they are also balanced. A pour of this beer reveals a great head with sticky lacing, and the beer has a smell and taste of hops that offer citrus, floral, and pine flavors. The mouthfeel is spot on for a hoppy session beer--perfect thickness and carbonation, giving it a nice crispness. Maybe this beer is too easy to find (much like how Sam Adams Boston Lager has become so taken for granted and too ""weak"" to be appreciated), but I think this is much better than many of the amped up double IPAs with their 10% ABV.","DeFaz","Oct 08, 2013"

They make some of my all time favorite top 3 beers (Ovila Golden Ale, and the other 2 Ovila's). This a great pale ale, hoppy, slight bitter, but I don't like the lingering bitterness. I have toured Sierra Nevada's Chico plant, and they put every other brewery I have been to to shame when it comes to facilities, and tours. Part of that is the lack of corporate bureaucracy, since it is still a private brewery, and hopefully will remain so forever. If anyone goes through Chico,CA I would highly recommend this tour. At the end of ours, we tried 10 beers in their tasting room, it was awesome. They have a great pubhouse to great food.","Jdbateman83","Aug 31, 2013"

Apricot and pear esters, mild biscuity malt base. Flavorful, but not a complex monster that would turn this easy drinker into something disjointed or ponderous. Hop flavors are really well integrated. Oranges, mild baby aspirin, grapefruit pithy. Ptihy is drying in the finish and helps clean the tongue in the aftertaste. Heavy carbonation stings in the aftertaste, but is somehow fine-bubbled and creamy when liquid is in the mouth. Md-light viscosity is somehow a bit creamy, too. Well done!","mentor","Jul 28, 2013"

The hops are robust and biting, while the aroma is decently fresh, mildly warming, and inviting. The flavor retains its strength with each sip, and invigorates the palate with its blend. This is a classic sipping beer, and something every beer enthusiast should be familiar with.","TheBrewo","May 01, 2013"

There was a strong lemon flavor at first, but the finish is earthy and reminiscent of a freshly laid bed of pine straw. It has a very crisp mouthfeel and goes down smooth.

Normally, we cannot get this beer in Alberta, but due to the fact that Vancouver hosted the Olympics in 2010 and Sierra Nevada was a sponsor of their alpine ski team, he was able to pick up a bottle from a liquor store in BC. It poured a nice ruby with immediate hop aroma, but underlying and very pleasant caramel malt. The lacing could not have been better and it just tasted awesome! I immediately understood why Sierra Nevada is considered one of the world's best beer producers and at the forefront of the craft beer movement. If beers like this could catch on to the mainstream, we would never see Budweiser in another bar, unless it was the original Czech pilsner!","zachloveshisbeer","Jan 09, 2013"

Also a great beer for introducing people to the world of craft beer, namely hop-forward beers, as it has a large hop presence but is relatively mild and far from overpowering, especially to a new palate.

And yes, I'm drinking it straight from the can. There is something about the hole in a can that aerates the beer and gives it a novel texture and taste which I must admit I enjoy. As long as these stay a good bit cheaper than the bottled Pale Ale I think I will buy these many times over.

Aromas of citrus sweet and herbal spicing on a roasty, caramel backbone. The beer is smooth and crisp in mouth, thanks to the carbonation and the hops bitterness. Flavors are roasted caramel and a touch of smoke in the backbone, supporting a resiny, bitter hops profile that highlights alongside a citrus blend of lemon and grapefruit. Very well balanced, with a bitter, slightly drying aftertaste that again showcases some of the herbal highlights. Smooth, drying finish with some of the bitter and spice left to linger until the next sip. As I said of the former Draught Style, this brew is a staple of the APA style. Very tasty, and very sessionable.","GarthDanielson","Sep 21, 2012"

The inverted Glug really made it seem as though I had sprayed hops air freshener and I would be lying if I said that my mouth was not watering. I was looking at a massive two-plus fingers of dense, French Vanilla-colored head with excellent retention when I was done with my pour. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was full of pine hops and now I was starting to drool. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, slightly viscous and the hops were soft, not overpowering as in some (many?) AIPAs. The melding of the hops with the malt was very pleasant and caused me to think back to the mid-1980's when I had this for the first time. I remember thinking that it was too bitter, but now it is just what the doctor ordered for this Jonesin' hophead. Finish was semi-dry and both pleasant and refreshing. I am so excited to see it being CANned and I would recommend it for anyone's cooler under any circumstances. Believe the hype!","woodychandler","Aug 30, 2012"

4.2,4.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"There is a reason why this beer has risen to dominance in the APA field. Sierra Nevada is known for its hops and this pale ale has a really wonderful hoppy aroma. The amber body and frothy head are quite appealing as well. Taste-wise, it's a blast of hops and a touch of pine follwed by an extremely mellowing dose of malts. In many regards, it tastes like the label: Green. This is not a bad thing, but I've found that it is not an everytime beer as a result.","TheRealBigC","Jul 30, 2012"

4.47,10.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a nice clear amber with a one finger white head that receded to a white ring leaving ample lacing. Pretty nice, very true to style. Scents of pine, citrus-zest, slight orange, biscuit-like malt, and floral hop notes. A nice balanced aroma profile of hops and malt, neither overwhelming the other. Very well executed and pleasant. Flavors of sweet malt, including caramel and toffee and some bready, nutty flavors, a moderate level of hop bitterness, with floral, pine resin and citrus zest hop flavors. The citrus zest comes through more on the finish. The finish is dry, with an almost woody flavor mingled with citrus zest and pine. Aftertaste it woody and modestly bitter. A very good, balanced flavor profiling combining hops and malt, with neither outshining the other. Very good. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate-light carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Very easy to drink with the right body for a good session ale. Overall this is a classic craft beer. Its balanced in aroma and flavor, both of which are very well executed in their constituent elements. The nice, smooth mouthfeel contributes to the beers drinkability and combines with the flavor and aroma to make a classic session ale. One of the best easily available craft beers out there.","Auraan","May 28, 2012"

It's refreshing, clean-tasting, crisp, etc. -- all the things the BMC offerings have promised, but has so much more substance and flavor. It's a dependable, solid, go-to beer that is ubiquitous and a terrific value, to boot. It delivers a great deal for its modest 5.6 % ABV. I can understand how it has earned a reputation as a ""gateway"" craft brew, like NG Spotted Cow has become more recently for so many in WI.

I just wish I had bought Torpedo first, as this to me is far too similar to the standard macro-brews available. Perhaps if I ever have friends who need a beer to drink while over at my house this will be my choice brew, but otherwise this one won't be gracing my fridge again.","DeutscheJeff","Dec 17, 2011"

4.03,0,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: Got my hands on one. Usually I like to have a few before I do a review, but one will have to do. The Sierra Nevada has a deep copper color with aggressive carbonation. The slightly off-white head is thick, even and lasts to the end without a lot of lasing of the glass. Flowery hops are big in the aroma and in the flavor. Under the hop flavor there a subtle undertones of malt, and the finish has a bitter aftertaste, but in a good way. The Sierra Nevada is a solid offering that a beer drinker or any style will appreciate.","iSip","Nov 28, 2011"

Head disperses into a broken slick. Nose is very subdued but expresses a light caramel malt character as well as an earthy hops presence. Taste follows nose with that addition of a mild citrus character that intersperses itself through the flavor profile. Moutfeel is light in body with an assertive carbonation that lightly burns the back of the throat. This is my go to beer when I'm out and the beer list is limited.

Slight pine and dried hop leaf aromas with a bit of estery fruit in the malt. Nicely balanced malt and hops with a medium body good carbonation due to the bottle conditioning. A nice lingering hop bitterness that makes its presence known but is not overpowering. Funny how tastes can change, when I was younger and new to beer this beer seemed so bitter to me now after years of drinking what seems to be hoppier and hoppier beers this one barely registers. To me this beer is important in the same way that beers like Sam Adams Boston Lager are important.

It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises grass, flowers, lemon peel, orange rind, and very light toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, with the more citrus-y hops gaining in potency a bit, balancing out the earthier ones pretty nicely; all while the toffee doesn't give much ground. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a very nice pale ale, one that deserves the status it holds.","TMoney2591","Jul 06, 2011"

3.68,-8.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The classic Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I remember sitting at the Keystone Pub when I ordered my first one back in 2007. It was probably one of my first pale ales. I can't recall having one prior to it. Anyway, it pours out as a lightly hazed yellowish gold color. The head is strong and leaves a good lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer has a really nice hop aroms on it mixed with some malts on the nose. The taste of the beer has a good bitterness to it with a dry hoppy aftertaste. When it comes to the mouthfeel it's a highly drinkable beer. It's got a good body to it and it's not overly heavy.

Not nearly as well crafted/balanced as the SN Torpedo IPA, this APA could be smoother and a little more refreshing. It has some positive flavoring notes, but seems a little off balanced with bitter hops and takes some effort to get down the full 12 oz.

In fact, after having this beer, I find myself wishing we had more breweries like Sierra Nevada!

It is no longer a pioneer or a wow by craft beer standards, but it has held up remarkably well as a mild, versatile, enjoyable pale ale. Pours a sunny reddish gold with a slight, quick-falling head and lively carbonation from the bottom. The aroma is pleasantly malty, with a little bread and caramel and a whiff of citrusy hops. The flavor seems almost quaint in this day of punishing citrus hops, but it is clean, crisp, slightly malty with a restrained dose of citrus hops and a mellow bitterness on the finish, with a hint of lemon. The mouthfeel is clean and a little prickly.","Seanibus","Feb 25, 2011"

No really stong smells but what is there is a bready malt with a little bit of pine. The taste is more bready malt at first, but after a while it just overbears your taste buds and it becomes a very bland malt beer. The mouthfeel is too prickly for more liking, and really brings down the drinkability after a while. It is ok for what it is, but not a great craft beer in my opinion.","mcgwire756","Feb 25, 2011"

It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall as I said before, this was my gateway drug. My palate is a lot different now than it was. This brew wasn't overly great, but I can see why I started out drinking this.

Aroma has the cascade hops up front bringing out that nice floral undertone. There also seems to be a little orange present in this also. The flavor is what I would consider to be probably the true American Pale Ale. The malts are present up front along with their counterpart, hops. Nice and refreshing.

There's this great oily and piney hop character in the body and in the finish that's played out perfectly by the sweetness in the malt body. Wonderful semi-sweet finish. I've been getting back into Pale Ales recently, and this beer is probably the perfect example of what I'm looking for in the style. I really like this beer a lot, and tasting it again for the first time I've fallen back in love with it all over again.","eclaycamp","Aug 12, 2010"

There is always some residual yeast in the bottom of the bottle from the bottle fermentation; I like this, and I try to swirl it into my glass. Smells like, well, hops and some biscuity maltiness, and despite the strong presence of hops I feel this beer is well balanced and very drinkable.

While bitter, it is in no way harsh or unpleasant, helped out by good carbonation and a nice crispness that really brings the flavor out and intensifies the aroma. Finish is lingering with a earthy bitterness. One of my favorite Pales.","curasowa","Apr 20, 2010"

Medium-bodied plus, here its relative lack of movement gives it more gravitas. Sweet touch to the orange, grapefruit citrus, floral dimension a bit stunted. Malts undistinguished, smooth things texturally but don't add much flavor, light brown sugar. Peach, apricot fruit demure.

Aromas are faint but pleasant nonetheless. Ditto that on the flavor. You get what you'd expect basically but in small amounts with a good balance between fruit bitterness and pine with some herbal hop notes and just enough malt to hold everything together. The body is mediumish and the feel is slightly undercarbonated. The thing that this beer has going for it is that it's balanced exceptionally well, but it isn't going to knock anyone's socks off. I really wanted more out of it particularly from the hops. This is definitely brewed with the larger market in mind. That being said, it's not bad, there's nothing offensive about this beer at all and I think it's a good training wheel pale ale but fans of more flavorful styles of pales will be well suited to look elsewhere.","apbarwood","Mar 08, 2010"

The aroma gives you a tease of hops but mostly the malty sweetness comes through in the nose. The first sip gives way to that sweet initial taste then it's quickly balanced by the floral hops finishing with a faint bitterness. The mouthfeel is right on target which is on the lighter side of medium bodied. This beer is perfect for complimenting bar food: pizza, wings, poppers, & burgers.

The aroma is dominated by pine and citrus from the getgo, but you can also detect some biscuit and malt in there as well. The taste reveals why so few people have been able to duplicate this pale ale's success; citrus and pine hop flavor gives way to maltiness, which then gives way to a dry finish. Nice medium-bodied and carbonated mouthfeel, with a great dry finish. This beer defines 'session pale ale'.","donniecuffs","Oct 01, 2009"

The beer is drier than I remember, the mouthfeel is quite mild, there is a lingering hoppy dryness in the aftertaste. This is medium bodied, not too thick, not cloying, very refreshing, very solid.

The aftertaste allows the hops to fade with a bubbly mouthfeel that dries and vanishes. My wife offered the comment that the aftertaste made her feel as if she had just licked an envelope. This beer is certainly one to throw in the cooler for a backyard BBQ, but it isn't likely one that I will keep on hand in my beer fridge. I think that I find myself lumping into the ""old standards"" by which everything else is judged and would have to call it average for that very purpose.

The taste is well balanced and follows the nose: Mildly hoppy and citrusy. I taste orange and pine, but it's a gentle taste. A little bitterness comes through after swallowing.

It is good grapefruit though, not the pucker your mouth grapefruit. Mothfeel is medium bodied, slightly bitter, somewhat refreshing and actually very smooth and easy. Very drinkable.

Pretty complex flavor profile for a pale ale, it wasn't a one-note hit as you could sense the malts and a fruityness of some sorts.

But i thought i would give it another shot, as i know i didnt have quite the appreciation i do know for really good beers. Even though im still new to this, I think i have ""matured"" a little in my drinking experience/appreciation. ALL that being said, this is truly a great beer! nice, clean taste, with just a bit of hop bitterness to finish it off, and when i say in the finish, i mean way down in the back of my tounge, almost down into my throat [i may actually prefer just a touch less]. nicely done, and one i will definitely get again. this would be a great beer for drinking several of, for instance during a football game, or after mowing the lawn. pretty refreshing.This one has me excited about trying other APA's...","webbcreative","Feb 26, 2009"

For a pale ale, I thought that the aroma was really good, light malt and hops aroma with a very light hint of sweetness. Taste was hoppy with some pine, malt and that light hint of sweetness. The flavor was really good, way better than expected. The body was light and the beer was very refreshing. Maybe slightly over carbonated, but not really to the determent to the beer.

This is a solid go-to beer that never lets you down, but rarely thrills the drinker.

Big hop aroma up front, tangerines and rockmelons with the malt peeking through as the beer warmed up. A firm hop slap up front with all the fruitiness of the aroma which gives way to a wonderfully round, bready malt flavour. The bitterness is well balanced and gives a crisp end to the maltiness. The mouthfeel is middle to thin with the carbonation just a bit high for my liking. This combines with the relatively high abv to inhibit the drinkability for me. This beer comes with quite a reputation and I'm happy to say it lives up to it. A great example of an APA, able to showcase the hops whilst allowing the malt to shine through too.","goatherder","Aug 01, 2008"

I've been drinking it ever since, so I figured I might as well put in my two cents. It's a great looking beer with a good sized head that laces down the glass, as the beer is finished. What I love most is the smell of this pale ale with its piny/citrusy hop aroma balanced with malt goodness. This taste is usually great though there are times where I noticed pronounced differences in the beer from batch to batch. I've found that this beer can be quite variable in aroma and taste. Usually, it hits the spot perfectly.

The fresh, crisp taste that follows is one welcomed aftershock. This beer also features a characteristic that is hard to find in most others, its highly drinkable over a period of time. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale never loses its allure throughout a day or for that matter, day after day. This is a great ""go to"" beer whether you're entertaining others on a holiday or just want something to sip on during the NBA Finals. Every swig leaves you wanting more of the bitter yet fresh and satisfying taste of this beer. It's very consistent and the alcoholic punch isn't a bad repercussion either.

Light on the malt, perfectly overflexed with hop bitterness, this beer boasts balance. Touch of dessert bread met by clean, citrus bitterness. Pure perfection when following the criteria for what an American Pale should be. I would present this hop cake at any close friend's birthday. Definitely a recomendation for any beer drinker making the transition from tastless, mass-produced, heartless, garbage drinker to craft brew enthusiast.

Hoppy, smooth, crisp, with a bite, you can't go wrong if this is all they have for decent beer. You'll find this stuff everywhere. It's a treat, or it's a last resort, oddly enough.

A hop smell is prevelant, floral and citrus, with some malts in there and a light alcohol smell. Full-bodied and creamy - delicious - with a coffee/bread malt taste on the back, blended with some hops for a semi-dry backbite.

Good opportunity for comparison, as horseshoes is always a multiple beer event. Anyway, the three included my old stand by, Sweetwater 420, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, and Sweetwater IPA. In my estimation, the Sweetwater IPA was the far superior of the three. Better flavor and drinkability. I was struck by how similar the 420 and the Sierra Nevada tasted. However, I think I would slightly give the nod to the Sierra Nevada. Its taste is better than average, with hoppiness and sweet malt balanced. Some cloying straw taste that is also in the 420, but not so much. Interesting that before I started sampling widely from other beers recently, I didn't notice the straw flavor in 420. It was my favorite beer. Now, I would be pretty loathe to go back to it. Luckily, Sweetwater's IPA is so good that I can still give my business to that local brewery.","dhd1491","Apr 21, 2008"

Taste is good, not great though. A good balance of malt and hops leaning towards the hop side. Moderate carbonation leaves a crisp and light feeling in the mouth with a dry and bitter aftertaste. Easily drinkable and has a good flavor do to the hop presence. Overall this is a very good beer, not an amazing one.

I'm not sure if it was the batch or what, but this brew was much more flavorful than my first tasting. The most notable difference is the powerful grapefruit and citrus taste. My original review stated that I could not taste the hints of those flavors, but perhaps it was too cold the first time around. To add to my initial review, amazing flavor of grapefruits and citrus and a bit wild for an American Pale Ale, but very delicious nonetheless.","zerofear13","Sep 02, 2007"

Aroma is piney and hoppy, with the cascade hops overpowering the aroma with its citrusey notes. Taste is very hoppy, but balanced well with toasted malts. Hints of caramel and toffe are noted, but mostly an herbal hoppy presence and a strong orange/grapefruit flavor. Exceptionally mouth filling, but easy drinking. Despite the slightly higher than average ABV, it is remarkably easy drinking. Perhaps the most well-crafted pale ale made in the USA.

Label states bottle conditioning and it shows with perfect ale cabonation that's smooth and tingly on the tongue. Tastes of citrusy cascade floral hops with a sweetish caramel malt background. Malt becomes more aromatic and an apricot fruitiness comes through as beer warms. Here is the template for many an APA. Still tastes great after all these years. If it's not broke....

Both aroma and taste have hints of citrus. Finishes with a nice, slightly bitter aftertaste. This is the pale ale by which I judge all others; I've yet to find a better one among the dozen or so I've tasted. If you live in the Southeast US, try this beer with the chicken fingers and Zax sauce from Zaxby's. It's one of my favorite food/beer combinations.","paulisme","Dec 31, 2006"

The initial taste had major overtones of orange, quickly replaced by bitterness. The hops here seem less about flavor and more about bitterness, yet it never really felt like it got in the way, and the bitter flavor subsided to a much more sweet taste that finished very clean. The end result is a very good beer that is very enjoyable, and being readily available at many places that otherwise only serve macrobrews, it becomes a great choice during a night out at the bar.","olegv40","Dec 26, 2006"

It had a good look to it: dark amber color with a decent, white head that retained throughout the beer. Smelled very malty; did not notice any kind of hops at all. Tasted malty as well; once again, no hoppy traces even noticed in the aftertaste which led be to believe that it was an English pale ale. A pretty nice mouthfeel; pretty thick, similiar to a Sam Adams in regards to mouthfeel. A good, drinkable beer, but did not taste like a good APA; I would have expected at least a little bit of a hoppy taste, at least to balance the malt, if I knew it was an APA when I was drinking it.","maddogruss","Dec 13, 2006"

Appearance is a clear amber color with a head that as white as fresh snow. Smell is typical of a pale ale a mix of hops and malts neither out weighing the other. Taste is crisp , clean with some bitterness. Mouthfeel is not light but malty and smooth. I could easily drink a six pack of these on a nice summer day and be as content as could be.","WeymouthMike","Aug 22, 2006"

Palate is definitely hoppy up front, with a good malty backbone giving it a touch of sweetness. Good flavor. Mouthfeel is light, with a good hop bite. Adequate carbonation. A very refreshing pale ale with strong hop presence. Something short of an IPA, of course, but isn't shy with the hops. Finishes quite well balanced.

Not anything like the European Pale Ales! I'll say that much!

Tastes almost perfect, quite mild, but also very hoppy at the same time, a very very good balance. The only reason I took drinkability to 4.5 is because at 5.6% and how good this beer tastes, it's hard to keep yourself from getting drunk. Really premier beer, I like this one a lot... a lot.

Mouthfeel - full, more carbonation than expected, slight hop slickness coating. Drinkabilty - could pound one after another, or just chill and sip. A good stand-by for hopheads when other things are scarce (owing to its wide availability), and a good gateway to hoppiness west-coast-style to the uninitiated; in short: an American classic and standard.","ultralarry2006","Apr 03, 2006"

Also a bit of a biscuity malty background. This is perhaps one of the most balanced beers I've had. Hops are assertive, yet not overpowering. That bready malty character gives it great body and complimentary flavors. This is a perfect everyday beer as it doesn't get in the way of foods nor is it boring. However, I feel it's a bit too syrupy on the tongue, a little out of character for this style. Would also like to see some more dry hopping for additional aromas.

Light caramel in the nose as well, but pretty much just stinky yeast and dulled hops. I still find the yeast character to be obtrusive upon tasting, though not as bad as the aroma. The malt flavor is very light and grainy and to me, doesnt blend well at all with the mildly aggresive hop flavor and bitterness. The hops which shift from herbaceous, to floral to piney (on the finish) are moderately pleasing, but overall, this is just a poorly balanced beer, plus the yeast stinks or something.","Crosling","Mar 28, 2006"

Drinkability: This is a beer that I tried a long time ago and did not really care for. I decided to give it another try and I purchased a bomber. I still was not so sure of it, but my the end of the 24oz I began to appreciate the hopps(for this reason it got a 4.5 on taste). This beer opened me up to many others, and I feel that it is now my standard for american pale ales.

Afteratste is dry, with a healthy dose of citrusy hops that provide a good balance of bitter and sweet. The mouthfeel is the perfect combination of low carbonation and a solid medium body.

The taste is also fantastic. The hops are obviously the focus of the beer but this does not prevent the beer from preventing some delightful sweet and toasted malts. Again the normal floral/citrus hops are most prevalent but once the beer is tasted the citrus flavor seems to dominate. The mouthfeel is carbonated well with some nice thickness.

The malt base of this tastes like doughy wheat crackers of some sort, or perhaps rye crisps with a bit of straw. The hops bring out a definite grapefruit dryness but also lets in a little green grape and blueberries. The finish awkwardly transitions to a sterile dryness that almost mandates another sip.

2.9,-28,4,4,2.5,2,2.5,"Conclusion- This is not for me. I think its rather overrated. Though well and carefully made, I think they could have hopped it with something better. I think McSorley's Ale, which is much cheaper, is much better hopped with all sorts of subtle flavors coming through (though its really not that much less bitter, the bitter didn't crowd out the other subtle flavors, so I enjoyed that one anyway). I think the thickness is also kind of excessive. Bear in mind, this isn't billed as an India Pale Ale, or an Extra Bitter, or anything like that. Just a regular Pale Ale. Compare it to Bass, the standard of that type. It's just too thick, dark, and bitter for the type of beer its supposed to be in my opinion. Even though American Pale Ales here are described as ""bitter"" vs British Pale Ales which are ""more balanced"" I think this is too much. That said if you want something that's really powerful, really thick, really bitter, and really well made (notwithstanding my own complaints about style and hops) then by all means check this out. It's a manly brew for sure that will put hair on your chest. Me, I think McSorely's Ale is the best American Ale I've tried. Also, be wary of the price if you're not sure whether you like it. It does run you like $7.50 for a sixpack. If you're skeptical, you might want to split it up with some friends (or if you know a good beer bar you can try it there, me I don't recall any place near me that carries this, even in the bottle)","casualbeerman","Jan 04, 2006"

The smell seemed somewhat subdued, though I have somewhat of a nasal cold. This didn't kill my judgement, however, as I could still smell the wonderfull citrusy/hop smell. Also, the retro-olfaction was actually improved somewhat, as the odors seemed to get caught up in all the mucuous from the cold. I will definately be revisiting this from the tap wherever available, particularly if there is nothing new to try (though the bar I had this at, the Sanctuary, still has quite an enourmous selection of beers that I haven't tried.)

Some floral/citrus notes (lemon?) and grains with the malts getting more pronounced as it warms, along with a bit of yeast. The carbonation is crisp at first but becomes smooth. Easy to drink.

This is a better compliment to lighter foods than the porter or stout are, and it's the only SN available at the Albertson's which is close to me (the closest liquor store is 45 minutes away, but I still catch it on the way back from university), so I keep coming back to it.

The after taste is a twang of sharp hops tempered by smooth cream. All over a very drinkable ale. The level of hops may put off some people but it is very well rounded and masterfully crafted. A good beer drinkers beer, great for sharing with your friends, and a good introduction to master crafted ales.","Illini5596","Jan 11, 2005"

Several years ago this was the hoppiest beer I had regularly; since then its hoppiness has been surpassed by others, but I don't think any beer is as well balanced and compliemented as this one.

Drinking it now, at the proper temperature (so that I can actually *taste* it) it's way more nuanced than I'd thought. When ice cold, all that I was able to taste were prominent, citrus hops. Now that it's warmed up, I can taste the depth of bready malt, and the hops seem to be in perfect, complimenting balance.

It felt somewhat bitter on my tongue, but the bitterness contributed to the compexity of the flavors I was tasting.

Theres some floral and some citrus in the hop character...it just comes together and smells good. I guess I have come along since I last sampled this beer. The hop character is nicely balanced with sweet malts. Just a good beer. I would like to see a bit more hop carry through in the flavor, but it doesn't detract from the beer.

The taste was really nice, seemed to be really fresh, resinous hops with enough malt presence to back it adequately. Mouthfeel was about medium-light, and makes the beer really refreshing. This beer had more hop presence than a local IPA I was having afterwards, so I ended up returning to it. When I had it this time it just really seemed to be pushing Pale Ale into IPA territory.

Strong hop bitterness balanced by a sweet maltiness and some citrus flavors. Though not overly complex, I feel this is still a very delicate balance that makes it a very good beer. True to the style, it finishes with strong hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is excellent as well. Light and crisp without being over carbonated or too thin. I consider this a very strong offering worthy of a special occasion or everyday consumption alike. Definitely a beer that any craft beer lover should try.

Initially this beer shows off a barrage of hops, some citrusy, some piney, a just a little that provide some nice bitterness. Somewhere in between all of it some bread and dough like malts sneak their way in to provide a perfect balance. But just as the malts appear, the hops come back into the picture to finish this beer in perfect pale ale fashion, leaving just a bit of spiciness to make you crave another sip.

The taste is a orchestrated mix of malt sweetness and fruit aftertones. The hop bitterness is just enough to appreciate the sweetness. Hints of lemon/orange zest and fresh rasberries linger in the buds. The roasted malt will show its power in the end.This is a medium bodied pale ale and has that nice crisp but smooth refreshing flavor you need in a nice pale. As far as drinkability goes, you can have a 12 pack a day of these, yes they are that good. SNPA is like the Don Corleone of beers. It is the Godfather.

The hops on the tongue are not overpowering and the chocolaty, malty taste comes through very strong. The mouthfeel is medium with a tingle of carbonation that lasts throughout the beer. This is a delightful beer that is a joy to drink. No aspect of it rules which makes it a pleasure to sip with a meal or while typing a review.

The taste was firm and crisp, with a dry malt base that presented a limey zip transition into the clean bitter citric finish. The body was richly full.

The aroma is light but dominated by citric hops. The taste is mostly citrus with some pine and is pleasantly bitter. A simple sugar, candy-like sweetness makes a brief appearance on the palate but the malt doesn't develop like some of the bigger PAs.

The taste backs up the nose with a crispness that hits your throat and all up in your sinsues letting you know this beer is not all about a hop assault on the sense. Qaulity ingrediants and a mild estery flavor from the yeast from bottle conditioning. Yet, after the beer is in your gullet, you are then reminded of where you started, with a dry, citrusy back end from the hops. I could (and have) enjoyed several of these in a setting and welcome each opportunity to do so.","counselor","Dec 11, 2003"

The aforementioned hop/malt balance make this beer go down about as smooth as a beer should, with the carbonation and distinguished sweetness performing a olfactory pas de deux with the pine-scented hops. It's a classic, as it should be, and happens to be the first micro-brew to truly wow me, in Winter, CA, roundabout 1992 or so.

When I play gigs in a bar and I am greeted by a sea of ""lite beers"" on tap, it is very comforting to see the green tap handle there in between the typical brands.. The bottled version is just a notch below the on-tap version, but it stands up well -- probably because it is bottle conditioned... The color suits a beer of this style. It is suitably pale, but has an orangish-red glow that make it very appealing. A comfortable evening lies ahead of me as I sip a few more of these...","BrianOfMayberry","Dec 05, 2003"

Pours a a just off-clear amber, with no real head. Minimal lacing. Nose is powerful, lemon rind and hops. Mouthfeel fizzles the tongue with carbonation and initial bitterness of citrus and hops. Feels pretty nice. Taste is excellent for a pale ale. Pine and some spice are in the background somewhere. Alcohol is well disguised, but definitely lets its presence be known after a couple of these. Some excellent malt flavor balances the hops toward the end of the glass. I've always felt a bitter aftertaste from this brew, but that's not a major issue, especially if you're having it with pizza.

A hint of sweet malt covered by some underlying bitterness provides excellent balance.

The aroma is quite heavenly - delicate, floral and spicily citric, though that does die down after a while into something more grassy and rain like, even a touch metallic. When worked slightly the pale malt aroma does rise, but doesn't last long against the hops. The taste is surprisingly clean up front, but the sweet malt soon makes an appearance, slightly sticky but with a rounded body - a satisfying base from which the citric hops do their work, gradually taking over from the sweetness to emerge dark and tangy in the finish. A very pleasant beer.","SteveP","Aug 07, 2003"

Drink the damn thing if it's 20 years old. It is a delight. Hoppy, but not overpowering. Sweet enough to make it that year round treat. Dry aftertaste indeed. But it has that pale ale citrus flavor that everyone loves. So drinkable, it is a shame more people do not love it. If it takes you more then a day to finish (given that you are one to finish a 6er in a day, extenouating circumstance not standing) you got some problems, cause even the ""Bud-Light Boys"" are down with this delight.

The hops definitely win out over the malt in a big way, finishing off with a big, crisp citrusy note. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but compared to a macro pale, its like a stout. Definitely hits the spot on a warm day (like, say...today!), so long as you are not afraid of a little hoppiness - then again, who in their right mind gets a SN and DOESN'T expect hoppiness. What perplexes me is that my brother, who dislikes hoppiness (he won't even touch an IPA) loves this, and cites it as his favorite beer.","woemad","Jul 08, 2003"

Taste is a pleasant refreshing bitter with a soft golden malt underneath. The yeast imparted an earthiness and combines with bitterness; the flipside is that the yeast creates not the best finish.

Really easy to drink, this brew isn't spectacular, but it's quite good.

The head seemed to last a good way down the glass and produced a sheet like lace at the top and delicately designed lace as it traveled down the inside of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of citrus hops, bitter hops, citrus fruit (lemons, grapefruit), and some sweet malts. The tastes that were produced were creamy in nature, good carbonation and the flavors that came out were of sweet malts, citrus hops, floral hops, fresh fruit (grapefruit), grass, and more hops. The combination of the sweet malt and the hops seemed to keep each other in good balance. It was crisp the whole way through and ended with slight hop dryness.

A bitter, full taste follows the swallow...very yummy. The medium body leaves a nice fizzle on the tongue. Sharp and very satisfying.

This was actually hard to pin down as far as taste for me due to the finish happened to fast and I was feeling and wanting more. I still thought it was good but something was missing for me on the overall taste. Malt was present.

The sweetness mixed with the decent amount of bittering hops does wonders for the soul, if the brewery in Chico had a church I might become a cult member. The hops are grapefruit citrusy flavored that tickle the back of the throat and at the same time the warming feeling of acohol crashes upon the palate just right.

The nose is a beautiful bouquet of grass, hops, and citrus with some later notes of yeast and wheat. At palate entry, spicy bitter hoppiness and leafy, floral notes. At mid-palate, yeasty, caramel malt notes appear. As it warms, notes of bread dough and cracker. The mouthfeel suffers from too much ""spritzy-ness"" and the overall flavor is too bright and citrusy. A very good APA, but would benefit from some more depth and earthy, malt balance. The Finish is crisp, clean and dry.","Riggo","Dec 19, 2002"

I saw that Consumer Reports gave it a good review, so I thought I would try it, and I must say that they know what they are talking about. The taste is ""wheaty"" and has a smooth delivery.

It forms a nice lace-work as it is sipped down. It has a bit of chill haze as well. The aroma is mainly of a citric, spicey hop nose. On first taste, one first noticies to floral, citrus hop flavors. The hop flavors are balanced out though by a biscuity malt flavor. This beer is light-medium bodied, and finishes with a dry hop bitterness that lingers.

Characteristic pale ale malt aroma behind that, which I assume is from pale grain.  Crisp citrus and pine-like hop character hits first.  Specifically, the initial wave of hop bitterness reminds me of a Christmas tree.  Not far behind is a grain-like maltiness, also very crisp.  Just above medium-bodied, but good and complex.  Hoppy, but still very well balanced.  High drinkability, very refreshing.  Wonderful pale ale that is worthy of being considered one of the nation's top microbrews.","hyuga","Sep 28, 2002"

Very nice.The aroma offers bright, fresh, floral & citrusy hops over a light maltiness. The body is medium-light with a fine, crisp carbonation. The flavor is a combination of tangy, fruity, citrusy hop flavors and a very lightly caramel & biscuit maltiness well backed by bitterness. It finishes dry with a short lingering hoppy bitterness and a bready/biscuity maltiness. Extremely well balanced. Very refined. Crisp & refreshing. Highly drinkable.","NeroFiddled","Sep 28, 2002"
4.06,0.7,5,4,4,4,4,"My favorite trait of this beer is the wonderful head atop the beautiful dark amber body when you pour it into a pint glass.  I wish every beer could look this good.  The aroma is a bit of a floral perfume aroma.  You know this one is high on the aroma hops.  Take a sip and you taste just a slight hint of sweetness, and then get more of a grapefruit and lime citrus sensation.  The beer finishes very well.  Bitterness is more prevalent on the finish as the beer warms, but it's not overpowering.  This is a very well balanced beer that even some of my Silver Bullet and Corona drinking friends will finish.  Possibly the best American Pale Ale (Great Lakes Burning River is close).  Get some soon.","aaronh","Sep 23, 2002"

The pour is a light copper with a nice sized bubbly off-white head. The smell is great and features lots of hops, citrus and some yeasty notes. The taste is huge on the hops at first, especially for an APA. This beer is fairly carbonated for the style, and it shows in the mouthfeel, which is rather prickly. To me, this is a very easy drinker and is the trendsetter in the APA style.","Jon","Sep 22, 2002"

The substantial remnants of the head linger to the bootom of the glass; lots of stickly lace, good carbonation.  Strong aroma of grapefruit rind as well as hints of sweet malt.  Begins with sweet malty flavors which are soon overlaid by sharp grapefruit flavors from the hops, finishes with slightly oily hop bitterness, excellent mouthfeel.

The hops jump in from the get go and don't leave until the bottle is empty.  There is less sweetness than you expect, but there are hints of it which help to balance out the bitterness of the hops, which is definately present from the beginning of the sip until the beer is swalowed.

A beer I could (and have) drank all night. Not an example of an American Pale Ale, but the beer which defined the style. We must be careful not to take a craft brew cornerstone like this for granted.

I've noticed dry hopping with Cascades leaves that ""grapefruity"" flavor/ aroma; Sierra Nevada uses a lot of late addition hops for aroma in their PA and doesn't dry hop.   This brew is clean and well balanced all around.  The assertive and clean hop bitterness dominates, but a firm maltiness manages to provide an adequate foundation for the hops.  Yes.

Slightly lacking in malt character in my opinion, which makes this beer slightly unbalanced with the hop bitterness and strong hop aroma.","hooligan","Feb 25, 2002"

4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"The gold standard for widely available American brews. This is the beer, after Sam Adams, that get many people to explore ""better beers"" and to educate the beer drinker as to what a hop is acutally supposed to be used for. Pours out to a nice, amber color in the glass with a decent head. Aroma is that of slight spice, malt and light hops. The malt to hop balance is incredible for a beer of this style and makes for a very tasty beer that isn't overhopped as many of the style are. Starts somewhat malty and finishes with a wondeful taste of hops. Sierra Nevada is an excellent brewer. The Pale Ale is a champ and a staple of my 'fridge.","proc","Dec 11, 2001"
