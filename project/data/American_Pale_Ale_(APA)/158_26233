As several others have said, there is very little aroma. Maybe there's a hint of bread, but it's probably more in my mind than my nose. Tastes of caramel, toffee and just a bit of hops in the aftertaste. The mouth is nice and creamy. Maybe there's something wrong with the tap because this tastes more like a hoppy brown than a pale ale. It's not bad, but rather unremarkable.","MartzMimic","Dec 08, 2014"

Not getting much off the smell which is odd coming from a bottle titled FRESH HOP, this did not smack me in the face like a stone enjoy by would for example. Getting some earthy soil like grassy hops....some pine..tad of sweetness, not much at all here. weird. Taste follows the smell to a tee...pretty one dimensional and straight forward, but not bad at all. grassy...leaves a slight bitterness on the palate after swallowing. very drinkable and enjoyable. Almost a session beer I would say. I feel like I went in thinking this was going to be a giant hop monster Double IPA. For a pale ale...this is good. Medium carbonation and slightly creamer in the mouth. very enjoyable.","Glennlawless","Nov 10, 2014"

Aromas of wet, green hops, with cut grass, pine tassels, a subtle pepper spicing, and resinous bitter notes. Flavors are bitter forward, with a resinous background of pine pitch and subtle caramel notes, with piney, grassy, and subtle citrus highlights of lemon and grapefruit. Very well balanced and flavorful. Smooth bodied, but kept light and crisp with the carbonation. The aftertaste is resinous and bitter, and the caramel rich notes help to balance throughout. Awesome lacing left along the glass. The finish is slightly dry, crisp, and clean. Solid beer, and ridiculously easy to drink.","GarthDanielson","Dec 13, 2013"

The beer is a clear dark amber color with a slight reddish tinge. The beer has a stronger malt smell than expected but the hop smell is not too diminished. The hops have a wet grassy smell to them and slight notes of pine resin as well. The taste is similar to the smell but with a much maltier presence. The hops are much more bitter and a wet grassy taste than the smell but still have slight notes of pine. The malt is stronger than the smell and only slightly offset the hops with a sweet malt taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but on the heavy side with biting carbonation. The feel is smooth bordering on velvety an dis quite refreshing. Overall, a very good pale ale with wet hops.

The slightly breadiness and sweet caramel malt add balance and fullness (not quite chewey but definitely not thing) to a mostly floral/grassy, citric hop beer that isn't sharp or biting but still packs a punch. This is as close as it seems one can get to a hoppy IPA (or even DIPA) without making the hops so dominant that everything else is just outside the lines.

Great divide went for balance and I must say they got very close to perfect. I just wish more smell was present. If you served this to me with any other IPA this would not stand out, until I tasted it. However, this is a very nice balanced IPA, probably the best I've had in the taste category.

Smell is of toasted malt, citrus zest, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and earthy herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a sightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice fresh hop profile but the mouthfeel is a bit thicker than what I was expecting.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 24, 2013"

Lots of pine and dank resin on the nose, some bread, a touch of citrus and grass. Flavors follow the nose. Bready malt backbone, just enough to support the hops that dominate the flavor. I get thick, resinous pine hops with a bit of citrus as well. Great hop presence in this beer. Mouthfeel is dry, yet oily and sticky from the hops. Overall, out of the fresh hopped beers this year, this is hands down the best.","SFACRKnight","Oct 23, 2013"

Interestingly there is a massive malt backbone to this, and it doesn't take away from the grapefruit and aromatic hops. Excellent pale with medium carbonation and slick palate.

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, spice, and spicy hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, citrus, citrus hop, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. The hoppiness aspect going on here really carried on throughout the entire glass in both the aroma and flavor. The flavor was fairly well balanced and inviting. If I hadn’t been on a ticking spree this day I likely would have had a full pint of this one without hesitation. Definitely worth your time trying if you have not done so before.","thagr81us","Nov 21, 2012"

The flavor definitely picks up that dank grassiness in a big overwhelming way. There is some fruitiness in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is decent with good amount of carbonation. IMO it drinks heavy for what I would classify an APA. Ultimately it just didn't do it for me. Lacked nothing in terms of flavor but the flavor just didn't work on my palate. Far too one dimensional with a dank mulchiness that struggled to achieve any complexity.","COYS1984","Oct 27, 2012"

Finishes smooth with just a hint of grapefruit rind and pine sap and a slight bite. Medium bodied with a slick, oily, and slight soapy mouthfeel, perfect for a wet hop ale.

Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick lacing cap that lasts. Good amount of lacing clings to the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up from the bottom. Aromas of huge fresh orange zest, lemon, pine, grass, light caramel, breadiness, and light spiciness. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of big orange, lemon, pine, grass, biscuit, and spiciness. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, grass, pine, biscuit, and spiciness on the finish for a while. No alcohol noticed at all except for a slight warming after the finish. Great balance of bitterness and sweetness. Medium carbonation and body with a slightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Overall this is definitely an excellent fresh hopped pale ale. Very drinkable with nice flavor balance.","superspak","Dec 03, 2011"

There is a purity I detect with this approach, and while these beers sometimes lack the complexity of the more traditional hopping technique, I like the fact we get choices. The Fresh Hop Pale Ale has an orange-copper color when poured, and retains a friendly skim of head throughout my glass. Aromas are full of sweet pink grapefruit with some floral notes hiding in the back. I detect a bit of molasses sweetness on this one, too. Highly quaffable and refreshing with the expected bitterness. Does not totally dry the mouth, but I wouldn't want a pale ale to do that. Seems a bit maltier than the Sierra Nevada Northern Hemisphere but only just.","dannydetox","Nov 21, 2011"

The taste is equally as enjoyable as the smell. Very fresh taste, crisp taste, great hop to malt balance. Leaves a nice hop coating on the palate, I had a hard time convensing myself that this is a pale ale not an IPA. Great beer for hop heads, to put it in a nut shell if you could take the breaking of fresh celery stalks and put a flavor and feel to that sound that is what this beer is.

Really grassy (but in a fresh, complex, vegetal, lightly green way, not in a bad old musty hops way). A little bit of hop citrus on the nose but it is definitely 80% grassy notes. Taste is more of the same. The bitterness is really quite mild as compared to the strong hop flavor. The flavor of the hops really opens up on the palate and I started to get more herbal (mint, chives...) flavors. Malt is present but only as a stage for the hops. Mouthfeel was smooth but nothing amazing. Overall this beer accentuates the fresh hop flavors and gives you something a little different than your basic APA, but not quite the strong bitterness of an IPA. Definitely worth seeking out.","quirkzoo","Oct 23, 2011"

Solid light amber to orange rust color, above average brightness and clarity, minor yellowing at the glass bottom. The nose has some weight to it but, predictably enough, openly weaved with an airy freshness to the wet herbal, vegetal scents, the orange to grapefruit citrus might be the second strongest component, however, still mellow, the pine relaxed too, mild earthiness, no distinct malt scents, you almost make up the cocoa dust out of your imagination. Medium-bodied, fine prickle to the carbonation, makes for an active mouth presence, close to conjuring up mineral water feel and flavor. Pleasant orange, lemon, lime citrus, nothing unduly sweet as regards the peach, red apple, pear, pineapple fruit. More breadth to the cocoa, mocha powder but, again, not more sweetness. Conversely, the hops are green and moist and pungent but not bitter in any meaningful way. Pepper, flowers, pine, earth all artfully arrayed throughout the palate.

Grassy and citrusy just as the label promised. Taste has a ton of hop flavor with surprisingly little bitterness. Citrus and floral hops with a touch of sweetness and a faint malty backbone that provides some balance. Flavor is weird (in a very good way) in the sense that it has the flavor of a major hop bomb but doesn't have that tounge smacking bitterness you would expect. Medium bodied with a nice crisp finish.

Carbonation is nice and full. The beer is medium bodied and stays on the pallet; very smooth. It's been awhile since I'v had a pale ale that didn't have India in front of it.

This beer, which I bought on closeout for $4 a bomber, was definitely worth its asking price and demonstrated more of a $6 beer quality, however, its retail price of $9 is simply excessive and this beer is not worth that much, simply put.

The flavor is not quite as three-dimensional, with more of an emphasis on bitterness and a gin-like pine hop flavor that almost totally crushes the malt character.

Spotty lacing covers the glass all the way down. Aromas are bold - toasted grains, toffee, citrus, and caramel. Tastes are full of character and complexity consisting of biscuity malt, toffee, overtones of citric grapefruit, slight orange, fresh piny hop that slicks the palate wonderfully with hop resins. Finishes slightly bitter with pine and a hint of white pepper prickle on the tongue. Mouthfeel is thin-to-medium, but coats the palate well with low carbonation. Overall, this one grew on me - if it were a 12oz I don't think the additive effect of the hop bitterness would have jumped out at me the way it did during the 2nd half of the bottle.

Hops are indeed fresh upfront - floral and citrus goodness, and then the beer falls flat, somewhere in the middle the taste just drops and isn't balanced well.

Bright hop flavors of pine, apricot, pineapple, and grapefruit rind, attacks the tongue but a swift, sweet maltiness balances out the ale.

The beer presented a more than sturdy malt base and plenty of hop flavor and bitterness without the ponderous, heavy DIPA body and subsequent, downright bothersome alcohol content, which keeps this brew surprisingly drinkable. Of note, however, is the fact that though the Great Divide's Espresso Yeti and Saison I recently purchased had ""bottled on"" dates, the Fresh Hop Pale Ale is curiously missing it, though it is of the new label styling.

Slightly watery at the front, gaining weight as it crosses the palate. It does finish with dryness on the back end. This is a strong pale ale, th e fresh hops are brought on strong and in your face.

The hops are noticed first on the palate, but are enveloped byby a malty sweetness, spice, orange peel and some lingering alcohol heat.

3.81,-6.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"I love the look of this beer, a creamy/rocky off white head on top of a slightly cloudy yellow-orange body. The head loooks really nice. The nose is grassy with a hint of alcohol. The nose isn't as pleasing as some other fresh hop beers I've had recently. The taste starts spicy, kind of piney and then there is a good biscuty malt flavor to hold up the spiciness. The finish is bitter and dry. The mouthfeel is a little too heavy for an APA if you stick to sytle but it needs to be that heavy to hold up the hops.","orsulacp","Jan 29, 2008"

3.75,-8.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste is well balanced with lots of medicinal herbal notes, grapefruit bitterness, and floral honey sweetness. There's a decent amount of cracker malt here with a touch of caramel. Again, not overly complex but a very flavourful APA that definitely leans on the bitter, hoppy side. Medium-heavy body with mellow carbonation, maybe a little bit thick for the style, but nonetheless it's a really drinkable APA, full of flavour, bordering on an IPA in its hoppiness.","trevorwideman","Jan 22, 2008"

Its' most outstanding characteristics are in its taste- nice cherry body, closed out by extremely well-placed hops. Drinkability at 6.1%, with appropriately placed hops, forget about it.

The smell of the initial pour is filled with the floral fresh hop smell that is balanced with a sweet malt aroma. The nose dampens out quickly to a toasted malt and slightly grassy sharpness. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is light-medium bodied. Full flavored, that toasted pale malt flavor finishes with an astringent grassy hop note that lingers appropriately. A really nice drinker. Recommended.","jjayjaye","Jan 06, 2008"

Aroma is grainy and of grass with the sweetness of the malt coming out at the tail end of the nose (rather surprised me). Taste is much mellower then I expected. There is a definite west coast hop presence with the citrus coming out. Just enough hops to leave a slight bitterness on the tongue. The malt backbone really comes out in this and it balances this beer very well. I was expecting a hop monster but was very pleasantly surprised. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slight oily texture and just enough carbonation. A very drinkable brew put out by Great Divide.","hwwty4","Jan 05, 2008"

4.17,2.2,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Looks pretty solid: clear copper with a big frothy head that stands up in stiff mounds. Aroma pungently hoppy - very grassy and herbal with muted citrus and a faint background pine. Not much to say about the malt character - I guess that means it's supporting the hops well: neither overly dry nor sweet nor light or toasty, just giving the requisite beeriness to the brew overall. Hops are foremost in this, leaning more towards flavour and aroma rather than straight up bitterness (although it has enough of that as well). Herbal flavours dominate with some grapefruit pith and raw greens. Mouthfeel is middling, neither light nor heavy, and a moderate carbonation. Maybe a touch astringent though, with detracts a bit from otherwise quite good drinkability.","allergictomacros","Jan 03, 2008"

Upon close review, it is - surprise - very strong with the hops and that expected pine-like fragrance. Flavor is a strong, bitter hop influenced ride. A hopheads liquid paradise. Feel is thick from the high amount of hops and it holds a decent carbonation. Even though it is so pungent with the hops, it is still extremely drinkable.","RblWthACoz","Dec 30, 2007"
3.87,-5.1,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"A pretty solid brew. I would prefer a cleaner ale without the diacetyl, something that reduces the drinkability and overall enjoyment for myself. With that said, however, this beer does a better job of showcasing the fresh hops than another fresh hopped pale ale, in my opinion.

May Mother Earth provide a bountiful harvest!","demcorhip","Dec 27, 2007"

The hops taste quickly was alleviated with a smooth, aftertaste of the earth. Quite delightful! The overture of hops was not as obnoxious as one would expect based on the name, label, etc. The beer leaves you wanting to keep sipping heavily all day, just to keep getting that wonderful aftertaste.

4.13,1.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a striking pale orange/amber color with huge fluffy white head, really nice; clarity is great, though I imagine lots of floaties towards the bottom of the bottle. Aromas are a nice blend of floral, sweet candies and a bright herbal tea. Last year I had this closer to the bottling date and it seemed fresher then, but nonetheless it is hopspectacular with some cinnamon like malt notes in the end. On the palate it hits with a medium body and lower than usual carbonation. For a super hopped beer, this one does have lots of amber and crystal malt balance. The hop flavor doesn't come across as fresh as other beers (Hazed and Infused, MoJo Risin'), but it does have a great herbal foothold that lingers long passed the just slightly sweet swallow. Overall, it's a great beer to look forward to every year from a great brewery, but one that needs to be drunk as soon as possible.","dreadnatty08","Dec 23, 2007"

Its a light pale ale with a nice malty, hop start and a good long bitter finish. Its has slight citrus flavors that are layered under and through the hops. I like it.

Slick oily hop odors dominate the nose. Some mild earthy hop odors as well as the slightest hint of pine. I also detect a small bit of metallic caramel malt which balances our the smell quite nicely. Taste begins with a creamy grapefruit flavor that blends with an earthy grasslike tingle. Midway to the finish is pretty dry and bitter, but not to the point where it takes away from the flavor. Aftertaste is a bit dirty with some mild pine as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a subtle carbonation. I would definitely have to put this one a notch above Sierra Nevada's Harvest Ale.

A real, refreshing grassy, pine-like taste, which probably comes from the fresh hops. If you like Pales and IPAs, do whatever takes to give this a try.","WaveRebel51","Oct 21, 2007"

The nose does impart a good bit of hops. Light on the floral hop, more grassy with a citrus finish. Light caramel character in the aroma. The flavor is classic American Pale. Decent balance of caramel malt with a punch of citrus hops. Floral hop shows more mid way through the drink, and lasts into the finish. More bitterness than I expected in the beer. The mouth feel is slick, just a touch sticky. Decent drinkability. I've had a few other fresh hop offerings from Russian River, Moonlight to name a couple, and this lacks the strong floral character I really enjoyed in those beers. It could be the age, and if so, I apologize. Good enough that I will try again next year, and test the freshness.","carln26","Jan 13, 2007"

There is a resinous sticky/sweet/bitter aftertaste that is almost more interesting than the beer itself. I was reluctant to wash it down. Mouthfeel is light and sticky.

The aroma was typical of the C hopped west coast products, with a leafy and citric hop profile. The hops were backed by the scent of sweet and partially caramelized malt. While not overly strong, especially considering the presence of the words Fresh Hop in the name, the smell was spot on for an American Pale Ale. The taste was well balanced between sweet toffee-ish malt and spicy dry hop oils. Not a lot of bitterness was present, except for a little grapefruit rind like flourish at the end of each sip. Feeling a bit thicker on the tongue than a run of the mill Pale Ale, this was highly quaffable, while not being watery. A well made beer, which was not quire the showcase of hops I was hoping it would be.

Great sticky rings of lacing. Mellow grassy pine and mild grapefruit aromas mingle with understated caramel malt scents. The wet hops give this pale ale a far ""grassier"" taste than most other American versions of this style. There are certainly pine and citrus flavors apparent in the taste, but they are far more subtle than in other pales. As I mentioned before, the hop profile is primarily grassy, with some earthy mineral notes coming through. Slight caramel sweetness, off-dry mouthfeel. The palate is a bit clingy in patches, sort of juicy at other times. Altogether, this is an ""uncharacteristic"" pale ale, that ends up standing out for not being a normal c-hop showcase. Extremely easy to drink, but only with the proviso that this is not a pine-grapefruit bomb. A bit pricey, but certainly worth the effort to seek out.","orfeu","Oct 30, 2006"

The big difference between this extravently hopped ale and say a Ipa is the fresh hops seem to be more mellow and fruity not as bitter. The low alcohol level helps alot in this regard to.

Very balanced flavour with Just enough maltiness to keep the hops in check. Bitterness is solid, but not overdone. Green, grassy, and grapefruit hops are everywhere in the flavour - they linger long into the finish along with a hint of caramel. Slightly drying and creamy texture - there's a bit of powdery character from the hops. Carbonation and body are just on the light side of medium. There's a hint of warmth as well.

It has a grassy hop scent that is bitter and rich, but not over the top. The taste is great. It has a well balanced attack of malt and hops. It has a light crystal and bisquit malt flavor along with a bitter, citrus hop finish. This beer is incredibly smooth and easy drinking. It has tremendous mouthfeel.

That said, for no other reason then this- its damn drinkable. It keeps a nice clean profile overall while grabbing hold with woody, citrus tinted bitterness, and maintains a doughy little malt backing while doing it. Some sweetness finds its way in around the corners, in the middle, and very, very late after the finish. Which in turn helps this become quite a fun ride to drink down. After finally sitting down with this one, it seemed a bit more woody then the others I've had in the past month or so.

Sweet citrusy hops. Touches of caramel malt are there, but its mostly hops. Flavor is very hoppy as well. Sweet, citrusy, as well as a solid caramel malt backbone. Light bitterness clings to the finish, but not offensive at all, along with a very raw hop flavor. Similar to taking hops right off the bine and tasting the flowers. Very tasty beer. Feel is moderate with a moderate to moderate-high carbonation. This is a fine beer. As far as an APA goes, this really is really drinkable. Flavors are really well melded. Nothing to complaing about.","kmpitz2","Nov 11, 2005"

4.69,15,4,5,5,3.5,4.5,"The mouthfeel is the one complaint I have with this beer. Seems to lack carbonation almost altogether. Other than that, the palate is quite refreshing. In conclusion, This is a very drinkable beer: one bomber is not enough.","neonbrown82","Nov 06, 2005"
4.5,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"As far as I'm concerned, this is a fine beer and fits right in with GD's other brews. Well-made, intensely deep and flavorful. This is a rather aggressive APA, but a name only does so much.","Skidz","Nov 04, 2005"
4.38,7.4,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Extremely drinkable for one bomber. Much more than that and my taste buds will be gone.","SaCkErZ9","Nov 04, 2005"

4.53,11,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"Resiny and tingling--my tastebuds are ringing with fresh herb oils: wild bergamot. Citrus skins and drops of pine essence clad in silky malts hug my tongue . Mildly fruity. Drinks like a fresh, clear cider. I find this very sensual with a lingering and enticing aftertaste. It's like necking on a warm lawn.","gbontrag","Oct 30, 2005"
4.57,12,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"A nice offering found here in Greensboro,poured a rich copper with a fluffy 2 finger head that left a nice sheet of lace behind as it settles.The label says whole hop cones are shipped wet overnight to Denver to be brewed the very next day after being shipped and let me tell ya the aroma of this baby shows it.Intense grassy,piney,resiny goodness smacks you in the face and the aromas just continue to linger well after being poured.The big dose of fresh hops are not overpowering in this brew yeah its big and resiny but there is a sweet caramel malt backbone that holds up extremely well.At 55 IBU's its not insanely bitter but the freshness of the hops makes it immensley flavorful,I will be getting more of this very very soon for sure.","oberon","Oct 28, 2005"
3.92,-3.9,4,4.5,4,2,4,"Overall, a very nice APA. A decent amount of hoppiness, but definitely in the APA vs the IPA category. The body brings it down some, otherwise it would be one of the top APAs I've had - as is, it's still up there.","Beaver13","Oct 27, 2005"
4.32,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The beer finishes with a solid bitterness, which does not particularly linger too long. The finish is quite smooth, it really just begs for taking another sip. The overall hoppiness and carbonation of this brew gives it a peppery bite as the beer sits in my mouth. This beer is really quite nice, perhaps the most flavorful Pale Ale I have ever had. The fresh, vibrant hop character is really nice and this beer is still fairly smooth without that intense grassy character I have had in other fresh hop beers.","Gueuzedude","Oct 21, 2005"
