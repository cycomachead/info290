Not much malt flavor here at all, but not much bitterness either. A light, easy drinking, slightly hoppy pale ale is what I have here. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. Good if your desire for hops is light.","Jimmys","Mar 20, 2015"

4.27,11.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Sometimes I'm surprised by beer and this is one of those times. I generally don't expect anything much from a pale ale that is available year round, but this beer impressed me. I originally bought this beer because it was on sale and I think firestone puts out some pretty good beers. The beer pours like any number of pale ales but the flavor is exceptional. This beer balances malt and hops in a way that really lets the hops shine through without being overpowering. Some people might find this beer too hoppy but this is where i find that this beer really separates itself from other pale ales. While maintaining similar bitterness characteristics to similar APA's this beer has exquisite subtle floral hop aromas and flavors that really make this beer enjoyable for every single sip. This is a beer you can sip in while working in the yard yet it still has bold flavor profiles that will satisfy your hop-foward palate. Do yourself a favor and pick  this beer up when it's on sale or featured in a mixed 12-pack and you won't be disappointed.","Jackolope","Mar 14, 2015"

Pours a translucent honey gold with a loose, 1/8th inch bright white head that quickly dissipates to a frothy slick.  Nose expresses a trace of caramel and wet cardboard.  Taste consistent with nose with the addition of some noble hops.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a crisp carbonation.  Overall, I think this beer is past its prime - slightly off flavors.  I wish I checked the bottle dating before purchasing.  Will need to revisit with a fresher offering.","Jwale73","Jan 03, 2015"

3.28,-14.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.25,3,"Firestone Walker's ""Pale 31"" pours a rich pale color with an appropriate carbonation. It has the strong aroma of Turkish delights (for those of you who have tried these tasty and gooey little sugar cubes) that also radiates sugar, white rose, and perhaps under-ripe apricots. The first sip comes with a head that wont quit and a particularly artificial flavor that comes with low-end canned beers like PBR, albeit this flavor is light. A larger mouthful reveals a weak body with a mouthfeel like many other light beers. The flavor is the sweet and bitter you would expect from a pale ale that disappears quickly. The aftertaste however, is this beer's saving grace. This lingering flavor is that of light and summer sweetened hops and some malt that brings you to have another, and yet another sip. This beer is nothing to call home about, but certainly not at all bad.","REDsage","Jun 23, 2014"

The aroma is sweet orange with some malts and hints of tropical fruits. The taste is some bitter orange peel, floral hops and malts. Slightly bready. A tad watery. Malt finish with more floral notes as well as some orange peel. Light mouthfeel, but it's expected considering the low ABV. This is a highly drinkable Pale Ale that would be great for summer. Hoping this gets canned one day. Overall, one of the more flavorful, lower ABV Pales I have had in awhile. I'd buy it again.","PicoPapa","Jan 19, 2014"

4.37,14.1,3.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a light amber with a thin white head that receded to a white ring leaving no lacing. It looks okay, but not as good as some. Scents of citrus-zest, pine resin, grapefruit, and faint hints of floral hops and malt. A bit more hop-forward than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, with more citrus, grapefruit and pine. Very good, but not as balanced as Sierra Nevada's. Flavor begins with a moderate level of hops, with bitter citrus-zest, grapefruit and pine dominating. These flavors stick around throughout the sip. Towards the middle a bit more floral hop flavors come through in the background, but not heavily. Malt is present, though on the breadier, grainer side, not much sweet caramel or toffee like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Finish is dry with citrus-zest, grapefruit and pine resin dominating. Aftertaste is bitter with a grainy malt flavor. Pretty good. More hop forward and less balanced than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but not in a bad way. It certainly doesn't hurt the flavor profile, it just makes it a different take on a pale ale. Mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp and semi-drying. A bit less smooth than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, more of an IPA mouthfeel, but not bad to drink at all. It makes you want to drink another sip right after you finish. Overall this is another good American Pale Ale. While not as balanced as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, it has a good aroma and flavor profile that balance more towards the hop-forward side of things, while still keeping a sessionable ABV and providing a good drinking experience from the mouthfeel. I recommend it.","Auraan","Dec 06, 2013"

Flavor follows with what can only be described as a bad wheat beer or hefe. Dirty wheat finish, bits of citrus and banana, a touch of sweet citrus hops. Light mouthfeel.

Strong apple aroma with underlying citrus tones. Mixture of apple and citrus tastes. Nice balanced hops taste that hits you midway through. Bitter taste that retains on your tongue when done. Not too bitter, though. Hops are moderate, perhaps a little stronger than most pale ales but not quite as strong as most IPAs. Overall a very good beer, becoming one of my favorite go to session beers. One of my favorite pale ales for sure.","jngrizzaffi","Sep 26, 2013"

A bit of lemon candy and pine are in effect as well. Mellow bitterness on a pale, salt water toffee like malt notes. Medium bodied, well carbonated, semi crisp.

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/15/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, floral, light grass, light pine, light honey, bread, and floral earthiness. Very nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Light floral pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, light pine, bread, and light honey after the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is damn good session pale ale! Very nice balance of hop and malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. No complaints at all, really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Apr 24, 2013"

Aroma of citrus hops and sweet malt. Flavor is grassy hops, light citrus, biscuit malt, finishes with a grassy hop bitterness. Light bodied as expected from the style. Flavor is light, but well balanced; an enjoyable, refreshing pale ale. After drinking some hefty darker strong ales and stouts the last week, it's nice to sit back and watch active carbonation in a nicely made light golden beer.","LiquidAmber","Mar 19, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, with the citrus blending together into a tasty little tropical smoothie, the parts indistinguishable from the whole. In a good way. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice pale ale, highly drinkable and even more highly enjoyable.

Along with the intense sweet, floral aroma, the dry hopped finish creates a superbly delicious dry aftertaste. Besides the hops, the beer is low in maltiness, yet has a nice light bready flavor.

4.12,7.6,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Firestone Walker Pale 31 pours a brilliantly clear goldenrod, darkening towards orange when the beer's less well lit. A light dusting of white foam caps the beer, but doesn't provide much opportunity for either head retention or lacing. The nose has a nice floral aroma, offset by some juicy grapefruit notes. It doesn't quite jump out if the glass as much as it could though. The flavor is fantastic, just about perfectly balanced for a pale ale. There's a solid foundation of caramel sweetness right up front. The bitterness that comes through is enough to let you know it's there, but definitely stays short of IPA level intensity. The hoppy close is that classic floral, citrus grapefruit flavor. If I had to nitpick, I would say that the finish could stand to be a little more intense/vibrant, but it's pretty close. The body is nice, a little bit solid while not becoming too heavy for a sub 5%ABV beer. The carbonation is definitely a touch muted though. Pale 31 is another reminder that I should consider myself lucky to have Firestone Walker readily available locally.","axeman9182","Sep 06, 2012"

It's fairly easy to drink, and thought it is 4.8% alcohol, it has a good bite of bitterness to it, and the hop profile is more in vein of an IPA, though probably more drinkable to the average beer drinker. I think beers like this are really important for the craft beer market... a mid priced 6 pack, that is quite drinkable, and could possibly win over some drinkers of more commercial beers. Taste wise I feel like this tastes like a very mild IPA, and because I love IPAs, I think this is a great introduction to stronger and more hopped up beers.","ely2000k","Dec 17, 2011"

It for sure looks like a legit pale ale, the body looks nice, pretty standard but nice, the head is now gone, and I was not impressed with it. Overall an ok look, but nothing special. Nice northwest hops on the smell, very clean smelling, nice and hoppy with a good malt note as well. Probably some fruit, maybe grapefruit, along with a citrucy smell. It smell very good, pretty excited about the taste! Well, for the taste, the first thing I get is a nice mixture of clean water and quality malt up front, and then it finishes with a nice hop bite. There should be more hops in this, and frankly more flavor, but overall it's pretty dang tasty. For sure and clean and refreshing beer, nice on a hot day. I don't know if the taste deserves a 4 or not, because the taste isn't too big, but it is really tasty and easy to drink.

In any case, this was good stuff. The photo on the bottle was ""right on," as the beer poured gorgeous gold into the glass with a nice had that quickly dissipated and left very delicate lacing on the glass. Very subtle fruity, piney hops were evident in the smell and that carried into initial taste. Nice balance of sweetness (very light) and the aforementioned hops, with a moderate malty body, punctuated by delicate carbonation. Those are two words I'd use a lot with this beer: delicate and subtle. Nothing ""in your face"" about it. No alcohol taste at all, with a very slight dry bitterness at the end. I never put the glass down--and it tasted great right through to the warmer last few swallows. It's an excellent session beer you'd never grow tired of.

The label is interesting but not crazy. The bottle has sort of a classic look. I like that they maintain their design across most of their beers. I don't love Firestone beers, but I like that they don't use each new beer has an opportunity for a new label design. Sometimes, that works, but not many other craft beer companies (admittedly, Firestone is rather large now and probably has a lot more budget for marketing) have such a solid, consistent look.

The malts have a light bready malt taste, that's matched first by piney, citrus hops, and then later a spicy, long-lasting aftertaste.

3.79,-1,3,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"The beer does not look like I expected. it is light reddish gold with almost no head. I've never seen a pale pale ale really, but here it is. The smell is dominated by hops. Rose hips, pine resin, and green tea, with a sweet note underlying it all. The taste is refreshing and, again, floral. The hops dominate but not too hoppy. The aftertaste is completely dominated by hops. The beer is refreshing but a bit astringent. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, despite its appearance. The carbonation adds to the crisp taste to make this a very refreshing brew indeed. The drinkability is good. The alcohol content puts this one into the realm of session beer and the crispness reminds me of a dry cider. This is a good beer and a good primer on what aroma hops are. I need to find a beer newby to use this as a lesson.","roblowther","Jun 07, 2007"

More than normal for the style. Also a small amount of sweetness there too. Reminds me of a toned down IPA. Taste is also very nice. Hoppy up front, leading the way to a roasted malt flavor.

It had a wonderfully smooth feel but quite lively taste. Nice blend of favors.

I get notes of apricots, some peach, and of course some of the typical citrus notes. The aroma is just quite striking, and I really like the mix of fruit character that the hops evoke here. The taste is pretty light and refreshing and has a light sweetness to it that really helps to accentuate the fruity flavors from the hops. The hop character is definitely dominated by a fresh fruity character that is most evocative of peaches and apricots. This is really quite nice.","Gueuzedude","Jan 25, 2006"

The aroma is rather nice, though I get mostly malt - just a trace of a fruity-piney blend, probably hops and esters, it doesn't knock me out but the maltiness is good. The flavor is great - absolutely tremendous, a delicious rich grainy maltiness with some toffee and caramel notes followed by a clean bitterness that compliments the flavor very well. This is clearly a pale ale although its balance seems tilted toward the malt a little more than normal. I think this is awesome.","KroMagnon","Jan 03, 2006"

I could smell it as soon as I opened the bottle, and it just got better when I poured it in my glass... aromas of pine and citrus, a wonderfully fresh and hoppy smell. The taste is relatively mellow and smooth... it may smell like a hop-bomb, but it's actually a very balanced beer... definitely a Pale Ale and not an IPA or a typically overly bitter West Coast Pale Ale (yes, a generalization, but often true in my opinion). While mellow, the taste is actually quite full and rich... it's initially mildly sweet with a grassy flavor, followed by a malty middle with hints of lemon peel. The finish lingers with a mild bitterness, earthy, woody and root-like flavors. A beer that's very drinkable, and can simply be enjoyed... but take some time to notice the subtle complexities of this well-crafted brew.","apintofknowledge","Nov 10, 2005"

Aroma is citrusy hops, with inviting esters of orange, tangerine, and grapefruit. Malty caramel is in the background, and there is a hint of vanilla from the oak barrel fermentation. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with crisp moderate carbonation. Taste features juicy citrusy hops, with orange and grapefruit lending a soft bitterness. Caramel and toffee notes serve up a pleasant malt balance. A hint of oaky vanilla adds a nice touch. The finish is clean, with a lingering grapefruit hops bitterness that is soft and mild.
