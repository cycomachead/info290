Aroma sinks into my schnozzola and delivers bright, lively hoppiness. potent West coast pine and citrus along with some more East coast tropical fruit and juicy notes. Just a little bit of neutral maltiness but this one is clearly hop perfume. The flavor is simply so bright and lively it's such an enjoyable experience. Very complex hoppiness. No one hop descriptor dominates. Citrus, grass, pine, pineapple, some passion fruit and some mango. This one has plenty to latch on to. Finishes with a nurturing bready malt and a long lasting hoppy grass/fruit combo. Medium bitterness. Light bodied. Long aftertaste. Carbonation adds drinkability. This lived up to the hype for me. West Coast meets East Coast hop profile. One hell of a Pale Ale.","VelvetExtract","Feb 20, 2015"

Fruity on the front of the tongue followed by pine resin. Biscuity malt backbone but takes a back seat to the hops. Light bodied with light carbonation. Finishes dry.

Pours somewhat hazy golden, slightly darker than straw with a fluffy one finger white head. Aroma is well balanced though amazingly hoppy for a 5.5% pale ale. What really sets it apart here is that super fresh hop aroma that is reminiscent of very fresh Pliny. Big piney dank hops overwhelm the senses. On the palate there is big grapefruit up front that turns into lots of piney dankness. Wow, this is dank as hell for a pale and also more bitter than I expected. Similar hop profile to Duet imho, just accentuated in different ways. A delight and lives up to the high expectations. World class west coast APA.","spark3148857","Jun 10, 2014"

The modest level of carbonation gives way to a light body that at times is watery in a way that does not distract from the experience but increases it's overall drink-ability. I am pretty sure if this was made available to me on a regular basis I would pound it. The depth of flavor encapsulated here is impressive, I thoroughly enjoyed how much hop flavor it had without being excessively bitter for an APA.

The flavor profile follows the nose with concentrated citrus, stone fruits some bitter hop bites and a beautiful glance of light biscuit.

4.57,2,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"This poured a really nice orange/amber color, displaying excellent clarity and effervescence. It had minimal head (given that it was a 5 oz. pour) that left some really nice, sticky lacing. The aroma on this brew is insane! My first impression was ""oh my god!""; my girlfriend thought i found a bug in my glass, haha. This one is so intensely tropical. I'm getting big peach, lemon, orange, and mango. So good, it's almost unreal. The taste just follows suit with the nose. Very heavy on the tropical citrus fruits, peach and orange taking the forefront. There is also a perfect hop bitterness that bites the tongue, which is very piney, but is mellowed out by a hint of malty sweetness. This leaves a really nice hop oiliness in your mouth. It really reminds me more of an IPA than a pale ale. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, and somewhat dry. Just how i like my pale ales. Overall, I am going to have to say this is my favorite pale ale I have had so far. I really wish I would have grabbed a growler of this, but I did get a mixed case of Nelson/Pure Hoppinness, so I can't complain. And there's always next time : ) Anyone seeking this out, do yourself a favor and go to extreme lengths to find it. It really is worth it. Cheers!","BrewtifulMind","Nov 14, 2011"

The smell is much fainter then I had expected and really had to stick my nose in it, pun intended. Smells sweet citrus and almost musty. The taste far over powers the smell, there is a floral bite with a tangy citrus. Good cabonation with a fairly dry sticky finish. Great beer, absolutely perfect sitting out enjoying the outdoors.","BdubleEdubleRUN","Aug 07, 2011"
4.54,1.3,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: This is pretty damn good. There are four pale ales I find worth my time, every time.

You can trust them to do right by the hop gods.","KickInTheChalice","Aug 05, 2011"
4.47,-0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours clear, light to medium copper in color. A somewhat rocky white head slowly falls back to a ring, lacing my pint glass. Incredible hop aroma, a mix of citrus and sweet berries, ripe sugary sweet grapefruit like you'd find where its grown, not bought from a supermarket. Tangerines, oranges, grass, hay, and some light sugar sweetness in the aroma as well, one of those hoppy beers where you are continually sticking your nose into the glass to catch more of the aroma. Taste hits up front with some orange sweetness, cotton candy, grapefruit and grassy bitterness towards the finish. Light to medium body, bitterness is pleasing, not over the top, but just slightly puckering and dry to keep you thirsty, a perfect balance to the touch of malty body on the tongue. Crisp hoppiness with some zing left on the palate in the finish. This after 5 days across country in a growler, impressive pale ale, very sessionable, delicious.","hoppymeal","Jul 30, 2011"

4.67,4.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"O: There are many things I love about this beer, but above all: this is truly identifiably a pale ale. It has a hop character, but I wouldn't take this for an IPA. The malt really has strong control over the flavor experience. A wonderful combo of pine nut malt and light bitter floral hops is outstanding. This is a member of the nobility of the summer time session ale kingdom. A very fancy pale ale, but humble with simplicity. Incredible execution here by Alpine.","Cavery","Jul 25, 2011"

Smells of citrus hops a plenty and this translates beautifully into the taste. Lost of bright citrus with no malt. Mouthfeel is perhaps a touch thin, but if these other assholes were not drinking this with me, I would drink all 64oz. myself, just kidding, but not really.","Lunch","May 15, 2011"
4.57,2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Medium lighter body, decent carbonation, dry and refreshing while drinking. This is easily the best super hopped session ale I've had, and it easily surpasses stuff like SD County Session, GF Citra, and others. I wish I could have this all summer.","xnicknj","May 15, 2011"

4.38,-2.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Have had this on tap more times than I can count on my hands and toes. The color is golden, slightly bronzed, and always carries a nice frothy airy white head. The smell to me is more of a green, earthy smell, with only a tiny bit of citrus hiding in the background. The hop flavor over the palate is spicy, slightly juicy, again just a touch of fruit or citrus. This is not a sweet/bright/citrusy/tropical beer. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side as to be expected. Being a somewhat small-batch beer, it varies a bit from time to time but it's usually a must get anytime we see it.","MiScusi","May 06, 2011"

4.33,-3.3,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Smells grassy with a shot of grapefruit. Definitely San Diego style. Taste hits you with a dry, full bitterness at first but after your tastebuds are shot you can start to get all the hop flavor. Lots of grassy grapefruit and citrus peel. Reminds me of making a hop tea. It's like they boiled this thing, took all the hops they used and squeezed out all the wort from them and fermented that instead. A tiny bit of toasty caramel to relieve your tongue. Low to moderate carbonation makes you think the beer is a little thicker than it actually is.","BearsOnAcid","Apr 27, 2011"

Served from growler into a Stone nonic. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and a very subtle roastiness. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew just plain excellent in all aspects. I have been wanting to try this one for QUITE some time and glad that I finally was able to. The nose on this one was nothing short of excellent. The flavor, well balanced and excellent in all aspects. If you haven't gotten your hands on this one before it is definitely worth seeking out. You won't regret it!","thagr81us","Apr 18, 2011"

Definitely more like an IPA than a pale. Smells fantastic! The taste is bitter hops with muted biscuity malt. There is a faint citrus presence accompanying the bitterness that moves this APA dangerously close to IPA territory. The malt does a great job of balancing the bitterness mid-palate and the finish is dry and bitter without lingering too long. Very nice. Feel is medium bodied with an excellent level of prickly carbonation. Wow! I likey! At 5.2% Abv I could enjoy this in copious amounts on a regular basis. Yet another incredible Alpine Ale that I wish was bottled and available year round. Highly recommended!","Sideswipe","Feb 23, 2011"

4.55,1.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a super clean golden amber with a large white head that lingers. Looks fantastic. Stronger hops come off the nose than expected, pine and resin, maybe a touch of lemon. So far so great. This beer is more straight forward bitter than any APA I've ever had. Really smooth, with a more generic hop bitterness than the nose implies. Thicker than expected in the mouth, in a very pleasing way, with solid carbonation. They did a great job disguising a 5.25% ABV beer in the mouthfeel as something bigger. To me, that is an impressive feat. Aggressive bittering hops limit the drinkability slightly as an APA, but yet it otherwise presents itself as a 6-7% ABV beer, increasing the drinkability quite a bit with its lower ABV. Really, one of the best 2-3 APA's I have ever had.","seeswo","Feb 19, 2011"
4.45,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,3,5,"A fresh growler provided by Alex, drank from a Cigar City snifter... The body is a bright dark clear gold with a beautiful off-white head. The head rises a few fingers and settles with a nice cap, decent lacing. Crystal colors and contrast, looks great... The aroma is very sharp, at the most basic level its a mixture of catty/dank and sweet amarillo like hops. Other notes of pine and lemon, very good. Its sweet but dank... The taste isn't as sweet as the nose, more of steady hops throughout, not super bitter though. Light grapefruit on the front. This is an apa that tastes like an ipa but drinks like an apa. Has to be one of the most flavorful drinkable 5% beers out there. The aroma is outstanding, well worth trying. The aroma is more of 4.75 and taste is more a 4.25.","jrallen34","Beers"

4.87,8.7,4.5,5,5,4,5,"Pours a slightly hazy, bright amber color with a two-finger, frothy white head. Head retention is very good, as is lacing. Tropical fruit and citrus really shine in the nose, with pineapple, tangerine and mango notes coming through. There's a nice cracker and caramel malt aroma underneath the hops. The taste is much the same, with pineapple, mango and tangering fruit flavors melding nicely with a substantial cracker malt with a slight caramel sweetness. Alcohol is unnoticeable. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Drinkability is off-the-charts here - this really hits everything I look for in a sessionable beer. The flavors are refreshing and interesting with a very nice balance, though, obviously, this leans to the hoppy side. Overall, another incredible hoppy beer from Alpine. Every time I try something new from this brewery, I am more and more impressed. This might nudge Alpine slightly ahead of Russian River as my favorite brewer for hoppy beers.","WeisGuy","Nov 17, 2010"
3.7,-17.4,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a clear, darker straw-gold color with minimal white head and a bit of lacing. The aroma isn't too powerful, but is slightly spicy with some bitterness in there. It is light-bodied with generally light carbonation. Taste-wise it is slightly bitter with some citrus and somewhat astringent pine. The aftertaste is bitter and somewhat yeasty too. Personally I thought this tasted really good at first, but I tired of it rather quickly. Seemed to be a bit too much yeast in it, and I suppose it didn't impress me overall. Not a bad beer, but it pales (pun, haha) to Alpine's other similar offerings.","mithrascruor","Nov 05, 2010"

But I kid. There's a little bit of a light biscuit/cracker-like malt flavor, but it does nothing but provide a brief respite from a wonderful hop character. Thanks a lot, Chris. This makes 99% of the IPAs out there superfluous. I'd have to say this is one of my favorite Alpine beers yet, probably up there with Nelson and O'Brien's IPA. The last beer I drank a growler of, solo, in one sitting, was Younger. And that's very high praise.","DefenCorps","Oct 31, 2010"

It seems like they've crammed every single hop variety into this one and then balanced them all out perfectly. The taste is similar with some really well defined hop notes. I got the most out of the tropical hops, though Amyliz4 got more from others. This is just stupendously well done with a beautiful balance between bitterness and drinkability. This is probably the best APA that I have ever had. Thanks again, Mike--I really owe you one.","Thorpe429","Oct 28, 2010"

Upfront the hops and pine flavors were the stara with citrus grapefruit and slight pineapple co-stars. even though it was pretty hoppy the malts did come thru to balance out the hop bomb which was is really a pale ale;great job. the brew was light to medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a nice slight sweet but bitter hop crisp finish. it drank very good and IMO can become a epic session beer chiilin in the hot socal summer sun.","Gobzilla","Aug 20, 2010"

An inch of sudsy, frothy foam tops the body and retains nicely for the duration of the glass, which was admittedly brief. The first whiff displays huge tropical fruit and citrus hop aromas. Pineapple, papaya, a plethora of words that begin with P. Also mango maybe, which begins with M. Malt character is faint, possibly even imaginary. The taste is explosively hoppy yet quite dry and nuanced, with a light biscuit malt foundation barely perceptible beneath the hops. The hop flavors range from tropical fruit to fresh pine needles to juicy citrus. The body is light, but this has a ton of flavor. It finishes with a silky smoothness, only moderately bitter really, and with incredible balance. This is exceptional. Superlatives and Alpine seem to go hand in hand.","largadeer","May 23, 2010"
