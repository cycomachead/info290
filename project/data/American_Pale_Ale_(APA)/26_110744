It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises cantaloupe, bright grapefruit, white grape, honey, peach, and passion fruit.  Feel the fruit salad!  The taste takes a slightly different path, opting for grapefruit zest, mild orange peel, light greens, and mild honey-laden biscuit.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, pretty durn nice pale ale, though the smell writes a bombastic check the only good flavors can't quite cash.  That being said, I could definitely see drinking plenty more of these if given the opportunity.","TMoney2591","Apr 04, 2015"

They continue to evolve into the best there is and if they can get their beer into all their markets on a more regular basis I wouldnt have anything bad to say about them.

I'm not saying this beer is bad, but I can see similarities regarding the hop and malt profiles. This beer is much more balanced and well-rounded.

They obviously specialize in this style of beer, and here you are gifted a nicely tropical, fruity, and airy beverage.  The hop to malt balance was well maintained, although the grain bill seemed to push back a bit more than your typical APA.  YumYum, however, is certainly not their best, by any means, but the juiciness is unmistakable.  One oddity that we did happen to note was this buttery popcorn seed aroma and flavoring.  This added a curious slick, oily dirtiness to both of those aspects of the beer, tending to ruddy it up a bit into what we would coin as a “farmhouse pale ale”, if we could.  It is just that dirty and grassy, giving this very organic and very down-home feel to it.","TheBrewo","Nov 03, 2014"

The brew smells mostly like floral and citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) hops, and some bready/grainy malt.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some melon and orange peel noticeable.  The brew has a nice bittersweet finish.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick, smooth and pretty easy to drink.

Smell has a really fresh hop aroma with notes of herbal hops, fresh melon, and hints of strawberry and blueberry aromas. Taste follows the nose with more herbal hops melon and berry flavors and a pretty big herbal hop bitterness. Very light grain flavor lets the hops shine. Mouthfeel is crisp refreshing then persistently bitter well after the swallow.

I think that the sum is greater than the parts here, but I'll have no issues crushing this 6 pack over the weekend.","kevanb","Sep 26, 2014"

Taste has some bitterness abiding the ride down. Some tartness and pucker from the hopping that is loosely balanced by the malt and backed up with a nice bite of bitterness. A nice break from what we have come to expect, and probably will go down as an excellent summer drinker and Yum Yum does its job well of being a ""sessionable"" beer that very unfortunately does not list its abv on the packaging.  At 5.5% or whatever it actually is, its not exactly a true session ale of the kind you can keep the glass running at half full for the day, but it's pretty tasty and worthy of some dead animal perched in between some bread and for getting a shine on with. And, yes. The label art work is top notch, and hilarious.","MostlyNorwegian","Sep 23, 2014"

Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and floral aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and earth flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but simple in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 02, 2014"

4.08,1.7,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"I was just happy this was still on draft when I got there. Bright golden body with a two finger white foamy head. There's a bit of sweet citrus on the nose but it really isn't too pungeant. The taste is explosive. Sweet and bitter citrus peel and citrus juice. I had to ask if my tastebuds were correct and indeed they confirmed that this is Mosaic hopped. Mouthfeel was nice and slick with a little resin. The malt is there for balance but it really steers clear to me. It's all about showcasing Mosaic hops, and that was certainly done. I still like Annica a little better, but I'm very happy to see a sessionable APA use of this hop. Well done Floyd's, well done.","PHBoiler","Feb 11, 2014"

Better than gumball head, pride n joy, and jinx proof. Another amazing beer from an amazing brewery. It has joined the elites such as APW, permanent funeral, ZD, and Alpha King in terms of ales.","kindbeer","Jan 22, 2014"
