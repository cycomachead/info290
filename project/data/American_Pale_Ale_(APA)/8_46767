Doesn't have much head, but I don't suppose it's meant to--and I HATE excessive, "show-off-y" head anyway! Wouldn't hurt if the hops were slightly more bitter, but I don't mean that as a criticism; the ale's compatible with its own type.","mweinrich","Jun 22, 2013"

Nose smelled minty with a caramel/biscuit undertone, much like a Girl Scout Thin Mint. Mouthfeel was medium and the mintiness of the hops was immediately discernible on the tongue. It again begs the question of where does an APA leave off and an AIPA begin. As a self-avowed hophead, I have no problem with this sort of thing, but it surely was hoppy. Finish allowed the caramel/biscuit malts to get a chance to balance things out and they did so, nicely. A pretty good beer.","woodychandler","May 27, 2013"

This would be a great beer to introduce a beer noob to the awesomeness that is hops. It's not too bitter, but the hops are definitely in the nose, which is how I got into hops myself. Although this isn't a remarkable beer, something is to be said about its balance and drinkability.

Nose expresses caramel malt, a faint citrus character and perhaps a trace of earthy hops towards the back. Malt is much less pronounced in the flavor profile and citrus intersperses throughout. Earthy bitterness comes out at the finish and gradually dissipates between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a crisp carbonation that leaves some residual tingles on the roof of the mouth.

I can't believe I'm enjoying a Widmer beer this much, since I haven't been too impressed with their stuff up to this point.

(I usually enjoy a little fruityness in the background of a beer, but this was odd) The aftertaste wasn't very pleasing either. Mouthfeel was fine, just how a pale ale should be.

Admirable mix of pink and white grapefruit in the nose, floral with chamomile tea notes, spoonful of pine sap, no herbaceous nor ultra-sweet elements, stays within itself and on message, you could sniff it for some time. Medium-bodied, however, most of it is palate pressure and a sense of marching forward rather than flavor. The grapefruit and tangerine citrus starts things off well, after that there's momentary pine, green hay, wet stone aspects. But after that it's evanescence leads to homogeneity. Credibly, the carbonation ratchets it down to fit the body profile. It's drinkable enough for a bottle or two before your mind starts to wander.

Taste is on point, I get almost a peach-like tinge that overtakes the palate, followed by a decent amount of some citrus from the hops. Malt backbone is light enough to let the hops dance around on the tongue. Great mouthfeel on this, a bit slick and wet, yet holds up on the tongue smoothly with decent carbonation and bitterness.

The flavors were equally hop oriented but much less fruity and floral. I tasted the hops again first followed by some sweet, doughy malt and a little wood followed by the tropical and citrusy hops that made for a clean finish.

There are grassy, earthy hops and another aroma in there it too. Others have said spruce, but I think it almost smells like a whiff of mint. The same characteristic translates into the taste.

The flavor takes on a sharper but less flavorful bitterness. It warms up with more bready malt, oak and some salty grass with nice, tastefully refreshing carbonation. It is mid to light bodied, quite decent stuff and plenty drinkable. Generally a reasonable pale ale for sure, not the best, but better than most I would say.","Durge","Jul 29, 2009"

The one thing I did appreciate about this beer was a unique citrusy, peach/apricot flavor that I enjoyed. I will probably buy this again.","ancientelixir","May 24, 2009"

Smells very citrussy and pithy, grapefruit and lemon come to mind. Lemon hits the palat first, with a fair bit of grapefruit and hints of pith in tow. A reasonable amount of caramel malt helps to balance the hops, with hints of breadiness too. Smooth light to medium body with moderate to low carbonation. Very very drinkable, even for the style. Simple and balanced, some may well view this as a bit pedestrian. But nonetheless it's a solid APA and much better than I expected.","MrHurmateeowish","May 14, 2009"

The taste was nice because the hops came through initially but it was a surprisingly balanced pale. The nose prepared me for a near ipa style, but it was nice to have the balance between the hops and the malt.

Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium (a bit thick for the style), but with a good carbonation level.

Red copper color just deep enough to hold your gaze and get past transparency, nice fade to burnt orange hues along the rims. Admirable mix of pink and white grapefruit in the nose, floral with chamomile tea notes, spoonful of pine sap, no herbaceous nor ultra-sweet elements, stays within itself and on message, you could sniff it for some time. Medium-bodied, however, most of it is palate pressure and a sense of marching forward rather than flavor. The grapefruit and tangerine citrus starts things off well, after that there's momentary pine, green hay, wet stone aspects. But after that it's evanescence leads to homogeneity. Credibly, the carbonation ratchets it down to fit the body profile. It's drinkable enough for a bottle or two before your mind starts to wander. If the palate could match the nose, that would be something.","farrago","Feb 09, 2009"

Flavour is great, lots of fruity hops and a nice caramel sweetness, not overly sweet as to be cloying though. Bitterness is very understated and smooth, its there but doesnt bite if you know what I mean. Pretty light bodied for a beer of 5.7 % ABV. Carbonation is medium. This one falls somewhere between an APA and an IPA. Its to strong and hoppy to be an APA but just not aggressive enough to be an IPA.
