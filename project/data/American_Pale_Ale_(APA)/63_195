4.85,24.4,5,5,4.75,4.5,5,"Exceptional beer. Beautifully balanced. I poured a 12 oz bottle into a tumbler, 15 days shy of the "Best by" date on the bottle. Great color; amber, golden, orange-ish with a little bit of a haze. I poured it fairly aggressively and only got about a 1 finger head, (which didn't stick around too long). A lot of bubbles coming up from the bottom. A very pleasant, inviting smell. I could smell the hops but it was a subtle, gradual aroma, not an all out hop assault to the nostrils. The malt presence was also subtle, but definitely there. It was not obliterated by the hops, which I found nice (for a change). I would have given the taste a 5 but not for a slight, (very slight), dry, graininess in the finish. A perfectly balanced beer. Maybe just a little on the dry side for my tastes, but even as I write that I can't help thinking I'm probably being too nit-picky. This is a great beer. I would (and will) make this a "go-to." Very sessionable at 5%, looks great, smells awesome, tastes outstanding... what else is there?","sremed60","Apr 03, 2015"

There is a distinct chill haze to the amber/orange body. Mirror Pond leaves distinct tendrils of foam lacing as it moves down the glass. The flavour is wonderful - biscuit, malt, and hoppy. There are definite grapefruit notes that do a great job of quenching your thirst! I first enjoyed this beer on tap during a scorching hot Idaho day. Today, it helped cut through the heat of a spicy Italian pasta dish. Mirror Pond is equally suitable in either situation and I imagine it rise to any occasion.","Bunman3","Feb 02, 2015"

4.13,5.9,4,4,4.25,4.25,4,"Overall, we are finally getting around to reviewing this west coast stable of beerdom.  We were first able to sample this about two years ago, on a road trip out to Colorado to visit some friends.  Having never seen Deschutes before that moment, this became an obvious first choice when we hit that first brew stop.  We happily and rapidly sipped that first six-pack at altitude, but neglected to take any notes worthy of rating.  Fast forward to now, and we stumble across a second helping at a Meijer in Sandusky, Ohio, while visiting Cedar Point a month or so back.  Here we are, with the meaningful rating baton in hand.  This here is your quintessential no-nonsense pale ale.  The nose comes across freshly and seriously, with no unnecessary inclusions or deviations.  The flavoring is describable in much the same way, but is a bit more to the sweeter and more biscuity side of life.  Fill in the gaps with straight quality, and that is really what you’re left with.","TheBrewo","Jan 27, 2015"

There's notes of hop bite, caramel, oak, and flavors of red meat and sausages.  I can't explain why, but after drinking German weizens, Belgian doubles and triples, or roasty porters, this beer knocks it out of the park.  No harsh after bite or lingering tastes.

They were flavorful but subdued enough to taste the other flavors (wheat, lemon/orange peel, coriander). If one is looking for a good pale ale, look no further. I probably wouldn't buy a six pack because of my sensitivity to bitter beers, but I can rate this one on its own merit - it's good.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Sep 12, 2014"

The by-now predictable outcome was a pseudo-cascade, followed by the production of three fingers of dense, rocky, tawny head with great retention. Color was a deep-amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled primarily of grapefruit, but underlain by a light mintiness. Mouthfeel was medium, kind of soft on the tongue. The taste was mellow, kind of tea-like, with a light citrusy tartness. Finish was likewise mellow and unobtrusive. If I could only have one APA forever, it would NOT be this one.","woodychandler","Jul 15, 2014"

3.8,-2.6,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.75,"To be honest, this is a pretty good beer. For me, this is a porch sipper. It'll do well for bbqs, firesides, and boating trips. It's better than anything you'll get from the big name brands and it's just as smooth, add in the fact that it has better ingredients and was perfected by people who seem to have mastered their trade and you've got a better beer to hang out with than the competition "porch sippers." The flavor is a little lacking, so I wouldn't consider it something i would celebrate with or look for on an extensive menu, but it's a good six pack to have in the fridge for the end of the day when you're not looking so much for flavor, but for refreshment and a reprieve (the ABV'll get ya there). All-in-all, good beer, my friends. Deschutes gave us another gift with this one.","ASirahSyrah","Jul 15, 2014"

This apa pours a beautiful reddish brown hue with very little off white head. It does retain a nice film and a very nice lacing. The nose is quite deep and malty but with a pleasant hoppy bitter bite and a little roastiness. The mouthfeel is very light and smooth. Almost a bit too light. I'd love a little more coating and chew to this beer. Maybe if it was unfiltered, this may be perfect. The flavor is very balanced. Malty sweetness, hoppy bitterness, and an almost funky belgian yeast flavor all play together beautifully. This is an excellent apa and just makes more excited to taste the other two Deschutes offerings I bought last week.","lochef81","Feb 24, 2014"

Aroma complements malts and hops so well, slight sweet breadiness, herbal, pine, and citric notes complement the soft baked bread qualities. Pungent hops reach out to the nares as it warms, really nice American pale ale that's been around since 1988, wow!!! Flavor is amply hopped but round, malts mild sugar coated hops, fresh baked bread, biscuit quality, a hint of chalky yeast packet...herbal rolling hops, citric notes, pine earthy dankness is mild yet expressive in the hop components of this beer. I grabbed a sixer without hesitation when I saw this one at one of my local stops. Mouthfeel is packed with crisp flowing carbonation carries light hop resins across the palate, not much going on but the feel is very natural no forced over carbonation on the palate perfectly balanced well engineered pale ale with character all day. Overall this is the bread and butter of this great brewery out of Bend Oregon someone started making this at home in the 80's and had a eureka moment.","WVbeergeek","Feb 15, 2014"

It's a good beer, but there are many Pale Ales out there today that surpass this one.

3.79,-2.8,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pours a murky orange amber hue with considerable off-white head that leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is classic APA, citrus, gooseberries/black currants, tangy caramel malts and a little toasted grain. Palate follows the nose, with some brown bread, gummy candy sweetness and toasted grain propping up orange marmalade, green grass, mint, and chamomile floral notes along with a little pine resin. A bit chewy but skewed towards crisp and dry. Finish is like a high-quality semisweet citrus soda, clean, crisp and smooth. A little pine and fresh earth accumulate on the palate along with another bitter flavor that I am having some trouble placing ... Its a bit seltzer-like or chalky/medicinal in character. Well-balanced between tangy rich malts and classic American west coast aroma hops. Very true to style, not tropical and dank like many American IPAs but certainly has citrus twang and ample 4-MMP character (the chemical compound that gives American hops a "black currant" character). Find this brew as fresh as possible to get more of the bright top note flavors. Great session beer and something I will bring to a gathering of the beer proletariat to introduce them to the world beyond shitty macro-lagers.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 23, 2013"

A nice bit of grapefruit or mango here to go along with the caramelly malts. Finish is not as clean as I had hoped. Not bad and easy drinking brew that went well with baseball.","BMMillsy","Oct 12, 2013"

Not an overwhelming smell - little hoppy and malt smell. The taste was of course full of the cascade hops, but a pleasant carbonation along with a mild fruity background. I did find a bit of an odd after-taste. However I countered that by not waiting long between tastes. A very nice pale ale which is nice in the summer as refreshing with enough hop flavor - Deschutes is a reliable brewery in my mind.","BradMacMullin","Aug 28, 2013"

Aromas of cascade hops (grapefruit, flowery and spicy) with a nice grainly, bready barley aroma in the background. Taste is balanced between an upfront Cascade taste with plenty of bready, clean malt with a crisp slightly bitter finish. A very smooth mouthfeel, a well balanced APA, hoppy but restrained with plenty of malt goodness. Medium bodied and carbonated. Overall, a flavorful easy to drink APA, balance is more towards the malt than the hops compared to many APAs I come across now. Well crafted brew.","deebo","Jul 20, 2013"

Mostly a floral-soapy hop aroma, toasty pale malt just sneaking in underneath, to balance.... The floral-soapy thing certainly comes across in the taste, refreshing, matched against some pleasant lime/grapefruit hop flavors - supporting malts show a bit more here, but never really give the esters and hops much of a fuss - bright/lightly tart bitterness, bit of an English esb/pale flavor quality.... Smooth, quite clean light-medium body, maybe a little round-maltier than drier than desirable in the finish - but having a little fat is no crime...

It definitely is on the sweeter side, although the 5% ABV and easy drinkable aspects make it a classic beer of its type. This one in particular is the most balanced of Deschutes' offerings, and a crowd pleaser. Want to find a gateway beer that will turn people on to craft? This is one of the main ones to pick for sure.","magictacosinus","Mar 08, 2013"

The nose comprises light grass, flowers, and light toffee. Almost nothing makes it all the way to my 'strils, but I do get the general idea of some of it (I assume). The taste brings in more of the same, amped up to proper volumes, and with some additional mild orange zest. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish.

4.08,4.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by 9/5/2012. Pours hazy golden orange color with a very nice 2 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, pine, herbal, floral, caramel, pineapple, biscuit, and light toast. Pretty nice and pleasant aromas with good balance; but they are a bit muted. Taste of orange, grapefruit, biscuit, pine, caramel, toast, nuttiness, floral, and herbal spiciness. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, biscuit, caramel, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great hop flavor balance with malts; and a very nice robust amount of flavor for a 5% beer. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is an excellent pale ale. Great amount of flavor; with nice hop and malt balance. Extremely drinkable and smooth. My glass was gone a bit too fast. Really enjoyed this.","superspak","Aug 16, 2012"

It's reddish body isn't typical for an APA and it's got a heavy dose of malts and a little fruitiness that work in tandem with that initial hop push to find a great balance. Even my friends that don't typically go for hops or pale ales can get into this one.","TheRealBigC","Jul 30, 2012"

I hope hell is this soft when I get there! You can smell the hops right away, some mild citrus fruits aromas with some wheat mixed in. Its got a medium-to-light body and is crisp on the tip of your tongue with mildly tangy kicks when it hits the sides and back of your mouth. The hops are present and very welcoming and like those overbearing mother-in-laws or grandma’s that always say” here you go, have a little more food, you’re too skinny”. The aftertaste is nice and smooth, the hops pick up a little more and there’s a slight grapefruit taste in there too.

A lot of pales seem to sacrifice complexity in order to appeal to the standard "light" drinkers. Sitting on the back of the tongue this beer begs for another sip. Excellent color adds to the pleasure making this an all around enjoyable beer, a great beer to bring to a party or to take the edge off a long day.","StevieD2","Jun 08, 2012"

Hints of lemon and a raisen or two in the bouquet. Perhaps a raisen bread pudding. Certainly nothing obtrusive for the olfactory to experience. Nice, mild flavor with lemon citrus being noted most easily. At first, I was a little disappointed with the mouthfeel. I wanted it to be a little more wet. But, after having given the beer a few pulls, I realize that the scrubbiness and just the faintest dustiness accentuate the flavor of the beer. There is more of a bitter feeling on the back of the tongue rather than a discernable flavor at the finish, if you will. I like it. I wish it was just a fudge cheaper though.","DocJitsu","Apr 14, 2012"

Aroma is malt, cascade, cereal, fresh all grain bread dough. Flavor’s about the same with the sweet grains, bold hops and a little carbonic tang framing the picture. Body and carbonation are good.

It has one of the best heads I've seen for this style. It smells wonderfully of hops with floral and citrus qualities. The taste is even somewhat perfumey with some lemon zest flavors and, of course, the pale malt. A very solid pale ale indeed. So pleasant, it feels like it should be had a a tea party.

I’m guessing that it’s the English-style yeast strain that Deschutes uses, which has never really been a problem for me until this beer.

3.77,-3.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Two fingers of straight ahead, basic off-white to tan foam, loosely constructed and infused throughout with larger bubbles, simmers down evenly, you get a sheeting effect on the glass sides at first that just keeps gliding rather than break into stickier streaks. Somewhat cloudy reddish orange hued liquid, consistent throughout with hardly any color loss at the rims, a few strands of bubbles here and there. Settles into your nostrils snugly and confidently, no great fanfare just multigrain bread, biscuit, tea leaf, green grass and pressed flowers, lowkey milk chocolate to toffee accents, a brush of apple, peach, pear fruit and then a splash of orange peel, fits together nicely as a whole with no one element dominating. Medium-bodied, similar user-friendly and balanced, knit-together presentation, little bit of pepper and maybe ginger spice or soy, then wet green hops and earth. The more you sip the more the bread, biscuit asserts itself, more dough than raw grains. It's smooth enough already that it does not need the malts to do too much work in this department, hence the chocolate, vanilla and peanut brittle mostly under the radar. Nothing unusual about the carbonation, brings some fluff as much as churn. Mixed white fruits, moderately surprising you don't get more citrus but nothing unsettling. Maybe a tick more bitter at the end than needed, otherwise delivers a compact, clear message of a brew which can be consumed in good amounts.","farrago","Apr 11, 2011"

Minimal lacing. Big aroma of biscuity malt. Hop aroma is also there, though not as pronounced as the malt. Mouthfeel is quite nice, with a level of bitterness that surprises you given the aroma is mostly that of malts. Adjusting to the level of bitterness the malt opens up, with caramel sweetness hitting all the right notes. Grapefruit and spice add hop character. This is quite a pleasant pale ale. I really like the mouthfeel, it's not watery, almost slick, and very enjoyable. My only complaint about the beer is that it's relatively standard for a pale ale, with nothing that really stands out.

Citrus hops leads the way but is quickly balanced by the sweet, caramel malt. Bitterness is moderate and seems to just right for this beer but it does linger for a little too long in the aftertaste.

I get pineapple and citrus notes. The taste is well rounded. The hops and malt strike a nice balance so that you seem to taste both equally. Bitter, fresh hops dance on your tongue and the malt provides just enough sweetness to make this one very refreshing and easy to drink. Carbonation might be a little on the light side for me but not by much.

Almost has a barleywine esque matly aroma but its very faint. Tastes on point with the style. Not over hopped, or over malted, balanced and crisp.

The flavor is very crisp, but the hops are virtually non existent. This would be fine if the malt profile was a bit cleaner, but there is some mustiness that holds it back from really being an easy drinker. Bitter finish.

Nose is underwhelming citrus, floral and butterscotch. Mouthfeel was medium and was a little sticky. Taste was woody, sweetness of some citrus, particularly lemon and a mildly bitter finish.

Good hoppy aroma here, but not overpowering in anyway, less grapefruit than I was suspecting, cut some citrus notes are there with a lightly malty component in the background. Good balance on this pale ale. Tastes more like an English style, but the American citrus-like hops do show up on the clean bitter finish. Malts are very mellow, not much sweetness, and pretty well balanced. Carbonation is just about perfect for this lighter bodied brew. Easy drinkin beer, light bitterness made this bomber go quickly.

The flavor is bready malts with notes of lemon and a little mild herbal hops off the back. Mouthfeel is light and round, smooth and slightly dry. That a bit surprising as I was expecting it to be a bit more assertive, West Coast brewing practices being what they are. Altogether a pleasant, decently crafted offering in a very very broad field of similar ales.

The taste was nice and crisp with a good hop bite. After drinking a bunch of hop bombs lately it was refreshing to get a nice hop bite that didn't shred the tongue. Overall, it's a solid beer that delivers great taste without tricking it up. At 5.5% it could be a session beer or just a nice couple beer change-up.

The sourness isn't exactly unpleasant, but it doesn't really add positively either. The flavor is good with a nicely balanced malt base and moderate hop bitterness, leading into an acidic and bitter finish that is relatively long lived. The aftertaste also picks up a hint of sourness as it warms up. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with nice dry texture, lively carbonation, and a slightly astringent finish.

The sourness isn't exactly unpleasant, but it doesn't really add positively either. The flavor is good with a nicely balanced malt base and moderate hop bitterness, leading into an acidic and bitter finish that is relatively long lived. The aftertaste also picks up a hint of sourness as it warms up. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with nice dry texture, lively carbonation, and a slightly astringent finish. Overall this is a nice, clean pale ale that goes well with a variety of foods, especially grilled meats. It isn't too overhwelming, and the flavors are generally good but not overly complex.","walshclimb","Aug 29, 2007"

Poured a pale orange with a great looking head and thick, sticky lacing. Smell was candy sweet hops with some pine resin and sweet toasted malts. If this beer is only one thing, it's balanced.

The brew is slightly cloudy with just a few stray bubbles making their way to the surface. Taking a smell, I get moderate caramel sweetness, with even a touch of honey. This is backed by sweet orange and lighter grapefruit citrusy hop, even a light kick of peppery hop as well. I like how the sweetness of the malt is a little subdued and lets the juicy-smelling hops shine through. This one has good balance. The first sip brings caramel and grapefruity sweet hop. This moves to a more full caramel after swallowing, with a very nice moderate hoppy bitter that clings on the finish, but not harsh and offensive. The aftertaste is very orangey citrusy to me as well, leaving a nice dichotomy between the bitterness and the sweetness playing on my tongue. Mouthfeel is moderate with a light-moderate carbonation. It is not light, but definately nowhere near being a heavy beer, and I think it hits the mouthfeel very well for the flavors. I think this is a very solid example of an APA. The hop and malt flavors and aroma are in synch with each other, and its something I could make a nice session out of, so this one is a keeper in my book.","kmpitz2","Jul 03, 2006"

Up front... it falls short toward the end, which was pretty disappointing after the first mouthful. Actually, I'm finding the larger the sip, the better/longer the aftertaste. Duh. Anywho, good hop attack up front, malts playing nice in the background, giving way to esters and citric bite thats not really a bite, but a hold, that lets go and eases into a finishing hop oil that isn't too outward, but still nice.

Bubbles are visible slowly rising throughout the glass. It has a nice crisp and hoppy aroma. Floral scents help to give its hop smell a very well balanced appeal. The taste at first is a bit disappointing and thin. But as the beer warms, its citrus flavors become more apparent. In addition the presence of a hoppy kick at the end, added to a slight bitter bite, help to complete its flavor. In the mouth, this beer has a lot of carbonation. It is not very full, but its flavor does linger for quite a time on the palate. Overall, this is a good Pale Ale. It is not overdone at all and, hence, very drinkable. Balance is the key to its success. I would say that on those occasions when a moderately-hopped up and tasty pale is desired M.P.P.A. would hit the spot.","macpapi","Aug 12, 2005"

3.29,-15.6,4.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Poured a rich deep gold almost amber ale with a thick slightly tan head that subsided slowly. The aroma is of fresh floral hops with distinct fruity esters mixed in. The taste is bittersweet on the initial taste with a clean cascade hop flavor supported by a sweet carmel malt but the initial impression is on hop flavor not bitterness. The absence of high alpha hop roughness gives credibility to the pale aleness of Mirror Pond as the hops are deliciously there but not to the point of being an IPA. The mouthfeel as with other Deschutes brews is great when concerning the carbnonation and carbonic bite but in terms of body i belive this is lacking but not of making this beer poor. Very drinkable but i like the black butte or quial springs for a session beer instead of htis one as the hops could become less distinct after the first pint.","RenoZymurgist","Oct 20, 2004"

Every bar, every grocery store, every 7-11 and Plaid Pantry... luckily, it's a good beer and deserving of its popularity. It, along with Sierra Nevada, may be the premier American-style pale ale, or at least the West Coast version. It's full of malt, full of hops, well balanced and drinkable, but manages to pack a slight punch. The mouthfeel is smooth and filling. I don't know if the beer is bottle-conditioned but it feels like it. Pours a tawny orange with great head and lace; hops dominate the flavor with fruit flavors that marry well with the sweet malts. Despite the bitterness, the finish is on the sweet side, and soft fruit flavors linger, such as peach or mango. It is an everyday brew, although for an ordinary beer it is lucky that we have one as tasty as this. Many cities have to make do with Bud or Coors. It may be a drawback to some that it absolutely must be poured into a glass; it just doesn't work from the bottle. A beer not to be overlooked.","Thrasher","Oct 17, 2004"

Taste intially hoppy with slight citrus and grass, fades off to a sweet middle of bready thick malts then dries out to a lingering bittersweet hoppiness that keeps a touch of zing on the tongue. Good finish with lingering hop spice and resin oils sticking well but light and nonabrasive. Feel is close to a medium body, albiet somewhat on the lighter side, still has some creamy, slick and quiet carbonation, and a dry, slightly spicey hop finish.

4.25,9,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,5,"Overall Impression: On par with their Black Butte Porter, this is one of my favorites that I've tried. Delicious. No complaints at all about this one! In fact, I really like this beer a whole hell of a lot!","GreenCard","Jul 12, 2003"

4.3,10.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall a very good APA. Too bad this and Full Sail Pale Ale aren't available here. They're 2 great Pacific NW APA's.","PhantomVodoo","Jun 30, 2003"
3.67,-5.9,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Originally sampled on 21 August 2002. Had this at Deschutes' brewpub while in Bend, OR. It's hoppy w/ a nice nose. The pour is a cloudy amber color. It finishes fairly well balanced. This is a pretty good American Pale Ale. I would definitely have this one again.","jcalabre","Jun 13, 2003"
3.88,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This one pours a cloudy amber color. A bit of a head, but it did stay around for a little while. Fairly decent aroma of hops to the nose. Flavor is well balanced, with a fairly decent hop bite at the end. It gets high points for being crisp and clean. Not spectacular, but a decent Pale Ale.","Boto","May 22, 2003"
4.32,10.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I love this beer. The flavor starts calm, slightly hoppy, however once swallowed, the tongue gets the true delight. The "copious" amounts of hops linger well after drank, and leave you thirsty for another gulp. My favorite part? Could be the fact this beer goes unfiltered, so a generous amount of yeast builds to the bottom, convincing you to finish each and every one opened to get that blessed B-12 rich hangover antidote. Highly recommended.","Delephant","Mar 30, 2003"
4.3,10.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pairs well with asian foods, and with trivial pursuit, or whatever it is you do in the evenings with your drinking buddies. Another good Oregon beer.","freed","Mar 11, 2003"
4.03,3.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Very drinkable a good session brew for those that like to tatse hops hops hops","Reidrover","Mar 01, 2003"
3.85,-1.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Nice Pale Ale. Tap is a lot better than bottle. The 6-pack I bought tasted a lot more hoppy than I memember the draught was like at a local restaurant. I didn't like the hoppy cascade flavor, not when it says Pale Ale on the label. But, still enjoy it.","Fabric8r","Feb 18, 2003"
3.79,-2.8,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,4,"(P.S., Seven years later, I'm a little embarrassed with this review. Now that it's becoming prevalent in my hometown market, I intend to review a freshly tapped pint someday soon.)","feloniousmonk","Jan 12, 2003"
2.81,-27.9,4.5,3.5,2,3,3,"Due to the mildness I consider this is more of a ladies beer--my girlfriend really likes it. However it is not so bland that I couldn't knock down a few of these and enjoy it.","zacharius","Jan 12, 2003"
3.27,-16.2,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours pale orange amber with small quickly fading head. THe aroma is mostly hops, although not powerful. A bit citrusy, a bit floral. The flavor flip-flops being mostly malt. Ver bread-doughy, like multigrain bread. The finish is dry and short. The palate is soft. The beer is a bit thin in flavor for my tastes, but it isn"t bad.","aracauna","Jan 11, 2003"
4.05,3.8,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This fine offering from Deschutes in Oregon poured a nice deep amber.  Lace was wispy from a decent head.  I liked the hoppy aroma and while I expected a more prominent hop finish I wasn't let down.  This beer was very smooth, refreshing, and drinkable.  The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side otherwise I say go for it.","Mark","Sep 08, 2002"
4.18,7.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Nice golden, somewhat cloudy amber color. Head leaves something to be desired though. No head also means no artistic lace on the glass. The only good part of that is that it'll be easier to clean the glass if I forget to rinse it out. Good flavor that is both malty and hoppy, but not too extreme either way. Good beer, in my opinon, but I think the cheesy hop embossing job on the bottle needs to go.","sinistersteve","Sep 04, 2002"
4.42,13.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Mirror Pone Pale Ale is Dischutes best beer. Not to malty and grainy, but has just the right amount of bitterness to bring everything together. The flavor seem to get more complex as it got warmer in the glass.","BeerManDan","Aug 05, 2002"
4.67,19.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"I think one of the best American pales out there.  Many breweries stay ligth on the malt to bring out more hop flavor, but Mirror Pond has a great malty character to balance out the wonderful flavor of the Cascade hops.  Love this stuff.","beernut7","May 04, 2002"
3.67,-5.9,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Heavily hopped...noticable on the nose and the buds...good fruity hop notes...citrucy...bittering units are much higher on this one than their other pale ale I would assume.  Nice frothy creamy head that settles nicely...cloudy gold in color....tastes like it was dry-hopped....a spicy, fruity ale without enough malt backbone..decent and more adventurous and flavorfull than their other pale ale (Cascade Ale), but not as balanced.  I prefer the other one (Cascade Ale) even though it lacks this flavor because I see this as a little unbalanced...","ZAP","Apr 06, 2002"
4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"A very good APA.  Overall well rounded flavor,  Nothing outstanding it's ground.  However, nothing particularly special about it either.  What else can I say, but you are about to drink a very good APA?","Jordan","Mar 20, 2002"
4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a GREAT americal Plae ale. I think Elk Baiter mistakenly pickdt up a bottle of nail polish instead of Mirror Pond. There is no way this stuff and be considered dry or bitter. It has a lovely rounded maltyness if anything a small tiny touch of sweetness. With a understated bitterness and only a small hop flavor.  If you find it you must try it, it is just good beer.","mattmaples","Sep 18, 2001"
