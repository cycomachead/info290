"New favorite for me, great refreshing rye"

"O- plenty of flavor from this pale ale, with a nice kick from the rye addition"
""
""
""

"While I get rye notes this was just an everyday pale ale."
"This is the least rye tasting rye brew I've had. However, I really like it. The floral smell introduces a floral and honey taste, leaving an oily and slightly bitter after taste. As a pale ale, it's great. It's an every day drinker, but not at $2.25 per bottle at the store. I'd drink it again."
"O: A solid pale ale. I have been passing this one up in the beer store and I'm sorry I've waited so long to give it a shot. A new go to pale ale."

"one of the terrapin staples, and one of the firsts beers to bring rye into my world back in the day, so i like this one quite a bit. it used to be real intense on the rye, but i think the rest of the industry has caught up to the point where this seems almost light in that regard. a nice hoppy pale, and the rye gives it a lot of earthen character, definitely distinct, although i would not go so far as to call it spicy, which is what we usually use to describe the contribution of rye. its more of its synergy with the hops that makes this one unique. its balanced like most terrapin beers, meaning in this instance that the hops and the grain are both flavorful all the way through, not like a malty front end and a hoppy finish, its not like that at all. the beer is just a tad sweet, and the hops are a little generic to me, you know, C varietal stuff, but the composition of the whole is excellent, and a landmark really. not my favorite terrapin beer at all, but one of the ones i respect the most."

"My first go to pale ale that I still enjoy from time to time."

"Something about the flavor profile in this beer just isn't working for my tastes.  A little sweet upfront with alot of earthy and black pepper flavors (if that is what I'm tasting) and a crisp slight bitter finish.  I've had several rye based beers and none have the smell/tastes I'm picking up in this one.  Many other pale ales and lighter rye based beers I'd prefer over this one."
"While it may not be some all star beer that people rave about, this is one beer that I could drink any day. Pretty well balanced. Very drinkable."
""
""
"This is one of the beers that got me into hops and craft beer. Solid beer. Very drinkable."
""

"Pours a clear amber with producing 1 1/2 fingers of off-white, frothy, somewhat lasting head that leaves some patchy streaks, strings & motes of lace. Aroma is grainy, toasty & floral with bitter & spicy notes of rye, piney hops & a faint hint of grapefruit. Taste is earthy grain, toast & rye mixed with earthy  citrus & pine.  Produces a low-moderate bitter across the tongue, front to back, with a floral, grapefruit, piney resin & light pepper mixing with spicy rye & pale/lightly toasted malt background producing a nicely bitter, dry finish. Unusually the bitter does not linger in the predominantly but shortlived malty aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, dry, drawing & peppery. Pairs exceptionally with spicy boiled crawfish."
""
""
""
"A solid, rye-y rye pale ale. Nothing over the top; just good, mellow rye flavor and moderate carbonation for an easy drink."
""
""
""
"Drinkin this in New Orleans at Le Bon Temps Roule!"
"Pours a nice clear orange color with off-white head. Rye, spice, floral notes, and some citrus on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with rye and spice. Very nice, just a good amount of hop bit but enough caramel malt to round it out."
""
""
"the fuck happened to the tick rating?"
""
""
"The label states ""The South's Original"" and features a banjo playing terrapin a la The Grateful Dead.  The ale is very good but hardly original or distinct.  The rye does give it a little extra flavor sometimes missing in other mild, low-hopped pale ales."

"Overall:  A solid pale ale that is complex, but doesn't fall apart which helps it to stand out."
""
""
""
""
"color, and lacing.  Taste is bland skunk adjunct.  Not an old bottle btw.  Drink by 12/14...."
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"It tastes like a citrusy APA with a rye twist, not otherwise, just to spice things up a bit. Though, it increases through out the degustation. Really well crafted beer that is worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- pretty good, great color a nice dry flavor.  I would order this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice copper hued ale with a sticky white head and good lacing, smells like rye, biscuit, and citrus. Taste is nice, starts off with citrus flavors something between lemon and orange, then as the rye comes on the taste is of apple and then the spicy rye which lingers afterward. Nice beer very solid, if you like rye seek this one out."
""
""
""
""
""
"If you dig ryes and IPAs this is pretty good stuff.  I don't happen to be fond of either, so the score I gave must be taken with a grain of salt."
""
"Love ryes and this pale ale did not dissapoint. Great balance.  Rye comes through well."
""
""

"Very smooth and on the lighter side for some of the Rye beers I've had. Love reds too and they seem to share a lot of flavor."

"Tropical fruit, peach and citrus up front, with some rye spice following close behind. Pretty full body for the style and more sweetness than is typical in an APA. This is my last bottle of the sixer and I've also noted some bitter, metallic off-notes at times. Sort of coppery. But for the most part it's just pleasantly juicy and hoppy, although a bit big in body to have more than one or two of."

"O: Overall a rather lovely pale ale. Good and reliable, this could be a new go to summer bbq pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is a little grapefruit and lemon giving way to a thin watery middle. Malt is elusive and the mouthfeel is lacking and taste is light. A decent beer but lacking."

"The beer pours a nice golden with a decent but small white head. The aroma is of sharp with Rye, and a bit of floral hops. The taste starts with a full rye malt taste with a bit of dark fruits coming out in the sweetness of the middle, followed quickly by a nicely bitter hops finish. The feel is robust and wet, giving it a liquid bread quality that I like in a malty rye beer. This is a very nice example of a rye ale with a lot of malt, and nice use of the hops to compliment those qualities."

"Decent feel with said texture which segues to a citrus hop close. Spice, fruit and then a neutral sweetness to finish. Malt depth again comes across as more English in style but easy drinking Pale Ale nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent session beer. Less hoppy than some of Terrapin's other hop bombs."
"O: given time, a bunch of pleasant aromas and flavors present themselves. Love Rye beers this one is no exception."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall – A quite easy drinking and still very tasty rye brew that is blended nicely with sweet, spice and crisp flavors which really make for an easy drinker."

"O: given time, a bunch of pleasant aromas and flavors present themselves, however, they don't quite explode like they beg to... all-in-all, quite 6-pack worthy"
""

""
""

"Overall, not bad, but not something I would have again. The flavours don't work that well together."
""
""
""
""

"Nice little session ale. lot of the citrusy hop with the spicy and dryness of rye. low ABV but lot of flavor, almost in IPA territory without being overly bitter. discounted, not 100% fresh but look forward to the next fresh batch and will try to pick some up then."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A good go-to session beer, hard to find where I live. Every time I go south of the Mason-Dixon line, I make a stop at Terrapin (it’s only 3-4 hundred miles out of my way) to visit. Great people! Great beer!"

"o: A solid pale ale, tasty and easy drinking."
"BBD 4/1/14. Light amber pour with a nice head and lacing that lasts. Nose is quite nice of blended hops, mostly pine, over a slight sweetness. Light medium body with normal carbonation. The taste is lacking. Not much is going on, and what is, is somewhat weak. Rye and hop flavor are only hints and the bitterness is mild. Crisp finish. If you want a rye, go with Founders or Great Lakes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Terrapin Rye Pale Ale Wins a taste off over Cricket Hill American Ale , but both are surprisingly good, original and worth trying. Not nearly the tingle and the lively pine freshness of a Dales Pale."

"Honestly, after a couple of these last night I wondered why I found the flavor overall too ""light," supposing I was used to my more hoppy preference of IPA. There is grain but not the ultimate delivery of grain. I would have rather it came across more robust. Yet this evening as I returned from work not really looking forward to polishing off another bite of it I found instead it wasn't so bad, especially with a dinner of chicken cobbler and sauteed zucchini. My conclusion is this is a beer to accompany a hot meal on a cold night, but not necessarily a ""destination brew."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A miss for me. I like rye pale ales that showcase rye and hops and this one showcased neither. Really tastes like a malty English pale ale."

"Being from Athens, I can say that this beer is one of Terrapins biggest sellers. With that said it is not my favorite. I prefer ""Hopsecutioner"" and ""Golden"" but this is a great beer that can be found almost everywhere in the metro Atlanta area."

"Pours yellowish orange with a decent white laced head. Looks like a fair amount of carbonation. The smell is pretty weak. Nothing too outstanding, in fact for a Pale Ale I was expecting more of hoppy presence. The taste is pretty mellow and smooth. Nothing really jumps out at you but then again nothing really really bad hits you either. I'd say this is actually a very good session type beer that you can guzzle a few down with ease and get some decent taste too. So pretty much I'd get this again for those hot summer days where you just want to enjoy a better than ok beer throughout the afternoon."

"O - This is a solid RyePA and wouldnt mind having again."
""
""
"Overall I am surprised I never had this one but picking it up for a dollar possibly old it's quite a tasty pale ale. Worth picking up."
""
"easy drinking super suitable for summer days and a beautiful use of rye in the midst of the flavor. peachy, sweet, malty, & spicy to even out the malt and hoppy flavor characteristics. some citrus and pine but finishes clean and dry. I feel the rye is noticeable in this beer witch is a welcoming surprise. enjoyable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink with a nice spicy addition of rye. While not very hoppy, the hops present are sophisticated and enjoyable."
"o: is this my favorite rye? no. but I really enjoyed it. balanced perfectly. smooth and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'd call this one ""rye-light"" as it introduces the style of rye beer while holding true to its style. Worth having and a good Terrapin offering to give to your non-craft friends to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty beer with some good, but maybe not exciting, flavor"
""
"I really wish I would have checked the date. I assumed it was fresh because the demand is usually pretty high for Terrapin. Oops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"not really my favorite from a great brewery. tastes a bit to bitter, even for a rye beer. I've had it served at different temperatures and recently had it at terrapin itself. rye beers are difficult to pull off but this one leaves quite a bit to be desired,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very unique, worth a try. I like its dry quality, and it has a cool bottle. Would go well with lemon desserts, lemon merangue, lemon squares, etc."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fairly good beer but nothing really special. Today it was one of the better choices on a restaurant menu."
""
""
""
"Overall- Let me first say that i sought out this beer because I have been known to pick a banjo or two. Thanks to a person on the boards i was able to obtain it. I like this beer, I may have had this one a bit out of its prime, but i think that if i was introducing someone to a beer with rye in it for the first time i would choose this. The Rye is there but it plays well with the other elements in the beer. I don't know why but i think it would pair will with bacon and creamy foods like ice cream or mac and cheese. That peppery kick would cut through the cream. It would also because of the rye pair well with cured meats !"
""
""
""
""
""

"Mild on both the malt and hop fronts. Not really getting the spicy rye notes that I long for in a style such as this."

"Overall – My bottle isn't expired but this one tastes a little off. It's a tad flat and there aren't really any vibrant flavours. I'll have to try this again.. because based on the other reviews this should be much better."

"While driving keep a sharp eye out for turtles, we want this Rye Pale Ale around much longer."
""
""
""

"This is a really well rounded and interesting beer. I'd certainly buy it again."
"I paired the beer with pink beans and rice on my home made pretzel honey bread. This part I share to get to 250 characters."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy, amber color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and good lacing. Smells of pine, hop oil, sweet malt, hint of earthy malt, hint of citrus hops, and a hint of rye. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hop oils, pine, hint of citrus hops, and a hint of earthy malt. Overall, decent appearance, aroma, and blend."

"O: rye is present but reserved"
""
"Really quite good with a nice depth of flavor one would find typically in higher ABV beers."
"O: An easy to drink American Pale Ale with the nice addition of rye giving it some light amount of spiciness. Enjoyable and definitely one to try if you get the chance."
""
""
"Pours a hazy pale golden color. Very nice aroma, citrus and earthy hops, with a light background sweet malt smell. Taste follows suite, very nice citrus hop character with a little earthiness to it, nice crisp finish. The rye character comes through somewhat subtly, but it is noticeable. Medium high carbonation with a light to medium body. This beer is very refreshing, and I will definitely be having this one again."
""
""
"Overall a decent beer, but there really wasn't much to it. It is a good example of an APA."

"This is my first sampling of Terrapin's offerings. I am pretty eager to try some more of their beers. Even with what I consider to be an uncomplicated taste, it would be a good starter beer for someone wanting to expand their taste."
""
""
""
"O: Like this bottle says, this is a pale ale at heart. The rye gives it a little bit of interesting spice, but it retains it's drinkability and fruitiness. One of the few rye beers I've had that would be good for drinking on a hot day."
""
""

""
""

"O - Nice drinkability and balance."

"Thanks to ediaz for this extra! Says best enjoyed by the first week of May...so I'm assuming the hops have faded and it isn't going to be as good as it would be fresh. Pours an almost-clear golden color with a large white head that takes some time to go down. Scent is rye spiciness at first with some grain. Not much hoppiness. A touch of caramel malt. Taste is initially bread-like malt with some slightly spicy rye. There is a hoppy presence, but nothing bittering whatsoever. The rye characteristics are lovely though.Mouthfeel is light bodied, but nicely carbonated. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, it is an okay APA. The rye definitely helps. If it wasn't for the rye characteristics, this APA would be below average. Like I said before, this is an old bottle, so I'm sure it tastes better fresh."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm a big fan of rye beers. This one is definitely near the top. Easy drinking and a nice refreshing citrus quality to it. Very solid. You can't go wrong ordering this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This is OK. Nothing special but nothing off-putting. There are certainly other rye ales, APAs & Terrapin offerings that I would drink again before this one."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm kind of surprised I haven't reviewed this yet, a couple made it back from Florida with me so here goes. Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with a smallish foamy white head that persists a bit. Earthy spicy and citrusy on the nose with a bit of sweet toffee and caramel to back it up. Taste follows the aroma very well but intensifies the spicy earthy component and lessens the citrus. Medium to thin body with a crisp level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. This is a great easy drinking summer beer for me, I wish I could get this one locally."
""
""
"Overall: Decent pale ale with a bit of a twist. Very fitting for a sunny day!"
""
""
"O - A good beer. Sessionable but not bland. I feel like it was more flavorful when I tried it in the past, but that was on tap. I'll want to try it again and see if today was an oddity."
""
"This beer goes well with football, wings and nachos."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good beer. The rye adds a nice spice component to this pale ale."
""

"O: I'd buy it again, and I'm interested in trying more offerings from Terrapin. Thanks for reading!"

"Golden amber elixer with small white lacing cap. The lacing does ring the glass as this one is consumed. moderate visiblt carbonation. Nose features caramel, rye, and a quick slap of pine. Taste has spicy rye upfront with undertones of light caramel, pine, and a light does of citrus. This one trends toward the sweet side of the palate. Mouth is medium, but has an element of wateriness. Good."

"This is a nice drinkable APA that is made a little more interesting by adding the rye. Decent and refreshing."
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden brown color with a small head. The beer is not very carbonated, so the head diminishes quickly. I love the smell of this beer - honey, caramel, and malty. The taste is bready and malty, with the rye is very much 'up front.' A slight tangy hint of hops in the finish. Very light mouth feel. Good beer, but not overly interesting - can not compete with the other rye beers I've reviewed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a clear, copper color with no head or lace. The aroma is of bread crust, honey, and pine. The flavor is very piney with some lemon. There is a bitter, envelope glue-like aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light-medium and sticky. Terrapin Rye Pale Ale is an ok beer, light, dry, and fairly bland. Slightly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: Pretty average overall, with some typical pale ale characteristics, an added bit of spice, and something that doesn't sit well with me at the end. However, it went down pretty easily. Not bad, but didn't stand out."
"O: I applaud Terrapin for putting a best before date because at least I know this was past the date and I know it deserves a re-rate. I know it's a bit old, but unfortunately the consumer is left with a sub-par beer due to age. It makes me wonder how many ""bad"" beers I've had were simply bad due to age. I'll revisit this fresh."
""
"O- Decent beer, nothing really special or unique going on, easy drinkability, would drink again if there was no other option."
""
""
""
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and the rye spices up an ordinary pale ale."
""
""
"O - A unique take and solid. Glad to have tried it."
""
""
"M/O - Crisp and clean. The bitterness is a bit much for a pale ale. Worth a shot if you like hoppy rye beers."
""
""
""
""
"O- A very crisp easy drinking rye apa. I need to try more of this style to compare others."
"o - overall, delicious. i'd buy this regularly if available locally. great pale ale with a nice rye kick. i've been finding that i really enjoy a rye beer. this one reminds me a bit of sixpoint's righteous rye which i love."
""
"Enjoyed while at the brewery in Athens, ga. single finger rapidly dissipating head. Clear amber and golden mix. Lots of lacing. Very aromatous. One of the most aromatic rye ales I have had. Also some pine and citrus mixed in. Some hops as well. Nice hop character. The rye is actually well represented which is not often the case with this genre. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Drinkable for a rye and actually one of the better tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall it was a good drinking beer. Nice blend of flavors and aroma. Very much a pale ale with a bit of a hoppy profile. No signs of abv."

"I find this to be an enjoyable APA. Fans of rye should take note; this is one to seek out. If rye isn't your thing, you may be better served with a different pale ale."

"I enjoyed Terrapin's take of the RyePA. I'll have to continue sampling examples of the style to decide how it stacks up."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a slight white head. Aroma of citrus zest, pale malts and a bit of rye. Nice sweet and compact flavor. Good bready sweetness which includes the rye profile. A touch of citrus hops goes well with this solid pale. The rye is subtle, but present throughout the entire flavor trip. Good, simple, but original take on this style."
"A pretty underwhelming brew. The flavors don't quite meld together and there's just nothing that makes this stand out."
"Pours a hazy golden color. Two inch head that dissipates fairly quickly. Nice lacing. This is my first ""rye beer", and I like it! Smells hoppy, a touch of pine, and something mildly sweet...maple? Taste is pale ale all the way...hops, pine, ""different"" taste with the rye...spicy! Yum, hard to describe. Medium carbonation and body. Would make a nice session beer. Very drinkable. I like this one a lot! Will definitely buy again. Different!"
"O - A good beer but needs a bit of refining."
"Notes: Very much run of the mill pale ale… Terrapin can do better than this. True, I might be too keen on the rye and the softness here is not to my palate, but even as a pale ale it feels pretty nondescript and generic. I tried this first socially on tap in Atlanta a while back and had not much of a memory of it… So I was really looking forward to try it again, but sometimes things are better left in those bland memories."
"Pours a crystal clear straw gold with a two finger head. Smells mostly of sweet caramel and pine. Not a very aromatic brew, but it smells nice. Taste is more of the same. Sweet malts balance out the pine. Pretty light tasting beer with good carbonation. Overall, very pleasant APA. Perfect lawnmower beer. Well balanced and tasty!"
" Definitely a good value, this is a nice session beer and well suited for a hot summer day down south (or up north if you can find it)."
" I've heard that Terrapin tends to be a ""sloppy"" brewery, and this beer leads me to believe that it is probably true: good in conception, but the execution leaves something to be desired."
"What can I say, a wonderful Pale Ale with a twist of rye grain yet balanced. Satisfied customer"
"O: High drinkability, making it a fantastic session beer. I go back to this one over and over."
"Cheers"
"The color is a clear light amber with a 1/4"" rich white head. The smell was a grassy, like a meadow and floral hops, with some sweetness. The flavor is very well balanced between the hops and the sweet rye malts. Slight pine tones with a little caramel sweetness. There is a little peppery background. The brew is effervescent and easy drinking."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer -- not overly memorable but certainly worthy."
"A nice twist on the pale ale with the rye malt. Not much hops to it but it is very easy drinking."
"O - Refreshing and good beer that is quite easy to drink. Taste is nice, and the rye is a good addition to a solid APA. Would drink again."
"Overall: This beer is pretty well crafted. There's decent complexity and the balance is pretty good. It was enjoyable to drink and I'll buy it again in the future."
"I like the way the rye works with the rest of the recipe. It's a nice change of pace from the usual APA."
"Overall, a decent pale ale that demonstrates balance."
"Overall: This beer is as good as it was 3 years ago when I was down in Georgia for work for my old job. Happy that I scored a bottle, but disappointed that I only got one. A great rye PA and wish they would make a Rye IPA. Might have to go south to get another bottle."
"There aren't a lot of Rye beers on the market that I have found, but this is surely the best of those that I have. Cheers!"
"o- DECENT BEER WOULDNT GO OUT OF MY WAY TO HAVE AGAIN"
"Went to J. Clyde's in Birmingham as established on Beer Advocate and first beer I tried was the Terrapin Rye Pale ale. The beer was a decent copper/amber brew with limited white head, which casued me to downgrade the beer slightly. The aromas are awesome, rye bread, fresh, oily hops, a few spicy hop notes, and some citrus fruits are present as well. The taste of this brew is very well integrated. There is definately an excelent blend of flavors going on here. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is simply awesome! A very interesting RYEPA! Definitely recommed."
"O: This isn't going to blow you away but hits the style pretty well for a rye. The hops aren't very present but it goes down smooth."
"O: A very easy drinking APA, the rye gives it a nice little twist."
"Good ""go-to"" Rye beer."
"It's a nice beer. Definitely more complex than I expected. I wish I knew how to recognize the rye."
"O: I could easily put a few of these away, and the taste just urges you to crack open another one. Like I stated earlier, I don't normally like PA's, but I would buy this again."
"O: Decent, but off. Too light on the hops and even the rye is not overly apparent. Drinkability is good, but I probably wouldn't revisit another."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours an amber color with a small head. Sweet floral hop aroma. Rye and hops combine in the taste to make a bitter but pleasant experience, followed by a sweet finish. While this a fairly serviceable pale ale, it's not the best I have ever had, but I wouldn't tell you not to pick it up."
"D: This drinks quite nicely."
"87."
"Overall this beer has a great flavor profile that is rich, deep and multi-faceted. Great for the summer in my opinion and it is a perfect balance of all aspects that make a beer great in flavor and drinkability. It doesn't have the bright hoppiness of some IPAs, nor the brassy bottom end hoppiness of most DIPAs, but a good middle range, mellow yet forceful, satisfying flavors that are hitting the spot right now."
"Overall decent. Rye-pale ale without much hops-- nicely drinkable, sessionable."
"O: Eh, I usually enjoy rye beers, but this one leaves me a little disappointed."
"D- Very drinkable beer that has given me a new appreciation for rye beers. I would certainly try this one again."
"O: Decent beer. It's a nice twist on a typical APA. If it were available in my distribution area I'd pick up a six pack every so often."
"rye pale ales are interesting enough... a bit sweet for a pale ale but easy enough to drink. as usual, I appreciate Terrapin's effort."
"Overall: None of the flavors are overpowering. A nice beer, but nothing too remarkable either."
"Thanks again Jacob!"
"O- A good, but not great beer. Worth trying for sure, but in a market flooded with APAs, it isn't one that I buy all that often."
"O: Not great, but very much what I wanted in this summer moment -- light, drying, and very enjoyable. Recommended."
"This beer pours a golden body with a fluffy white head that sticks to the glass most of the way down. It smells citrusy and resiney. It has a nice hop bite at first but settles quickly back into a malty and bready ending. A classic beer in the south that can be had at any time of the year, one to have in the fridge at all times."
"O: A great tasting brew and has given me a new appreciation for rye beers. Thanks to Sam for bringing this back to Louisiana from Birmingham, AL!"
"all in all, pretty damn drinkable. and an impressive brew. The rye seems to show through well, despite only being 10% of the bill. But i'm not complaining. delicious!"
"Overall, smooth and easy to drink."
"Overall I would buy this beer again - solid APA"
"Sampled from a bottle – best by November 2011. Golden yellow in color with an orange hue and excellent clarity. Poured with very little head, but maintained a wispy cap that left a few sticky lacings on the glass. Bready, biscuit malt aromas with fresh lemon hop aroma as well. Medium bodied with refreshing carbonation. Nice balance of bready malt and light lemon hop from beginning through the middle. The rye malt flavors come through toward the end and lead to a dry, bitter finish. Very refreshing and easy to drink."
"Pours an orange amber with a fluffy bone white cap. Retention was so-so with some delicate lace strewn about. The aroma was of spicy rye and grapefruit with a bed of caramel malt. There is a nice balance here as the rye lends a perfect amount of spice and dryness while the hops deliver grapefruit and orange flavors and a mild bitterness. The malt holds its own keeping the hops from stealing the show. Easily drinkable. Medium body with a dry, mildly bitter finish. This is a solid rye pale ale, nothing too extreme,a straightforward example of the style done pretty well."
"Overall a pretty good beer. Wish it was distributed in Wisconsin. Id definitely drink it again."
"Overall: Still loving all the beers I have tried from Terrapin Beer CO. Great summer session beer!"
"This beer isn't a hop bomb, but is nicely balanced with a touch of spice. Very easy to drink. I could have a couple of these at one sitting."
"Appears a transparent, medium gold with light bubbles rising to the top to make a small white head. Fades into a small white cap and rich collar. Rings of spotty lacing are left around the glass. Smell is of citrusy grapefruit, orange, grain, and a touch of rye. Taste is the same as the aromas with citrusy hops breaking through to liven things up. Mouth feel is medium bodied, citrusy, juicy, chewy, balanced nicely, with a dry finish. I was hoping for more Rye, but this is a good all around Brew."
"D/O- easy to drink and a nicer light beer. Well brewed but not standing out enough."
"This beer isnt too bad, the beer pours out as a nice looking brew. A good head on it. The smell of the beer is pretty hoppy, the taste is a little on the weak side. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin. Overall I find the Rye Squared to be much better than this one. All in all this one was just a little light for me."
"O--This is a staple in my fridge. It's crisp, clear, and a great brew."
"O: This is a nice rye pale ale. 4"
"Flavor becomes quite malty and even sweeter as the beer warms. Grainy tannins in the finish, not overly pleasant ones. Balanced, but not overly impressive."
"The body was nice and crisp with the finish being dry and clean with just a slight bit of sweetness. Drinkability was very good, this would be a regular for me if it were local here. Overall, a very good beer worth trying when you can get one."
"O-overall, this is an easy drinking APA. its definitely not exciting in any aspect, but it is smooth and decent to drink when you have something else to occupy you while you drink it."
"I would say that this is my favorite APA right now and it is quite sessionable."
"cheers"
"This is a very good APA, very good drinking sessionable brew that looks and tastes great. I haven't tried a lot of Terrapin's brews yet, but Terrapin has been a winner in my book so far. Very good stuff."
"This is a very thin beer. Not the worst thing for a pale ale, but it could use a touch more body. Finish is quite dry with some spicy rye leftover after every sip. Nice beer, just doesn't quite hit in the flavor department."
"O: A great rye APA, that is hard to compare because there really are not that many out there! A great go to and very sessionable!"
"Taste is a little disappointing...weak...Hops, malts, everything are understated. They are there, and the rye is identifiable, and it's well balanced, just not particularly flavorful."
"O - well-crafted APA. A very dependable LIKE. Certainly above average and recommended."
"Overall - Potential session beer with excellent drinkability and taste"
"D – I think the drinkability of this beer is as good as you could hope for. It’s one that I could enjoy sipping all night long. I think it would make a remarkable pairing with a good cigar, and I believe I have one in mind for the second bottle, (which I will be opening forthwith. Man, I love having a mid-week afternoon off!) This is something I will likely keep on hand – it won’t take the place of the hoppier beers that are my first zymurgological passion, but will certainly fill in nicely on a lazy afternoon like today."
"Overall still not too bad you could do worse, but you sure could do a bit better."
"D: This beer is a subtle and understated, yet very enjoyable, pale ale that features rye qualities in favorable and appropriate measures. While more malt-focused, flavors are kept very near to perfect balance. This is a beer that may grow on the drinker with each successive sip--it seemed to be worthy of a 3.0 tops at first, but it kept being promoted."
"DRINKABILITY: At first I thought that this might be an all-night beer. On further reflection, though, I'd say that one or two would be my limit. It was a nice brew, worth the cost, and I'd drink it again and recommend it to friends but I probably wouldn't serve it at a social gathering since it's more of a sipping beer than a drinking beer."
"I'm confused by the labels: the Terrapin is almost a Teenage Mutant Ninja, but dressed as executioner (on Hopsecutioner). Here, the country-boy Terrapin of the Rye ale: marketing is a little off to me, but what do I know. I'm not from Georgia but just passing through Atlanta. Label reports the beer was brewed at Flying Dog."
"Very good, a tad malty, but good overall. Would love to try this fresher."
"D- Overall, a great session beer. I would definitely recommend this to convert your friends to craft beer. Very newbie friendly, but still damn tasty if you ask me. Cheers to millerbuffoon for hooking me up. I'm craving another one of these, but I only have one left, so I'm going to save it for another night."
"This is a pleasant beer overall, but nothing special. The rye character adds interest, but I'd like to see the hops come through a little more assertively."
"I would go out and seek it again. Coming off the cruise ship, this was a great alternative to bud light by three pl in a key west bar."
"This pours orange and has some sediment. The head is one finger with champagne-like bubbles, it goes away rather quickly and leaves a little lacing. The smell is really unique because of the rye. The whole feel of this beer is different than any other pale ale that I've had, which makes it interesting. The toasted barely flavor is replaced by a bitter sweet rye flavor. It still has hop presence and a nice mild bite that makes it an easy drinker, which isn't so unlike other pale ales that I've tasted. It has a lighter body and is something that I could have a few of."
"D.) Nice balanced beer with a mid-range ABV makes this a great beer for summer, fall or spring. Really refreshing with a clean finish."
"Great drinkability, quite an easily drinkable beer."
"D- This beer a nice well balanced beer which at times in the industry seems to be a miss. A nice lower ABV seems to be what this beer is. I could drink many of these over and over without killing my palate."
"M-This is a crisp beer with ample carbonation and a seriously interesting taste. This beer breaths a lot of life into the pale ale world. A blast to drink."
"Just how rye whiskey adds spiciness, fruitiness and body to a Bourbon, the rye in this brew really rounds out the typical lean Pale Ale style and makes for a juicy, malty and very tasty brew. It pours a brilliant orange-amber with a white head which left rather quickly and has a rich aroma of peach pie, orange and pink grapefruit. Subdued hops on the nose. The palate is bright with flavors of canteloupe and the creamy, fruity rye character adding a nice bump of body and complexity. The presentation is overall round, while the finish is short with hints of apricots and honey."
"Poured on-tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Jacksonville, FL. The beer was served in a pint glass, and serves a hazy orange-copper color with a thin, dense white foamy head. There is a slight hint of grain and hops on the nose, but very subtle. The flavor is grainy, but with a heavy dose of hops. Very well balanced flavors, tasting almost like a hopped amber. Smooth and light in mouth, with a crispness from the carbonation. The finish is quick, with a little hop residue in mouth, and a sweet and hoppy afteratste. Tasty!"
"drinkability; the hops are just too dry and dehydrating, not refreshing at all. If one likes lots of hops, this beer will be well appreciated, otherwise avoid."
"Light bodied but with a fairly aggressive carbonation that pricks at the tongue. This might be fairly drinkable pale ale if not for the metallic aftertaste and carbonation."
"D - This is a great session beer. A wonderful brew to enjoy in the great city of Atlanta on a warm summer day."
"Rye is something of an afterthought in the citrusy and toasty nose, but it's a surprisingly assertive yet complementary flavor. Crisp and toasty with a refreshing and juicy jolt of citrus. The rye gains steam as it warms, but never approaches dominance. A nice take on the APA, crisp and refreshing, but with a challenging element Easy recommendation."
"Drinking wise, the pale ale is smooth and easy to drink. Hoppy or not hoppy is the question!"
"Refreshing. I bet this would be a great one in hot weather (which we are definitely not experiencing in February in New Hampshire). Quite nice just the same."
"Single, twelve-ounced purchased from Buy Rite on Oak Tree in South Plainfield... Great stuff... Refreshing and satisfying with strong rye nuances. Malts and hops both evident with notes of amber grains, bread, butter, and honey. Medium-bodied, complex, and flavorful. Copper-amber hue with a full-bodied head... Good stuff... Recommended...."
"D: Not a bad beer, by any stretch, but it definitely fell short of my expectations. I come from the land of Red's Rye, where rye pales are delightfully refreshing and packed with flavor. This is good, but doesn't even compare."
"Solid brew. Great spin on an APA with some nice rye mixed in. Could definitely have a few more of these."
"Terrapin Rye is a staple in my fridge. Pours a pale orange with a thin head that laces nicely. Smells of rye, hops, apricots and orange peel. Just a fantastic rye taste that doesn't thin-out or dissipate as so many others do....the rye lingers on the palate and is a delight on a hot day. Carbonation is notably more pronounced than the winter brews I've been enjoying, and I'm glad for it...goes well with a sunny day. I usually have a one beer limit, but this stuff always tempts me to drink another. Well-balanced and very nice indeed!"
"D - good bre with interesting and delicious flavors that are well represented."
"I like the rye malt profile and the smooth hops in this beer a lot more than I thought I would. This beer is a too watery to be truly great. If it were less watery with a better head it would be an all time favorite."
"Color is a nice golden orange, much like an iced tea. Very little head after pouring. Citrus scents are prominent in the aroma, perhaps leaning toward orange. Hops are at the forefront of the taste, but not overpowering. I couldn't pick up any rye taste. Carbonation was just right. A very enjoyable ale."
"Drinkability- Goes down fairly smooth, nice kick back and drink beer."
"As some one that LOVES pale ales, this is still quite enjoyable. Definitely a B. This could be sooo good with a little tweak!"
"Pours a nice light and golden color with a moderate amount of white head that forms up at first, then sticks around and provides some decent lacing. Smell is quite grainy, some hay and grass notes that I can make out, a bit of malty sweetness and some slight, slight grapefruit. The taste is what makes this beer. It starts out with a mild and bready malt sweetness that is quite dry in character, followed by a touch of that rye spicy kick blended in with a bit of grainy/nuttiness, with a nice and balanced piney and citrusy hop profile. The mouthfeel is quite light and refreshing, with a nice dry finish. Nothing too fancy with this beer, but definitely sessionable."
"D: This is a solid go-to; it's flavorful, widely available, and reasonably priced."
"Drinkability is pretty solid. Overall is a nice rye pale."
"D - Very drinkable. This would make a great session beer."
"D- Very easy to drink, refreshing"
"Pours a slightly golden amber color with a thick white head and a good amount of lacing. Smells of rye, and citrusy and grassy hops, and maybe some grapefruit. Tastes like a little malt and then loads of bittering hops and a little rye bite. Mouthfeel is medium and has a little carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"D - Very enjoyable, definitely a well constructed ale. Not afraid in the least to say this one impressed me. I'd love to drink another again in spring, I just felt caged drinking it in an ice storm."
"I would absolutely purchase this beer again, and it would pare well with spicy foods, especially chicken, and even bbq."
"Drinkabilty - This was an easy to drink brew - well balanced , just enough hops for a pale ale ."
"Hazy amber with a nice head and a very hoppy nose. This beer was pretty tasty--I love the rye taste in any beer, and this beer starts with some grapefruit/pine hops before the spicy rye finish with a little bit of pepper. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is good. I didn't think the hops quite stood up to the rye--it seemed a little unbalanced to me?--but it was definitely an excellent American Pale Ale, a really tasty take on the style."
"This ale poured a light copper color and a finger of white head, leaving a lace ring on my pint glass. Some faint floral / grassy hops in the nose, but getting alot more malt aromas than expected (not really picking up any rye scents). The taste follows the nose pretty well - some sweeter malts upfront that are accompanied with the aforementioned hops, with somewhat spicy / rye malt finish. Medium bodied, with proper carbonation."
"Drinkabilty: At first sip I would have thought I could drink a few of these in any one sitting, but the more i savored it, the more i realized that one or two would be more in my drinking range. The use of rye makes this an interesting take on a pale ale and would certainly drink another....if only I had another."
"Not my finest Beeroem, but it works after having a few that evening:)"
"Nicely drinkable, though just a hair on the bitter/prickly side for a pale ale in my book."
"All and all a good beer. Nothing worth seeking out."
"Medium bodied with a nice bitter hop presence up front that is quickly countered by a sweet caramel rye malt backbone. Nicely balanced with hints of grass, straw and nut. Dry bitter hop finish."
"Overall a pretty good brew, though the rye is not quite as pronounced as I was hoping. I'd get it again."
"Overall: Carbonation definitely needs ramped up because right after this one, I had Terrapin Hopsecutioner and no carbonation problems in that beer. I don't think Rye beers are for everyone but this one grew on me. Would have again."
"D- I like the idea of this beer. I think a bit more rye presence and more carbonation would have moved this beer up quite a bit for me. This being said, the strong hop character may be the reason that the rye didn't show through."
"D - A very sessionable American Pale Ale... Quite refreshing... The rye adds a certain complexity that will keeps this Terrapin offering that I will gladly revisit on occasion... Above average, but far from world class... This is just a solid all around brew..."
"High drinkability! One is definitely not enough, but that's all that I have. Very impressive for a bottle pale ale. I really like this better than I can remember it served fresh on tap. Kind of odd?"
"Drinkability- try as I might I can't find a reason to buy this beer again. Its not a bad beer, just not anything special."
"D - Very high drinkability! One is definitely not enough."
"pours a light amber color with golden tones a light head is reduced to a fresh collar..smell is hops and malt a little spice and bread..taste is smooth and creamy with light hops in the tone of grapefruit,slight mango and floral its followed by a wisp of rye mixed in with some caramel..mouth feel is crisp and tasty with just the right carbonation..this is a great and slightly different PA loved the rye although slight amount in the mix with the hops and malts..try this on for sure"
"Very tasty and easy to drink. I love the spice in the finish and it just lingers on the tongue. This really hits the spot."
"D: One of the most unique pale ales I've had in a while. If you're looking for a hop bomb, this may not be your brew. However, it would be tough to argue that this is your average run-of-the-mill drinker."
"I'm really looking forward to getting more of these. This could be a staple beer for me, it's drinkable and simple on top of being delicious."
"Overall I was kinda disappointed with this, just tasted watered down and flavorless. Sorry, Terrapin, I still love ya!"
"Overall, the best local (Atlanta) beer that I have had, and I will get some more to continue taste testing...."
"D - A nice sessionable pale ale. Hops could be played up a bit more but the rye keeps it interesting."
"This beer goes down easily and is quite tasty. If this tasted as good as it smelled it would be outstanding, but even with a taste and mouthfeel that disappointed a bit, it is still a very solid APA."
"The beer is very smooth in the mouth - carbonation you can taste but fades away leaving the hops. I found the beer very drinkable; I will buy again."
"Pours a nice light golden-copper color with a nice white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings down some citrus hops as well as a bit of rye spice. The taste is fairly bitter with a good deal of citrus and hints of pine. A bit spicy. Nice mouthfeel with good carbonation levels and some nice zest. Drinks quite well; a really nice hot weather brew."
"Excellent season drinker. One of my go-to beers."
"It is their use of hops that makes this so good. It is well balanced and drinkable, more-ish. The alcohol level is not out of drinkability range either, it just qualifies for session status."
"d- a very enjoyable beer , i look forward to trying other rye beers in the future"
"Tasted from bottle obtained in a trade. Pours light orange with a faint hint of amber. Also pours with a nice white head that leaves fairly heavy lace. The nose is floral hops and citrus, including lemon and orange. There are also some nice malt notes, I typically enjoy rye-based beers. The beer is fairly simple up front, displaying some of the fruitier citrus notes well, and then moving into some nice bitterness from the hops, and then that awesome rye malt kicks in and melds nicely with the bitterness in the finish. The body and carbonation are fairly light with a nice finish that balances malt and hops very well."
"D - eh, basically a standard (albeit slightly bland) APA with a kiss of rye. light bodied to the point of almost being a chore after a full glass."
"(D)- A good beer. Refreshing with a light citrus crispness."
"DB- A well balanced, easy going beer. The label kind of goes with the beer in a way, relaxing and smooth. A beer with a nice malt and hop presence that is drinkable and refreshing."
"D : This is a very solid pale, but not alot of risks. I would have preferred just a bit more body."
"This is a very good APA, and the rye is pulled off nicely. I'd certainly be up for trying it again."
"D: Overall an average rye PA. Drinkable but not real memorable."
"The beer pours absolutely translucent, and it's darker than tangerine but not quite a true orange. Two fingers of fluffy white foam rise up, but disappear a little too quickly. Lacing is solid though as I make my way down the glass. The nose is equal parts bready malts, spicy and floral english type hops (guessed EKG were in the mix before checking Terrapin's site), and that distinct sharp spiciness I always get from beers that include rye malt. It's a little weak though. The taste is more of the same, and I'm having a really hard time finding the amarillo that Rye Pale Ale was supposedly dry hopped with. A nice crack of hop bite from the magnum marks the transition from the definitely present malt sweetness to the aforementioned hop and rye flavors. The body is nice, a little bit richer than I might have anticipated, but it works with this beer. Carbonation is a little too high/prickly for my tastes, but the key word there is little. A solid presence balances out the hops and rye and makes this a greatly sessionable beer. Solid offering from Terrapin, though I've seen them do better."
"Pours cloudy orange with a thin veil of white head that goes fast. A vague aroma of hops, citrus, wet grass and a hop spiciness. A pleasant drink: light hops, citrus, grass, some spice, a strange rye characteristic towards the end, and then vague lemon afterthoughts. Light in body and in carbonation. A light pale ale that sprinkles some great flavors across the palate but some weird notes as well."
"If you see this on-tap, buy it. What a perfect college football session choice this would be."
"I'm not a huge pale ale drinker but a friend of mine gave me a bottle yesterday. A- typical copper pale ale with bubbles from being force carbonated. S- I was suprized to find some bready malty aroma balancing the hops as apposed to most APAs that just smell like cascade hop soda. Real nice full nose. T- again it had a great balance of malt and hops. Lots of nice bready rye and tastey hop fruit and spice. Not to much bitterness either. Just what an APA should be. Malty without being rich, hoppy without being bitter. M- a little thin but nice and drinkable. D- Perfectly quaffable."
"apears a sorta hazy orange golden color, with nice white head 1/2"" thick, that leaves a decent lacing. the two expected aromas, rye and hops, are definitely in there. the flavor is rye, with a little hops bit, but still very well balanced. medium carbonation and body. pretty drinkable, all around decent beer"
"Overall - Delivers on exactly what it promises: A pale ale made with rye. Clean, crisp, just enough bitterness to make it complex but not over-the-top (or an IPA). An easily overlooked, but solid offering from Terrapin."
"I expected this beer to be a comparible to Founder's Rye Pale and it just does not compare. It is a fairly average beer. The hops are mild and the rye is very mild. It pours a soft golden color with a light head. It is light in body and easy to drink but light in flavor and hops as well. I'd tag it as a safe beer to serve when entertaining."
"D-A pretty nice beer that's easy drinking but still interesting. The rye is pretty perceivable, but I think I'd like it to have just a little more hop flavor."
"Bottle. Pours a very clear reddish copper color with a nice 1 finger head. Citrus hops in the nose along with smelling sweet. This is an intersing American Pale Ale. More malty in my opinion that hoppy. Well balanced. Medium mouthfeel. Not really sure what role the Rye plays or if I really can taste it all that much but I will say that I am enjoying this one. Decent bitter hop ending."
"D: A very good and refreshing beer and would definately drink again."
"Pours a slightly hazy, dark gold with a small but clingy head. Aromas are interesting: there's definitely a hop element on the nose but the dominant trait is remeniscent of a woodpile. Toffee notes are also there. On the palate I'm getting strong flavors of toasted English muffins and some toffee. Finishes quick and clean, with a light hint of lingering malts. That dash of malted rye makes a world of difference and makes this an exceptially satisfying pale ale."
"I really love this brew. It pours to a nice dark golden color. It smells grain and hops. The hops being the main thing that rings out to me. Excellent tasting beer with a light bodied mouth feel which maks for superior drinkability. I would defintley advise trying the Rye Pale Ale."
"D - This is a really good rye pale ale. I've really enjoyed the Terrapin beers that I found on my trip to NC."
"The mouth feel is pretty good. A bite of stern carbonation levels off into surprising smoothness, leaving only a strong bitterness."
"D - An ok pale, I just didn't enjoy how the malts turned sour halfway through. Fairly sessionable."
"Drinkability:This is a very pleasant beer to drink, easily sessionable."
"mid body beer. good carbonation. i really like this beer. had it on tap a couple of times when i was down there. would love some more of this."
"Served from tap into a tumbler. Pours golden with a one finger white head. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of wheat, malt, and hops. The flavor was of malt, wheat, nutty, with a subtle hop followthrough. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall it was not a bad brew, but it was not my favorite from Terrapin. It was very refreshing in flavor. It needs a more refined rye/wheat flavor to standout in my opinion. However this is a very nice brew regardless."
"Salad of arugula and purslane with heirloom tomatoes and panela cheese"
"Terrapin can do no wrong."
"At The Shepherd & The Knucklehead in Haledon, NJ. Into an American pint glass it poured a semi-hazy orange-amber, with two fingers of bright white head, fantastic retention, and great lacing too. The nose was overall very subtle; herbal, hay, grass, slight menthol, and even slighter apple. The taste began herbal and apple'ish, to a malty (and slightly caraway?) mid-palate, to a semi-dry finish. Nothing stood out in copious amounts; simply balanced. Nice medium body, accentuated by the lack of carbonation. Great for sessioning."
"D-Excellent session beer.I've finished off many a pitcher with friends."
"Drinkability: Not a bad brew, and a good choice for the hot summer night. Easy drinking, good flavor, and a sessionable ABV. Cheers!"
"variety pack. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is pine and herbal hops along with some rye malt. The aroma is nice overall. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some bready malt and peppery spice flavors noticable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit oily and dry with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it wouldn't be hard to drink quite a few of these at a time. I think this is a good overall brew, I'd buy this again in the future the next time I come across it."
"overall - there is just something about rye that I don't care for. Although I can easily drink this and could have another, it leaves such a dryness on my tongue that I wouldnt want to have too many in a night. That being said, its one of the better rye beers I've had."
"quite drinkable, might pick up a full case of this some time."
"More body than we expected which is not a bad thing at all; this beer has character to it and shows that it is not one of your run-of-the-mill boring pale ales."
"D: A great blend and fusion of rye and hops delivers a very quaffable and sharply tuned pale that satisfies all you hop and (rye)malt needs rolled into one. Highly drinkable, six pack recommended and very interesting indeed."
"Overall better than it sounds."
"Pours a honey straw color with a small tight white head that settles into a light cap. On the light side for a APA. The aroma is of a floral and grassy hop to go along with a lemony, caramel malt, quite pale. The taste is of a dry bready pale malt, with notes of honey and lemon. The hops don't seem to stand out in the flavor; a bit grassy but that is about it. The feel is moderate with tingly carbonation; finishes a tad dry and astringent. A solid APA, nothing fantastic. Actually it has a nice malt body but needs a touch more of a flavorful hop profile."
"Drinkability: very, very drinkable. probably one of the best pale ales I've ever had. good flavor combined with a good presentation leave this beer very drinkable. I liked it."
"D- not a bad beer, just my least favorite of this style...that I've had.  I wish the rye was highlighted/showcased more.  The bark is better than the bite to be sure.  I really enjoy a Alpine Nelson, or Sixpoint Righteous Rye for this style....more aggressive with the rye."
"d- with crisp and very clean malts dominating the beer this one would be one of the first beers I reach for if I'm looking to polish of a full 6er in one night."
"D: Very drinkable, this was a nice one to have. Very good mix of flavors."
"D. Quite a nice pale ale from the Terrapin brewery. An easy drinking beer."
"D: A very nice rye pale ale. Very sessionable and understated in its flavor. Not tiring to the tastebuds but still flavorful and refreshing."
"This brew is a slightly hazy golden color with a very slim head. Nearly no lace. The aroma is nice, however, with a very bread-like, malt and grain character. Moderate rye aroma, with a grist-like graininess in the background. Earthy scents, with a hint of bread-crust and an omnipresent herbal hop scent. The taste is semi-sweet, with a decidedly bitter finish. The bitterness really kicks in by the mid-taste, and lingers long after the swallow. Nice, full bodied mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable and enjoyable brew."
"Good drinkability. Nice crisp and refreshing. A good warm weather beer."
"Drinkability: Really pretty good. With minimal bitter aftertaste and that nice ""tang," I keep coming back for more."
"Drinkablility is good, goes down easy and has a pleasant aftertaste. Makes me want more, but not the best."
"D - Definitely refreshing, wish there was more flavor. Worth trying especially on a hot day."
"D - fanastic pale ale. I could see the grainy malts getting old after a while, but then again this is really nicely balanced by the grapefruity hops. Awesome beer"
"a good go-to beer whenever you see it on tap. a couple of these will make you feel real good."
"D- Nice body, mouthfeel, taste and balance. This beer has it all."
"D: This is the sort of beer that won't necessarily blow you away, but is definitely drinkable."
"T- More sweet citrus but there is a lot more of a rye snap. It really pairs with a grapefruit rind flavor to create a nice bitterness."
"D: This is one of those beers where you are drinking it then look down and see your pint is gone. This would be a daily drinker for me. I got this in NJ so at least they are making their way up north."
"This was a surprise. I was not expecting this to be as tasty as it is. Would definitely drink again."
"F: Somewhat bitter with a little more bitterness coming out. Very dry as well. Some earthy hop tones with some spicy rye lingering. A touch of fruit and spicy, citrus hops."
"D- not bad. It drinks pretty well. Not the best pale ale but certainly not the worst either."
"Drinkability: Without the rye this one would be another forgettable pale ale, but the rye taste makes it an enjoyable brew."
"D: Very drinkable. I usually don't even try APA's cuz they seem boring to me but I was intrigued by the rye. This blew me away. Even though this isn't the craziest beer I've had it really upped the ante for APA's. Never thought I would be giving a pale ale an A!?!?!"
"Poured a hazy copper color with shades of amber. Decent head, maybe a finger, with ok lacing. Nice aroma with the rye giving it a more complex nose. Citric hop with a little earthy/licorice note from the rye. Taste is solid and to style but I was a little disappointed that the rye didn't translate well to the palate. Good amount of clean hop flavour with notes of grapefruit and orange zest with only a kiss of rye in the mix. Very drinkable with a crisp bitter finish. Not overly hoppy so it would make a decent session ale. Solid pale ale."
"Buy Again? No."
"The rye is very subtle, but it is only 10% rye malt, so not should be expected to be strong, which is fine here, as it is a solid APA, to say the least."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops. Taste is of hops with just a touch of rye, finishes bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a decent brew."
"D: A bit sweet for my liking of a pale ale, but the rye helps to mitigate this a bit. Otherwise, easy enough to drink."
"thick malts character barrels in headfirst...nice mouthfeel that is luscious and crisp...hops are background noise...nice, but not as upfront as i'd expect with an APA...more like a B(ritish)PA...which isn't bad at all. actually, very fine. should be a good brew to introduce macro-only types to...so, sure, the taste is GOOD, but it makes you wish it was more than that. balanced. sessionable. but the rye and hops don't quite live up to something astounding. still, what a cool label series Terrapin has going :)"
"Overall I like this beer a lot for what it is. Very drinkable."
"Overall a tasty beer. I don't drink alot of pales but this one is very tasty. Might ask for more in a trade later."
"Drinkability: I'm really into this beer, I was real excited terrapin was getting distributed to NJ and so far I haven't been let down. I haven't had the brown yet but both this and the hopsecutioner have definitely earned their way into my fridge. This particular beer is IMO a great everyday brew."
"D: Very easy to drink, good flavor, well balanced and low ABV make this easy to drink."
"Nice."
"Overall Impression: Pale Ale is not my favorite style, but the slight rye flavor made it interesting. This is a beer I would bring to a mortal barbecue, because it's not too over the top."
"Drinkability: A little too sweet for me when reaching for a pale ale and could stand to be more balanced. I hope to be able to try again with a fresher bottle, but would still recommend people give this a try."
"D - A good pale ale that's different enough to stand out but still stay drinkable. I haven't had much Terrapin but I like them a lot so far. More please Jon! :]"
"Drinkability: When I had it in the bottle, I would say I could drink it all day, but coming out of this particular tap, I don't think I'd want too much. I hope to try this again from the tap and edit this review as I really haven't been let down by Terrapin yet."
"Overall, this one is worth trying if you see it. It's a perfect beer to try in a mix-a-six. I don't think I'd seek it out though."
"Impression: In a country full of fine APA's, this one stands out for its tasty, interesting flavor, and refreshing nature."
"D - Very drinkable, this is a natural flagship beer. Despite the name, there isn't too much rye character, just a hint of spiciness in the background. The hop character is nice, with enough bitterness to perfectly balance the malt, and when it is fresh, the aroma and flavor border on IPA levels. A nice APA overall, sessionable and well made."
"Nice change of pace pale ale."
"Terrapin RPA isn't as flavourful as I thought it would be, and the beer goes south as it warms. For some reason it becomes quite watery by the end. An above average beer with a unique twist, but not something I would seek out again."
"D-easy drinking and quite tasty. hops dominate, which i enjoy, quite a crisp finish and very smooth."
"Orange-bronze in color with a slight haze. The head is white and frothy, but doesnt stick around for very long.Lacing is pretty minimal. Definate aromas of rye and toasted grain with citrusy hops backing it up. Rye, lightly roasted grain and floral hops on the palate with a sweet malt backbone. Mouthfeel is on the verge of being watery and flavors dont stick around as much as I might like. Not a bad beer but not a great one either. A nice change of pace from the traditional pales you normally see."
"D - Very drinkable and a good session beer. Also very refreshing."
"Bottle evacuates into the glass leaving a nice copper ale with modest sized head. Nose is somewhat clean and light, but has a detectable rye component. On the palate it is noticeably light in all respects, light rye, light bodied, light malt, and easy drinking. Finish is smooth."
"Had no idea of this brewery, and thanks to a trade from RustyDiamond, I am now thankfull and a fan. I am a huge american pale ale fan, love sierra to death, but this gives it a run for the money. Overall has the smooth citrusy hop notes of a sierra pale ale, but is much smoother on the finish and a bit easier to drink. Big up's to these guys, I will be telling more people about these guys on the west coast."
"Terrapin's Rye Pale Ale: if you see it, try it out. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is light with above average carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's light, very good tasting and the rye gives it a somewhat unique taste that sets it apart from other pale ales. I really enjoyed this one and will definitely be buying this again. As an American Pale Ale this one is one of my favorites for sure."
"Good session brew."
"Don't drink and review."
"D: This is a mild beer with a good flavor, and decent aroma. I could drink a lot of these, but I'm not sure I' really want to."
"D - This is definitely a poundable and tasty pale ale. Gotta love those rye beers. This is one of the better ones on the market, in my opinion."
"Drinkability: This is a really enjoyable beer if you like what rye and hops do for a pale ale. I could easily have another. Will buy more in the future and expect it to have a regular place in my rotating purchases."
"Overall, this brew really did not live up to my expectations. This is the first offering of Terrapin's that I've had and was really let down by the complete absence of flavor in the taste. I look forward to trying some more things from this brewery, but this is just a little too weak for me, although it is pretty easy-drinking."
"One a warm day, this may be a great backyard bbq beer. Otherwise, it's just a thin mindless beer."
"Not buy again."
"Pours clear golden with slight head and nice lacing. The aroma is thin and slightly spicy. Flavor is bready and slight, but with a spice bite, a little lemony hops. Bitterness develops slowly and encircles the base of the tongue. Mouthfeel is rather thin."
"Value: I've seen this for about $8.99 a six pack. It is even available at some nicer Publix around me. Should be a buck cheaper, but this is a good choice for a summer bbq or a lazy day around the house listening to (what else) Terrapin Station and Shakedown Street."
"Just a solid rye pale, nothing special, nothing bad though. Very good, sessionable, satisfies with the rye. I'd buy it again, but I wouldn't seek it out unless I was really itchy for rye and there was no Hop Rod Rye. Kudos on the label. There's better offerings from Terrapin."
"Overall it was a good beer with some unique qualities, plenty drinkable, but also a bit bland for what I expect from an APA."
"D - I was actually hoping for a more pronounced rye presence. In any case, it's a solid-drinking beer that might benefit from a tweak or two."
"Drinkability: Great Beer!"
"D: Damn, this is a really good pale ale. I like the range of flavors. It's an interesting idea to use rye, but like I said, they need to figure out a way to make it stand out better. Otherwise, a fantastic beer that I'd love to have again."
"Overall, Terrapin has crafted a flavorful beer that contains enough hop flavor to satisfy all comers. Not bitter or offending to the palate, this is just a very enjoyable beer that I could easily put away several of in one night. My first Terrapin beer, and its good."
"Next!"
"D - This beer was nice for an APA but it really didn't stand out as a rye pale ale...I scored it on that even though the rye was at points absent...overall a good beer to drink when you are parched"
"Appearance is orange and clear with thin tan head and spotting. Nose has aromas similar to mesquite and charred sweet orange. Palate is medium bodied with some sharp bitter orange notes and a light roast malt presence. Not overly bitter. Would be a great beer with barbeque or sitting around a bonfire. Recommend as a nice 6 pack brew."
"Touch of bitter in the mouthfeel leaving the palate a little dry. Finishes clean and very drinkable. Faint grapefruit left on the palate."
"To put it simply, this beer rules."
"D- This would make a decent beer for a hot summer day after working in the lawn."
"I enjoy this beer; the malt seemed to me to be very slightly stale, nothing to bitch about. By the end of the glass, the rye was becoming more noticeable and I wanted another."
"This is easygoing enough and light on the ABV% to be a session beer, but this isn't the best brew out there available for that kind of drinking. Instead, this is good for a summer day where something with a bit more punch is called for - to go with some spicy Tex-Mex perhaps? Quite enjoyable and worth the find, but I would probably take the ""Rye"" out of the title if this was a beer that I was brewing and marketing."
"Beer has a nice body, some bitterness on the backend of the mouth, a mild aftertaste of more bitterness. A little sweetness on the front end. The flavor is a little sharp and biting. Drinkability is still high and mouthfeel is great. A very interesting"
"Drinkability. All day. I really enjoy this beer and wish I'd have discovered it this summer. Perfect for a hot day."
"Pours a golden amber color wth a finger thick white head. Fades quickly and leaves light lacing. Nose is of hops and citrus. Taste is similar, with distince, although fairly modest, bitterness. The Rye is almost no where to be found in either the nose or taste - at least according to my novice palate. Mouthfeel is medium, crisp and fairly smooth. Quite drinkable."
"Pretty good. Had it with dinner for parents 65th anniversary."
"Average mouthfeel, with an overall good drinkability. I would have one again, but I'm not going to go out of my way to hunt another bottle down."
"Drinkability: Very nice beer for relaxing on a sunny day on the deck or for downing in large quantities at a poker game or something. Lowish alcohol a plus for having multiples."
"Overall: A good beer. It was my favorite from Terrapin until last night when I explored and re-evaluated their India Pale Ale offering."
"D-Easy to drink, and very smooth. Quite good overall"
"The nice balance of hops and malts make this a solid offering from Terrapin. The rye just adds to the drinkabiltiy. I wouldn't mind this on occasion if I could pick it up locally."
"This is usually one of mya favorite styles of beers and it didn't disappoint. Probably the nicest beer that I had on tap in Georgia-I look forward to having it again and some others from Terrapin too when I get the chance."
"Overall, a great introduction to Terrapin Beer Company. A solid, yet simple, beer. Thanks Ben!"
"This is very drinkable. Enough hops to keep a hophead happy but not too much to scare anyone away."
"D: Not the best rye beer ive had, but not horrible"
"Review from notes taken on: 8/31/09"
"drinkability is good. mellow and easy drinking and a great hop quality without ending up too bitter. the malts work well with the hops, producing a brew so balanced it could be compared to an ESB. cheers!"
"-Oelergud"
"D - nothing that blows you over, but nothing that drives you away, either. could be a session quaf. it's a brew that seems like it might be one of those that is much better on tap."
"Terrapin Rye is a smooth, sweet, tasty, enjoyable, mundane, spiritless pale ale."
"Notes: A solid all around beer. It does what it sets out to do very well. I like the addition of the rye and it works well with everything else. Once again a nice balanced beer that I could drink plenty of in a night."
"D- Very drinkable, goes down well"
"Another favor from the Ohoove collection...I have enjoyed this on tap before, but this bottle was a first. It's a beautiful clear amber color with a decent off-white head and splotchy lacing. The aroma ia a sweet caramel rye, kind of a musty earthy malt. The flavor brings a similar spritzy currant and light piny-grass hop. Very finely carbonated, refreshing and decent drinkability. Midland body, fairly smooth. The rye and malt combo is nice but could be a bit sweeter. Sort of a corn syrup touch. Decent stuff."
"D: I'm pretty impressed by this beer. A very tasty pale ale that incorporates rye and a hop bill worthy of an IPA. When well executed, rye beers like this are a welcome addition to the world. According to the bottle, brewed at the Flying Dog brewery in Frederick, MD...interesting."
"Appears medium amber in the glass with an ample 2 finger head. The aroma is a balanced mix of citrusy hops and rye malts--and for some reason it seems very powdery to me. The flavor is also balanced, starting grainy and finishing bitter with some fruity notes. Medium body. Not the best rye pale ale out there but solid and easy to drink."
"D - Great drinkability I think. Certainly not for the price I paid, but the beer itself is another great pale ale. I guess this shows also that you can brew a great beer on any brew system as long as the recipe is altered properly."
"D: Very drinkable. A step above a session beer and very enjoyable."
"Pours a clear, orange color with a fluffy white head and nice lacing. Spicy aroma with some lemon/citruc notes. Strong bitter flavor, but not something that puts you off. Spiciness with some lemon flavor. Light-bodied and easy to drink. A solid pale ale."
"D-Very drinkable. I'll save the other 5 for friends who think a little bitter is better."
"Drinkability: Great drinkability, but don't try to enjoy it too fast, or the bubbles will make you sick."
"First off, I love Terrapin brews. I think they do an awesome job with the brews I've had to date. Poured this one, aggressively, into a Samuel Smith Pint Glass. Somewhat cloudy with a nice three inch head. Minimal smell at first, but the smell develops as the beer warms up. Good tasting beer, but a night after enjoying the Terrapin Rye Squared Pale Ale, it's just a bit more subdued for my taste buds. Still, a nice example of a pale ale. My bar is already high on pale ales, since Three Floyds Alpha King is my favorite in the style. Paired nicely with barbeque chicken off the grill."
"Pours an orangish amber color. The smell is of piney hops with some rye malts and a hint of fruit to it. The overall taste is of rye malts and it is balanced out by piney hops. Not an over powering hop but you know it is there, there is also a hint of fruit. The mouthfeel is a moderate carbaontion. The overall drinkability is good, it is not so hoppy that you would be turned off and the rye helps to balance it out."
"D: Perfect for summertime, highly drinkable, crisp and refreshing. Wish these guys were on the West Coast! Overall this is a very delicious beer. Thanks again to Pullen."
"Full-bodied and skillfully carbonated. Very drinkable and delicious."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable I could enjoy this almost any day of the year. Well done!"
"3.5 D: The rye offers something a bit off the ordinary. Good stuff."
" (A very worthy restaurant!) a perfect pair to the Crawfish. etoufe"
"Mouthfeel is slightly sharp with the carbonation & hop bite, but ends smooth. This is an easy drinker consistency-wise, alcohol-wise, but I think the hops would make me want to quit after about two."
"Future outlook: OK and drinkable, but I'll probably turn to Founders Red's Rye if I want a hopped up rye beer. Moot point, as this beer is not locally available."
"Overall, an easy-drinking pale ale, but I was disappointed that I could not pick out a distinctive rye character from the beer."
"M-D- Smooth mouthfeel of watery rye bite and refreshing hops are nice. Very drinkable for this style beer just not to afforable for something out of GA."
"D: Overall this is a very smooth and drinkable Pale Ale. This is a great beer for a hot, summer day. I plan on having more of these in the future, if possible, and the lower abv makes it easier to consume more than two of in a sitting!"
"The light feel and crispness is absolutely perfect for this beer. Due to the very enjoyable but long-lingering hoppy aftertaste I find myself coming back for a sip more often than with some other beers so that I can get that bready, maltiness that comes at the beginning of the sip. If you are looking for a good session beer then keep this in mind."
"I've never had a rye beer before and I can't really tell the difference. I'm beginning to respect the Terrapin name."
"Terrapin RPA has a amber/copper color with a clean look to it. Nothing more than a thin white cap stood on tap before dissapearing leaving minimal lace. Scents of rye from the 10% addition but nothing substantial. Some flavoring hops and a bready malt addition. Some citrus but overall tame. Getting more of the bready malts than the hops but some citrus does seep through. Unfortunatly the rye while pleasant is not enough. A bunch of grain in the finish which is not all that. A crisp light bodied beer with some flavor but a off putting aftertaste. The drinkability would be great with it's 5.3% but this is not for me."
"Lighter bodied, with a light, crisp feel so it goes down smooth and easy."
"Good beer overall. Not available in Massachusetts, so I'm glad that I was able to try this beer."
"D- nice mix of a pale, I enjoyed it"
"Overall a decent PA, but not a standout to me. Glad I tried it."
"Overall, another good offering from Terrapin. I'm really starting to like what this brewery is doing. Just another good example."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer carbonated and a little dry. The body of the beer is medium light and the finish is light. The rye in the beer gives this APA a little different flair. I don't think that there is enough rye in the beer to make a significant difference. It is not a bad APA, having a little more hops and a stiffer backbone would make this a fantastic brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat chewy. Good balance of carbonation. Overall, it's a good pale ale and I like the addition of rye. I would pick this up again if it was local."
"D- Easy feel and very sessionable. Nice brew."
"D - a quality rye ale from a quality brewer; delicious with any sandwich on rye (especially a reuben...mmm)"
"This beer was a hazy amber color with a medium-sized white head and a little bit of lacing. It had a rye bread aroma, and a rye bread, mildly hoppy taste. The beer was a bit on the mild side, not bad but not outstanding either. I have four more of these to drink, and I think I'll give some to my son-in-law."
"D - Very drinkable due to it's balance. For my money, I would rather have a hoppier Pale Ale but this is a fine APA."
"OK, but nothing great. I had this beer at Mac's Speed Shop and BBQ in Charlotte, NC."
"Morey's Bottom Line: At first I was a bit let down by this beer, but after drinking a few and having the opportunity to pour it in a glass it's grown on me. Up there with some of the better pales I've tried."
"Medium body. Really smooth. The low carbonation is appropriate here. Very easy drinker."
"Drinking this sitting in the sun on my boat. Could easily enjoy 5 more."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a fairly strong bite of carbonation."
"The malt balances the hop profile. My preference is a pale ale with a lighter malt backbone to showcase the hops."
"Great beer, easy drinking and overall a totally solid beer for warm weather or any weather really..."
"Drinkability- I could drink quite a few of these. Love rye beers and this one is very nice."
"A very solid APA. Wouldn't be my first choice but the rye makes for a slightly different option."
"Grows to a two finger head of frothy cream white bubbles, big and actively popping all about. Leaves a decent amount of lacing behind as well. Very light pumpkin orange in color, almost dilute, especially around the yellow rims, transparent throughout. Pink grapefruit and orange citrus break into the nose first, hoppy with pine and floral resin notes too, the rye is present yet in a sharp manner, no breadiness really, light apricot fruit presence, few distinct malt scents, if any. Medium-bodied, fairly foamy for its weight, fills the mouth up that way. The pink grapefruit and tangerine equally omnipresent here, tends to overshadow the more delicate floral aspect. Bags of dried lawn grass present, bitter tea leaf and tar. The rye like bread crusts, no doughy softness. It's not particularly hard to drink but not very balanced nor as complete as you suspect it may have been."
"Can't say it isn't easy to drink and would be a hell of a session beer, maybe even a good intro to craft beers, but I don't see myself revisiting this one."
"D - I really like this beer's drinkability. The rye flavors balance out the sweeter malts and the hop flavor compliments them well."
"D: A pretty straight forward beer, and certainly drinkable. The flavour characteristics give it a little extra personality and it would sit well in my fridge along with the likes of Sierra Nevada as being an 'every day beer'"
"A decently quaffable brew."
"D: Most definitely. If I lived in georgia, this would be a regular 6pack purchase for me and is the best session offering from terrapin I've tried."
"D= I really liked this beer. It was not really complex, but it was extremely well balanced and the spicy rye notes added just the right amount of flare. Recommended!"
"Some spicy aromas, earthyness from the rye, and some floral hops. Good flavor, can easily taste the rye come through with the first sip. Good bitter, and slightly spicy finish with out overpowering. Thicker than expected mouthfeel, but not overly cloying, creamy smooth. A nice full flavored beer, very good example of a rye pale ale."
"I was really impressed with the new level the rye gave the beer."
"D: I'm not sure how many of these I could drink before my tongue waves the white flag, but I'd be willing to find out."
"Enjoyed on-tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Winter Park, FL. A 16oz pour produces a beautiful orangish amber color with a large off-white head that has very nice retention and lacing. The aroma is malt with just a hint of rye and a good dose of citrusy hops. The taste is very balanced between the caramel malt and hops. This is definitely one of my ""go to"" beers that I like to keep stocked in the fridge. Overall, Terrapin Rye Pale Ale is a delicious beer that is very drinkable. Highly Recommended!"
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable and very sessionable."
"I recommend this beer, especially for those ba's who like a little rye, thank you terrapin, thank you again."
"Crisp clean finish with a nice hop bite and a a snap of rye....Deeelish."
"A seethru light copper body with a rocky two-finger head that left steady lacing around cup. A noticeable citric hop presence with fruit and a little bit of a light malt smell. Smooth, medium-bodied, with light notes of sweet malts that are perfectly balanced with the hops for a quasi-creamy mouthfeel that has a crisp backbite, all while packing in citric and fruit flavors. A standard pale ale to enjoy."
"Drinkability: It goes down fairly easy, but it's not great tasting. There are plenty of better APAs, and plenty of other rye beers. Probably won't buy this again."
"Was provided to me in a plastic cup...it may have skewed the appearance a little....Anyway, was a light amber color with a fairly stiff (comparably) head that slowly went away. The aroma had a light to moderate hoppy scent, pine and a hint of citrus. Tasted good: a bit of hops with a little citrus. Slightly bitter, but also slightly sweet....goes down easily..."
"Overall a fairly straightforward pale ale, but with that slight bite in there from the use of rye. Not the greatest of this Georgia brewery's offerings, but certainly a solid backbone to the company's line-up."
"A very tasty and refreshing beer both by itself and with food."
"This beer pours a golden amber color with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of rye with a hoppy aroma and honey sweetness. The taste follows the smell with a nice hoppyiness. The mouthfeel has medium body and has lots of carbination. Drinkability is decent. I could drink a couple."
"Poured into pint glass from 12 oz bottle thanks to kiefdog! Pours a deep hazy amber with a finger of tan head. Smell is citrus and floral. Taste is hoppy up front then smooths out to biscuitlike malt flavor that coats your mouth. Mouthfeel is light and surprisingly dry. This is a very tasty and drinkable APA."
"Poured into a chilled pint glass. Bright golden color with 1 1/2 finger head that lingers as well as the lace on the glass. A noticeable hop aroma, but not overwhelming. There is a hint of rye as well. Nice mix of malty and hoppy taste with average carbonation that makes for a nice well rounded beer. It was much better than I thought it would be and certainly would (did) have another."
"D - Highly drinkable. Each sip leaves me wanting another within 10 seconds or so."
"M&D - smooth and quite easy to drink, the girlfriend stole half of this one, well rounded and full of body, terrapin impresses again"
"D- Worth a try for sure. Overall, pretty easy to drink."
"Drinkability, I've decided, does not improve and in fact gets worse as I finish the glass. I don't like this numbing aftertaste. Starts promising but...needs something to tie all the flavors together better."
"overall, this was a very nice brew"
"A fairly good beer, my first rye and worth a try. Nothing absolutely spectacular."
"via brentk56"
"M/D - nicely carbonated smooth drinking brew, many different flavors make this very interesting and I would definitely try it again."
"Not overly impressive. A little thin and leaves me wanting more. Very sessionable though."
"Bottle from Smoke Rise Bottle Shop in Stone Mountain, GA. The beer pours a mostly clear copper/amber color with a thin off-white head that dissipates steadily. Thin rings of lacing. Floral hops, malt and rye in the nose. Medium-bodied and moderately bitter with hops, grapefruit and rye flavors along with some bready malt in the background. The finish is hoppy with lingering floral notes, plus some rye and malt aftertaste. Pretty solid all around."
"D - Overall, this is a great Rye, I'm really looking forward to more from Terrapin and because of this beer I'll give other Ryes a chance to grace my tongue."
"From a 12 oz. bottle set to me from a friend back east. Aroma is a little hoppy with a slight hint of spice. Color is a honey amber with an off-white head. Flavor is clean and dry, bitter without being over the top. A little rye character in there. Balanced but not much malt in there. A descent pale ale without pushing the boundaries."
"This is an outstanding pale ale. Pouring a brilliant orange color with a fizzy white 1 1/2"" head that dissipates as I drink. It smells spicy and clean. Tastes is very good, with slpice, hops, and rye. This beer is very drinkable. I would consider this and outstanding session brew. I will be going to get more of this as it's finally available to me."
"Very good. I'd recommend this one on drinkability alone, this would be a stellar session brew."
"Drinkability: Don't fear the turtle!!! Terrapin turns out some great brews, I have yet to be disappointed. The rye pale ale is extremely refreshing and very pleasing. This beer is one of my fall back favorites, easily obtainable and affordable."
"Very delicious for a rye pale ale. Reminds me of my own efforts. Definitely a flavorful, sessionable pale ale that you can't go wrong with."
"taste is a little better, mild hoppiness, floral, bit of citrus, i can taste the spiciness of the rye which is nice, this beer is ok, i thought it would be better, but its not horrible, i would buy it again, but only if there was nothing better"
"Drinkability: A good example of Pale Ale, with something extra added by the rye."
"Overall, a good solid beer but just short of top tier APA for me. Glad I got to try it as I've read good things about Terrapin and have been wanting to try them. Also knocked another state of my list. Recommend if you can easily get. I'd like to try at least once more."
" I love this brewery because it is what is right with the south! They make some incredible beers and this one is on that list! If you get a chance to check it out on draft do that because the bottle taste while good is not as satisfying! Cheers and enjoy this one!"
"A decent rye APA but not as good as I was hoping. Aroma was very nice. Sweet rye malt with some grassy and earthy hops. Pour was beautiful. Deep dark red with a nice 2 finger of white head. Taste was a bit disappointing. Watery and thin with a lot of sweet rye and sugar. The hops and malt seem like they are fighting each other. Decent carbonation. I love rye pale ales...this was just too thin."
"Pours a transparent orange/brown color with a medium sized frothy white head that leaves some soapy sticking. A surprising amount of rye and pale malt on the nose balanced by a sweet grapefruity hop character. ...bready mid palate, man this is awesome. Im a huge fan of rye beers and this one really nails that level of maturity i seek in them. Hops initially, subtle with a sweet bitterness, then comes the sweet malt and rye bread adding something great, for the finish the hops return and the aftertaste is a wonderful blend of the two. I get a small hint of chocolate as it warms... This is great, light/medium body, moderate carbonation and very drinkable."
"Pretty drinkable brew, decent stuff."
"Mouthfeel was rich enough for the style. Overall drinkability was ok. If I had SNPA, I wouldn't order this beer, but overall it wasnt that bad either."
"Overall I felt this beer was a pretty average Rye Pale not as good as Hop Rod Rye from Bear Republic but still a quality beer. Could have several of these beers and not be tired of the flavor."
"A refreshing Rye Pale Ale that is a pleasure to drink with no overpowering flavors. A very balanced beer that would make a great session beer for any time of the year."
"Very drinkable. Might not make it the only thing I drink over the course of a night, but wouldn't complain if it was all that was available."
"Taste is a wonderful mouthwash of hoppy goodness balanced by a slight touch of malt sweetness. Slight metallic bite, but finishes with a nice mellow breadiness. Mouthfeel is a tad on the spritzy side with medium to high carbonation, but drinkability is high nonetheless. Great APA."
"Fatheads was giving this stuff away on friday for the terrapin kickoff! Kudos and good luck to the guys from Terrapin, You guys kick ASS!"
"(On tap at Piper's Pub, Pittsburgh, PA)"
"The mouthfeel is medium with a medium level of carbonation. This beer is pretty drinkable, but I find the spicy finish a little distracting."
"D. I am down with this beer. Very tasty and refreshing. First I've seen of Terrapin in PA. I got to try a sample of Hop Monster and was very impressed as well. Pushing the boundries of the style and I love it."
"Mouthfeel is thin and dry (rye), and I am a little dissapointed with it, but this is a very drinkable beer, and nice in some ways. I would probably prefer this in the summer."
"Love the label artwork as I do most of Terrapin's offerings."
"Id love to have some more. Solid brew, not over the top."
"This bottle did not disappoint at all. The outstanding brew that I remember from having had on draft. This is one I would keep in the fridge with regularity if it were available to me."
"Note, on-tap is many times better than the bottle, bottled it tastes like a cheap macro lager. This is really the first beer where I have ever noticed such a pronounced difference."
"Pours a slightly hazy light amber with fast fading white head and decent lacing for the first couple of inches. Smell: light breadiness, apricot, spicy hops, grapefruit. Taste: spicy and grassy hops upfront, followed by a mild grapefruit flavor, tangy. It's a bit light on the malt and body, but still tasty and eminently drinkable."
"Updated: Definitely enjoyed the next one more than the first... huge head, so the first must have been flat. Marks have been updated. Cheers."
"Thanks to Rblwthacoz for this one. WOW!"
"I love this beer, and I now love rye beers"
"Overall: worthy I guess"
"D: very nice had 2 in a row, I love it."
"D: fantastic and could drink this all day and night and have drank many 6 packs in 1 night."
"The tast is a little tart, quite hoppy, and has a nice malt rounding taste and smoot malty mouth feel. It is very clean and very well balanced."
"Drinkability: A little better even than on tap, I might say (which isn't something I say too often). The tastes were a little fuller, more rounded, in my opinion. Either way, it's an impressive brew w/ a manageable alcohol level, a nice balance of flavors, and a nice offering from Terrapin."
"Thanks to michaeld23 for this one."
"T/M: Medium bodied and medium flavored. This is an average carbonated mix of sweet and sour flavors. Lots of malt sweetness, more than I expected. In the middle of the drink, the floral hops become apparent. The unique rye flavor makes this beer quite interesting and enjoyable. It may be the smallest bit watery at times. Very refreshing with a ghost-like bitterness that lingers for a while after drinking."
"Pours a nice transparent copper with a medium off-white head that leaves some lacing. Smell is great--rye grains, citrusy hops, and a hint of roasted malts. The taste is not as prevalent as the scent, but still has what's expected of an APA--bitter hops, some rye, and the not-so-expected--mouthfull of malts. Mouthfeel is little more carbonated than I like, but still pretty good. This is a drinkable APA that's as good as anything available at most supermarkets."
"Terrapin's got a winner with this one. There's nothing material to complain about. It really is an all around fine beer. I'd love to have this available in Ohio. It'd be a staple in my fridge if that was the case. Since it's not, I'll have to extend my gratitude to Dan for sending me another fine beer. Highly recommended."
"Pours a crystal clear golden amber with an off-white head that leaves a cap and some decent lacing. The aroma is a mix of rye and hops with a solid caramel malt base. There's a whiff of spices in there as well. The taste has less rye and a bit more hops, with an earthy hop kick up front. The finish is slightly dry and bitter with a medium-bodied mouthfeel and good carbonation. This is one of my go-to beers and is extremely drinkable."
"D- very easy and pleasant to drink. extremely sessionable. this beer reminds me of summer. thanks to lvnloud for this has an extra"
"D- Absolutely drinkable. The kind of beer you should grab a six pack of to cleanse the pallet between really outstanding beers."
"Purchased at Whole Foods in Birmingham. This beer pours a nice copper color with a small but stubbornly long lasting head. Smells like a good APA with malts and hops present in the nose. This beer tastes exactly what I want in an APA. There is a great malt, hop, and citrus flavor present here. This is a high quality brew. Lacing is present on my glass. As a Southerner, I'm proud that this beer is brewed in the South. It has become one of my favorite APA's so far. I will be buying Terrapin Rye Pale Ale again and again."
"D- mellow yet tasty flavor and a real thirst quencher."
"Poured a clear golden orange color creating a tight bone white head with good retention. Some spotty lacing as the snifter drained. Aroma profile was that of toasted malts, clover honey, citrus and some faint spicy rye grain. Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth with just a touch of carbonation. The malts dominate the flavor profile with a subdued sweetness; like toasted rye bread with honey drizzled on top. Some faint orangey citrus notes come through in the finsih. Overall quite light and crisp. Would be a tasty thirst quencher served a bit colder in the hot Florida summers."
"literally makes a mouth water for more"
"A pretty good Pale Ale but nothing spectacular. Copper color with a head that settles down quickly. Aroma is rather clean with some grapefruit hops, citrus fruits and maybe a touch of malt. The beer is easy drinking and refreshing. There's some grapefruit hops in there with some flowery, citrus notes and it finishes slightly bitter. Some hops in the aftertaste. Pretty solid but nothing that jumps out and says wow. I just bought a 4 pack of the Rye Squared so I look forward to what this x 2 tastes like."
"Would and will buy this again next time I am in the GA area. I would definitely recommend tasting this one."
"Very easy to drink on a hot summer evening."
"Overall I was surprised with this beer. I'd tried it in the past and did not remember it being this good. All of the flavors work very well together, and this might work its way into the rotation as an everyday beer."
"I had the beer on tap at Brixx in Charlotte for $1.50...what a deal. Color was dark gold with an excellent head and lacing. Taste and smell was very good with citrus & hops and enjoyable...very well balanced. Would no doubt have again and enjoy, a good solid brew."
"This has been my go-to beer for cookouts or just keeping around the house in the summertime for a few years. Glad I could reconnect with this so well. This is also a great gateway beer."
"Found this gem at my local ABC. Poured into a tulip glass. produced a nice two finger head that dissipated into islands of white foam floating in a sea of amber. Smell of the citrus along with the hops, and a slight hint of rye bread. Bottle states that along with the rye, this beer is brewed with five different hops. The taste is of a mellow hop and grapefruit that the smell alluded to. Easy drinking beer that you could consume after a hot day in the Florida sun, Not complex, but satisfying none the less. My usual barometer is, would I purchase this beer again? I would have to say yes."
"Into a DFH tapered pint, pours a dark copper with a nice inch white head with decent retention, moderate lacing. The aroma has nice rye and caramel malt, nice round hop bill. The taste is rather the same, hops have a good citrus juice to it, and rides through the whole lenght of tasting, with a solid malt backbone and the rye ducking in for a show of hands. The mouth is medium, nice carbonation, a little dry, but a good quaffer. Not very complex or really that 'interesting,' but a solid beer. Could easily sit down to a case of this."
"This poured a slightly hazy gold with no head. It smelled strongly of cinnamon, and faintly of honey and some rye, with no real hops scent. It tasted like light citrus hops mixed with sweet honey malt, but didn't have noticeable rye flavor. It was watery with no carbonation, and had a mild bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean and easy to drink beer, but it could have used a little more character (such as more prominent rye)."
"This is a very enjoyable Pale Ale. The rye gives it a nice twist and allows one to focus on the hops. Very refreshing. Recommended."
"D - Overall nice and crisp with some decent if not slightly lacking flavor. The mouthfeel is what messes this beer up for me."
"Easy to drink. Goes down great cold."
"MF/D: Lighter in body than other examples, carbonation is pretty good. Nicely balanced, with a lingering bready finish"
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick and creamy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a wonderful pale and rye malt scent that is spicy, yet blends well with the excellent hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a crisp, pale, Carapils, and rye malt flavor that goes down easy an finishes bitter with a nice spicy, bitter hop taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. I love the addition of rye. It adds another layer of complexity to a APA. The hop character is outstanding as well."
"D - Great with beer nuts! I could stand another.."
"very drinkable and definitely worth the ticket"
"It's mildly drinkable. I probably couldn't go through more than two of these without something inbetween to mix it up a little bit, though."
"D - Very easy to drink."
"Decent mouthfeel."
"A little hazy with a bright orange colour, it was topped by a thin skim of fine, whitish bubbles and a thin collar after the foam fell after the pour. Quite sticky with a fair bit of lacing. Plenty of malt in the aroma, caramel and rye character, with a juicy and citrusy hop aroma. Well balanced flavour, with just enough malt presence and bitterness that stayed solid through the finish. Oranges and a bit of citrus zest turned into a bit of spice towards the end. Carbonation was on the crisp side and the texture was good. Very easy to drink, nicely balanced, with just enough rye character to make it interesting."
"M/D - Medium bodied with a good level of carbonation. A very drinkable pale ale."
"D - I would have another of these if I stumbled across one but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. overall a good session beer suitable for the georgian summers."
"A pretty standard APA that could do without the rye."
"D: Can drink plenty of these. I love Terrapin brews. This one has a great flavor that really shines and is nothing too crazy. Good summer brew."
"A pleasure to drink and I wish this brewery would travel farther north of the Mason-Dixion so I could enjoy this more often."
"A good beer, but I was expecting something that would have portrayed the rye character a bit better... perhaps a bigger grain bill or less aggressive choice in hop? Either way, I wouldn't turn one down, but it may be awhile before I have one again on my own dime."
"Plenty smooth with a refreshing light-medium body and excellent drinkability."
"D- I little bolder than some pale ales that I drink such as Yazoo, which is also very good. If you like pale ales this is one to try to get your grubby hands on at some point. Its the only Terrapin beer I've had so far."
"I had this on tap at Tyler's Tap Room in Durham NC. The beer was slightly hazy burnt straw colored with a thin creamy micro-celled foam. The smell is IPA-ish, definitely hops are the predominant aroma, citrusy and not unlike Red's Rye or Gumballhead (not exactly similar beers, but the amarillo aroma is the same). The taste is nice, well balanced between the malty sweetness and the massive hops bill. I found it tastier and more drinkable than the Rogue IIPA I was drinking side-by-side with it. Overall a very nice beer and I'll keep an eye out for other Terrapin beers in the future."
"All-in-all a great beer."
"Pours a clear golden/amber, thick white head forms, drops some nice lacing, great retention, nice foamy layer and ring. Smell is nice, honey, straw, some rye tang, lemony citrus kick, light floral, not very complex but very refreshing. Taste is similar, quite light but nice flavours, some malty sweetness at first, honey, rye spice, wheat, floral, some citrus, really dry tangy finish, very refreshing. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, perfect mouthfeel, perfect hot weather beer. Thanks!"
"See my review for the bottled Terrapin, as well. This didn't look quite as good on tap as it does when poured from the bottle. The head doesn't build quite as well, but it retains decently and leaves good lace on the glass. The aroma for this beer on tap is excellent. The hop aromas are still there, but the rye malts really present themselves in the draft version of this brew. Taste is similar to bottle--tangy, herbal, and spicy citrus hop flavor is present with a light underlying balance of pale rye malts. No sweetness, but thirst-quenching bitterness. Body/mouthfeel is similar, with a little bit more carbonation on tap than from the bottle."
"another great terrapin brew!"
"Since it is one of the few microbrews sold locally, I try to keep a few bottles in the fridge."
"D - A light bodied, easy to drink pale ale...pretty much all I think needs to be said here. I definitely enjoyed this beer"
"Thanks, wickedpete, for the extra!"
"This was a very unique beer for me. I enjoyed it well chilled in a pint glass. The pour was beautiful, a deep honey color with a red hue and a two finger eggshell head. The aroma was a little hard to detect which disappointed me a little, I got faint hops and rye but it took my nose right up to the brew. The taste was pleasent and chewy. Kind of loogey inducing which I like. Taste of oily hops and a little floral with a kiss of rye. Over all a good brew."
" A very drinkable beer. Very crisp and clean with sweetness in the hop profile with only a bit of help from the malt. I soooo wish I could get this stuff here, I could see myself killing several cases this summer. I've just been inspired to brew my first Rye PA."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a mug and when held up to light, it was a clear reddish amber color with a white head that seemed to dissipate quickly, but not entirely. Some of the head seemed to stick around for pretty much the entire drink, which was a little unusual. Also when held up to light, you could see some light carbonation. The beer gave off a definite hoppy aroma. This followed through to my palate as well. I found the beer to be smooth, simple, finished with a bitter aftertaste and overall very drinkable. Overall, a pretty good pale ale. One that I would definitely buy/order again."
"Light copper in color with bright golden highlights. Creamy, half-inch white head with sturdy retention leaving thinly webbed lacing down the tumbler's sides. The aromas are of fresh and bright, spruce/pine hop resins. Slight whafts of citrus as well. Spicy pine flavor with light pear, lemon zest, and faint grapefruit. The semi-sweet toasted malt provides adequate substance for the bright hop character. No adjunctory wheat or grain traces whatsoever. The bitterness is assertive, but light leading to a spicy pine aftertaste. Light, medium in body; active, but not over the top. Very flavorful and highly drinkable. The rye addition makes for a very interesting combination with the hops, almost giving the drinker the impression that this is an IPA. Whatever it is, it's certainly worth having a few pints when you have the opportunity."
"D: Softer rye flavor than Bear's Hop Rod Rye (which I prefer hands down) but good and sessionable."
"D: An above average pale ale with a spicy kick. Makes me wish I had more than just one."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is relatively light and easy to drink, going slightly watery toward the finish. The carbonation is light as well, adding just enough to create a some additional body. Overall, this isn't really exciting, but it is a nice brew to just drink and enjoy, and that I did."
"Poured from the bottle into a SweetWater pint glass. ALOT of lacing and a strong head hangs around for a good while. Smell is typical American Pale Ale - citrus & pine. Taste is pretty average. Well-balanced, but more of a subdued flavor than what I prefer in a Pale Ale. This is my go-to beer for Summer."
"Drinkability- This is a fantastically drinkable brew that is exactly what I had imagined a Rye Pale Ale would be. It's very light and crisp with that Rye bite that I thoroughly enjoy. Very sessionable as well, you could drink a sixer of this stuff and not have any idea. Great beer, big thanks to Walter!"
"D: Yes, nothing much too it."
"Drinkability is good too. This is a tasty and easy to drink beer. Very session worthy, and a nice way to kick off the weekend."
"D: Definitely a nice beer for a long round. As always, I find the moderately bitter beers to be better matched with the task of thirst quenching."
"Very good drinkability for hot weather as it is light, thin, and bitter rather than sweet."
"D- This one is pretty tasty and not too filling. Goes down without much effort. A great pale ale with a twist."
"D - This is a good brew. Nice and complex. Not too filling either. Would accompany great with a good ol' southern meal. Try it out."
"Pours a clear amber gold color with a white head that lasts a good while. Smell is Nicely hopped with a zesty rye zing and light maltiness as well. Taste is a very balanced hoppiness up front with a maltier finish with a nice amount of flavor. Crisp, lightly bitter bite to it, with the taste of rye present. This is a fantastic, easy drinking and flavorful Pale. Very nice."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body. There was a light slickness. Very drinkable."
"D: Hook up the IV. This is a great pale ale. Hard to imagine improving. Highly recommended. I wish I could get this in KY."
"A session beer for sure very drinkable and easy to kick back a few"
"Drinks very easy, the rye adds a nice drinkability/crispness. A great session APA"
"D: Excellent. Goes down VERY easily -- I think I drank two of these in under 30 minutes."
"12 oz. bottle, best by 11/5/07 - sampled two months before that. It pours a well-carbonated, crystal-clear orangey/gold hue, with a loose, three-finger khaki head that leaves nice lacing. Toasted and biscuity malts in the nose, with a decent helping of rye and a light backing of hops. The taste is similar, with citric/piney hops that impart a medium bitterness, but the rye is more subtle than in the aroma. Medium, drying, yet fairly smooth on the palate, and it imparts a medium finish. Not too shabby of a pale ale, but even with the rye it isn't different enough to make it a standout brew."
"Drinkability: I like it. Easy to drink. I wish I had picked up more than just one six pack. I'm really curious about their Wake & Bake Stout. I know I'll be keeping an eye out for this one in my travels."
"Recommended."
"Taste is a complete surprise since it had nary an aroma, decent hop kick, not too overwhelming, goes down very smooth with a good sweetness balance, bit syrupy but not overdone."
" highly original stuff, a nice twist on a pretty standard style."
"I like this beer. A very nice session brew, in my opinion. The rye character of this pale ale really helps it stand out among its brethren. It's not eye-popping, or very fancy, but it's a solid beer with much going for it. It's convinced me to seek out more rye beverages too."
"D:Very easy to drink. I really enjoyed this beer, but the one thing I didn't like that much was the little bit of harshness that was at the back of the palate. But other than that they did a great job."
"Overall I really like this beer. Extremely drinkable. Would make a great summer beer. I have yet to meet a Terrapin I didn't like."
"Nice draught...not too spectacular in the aroma department (but not bad either). Great with a Mediterranean platter (baba ghanouj, hummous, tabouleh, olives...). The wee bit o' rye does clean the palate and leave you thirsting for more. I'm getting good at this identifying beer thing -- I had a hunch that it was dry-hopped (VERY floral on the tongue), and sure enough, it is!"
"Had it at the Mellow Mushroom in Augusta - best place to go to in Augusta."
"Very smooth, well balanced, and easy to drink. If I had easy access to this fellow I could see this making a regular appearance in my beer rotation."
"Very drinkable, with an agreeable %abv and pretty well balanced flavor."
"Drinkability: Superb balance with near delicious flavor. Satisfying, but not too filling. A bit too robust for the ideal session beer, but definitely a beer of which I could enjoy several."
"Light-medium in body. Crisp and smooth. Easy to drink, but I can see growing tired of this beer after a few. Rye character takes away from sessionability."
"Helluva drinkable beer and one that has upgraded my opinion of this brewery. A truly mellow beer that is frankly a lot like Firestone Pale Ale in sheer quality. Damn tasty if I even move to this part of the country I will know what my everyday beer will be now."
"Overall- A nice tasting Pale Ale. This would be a good session beer."
"Drinkability: We've got a winner. If there's one area this beer excels in it's drinkability. This is a very balanced, refreshing beer with just enough flavor to keep you coming back for more."
"What a nicely balanced APA! I have to say it compares favorably with my benchmark for the style, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It went wonderfully with the shrimp we had for dinner and the stew as well. I would have to highly recomend this, it's nice to have a regional brewery near me with high quality offerings!"
"This is a VERY drinkable beer... I could drink several of these, either with pizza or burgers, or on its own. I wish this beer was available in Illinois, and would love to try Terrapin's other offerings."
"From shivtim (thanks). Pours orange brown with a nice white head. Clingy, spotty lacing. Smells of fresh rye bread, nic floral hops. Tastes is slightly bitter, well hopped. Flavors of light lemons, rye, and with a bit bite. Tangy, bready rye is a nice compliment to lemony hops. Light bodied and smooth. Nicely drinkable, tasty and well put-together. Up there with the Founders Ryes."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, if you’re in the mood for this type of beer this is a good one to drink several of."
"I am loving the fact that this brewery is licensed now and working full steam."
"I could drink this beer everyday, it's my favorite of the Pale Ale style. I'm looking forward to trying other beers with rye in them."
"One of my favorite Southern beers. A nice blend of flavors and huge drinkability make this a good year round sessioner."
"Drinkability is good... plenty of flavor and nice smells to keep it interesting. Maybe my favorite APA thus far!"
"Best before date of 30Nov07, five days too late. Before I get started I just want to say that I am usually pretty wary of any beer that has one city's name on the label yet is made in a different state all together. Very havy light copper beer topped with a fluffy head that slightly laces its way down the glass. Smell is soapy and grainy with maybe some bitter chocolate. Not very pleasant at all and quite a challenge to get past. Mouthfeel it rather light and not much to the taste. Upon swallowing the soapyness and grains come back into play with some slight banana and clove notes. Very subtle citrusy hops tag along in the aftertaste. Ends slightly dry. My first rye beer, kind of dissapointed (sorry Bob). Could have been expired, only a second tasting will tell."
"drinkability: good"
"D: Good session beer. Nice one to sit down with on an average Tuesday night."
"Final thoughts  Its an OK brew for a Rye ale but there are much better choices out there.."
"D: Very drinkable. Nice twist on a classic style and I'd love to have easy access to this.. Would make an excellent session beer for cards or yard work."
"Aroma is clean with subtle hints of Rye character and graininess, underneath a clearly citrusy american hop profile. The taste profile on this beer is clean and dry with a hop bitterness that brings you back for more, with just enough malt character to balance the tipping point towards astringency. This is a brew that goes well with a nice summer BBQ but would also be able to stand up to roasted duck and turkey. Extremely drinkable, two six packs shot out in less than 2 hours I recall, after everyone drinking the Corona criticized me and my brothers for getting ""more beer""."
"If you haven't had Terrapin Rye and your local (pub or store) has it, do yourself a favor and give it a chance! You won't be disappointed. If you are, well, I can't help you! I really can't stress how drinkable this beer is. Just lovely. I look forward to taking a tour of Terrapin's new facilities in Athens at some point sooner than later! On a closing note, I believe I'll have another Terrapin Rye right now. If I ever leave GA the two beer-related things I'll miss the most will be the Brick Store Pub and Terrapin beer. Cheers!"
"Overall: I really like this beer. I have drank numerous sixers of it over the summer and I often turn to it as a session brew. I like Rye beers and am thankful Terrapin has come to Florida."
"D - I'm not a huge fan of the Pale Ale style, but this was a great beer and one I'll be back for again"
"Drinkability - a fast 12 ounces, that was. No problem polishing off a handful of these."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, citrusy, juicy, chewy, balanced nicely, with a dry finish."
"Relatively thin body with a dry finish. Balance makes for an enjoyable, and highly drinkable beer."
"Overall this is a fine beer. It's my first from Terrapin, a newcomer to Florida. I look forward to trying more."
"Drinkability was good. A very refreshing brew"
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with a white head. Aromas that are hoppy and sweet. In the taste, a dry rye smoothness, with very small hop presence. A smooth mouthfeel and a dry mouth aftertaste. Nice rye dryness, smooth and just about right everywhere. Very enjoyable."
"Very nice, Terrapin!"
"Come to me in a pint glass it has a light brown color with a thin head that leaves lacing around the glass. The smell is of rye and a little hoppy. I enjoyed the taste of this beer quite a bit malt and hops stood out. Mouthfeel is pretty good medium carbonation and good after taste that sticks around. I think this is a good beer but its not one that I'd drink all night long."
"I really like this Terrapin APA. Easy to drink and enjoy."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy off-white head, not much sticky lacing follows. The nose is hoppy, some malts, slight citrus, and caramel. The taste is nice and hoppy, slightly malty/citrus, and some caramel. The finish is slightly dry and bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty APA, would buy if it was around here. Glad to have had a chance to try it."
"Had this on draught at the Emerald Coast Brew Fest in Pensacola, FL. Also had in bottle. Pours an attractive orangey-copper color. Hop aroma is evident as soon as you pop the top from the bottle. The rye is evident in the aroma as well. Taste has a very prevalent hop character up front that tranforms into a malty finish that balances well. Good mouthfeel, drinkability is high. I loved this one."
"Drinkability, oh ya. A good flavorful session brew. Alittle complex or entertaining, but easy to just enjoy"
"Poured into a pint glass pours a rustic golden copper with a fluffy foamy head that left some insane lace on the glass. Smell is roasted barley and malt and a bit of hoppy character in there, also some roasted rye and wheat in the mix as well. Taste is a flavor explosion and a damn fine offering at that I can taste a bit of malty bread with a tangy tart hop bitter, and also some roasted chicken and a bit of wheat freshly grounded up in the mix as well. This was my first offering of Terrapin and finally we get some love in Florida, can't wait for their other brews to make it to the state."
"D: This, to me, speaks of innovation in the APA category. For a style that has been beaten to death, Terrapin breathes new life into its rotting corpse. Okay, maybe that's a bit too much, but you see what I'm getting at here: this is a pale ale that will stand out in a crowd and wow you with its drinkable nature and balanced flavor."
"Terrapin Rye Pale Ale pours an apricot color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a very nice mix of malt and hops in the aroma. The hops are piney/citrusy in character. This is a particularly well balanced ale. The flavor has a strong, noticeable malt backbone that stands up nicely to the hoppy, citrus and pine bitterness. I'm not sure that I can pick rye out as a flavor, but I don' t doubt it has a contribution. Well done."
"D - So smooth it is really a well made beer. I recommend it, today it was my breakfast beer w/ eggs covered in applewood smoked mozzarella."
"Drinkability/Notes: A session beer through and through. Has enough flavor so as not to get boring. A nice fruity and biscuity maltiness that is balanced out by both citrusy,herbal, and earthy hops. The rye lends a bit of spiciness. Overall a nice pale ale. A beer worth seeking out. Recommended."
"Overall impression: Very nice, very drinkable - I wish this were available at home!"
"Perfect day for this beer, 100 degrees plus. Poured a nice reddish amber color, clear, with off white head. Nice lacing on the glass. Smells of a bit of rye (I think, maybe the power of suggestion) and piney hops. Taste is very clean, piney hops, I don't get as much citrus as others seem to. Very nice bit of oily mouth feel. The bitterness lingers in a pleasant way. Nice highly drinkable beer, taste remains remarkebly consistent as it warms."
"Overall, this is a beer that is new to my area, and I'm glad it is. Very tasty and unique. I really enjoyed the rye in addition to the delicate balance between the malt and hops. Highly recommended!"
"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden-orange. The head is thick and bubbly if poured aggressively, but fades fast to a loose bubbly layer. Somewhat fruity in the nose, sweet, but with sort of a sour, very slight earthy smell as well. Weirdly enough, for a beer that isn't close to one, it sure takes on the smell of many DIPA's I've had, mostly because of the malty sweetness. Lots of light but sweet malt combined with citrus hops (probly the cascade aspect of the beer). The citrus aspect comes off juicy over the middle of the sip, but the beer finishes semi-dry. The other hops used in this are more of the earthy subtle English type hops, probably giving it the dry earthy finish it shows. The carbonation seemed a bit high in the glass I initially poured but I transfered that to another glass and it came out ok, just needed to warm up a bit and release some carbonation. A good beer. A little more rye or a little more hops would have been nice in this."
"Medium body, fizzy all over the palate for about 5 seconds. A touch bitter finishing with a hoppy/resiny aftertaste that fades evenly and gradually. A touch more lager-like than expected from a pale ale, but not a bad beer."
"One of my favorite pales. Like no other."
"D - A nice easy drinking pale. I could drink this one all day."
"I personally would have liked some more hops and a bit more of the rye character to come through but I still enjoyed this beer quite a bit, I look forward to more of their beers in the future."
"Drinkability: it's wonderfully easy to consume this beer. Definitely find this on tap if you can."
"Pours a darker golden with a decent little head on top. Hop presence on the nose. Nicely balanced between hops and malts is more reminiscent of a 2IPA rather than an APA. Very slightly sweet with a smooth, thick finish with some biitterness at the end. Id have this one again. Thanks to dherling for this bottle."
"This beer shows that you can make a complex, flavorful beer and also make it easy to drink and refreshing. I could drink this at the beach or with a fine dinner - a very versatile brew."
"Appearance was golden, with mild effervescence and a clean-look. Good two-finger head retention. Smell was incredible, almost as if I was about to eat a bowl of hops; spicy and woody. Taste, definitely lived up to the smell and then some. Light touch of maltiness, with a big, spicy hop bite throughout. Overall pleasing to the palate and a great tasting beer."
"Drinkability: Although i can't honestly say that i can really notice the rye, this beer does have an interesting, different, and fresh taste. Nice APA hoppiness but not too much , and a great mouthfeel, quite quaffable."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"spicey or exotic food joints"
"Appears thick and golden in the glass with a short white head. Aroma is solid with west coast hops and an intricate grain mix. The rye's hegemony really comes through in the taste with a coarse and spicy flavor that is very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is full and oily slick. Exceptional drinkability, tasty and quite quenching. Thanks go out to Dan from NC for this treat."
"Drinkability: Quite smooth...goes down well."
"I like pale ales and this one has a subtle uniqueness to it that I can""t quite place. It has a nice sweet bitter balance and stays lively for quite sime time in a glass. I think it also has a little tangy bite the blends in well. I could drink this beer as a thirst quenching brew. One of my favorite styles. Can't wait till MM gets it on tap shortly."
"Poured at Taco Mac in Woodstock, GA...appears a copper orange hue while the head forms thick and frothy appears a slight off white and elaves even thick chunks of lacing with each sip. Aroma has a spicy rye component but mainly citrus grapefruit and grassy overtones create the hop aspect of this brew very spicy the hoppy flow is green and fresh with sweet bicuit malt tones balancing it all out what a great smelling pale ale. Flavor hoppy assertive but complex and original the Amarillo hops really leave their mark on my palate heavy grapefruit and citrus components with a strong bitterness and big flavors with spicy rye and moderate sweetnees from the biscuit malt presence very well done. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate smoooth carbonation, slick and oily with some hop resins flowing here. Drinkability favorite beer while visiting the south it just left a mark on me and I could have drank it by the sixer great stuff it really sets the bar for Terrapin Beer."
"This pours a golden copper hue with a one finger head that dies down to a thin layer after pour. Lacing is quite sticky throughout. Smell is a grassy rye (who woulda thunk it) with a nice crisp hint of hops. A nice bit of malt is also present in the nose as well, very pleasant odor. Taste is of a toasted rye (once again, who woulda thunk it). Lemony hops do tingle the tounge at first, but then sugary sweetness comes through and ends with a nice bready malt to tie things up. Mouthfeel is a bit weak, maybe some more carbonation to give it more life. Balance is terrific though. Love the rye ales, and this one doesn't disappoint. Would like to see more breweries expand into this category, only time will tell. The turtle playin' the banjo on the label is pretty bitchin' too I must say."
"Very drinkable...one of the better pale ales I have had...highly recommended...Zorbaz in DL has about 10-thousand different beers on tap including many hard to find Rogue and Sierra Nevada beers along with others...I don't get there often and like to try a few but I was damn near sticking with this beer the entire time....excellent beer."
"a clean refreshing pale ale, with a nice touch of spice and rye, that makes this an incredibly rewarding and drinkable pale ale."
"D-a good session ale which is slightly different from the rest. Definitely let this warm up"
"D: Easy to drink, a great local brew here in Atlanta - becoming widely available from one of the best breweries in the south."
"Notes: Special thanks to mikesgroove for the 12 oz. sample via No Name BIF."
"On tap about 2 years later at Dunderbanks. Good not great.Lagerish, lacey."
"This beer poured a clear copper color with a nice creamy head which soon began to disappear. The aroma is strong of hops, but there is some malt noticeable upon second inhalation. The taste is hoppy and bitter, but mixes nicely with some hints of malt. There is a grainy note. The mouthfeel is full and somewhat creamy. I think this would be a rather drinkable brew. I havent had the pleasure of drinking many rye beers, but if this is any indication, Ive been missing out."
"Bronze color with a thin off white head. Head falls to a thin film that leaves some streaky lacing. Smell is nice crisp citrus hops. Taste follows suit with a nice burst of hops up front. That is followed by a solid grain backbone, i can only assume that is the rye. Crisp, is the word that keeps coming to mind. Very nicely balanced beer, finishes clean. Overall i'm very impressed with this one, enough hops to give it some punch, but a balance that a lot of beers i've tried lately have been lacking."
"Drinkability: Pretty good."
"D: A unique beer, and very enjoyable. Not what I'd want every beer to taste like, but it's a nice change of pace from most APAs, and I can down one or two very easily."
"The flavor and the nose match up. At 5.3 ABV quite drinkable; a good session beer."
"Poured a crisp light copper with a razor thin head. The aroma was very strong on earthy citrus and pine hops with caramel malt making a strong presence as well. The beer was very well balanced between the earthy hops and sweet caramel malts, nice and slightly complex. The beer sits medium on the tongue and is nice and crisp with a slight but tolerable bitterness. This is a very enjoyable APA."
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my Dogfish Head shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a clear deep copper color with about an inch of dense off-white foam. Plenty of lacing is left on the glass with each sip. The rye notes are certainly present in the nose along with pine and citrus fruits. Tastes of crisp, slightly sour rye grain followed by bitter grapefruit and sweet caramel. Medium in both body and carbonation. Smooth and drinkable. It's a shame I can't get this on a regular basis without trading for it."
"Overall, quite drinkable. A nice summer beer."
"Tasted great after a long, strenuous game-watching. The rye met with other organic notes of barley and wheat, with the hops dominating the aftertaste. I could seriously drink this beer all night. Another good one, Terrapin...keep 'em coming."
" This was simply stated an awesome beer. Extremely drinkable and could have easily put down 10 of these all night long. Would probably have gone very well with some pizza, as the Terrapin Rye is my all time favorite pizza beer. Our first Freakin Firkin Friday was Friggin Fantastic! I cannot wait for another and hope Terrapin will stop by again!"
"I love rye beers, and this is one fine beer. I could easily slug these back all day long, and probably even more so in the summer. Fans of rye beers, APAs, or just balanced beers in general will want to check this one out."
"A fine looking beer from the start with nice white head and orange body. Big aroma right out of the bottle with apples and citrus before biscuity malts come in. Fairly fruity flavor with a decent bitterness. Very nicely balanced and a bit complex. This beer is certainly a winner. It's not the hoppiest, but its easy and interesting to drink."
"Slightly chewy but still so smooth. I could drink this beer all day. A wonderful pale ale that I will try again (hopefully this will be in Tallahassee soon)."
"Cheers!"
"This is a good everyday beer. It's highly sessionable and goes down quite easy. Not something to write home about, but it would be nice to see a sixer in the fridge."
"Notes: This was brewed for Terrapin Beer by Fredrick Brewing Co. of Fredrick MD."
"Very drinkable, this is a great beer. I wish I could get it in Illinois."
"Fairly average, light amber with good carbonation and smaller head that doesn't have much staying power. Good smell of light grapefruit and other citrusy hops, along with an underlying spice. Great taste that is quite thirst quenching to say the least. Juicy and citrusy with a peppery hop character as well. Light caramel and biscuit flavors. Great crispness in the mouth and light bodied, making it go down all too easy. Possibly my favorite regular session beer."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this brew. I've liked everything from I've tried and this pale ale is no different. This rye/pale ale hybrid is unique and interesting. Highly recommended."
"Light airy head after pour that lingers for a little while. Aroma is hoppy with some malty sweetness. The sweetness of the beer hit your tounge first and is nicely balanced at the finish with noticable bitterness. The rye give the malt character something unique. Pretty light on the palate with medium lacing on the glass. Overall an excellent example of a pale ale."
"D- I was expecting a lot more rye than what came out. You really had to pin point it down to make it noticeable. It is good but I would prefer a regular pale ale."
"An excellent beer with a slightly unusual flavor."
"A decent beer, but nothing about it stands out."
"I like flavorful beers, and this has a good strong hoppy taste with just a whisper of bitterness. One can taste the craft-brew attitude that goes into it. This is one beer that would be hard to improve."
"Thanks to brentk56 for this one."
"Flavor is so smooth. Does not exhaust the taste buds or grow boring. Malts and hops are perfectly balanced. Some slight biscuits. The rye gives it all a nice sourness that matches with the sweet and the bitters. Slightly dry mouthfeel that leaves you looking foward to the next sip. I have to control myself and make sure each sixer I have picked up since moving down to NC lasts."
"Overall, this is extremely drinkable and I could easily have more than one! Highly recommended."
"D - Very good APA, almost in a different style/class, though...hard to put a finger on it. I really enjoyed the subtle hoppiness breaking through the grainy texture and flavor. Thanks mikesgroove!"
"Pours a nice golden caramel color with nice head that quickly dissipates to a small thin ring. Smell is of roasted malt with slight rye hint and some fruit. Taste is a little light overall with not as much complexity as the smell would indicate. It feels OK on the mouth, again a little thin. Drinkability is good. Overall a decent pale ale."
"Definitely a drinker if you are in the mood for a sweet IPA."
"Life is good."
"Delicious stuff that has the swing and character of a big boozy beer without being a big boozy beer. On the lookout for more Terrapin stuff, immediately."
"From bottle, August 14, 2009: Thanks Freethyhops!"
"I'll most likely have this again."
"This is a quality beer and a different take on the style. Makes for a great anytime beer."
"Thanks to timtheenchanta for the chance to quaff it!"
"Pours a deep clear golden straw color with light tight white cap. Aroma is a slight herbal spice, floral, malty, and citrus. Flavor is very nice clean malt with spice, floral, hint of grapefruit, and touch of rye at the finish. Very nice pale ale with subtle notes to give you something to think about. Nice medium carbonation, medium-light body, and dry finish. Wonderful!"
"I was glad to finally find this beer after reading about it in Southern Brew News. It poured really well, but didn't have very good head retention. I did pick up on light floral tones. I really enjoyed the flavor it was well balanced with a little bite in the back of the throat."
"Bottle courtesy of Mr_Kimchee: Poured an hazy dirty yellow color ale with a medium bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of citrus hops and big malt is easily identifiable. Taste is well balance mix between big malt with some noticeable rye presence as well as a bitter finish with cirtusy hops. Body is above average and carbonation is a bit lower then expected. Another fine beer from this great brewery."
"A perfect, flavorful beer for a warm and sunny day."
"Drinkability: Not nearly as exhilarating as I'd like, but a solid American Pale Ale just the same."
"D: Very drinkable, a good session rye."
"Crisp and balanced. Very refreshing and easy to drink while retaining some interest. One of my favorite every day beers, especially in the summer."
"Pours a coppery color with a thin white head that was fairly sticky. Smelled of citrusy hops and some sweetness. Tasted of orange from the hops and some sweetness. As the beer warmed (didn't take long in the heat we had at the tailgate site) the taste started to leave the the citrusy side and became sweeter. Very smooth but a little thin in the mouth. Fairly drinkable. Had no problem polishing off a sixer as the day went on."
"This poured with a big, thick, creamy off-white/light-tan head. The nose was quite hoppy, with a citrus smell really evident. The color was a slightly cloudy orangish-amber. The mouthfeel was medium and I didn't experience the hops as much on the tongue as the nose led me to expect. Instead, the flavor was more malty-sweet than bitter, although I did get a rye bite on the finish. As an APA, it was okay, but I can think of others that I might reach for first."
"Served on tap in a standard pint glass @ Brixx Pizza, Mt. Pleasant, S.C. A: Deep gold with light to med head and resilient lacing. S: Excellent nose with evergreen hints, spices and of course the hops. T: Very true to the aroma with a strong but pleasant finishing hopped punch M: light to med with enough viscosity to coat the palate D: Very smooth and sessionable. Beers like this are making me order pale ales more frequently these days."
"Drinkability = All night long."
"Poured to a golden orange with medium thick off-white head and decent lacing. From the beginning, the aroma was a pleasant hoppy citrus, mostly grapefruit and lemons, with some floral accent. The flavor was a slightly bitter continuation of the citrus aroma and very hoppy. The palate had a hint of sour at the beginning, but rounded nicely by the malt to a long smooth finish. This is one of the best APAs Ive had."
"Overall, a very drinkable APA, and one I will be picking up again."
"This isn't groundbreaking pale ale, but I find it tasty and think it would be pretty sweet on tap."
"Pours a light amber with a nice tan head. The aroma has a big citrusy hop character upfront, along with some rye, caramel and biscuity malt, alcohol and some fruity esters. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with big citrus and piney hop notes, along with caramel and toasted bread, slight rye sourness, fruity esters, yeast and some ethanol. The mouthfeel is smooth with good drinkability. As a whole a tasty, complex and drinkable pale ale...very nice."
"A bit of a weird beer to my tastes, definitely refreshing and sessionable. I drank several of these and was thirsting for more. Overall a good beer that definitely hits the spot thirst wise."
"d - has a nice dry finish though not a lot of lacing in glass throughout."
"Bottom Line: Terrapin Rye is Real Tasty and awfully drinkable. Really hits the spot on a hot day like this one. I may have found a new session beer"
"drinkability = goes down very easy and is a pleasure to drink. this is a beer that should be enjoyed, not guzzled!!!!"
"I'm actually enjoying this rather modest offering from Terrapin a rather great deal more than their ""Big Beers"" that I've had, the Wake 'N Bake and Big Hoppy Monster."
"Golden-amber color with a decent-sized, white head. Very nice retention all the way through drinking. Smell is somewhat malty with an earthy, grassy hops presence and a touch of rye. Taste is sweet, sort of bready-malty with pretty strong hops bitterness in the finish and a grassiness that I didn't particularly like as it seemed harsh. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth with a light-medium body and not too much carbonation. A drinkable beer that left me wanting to have a couple at a time."
"D - very, very tasty beer and highly drinkable due to fresh hop flavor, dry finish, balance, and moderate alcohol content. Well crafted beer and a great example of how you can make a great beer without going over the top on hops and malt. Refreshing."
"M/D: My review does not do this beer justice....I was really impressed by the overall appearance, smell, and flavor. The only way to describe it is delicious. I was only taking brief notes while I drank it, but it was much better on tap than I remember from the bottle. Moderate carbonation, medium bodied, and accompanied my spicy sushi nicely. If you haven't had it definitely get one next time you see it."
"Poured a golden amber with a mild haziness and mild carbonation. There existed a rich foamy white head that stuck around for a good while, and left excellent lacing. There was a good ammoutn fo floral hops to the aroma, with sweet and sour fruits present, very mild malts if any. It was a very balanced taste, with sweetness and sour playing off eachotehr well. Hops and mild yeasts present as well. Biscuit or grain and malty taste linger after each sip. At first bitter and sour, but quickly turns sweet and smooth and finally rather dry in the mouthfeel. I was impressed and could have had a few more of these. Definitely a good first impression from Terrapin."
"I am not a big APA fan, but if more APA style beers were like this I think I would enjoy them more. Terrapin really nailed this one. Job well done."
"Nice and refreshing."
"floral, grassy hops followed by a sweet, malty rye flavor. finishes clean and balanced. very drinkable; the glass is empty before you know it."
"Drinkability was really good - solid, albeit a sort of pedestrian beer, but easily quaffed. To me if you are going to take the time to make a rye beer, then make one, don't just use it as a sort of adjunct filler which seems to be the case here. Be interested in the Rye ^2 to see if they pull that one off."
"The ale pours a dark gold with a white head (inch) which quickly disappears. Lacing does appear down the glass. Hoppy almost yeasty aroma, hops dominate flavor with some yeasty malt that comes through. Aftertaste has a pleasant bitterness with some sweet malt at the end. I'm not sure if the yeastiness is the rye malt or what. Overall effect is that this is a solid APA for everyday drinking but nothing extraordinary."
"-SS"
"Overall I was not enticed to grab another bottle of this."
"overall, surprisingly tame when compared to other rye beers i've had, like hop rod and the rail mail from willimantic brewing. that's the east coast for ya, and it allows this to move closer towards a solid session beer.. not a 'split the bomber and done' vibe. nice, thanks."
"Sampled on 3/23/06 from 12 ounce bottle poured into glass. Purchased mixed six pack at Southern Market in Myrtle Beach. Contract brewed at Frederick Maryland. Bright clear copper with medium head and carbonation. Nose is dry hoppy and grassy. Flavor is malty crisp and dry. Beautiful finish is also crisp. Medium length finish leaves you wanting more. Good Stuff."
"This beer pours a golden orange with a frothy white head that leaves a nice lace and nice film. The first aroma that hits your nose is the combination of grapefruity citrusy hops grainy rye. Again the flavor is quite hop forward as is the smell but it is balanced nicely with pale malts and spicy rye. The mouthfeel rather full for a pale ale and has a nice carbonation. Overall one of the best pale ales out there and one to definitely get again and again."
"Poured into an Imperial Pint glass. No date on the bottle. Dark hazy gold body with a mediocre white head that drops down to faint whisps of foam. Just spots of lace. Mild floral hops with some spicy rye in the nose. A light to medium body, some citrus/floral hops in the middle of my tongue. Also grainy malt on the finish. Smooth drinking and not very aggressive. Should be a good beer to go with a meal."
"This beer pours a slightly cloudy light orange color. There was not much head. The smell is citrus like. A very sweet smell. The taste is a bitter hoppy taste that is not too strong. The mouthfeel is relativly smooh. There is a bit of lasting bitterness. I could drink these again. Too bad I have to drive a hour each way up a mountain to get Terrapin. It has to go up the mountain to get to the store. So why not drop some off at the bottom of the mountain Skyland Distributing?"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" off-white head above the clear dark gold/light amber brew. Head lasts well, with plentiful foamy lacing. Aroma is rye with floral hops. Taste is smooth rye character upfront, with ample citris hoppiness coming on next, and a lingering bitter on the close. Mouthfeel and drinkability both great. Probably a nice session brew for the locals."
"D: Very drinkable session beer that I highly recommend!"
"Drinkability and Overall: This is an excellent pale ale. I'm quite impressed by this beer and if the mood struck me I could drink it all afternoon."
"Big thanks go out to timtheenchanta for the opportunity to try this one."
"Overall: A fine hoppy brew that's as drinkable as any I've come across."
"I must say that I am biased towards Terrapin, and my review follows accordingly; the Rye Pale Ale is my sentimental favorite. A Great brewery, and this beer is one that I can drink all night enjoyably. I can't wait to go back to Georgia for more."
"The neck ring says that 5 different hop varieties are used, Ill buy that."
"A thin and watery beer, with a fair amount of carbonation and a very bitter finish."
"Tasted: 01/07/06"
"got this in a trade with TheBeerCellar2. poured dark orange, with a white head, that left a little lacing. aroma, hops, citrus leaning towards the lemon side, fruity, some malts. flavor, hops, malts a touch of honey, citrus, a combination of lemon and orange. not to bad"
"One of my roommates brought a sample of this beer back from Athens for me."
"The mouthfeel is great and this is very sessionable (I had four in one sitting). I really enjoyed this one and it went well with my buffalo steak."
"Notes: good, not great"
"edit - I scored this too low for its style! As far as Pale Ales go this one kicks ass."
"Crisp and clean mouthfeel. Smooth on the palate as well. A wonderful beer that surprised the hell out of me."
"Pours a clear orangey-amber color out of the bottle. Small foamstand. Palpable scent of tangy citrus, pine needles, and freshly mown grass. Nice and hoppy just the way I like it. Aggressive bitterness at first sip fades into crisp, clean finish of rye. Some catty, dank hop flavors reminiscent of Simcoe or Chinook. Good hop character melds with maltiness to strike a good balance. A nice session beer."
"Pours a light copper color wit ha light head that falls quickly to nothing at all. Good clarity too. Nose is what I expect from an APA. Lots of earthy hop with a moderate caramel base. I get a small bit of spicey rye in there, but not a lot. Flavor is nice. Peppery hop, slightly sweet citrusy hop with a very healthy backbone of caramel. No rye that I can taste. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. This is a tasty APA. Flavors are full on hop with a really nice balancing caramel. Good brew."
"Thanks to mntlover for this very tasty Pale Ale - now I have one more reason to visit Atlanta."
"I could drink this all night. Pity I only got one bottle."
"Thanks to rajendra82 for the bottle."
"A decent offering and I am very pleased to get the chance to try."
"Drinkability: Good. A touch on the thin side for me but very well balanced and very enjoyable. Recommended."
"Had this at the Mellow Mushroom in Blowing Rock,NC with a jerk chicken pizza and it complimented it very well.Poured into a mason jar a light copper color with fluffy white head,aromas are quite hoppy heavy on the grapefruit and lemon rind with a touch of caramel underneath the hops.This beer is not heavy on the rye but its noticable on the palate just light sour note in the finish mainly the Pacific coast-type hop comes thru but a firm dry malt base keeps this quite balanced and quaffable.A pretty solid beer not over the top rye wise by any means and food friendly I wish I could get it here in Greensboro."
"Drinkability- Damn, three good beers in one day! The beer gods are smiling upon me. A great rye beer."
"Taste is quite hoppy, bitter citrus (grapefruit, orange peel) and a grainy maltiness. I would attribute the rye for the graininess. Nicely balanced and the hops linger a bit on the palate along with the grainy sweet malt. Drinkable for sure. Nice twist on the pale ale."
"Drinkability: This is one of the better rye ales out there. Very well balanced, and very tasty. I could have this one as a daily session ale if I were an everyday drinker. I highly recommend this one!"
"-UF"
"Picked up a six at Scrooge's in Anderson, SC on my way back from Clemson. Pours a hazy, reddish orange with a thick, rocky off white head. Good lacing. Light citrusy aroma with a bready background. Taste is well balanced between the flavorful hops and the caramel malt. My first rye beer and definitely not my last. Outstanding! Thanks to bobbyc881 for helping me find it."
"Bottle obtained from GCBrewingCO...thanks for the opportunity. Pours a half-finger light yellow head over a nearly clear light orange liquid. Smells grapefruity pith and oranges. Tastes apricot to start with a supporting wet sweet. This falls away sharply as sharp carbonation and a mild hop bitter step in. A moment of that and an aromatic hop floral slowly rises up the throat bringing orange and tangerine flavors. The apricot makes a reappearance and brings with it a bready malt. Md-light body, moderately carbonated, and decent lacing on the inside of the glass."
"A decent enough pale ale. Quick and quaffable with a slight warming spicy heat. Very easy going stuff."
"Drinkability is great a nice touch adding some rye to a nice pale ale. Have enjoyed before but just got around to reviewing it, a nice brew."
"What can I say ... balanced and very drinkable. A session rye ale for sure."
"This was one refreshing brew. If you like rye bread, then this beer is one for you. It was a nice cloudy golden color, with a frothy off white head. The head slowy died out into a laceing. The smell was a nice rye smell, mixed with some light fruits, and light malts. The big thing in the smell and taste was the presense of rye. It was my first rye beer, but definately won't be my last, as it has opened the doors to that area. It's also a very refreshing beer, one that could easily be enjoyed on a hot summer's day."
"An extremely drinkable beer... this is one of the new regular beers in the fridge, and probably will be the first keg in the new kegerator."
"Nothing special, but hits the spot on a hot day. Clean, drinkable, tasty. Thanks to rajendra82 for the bottle!"
"Honey colored beer makes a valient attempt at head but just can't hang on for more than about ten seconds. Whats left of the head hangs on for dear life as lacing. Virtually odorless. Citrus notes add a tang to an otherwise slightly bitter pale ale. The rye, which isn't as pronounced as I was hoping sneaks out at the end makes itself known in the aftertaste. Don't let the numbers lie to you, its all about the taste with this beer, and if you like Pale Ale, its definately one you should taste."
"Pours a clear brilliant copper color, minimal head or retention. Aroma is light, yet citrus hops. Flavor is well balanced, but leaning toward the hoppy side, which is nice. Mouthfeel is great, a touch on the thick side which is pleasant. Greatly drinkable. Now, if I could only find it around here...."
"The body is on the light side of medium and could use a little bulking up. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean and the finish is long and hoppy."
"cloudy orangish color, small short lasting head, hoppy smell. immediate hop taste, followed by a distinct rye malt, then a smooth hoppy finish. a great beer. on a side note, the artwork on the bottle is unique and the company website is entertaining."
"Drinkability: A nice twist on the APA style that is well worth seeking out"
"Golden in color-darker then say a Bud or macro but not the deeper gold/orange hue you would find in your usual pale ale. Mellow aroma-somewhat citrusy and floral. Nice sweet malty flavor with a crisp dry finish. Nice hop bitterness. Good mouthfeel. A very pleasing beer overall. The first I have had from this brewery. Well done American Pale."
"Guest beer at 5 Seasons Brewing Company in Atlanta."
"A hazey yellow/amber beer. Has a nice foamy off white head. The aroma is a pleasant grapefruit hop aroma with a hint of grain sweetness in the background. The flavor starts with a light sweetness that slides smoothly into a nice hop note with a nice clen finish. Should be an excellent beer for hot weather...tasty yet refreshing."
"Taste: nice. Creamy, with a citric bite. Has a gritty tang that I kind of like. Rolls handily along the tongue, smooth, easily quaffable, medium-bodied, wit a crisp smack on the palate...creamy, again...nice...I like this one, although it's not too complex, despite what the label claims..labels always lie, what can you do..."
"12oz brown bottle. Pours a slightly cloudy, but bright, amber, topped with a decent 2 finger thick foamy head that settles to a respectable clinging lace. Touch of sweetness in the nose, with a lightly sour/rye character, and floral pith. Soft mouthfeel, light-bodied, with a touch malt body. Gentle sweetness, light hoppiness and phenols from the rye. Pithy, with a tea and bready linger. Flavor becomes quite malty and even sweeter as the beer warms. Grainy tannins in the finish, not overly pleasant ones. Balanced, but not overly impressive."
"Thanks to Southernbrew for my chance to taste my first-ever beer from Georgia. Dark copper color, with a haze that is illuminated to a bright gold color. Moderate head on the pour, fades to a creamy layer after a couple seconds. Smell is very fruity and slightly piney, from the 5 varieties of hops, as the bottle says. Taste is very hop dominated, but is definitely well balanced with the sizable malt backing. Finishes slightly sweet, but it is a well rounded beer."
"Terrapin Rye Pale Ale is a very good beer that possesses most of my favorite IPA qualities. It may not be for everyone, but I love it and wish I had a case at this very moment. And a second one for tomorrow. The terrapin/tortoise/turtle won the race, didn't he? A big Thank You to aracauna for providing."
"After the bartender told me my first five choices were out, I figured this local brew would be available. Much more of a rye than an IPA, that is a bit overwhelming to the palate and nose. nice color, lacing, and carbonation, like it came from the brewery that day. A bit too havy after a long session of different beers. May be more drinkable if this was my first. Wouldn't mind trying some other Terrapin brews next time I'm in Athens."
"Really should be categorized as a Rye Pale Ale, rather than an American PA, even though was judged as PA at GABF. Anyway, I think the on-tap version has a better mouthfeel and a much more pronounced rye taste and smell than the bottled version. This is one of our favorite every day beers as my wife and I both love hoppy beers. Definite grapefruit and pine smell. Pours a gold/pale amber with an off-white head. Minimal lacing."
"Pours a cloudy golden straw color with medium creamy off-white head. The head dissipates quickly, leaving a sheen and moderate lace. Smells quite green, fresh, and hoppy, with grapefruit, a bit of rye, and a touch of mint. Taste begins with sweet malts, develops lots of bitter grapefruit hop coarseness, and finishes with a slightly minty and spicy rye-bread twinge. Creamy and well-carbonated medium body. Extremely crisp, fresh, and refreshing!"
"Pours a slightly cloudy peachy golden hue with a thin, half-inch head that subsides after a couple of minutes. Very nice floral hoppy aroma, with a tad of astringency. Palate is well-balanced, with fruity (grapefruit) hops melding with a light sweet malt. The rye acts to increase the bitterness towards the back of the mouth, leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice and substantial, but slightly foamy. I could drink this all night. A great session beer."

"Good mouthfeel. Highly quaffable brew and my general session beer in Atlanta. This is what I usually pick up on tap when I'm not at a good beer bar."
"Great beer if you like a well-balanced hoppy beer this is it. A beutiful smell of what I am guessing is some low IBU citrus hops. Has a grapefruity, citrus, piney smell that all hopheads love. The rye comes through in the taste but only as a plater to serve the juicy hops. It balances well with a medium body and I could drink this all day long and it wouldn't get old."
"And that makes all the difference. A bit of rye, underneath the already strong hops. Lovely beer."
"This beer is robustly hoppy, yet it still possesses a sense of mildness and balance. A beautiful thing and probably my favorite southern brewed beer. Much respect to Terrapin Beer Co. for this masterpiece."
"Sampled from a 12 oz bottle. Pours a light orange with a minimal head that dissolved to nothing within minutes. Nice hoppy aroma of pink grapefruit & grassy hop flowers. Sweet & relatively substantial malt baseline attempts to balance this well hopped ale. Moderate bitterness with lemony citrus hops in the flavor. Medium bodied, but seemed a bit undercarbonated. Finished clean & crisp, this hopped up pale is extremely drinkable."
"A really attracive bottle design by the way. I see a great future ahead for Terrapin Beer Company."
"A dark, orange amber brew with a nice white head that lasts for a bit, and leaves decent lacing on my glass as well. The aromas are awesome. I smell rye bread, fresh, oily hops, a few spicy hop notes, and some citrus fruits as well. The taste of this brew is very well integrated. There is definately an excelent blend of flavors going on here. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is simply awesome! A very interesting RYEPA!"
"Taste: Crisp and dry, with very nice hop flavor. I'd call this a pale ale along the lines of SNPA in terms of bitterness, but with more character. Rye addition gives a nice full body and a distinct dryness overall. Finishes crisp and dry, with fresh-baked Jewish rye bread lingering on and vying with the hop remainder for attention. Excellent."
"A quandry, this. If this beer were a straight IPA, I'd give it mad props. But the whole selling point of this beer is its unique ""RyePA"" identity. In that sense, it's a bit of a letdown. I like the concept, but there's just far too much weight on the hops; the rye is all but wasted. Tasty, but a bit pointless; it's ""WhyPA?"""
"Very good beer. Easy to drink and an interesting IPA-like brew."
"Great big sprucey hops. Wet head clings to the glass. I guess this is what they mean by a sticky head. Nice burst of flavor from the hops followed by the malt, the rye makes an interesting character. The finish is a nice lingering hop bitterness. Perfect match for a good pizza. This is such a great beer. Sweetwater IPA just lost the ranking as my favorite GA beer."
