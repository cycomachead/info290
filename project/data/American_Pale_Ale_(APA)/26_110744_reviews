"Good mouthfeel. Smooth and balanced. Not too bitter for the style!"

"Pretty good but the nose is not as awesome as most APA's, but is very drinkable.... just not memorable."

"It's taken me far too long to try this stuff, so lucky me that Beelow's just happened to tap this one as their Three Floyds rotator recently.  It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises cantaloupe, bright grapefruit, white grape, honey, peach, and passion fruit.  Feel the fruit salad!  The taste takes a slightly different path, opting for grapefruit zest, mild orange peel, light greens, and mild honey-laden biscuit.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, pretty durn nice pale ale, though the smell writes a bombastic check the only good flavors can't quite cash.  That being said, I could definitely see drinking plenty more of these if given the opportunity."

"The aroma is incredible. Beautiful apricot, soft sweetness, beautiful hops. Lovely. So much fruit; sour fruit. This is also the taste. Sweet, lightly sour apricot. A little dry with a brief aftertaste. Incredible pale ale."

"Not bad for a session, but I expect more from FFF."

"My favorite from the brewery. Mouthwatering session ale that pours light, drinks light, but has excellent flavor, mouthfeel, and a wonderful nose--slightly complex for the style but still straightforward."

"O - they were already the kings of American pale ales and have added a very good session ale to go along with the gushing flavor giants they already have. They continue to evolve into the best there is and if they can get their beer into all their markets on a more regular basis I wouldnt have anything bad to say about them. But as of right now there just isn't enough or even close to enough FFF hitting our shelves like there was 2 years ago."

"This is a strange beer. To me, it didn't taste anything like it smelled. The carmel-like back end and aftertaste on this beer put me in mind of Country Boy's Galaxy Pale Ale, which I didn't like at all. I'm not saying this beer is bad, but I can see similarities regarding the hop and malt profiles. This beer is much more balanced and well-rounded. And while I'm a huge fan of 3F, I'll probabaly pass on this beer in the future unless it's all I can get."

"Decently hoppy brew with a great malt backbone to balance it out. Overall, an easy drinker that goes well with burgers and wings. What more can you ask for?"
""
""
""
"Overall another great FFF product.  Not as overly hoppy as most FFF, but great balance and the suprise fruitiness sets apart."
"Yeasty/grainy nose more so than hops.  Interesting sweeter hop/malt balance on the taste profile.  Not your typical hop forward APA for sure, but a nice offering for a change of pace."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had it on tap at Kuma's in Chicago. Not impressed. Bizarre, malty, bread-like aftertaste takes away from the hop profile. Almost tasted like it came from a bad tap line. Not the best offering from the usually stellar 3 Floyds. I have a feeling you'll be able to find this one in stores easily. Not so much everything else they make."
"worst of their everyday offerings but still a good beer"

"Felt like this was the best grain bill in a FFF's hoppy beer.   Not as hoppy or with the body of ZD but a great pale ale.  Nice levels on this one."
""
"A very good session beer for the hop-lovers."
""
""
"This is some pretty good beer."

"I thought this was one of my favorite offerings from FFF. I think if you are a fan of the unique fruity character in the aroma and tase, you will love it. It was all fruit through and through and I thought there was just enough malt to let it stay present but over not overpower. Reminded me of a fruit stripe stick of gum...but in a good way"
""
""
""
"Just Overall not a fan, thought this one missed its mark..and to hear its taking over for Pride n Joy as a year round I think is silly"
""
"This one had a strange sweetness that I wasn't a fan of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had at Chicago 's Local Option on tap, clear golden pour with a white head,  delicious grapefruit undertones"
"Overall - The overall profile is that of a weakened APA. I will take regular over unleaded."

"Very fruity session. Was damn good with Chinese food tonight."
""
""
""

"A very fruity APA. Lots of tropical notes here within a fairly light bodied pale. Nice golden hue on the profile with a juicy, hop forward feel."
""
""
""
"Beer is lacking, flavor is off"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad.  A little bit light for my high ABV taste buds, but on a hot summer day, this would be alright.  Everything is inline, just not for winter drinking.  Especially drinking right after a On the Wings of Armageddon."
""
"Like zombie dust light.  Even better aroma than zombie dust."
"Very sessionable, great with ramen"
""
""
"If this beer was accessible in California, I could imagine drinking this regularly, especially in the summer months  light on the palate without compromising flavor, no cloying sweetness or heaviness, just a crisp drinkable ale from 3 Floyds"
""
""
""
"Not the best PA I've had, but pretty awesome none the less."
""
""
""
"Excellent example of the style.  Nice citrus/pine aroma which is borne out in the taste.  Though the hops are very forward, this beer has an excellent malty body that balances the beer beautifully.  No excessive bitterness, just a delicious very drinkable beer.  If this was available where I live, it would be in the regular rotation."
"Nice add on to the bottle line Three Floyd's!"

"It's good—great, if I weren't judging it against Three Floyds illustrious lineup—but I am still not sure it justifies removing the very underrated Pride & Joy from the regular rotation.  We'll see: I've got three more sixes in my case, so there's ample volume to further ascertain."

"Taste: Tangy grapefruit and citrus hops, with a spicy, bitter feel. I also get some toffee malts clinging on underneath, but this one’s really all about the hops. “Proprietary” hops here mean a new strain maybe? It’s definitely a unique take on an “American Session Ale” or “American Pale Ale”. Hops fiends rejoice, here is another winner from 3F."
"Overall, another damn good APA from 3F."
""
"O- More than a light beer with hops. It has body."
"O:  A great APA.  Not as good as Alpha King, but still good nonetheless."

"Citrus nose reveals tangerines, honey, caramel malt and a piney bitterness. The flavor is more citrus forward with tangerines, apricots, bitter pineapple, honey and lemon. The malt is a bit more disguised but a caramelized malt sets just under the finish. The lower ABV creates a bit thinner beer that has a true drinkability but not as satisfying an experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Good stuff. I really dig the label but something about it feels a little not PC. Don't get me wrong, I love not-PC, it's just an interesting design and I'd love to hear the story behind it. I'm thinking it involves several beers and maybe some doobies."

"O - good beer and fun to try, but if I'm going to buy a Three Floyds pale ale it's going to be Alpha King."
""
"Golden colored pour, creamy white head with nice retention.  Nicely balanced citrus hoppy notes.  Another strong addition to the Three Floyds lineup. Will definitely be going back for more."
""

"DELICIOUS! This stuff is like juicy fruit in your mouth.  Mildly bitter.  Little malty.  But so easy drinking.  This is now my favorite session.  Can't think of anything I would change.  Just an excellent beer!"
""

"Overall, this was a pleasant, pale offering from Three Floyds.  They obviously specialize in this style of beer, and here you are gifted a nicely tropical, fruity, and airy beverage.  The hop to malt balance was well maintained, although the grain bill seemed to push back a bit more than your typical APA.  YumYum, however, is certainly not their best, by any means, but the juiciness is unmistakable.  One oddity that we did happen to note was this buttery popcorn seed aroma and flavoring.  This added a curious slick, oily dirtiness to both of those aspects of the beer, tending to ruddy it up a bit into what we would coin as a “farmhouse pale ale”, if we could.  It is just that dirty and grassy, giving this very organic and very down-home feel to it."

"this is a truly amazing pale ale. a friend of mine went for a hike near golden and found some hops growing wild. being the prolific homebrewer he is, he brewed a number of beers with the hops, but neither of us could identify them. they has a chili pepper nose, a cantaloupe melon character, and a pineapple even peanutty vibe. its so weird that all his beers got tasted this week, and this thing fell into my lap. i swear the hops are the same. maybe its not a new varietal at all, but a rediscovered old wild vine, thats sure what it feels like. brassy hazy beer, killer carbonation and head, and a nose that does absolutely no justice to how interesting these hops are. its juicy and has note of melon and lemon cream and indeed that faint chili pepper character. i dont know what this hops is, but i need more of it. my only critique of this beer is its label calling it a session ale. i mean, it is, i would drink ten of these if i had them tonight, but i consider a session ale under 5% abv, thats my line, self declared, but i stand by it. its just a pale ale, but its not just a pale ale. as vibrant and unique as any hoppy beer going right now, this is absolutely brilliant. thanks to claystation for giving me this, but im afraid he doesnt realize what he has given up. this is killer, really really good. someone tell me more about the hops!"

"Blueberry, light caramel, strawberry, pine, light wheat, light honey"

"Taste is similarly mild, plenty of pale malt to back up the citrus and floral hop notes. Doesn't really seem characteristic of FFF, but is definitely easy drinking and sessionable. Light bodied and smooth. Kind of sad to lose Pride & Joy for this, to be honest."
""
""
""
""

"O - An easily drinkable, flavor forward APA.  I'll miss Pride & Joy, which was more reserved, but this is a distinctive Three Floyds brew, a huge beer that still things balanced."

"Overall: There's alot I think is very Outstanding about this brew. The Appearance, the Aroma and the way if feels on my palate. Yet the flavor isnt bringing anything new to me. Is it balanced? Yes, very. Its just a bit laggish and lacking the brightness that I get in the Aroma. Don't think I'm bashing this brew. Far from it. I was just expecting maybe too much from this. At the end of the day, this brew is Worthy!"
""

"Nowadays there's a slew of beers in all parts of the world being made with galaxies full of new hop varieties. In the last couple weeks alone I've come across beers featuring hop breeds I can't even pronounce produced in Scotland, Germany and Canada and, truthfully, YumYum doesn't stand out among them as anything especially noteworthy. But if we're talking hoppy beers there's still few better breweries than Three Floyds and arguably no better producer nation than America."

"O) wow well done.  Not ZD but really holds it's own against many APAs and IPAs.  A lovely crushable beer.  I liked it more than I thought.  Was thinking a light bodied hop bomb, instead I got a sweet well balanced Pale ale."

"A dull shade of orange yellow in color. Forms a moderate sized, fluffy, off-tan colored head. Moderate amount of lacing on the way down. Aroma is rather pungent and hop-forward. Aroma is mostly citrus and citrus zest with an underlying fruitiness. The taste follows up on the aroma. There is a mild caramel back bone, neither sweet nor dry. Then there is some tropical fruit along with bright citrus and a touch of pine to round things out. Medium bodied. Mild to medium bitterness. Appropriate carbonation. Another fine APA from FFF that has no chance of staying on the shelves."

"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 09/30/2014.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with about an inch frothy off-white head that stuck around a long time.  There's also a good amount of lacing.  The brew smells mostly like floral and citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) hops, and some bready/grainy malt.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some melon and orange peel noticeable.  The brew has a nice bittersweet finish.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick, smooth and pretty easy to drink.  I thought this was good, certainly worth picking up if you come across some.  $2.19 a single bottle."

"t/m/o - really smooth and easy drinking pale ale with a nice hop presence but no doubt a pale ale.  A little less aggressive than a zombie dust but still has a nice hop. The sweet biscuity malt balances it all out to make one hell of a session pale.  Truth in advertising, this beer is yum yum!"
""
"Overall I would say this is a great session ale. If you want fuller flavor from your pales you might look towards SNPA or Alpha King, but I like this quite a lot. This is a very unique beer, I can't emphasize that enough, and it is worlds better than pride and joy."
""
"Bottled a week ago, so should be fresh. Resin, dank marijuana, and catty hops dominate, with a soft tropical fruit aroma underneath. Notes of mango and pineapple accompany zesty grapefruit and lemon. Tons of hop aroma. Flavor reveals fruity hops at the base, becoming resiny and lightly bitter in the finish. Soft mango and orange zest accompany light grapefruit tartness. I like that the fruity hop character dominates. Most session ales are too bitter and resiny for my palate."
"Get it. Drink it. Savor it. Yep!"
"Balanced until deep within its finish, the ale's bitterness is smooth and softly of spruce and botanical grasses and herbs. A crisp, clean and clear exit from the palate ensures a high rate of refreshment from the medium-light ale, yet a suggestion of buttered and salted graham cracker is peculiarly satisfying."
""
"This is a nice unique take on the style. It's different from alot of FFF's hoppy beers, but still showcases what they can do with hops. Nice brew."

"Another in the line of heavily hopped pale ales, although not nearly as extreme as some California examples. Looks beautiful with plenty of head on the pour and copious lace. Golden amber with a fair amount of haze. Aroma and taste speak to the hops. While the malt backbone is solid enough, the tropical hops are what catch your attention. Perhaps not as in your face as a typical West Coast IPA, Yum Yum is hops first and malt second. Where it is more Pale Ale than IPA, the finish is less bitter and more short lived. Carbonation is on the high side and the body is medium"
"Fruity and piney hops dominate.  Near medium bitterness."
""
"Overall, I'm not sure if I'd buy this one again, but I certainly enjoyed the opportunity to try it."

"Pours straw golden in color with a slight haze and a big fluffy 2 finger white head that retains nicely. Smell has a really fresh hop aroma with notes of herbal hops, fresh melon, and hints of strawberry and blueberry aromas. Taste follows the nose with more herbal hops melon and berry flavors and a pretty big herbal hop bitterness. Very light grain flavor lets the hops shine. Mouthfeel is crisp refreshing then persistently bitter well after the swallow. It took me 4 of these before I really enjoyed it (separate occasions) not sure why but the 5th and 6th were super tasty."

"O:  This says session ale on the bottle, but to me it was better than most of the other ""session IPAs"" I've had.  It definitely drinks like a very hop forward APA.  I'll miss Pride and Joy being easily accessible, but this was a very tasty substitute!"
""
""
""

""
""
"Yum Yum!"

"O- Shoulda gotten another pint of ZD instead of this. This one was a letdown for a 3Floyds hoppy beer. I like this better than All Day but not other stuff like Go To, or Daytime."
"I love the folks at FFF. That said, not every beer they make is a winner, folks. If any other brewery made this beer they'd be lucky if it made it to an 80 overall. And you guys aren't fooling anyone. 5.5% is only session beer if you're an alcoholic."
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A very nice session ale from Three Floyds, not quite as rounded and thorough as others on the market, Boulevard's session ale still rings the truest for me as a session IPA, but this is a great beer for the last remnants of summer. Crisp, refreshing and light but bitter and hoppy to satisfy. I think that the sum is greater than the parts here, but I'll have no issues crushing this 6 pack over the weekend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- An other awesome beer from FFF, has a great sweetness that is well balanced by the hops.  Can't wait to try this again!"
""
""
""
""
"O- One of the top 2-3 session IPAs I've had.  Enjoyable.  At ~5.5%, this is on the higher side of a session ABV"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Something like a passion fruit smell in the nose is my first take, backed up by some citrus, mango and faint lemon.  But, I almost get something like grape in it too. Taste has some bitterness abiding the ride down. Some tartness and pucker from the hopping that is loosely balanced by the malt and backed up with a nice bite of bitterness. A nice break from what we have come to expect, and probably will go down as an excellent summer drinker and Yum Yum does its job well of being a ""sessionable"" beer that very unfortunately does not list its abv on the packaging.  At 5.5% or whatever it actually is, its not exactly a true session ale of the kind you can keep the glass running at half full for the day, but it's pretty tasty and worthy of some dead animal perched in between some bread and for getting a shine on with. And, yes. The label art work is top notch, and hilarious."

"For a refreshing Pale Ale, this beer packs a hoppy citrus punch that is not overly abusive.   The mouthfeel is light and crisp with a hop-thirst quenching bitterness that's hard to beat.   This isn't Zombie Dust, but it is definitely worth a try."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and floral aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and earth flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but simple in my opinion."

"Golden orange-ish, slight haze and a decent head. Smells like a straight up midwest IPA: rounded biscuit malt, alpha hops. Tastes sweet, sharp, and spicy. Strange hop profile. Not quite like anything i've had. Round, thick back end."

"Overall - fantastic session pale ale.  Very similar hops to zombie dust."
""
""
"I was just happy this was still on draft when I got there. Bright golden body with a two finger white foamy head. There's a bit of sweet citrus on the nose but it really isn't too pungeant. The taste is explosive. Sweet and bitter citrus peel and citrus juice. I had to ask if my tastebuds were correct and indeed they confirmed that this is Mosaic hopped. Mouthfeel was nice and slick with a little resin. The malt is there for balance but it really steers clear to me. It's all about showcasing Mosaic hops, and that was certainly done. I still like Annica a little better, but I'm very happy to see a sessionable APA use of this hop. Well done Floyd's, well done."
""
"O: Really nice new Pale Ale by Three Floyds, looking forward to seeing if they decide to start putting this into six packs!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tried this at the brew pub. More akin to zombie dust. I hope they keep this one around and start bottling it because I was blown away. Better than gumball head, pride n joy, and jinx proof. Another amazing beer from an amazing brewery. It has joined the elites such as APW, permanent funeral, ZD, and Alpha King in terms of ales."
