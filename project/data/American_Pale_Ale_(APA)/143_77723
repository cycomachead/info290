A little chewy, fruity like an english pale would be. Simple but enough of a flavor profile to stay interested.","KTCamm","Apr 04, 2015"

The aroma is of malts. Pretty much the same for the taste but was pretty smooth and went down easy, unlike many pale ales. Just a very slight taste of hops for the finish but was gone in a few seconds. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Very tasty and really liked this one.","BeerWithMike","Jan 11, 2015"

3.17,-5.1,3.25,3,3.25,3,3.25,"Picked up one of Spoetzl's mixed six pack, and this was included.  Poured out the bottle into a pint glass, it had a decent off-white head with nice lacing. The color was a dark amber, or light brown.  Slight aroma, mostly of malt.  The taste is pleasant, with a bit of maltiness and very slight hops taste. According to the label they use Munich malts and U.S. Golding & Bravo hops.  I would say that this is a 'Pale Ale Light', fine for the times you don't want a strongly flavored ale. It's definitely not retired - I have seen it in all the mixed six packs from Spoetzl.","rorjets","Jan 03, 2015"

3.51,5.1,3.75,3.25,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured a cloudy amber color with golden highlights when held to light and two fingers of fluffy off-white head. It's pretty good looking, though with maybe a bit too much head formation. Scents of bready malt, light fruity esters reminiscent of apple, light notes of tangerine flesh and a light level of floral and grassy hop aromas. Malty and delicate, with a low level of hop aromas and a moderate level of fruity esters overall. Far more like an English Pale Ale than an American. Flavor begins with notes of bready, biscuity malt with a touch of caramel and medium-light floral hop flavors. This moves into a slightly drier yet still lightly sweet middle with a moderate level of floral hop flavor, a touch of apple-like fruitiness and a bit of sweet malt. Finish lightly dry with moderate flavors of floral and herbal hops, a light touch of apple and a bit of orange peel. Aftertaste is dry with notes of floral and herbal hops and biscuity malt. The flavor profile is balanced and not overly hoppy, with flavors most resembling an English Pale or an older style American. Not groundbreaking, but pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with medium-low carbonation and a smooth feel. Nicely drinkable and true to style. Overall this is a serviceable Pale Ale. It's balanced in flavor and aroma, smooth and easy to drink. It's not the hoppiest or the most experimental American Pale around, nor is it the best simple pale ale, but it's good in its own way.","Auraan","Aug 09, 2014"

Some malts and grains and some hops as well. Taste/mouthfeel: Kind of fruity/citrus-y with a definite presence of hops. I am not normally a fan of IPAs, and this one, to me, was moodle of the road overall. It was tasty, but I won't buy it again.","sheeley","Aug 05, 2014"

My biggest complaint would be that it seems a touch watered down, like it is close to being very flavorful, then they got a bit timid and scaled it back. Had they just allowed the flavors to fully emerge, this would have been a standout. Still, it is pleasant enough, and a good beer for a hot day.","Vixie","Aug 02, 2014"

I was very disappointed. The best thing about this beer was the appearance. It looked exactly how a beer is supposed to look. Nice amber color. Taste at first was kind of rotton but it got to tasting a bit bitter after that. I just did not care for it at all.

Aromas of bread and light caramel maltiness with hints of fruit and earthy hops. The flavor holds more earthy hop flavor than the aroma suggested backed up by a solid bready caramel malt base and lots of sugary fruitiness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Decent pale ale, but kind of middle of the road. Nothing flawed, but a bit boring.","johnnnniee","Jun 28, 2014"

Aroma of malt and hop: gently sweet, bready, slightly caramelish malt and leafy/grassy/floral hops ~ quite English in nature hop-wise, not what I think of as "American"; and "European" in malt, but again, not "American". Overall, balanced a bit too far towards sweet malt. The hops are nice (pleasantly floral against the sweet/bready malt). Easy-going basic pale ale that's got enough to satisfy.","NeroFiddled","Jun 11, 2014"

Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and medicinal yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, yeast, and earthy citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is fairly drinkable but the yeast presence in the aroma and flavor somewhat dominate things in this one.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 08, 2013"

Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, bread, floral, grass, light pine, light pepper, and floral earthiness. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, caramel, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance of malt and hop flavors; with no cloying flavors after the finish. A little lacking in flavor robustness. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty solid pale ale. Quite pleasant in flavor and balance, but lacking in some aspects. An enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 09, 2013"

It claims to be a classic American pale ale with a golden color. I will have to recheck the color, but it seems more medium to dark amber than golden from memory. And classic pale ale? No. It has a yeasty sourness to it that I do not associate with a classic pale ale. Now you call it a saisson and all the foo foo belgian snobs will give it a 4.5, maybe that is just showing my anti saisson snobbishness. Anyway, its not a bad beer, if you can handle the sourness. And, it could be a great bargain as the people truly looking for a 'classic American pale ale' stay away and Shiner cuts the price to sell the stuff. Of course, if the people at Shiner really can't keep the yeasties out of their ale when they want to, you'll just be taking your chances with this.","ribby","May 14, 2013"

It grew on me, but I think that was because it was so bad at first and as it got better I did a bit of "oh thank god I won't have to drainpour this - it's not so bad after all" but that's not a good way to start a beer. It's not your typical APA. Once warm its just above average, but before that....it's a beer to avoid. I do wonder if this beer is a bit old, but no way of knowing. So overall, it's just okay if warm.

3.16,-5.4,4,3,3,4,3,"O - Shiner's Wild Hare is certainly not something I'd have the dog fetch, but it's also not offensive. The oddities in the aroma seem to disappear, but the flavor is, quite candidly, weak in hoppiness, something Shiner can't afford to have going on with the strong competition in the market. Refreshing nonetheless, Wild Hare would make for a good lawnmower beer, just a little beefier than the "standard" lager.","BeerFMAndy","Jun 07, 2012"

The aroma is of roasted malts and hops. There is a citrus smell due to the hops. The aroma is fairly mild, but pleasant. The flavor is sweet from the malts. The hop flavors add some bitterness as well as some citrus. The aftertaste is not strong. There's a metallic taste that is almost typical of Shiner beer. The body is light to medium with adequate carbonation. The drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a very good beer and a solid effort from Shiner. Here's to 103 years.","acevenom","May 15, 2012"
