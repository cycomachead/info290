"Had on draft this time. Always a good choice. Other time I've had in can"
"I had high expectations opening up a can of this stuff. It was recommended to me, because I wanted to try a new  pale ale. It's very boring and leaves a strange taste in your mouth. With that said, I would still drink it over alot of other shit"
"The wife snarled at the can, but ended up loving it. There you have it. Our new camping brew."
"Nice Amber color"
""
"really smooth pale ale, with a nice soft finish"
"Poured from a growler into pint glass. Pours a finger of soapy, eggshell white head, with good retention and walls of firm sticky lacing. Dark orange and brownish amber, quite clear. Smells well balanced with a sweet malt backbone and a nice floral hoppiness. Nice flavor, has some metallic bittering hops in the background, with a flavorful malt balance. Tastes a little like oranges. Metallic feel, and foams up somewhat in mouth. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy body. Overall, I love this pale ale. It was one of the first craft beers I fell in love with years ago, and this is the first I've had it in a long time. Though its not as complex as it probably could be, it will always be one of my favorites."
"An excellent example of an APA. One of the better ones I've had."
"Hop filled love in a can, it's packable, drinkable, and just plain tasty. Best enjoyed with friends and straight from the cans. Oskar blues flagship beer is still in my top list for beers year round. 4.5/5 O.B.D91"
"Amber with a white foamy head. Smells sticky, floral and sweet. Taste is awesome. This is one of my go to favorite beers. Way more bitter than a normal pale ale. This has always hit my like an IPA. Bitter but not too much. Great balance. Great beer. Love it."

"Poured from a tallboy can into a pint glass. Amber color with a white foamy head, lots of soapy lace. Smells of slightly metallic hops. Tastes of bright grapefruit hops balanced with honeyish malt. Mouthfeel incredibly smooth and pleasant. A reliable accessible pale ale."

"I was honestly going into this beer already disapointed because 2 of my 3 previously tried out of a make your own 6-pack were very disapointing (1 was another well known pale ale from another craft beer giant, the other was a canned beer). Boy was I surprised, this is a good beer. Pours an orange-gold body with a mountain of frothy foam. The smell was floral and piny with some citrus. The taste reflects this with the addition of some sweet malts. Overall a delicious beer that I definitely see myself drinking in the future, but with that said there are a few critiques. Firstly I felt there was too much bitterness with not enough hop flavor if that makes sense, like there was a lot of just generic bitterness with not too much distinct hop flavors. Secondly, the packaging needs to be updated. Although I got only one in a make your own I saw that these were being sold in the old plastic rings of fish doom. In my opinion that need to change to the new 6 pack carriers most craft brewers use for their canned beers, they look better and are better for the environment"

"Delightful."
"Dales pale ale is pretty plain and doesn't stand out much."
"you say pale ale, I say IPA.  this is a solid beer.  Put some in your back pack and chug it at the top of a mountain."

"Holy smokes this beer is underrated. The perfect beer with fried food, pizza, nachos, or wings. This is my go-to Fight Night and Football beer."
"Nice hoppy pale. Well balanced with malt.  Little thin on the mouth feel.Light bitterness that lingers.  Easy drinking.  Quality pale ale."
""
""
""
"Has a smooth taste that gets some hops towards the end, but it is blended wonderfully so it isn't at all, harsh.  Drank it straight from the can."
"Overall: Solid stuff. Good everyday-type beer and a nice point of entry into craft beers for a lot of folks."
""
""
"Too malty for my taste - murky."
"Nice balanced profile. Like a really well-done homebrew. Can says ""voluminously hopped", and it's hoppy but maybe not by VT standards."
""
""
""
""
"Copper pour, thin white top. Mild hop and malt aroma. Same in the flavor. Pretty clean finish. Nothing to dislike here, but a little boring."
""
"Overall-  A pale ale that really is an ipa, but its really good and that's all that is important.  Lots of pine and citrus, solid malt flavors to provide balance, and really easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good solid pale ale. A daily driver."
""

"Subtly sweet with a soft finish."

"O: a nice beer, but too much caramel and not enough hop character for the style;"
"Good pale ale. Nice change up from the usual"
""
"Much better than Budweiser"
""
"On tap at Time Out. Amber-orange with no head thanks to the inept bartender. Carmel, citrus, floral aromas. Hop, pine, roasted malt, orange oil flavors."
""
"Hazy orange color. Malt sweetness and some fruity hops.  Good malt base here, a hint of floral hops, but predominantly fruity hops with just a touch of bitterness. Very good, bubbly feel.   Really, really good pale ale!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would drink again, but not sure if I would seek it out and purchase again. Unless it was a good buy at the time or I was really in the mood for it."

"Brew pours a pretty copper-amber in color with a good 1+ finger foamy head that finally settles down to 2mm after after 20 minutes. Lots of ring-like lacing is seen that sticks to the inside of the glass. The aroma is full of flavor with earthy grains and pine. Bit more going on with the taste as there is some floral hops in the mix as well. A slightly dry and light bitter finish but doesn't last all that long. Probably one of the better APA style brews though, although I am not a really a big fan of this style of brew. I will say that as it warmed up a bit, it was a little better. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall, it wasn't all that bad, for me anyway."
""
""
"A bit cheap but not bad. Not a lot of bitterness that most IPAs have"
""
""
""
""
"Nice.  Very nice.  Will I drink it if offered to me in a social setting?  Yes.  Will my heart go ""aflutter"" when I discover this is all my host has to offer?  No.  Still, nice.  Very nice."
""
""
""
""
"had an oily flavor I did not care for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Huge, frothy head. Leaves a great lace. Nice copper liquid. With just a touch of pungency, the rest of the smell is earthy pine with a tab bit of ripe fruit. The hop character is quite big for pale ale, and could easily be mistaken as an IPA. Piney goodness with a pleasant bitterness. I will certainly get it again."
""
""
"O: A solid pale ale with great balance that goes down very well, especially for pushing the abv limits of an IPA. Certainly a standard for the style"
""
""
""
""
""
"Hoppy and malty at the same time.  Good head, warm amber color.  What's not to like?"
""
"O (3.75) - I was excited for this one, but it fell short.  Kinda like a lot of Oskar's beers.  I mean, it's better than average, and I would drink it again.  But it is not a ""must have"" for my cellar."
""
""
""
"Only beer I want to like and just cannot...might be one of the variety of hops?"

"Very delicious Pale Ale that taste a lot like an IPA. Has a citrus taste to it and great finish. One of my favorites!"

"At first this great example of North Carolina beer took the air out of my lungs and made my boy hoods sting. But after the second drink I realized just how good this beer is. As this almost green liquid rolls down your throat it feels like a hard day working in the mountains of North Carolina. It is rough just like the Old North state but like this Beautiful you really have to sit down and take your time to enjoy it. I was 12 when I first drink this, a little clean shaven boy not ready for what I had acquired. But once I finished this beautiful blue can I had a lush over flowing beard and was wearing a flannel and holding an axe. This beer will make a man out of you"
""
""
""
"Excellent beer in a very convenient can."
""
"more of an IPA to me. Fantastic taste, smell, and color. One of my favorite beers ."
"Disclaimer poured from a January 2014 batch drank 1 yr later. Darker and cloudier than expected. Has an adjunct + pale ale smell, not great. Thick and honey flavored. Sticks to the back of your throat and goes bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Best pale ale I have had.  The can preserves all of the flavors perfectly.  I think this is more of an IPA than a pale ale but who cares?  Excellent use of flavoring hops which is what's missing in this style."
""
"Canned on 12/17/14.  Poured into a mug at about 45 degrees.  Pours clear dark golden-copper with 2 fingers of nearly white head which dissipates quickly to a thin film with flecks of lacing around the glass.  Smell is dank west coast hops with a mild floral tone and fresh baked biscuits.  Smell is similar to Sierra Nevada's Torpedo Extra IPA, but with somewhat less complexity.  Carbonation is medium, and this adds to the body nicely.  Mouth feel is medium, and seems a bit thicker than most other pale ales I've tried.  Taste is robust alpha acid-rich hops and mild sweetness.  It is extremely well balanced as far as hop-bitterness to malt sweetness goes.  Overall, it's a bit on the bitter side as far as the style goes, but that is precisely why this is one of my favorite pale ales.  If you like the American pale ale style, this will probably be a top-notch in your books."
""
""
""
"Overall, it's fine."
""
"Taste: Very balanced, no surprises, but can't think of a flaw. Happily drink as a go to beer."
""
""
""
"Damn good bud... Damn good."
"I am not a huge pale ale fan but this is a great beer.  A little cloudy, good taste."

"This beer defines the APA vs IPA argument to me. How is this not an IPA?"
""
""
"Very solid APA.  Perfectly balanced.  Nothing stands out as amazing, just a super solid beer."
""
""
""
"While my score may not be above 4, this is an above ave APA. I am a big Oskar Blues fan...all their beers are solid for each style. This pale ale is awesome on a hot summer day by the pool. Very sessionable with good flavor. If you search, you will find the malts, hops but not too much even on the mild side, and various flavors of citrus, pine and sweet caramel, with a small bite of bitterness...but more easiness going down than bitter."
""
""
"For a regular beer, not in the sense ""run of the mill", this is very above average for an IPA.  Happy to see this regularly in my frig!"
""
""
"Good Pale ale, would drink it again"
""
"Heard it was a good beer but wasn't impressed when I tried it."
""
""
"OVERALL:  this is a good beer and reasonably priced at $3.99, it's almost an IPA with the hop profile, I prefer SN Pale Ale but this was enjoyable.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys pale ale or IPA."
""
"Pours a clear deep amber producing a billowy 3+ finger, offwhite, lasting head that leaves webs, streaks & rings of clumpy lacing. Aroma is heady sweet caramel malt with floral, pine & citrus hops. Taste is a toasty caramel malt balanced  with pine resin & citrus rind & pith hop bitterness, only slight deviation from start to finish but bitterness becomes high octane immediately after the finish & dominates the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, clean, silky & smooth. Drying in the aftertaste. A simple straightforward IPA that is called a pale ale."
""
""
"A rich pale ale perfect for hot summer days. One of those beers that really makes sense in a can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've been a fan of Oskar Blues but this one did not do it for me. Not a bad beer, but nothing special."
""
"Great beer! I can drink this stuff all day, or until I pass out......"
"One of my GOTOs! Great pale ale, with enough ibu's to be considered an IPA. Easy drinking but full of flavor, slightly piney with citrus. Very solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep amber colored with excellent clarity.  A fingernail of off white head leaves Brussels lacing. Delicate aroma of piney hops takes a backseat in comparison to the toasted nutty accented malt.  The flavor is a nice blend of the light to nutty malt flavor and the gentle piney hop note.  The body is light,very smooth,and very dry."

"A Colorado classic.  Dale's Pale is still great."

"This was served in a 19 ounce can, believe it or not. I poured it into a pint glass and it made a decent head. It is reasonably hopped, but not as hop heavy as many IPAs (or APAs for that matter). I would buy it again, especially if I can find that extra large can."
""
""
"All american pale ale. Not much else to say other then if you don't like it at first, give it a second chance. If you still don't like it after that .. Clearly your taste buds can't handle the bitter bomb."
""
"This beer is my woman and I's session beer. First time I had it I wasn't a fan but as I got more and more, I kept coming back. This ain't your average pale ale. It's bong bong. I'll drink this anytime, anywhere. If you haven't got this yet and you like hops you are missing out on life. Oskar blues never let's down with their 3d beers in a can. Buy it, shotgun one, enjoy."
""
""
"Overall:  I enjoyed this a lot.  Tasting blind, there's no way I would know it was a pale instead of an IPA...love those Centennial hops.  Some things in common with hoppy ambers, even, including a little rough edge.   Glad these guys started distributing to MN last summer!  Very nice addition."
""
""
"An incredebly tasty and hoppy American Pale Ale. I really like the drinkability of it."
""
""
""
"Pours with a two fingers of mottle, white head.  Roasted malt and citrus notes.   Starts sweet and finishes bitter.  Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very ""fruity"" yet very hoppy."
"Not weak, this certainly wasn't strong by any stretch either. The alcohol gave this a bit of warming but didn't detract from the range of flavors that this packed. This was a classic, textbook example of what an American Pale Ale should be while not falling prey to the ""arms race"" that so many West Coast counterparts of this fall victim to. It's a good thing that this beer is available year-round, as it can be enjoyed and would fit well in any season. Complex, balanced, and true to style, this is an APA that deserves a higher rating than what it has on here."
""
""
"Pours a light orange with a white fizzy head. The smell was really nice with some sweet notes in the beginning and then a lot of pine from the hops coming through in the end. The taste was similar to the scent with sweet malt in the beginning and a crisp finish. A very well balanced beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Another go to favorite, I love cans what can I say!  Its gotten more consistant & holds up better from NC opposed to CO product in my opinion.  Great beer malty w/o being too sticky, perfect hop bitterness to balance."

"I like sucking down a few Dale's ...Great Beer with a NICE alcohol content for a Breskie....Lil' to ""Hoppy"" (unless they produce a Hoppier one?) for me personally...2-3 of them is enough...I don't think I have ever swilled more than four of them at a sitting...Always an occasional 'Go Too' though...Fer' sure"
"Cheers"
"Apparently I liked it enough to snap a picture of it on my phone.  Too bad I tried it after a long night out on the town."

"Pint enjoyed on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. Orange-yellow amber with a finger of light beige foam. Incredibly fruity nose, all kinds of things going on including orange, mango, peach, strawberry, kiwi, guava ... All blending together to yield a gummy bear effect. Wonderful hop aroma than can keep up with many full-fledged IPAs. Palate was more classically pale ale, however (assuming one can truly split hairs like this), a smooth caramel backbone with the hops still bold but not aggressive, everything well-integrated to yield a pleasant but mellow grapefruit, floral and tropical fruit melody. Mouthfeel slightly oily and smooth, moderate body and carbonation. Finishes quite dry, almost woody. Bitterness is notable. Great concoction, this, even if the nose does trump the palate by a wide margin."

"I was very excited to give the spirit go, should've realized that my excitement stemmed from the recommendations of my west coast hophead friends! This is a good beer, but not my cup of tea. If I had to choose between this and a Sierra Nevada pale ale, Sierra Nevada! In fact, lately, I am a fan of Chesapeake pale ale from Alewerks!"

"Fun red/white/blue can.  Nice slightly hazy dark yellow pour.  Nice thick creamy off-white head.  Strong pine/floral aroma greets the nose.  Good heavy malt start with the substantial hops coming through about half-way into the sip.  Strong citrus dominates the palate until the swallow.  Then a crisp, slightly bitter finish.  Very quaffable.  A strong go to APA with more hops than average."

"Pours a nice copper color with a one and a half finger head. The nose is mostly orange citrus with tropical notes. There's a good presence of caramel malt too. The flavor is nice. Very big malt presence,  but it's balanced with strong hops. There is something peppery and a strong taffy flavor. Balance is the name of the game. Nice,  thick mouthfeel.  I could drink this all day."

"Dale's is the biggest seller for Oskar Blues, and as a hoppy APA that most people think of when they think of a craft beer, I see why.  It's just a little too hoppy for my taste, but I certainly enjoy one now and then.  I'm just not quite as enthused about this one as most people I know though."

"Really smooth for the ABV and for being a pale ale. Nice head when poured can to glass. Taste resides in the front of the mouth, moving to middle and upper palate on swallow. Aftertaste minimal, little lingering. Head seems to diminish quickly. Clean taste. Sessionable. Would buy again. Pairs well with a tobacco vape blend like Axiom's Honeysuckle Tobacco."

"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. I've seen this all over in cans but never ventured try it. This is not quite a revelation, but it does make me pinch myself for my trepidation. Nice copper color, staunch head w/a lacing that indicates a respect in the process. Not much aroma but a very full & balanced flavor. This is pretty much my level of hop tolerence, but I don`t mind it one bit.Now to find a singular can to complete the 'research'."

"COD 4/21/14. Pours a clear almost medium amber with a nice dark ruby tint. Tremendous head with excellent lacing and retention. Very nice nose of tropical citrus hops over a pine and light caramel background. Medium body with an almost slick texture. Above average carbonation with a nice effervescent finish. The flavor profile is complex and well balanced. It begins with a blend of hop flavors found in the nose, then rapidly flows to a pine focused hop bitterness over a slightly tart note. As the bitterness fades, a light caramel sweetness emerges in the effervescent finish. A tart pine bitterness with hints of spice lingers."

"Says Pale Ale but ""voluminously hopped mutha of a pale ale"" on the top of the can is more accurate. Check this out if you like tossing up the differences between Sierra Nevada and Siera Nevada Torpedo!!!!"
"o - Not what I expected, in fact much better than I expected. Hoppy and complexity mix to create a wonderful flavor profile and the texture compliments the taste very well."

"Picked up a six pack of these while grabbing some of my my go to Old Chub. Also a big fan of Ten Fidy and not sure why I have never had this one but had to give it a go. Outstanding looking beer with an excellent nose, clean and I fresh. Disappointed with the taste. It is good, but not as good as I was expecting. Overall a decent beer but not quite the level of other Oskar Blues offerings."

"Taste more on the IPA range but excellent nonetheless. I really like the smooth taste and feel of this beer and will buy again. At 6.5 ABV and over 200 cals. will not be drinking and pounding but great for a shorter nite of drinking."

"O: Not a terribly exciting malt profile, more hop forward. Nice hop flavor but not overly complex. A good malt backbone and a very nice simple hop profile. It seems like a one trick pony... but it's a REALLY good trick. Definitely a great beer to cool down with."
""
""

"An excellent, well balanced APA. Has floral notes balanced with apple, cinnamon, malt, and some lemony overtones. Lacing very nice, with good head retention. Good hop to malt balance. Easy drinking session ale. Taught me that canned beer need not taste bad. My example was brewed in Brevard, NC. Fresh. One of the best session APA beers. On the expensive side for what it is. I'd drink this ale again. Offends in no area."

"I scored a 19.5 oz can at Pinocchio's in Media, dated 6/23/2014 so it's pretty fresh. That having been said, I've noticed a few differences between the 19.5 and 12 oz cans. First of all, it has a darker complexion. Not much darker, but enough to be noticable. Second, it smells richer, like there's a little more to it then the 12 oz version. Third, my wife and I split a can so we each got about 10 oz and it had considerably more kick to it than a 12 oz can. Finally, there was way more malt and not nearly as bitter as the 12 oz version. I could see a couple of my ""I don't like IPA"" friends drinking this and enjoying it. Very good all around and if I could get it here regularly for less than $5 a can, this would be my go-to beer instead of the 12 oz cans or Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."

"Overall: A really fine year-round American IPA – not a pale ale or session beer for my taste. One can is more than enough for me."

"Kind of reminds me of Sam Adams pale ale, but this is a bit heavier and not in a good way. Its like they were trying too hard not to be too light. The 6.5% is a nice perk, would drink again, not a bad flavor occasionally"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- A forgetful pale ale, needs more malt to balance the hops. Not really tasty.The date shown said it was pretty fresh, so not sure why it was so average. Many other beers out there, so may as well skip this one."

"Pours dark amber/honey colored with 2 finger width foamy head. Head retention is good with fair amount of lacing on side of the glass. Has a citrusy, resin aroma - malty. Excellent malty backbone to this beer. Starts with a moderate resin like hoppy taste followed by an very smooth malty citrus taste. Good amount of bitter aftertaste follows. This is an excellent beer. The hops and malts are well balanced."

"O: If you want a more East Coast style IPA - this is a good starter. The ABV is not too high and the bitterness is in check. I was hoping for a bit more pine or floral notes in the taste (they are in the nose). It is a nice tasting beer and you could easily enjoy several on a hot day."
""
""
"I know a lot of BAs say this is an IPA but I don't think so. Its perfectly balanced between sweet caramel malt and floral hops. Its light, and highly drinkable. Its been my brew on many fishing and camping trips. Solid all around."

"This Apa pours a copper amber hue with a frothy white head that leaves average lacing. The nose is hoppy with notes of pine, herbs, and citrus. There is also a sweet caramely malt backbone. The mouth is the perfect balance of sticky and light and easy drinking. The flavor is a well balanced blend of bitter hops and sweet malt. All in all a very easy to drink well made Apa."
""

"Poured from a can into a tulip. Pours a deep red amber with two fingers of creamy foam leaving a fair amount of retention. I picked up a bit of caramel in the aroma along with some piney hop goodness. Tastes fairly boozy in a delightful way. Lots of nice hoppy piney notes that leave me wondering where the boundaries of IPAs and APAs are drawn. Very rich mouthfeel with a moderate amount of carbonation that balances everything just right. I love this beer!"

"O= This works for me. I would drink this over other similar pale ales that i think are attemping the same thing, sierra nevada is the comparison right now, having grown up in northern california. Ill tell you that this blows it away. Not that clean and citrusy pale you might want, a little unrefined even, but sometimes that malt backing is a good thing. A nice beer."

"Overall: If this was labeled an IPA I wouldn't have thought twice about it... Which is why this is one of my favorites APA's and I think is one of the better readily available beers in the style. Also light on the wallet (being found on sale regularly for around $26-$28 a case in my area) which makes for a great go-to. It's full bodied and the flavor is balanced. Can't go wrong with a Dales!"

"On tap with a table full of BBQ. Poured from a can with a nice head, and a golden brown sugar color. Fruity hops on the nose, but the fruit is more subdued with the initial taste. We'll balanced with malt notes and a subdued bitterness. An enjoyable brew."

"Final Grade: 4.17, an excellent A-. Dale's Pale Ale is a testament to the superiority of the can - this particular one is over 8 months old and still drinking supremely well. It's a heftier APA at 6.5%, but it's still a very solid hoppy session-ish ale, and a brew that I plan to try fresh at some point in the future. No one satisfies the hopheads better than our neighbours to the south, and this is one of the benchmarks in its style for good reason."

"O-Dale's Pale Ale should be the go to beer for any occasion. It should replace all BMC brews as America's Flagship Beer. I can see and understand if Dale's is someone's favorite beer. And it gives impetus for all breweries to offer canned versions of their flagship brews because freshness is unmatched in a can."
""
"Great APA, Pours a 2/3 finger head, Has a very citrisy and Hoppy smell. I thought this was going to be an average at best beer but boy was i wrong! I grabbed a 6 pack at my local beer distributor, Guy behind the counter knows me pretty well and asked me if i was sure i wanted to buy this. After getting home and cracking open a can after dinner i poured it into a glass and was surprised at how well it poured. Lots of lacing and a great orange/amber color. Once i took a sip i couldn't believe what i had just drank. This beer came out of a can!? Before i knew it the glass was empty and i had a smile on my face."

"I got to experience this great tasting, pleasent, and enjoyable beer at the Friendly Spot Ice House in San Antonio, Texas. It pours hazey yellow, with thin white laces running to the finger width head. It has a real strong hop tatste for being a pale ale, not to over bearing though, goes down smooth, leaves your palte dry (wanting more). I think it is a halloween party in the can, becuase taste like a IPA in a pale ale's costume...."

"Poured from the can, it has a golden orange color body with small creamy white head. The aroma is of hops. The taste is straight hop forward, then towards the back it has a little sweetness. The mouthfeel is smooth and leaves a little hop aftertaste. overall it is a good pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Man, they nailed it. This is really something special. The pour is a hazy golden, almost like a hefeweissen. Beautiful white head. Aroma is fresh hops. The taste is, just wonderful. It starts sweet, and just when you think this beer will be too sweet, the hops kick, but, not overpowering. The after taste is heaven. A perfect balance of malty sweetness and hop dryness. This tastes like a really, really good homebrew. That is the best thing I can say about any beer."

"Dark yellow/light orange. The head lingers in the pitcher and laces, but fails to do so in the glass. I couldn't pick up too much aroma because I had this at a bar that allows smoking. I picked up some sweetness along with pine and citrus. It tastes slightly sweet upfront followed by a piney and fruity bitterness that lingers. It's really bitter for a pale ale, almost borderline IPA. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall a solid pale ale. It's not outstanding, but it is good."

"This was my beer for the Super Bowl this year. After four it made my mother-in-law much more tolerable. It's a solid pale ale. Most American pales seem to over-hop in an attempt to leach off the popularity of their cooler brother, IPA. Dale's Pale Ale seems to stay true to the style, and for that I'm thankful."
""
"Final Thoughts: Living in MN means that Summit EPA is the standard that all other pale ales are judged against. Dale's Pale Ale is the first of the style I've tasted that is comparable to Summit EPA. The great balance of flavors in Dale's Pale Ale makes it one to remember. Would I drink it again? Yes."

"O- I have eyed this beer for a while now but always passed on it because of the can. Found a single so I bit. I'm kind of underwhelmed unfortunately. It has a taste that doesn't agree with me.

""
""
""

"O- A great APA with a good dose of bitterness. One of my favorite, go-to pale ales, and the blind score reflects and solidifies that for me. Out of a total of 14 pale ales in the blind tasting, this brew tied for 1st with 4 others on my list, and ended up at 2nd on the collaborative list."

"O: This is a staple go-to when cans are the required de-rigour. With all the other cans available now, this is the one I know I will find , along side Yeungling cans if this is out, when all there is available is substandard canned swill otherwise."
""
""
"This is an easy-drinking beer, but with no outlandish tricks like crazy amounts of hops or alcohol."
"Good stuff - even if it is rather potent by pale ale standards. SNPA this is not. Looks OK, though a more persistent head would be nice. The aroma and flavour beat your senses into submission with a huge pine overdose, while the malt takes a backseat. Decent body, but enhanced carbonation would improve the texture. A beer that won't be ignored; definitely one for the hop-heads. Worth sampling if you chance across it."
"I got hooked on Dale's Pale Ale by a neighbor who let me try some at a party. I've always been a hop head and Dale's fits the bill perfectly. The bitterness / hoppiness isn't overwhelming but yet there's still a good bite and lightness to it. I also love the fact that it comes in cans. It brings back fond memories as a kid when I would sneak sips of my parents' canned beer."

"Quite nice. This is a style that it's easy to get mediocre with, there's a lot of ""okay"" American Pale Ales out there. While I wouldn't call this a timeless classic or anything, this is certainly better than ""okay""."

"I get this in the can often (From the Brevard NC brewery, not Colorado, different water) so this review surmises the beer across multiple tastings. As with many APAs it is best when fresher. Recently I have been getting it as fresh as one week and as old as 1.5 months. This is a great daily session drinker. 8.99 sixer here. Pours excellent head, 1-1.5inchs. Nose is mango when fresh more hops and malt when old; taste is similar. full on fresh grapefruit and bitter hops when a nice sweet fresh hop middle and then some dryness at the end. Compared to Zombie Dust, Pliny the Elder and Heady Topper it is not on that level; but that is a hard level to achieve and I rate this beer consistantly just below them. I highly recommend especially when fresh. Check the date on the bottom of the can."

This brew has a very balanced flavor profile but it has a generous amount of hop bitterness and some nice piney notes as it warms. Mouthfeel is spot on, this beer is refreshing but its just thick enough to keep you drinking it. Overall this was a very tasty pale ale that was hard to put down. I finished it pretty quick and I think I will crack another."

"Overall: This is a really good beer. The ingredients were combined to make a unique and damn addictive flavor. I will be having this beer many more times to come."
"There are lots of hops in this one that pushes it on the verge of IPA territory. Dale’s Pale Ale maintains a nice hop presence while staying fresh and highly satisfying. Definitely a pale ale for a hop head, and maybe too much hops for someone looking for a milder pale ale. I really enjoyed this one and canned beer or no canned beer; this is a fantastic pale ale!"

"An outstanding beer & probably the best American pale ale I've tried to date. Great balance between the sweet caramel malts and the hop filled pine and tropical fruit notes that are backed up with a solid, bitter finish. One that did not disappoint in the slightest."

"Poured into a mug cause it's all I had. Frothy head with a copper color. Aroma is almost stale adjunct...maybe a result of the mug. Flavor is without much bitter and slightly watered down. Malt flavor and a tinge of hops. Didn't finish clean. Medium carbonation. Session beer mouthfeel. I'll have to re-rate when I have something other than a penguin Christmas mug."
""
""
""
""
"O - One of my new favorite PA, and a likely go-to for a regular fridge stock."
""
""
"O - A very hoppy APA, almost so much that it's probably closer to an IPA, but man is this well put together. Basically a good IPA with the acidity dialed down and the malts dialed up. All the components compliment each other nicely. I could easily finish a six'er of this and not get tired of it."

"Bought a sixer a week ago and I keep re-rating this in an upward direction. A great balance of hops and malt. In fact, for a APA, this one seems to me to be a bit on the malty side, which is something I didn't expect but is growing on me. In a blind taste test, I'd probably label this an IPA. Compares well to Bell's Two-Hearted and Founders Centennial, two of my all-time favorites."
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, pine, sweet malt, hint of alcohol, and a hint of caramel malt. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable bitterness. Tastes of sweet malt, hops, hint of pine, hint of caramel malt, and slight alcohol. Overall, decent aroma and body, a good APA."

"O – 4.5 – Great beer, definitely one for anyone getting into craft beers to try. It's a great example of what a pale ale should be."
""
"Pours pure apricot with a thin off white head. Some nice orange and light lemon on the nose. Some slight bready malts coming in behind the citrus. Very citrusy for a pale ale, smells more like a IPA. Taste is on the lighter side, the citrus is faint but there. The bready malts seem stronger then I was expecting. The mouthfeel is soft and light, very very drinkable. For me, this sits just above the middle of the pack of craft pale ales. I would still take SNPA over this but not by a lot."

"it's just fine if you're looking for a good American IPA. bonus points to Oskar Blues for cooking up one of these that's crystal clear ... i mean, it's glass, man, and that's cool. but in the current craft brew scene here in America, I not only can't say anything about this brew that makes it stand out from the other coney brews, it's simply way too alcoholic for what it's supposed to be. if this is an ""American pale ale," then start calling me ""Mr. President"""

"If I were to learn that this was the first beer to achieve that flavor, I would give it a better rating for originality....like I say, I like it. But until I learn that fact, I will give it a 3.75...not a bad rating at all-but I expect more for$ 9.00 a 6 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"For me, it could have been better. It is not a bad beer. The aftertaste was very one note for me. On the BBA scale I would rate it about a 6 but I think there are better beers in this style. I don't know whether this beer is trying to be an IPA or a pale ale. Bear Republic racer 5 is a much better example of the IPA style I think than Dales. If I had to have it again I would but it is not my favorite beer."

"Certainly sessionable for the Charlotte area college crowd it may have originally been intended for. (The top of the can tells us this is ""A Huge Voluminously Hopped Mutha of a Mountain Pale Ale."" Along the side is ""Cans Infinitely recyclable."" And across the middle of the back: ""Pack it in, pack it out."" I rest my case.) And after putting back fifteen ounces and posting the above review, this is tasting REALLY good."

"The Rest: Medium bodies, a nice hop assault on the tongue. Balance is a bit off; could use some more sweetness from the malt to balance the hops, but a solid beer all around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Kind of like The Deer Hunter, Raul took his sweet ass time to try this one. And like said ""classic film," it has its moments, is pretty solid down the line, but Raul ain't tripping. Don't get Raulsky wrong, he'd drink Dale's plenty of times over before he'd spend 3 1/2 hours with Al Pachino and the bunch again; but if said playa (Raul) had other, more fruitful options, he'd probably go with them first."
""
""
""
"Pours amber with a thick, off-white head. Good lacing. Aroma of roasted malts and citrus hops. Taste of citrus and pine with nice malt backbone. Almost an IPA. Mouthfeel is on the thin side with effervescent carbonation. Overall, an outstanding sessionable pale."
""
"Poured from a tall boy can (19.2 fl oz) into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice semi-translucent orange with a nice white fluffy head. Smells of citrus and nice grain body, but the citrus hops dominate. Tastes of citrus hops and some earthy tones, slight alcohol taste, but with a great aftertaste and bite. Beer is a bit heavy carbonated but goes down well for light body. Overall a very good beer."

"Cool can. I would rather support a smaller brewery any day of the week. I would drink this again, but I'd know what I was getting into next time. Maybe if my perspective was different I'd have a different experience. Plus I suck at golf."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tons of flavor, but easygoing and enjoyable. Easily found almost anywhere, but nothing to be ignored. Quite hoppy for an APA, but leaps and bounds above many of the mediocre IPAs out there. A great beer and a great value."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a highly satisfying and refreshing hoppy pale ale. A great beer for a hot, sunny day. It lacks the range of hop character that you might get out of an IPA or other pale ales, but it does well with what it has."
""
""
""
""
"Drinking out of the ""stovepipe"" this is one of my go-to beers that I enjoy with regularity. It's a bit like a homecoming for me, and I enjoy the hoppy inflexion that comes with each swig. This is THE prototypical Colorado Ale...you will not be disappointed unless you hate hops."

"Another brew I've been keen to try and it pours a golden copper hue with a billowing four finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is citrus,pine and candy and to be honest it's quite subdued to what I was expecting,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and has tastes of caramel candy,piney bitter hops,Valencia oranges and finished with a light citrus bitterness and overall it's very sessionable for a pale ale of 6.5% and I'd drink it again cheers."
""
""
""
""

"Had in a can recently, they just came to Michigan in March. Dales Pale Ale poured burnished copper gold in color and stood atop a nice standing and lasting foam. a wonderful sharp citrus nose. Assertive malt flavor followed by a perfect balance of hops and a fully attenuated dry finish. Cheers."
""
""
"overall, not very bad for a 'can' beer at all! it's hard to release the stigma associated with the can, but this is good beer when poured into a glass!"

""
""
"I love this drink. It tasts more like an IPA but I've come to appreciate that some APA's have that extra hoppiness that can lead to that insistinction (is that really a word???). It's extremely well balanced, fresh and I can't believe that it comes in a can ( I've had both tap and can)! It's sweet, bitter, flavourful and the same in a can or draught. DPA is a safe choice for any beer advocate and should not be missed."

"This was a tremendous hopped up pale ale that is not the usual fare. It was fruity and bold but had a smooth and graceful malt. Easy to drink and really made you wonder if this was an IPA. Had a winning flavor profile that did not try to clutter the palate and had a nice mineral quality as well. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing objectionable, but this isn't doing much to excite me. Hop aroma is lower than I'd like, and the alcohol presence should be lower for an APA (although the listed ABV is actually out of the style guidelines slightly). Overall, it's acceptable - but if I'm in the mood for an APA I can't see grabbing cans of this over Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Hmm. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is my definitive pale ale and I think it will retain the crown. I like Dale’s hoppiness but think it is too aggressive; I think Dale’s is more of an IPA. Semantics aside, it is still a very tasty and drinkable brew."
""

"While not my top rated pale ale, it's one of the classic solid year-round offerings in the style that could easily be stocked up on. The hop profile is actually more aggressive than expected, and the malty sweetness is pretty robust for what it is. It lacks consistency in the body and aroma, but it is undeniably tasty for what it is. Other than this, I've only had Ten Fidy, but I really hope I can find more spare cans from the brewery because I'm definitely interested thus far in moving on from their flagship and trying other brews of theirs."

"Overall this is a great summer beer. It's refreshing and it goes down smooth. I wouldn't really consider this a Pale Ale by no means. It's darker in nature and it tastes and behaves like an IPA style beer. It's a great summer beer; I am definitely going to buy this one again."
""
"I've been drinking this beer regularly for close to three years now. It never fails to satisfy. Served cold, it's light enough to be relaxing on its own. Let it warm up a bit and the hops really come out, making it a nice accompaniment to plenty of meals: spicy Asian, barbeque, or texmex."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is pleasantly hopped, with citrus and pine notes dominating (yet without any element of bitterness). If this brew is anything, it's well-balanced. Delicious, sessionable, and a classic beer I'll seek out again."
"O: I am new to this style and I know people love this beer, but I am not a big fan. You get the hops, but they are tainted and transformed into this weird taste by the ""pale"" part of it. I don't know how to describe it, but it just tastes like a bad IPA, whose hops have changed their flavor. I know it isn't an IPA, but that is what it reminds me of."

"Poured from a 355ml can. Pours a bright, clear orangish gold. For an American Pale Ale, the nose is surprisingly muted. Not a lot going on, though it may have been a little on the cold side at the time of the tasting. Tempting flavours of orange, tropical fruits and malt dominate the palate. This is a nicely complex, but very drinkable beer, in spite of the highish alcohol."

"Overall (4.0): This is kind of a benchmark APA in a lot of ways, except that it’s more like IPA strength. But in terms of feel, appearance, smell, and taste, it’s good to very solid in every respect. This has been and will continue to be a classic craft APA for years."

"O- This was the first offering from Oskar Blues I have tried and I think it's a nice pale ale. This style kind of seems a bit old for me as my first craft brew I really appreciated was Summit EPA and this is very comparable to EPA and it kind of brings me back to MN drinking Summit. Whenever I crave Summit I will go straight to Dale. Cheers."

""
"The beer is wonderfully balanced. Not really something I would absolutely consider a pale ale like Sierra Nevada Pale or Southern Tier Live because it lacks that refreshing light drinkability. However, instead, it reminds me of an IPA with big malt backbone, pushing towards Firestone Union Jack. Quite a lovely beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: I would call this an IPA before a pale ale, but that's just me. Great beer from Oskar Blues, never dissapointed, I would reccomend this to basically any craft beer drinker as hop heads will enjoy the complex hop character, an earthy bitterness combined with subtle grapefruit notes. I prefer it out of the can, as I do with most Oskar Blues beers."

"O: You know you have something pretty good on your hands when 19.2 oz. seems like the right size for this one. Word of warning though - this one might be too bitter for newbs."
"Tea-colored ale with a thick, foamy head that retains well. Aromas of faint citrus and sweet bread with hints of berry. Flavors of sweet fruit and bread with a slight citrus rind tartness. Has a really complex and well-balanced profile. I can certainly understand all the hype behind this brew."
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkabiity: Seems like this is a cult classic, so I was glad to find this. I would definitely drink this again."
""
"12oz can, it's a deep golden ale topped with a frothy, ivory colored head holds great retention and leaves thick, chunky lacing. Aromas are floral hops, bready malt, citric, caramel, a bit tropical. Tastes are bready, caramel, pungent grapefruit, and pine. Nice mouth-feel here with a smooth creaminess, while being medium bodied. Overall, solid APA, and holds a bit of nostalgia for me as I highly sought after this beer a few years ago before it was available in IL."
""
"The appearance was an amber/gold with a lot of bubbles with a foamy head when poured. The smell definitely had some hops to it and smelled of citrus with a touch of pine. The taste overall was OK to me it had a very strong hop taste so it was a little overwhelming to me."
""
""
""
""
""
"reminds me a lot of SNPA, one of my favorites. I would probably give this a slight edge over that."

"Taste more like an American IPA than American Pale Ale. Highly drinkable, 6.5% ABV is well hidden. Very delicious beer."
""
""
""
"O: A solid beer. It packs a lot of flavor, between the aggressive hopping and the intense bready malts. i would almost say that they over-did it if they really want to call this a ""pale ale"" Definitely a big beer, and it goes down easily."

""
""
""
"This is a very good canned beer."
""
""
""
"Flavors are a straightforward good, really good. The delicate balance of hops and malt backbone are nicely achieved, and the citrus/piney characteristics are certainly present in both the initial flavors and the aftertaste. Dale's Pale Ale should satisfy APA fans that appreciate a snappy hop presence, and at the $10 six pack price point, it is a solid value well worthy of trying."
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours a beautiful light orange color with a good finger-width of head that hangs around. Great lacing on the side of the glass as well. The smell is very gentle, just a hint of citrus and hops. Taste is much more assertive, great citrus flavors and a decent hit of hops, really nice and balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation - very easy to drink. One of the best pale ales I've had, so glad Michigan has this now"
"This is the first can of this I have ever had. I've had samples on numerous occasions, and I never got around to reviewing it. It's a solid APA. It slowly loses some of its charm over the course of 19.2 ounces, but I still think it would be good with food. Worth a try, for sure."
"O - Maybe I just got an incredibly fresh batch of this, but my god. This is one of the ten best beers I've ever tasted. I drank this after a large bottle of Hennepin (another personal favorite) and this beer blew it out of the water... Let me just put it this way: I stopped posting on BA about 2.5 years ago because I just kinda got bored of it. This beer inspired me to come back and post a review. Between this and the also-exceptional Fat Tire Shift Pale Lager, I am quickly becoming a canned beer convert. If you see it, try it."

"O - Very solid APA that I could drink all day. This is a nice one to keep in the fridge."

"I like it and I'm stoked that Oskar Blues has entered our market but I'd have a hard time buying this again when its 17$ a 6er, I'm grooving on it but I'd take Red Racer or Lagunitas Sucks for the same price"
""
""
"Taste was better than aroma led me to believe. Very nice body, with slight caramel sweetness, but not too much and not in the finish. Wish I could get in Indy."
"Overall: Again, I love Oscar Blues so I think i'm going to try this one again. I really got a bit of a different flavor profile than some of the other reviews that I saw on here. It is a good beer, but there are other pale ales I enjoy more."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very flavorful beer. The first sip is almost overbearing because it shocked me with all the citrus flavor. After that I knew what to expect and it was really good. Although not a session beer, I'm going to love drinking this occasionally."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: luckily this beer is so readily available. I dismissed it as average the first time I tried it, but after having it on tap and a few more cans it has become a top tier, well brewed pale ale. Easy choice for when I want something in a can"
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied and smooth, concealing the strength and kick. Very hoppy, so very hoppy. A very good and enjoyable drink for really kicking back year round. Cans keep it cold and it is best served very cold. Red IPA's seem the best in my experience and this one embodies that rule. Love it."

"O - This is a really solid pale. As opposed to other pales that are bland and unremarkable, this one has character. Great malt profile, bolder that normal hops, somewhat slick mouthfeel, and very drinkable. If this was readily available to me, I think it would be my go to session brew."

"Overall: Comes across as a more oily and bitter Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Many claim this is more like an IPA, but despite the bitterness, the more grainy and sweet malts keep this in Pale Ale territory."
""
""
""
"O: Perhaps the most ubiquitous canned craft brew, and for good reason. It's crispness and citrusy hop bite make it a refreshing quaff that hits the spot especially well in those bbq/outdoor roles. Not the deepest APA, and a bit aggressive, but in the end that's what makes this beer work."

"This beer is light and crisp but still hoppy. Hoppy but not too bitter. This beer has been around for what seems like forever now but it's stood the test of time. Oskar Blues is the original canned craft beer. At first it seemed like that they were just a novelty beer. ""Beer that doesn't suck in a can!", but it really is a great drink. Now everyone is trying to mimic their canning, most notably 21st Amendment."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a good example of an American Pale Ale, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style, but it seemed to be right on the border of the style and it was pretty close to an IPA, i have had more than a few IPA's that were much less bitter. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't that smooth because it was a little overly bitter, but the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, so I could myself drinking a couple of these, but it's not the type of APA that I could drink all day during the summer, the bitterness is a little to high for that. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty good and I thought it had nice balance to it. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of bitterness, if the bitterness was toned down like a normal APA it would really help the drinkability. I might buy this beer again, but it isn't something that I feel the need to rush out to the store and buy more, but it's for sure worth the price and I would recommend giving it a try if you like APA's and IPA's. All in all i wasn't wowed with this beer, but I thought it was pretty solid for the style and it was fairly enjoyable, but with a couple adjustments I could see this being a great session Pale Ale. This made for a nice first impression of Oskar Blues and i'm interested too see what the rest of their beers are like, it's always nice when good brewery's starts to distribute here, welcome to Michigan Oskar Blues."

"O - Really impressed! Has the drinkability of an APA with some explosive flavors you may expect in an IPA. 6.5% ABV hidden very well"
""
""
""
"O- for the style, this is superb. Well balanced and very easy drinking, really like the maltiness of this one."
""
""
"I could put away a few of these during a good night of drinking, but it wouldn't be the first one I'd grab off the shelf in terms of taste. Good for the price, and drinkable for 6.5 abv, but middle of the road nonetheless."
"I thought the nose on this was piney with a nice clean malt presence. Taste had a nice hop presentation of resin and citrus, a bit more pine forward in my opinion, good level of bitterness. The malt was present but unobtrusive. Medium body, holds together well. Drinks clean and finishes slightly bitter. Nice all-around APA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I suppose it's an APA. I usually find APAs to be a little less hoppy than IPAs, but this one has quite a huge hop presence, to my taste buds. I really find that it's an APA/IPA hybrid. This is quite a complex, tasty APA, and it's a better beer than Mama's Little Yella Pils, but I don't know that I'd find this beer to be very sessionable. Not so much because of the ABV, but I'd prefer my session beer to be a bit less bitter.. despite the fact that the fruity, floral hops are quite nicely balanced with the malt sweetness. Dale's Pale Ale is a beer that I've wanted to try for a long time, and I'm glad to have such a damn good canned beer in the great state of Michigan. A slick, simple looking can, a tasty, sexy looking beer... Oskar Blues can make some tasty brews."
"I enjoy the APA style, mainly because of the nice hop jolt they deliver while remaining (at least somewhat) sessionable. Dale's Pale Ale follows those guidelines quite nicely - a solid deliverance of hoppy goodness and sky-high drinkability. I'm starting to like the guys at Oskar Blues."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Most aspects of this beer were great. The taste fell a little short for me, however, especially after that uniquely wonderful aroma. I was expecting a burst of flavor, but it was rather mild. For 6.5% it has a slightly harder punch than most pales, and it comes in a can! Gives me a more mobile option if I'm wanting to drink craft, especially if places don't allow glass. Watch out pool party, Dale's is coming with me. And for a really good time, I'll throw in some Ten FIDY's!"

"Overall - Really solid pale ale. Assertively hopped. Rides the edge between an APA and an IPA. Not one of the more flavorful or complex pales out there (I'm looking at you New Dogtown and Red Chair), but it's entirely drinkable, and a really good beer all it's own."

"I cracked a can of Dale's Pale, poured into a British pint glass, hoisted it to get a good look and spied my 18 year old son through the glass, a cherished memory (until he flipped me off). The appearance is beautiful, and the smell is outstanding. I loved the feel of this beer, and the taste led me to wish I could have had a second. Who would have thought such great beer would pour out of a can?"

"I hope Dale doesn't mind I take a few nips... Regardless, this stuff pours a clear sunrise amber topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, light flowers, light grass, and a version of sweet caramel that blends in quite well with the surroundings. The taste brings in more of the same, with a sharper sense of the grass and the rind of the orange. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice pale ale, straight up."
"Had at a local establishment on tap. Appearance was a hazy amber to honey color with an of white head. Head held for a short time with some lacing. Aroma was light and of flower and malt. Taste was maly with a hint of pine and slight hop on the back. Mouthfeel was full and clean. Aftertaste was hoppy and lasted a bit. Something I could drink all night."
""
""
"In the South, where I live, Dale's Pale Ale stands out as that craft brew from afar that a lot of places carry, and that proves time and again to be a superior brew over the locals and the typical non-local stuff that appears on drink menus here. It is clearly underrated here on Beer Advocate because it gets lost in the crowd of pale ales and IPAs that are out there. But in a place where there isn't so much of a crowd of those brews, Dale's absolutely kicks ass. I first had it on the rec of friends at Motorco and Geer Street Pub in Durham, NC, then had it at again at a Mellow Mushroom in Atlanta, and every time I thought, damn I'm glad the server recommended this. It's really more of an IPA than a PA, and for me that is just fine. It is cloudy, very flavorful and drinkable, and would be high on the list of beers I would offer to newbies wanting to get into hoppy craft beers. This review is based on my Mellow Mushroom order, which was the first Dale's I had drank in a year, and I was stunned by how good it was. A beautifully thick, cloudy brew with a nice balance between assertive, hoppy flavors and drinkability. I think it's a superstar in the craft brew world."
"O- It's a very highly drinkable beer, but i hate that it's just hoppy. There could be more added flavor."

"Pours hazy light orange with one finger of a white head. This is a hop forward pale ale but still remains balanced. Other hop profile dominates the palate of the beer with onion and earthy like hop flavors. There is a touch of pine and no citrus flavors to speak of. The beer has a malt backbone of breaddy malts and a caramel crispness. The beer has a big feel to it, a surprisingly thick and chewy feel for a pale. High carbonation as well from the can. Overall, its a solid pale ale, not quite a sierra Nevada but a solid choice."

Make sure you recycle the can!"

"O: I really like this pale ale it is one of my go to's for a party/session beer and it will do the trick fast while tasting great which is exactly what I want for a beer in that purpose. Outside of that its still a really solid pale ale that I highly recommend you try if you haven't already."

"This offering pours a medium to deep copper with a small white head. The retention is pretty nice eventually becoming just a ring around the side with a thin layer of foam on top. Lacing is spectacular. The smell is nice. I pick up a lot of earthy smells, hops, grasses, citrus, etc. Taste is big. Upfront you get a big malty sweetness which seems to move seemlessly into a spicy hop bitterness. This was my first Dales and it was pretty much as good as its reputation."

"12 ounce can into pint glass; canned on 10/9/2012, ""Homing Required?"" motto. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big orange, orange zest, grapefruit, caramel, floral, grass, light pine, bread, and light herbal spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; not as strong as I would have hoped. Taste of orange, caramel, grapefruit, light pine, floral, grass, citrus rind, bread, and herbal earthiness. Fair amount of piney citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, caramel, pine, floral, grass, citrus rind, bread, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice hop flavor complexity and malt flavor balance with the bitterness; with zero cloying flavors noticed after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any arming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice APA! Nice hop flavor complexity and malt balance; and extremely smooth to drink. A very tasty and satisfying offering."
""
"O: Reviewed this one out of a glass, but the others I enjoyed right out of the can. This is one refreshing, easy drinking APA. Bitter, yes, but also balanced and smooth as hell. If you can find this fresh its worth a try. A classic American style Pale Ale to the tee."

"Served from nitro-tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured golden yellow-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, and pine. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, pine, and cream. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I’ve had this brew in quite a few different servings and have enjoyed each quite a bit. This one was no exception. The nitro really didn’t take much out of this one, but it did add one interesting note that I got with the cream. Not sure where it came from, but it really didn’t hurt nor help the brew. Just a note. The carbonation was cut down as one would expect on the mouthfeel, but was still quite nice. I would drink this brew in just about any format. Now to find a cask!"

"Poured from a can into an English pub glass at fridge temperature. An aggressive pour builds a pretty, white three inch head that lingers and falls to a rocky foam. The beer is medium amber, completely clear, with languid bubbles. The nose is earthy, citrus, a little fresh cut grass, some pine. The flavor is malt up front, with pine resin, some honey or toffee, and a bit of a lingering, drying bitterness. Mouthfeel is slick and coating. A very decent, non-challenging American Pale Ale that has enough going on so you can serve it to a crowd with some beer geeks in it but not such a hop bomb that only hopheads will like it; in other words, a good party beer."

"Pours a clear dark orange with two finger thick white head, streaks of lace down the glass. Smell: herbs, pine, a whiff of grapefruit. Taste: sweet at the start then a blast of bitterness, somewhat indistinct, but mostly pine oriented, then minty and earthy with some orange citrus in the finish. Carbonation is right; oily with lingering herbs + earth. This is good, except for the BS about this being a pale ale. It's an IPA that's weak in the aroma department; judge it as such. Canned 9/4/12."

"Poured a pale golden color with a about a finger of off white head. Slight bready fruity smell. Not a whole lot of nose on this one. Dale's has a medium, malty, biscuty, body with a lot of bitterness on the back end. It drinks very much like an IPA IMHO. It's not bad but not great, but is very drinkable. It just seems a bit unbalanced for a pale ale. If some poured it in a glass and said guess the style I would have said IPA, which isn't entirely a bad thing"

"Poured from a cold can to tall glass, a classic somewhat dark amber with a solid eggshell head and solid lacing. The nose picks up a beautiful citrus-pine hop with a pleasant root beer malt hint. Very high end for a pale ale! The flavor brings on more of the same with vanilla sweetness and more of a hop grain attack that satisfies any hop appetite in the pale ale world. I also sense a near chocolate malt complement. Medium bodied with a frisky feel from lively carbonation, this is one great pale ale! Highly drinkable and well recommended."
"O - Decent pale ale. It's a lot smoother on draft than when I had it in a can. The hops aren't to overpowering which allows it to smooth over."

"Had on-tap at Mellow Mushroom in Myrtle Beach. Honey colored with a finger of off-white head that reduced to a thin layer pretty quickly, but it stayed throughout the drink and had some lacing. Slightly piney, citrusy nose up front. Malty/bready notes were in there. Malt sweetness up front on the taste that gave way to a hop (piney/herbal) bitterness in the middle and citrus on the finish. Some bitterness lingered and it was semi-dry."
""
""
"Picked this up while on vacation in Denver. Beautiful amber-copper pour with a creamy two finger head with good retention and great lacing. Big floral, perfumey nose with subtle resiny citrus hops and a solid caramel malt base. Taste follows suit wonderfully. Resiny, perfumey hops are perfectly balanced with toasty, bready, sweet caramel malt. Hints of orange peel, toffee, biscuit, and tea. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly sticky with a great tangy, dry, bitter hop bite on the finish. This is very close to the perfect Pale Ale. Flavorful and bold, but oh so drinkable!"

"Dave's Pale ale is almost an IPA who's flavor complexity almost seems like the floral version of Sierra Nevada's bench mark pale ale. The body is about perfectly balanced for a hop-head, and is light enough to drink several in an evening. Plus it comes in a can, which makes it perfect for camping, backpacking, etc. Oskar Blues is quickly becoming my favorite Colorado brewery."

"I tried this beer while on a recent trip out of state and liked it so much I brought a bunch of it home with me. If you're a fan of big, aggressively hopped beers, you need to try this.

I didn't find it particularly well-balanced. I would probably buy it again but not very often as there are a number of others beers I prefer within this price range."
"O: One of my favorite American pale ales. It is easy to drink despite its higher ABV. Plus they were one of the first craft breweries to do the can. I love cans; they are perfect for day hikes and fishing trips. This beer fits the bill perfectly for those adventures (as do many other Oskar Blues beers). The fact that this beer is in a can increases my overall rating for this beer."

"I think this beer is pretty nice overall but for the price paid ($10.50 for a six pack) there’s a bit of a want for more oomph. For the same money or maybe a bit more you have a fair choice of DIPAs. Leviathan, Resin and Hoptimum are a few that come to mind off the top of my head. Granted, those are in four packs rather than six but considered from the point of just buying a set dollar amount’s worth of beer I think those are giving you more bang per serving."

"Overall: A solid Pale Ale, but the hop bitterness crushes any ""balance."""
"Overall: Dale’s Pale Ale is a mostly average pale ale that most people will have tasted better variations of. As far as canned pale ales go, Sierra Nevada is definitely the way to go, but Dale’s is certainly not bad by any means. Seriously, smelling this beer is worth the price of admission, but do not be surprised when the taste fails to measure up. 14.5/20"

"Aroma of buiscuit malt and pine, good use of specialy aromatic malts. Taste is pretty bold for a pale ale. Strong malty caramel favors with an almost puckering bitterness. Somewhat earthy flavor overall. Mouthfeel has a medium body but sticky and sweet with a strong bitter finish that leaves the mouth dry and puckered. This beer bridges a gap between an ipa and a pa and does it nicely. Not something I drink all the time but definitely in the rotation."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It has a warming alcohol inclusion and blends together nicely. I feel like this can is a bit dated as the hops dont really have that brightness you would expect from a solid american pale ale. Overall its a good brew that I would have again if i knew the cans were fresh."
""
"Nice balance of bitterness and sweetness with a lingering bitterness that I like. Not too sweet or dry maybe a bit on the high side alcohol wise for a pale ale. The nose on this beer starts nicely but seems to slip away kind of fast. Firm body for style and overall one of my favorite beers for a long time."

"Seek this one out and dole out to your BMC buddies at your next get together."

"Poured into a pint glass. The beer is clear copper with an off-white head. The beer appears to be well-carbonated with some bubbles on the side of the glass and rising from the bottom of the glass. Plenty of sticky lacing is left on the side of the glass. The aroma is of sweet malts and citrus and piney hops. The flavor is hop forward. There is a nice blend of citrus and bitter piney hop flavors. The malt backbone adds mild sweetness. The amount of hops borders on IPA territory rather than just a pale ale. The body is medium with adequate carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer. It definitely is a solid offering from Oskar Blues that is worth trying."
""
""
"This beer pours piss brown and yellow with some slight oranging and a big thick creamy head that leaves good rings of lacing swirling in the glass, and has a mellow retention. Smell is an excellent mix of spicy piney hops and sweeter caramel malts. There is a surprisingly great spiciness to this smell which I am finding thoroughly intriguing. Its taste is light an almost caramelly, but with some nice spice hints and good hops-bite. There is a slight soapiness present from the hops taste, but it is not too bad here. I really was hoping for more of the spices found in the smell, but it kind of disappointed in that aspect. It’s cool and refreshing, just not as spicy and complex as the smell had me thinking. The mouthfeel is cool and crisp with a good carbonated tingle on the tongue that slides away quickly leaving a dryly wet hop feeling, if that makes sense… There are good amounts of saliva on the tongue, but it just feels slightly burnt and dry from the hops. It’s a feel I have come to expect in more hoppy beers I just have been unable to explain it so far. Overall, this is decent beer, but I’m a little disappointed after the amazing taste of Deviant Dale’s India Pale Ale. Dale’s normal pale ale is good it’s just nowhere near as good as the Deviant Dale."
""
""
""
""
"O: Extremely easy to drink, enjoyable, and very sessionable. Slightly more hoppy that I expected for the style (might be right on the border of an IPA)."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, it's a very good beer and a classic version of the style. It's got a nice hop presence to it and is very drinkable and flavorful."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

"Nothing wrong with the mouthfeel here. Dale's is medium-bodied for the style, with fine carbonation levels. Overall, this is an above-average pale ale. Nothing more."

"O/D - A pretty solid APA. Nothing to complain about. Quite nice with a well balanced flavour."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As the Bros say, this one blurs the line between pale ale and IPA. I love that it is canned, but not available in Utah"
""
"If you told me this is an IPA, I wouldn't question it. Has that strong, bitter taste (and aftertaste) that I've come to know and love over the years. Lacing all over the glass. A somewhat lighter version of Stone's IPA in my opinion. Absolutely delicious, but if you're looking for a more traditional pale ale, I'd recommend Flying Dog, Troegs, or Sierra Nevada. Heavy duty stuff, and a brew I will revisit quite often."

"One of the best cans to bring camping, hiking, golfing, ect. A near perfect Pale Ale. Awesome offering from Oskar Blues! Solid ""A" quality brew."
""
""
""
"Overall this a great beer. Great taste and easy to drink."
"O: really nice beer to session. Te malt and hops aren't overwhelming and they actually complement eachother really nicely. Well balanced pale ale with some nice hoppy complements on the back. "
""
""
"1 to 1 1/2 finger white head on top of a dark amber colored beer with a small amount of carbonation bubbles rising. Head dissipates quickly and lacing is below average. Smell reminds me of pine and a little caramel. Taste is better than expected with a pale ale, but not as good as my favorite IPAs. Definitely an easy drinking beer but carbonation is lacking. I could see myself bringing this on camping trips if it wasn't so expensive. I think I'll stick to the new canned Sierra Nevada Torpedos."
""
""
""
""
"- Certainly not a pale ale in my opinion. I judge on style, and this isn't close to being a pale ale. It's an IPA, and would get higher marks from me if it were called one. Nice bitter hoppy IPA though!"
""
"If someone else buys, I might try a third, but I'd prefer an adjunct lager over this slosh."
""
""
"Overall - this is a great tasting brew - just not a pale ale to me to big on the hop flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Biscuity, piney, citrusy aromas spring out of this deep gold pale ale. for a pale ale it's pretty darn hoppy, and coats the mouth a little bit. The full body and medium low carbonation make give it a rich, slightly sweet mouthfeel. This is hop forward, but smooth, with just enough malt behind it. Pretty good, although more of an ipa to me than a pale ale. Tasty."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good- light body with light to moderate carbonation and a good amount of hop resin. Definitely a good pale ale- it's not Alpha King but a good one to drink."

"Great Pale Ale to take outdoors, indoors, school, work, wherever. Will definitely grab some again."

"O-A solid APA, not as good as SNPA but still top notch."
"Overall: For a can this fresh, I was very surprised that such a highly sought after pale ale lacked any surprises. It is much more balanced than the west coast representations, but it doesn't blow you away like they do. I was hoping for more from this beer, but it really just didn't live up to the hype."

"All and all a good if not not great beer."
""
""
"This ale pours a hop induced hazy golden copper color with a sticky white head that lasts as a thin skim. The aroma is highly hoppy--citrus, pine, and spicy. An underlying sweet malt is also evident--decent nose. The flavor is quite hoppy and rather bitter. A constant hoppiness from start to finish with a hop bitterness enhanced dryness at the swallow. The body is medium and carbonation also moderate. Overall a tasty pale ale--definitely on the more bitter end of the spectrum. A solid pale ale."
""
""
""
"O: A decent but unremarkable IPA."
""
"O: I love this beer. While it may not be as tasty as Heady Topper or even some other Colorado IPAs (I consider this an IPA, sorry, BA), it's a phenomenal beer. And - a point that the BA rating system does not let me make - it's in a can. This makes it the perfect beer for the adventurous Coloradan, as well as the perfect go-to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- For a pale ale (as opposed to an IPA of which it treads in that territory), this is one exquisite example. Despite it's 'sessionability,' savor this one, as the lingering bitterness that treads long after swallowing will keep you guessing as to the might of this beer...one of which I will have again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Beer in a can! I love this stuff! My favorite Pale Ale. Some might say the hops profile is too hefty, but the malt and yeast aren't slouches either. I love heavily hopped pale ales. Oskar Blues revolutionized the microbrew market by refusing to bottle and putting their brews in cans. Take it with you anywhere! Highly recommended."

"Pours an orange amber color with a thick head with medium lacing. Aroma is very malty with a hint of sourness. Taste is crisp, citrus, grapefruit, slightly bitter along with a malty backbone. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and drinkability is high. Moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange color with a large white head. Aroma is hoppy with notes of grapefruit and some grass and a touch of caramel malt sweetness. Taste is big on hops with good caramel malt sweetness that offsets the hop bitterness nicely. Medium body and great drinkability."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decent pale ale. At times I taste strange malty notes in there that remind me vaguely of Old Chub (which I don't like very much) and it kind of bother me, but usually I just taste great clean citrus and floral hops. The appearance is the best part of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-seems to be just a little bit light on the flavor. I remember having this one a few years ago and thinking it was better. Perhaps just a bad batch."
""
""
""
"Addendum: It occurs to me now that this beer advertises itself as ""voluminously hopped"" and yet it wasn't extremely hoppy. I checked the bottom of the can and, sure enough, the one I got was about 8 months old. Which makes me wonder if I'd like it less if it were fresh. I'm really not a hophead, so probably. Going to have to find a fresher can and give it a whirl."
""
"A refreshing pale ale. The hops and alcohol make it hard to imagine drinking a too many of these but it is still a tasty beer. The hop aftertaste is very pleasant."
""
" A truly great beer without excess. How often do you find that? If you see someone drinking this after an afternoon working outside, you KNOW they know good beer! So good I want another!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours of clear dark orange with a white head. Goos amount of lacing and carbonation. Aroma of malty sweetness and minimal citrus hops is also present. Taste is strong caramel malt with well balanced light hop finish. Less bitter than I expected. Mouthfeel is medium."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fine beer. I've had pales I prefer to this, however. I wish I could get this in cans, but to me it wasn't quite as good as the Bitter American I had earlier tonight."
"O: This was good but not great. I guess it's cool that it's in a can."
""
"Makes for a great golf buddy!"
""
""
""
""
"O- I can see why this has such a strong reputation, but overall a bit too bitter for my tastes."
"O - I'd agree with others that I seems more like an IPA than a pale ale but either way it is awesome and a great beer for most any occassion"
""
""
""
"O: I'd consider this a well balanced IPA rather than a hopped pale ale but whatever its a good beer. One of the better flagship/everyday beers out there. A bit pricey in Mass for what it is, but a good beer. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Not bad but if I had a choice I would drink something else."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Color me impressed. I'm not really a hops guy but can wade in out to pale ale depth. This one is surprisingly nice. I love the way the hops pop in to say hi and then dart out. It's neat because it's not just a taste, it's a little event. I love when a beer does something active like that. It puts it on my ""memorably interesting"" list. With a little more malt character I'd be totally onboard."
""
""
""
""
"Ov: Honestly, how is this not an IPA? This beer is full of flavor, character and body. The bitter hops will delight and you will drink any and all I place in front of you. Enjoy each one as it is poured. Cheers!"
"O - An impressive, balanced pale ale. Extremely drinkable for 6.5% ABV. I only wish I had a few more on hand."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Love it. great session beer."
""
"Light bodied with light carbonation, this beer is easy drinking but could use a bit more fizz. The body is spot on for the style but the carbonation could use a bit of work. The swallow is rather weak due to the lack of carbonation."
"Overall - This is a very nice IPA. While, not having read up on the beer prior, I was expecting something with a much more mild hop flavor and something on the sweeter ale side, so when I got my first experience of the smell and taste it really struck me off guard, but in a very good way. It’s a good brew to go for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Light body, moderate carbonation."
""
""
"Medium bodied, it's definitely a creamy beer. The carbonation feels a little weak, and only bites the tongue when you hold onto your sip for a few extra seconds, but it's present enough to maintain continuity. Beer coats the tongue well and finishes dry."
"Hazy amber with a fluffy, creamy beige head. Subtle aroma of creamy, caramelly and grainy malt and mild lemon zest and grapefruit hop oils. The caramel, grain, breadiness and and light cookie elements tend to be a bit more dominate. The body is relatively moderate, a little light and easy drinking with molderate to active carbonation. The flavor has a nice balance of sweet malt and mild hop character."
"Reddish/copper color with a 1/4"" off white head. Steady carbonation with little tiny bubbles. When the head recedes, it coats the glass. Aroma is somewhat sweet with spicy, piney, and a touch of citrus hoppiness. Nice malt base and some good hops flavor. The hops have a mostly piney flavor. There is a bit of an agressiveness to the flavor, with a full mouthfeel."
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a 2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some herbal and citrus zest hops. Taste is of malt up front with the herbal and citrus zest hops on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good pale ale but nothing too remarkable."
""
""
""
"Overall - It's semi-dry, highly drinkable, delicious, and well-balanced."

""
"Overall this is a great beer. very drinkable and love that its canned, great beer to bring to a party or a friends to share while watching the game."
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is copper with a finger of head that does not linger very long. Mild fresh hop nose is passable, but not impressive. The malt profile is more reminiscent of and ESB than an APA. The finish is thin and flat. My first taste of an Oskar Blues offering - kind of a bummer"

"Oskar Blues Dales Pale Ale: This is my favorite backpacking beer, a great brew that comes in a can. The body is clear and golden, with an average white head. Great aroma of spicy hops and pine. The malt is balanced, and peppered with a finish of hoppy bitterness. This is a great pale ale if you like a hoppy kick to your drinking experience."
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent pale ale which gives a good accounting of itself, and is balanced without becoming too hop forward."

"Overall: Well put together beer, but just right when you drink it. Sometimes I feel like just ""inhaling"" the glass. Not you starter beer if you just started drinking but definitely your keeper to keep an above average beer in your fridge for the right price. Salud!"

"Overall Impression- A very hoppy brew but can tell the malts had a part in here too. At first, I didn't realize this was from Oskar Blues but what would you know? Another great brew! I also thought it was only a Pale Ale and so had a higher rating in the back of my head but now that I know the truth, well, its still awesome! Recommend."

"Crystal clear light amber color with a two finger head that lingers. Has that traditional APA blast of crispy citrus hops. Spicy bitter flavor with a medium sour finish which lingers a little longer than I’d like. I can sense a mild maltiness in the beginning. Not as refreshing as others I’d had of this style.The sour taste does fade after awhile to make it more enjoyable."

"oskar blues flagship brew. now widely proliferated this beer pours a thick amber honey color with a one inch white head that lasts. smells more like an ipa than a pale ale, but has a defined malt strength that i guess qualifies it. taste is quite hoppy too, crisp and satisfying. has a pine and cut grass earthiness to it. mouthfeel is pleasant and smooth, but the heavier body can be filling. this is a versatile beer and a good every day drinker, but i find it works particularly well with spicy foods of the southwest."

"Smooth pour, richer color tone than expected, reddish gold. Lasting white fluffy head with lacing. Moderately hoppy and citrusy scent.

"Torn between 4.0 and 4.5."
"overall - I'd call it an IPA, but a good standard beer."
"Poured from a can into a tumbler pint, the beer is a deep, vibrant, yellow-copper coloring with a one inch, thick, frothy, foamy head that settles quickly into a film covering that also coats the glass fairly well. Good, heavy nose of hops, with a resiny and tangy character, and some light citrus and malt blending. Flavors are hop forward, with a peppery and basil spicing, which is balanced by a buttery and toffee-like malt, as well as a slight citrus highlight. Very well blended. The aftertaste is tangy sweet and resiny hops bitterness, with a slight cloying effect to it. Slick, somewhat lingering finish, with a slow, steady withdrawal that dries evenly and subtly. Good, solid brew."
"(Reviewed 10/30)"
"Overall: Get a case."
"A bit hoppier than I expected, this is a nice and fairly refreshing IPA. Nothing earth-shattering, but certainly pleasant."
"It would make a great session beer. I could drink this all night."
"Overall. Really nice and full flavoured pale ale. Nice taste in both the malts and hops."
"The Dale's Pale Ale pours amber looking haze with a small head. Not much carbonation which is pretty normal for the style. Not much in the way of nose, even as it warms up. It tastes more like an English Pale Ale than an American. Not much in the way of hoppiness. Mouthfeel is fairly thin and goes down easy. Middle of the road pale for me."
"Pours a golden amber with a hefty head that lingers."
"O: I like where this beer is coming from, but the execution is just a hair off. Pretty damn tasty, still; great example of drinkable canned craft."
"Pours a golden honey color with a two finger head and great lacing. Aroma of crazy hops, citrus and pine all up in my grill in the best way possible. Taste follows the nose, this is a great tasty easy drinking canned beer. I love it, I buy it by the case!!!"
"Transparent honey/amber with eggshell colored craggy two finger head, minor lacing only. Nice carbonation, creamy texture, intense toffee malt scent combined with piney resin pitch and citrus oils. On tasting I am surprised this is called an APA, by my tastebuds this brew sits smack on the borderline between my definition of an APA and IPA in bittering. Taste follows the nose but also includes a modicum of Simcoe onion-y-ness that I didn't smell in the nose, Not a deadly large amount mind you, but just the right amount in a sane dose that stays delicious. Really delicious and full of bold flavor in both malts and hops... I only ever revisit about 25% of the brews that I try for the first time and I am pretty sure that this one will be getting a repeat visit in the future, so take that as a recommendation. I just wish more of that flavor was represented in the nose, if I were to nitpick it."
"D: This beer really delivers in terms of flavor. The can might make it good to introduce good beers to skeptics. Oskar Blues hasn't failed to impress me yet."
"Overall-Very hoppy Pale Ale, almost an IPA. Pretty good but have had better Pale Ales that are easy to get."
"Overall this is a very solid Pale Ale and a great session beer..."
"Its a solid APA, typical of the style. Not better and not worse. I wouldnt hesitate to buy again, if its the best choice at the time..."
"*EDIT* Having another one of these tonight straight from the can. Something about the can helps this beer out. Maybe its the suprise factor, or its still familiar. I like it better from the can rather than the pouring, but still agree with the rest."
"Well, even for a guy who doesn't like Pale Ales, this was good. It did seem a bit more bitter than standard Pale Ales (and I've heard a troubled classification of this beer), but judging for what it is, it's pretty good. Easily one of the better beers I've had in the style."
"Very solid, balanced APA. Probably my favorite APA that Ive had to date."
"Poured from a can into a snifter. grassy sweet aroma. Golden apearance, slight head that remains to thinly lace the top. head is eggshell to tan. Taste is that of citrus hops and slightly fruity. Palate is slightly sweet with a nice bitter finish. better on tap or straight from the can"
"O: A very nice pale ale with a great deal of flavor. This brewery is helping me overcome my self-imposed longstanding prejudice against canned beers. Enjoyed this beer and will have again."
"O: a canned staple, love this beer and commonly keep it stocked in the fridge"
"O - Very drinkable. I like the crispness and hop that this pale brings."
"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Canned on 8/29/11, thanks OB. Pours a orange red, with a 1 inch sticky white head, tons of lacing. Smell pine, orange, and grass. Taste all of that, maybe a little bolder then the nose. Very refreshing, but large body for the style. This is the best pale ale going. I would drink this summer, fall, winter, or spring."
"The deep orange color is darker than I would have expected. The aroma is subtle but complex, with a combination of caramel sweetness, earthy hop bitterness, and alcohol. The flavor is much more one-dimensional, with strong notes of pine and grapefruit, making the flavor bigger and bitterer than many pale ales. The bitterness builds, which can make it tough to drink more than a few at a time. Overall, flavorful and a great option among canned beers."
"Overall a very nice APA. Almost sessionable, but a little high in alcohol to have more than two or three at a sitting. Bitterness isn't palate fatiguing. A freshing beer for 6.5 percent and a firm bitterness."
"For my records: Can purchased in mix 6 at PLW, unknown price."
"Overall: I expected more from what everyone told me about this beer. Still a good beer to drink though. Seemed like an IPA and pale ale mix to me. Cheers."
"SkÅL!"
"O- Awesome beer, loved drinking everyone of them. One of the better beers I've had lately. Super refreshing and almost crossing the line into IPA territory. Keeps me wanting more."
"O- Love this beer. This particular batch seemed more hop forward and less balanced than I remember."
"APA is my favorite type of beer and this one is one of the best I've had. Definitely worth a go if you've never had one."
"This might be the most enjoyable beer I've had all summer. Pours a mild pale gold, not a huge head but it's there. Scent is not huge but smell some light citrus and pine resins. Taste is mild, slightly sweet, citrus and bitter. Easy drinking. Mouthfeel is dry. Overall, really nice APA."
"O: The complete product is more than its sums. Why? Well, it's a really good and pleasurable APA that balances very well the sweet and the bitter. The volume/intensity in each category is moderate, but never light or weak. From this standpoint, it's a terrific American Pale Ale."
"Overall / Drinkability: The more I have this beer the more I like it. I could have several of these, but since I had to get back to work later, and they were $7 each at this restaurant, I thought I should abstain. So very drinkable and it pairs well with food. Overall, this is just a finely balanced, smooth and flavorful APA, especially if you like hops. And I would think that even if you didn't, you may still like it. Very good and I can only hope someday 6 packs of it show up in my part of OH."
"D - A nicely balanced pale ale, good hops and nice sweetness combine to make this a very tasty brew"
"Overall an awesome pale ale, so so good."
"The taste was all right. It was hoppy, but there's doesn't seem to be anything unique about this beer. The mouthfeel is just fine. I just realized that this is probably not suited for tubing, but maybe around campfire if you want to really take your time drinking a pale ale."
"Very amber in color. The foamy, off-white head was comprised of medium-large bubbles; good retention and nice lacing. The aroma is very hoppy and floral with a bit of plum. The taste is hoppy, malty and resiny with a tad of citrus and caramel. The beer is fairly balanced, but might be a little on the hoppy side. Medium body with medium carbonation. The finish is bitter but satisfying. The beer seems to almost border on an American Amber. The packaging was deceiving. I would encourage Oskar Blues to hire a marketing company."
"A little hoppy for a pale ale, but damn delicious. And in a can it's perfect for the pool or tailgate."
"Great beer. Great hop and malt character. Well balanced."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. I am a big fan of Oskar Blues and Dale's is one of my favorites. Definitely worth a shot."
"D - Overall, I thought this was a good drink; would make a great beer to have with a meal; nice creamy feel and good APA hop flavor; highly recommended to others"
"Pours amber with a thin, white head. Faint malt aromas quickly usurped by the hop bouquet. The hops are fragrant, and come close to a IPA for hoppiness.. The taste definitely does not disappoint; smooth malty sweetness perfectly balanced by the bittering hops. Hop flavor is evident as well. Medium body with a very smooth mouthfeel. Finishes clean. Really well done."
"A good pale ale, though admittedly, a little disappointing after falling head over heels in love with Oskar Blues Ten Fidy."
"Definitely a favorite beer, and it comes in a can too!"
"O - Dale's Pale Ale is easy to recommend for ""no glass"" situations when one needs canned beer and wants one that is hoppy."
"O - Overall this is probably my favorite American Pale Ale. It is indeed a ""voluminously hopped motha"" of an APA. Not quite an IPA, it is less bitter, while still very flavorful with hops. This is a pale ale that beer lovers can adore, but that won't scare off newcomers as much as an IPA might. Delicious and refreshing, this is one of my go-to beers."
"Poured a nice rich attractive amber color with fluffy off-white head that lasted for a while. Nice hoppy aroma. This was a very nicely balance pale ale. Mouth feel and carbonation were perfect. This was easy drinking and I could drink a lot in a sitting. I think I have a new favorite Pale Ale."
"Had this yesterday at the Idle Rich Pub, here in Dallas and it's pretty much the draft version only as a cask. Again it is PA defined. Serveed with a creamy, thick, medium sized head that just sat there. Lots of lace. Great mouth feel. Chewy hops that are perfectly matched to the malt and carbonation style. Exceedingly well balanced. Did notice a hint of butterscotch in there, but it was fleeting. Nice easy finish."
"Dale’s Pale is hoppy but balanced. There’s a hop bite to this beer complemented by a malt backbone. Full bodied and slightly chewy. Not sure how well it hews to the style, as I think of my pale ales as being more crisp and floral, but I’m not complaining."
"This American Pale ale is so balanced. That is only the word to describe this beer. Goes down easy with a clean finish. It is really a no brainier. If you are looking for an APA for any occasion then look no further! And the best part is IT IS IN A CAN!!! Love it!! Did I mention it was balanced? HAHA! Pick a six pack up if you see ever see it!!"
"Sharp effervescence up front with a dry finish. Medium body and a somewhat full carbonation. Can't get over the fact that this brew is really an IPA and not a pale ale. Higher marks if labeled as such."
"overall a very good beer definitely need to try if you like pale ale or IPA on the soft side."
"O: Overall I thought this was great beer and love picking this up when I visit my brother. If I could get this beer more easily this one would always be in my fridge really enjoy this APA and it taste great."
"Overall- This would be a good pale, and one I would keep in the fridge if it was a little less expensive. I will stick with Lagunitas New Dogtown Pale instead. 4/5"
"12oz can. Pours a nice medium dark amber with a nice tan head and good lacing. Nose is sweet caramel malt, with citrusy piney hops and fruity aromas. Taste is sweet malt, piney earthy hops bitterness. Palate is medium body with lively carbonation and nice crisp mouth feel. Finishes with a sweet caramel malt, some fruitiness and ending with a good amount of hops for balance. Whoa! For minute there a I thought was drinking an IPA. Seems a bit dark and hoppy for a Pale Ale but overall a fairly good drinkable brew"
"O- not really an american pale ale, but a great IPA"
"I guess that this one’s become a minor classic over the last several years and there’s a reason why. It’s a well made APA with enough flavor to keep the craft beer lovers happy but still approachable enough to bring new drinkers in as well. And it’s in a can! This is solid stuff here that I would never turn down."
"As a gateway beer, this beer probably does very well. While the qualities of this beer are not what I typically care for in an APA, I can not deny that this is one of those few beers that is so well executed for what it is that I can't help but score it higher than I normally would. Recommended, especially if fresh."
"poured into a glass from a can, unfortunately my can's about 2 months old. The color is a nearly clear copper the head drops fast but leaves lacing all around the glass. Not much hop aroma coming at me, smells sweet. Tastes sweet as well, but not in a bad way. There's a little bit of piney-ness/resin going on to balance out the malt, and overall a very tasty beer. I'd love to try a fresh one, but even at 2 months olds, this is very good."
"I could drink these all day; one of the best session beers around and my new favorite pale ale."
"O-Dale's Pale ale was not a bad beer. My sample could have been younger but overall the beer was a flavorful session pale ale that had a sweet front that was backed by a solid but balanced bitterness."
"O- quite possibly the best APA i've had to date"
"Overall, while I find the beer's slogan rather overblown, the beer itself is quite good, and just might change your mind about beer in cans."
"O: 6 packs, 12 packs..It doesn't matter.. Its a beer that easily stocks one's fridge... an every day can that should be in your fridge.. Perfect for fishing, watching tv, grilling, or hangin' with the friends, its a beer that fits in your hand well!"
"I find it very drinkable and pleasant, with the taste complexity of a sipping beer and a lack of heaviness so that you could have more than one. Excellent deliciousness."
"Kudos to Oskar Blues for making such an enjoyable, hoppy brew in such a ""dad's beer""-looking can. Pound for pound, one of the better beers I've consumed in terms of sheer drinkability and cost. My wife and I enjoyed this so much we picked up two extra six packs to replace the first sixer we demolished in the hotel. Great brew."
"Final Thoughts: This is a nice IPA, if only it was an IPA. This is too hoppy for a pale ale (I am well aware that APA's are more hop forward, this is over done IMO.) I love PAs, but this one is really just like a light bodied IPA. I've had IPA's that were much less hoppy. Also the body is too light for a PA. Close to watery. Not happy with this one as a APA. Great looks, good nose, but it stops there for me. If they want to re-market it as a IPA and fixed the body, I'd buy it again."
"The color was a nice copperish color with a white head which left good lacing down the entire glass with every sip. The smell was mostly of hops with a little caramel malts in the back. The feel was medium to light with lots of hop resin coating. The taste was great, even better than I remember (and I remember it being good), you get a little caramel malts up front but a load of bitter pine hops on the way down and a nice hoppy lingering after taste. This stuff is excellent, I actually prefer this over both of their actual (official) IPAs, heck, it might even be my favorite Oskar product, excellent beer."
"Enjoy!"
"Has a huge hop character once poured from the can and has a wonderful pine hop aroma. Very drinkable and much less carbonated that I was expecting but it didn't take away from the beer at all. I would be quick to move this to the IPA category but it also a very solid Pale Ale as well"
"It pours a light orange color with small white head. Light and fruity hop aroma with a hint of sweetness. Taste is similar, with a bit of the sweetness coming through, though not overly sweet. The hoppiness is readily apparent, but not overtly bitter, and perfectly in balance with the malt. I've heard this considered as ""more of an IPA"" though I'm not getting that. The malt backbone is typical for the style, with just a touch more hops than most other APAs. Nice medium-bodied mouthfeel for the style as well. Overall, this is a great rendition of the American IPA."
"Overall - This was an enjoyable APA and surprisingly easy to drink and possibly sessionable. Most APA's I could not drink more than 1 (and then the final 1/4th is forced down). Nicely crafted and a good example of an APA to export to rest of world to see what we're doing well here in the US of A.!"
" Overall really good pale ale.Maybe my favorite Pale ale a must try."
"Overall, a wonderfully creative and full-flavored American beer."
"Good beer, but Dale's Pale has too heavy of a mouth-feel for it to be a Pale, while it is a bit too malt forward for me to consider it an IPA. Style classification issues aside, I really do like this beer because of its well-balanced character and its earthy flavors. I also love the fact that it is in a can because this is a great ""camping beer""....can that be the name of its style?"
"O - I love the fact that there is a good pale ale I can get that comes in a can. A great tail-gating beer. No longer are you stuck drinking monotonous macro canned beer typically found at most tailgates and summer parties. Thank you Oskar Blues."
"Where I've enjoyed this beer the most is on a HOT HOT day, sitting around a fire, cooking foord and throwing a frisbee."
"O: My new favorite pale ale, the juicy hop combo is amazing, the mouthfeel is unreal."
"O: Very sessionable. Good flavor, good balance, nice feel."
"Pretty damn drinkable, definitely pioneering the can revolution."
"Serving type: can"
"Overall: This was enjoyable, although I prefer a couple of local favorites - Alpha King and Daisy Cutter."
"This beer hits all the right notes when it comes to APA/IPA taste. There is robust hop flavor almost imperceptibly (but finely) balanced by a slight caramel of the malts. It has a fantastic hop aftertaste, with a great spectrum of flavors lingering on the palate. Big flavor onslaught and nice complexity make this a standout."
"As I'm sure others would say, it's quite similar to Sierra Nevada PA, but with a bit more hoppiness. That makes for an outstanding beer."
"Poured from a can into a Dale's Pale ale pint glass picked up from the brewery. Amber/orange color with 2FB of white head that dissipates with some lacing. Floral scent. Malty with piney hop flavors with residual bitterness. This has been my go to pale ale for the last year and have tried others available in my area but still coming back."
"O - Good for a hot summer day like today but not sure I'd seek this out year round."
"This beer is really impressive. Poured out as a golden color with a sturdy looking white head on top. The lacing was really good too. The smell of the beer, has a really good hop quality to it. There is a little malt in there too. The taste of the beer is hoppy also, this beer could almost be an IPA I think. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and dry in the aftertaste. Overall I was expective to like this as much as I did, but I was happy that it tasted as good as it did. Very enjoyable brew!"
"o-the can is a great vessel for this beer. It is fresh, hop filled, and balanced. Excelent beer."
"A very nice beer. It has what I like in a Pale ale, color, strong aromas and good hop bitterness. This would be a regular in my fridge if it was only available in my area."
"Good solid well hopped American Pale in a can."
"The can version has more carbonation as you can pour more as you like. Seems to be more of an IPA with the seriously resiny taste. Sharp, an increasingly harsh bitterness, but if that's your style this is full-bodied and straightforward."
"Edit: Had a lot of these since my initial review. Yes, it really is an IPA. Still very balanced, definitely hoppy but not an overwhelming bitter bomb. Easy drinking with a decent malt backbone. Minimal sweetness. Just good clean drinkin' fun."
"This is another solid offering from Oskar Blues. Also loving the can. This may just become my new go-to beer for future summer outings."
"D - Not bad at all. Good example of an APA and kudos to OB for keeping it canned."
"O-Overall this a solid APA. Easy drinking and I really love the portability of the cans. It's not Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but it's pretty damn good."
"Despite the beer's lingering bitterness, this beer is made with quality and dignity. This may be one of the most unintentionally patriotic beers (with a red, blue, white, and silver can), so it's probably quite appropriate at any memorial day/ 4th of July party. I think the price is key to buying this beer a second time and I would certainly recommend it to friends and family."
"Pours a nice straw color and settles a barely hazy amber color. 2 fingers of cream colored head sits briefly. The nose is faint and has a bit of hops and yeast to it but not much more. Thankfully, the taste is much different. A tasty balance of bitter citrus, pine, and malt ensues. A nice honey taste is offered with the malt at the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a dry finish that os crisp. Overall, damn good pale ale and glad I have more to drink!"
"Pours a dark gold with a white one finger head. Fresh hop aroma. taste is an aggressive bitter piney hop flavor up front that transitions to a malt accented finish. Some tingly bitterness on the aftertaste. Very pleasant and drinkable. Borders on an IPA but I love it."
"What a great Pale Ale! Pours clear orangey-copper. Aroma is fruity with hops standing out. Moderate to high carbonation. Medium bodied with nice hop vs. malt balance. Easy drinking and great flavor. This is one of my favorited American Pale Ales, that is always stocked in my fridge, and I am very discriminating when it comes to fridge space. I Love cans!!"
"Dale's pale ale. Going to give this one the shortcut of reviews, looks amazing. Smells decent. Tastes is so good, so good, so good. Great in the mouth. And overall, this beer is really good. Always available, always good."
"It's pretty badass that it comes in a can too. Will definitely be getting more!"
"Had plenty of Dale's before but never like this. Felt like a real treat really dug it."
"Overall great beer, easy to drink and refreshing"
"O – Well worth a try here. Has some great refreshing taste for a hot summer day. I can see this in a cooler at the beach or on a boat."
"O- One of the better pale ale's out there. Add that it's in a can only makes it more appealing."
"Can. Pours slightly hazy orange with a large, long lasting, foamy, white head and a lot of lacing. Aroma is of piney hops and biscuit malt. Medium, smooth body. Citrus fruit, piney hops dominate the palate with sweet, biscuit malt provides some balance. The finish is long and hoppy. At 6.5% abv I would say it is mild, soft IPA."
"Overall, it's pretty good. Better than I was expecting. Will definitely be picking up more of these in the future."
"Overall, Dales is my go to pale ale and I pick some up anytime in Hudson."
"Opinion: Overall this is a decent Pale Ale. It pretty much has all of the elements you expect, lots of hops in the nose, and a bitter finish, and there is some malt to partake in too. I imagine that this would be a different beer if the carbonation was at least twice what it is for this example, so on tap it would be a different experience and I may try it someday. As it is, I won't have a problem finishing the six-pack, but I will probably stick to others if I just want to enjoy a Pale Ale."
"overall a great beer to take on a hike or camping. I love what oskar blues is doing by making great beer portable!"
"O - Well, I must say its been a long time since I poured from a can! This is just a very solid beer and would be a great one for outdoor trips or tailgates. Really really am enjoying it!"
"O- An extremely sessionable pale ale. Not quite as intense as an ipa, but it is a stand out for the style. If I were offered this or Sierra Nevada, I would demand a Dale's Pale Ale!"
"Fantastic for a canned beer, this one shows that canning is a great way to package beer, and top notch beers are no exception. This is the best fishin' beer I have found in cans yet!"
"O: This is a terrific example of a pale ale, maybe the best I've had. If you like hoppier than usual beers for the style, Dale's is something that you should seek out."
"D/O: This may be one of the biggest and most extreme APAs currently in production. The flavor profile comes across as a multi-wave assault on the palate, but really isn't very enjoyable. It seems like a malt-forward ale until the finish, when harsh bitterness sets in--making it seem like a bit of a mess."
"O - I would be tickled silly to pack these out for golf or some other outdoor activity."
"Taste is smooth, a bit hoppy, and full of flavor. It just didn't have quite as much character on-tap than I usually find in the can. Interesting. Still very good."
"O- a very nice easy to drink enjoyable brew. Not the most in your face pale out there, but it would be great on many occasions. If I could get this locally it would probably be a regular in the rotation."
"O- A solid pale. Probably doesn't beat out Sierra Nevada or some of the other greats in the style for me, but still a worthy beer."
"Overall - solid pickup thanks to spinrsx who told me to buy it. would def stock this and would me a great session beer. little more bitterness than SNPA, but very good."
"O - Definitely hoppier than a normal pale ale, so for me at least it is a little bit less drinkable on a hot summer day. The ABV is also uite high for a pale ale so you need to be careful with this."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Appearance is low head and moderate lacing...fairly clear orange IPA color. Smell is certainly of good hops.. pleasant and tropical. Flavor is outstanding. Balance of pine, sweet tropical fruit and a light bready character. Pleasant bitterness and mellow vibes. Mouthfeel is medium, although this beer carries itself and doesn't leave me hanging. This is really once of the best (S)IPA's that I've ever had."
"This pours hazy pale orange and has big chunky head and good retention. The smell is very sweet and malty, with some hops as well. This taste is well rounded bitter and sweet with a high malt presence. There is a nice bitter bite to this as well. This is a solid pale ale with a medium body. Very good. I have also rated this beer from draft, and I thought it was a little more hoppy...probably better overall from the draft."
"Overall - I love the sweet malts and the way they balance with the hops to make such a nice ale I give a thumbs up too this one. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"O:"
"Pours a toffee brown with a finger of off-white head that laces well. Caramel malts and citrus hops on the nose. Hops up front, with distinctive citrus and pine notes, sweet malts and caramel following. Finishes dry and crisp with a little bitterness. Light-medium mouthfeel, and quite drinkable."
"Dale's Pale poured an orange/amber hue. Right off the bat you could smell the hops, very strong. Hints of pine needles, and maybe even some sort of fruit. A very strong hop bitterness for beginning to end. The hops even some to intensify with each sip. Overall, this is definitely one of the better American Pale Ale's that I've ever had. Would certainly recommend it to any APA lovers out there."
"Overall Drinkability - Not as complex as some of the other ones, and has an overbearing aftertaste. It might work well with a food pairing, but by itself not so much unless you're really in the mood for a lingering hop assault."
"O-Solid brew. I would definitely buy this if it was available to me. Thanks to boralyl for hooking me up with this."
"O: More of an IPA than a pale ale, nice hop flavors and bitterness. Good drinkability, solid beer from Oskar Blues."
"M: at 6.5% ABV I would almost consider this an IPA, but the bitterness and hops are not overwhelming enough to do this. I think this beer blurs the line between APA and American IPA. Overall a nice beer"
"Notes: This is another solid Pale. Medium bodied and flavorful, this beer is a very drinkable example of the style. Something tells me that when Oskar Blues brews their beer, they have food and pairing in mind. This one would accompany just about anything."
"This is one of the best pale ales I've had. It's also different then most. More malty than most of the more hop-forward pale ales, though, this has that box checked as well."
"Oskar Blues Brewery Brewing Company--Dale's Pale Ale--25th Great American Beer Festival--2011 12 oz. can. 6.50% ABV. 65 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Dense lasting light lace half inch rocky off white orangish. Slightly cloudy bright amber orange color. Malty mild floral hop soft grapefruit front. Mildly creamy mellow sweet doughy flavored malty rich Pale Ale mild yeast ester hint English Pale Ale body. Mild hop spice rich balanced lingering malt ester end. Big tasty toasty malty brew. Sampled on 4/29/2011. Purchased 6-Pack for $11.00 at PCC--Fremont, Seattle on 4/28/2011."
"Overall: A great, refreshing beer that packs a ton of flavor. It sets the bar very high for canned beers."
"Bold and bitter in the taste. Lots of hops and sharply bitter, this beer is no slouch. Slight fruitiness of oranges in the background, but all of it takes a back seat to the hoppy bitterness. It's by no means balanced and could almost be considered an IPA, but the boldness of the flavoring makes it work. The hop taste sticks around for a while after the sip, making your palate surrender to the bitterness. More than solid, but couldn't see myself drinking more than one or two of these guys in one sitting. Very heavy on the bitterness making it hard for your mouth to keep up with it. Still one of, if not my number 1, go-to pale ale."
"Very creamy mouthfeel that’s crisp and full on carbonation, yet enjoyable and smooth at the same time. A very good feel overall, this is a medium bodied beer that is middle of the road as far as a style, but very above average in taste. A really nice beer that is to me the best session can beer I've consistently had, especially since it is perfect year round in any setting."
"Nice looking can leads to a nice appearance score. The nose was faint hops. Not much came through the can though. Regardless, this beer is all about balance and drinkability. The light hop profile mixes perfectly with a light male sweetness to create a distinctly quaffable pale ale that is both hoppy, but also as drinkable as a light lager. The hops are faintly citrusy, with some bitterness that doesn't go overboard. Good carbonation and an easy mouthfeel. I'm very impressed OB. Now, as pale ales go, this is about the opposite of a beer like Hoppy Birthday from Alpine, which is a feat as a low ABV hop bomb. This is more about sitting around the camp fire with a few brews, and as that, it is a winner."
"D: Excellent. My go-to summer time beer."
"O- A very good pale ale. No body makes a better canned beer than Oskar Blues"
"Overall I can see myself buying another case of it since it's around the 30-32 mark. I love how hoppy this beer is and it even drinks great months after it's ""canned on"" date. Pretty much the best Pale ale that's like an IPA in a can around my neck of the woods. Great Beer!"
"Not as good as I thought it would be....color is good, very easy to drink. The flavor just didn't pop. Maybe I worked myself up for this too much before drinking. Found this beer to be like many other average IPA's with just a little more flavor but an excellent pour coming from a can."
"Good stuff, its a bit big for a pale ale. But I would say above average and well worth trying then buying again."
"Final thought - I love you osker blues!"
"Overall: Excellent beer, proves that good things can come in a CAN. Hoppier, maltier, and higher ABV than your standard pale ale, I personally would classify this as an IPA."
"I strongly suggest this to anybody that loves IPA's and wants a Pale ale that taste just like one. The rich tasting astringent hops really shine through in this beer. The sweetness does take a back seat but if it didn't have any sweetness to balance it out then this would really be even more bitter than it is. An exceptional beer by Oskar Blues."
"O: Overall, a very drinkable simple Pale Ale in a can. A nice alternative to PBR etc for an outdoor event picnic etc. I like it, it's not ""wowing"" me, but its a good tasty Pale Ale. I'd like to try it on tap, I can imagine it tasting much better fresh on tap. I will surely buy this again for the right outdoor situation."
"O- This beer does everything it supposed to do. It holds true to its style and its in a can! I want to go camping with Dales vey soon."
"O: For hop lover this a dream of a pale ale. Great hopiness, nice citrus and pine flavors that you expect in an IPA yet clean and sessionable. This is a beer that you could drink on any given day, not to mention it's awesome for throwing in the back pack for a snowboard session or packing in the cooler for fishing on the boat."
"Medium body and carbonation. Bitterness . Bitterness. Bitterness. In the best possible hop kind of way."
"O: Hit the spot. A solid, balanced hopped pale ale. Not as complex as what I typically go for, and I would not seek it out just to have it given choices, but I would gladly accept it when offered, and I'm in the mood for the style."
"O - I will buy this beer again, very drinkable, and it comes in a cool can!"
"Poured a nice copper orange color with a little bit of head and some light lacing. Smell is citrus with the hops coming through. Taste is very good. Great bitter hop flavor. Almost tastes closer to an IPA. Either way it's delicious. Went down really smooth, great light bodied beer. I really really liked this beer. Glad I finally got a chance to try it. Will definitely purchase again."
"O: One of the better pale ale's I've had. No alpha kong but very tasty. Very pleasantly surprised. Of course why would I be... they do make the ten fidy."
"WORTH TRYING, BUT NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"Been looking forward to this and it lived up to (my internal) hype. Very nice and a fresher example would probably have been great."
"O - Nice brew and fairly drinkable. This is also another new option popping up in shops here in NH. While I enjoyed it, I'll likely stick to some locals."
"O: I think this is a fantastic representation of the style. Very refreshing and easy to enjoy, and extremely well balanced. None of the flavors in particular stand out or are extremely special in their own way, but that's what is making this become more and more of a staple in my fridge."
"This beer pours an amber color with a small lasting head. Smells very hoppy and bitter. The taste is hoppy, very bitter, with a bit of a bite of the end. Hops stay arounf the paletee for a while. Overall a very apa, ejoyed this one and would get it again."
"So I am in New Hampshire for the Great Bay Half Marathon...its the night before a race and ....why not drink some....ok....alot of the local beer!!! Sitting at the Portsmouth brewering Co and ordered a Dale's thinking it was local...NOT! From Colorado....still quite tasty. This beer has was copper in color with thin white head and great lace. The smell has a subtle pine/citrus. This beer has a piney taste that tickles the tongue that has a nice balance in maltyness. The smell funnels into the taste of this beer. The light ABV leads to this beer being a Session...certainly worth a taste."
"Although I would have liked more of the hops that I got in the aroma to have come through in the taste, this is still an enjoyable pale ale. Might be a slightly old can. Easy drinking and sessionable with more flavor than a macrobrew. I'd say it's worth checking out."
"OVERALL: It is easy to see why this is one of the most highly touted Pale Ales in the country. This is a Pale Ale that is strictly for the hop heads, but if you can handle the hops you can also handle more than one or two of these beers."
"12oz can purchased at Bottle Caps in Daytona Beach, FL. Pours a beautiful, bright amber hue with one finger of eggshell white head and sheets of lacing on the shaker. What an attractive brew! Smell and taste are floral, piney, and citric hops, orange peel, sweet and bready malts, caramel, biscuit, fruity and acidic hop flavours with a delicate, rounded bitterness to end. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation with a juicy-oily finish. Not nearly as dry as most U.S. pales, this one refreshes the palate while delivering lots of hop goodness. In that regard it reminds of Bell's Two Hearted Ale. Overall, Dale's would be my stand-by session beer if it was available in Ontario. A delicious and easy drinking APA."
"O: very nice brew.. drinks more like a 5.5% abv than a 6.5%"
"I've had Dale's before and remember enjoying it much more. This experience revealed the beer to be far too soapy and bitter. Overall, not my cup of IPA."
"O - A really nice flavorful canned ale here. Alot more flavor than your standard pale ale, this beer has a nice complexity about it while maintaining high drinkability. Nice combo."
"Darker-side of the caramel spectrum as far as PAs go. Sweet malt, dank hops on the nose. Mmm, nice caramel malt finished from floral hops, a bit of bitterness. Thin to medium. Um yeah, nice PA they put together. Not sure what my overall score is, but my drinkability is a solid 4.0."
"I'm not a pale ale drinker and this one is a typical reason why. It's completely neutral in my mouth. Oskar Blues does amazing beer and this just doesn't do anything for my mouth. I might be able to enjoy it with a steak on a patio on a summer day, but I think I could also enjoy a lot better one than this. Let this be one of the last beers you have from them."
"The color is the amber you'd expect and the smell is hoppy and with some faint malt. Taste is hoppy with a nice malt foundation. I don't find much complexity about it. The mouthfeel is nice and full and the drinkability is damn good. A very balanced, well-made brewski."
"This was my first experience w/ Oskar Blues, and I wasn't let down. I do want to try this one again one day much fresher. Once again, this is an IPA, not a pale ale. Very refreshing brew."
"Drinkability: I can put it down but I'm not super enthusiastic about this beer. I would never turn one down but I probably won't be buying this one again."
"I highly recommend this ale for any occasion."
"Overall: I really really like this one and its become a warm weather go to beer for me ."
"The feel is good. Nice light body but the carbonation is a bit sharp. Overall this is a good beer to have around. One that I can keep in the fridge and share with company."
"Medium body consistent with the style but with a large hop punch."
"D - its drinkable but because I kept being reminded of a watered down taste it didn't exactly make me want to imediately crack another. Man o man - if they just could amp this brew up a bit and make each ingredient pop a little more it could be a great brew. Seems flat, uninspiring, and bland."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This beer goes down easy, and it's tasty too! It's not quite as hoppy as advertised IMO though. Not sure how old this can was, but it's definitely good."
"The beer had a lighter feel, good carbonation, smooth and very easy to drink. Overall, one of the better APA's that I have had and one that I will go to again."
"My go-to beer in a can. Not overpowering or impressive in anyway, but a great american pale ale none the less. A great beer for those looking to expand their palate from the big 3."
"Orange-Copper, with a thick frothy head. Very cloudy and lots of lacing. Plenty of citrus mixes with pine and a hint of light malt in the aroma. Both the flavor and the aroma are more reminiscent of an IPA, but not exactly. At first the beer seems rather light bodied, with a quick rush of acidic citrus, earthy pine and floral hops. A subdued malty sweetness then joins in, but then is once very hoppy. The flavors are excellent and the there is a slightly dry and yet someone creamy finish. A great beer, but alittle high in ABV for a pale ale. Also it's a bit hoppier than most would expect from the style, but it's not exactly an IPA either. A very good beer that doesn't need to be classified by any particular style."
"The CPJ"
"A very good one from OB. My Alabama friends are baffled that such tastes came from a can! Keep it up Oskar Blues."
"Had a can of this last night at Little Big Burger in Portland, OR. I was surprised to find that it was a very good beer, especially for beer in a can. It's hoppy, but not bitter at all, and has a sweet finish- all in all it's a very well balanced beer and is very drinkable. At 6.5% abv it's got a nice kick and would be a great session beer, considering the can."
"D: Very drinkable, I would love to bring these out on the golf course. Great flavor, but the alcohol is a little high to session more than a couple or three."
"LOVE the screen on the back of the can, so CO!! A quality brew for sure, I would and will drink it again... but this brew has a lot of canned competition in the Rocky Mountain west. An all around contender for sure."
"Pours a bright orange colour with a finger of thick white head. As the head dissipates, some lacing on the glass. Nice citrus hops with a very nice bready-caramel malt balance. Some bitterness in the flavour, nice sweetness to the beer. Very balanced pale ale, this could easily be an everyday or dinner beer. Smooth mouthfeel."
" A good if not great session beer, understandable why Dales has become the standard for canned craft."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This Pale Ale is one of the best I've had. The smell gets you right from get go and sucks you into this experience that will not soon be forgotten. Not as good as Burning River Pale Ale, but more readily available for me, which is a win in my books."
"A very drinkable Pale, not very sessionable, but then again session beers and packing it in don't really match. Well done."
"Pretty hop forward for a Pale Ale which is fine with me. Good flavors. Would have liked to have less carbonation."
"Notes: This one is a straight forward American Pale Ale with a good hop bitterness to it. Cheers."
"A dry finish with a bitter aftertaste."
"I edit this review after my fourth Dale's Pale Ale because, man, this really is one of the most drinkable beers I've had in a long time. Fantastic."
"iv'e been on a pale ale kick lately, and this is the first time iv'e tried dale's. it's really good, but i don't know if it 10.99/6pk good... beer geeks love this stuff, is it cause for a pale ale it'll kick your ass? is this an imperial PA? is it an esb? whatever, the nose is not super amazing, but the balance is. what makes this not an ipa is, how quickly the malts roll under the hops when you take a sip. the buttery malt swirls with the hops in your mouth just right. it's hard to get such a nice balance at 6.5. this is a well thought out pale ale. if you ask me, i'd call this an esb."
"Pretty good pale ale, it seemed more along the lines of an IPA to me due to the strength of some of the flavors. I wouldn't mind having this again."
"Very bitter right from the start, I wasnt expecting that. I dont ususally drink from cans but I had to try this. Ten bucks for a six pack of cans seems a bit steep especially since there isnt too much special about this beer. But after the first one went down it wasnt as bitter as the first, add a frosty mug and your good to go."
"Great drink ability. A rather hoppy pale, and I really like em that way. For me, ya can't go wrong with a can of Dale's."
"Drinkability is very good. Cans make it more portable than many good craft beers. This one is a winner."
"D - good stuff -- a go-to canned beer; packs some kick, so drink in moderation (but doesn't command the respect of Gordon); very pleasant"
"Poured into my FW pint glass from the can. Instant beautiful white head about one finger high that recedes to good lacing around the glass and a thin white ring. Color is golden to a slight orange that you can see all the way through. Looks like a damn good APA or IPA (depending on how you consider your IPAs). Smells of fresh resinous and piney hops, not much in the way of citrus or anything of that sort. Some sweet malt and grainy barley characteristics also show through to balance the nose. Upfront is more bitterness than i had expected, this leads me to feel that this is more of an IPA then an APA as the hops seem to weight a bit more heavily in my mouth and in the after taste. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing and makes me immediately want another one. This beer is pretty drinkable and at 6.5 percent, i could probably go all night with them. I was impressed with this brew as i don't shoot to hard to get pale ales compared to the other available brews around."
"D-hmmm this is good the whole way through. it goes down so quickly. this is the first APA that i truly enjoyed! I'll be telling my friends about this one!"
"Overall this was a very enjoyable beer, a good balance of flavors and a twist of peach to make this one unique."
"D - This is my favorite 'drinkable' beer. It's my favorite session beer, all around a very solid choice."
"Using A)S)T)M)D) helps me think about a beer but I'm getting to the point where I might stop using it and I might comment less on the drinkability."
"D- pretty goof if your an IPA drinker or a Pale ale drinker try it out"
"D - an easily drinkable APA and a good representation of the style."
"Great go to pale"
"O - A tasty pale ale. I love that it's in a can. I can take this beer to the park or to the beach with no problem at all. It's well rounded and a pleasure to drink."
"A friend I play cards with brought these about a month ago and convinced me to try one. Glad I did. I have since had Ol' Chub and Ten Fidy."
"very drinkable. great hoppy bitter pale in a can ready to go. Also great on tap. Deviant Dale's is even better."
"Overall a very easy drinking beer and it is very solid if you can get it fresh. I've had it when I bought it from somewhere that doesn't rotate their stock enough and it's not very good but fresh this beer is great. It's pretty cool to be able to review this beer on tap from my own set up at my buddies house."
"D: Mellow, smooth, and easily consumable."
"Drinkability is very high. This is a very good beer and it's in a can!"
"Light golden yellow pour with an off-white head. Malty aroma with a nice presnce of hops to go along with it. The flavor is good, just like the aroma, malt and hops. It leaves a nice pleasant aftertaste in your mouth. The glass ended up having some nice lacing on it. Tasty."
"Overall, a decent APA but nothing special. There are definitely much better APAs out there so I wouldn't search this one out and I'd probably go with something else most of the time."
"Pours a nice farily clear pale golden color. A modest half finger white head. Initial smell is a good amount of canibus. Then some citrus, maybe some rubber band. Taste is initialy neutral, then to some sweetness, quite a bit of earthiness, some canibus again in the taste. Some lingering earthy bitterness on the finish. Quite complex overall. Medium bodied, medium carbing. Goes down fairly well. $1.75 a single."
"D: Very drinkable, but the higher than most pale ales' abv might take its toll... as will the resiny hoppiness of this brew. 65 IBUs... wow - pretty big for a pale ale."
"This is a very easy drink. I could go all evening with this brew. Its ABV isn't to high, so almost anyone can enjoy. Its as big as a pale ale can be, while still being a pale ale. Another great brew by Oskar Blues and Brewery. I am looking forward to trying more from this brewery."
"D: very easy drinking beer. I could definitely drink many of these (especially with the cans). that is, if I wanted too..."
"Overall impression: Solid pale ale in spite of the distracting booziness."
"While they finished the deed, I readied the cans for the Great Consumption. They arrived back at the training site and were greeted with a pair of cracks. Mmm, straight out the can. Proper serving vessel, if you ask me. Too bitter for my man Nate, but Jeannette crushed the other can while I finished mine, savoring the floral and citrus, the brush of grainy malt and the bitter spine. A damn fine brew and the perfect time for a safety break."
"D: a decent pale ale, nothing more or less."
"D: Considering smell, taste, and mouthfeel, this glass wasn't particularly enjoyable. At least I could spend the first 8 ounces trying to decide if it really was butter I was smelling... Not particularly recommended, though based on the large number of positive reviews here, it may be worth checking out."
"This one is basic, buy it for times when you are not really interested in focusing on the beer, and value drinkability over depth of flavors. A solid basic middle of the road pale ale that has it's place. I'll buy more again for events, just not for home drinking/relaxing."
"Overall, a decent beer for the price, but don't expect to be blown away or this beer to push any envelopes."
"D: A beer you could have 3-4 of and not blink an eye. Although not a true session beer due to the ABV being above 5%, but I could see drinking these one after another."
"Froth turns to a dusting of white lace all the way down; bright copper color has a nice sparkle in the light. Quick nose blitz of citric and pine from the hops, with some maltiness and fruit in the back. Smoothness drops on the palate quickly, and then the other shoe drops with a crest of hops that rides strong with bitterness and citric, earthy, mint and pine flavors that push hard against a bready caramel malt. Alcohol kicks in late with some warmth and fruitiness. Blurring the lines of Pale Ale and IPA. Such an amazing canned beer."
"Pours a bright, tarnished bronze color. Pour produces a fingers worth of off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves some light lacing. Nose is a bit faint, some light malts and fruity hops. Taste is not so faint. Sweet malts up front, then some (american?) hops that tangle well with a grainy finish. A bit hoppy for an APA, though that is my preference it might not be for everyone. Light to medium bodied and a bit heavy on the carbonation, but not overdone. Might not be my new go to but I will definitely be drinking this again at some point."
"Surprised by the English ale characteristics of this very enjoyable canned beer - with its autumnal amber, cloudy/unfiltered posture and compact, almost cask-like creamy/foamy off-white head and thick bands of lace, and its relaxed smooth, quasi-viscous malty body - this thing drinks similar to a British cask ale (sulfates added?). Could be the malts but wouldn't be shocked if the hops have much to do with the sugar-sweetness in the smell, backed up and perhaps surpassed by the fruit-punch juicy hops. A toasted bent to the light malt flavor and a bit nutty in the back but, once again, the hops rule here - only marginally bitter - a predominantly orange citrus tone throughout, but finishes decidedly lemony. Such a pleasure to drink with only a trace of carb sizzle, in spite of a few hearty braps. Happy that the level/potency of hops didn't detract from indulging in a good swill or two, however, considering the English-cask feel, I'd be curious to try this with the hops toned down a tad. A pleasant PA indeed."
"Notes: still a go-to when I'm looking for something a bit ""lighter"" on-tap. At $3 a pint at Tryst, why not?"
"Drink ability is really nice on this. Light body makes it very drinkable despite the decent amount of ABV with a 6.5. If this was on tap at my local bar, I'd stick with it."
"Overall this is a solid pale ale that doesn't try to push the envelope. It's a well balanced mellow brew that would be perfect for a light session or pairing with poultry."
"I've always liked Dale's and I like the on-tap version even better."
"D-Great Pale ale, will definitely enjoy this one again."
"decent beer, not what i look for in an APA but gets the job done."
"Pours a clear orange color with half a finger of white foamy head that clings to the glass nicely as you drink. Aroma is fairly weak but has hints of fruity hops and some malty sweetness. Taste consists of strong fruity hops and a little bit of malt. Mouthfeel is a little harsh but doesnt have any bad aftertastes. Overall a decent pale ale."
"Pours a nice gold color with minimal amounts of spotty head and lacing. Scent brings a pleseant fresh grassy and citrus hop profile, touch of pine and noticeable clean malts. Taste follows scent, the hops are fairly firm and aggressive for the style, more grass and pine, touch of citrus, malt is clean and not overly sweet, some charachteristics of straw. Medium bodied, higher carbonation but minimal head. A nice, flavorful Pale Ale right up with Sierra in terms of construction."
"D- pretty good this beer overall reminds me of SNPA"
"A good beer with no qualities that really stand out to me. Perfect choice to go with if you feel like downing a six-pack and watching some football"
"12oz can. Pours a light amber color with a small head. Some lacing. Aromas of hops, sweet caramel, and grains. Taste is somewhat sweet. Mild hop bitterness upfront followed by bread and caramel flavors. Slight bitter aftertaste. Overall this is a pretty good Pale Ale with a lot of flavor to it. Drinkable and tasty. Worth buying again."
"D: It nice and drinkable, it wouldn't necessarily be my first choice, but I still enjoyed it."
"D: All day kind of beer right here. This is pretty much what it would taste like if you actually tapped the rockies."
"Pours a golden color, with a smallish head and decent lacing. Aroma is of citric hops, with some faint malt and fruit, very hoppy. Hop bitterness hits the palate first, and comes through again in the finish, taste is almost completely floral hops, malts try to poke through but get smashed back down by the hops. Decent mouthfeel, pops around in the mouth, a lighter medium body. The perfect level of bitterness coupled with the body makes this one very easily drinkable."
"D: goes down smooth and fast for 6.5. great beer. especially to have on draught at home:)"
"D: A bit hefty as a pale. But then I think they market more to the west coast. With its caramelly malts, relatively rich body, higher abv, and bordering on aggressive hops this is distinctly strong APA style pale - even trending toward IPA territory. Many Pales are total session beers. This one is sort of heading in the other direction. All said and done, it is very good though."
"Also, i drank this out of a glass and must admit, its better straight out of the can. I think you lose some carbination and overall yeast and hop flavor by pouring into glass."
"This is one of my go-to beers for just sitting around drinking or to pair with spicy foods. It's versatile and delicious; highly recommended."
"D--Great. This beer is a sessionable beer. I could drink this all night. Perfect for a hot day in Miami. I imagine that this is perfect with a good, juicy burger or so. If you haven't tried it, do it now."
"D - Nice and drinkable APA. Nothing to wild going on but a good solid thirst quenching brew."
"Pours a flat medium amber color with a with a big, frothy, off-white head. Aromas of floral/citric hops. On the palate, light and refreshing at first, although the sweetness begins to bog this one down about halfway through. Hoppy and good, but..."
"This beer would probably be enjoyed more if I didn't have it from a can"
"Color is pale with good, but a little fizzy, head. Aroma is hoppy . Not like Sierra Nevada but pretty good hops none the less. The flavor is a little bitter but in general a good clean and complex flavor."
"I knew from the get-go it was going to be hard for this pale ale to live up to all it's hype. But I was pleasantly surprised with the good pour and crisp aroma of hops, citrus, honey, and earthy tones. Light body with good balance of carbonation, hops, and citrus."
"D-okay beer. I think there are better ones out there for sure. I don't think I would go for this on a regular basis but I might camp with it. Not very complex but thirst quenching."
"Drink - I really enjoyed this beer and I plan on drinking a lot more if it. I also want to try the rest of this brewers lineup for sure. Worth seeking out."
"medium bodied mouthfeel, carbonation a little on the low side. given my underwhelmed response to this beer i'm obviously not going to consider it hugely drinkable. not terrible by any means, just not my particular cup of tea."
"Nice beer - my roommates are raving about it, but I am not as impressed as them."
"D- Very drinkable. Good solid go-to beer."
"D. First beer on a post-exam night and it tastes great! This is a great looking a tasting pale ale that I'll pick up again if I see it."
"The drinkability is high, mostly because this is one of the two or three go-to beers for lugging along to a summer bbq or camping trip. Despite the ABV, 4 or 5 of these go down easy, and the flavor is awesome and just mild enough to session."
"D One of the best beers you'll have from a can. 4.0"
"Overall a nice surprise out of the can. Hops are big and smooth creamy malts balance well, sweet notes take back seat. Alcohol presense gave it more of a dipa feel. worth a try!"
"Pours a nice light copper color with a white head and pretty good lacing. The nose is straight citrus and floral hops with only a bit of light bread in the background. The taste isn't quite as hoppy and has a mild malty character. Good body with a bit of dryness and nice carbonation. Drinks quite well and is a great all around beer. In fact, one through which I've introduced quite a few people to craft."
"This beer has a perfect weight and feel in the mouth. What I'd call a ""soft"" bitternes coats the palate. A very smooth finish and a delicious hoppy taste. This beer has just the right amount of bitterness and gets better the more you drink it. It's just what you'd want from an American Pale Ale."
"This is my first canned craft beer, and won't be my last. The can is a great way to store beer, and I just wish more craft brewers would use it. I mean, come on. In terms of space taken up, you can fit two cans where one bottle goes. We all pour into glasses anyway. Bring on the cans!"
"An easy to drink beer, not a pale ale, but pretty boring."
"It pours up thick for a Pale Ale, reddish orange hue with a good 2 finger sticky head, smells of citrus and crisp. Mouth feel is a good medium body not to thick and def not thin. Its a bit hoppier than most Pale Ales so that may be why i enjoy it so much. All in all one of my favorite beers to drink."
"Overall: Not sure what took me so long to try Dales Pale Ale. It's an awesome beer and it just happens to be on a can. I'll definitely be drinking this more often."
"D: one of the most sessionable beers around. Great balance, hopped to perfection, nothing showy or flashy just straight up good."
"Drinkability is quite good. On my first sip of this beer, it seems too thick and syrupy for me to want more than one. But by the time I'm halfway through, I'm enjoying the hop flavors a lot and it goes down easily. I think I just expect a more carbonated, crisper beer since it comes from a can. I suppose there are better hoppy beers for a cheap price around here, though."
"Overall its a decent beer."
"D - I like Dale's, but this bitter lemon rindy thing going on is making we want to switch what I'm drinking. Bottom line: if you like a hoppier/more-bitter-than-normal pale, this is for you."
"D. Not a bad choice. The can made me curious and I was not dissapointed. Very well rounded, as much as possible, apa."
"great beer especially that it comes in a can>>>>to me it tasted like a more hopped up version of sweetwater 420>>>>i think the can preserves the taste>>>>the malt character was great>>>def. had great hop presence as well"
"The lively carbonation and light to medium body make this a really bright beer, but with outstanding aromatics and flavor."
"Oskar Blues, your in the winners seat."
"Pours a slightly hazy, golden copper body with a finger-width, dense, white head that dissipates slowly and remains nicely laced. Aroma is loaded with sweet, citrus hops. Big, rich malt profile as well. Flavor is similar. Lots of floral citrus hops and caramels. Light toasted caramel comes through in the finish. Lingering taste of resiny, moderate pine and citrus. Very fresh tasting. Palate is medium bodied and extremely well balanced. Overall, this is what an APA should taste like. Fantastic."
"Pours a nice light orange/amber with a one finger off-white head. Solid lacing and retention. Good citrus aroma. Good hops in this APA. Sweet grapefruit and orange hops to start. A little bready and caramel malt thrown in next before a grassy and piney hop finish. Good flavor. Sweetness balances out the intense hop profile for an APA."
"Super drinkable and one of my favorites of the style. This also bears the distinction of being the first canned craft beer that I ever drank. I am pretty sure this might be the best camping beer ever, though I reserve the right to change that assertion after I get my hands on some Surley."
"Not a bad beer, not just one that I personally love, good for those who love their very hoppy beer."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of off-white head. This beer is sunset gold in color. The aroma is malt and citrus hops. The taste is loaded with citrus hops and has a solid malt core. The citrus fades to a mildly bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. This is a good everyday drinker. This is more citrusy than other pale ales I've had. I like it."
"I feel as I should be drinking this from an aluminum cup in order to preserve the can experience."
"Solid APA, very close to an IPA in my book."
"A good stand by to have in the fridge."
"This would be one great little beer if only it weren't so high in ABV. Think about it, its in cans so you can carry it to sporting events, the pool, hiking, etc. Who wants to get that drunk while doing physical activities? That said, the taste and aroma is terrific, The hopiness spot on. I think this should be labeled an IPA instead of Pale Ale."
"Carbonation and mouthfeel are excellent. I'd definitely drink this again - clearly one of the better pale ales I've had."
"Drinkability: For a hop lover easy drinking, enjoyable. Back to back pounding is encouraged. Understandably not everyone wants to drink a 12rack of hoppy beer. Something I plan on having at my house often for Steelers games or a night cap. If hops aint your thing then look elsewhere for a daily drinker."
"Great beer. One I come back to on the reg. Splitting a sixer with my dad tonight. This first one, I'm drinking with some Stacy's pita chips and hummus. Nice balance. The second two will be at dinner: Baby green salad with cranberries, feta and walnuts. Fellas, don't knock it 'til ya try it. Chicken breasts off the grill and sweet potato fries for the main dish. A hearty meal with a hearty, complimentary beer. Dale's Pale Ale: Phenomenal!"
"12 ounce can as part of my GABF Denver haul. I could be wrong but I believe Dale's Pale Ale was one of, if not the, first craft canned beer. Pours a reddish hue, with a small fizzy head about a half inch tall. Some lacing on this one. Aroma is a nice balance of citrus and pine hops with caramel malt sweetness. It could be a little stronger, but that could be my nose and not necessarily a flaw. Light syrupy body, good carbonation, better bitterness. Huge caramel toffee malt sweetness is present in this one. This is quite good. Buckets of resinous hops coat the mouth, leaving behind a sticky residue. Malt sweetness chases the hops down the back of the throat. They can't get rid of the lingering hop bitterness though. I got this can of Dale's about two weeks ago, so it's a bit old and I'm sure the hop character would be even more pronounced had I drank it sooner. Still it's a very solid example of the Pale Ale style and quite enjoyable. I could drink about 3 or 4 of these on a night and go home happy."
"Of the APA's I've had, this is one of the best because I love the malt character it has without sacrificing the hops. Almost like a lighter version of DFH 90 minute."
"Reviewed from my notes. Served on cask at the Sebago Brewpub in Scarborough, ME as part of their Full Moon Cask Night. This review is based off of a half-pint pour. The beer is colored light copper with orange notes. There is a big off-white soapy head. As it settles, there is decent patchy lace. It has a warm hoppy aroma that is both earthy and citrus-like. I taste light malts at first, but the big hops come in quickly. They are oily and bitter. It has a great pale ale flavor. The beer is served at cellar temperature, which I think helps it a lot. I wouldn't want this one too cold. It possesses a medium body and low carbonation. A small coat is left on my tongue. It's a very drinkable beer. This is my second glass of the evening. It's smooth and a little creamy. I would definitely have this beer again."
"Moderate carbonation and a thick, smooth mouthfeel. Caramel sweetness and grapefruit hops dominate with a long, pleasantly bitter and tangy finish. If you'd told me this was an IPA I wouldn't have batted an eye. Whatever the classification, this brew is flavorful and easy-drinking."
"Overall- This is one of my favorite pale ales. I appreciate how balanced it is. Pretty much the standard I hold all pale ales too. It's awesome to have cans. I take this to any outdoor endeavor and there's nothing better than sipping a Dale's in the wilderness."
"I don't really revel in the taste of the beer, its good, but not excellent on my pallate. The best thing about this beer is that it's pretty much clear of imperfections. Which is seemingly even more amazing considering the negative stereotypes about beer in a can. Overall impressive, but nothing to rage about in my book."
"Salud!"
"Dale's hasn't been something I've sought out, but I'm tempted to try it in their typical can form now after being impressed by their limited cask offering."
"Really smooth and sessionable, this is a great beer to take hiking or to the beach and it may throw a few people for a loop when they taste how good canned beer can be."
"A little too sharply hopped to rank it among the best in the style for drinkability, but it's a darn good beer overall."
"Not quite sure what a ""rocky mountain pale ale"" is, but apparently this is one. 6.5% abv makes me think it's not a shy beer by any means. Barely heard a sound when I opened the can, which made me think it may have been flat, but it produced a small froth. Poured from the can it has a nice white head on it that slowly shrinks down leaving minimal lacing. Not much stuck to the glass beyond the initial layer, actually. Honey colored. Hint of dry crackers in the aroma. Balanced aroma of some grain and hops. Tastes hoppier than it smells. Seems a bit off balance to me, though I'm admittedly not a hophead. Light bodied, with low to moderate carbonation. This is something I probably couldn't make a session out of, but sometimes I'm looking for that lasting hop flavor. It really has more hop flavor than actual bitterness. Late hopping could be the reason. My biggest issue is the discrepancy between balance in flavor and aroma. Decent beer."
"Medium bodied, smooth, nice carbonation. This is a very easy beer to drink. I will need to pick this up more often."
"D- really drinkable, really good beer. And because its in a can, perfect for tailgating. New favorite pale ale"
"D - Very drinkable, I always grab a Sixer of this when I go fishing."
"It is bitter up front, yet smoothe in the back. There is a lingering citrus bitterness - a nice taste, but not as good on the mouthfeel."
"I could still drink this all day and into the night. One of my favs."
"Drinkability: super tasty and enjoyable. Man, I could drink this beer all the time. There are few pale ales I enjoy this much ... other pales pale before Dale's!"
"I dig it. i dig OB, too. my thinking is this if canning saves them so much cash on their end, then why as consumers as we paying in at such a high price point?"
"Overall I'd say that for camping or other outdoor activities there's no contest - this is number one. Its a frontrunner in other contexts too. My only hang-up is that the grocery store wanted 10$ for a sixer. Knock off two or three bucks, and this might just be my pale ale of choice (I'd have to reserve judgement on that until I try this back to back with Stone Pale)."
"Drinkability is good too. The best thing about this beer is the can it comes in. If you are going somewhere you can't take a bottle, I always go looking for a sixer of Dale's."
"Notes: It seems Dale's has kept this creation in a can to make it unique, and that it is. In fact it might be ""the king of cans"". But still, it might lie in that no man's land where it's an above average beer- but not quite good enough to justify the price. Two dollars cheaper a 6-pack I might make an evening of it."
"MF/D: mildly heavy on the feel but an excellent session beer, no problem finishing a 6-pk with friends."
"It is always fun drinking a solid beer out of a can. A perfect camping beer for someone who wants a decent beer while conserving space."
"D - Yes please. Upset I only have one more can. Tasty and wonderful."
"Pretty orange color with little, but nice head. Left some great lacing. Nose and taste were both all grapefruity hop fantasticness for me. There is definitely a caramel sweetness in the malt, but it finishes dry and hoppy, and that is definitely the way I would have to characterize this one. As far as I'm concerned, this is an IPA, but I guess Dale's India Pale Ale doesn't have the same ring to it. In fact, it's bitter hoppiness is enough to make me only want a couple Dale's in one sitting. Great stuff from Oskar Blues, as almost all of their brews are, but I wish they could cut the prices a bit! Still, a phenomenal beer worth the money and definitely one with a cult following."
"Pours from the 12 oz. can a light copper color with a one finger white head that settles into a thick collar. Lively carbonation, but not over-carbonated. Aroma is nicely balanced...doughy malt with a light touch of hops. 1st sip brings a mighty wallop of pine-y, grapefruit-y hops with a slight hint of bready, slightly sweet malt to provide balance. The flavor is sort of opposite of the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and falls right down the middle, not heavy or watery. The bitter hops coat the tongue for a good while after the swallow, and there's a nice lacing on the inside of the glass. Drinkability is quite good, I see no problem with sessioning these during the upcoming football season! Overall, a fine APA, quite worthy of the praise & recognition it has received! Oskar Blues is quickly making its way onto my list of favorite breweries!!!"
"D - I could drink this every day if I didn't appreciate the variety of all the other good beer in the world, even if I was only drinking Oskar Blues."
"In terms of drinkability, I would peg this as one of the best tasting and sessionable pale ales out there. At 6.5 abv, it's no slouch, but one could easily put away a few of these, just because it's such a pleasure to drink."
"Have re-tried several times, and every time I like the beer even more. Flavors blend quite well. Easy to drink but still hoppy and bold. One of the best canned brews."
"This is a big APA. Its one of my favs, but I think if you scoring based on style it takes a few hits. Its probably much closer to an IPA, but even then I wouldn't score it through the roof. Balanced...maybe too much so. This would be close to perfect if the malt dialed back a bit."
"Great, sessionable beer that might be the best APA I've ever had the pleasure of drinking."
"Score: 9/10. Dale's is one of my go-to beers. Pairs decent with most foods and activities. Usually fairly priced. One of my favorites."
"Overall not great - gotta try it again though to confirm that nose to be fair."
"Pours a light amber body with a big white head that leaves moderate lacing. Smells sweet and nutty but with a big resin and grapefruit hop presence, borders on an IPA smell. Taste is much like the nose. Oily and drying mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Lingering malts with a piney taste in the aftertaste too. Easy to drink, and pretty tasty too, but it loses points for being a bit too drying in my opinion. Regardless, I'm pretty satisfied and wouldn't hesitate to buy this again if I saw it and wanted a pale ale."
"Edit: I wanted to revisit this review. Slightly bumped up nose an taste. After going through a couple sixes of Dale's this Summer, I really came to love it. Great out of the can. Perfect compromise beer taste wise. Just damn good. May knock Sierra out if 1st for my favorite US pale ale. That's something!"
"Drinkability is variable on this one. As some one who appreciates portable canned beer I've developed a Dale's Pale drinkability scale. +5 when drinking in a canoe. +4 on a beach. +3.5 if on a porch. +1 if watching football/hockey, +2 if your team wins. 0 if after a long run. It's a work in progress."
"D - Well, having a hop bomb in a can with some malt character is good by me. I've taken a few of these on a long summer hike in the woods and cooled them off in the stream for an end-of-day treat. Works for me."
"D- Nothing offensive but nbot much reason to return in my opinion other than the can factor."
"Not sure why it took me song long to get to this one."
"Pours a clear copper color with a one-finger off-white head. The head recedes into a patchy layer on top leaving decent lacing. Smells of lightly toasted and rustic pale malts with floral hops and hints of buttery diacetyl. Tastes similar to how it smells. Pale malts that have a certain graininess in the flavor are joined by herbal and mild citrus hop flavors midway through the sip. As the beer warms the same butteriness that is exhibited in the smell enters the flavor profile however it's not intense enough to be debilitating and may even help pull the flavors together. The ending is mildly bitter."
"Overall, Dale's is a winner. If you haven't tried it and your an IPA kind of person - dale's is not far from an IPA - you need to give it a try. It's definitely one of my favorite APA's (however, I wouldn't say it's too high up there)."
"Ah, Dales Pale Ale...I was introduced to this beer about 6 years ago at the BrewGrass Festival in Asheville, NC and it quickly became one of my all time favorite pale ales. I love that it comes in a can. Makes it very easy to take great beer with you to the beach, the lake, camping, roadtrips...you name it. This is an extremely drinkable beer, which can get you in trouble with the 6.5% ABV. The hops could be a little more present in the aroma, but the taste makes up for that. I like the sweetness that comes through as well. Very well balanced. This is just one of the great offerings from Oskar Blues and a beer that should be sought out by all who enjoy this style."
"Mouthfeel is quite good as well. Crisp carbonation makes the creamy, medium body feel light and finish clean. Overall, this is quite good. Just not a knockout punch."
"D- Just finished my 3rd and looking at my 4th, really easy to drink as long as you love west coast IPA's you should enjoy this sessionable beer."
"Beer is smooth with a lot of late bitterness and a mild grainy aftertaste. Its kind of sweet up front. It finishes nicely but overall its too sweet for me."
"D'ability - Pretty high if a hop lover. Hop character is strong, but the beer is clean and not overpowering. The 6.5% ABV surprises me slightly - didn't realize this while drinking it."
"This is one of my favorite go-to beers. It is a very good representation of the APA category."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Cloudy golden amber with a low head. Opens up with a scent of hops, honey, and oranges, and tastes about the same. Lighter flavor than expected based on smell. Taste doesn't linger on for too long, pairing it nicely with whatever is for dinner. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. For some reason when I drink it I really want bacon and cheddar. Just sayin."
"D - Great balance and clean flavors provide for an extremely drinkable brew. My only wish is that the ABV were a tad lower"
"D - This reminds me more of an actual IPA than a pale. Well balanced with great range of flavors packed into this can."
"drinkability: very pleasant APA with dynamic flavor, not particurlarly strong in any area, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: Not necessarily my first choice in this style but by no means a bad beer; a nice beer for an outdoor occasion but by no means a go to."
"D-this brew is now my favorite APA.."
"Not one to jump up and down about imho but a nice brew. Haven't had a bad Oskar Blues yet."
"Great mouthfeel. Fairly thin to make it easy to drink, but by no means watery. High carbonation makes it feel thicker & richer than it is so it isn't filling. Very easy to drink beer that goes down very easily. Nice beer."
"Awesome stuff from OB here - DPA is almost a pale ale in name only in certain respects, as the huge flavor and almost overdose of hops create a pretty unique brew. Once again, it's tough to miss with OB."
"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this before, since I've had plenty over the past couple of years. Pours a hazy deep orange with a short, but persistent, cap of eggshell bubbles - mostly fine, yet a few soapy ones are scattered around. Thick, sticky lace. Big citrus in the aroma, grapefruit and oranges, sugary and juicy, slightly sharp, cotton candy. Moderate bitterness, not as assertive as some bigger pale ales. Malt plays more of a role in the flavour, giving it a grainy edge with some caramel and toasty sweetness. Hops remained citrusy, but were much more restrained than in the aroma. Lingering dry bitterness with an herbal and grassy edge. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation, nice texture. Solid overall. The aroma is a little more impressive than the flavour, but it all holds together nicely. Cantacular!"
"D: Highly drinkable, and the can makes it drinkable everywhere you can't take a bottle."
"More, please! (Lucky I have half a box left)"
"Overall this is a very flavorful pale ale that is a bit different than many American examples of the style. I found it to be quite smooth and would like to drink it again."
"It's almost unfair to compare this to other pale ales out there. It's bigger in almost every sense and hopheads are sure to put this a notch above the likes of Sierra Nevada, Full Sail, and some of the other standard APAs. I am choosing to rate it as something between an APA and IPA, and as such it is still a damn fine beer. Now, if only we could get this in Oklahoma..."
"D - Easy going down and enjoyable, this one is a tasty pale ale that one can enjoy for a whole evening."
"I was surprised to see this guy on tap in a city that's not very micro-friendly. Would like to have on-tap and from-can side by side."
"D- Dale's Pale Ale is an incredible brew. While it not only exemplifies the american version of a pale ale... the brew also capitalizes on being a drinkable brew. The hopped up flavor is not only notable... it also is tastyy enough to keep going down. The can is a novelty and I believe Oskar Blues has become the first mover in a canned movement of craft that is about to blow up!"
"Summary: I was able to buy a sixer of this one. It is a very tasty ale. I will buy this one again if I get the chance."
"P.S.: I dont think I had the budget for an award but you get the idea."
"A big American pale ale. Not my favorite, but I'd rank it pretty high in the pantheon. I'd say it lives up to the hype."
"This is a rich and delicious brew."
"D: This might not be the most complex or best example of an APA but this drinks so well. I had two in about 10 minutes. I'm ashamed of myself."
"Overall-solid solid solid beer, one of the best from a can I've had. Like the hops and the flavor"
"Drikability- This was a really good pale ale. I enjoyed it immensely. I need to get my hands on more of it."
"Thanks to jgasparine for this brew! 12 ounce can, canned on 3/17/2010. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is pretty good, and there is lots of lacing left on the glass after drinking this brew. Aroma is pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops. Taste is mostly pine and citrusy hops, along with some sweet and bready malt. There's also a little bit of a lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. Too bad this isn't available in Ohio, because I'd buy it whenever I was in the mood for an APA if it was. I've heard good things about this brew for years now, and I wasn't disappointed in it at all!"
"Poured a copper orange with a slight haze and a light yellowish head that maintains a thin cap. Wet lacings on the glass. Mild floral orange aroma, but not citrusy. Buttery aromas and feel. Well balanced malt and hop flavor, with neither overtaking the other and delayed hoppy finish that doesn't linger. Very smooth and nicely carbonated."
"Overall - Very nice beer. I'll keep an eye out for it in OH and will buy again."
"D: not my first choice for a pale ale, i look for something that finishes crisp and dry,"
"Appearance is very typical of the style. Pale copper/orange color with a soapy head that sticks. Has a nice fresh nose to it. Lots of bright citrus scents that smell very refreshing. Taste is dominated by grapefruit flavour from the hops leaving very little room for the malts or any other depth of flavor. Still pretty tasty though. Perhaps leaning more towards the IPA spectrum in flavour and strength. A solid pale ale and a worthy choice."
"This is the epitome of a pale ale. It is well balanced with a slight lean to the hops portion. It seems to be somewhere between a pale ale and an IPA. It is highly drinkable, and with an ABV of 6.5...can get you in trouble quickly if your not careful. The mouth feel is right with the drinkability with enough boldness to make it substantial, yet not overwhelming so that you can have a few. Oskar Blues has impressed me with their lineup time after time. mmmm CHeers!"
" This is by far not the first time I have sat down to Dale's. To be perfectly honest I drink this one from a can most of the time...Today however I have poured this one into one of my pint glasses. I do from time to time get Dale into a glass but the fact is I enjoy this one near the grill straight from the can. When poured Dale takes a soapy topped head of a near white resting atop of what reminds me of my Grandmother's sun tea. The smell of hops piny, grassy and full of citric delight is much more present when not from the can. The hop bitterness and aromas are aplenty so feel free and drink from the can if you are so inclined by convenience. Caramel and grapefruit combine with ease. Sweet grain reminds you that this is no light pale ale ...this is Dale . The finish is bitter hops with light caramel and grain. The medium body compliments the medium carbonation. This pale ale has America written all over it."
"Drinkability: This beer has quite a personality, very drinkable. A top tier American pale ale."
"Very drinkable. I'm definitely gonna have plenty of this on hand for fourth of July with the red, white and blue color scheme and great drinkability."
"Drinkability - Highly sessionable. Very good. Will buy this in the future."
"***!!!***!!!"
"Good drinker from start to finish. So easy to have another."
"drinkability: overall a great beer and one of the best beers ever made in a can. I love OB!"
"Very smooth beer, this stuff goes down like nectar. medium bodied like an IPA, Perfect beer for summer activities, i wish i would have stocked up on this while on vacation, Oskar Blues needs to distribute to Oklahoma, c'mon we border you."
"It is so great to see canned craft beer in the US as this is a normal thing for BC beer drinkers. Opened up a couple of these watching the waves on the coast on the Olympic Peninsula( poured into plastic glasses). Surprised and happy about the great brewery smell on the nose and the goodly amount of hops used in the beer. Lots of complexity and still great drinkability for a fairly high ABV Pale ale. Much more fragrant beer than say Sierra Nevada and is still a bench mark beer in the rise of canned craft beer"
"Scary drinkability i had no idea the alcohol content was so high on this. Very very sessionable a great brew."
"It's scary that a beer at 6.5% is this smooth, refreshing and sessionable."
"Cheers!"
"This is a very drinkable beer, and though it is nothing outstanding, I am impressed as I was leery to believe a decent beer could be found in cans."
"355 ml can, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.5%. Deep golden to amber colour, big off-white head with an orangey hue. Strong aroma of American hops, fruity notes, hints of pine and marmalade. The flavour has also loads of hops, but they are fairly well balanced with the malts. There is a substantial bitterness in the finish and long aftertaste, with piney and grapefruity notes."
"Wanted to try Dale's Pale Ale after checking BA...Although I was weary of the can, I found my Summer Beer...Much to my surprise, the Beer is extremely drinkable, and is everything that I enjoy in an APA. Good Color, Flavor, Taste and Finish. Every bit as good as any APA served in Bottles."
"12 oz. can. Pours a hazy copper color with a frothy light brown head, good lacing. Aroma is caramel malts, grapefruit, a hint of fruits, and earthy. Flavor is caramel and pale malts, citrus (especially grapefruit), and pine. Mouthfeel is medium, dry, bitter and chalky. Good beer, well balanced."
"i love the drinkability on this one, and the can makes it soo much better. this is such a great beer to bring fisbee golfin, the beach, campin and not look like a beer snob. i recommend this too all, great beer, great can."
"12oz can served in a shaker pint. Poured a hazy dark gold with a thin white head. Starts off with some caramel malt the piney hops in the aroma. Lighter side of medium bodied. Gold malt base with a citrus hop zing. Drying finish from the hops. Solid beer, easy drinking. Another winner from Oskar Blues."
"Quite nice and very drinkable. It's a remarkably full flavored brew with a strong kick. Goes down easier than most 6.5 beers. Voluminously hopped mutha as the can states. It's a bit over priced but a solid staple for a strong flavored beer fan. I particularly appreciate the smooth drinkability that includes a hoppy bite and an appropriately malty finish. I also must mention the cans don't take away from the flavor and add to the experience."
"~if you like this beer and also really like hops, try the ""Gordon"" it is most delicious."
"In the glass, you get to notice the pale orange/copper color and 2 fingers of white head. The lacing is what really impresses me with this beer, like rings on a tree, this beer's lace tells the story of how it was consumed.... The big ring at the start is that first big sip to let the beer overwhelm me and make its mark. The several smaller rings are the ""tasting sips"" in which I played with it a little and tried to concentrate on each individual aspect of the brew. Then there's the spotty midsection in which I got distracted by my 3 year old carrying around a bottle of Dark Lord, and in the time it took to put it away, he stole a sip. So, in his own words, with a giant smile on his face and his eyes lit up like Christmas morning-- ""Mmmm!!"""
"D - Loved this beer, best in a can I have had..very drinkable."
"I've been really impressed with the line-up from Oskar Blues - too bad it is such a pain in the ass for me to obtain these cans in NYC!"
"Drinkability - I could easily have a few of these on a hot summer day. Perfect beer for summer, in or out of the can."
"Overall: Seems like caramel and malt rich IPA without the hopping levels or dry hops. The beer is pretty well balanced for being so big and rich. If you like a sweeter pale ale this is a good one to dry. For me the drinkability suffered some. Still, very tasty."
"This has been an old standby for me over the past few years. I'm very glad that this is widely available here in Mass. OB has done it again!"
"D: Overall, a pale ale that doesn't disappoint. The can makes it taste really fresh, too. In spite of the overt hoppiness, it isn't very bitter. The best aspect of this beer is that it reminds me of the rockies with its cool, dry, outdoorsy qualities."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and can be considered as being sessionable. It's surprisingly hoppy for a pale ale and is rather flavorful."
"Good pale ale with a kick of hops to get you excited. A little more hop and this is an IPA."
"A very solid pale ale from OB."
"The flavor is very much standard APA, but the abv is reaching into IPA. Alcohol isn't apparent, but it dings the drinkability."
"Lacks the crispness of some APA's like, for instance, New Belgium's Mighty Arrow, but another respectable Oskar Blues offering nonetheless. A very pleasing combination of flavor, feel, and drinkability."
"I wish I could buy this by the case and just drink a bunch at a party or something. It's a fun beer. And a bunch of empty cans lying around probably looks awesome too."
"D- Though not remarkable in general, this is something that is easy to down a bunch of."
"Overall, I'll drink this again as an impulse buy, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"D - A solid beer from beginning to end and easily sessionable."
"overall: this thing could be called an IPA its hoppy and has a rather high 6.5 ABV. The beer is not bad but for 7.99-9.00 bucks a sixer I can find beers that I would rather buy and drink, but I am glad I got around to trying my first Oskar Blues beer."
"D: This is definitely a quaffable brew and one of the better pale ales I've had recently."
"D: A well made, drinkable APA."
"Solid brew that's good for anytime, but ideally it's a good summer quencher. Highly recommended to hop heads and fans of APA's in general."
"D: A VERY GOOD Pale Ale. Perhaps my favorite that I've tried thus far. The only thing that would keep me from drinking a whole bunch is availability and the touch of lingering bitterness/dryness. Almost exceptional :P"
"D: I can't say ""sessionable"" considering the ABV, but this is a very drinkable APA. One that I'll want to have in my fridge at any given time, and a beer that I feel could convert some BMC drinkers to quality craft ale...in a can."
"nice amber color, with short creamy off white head, decent retention and lacing. citrus and sweet malt on the nose. It's somewhat bitter on the tongue, but has surprisingly little flavor for how heavy it is. It's a drinkable beer, but I can't say I'd buy it again or that I'm particularly stoked about the remaining 5 cans. Maybe my opinion will change after a couple more..."
"Amber color, short-lived head and lacing. Very faint smell, light malt and bitter hops, though the smell is very weak for the style. Bitter hops dominate the taste with a with a bit of lighter malt to balance it out, but the taste is primarily hoppy, and a very nice hop taste. Hop taste is a combination of moderate carbonation and bitter hops, both combining effects while remaining smooth and drinkable. The almost overwhelming hop presence without having a strong, lasting aftertaste of the hops allows it to be drinkable, although not as much as it would be if it were a bit less hoppy. Great beer if you are in the mood for hops, but a bit one-dimensional otherwise."
"Very Drinkable. Not too exciting, but it's still one that I could drink a few of."
"D - nicely balanced pale ale. I was expecting a little bit more hop intensity but it is very nicely balanced and very flavorful."
"Overall= The best APA that I have ever had . If you have not gotten a chance to have Dale's or any other OB then you need to seek it out a great beer for cold late nights, hot mountain bike rides, anything."
"Easy drinking pale. A bit high on the ABV to session, but still good stuff."
"I would definitely recommend this."
"Drinkability is good, I love the bitter hops out of a can. This is a great beer and never thought I would be able to taste a hoppy beer like this out of a can. its too bad I live in Louisiana, and I got this in TX, I would drink this more often."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops. Taste is like it smells, quite a hop bomb. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall a pretty decent brew, however just a little to hoppy for my taste."
"F: FInishes pretty dry and plenty bitter. Lingering spicy hops combine with a slight pine and citrus as well as some earthy chewy hop flavors that stick around for a while. The bitterness builds a bit but doesn't get overwhelming. Overall a very nice drinking beer, on the bitter side, but still lighter for a good summer drink."
"Mouth/Drink: Mouth is decent with the mild carbonation. It was actually kind of difficult to finish the whole sixer. There's something a bit off here."
"D - This is a solid sessionable APA, that is not watery and has a good taste balance and a pretty unnoticeable alcohol content."
"D- Good. Subdued hops, wonderful balance and a great malt backdrop, this is certainly a sessionable beer. Just watch it's higher 6.5% ABV."
"D: I will most definitely be picking more of these up."
"Overall - Not a bad pale ale, but definitely not one that I feel is a top five. I would drink again, but probably would not go out of my way to find. If there was slightly less bitterness and more in the aroma from the hops, this one could be great."
"A really nice pale ale, bordering on being an IPA. I really like the hop combo used in this beer, very juicy while still bringing the bitterness. The malt profile matched beautifully, really enjoyed it."
"This is a beer that does a lot of things really good, but nothing great. A fine example of a pale ale that I'd gladly have again, availability permitting."
"The lack of aroma is the biggest issue, but really may be all the more reason to enjoy one of the best tasting beers in a can, from the can."
"Notes: Been a while since I had this one, and crafts cans are now expanding quite a bit. This one remains iconic in that regard, and is a fairly reliable and pleasing APA."
"D: Wow! It's amazing how the taste is preserved in a can! Certainly worth saving this six pack of cans! Incredible!"
"Would definitely drink again."
"... ... great Beer. I really want to talk abotu it,.. but i dont have the time right now.. please let me just post my ratings. yes."
"Overall, this is definitely my favorite beer in a can. At least so far."
"As far as flavor and smell is concerned, this pale ale is top notch. Deceptively impressive after bypassing it's loud and old school label. This beer is of high quality, and is intended for slow paced day drinking when ice cold. Another fine export from the great state of Colorado and worth a try whenever stumbled upon in random bars. Harder to find then you'd think so grab it while you can. This is an all time favorite for those looking for great aroma and taste from classic pale ale."
"D: A good pale ale, easily drinkable, but with all of the chatter about this one, I must admit, I was expecting a bit more out of it. Would have certainly appreciated a heavier hop nose."
"very good beer in all, worthwhile session alternative."
"D: It does not drink like a 6.5% ABV beer. I drank a few while working in the yard and found it very refreshing."
"D: great session beer, glad to finally get a chance to review it"
"D: A very drinkable beer here. A nice light body and not a super high ABV. I think this is going to be one of go to beers from now on. Great to keep around the house and doesn't take up to much room in the fridge."
"wow a great Ipa in a can! I love the versatility and the simple logo. I think us BA's have a bit of a complex sometimes. We never have fit in, we have never been that guy who could bring a case of beer to a party and sit back knowing that you hold something awesome in your hands. This is the beer that can allow us to do that. Everywhere bottles can't go dales pale ale is there for us. I can never possibly think about having another adventurous camping trip without a 6 pack of dales pale ale by my side. Thank you dale for making life more awesome."
"This medium-bodied brew tastes of cereal grains, with a fair amount of hoppy bitterness throughout with a slightly sweet aftertaste of alcohol. Pretty easily drinkable."
"Tremendous for the style. Pours a nice golden color with some white head. Decent retention. Smells largely of citrus hops with some caramel backbone as well. Tastes like a classic APA, reminds me of a better SN. Big leafy and herbal hops on top of a pronounced caramel malt backbone... a baby barleywine here to some degree. MF is medium with some creaminess/fullness. Great drinkability, an archetype of session beer to me."
"D- the bite keeps it from being higher, but still not a bad choice- and paired well with habanero Cheetos, which somehow made it an even more enjoyable experience"
"I bet this score won't come out like I want it to. I really, really love this beer. They nail it on the taste. I really don't care that much about how it looks or feels in my mouth. This stuff is a pleasure to drink."
"Clear amber yellow with a thick head that lingers. Smells pretty hoppy and alcoholic. Taste is similar. Grapefruit, orange peel and hops. It's crisp and bubbly with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel ok, but for me, not too drinkable. I'm not a hoppy person - but if you are, this one is well made and tasty, just not my taste."
"really enjoy drinking this beer. the fact that it is in a can makes it a must for camping and outdoor events. Oskar River Brewing has a monopoly on my cooler when I hit the great outdoors!"
"D: Awesome- you can drink just one or two by itself, with a meal, during a ski trip on the mountain (have done this numerous times by stowing it in my backpack), or you can go on a bender and drink a whole bunch."
"Value: Pretty decent at ten bucks a sixer."
"D-this is extremely drinkable, just a tad too much bitterness at the finish to be perfectly drinkable for a pale ale. the hop presence is fantastic in the nose and slightly lesser in the taste."
"D: this beer makes me want to grab my fifth slice of Sicilian pizza"
"Notes: This beer is one of the best pale ales I have had. As I've come to expect from Oskar Blues, this has amazing appearance and awesome drinkability. The flavors are just so juicy."
"Pours a deep and rich burnt orange with a frothy white head that retreats quickly. The nose tingling aromas of cirtus and pine erupt from the pour. Wonderful tingly carbonation is a great accent to this bold APA. The mouthfeel is substantive in that there are no watery moments and similarly there is no slick or syrupy aspect to the drink. The hop bitterness attacks the entire tongue and pallet, leaving no taste bud untouched. I have an affinity for canned beers that pack a hop punch...they give me a great opportunity to drink beer for breakfast while fishing, camping, etc. Oskar Blues does a great job on this brew and I couldn't be happier with its drinkability, ie. its relatively modest ABV for its style."
"Overall I didn't think this gained a whole lot from the dry-hopping and cask conditioning. A very solid beer that's worth a try however it's served."
"D - This is one of the better Pale Ales that I've had so far. Anybody that enjoys a hoppy beer will definitely appreciate this one. Oskar Blues has yet to let me down and I look forward to trying more of their brews!"
"Drinkability this is in no way a bad beer but a bit too aggressive on the hops and soap like taste they bring to the show just not something I personally would be willing to kill a whole 6-pack of"
"Overall I loved this beer. I would rate it among the top American ales I have tried."
"this beer is growing on me as I drink it. I am liking it more as it warms slightly, the citrus and fruit flavors show a little more. decent brew."
"D- Flavor makes for easy drinking as does the ABV, I like this beer very much and think it makes a good transition beer for non craft beer drinkers."
"Clear copper with a creamy tan head that leaves fine lacing on the glass. The nose is citrus peel and caramel. A healthy dose of caramel malt is well balanced with some fresh floral hop seasoning and candied orange rind. Medium bodied and easy to drink. A top notch APA for sure."
"Overall this is a really good pale ale, i love the big hop aroma and flavor combined with the carmel sweet malt. I could easily kill several of these."
"I have loved every Oskar Blues beer I've had and they have made their way into my top 3 favorite breweries. Recommended if you like Pale Ales with an IPA feel."
"Overall this is one of my favorite session beers and one that I revisit quite often. Another solid beer from Oskar Blues. Recommended."
"D- A nice APA that's a little on the hop-heavy side, but still quite nice. It's interesting to drink something this good out of a can!"
"I am still hesitant to try it in a can based on some of the other reviews that I have read calling out the ""metallic"" flavor."
"The color was nice and copper in tone. The head was a bit weak and soapy. Aroma had some nice caramel and a light malty toastiness. Clean taste and lively with carbonation. It had a nice hoppy bite to it. I'm happy to see good beers being packaged in cans. They recycle well and save these beer from destructive UV rays."
"""Just shake your boots and let it all get loose!"""
"A medium body, this one goes great with food."
"D - Drinks nicely, goes great with the pizza I'm eating. A nice lunchtime brew."
"Has a nice, bright-copper color and a loose off-white head that bubbles away happily and quickly. A decent floral nose is mellowed by strong caramel and a light malty toastiness that is quite appealing. Very clean taste, plenty of carbonation and a nice hoppy bite that is pulled along by strong malts. Don't be fooled by the blather on the can: this is definitely not a ""voluminously hopped mutha of a pale ale."" It's hoppy, but within reason, and well balanced so as not to be offensive. The staff at Oskar have clearly been reading too much puffery on bottles from Stone and Rogue. Well worth a try-- gives canned beer a good name."
"D: this is a nice crisp and highly drinkable pale. I would love for this to be locally available to me."
"One of the best canned beers I have ever had. Definitely will try this again if I get a chance. Had to import this to Korea but was well worth the extra shipping costs. Poured it into a wine glass and it gave me a nice lacing and approx 1 inch of foamy heady. The smell is great; a little fruity and hoppy. The colour is a coppery hue. With a ABV of 6.5% you can certainly enjoy a short session of 2-3."
"This beer was surprisingly hoppy to me for a pale ale, but very flavorful and pleasing nonetheless. It's my first craft beer from a can (with the exception of a couple nitro-can stouts). I didn't have lower expectations because of it and was looking forward to see if it made a difference. None that I could see. Give this one a shot."
"The feel of this beer light to medium with some carbonation that is pretty light. It also goes down pretty easy and is smooth even if it is pretty hoppy."
"D - This is a session beer. Just a great all around APA. I could drink this everyday, unlike many other heavier beers. However, this is no macro-brewery drink, it has complex undertones to the taste that make everything come together."
"has anyone ever asked you 'if you could only drink one beer the rest of your life, what would it be?"" me and my fellow liquor store employees have found ourselves talking about things you can't even imagine, and not surprisingly, this question has been brought up. On first reaction, you would shout out some world class beer like founders kentucky breakfast stout or FFF's dark lord, but all the time? for the rest of my life? those are desserts and should be treated as such. I think my answer would be a benchmark IPA like founders centennial or dogfish 90 minute, but when this beauty appeared in a 'thank you' four pack i received for covering a shift, an eyebrow was definitely skewed. i brushed it off as just a funny beer with a funny name, like horse piss. for pete's sake, it's in a can, ahh but that's part of the beauty my friend. now that this ham in a can has been discovered, i wouldn't recommend camping without it. i have a friend from Pennsylvania who i have running this stuff across the border like it's shwill. this is my desert island beer! try it, you won't be disappointed."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer. I almost could make this my session beer but sadly I can't get it. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to know what a great pale ale tastes like."
"D: Easy to drink pale ale. A nice option for the golf course that does not allow bottles!"
"Oskar Blues Dale's Pale Ale is a cloudy, light amber ale with a soft, fluffy, yellow-white head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a huge, hoppy aroma that's floral and grassy; a little sweet with a note of lemon or lemongrass. It has a smooth medium body with a crisp finish. he hops leave the tongue a little scratchy. here's prenty of bitter, fruity, grassy hop flavor. There's a peppery alcohol flavor at the finish. It's on the powerful end of the session ale spectrum. If I would've tasted this ten years ago, I would've called it an IPA."
"(From notes)Fairly clear amber/orange color. However, it wasn't until my second that I actually poured into a glass. It was quite an experience to pull the tab on a can and be greeted with that citrus hops with a hint of pine. There's also some bready malts. Taste is quite comparable to the scent. Really well balanced. This is one of the best APA's I've had...still have to put Burning River at the top. I tend to like the hop forward versions, so that appeals to me with this beer. I just can't get over the oddity of a canned beer tasting so good."
"First impression from tasting is how full and fluffy it feels. Not much in carbonation but still very lively. Nice sweet mix of a peppery hop bite and honey in the flavor upfront. The malt backbone takes the bite off with a sweet caramel flavor pulling the brew together for a warming feeling and a mellow somewhat wood aged spice."
"Drinkability: This is a well-made, drinkable beer that I'll be having more of in the future."
"A crisp golden orange color pours out of the can, while a pearly white head develops into a nice 1 inch topping. One sip and lacing is already beginning. The head is quite frothy for an APA. Grapefruit and lemon are prevalent on the nose with some citrusy hops and a hint of sweetness. This is one of my go-to beers considering how it is full of taste and not overly expensive. Taste is rich and tangy with a nice bitterness from the hops. Very citrusy and full of grapefruit. The bitterness sits on the back of the tongue as the citrus dances around the front. The hint of malts gets this beer down quite smoothly. Very delicious. Nice mouthfeel on this APA as well, nice and crisp. Has a smooth backbone as well that settles down the crispness from carbonation. Goes down easy, provides huge amounts of aromas and tastes. Great beer all in all, and well worth a try."
"Drinkability: This is the new go to for hoppy beers that are easy to get a hold of. Similar to SN torpedo. Great with wings i bet and spicy foods and love the can presentation!"
"M/D: Crisp light medium body with excellent carbonation. Not too dry, and very smooth and drinkable. This would be fantastic on a hot summer day, but just as delicious in the dead of winter!"
"Amber body with a creamy caramel head. Nice clumpy ringlets of lace are left as the head shrinks. Multi grain sweet bread, caramel coated green apples and nice hop presence in the nose. The taste is good but not great. Spruce and pine character like frsh cut tree limbs, bitter pale malt and light pink under ripened grapefruit with dried orange peel. Mouthfeel is the highlight, sudsy, rolls over the tongue nicely, dry but not over done. Not as good as hoped for but better than average."
"D - A pretty big pale ale... daddy like... very drinkable. I'm ready for sessions. Gonna pop me another can now."
"The first thing that hits you ( if your can wasn't adjatated like mine is the smell, this beer smells like hoppy. Taste is extremely hoppy with a strong bitter finish, mouthfeel is foamy with a metalic bite from the can. I have to admit it is a pleasent taste, would drink again"
"I have tried this several times and rarely found one that didn't taste exactly like the can it was poured from. An IPA is my favorite beer and I see promise in this one BUT they need to bottle it vice the can. That is how this beer has to acquire the metallic taste otherwise it has a future."
"This really is a session beer for a hophead like me. One time I looked down after a night of hanging out and was quite surprised to see 5 or 6 empty cans in front of me. Not even my favorite Oskar Blues brew (Gordon is top notch), but a solid choice."
"Typical hop-driven pale ale, but nothing too special. 12 oz can to glass. Copper color, a bit darker than what Ive seen for this style. Nose was good, fresh hop smell. Pretty mellow flavors, nothing too crazy or exciting in either malt or hops. Overall decent, well-made but not sure I'd recommend this."
"The best beer I think I've ever had. A dark golden color with an ambitious head for a pale ale, it carries a prominent c-hop aroma. The taste delivers that hoppy flavor, but it is followed immediately with a sweet finish that perfectly balances it. Delicious."
" M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with no alcohol or fizz. D- This beer doesn't have much to offer other than a bitterness."
"Good pale ale. Has some unique characteristics compared to others, but all work well together. Not a favorite of mine for the style, but good for something a little different but still in the same style at its core. Overpriced, but worth a try without a doubt."
"Overall, a standard-bearer for hop-heads. Not off-the-wall, but a good tasting pale."
"Comes off very similar to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. And that's a damn good thing."
" ~ This another great example of very good beer that comes in a can. I really look forward to the days when craft-brewers line Oskar Blues start spending more on their ingredients and less on bottles and shipping. I hope its not too far away."
"D: A good example of a Pale Ale. Not overly hoppy nor malty, but a good balance of the two."
"I avoided this beer for a long time soley because it was in a can. I am now ashamed of myself. This so far the best American Pale Ale I have ever had and will base all APA's in the future on this beer."
"I could drink this brew all day everyday. Good flavor and crispness makes this a good all around beer for the beer aficionado, or a first time craft drinker."
"Overall Decent, not something i would go nuts about."
"Overall, very good on draft, I'll be filling up my growler with this as long as it's around. Seeing as six packs are approaching 9-10 dollars anyway for the good stuff, you may as well find somewhere to fill your jug up. 9-10 dollars for about 5 pints of a good draft beer such as this is a deal and a half. I'm intrigued how it translates in the can. If you are camping somewhere and glass bottles are prohibited this is the perfect choice!"
"D-- Good APA. Very sessionable and the cans are easy to work with as opposed to bottles. Proof that good beer can be in a can."
"D - Like I said, more like an IPA than a pale ale. It's got a dry, bitter kick to the finish that lowers it's drinkability a bit but overall it's a well-crafted and balanced pale. I'm also happy for the sun-blocking can it comes in!"
"D: Very nice, sessionable beer."
"mmm, very sweet and smooth, with a crisp hop bitterness, almost an IPA for an APA but very fresh and tasty, one of the best APAs I've had in a while, a refreshing take on a ""regular"" style!"
"Drinkability is pretty good. It's smooth and refreshing. A really nice example of the style. Would be a possibility for a session beer but can be a little pricey compared to others. But overall, quite nice."
"The can says something about a hopped up pale ale, no lie. I just don't care for the kind of hops used. The aroma is of a pine forest and the taste is exactly the same. Chewing on pine needles. As a pale ale I think it is to hoppy. I wouldn't enjoy more than one."
"Found two six packs at the grocery store. So glad I did. Appearace is dark orange copper amber, a little cloudy. looks and smells like an IPA. Nice two inch head, beutiful lacing. The look is kind of a moot point because this will be consumed directly from the can. Harsh hop presance, in a good way. This has to be very close to an IPA. Juicy oily hops bludgen your tounge. I love this beer. It has even more hoppy goodness than Stone or Sierra Nevada's versions. More of a creamy, complex mouth feel too. At close to 7% ABV, it is almost too drinkable. I just love how it tastes.I really love the fact that it comes in a cool red and blue redneck looking can. I love cans. Up there with my favorites. Great beer."
"Drinkability: I wish this was something that I could get my hands on all the time. The smell and taste are great and it's very refreshing, this would definitely be a go-to pale for me."
"D-A good APA. Very easy drinking. I would readily drink this again. This would make a good introduction to craft beer for the BMC crowd."
"The deep orange color is always darker than I expect. The aroma is subtle but complex, with a combination of caramel sweetness, earthy hop bitterness, and alcohol. The flavor is much more one-dimensional, with the hops driving the party. The flavor is bigger and bitterer than many pale ales, with strong notes of pine and grapefruit. The bitterness builds, which can make it tough to drink more than a few at a time (I learned this when I chose Dale's as my preferred can to drink on the beach this summer). Overall, very flavorful and a great option among canned beers, but not one of the first pale ales I would reach for."
"Draught at Pizzeria Paradiso in Dupont Circle. Clear amber with a medium white head and nice lacing. Aroma of black pepper and lemon. Flavor is a very nice balance between the subtle hoppy bitterness and the malt. Not over the tops as some American IPAs are. Nicely done."
"D: Drinkable and interesting."
"M/D - Perfect carbonation on this beer helps give it a frothy mouth and makes it extremely drinkable. One of the better pales I've had."
"This beer is light enough to request more than a 12 oz. but not so light that you think you are drinking water. I could easily drink a 12 pack without knowing it."
"Drinkability - A little strong for your sessionable Pale Ale,but plenty refreshing and full of flavor.I like this beer."
"overall a great pale ale, with a good malt character and strong hops flavor without overpowering the balance."
"Dale's Pale Ale is very drinkable with an assertive hop character; this is definitely a good pale ale to have around, even though it can be somewhat pricier than other pale ales that I would consider to be of more or less comparable quality. At any rate, this is a good option when I want to switch things up."
"Feel and Drinkability: This one, as aforementioned, is soft on the palate, carbonation is soft and delicate, not prickly. The beer goes down real smooth. Body is full and the flavor just lingers-malt gives way to hops and they just sit there on the palate. The next sip is perfectly balanced, sweetness hits the tip of the tongue and you've still got bitterness and hop flavor there from the previous sip. Excellent beer, be sure to buy this if you find it."
"Drinkability: It has the flavor to make me want more, and is not too heavy or overpowering to put me off. I really enjoyed this pale ale."
"D) A Decent PA, but not a standout."
"Food Pairings: Poultry. Good with earthy, nutty, and tangy cheeses. Also, salads that have nuts and a citrusy dressing in them."
"D: Nice pale ale that is very much drinkable as a session beer or to pair with typical American pub fare."
"D - Fantasticly sessionable pale ale that is a staple buy when I go to a market its sold in. Top Notch beer."
"Pours a pretty dark golden amber color with a 1.5 finger head that is decently creamy but resides fairly quickly. Nice, thick lacing is left as I drink this one down. Smells mostly malty to me with a hop (piney) backbone, a decent balance but I pick up mostly pale malts. The smell is certainly deceiving to the taste, it is a bit weak, not much going on I guess. Taste is better than the smell. A huge kick of malts to start off, perfectly balanced by a BLAST of hops in the after taste. I feel like there is only one hop used here and LOTS of it, it kicks you in the mouth in the aftertaste. The can is not lying about it being hoppy. Some sweetness can be detected on the palatte asides from the malts, a good kind. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation, creamyness, and a huge coat of hops left on the tongue, no alcohol taste but a tiny bit of warming in this one. Drinkability is good here, good taste and the price for it is not bad, the only thing I am worried about is the hop backbone overtaking the palette if I have a few of these, other than that no off flavors or over alcohol will kill this one. Maybe I'll buy this one if I want an overly hopped pale ale for a decent price."
"D- This is a very good beer made more portable by being in a can. I can now say that have gotten over the stigma of a craft beer being in a can. Thank you Oskar Blues."
"Pours clear, dark orange in color, about a two-finger yellowish light tan head. Smells of sweet floral notes, some caramel, a touch of orange rind. The taste at first is a bit herbal, with some nice sweet malts, then a bitterness creeps up that reminds me of biting into an orange rind almost. It has a sort of intesity to the bitterness that has a hint of citrus and some sweet malts. Sticky, slightly biscuity finish is not crisp like I would desire. For a pale ale I find it a bit harsh without a lot of aroma hops there to balance it out. Quite malty for an American pale. Medium bodied with a comparatively high carbonation. Decent stuff, though I am fairly surprised that this has so much bitterness without an equal aroma, and also at how malty this one is. No real outstanding aspects here for me."
"Two finger plus head of airy foam, the surface dimpled even without too many larger bubbles, not that much lacing but what's there is super sticky. Light amber orange color with a vague gauzy translucency, more yellow at the outermost edges. The nose definitely has a ""nip at your heels"" quality, cut wet green grass alongside pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus as well as floral blossoms and some pine oil, the malts expressed as cocoa and chocolate powder, smooth in a non-showy manner. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is lowkey and firms up the mouth feel rather than add unnecessary flash. The pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime citrus drier but no less dominant. Grassy in a tickly way, like a blade drawn across the bottom of your foot. Any maltiness pretty much gets its lunch money taken at recess. Some pine and mint, pinch of white pepper too. Vibrant from start to finish, hyper-actualized pale ale which one might argue exceeds the category."
"A hoppy, delicious Pale Ale. This beer pours a medium golden color with a creamy white head. The aroma is pleasantly sweet and hoppy. The hops are peachy and floral. There's some malt sweetness, as well. The flavor is hoppy without being overly bitter. They've hit a really nice balance with this beer, though it's definitely hoppy for a pale. There's a very nice sweet caramel malt backbone. It's a satisfying and drinkable beer. I'm trying it against Stone's and definitely prefer this beer. Excellent stuff. I like the cans."
"J"
"D: On tap, I am really enjoying this beer... Maybe even more so than out of the can."
"D- Drinkable beer and also amazing coming from a can. Not the best but a good beer to have around."
"Nicely drinkable, well balanced, flavorful, though a bit brash for an APA in my eyes. I would certainly take one without hesitating, but it's just ""bigger"" than most APA's I've had, and that can be good and bad."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is above average but not over the top. Overall, it's a good beer, but a little to malty for the style. I much prefer a lighter body and stronger hop profile in my Pale Ales. Skal."
"This is one of my favorite, if not my favorite, pale ales. Simply put, I had a CRAVING for this beer this week. The six pack I bought, though nearly 10.50 and a bit dated at nearly 3 plus months didn't disappoint. Is it the can? Or kudos to my local shop for keeping it refrigerated? Anyway, an aggressive pour leaves a two finger head that leaves satisfying amounts of lace by the third pint. The malt is caramel and sweet, but the hop profile is where this beer just shines. It is balanced. The almost brown sugar malt base is perfectly matched with the tangy, citrusy hoppiness. Disappears dangerously fast from my standard pint glass. Flavor abounds and is complex enough to keep you drinking. I love this pale ale! Well done Oskar Blues."
"Poured a nice deep copper color from the can, with a bit of nice head but almost no lacing. Deep hop aroma, very citrusy with a nice floral hint. Good taste, a nice pale ale with wonderful American hops and enough malt to keep it thick and nearly balanced. Went down fine, if a little rough from the carbonation."
"A good sipper, or can be drank ""en-masse", as evidenced during a nice game of horeshoes played this past weekend."
"Overall: All around good beer. Not quite the fantastic punch of Alpha King from 3F, but meatier than most pales around. A heavy hitter and especially w/6.5 abv, very drinkable and tasty. The piney lingering hops leave you thirsty for more."
"PS - Can is great for backpacking, river/lake, pool, or beach trips where glass is a) not allowed, and b) too heavy. So I added a 0.5 point to drinkability for that."
"The first thing I taste is the hops, which overpower the tip of the tongue with floral taste. The malt character is very nice and sweet and a little sticky. The more sips I take the more balanced the overall flavor is, which is good and getting better. This is a hoppy pale ale I recommend to someone new to the style for sure. Not only is it a very good example, I feel like it's a very drinkable one. The mouth feel is a little thick and I know that after too much time, or a few of these, it becomes cloying. Overall a tasty and humble pale ale, albeit not a perfect one."
"D - A very nice APA to keep on hand...this is very drinkable due to the balanced and refreshness on the palate...and you can't beat drinking a craft beer from a can"
"i love beer in a can,it's great.i wish i could get this stuff in ohio.smooth medium body with nice drinkability."
"D- As this beer is consumed over time, the flavor of citrus rind begins to stick on the tongue, masking the tropical fruit and malt flavors... taking this from a 'multi-dimensional' beer down to one dimension... not good. From the drinkability standpoint, this puts it below par when compared to run-of-the-mill APAs (in my book)."
"Poured a golden brown with a thick white head but disappeared quickly. Smell was sweet and of oily hops. Taste started sweet then finished very bitter. Very dry finish after a fruity hop start. Similar finish to Stone IPA. Good beer, probably not my favorite IPA though."
"Color is a very attractive reddish light golden copper, head bright, white and abundant. Aroma lets you know what its about--hops (floral variety) with a sweet malt background pull in tongue simultaneous in both directions. There's a considerable amount of complexity here. Theres something here making me think of butterscotch too. Just a first class beer all around."
"When I open the can, I didn't hear much of an audible crack,, but it was fine once I poured it. I bought this beer a couple months ago, so perhaps it was past its peak hop flavor window but there was not date stamp or label to be found so I can't say whether or not that is the case"
"D: A solid APA. The can really adds to the drinkability in my opinion. This beer plus the great outdoors would be a pleasant match. The only unfortunate thing would be that it would dissapear fast. If I could get this in MN, I would drink it often."
"Not a bad beer, but I've had better APA's."
"Notes: This is by far the hoppiest beer that I have ever seen in a can and if you like hops then you will appreciate this one more than I do."
"D: A rather refreshing beer. The malts where slightly too prominent, and perhaps I would have wanted a somewhat cleaner profile flavorwise."
"D/O - A very enjoyable American Pale Ale that is worth a try if you haven't imbibed before. It is well balanced and very quaff able. I will definitely revisit this beer again. Well done Oskar Blues. Cheers."
"Cheers!"
"Definitely one of the best canned beers available, although i still like to pour it into a glass..."
"d- great drinkability, glad i have a few more in the fridge, i could have several in a sitting, it's packed with flavor (although too much for some people i 'forced' a try on), right up my alley, will buy again."
"D- Yes and no for this one...I think it does have a bit too much sweetness, not really refreshing or crisp, which I want in a clean APA...I would try again...but probably not going to be my ""go to"" beer anytime soon..."
"NOTE! Will have to come back with a fresher review."
"d- all night all day easy drinker with a good taste"
"Seems like more of an East Coast DIPA than a pale ale. Tasty. Might remind me of Blind Pig with an increased malt profile."
"D: A definite choice for anywhere that doesn't allow glass bottles. Complex and a good example of American ale"
"All in all, a great offering from Oscar Blues. I buy this beer regularly."
"A pale ale which could use more balance by toning down the hops and creating a better malt backbone. A bit harsh, with a bone-dry quality which sticks to the back of the throat."
"D - Goes down easy and begs for another sip, easy to put down a few with the convenience of a can. More approachable to non craft people though it might be a shock to an uninitiated palate. Good beer, a little pricey over here in Jersey and a little more than I would expect from a beer that calls itself an APA. It may be in my head but at times I do get a bit of the metallic flavor. I know the cans are lined but as it is poured it very much touches bare metal. Then again I've gotten metallic flavors from beers in bottles, could be a product of the water chemistry or my crappy taste buds."
"This is the sort of thing I've come to expect from Oskar Blues. It's a strong offering and worthy of its popularity. This one's a very sturdy APA with just enough complexity and depth to put it above the typical and a fantastic balance."
"This beer really grows on you at about 42 F the boldness only grows and malt, smoke & hops make the full entrance. Pour this beer into a warm tumbler for two fingers of lacing and strong aroma of hops, great amber color and citrus notes attack the pallate!"
"Drinkability: A great Pale ale. Seriously EPIC. Doesn't have the history or prestige that Sierra Nevada Has, but this is great. I've always viewed the SN PA as being the king of APAS but now I have a tough time picking. This is closer to an IPA due to its hoppiness. I do have to admit I will chose SN pale ale over this 8/10 times because its cheaper, more widely available, lower in alcohol and more refreshing. Geez though I am really buying the freshness of cans with this beer though. This is one fresh Ale."
"Poured a dark golden color into a pint glass. Nice, hoppy smell with a bubbly head. A hoppy taste but not overwhelming. Good back end and very drinkable. I was expecting a mellow taste since it was a pale ale but this beer has a nice bite to it. I had this on tap at Library Alehouse in Santa Monica and it was good! A good summer beer which I could drink a few more of if it wasn't so late here. Another good beer from Oskar Blues."
"D..Easy to drink, especially if it's warm outside. Best canned beer I have ever had (the rumors were true). Recommended if you want a stronger pale ale for a backyard cook out, or a few beers doing house work. I hope to have again soon."
"Highly, highly recommended."
"I usally don't find really hoppy beers all the drinkable but this is thanks to the amazing malt presence that makes it such a great pale ale."
"Darker than you might expect from a pale ale, copper, with no head likely due to a wet glass and poor pour. Clear. Balance of malt sweetness and citrus hops. First taste is well balanced, more IPA than Pale Ale. Somewhat sweet but yet well hopped. Pepperiness in the finish."
"Overall, the beer was more on the malty sweet side than the hoppy side. It may have not been very fresh, and I got the feeling that hops had faded some. I did still like the beer so I didn't drop the score based on this, but I will be looking for this again to see if freshness was actually an issue."
"D-This is a very drinkable beer, bring it on...."
"Typical Pale Ale body, maybe a touch fuller than most. I could have several without working too hard at it. Worth trying."
"Drinkability- One of the better APA's out there. Not blow you away hoppy as to mask as an IPA, but a nice balanced brew with a touch more on the hops. Quality! Also on sale for $4.99 a six pack...a steal at the time."
"Dale's is by far my favorite from Oskar Blues it is a IPA, not a pale ale, but that is ok by me. I prefer an IPA over a pale, and this one kicks ass!"
"D - This would be better with a little more hop presence. I think I like this one the least of the Oskar Blues cans I have tried."
"Rock on Oskar Blues G & B, Ten Fidy - Yer next!"
"While I'm not the most educated beer drinker; as opposed to other member's here this is a very nice drink. Goes down smooth and tastes very similar to an amber. This and 21st amendment brewery are making very commendable beers in cans. Great taste and smell"
"D: Quite drinkable; this is a good bbq or lawn mowing beer, although the more you drink the more it burns (just a little)."
"Drinkability is great. Good for a barbecue or cookout!"
"This was the best beer from a can I had ever had until I discovered Surly, but it's still right up there in the top five."
"Poured from the 12 oz can into a pint glass. Cloudy amber beer beneath two fingers of foam. Smells like hops and grain. Tastes almost like an IPA. More than enough hops to be interesting. Surprisingly good mouthfeel and finish. I've never had this ale before but I will recomend it to my curious friends."
"I like this beer but it's just so different from other examples in the style I don't know what to think. Definitely one to try if you like bitter beers that aren't saturated with citrus."
"Pours a copper color with a very thick two finger head that when you start drinking gives way to a lot of lacing. The smell is of earthy hops and malt. The taste of the beer was of earthy hops at the end and middle. There was a hint of malt up front to the beer. The mouthfeel was dry. There wasn't alot of carbonation in the beer. The drinkability was okay, the beer had a more earthy hop taste that I wasn't expecting for a pale ale. I thought this was more along the line of an IPA."
"I just had this for the first time at a BBQ. I drank it straight from the can so I really can't comment on appearance. I was shocked by the hoppy goodness of this beer. Very lite spicy hop aroma, citrus and pine, drifted out of the cans's opening. Light flavors of malt mixed with hops and a perfect bitter aftertaste. A very refreshing beer, light in nature but with enough hop flavor to have you coming back for more. A great introductory beer for people who have yet to acquire a taste for finer beer. This beer will have a place in my fridge to push onto my friends."
"D: More of an IPA than a pale ale, and definitely one of the better ones. I'd put it in the same league as Two Hearted and Racer 5. I guess I'll have to revise my review of Ten Fidy, because this is the best beer in a can I've ever had."
"Pours a cloudy orange with light white head. Hops and evergreen in the nose, pleasant and light. Slight caramel from the malt, toffee, fresh fruity hops, and some spice in the finish. Smooth, light-medium body with medium carb. Wonderfully drinkable, flavorful yet light on the palate and stomach."
"Dale's Pale Ale feels like camping in the woods. It's a slightly aggressive go-to beer that has more character than typical pale ales."
"D--Perhaps the Union Jack IPA I had before this ruined my palate? I just don't get this beer, it is nowhere near above average"
"Not too much pine, but some nice citrus and a dry hop bitterness. Solid and straightforward pale ale"
"Don't fear the can! Highly recommended. Oskar Blues, come to Minnesota!"
"11-6-10- A quick edit. I have to admit my 1st impression was a bit harsh, tried it again and i really enjoyed the 2nd go round. The only difference was where I bought it from which ,may have been a problem, still a little quirky of the taste buds typical from SKA, one you either like or hate. I still drink it out of the can and it's a nice beach or pool brew, but I'd bump up the taste to at least a 4."
"D=this has become a staple in my beer fridge as what I go to when I just can't decide what I want. Very sessionable."
"Good things ""can"" come in cans! This is a great everyday quaffer of a b eer. It's a tongue bruiser of a pale ale, and worth seeking out. I will petition to get OB in Indiana!"
"Golden body, can't comment on head since I swilled straight from the can. Pronounced hop presence, mirrored in the tastebuds. Actually, this is one of the most hoppy APAs I've had. Big carbonated mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable despite the relatively high ABV for style. Interesting, and the can is cool."
"this is a good brew the best pale ale in a can that i've come across . this is a great beer for a camping trip with all the food that goes with the out doors."
"D- This has the feel of an IPA all the way. Nice flavor and really drinkable. I realy wish we had this in Ohio."
"My first craft brew from a can. Pours a dark amber brown. Nice head fizzy with good carbonation. Has a good hoppy, malt biscuit aroma. Nice hoppy, malt flavor. My initial impression was its Sam Adams in a can. Has that great pale ale hop flavor I know from SA. Plus the drinkibility is AWESOME. Very anxious to try other offerings from Oskar."
"Now if only I could find Ten Fidy on the West Coast!"
"A really good beer, though it's not my favorite by a long shot."
"pours a nice amber color from the can it yields a very nice and creamy looking head the smell is citrus and spice/hops pine carmel and malt but not strong kinda faint..however the taste is everything b4 mentioned in the smell its an assertive pale ale with the hops in charge but not at all overpowering its very well balanced and very smooth..the hops hit you first then some malts and caramel dance around to make a very enjoyable pale ale..will i buy it again... you bet.. recommended for those that enjoy a hoppy pale ale or (light ipa)"
"This beer pours a beautiful light mahogany color, there is a slight head on the top of this beer. Carbonation wise, it's light to moderately carbonated. Aroma is of citrus, pine and caramel. The taste is smooth, hoppy, and of caramel. There is a nice slight hop aftertaste that almost outperforms the initial hop bite. This is a awesome canned beer, bravo. Had I not poured this beer I would not know it traveled to me in one. Not a cheap beer, but a great example of a pale ale."
"D: Drank quite of few of these, and kept going back. A damn fine choice for outside drinking!"
"D. Goes down crisp and clean, a very enjoyable Ale. Intersting flavors, but none are overpowering. A very good Ale"
"Overall, this is a great beer...and such a surprise to come from a can...I picked up a six-pack for nine bucks, which isn't bad considering the pretty remarkable flavor. Overly hoppy for a Pale Ale? maybe. But, in general, a drinkable, good beer."
"m"
"what a great APA. after reading and hearing how it is more like an IPA, i do not agree. the hops are def more noticeable than most pale ales but still has a nice light malt backbone. great beer!"
"I haven't tried the other otherings from Oskar, but I need to test out the Ten Fiddy and Gordon."
"soft, sweet, malt aroma, almost german in flavor profile, honey with straw-colored vertical edges, soft on the palate, butter cream taste and aroma, there was a little weight to the mid-palate, biscuit in the nose, best canned beer i've ever tasted."
"That said, I like having cans of beer around, and this is in the short rotation. A delicious concoction that I'd be happy to session, and HAVE happily sessioned, until the alcohol slaps me upside the head."
"Cheers!!"
"Drinkability is exceptional, great taste, refreshing, vibrant, interesting, sure glad I got this, will get again fersure."
"It is absolutely superb with burgers or steaks on the grill, cutting all the heavy flavors and linking with the caramelized meat flavors."
"Overall, Dale's Pale Ale is a very assertive APA, almost to a fault. Borderline, at least- and I suppose that's where the divide of opinions lies here. Personally, I'll be buying again."
"Definitely recommended."
"Terrible packaging - looks like an adjunct lager at first glance. Never would have given it a second thought. But guess what? It's a very hoppy pale ale that verges on IPA territory. Darkish orange amber in the glass, good head with some lacing and retention. Strong citrus hops flavour with some floral notes and a nice bitter finish, all balanced by solid toffee malts. Reminds me of Lagunitas New Dogtown but slightly less citrusy. Active, oily mouthfeel, very refreshing and flavourful. I could drink a lot of these -- too bad they're not available in Alberta. Just what the doctor ordered!"
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a dark orange-amber body with a thick bubbly head that fades with good lacing in the glass. Strong malt aroma; oak and toast scents. Medium bodied with strong sweet flavors that give way to bitter hops in the finish. Decent drinkability, I'd give this another chance in the future."
"D - Good, refreshing, balanced beer."
"Drinkability: awesome beer. pretty hoppy, could've told me it was an IPA and i wouldn't argue. as a bonus, it comes in cans, so you can pack it anywhere."
"D: I have tried Ten Fidy before and that was an amazing beer. This is as affordable and delivers for those of us who prefer hoppy beers. Even from a can this delivers more hops then some bottle IPA's I have tried. Very impressive session beer. Enjoyed, with amongst other things, the new Agoraphobic Nosebleed."
"gave a high rating on drinkability because of its low price and near perfect alchohol content (6.7% is my ideal)."
"D: The APA is a nice drink, forceful but not a bully."
"this should be called MORNING ALE.. this can be enjoyed anytime!. this has a lot of dimmensional flavor. being a fan of green flash west coast ipa, bear republics racer 5, hop rod rye,& dogfish heads ipa...or any good ipa actually!!. i never thought beer could taste or be bothered to be good in a can.i was wrong!!& its not even an ipa. i dont think it matters what you prefer. you wont be disappoined with this. GREAT JOB!!!! OSCAR BLUES!!!!"
"Pours a dark red with copper mixed in and a one-finger head that is sticky. A nice smell of citric hops as well as some sweet malt, although I can detect a little aluminum from the can. Nothing spectacular but pretty textbook: a medium-body, slightly chewey, has a good balance of sweet malts and citric/piney hops for a easy drinking beer with a crisp, clean backbite. Considering price and the fact that this is in a can this is pretty good."
"Overall - As for pouring this craft beer out of a can and in to a plastic cup as I was short a pint glass at the neighborhood party, it all worked out very well! This little experiment proves that craft beer can be great in a can and even in a 16oz. Solo cup!!!"
"D- This is definitely an easy drinker. Not as hoppy as I would have enjoyed and a little bit of an off flavor towards the end but a very tasty pale ale none the less."
"Pale orange with a nice off white head. It pack a lot of floral and citrus hop aroma. I love the cans and I think it keeps the hops fresh. Tastes very much like the nose. It has a bunch of citrus hop flavor and it has a great bitterness. It also has that nice caramel malt flavor. It has a pretty nice balance but I would almost have it fall into the IPA category. Anything this good that comes from a can is ultra drinkable in my book."
"D - This is a very solid, drinkable beer in my opinion. Packs a nice hoppy punch, but the malts makes this a very smooth drink overall. A tasty APA that's full of flavor, and goes down nice."
"Pours a gorgeous golden straw with a superb off-white head that sticks around and lacing persistantly. Smells like bitter sticky hops. Taste is dominated by the bitterness from the hops but a malt undertone is present and strong. Mouthfeel is great, and I would love nothing more than to drink this beer all day every day. I fell in love with Oskar Blues and canned beers, so chances are my reviews of this brewery will be very biased since I love it so much. I wish everyone used cans!"
"Mouthfeel is really wonderful. The head is just so silky soft. Definitely my favorite aspect of this beer."
"Overall, this is definitely one of my favorites out here in Colorado. Relatively cheap and just an awesome session beer. This will definitely be one of my go to beers out here in the Rockies. Sierra Nevada what?"
"Poured from a can into the brewery's very own pint glass. Pours a hazy orange/brown color with a small head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Smells fairly inviting as well: fresh American hops. Those hops are very dominate upon tasting. So much so that it may unbalance the beer somewhat. As it warms you get more of the malt sweetness coming through, but it's never quite enough to offset the hops. I've had this a number of times and have always thought that it was more of an IPA than an APA. This tasting has only solidified my opinion."
"good beer, just doesn't fit the style very well."
"My sister in Tucson mailed me a sixer of Dale's. Good looking beer and great head/lacing, despite having travelled 2,000 miles via snail mail. Taste was hoppy and delicious, well-balanced brew. Great for a hot summer day or lounging on the lake/river. Great beer! Hopefully, we'll see this one on the shelves here sooner rather than later."
"Fantastic!"
"Overall: The mouth feel is softly carbonated with some dryness. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. This is a pretty good pale ale. So far every thing that I have tried from Oskar has been good."
"Cloudly yellow gold color with a mm of head. Smell is what is expected with an APA/IPA. Very hoppy taste, well balanced with the malt, but the hops take preference. Hops linger a bit too much for me, but a tasty beer nonetheless. Not sure if I could drink it all night, but a good one for the night."
"Poured from a 12 ounce can into an Imperial pint glass. Appears a slightly hazed copper/yellow color with around two fingers of creamy off white head. The head leaves minimal lacing on my glass. Notes of citrus fruits such as grapefruit and lemon, as well as toasted grains and sweet caramelized malts make up the aroma and flavor of this ale. Medium in both body and carbonation. Worth a try."
"D - Very nice beer. With slightly higher carbonation, this Pale Ale would be hard to beat. Always a nice to drink and a very sessionable beer."
"Dr. Way good, only 23 to go (this is PA)."
"Canned on 1-11-09, this is by far the best beer out of a can -- to date, for me anyway. Wow ! Great looking beer, poured into a Sam Adams sensory glass. Nice hoppy tasting beer. Definitely packs a punch for an American Pale Ale -- far superior, than Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale, in this particular style. You really need to stock up on these little gems. Great addition to the craft beer market and my mini fridge."
"Hey, don't let the can fool you. I was really put off by the can and its appearance. Too many bad memories of Bud in a can. Don't pass this one up just because of the can. Maybe it's some marketing ploy to make them distinctive, or maybe they're trying to save money, but neither are necessary. This beer can stand on its own. Crisp ale taste, excellent finish. Not much in way of aroma, but then again pale ales rarely have one. This one's a good choice."
"4.5 D: Very good sessionable beer."
"D: Very, very nice pale ale here from Oskar Blues. Very hoppy and flavorful, yet backed with a pretty firm malt backbone. Maybe more brewers should experiment with the cans - they've certainly nailed it here."
"D: drinkability takes a hit for me because of the malt flavor domination and bite, alcohol isn't very noticeable but you can tell it's not something you should play beer pong with without consequences"
"D: I like this pale ale style; no frills hops."
"Future outlook: Another pleasantly well crafted beer-in-a-can...but only available to me via the trade-route at this time...."
"[RR-IPA/APA; tap]"
"D: Goes down way too easy given the alcohol level, I could drink this by the truckload. I like the over the top hops combined with what seems to be an over the top caramel malt addition. An excellent APA, highly recommended. I wish I could get this in KY."
"Drinkability: Not sure how this stacks up to the canned version - it's been so long since I've had it. This one's readily available, about average as far as abv% does, and sports an interesting array of flavors and aromas, though I'm really most impressed by the presentation (gorgeous appearance, great zippy but soft mouthfeel). Nonetheless, it's a solid, quaffable brew, and sure beats the pants off anything else I could have found at Wild Wings (though I did follow it up w/ a Victory Prima Pils)."
"A very pretty golden amber in color with a good sized airy tan head. A thick sheet of lacing is left behind. Smells hoppy and fruity with a little malt sweetness in the background. Tastes exceptional, with a good citrusy hop bite at first which is not at all overwhelming. Spice, malts and more light fruits finish things up. Body is light to medium, and this one's well carbonated. Really liking this one, as the hops are quite present but just subdued enough to make for great a great mix with all the other elements. Bordering on IPA territory."
"On tap at the flying sauce in Fort Worth. Amber colored in the glass. Big pillowy head. Super hop aroma through nose. Grapefruit all the way. Quite hoppy for a pale ale imo. Taste is citrusy with the grapefruit tartness shining through. Body is smooth and creamy. Might be one of the hoppier pale ale's i've had."
"D: Always nice to have some of this in the fridge. I'll add some extra love for being available in a can. Perfect for frisbee golf or other stoner related activities."
"While I enjoy this beer and find it drinkable, I am conflicted. I think it is a bit inconsistent, every time I taste it, its slightly different. This time I am hung up on the dominance of that sharp malted biscuit."
"Overall it's pretty good. More like an IPA in my opinion, but a good one. Something I would return to when I'm in the mood for hops."
"Talkin' Bob says that Dale's Pale Ale is being aimed at lovers of Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. This is dangerously drinkable, and at 6.5% would ensure that nothing would get done this summer if I made this a session favorite."
"i got some good advice from a good friend who loves IPA's when i said i was not fond of them. He told me Dale's Pale Ale is an awesome intro to the heavier hoppy bitter IPA's. I would have to agree it is very mild, not complex but definitely not normal. Thank you Trip Wooten."
"Drink is good. I don't think I could drink to many as it is too bitter and sweet."
"I gotta start off and say wow. I love this beer. They call it a pale ale but it's really an IPA for me and a good one at that. Have had this many times, most recently at the Flying Saucer In Houston. Poured a nice orangey amber. All various citrusy aromas, just amazing. Starts a good bitter with a smooth citrusy middle with some biscuit and ends a wonderful citrus taste in the back. I love this beer, enough said."
"Notes: This is more of an IPA than anything, and looking at that, it's definitely one worth drinking if available. Though, I'm not disappointed I can't get it... I'll take Pandemonium any day :D"
"Pours a clear golden amber in color with about a finger of white head. Aroma is good with lots of citrus and pine hops. There is also a touch of bready malt far in the background. Taste is quite good. High hop flavor (citrus, pine, a bit of resin) a clean malt character, and a moderate bitterness. Good mouthfeel with medium-light body and moderate carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer. Easily drinkable and quite enjoyable."
"Lots of head that laces well on this bronzed ale. Hops are pretty up front for an APA, but its delicious as there is some balance there as well. Crisp and bright in the mouth and you could drink these all night. Great session beer. Highly recommend for this upcoming summer season."
"This is a pretty good beer. It looks awesome, but didn't quite deliver. This one was canned about 2 1/2 months ago, so it's not the freshest kid around, but I don't think it should have completely deteriorated. I'll certainly give it another shot, but I'm not sure if I'm ever going to love it. I just don't think it brings the citrus goodness like I was hoping. This is a good beer, but I've loved the other Oskar's I've had, so maybe my expectations were a little unfair."
"P.S. I think canning helps this beer stay fresh. Pale ales don't taste this good seven months old from a bottle."
"D: Easy drinker, this is a little on the strong side for a true session, but it's a good beer to sit down and have a couple after work. As terrible as it is, I think I will continue to enjoy this beer straight outta the can."
"The taste is grapefruit up front but with a lot of syrupy grape and grain - light on flavour and mostly sweet, along with some faint, thin fruit and a hint of piney-leafiness. It's a bit too sweet up front while the finish is slightly too bitter, and it has a lingering bitterness afterwards. It is not overly bitter but the elements don't integrate and balance very well while utlimtately it's somewhat one-dimensional and bland. It's fairly full-bodied in feel and has well-rounded range of elements but they are too thin and don't work well together."
"Overall I think Dale's has a nice attempt here, but too bitter and the hops are just a little overdone for a Pale Ale. If this was called IPA I think I might feel slightly different about it. Regardless the can is a neat novelty that I think should stick around in craft brewing and Oskar Blues is doing a nice job working toward that end. Very good pricing on this one as well."
"D- Killer drink. Bold and interesting flavor without being overbearing."
"Good mouthfeel, an easy drinker, a very good APA for the price. Keep some around if you can find it."
"Drinkability: To me, this is an average American Pale, nothing more. A little on the hoppy side. Nothing I wouldn't have again, nothing i will go out of my way for."
"This is, solidly, the best beer I have ever had from a can."
"Pours a slighty cloudy orange color with a thick head that sticks to the sides of the glass. The smell was hoppy, pine, citrus orange. The citrus peel bitterness hits right up front with pine flavors and a slight caramel. The bitterness lingers quite a while. It has a strong flavor and I wouldn't be able to have more than one or two. I like the design on the can."
"D: I could drink this all day...liver willing."
"This beer poured an orange-tinged copper color with a fluffy single-finger head. The smell is pleasantly hoppy with a lot of citrus and some biscuity malt. The taste starts off with a kick of grapefruit-rind like hops that give way to a bit of malt sweetness and a surprisingly clean finish. The mouthfeel is slightly slick with pretty low carbonation. This beer is surprisingly drinkable, especially since it's so hoppy. A great one to try if you can find it."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable beer and tasty hop heavy brewski, more hops then even expected in a lot of pale ales, easily could be thought or considered an Ipa, this was my first time trying it I really did like it one I will surely visit again see if its as good as i thought on first try, could be my go to can beer in the summer when planning an outdoor day, worth a try from a good brewery"
"Overall: Really good beer, wished they made a 30-pack of it."
"Amazingly tasty Pale Ale from a can. If you like American Pale Ale beer give this a try as soon as possible. Pours amber with a good white head and plenty of white lacings. Hops rule this brew and a good amount of support from the malts. One of the best beers from a can ever! Mouthfeel is very good. Overall a fine Pale Ale."
"D: Probably won't be getting this one again. Drinkable.. yeahh sure.. sort of. Not my cup of tea.. or beer.. uhmm.. yeah."
"an aggressive pour reveals a cloudy, orange, somewhat hazy pale. It has a nice head with decent lacing. The smell is some murky, faint hops, I can't put my finger on which kind. Somewhat piney, with a little bit of sweetness and citrus. The taste is more citrus, and a little bit of sour, not much sweetness. Finishes dry, and a lingering bitterness insues. The mouthfeel is somewhat sticky, but pretty well rounded. Not the most drinkable pale I have had, but not bad. would be a good summer day beer or a garage kind of beer."
"D: A great APA. It's big and bold and delicious."
"Another great Oskar Blues brew and a step in the right direction for quality craft brews out of the can. A bit hopped up for an APA, but no complaints here. Very nice!"
"Delicious hop aroma. Piney, a bit sticky. Sweet malts. Sweet then bitter, real bitter, but a tasty bitter. Perfect for an aperitif. Seriously. Medium bodied, smooth, a bit of a zest. My favorite beer in a can, currently anyways, obviously."
"I want to like this beer. But I can drink about one can before I get sick of it. A large dose of grapefruit with a lingering bitterness that just isn't pleasant. Hoppy, but not flowery to me. And not in the least bit refreshing. I like it less as I drink more of it. So maybe I'll just stop."
"Drinkability - Light enough to drink all night and the price allows this. It's been my session beer of choice for the last month or two and seems even more appropriate now that spring has rolled around."
"Pours a clear amber reddish colored body, with a good-sized head, white in color, and somewhat lasting. Has a hoppy aroma, with some grapefruit, medium strength. Grapefruit, sweet taste. Bitter. Dry, creamy, smooth aftertaste."
"The perfect carbonation and medium body lend themselves well to this brew, making it quite drinkable. This is the go to camping/tailgating brew...along with some old chub of course. Another excellend job by oskar blues."
"This has been one of my staples since I was introduced."
"the mouthfeel is a little metallic and a slight hint of alcohol burn, a little to much carbonation."
"Drinkability - This has definitely become a staple beer that I will keep stocked as long as I can get it. Very clean and refreshing. I am looking forward to many more cans of this."
"Poured a pale gold as one would expect with a quick dissolving head. Smell is of pale malts and light hops. Taste is balanced with a definite metallic flavor. Adequately carbonated. Drinkability is good if cans are the only option but nothing real special IMO. If I had to choose between any of their other beers that I have tried (Old Chub, Gordon, or Ten Fidy)this would be my last choice."
"Hey, this way pretty good, considering it came out of a can. Easy to drink, a faint weird aftertaste. Goodlooking pour, nice strawberry blonde color and nice lacing. Smells of grapefruit and heavy pale, grainy, malts. Has a nice kick of hops on the back, just lingers a bit. Nice quaff!"
"Pours a copper color with about a finger of white head. Loads of carbonation, which continues twenty minutes after cracking the can. Smell is of floral hops, par for the course for a pale ale. The first sips are piney, but not that pleasant because of an unusual, astringent aftertaste and mouthfeel. Oddly enough, I drank the first four of the six pack from the can and enjoyed those a lot more. I'll have to see if anything changes when I drink the last one."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0902-ScottR"
"Mouthfeel is alot thinner than I expected. Watery slickness coats the mouth. Goes down really easily. Tastes nice and balanced. Malt sweetness finishes with just enough of a hop kick to keep me sipping. Very well done PA, in a can no less. Recommend."
"D- For some reason I can't stop popping open the cans. A really, really good session brew. I had no problem killing the whole sixer in the middle of winter. I'd guess it'll be even easier come summer."
"Overall, not too bad a brew (better than I was expecting). I wouldn't shy away from it, but there's plenty of beers I would choose first."
"D: Very drinkable with food. If on its own... depends on your mood. In any case, it's best served cold."
"This is highly drinkable. I could make this my new go to beer."
"This is a total session beer! I could drink these all night. Pretty good deal also at $8 for a sixer. Definitely recomend trying this one."
"D - A very interesting take on the APA style... Memorable... I""m not sure this is one that needs to be in the beer fridge at all times, but it's definitely worth revisiting from time to time..."
"Rather drinkable, but at 6.5% it carries a little weight as well, merging into IPA territory. Quite the hop bomb as well, making it a great pale ale for the hophead, but for those used to more traditional American pales, this one may be a bit too much."
"RJ"
"Overall- Dale's Pale Ale is a very hoppy pale that could use a little more balance."
"D 4.0 - I dig the can appeal, but its still a great APA, $7 a sixer is not to steep, but weird price for cans. Go green, drink dales, recycle for cash, buy more Dales, full circle baby!"
"Overall this is a fine beer. I would lean a little more towards the IPA side than Pale Ale side, but for me that doesn't hurt a thing."
"At Barley's Taproom in Greenville SC. Cloudy gold pour. Very floral, small amount of citrus nose. Tastes similarly. Some nice maltiness, pine. Medium bodied, a little stickiness. Good clean finish. One of the best pales I've had in quite a while, not that I drink them all that often. I think I liked this a little better than Gordon even."
"D- Extremely drinkable and a little above sessionable but that won't stop me from drinking the hell out of this beer. Another great beer in a can."
"This was an all around nice APA. I wish the hops were a little more present in the taste, but I won't complain to long. I think cans just keep the hops as fresh as can be. Join the can revolution."
"Very nice, hazy amber oange color with a two finger head that fell slowly leaving some nice lacing. A nice fruity, citrusy aroma with hints of pine and light sweetness. Flavor of toasty malts, lightly sweet, and a generous pine and citrus hopping that creates just enough bitterness to finish out dry and leaving the mouth wanting more. Medium bodied, average carbonation. Very drinkable and pleasing. A highly underrated beer, IMO. Good stuff."
"Glad I tried it. Not a bad representation of the style, and there is a nice blend of flavors, but there are serious overshadowing spikes of dominant tastes here. Not the best balanced beer, but not bad either. Decent."
"D: Very drinkable pale ale. Has a strong hop character, but not overwhelming. Pretty good balance and a delicious beer right out of a can."
"Amber-colored and smelling of citrus and pine. Despite other accounts of massive heads, my glass poured with very little carbonation, and a wispy thin head. It did leave nice foam lacing down the sides of the glass as I drank. Somewhat thin on the mouth, Dale's Pale tastes like citrus hops, only a hint of malt. It's crisp and clean, quite hoppy. A great example of the style, and very refreshing."
"Aside from the subtly metallic mouthfeel, this one's pretty smooth and medium bodied. Could drink this one for a while."
"Heck yeah, drink this beer. Certainly a favorite for frisbee golfers and great for other outdoor activities where cans are preferred to bottles. Easy drinking."
"Recommended to those who like hops."
"This brew was interesting to me... It poured a nice amber/carmelized sugar color with a thick white head receeding to a thin line and somewhat sticky lacing. The interesting part is there was virtually no aroma to speak of. Maybe an ever so slight malty sweet smell. The flavor was a nice balance of malts and hops with a light floral note on the finish. A borderline amber ale. Medium bodied and smooth makes it a very drinkable brew."
"D: This is one hoppy pale ale! I could see this making an ideal ""everyday"" beer for the hopheads out there, which I consider myself a member. From the opening pour, and please do yourself a favor and don't drink this beauty straight out of the can, to the cloudy, almost orange appearance, to the lingering bitterness in the last drink, this was one satisfying brew. It completely blurs the line between a pale ale and an IPA. On second thought, I don't see how this is not considered an IPA, but I digress. If it weren't for the limited availability around here I would try to keep this around all the time. Highly recommend."
"D&Notes: Although this brew is classified as an American Pale Ale, its IBU and ABV easily put it into the IPA category. In fact, their website even says it's between an APA and an IPA. For the most part, I like this beer, as it is a good drinkable, big brew. At 6.5% ABV, definitely more of a sipper APA, but indeed, a fairly complex, interesting big APA."
"D: Other than the faint metallics in the initial sips, this is a fine APA that challenges the best of the bunch due to its careful crafting with no compromises on the amounts of hops and malts included in this wonderful brew."
"And so we had. But if you'd like to experience liquid gold... this is probably as close as you'll get."
"A good drink and pretty suprising from a can, though I do have to say I was a bit put off buy spending that much for a can. I wouldn't give it any awards, but I would consider it a sold beer and place it somewhere above Budwiser, but below Samuel Adams...perhaps somwhere in the Molson range I guess."
"Would get this to go camping, etc. but not for everyday drinking."
"Drinkability doesn't really fit for the style though."
"This beer pours a clear bright copper. Even with a rigourous pour, I got a very minimal bright white head to it. What did pour as a head, quickly disappated. However, wispy lacing marked the glass the entire way down. Smell is of mild almost muted hops, and also some sweet fruity maltiness. Since the smell was rather muted, I was pleasantly suprised by the bitingly bitter taste up front which then mellowed in to a fuity hop. I was greatly surprised by the solid nature of this beer - it's got a great bold body, and bitter hop aftertaste - very crisp beer. I was pleasantly surprised by this beer."
"D - A quality pale ale, to me this seems to edge into IPA territory with the hop/malt balance overwhelmingly favoring the hop. And 6.5%, I did not know that. No wonder these were doing more damage to me at the bar than I had hoped. I was going to guess this was more around 5%, so I was trying to session it. Easily drinkable."
"D: Pretty good; could have a few. Not my favorite pale ale, but definitely enjoy it for the style."
"Mouthfeel is sticky on the palate, syrupy. Smooth, leaning towards the creamy side. Extremely drinkable - a 6 pack of this will put me in another world. Great, cheap session beer if you're (somewhat) responsible about it, due to the ABV. Great beer."
"D: i could see myself kicking back around the campfire with this one"
"D: This is a very enjoyable beer that could be sessioned with very easily! Thanks to Philabeerphia for the chance to try this!"
"D: This beer is pretty darn good and I'll buy this by the case every now and then. they go down easy, almost too easy."
"Note - Oskar Blues has pretty much nailed it in most of their varieties I've tried."
"This is a great APA for a great price from a great brewery."
"Drinkability: I'm going to add this to my staple rotation. Not because it's the best I've had, but because it's a not so heavy beer that tastes pretty darn good and I can drink a few of them."
"If your a fan of the pale ales you'd be crazy to pass this one up. A smooth flavorful pale ale. I can't wait till Oskar rolls em out in Kansas."
"this is what i want in a pale ale - approaches ipa and dipa characteristics - the amount of bitterness is right - the abv is right - the tastiest beer in a can so far - looking forward to knocking some back when the weather warms."
"Wow - just looked at my review of Newbold, and there's a lot of shared comments. I think I was a little harder on Dale's because I've reviewed quite a few brews since then. It's solid, and kicks the crap out of most canned beer (other than Surly)."
"more balanced than some other very hoppy IPA's, this beer is worth your trouble seeking out"
"D- very easy to drink, and the can makes it able to be taken anywhere. another solid brew from oskar blues. i really wish i could purchase this stuff here."
"Very easy drinking APA. This is quickly becoming one of my ""go to"" brews."
"D - Very smooth and easy to drink. I'll have to try another (Maybe in the can)."
"Drinkability: Definitely not one of those wimpy, easy-going APAs you usually cross paths with. A very flavorsome, boldly hopped pale ale, but it still remains rather drinkable. Good work, Oskar Blues."
"a solid beer, just needs more hops. The can is great if you need to go camping or anywhere they dont allow camping, its nice to have a beer with alot of hops in it in a can.... but I would rather have a sly fox.... but I know Sly fox isnt avail everywhere"
"Poured into a pint glass. Large foamy head with a ruby/copper color and nice carbonation. The aroma of citrus and floral hops jump out of the glass. The taste follows same notes. Big bitter bite right up front and then the ""balance"" of a malty backbone. The body is filling. This has become my drink of choice on the course!"
"A solid offering from OB - one of my favorite breweries. I would say I prefer Gordon more, but a nice regular offering nonetheless."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"Dr -- Extremely so...not too sweet, not too dry, with loads of flavor and complexity"
"Overall: This has been my go to brew for tailgating this year. It has the right price point and packaging to fit in with the various other goodies in the car for the Ravens. It isn't the best pale ale in the world, but is a fine session brew that has done quite well for me."
"This I could drink all night, almost a session beer, but a little too high in alcohol, which is not a bad thing. Nevertheless, very drinkable."
"Color is hazy golden with a ton of fluffy, pillowy foam that sticks to the glass. smell is imitation vanilla extract, pineapple, slight grapefruit, and bittersweet hops with some rice vinegar. As it warms I am getting a bit of sake flavor with bitterness throughout - leaves a bit lackluster. I love that this is in a can which makes it so versatile."
"As you pour it you get a huge whiff of hop aroma.. glorious. A nice orangey color with not much head. Taste is very hop heavy (how is this not an IPA?) but lacks some carbonation in my opinion. Maybe it was an old can but tasted a bit flat. Regardless it goes down nice and smooth and is very tasty. Will be coming back to."
"Love the can... I thought that I was a beer snob against cans, but I think it is just that I'm against what is usually in those cans. This one is a big golden/amber hoppy, pale ale... not just pale. The aroma is cascade dominated, but the balance in the beer leads you to believe when they say they have 4 hops in this one. A bit heavy on the caramel, which gives a bit of english flavor to this... overall with the presentation, and the philosophy behind why they put it in a can- to give campers/climbers/boaters/hikers an opportunity to carry this thing in, and not leave trash. An honorable mission, and a good beer."
"Drinkability - Before Gordon (also from Oskar Blues), the best beer I've ever had from a can. For any paddler in the BWCA, I recommend a couple of cases of Dales for next season's expedition."
"Verdict: Dale's is certainly no slouch, but it's lacking just a little bit of malt to be perfectly balanced. To me, and apparently Oskar Blues themselves, Dale's clocks in somewhere between an IPA and an APA. One thing I can say for sure though, this is the hoppiest canned brew I've ever encountered, and that has to count for something."
"Over all a very nice beer to have available year round. It goes for 2 bucks more for a 12-pack than a SN Pale Ale, but the richer characteristics make that an excellent price."
"12 oz can poured into a nonic. Nice clear copper color, probably too dark to be called pale. Moderate ecru head leaves some sticky lace. Aroma is apples, grapefruit, and caramel. Initial flavor is all hops, with a sharp citrusy bite, followed by a sublime caramel finish which then melds into a residual bitterness. Very robust for a pale ale. Mouthfeel is a little undercarbonated, but the body has a nice heft to it and it's very drinkable."
"The beer had a medium mouthfeel to it, and it was not too complex for my palate. The drinkability of the beer would depend on what the advocate likes. To me, I could have a couple, but that would be it."
"D- This is an excellent Pale Ale. I would like to see a lower ABV as it'd be more sessionable. Still, I look forward to drinking this again."
"Craft beer in a can I never thought was possible but dale's proved me wrong. Pours a hazy dark orange that creates a nice white head that left lots of lacing. Has a pine and citrus smell with some grass and bisciut malt in there. Tastes very much like an ipa. Has an ipa hop bite full of pine and citrus, not too overpowering though. Malted to balance the beer nicely. Alcohol predent with a smooth finish. VEry nice and crisp mouthfeel. This beer is very drinkable. Would make a great session beer. I will get this again."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale amber-orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into decent lacing. The aroma is very big for an APA. Grapefruit, citrus, pine resin, and herbs. The taste is as big as the aroma. Tons of grapefruit and pine with a firm bitterness on the tongue and in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is one of the best APAs I have had. I would really like to have this available in my area, because it would quickly become my go to pale ale."
"Pours a dark amber color with tihn foamy off-white head. Pleasant hoppy aroma with nice malty balance. Very quaffable beer with a perfect balance of caramel malts and bitter hops. Not very pale and quite hoppy for a pale ale. Excellent!"
"Drinkability: Far from my favorite pale ale, but Dale's Pale Ale has a pretty unique flavor profile. Glad I have two cans, as I will be re-reviewing this one."
"Great session beer or converter beer. A real nice introduction for newbies."
"Overall I think this beer would benefit from toning down the strong bitterness to focus more on the nice hop flavors. Cans probably benefit this beer as I liked it better than on tap, and it makes it more memorable."
"The best beer I have had in a can. Very reasonable price for a great beer. Citrus, sticky, piney hop notes on the first sip of the hazy orange small headed pour. Great chilled for about a half hour in the fridge, nice drinkable nature, not to harsh able to have a good session. Catch up with you pretty quick."
"Always one of my favorite American Pale Ales. Just the right amount, and mix, of hops. Recommended."
"Thanks aubuc1!"
"The mouth has decent heft and a trace of oiliness. I wish this one was available at home to take on the boat!"
"Taste is medium hops with citrus and a little sweet. Someone dry or astringent at the end. Very nice beer that is easy to drink."
"The aroma has a light toffee and sweet bread background with big, sharp grapefruit. The hops take over with a crisp, near ripping bitterness and citrus rind for a very full hops flavor that's more on-par with an IPA (this beer does have 65 IBU's afterall). The aftertaste is long lasting with the juicy, bitter citrus flavors. This isn't a beer you'd soon forget. A must-try for hops lovers."
"Don't be afraid of the can. Try this beer, it is awesome!"
"D- A bit higher than anticipated, I am already thru 2 and it is not even 4:30 in the afternoonI may have found a new go to for the fall."
"T/M: Good mouthfeel, taste, again is very unique to me and folows the nose. A nice hop presence, and a lot of malt which is nice and helps to belance."
"Overall, this beer is quite big on flavour, even if that seems to be an excuse to push it to the IPA brink and hover. A prototypical version of an APA with hopes and dreams of style escalation, but still one mired in the adulation of its current station - oh, shoot. Still the best canned beer that I've had in recent memory."
"Wonderful-looking beer. Golden brown color with a thick frothy top. Aroma is a little mild but citrus and malty. Citrus flavors with a hop profile there from start to finish, although still managing to be balanced. The rougher side of medium-bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability is very good. Hops are not my thing, in general, so I'd purchase other things more frequently than this. Although I would gladly put this one into the purchasing rotation schedule."
"D: A crisp, lively and very drinkable APA that is conviently packaged in a can that enchances transportability while not hindering drinkability or flavor. Six pack worthy."
"i would drink this again. not sure it would be my first choice on a pale ale but i wouldn't think twice about reaching for one."
"D= Very drinkable, very sessionable. This is a really freaking good pale ale and one I will gladly seek out again!"
"Taste is sweet and biscuty. Very malty, rich and dense. So easy to drink."
"A very good beer that lives up to the hype. The tap delivers a well-carbonated copper hue with firm, froathy head formation and great retention- lots of lacing on the glass. A mild has persists, likely from dry-hopping. Aromas of abundant hops- a lot of grapefruit, orange zest, pine, and lemon grass. A firm malt backbone follows with low-lying sweetness and hints of bready crusts. Low fruitiness from esters and low phenolics. Flavors bring about a crisp malty flavor with low sweetness (only to balance). The hops are definately showcased with a burst of flavors like those found in the nose. The malts round out the hops with light fruitiness (kinda English-like only better attenuated). The body is medium, yet firm with a crisp, malty snappyness. Finishes with a clean, dry, hoppy note. On par with Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale."
"HV"
"Medium bodied with awesome drinkability."
"Dale's Pale Ale from Oskar Blues Grill & Brewery pours a very nice dark deep amber color with a fluffy 2 finger head. This beer has a great hoppy and malty aroma. Carbonation is perfect. While the beer has all the typical APA flavor with malt, hops, and citrus, I must point out that its main strength lies in its balance of all three. I find it to be very pleasing on the tongue with an almost creamy texture. Most interesting. It's the best beer in a can I've ever tasted although I had mine in a glass. A must try."
"If this stuff were half the price I would but it by the case; it's not bad by any means, just not spectacular."
"Should be kept in the can but if poured, you'll see a nice amber/orange color. The can really masks the smell of sweet, sweet hops but you'll get a whiff when you drink it. This doens't seem to be a very complicated pale ale but that doesn't make it a less impressive brew. Oskar Blues defintiely doesn't get the respect they deserve. This is a great beer. One of my top five pales. Pack it in, pack it out. Word!"
"All in all a beer that would never get kicked to the curb in this house."
"Sorry this isn't a ""proper"" review but there are MANY below to read. Thanks."
"This beer was outstanding and exceeded expectations! Dales pale Ale you have a fan in me!!!"
"One of the best beers I have had in a can. For the record I am a big hophead. Very reasonable price for a great beer. Citrus, sticky, piney hop notes on the first sip of the hazy orange small headed pour. Great chilled for about a half hour in the fridge, nice drinkable nature, not to harsh able to have a good session."
"12oz can from a liquor store in northern Mass. Pours a hazy amber-orange with a good half inch of off-white head. Smells strongly of grapefruit/citrus hops with hints of caramel malt. Tastes like citrussy hops first, with undertones of caramel and biscuit malt. On the heavy side of medium bodied with moderate carbonation - flirting with viscosity without hitting it or losing drinkability. An exquisite APA for sure - one I'll be drinking as regularly as I am able to. Good stuff."
"D- I love this beer, one of my favorite if not favorite APA, love it on a golf course or in the backyard. Hops come through so nice, actually enjoy this more the their Gordan DIPA offereing."
"The flavor is outstanding, the balance of hops and malt is right on for my taste. Sweet caramel, grapefruit, pine, with a nice clean finish. Very drinkable. Don't let the can fool you, this is good stuff."
"Pretty good pale ale, though not the most drinkable to me. Definitely worth a try though."
"This poured a hazy bright copper with a bit of light tan head. It smelled like strong orange and copper hops with light honey malt and some lemon yeast. It tasted like a sweet and bitter blend of orange, peach, and copper hops balanced with honey malt. It was somewhat thick with no carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a great pale ale with nice, clean taste and great body. It wasn't as boring or bland as most other pale ales. Another success for Oskar!"
"Overall this was a real suprise. This is a totally different type of pale ale that I'm going to call extreme, so almost an imperial pale ale. The maltiness and hops are both very bold and almost fall into an IPA catagory. Still it's a very good beer and amazing what OB did with it."
"Who needs frost brew can liners from the other Colorado brewery when you can drink Dale's Pale Ale? Go get this."
"D - This is the kicker. I could drink this stuff all night and not get tired. Took this, Old Chub and Maui Coconut Porter on a camping trip over the weekend. Boy, camping beer has changed!"
"I would have thought the hops would be more present on draft, but I have to admit the can retains the hop character much better. Very good on tap but I prefer this out of the can for the extra hop kick."
"I was a bit disappointed by this - as nothing really reached out and grabbed me, and I had heard so much about it. Though it's a well built pale ale, and true to its form."
"Take this one outside and enjoy. And as the can reads ""Pack It In, Pack It Out""."
"D: Damn refreshing. I like the metallic thing going on here. It really suits this beer."
"D: This is the only Oskar Blues beer that doesn't blow me away. I've tried and tried, but it's got that metallic taste that I find incredibly off-putting. Hence, drinkability suffers. Overall, it looks great and smells awesome, but it's all downhill from there. I probably won't be purchasing this in a can again anytime soon. I'll try to watch out for it on tap the next time I'm out of state so I can see if this flavor is from the can or the aluminum shards they add to the wort. ;-)"
"DPA is a good every day beer to drink, and an excellent pale ale. The volume levels are turned up in this in comparison to many other pales. Hoppy, malty, floral flavor and taste. Mouthfeel is medium, and carbonation is just right. A pretty drinkable beverage overall. I will be a repeat guzzler."
"All in all, a very, very good beer."
"Drinkability: Very good, very impressed. My second Oskar Blues beer and this one is better than the last."
"Drinkability - This was pretty solid and about what I expected. I could see this being a session beer if I had access to it. It's up there as one of my favorite pale ales as of now."
"Drinkability - I've loved every beer that oskar blues has offered up so far, but this one doesn't carry the banner very well. Do yourself a favor and grab an Alpha King, it's the holy grail of pales."
"Dales is a very good pale ale. It's definitely fun to drink a tasty beer from a can even if it is poured into a glass. It's a lot easier to deal with cans so I applaud Oskar on using cans. I like pouring from a bottle, but I pour everything into a glass anyway, so why should it matter. So besides my environmental lean, I don't think the can takes away from the beer. It is a very good pale ale. I have had their Old Chub and would rate it as the best Oskar beer, but Dales is solid. Nothing exceptional for a pale ale, but well above average. I have had a lot of IPAs and I would still rate this as a pale ale; the hops is not overwhelming."
"Pours a very nice dark amber in color, with a nice two inches of pillowy head. Very hoppy on the nose, the smell is very inviting and is a great start. Taste is very hoppy, but much more balanced than the nose lets on. Good hop bitterness, but enough malt to keep it together. This is a very easy drinking, solid beer."
"D - Hugely drinkable - grab some. A certain crowd pleaser."
"D ~ Given the choice between Ol' Chub & Dale's Pale I'd have to say that Dale's Pales by comparison in a side by side. BUT...still a worthy offering & an enjoyable CANNED BEER!"
"Poured light gold with a nice white. Nose is hoppy, fresh and malty. Taste had a big English malt profile with a big American hop kick. Mouthfeel was good at first but then English malts lurked arounf and gave up an aftertaste that was not to good. After half the beer it was so bad I could not finish and I LOVE BEER."
"A very well crafted APA, bordering to an AIPA."
"Not sure why they call this one an apa, to me its a solid malty ipa, hell of a beer though."
"M/D- Big chewy medium body, slightly syrupy, i don't think id say session-able but i find it very drinkable."
"edit: This get way better and less bitter when it warms up."
"Notes- This is a very enjoyable beer, and will be one of my top recomended beers for people looking for an easy drinking beer that can go anywhere."
"D- Easy drinking brew here. I did not hesitate to put down a few of these bad boys in a sitting. I was expecting more, but this was very good."
"Notes: Overall it's a very good easy drinking beer with plenty of flavor."
"Notes: A fine example of the style, and a must try for beer enthusiasts."
"D - Great to take to the beach in cans and all the Bud Light folks looking trying to figure out what youre sipping on!"
"This beer pours a nice light semi cloudy amber with a 2 fingered head with lacing. The smell is nice mostly of bittering hops. The taste is very impressive, perfectly hopped in my opinion and a wonderful malt backbone. Certainly lots of bitter in this beer and a nice nutty flavor. The mouthfeel is nice, might be a touch overcarbonated I drank 7 of these last night so I would say its rather drinkable"
"drinkability: good"
"Nice APA, easy to drink and a great option for a can beer."
"This is an easy one to drink down."
"Mouthfeel is wonderful, very creamy and satisfying."
"A good pale ale. Definitely worth a try, but not among my favorites of the style."
"Dales's saves the day!! I'm going to the drag races next week and only cans are allowed...now I can take a beer with me that I can stand to drink!! Yea Dales!!!!"
"Really drinkable IPA, I regret getting a 6 pack instead of a case now."
"EDIT: I had to add a few lines to this review. Having had a second can of this the following day, I had to increase my score. This is a damn delicious brew! Gordon had been my fav Oskar Blues offering but my mind is changed. This may be the best American Pale Ale I've ever had and that includes Alpha King. Its awesome!"
"As far as drinkability, I could drink a few of these in a row no problem on a hot day. It seems to just slip down the throat."
"By far the best beer I've ever had out of a can! The pour was a nice burnt orange color with nice head and lacing. Smell was mostly of toasted malts and caramel, not too special. But the flavor was outstanding! Flavor begins with the same toasted malts as in the smell but then adds in a great citrus bitterness that balances it our nicely. Finnish is dry and the carbonation level is great so I could see myself drinking a lot of this beer. Go and try some now!"
"Since three Oskar Blues beers have just arrived in TX and are getting pretty good notices I thought I'd start off with this one, and I'm not disappointed. Well, almost not disappointed. The beer looks good in the glass but the aroma is a bit lacking. It makes up for it in the taste though - There's a nice balance here between hops and malt with some very pleasant grapefruit/orange hints. The malt is well hidden but it's there, and it's not giving that icky sweetness that you can sometimes get. It's very well put together. Definitely one that I could drink all night."
"Pours a crystal clear golden amber with a medium off-white head. Smells of herbal hops. Taste is very hoppy, with a nice, juicy malt in the background. Nice citrus flavor as well. An earthy, herbal bitterness rounds things out. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation levels slightly high. Quite drinkable, this is a fantastic beer, though tastes more like an IPA than a Pale Ale to me."
"D: I have and will in the future consume copious amounts of this brew in a session. Very sessionable, very flavorful. Excellent brew."
"Drinkability- It is good refreshing beer. That I would get again."
"The feel is creamy and milky. Thick and chewy. Quite good. It's a tart and citrusy drink. A terrific, hop-fueled pale ale."
"And from a can. I had heard that Oskar Blues was hand-canning their products and I was eager to try one. The can opened without any soda-like ""hiss"" and poured thick into the glass. Not much head to speak of. Hazy orange color. Rich hops aroma in the nose and (wow) a nice fruity/spicy hops bite in the initial taste. A mildly sweet malt balances out the hops in a subtle way, but this is one nice hoppy brew. Surprising freshness from the can, too. Great taste and convenience. I didn't try drinking from the can, but it likely would have tasted OK."
"This beer pours a hazy orange color with a big creamy head. The aroma is sweet and malty with a fresh hop note. The taste is initially bitter with a real sweet malty backbone. Alcohol is noticeable but not overbearing. The mouthfeel is full and lush with a carbonation bite. This is an easy drinking pale ale - now I know what the hype is about."
"Overall, I give Dale's a round of applause and would gladly buy this beer again, and again, and again!"
"D- Good to drink, but the sour sweet tart taste is not what I was expecting."
"nice beer but not the greatest, this has a hoppy bite and a great malt flavor to it but it is just avrage, this one is screaming please put more hops in me, that being said i could see myslef enjoying a six pack from time to time but this is no searria navada pale, or southern star pine belt pale but it is ok."
"my only complaint is that it seems a little stickybrownsugary, but that could be a hop byproduct, as well"
"D: Ok drinkability. A fairly decent taste, but the thin and watery mouthfeel hurt it. Maybe it is better on tap, but in the can, it seemed like it hurt the overall consistency of the beer. Would have been better if the mouthfeel was a little bit thicker."
"Highly recommended."
"The style is listed as APA but this is a HUGE beer, with it's alc, heavy hops, and big malt I'd almost consider this a dapa - if there were such a thing. Either way, this is a great beer..."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't session with this the way I would with a Bass or even Sierra Nevada, but it's certainly enjoyable for what it is."
"Nice, even well-crafted brew that drinks very well. Sessionable for an outdoor gathering."
"By the end of this review my fingers were sore attempting to type so fast in order to keep up with the pace at which this beer was disappearing! I ended up finishing the whole can in no time. Fortunately, figuring out what to say came easy because, quite simply, I could just as well write about what I think is my ideal pale ale - because this was just that."
"Drinkability: This is a great beer. It is extremely drinkable, and could become my new every day beer."
"Dale's Pale Ale poured amber with a minimal head. It smells of sweet malts, tones of bread/grains, and hops. Tastes as the nose suggests, with a well-balanced blend of malts and hops; Dale's goes down creamy and smooth as well. Overall, this is an excellent pale ale and I am very glad I picked up a six pack while I was in Colorado."
"D: Super drinkable. Great session beer. When it first came out I was not sold but it is definitely a great beer. More proof that good beer can come in a can."
"D-Best beer I have ever had in a can, highly drinkable"
"Cheers..."
"Poured a dark orange in color, with an off white head. Head was good, that stayed until the end and turned into a nice lacing. A hint of citrius and hops in the aroma. Flavor was well balanced with hops, a little bitter. Mouthfeel was good, not watery but not very heavy. I thought that with the flavor and not being very heavy I could drink a number of these in a sitting."
"This is a lighter bodied pale ale that has good mouthfeel. This is an easy drinking beer that is a good beer for those breaking the addiction of macro-brews, a hot day or just relaxing. This beer is really as smooth as flashdance Hulk's chest on a hot day."
"Sweet, succulent and überhoppy compared to most american pale ales. Definitely does not adhere strictly to the style criteria. Dale's is twice as flavorful as most pales, but is not really a pale ale. More like a an IPA."
" This brew is delicious and drinkable."
"D: Highly sessionable."
"Amazingly drinkable, it's my go to beverage in beer-league softball (no bottles allowed)."
"Very drinkable, but you have to be careful since it's got a slightly higher abv than most pale ales. Great for places you can't have bottles like the pool and the beach. This isn't just a great example of good craft beer in a can, but also of the American Pale Ale beer style."
"This was a fun beer to drink. It had an orange color and a small white head. I've had six of these (not all in one sitting), and even with an aggressive pour could not produce much head. The aroma was mainly floral, but there is a malt presence also. Wonderful taste, with a great balance between the piney hops and the malt. Will be looking for more of these."
"edited for spelling (thats what I get for reviewing after finishing two of these!)"
"D - a great beer to just enjoy, grill with, or do whatever. Dale's is a classic and a good go-to beer. Pale ale you say? Ha, this seems closer to an IPA IMO, but I love it. Highly drinkable. Reviewing it from my notes is making me want to pick some up today for the summer weather haha."
"D - WOW this is good stuff. Drinkable anytime and very tasty. Excellent out of a can or poured into a glass. Generally I prefer to drink it out of the can."
"Overall, this beer has a lot of great nuances about it, and is also extremely refreshing. Not sure I would last past two until I had to switch over to something less intense, but great nonetheless."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are what sets this beer apart. Made me very impressed with this brew. On Tap at Hamiltons in SD CA. Nice smooth texture, has a weight to it. Smooth balanced finish. Very easy to drink. Minerals, and more malt than hop. Slightly hoppy nose. Subtle complexity. Really to eash to drink. I hope this texture carries thru to the canned version. I'll be seeking it out for sure now."
"Medium mouthfeel, probably leaning towards full despite the huge hop load. The palate is well-coated, but the finish is not overly bitter at all. Well done."
"D, notes: This is a big ass pale ale - bordering into IPA territory in my opinion. Almost too thick to be highly drinkable. That being said it is well balanced and well made."
"pours a clear darker orange, with a small white head. Some lacing but not much. Although I didn't get the impression of carbonation (not a big pop when opening can) the first few mouthfuls seem very carbonated. Smells ok, kinda malty with a few hops thrown in. Taste is cut and dry. Hops up front and a very quick, very dry finish. I didn't like this beer as much after warming, but its hands down better than any canned beer you can get in Chicago."
"I like this one!"
"The added bonus is it is at 6.5% ABV--now, how can that be bad?"
"This is a fantastic beer and possibly the new benchmark for the style. Excellent balance and unrivaled drinkability. This could be the perfect summer session beer!"
"The new can revolution is here ... has a wonderful sweet piney aroma .. glides down the throat very happily ... i love this beer.. Taste is very tasty and has a great clean finish, lick your lips and have another!! more breweries need to start using cans, ..and you know this ..man!!"
"D - JUST A NICE BEER THAT I KNOW I WILL FIND MYSELF DRINKING A LOT OF."
"Further review, August 2008. Wow, this is a darn good beer, and I would say the best I've had in a can. This beer has loads, boat loads of caramel, grainy malts, and just a nice sweet hop presence throughout. This is a very well balanced beer and a real treat. I'm adding points to my initial review."
"A very solid Pale Ale. Recommended."
"Drinkability - Very, very drinkable this is and will be a regular resident in my fridge. Highly sessionable. If you enjoy pale ale's or even IPA's I would highly recommend this brew for a try. Can't believe this comes from a can!"
"Poured from a can, served at Moan and Dove. The appearance was a little average: no real head or lacing; overall light brown mixed with amber. The aromas were decently well for a canned beverage: medium fruit aromas and hops. The taste was more sour in flavoring and lacked a hoppiness typical of a pale ale. However, its lightness in the hop department was relatively heavy for something in a can. And that is probably why I rate it high in mouthfeel: for something like a pale ale, the can helps it be light and refreshing. Overall, a little weak for a pale ale, but I was very impressed by the brewery's ability to make a drinkable pale ale."
"D: Surprisingly high. Taking down a 6-pack wouldn't be a problem."
"D - Eh, not terrible, but fairly average for the style. Add to that the price tag, and there are better APAs for your money."
"On revisiting this one, I have noticed what a few others have said... The quality control is bad. Some of these cans produced beer that was hoppier than a lot of IPAs. Some produced a pale that had a smooth butteriness. Overall, I would guess that there were 3 or 4 different batches out of this 12-pack, running the gamut of what the batches would taste like. I knocked a little off of the drinkability for this, as I would like consistency if I'm going to purchase this again."
"Hazy amber with small white head. The carbonation level is low, hardly even a pooft when I popped the can. It smells strongly of piney and citrusy hops and grapefruit. The taste is strongly piney. It's very aggressively hopped, to the point that this is really more of an IPA than APA. It's even more hoppy than some IPAs. The malt flavor shows through a bit as it warms up. Enjoyable, and kudos to Oskar Blues for the canning."
"Smells like malt and pine hops with a tinge of grapefruit. More IPA than pale ale in both taste and aroma, this is pretty much straight caramel malt with a grapefruit/pine flavoring. It lacks the tropical aromas/flavoring of my favorite pale ales, but still a solid offering."
"Drinkability is good on this beer. I Dale's would be a novelty beer in the can, but there is actually a nice taste to back it up. It has a very strong amount of hops and taste, but a good smoothness that makes it a good session pale ale."
"Dales is the real deal. I love this stuff. Incredible value, incredibly tasty, and...just overall incredible."
"D- Pretty good and I think I could put a few of these away and its kinda cool since its in a can."
"This has a buttery malt flavor up front with a dry hops finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, if a little thin, but very drinkable."
"A note on consistency: with all the talk of the can's ability to shield beer from light and air, this beer still has some consistency issues, as noted in the Bros. review. I have had cans of this beer with off-flavors, so I assume that originates at the brewery. For this beer to assume its rightful mantle as the great American craft session beer, these consistency issues need to be ironed out."
"Definitely won't be buying this one again. Lesson learned."
"Picked up a 6 pack at Whole Foods. Poured into a standard pint glass with a very clear golden color and a small head that dissipated quickly. Smells of sweet malt, maybe some pine, citrus and grassy hops. Flavors of caramel and light sweetness with a malt bitterness up front and some citrus flavors. Sort of one dimensional but nice. Decent light to medium body and easy to drink. Enjoyable, I would probably favor SNPA over this but I'm glad to try it for sure and would definitely get it again."
"This 6 pack I got was about $8.99, so $2 cheaper then Surly Furious. I'd go Surly any day over this one. I dont think I'll pick this one up again."
"drinkability: It's ok but I just don't see what the hype is about. The stuff is light and drinkable but I don't think it's anything special either. I really like this brewery but this brew in particular left me underwhelmed. I might need to seek this out again though just because it's so popular."
"Definitely one of those beers that among your massive collection of bombers and 750ml's and infinite single bottles, should be stocked as a six pack for steady drinking."
"Just above average drinkability. It's a nice enough APA, but the cloying bitter aftertaste gets tiresome from this ""Voluminoiusly Hopped Mutha..."". I'll probably have it again, especially if the canned packaging is an advantage, like packing a cooler, or doing a beer can barbecued chicken."
"D: Very good beer, bordering on IPA territory. Finally they came to CA, and their flagship product was certainly worth the wait."
"Love the craft beer in cans!"
"Mouthfeel, not too clean, the taste lingers for quite awhile on the tongue, but I enjoy the hoppy tastes."
"Theres lots of hype around this beer, but I think there are far better examples of American Pale out there. I don't think I would recommend this one unless you are curious."
"This is a very good beer that must be sampled despite some of the reviews to the contrary. I am very happy that I chose to by a six pack right off the bat."
" Despite the hops goin to town on my tongue, this is quite a refresing brew. probably wouldn't have another. Try it out."
"pours a clean amber from a 12oz can to a pint glass. smells hoppy with notes of vanilla and pale malt.very laced with light carbonation. taste is malt with hints of vanilla in the mix with a hoppy bite. a creamy vanilla hopped up weirdness. Seems lightly carbonated. this is a weird tasting brew. It has some weird vanilla taste to it that makes me not want to taste it anymore. I can't see drinking more than one of these. BLEEEGH I don't like it. Sorry."
"Pours a cherry pine color with a creamy amber-esque head that resides to a film across the top of the beer. Smell is sweet, bready, carmel, hints of finished by a piney, earthy hop presence. Taste is sweet, carmel, strawberry floral sweetness, hints of orange and a balancing floral hop that certainly accompanies the overall sweetness of the malt profile. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. I could drink these all night! Wonderfully put together. So simple that it might be lost in translation for someone looking for a bit more flavor, but definitely a very nice APA."
"Not bad. Not revelatory."
"This reminded me of a Sierra Nevada. Cracked the can, poured into a pint glass. About an inch of head, lasted about halfway down. Nice and hoppy, first one went down nice and smooth. Pretty good intro for some friends looking to get off the American Macro lager bandwagon."
"Dale's Pale is a very solid APA. Its solid flavor more than makes up for what it lacks in smell. The nose is really the only weak link in this beer's makeup. Otherwise, it's a pretty spot on for the style. I haven't tried the complete Oskar Blues lineup, but I'm beginning to believe they can't make a bad beer. Gotta love the can too. Classic."
"This pale pours a golden amber color and develops a nice one inch creamy head. It dissipates quickly but leaves a nice foam ring around the edges of the glass. Aroma is bready and hoppy, kind of enticing. The taste is much of the same only the hops take a much more prominent role. There is a slight metallic aftertaste which I presume is from the can. The mouthfeel is good with very light carbonation which makes me think this beer would go down very easily on a hot summer day."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours an orangeish-reddish color with a modest head. Smell is bread and hops. Taste is well balanced between the malts and bitter hops. Taste is pretty average though. Mouthfeel is good and the beer is exceptionally drinkable since it's a pretty average beer. Definitely a good pool beer."
"If you want to try a pale ale that isn't insanely hoppy or bitter, this is a good place to start. It drinks easy enough to be able to finish a sixer and your wife might enjoy it too. It's not spectacular, but one of the best beers I've ever poured from a can."
"Pours a clear golden brown color with a clingy off-white head that left some nice lacing. The aroma is of grassy and citrus hops, not overpowering. The taste is of hops; grapefruit rind, some orange sweetness, and piney. The hops are balanced by a bready malt with has some honey like sweetness. The feel is moderate with nice carbonation for the style. Finishes with a hoppy bitterness. A very nice APA, good hop and malt flavors and it come in a can. I prefer my hops to be more floral and grassy in APAs but the hops here are well balanced with the malt."
"Drinkability: Not recommended. There are too many good American pale ales around to waste your time with this one."
"This brew pours a copper color with a cream colored head. The nose has a big citrus hop presence which makes me think of this as more of an India Pale Ale. There is some malt, but it is fairly faint. The taste is also very hop strong with just a bit of sweet malts. Nice medium body. A fine brew, APA or IPA."
"D - I could easily put back a few cans of this one. A good higher alcohol session beer."
"12 oz. can poured into a pint glass with a thin white head due to an extra slow pour. Head dissipates slowly leaving moderate lacing. Citrus/pine aroma. Malt sweetness leads heavy grapefruit flavor and a dry crisp finish; a lot of complexity going on here. Good medium-heavy body and a highly drinkable, enjoyable beer."
"I'd probably buy some more of this, good for the hot summer day. Glad it made it to San Diego."
"O/ M - Great IPA. Light to med mouthfeel. Aroma and flavor balance well. Nice bitterness."
"Kind of like sweet iced tea. Bitter and yet a good sweet malty presence. Good balance, for sure. Not resiny, but otherwise a real solid bitter hop profile with mainly earthiness and florals. Not getting to much pine or citrus."
"Verdict: I really like this pale ale. It gets close to IPA territory with the hopping but it's very drinkable. I'm glad I bought a 6 pack."
"D. Tried a second to verify my thoughts.Very aggressive beer for it's style.I would definitely drink this one again.But not my first choice of this style."
"""Surf's Up!"""
"One of the best Pale Ales I've had (by which, I suppose, I mean one of the beefiest). Very hoppy, very malty - all in good balance, no off flavors - very tasty."
"When poured into a Victory pint glass, this canned beer is a golden blood orange hue with a small head of foam that was about 1/2 an inch in height and was a light beige color. It had great retention that left behind a small beige film and plenty of beige streaks of lace around the glass. What a great appearance! The aroma is nice and malty with toasted caramel malts, a splash of fruit, and then it ends with some lightly dry and bitter floral hops. The taste was light, but light in flavor. The taste was flavorful with toasted caramel malts, a pinch of grapefruit, and tons of bitter dried citrus hops. The mouthfeel was light to medium bodied with a great dry aftertaste of toasted malts, a hint of caramel, a splash of grapefruit, and some dry roasted citrus hops. What a nice little Pale Ale! It was light, but flavorful at the same time. This one clearly has session written all over it."
"d: To sweet for an APA, this one isn't for me."
"I don't get the hype of this one. Are they inconsistent with their batches? Is it better from the can? I may never know... but I do know that it was brutal."
"D : It's a really drinkable. I could drink a couple of these in a night with no problem."
"Pours out a caramel colored iced-tea body with some scattered carbonation and a thinnish head. Aroma is of fruity esters, caramel malts, and piney/woodsy/earthy hops. Flavor is a pleasant mix of fruitiness and caramel/tofee up front. The hops kick in the middle and give a nice, balancing bitterness that lingers on a while but never go too far over the edge. Very earthy and piney. Mouthfeel is moderate in weight, not at all sticky (although there is some sweetness to the beer) and has a mellow but assertive carbonation. Solid drinkability."
"Out of can into pint glass. Deep golden color with nice off white head that is pretty steady. Citrus smell primarily, but piney also. Sweet, hoppy, but malt also in there. Nice balance for a western pale ale. Dry finish, but full feel initially. I love this beer."
"This is a beer where it is hard to have just one. I'll say that it is a rich mans PBR."
"D: I could down a sixer of this at the lake, no problem."
"The color of the beer is a hazy almost orange color with an off-white head that left decent lacing down the pint glass. The aroma is dominated by the hops, pine and grapefruit citrus are detectable. Medium bodied on the palate. A slight sweetness is followed by a nice wallop of flowery, piny hops, which sticks around after the beer is gone. I like this beer. It is drinkable and pleasant, and works as a session beer even with the strong hop character."
"Highly drinkable, I could see me knocking back a few of these. great brew all and all"
"A mildly hopped beer in both aroma and flavor. The malt comes out really well with just a hint of citrus flavors from the hops. Even with an aggresive pour the head was small but a nice amount of lacing is left on the glass. Has a nice slightly hazy copper color. Dale's Pale Ale has a nice fresh body and good carbonation. ABV is slightly elevated to prevent decent sessionability but the can allows drinking this brew where a bottle would be impractical."
"I have always enjoyed this beer and it is one of my favorite pale ales. Old Chub and Ten Fidy are still my favs from Oskar but Dale's is a damn good beer and perfect for a summer session."
"Very tasty! I'm glad an American brewer has finally made an excellent hoppy beer in a can, available in Texas. This will be my choice for pool- and beach-side beers from now on!"
"great session american pale out of a mutha funkin can yo!"
"Among the best beers I've had from a can, but I've had better APAs (or is it IPAs?)."
"Finally got this in Texas, and the wait was worth it. Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. can. The beer pours a medium copper, forming a 1 inch creamy tan head, that leaves medium rings of lace along the glass. The aroma starts off with a piney hop aroma, but also contains a buttery malt aroma to balance it out. The taste is an incredibly smooth, well balanced mix of the hops and malts. The taste isnt the strong hop flavor that was expected, but more subtle citrusy notes, along with a creamy buttery malt flavor. Mouthfeel is much smoother, with the balance of malts. Not the harsh hop finish, but more of a medium smooth finish, but still with a hint of the sharp hops at the end. This is a highly drinkable beer, consisting of good ABV., well balanced flavor, and smooth finish. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, and will definitely keep a sixer in the fridge."
"Pours a deep clear amber, damn neer ruby color with a good white head. Decent lace. Nose is hops and some odd sweetness also found in the nose of Gordon, but obviously a bit more subtle here. Taste proves very good with awesome hop flavor and great malt balance. That odd resiny sweetness also found in Gordon appears here as well. The hops are mostly citrus and pine, but defenitely some spiced hop flavors in here. The malt presence is strong and profound, but defenitely does not outdo the hops. Very balanced, if anything I would say tone down the maltiness a bit to get rid of a bit of that caramely sweetness, but it is nice to see a pale ale that leans that way instead of the common west coast ""hop the shit out of everything"" mentality. Not to say that this brew is not generously hopped, because it is. Mouthfeel is good, quite viscous, could maybe be a bit thinner. Drinkability is fantastic, very sessionable. A solid and large pale ale from OB, one I would love to have available locally. Good beer."
"D: Not my favorite representation of the style, the bitterness was a bit too much for my taste. I love hoppy bitterness, not the grapefruit kind. Nothing wrong with the beer, just my personal preference."
"Extra points for the can! best beer I've had from a can by far."
"D - nice beer made even more intriguing to due to the portibility factor of the can...would drink again"
"This was one of the hoppiest, alcohol rich (in numbers, not in flavor) and, overall, most intense pale ales I have sampled. In fact, many IPA's are not as extreme as this beer. Although I might have preferred a bit more balance, this beer was highly flavorful and refreshing nevertheless. I would definitely recommended it to all the hop heads out there."
"D: Very drinkable. I could drink a bunch of this in one sitting."
"Drinkability: very refreshing, but not as much body as I would have liked."
"D: This was okay, and I'd like to give it another shot some time, as it has some interesting characteristics. A part of me liked it, a part of me disliked it, so I'll have to venture into it again to try to do it some justice."
"It pours a clear golden amber hue with a thick and frothy white head. It leaves great lacing on the walls on my pint glass. I can smell the American C-hops as I pour this beer. The nose has good scents of grapefruit, pine, and orange peel. The flavor profile isn't quite a vibrant as the nose, but it still has balanced flavors of flowery (at sometimes pungent) C-hops and a sugar-cookie malt base rounds everything out nicely. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation that is crisp and refreshing. The drink ability holds up very well, and I would reach for this if it were available locally."
"Pours a nice amber color with a finger of head that dissolves down to lace fairly fast. Limited lacing. A slightly foggy brew. Nose is lots of citrus hops and caramel. A nice smelling beer, that just sets you up for the taste. Tons of cookies and sweet malt, and hops all over the place: citrus, pine, everything. Feel is surprisingly thick, with good carbonation. Overall, a very nice APA; one that I'll get again if I have the chance."
"Overall a decent beer-kinda cool its in a can-but have had better in a can."
"Upon first sip there's a moment of malt sweetness followed by a tsunami of hop bitterness which gets pretty rough at the end. It's brief and is followed by more pale malt flavor. There's little to no carbonation going on here and that to me is reminiscent of a cask-conditioned ale, especially as the beer is allowed to warm up a few degrees. But as I drink I learn not to take too big of a sip, as that hop bite is rather unpleasant."
"M/D: Medium bodied, low carbonation. Really good drinkability on this one. A very solid pale ale."
"D: I loved this one but when comparing to the standard pale ale its flavors are a lot more bold and hoppier making in not as easy to put them away...but id want to sip this one anyway and enjoy it."
"Pours a small head that falls into a thin layer and a lacing. The color is dark gold/brown with a small red hue. Smell is aromatic bitter hops with a hint of caramel maltiness. Hops are slightly lemon citrus flavored. Taste is hoppy, more bitter flavors come out then citrus flavors. The aftertaste is a little sweet with maltiness that comes through after the bitter flavors hit your tongue. There's definitely good carbonation that lets you know it's there, but doesn't bite, but I did swirl mine a few times. Good medium bodied maltiness that makes a good sessionable beer. Overall, I could drink some good amount of this stuff, drinkable."
"D: 3 of these would be great. It's delicious, but I definitely am feeling it."
"D - Steer clear of this dangerous brew. Hops are too overpowering that lead to a super bitter aftertaste and something else if off from this brew. Avoid please."
"D - A nicely hopped pale ale from Oskar Blues that is quite drinkable and satisfying. Certainly worth trying, especially if like your pale ales extra hoppy."
"This beer poured out of a can into my glass a great golden color with a huge, fluffy, egg shell colored head. The head did not want to leave the party and stuck around til the end! Lacing was present thoughout the short life of the beer. The aroma was incredible. Great smells of citrus and malty sweetness. The taste was the same. Just a damn good beer. The mouthfeel was a medium body with medium high carbonation. Overall I was extremely impressed with this beer. I really wish we could get this product in our state!!"
"D: Too drinkable. I could stick with this as one of my favorite pales any time of the year (or day for that matter)"
"D: Though the bitterness can be a bit abrasive, I really enjoy this beer and always end up drinking more than I intend...I guess that makes it pretty drinkable!"
"D- refreshing and drinkable, the sweetness keeps it from getting any higher in this catagory"
"Other comments: The best beer I've had from a can! That old stigma can go away now, I think. This is a great beer regardless of its method of conveyance."
"D: A decent all-around pale ale, nothing over the top. A good session ale made more accessible by the cans."
"What a surprise out of a can. Recommended."
"Although well carbonated, the mouthfeel is a touch thin right in the middle. Hops oils beef up the mouthfeel on the conclusion. All-in-all a very drinkable beer and an excellent entry into the APA family."
"Overall: Nothing to get excited about; a competent pale ale with good flavor but hardly exemplary."
"Update: 15 Jun 08. Have had a couple more cans while and they have all had a buttery (diacetyl) flavor that I do not like. I know for sure that these cans are pretty fresh."
"Poured into a straight pint. Dale's pours a hazy, yellow-ish orange color with a nice white head that hands out for a while. Nice citrusy hop aroma. Very floral and sweet smelling. Obviously hops are up front. It tastes extremely well-balanced. Nice floral hop palate, but not overwhelming. The malts match the hops very well in this APA, eventhough it tastes more like an IPA. Nice mouthfeel. Not too complex on the palate, great carbonation level. Very enjoyable pale ale, one of my favorites."
"d: Good stuff. The hops say IPA, the ease with which it is consumed screams APA. In any case, it is a good beer and I am very fortunate to be able to get it only 1/2 block away."
"Well, this beer lived up to all of the good things I have heard about it. Don't let the red, white, and blue cola can fool you. This is a solid beer."
"Drinkability for me is not an issue. Finishing one of these is more than I can handle."
"D: I could have a few of these, though APAs don't go down as well as other styles for me."
"Drinkability is where this brew shines. A very upbeat, easy to take, IPA, quite flavorful. Overall a fine delightful ale, just the thing for taking to the pool where no glass is allowed. And I will be enjoying a fine beer instead of the very ordinary beer that usually comes in cans. I'll be getting more sixers of this! Recommended."
"Drinkability - I'm officially cool with beers in cans and I'm pretty sure this is going to kick off a trend (cheaper prices and easier storage are bonuses), so Sly Fox here I come! Oskar Blues also made a great impression and I can forsee Ten Tidy in the future. This is an excellent APA and one you should definetly check out if you get the chance."
"Much sweeter than I had expected, but not bad in general. Lots of fruit flavors.. apricot, peach, and a touch of honey. Didn't detect much hops.. not exactly a well-balanced beer. One that I enjoyed to try, but I didn't have more than one. Not a terrible beer, but I'm not sure that I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"Wow, good beer from a can! I was drawn to this pale ale in a can on my last trip to Colorado. The smell from the can is just great, I love a nice bold flavored pale ale. Hops are a big factor in this one. I fell so deeply in love with Dale's that my friends and I took a trip out to Oskar Blues to see how things were run. Have to say that they do have a few good beers, but Dale's has to be the best. Will likely hunt down Dale's in every beer store I go to. Too bad it's not in the Chicago land area..."
"Drinkability is high, a bold and nicely hopped pale ale with great malt presence and balance, the alcohol is non-descript and there is enough here to keep drinking all night long, i'm glad i have a second Dale's but wish i had easier access to OB here in San Diego. Oh well, maybe sometime in the future. . ."
"Thanks to DrBayern for this lovely can - Rich thick, orangish amber color with a good sized offwhite head and plenty of lacing. Nice caramel sweetness and pleasant hops aroma to it with a well hopped and richly flavored taste as well. Very appealing full mouthfeel, great balance, and the 6.5% is hidden well. Best beer I've had in a can by far, and I'd definitely recommend this one."
"A very drinkable, and flavorful beer, unexpected to me as it's from a can but there is obviously some advantages to the fully sealed container. Recomended and a nice change from the other pale ales I've been drinking."
"My pour resulted in a finger's worth of thick, deep-tan head with good retention. The nose was lightly hoppy with a definite pine scent. The color was a beautiful deep amber with NE-quality clarity. The mouthfeel was thin-to medium with a tasty hops tang in the mouth. The finish was where the pine taste that I noted on the nose really asserted itself. There was also a gritty feeling in my mouth after the swallow, which I will attribute to the drying quality of the hops. It was not unpleasant, but it was notable. This was the first of their four canned products that I have tried, so I wish to reserve judgment on drinkability for an update once I have tried them all. As a pale ale, it was pretty average."
"I think ol Oskar is getting way too much props for a beer that is too heavy on the hops for the style and unremarkable in taste. I'll give it another shot one day, but won't go out of my way to spend the sheckles on this offering."
"12 oz can copped singly from Buy Rite on Oak Tree in South Plainfield.. Top of the can boasts that this is ""A huge voluminously hopped mutha of a Pale Ale""... heard a lot about this brew, and with all the hype, I must agree that this is certainly a solid sample and an excellent depiction of the style... Pours a copper, amber, golden hue with minimal frothy head that dissipated after a minute or so... smell was complete with hop-like aromas - bursting through, very fresh, crisp, clean, and clear... I must say that this is a very drinkable brew... with the relatively modest ABV of 6.5% combined with its ultra-fresh and refreshing flavor, this is quite a depiction of an American Pale Ale... good, creamy mouthfeel combined with a hopped, vanilla, and bittersweet taste leads to a great brew... My first sample from Oskar Blues and I was pretty impressed with this one... the aftertaste is bursting with citrus, lemon, and fresh florals... goes down as easily as water... Definitely recommended..."
"Drinkability: I've heard a lot of non-craft and micro drinkers praising this, along with folks who are also BMC drinkers, and everyone's told me to try it. It's been years, and this is my first one. Thankfully, I can say that both were right, and I'm glad it's so readily available. The fact that a brew this good is in a can and does come from a can truly makes me think a lot of other breweries could pull this off, but I'm not sure why they don't try. I wish I could try the Ten Fidy, so let many of us hope it gets a higher distro rate in the future, if they keep making it that is. Next it's onto Old Chub for me, as I imagine, or hope at least, that it's as worthy as this brew."
"This beer pours an orange-amber color with a thick tan head with some decent lacing down the glass. It smells of medium roasted malts and some citrisy hops. The taste is just that. It starts with a nice roasted malt taste and then finishes with the citrisy and floral hops. The balance of those flavors is pretty good but not the best I've had. The mouthfeel is ok. Not as carbonated as I would have liked, but it was fairly smooth. The drinkability is pretty good as it is a decent beer and I could drink a few of these. The one great thing about it is that it tastes fresh from the can."
"Stopped into the Dugout on Comm Ave to meet some people, and saw they had cans on sale for $3.75. Grabbed one and poured it into a regular pint glass. Pours with a nice head that faded rather quickly. The color was dark orange, and the smell of hops was quite pronounced for a canned beer. The taste was pretty good, with just enough hops to make it above average, yet drinkable enough to not be a hop bomb. This is the kind of beer that I enjoy. A beer that has some hops, but not to overkill. More drinkable than other pale ales I've had, due to its smoothness. I'd definitely have a couple more of these in the future."
"Drinkability is solid, and its in a can, what a novelty."
"A very nice APA from Oskar Blues. So easy to drink and enjoy."
"Pours a orange/ amber color with a creamy white head. Nice hop aroma- citrusy, almost liek an ipa would smell. Good first sip, faily smoot with a subtle hop bite. Can really taste a nice cascade hop presence, but not overly bitter. Very drinkable beer, I think it may have something to do with it coming in a can. Kinda neat."
"Pours a orange-ish/ yellow/ copper color with a white head. In the aroma, big citrus grapefruity hops. In the taste, quite malty and grapefruity hops. A small bitter in the mouthfeel and a semi dry citrus aftertaste. Drinks more like an IPA, smooth with a nice citrus bitterness."
"Pours clear orange with a very thick off-white, foamy head. The aroma is heavy with citrus hops, with some maltiness in the background. The taste has a pleasing bitterness, more pine and grassy hops than citrus. There's strong maal backbone to balance. Mouthfeel is resiny, with a dry finish. A very nice APA."
"This beer seems to be all over the place in the various categories. Looks fine, smells mediocre, tastes ok. I like 12oz cans better than 16oz, and it's great to have another craft ale in cans."
"D - I enjoy a good pale ale so I could drink quite a few of these with no problem and the fact that they come in cans is a bonus."
"This is pretty decent and it's something I'd try again. I wonder how it is on draft? I just can't get over the fact that a beer like this comes in a can."
"Overall, a tasty, very balanced, and accessible everyday beer, and very economical given its high quality."
"Way too many specialty malts in this beer for the style, also too high an ABV. That being said, it's very tasty despite BJCP guidelines. I've had this a few times and do enjoy it even though it's a bit heavy and caramely for what you would expect by reading the can."
"I cant wait to enjoy more of these, what a perfect football watching beer. Would like to some time try on tap too."
"Okay, saw a forum post ranting about the stuff and happened to see it out. Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a honey-copper color. Half-inch head dissipated into a mere skim of foam; a little lacing, but not particularly abundant, although decent, thin adherence. Scent of hops and some citrus fruit. Taste similar to nose with a mellow, tart finish (citric acid perhaps) that lingers just a little too long leaving a bit of an aftertaste. Lively full mouthfeel. Pleasantly drinkable for a canned beer, but it is about at the end of my hops limit."
"M/D: this beer has a drying effect in the mouth which to a degree is nice, but i feel this might be a bit too much its not bad, but drops the score a tad"
"I am, once again, impressed with the can craft. Ready for more breweries to make the switch."
"Overall- Thanks to jhammerly for this one thrown in as an extra! I like this beer and love the fact it is in a can. That makes it more ""packable"" and very nice for tailgating, etc. Good brew and I will revisit it again soon."
"D - I enjoyed this beer I thought it was good but I think its a little over hyped its worth trying sometime"
"Pours a hazy orange topped by a small fluffy white head that eventually diminishes. Moderate lacing down the glass. Smells of piney, floral hops. The taste is a wonderful juggling act of the pine and floral balanced with a solid malt base, nice caramel tones too. Mellow finish that lingers, makes me salivate as I imagine the next sip. One of the best beers in a can that I've had."
"My opinion is unfortunately tainted because of my love for all things bitter. With that said, I don't know why there are a certain few that can't stand this beer. I would think it could harbor a mediocre review on style compatibility alone- this is an APA and tastes/drinks as such. I, of course, think that it's the best thing in a can that is out there, and one of my favorite hoppy brews overall. If you like hops, then this will double the size of your hop head. Sure it's unbalanced, but that is the appeal of the APA- an overhopped IPA. Am I right? And to validate my opinion, I had this beer on a non-hyped recomendation of a liquor store owner on my visit to the Carolina's- I'd never even heard of it before then. So, hyped or not, from a one hop lover to the next, buy a six and enjoy."
"Prosit!"
"Pretty good beer."
"drinkability  Too much hop taste for me, big for a hop head though."
"An excellent APA in a can. Nice copper color and hop aroma, though not as floral and citrusy as the more extreme hoppy beers. A solid offering by all accounts though, with a nice balance of hoppy citrus and pine. Bonus points for using updated can technology to enhance freshness and portability. I have purchased a case and a half of this stuff because it flies off the shelves at my local store. Noticed some consistency variations between canned batches, but very minor, and this is to be expected with craft brews I suppose. One 12 pack was a bit smokier than the other, but nothing damning. Though Dale's is good in the can, I have to say it is much better on tap to my taste buds. I want to try the Gordon IPA next."
"The can is a big plus IMO. Keep it up guys!"
"Here we go with the famed Dale's Pale Ale in a can. Pours a clear gold with a ruby touch. Good sized head that sticks around. Nose is very heavy on the hops with a strong sweetness. Flavor is *really* heavy with the hops. It's almost an overkill to me as it seems to be somewhat imbalanced. Too much in my face, I mean mouth. Just lacks a even flow. It's like the beer is yelling out, ""Hey! I'm a micro brew in a can! Woo hoo!"" Feel is a little lighter than I'd want. Overall I have to drop the drinkability down because the hops are too harshly over-pronounced and it lacks balance. Sure, they are ""pioneers"" of sorts by putting a micro in a can, but that is not enough to save the production. It's what's in the can that counts."
"D - This one was great (for a beer in a can). Glad I got to try it. If I get the chance...I will buy it again."
"Reminds me a little of mid-Atlantic region Clipper City (Baltimore) Heavy Seas Loose Cannon, and some of Manny's Pale Ale out of Georgetown (near Seattle), Washington State."
"As far as Oskar Blues goes, I've had this one quite a few times with the Old Chub and Gordan... even having the Ten Fidy (mega karma Dan) for the first time (from a can) about a week ago, and I say it doesn't matter a bit if it is in a can... this brewing company rocks."
"This beer is very good. I'm glad I tried it."
"Prosit, MK"
"I think this brewery's idea to skew conventional wisdom and serve their beer in cans is novel and necessary. After tasting it I'm not sure why more companies don't do it! This beer pours an amber color with a generous head. The smell is deliciously hoppy with an extra sugar kick. The taste is special as well, and for some reason you can tell it seems to come from a can. It gives it a certain crispness, but in now way cheapens the beer as a whole. The bitterness seems to take over the mouth and suppress any maltyness that would otherwise be apparent."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a long time."
"Overall a really well balanced beer. I paid $9 for a six pack so the can thing feels sort of gimmicky. Texture is creamy in a pleasant way, excellent hop flavors, head retention was a little weak. Nothing too fancy going on here but this is a quality drinkable beer. Reminds me a little of Bridgeport's IPA which is definitely a good thing."
"Moral of the story, don't fear the can."
"A Backpackers Beer!"
"D- Every time I have this brew, I wonder why it's not my everyday beer. Now that I can find it close to the house, it will be. The icing on the cake, it's also a great value."
"D - I think that this is a well built and tasty brew, but it may be a bit overrated. I think that good beer in a can is a great idea, and I wonder if this would garner such high reviews if it was just another bottled beer. I like this beer a lot, but the flavors seem a bit too odd to session."
"D - Goes down nice and smooth."
"Drinks great, the only discernible difference I see is less in your face. back of the throat hoppyness, but that actually works for me. A change for the better IMO for my go to camping beer"
"Beer poured an orange color with a beautiful fluffy white head that is leaving a nice lacing in my glass. Nose is of a generous dose of citrusy hops. Taste is very good, the floral hop factor is not too much as it blends in well with the malt presence leading to a crisp and enjoyable finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Drinkability is good. I could get very used to this APA in a regular rotation as this is one of the better ones i have had. I highly recommend this brew to APA fans."
"A really great all around IPA. This is one I will seek out again."
"Not a bad beer, but there are better pale ales out there. Of the Oskar Blues beers I've tried, this is my least favorite."
"A tremendous amount of character from a can. I know it is a respectable APA... it just isn't a style that I like in general. That being said, if these same guys come up with a stout, I'll absolutely give it a try."
"D--A lovely, easy to drink hop attack. I really like DPA and hope that those who have it before and was not happy with it give it another chance....hopefully on tap."
"I could drink this forever. If I was on a dessert island with 100 cases of this beer and somehow a refrigerator, I would be ok."
"With a pretty hard pour I got a good 2 inch head that slowly sank into a craggy pile of fluff which gave off a sappy hop aroma that was very pleasant. Piney scent is up front with very little malt presence in nose. At first the flavor shows that the nose promised, but where I usually expect a pale ale to either give me more hop flavor or open up for some complexity, the flavor just gives way to a watery finish. Its not bad, just not terribly satisfying. The mouthfeel is good for the style, and its certainly drinkable, but I wish there was a little more to it. I am left waiting for the punch."
"a very drinkable beer"
"Damn...without question one of the best APAs I've ever had. I'm actually quite surprised that its even considered as such. It really drinks like a pretty decent IPA. This would be great with a good cheddar, simple fare like burgers, maybe a rubbed steak, zesty fish dishes, etc. And from a CAN to boot!! Highly recommended, would drink again in an instant."
"This an almost ruby red sweet syrupy beer with a nice balanced bitterness at the end. The taste is simply delicious with notes of cherry, strawberry, and grass. Sometimes I even detect a subtle cocoa flavour which give it a little bit of that chocolate-covered cherry impression. The mouthfeel is smooth and little bit on the heavy side. It is my new every-day beer...The cans are very practical."
"I am willing to say that this is the best and most flavorful canned beer I've ever had. I've argued that canned beer would be better for the micro-industry for one major reason: The beer is preserved longer (no light-struck beer). I admire Oskar Blues for taking the chance with this."
"Citrusy esters and floral hop aromas of tangerine and orange rise from a medium-light brown beer with orange highlights. The head doesnt last but leaves a thin, clean froth of bubbles, some lacing and patches of foam sticking to the glass. Very clean, smooth malt flavors in the mouth, but the focus here is clearly the explosion of hop taste and bitterness. A dry beer with an emphasis on humulus lupulus, Dales Pale is quite drinkable and enjoyable for all, especially hopheads. I must comment once more about how much I like the canning movement. Environmentally sound and economically sound I imagine, I hope more craft brewers get on this and produce more killer beers in cans. Its part of beer advocacy. Show the world just how misguided the popular conception of this very refined beverage is."
"Poured from a can! Golden/amber beer, fluffy tan heady with lingering lace. Lively carbonation. Smells of a sackful of citrusy American hops. Taste is chewy, hoppy, with a great malt backbone. Perfect. Bitterness up front, malty center, with a nice, crisp, lingering hop flavor. Great mouthfeel...coats the tongue. Highly drinkable. A wonderful slap in the face for all the beer can naysayers. Easily one of my top-10 favorite beers."
"Comment: I may need to try this beer again in a few months. At first I was sure I would not enjoy this beer but it grew on me and I would like a second sampling to get a better handle on this strange beer."
"This was a tasty pale ale. Poured a hazy amber when cold but warmed up and chill haze turned to clear. A nicely formed frothy head that left good lace. The smell is a crisp citrus hoppiness. There is also a sweetness of caramel malt that is detectable after some of the hop aromas settle down later in the drink. The taste starts with a citrus kick and finishes with a somewhat abrasive bitterness that lingers. The carbonation is on the higher and more coarse level, probably teaming up with the bitterness to leave that aftertaste. It's not too bad though, and this pale ale contains quite a bit of flavor and doesn't skimp on the hops."
"Drinkability - all things considered, this beer takes good flavor and unbeatable convenience to make for a top notch session any time, anywhere."
"Did the can affect anything? Not having had the real thing on tap, I can't say for sure. But it tastes like other brew pub IPAs, so I guess it doesn't. Too bad I can't get this in Texas."
"It took alot of self-control to save a can from the six-pack for a review. Two weeks from purchase no less...now I need more."
"Drinkability: The taste is to metallic and it is way to overpowering. You can't tell when the can ends and the beer begins. Not at all enjoyable"
"I was expecting this beer to be more hoppy, but this is a great beer where the English malts shine through. It could have been a bit more balanced with the American hops, but no real complaints here. A great pale ale."
"Big thanks to jaxon53 for the exchange of canned goods!"
"Pours a cloudy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy off-white head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is very nice of hops, malts, citrus, and caramel. The taste is very nice for an APA, slightly malty, big on the hops, nice citrus touch, and a good dose of caramel, nice bitter/dry finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a nice APA."
"D - This is an outstanding APA. It smelled very good and tasted of amazing hops."
"still, impressive for a canned beer, and hope for others to adopt the same. not as aesthetically pleasing, but better for both the beer and the environment."
"Drinkability is great. I think this is a classic English style pale ale, not overly hopped with west coast hops, but well-balanced and malty. Quite a beer. Given the bold flavor and high ABV, bittering could be a bit stronger."
"Pours a hazy orange/brown, thick off white head forms, tons of lacing, great retention. Smell is very malty, caramel, citrus, floral, flowery sweet hops, maybe a bit old, hops are pretty subdued, smells like a hoppy brown ale. Taste is similar, super malty, caramel, grains, citrus, flowery hops, very assertive bitterness, nice and grassy in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, medium carbonation, very thick flavour, easy to drink, don't taste the 6.5% at all. Nicely done!"
"I was completely taken by surprise by this beer at the Empire Brew Fest during a recent visit to Syracuse. I'd never even heard of it before and it didn't look like much to get excited about, cos canned beer's crap right?...but a lot of people were soaking it up and since my mission was to sample as many different beers as I could, I thought ""what the hell"". Imagine my surprise when I found that it was the best beer I'd tried all night - and most of what I'd had previously was top rate. It tastes more like an IPA than a APA to me, but who cares...This is one fantastic beer and sadly I have now depleted my stock of it that I brought back to Florida. Yet another reason to move back North."
"This really is more of an IPA than a Pale Ale. Pours a hazy orange amber with a big stiff head and nice lacing. The smell has as much citrus piny hops as many IPAs. Medium bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated and primarily influence by the bitterness of the hops. Full flavored, the hoppy grapefruit taste is balanced nicely by sweet malt. A real god drinker. A bit pricey."
"look, this isn't the best beer I've had by a longshot, but it is excellent, and perfect for what I was looking for by the pool. Bitterness is up front, but not unpleasantly so. Lemon and grapefruit make big appearances, with the malt well in the background. I strain to decide if I detect a faint metallic taste here, but if it is there it is damn well hidden by this ""voluminously hopped mutha."" Pretty clean and crisp and leaves just a tantalizing hint of bitterness in the finish. Carbonation and body are medium and I could drink several (more) of this extremely refreshing brew and probably will."
"Truly a well-made beer. I'm sorry I only purchased one can."
"A nice retentive head, exceptional caramel malt flavor, and superbly balanced hop bittering... does it get any better for APA lovers? It's strange to open a craft beer from a can, but the hop aroma that sifts out is amazing. The 12 oz can was just like I remember the draft when visiting the brew pub."
"D. This is a great session beer! Even without regard to the can novelty, this is a great APA! This would be graded as high in a bottle even. I will be returning to this beer as soon as I can get some more."
"Easily the best canned beer in America, and a contender for the best American IPA, especially in terms of the elusive drinkability-hop flavor combination. Similar to Dogfish 60 Minute but even crisper and more fun in the can. This is a true desert-island brew: the one you'd want, and a good way to introduce novice beer folks to the better stuff out there. Somehow they are less intimidated by a can than big bottles with champagne corks. It's a great summer thirst-quencher and also kicks ass with anything grilled or barbecued. I just made myself thirsty."
"Heavy mouthfeel- creamy, silky, and full bodied. Nice beer and very drinkable, that being said I prefer APAs to have a bit more hop flavor, less alcohol and a lighter body."
"first off, this is the best beer i've had out of a can. i had the pleasure of drinking this on the lake while i listened to some fat fuck extolling the virtues of ""the silver bullet"" vs. miller lite. ugh. anyways, more on the side of malt sweetness than surly furious. this beer has some qualities that are reminiscent of the great alpha king as far as aroma and flavor. this was a rich copper in color with just a tinge of haze and an off-white head. aromas of caramel malts and citrus are prevalent in the nose. nice malt sweetness and a resiny, lingering hop bitterness make for a very well-balanced and bold apa. creamy carbonation and a light to medium mouthfeel. this is a great beer for summer activities due to it being in a can, and damn tasty as well."
"Recommended"
"A very tasty pale ale that is extremely drinkable. The abv's a little high to make it a session beer, but it's definitely hitting the spot and will be purchased again."
"Overall: This is a nice beer to turn to on them hot summer days. The can lets you take it anywhere you want to go. Also because of the aluminum its get extra cold in the cooler. Pop this one open at the beach on the hottest most humid of Florida days and you are in heaven. Oskar Blues make some good tasting drinkable brews. Have had the entire lineup, now I need to get around to drinking them again so that I can review them."
"Medium body, nice carbonation, this is a nearly perfect APA."
"D- This is a drinkable ale with an enjoyable taste. I think of it more as an amber ale than a pale ale. Well done and something I will have again."
"D - A fine pale ale, but a bit more bitter than I would prefer. There is plenty of flavor from malt and hops and this is above average as far as drinkability goes. It is potent for the style."
"D - I bought a six pack of this the night before I head to Mississippi to see relatives. I am looking forward to drinking several of these lounging in the Bogue Chitto River. Very drinkable."
"Very drinkable for its abv. Overall, a fantastic pale ale! Once again Oskar Blue's shows off their sweet cans!"
"pours a copper orange color with a nice off white head that leaves a lot of clumpy lace. hoppy, pineapple aroma. much hoppier than your average pale ale. taste is a little bitter, very hoppy and i can't tell if it's minerally or metallic. nevertheless, i love it and am very impressed. goes down creamy and a little bitter like a pale ale should. this is my bbq/session fav."
"12oz can in colorful red and blue. Popping the tab unleashes a sticky froth no matter the amount of rest you give it before opening. Happened to all six in the pack. Looks great in the glass and is a very inviting orange-amber. Smell is also very inviting as it is a masterful use of dry-hopping. Taste is everything I want and look for in an APA; sweet, fruity and sticky caramel malts balanced by tons of aromatic domestic hops. Mouthfeel is wonderful because of the fine-bubble subtle carbonation due to this beer being can(?)-conditioned. If I could get this beer in my area I would drink it all the time and stock my fridge with it."
"Drinkability is a bit diminished for me due to the pine-bitter bite, but it's still quite enjoyable. Not the best of the Oskar Blues bunch, but solid and worth a try."
"The beer was semi-hazy and an auburn shade of yellow. The aroma was nicely hopped, kind of reminded me of Alpha King (no side-by-side comparison though, and I was slightly buzzed at the time). The taste was well-balanced, but more hoppy than malty. Extremely easy to pound, chug-a-luggable. Very good gateway beer I think, but able to keep your interest deep into the ""hobby"" (addiction). Nice beer."
"Notes: I think this is pretty darned close to IPA territory, and like I said, the nose at first blush even seems strong enough to remind me of a DIPA. Great beer in a can. Check it out."
"First taste is a creamy pine flavor from the hops, mixed with a grapefruit/mixed citrus bag. It sticks to the roof of your mouth, almost chewy, pleasantly surprising coming from a can. Grab a sixer and head to the game and do some tailgating."
"I'm giving some high numbers for taste and drinkability, not because this beer's got over-the-top hops or rich and complex flavors but because this beer seems to push the style envelope to a respectable degree without going overboard and ends up with a good representation of the style. And it is pretty tasty and it is pretty drinkable."
"Pours reddish/peach colored with a slight tannish head. Odor is caramel and malts with a vague hop spiciness. Taste is very refreshing. Tasty maltiness with hints of orange or grapefruit and a grassy bitterness on the finish. Maltiness is reasonably aggressive for the style. Medium bodied. Another good beer from Oskar Blues, but give me the Gordon everytime please."
"Full body, with appropriate carbonation. A bit of metallic taste is my only complaint. Other tha that, this is a very solid APA. Love the can."
"D-Hell of a beer....borders on IPA land....really finishes dry...If you want an assertive, juicy, flavorful APA with a nice balance of biscuity malt then this is your beer. If not look elsewhere..."
"Overall a very good pale ale. Lots of hops and decent balance. I wouldn't say it's as good as 60 Minute or Titan, but it's darn near close."
"Great Job Oskar Blues!"
"Overall though, this beer gets bonus points for one arguably trivial thing: it comes from a can. There's something about grabbing a can of beer out of an ice filled cooler, and the fact that this beer is great on its own right and utterly unbelievable for a canned beer elevates it above the crowd in my opinion, and gives it a permanent place in my fridge."
"Well the taste isn't as big and full as I remembered from the othernight (I had a few before trying this). However this is well balanced and very malty. Caramel and toffee melt together into a thick sweetened deliciouthon. Hops are somewhat subdued yet balance the malt just enough on the finish to keep the RS from being cloying. Piney and a bit resiny on the mid palate with a good bittering hop on the finish. Not much in the way of fruit. Mouth is nice, round and chewy."
"Mouthfeel is fine, with carbonation on the higher end of the scale, which helps cut through the maltiness. Drinkable, but just not my preferred expression of the style. Can 5 of a six pack."
"Pours a rich deep amber ale with a thick head that holds for quite a while. High notes of cascade hopps and a twindge of heavy malts. Pineapple and other fruity flavours come about through my quest of this fine ale. This is a dam fine beer cosumed by the glass or out of the can especially out on the golf course.This beer will fit quite well in my beer Koozie.Props to Oskar Blues for this beer ."
"Good looking beer. Clear copper. Thin ivory white head. Sticky lace. Nice hoppy aroma. Grapefruit, citrus, lemon rind and hop resin. This all carries over nicely on the palate. Bright citric tones of lemon zest and pink grapefruit pulp. Citrusy and a little bit piney. Malts are in the background, but they're there enough to provide balance and that's about it. IBUs are noticeable as the clean bitterness lingers nicely. Crisp and refreshing feel to this beer. Medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Easy drinking tasty APA. Ranks right up there with SN and Summit for everyday drinkers. Shall be good on the golf course."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale amber with a thin frothy head. The aroma is citrus hops and sweet malts. The taste is a great balance of caramel malts and earthy citrus hops with just a hint of pine. The beer is light, crisp and refreshing with mostly hidden alcohol. This is one of my favorite Pales."
"I could definitely drink a whole sixer of this at once, but my palate would be in ruins for a while afterwards. Overall, it's a nice pale ale, and you can do a whole lot worse. The novelty of canned craft beer won't wear off soon either."
"D: The fact that this comes from a can is fantastic - no reason it shouldn't, but your brain tells you otherwise. Good tasting, hoppy, flavorful and easy to drink at 6.7%. This is a great beer."
"Appearance copper orange hue large fluffy off white orange beige tinted head, very good retention going on with thin lacing between sips a bit sporadic. Aromatics mild citrus upfront pine mild biscuit malt sweetness overall very nice, pale ale. Flavor holds up nicely in the can I'm liking the floral, pine, and citrus hop flavors with light malts giving a biscuit bread sweetness to balance it all out this highly drinkable pale ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied even solid carbonation goes down really easy with some slight oily resin feel going on. Drinkability, is great get some for the ball game or concert good for an all day afair."
"D: Excellent drinkability, enough flavor characteristic packed in to have you reaching for a Dale's Pale anytime. Quite versatile, with so much in every category that it's hard to turn one of these down. At first I was a little skeptical, even after checking Oskar Blues out in the BA mag, but one sip was all it took to convert me. More craft beer in cans!"
"Taste is bitter and has some light roasted, nutty and caramel tastes. The yeast give a light fruitiness, which complements the semi-agressive citric, mostly lemon hops. Balance is always the key with APA's and this one is great balanced. Body is medium and drinkability is great."
"Overall: A decent American Pale Ale in a can. Nothing more, nothing less. Worth a try, especially if you like hoppy beer."
"Full bodied, with a creamy kinda feel. Toast, nutty malt, some mellow pear fruitiness, moving easily into a surprisingly hoppy finish. Packed with citrusy, resiny hop flavor. Some yeasty nuttiness, kinda like walnuts, lingering with grainy sweetness and grapefruit in the aftertaste. Kinda doughy and yeasty feeling, almost brown sugary. Really enjoyable. Super rock solid canned goodness. I could drink tons of this stuff week after week."
"My first foray into Oskar Blues. Wish they distributed to Illinois cause I'd love to try a few more of their offerings. Overall, Dale's Pale is a flavorful, and hoppier than most pale ales. After drinking a few of these from the glass my opinion is Dales Pale actually tastes better straight from the can."
"I had this on tap at the Falling Rock. Hazy amber in color with a nice rocky white head. Smell is a little floral hops. The taste was not as hoppy as I remembered in the past. It was still very good with a very nice caramel malt taste.This is a very good beer."
"Color was a bit darker than I expected, and was a good amber color with a decent amount of head. Aroma was faintly but pleasantly hoppy. Flavor was a somewhat malty for an APA, which balanced its hop character. Mouthfeel was a bit watery. In total, I thought this beer was pleasant, and the best canned pale ale I've had (and I would buy it for occasions when bottles aren't appropriate), but I didn't find it to be much above average."
"D- It is pretty good. Once again don't think it is anything amazing. So far this brewery has let me down."
"Clear copper body and decent wet head that dissipates to cap in about five minutes. Lacing is thick and adhesive. Nose is piney with medium bitterness. Taste is round and mellow with smooth, late breaking bitterness. No special flavors, kind of a no-frills pale ale with heavy but not overpowering hops. Still, it''s well done. Carbonation is a little over the top but otherwise this is a good everyday beer for hopheads. Slight metallic tinge isn't totally unexpected. This is worth trying and worth drinking for any hophead or general beer fan."
"Drinkable enough, but not my favorite from this style."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a thin but foamy white head that leaves fingers of lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet, citrusy hops and is quite pleasant. The taste has a slight sweetness up front, followed by a citrus hop tinge and then finishing cleanly bitter. This is very hoppy for an APA, but pleasantly so. Texture is slightly creamy and lacking carbonation compared with others of the style -- this may come from canning? Overall a very solid Pale Ale that is a mainstay in my rotation."
"Had this on tap at Porter's Pub in Easton, PA. Having never heard of this beer previously, I thought I'd give this a try. Appearance is a dull copper and smell is that of citrusy hops. Taste is good, not overwhelming, but a nice floral nose with a mildly hoppy finish. ALl in all, not as good as the standard of the style, SNPA, but a very drinkable brew."
"Drinkability: The initial metallic taste does mostly wear off, but that was quite strong for a first taste. Other than that, the drinkability is not bad."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with medium carbonation. Seems just right for the style. Nice overall."
"D-Avery easy drinking brew. i was somewhat skeptical thinking this was some sort of gimic but its surprisingly good."
"Poured a can into a pint glass, pours a amber copper color with a head that leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is pretty amazing very hoppy and sweet additioins in there smell, like warm bitter apple pie just tacken out of the oven. Taste is simply awesome very bitter and in your face just how I like my apa, very weedy and a bit bready I can taste a bit of candy in there as well maybe like lemon head. This is awesome that we finally got Oskar Blues in Florida and for 7.99 a sixer you can't go wrong."
"Nice all around flavor, nutty malt, light touch of roast, and alot of hop bitterness. It starts off smelling like an IPA, but definitely tastes like an American Pale. Pretty good from a can..."
"Incredibly easy to drink considering the 6.5% alcohol. Sessionable, although intoxication would certainly be the end result. A very tasty and refreshing hoppy pale ale. Would make a great stepping stone to the american IPA style, but certainly stands on its own as a solid example of the american pale ale. Looking forward to the chance to have more than one of these. Best beer ive had so far from a can, and Surly will have to be damn good to take that title once i have the pleasure of Bender or Furious."
"Drinkability - smooth and easy to drink"
"Had the Gordon and that is a winner too . Cheers to the Oskar Blues Brewery ."
"D- Very refreshing beer, could drink this everyday. Quite a remarkable beer, not used to beer this good coming from a can. Shows that it can (bad pun) be done. Better than other craft beers I have had in cans."
"Oskar Blues have been leaders in the current beer-from-a-can renaissance, and it helps that their beers kick ass too. Would be nice to see more brewers do it (and cans are far more earth-/recycle-friendly than bottles). A very worthy pale ale in a sea of pale ale choices."
"Poured into a glass to get the full effect-from here on out I will probably just drink it out of the can. Very nice copper color with a decent sized head. Nice hop aroma against a healthy dose of toasted malt. Big hop bite to it, though it has a great, sweet malty backbone to it as well. Very nicely balanced actually. Good mouthfeel. Overall I am very impressed. I had tried the Old Chub at the last Extreme Beer Fest I was at and thought it to be great. This is a huge step forward in my book. What I worry about is the 6.5% abv. On a hot summers day when the BUD is going down like water this could catch up to you in a hurry if you over do it. Anything in moderation right? Great to see great beer in a can. Wish more breweries would do it."
"Poured a pleasant slightly cloudy golden colour with a nice, frothy white head. Hoppy aromas abound immediately out of the can. Excellent American pine/citrus hop aroma, plus some coffee-like malt in there for balance. Taste: ditto. Slightly oily but very solid mouthfeel, and a tangy but short-lived aftertaste with notes of caramel. Loved it, could drink it all day."
"Thanks a lot todd1 for sending me this, I want more!"
"Generally a tasty beer and easily bests just about anything else in a can if you want to go backcountry with it or drink it on an airplane. Still, I can't say it's as good as some other AIPAs on the market, but only a notch below and probably because of personal tastes in the style. I'd certainly have it on hand to supply to guests and will drink it again anytime it's available."
"This is a beer for hops fans! Color is a lovely dark honey brown with a nice thick head. Aroma is invitingly hoppy - one good whiff and you know this is no wussy brew. Flavor is strongly hoppy, and mouthfeel is zingy and tingly. I like hoppy beers, so I found this one to be very enjoyable."
"Note: Dale's is the only beer from outside NY state that is served at The Smoke Joint, the new awesome BBQ place in my neighborhood. Apparently it's the favorite beer of one of the owner/chefs, and, ""if you can't have your favorite beer at your own restaurant, what's the point?"""
"Overall an impressive and very drinkable Pale Ale tipping a bit towards IPA territory. Being in a can adds some novelty to the experience, but this is a completely solid offering besides. As elegant as bottles are, you cant argue with the practicality of cans and I hope to see more breweries canning in the future."
"pours a nice opaque orange amber color with a off white tight bubbled two finger head with a very easy pour. good retention, holding to a quarter inch and a nice sticky lace to the finish. smell is of floral, citrus, piney aromas. taste big bready malts folowed by slighty citrus bitterness ending with piney hops. drinkability is great but at 6.50 % abv i would have to watch how many i drink."
"Pretty drinkable."
"D: True session brew. A bit more sweet and malty than most of the pale ales I have tried, but highly quaffable none the less. Worth a try!"
"and thats a good thing. I could definetly see myself picking up more six packs in the future and if the Gordon becomes more available along with a lower price they both could have full time spots in my fridge."
"Wow- wasn't expecting this type of taste out of a can. Maybe my scores are a little high because this suprises me so much. This is a solid beer, with a well balanced pale ale taste. Not to mention the poor out of the can is great as well. Cheers to this beer!"
"Pretty sure i need to try this again from a different source. Not that it is all that bad, just not what i would expect from a ""huge vohminoulsly hopped mutha of a pale ale"" I slightly heftier hop profile would lift this beer into the excellent category."
"A good looking beer. Pours nicely into a glass with an amber color and average head. Medium amount of carbonation that isn't too much by any means. Smells pretty hoppy with that pine characteristic that I've come to love. Darn good taste and mouthfeel here that are somewhat surprising for me personally. I definitely enjoy this beer and could drink many if I had the chance. I'm glad I know where to find this because I'll probably be picking some up in the near future."
"Taste is as good as the aroma, something I haven't often found to be true of pale ales. Same delicious balance of carmelized malts and foresty hops. Mouthfeel has a good carbonation level, it's juicy and crisp with an aftertaste that falls a bit flat but still succeeds for the style. Overall, this is definitely a drinkable beer. Goes down easy and keeps the senses entertained."
"This is one hefty APA; more like an American IPA in all respects. The OBs beers are certainly a bit pricey but so far for me this ones a winner and worth the $$$."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass from a can. l still can't believe good beer can come from a can! Poured a somewhat hazy, reddish auburn color. About one good finger of tight frothy head rose from the glass. Head dissipated rather quickly and left little lace. Smell: Hops! Tons of hops in here. Plenty of citrus (Grapefruit, orange, maybe some lemon zest.) Tasted again of bitter hops, balanced out nicely by the sweet malt. Tons of citrus and pine here. Very nice flavor. Moderate amount of carbonation. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and well balanced. Drinkibility was great. Will definitely get more. One of my new favorites."

"Anyway, it was suprizingly tasty, especially for a pale ale. Nice color, good appearance, very expressive nose. The taste was the selling point - a whole lot of hops going on, but they are well balanced and compliment each other nicely. Extremely drinkable, at least for a hophead such as myself. Can't wait to track it down in cans..."
"I'm not afraid to say it, I prefer bottles to cans. I don't know the advantages or disadvantages of each specifically, but I do know that opening a bottle has a better sound than a can. Once I pour it into a pint glass though, it looks much better. There is a thick white head on a crystal clear amber body. There is a surprising caramel aroma that is actually more powerful than the piney hop aroma. The caramel flavor is very present in the flavor as well. The initial flavor is mostly caramel and biscuity and then the hop bitterness comes in to play. The bitterness isn't accompanied by any real hop flavor though, so the balance seems off and it is really bothering me. Also, according to the BJCP, APA's shouldn't have much caramel flavor. Going with the ""Style be dammed"" train of thought, I would have to say that the only thing I can hold against this beer is the hop imbalance, but I'm not crazy about it."

"Ahh, my first canned beer in years, I was a bit nervous how the taste would hold up versus a bottle. I was very happy with the results. First off I did not think the can would pour as well as it did. Beautiful rich orange color, with lots of haze, and visible streams of carbonation coming up from the bottom. Big white, frothy head slowly faded to leave about a half inch that stayed until the end. Big time sticky lace all down the glass. Smell was very crisp, lots of citrus flavors and some hints of grass or fresh leaves. As it warmed some more grain and earthy bread like smells became apparent. The taste was very light, crisp, refreshing. This beer absolutly screamed sessionable at me, could drink this year round anytime of day, was perfect with dinner(ham) and just very enjoyable. Taste was predominantly the hoppy side, grapefruit and pineapple as well as hints at some pine freshness. This was balanced out very nicely with hints at grain and yeast flavors. I actually detected a bit of green apple too which was very nice. Big dry finish with a long lingering bitter aftertaste made this a keep. I was very happy with this brew and will not shy away from the can. I actually think more beer could be in cans, as it seemed to make for a better pour, and shipping and storage were much easier. Overall a winner and looking forward to trying the rest of the line."
"Good APA all around. Well balanced taste that keeps you drinking. Well worth trying."
"Overall, I enjoyed it very much. If the ABV was closer to 5%, this would be a fantastic session beer. As it stands, I will just have to enjoy shorter sessions! A nicely hopped pale ale."
"Poured into a standard pint glass straight from the can. It had a nice rich amber color with a foamy head of about 2 inches. The aroma was a mix of floral and citrus. The taste was very surprising considering it was from a can. A nice big hoppy flavor that would satisfy the hop heads. I had a couple of these and its one I will go back to. I was told by the owner (Frank) of the bar I was visiting (Pitchers Pub) that this would soon be on tap. Ill be looking forward to it."
"Orange amber color with a big frothy white head. Sticky trails of lacing on my glass. Smell of some piney hops and a solid grainy background. The hops gives a burst of taste up front that is quickly covered by the malty grainy taste. Taste finishes dry with some hop bitterness. The hops on the finish is a little on the bitey side and not just that solid piney note that i love. At 6.5% this is too drinkable. The cans make it portable too, making it the perfect swing oil for a round of golf. A nice one that will compete with Sly Fox Pale Ale when I'm looking for a cans."
"Very drinkable. Just enough of a hop profile to make it interesting, but not as numbing to the palate as most American IPA's are today. Even though this is supposed to be a pale ale, I'd sooner call it an English IPA."
"Pours from the can that lovely golden orange amber hue I have come to love in beer. Really creamy, frothy head. Nice retention too. Ah, that aroma. I've smelled that before. Old Chub. What is it that they're using to create that musty, malty, delicious aroma? It's even got a bit of old gym sock in there. So unique. I love this smell; it's really grown on me since the first time I encountered it. The taste is smooth and creamy. Nice balance of hop and malt. A sturdy pale ale, for sure, Dale's has a lot to offer. Firm mouthfeel and pale malty goodness. Not as good overall as the Old Chub, in my opinion, but a quality pale ale. I'm officially a huge fan of Oskar Blues."
"I you see this beer on tap I would highly recommend giving it a try."
"Picked up a six pack at the local liquor store - quite surprised and happy that Dale finally found his way to FL - I've been waiting! I heard a lot of positive things about this brew, which may have unfortunately raised my expectations. Seems too light for 6.5% - almost watered down. Also, the carbonation was too little for my liking - after about 5 minutes of pouring into a pint glass, there was no head or lace left. Seems almost flat. I thought maybe it was a bad can, but the entire six pack was this way...I still liked it though, and will probably buy more - but will have to wait until the $10.99/6-pack price comes down a little!"
"This is an excellent Pale Ale and another great beer from Oskar Blues. Long live canned beer!"
"edit - quickly becoming my favorite go-to beer. excellent."
"Nose is hoppy and well balanced with malt. Tastes like several types of sugar. The common beet sugar, turbinado, brown, rock. Nicely bittered. Pleasant. Nice easy feel. Soft carbonation. One of the best beers in an aluminum can. Great selection if no glass is allowed. (E.g. parks, NASCAR, poolside)."
"Had a blast with this stuff , so feel free so pick some up if your feeling goot!"
"Dale's Pale Ale pours a hazy copper color with a thick off white head from a twelve ounce can. Citrusy hops dominate the aroma. The flavor is also primarily citrusy hops, but there is a nice malt sweetness that balances the hops nicely. I think this would make a nice session beer. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Good, This is a great beer to pack into the hills or national park due to its packaging. Beware at 6.5 ABV, Ole Dale will sneak up one you!"
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this canned pale ale."
"12oz can purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a dark copper with lots of head and lacing. Lovely hoppy aroma. Nice full flavour, and without a doubt the best beer I've ever had from a can. Unfortunately, I won't be able to bring it home ever again, because cans do not fly well. (Had one of its cousins, an Old Chubb, explode in my suitcase. Now it smells like good beer.)"
"Drinkability: I'm floored, great beer from a can, who'd have thunk it? Apparently, the boys at Oskar Blues. ""Beer for a glass, from a can"" indeed."
"D - Pretty damn tasty, no-frills, beer. I would drink a lot of this if I could get it in my area."
"Pours a orangish amber color with a large creamy white head that has great retention and leaves a lot of lacing around the edges of the glass. Aroma is a very pleasant mixture of malt and hops. The taste much like the smell is very well balanced with a nice mixture of malt and hops. Overall, this is certainly my idea of what an APA should be. It really has a nice hop profile, but I cannot say enough about how well balanced it really is unlike some APAs. The fact that it is in a can is a bonus as it is great for those beach/fishing trips. Highly recommended!"
"From the can, pours a very dark gold, maybe more of an amber, with a lacey collar for a head. Aromas of metallic hops, grapefruit, and molasses. Inviting. On the palate, brash bitterness first off, with the full citrus load exploding on the tongue. The malts come out toward the middle and end, mainly in the form of nutty sweetness. Big metallic notes from the get-go. Very mouthfilling, very big beer, with tons of bitterness for a pale ale, a lot of carbonation, and just enough sweet malts for a touch of balance (although it's swayed way toward hop bitterness). It's not until the finish that this beer shows any smoothness... but even after that the hops pop up for another go-round, lingering on the palate with spiky citrus notes. This is one helluva a big beer; it's a rash, impolite bastard. But man is it good."
"Drinkability: Very solid and drinkable APA. Nice that it comes in cans. Certainly a nice beer for tailgating at a baseball game"
"Overall, this beer is okay but not spectacular. I'd probably drink it again, but wouldn't seek it out."
"Mildly hoppy and lacked much head. It reminded me of a homebrew in it's appearence being slightly cloudy. It did not have a metallic taste and all said it was not too bad. It had a side of the mouth bite that was unique. I would drink again."
"Beer pourd from can into tumbler at 48 degrees. Beer was a strange cloudy orange color. Beer had a great big head that lasted forever that exuded a very hoppy nose. Beer was really smooth feeling almost thich in the mouth. A bit too hoppy for my taste, will not but again."
"D: Nice beer. Quite flavorful. Doing some crazy stuff to the sides of my mouth though."
"Pours a nice amber with a big off white head that leaves some good lacing. The smell is of decent floral hops and a noticeable malt background that smells clean and slightly grainy. Great pale ale taste, but definitely a little hoppier and maltier than many. The hops and malt are soft however and preserve a pale ale flavor rather than the relative sharpness of an IPA. The hops are much more flavorful than suggested by the aroma- nice bitter hit here followed by a grainy maltiness and a light stone fruit flavor. The mouthfeel is quite thick and grainy for a pale ale, but its not unpleasant. This does make it a little more filling and less of a session beer than it might be. This brewers beers made me a believer in canning beers. Absolutely the best thing ever for backpacking."
"Highly recommended."
"Easy enough to drink for the seasoned veteran, almost even for first timers. I still think the bitterness would get to them. It took a couple sessions a few months apart to really appreciate this. Much easier with food. Pouring beer from a can is more then just a novelty now. A backyard barbecue favorite. :)"
"Pours with a thick, spongy head and long-lasting head and settles with minor lacing. Dales' has a mildly hoppy bite and leaves little aftertaste - due to storage, I think. Like any well-crafted beer, it gets better as it reaches room temperature. All-in-all, an exceptional quaff, though I do prefer Oskar Blues Scotch Ale ""Old Chubb."" Cheers!"
"This pale ale poured a clear, amber color with off-white foam that persisted and slowly settled and clung to the glass. The smell was light malt with a hint of caramel and a light hoppiness. The carbonation tickled the nose. The taste was lightly sweet malt with a very light hoppiness. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with medium body and good carbonation. There was a light hoppiness and maltiness in the finish. This was a good pale ale. Keep up the good work with the cans."
"The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing well making this one of the best APA's on the market. This is very good. Cheers."
"The body is, as I expected, rich and creamy. Not really what I would expect from a pale ale, per se, though I really enjoy a nice body from any beer. Very easy to drink. One of the most interesting pale ales I've tried (which is kind of an unusual thing to say if you think about it), and not just because of its packaging."
"Overall - This was one of my first hoppy beers several years ago. I fell in love with hops and havn't looked back. Still one of my favorites."
"A very tastey canned ale, maybe the best Ive had. The brisk hoppiness and great balance. Make it dangerously drinkable. I highly recommend it."
"D - 2 was my limit. a bit less grainy and it would be rated much higher."
""
"count me among many others (including the folks at oskar blues themselves!) who never expected a big hoppy american style pale ale full of character to come out of a can. once you pour it and taste it, there's just no denying it; this is one of america's finest pale ales."
"Conclusion: Enjoyed the beer. I would consider this a session beer for a party or bbq. Good hop taste, but not over powering, and a clean drink."
"For a while, I lived in Colorado and thought Dale's was overrated. Far inferior to Old Chub and many of the states great IPAs. I don't know what I was thinking. This is a must have beer. And the fact that it comes in cans makes it only that much more appealing. I'm dreaming about all the ridiculous spots that I'll be able to take this brew."
"Had this on tap (even the tap-head is a can) and it poured a dark amber with a nice white head. I found this beer to be pretty refreshing and had a great scent. Strong aromas of citrus, pine, and good hops. The mouthfeel is pretty creamy and decent carbonation throughout. Overall a pretty good pale ale that I could see myself looking for now and then."
"Mouthfeel was full body and creamy. The midpalate had some tropical friut tones and rich caramel. The finish had more hops showing thru with nice grapefruit and oily pine taste. The only difference I noticed having it on draft than in the can was the oily pine flavor stood out more!"
"This can makes this beer slightly novel, but its a great one for occasions when a bottle just won't do, and it really helps that its a tasty beer as well."
"I really love the old chub, and was a little disappointed in this one, but honestly it's still really good. Big malt, the hops aren't completely to my liking as I think they don't balance perfectly, but honestly it doesn't bother me too much. Good beer."
"This beer is no slouch -- it's big and bold enough that I probably wouldn't want to drink more than two of these. Nonetheless, this is an excellent beer and reminds me how good an American Pale Ale can be."
"This beer pours a nice copper with an unprecedented foamy head with unreal retention and thick sticky lacing. The head on this beer is just phenomenal and remarkable. The nose is very malty, more then typical in a pale ale, but due to the abundance of barley used in this beer. The bitterness of this beer tastes high for an APA, but the huge malt proportion balances out the bitterness and results in a very big tasting beer. The hops have a piney character and the malt has a chewy sweetness, honey almost raisiny malt, similar to Dogfishs 90 Minute IPA or Raison dEtre. The mouthfeel is substantial, medium-fullbodied and chewy, somewhat creamy at the beginning due to the monstrous head. This is a tremendously drinkable beer, even at the 6.5% abv. It has very quickly become one of my favorite American Pale Ales."
"D-I could drink a 6 pack of this beer but I would have to be off of work the next morning.It goes down real smooth,almost too smooth and it will hit ya after a couple.Well done,my first beer from Dales. I like it alot Highly Reccomended"
"Small but persistent head. Good lacing as beer is consumed. Some hop aroma at first but gives way to malt aroma as beer is consumed. Good mouth feel. Malty flavor with bittering hop finish. Overall a good balanced malt flavored pale ale."
"The best thing about this beer is how smooth and drinkable it is. It goes down easy with no bitter aftertaste. I don't know how well the flavor translates in a can, but out of a tap it is quite a treat. It's an India Pale Ale trapped in an APA's body, yet still delicious in its own right. Highly reccomended."
"This PA gives a beautiful combination of malt and hops that is just thick enough to please the palate. I tastes great and the finish is clean. A good froth releases some more citrus. This could very well be a "" go-to "" brew. I love it, quaffable even."
"This may be a new favorite. Let's just say Sierra Nevada should pay close attention to DPA."
"d - this beer starts slowly but seems to become more complex (and better) as it warms."
"Understated pale, with citrus hop smell and citrus orange taste. Above average mouthfeel. Satisfying in a meal. Suitable carbonation. Decent for a beer in a can, but I still detected metallic in my glass. which subtracted from a good balance of bitterness and malt."
"D- very drinkable, a nice session beer, I said this in my reveiw of the old chub, craft breweries need to start putting more of their product in cans"
"D - A wonderful drink for hopheads. Strong so you wouldn't want a ton. Definetely worth a try, particularly for fans of IPAs."
"Bottom line: This is a great APA! 'nuff said!"
"I highly recomend this beer."
"Alright, good beer in a can! Pours a solid amber color, quite hazy (not quite hefe hazy, but nearly). Rocky eggshell-yellow head. Smells cool & creamy and potently hoppy, like grass clippings and pine needles. The body is rich & smooth, not quite thick but definitely substantial, which I like. The taste is interesting; it hits you right up front with the grinding, aggressive hop taste and kind of buzzes along through the sip without mellowing out. Hmm. It's an earthy/dirty sort of hop flavor, but in combination with the beefy body, it works. Just enough bitterness to keep it well grounded and refreshing; I could definitely see downing a few of these ice-cold after a long hike. Excellent."
"In fact, it is probably my favorite APA right now. Pours a deep golden color with a thick white head with great retention. Aroma is piney and spicy hops, and lots of 'em. Taste is very bitter, but with some nice malty body to back it up. Some oily hoppiness in the mouthfeel, otherwise a medium bodied brew with a fair amount of carbonation. So drinkable, and bonus points for coming in an unbreakable container that I can take anywhere. I guess it is almost an IPA, but with a beer this good, why quibble?"
"D - A very interesting experiment of quality craft beer in a can... overall, it's flavorful and pleasant, but the two detriments of alcohol and metallic bitterness keep it from true excellence."
"Drinkability is great aided by the fact its in a can. It can go many places bottles are not allowed and its a good APA to boot. Hell what more could you want."
"Can courtesy of Brentfeesh: Poured a slightly hazy deep amber color ale with a nice foamy head with average retention. Aroma of crisp C-type hops with a nice sweet malt base. Taste is a very well balance mix between sweet malt and some bitter hops. Body is above average and carbonation is just perfect. Well made example of an APA."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is approaching medium bodied. The beer has a slightly oily mouthfeel. The oilyness makes the flavors linger in a good way. The beer is easy to drink. I could see drinking several of these in a row. This is a dam fine APA and I will buy this one again if I have the chance."
"A highly drinkable pale ale."
"Drinkability: I thought the taste was a little overboard and strong on the senses for a pale ale."
"The drinkability of this beer is phenomenal. Enough flavor to keep you interested but easygoing and unassuming enough to be indefinitely quaffable (assuming you love hops, like I do)."
"Overall tasty stuff, but too sweet and full-bodied to be a regular for me."
"Thanks to HardTarget for sharing this rare example."
"Between the two, I would have to call it a toss up. But for sure they have different factors for sure."
"This beer from a can. Nice. Copper color with a large egg white foamed head. Head maitains nicely, lots of lacing. Carbonation holds throughout. Smell is strong on hops. Lots of grapefruit and pine in the aroma. Somewhat acidic. Flavor provides more balance with a collection of malts to support the hop dominance. Kind of a rich caramel flavor at the top. A bit of a sweet biscuity base is there. But this is about the hops. They come out in full form. Never too much though. Nice fruity bitterness, nice grapefruit bitterness, and a nice bit of resiny pine in the finish. Malts never lose control of keeping the hops in hand though. Just a great beer all around. Even though the abv's a touch high, this might be my new session beer."
"Creamy mouthfeel and good carbonation. I will be picking more of this up next time I head back to NC...my sixer is just about gone. Good beer to just grab a can and pop it open tastes just as good from the can."
"D- Liked the balance and taste alot. Easy drinking, definetly a memorable pale ale in my book"
"Mouthfeel is perfect. The hops and the caramel malts balance out the body perfectly. Medim bodied. Perfect. A wonderful beer. Might this become a permanant resident in the fridege? In a word, yes!"
"d: This is a full and well balanced brew from a can. You cannot tell it is from a can if you pour it and actually this one is great straight from the can. A very enjoyable pale ale. Too bad it is 9 bucks a 6er up here, but it is worth it I suppose."
"For those of you who might steer away from cans, give this a try. A real nice beer with good flavor and a velvety creaminess to it."
"When I poured this beer into a glass I was surprised; not used to seeing a beer with such good color come from a can. Great nose, with apparent maltiness and a teasing hop aroma that gives you a sense of good things to come. The taste is a bit milder than the nose would suggest, but still a great malt foundation with a hoppy back to it. I wish more canned beer was this good."
"This beer poured a beautiful orange/amber color with a huge 2 finger head that left plenty of lace on the glass. Aroma was malty with a good bit of flowery hops mixed in. Taste was of sweet malts, peach, apricot and piney/resiny hops. Mouthfeel was fairly light for such a tasty beer. Drinkability is good if you like hoppy beers, which I do. This beer leans more towards an American IPA in my opinion. Who knew that such a well crafted brew could come in a can? Now I can't wait to try Old Chub."
"Overall, it's not bad, especially for a canned beer. I'm wondering what it would be like in a bottle. Not a bad choice if you are in the mood for hops and/or only have a choice of canned beers."
"D - This is a nice drinkable beer....but don't pound it in the can. Pour it in a glass!"
"Very nice pale ale. I had heard good things and was not disappointed. The website describes it as being between a pale ale and an IPA, and I would agree. Hoppier than your average PA, but not quite up to IPA standards. Also is good straight out of the can, although I wouldn't recommend doing that, as you miss out on much of the wonderful aroma. Highly recommended."
"Good beer."
"Poured an amber color from a 12 oz can, white head. Great citrusy hop aroma, I can't believe this came of a can. The taste mostly hops, initially some malt but after a few sips the hop bitterness covers everything else up. Medium mouthfeel, pretty much what I would expect with an APA. I enjoyed this and would drink it again, especially if I were outside, in a hotel or anywhere else where bottles are inconvenient. The bitterness lingers too much to drink more than one or two of these."
"D: Highly drinkable pale ale. one of the best ones I've had, especially because it's in a CAN! Very sessionable ale."
"If you're into sweet, citrusy, hoppy pale ales, this'll be right up your alley. Pretty well balanced too and I sure didn't find any ""off"" flavors from the can. To be honest, I'm completely indifferent to whether my beer comes in a can or a bottle. A very good APA poured from a can, bottle, or otherwise..."
"d: very enjoyable but a big heavey on the hoppy bitterness for my tastes. Tone down the hoppy bitterness and this is a great beer for me."
"D: Extremely drinkable. I really wish I didnt know it came from a can, as I feel I was looking for an aluminum can taste. I honestly believe you would have no idea it came from a can if you didnt pour it yourself. Skeptics put on your wifebeater, crank up the skynyrd and enjoy!"
"Pretty rusty color, great, great head. Foamy and sudsy. Stays for a while and leaves great lace. Smell is hoppy and, well, hoppy. Tastes quite hoppy as well, with a sweet, fruity thing going on in the background. Sure this isn't an IPA? Once again, like the Great Divide brews of Colorado, I taste a pot type thing going on. Must be something in the Colorado water... Mouthfeel is sudsy and surprisingly a little thin. Drinkability- pretty good, if you're in the mood for hops, otherwise, run away. And oh yeah- the can is the best, wish all beers came in cans."
"Overall, a descent beer. Having ""good"" beer in a can (which is unusual in my parts"" makes this a good choice when bottles are out of the quetsion."
"And I'm all over the idea of craft beer in a can."
"One of the best beesr I've had from a can. I love the convenience of the packaging and the quality of this beer; a rare combo these days. Could this be a sign of things to come? I hope so. Hats off to Oskar Blues Brewery."
"From an aluminum can, this brew pours a beautiful, rich amber color with a solid foamy head. Very attractive. The aroma is packed with hops: citrus and pine. Also present is a notable caramel-like malt backdrop. The taste is moderately dry and slightly resinous. Theres some malt flavor as well, but it fades increasing into the background as you near the finish. The finish is dry, moderately bitter, and full of a citric hop flavor. Moderate carbonation and a full body. Clean, and very drinkable. I was very impressed with this beer."
"Pumpkin orange hue pours with a great head and nice retention. Piney aroma along with grapefuit and maybe pineapple. Good hop flavor followed by excellent malt balance. Not a bitter pale along the lines of Sierra Nevada or the like. Along with everyone else who tries this I am amazed at drinking such a good beer out of a can.There are better pale ales out there but certainly not in a can."
"Brewed by two self-proclaimed hill-billy brothers, who refuse to bottle anything, this would appear gimmicky at first, but after opening, and consuming you realize this is the real deal. An excellent beer whether canned/bottled, whatever."
"Pours amber nice head, great retention and lace. Smell is of carmel malts, and piney hops. Body is fairly thick with some carbionation. Taste is smooth. Malty up front with a piney hop finish. This is a great beer!! Balance is malt and hops is excellent."
"Overall I was impressed. Not the best APA I've ever had, but by far the best I've had in a can, for what thats worth."
"Update: after finding $3 cans at my local lunch haunt of Dale's PA, I've taken a real strong liking to this. I was elated to see some fine NYC review of Pale Ale's put this one on top too. I put drinkability from 3 to 4 and upgraded taste, mouthfeel and smell a 1/2 point each. It's a good one in every respect and has a very nice nose. I'm at the point that I would choose it of DFH60."
"Body falls just below medium, with average carbonation and a slick, smooth mouthfeel and crisp texture. Packed with flavor, yet light enough foe poolside refreshment. My new summer Go-To!"
"Beer pours a medium amber color with an small amount of lacing. Smell of a sweet malts covering a yet to be discover hop profile. I like the taste. Malty and a tad hoppy, all at the same time. That said neither are really dominant. Just a well balanced, very drinkable beer. Probably the best beer I have ever had out of a can."
"Poured a semi-translucent, rust-orange color with an eggshell colored head that left behind plenty of lacing (rings). Aromas of grapefruit, citrus, hops, and grass seemed to come out. The taste was quite hoppy with bitterness right upfront and a malt sweetness in the tail end. The finish was semi-sour with a hint of ginger. Nice texture, but perhaps not carbonated enough. Easy to drink and sip; I'll be looking at cans in a whole new way."
"Amber colored and fiercly bitter, this pale ale drinks like an IPA. The extreme bitterness of the hops was offset slightly by the balance in the body, malty but still crisp. A nice white head that disapated quickly and left little lace. A typical american micro pale ale in my opinon, meaning way overdone with the hop bitterness, which severely limits it's drinkablity for me, although I am not much of a hop head."
"Extremely drinkable. This is no gimmick beer, it is a real fine, refreshing, crisp beer."
"Now on to more pressing questions -- If a beer falls in the woods..."
"Pours a pale ale-ish hazy-chinky amber-copper in color. Tight layer of tannish-white head. Modest lacing of the glass. Aromas are really, REALLY pronounced citrus hop zest mixed with oily pine resins. Amazing. Flavor is snappy and brisk, starting off with a citrus splash followed by a puckering pine sap dollop on the tongue. There's an undertow of malt backbone that keeps this one in check. Hoppy? Heck yes. But not overtly so. Finishes dry, with a short-lived orange zest aftertaste. Right amount of carbonation. Decent body. Very drinkable. A sure-fire tailgating beer if there ever was one."
"Drinkability: I stumbled upon Dales a few years ago when coming back from Rocky Mountain National Park and stopped in Lyons, CO for a beer. It was damn fine on tap, then when they said they had six packs to go in cans, I couldn't believe it. Anyway, move ahead a few years and I'm finally reviewing this APA. Dales is a hop heads APA, in fact, its more along the lines of an IPA if you ask me. Plenty of juicy, citrusy hops and that undercurrent of semi-sweet malts makes this an easy drinker for sure. No trace of metal can be found in the flavor profile. This is a beer that I highly recommend, and its even better that it comes in a can. Seek and enjoy, a great beer to take boating, hiking or on the beach."
"overall, this is a very solid beer, very convenient that it comes in cans, this would be a good one for camping trips and such when bottles are cumbersome."
"The mouth feel is medium in body and is actively carbonated."
"Pours to a copper color with off-white head and good lacing. Good floral aorma with hints of citrus fruits. Taste very hoppy with a pleasant aftertaste. Been a while since Ive had beer out of a can, but this was a pleasant surprise over what you usually get. This would be a really good beer for a hot summers day."
"The appearance is nearly perfect, pours an amber color with nice clarity and a massive off-white head that retains excellently. The aroma has some citrusy and piney hops, caramel, some fruity esters and some toasted bread. The flavor starts out with citrusy and piney hops, followed by some caramel, toasted bread, some fruity esters and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth, but i felt the carbonation was slightly low. Drinkability is very good. A good beer, but i didnt think it was hoppy enough for what it bills itself as personally, i kept wishing for a SNPA."
"I enjoyed this one. It's easy drinking and quite flavorful at the same time. It still baffles me that good beer comes in cans now, but I'll definitely pick up more of this in the future."
"Hell yeah! Oskar Blues beers (Dale's Pale Ale and Old Chub, at least) are available at Consumer's on Transit in Williamsville! Picked up a sixer today. Can art is a bit different: Blue background, red and white logo with mountain landscape in the background -- no bricks or whatever that is on the picture here. Pours a bright copper with frothy soy-milk-colored head. Citric aromas of grapefruit and pine sap blended with a sweetish biscuity malt scent. Taste is extremely hoppy for an American Pale Ale; astringent grapefruit and tangerine flavors abound. There is nevertheless a strong malt backbone, biscuity and caramelly. Lovely hop-tinged burps. Much more like an IPA, in my opinion. Smooth, juicy mouthfeel and medium-light body. Quite drinkable, just don't agree that it's an APA. I'm super excited that this is available in Buffalo now -- I've been wanting to try this for a while and thought I'd have to wait until my next trip to Denver. Not so!"
"D - I like this, I wish it was sold in Japan!!! It makes me all nostalgic."
"M/D- The mouthfeel was nice. There was not too much carbonation, actually it kinda had a really low carbonation level(well a little lower than I prefer). It kinda reminded me of SNPA, but that is probably because of the cascade hops. Overall I enjoyed this beer, and it was a great way to start of my week end in new york."
"Overall- A very good Pale Ale and even bigger thumbs up cause its in a can. A definite purchase for when cans-only will suffice!! This will be found in my backpack during hiking trips!"
"I have to say this is my new favorite APA,poured a clear deep golden with a very tight well retained 0ne finger head that stuck like glue to the pint glass dissapating ever so slowly.Intermingling aromas of biscuity lightly sweet malt and piney,resiny hop neither win out but a re a perfect match,wow what balance and hop character starts out with a suger dough-like quality but a ""voluminously"" big piney,resiny hop quality follows thru to the end.I'll tell you what to me its dead on what a American pale ale should be the American hop profile is there but there is some balance,damn I loved it."
"Served in a 12oz aluminum can. Pours a golden honey color with a nice white head that clears to a film over time. Smells hoppy. Taste has malty sweetness and strong hoppyness. Mouthfeel is good. Very drinkable. Good beer to enjoy while hiking, especially where you can't bring glass."
"a great pale ale, perfect for warm weather days on your front porch. Will drink again."
"My first craft beer in a can. Much more than I was expecting. The color is a nice orange amber. There was a decent head. The smell is very fruity. The taste is superb for a pale ale. Hoppy, with a subdued sweetness. No negative flavors. The mouthfeel is just the right amount of lingering hoppiness. This is a session beer if I have ever seen one. Plus being in a can you could take it places you could not bottles such as sporting events. If I had not poured this beer there is no way you could tell it was from a can. This will become my new session beer if I can find it locally."
"This is a pretty decent pale ale. I'm even more (slightly) impressed that it's available in a can. This might be a new tailgating staple for summer Brewers games at Miller Park."
"Drinkability: decently drinkable from a glass, probably better from a can when you can't be drinking out of glass. Worth a try."
"ABV is a plus."
"I really enjoy all the Oskar blues offering in the cans.... I truly do. I personally think they'd be rated higher if they were in bottles though. I understand why they do it, and I applaud them for it. But it's a risky move for a start up micro. I think it's great.... this is my one and only go to beer when I'm out camping, on a boat, or anywhere else that glass isn't appropriate or allowed."
"Pours up a translucent pale copper color with a generous, creamy light beige head. Good retention and lacing. Light pine and citrusy hop notes with a delicate, toasty malt backbone. Crisp and a little too clean finishing, with a gentle hop bitterness along with a some residual maltiness. Slight wateriness mid-palate. Goes down pretty easily, despite a subtle medicinal phenolic presence after drinking a few. Overall, I'd say it's a pretty decent APA, but I can think of better examples."
"A tremendously underrated beer in my opinion. Don't let the ridiculous can stigma scare you off. The second beer I have tried from Oskar Blues... and the second winner. Fantastic job."
"Mouth is smooth more malty sweet than expected but not too much. This allows a nice peacan nuty-ness to develope with undertones of toasty bread and the lingering citrus and bitter hops is inviting for another sip. This is an easy drinking Pale Ale and a great transition beer for those who are not into hoppy beers. This is no Alpha King of Pisgah Pale, but still one of the better Pale Ales."
"This is my favorite, everyday beer. The head is nice and frothy and lasts a decent amount of time. Not a hop bomb, but plenty of hops and sweet maltiness. Lots of floral hops, not so much citrus and chewy. Plenty of carbonation. I can and have drunk these for hours on end."
"Solid beer..."
"This pale ale, somewhat unique because it comes in an aluminum can, is rather sadly rather average. It pours a nice gold-amber color, with a nice white foamy head. The smell is hoppy but not excessivley so. The taste mirrors the smell, being slightly bitter (am I also tasting the can?. A descent pale ale but the only thing which sets it part from the other brews out there is its packaging (it would be an ideal choice for campers)."
"A dark orange/copper colored beer with a slight haze. Has a big foamy light beige head with plenty of good lace. A bittersweet grapefruit character dominates to aroma with a hint of malty sweetness in the background. There is a quick hint of malt sweetness on the tip of the tongue. Followed by a blast of grapefruit hop bitterness. There is another quick hint of malt before the dry hop finish. Very refreshing."
"This is a seriously good pale ale, like better than SNPA good. To me the packaging is irrelevant (can or bottle) because I am going to pour it into a glass anyways. So long as it arrives fresh, and it tastes good, then I am happy. This beer pours an orangey amber color, with a bubbly head that doesn't ever completely recede. It is a classic APA: all hops. In terms of taste, it might be closer to an IPA, but the classification isn't really all that important because the styles are pretty much the same anyways. There is a strong, puckering hops taste that finishes with a delicious fruitiness that lingers. I would reccomend this beer regardless of its packaging."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Surprising light and not very effervescent. There isn't much action at all in the mouth, which was a little disappointing. The lingering finish is loaded with biscuity, caramel malt flavors and a lot of bitterness... it really needs some weight or carbonation to pull off the flavor density. Very nice beer, and definitely worth the try."
"I finally got around to trying Dale's Pale Ale. I think it was kismet, since there was only one six-pack left at the store. Poured a golden color with a fat two finger head. Hop aromas all over the place. Absolutely amazing. In my opinion, certainly closer to an IPA. The numbers would support as well at 60+ IBU's and 6.5% ABV. Wickedly drinkable. May be a bit high in alcohol for a session brew, but it won't stop me from trying. This may very well be my favorite IPA. I love the fact that one of the reasons these guys are canning is because it made them laugh. I was the one laughing at a party I went to when people thought I was drinking ""generic beer"". I just love the notion of a kick ass IPA in a can. Oskar Blues rocks!!!"
"Taste was great, except a bit of metallic from the can lingered. Otherwise a nice beer. Good balance...6 didn't last long"
"Comments: I give this pale a high rating & recommend to others. Very well balanced overall. Didn't know what to expect with being in cans & all, but truly paid off. Excellent flavor, no lingering bitterness & crisp finish. Wonderful all around...."
"Great suppin beer, this."
"The predominant taste is of sweet honey coated powered malt. An unusual taste of over-ripe melon is noticeable. Do I taste unripe pears? Weird! Weirder yet, is a slight taste of buttermilk. The hops have a raspy black tea-like astringent bitterness. Upon more careful scrutiny, a metallic (pennies) bitterness emerges. A weak lime-like citrusy bitterness lingers. The alcoholic bite is a bit harsh, though not overwhelming. This brew seems to stray off the mark of the typical Pale Ale style. I feel like I need to have my taste buds refreshed or tested after drinking this oddball beer!"
"Overall, a good beer (even for me not being a hop-head), but it's the can that truly makes this one stand out. Kudo's to the brewers on taking a chance on putting a micro in a can."
"I believe I would call this beer delicious. An excellent pale ale. I could drink a lot of these."
"P.S. It comes in a can."
"I'd been seeing the aluminum can sixers of this and Old Chub for a few weeks now, so I finally picked one up. Decided to start with the pale. The can calls it a ""voluminously hopped mutha of a pale ale."" Let's hope they're right. It pours smoothly from the wide mouth an unfiltered orange/amber color with lots of visible carbonation leading up to a frothy 2 finger khaki/yellow head that is very sticky and leaves nice lacing throughout. It smells citric (lemon, grapefruit) with pine and some hop oils. The first taste reveals sweet, almost buttery/nutty malts, with caramel, perhaps some earth, and a medium bitterness from the hops which are grapefruit, orange, pine, perhaps soapy, and there's also an apricot quality in there. The body is just right - medium, carbonated, but not overly so, and soooo smooth, even when very cold and drunk straight from the can. On top of that, I'm having grapefruit burps from a CANNED BEER! I can't believe the quality - it tastes so fresh and goes down so easily. This beer screams session ale - I had to struggle to keep a couple to drink the next day. I need more of this stuff - probably gonna go get a case. Wonder if the Old Chub is as good. I guess we'll see..."
"Very hoppy aroma fairly blast you with citrus and pine notes. Amber body supports with a lazy white head. Very malty with medium hop presence, less hoppy tasting than it smelled. Bread, caramel, grapefruit, toffee and minor honey notes. The can is just awesome by the way."
"Let me start by saying I felt like an asshole approaching the counter with a 6pk of cans, but I had been told by a handful of people that I would have to look past that, and that the contents of the can were fantastic. I'm glad I took the advice. This stuff pours a crystal clear golden orange with a nice looking white foamy head. It hangs around for about 90 seconds then subsides to sticky lace stuck to the sides of the glass and a thing white haze over the surface of the liquid. The smell is sweet and hoppy with a little citrus mixed in there as well. The taste is awsome!! Great hops and a bit of grapefruit. Very ""juicy"" taste. There is also a dry maltiness on the finish. Very smooth and very easy to drink. Nicely balanced and a big, big surprise out of a can!!!"
"Note: After writing this, I got two more cans and liked it even more. I then bought another two cans, and liked those more. This beer is really growing on me."
"...Or will I?"
"This one is quite decent--it pours a clear amber. Leaves a small head and minimal lacing. Smell is outdoorsy, piney and woody in general. Taste is well balanced with some maltinesss and a hop bite right off the bat and then a more caramel salt waterish finish. Very smooth and a nice tingly mouthfeel. Drinkability is excellent."
"Musings: Like everyone - had to try. It's appears to be a little off the mark - but is highly enjoyable for a can. Price point is a little high - if it comes down, I culd be drinking this summer quiite a bit."
"Let me state this - you will not find a better beer in a can. This will be very close to me as soon as golf season starts back up! Very convenient package. (also can easily be mistaken for a Pepsi can - to keep the golf marshalls at bay!)"
"Before popping the tab, I wondered whether Dale's Pale Ale would supplant my favorite canned beer of all-time, Caldera Pale. Caldera's version is my clear favorite, although from what I remember, the scores are similar. This is an excellent choice (when glass is verboten) for those hopheads lucky enough to have access."
"Received from Zorro in BCG BIF"
"Overall = Not as good as Sherwood Forest's Archer's Ale but Dale's Pale is right behind it as the second best beer in a can. This harsh, hoppy pale ale is quite drinkable and enjoyable is you like hops. It's a bit too coarse but that's my only real complaint."
"I was sort of pleasing surprised by this ale. Nice color and aroma. Taste can be a little harsh if you are use to the mass produced beers like Coors and the such. I'm not so i found it a great drinking beer when you are in the mood for just a few. More than a few can knock you on your butt @ 6.5% alcohol. This has become my Saturday night beer of choice for the last couple of months."
"This is one of the better Pale Ales I've had in a while. Well balanced, good malt character, good hop bitterness, good hop flavor. Makes me want another."
"All in all, a fine pale ale. It's no alpha king, but I would definitely drink it if I came across it again."
"Flavor was at first full of fresh hops nicely balanced with a slight malt backbone. However, within minutes of being poured and beginning to warm the hop flavors quickly turned into a sour, bad vegetable offering. Maybe I just got a bad can but this was tough to drink. It eventually wound up being pretty sour. Medium body but a bit too tastebud-twisting in the finish."
"The beer is light coppery, with a beautiful rocky head, but its a little cloudy. The aroma is slightly malty and some moderate hop aroma is present as well - a piney, citrusy hop or hop blend. It could stand to be a little more intense but it suits the style. The flavor is great - a slight bit of caramel and malt up front, then a nice smooth hop bitterness and a finish that's lightly sweet and nicely bitter. Very nice. This is the 2nd best beer in a can I've ever had (see Old Chub for the best one). Great!"
"overall i'm damn impressed with this beer. i would never have guessed it was from a can. consider my perceptions changed."
"This beer pours a rusty orange color and leaves a frothy head with holes throughout the froth. The smell of this ale is piney and citrus with some sweet fruit candy in the background of this nectar. The taste of this ale is so smooth it hits you with a very light carbonation followed by a sweet honey comb flavor finished with a bitterness that leave you wanting a little more. The overall flavor is a bit bland on the finish but this is still a quallity brew."
"Drinkability: A very nicely executed pale ale, with a balanced flavor profile"
"Mouthfeel is a little thick for a pale ale, but overall a pretty good beer."
"Had to try, great packaging and a very good beer indeed. previous reviewer is pretty accurate, minimal to no head. Carbonation is light which equates to an extremely drinkable can beer (like say yoo hoo). I drank out of the can and then poured into a glass. Definitely an American IPA by anyone's standards. How many 6.5% pale ales are there? Definite floral hops and a fairley dry finish althjough enough of malt back up. I thought I found my new summer pool beer until I saw the abv."
"One hell of a pale ale, probably closer to an IPA in nature. A very good brew, and the best canned beer I've had to date."
"Nice amber/copper color. Can opened with no fizz. A nice white head. I poured half in a glass and will drink the other half old school style. Citrusy floral hop aroma. Very hoppy taste. Slight carbonation. A little thick or syrupy. Drinking from the can is like drinking orange soda with hops. Not bad. If I had to drink canned beer I could definitely drink this."
"The drinkability is fantastic. Maybe it's just the giddy feeling I get by drinking a good beer out of a can, but this brew is a refreshing change while watching the Bucks dominate the offensive glass. Cheers!"
"12 ounce CAN, yeah cans, a good beer in a can is a bonus, we need more decent canned beer, why? its lighter, more portable, many more fit in a cooler or fridge for that matter and Its just good for variety in packaging reasons. Anyway, enuf of my pro can ranting. This one pours a nice dark honey amber, clear and sports a nice long lasting off white creamy head. Leaves tons o' lacing to boot. Nose is citrusy hops. This is a better then average P.A.. Respectable hopping rate is evidence and in general, this one hits the note. Nice going Dale's, wish I could find this one regularly in the NYC area."
"Easy to drink. Perhaps a touch too much carbonation to begin with, but well within the normal range of a pale ale. Medium body. It feels almost creamy initially. Very nice."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" off-white head above the orangey amber brew. Head recedes slowly, with good lacing. Aroma is substantially of citrus and piney hops. Taste has it all going on, light sweet melt upfront, balanced and then some by tangy hops that pretty much steal the show. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent, and the can packaging makes it even that much more drinkable in some locales. As good (or better) than I had heard/expected."
"An excellent beer that may end up being a pioneer in the movement back toward putting good craft beer in a can. Your Bud/Miller/Coors-from-a-can drinking buddies (if you have any), would probably find this has waaaay too much taste, which is one of the best things you can say about it."
"The beer pours a hazy, dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a very complex malt scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and bisquit malts along with a heavy hop aroma; quite bitter. The taste is awesome. It has a smooth malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes bitter and slightly sweet. It has a solid malt bill and hop character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an excellent pale ale. It has complexity in both the aroma and taste; a good drinker. This has got to be the best canned beer I've ever had."
"It's great to see a craft brew Pale Ale in an aluminum can. The representative at the World Beer Festival gave me a six pack in a bag of ice for a presentation on Beers in the News for the World Beer Festival. Not sure why it was in the news but learned that a bottle versus a can is no different anymore . . . all of it should be poured in a glass. If I could find this in North Carolina, I would definitely buy it for parties, barbeques, etc. Not nearly as snobby if you bring your craft beer in a can. Don't let this one fool you, it's a very good choice."
"The flavor follows through on the fruit/resiny characteristics and adds a ton of malt sweetness (perhaps a bit too much). Bitterness is at a sufficient level. Unfortunately there is also a detectable mineral/metallic quality. Still- this makes a great case for beer in cans. I enjoyed it."
"Poured from a can (yep a can) into a pint glass. Upon pouring, this beer produces a nice one and a half fingers of thick, marshmallow cloud foam. A beautiful orange speckled with lots of tiny sediment makes this beauty sparkle. Truly a sight to behold. Crazy amounts of lace coat the glass in huge ridges. The head sticks around for a while; dimpling and begging to be gazed upon. The smell is all clean..pine and citrus..with bright floral hop notes. Mouthfeel is medium and just crisp enough. Taste is all pine sap and orange with a nice warm buttery glow on the tongue. Hops are all over the place and leave a great piney-hop aftertaste. I could pound these bad boys all night. Definitely a sleeper and for the price you'd be hard pressed to find anything this tasty. I can't say I noticed an aluminum or canned taste in the slightest. I'd easily recommend this to anyone as a great standout IPA. This brew is clearly in need of a review revisit by some who have been blinded by the can."
"The cans give it a niche market, and I'll be back for more of this for those ""no glass"" occasions, like poolside on summer vacation. However, this would be a very nice pale ale if it was only available in those boring brown bottles. Cans do."
"What a delightful thing it is to find a pale ale in a can that is as BIG and TASTY as this one is. I waited anxiously for this beer to come to Jersy so that I could try. I was relying on the strength of the reviews on this site and on the New York Times Article on Pale Ales from about a moth ago. This brew does not disappoint. Pours a clear copy with an abundant white head that leaves clumps of creamy lace. Aroma is spicy, floral citrus and biscuit notes. Taste is sharp floral hops with muted malts with a medium bodied mouth feel. you need to try this beer. The can may put some off but do put it aside and give this and the Old Chub a try!"
"-UF"
"Appearance is somewhat hazy with a light copper coler. Head was slightly off-white and maintained a good consistency while drinking, some lacing on glass. Taste is best described as bitter,somewhat hoppy, but once inside the mouth it goes down smooth creating a good mouthfeel You can smell the hops,adding to your drinking pleasure. Very surprized how good this was considering it came out of a can. Will look forward to drinking this again and would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys an American Pale Ale."
"Found a can of this at the Vintage Cellar, Radford, Va. Pours a clear copper amber body with a surprising, two finger beige head. Retention is decent and some clingy patch lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is assertive, with prominent malty notes of fresh toffee and caramel. Fruity hops add accents of grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and some chewy malt. Taste is sturdy, with lots of sweet malty caramel and toffee, and an equally powerful menu of tropical fruit bitterness, mostly pink grapefruit. Lots of flavor, and well balanced. More like an American Amber than an APA, but an excellent and very drinkable brew no matter what it is. I'm convinced that canned microbrews work just fine."
"Basically, if I were going camping, I'd bring this along by the six pack, but I probably wouldn't buy it any other time. Might be a good beer to take along to a party where lots of swill will be consumed (assuming you don't want to stand out too much). Maybe I will buy some to take to the family fourth of July this weekend... nah, they already know I'm a snob =)"
"A novelty item: a large, hoppy ale that comes in a can. Presentation aside, this is a good beer with lots of hops and lots of malt (a baby barleywine, if you will) that is probably not entirely deserving of the attention it's gotten due to coming in a can. Color is deep amber, difficult to see through, with a healthy dollop of thick head atop, and firm, arched lacing down the sides of the glass. Aroma is fragrantly sweet, like bubble gum and wild flowers, equal shares of malt and hop. The same is true for the taste, with big sweet caramel wood-varnish malts and grapefruit hops that are equally matched dance partners. Mouthfeel is full, like pulpy OJ or peachy iced tea, and the drinkability is quite good for a beer this size. Towards the finish, a sour lactic, earth-laden, almost metallic flavor is the sole niggling kernel of doubt about the can format, but it could be a by-product of yeast. Worth a shot, especially if you require cans for some reason. (Upon popping the can, which feels a little flimsy, a shot of beer may shoot out and either spray your hand or deposit itself on the counter. Also, you will probably not want to tip the glass during the pour if you want any head at all; if you don't tip, the head will be full, thick, creamy, and lace-inducing, and it won't come over the edges of the pint glass.)"
"The only negative: no head space/breathing room meant a strangly carbonated-yet-flat mouthfeel. Oh well. For the fun factor, this one is definately recommended."
"What can i say? Very drinkable and would make an excellent camping beer as the label suggests."
"12oz can: I love it, a good beer in a can. There are sometimes that you cant have bottles and this is a great idea! The beer pours a slightly orangish color. There was a large frothy head with a decent amount of lacing. There is good hop aroma, with mainly grapefruit notes. Nice bitter taste, with a suprisingly light sweetness in the aftertaste. This is a really decent beer. Can you bring this to CT? Thanks for the beer, Jay!"
"A clear orange-amber body rests gently beneath a short head of white that holds well and leaves some very nice lace about the glass. The nose delivers a combination of bright, fruity (more orange than grapefruit) and mildly piney hops along with a splash of yeasty fruitiness and a base of sweetish malt. It's crisp in the mouth without being overly aggressive, and it fades smoothly and cleanly from the palate. The flavor is bold, to say the least, and seems to add a light touch of diacetyl to it's already rich and fairly complex profile. It's exceptionally well balanced by a solid bitterness that allows its malt sweetness to shine before drying in the finish; and it's delicately pine-like hop flavors linger in the finish along with a touch of doughy maltiness. Quite nice! This beer deserves far more attention than it gets (and the fact that it's available in a can is a complete bonus!). Go get some!!!"
"Overall an excellent pale ale, more towards IPA territory (and a good one at that). It has the excellent mix of fruitiness and piney hops that I love. Very well balanced."
"Great packaging! I drank this out of the can, so I didn't actually observe the appearance. The most impressive thing about this beer is the aroma. Even out of the can the smell of fresh northwest hops was intense. Unfortunatly the hops are completely over the top in the flavor of this beer, overpowering everything else. Don't know why they chose to call this a pale ale. It would be over the top for an IPA. The mouth feel was harsh, despite the light carbonation. Wouldn't drink another. A shame, because their Old Chub is outasight."
"($13.99 / 12-pack of cans)"
"Pours a nice amber color with a thunderous head that quickly dissipates. Nose is all citrusy hops -- nothing wrong with that. Taste is mostly citrus with hints of sweet malt and perhaps a tiny roasty edge -- very nice! Exceptionally drinkable for a 6.5% ABV brew. No wonder I drink so damned much of it!"
"tasty stuff, with plenty of hops...just what turns my crank."
"Overall impression: Wow - great canned beer. Perfect for camping trips, or just around the house. This should probably be an IPA though - definitely heavy on the hops."
"Drinkability  Theyd call this an IPA in many parts of the country. I would have liked to have seen a bit bigger body to go with the massive hop bitterness, but if you like hoppy bitter brews youll enjoy this one. Its probably the hoppiest beer that you can drink right down then crush the container flat against your forehead (all the while singing, Louie, Louie, of course)."
"EDIT:My review says it was on tap, it was actually from the can."
"Nice drinkable pale ale, I suspect that the can preserved the original taste of this beer very well."
"This beer won the Pale Ale category at a tasting I held Sunday. Just to allay fears, not a single person mentioned anything about metallic flavors in this blind tasting. Its a light copper body with a good head. Theres a bit of caramel and citrus rind hops in the aroma. A touch of grass. Very fresh tasting hops. A bit of lingering bitterness in the flavor. Very good."
"Not bad at all. Certainly good enough for my next backwoods camping trip."
"Sweet, solid, sugary malt flavors up front, followed by a balancing dose of spruce sap hops. Bitter finish with a touch of residual malt sweetness. More malt than a lot of pale ales Ive joyfully encountered lately. A very good one too. Surprisingly big body, chewy malts, and an appetizingly bitter finish. More reminiscent of a good, malty IPA. The best beer Ive ever had from a can? Probably so far!"
"Hmmm a canned beer that is supposed to be good? Definitely worth a try so I can have something to break to places that dont allow bottles if it is indeed good. This poured out of the can a slightly hazy copper color with a tall rising rocky off white head of foam. Pretty good retention and it left big chucks of foamy lace around the glass as it was drank, very appetizing appearance. Aroma is made up of mainly a strong citric hop smell that is backed by slightly doughy malt. Not to complex but a solid nose. The grapefruit hop flavor is what comes through at the front of the taste with piney notes and a bitter finish. A bit of caramel malt peeks through as well when this warmed up a bit, add a touch of depth to the taste that makes for a balanced pale ale. Good medium mouthfeel with sufficient carbonation. I am fairly impressed with this beer, while not the best tasting pale ale it is all around solid and a great canned beer."
"Notes: Redeems the canned beer name. It would be a great six pack to take somewhere that bottles are banned."
"Pours a bright clear copper color with a tan well proportioned head. An aroma of American hops (grapefruit, citrus, and pine) plus some un-recognizable weird aroma that quickly fades. A nice sharp pale ale that finishes with a nice bitterness and it has lots of hop flavor. Definitely hop dominated, though there is a bit of biscuity maltiness in here, as well as some sweet malt character. This is definitely a well crafted pale ale that I would be happy to take on a camping trip. As my palate becomes used to this beer I get a solid contribution from crystal malt. It starts in the middle and goes through to the finish."
"Don't let the can fool you - this is a damn fine pale ale. Poured out a golden orange with a slight haze and a solid bubbly head. Aroma of floral & citous hops, perhaps a slight mango tinge to it. Taste is very clean & refreshing. The hop characteristics that dominate the aroma don't show up like crazy in the taste, rather we have a fairly citrousy, decently malted, very bitter brew. The grapefruity bitterness shows up in the finish, just where you want it. Mouthfeel is clean and smooth with a low carbonation factor. Drinkable? All day long. If you enjoy pale ale's or IPA's, don't pass on this one. A good, solid pale ale and immensly refreshing."
"Clear bronzy-coppery in hue, it is a lovely color; the white head reached a modest half a finger in height. The retention was decent, it turn to a soapy residue. The subsequent lacing was messy and webby. The nose is stereotypical APA, which is fine by me, the hops are soft but citrusy, some flowers too, the maltiness is soft with caramel notes and there is a pleasant hint of sweetness, ale fruitiness as well. I really like the bouquet on this Pale Ale, simple but very inviting. The palate is very respectable, good, crisp hops bitterness upfront that imparts a grapefruit flavor, it is a little raw and Im digging that, flowery, the malt adds good balance and a bit of flavor, toasty-bread and caramel. I could also detect a note of brown sugar and leafiness. The finish is appropriately dry. This is a nice little Pale Ale here, ordinary but good. Medium in body with firm enough carbonation, the mouthfeel is a little too rigid but it is acceptable. I found it to be quite drinkable and on par with the countless middle of the road APAs. Maybe I bought this because I wanted to try a micro from a can, maybe it is a gimmick and I fell for it, maybe not. Maybe the future of craft beer is here! Anyway, I wish I could get it locally. Go ahead and buy it for the novelty but youll enjoy it because there is a tasty beer housed in that aluminum. I purchased a single can for $1.49 in Fort Collins."
"12 ounce can. Not my favorite pale ale, but certainly the best one I have ever had from a can!"
"This beer is really good and infinitely drinkable. I would try this one again."
"Taste-- I took the first two sips from the can and noticed no metallic notes or off tastes.. Upon pouring into a glass the flavours open up a bit. To me this tasted like a bit less flavourful SNPA. Nice and hoppy with just enough malt to balance. The hops add a nice dry finish to the beer. Drinkability is good as this would be a pretty good session brew especially when outdoors where glass is not allowed. While some may question the practise of canning this beer, I think it's great. Finally a beer you can take out where no glass is allowed and not have to suffer drinking swill. Plus the cans look so different you could probably walk down the beach or street and not get a second look drinking out of it."
"Flavors were modest. Tastes of sweet malts and very hoppy with flavors of grapefruits possible of other citrus fruits from the hops. Very dry and well hopped. Very bitter and not sweet like some."
"The beer pours a translucent amber color with the head large, creamy and an off white color with the lace forming a tight skirt around the glass. Sweet malt nose reinforced by some floral spiciness from the hops, crisp, clean, fresh, Marvelous. Front is thick malt, sweet and pleasing to the palate with the top moderate in its feel. Finish is lenient in its acidity, the hops powerful in their bite, quite dry aftertaste that is semi-sweet and a real pleasure to quaff."
"For a beer from a can, I was pleasantly surprised by this brew. It's always a little weird pouring it out of a can, mentally I think I am going to drink a Budweiser. The beer is nice looking, honey in color, with a little head. The aroma has some definite fruitiness along with the the floral hops and sweet aroma of malts. A thin feeling beer but it the taste of this beer is purdy darn good, the spicy fruit flavors accompanied by a not too strong sweet maltiness, and the good presence of hops leaves a little bite at the end. A very drinkable brew."
"Good Pale Alethis is one Id seek out again: the flavor created where pineapple pastry meets grapefruit was unusual and intriguing. Im glad I bought two cans"
"Pours with a creamy, barely off-white head that settles down over brilliantly clear golden liquid. Nose holds lots of malt and hoppiness (Cascades?) giving off crisp aromas. Taste has a depth of sweet maltiness ahead of a hefty dose of snappy hops that come together nicely. Finishes dry and pleasantly bitter...one of the best canned beers I can remember drinking."
