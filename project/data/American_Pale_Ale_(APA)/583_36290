3.87,2.9,3.5,4,3.75,4,4,"Interesting brew. Strong hops aroma as well as floral esters. A strong malt backbone with quite the hops kick in the finish. Smooth and creamy feel, very drinkable. I could see it as a session beer.","Gajo74","Mar 30, 2015"
3.86,2.7,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,4,"Mostly clear yellow gold with a small, but nicely creamy, sticky white head.  Smells citrusy at first - orange and grapefruit - giving way to more pungent floral aromas, leafy herbs, and raw grain.  Flavor is pretty much standard, classic APA: floral/citrus Cascade hop bitterness, light resin, and a clean malty sweetness underneath.  Medium bodied, finishing clean and dry.  Nothing memorable, but it doesn't really do anything wrong either.  Good,straightforward APA.","wedge","Mar 29, 2015"

3.81,1.3,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"A rather nice looking beer... The big soapy near white head makes this look delectable. Lace is spotty. The beer is a nice shade of golden amber, and once the head calms down a quarter inch layer hangs on. Aroma is lightly sweet with a nice crisp and semi juicy hop aroma over a bed of grainy malt. Dank tropical fruit mixed with zesty citrus, and some grassy floral. Taste is dry and briskly hopped with doughy, slightly caramel maltiness. The hop bitterness is evenly dispersed throughout and lingers on for awhile after the finish. Good well balanced beer with a slightly forward hop presence. Very likable and also sessionable. Good stuff!","tastybeer","Mar 25, 2015"

This one pours a clear brass topped by a finger of off-white foam and populated by some random floaties.  The nose comprises dry grapefruit peel, mild biscuit, light toffee, and a touch of pine resin.  The taste focuses on the resin, though some grapefruit rind, dried caramel, and mild grass contribute as well.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a decent pale ale, but not one that can stand up to the heavy hitters of the style.","TMoney2591","Feb 02, 2015"

A third of an inch of creamy off white head. The aroma reveals some pale malt,a sweetness of hops that with this blend almost deliver a honey like sweetness that is more of a cereal grain aroma. You do get pale malt blending fairly well with citrus and pine like hops that seem to illicit that sweetness hinted at with the aroma. The mouth is dry,slightly warm,and then prickly from the hop bitterness. In the end there's a fading bitterness from the hops.","Franziskaner","Jan 24, 2014"

Flavor ample hop bitterness a bit of hop pellet concentrated hop action with some hop flavors layered in I would go with mild dank cannabis and citric earthy hops actually quite nice...enough sweetness to keep things rolling but really the hops shine here. A bit of biscuit malt just enough to make the beer balanced. Mouthfeel is slick with hop oils from the dry hopping process medium bodied crisp carbonation feels good going down.

This one, seems not too well known outside it's local area, is a damn good beer. I hadn't been in the States for some years and was quite impressed with the improvements and availability of good craft beers (you are excused, Utah) and I recall going into a bottle shop somewhere in Middle America, land of Bud Light, and asking for something 'dry hopped'. The knowledgeable guy in the shop sold me this. Full flavored, well hopped, it is a fine one!","migwell","Mar 30, 2013"

Very minimal lacing throughout the glass. The nose was very clean and seemed like a lot of crystal malt and very mild bitter nose. Definitely not the usual ""west coast"" hope smell, but more of a mild, slightly resinous nose. The taste was very much like the nose with a good, balanced malt backbone, slightly bready with a stinging bitterness and a spring of citrus at the end. Good mouthfeel, very smooth with nice carbonation. Very solid offering in a pale ale.","estlinska","Mar 12, 2013"

The aroma consisted of malted grain and citric hops. Medium in body, smooth and creamy mouthfeel- There is a foundation of sweet malted grain, piney hops, and a touch of fruity apple.- Overall, it is a nice example of the style, great session beer and an excellent ""entry level"" APA.

Apparently several people felt the Schlafly APA rivals the Dust....I say ""ney ney""! The appearance of this beer is a good copper color, clear with great carbonation and finger thick white head that is lacing. The aroma is hoppy and can smell the bitterness with touches of grapefruit. The taste is a decent hop taste mostly of bitter citrus (grapefruit). Hardly any pine or floral notes that I could pick up. The beer lingers on the pallet but overall a decent taste. The mouthfeel is smooth....not overly bitter. Worth a try....but I do not like it more than Z'Dust.","WoodBrew","Sep 26, 2011"

3.26,-13.3,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Pine hops up front that give way to a long and citrusy finish. Pretty bitter in a citrus hop sort of way, but some off flavors from a heavier malt bill than I expected. This gets in the way of a pretty fantastic lemon taste in the back, as well as a lemon bitterness that would make this really well balanced and lighter in body. There is a certain biscuit quality to this that takes away from potentially delicious citrus hops. That said, this is still a pretty good beer, one that would satisfy most hop heads. Mouthfeel is a little on the watery side and doesn't add much to the overall end product. Solid and passable APA, and the dry-hopping is definitely present, but some room for improvement is there.","chodinheaven","Sep 18, 2011"

A citrus hoppiness is more assertive than on most pale ales; the smell of caramel maltiness seems pretty normal. The taste is hoppy on the front and back palates, with malts more apparent on the middle. Overall, the hop to malt ratio is not as balanced as some of the better pale ales, but I don't think balance was the intended objective. This is an excellent beer for pub food of all sorts. I quite like it.","droomyster","Aug 30, 2011"

I'm going to skip straight to smell and taste on this one. I thought for sure I was diving into a Schlitz or Schaeffer. The nose just had a high level of maltiness too it. The hops were very faint, although this isn't an IPA so it's not exactly designed to be a hopcentric offering. The taste is VERY malty and quite bitter.

3.67,-2.4,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"O - A decent APA, but one that departs from IPA origin and really leans to the side of just a pale ale. While I like the hop character of this beer, it’s not astounding.

There is a lot of grassy/hops smells, but there is a fresh bready element too. The taste is much more herbal and hoppy than the Schafly Pale Ale, but the bready malts flavors come out even more in this beer. I even get a little green pepper vibe that I will attribute to the crisp, clean bite. There is great complexity in the balance here, and I am thrilled that I’m not suffering through a sweet, heavy bodied, syrupy beer. This is a solidly crafted beer where the flavors sits on the tongue and invokes the next sip, without leaving a mucky gross taste that you find yourself wanting to wash down. This is medium bodied, but definitely something I could have a few of.","beerdown77","May 26, 2011"

Bright malty aroma, fresh grain with a pleasant, resinous hoppiness and some spicy yeast notes. A heavy malt flavor, not overly sweet though. However, there is a strong bitterness without much to balance it. Resinous and earthy hops. The mouthfeel is also out of whack from the perceived bitterness of the beer. I'm usually a fan of resinous, pine tree hops but this one is a bit overboard on the bitterness without much hop flavor to show for it.","goldbot","May 15, 2011"

Medium-bodied, good firmness and mouth presence, the carbonation adds percolation, doesn't distract. Tangerine, orange, white grapefruit drier here, still in the driver's seat. Leafy hops verge on bitter at times, rye bread, flowers join in. Hint of caramel. Apricot, pineapple, nectarine fruit carves out a moderate presence.

Pleasant aftertaste brought on from the dry hopping. Soft, creamy mouthfeel. Good, bitter bite on the way down. This is an easy drinking beer with a low abv that i really enjoyed.

The smell is the only thing that puts me off a bit, but the flavor is the most important part, so I would definitely recommend this beer as a very drinkable beer for anyone who likes a pale ale.

The head is at least an inch, dense and white, which ends up leaving very nice lacing. A good looking pale ale. The smell is nice. It's very clean, filled with a light sugary, caramelly sweetness, with some crusty bread. The hops are nice, a bit zesty and leafy, but not incredibly robust. Seems nice and a bit better than normal. The taste is nice too. Clean and refreshing. A slightly bready, sweet, and nutty malt comes up, with a layer of slightly herbal hops. The bitterness is low, the hops have a bit of pollen a hint of sweet lime, kind of leafy. It's really nice, but not one that will really wow you. The body is about medium, the carbonation provides a nice rush, but doesn't really sting. I think it's good. The drinkability is very good. I think it's almost as good as it gets as far as a drinkable beer. This could make a very pleasant night of drinking. It doesn't overdo it on bitterness or resins, a nice smooth, slightly sweet malt body. I would probably buy it again.","taylorhamrick","Sep 28, 2009"

Still west coast type hops, citrusy and piney. The hops are still apparent in the flavor, grapefruit comes to mind immediately, slightly resinous and piney. A solid malt backbone to balance but this is definitely a hop forward beer. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a creamy, velvety carbonation.

Some floral hops with a fruity aspect of apples or grapes. Tastes were much sweeter than expected, especially initially. Very fruity with an apple and grape juice taste, some faint toasted grains. A slight citrus and floral hop taste comes in towards the finish. Finishes dry, but fairly sweet. About half way through, the hops seem to come through more, offering some bitterness and hop oils. Mouth-feel is thin to medium bodied with more carbonation than expected, but still seems ok to me. Towards the end, the hops continue to build on the palate, and the dryness keeps you coming back for another sip. I guess I was expecting more of a hop profile because of the giant hop cone on the label, but in the end, this is a great example of an American Pale Ale with tremendous balance. I liked the fruitiness which offered a refreshing taste with excellent drinkability.","barnzy78","Jul 30, 2009"

Quite tasty for someone like me who isn't really a hophead. Its about as hoppy as I like beer. Very drinkable, I have no problem putting back five or six of these in a sitting.

The floral aroma is very clean and crisp. It is not overly bitter but the hop flavor is predominant and you can tell that it has been dry hopped.

Taste follows the smell with piney hops to start but then developing into a surprisingly sweet malt flavor. Finish is moderate bitterness but a little too short.

Great retention and solid lacing. Aromas of piney hops and mint with sweet malts, and spices beneath. The flavors are again hops-forward, piney and citric. A malty/bready character appears in the middle to add some gumption and balance. AS the beer warms it gets more drinkable and the hops provides a resin-like, tongue-coating, dry finish. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Sessionable and enjoyable. A very good example of the style and worth seeking out.","thekevlarkid","Aug 21, 2008"

And there is a fairly thick amount of citrus in there. As it warms it gets smoother and the sweet tone really becomes nice. Feel has a slight bite to the carbonation and the liquid is just a slight bit sticky but overall smooth. This is smooth and nice to drink. However. I say put this in a cask and treat it right.

This beer pours a clear, straw golden with a big frothy white head that left sticky lacing down the entirety of the glass. The aroma is piney hops, a hint of orange and a subtle malty sweetness. The taste is spot on for an APA. A nice piney hop presence that's not overpowering yet strong enough to let a mild bitterness reside on the tongue. The sweet malty backbone comes out in the finish to push the hops off the palate. Really nice an crisp mouthfeel. Its light with just a hint of dryness. This is a really easily drinkable brew by Schlafly. I really think that their best brews are their sessionable ones.","hwwty4","Aug 06, 2008"

A slightly malty scent at the front, that is soon followed by a strong floral aroma and the scent of sweet citrus, like an orange. The malt strikes the palate at the start, and stays with there till it reaches halfway. That is when a citrus flavors of lemon and mild grapefruit takeover. Those flavors blend to grassy, earthy finish. A bit of a watery start on the feel, it gains weight as it crosses the palate, to a more medium bodied feel.

The mouthfeel is nearly perfect for the style, with a crisp, spiced (albeit a bit thin) body that's both refreshing and appropriately carbonated. The aftertaste leaves a lasting, delightfully spicy & bitter hop finish.
