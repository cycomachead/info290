4.29,1.9,4.5,4.75,4,4.25,4.25,"This is a good beer, but I feel like it's strangely similar to Yum Yum. Maybe it's the a certain type of hops the two share, or something. But I enjoyed Yum Yum, and I enjoyed this. This one had a bit of the same funky taste, which I didn't care for. Not sure what specific ingredient or brewing technique attributes to this, but if anyone knows what type of hops SSMF, Yum Yum, and Alpha King are made with, I'd be curious to know. While this is good, I'm not sure I could tell the difference between this and another 3F PA in a blind taste test.","do_ob","Mar 29, 2015"

Excellent blend of bitterness with the fruitiness of the hops and a slight sweetness to balance.

The taste has more spicy hop flavor with some nice big green herbal flavor and a green citrus pith finish, although it is not bitter or even pungent for the most part.  There is some tropical fruit notes as it opens and a lime hop flavor in the finish.  The creamy mouthfeel has a hop boosting crisp fizz.  This has nice full hops that are big but not punishing.

It's also clearly very citrusy. I get a bit of minty hops, too. There is also a light cookie sweetness. The flavor births a lot of unique hoppy descriptors in my mind. I get the citrus and melon right away. I also get the mint and a hard to describe, earthy flavor. I'd like to know what hops are being used here. As it warms I get more sweetness, grain and candied citrus character. Hops also taste lightly lemony. Surely a memorable flavor. The body is relatively light. Nice carbonation; quite spritzy. Bitterness is noticeable but not overbearing. Pretty much an IPA for all intents and purposes. I rarely get to try Three Floyds beers and was very happy to get this one in my grasp. Would love more.","VelvetExtract","Nov 15, 2014"

4.39,4.3,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,"The beer pours a clear golden amber with a fluffy white head that settles into a thin blanketing while drinking. The nose is ripe with grapefruit and slightly floral, has a great malty sweetness, and negligible booze. This smells similar to ZD, but is less citra-forward. The taste is generously hopped, but not overly bitter, and doesn't seem dominated by a single hop characteristic. The hop profile feel west coasty, but still maintains that perfect malt characteristic that sets 3 floyds APAs apart. It's relatively light-bodied, balanced, well carbonated, clean, and very hop-centric - but still 10/10 in drinkability (the bomber drinks faster than some 12oz bottles). I'd highly recommend this buy if you can grab fresh bottles.","ThePorterSorter","Aug 08, 2014"

This sip started appropriately sweetly, progressing to a full, herbal, bitter, malty, and organically complex flavoring. The finish was particularly interesting, with big starchiness and licorice bite. The latter was also noted in the aroma, adding bitterness there to the otherwise sweetly blended base. The more you drink this beer the better it gets, as the flavoring and sip muddle a bit when cold. This beer will blossom for you closer to cellar temps, and sip very nicely.","TheBrewo","Apr 16, 2013"
