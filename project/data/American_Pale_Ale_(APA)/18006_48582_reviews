"O - Daisy Cutter is exceptional with the level of intense flavor it's punching at. It tastes like something twice it's size. A world class pale ale in a can and I hope I can get ahold of more of this in the future."

"It's probably a good thing, for the sake of my bank account and marriage, that I can't get this beer locally. This is one of the best beers I've ever had, and probabaly THE best pale ale, in terms of a session beer. It's perfect in all aspects. All hail the Daisy Cutter."

"Draft into tulip glass.  Medium cloudy golden color.  Nice 1 finger head with decent retention and nice sticky lacing.  Outstanding aroma, heavy with grapefruit and pine.  Very promising. Mouthfeel and taste slightly underwhelmed.  Probably just because the aroma was so good.  If I could get this regularly it would make a near ideal session beer."

"One of the best pale ales I've had."

"A solid pale ale. Love it."

"2/5/15 Finley Dunnes (Draft) - Really enjoyed the taste of this IPA. Somewhat strong, but not overpowering, the beer went down easy and smooth. I liked the distinct taste, and will definitely order down the road."
"O (4.25) - Definitely glad to have the opportunity to try this, thanks to the always generous CuriousMonk.  The high drinkability is easily the highlight of this beer, and while the flavor might not blow you away, it's no slouch either.  Very well balanced and one I'd certainly drink again if given the chance."
"I'm buying a riding lawnmower."
""
"O: This is pretty good but not worth going out of your way for it's lighter flavor makes it seem like you could drink several pints of this at a bar. I'd definitely grab this if I were out and wanted something light."
""
"it's alright. I don't get the hype for it. I prefer Boat Beer by a mile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good but I don't see why it has as high a score as it does.  These guys really need to put some freshness dates on their cans since I have no idea if this is the beer at its best or not."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think i got an old can. cant find a date but its just very dull and watered down. Barely any  hop character and the malts actually star. But still not anything special. Hoping i get the chance to try this fresh as i know its going to be great!"
"From a can at least 2 months old.   Great nose and even better taste.  Still hoppy and almost a perfect malt balance.  Will seek out again."
""
""
"From can. First serving I poured into glass while my second serving I drank from can. I prefer drinking from the can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  I always pick up some of this when I'm in range.  Distinctive taste profile that really hits some of my favorite notes."
""
"Weak flavor. Makes no statement"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a bona fide Chicago favorite. Hop forward APA with citrus/floral notes and a solid malt backbone. Great bitter finish that lingers on the tastebuds. One of my ’go to’ beers."
""
""
""
"O: A Chicago staple and for good reason.  One of my favorite pale ales.  Outstanding beer."
"Drink local. Poured at Poor Phil's, Oak Park, IL."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Juicy and balanced to the t.  Had a can from have fives owner."
""
""
"O- Got this as an extra in a quick IP trade and really appreciate the chance to try it. This is definitely a great pale ale an is one of the best smelling pales I've had. Really enjoyed the drinkablity of it. If I lived in their distribution I would certainly have this in my rotation. I thought maybe there was a touch of Citra in here given I think it smells a bit like Zombie Dust but all info online seems to say it's Warrior, Centennial, Simcoe, Amarillo, and Columbus. Maybe the combo of Centennial and Amarillo and Simcoe is giving me that Juicy Friut hop aroma. Guess I'm not getting any better at the identifying hop thing."
""
""
""
"Tried it again to confirm my initial take, only from a can this time. Same impression. This beer is just not for me."
""
""
""
"Very earthy and hoppy IPA."
""
""
""
"Not sure if it was just the can I had, but this one had a sour taste.  I was expecting a hoptacular blow out but it didn't deliver"
"O. A nice pale ale from half acre. Nothing really special but nothing bad at all. Very easy to drink.  A safe bet for an always satisfying beer."
""
""
""
""
"Very good, balanced brew that was an extra I received on a trade."

"Beautiful gold color with light head, minimal lacing and plenty of tiny bubbles from the carbonation continually striving to reach the top. Smell is on the light side, and comes across with hop resin and citrus. Light taste with an amazing balance of hop bitterness, grapefruit rind and light malt. Really well balanced !!!!. Feels great going down with just the right amount of carbonation; refreshing!!. Light hop bitterness aftertatste. Nice job on this one. Thanks to FFF Junkie for this beer!!!"

"Almost perfect. Light, delicious, might be good for sessions."
""

"Love it.  Hard to pin down, but works as a one of a kind, interesting ale  -- grassy, citrusy, dry --  great mouth feel. Best in summer."
""
""

"we did a blind taste test with this, zombie dust, and sierra Nevada.  This came in first with our group of 6."

"In the end, Daisy Cutter's not a beer for all times, nor the most special or precious of ales; but it's nevertheless a beer befitting most times, and that's its own genuine speciality."

"Pounder can picked up as an extra in a trade with Pmoney over on BA... Nice trade Patrick, thanks for the cool extra. Poured into my standard tulip... 2 finger rises up and sticks around for a while leaving good lace as it drops... fairly clear golden brew. Aromas is citrus and floral hops... pretty clean. Bitterness up front on the palate reminds me of Dandelion brews I have had in the past... hop flavors trail off a little quickly, doesn’t really strike me as ""West Coast"".. Very drinkable. Light body with good carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Got some of this in a trade for Pseudo Sue. Poured with a small head. Really nice looking cloudy straw, slightly orange body. Fresh citrus aroma. Some earthy smell too. Taste is awesome. Very bitter, but still nice and juicy. Like eating fresh grapefruit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very weak tasting pale ale with good hop bitterness.  Guess I was hoping for more of an IPA."

"O - Great Pale Ale. Flavorful for 5%, but was hoping for a little more, after all of the hype. It's no ZD or PseudoSue, but I prefer this to SN's Pale, and coupling the aspects of affordability and availability, this is a high-tier American pale that deserves attention from any beer appreciator."

"Loved the smell and taste. Fairly hop-forward, but not over the top.  It is a terrific beer, which is great because I'd had it on my wishlist for a couple of years. Somehow, I made 4 or 5 trips to Chicago last year without finding it -- not at Binny's nor in a restaurant."

"Overall, really great hop character and nicely well-balanced. I wish I could drink this all the time."
"O: not as sharp and tight as I've grown accustomed to... but still a standout, punchy APA"
"Really impressed with this beer, I definitely want to trade for this and drink more."
"Pours a hazy but brightish light copper; medium head with solid lacing. So darn smooth and enjoyable. Balanced and refreshing with great aftertaste. No where near the bite or the complexity of Daisy Cutter's brethren God Hates Astronauts. But at 5.2% should be obvious. Recommended."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, hint of earthy malt, sweet malt, hint of alcohol, slight floral hops, and yeast. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Bitterness is too prevalent for my preference. Tastes of earthy malt, citrus hops, slight sweet malt, hint of floral hops, and a hint of yeast. Overall, good appearance, earthy malt dominates both aroma and body, otherwise average pale ale."

"This was on my ""wants"" list for far too long, and I am happy to say it lived up to my high expectations. Beautiful color & nice head with lots of sticky retention. The nose told me I would love this beer, and I did! Amazing, fresh hoppy flavor, and excellent dank after-taste. Love it!"
""
""
""
""
"Generally very well-integrated with medium body, but there's a hint of aqueousness on the finish."
""
""
""
"D: Very drinkable. Nice brew. No overpowering bitterness from hops. More of a malt presence than ZD like bread and biscuits. Does not seem to showcase a particular hop like other APAs. Just an extremely all around well made beer. More even keeled than ZD and overall a better beer."

"This is an enjoyable, hop-forward American Pale Ale. I'm glad a bartender at a local pub brought two pint-sized cans back from his trip to Chicago for me!"

"More my next time through IL"

"This is my go-to beer whenever I need something dependable. So crisp and smooth. Light-bodied and just the right amount of hops. Good for any season. There's not many pale ales out there that can compete with this. Even better is the brewery is right up the street!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the better pale ales out there, Daisy Cutter offers big hops from another perspective.  Rather than a fruit bomb, it goes floral.  In fact, I cannot think of another pale ale or IPA that is more clearly dedicated to exploring this aspect of hop esters.  As such it is an innovative and delicious alternative, and one I seek out when I am in the Chicago area."

"O- this is one of my favorite pale ales and it's local which is great! To me this is a perfect beer for sitting outside on a hot summer day. Love this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a cloudy honey with a quarter inch foamy head. Foamy lacing. Mild fruit on the nose. The taste is mildly of fruit, maybe some mango? A bitter finish. This beer felt weak to me, with an odd seltzer-like mouthfeel. A decent ale, but nothing special considering the high ratings. One I could take or leave in the future."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"M - Absolutely fantastic, all pales should strive for this. Medium bodied or less maybe, decently carbonated, incredibly drinkable and crisp."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Can from Kevin. Thanks! Pours golden with just a hint of haze and. One finger white head. Nice grassy hop aroma, pale malts, some light honey sweetness. Flavor follows with lots of grassiness and hay, dry, very light malt sweetness, maybe a bit of citrus. Very light bodied, goes down super easy with a dry finish and lots of carbonation. Good stuff. Wish I could get this fresh all the time. Must be great to have out on the lakes."

"I went to the Taste of Randolph in Chicago yesterday. Nice warm day. The beer was served cold in a can, and I poured it into a plastic cup. It poured nicely and looked wonderful; then it tasted great. This was a perfect beer for the weather and event."

"Half Acre Daisy Cutter Pale Ale ---4.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an unfiltered orange color with a white head that leaves some lace behind. The aroma is piney, citrusy and herbal. In the taste, more citrusy tropical notes, solid bitterness and floral touches. Daisy Cutter is an apt name for this bomb of hop flowers. Bitter and resinous, with a dry hop bite and biscuity malt profile. Medium, smoother body with a medium high carbonation. Overall, this is a classic pale ale, better than most IpAs."
""
""
""
"O: A solid, repeat drinker, and arguably one of the best pale ales coming out of Chicago proper."
""
""
""
""
""
"Found a two week old case of 16 oz cans a bounds in warrington, PA. As far as true pale ales go, this is about as good as it gets. I say that with FFF zombie dust and alpha king in mind.. Which are both bordering on IPA. Pours a beautiful cloudy golden... Smell off the charts. Taste damn near perfect just a tad weak at the finish(it's only 5.2 percent). Really really good stuff!!"
""
""
"After hearing from friends in the midwest just how great this beer is, I was finally able to try some for myself. And thanks to one of the rising stars of the craft beer community, I was able to buy it locally. J&H Beer on Route 315 in Wilkes-Barre(or Pittston, whatever)- get there soon if you're in NEPA. This beer is just fantastic, it's everything I had hoped it would be. Crisp, clean, refreshing, with a touch of fruit notes at the end. I poured the 16oz can into a snifter and sat on my deck enjoying the evening. A perfect beer for summer.. or anytime!"
""
""
""

"really nice flavor - again west coast bitter hops, what seems to be rye malts, and a very mild yeast character. Well balanced, easy drinker, slightly bready, slightly bitter...just an all around great pale ale. Id buy often if it was available to me on a regular basis."

"Overall: An incredible APA. Easily one of my top 3 overall. The incredible aroma and flavor are rounded out by a supreme drinkability. At 5.2% it won't knock you out, and I could easily drink three of these without feeling fatigued in both sobriety and palate. A fantastic APA that I highly recommend everyone try. Will be a go-to offering for me whenever I'm home in IL."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is one of the best APA's I've had in a while, showcasing a nice hop bill yet keeping all of the drinkability of the style. Unfortunately my only can, would gladly buy again if given the chance"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a tasty and impressive pale ale. lots of taste and hop character without leaving anything out. a good intro to half acre and lives up to everything it should."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid pale ale. I tend to prefer fruitier hop flavors/aromas than stood out from this which was more of a bittering hop, but it was not overwhelmingly bitter by any stretch. I will certainly have this beer again. I'd love to try the double daisy cutter if I can ever find it in philadelphia."
""
"OVERALL (4.25) - The best pale ale I've ever had. Better than SNPA (as far as I can rememeber), better than Mirror Pond, and yes, better than Zombie Dust (by a fair margin if you ask me). I'm surprised this isn't rated significantly higher."

"Not as fruity as I would like but overall a well done five hopped up craft. Very straight forward pale ale with no frills except the aroma is sensational. Hop lovers dream-can't even begin to imagine what the double is like!?!"
"Overall: Really delicious, really excellent pale ale. Lovely hop character, super aromatic, but also super drinkable. Not only could I spend a great deal of time simply smelling this beer, I could also drink it all day."

"Overall- Very nice pale. juicy and hop forward without being too bitter, but is balanced and easy to drink. First time it showed up in my area, and I think I will be getting more."

"Appearance is a light copper with a finger of fluffy white head that left some frothy lace behind. The nose is nicely hoppy. This offering has some fizziness that becomes noticeable as one begins sipping on it. The body is light and the flavor is crisp with a pleasing hop finish. This is a bit lighter in body than the best APAs, but it would certainly be something perfect to knock back in mass quantities on a hot summer day."

"I was blessed to hook up with a cigar smoking buddy, traded some cigars for this beer. A whole four pack to be exact it pours a perfect copper slightly hazed glowing orange hue with a bright white head. Aroma has floral citrus hop notes with ample malt fresh sliced bread. As it warms up more orange slices with a bit of crush aspirin and orange zest makes it's way into my nares, a good combo with the ample tame sweetness of the balancing malt character. Flavor wise it hits the palate with enough hops to keep this hop head interested, great citrus zest bitterness floral notes with a sweet honey biscuit malt to bring it home into a balance. Hops shine through to the finish, nice bone dry finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied ample smooth natural carbonation, cans are the way to go for these guys. Overall drinkability is great sessionable crazy good stuff, I can't wait to get more. I shared one can drank two on arrival and saved one for a review it went so fast!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great APA with a huge hoppy profile, and a lower sessionable abv. Definitely a beer to sit pack and have a few. If you love hops, then this is the Pale Ale for you!"

"If you are a fan of hops, this is an excellent beer. Hops do not just dominate, they overwhelm. This brew really should have been labeled an IPA as it is far hoppier than most IPA's. If you favor more balanced beers, you probably will not like this beer even though it is well made."

"A bright golden color with a great white head that lasts and lasts. The smell is unique - slightly citrusy but really grassy/weedy. I swear I smell dope. Taste is a great balance of malt and that citrus/weedy hop flavor. This is a great, highly quaffable, and rather unique tasting pale ale. A lot drier but more powerful than most."

"O: I'm not much of a pale ale fan, but I was very impressed by this brew. Fresh I can think of very few things I'd rather have on an easygoing afternoon -- this beer is wonderfully drinkable. I am really a fan of the hop selection for this, although maybe it's just a little too bitter. I'd definitely drink this again, though, and would probably keep it on-hand if I had regular access to it."

"Fresh can poured into a plastic glass. Looks to have a sticky white lacing. Just a bit Cloudy with dark golden color and lots of bubbles. Aroma is typical IPA. Hop profile is a bit grassy with pine and a hint of citrus. Bready malt. The malt aroma is a nice balance to the hops. Taste is nearly identical to the aroma. Hoppy first with a malty body and finishes pretty quickly with a bit of a bitter, resins finish. High carbonation. Low alcohol presence. Overall a solid IPA but nothing jumps out with this beer."
""
""
""
"O: Overall a good drinking pale with a higher edge of hoppiness and malt depth with sparkling carbonation gives this added appeal. Touch of lingering flowery hop dryness on the close. Feels closer to a ipa standards, crisp and very good rating."

"procured at a trader joes north of downtown Chicago near the botanic gardens in a four pack of pint cans. this is a wonderful beer, maybe the best ive had from Chicago. it has a rather large hop nose, English in some ways, more bitter than dank or fruity. there is also a soft floral element, that comes across like the flowers on the can are actually in the can, polleny and springtimey and gloriously grassy. good malt balance, English and American mixed, lighter than it seems, with a fresh cut hay and rising bread complexion. the flavor is the best parts of the nose, more hoppy than I first though, super different from the standard, and expertly made. the quality of this beer is most apparent in the feel though, which is creamy without being heavy, bubbly without being aggressive, and clean without being immaculate. its really fantastic beer, and an exceptional introduction to half acre beer. the floral finish and the bright hops and diverse malt unification make this a beer I wish I could get in upstate new York, where I am spending this summer, or in Denver where I live. this would be an everyday brew for me."
""
"Taste/feel: And with the taste and feel, it's the same old song and dance... and I love that. I enjoyed the smell a lot, and the taste gave me the same thing. A lot of floral flavors on the front turn to some semi-sweet malts, and then there's a fair amount of bitterness in the pretty dry finish that I just really enjoy. It's hard to stop sipping this beer, as it's truly outstanding. Worthy of the hype. Glad to have tried this, and looking forward to future beers from Half Acre."

"Overall this is a great pale ale, very drinkable"
"O Excellent. I had heard good things and mostly they were on the money. Good citrus and floral punch, but the sweetness and maltyness surprised me. A nice surprise it was. Top notch for the style. Maybe the perfect beer to have while lounging in the sun."

"Highly drinkable, tasty, and extremely flavorful pale ale. What else can you say? If this were available near me, it would definitely be one of my ""go-to"" beers, given the fact that it drinks as easy as water and it's only 5.2% ABV. Plus, I love beers that come in 16 oz. cans. If you're a pale ale fan, get you some Daisy Cutter right away."

"O: Overall, kind of disappointed in this one. Its a good beer, but personally I prefer my APA on the hoppier side of the spectrum. Im glad I was able to try it, but I dont think itd be a staple in my fridge even if it was available locally."
"Poured a copper color into a snifter glass, the beer produced a nice bright white head. The head dissipated momentarily leaving lacing along the rim of the glass. On detects a good hop profile in the aroma with notes of grass and citrus fruit. The aroma allows the drinker to know immediately that this is a pale ale. On the initial taste, the smoothness of this beer strikes me the most. The carbonation is less than abrasive, allowing the smoothness to shine. In the initial taste one detects lemon, grass, orange rind, and a hint of biscuit. As the taste hades to the back of the throat, the lemon is most apparent with the other notes fading to the sides. It is a hot day, and I do find this to be an easy drinker. The taste itself does not strike me as being particularly complex. In the big picture, this is a subtle and smooth pale ale."
""
""
""
"Light oragne color. 1-1.5"" white head. Has a bitter herb aroma. Daisys? Maybe I'm looking at the can too much (which is awesome). Some grassiness. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Could use a bit more carbonation. Pretty smooth going down. Leaves a touch of lingering bitterness."
""
""
"Golden orange, hazy, a half inch of chunky foam that laces nicely. Waves of tangerine, lemon zest, grapefruit rind and fresh pine on the nose. Very nice. Taste is delicate orange citrus, lightly grassy and light maltiness. Lightly bitter. Mouthfeel is medium with soft carbonation. This smells like a million bucks but the taste doesn't reach the same heights. Decent overall."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy light gold with a huge fluffy white head that persists forever leaving lots of stickies on the sides of the glass. Aromas of grapefruit pineapple and a hint of earth and flowers dominate the aroma allowing a light bready malt to barely peak through. The flavor is bready and honey like malt underneath a solid base of citrus and tropical fruits. Firm hop bitterness is never harsh. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick mouthfeel. Wow that's a fantastic pale ale right there."

"This beer smells fantastic, but tastes one-dimensional. Bitter. Very bitter and nothing else. It's like they mixed water and ""bitterness"" together and didn't add anything else. I say ""bitterness"" and not ""hops"" because there are different hops out there with various flavor characteristics. This is one of few beers I actively avoid drinking."

"I am not a huge fan of hoppy beers, but this one was very, very good. Served in a plastic cup pint (St. Patrick's Day weekend) at the Temple Bar in Chicago. Good aroma off a one inch head. Very bright and clean that surprises you off the first drink with a ""what was that?"" mouthfeel. Floral, grassy, and grapefruit in the best possible way. I will say that I liked the first pint better than the second (and third), but will definitely drink this one any time I find it. I am just close enough to Chicago that I will try to hunt down the cans."

"I would like to thank my good friend Vince for giving me the chance to try this great American Pale Ale. I found it hard to put this beer down. I would love to drink this beer again if I could find it in my part of the country."
""
"Overall... if this had been released in the late 70's or early 80's it would have been labelled an IPA for sure (despite the bitterness level, it has a greater perceived bitterness due to the malt balance). But times have changed. This reminds me of a super amped-up version of another well-known pale ale. It's not as refined to be sure, but it makes up for that in presence. Or should I just say ""in your face"" character? It's the modern day version of an American pale ale. Worth trying."

"Pours a cloudy bright orange color with a finger and a half of a white head that dissipates to a nice thick lacing. Nice carbonation coming off the glass. How a pale ale should look. Smells of tons of floral notes, some resinous, dank qualities, grapefruit, a soapy quality to it, some juicy fruits like pineapple. Do get some bread and grain as well from the malt. Taste starts with some resinous, yet juicy qualities from the hops such as grapefruit, just tons of floral, almost a perfume-like flavor. Then the middle brings some balance with wheat notes, grain, and carmel. Get some qualities here that may suggest some to say it is ""watered down," but I disagree. The finish is more of the prominent floral qualities of the hops, as well as some pine, grass, pineapple, grapefruit, carmel. Crisp, light body with a creamy and thin mouthfeel. This is not on the Alpha King or Zombiedust level for apa’s, but it is definitely a quality, hoppy pale ale that I would gladly have anytime I can get my hands on some."

This is really the only time I've ever had it where I wasn't satisfied with the carbonation – I imagine its the growler. I still love this beer, and its really a go to beer in terms of overall satisfaction."
"O - This is a phenomenal pale ale. Dangerously drinkable. Huge hop flavor, nice balance."

"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation levels of medium-low intensity, creating a slightly foamy mouthfeel that is primarily smooth. Closes dry, with modest stickiness lingering across the palate."

"From notes, 3/29/11. Pours a radiant tangerine fading to amber at the edges. The head is a rocky mass of white bubbles that stick to the walls of the glass in clumps. A beautiful beer. The aroma is a bright splash of hops. It’s a mix of floral and citric notes, grapefruits, clementines and honeysuckle. There’s very little malt presence. From the color, I assume that a decent amount of crystal malt found its way into the beer, but it barely shows in the aroma. A hint of caramel is all I’m really getting. There might be a touch of butterscotch but it’s definitely not problematic. It tastes dry and hoppy. There’s little bitterness but good citric, grassy hop flavor. A little bit of wateriness creeps in, but at a mere 5.2% abv, it’s forgivable. The finish has a touch of caramel, a lot of grassy/earthy hop flavor and medium bitterness for the style. The mouthfeel is suprisingly smooth. It’s easy to drink and easy to like. This would be a good beer to drink in quantity particularly because it provides hoppiness without wearing out the palate overmuch."

"16 ounce can into pint glass, no canning date. Pours very hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, tangerine, floral, pine, light bread, grass, light citrus rind, and herbal earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, pineapple, floral, pine, grass, citrus rind, bread, and piney spiciness. Nice amount of citrus and piney bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus rind, floral, pine, grass, bread, and piney spiciness on the finish for a while. Incredible hoppy flavor complexity and balance; with no cloying flavors present on the finish other than citrus bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a sticky and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible pale ale! Huge hoppy flavors with nice complexity; very smooth and crisp to drink. An insanely delicious offering as expected."

"O - I typically only drink APA when I am looking for a session beer, not when I will sit down an review. This one caught my attention because of the tall can and good reviews. I was impressed with the flavor this one had in a low gravity offering. Big floral hops and citrus notes are perfectly complimented by the subtle biscuit/cracker malts. Next time I am in need of an outdoor sessionable beer with loads of flavor, this is where I will turn. Highly recommended."

"Overall (4.5/5): Daisy Cutter's best qualities are its high-quality taste and mouthfeel–what it's all about when we're talking about beer. For that, it gets a 4.5 out 5. Daisy Cutter makes excellent drinking at any time of the year. Its massive amount of hop flavor will certainly attract the hop heads, but its mild strength, price-point, and accessibility will also win plenty of beer drinkers over who aren't necessarily big fans of IPA or more aggressively hoppy beer. Check it out if you're in Chicago. She's a beaut."
""

"Overall I am not sure I would put this in my top pale ales. It might be since I have not had many IPA's lately (mostly winter warmers and fall spiced beers) but I could see what they were trying to make. A smooth, bitter dry hopped pale ale."

""

"O- A really decent beer from one of my favorite breweries. The smell and initial taste are awesome, but the long bitter aftertaste is a little overdone and doesn't bode well with me. Other than that this beer is great."

"This poured out as a slightly hazy looking golden orange color with a white head on top. The retention is good and the lacing is sticky. The beer smells like fresh floral hops with some booze and malt on the nose. The taste of the beer is pretty hoppy from start to finish. The flavors upfront are mostly sweet malt that quickly fades into the earthy and floral bitterness of the hops. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a delicate carbonation to it. Overall this is a very nice beer, I would drink a lot of this one if I could. It gives off the essence of flowers and I find that to be pretty impressive. It's very good."

"Bright amber yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a billowy white foam that reduced to a wispy cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Pungent floral and fresh citrus hop aromas are dominant with an underlying sweetness. Not surprisingly this hop-centric ale has a body that leans to the lighter side, with a smooth, watery, thinly carbonated feel. Pungent floral and citrus hop flavors are the showcase with a touch of malt sweetness at the finish. Finishes crisply with a hoppy bitter aftertaste. Crisp, fresh and very drinkable."

"D - I had mixed feelings on this one as it was a little more than than the sum of parts given this one's immense quaffability and relatively low 5.2% ABV.

"The mouthfeel was medium to thin with modest carbonation."

"O- This is definitely one of new favorite APAs, right up there with Edward and Row 2/Hill 56. Everything is very well balanced with a very nice hop presence that balances nicely with the pale malts. If a tiny bit of the lemon zest and carbonation was dulled down a little bit I would say this would probably be my new favorite APA. I definitely recommend trying it out."
""
""
"Single finger head on a hazy copper with golden hues body. Aroma is weak with light malts more on the pale and grainy side with some citrus and earthy notes. The flavor very bland with weak malt and hop content. Earthy and metallic notes dominate. Too carbonated and medium body. The beer just wasn't good in any way."

""
"Overall Impression: When I opened this beer, I was immediately struck by the foamy head and the big hop aroma. The flavors followed the nose, as it had plenty of citrusy, grapefruit-like hop flavors. I'd consider this a very hoppy pale ale, and not considered an IPA only because of its lower ABV. Even though it was quite hoppy, it was drinkable and refreshing out on the golf course. Overall, I thought it was a very good beer, but I'd need to be in the mood for something fairly hoppy (which I often am!)."
""

"O- Closer to an IPA in almost every way. Very hop forward and extremely tasty."

"I could drink a few of these without getting board, wonderful session beer from a can that I wish I could get in my part of the world"
"A personal favorite of mine, either from the can or on-tap. Cloudy pale appearance, with a relatively mild but inviting smell. The taste combines multiple strong hops with its signature floral bite. Despite the relatively the strong bitterness, the mouthfeel is extremely smooth and mild, leaving the drinker with a smooth, balanced, palette-cleansing experience."

"Wow they call this a pale ale but in all honesty this should be an IPA except that it is a little light on the body and mouth feel. The taste however is amazing for a top notch APA or IPA, beyond expectations. Grapefruite citrus, pine very slight lemon just superb. Another BIG plus is that you have this so well balanced true hop champion done right without too much ABV...amazing. One of the tops!"

"Drank from can, as instructed, so cannot comment on appearance or head. Scent is awesome though, notes of citrus, pine, and some nice funk. Taste is beautifully balanced, a strong hopped up pale ale, notes of citrus, grass, lemon, and a decent malt profile to back it up. Mouthfeel is just what I'd expect, if not a little on the light side, but its very well balanced. Really glad I picked this one up and is very refreshing on a hot day."
"Beer pours a clear light-orange with a medium white head. The smell is really quite nice - the citrus hop burst is fantastic and there's some bready malt in there as well. The flavor on this is also quite impressive - much better than I remember it being on tap. It reminds me somewhat of a baby Heady Topper with a similar hop and malt profile, but not nearly as big of a flavor. It's very similar to the smell with a big citrus hop hitting you first followed by a nice bready malt character and then a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, I really enjoy this beer a lot. I feel like a lot of people talk about Daisy Cutter being overrated, but perhaps that's gone so far to the point where it's now underrated. I would certainly have another."

"Overall this is an oustanding pale ale, and reminds me a lot of a subdued Heady Topper. At 5.2%, none of the alcohol even enters your mind, really well balanced. Cheers Half Acre, you hit this one out of the ball park!"
""
"O: Incredibly balanced, easy drinking and full of juicy hops. Tons of tropical and citrus fruitiness going on. This is easily one of, in not, THE BEST American Pale Ale I've ever had the pleasure of trying."
""
"Overall it is an easy drinking tasty pale ale. Good beer in a can is a great thing."

"If only I lived closer to Chicago, this would be my everyday beer."

"My go to beer and in my opinion the best American pale on the market right now. Great floral citrusy nose with just the right amount of hops. At the same time this beer is balanced is not too alcoholic to drink more than one, at the end of the day this is a great beer that has great finish and mouth feel."

"16oz. can courtesy of Callmecoon. Served in a tulip nonic. Pours a pale, golden orange with a semi-hazy clarity and a fluffy 1.5 inch bright white head. Head eventually settles into a 1/8th skim with delicate, textured clusters of lacing present during the tasting. Nose expresses citrus rind and pleasant floral notes. Taste consistent with nose - citrus pops a bit more than the floral character - there's also a bit of a biscuity quality that cuts through the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body with an even carbonation and a bit of acidity that just tickles the palate. Overall, a very drinkable and quite enjoyable APA. I'd make this a summer staple if it were accessible."
"O: Outstanding APA. Such an easy drinking and flavorful beer to enjoy after a day of working outside."

"Poured from bomber into dimple glass mug. Pours a hazy orange color with a smaller white head. The aroma is all about the hops: resiny, tropical fruit, pineapple and mango with earthy notes sneaking through here and there. The flavor has more of the same; tropical fruits, grapefruit, resiny and mango create a strong lasting bitterness. Enough of a malt backbone to provide a good base. Decent lasting medium mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
"The Pour is pretty average.. Cloudy golden/ orange color.. Nice fluffy head but dissipates quickly. Smell is a bit on the lighter side but citrus most of all. Taste has some balance to it but hangs on the end of BIG grassy hop notes. Some citrus Mostly grapefruit and orange peel. The malt is there in balance to the citrus notes.. Bread and caramel.. slightly bitter with a VERY thin mouth feel. Cool sessionable beer but the hype behind this is somewhat confusing to me, to each their own. Next one straight from the can."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Again, the best pale ale I have had, and I have had quite a few. Even more awesome that it is brewed in Chicago. Truly deserving of a ""5" in that this beer cannot be improved upon. Great job Half Acre."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from can into DFH snifter. somewhat cloudy pour, visible small bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Yellow/Orange color. Decent head retention, appears to be a creaming 1/2 finger on the top. Smell- orange peel, caramel. Not much else. Taste- whoa. nice citrus hops- pretty aggressive for an APA. Tight carbonation makes for a dry finish. I get lemon peel, grapefruit, orange rind (bigtime). Finish is super dry. If anything, it lacks a sweet malt balance, this is a pretty hop forward APA. Highly enjoyable for a hophead like me though. Will def have again."
"Half Ace Daisy Cutter pours a fairly hazy orange, with just a dusting of tangerine along the edges when the beer is backlit. There are about three fingers of white foam sitting atop the beer, and after the first third fades away it just floats there; head retention is outstanding. Lacing is solid at the beer's apex, but very spotty underneath. The nose has lots of ripe grapefruit, with a little bit of mango present. It's not too potent/aromatic though. The flavor has a little bit of bready malts up front, along with a nice, mild, pale ale appropriate bitterness. The hoppy finish just screams Centennial hops, which aren't one of my favorites. It's a bitter grapefruit flavor, not entirely pleasant, and there's a little bit of grassiness as well. The body is nice and light, with just a little bit of firmness to it. The carbonation is a little bubbly, though if I was being picky I would say it could stand to be a little more so. Daisy Cutter's a solid pale ale but given that it's not distributed anywhere near me, I wouldn't go out of my way to get some more."

"O: This is a darling of an American Pale Ale. An absolute delight to drink. Lots of flavor, and it all melds together perfectly without weighing the beer down. Nice packaging too, I really dig the tallboy cans. If they could make it a six pack of tallboys and keep it fairly priced, a la the Narragansett seasonals, they'd make a killing. Half Acre, if you guys are ever looking to expand distribution, do not hesitate to come to MA. If I were the only one buying this beer, I'd still keep you in business."

"I really enjoyed this guy. Love the layering of flavors from the hops. This is welcome in my glass anytime."

"Another beer courtesy of cpolking and his recent package, thanks man. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is big on hops, lots of citrus. Taste is hoppy up front, tart, a good bit of citrus, a malt balance is present, bitter at the finish. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall a quality brew worth seeking out."

"Enjoyed at the Hyatt Regency O’Hare Red Bar this pale ale shows a clear golden amber color with a healthy white foam and good lacing to boot. The aroma brings pronounced grass-citrus hops and nutty-earthy malt. Very nice and pleasantly hoppy for a pale. The flavor is a clean grass hop with a lemony edge over mild bready caramel malt. Light but not watery at all, with a very sessionable but crisp and refreshing feel. Very nice and probably something that will please anyone that is tolerable of hops!"
"Overall, an excellent pale ale. Would love to try it fresh. Good balance between hop flavor and bittering."

"Overall a very good pale ale. Brewery is very good as well."

"Great tasting, excellent smelling pale."

"This is a really nice Pale Ale, the addition of the sweet fruit like pineapple is well balanced with the citrus fruits.I would look for this again."

""
"O - With Half Acre, mostly Daisy Cutter, being new to PA, I'm wondering if the keg had been sitting a little bit...I understand this is an APA, but other reviews and people suggest there is more citrus flavors when this one is fresh"
""
"Overall better yes, but it's also a classic hoppy pale ale for the hop heads. Not so much driven to this one but things could be far worse."
""
""
"Drinkability: Cheers to Half Acre for getting so much out of 5.2%. A ton of hop character in this one, and it definitely seems to be what they do best. This would have paired wonderfully with some sharp cheddar, and can imagine it being a really great ""thirst quencher"" IPA."
"Overall, I waited to write this review as I was finishing up this beer. I was excited through most of it, but maybe as it warmed, the taste of a Pale Ale was really starting to show. I guess I'm more of a hop head than this beer has to offer, but it was still a very well made beer. Ranks up high for me, for a Pale."
""
""
"Cost: $9.99 for a four pack."
""
"O: I doubt a distributor would enter a market with a perishable product with questionable freshness, but I can't even imagine this beer was at it's peak. This beer was just tapped minutes before my serving...AND the keg basically came off of the truck. Sooo...I guess I'll have to revisit this down the road."
"D: good sessionable beer. Glad I got to try it. It's nice. 4/4/4/3.5/4-3.93"
"O - a good example of the style."
""
"First Half Acre brew I've had. I will seek out more."
"I guess it's only 5.2% ABV, but otherwise I'm surprised this isn't considered an IPA. Even then, I prefer my pale ales with a bit more malt flavor."
"Very nice to see a ""session beer"" with this kind of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very grassy/floral rather than citrusy/piney. Reading the other reviews, I see a lot of mentions of strong citrus notes in the nose and taste, but I don't really get that (and I've had DC many times, on-tap and in the can). Still decent."
""
""
"Overall this is a great APA. I believe I said that Three Floyds Zombie Dust was one of the best APAs I had ever tried in my review of it. Daisy Cutter might just be better than that. Then again, they both shine in their different ways. If you enjoy pale ales, this is definitely one that you should try!"
"O: Very fresh with a unique hop profile. A beer for hop-heads. Crack a can and chill."
""
"O Well done pale ale. Taste is great and easy enough to drink all day. Kudos to Half Acre, quality brew."
"o: One of the best beers I've tried recently, great stuff."
""
"Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow, with a finger or so of white head; moderate retention and lacing. Aroma was pretty light, scents of pale malts, grass, and floral hops. Biscuity taste, grainy, balanced well with floral and citrus hops...pretty basic, and pretty typical of the style. Light-medium mouthfeel, pretty smooth, and quite drinkable overall."
""
"Drinkable is an understatement. Daisy Cutter is excellently balanced and ridiculously easy to drink. It has tons of aroma, but a mellow flavor. Every APA should be like this. This is top tier for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I can see why this is well liked, but its not quite my ideal hop profile. Though, I'm glad that my buddy brought 2 for me when he came back to visit."
"Overall this is one of the best pale ales I've had, ever, to be quite honest. This is almost to the point of an IPA in terms of the hop character, but it was great no matter what you call it. I am always impressed when a brewery can pack this much flavor into a sessionable beer and always bonus points for being in a 16 oz can."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great example of a pale ale. Everything is balanced nicely and is quite refreshing actually."
"O: This was surprisingly not as good as I wanted it to be. Loved it out of the can. Probably wouldn't pay for this again."
""
"O- A great beer, walks the line between pale ale and IPA very well, I'm definitely a big fan."
""
""
""
"O - It's a good pale. It's not my usual style, but I've heard good things about this beer so when I saw it on tap I figured I'd try it. Wouldn't order it again, but if you like pales, or just aren't a hop head, go for it. That said, get Zombie Dust if you can, because it's in a different league of APAs."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of my favorite IPA I have had the pleasure to try, it truly is my go to IPA, and lucky enough enough to be local that it ca be. Would def recommend it!!"
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid APA, probably one of my favorites to date. Daisy Cutter can stand up to a lot IPA's out there, and it's something I'd like to have on tap next time I'm in the windy city."
"Pours an attractive amber color with good cap of white froth, decent lacing. Scent contains strong floral notes along with solid grapefruit, splashes of pine and tropical fruits and a faint hints of sweet malt... i've had dIPAs that have a weaker nose. Taste continues with the strong hop presence, grapefruity and floral hops the star, splashes of other citrus, light tropical fruits and a malt base that is firm enough to let itself be known without being too powerful. Medium bodied, lightly dry finish. Fantastic pale ale that is a class leader and more potent in scent and taste than many IPAs."

"Overall- Alright, but there are a couple dozen IPAs I'd rather have on tap. The hint of citric apple was quite interesting, but in the end it wasn't enough to wow me. Perhaps the keg wasn't the freshest- I'd like to give this one another go in the future."

"Very easy going and very drinkable. We have a winner!"
""
"This is an American Pale Ale?!? It looks unbelievable for the style. Pours a hazy gold color with a nice one finger off white head. Massive lacing on my snifter glass. Wow. The nose is hops, citrus, grapefruit, orange and a little pine. Really pleasant. The taste is like an IPA- the only way I can tell it's not is the pale malt flavor. Great bitterness, flavor, etc... I just can't get over the fact that this is an APA. Feel is medium, with excellent carbonation, bitterness, and a nice dry finish. The malt sees action in the feel too, but in the background. Overall, I could sit and drink several of these and not get tired of it- Fantastic example of the style, maybe the best I've had. Highly recommended. Cheers."
"Pours cloudy straw color with a half finger of snow white head. Pretty good retention and nice swaths of lacing around the glass. Smell is lots of tropical fruit (mango), orange, and biscuity malt. Lots of hops in the aroma, though they don't pack as much punch in the taste (unfortunately). Taste is more biscuity, pale malt, and some clean, non-bitter orange flavor, with very little bitterness on the finish. Medium-light carbonation and body, pretty smooth. Overall, really drinkable and tasty; only complaint is that I'd like to see a little more hop flavor."
""
""
"I will drink this again, when the weather dictates!"
""
""
""
""
"O- an amazing amount of flavor packed into a fairly low abv. probably the best APA out there. fantastic balance and a hop-lovers dream. also kudos for the can, definitely kept the hop profile as fresh as possible. if possible, acquire as much of this as you can."

"Overall, a full flavored pale ale at 5.2%? Yes, please. Great beer here. Looking forward to drinking this again during the warmer months."
""
""
"O-a refreshing pale ale for drinking on a nice summer day"
"I for one hope Daisy Cutter is available in cases when the summertime approaches(sorry Chicago burbs, Philly should come first) so I can buy a whole lot of it. This is a All Day type of beer that I could drink in mounds."
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good pale ale that packs in a lot of hop flavors for 5.2%. I would like a little more complexity, but it's still quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A real nice pale ale, in fact I could drink this all the time if it were around more. This is a great pale ale that belongs with the best of them. Nice beer and welcome to PA."
""
""
""
"The only real issue that I have with this beer is that the bitterness is far too assertive for the delicate hop flavors that come through in the aroma. They are drowned out. Overall, this is a very good take on a pale ale, but it could stand to improve a bit, yet."
""
"Overall this is an exceptional APA. At 5.2 abv it still packs a big flavor wallop."
""
""
""
"Tastes like it smells, upfront, but things gets a little watery and thin near the back end. The malt is nice and sweet, biscuity and grassy, and the hop profile is a nice midwestern blend of citrus and fruit. But, like I said, the back end is a little thin."

"Outstanding flavour, and in a can. Great bitterness, very lacey. Floral, yes it smells like a flower store in the background. ultimate beer after a large amount of taking care of the garden.Thanks Tom. Smooth, I would drink this regularly and convert others to the charms of craft beer."
"O: Because it's an APA, I'm giving the Daisy Cutter the bump up here. There are better examples (Zombie Dust, DC Brau Public, Troegs Perpetual), but that doesn't mean that Daisy Cutter isn't a fine entry. An enjoyable APA with a surprising amount of flavor for such a low ABV beer."
""
""
"A very flavorful beer; especially when considering that it is only 5.2%. Strongly dry hopped. A fantastic session beer that would go great with seafood. Very nice."
""
"O) I found this pretty refreshing. It wouldn't be my first choice on a cold winter day in Wisconsin. Having said that, the fairly low ABV and refreshing qualities would make it a pretty easy drinker while hitting the links in the summer. This was pretty good..."
""
""
"Overall: This is and has been one of my favorites. I always get some when I'm near Chicago."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this again today to make sure something wasn't wrong with my palate, it's just not a great beer. Flavor profile is flat and singular, without much attempt at balance or a journey of flavors along the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hint darker than straw yellow with a 1.5 finger head, that laces well. A really enjoyable nose, with light fruity and citrus hop aromas with malty biscuit and sweet bread notes underneath it all. The body of the beer has an enjoyable light fruity happiness with only a hint of bitterness that builds over time. Earthy notes play through later. The mouthfeel is surprisingly thin and watery at first, the only downfall of this beer really. Overall, a nice drinkable beer I am glad I got two of, worth seeking out as an easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
"As always, a great pale ale. Brings a good amount of flavor for a pale ale with a really good feel too."

"Overall, mighty fine pale ale from good ole Chi-Town."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: an exceptional, easy drinking APA. Daisy Cutter is a great ""go to"" beer that I ought to always have in my beer fridge.. it satiates one's hop fix quite well. I'm also glad that Half Acre decided to use 16 oz. cans; seems appropriate for this beer."
"Medium bodied with resinous hop oils and a blast of bitter, earthy pine needle flavor up front that is countered by the sweet citrus and pale malt notes. Slightly spicy with some earthy grass followed by hints of pineapple, orange and grapefruit before being rounded out by the biscuity malt character. Well balanced and easy to drink with a crisp, dry finish."
"O- For a pale ale, this packs a punch. I know from experience this is a sessionable ale, but can also leave your tongue a dry mess. If you're in Chicago, you can't pass up a Daisy Cutter."

""

"Trying the Half Acre Daisy Cutter Pale Ale. I have read reviews and comments that declare this beer to be as good...if not better than Zombie Dust by 3Floyds....I say not even close...However, this is a tasty beer. The beer pours yellowish copper with thin white head that is lacing slightly. The smell includes grapfruit and clove with waffes of pine. The taste is bitter...slight floral notes to start followed by a grapfruity bitterness. The mouthfeel was good...lighter in body....minumal carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer....but no where near the Z Dust. Worth a try!"

"Have been enjoying this beer since I have been in Chicago. Great go to IPA (APA whatever they are calling it). Pours a light orange with a minimal white head which leaves a bit of lacing. I usually get more lacing out of this beer. Aroma is big piney citrusy grapefruit. Very clean crisp and light. Flavors are spot on. Grapefruit up front, good, clean, piney, bitterness, but not overly bitter. There is a bit of balance from the malt, but really this one is a great hoppy beer. Mouthfeel is good, but a bit light on carbonation. Overall this is a damn good enjoyable available beer. I'll definitely miss it when I no longer live in Chicago."

"Overall - It's damn near an IPA, but just light enough to still hold its own as an APA. Maybe a shift from bittering to aromatics would do this well, but it's a hell of a beer anyway."
"16oz can thanks to SpdKilz, appreciate it. Pours a mostly clear yellow, spotty swiss cheese head. Smells a little bit hoppy but not much else. Taste is hops but feels like it might be a little over the hill. Not bad at all just feels a bit faded. the low abv and light body make it extremely easy to drink. I'd like to revisit this again with a known fresh sample to see how it fares."
"Overall: Just a ton of flavor here for a 5.2% APA; not just a hoppy APA, this beer has some unique elements that make it well worth seeking out"
"16 oz. can poured into a pint glass. pours a slightly hazy straw yellow with a short lived head, not much going on in the way of a ring or lacing. aroma is mild tropical fruit with some grain. flavor is mild, mild, mild with subtle grains, some fruitiness and very little bitterness. low carbonation and thin to medium mouthfeel. this is a good summer-time, lawn mower, golf day type of beer when you’d like to throw back a few without getting too buzzed."
"Overall this is a tasty take on the American Pale Ale style that's loaded with hop character, massively drinkable, and it looks great in the glass, too."
"Despite all this, tastes alot bigger than the ABV suggest. One of my favorites. thanks to the Half Acre Cycling team for sharing this beer. This beer vanishes in my presence very quickly."
"Bought a 4 Pack of Pint Cans, good stuff! considering my past experience of canned beer, (cheap) this beer really stands out! Love the name and the taste! I'll be buying more of this brand, (even if it's $9 a 4 pack) Beautiful lacing, full mouthful, smooth for PA."
"A very nice Pale Ale here... Maybe not Alpha King or Fresh Hop Pale Ale awesome but very good nonetheless...."
"D/O: This beer lives up to its reputation, showing heaps of floral qualities. It proves to be palate-friendly, although the understated malt bill doesn't promise to stand up to much in the way of food. In the final tally this beer might be more rightfully categorized as an American-hopped blond ale, than an American pale ale."
"O – A nice easy drinking pale ale. I’m liking that its 5.2 % and sold in 16 oz cans. If I had access to this beer it would probably be my go to session beer. The smell was really great, but the taste and mouth feel fell a bit short of my expectations. Still some very good stuff."
"A pretty solid APA, looking forward to seeing this beer spread farther out of Chicago."
"It's beers like this that make the Pale Ale style grow on me. In the past, I was never happy with the ones I've tried since they never seemed to strike any balance with the hops and malt. Daisy Cutter break the mold, delivers wonderful hop flavors reminding you it's not an IPA but enough to give it that kick."
"Overall : this is a high quality pale ale that is very enjoyable to drink. I like to have a nice 3 or 4 beer session with this beer."
"D - Very comparable to FFF Alpha King. I don't love it, but it's respectable and I enjoy that it's a true local brew."
"O- In your face hops and a decent base make this an easy drinking beer. I had this on tap the other week and I think it was even better then."
"Pours a hazy light orange with a 1 inch puffy orange-white head that settles to a thin film. Random streaks and dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of tropical fruits, grapefruit juice, and citrus zest hops. Taste is of malt, grapefruit/tropical fruits, and some citrus zest flavors on the finish. A mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it smells better than it tastes."
"This beer is on the border between APA and IPA. It is very hoppy in flavour and aroma, but not very bitter."
"O: This beer skirts that APA/IPA boundary as many APA contemporary examples do these days, and it skirts the boundary well."
"Overall Impression- Very awesome APA! The malts compliment the hops perfectly and has a great amount of body to the brew. I will be looking for more from Half Acre when I'm up north this coming month. You will have to try this one for yourself!"
"Pours a bright golden color with a white 1 finger head. Smell is huge with this. Lots of fruits with hints of caramel, hops and floral notes. Really good smelling beer. Fruits and hops also make up the taste. Some floral notes as well. Taste is amazing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is the best pale ale i've had. Taste is so delicious. If only I could get this all the time."
"O: What I would expect from this great brewery. Very enjoyable and refreshing beer. Definitely a treat any time of year, but makes me picture a fresh summer afternoon!"
"If you live close enough for Daisy Cutter to be your go-to session hop fix, you are a lucky individual."
"Overall: One of the drier APAs I've had, but still very well done. Gotta appreciate an well-done brew in a can. I do personally prefer a bit more maltiness, even in an APA, but still recommend this one."
"Overall an outstanding pale ale that hop heads can rejoice over!"
"O: Overall this beer is OK but just really didn't bring the hops like I think it should. All in all an easy drinking APA. Glad I got to try this one 3.5"
"Overall, a very nice Pale Ale. It's very drinkable, and quite flavorful, it just needs more body to be excellent."
"D - I really like this beer; the smooth malt notes blend well with the floral hops used in this beer; I would highly recommend"
"Overall perhaps my favorite APA so far. I live in Chicago south suburbs and wish it was more readily available."
"Overall: Pretty nice beer from half acres. Incredibly drinkable. Highly recommended"
"I recommend this highly it is one of the best pales available for sure."
"Overall: Great summer beer! Glad I can get this whenever I want. Smooth and easy to drink"
"Definitely my favorite APA, the only major drawbacks are the color and clarity but the head and lacing more than make up for it."
"A great pale ale. This is as hoppy as some midwest IPAs and DIPAs. A remarkable pale! I can't wait to get home and crack my last can of this!"
"O: To be honest, the flavor profile/malt profile reminds me a lot of a hopped up lager, albeit not that clean. I was a little disappointed that the hop flavor didn't completely transfer over from the nose to the taste in both depth and intensity (except for bitterness). Still pretty good, but almost seems way too bitter and hoppy to be considered an APA and not an IPA."
"O/D-Received this from a cool dude along with a Gumballhead. I loved them both. How can I choose a favorite between the two? This beer is great. I would love to have this one available to me. Just a great beer, and I love it in the 16 oz. cans."
"O: This is a super drinkable beer that I'd like to try again. I find myself sipping it a bit faster than I probably should. The smells and flavors in this beer are really nice. And like I said before... there is something oddly familiar with this beer (almost nostalgic), but I can't seem to place it. Nice work Half Acre."
"O: I am glad I got the chance to try Daisy Cutter this time to Chicago – the top-shelf aroma and smooth balanced caramel maltiness and West Coast hoppiness with a healthy bit of herbal flavor make it a superb example of the style. If they moved the carbonation down a notch or two to make it a bit more drinkable, this would a top 10 or 20 beer for me."
"O - delightful beer. You just have to know you're not getting yourself into a hoppy, bitter beer."
"need to try the double now :D"
"Overall, Daisy Cutter isn't quite as nuanced as Alpha King, but it's still a masterful APA that delivers all of the hop goodness and sessionability that one can expect from the style. A benchmark pale ale."
"O: This had a great taste. More malty than your regular pale ale, but I really enjoyed it and on draft was a real treat."
"Pours a pale orange with a large three finger head into my ccb pint glass. Aroma of crazy bold hops both pine and citrus. taste follows the nose with the addition of malts to the palate. Great allaround pale ale the boarders on ipa. If I lived in Chicago I would drink this all the time. Great brew!"
"Received this as an extra in a trade from an awesome BA in Illinois. I've already had the Galactic Double Daisy Cutter, so I was curious to see how this one would fare. Daisy Cutter pours a translucent straw hue with a very thin crown. While there's little head to speak of, the beer does leave behind some thin lacing as it recedes. The nose is really muted. There really isn't anything of note that reaches out and punches you in the face, unlike the Galactic variety. The taste, however, is marvelous. This is a really smooth, mellow, mildly hopped beer that you could session the daylights out of. This would definitely be one of my go to beers if I lived anywhere near Half Acre. Overall, this is a marvelous beer. Great tasting, doesn't scorch the taste buds, smooth, and next no zero bitterness on the back end of a sip. Would recommend this to anyone that hasn't had the opportunity to enjoy a Half Acre beer."
"This beer is curious, but not super impressive. I'm wondering what everyone else finds so amazing about it, as it's not doing it for me. It's like half an IPA, but that IPA part is only okay, and the other half is pretty bland. Some grapefruit hops, not a whole lot else."
"Overall: This is everything an APA should be. Hops and malts in good measure with a ton of character. Drinkability is incredible. Bonus points for rocking the tallboy."
"Overall - At times the taste of this beer reminded me of some of the Sixpoint beers I've had recently.. which are also in 16oz can format. It's got a nice balance and although it packs a lot of flavour, it still remains highly drinkable. Definitely worth seeking out."
"O: This has been my everyday beer for two weeks since back home in Chicago. I am going to miss this greatly back in NYC where I cannot find a sessionable brew that meets my hops/intensity minimums. I never find myself thinking, ""this is alright, but man I need a real 6.5+ % APV IPA"" This beer is PROOF that a low alcohol beer CAN satisfy a strong IPA loving hophead! Bravo, Half Acre! You have created a Pale Ale masterpiece!!!"
"Golden color, very cheery, slight haze. Fluffy white foam sits atop, very rocky head, lingers. Aromas are of light hop, very simple, pleasant. Flavor is very clean and crisp. Decent body with lots of carbonation, hops lend a citrusy finish with a dry light bitterness. Solid brew, i can see why everyone likes this one so much."
"Overall: My first Half Acre beer and it did not dissapoint! All i have to say is: great hops forward session beer."
"Clean, crisp and refreshing. Perfect, clean and refreshing pale. Awesome beer, and a great example of what the style can be."
"O: No complains, a very solid pale ale. With a low ABV like this, I could definitely do some damage to a few of these."
"O- A solid hop-forward APA (my kind of APA) that is very refreshing and easy to drink. Decent amount of citrus flavor but only hints of bitterness. Great choice to drink outside in the heat of summer. While not as elite as Alpha King, I will definitely keep some of these on hand during the summer. Hope nothing but the best for Half Acre in the future!"
"Overall: I love this beer and if I had access to it, it would be a regular in my fridge! Perfect summer beer and a great beer overall. Always looking to get my hands on this one!"
"Overall this is one of the better hop forward pale ales out there. Might even classify this as an ipa. Along similar lines with Alpha King. Would love it if it was a little more medium bodied, but still a solid brew."
"Overall a great pale ale. One of the best. Try it if you can."
"Overall, it's a good beer. Not worth the hype. If I had regular access to it, I don't honestly know if it would be something I would buy. A good beer to be sure but nothing to get excited about."
"O - This is the best pale ale I have ever had out of a can. Extremely refreshing. The hop intensity is perfect. Fantastically balanced. You should definitely try this beer. I first had this beer while visiting Chicago last year and I have been searching for it ever since."
"O - Pretty good. I liked how balanced this one was. It was just a touch too thin in the feel but still a great hoppy pale ale. I would love to try this one on-tap some day."
"O - Very good beer. ITs not as good as i expected."
"O- This is my definition of a perfect American Pale Ale. Refreshing as hell, but still enough hop character and malt backbone to hold my interest. I think this knocks off Alpha King for me, which I had as an IPA in my book anyway."
"O: This one certainly lives up to its reputation and I hope to grab LOTS more of this stuff when I go back to Chicago to visit family."
"O - An excellent APA (IPA?), definitely one of the best I've had!"
"O- Amazing. So crisp and wonderful for a hot summer day. Light bodied and easy to drink. Great balance and level of bitterness for an APA."
"Certainly one of the best pale ales on the planet. One of the most easy drinking beers I have ever had. At only 5.2%, it would be a cinch to go through several of these. I would drink this regularly and year round if I could. Absolutely terrific!"
"An expertly crafted pale ale, Daisy Cutter maintains a great balance between just enough hop bitterness and some pleasant fruit notes. Feel makes it really refreshing and inifinitely drinkable. A great example of the style."
"O: I was pleasantly surprised with this one. It had a good deal of flavor with a refreshing dry clean finish, perfect for a hot day."
"Awesome Pale Ale, really drinkable...wish this was distributed in my area"
"O - Overal, I really enjoy this pale ale, I've had it a few times before. There's only one SNPA though!"
"Another favorite new-to-me brewery. Thanks Baron!"
"This beer is all smoke, no fire. Looks and smells great, tastes like a watery, beginner's homebrew. This would be a good beer to pound on hot days, but not at the price they sell it for. Half Acre does make some other pretty good beers, but skip this one if you like you beer with a hint of substance."
"A good pale ale. Hoppy in a distinct grassy/floral way but still balanced."
"O: Very tasty pale ale and one I would buy on a regular basis. Thanks to my buddy Michael for hooking me up with this one!"
"Fantastic American Pale Ale. One of the best I’ve had so far!"
"Overall a decent experience and the generosity of its origin is appreciated but I wouldn't run to this again because of the mysterious olive taste."
"If this were available in Texas it would be a go to pale ale to help fight the heat. My 1st try at a Half Acre beer, but hopefully not my last."
"I was really happy to get to try this! Unexpectedly aromatic and strong flavored for a pale ale. Definitely a sort of burnt-grain and flower petal (daisys actually came to mind, perhaps the power of suggestion) smell in the nose that came off as something earthy and savory with a tad of floral like sweetness. The flavor was much the same, but a lot of concentration on a strong wheatiness with the nose playing a supporting role. Overall this was very potent and very interesting for a pale ale, and made me excited for the prospect of double. Also, big props for making such a good out-of-a-can beer!"
"I lovw this beer. I cant say ive had an american pale ale that is as well balanced as this. Its my recent beer crush. I am fortunate to be living in chicago now and have ready access to it. This weekend i will be sure to introduce on on my friends from cincinnati to it when he visits!"
"O: This is the kind of beer I could drink all afternoon. Light and zesty with a complex range of flavors yet simple to drink and easy to enjoy. I will probably start recommending this especially to friends of mine who aren’t exactly craft beer drinkers."
"This might be the best example proving that great beer can come in a can. I could drink this all the time."
"Overall this is a tasty beer that I am glad I was able to try. I wont be driving to Chicago for it but if I find it in passing, I will definitely be picking up another pack of these."
"Had one of these over the weekend at my friend's house who just got back from IL. Light gold color, not much head, some lacing. The smell is fresh hops, citrus, gentle malt, really alive and aggressive! The taste is light, crisp, and packed with juicy hops! Really good carbonation and mouthfeel. Loved this one!!!"
"D-Overall this is a fabulous APA. I dont drink APA's alot but in the summer i could see me grabing and drinking a few of these after mowin the lawn or take a few of these on a camping trip. Def. Try this APA if u get the chance"
"There's little wonder as to why Half Acre has made this their flagship beer. They haven't reinvented the wheel. Nay, they've just made the ride that much smoother."
"The mouthfeel is satisfyingly medium-bodied. The extra-sweet malt in this beer doesn’t translate to a thick mouthfeel; Half Acre has wisely brewed this beer in such a way that it focuses on balance and refreshment. Overall, this is an above average pale ale. For some palates, this might score a 4.0 or 4.5 very easily. The malt profile here is not my favorite, but I can’t deny that the beer just works."
"Overall- I love me some nice craft cans and this does not disappoint. I wish this was distributed in my county as I would probably have it in regular rotation. Good stuff Half Acre!"
"O: Great brew. I never thought I'd crave more of a pale ale, but damn, drinking this in the sun makes me wish I had easy access. I would make this a daily summer drinker were it possible. Overall score is reflective of it's insanely refreshing and satisfying nature. Really tasty and gretare than the sum of its parts."
"O- Have had this many times and is a great local APA. It's a good introduction for someone who is not a huge hophead since it has some bitter hop presence, but is well balanced."
"Thanks to schmittymack for sharing this one the other night at his place. Poured a hazy dark gold with a light tan head. Aromas of biscuit, hops and pine. On the palate, this one was light bodied and drinkable, with flavors of biscuit, hops and pine."
"Drinkable to a fault and refreshing on a warm Boston night - while not a game changer, Daisy Cutter is a choice summer beer. As the temperature rises this week, I have a feeling I'll be working my way through these cans pretty quickly."
"Needless to say, I loved this one. Note to other brewers out there, make more super hoppy APA's. I'll drink all of them. YUM."
"Very unique, drinkable and moreish."
"this poured a rich cloudy glowing orange, with a strong 2 finger head that is leaving lots of lacing. the smell is similar to alpha king with hints of a little zombie dust, pure delicious. the taste is a nice mellow citrus hop upfront and a nice lighter body than i was expecting but it flavorful the whole way through. a good mellow consistent tingle from start to finish on the sip. overall its a pretty damn good beer and i could drink tons more if i had it. now to find double daisy cutter"
"O- This is an excellent take on the style! A bit more hops and less maltiness than most. Really fresh and delicious! This one goes down so easy, that you could drink all day! This is a Pale Ale that wants to be an IPA!"
"O – This beer gives the impression that the brewers got exactly what it wanted to get out of it. A very well planned aromatic and balanced pale ale. Very aromatic, bold and yet refreshing."
"O - I really enjoy this pale ale. The hops along with the lingering taste create a drinkable pale ale full of flavor. As far as a session pale ale goes, this is a great choice. Nice hop character with soothing malt backbone, not much more I could ask for."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. This would be on the grocery list each week if I lived in Chicago."
"Overall, I would say this is probably the best pale ale I have ever had. Awesome juicy flavors, moderate level of alcohol and dangerously drinkable. I would drink this by the growler if possible."
"Pours golden in my snifter with a nice big cap of white head. Aromatic, citrus and maybe a touch of grassy hops dominate the nose. A really good smelling APA and definitely a notch above most. The taste is really nice - subtle citrus and spicy, grassy hops come out in big fashion for an APA. Good, but drinkable, primarily citrus-flavored bitterness. Malt way in the back. Really nice. Good, light mouthfeel with strong carbonation. Overall, this is my second favorite APA as of this writing behind Hoppy Birthday from Alpine."
"Does not remind me of most pale ales I have had, but this is a beer that I would love to be able to buy freely. I could see a lot of this being consumed on the river, good beer in general."
"Overall, it's a good pale ale and a great one to have on a hot day"
"O: easy drinking, on-point for the style"
"Drink- Plain and simple, I want more. I am suprised this is not higher rated. It was super tasty and good."
"O - A good pale ale, but probably should be a classified as an IPA! Perfect summer beer, wish I had more..."
"O--This is the most hoppy pale ale I have ever had. That said, it doesn't live up to what I was hoping for. This is a good (not great) example of the style."
"No letdown here...this one is worthy of its current high rating on Ba."
"o: Nice light and crisp. This one is a good way to go when you're just looking for either a good way to start the night, or a peaceful way to end it. It is very mellow for sure, and that is what I like most about it. It could use a bit more fizz to make it more universal (could really fit any mood then), but as is...it is more of a special time kinda beer...a good way to wind down the ESPECIALLY stressful days."
"O- A fine beer that I morn the fact that I can not get it anywhere but Chicago. Drank it on tap during my last visit and brought several cans home to relive the joy. More of an IPA than APA, that danky hop taste drew me in and held me. Would gladly pay the price if it were to arrive locally (by that I mean Philadelphia)."
"D: The beer is surprisingly drinkable, and the hop assault is what I would expect from an IPA rather than a pale ale."
"O: While I don't think this beer lived up to the hype it was quite good. Well balanced and very mild - perfect lawnmower beer."
"If it were local I'd buy some from time to time, but won't go through the hassle of trading for it."
"O: This was a great surprise to me. I am normally not too big on IPAs and DIPAs but this beer just really opened my eyes to the style and its also the perfect lawn mowing beer."
"Bought a 4 pack this weekend when I went to Chicago. Pours a golden murky brownish orange, small fluffy head with decent lacing. Smelled very citrusy and hoppy out of the can, but lost a bit of the nose once it was in the glass. Citrusy with nicely balanced hops, slightly bitter finish and aftertaste. Nice mouthfeel, light and carbonated. After being told by numerous people that I ""had to pick this up"" while in Chicago, I just can't see what all the hype was about. It's a nice pale ale, but I don't think it was worth the price or the hype."
"Still, a refreshing beer that I would try on occasion if it were available."
"I feel like I just shot a blank and killed myself from the blast."
"O - This can was built for the summer and to date is the best APA I've had. Love it!"
"Hazy, strawberry blonde with a big soapy head of bone colored foam that lasts a while and leaves scraps of fine lace on the glass. Dank smelling hop notes hit me in the face as soon as I cracked the can open. Citrus, pine tar and grapefruit rind come to mind. Delicious and hoppy with a trim pale malt backbone to just balance. Medium bodied with scrubbing carbonation and a hop oily finish. Daisy Cutter delivers in a big way for a session beer, big, brash hop flavor with a sessionable abv. Great beer."
"O - At 5.2ABV this is a perfect session beer....you can throw a few back and not sacrifice on flavor. If I lived in the area, this would be a staple in my fridge"
"Pours a light, relatively clear honey straw color with a massive, rocky, foam off white head. Thick clumps of lacing cover the glass and persist as a cap throughout the beer. Aroma is heavy on pale and bready malts with strong lemon citrus hops in the finish. Bready and biscuit dominate the body before a subtle lemon zest and rind hop flavor blends into the finish. This is quickly subsumed by a dry malt and grain takes over and lingers throughout the remainder. Creamy bodied with soft carbonation. Bottle or can I've never understood the love for this beer. Pleasant and slightly above average but a lot of locals do this just as well and this isn't remotely close to Edward or Hoppy Birthday."
"O: This is a quality APA. Definitely recommended to others"
"Poured into my Duvel tulip. A hard pour results in four fingers of fluffy white foam. The head recedes leaving a white coaster atop the hazy amber colored beer. The aroma is of citrusy hops and biscuity malt. Smells great! The taste showcases the hop bill with notes of orange and grapefruit predominating. A pale malt backbone provides the perfect backdrop to the bitter hop forward character of this APA. The feel is light and crisp with a prickly level of carbonation which is perfect for the style. Overall this is a very tasty, overly hoppy pale ale that is a joy to drink. Super refreshing. This would be great on a hot summer day and would be in my regular rotation if it was available in SoCal. Recommended!"
"O: Man, a quick favorite. A soon to be summertime staple. What could make a man want to crack open a beer at 11:30am? This stuff."
"O- I really enjoyed this one. I can't wait for more."
"Taste does not follow the aroma. The taste is heavier on grass and there is a smoky flavor too. None of the juiciness from the scent. Disappointing. Still good, but good because it's interesting not because it's amazing."
"Overall, one of the best APAs I've had. Very easy drinking. Crisop and refreshing."
"O: i think this is the best american pale ale i have ever tasted. i could easily crush 6 or 7 if these in a session."
"Overall, I love this beer. Its boarder line b/w APA and IPA, but as I always say, this is a line that is meant to be blurred. If I could get this in Philly it would be my ""go to"" beer. I'm a big fan of this brewery and will keep an eye out for their brews in my area, and will always enjoy them when in Chicago! Cheers!"
"D: I like it, its a good tall boy to put back that wont smash you up too fierce like an IPA."
"I would love to have this with a burger, or in a hammock. Maybe both? It definitely has a summer feeling to it. Overall, it's a highly drinkable pale ale that I can definitely enjoy."
"Can in to pint glass,golden copper color w/one finger of head sticks to the glass nicely. Citrus strong aroma, followed with a citrus punch in the front leading into bready-biscuit followed by a nice level of bitterness for a pale ale, keeping it from the IPA level. Smooth not overly sharp carbonation alittle thiner then most Pales that I've had. Overall a very well balanced pale nice hop level w/o pushing it in the IPA category."
"Lighter side of medium body, with lively carbonation. Alcohol is hidden well. Earthy flavor takes away from the drinkability for me, but a good beer anyway."
"This is an incredible beer. I usually drink this in the pint cans, but also pick up a growler of it now and then. The initial pour is beautiful, from the amber/orange rich color and a full rich head to the opaque/cloudy appearance. A refreshing citrus, grapefruit flavor hits you first, a great hopness that is also balanced, with a clean/crisp finish. This is a great beer from a humble neighborhood brewery. Please all heed my review and find this beer."
"O- well balanced, and something you can certainly have more than one of. between this and gossamer, i cant see anytime when i COULDNT drink some half acre. love this stuff."
"O: Good, great hops, decent bitterness, nice hoppy finish, decent malt balance."
"And screw this glass. I'm finishing this out of the can."
"Well balanced, with ripe, crisp carbonation. Bready, biscuity malts lead into a biting middle of earthy hops and pine and then finishes with citrusy hops of grapefruit, lemon, berry, and sweet tarts. Dry and refreshing, not overly bitter but just right. Great food beer."
"This is a very solid APA and probably one of the best I've had out of a can. The only thing I can think of that compares would be Dale's."
"A very refreshing and easy drinking pale ale. I also especially like the 16oz can format. I really wish this made it out to Oregon!"
"I've had this on tap and from the can...both are very good. I would recommend this pale ale to all."
"Tap: Poured a hazy glowy orangey color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus and fresh grapefruit notes with loads of aromatic notes is just about perfect. Taste is also dominated by huge notes of citrus and grapefruit hops with a dry caramel malt base that doesn’t overshadow the hops profile. Body is quite full with great carbonation. One of the best IPA that I had the chance to taste recently."
"Overall i gotta say this thing is pretty damn good, and will definintely make a point to seek out again. Declicious!"
"Overall: Excellent beer, I am definately glad I got to try it and if I was fortunate enough to live in an area this is distributed in I would seek it out as a go to session beer. Well made."
"D/O- Thirst quenching. The visual/aroma stole the show for me on this one. After the initial hop blast this pale ale seemed kind of bland. Would be a good one in the summer."
"O:Loved it. Crisp and hoppy with a satisfying finish. ABV is low enough that a second one was an easy decision. Great work by the brew team at Half Acre."
"This is a pass for sure. I was excited to try this one even. I don't see what people see in this beer. Based on the smell you'd think it was a winner. I was foiled."
"A 16oz can poured into my Adnams imperial tumbler. Thanks to CaptinRedBeard for tossing this my way. Appears a cloudy golden amber color with a good inch of fluffy off white foam. The head has good staying power and leaves a thin lace on the glass with each sip. Nose and flavors consist of citrus fruits such as orange, grapefruit, and lemon, mildly resinous pine, crackers, a touch of floral perfume. The malt certainly plays second fiddle here. Prickly carbonation with a clean, bitter finish. A bit slick. Thanks again Corey."
"O: This is a supremely solid beer. One that I welcome at every opportunity."
"O: This would be in my regular rotation if available locally. Goes does easy and with a lower ABV, you can drink a few of these and still function. Daisy Cutter lived up to the hype that I had built up for it which I can't say for some beers. Thank you Doug!"
"Thank you Adam for shipping me this want. I poured the can into a Sam Adams glass it gave off a wonderful big white head that sat on top of a clear golden colored elixir. The hop presence hits you first in the nose. You get a ton of citrus and resin character coming right at you, not much in the way of malts at all. In the taste it reminded me of an IPA so I think if you are looking for a balanced brew this isn’t for you but if you are looking for a hop bomb I highly recommend it. It had a good amount of carbonation so was light and crisp in the mouth. To me this would be a great summer BBQ brew if it was local and available that is"
"Drinkability: Superb brew. I am now kicking myself for not hauling back more of it and other Half Acre brews. All that trunk space wasted."
"Taste is light and floral with earthy grassy hops on the finish. A very mild sweetness and a little bit of a yeast flavor. Like bread dough. Very refreshing but wouldn't mind it being a little more bitter. This one is all about hop flavor."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, mellow citrus hops. In the taste, pine like hops and a dry balanced malt. A hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine hop in the the aftertaste. Big hops for a pale and I really enjoyed the 16oz can."
"Drinkability: Very complex, bold flavor would complimented a meal of grilled meats well. I would consider this an excellent beer for a cookout, but only for the beginning of the evening, a bit to bold for a long session."
"This pours a hazy orange with a fluffy two finger head that sticks around for a bit and leaves some lace on the way down. On the nose there is a huge grapefruit note with bits of pine resin underneath it. I'm not getting much in the way of malt backbone except for a little bit of bread. In the mouth the grapefruit and resin are puckeringly and pleasantly bitter, with some dry bread coming in underneath. The body is medium and the finish is pretty long with the pine and citric bitterness sticking around for a while. This is highly drinkable, one of my new favorite beers to bring to parties, and it gets a little extra credit for coming in an awesome form factor, the pint can. So glad to have discovered this now that I won't be buying Honker's for a session brew anymore. Good work Half Acre."
"Overall, this is a nicely hopped pale ale that is tasty and refreshing. At 5.2% ABV, it is sessionable and one that packs a lot of flavor."
"This is a great drinker for a hot summer day."
"D-If I could get this in the area it would be one of my favorite go-to beers in the spring and summer. It is very refreshing, clean and easy to drink. An excellent example of how a classic and relatively basic style can be truly elegant in flavor and aroma."
"O - Very nice Pale Ale, reminiscent of Drifter and/or Moon Man (which happen to be two of my favorite APAs.) I would drink this as my go-to replacement for Gumballhead if I lived in Chicago."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: The body is very light, and it has pretty high carbonation. Not the smoothest drinking by any stretch, and I also think the lightness retracts from the taste a bit as well. It drops off the palate pretty quickly. This is the biggest detractor for this beer in my opinion. Overall though, this is a great beer, one of the best of the style I've had. It's definitely hop-forward, but it also has a malt presence as well. Something I'd love to have again."
"Overall (4.5): This quickly became one of my favorite Pale Ales after just trying it a few days ago. I definitely would put it in the same class as Alpha King, but maybe just behind it like Firestone Walker / Mission St. Pale."
"O. I had really high expectations for this beer. It didn't quite meet them but it was enjoyable nonetheless. This beer's drinkability is probably its best asset - making it a clear choice for session or warm weather drinking. I just wish it had a bit more punch in the taste department."
"O- Solid Pale Ale, Nice bittnerness that isn't over powering. Very surprised by this brew."
"O -- If someone is specifically looking for a bitter hop kick, this beer is for them. Personally, I like hops, but the resin character in this one would only get me through one glass -- and maybe not even that. Harsh is an easy word to apply here, but it doesn't quite hit that stage, though it might in a second pint."
"O- well, i guess i have an excuse to drive to chicago now. this is a fantastic beer thats kept in cans so i can take it to the beach! certainly underrated by the rest of the beer drinking world. lots of flavor packed into this 5.2% beer. check this one out if given the opportunity."
"More a sessionable IPA than an APA, this gem defies easy categorization but is so very worth seeking out. If the price point was a little lower, this would never leave my fridge."
"D - really solid pale ale. Reminds me a lot of Alpha King, which is a huge complement. Big American pale ale all the way. Big thanks to yeahnatenelson for sending this guy as an extra! Next time I head up to Chicago, I will be seeking this out immediately."
"Carbonation is good but mouthfeel can seem a bit thin at times for my liking. I could certainly see myself drinking more of this in the summer if it were readily available, and a bit cheaper from what I understand. Overall it is a really good pale ale with enough hops to keep me satisfied and coming back for more."
"At 9.00 a four/pack...I would choose a six pack of beer that falls more squarely into the slot as a PA or an IPA for the same price."
"Very sessionable ale from a local brewer."
"O: this is a great beer, had never heard of it, so thanks again bay01 for the opportunity to try!"
"overall i felt this beer was just teasing me - i wanted more but then this is only an APA not an IPA - i can not wait to try more half acre beers!"
"Overall a great refreshing hop forward pale ale. If I could find this locally I would get this beer regularly."
"O: Hands down, one of the best session beers on the market. I could kick back with a case of this stuff every weekend. This one drinks and feels like an American IPA, but earns it's APA classification with ease. Don't be shy in seeking Half Acre's Daisy Cutter out - it's good drinking."
"My glass is empty and i desperately want to open another one."
"Nice light bodied, crisp and refreshing pale ale, with excellent bitterness initially but finishes with only light herbal notes in your mouth. Very easy to drink, as expected from a 5.2% abv beer. Would probably drink this all the time as this would go well with any meal or to enjoy several of them as a session beer on a warm summer day."
"The mouthfeel is a little thin and highly carbonated, it still feels good though. And the drinkability is very good. This is a great pale ale that I wish were locally available, because I'd be drinking it all summer. I'm not sure if this is worth going to great length to get, but it sure is delicious."
"The mouthfeel isn't particularly thick but is just right for the style. Carbonation is very high, adding a nice aspect to the feel. Overall this was a decent pale ale but I've had others locally that are just as good so I probably won't make an effort to find any more of this one. But if it were available locally, I could see myself picking it up again."
"An easy drinking pale ale but not impressive. I had pretty high hopes for this beer but found it to be an average representation of the style. An ok beer but not something I will seek out in the future especially considering how difficult it is to find."
"With the giant head, I expected harsher carbonation, but it works well. Probably perfect for the can, but I prefer my pale ales with lighter carbonation. Finishes quite dry, almost reaching for water. Would definitely be awesome in the summer and super drinkable."
"edit (7/8/2011): had some more of this that is very fresh and although i agree with a lot of my original review, i might bump it up a bit in overall...it really is a solid pale ale and worth seeking out."
"D: I could drink these all night long, such a great flavor profile for only a 5.2 ABV. Had 5 pints the other night while playing Top Golf and left yearning for more."
"D: Immensely drinkable, and it's good stuff. I'd certainly have it again."
"D- downed the pint can with ease. Could drink these all night"
"Drinkability is high on this one. Relatively low ABV delicious taste and just the right bite. I am looking for this one."
"d - Overall I thought this was a great pale ale with a great hoppy nose. Felt like I could drink a few cans of this and gladly would. Glad to have another can of this and would trade for more in the future. One of the best APA's I've had."
"D- this is fantastic. I wish it was available on the east coast. The fact that it's in cans makes it that much more awesome. I want more, stat"
"If I had regular access to it, this would be a nice beer for the beach or the golf course. Not a high alcoholic content beer so it's very sessionable."
"The CPJ"
"M/D: Medium bodied, very crisp and clean. Overall, I like it, no knowledge of can date, so unsure if the muted flavor is from age or not."
"(16oz can courtesy of jcnd9803!) Pours hazy copper with 2 finger off-white head. Getting some aroma of spice/pepper, cardboard, unripened melon, and perhaps some lemon. Taste has some bread/biscuit from the malt. Not very sweet and mildly bitter. Thin bodied and somewhat watery. Balanced finish between the bready malt and hop bitterness. Not a great beer, but this would be a nice session beer and I think it would grow on me as the sesssion progressed."
"D-very drinkable. Taste gone in no time!"
"D - The Drinkability is good because of the wateriness of it. Overall this is not that great in comparison to may of the other canned Pale Ales. Based on the color and Alcohol content, it should have more flavor."
"Overall, I really don't see how could one do a better interpretation of an American Pale Ale. At first, when smelling it, I thought it would be more in the IPA ballpark. But, the really nice balance of hops and malts makes it a perfect summer brew. Very refreshing."
"This was poured from a 16oz can. It poured a beautiful and rich golden, honey yellow with a one finger bright white head. It was moderately cloudy. It smelled of light piny hops with a light and honeylike sweet malt backbone. The flavors consisted of very clean piny hops and light honey. The balance is excellent. It is insanely smooth and has a superb mellow finish. It draws you back in. This is one of the best APAs I've ever had. I'd even say it's better than Alpha King."
"Daisy Cutter built me up, yet failed to knock me down. It's refreshing and drinkable enough -- just a little disappointing after the crazy-good aroma and beautimous appearance."
"A good session brew from Half Acre."
"Pretty drinkable, most of this was gone before i noticed. The lingering bitterness from the hops is the only thing that slow me down"
"Edit: In the past few months I've had this beer several times and have fallen in love. My favorite APA hands down. The zesty, bitter, asprin-like sourness just wreck the palate...but in a good way. This is the APA that has killed the style for me. I feel lucky having this so available."
"Poured from a 16oz can into my pint glass. this beer pours a hazy straw color with a decent white head. the smell is powerful and piney and citrusy. the taste is totally lacking. there is almost now flavor with just a little bitterness at the end. the moutfeel is light and drinkability is only so so due to the lack of flavor. I went into this one with high expectations due to the reputation that this beer carries and was totally let down. its an ok beer, but if it ever made its way to ma i would likely not by any."
"Pours a hazy tan with a thin beige head. Nose has fresh floral and citrusy hops well balanced by sweet malts. Nice balance of malts and hops here. Body a bit thin, decent finish of bitter hops. Nice pale ale, good session beer. Go get one, try it for yourself."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Very light bodied. A very light and springy beer that makes me feel like I'm floating on a flower bed. The delicious hop finish is what makes this beer really shine."
"Once the glass was placed in front of me I was greeted to a nice sunny orange glowing cup of pale ale. The color looked very appealing to me and being only a block away from the half acre brewery I could only assume it was pretty fresh. The smell of this beer was a treat on the nose, I could pick out the piney hop goodness and some other fresh smelling tones. It reminded me of a crisp spring morning. Taking a drink of this beer I could definitely taste the pine hops and some other floral ingredients and boy did they taste good. It reminded me of an ipa with a little less bitterness and more of a earthy fresh crisp kick. The mouth feel was also very appealing to me, it was pretty carbonated and felt good on the palate. I would definitely try this one again many times"
"My standard pour at the local bar. Pours a nice orange color but a bit cloudier than I'd like for the style. Aroma is great, pine and hop and citrus. Flavor is also outstanding. Citrus comes through up front and finishes dry and with just the right punch of bitterness. Feels light with a refreshing level carbonation. Infinitely drinkable as I have certainly put down quite a few in one sitting many times. Great job Half Acre"
"Half Acre has done it again. Having tried about five or six of their brews, this one takes the cake. It's a bit on the mild side compared to some of the hoppier IPA's out there. A (very) little bit of sweetness brings out some of the character of the hops including a tropical/citrus and pine flavor that are perfectly balanced with the bitterness. This is quite simply my IPA of choice."
"Had I bought this in cans, I surely would have had another, but at $5 a pop on tap, I had to settle for just one today. I am planning a brewery tour soon though, so it won't be long before I get my second helping of this very drinkable and enjoyable brew."
"Poured a bright golden orange, with a couple fingers of dense head that retains beautifully. Great lacing as well. Nose was unreal, some tropical and floral notes coming out the wazoo. Mango, sweet fruits, with some lighter pine notes. Some citrus in there as well. Great hops, with a sense of a warmer, gentler sweetness to all of this. Taste is right there with the nose, mango and clementine kick this one off. Smooth with a ton of tropical fruits. Good clean bitterness, and a solid finish. Full mouthfeel and a great feel overall. Drinkability is through the roof, makes me a sad panda not having access to this regularly. Up there with Alpha King in terms of favourite pale ales."
"Atmosphere is good. Nice hue, and this brew gives great head. Lots of sticky lacing, too. Nose is full and floral. Flavor is not complex, but if you like pales, this will do it. Kind of a purist brew. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"A very aromatic pale ale that I would drink in warmer climates. I doubt it'll be available again up here, hence the review."
"Great beer. Highly recommend!"
"Drinkability - Damn quaffable. This is (yes I know it's too high ABV) my kind of ""session"" beer. Extremely flavorful, not a huge ABV, and extremely easy to drink. I could put a couple pints of this down no problem. Can't wait to stock up on this when I get home this summer."
"Very dry citrus front with bubbly fresh pineapples and mango. Very high carbonation that scrubs your palate on every sip and I am loving every second of it. Rounding out the middle there is alfalfa, grass, earth, and soft bready notes which balance the whole package. In the finish I am pulling out orange marmalade and no heat alcohol which makes this super drinkable and delicious."
"I enjoyed this beer. It is not something I will try and track down again though. If it was easily available to me I would love this tubing down the river in the summer."
"Powerfully smooth but with toasty-hoppy dryness, it reminds me a lot of Three Floyds Alpha King but wit a crisper, cleaner body and less sweet- a respectable compliment to say the least."
"D: Outstanding. Love it. Very sad I can't make it a regular. Come to NYC, guys!"
"I prefer my beers a bit more assertive, and this one is just too subtle for me. Love the smell, but let down by the taste. Even so, I want Half Acre to be wildly successful. I'm glad they're doing what they do in Chicago, and hope they keep doing it. Otherwise, how would I get my Double Daisy Cutter? Yum."
"D - I could drink a couple of these without my palate tiring, good balance for such hoppy goodness."
"On tap at Hunt Club 1/14/11...poured a pale and slightly cloudy yellow with an ok head...aroma not really that impressive, not much to it, nothing that really stands out. There's something objectionable on the tongue...I've been drinking A-class exceptionally balanced beers all night and there is something about this one that offends. Oh, I'm so sorry to have a not great review on a local brand, I even rated it a little bit higher for proximity to my house...sorry guys, this is quaffable but just isn't that solid."
"Drinkability- highly drinkable! A very solid beer"
"Drinkability: Very nice drinking beer that I would definitely make a regular if I was in the distribution area."
"D: Very drinkable; nothing stopping or limiting my enjoyment of this one at all."
"Too bad I can't buy it in the northern suburbs, I think it would be my go to beer"
"Highly drinkable, even in an Irish bar."
"D: ill drink more of this. its not my favorite apa, but it is a good beer."
"Old-school ""microbrew"" style here, fresh and raw with more than enough flavor to go around. Surpassing the benchmark."
"This one has great character, depth, balance and flavor, and one beer that is completely and perfectly drinkable."
"Overall, a really nice pale ale I wish was available around here. A ton of hop flavor here yet it still remains incredibly smooth. I really enjoyed this a lot."
"D: Great! One of the more memorable pales I've had. I enjoyed how soft and smooth the beer went down, while still giving up the flavors which make it so unique. Well done!"
"Drinkability is good. This beer has a decent amount of hops for an APA and the nose is quite nice, but the flavor and mouthfeel don't offer enough to really set this beer apart. Maybe a fresh pint on-tap turns things up a notch or two."
"4.0 D: I really like the hops, but I'm not a bit fan of the yeastiness. I can definitely see how so many people like this though. Definitely worth a drink to get to the raw, dank, and mouth-puckering hops."
"Tasted from a can that I grabbed at the Half Acre Brewery. Pours clear orange with with a thick white head that slowly dissipates to leaving a solid lace. Nose is aromatic citrus hops with a nice malt backbone. The citrus is actually very enjoyable with fresh orange, grapefruit, and lemon. The beer is undoubtedly bitter from the hops, but there is a hint of sweetness along with all of the different citrus flavors that were also in the nose. The body is fairly light with average carbonation and a long grapefruit finish."
"This is a very good session beer (& no, I don't give a flying monkey crack what the ABV is) that I'd love to have hanging around. Delighted to have gotten to try it & looking forward to some more Half Acre stuff."
"D - This is a truly wonderfully crafted, slightly unique, bold, and overall killer beer. Loads of flavor, a perfect amount of balance, all in a small package. Crisp, refreshing, good in summer or winter. Easily the best APA I've had to date, one that all others will be judged against. Kudos to Half Acre for this one."
"Edit: I see that I seemed to have liked it even better from the can. Keeps those cans coming!"
"Overall I was a fan of this beer and understand why it receives all the attention. Not quite in the top tier but it doesn't have far to go. Worth a shot."
"Wonderful APA that is easily drinkable all night wish this was distributed wider, but thanks to various trading partners to hook me up."
"DELICIOUS, MUST TRY!"
"D: Goes down very easy, very tasty, mild kick, not very filling, excellent representation of style. This could possibly be my new favorite APA... which I of course can't get here."
"This is a solid American Pale Ale. There is a great showcase of assertive hops in the nose with a perfect blend of flavors. It's not overly bitter, and is extremely refreshing. Would love to see this distributed in my neck of the woods."
"Drinkability: I did not remember this being as enjoyable as it was. Definitely something I will come back to frequently."
"So easy to drink"
"D-- Really good APA. Very crisp and very fresh. Easy to drink and knock back a few of these easily. As good, if not better than the best Aussie APA."
"Pours a hazy sunset color with a dense, foamy white head that leaves rings of dense, foamy lace. Intense aroma of citrusy and grassy hops that almost has a smokiness to it that adds so much to the smell. Taste is consistent with the smell, but the smokiness doesn't make an appearance until the aftertaste, creating a very cool effect. Mouthfeel is a little too weak for my tastes, and is the only fault I can find with this brew. I've been on a bit of a pale ale bent lately and was starting to get sick of them, but Daisy Cutter has definitely piqued my interest again."
"Easy to drink, but not blown away by it. An A beer, but mostly on aesthetics versus flavor.. Would happily try it again..."
"Drinkability: Very easy and refreshing."
"Not a shabby pale ale by any standards. Were this available in my corner of the world, I'd probably have another."
"The only beer I can think of wishing to have on tap at all times besides this beer for regular drinking would be Furious, maybe Pliny if I was feeling like a higher ABV."
"D: Easy drinking @ 5.2% ABV, love this beer more when I'm not being critical of it. Easy drinking and lemongrassy. Sure."
"Very drinkable, and a great APA. Wish this was readily available as I can see myself keeping this one in the fridge all the time."
"Very good; this low alcohol ale is packed with flavor and is very refreshing. Highly recommended!"
"A very, very strange animal. Not a classic pale ale in the slightest. I could have done with a toned down earth/grass presence and more citrus."
"D: High. NO problem polishing off the 16 oz can, could have had another. Overall, I think with a touch more body this could be an allstar beer. Would love to try the double daisy."
"Hop lovers dream in this can. The hop-head's lawnmower beer, truly, a great sessioner. It's a mark of American innovation, I think, that a beer so hop forward, so beautifully bitter can be seen as a session ale. In the craft beer revolution, we won't accept mediocrity in the session ale. here's to daisy cutting!"
"Drinkability: So far, this is the best pale ale I've had that was made here in chicago and this is my first tasting of a Half Acre beer. Great beer and very refreshing. I hope everything from Half Acre is as good as this, or better."
"I want to like this beer much more than I do. It certainly has potential but it just is not exciting me. While not being exciting, it is relatively easy to drink. Decent APA."
"D- This isn't your normal pale ale. Big flavors but not overly done. I had been hearing about this beer for a while now and I wasn't disappointed."
"Overall, an easy drinker. Good and tasty. (the burps taste good too!)"
"Overall: For me, this beer needs more than just hops, and hops is all I get from this beer. One can of this beer is all the bitterness I can handle tonight."
"M: Good carbonation and body."
"D - The citrusy hop profile and biscuity malt character do wonders for the drinkability - if this wasn't my last Daisy Cutter I'd be having 5 more after it. The lack of bitter and perfect carbonation easily score the 5/5."
"not my favorite, but I'd have it again. goes down smooth and readily available in my area."
"Also they came in pints which I wish all beers did because bombers can be too much and 12 oz is never quite enough."
"Nice, somewhat cloudy orange/golden color. Huge head on top-remains most of the way down with some good lacing. Big hop aroma-very grassy and fresh mown lawn aroma. Big blast of hop bitterness upfront-very astringent and puckering. Just enough malty sweetnes to balance. A lot of flavor for only a US pale-comes off as a double. Good solid mouthfeel. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Once again a ton of flavor in a 5.2% package. Yummy!"
"D. I would certainly be drinking this frequently if it were local."
"This is without a doubt the best APA I've ever had - I'd put it right there up against the big boys of the IPA and DIPA universe. Absolutely world class. I'm literally hurt right now that I can't buy this locally. Changed my life, man. Get this shit. The dankest beer ever."
"Strong hop flavors and bitterness up front. Grassy, herbal, citrusy hops that overall create a spicy, gently numbing bitterness. Light biscuit and fruit malt make a subdued showing, but provide enough base to make this beer work. Hop flavors become more resinous in the bitter, dry finish. Moderate body with a smooth, creamy feel. Very appetizing and eminently drinkable. One of the best APAs I've ever had!"
"Can't taste any alcohol, which doesn't really surprise me at all with the abundance of flavor. Pretty easy to session, but it's also surprisingly malty as well as hoppy so it's not quite as refreshing as a lot of the west coast style pales. Really an excellent beer though and perhaps the best pale I have had besides RR Parking Violation?"
"Terrific APA! Wish it were available to me here in MN, because this could quite possibly be my replacement go to."
"D-I'd have another no problem. Very drinkable beer with big flavor."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is well carbonated and light. The hops are not coating but dont need to be. This is an aggressive hop bomb treat. The beer disappeared far too fast!"
"A solid, drinkable pale ale with balanced flavor. The 16 oz cans are a plus as well."
"D- A very good take on the style and my new benchmark for an APA. Worth seeking out."
"You can easily drink this beer in succession. It's goes down smooth but its got big flavor."
"I was very excited to get this from bauermc in the hoppy summer to you bif. I poured from a 16 ounce can into a SA perfect pint glass. The pour is hazy gold with a massive, sticky, 3 finger white head. Lots of grapefruit and orange peel on the nose. It taste as good as it smells, the citrus is perfedtly balanced and it has a slightly bitter finish that really lingers. The beer has a ton of flavor for a 5% ABV. One of the best APA's i have had the pleasure to drink."
"Poured into a true pint glass a cloudy dark yellow color, nice carbonation, HUGE three-finger foamy white head, with some very nice thick sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some malt notes, citrus, slight pine notes. The taste is hoppy, slightly sweet, malty, very nice citrus notes, and some pines. Medium body. Very Drinkable, one of the best APA I've had in a very long time. This is also my first from this brewery. Thanks Chris."
"Drinkability: Wow I wish this as offered here, super smooth and a doable ABV for a couple. If you have this on tap at your local watering hole it must suck going to bars without it!"
"Received a 4 pack from Darwensi, thanks man. I loved the DD cutter so I was looking fwd to trying this. Pours a nice bright orange with a 2 finger fluffy pillow on top. Leaves really nice sticky lacing on the glass. Smells of tropical fruit, mango, pineapple and hint of lemon, very nice indeed for a pale ale. Taste is fairly hop forward with a bit of bready malt in there. Mouthfeel is nice but it does seem a bit thin towards the end of the glass as it warms up. I guess that is my only complaint. Highly drinkable for sure. I would love to have a few of these while sitting on the beach in cape May, NJ..I already asked Darwensi to send me more. Well done half acre, recommended."
"D - This is highly drinkable, I could see this as a year round go-to it is just packed full of hop flavor for such a low abv beer"
"D- Despite some of the problems I have with this beer I still found it pretty easy to drink. Eh, a really thoughtful extra and I was stoked to receive it, its just not what I expected."
"Overall: By far the best APA I've had. I would love to drink this regularly."
"Hopefully this can doesn't hurt as much as its namesake bomb. It pours a thoroughly hazy light amber topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises heavy hoppy notes, running the gamut from pine to ruby red grapefruit to even the onions that made Gubna a hardship for some. A slightly syrupy caramel undertow flows beneath the hoppy ice above. The taste is fairly hoppy on its own, but not nearly as much as the smell. Behind this veil o' hops recline some light toffee, light sweet caramel, cotton candy, and some slight florals. The body is fairly light, though bordering on the light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a finish tending toward the dry. Overall, a very solid APA, but I think it falls a little short of the hype presented to me beforehand. Still very good, but not *that* good."
"D- Very good drinker, a couple of these would be nice by a bonfire especially straight outta the can."
"This pours a slightly cloudy light golden orange color with a puffy white finger off foam that has some nice head retention on it. The aroma is hops...possibly Cascade...I don't know if I can say anything else because in all honesty it all that I really smell. The hops do however provide a delicious floral and citrus aroma that is unmistakable. The taste is surprisingly not nearly as bitter as I had anticipated, but there is a bitterness in the aftertaste. Instead there is a quite obvious earthy mineral taste to the beer which can be tasted even more so than the malts. The citrus flavors of the hops are palpable as well. I must be honest, for something that sounded so powerfully destructive as this it's quite light and pleasant on the palate. There is an overall herbal tea style taste to it which is interesting to say the least. There is a lot of carbonation which i suppose enhances the flavor of the hops as well as the aroma. A quite enjoyable pale ale, this is from someone who really doesn't like the flavor of hops. I must say props to the local stuff."
"I wish i could get this at home in Philadelphia, it would be a regular in my fridge."
"In about the same range as fresh SNPA but with a slightly cleaner finish. Yet another solid canned craft beer."
"D: Holly cow what an amazing APA. Once I smelled this beer I thought I was drinking an IPA! Amazing amount of hops, and one of the most drinkable pale ales I've ever had."
"Poured this into a pint glass and it yields hazy copperish color with a big fluffy white head that dwindles a bit into a thing layer with nice lacing. The smell is hops with fruity tropical notes. Piney with a solid malt backbone. Hoppier taste than what I had imagined but wow! What a knock out. Fresh hops start to finish with pale malts. This is great! Mouthfeel is on point but a little heavier than I imagined. The drinkability of this is perfect. I could drink this all day!"
"provided by dirtylou, accompanied us on our roadtrip, and then smuggled back to VA"
"D: This would be a session beer for me if it were available. Great everyday drinker in a can that lets you take it to more places. It is not often you are blown away by a pale ale but more people should be seeking this out. Thanks for the trade guys."
"Nose, nose, nose....such a nice mixed hoppy nose. This is good stuff...a light resiny mouthfeel that sticks all over. The appearance is pretty average, but the taste is a nice beer. More hops in the nose than the palate which is a unique touch. A really nice effort."
"D - Very easy drinker, nice sweet flavored and not over powering in the hops department, enough to make a great first impression. Big thanks to Albgarza for this. Got a four pack in a trade from him so I will be having this brew again and of course I recommend it!"
"Drinkability is incredible, great summer beer, and at 5.2%, could drink these all day."
"The body is medium and carbonation is high but appropriate. Overall this beer isn't going to knock your socks off, but if you are looking for a clean, sessionable beer with subtle hop flavor that keeps you reaching for the glass then look no further."
"More than half way through my glass, I need to write more and stop pausing constantly to take a sip. Really a super drinkable beer as proclaimed by the steadily decreasing level in my glass. It has a medium feel with a very modest level of carbonation that is prickly on the tongue. Fantastic representation of the style and well rounded overall. There are many Pale Ales (Indian included) that could take a lesson from the hop character included in this brew."
"Overall, this is a great pale ale that is very drinkable. I could have a lot of this in one sitting. Reminds me of an ipa. Very impressed with this one."
"I could drink this all day. Definitely the best pale ale I have had."
"Thanks to bauermj for this awesome extra! 16oz can into a Hopus tulip pours a hazy pale orange with a nice frothy off white head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and a few rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma is some citrus hops and sweet malts. The taste is a very nice balance of sweet malts just slightly overpowering the citrus hop backbone, very nice balance. The beer is very light, smooth and quite refreshing with perfect carbonation. This is an absolutely incredible pale ale, dare I say the best I've ever had. If this were available here in NC, it would be a mainstay in my beer fridge for sure!"
"Can and Tap. Have heard and read good things about this brew and am looking forward to trying it. Bought a 4 pack of it in Chicago only to find it on tap at the hotel I was staying at, total score! Poured a slightly cloudy golden orange/yellow color with a tight little 1 finger head. The aroma that I get is mostly of citrus hops and rind. The taste can easily be described as smooth and balanced with a nice hops presence up front that transitions to the malt backbone. This to me is one of the best Pale Ales I have had in a long time."
"Goldenish pour with small head, good retention and great lacing. Excellent nose of citrusy and floral hop character, not super pungent but enough to keep me interested. Good hop flavor, malts in the background to a medium bitterness with a crisp and dry finish. Hoppy for a typical pale ale perhaps, but not too overly hopped such that it's not approachable or too much to pair with everyday food. Supremely drinkable and a great pale ale. Love the pint cans- I would buy this buy the case if I could get it locally."
"My only complaint with this one is that Ryan didn't tape his growler up and much of the carbonation has run out of the bottle on me. I can live with that because even with less carbonation than it should have, the beer still tastes amazing."
"D - This beer is a great summer ale. If I lived closer to Half Acre I would enjoy getting some cans of it for a Cubs game. I would imagine this tastes refreshing from the tap to the glass, but overall very enjoyable. Thanks Hosp for the can."
"very drinkable."
"An outstanding flagship beer that needs to make its way to NC, stat."
"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. It balances the taste of hops and grain very well. It's also light and very refreshing. A good summer beer!"
"Thanks Nate!"
"I've been wanting to try this one for awhile now, and it certainly lived up to my expectations. This would definitely be a staple in my fridge if it were in my local store. Can't wait to try some of Half Acres other offerings."
"Beer is medium to light in a body with a creamy mouthfeel. Its good definitely. The bitterness in the back is interesting and not overpowering but assertive and dominant. There is some graininess to it, highly drinkable, good hop flavors in the midpalate. I'm enjoying this beer a lot. I would definitely have it again."
"I picked it up form the fridge and it seems pretty fresh, a good lighter beer that is sweet and hoppy enough to impress even the strong IPA/DIPA lovers. Though 10$ for a 4pack seems unreasonable for this one."
"Flavors of orange and grapefruit, floral hops and a little dry crackery malt meet the tongue first, with grapefruit and pine lingering in the finish. Only mildly bitter, and fairly dry. Damn near perfect for the style, this is a great pale ale, refreshing but extremely flavorful. I need to track down a few cans of this."
"overall - perfect for a hot summer day like today. Its an unusual flavor profile, but quite good."
"This is a great APA. This would probably be a great IPA if it were classified as one, especially when considering the relatively low ABV. Very nice beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, refreshing and easy to drink. Great body and carbonation make this an overall wonderful pale ale that definitely borders towards an IPA. An easy candidate for summer sessions and lazy days at the beach. So glad to have Half Acre join the ranks of Chicago brewers!"
"This is a tasty, easy drinking beer, perfect for a warm summer day. It paired well with my wild salmon burger."
"D: Great canned beer. Seems spot on for the style. Wish this were local, I'd purchase it frequently"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability is unreal, so drinkable, everything you could want in a pale ale."
"(D)- A solid pale ale with everything going for it. Would be a staple in my fridge, but $10 for a 4pk of cans is a tad steep. Nonetheless, an enjoyable beer."
"D-Very refreshing beer that drinks pretty easily. The only thing I would probably change about this beer would be to amp up the aroma hops."
"A great (IPA masquerading as a) pale ale in the west coast style, but not quite something like Alpha King."
"Drinkability- This is a very refreshing APA. Not the biggest one out there, but I would not want to exchange the pleasant flavors for more alcohol and thickness."
"D: Very good PA IMO. Half Acre just needs to start distributing alittle further south! Great brewery with cool staff! Also would like to comment on there in house soda tasteing. Had a cucumber, thyme, and jalapeno soda that was oddly refreshing!"
"D: I wish I had more than two cans of this. This seems like the best beer to have after a long day of work, which I am doing now."
"Slightly muted golden translucent color body below soapy white head that has moderate staying power. Smell is very nice: a balanced blend of citrus, pine, and floral hop aromas (with just a little emphasis on grapefruit citrus). At the front end of each sip is a bold hop bitterness, followed by just enough of a little biscuity malt for balance. The finish is crisp and bitter, and leaves a trace of floral flavor behind to invite a second sip. Body is light and thin-- surprising for such a flavorful APA. Daisy Cutter strikes a great balance of flavor and drinkability. I'll be keeping these around for many a summer BBQ."
"While it lacked just a bit of the punch that the fresh growler I had previously consumed of this had, there's no denying that this is one of thee best American Pale Ales out on the market right now. Growler, can, bottle, anyway you it, this is just a tremendously flavorful and easy drinking quaff. Fantastic stuff!"
"body is a bit thin, which is my only complaint. low ABV and excellent flavor make this VERY drinkable."
"You can't help but like this beer. Everything feels like it was done on purpose. The crispness, the sharpness, were done really well. Why can't I get this in Indiana? Geez, it's not like it wouldn't sell."
"D-This is a good overall beer especially if you want to sit back relax and throw back a few (or more)."
"The body is a little thinner and more slick than I would like. Could stand a bit more depth. Starts out a bit harsh on the bitterness scale, but this mellows out towards the end. Some light peppery spiciness present. Citrus notes noted. Not a bad beer. I expected more, but still, great styling for an APA."
"I can't wait to have this one again - perfect for a hot day in July!"
"D: Excellent. This is a light, super easy drinking beer with a nice favor profile. The taste doesn't quite live up to the smell, but overall this is an excellent beer. Wish we could get this around here."
"Drinkability: Overall this has such a nice low abv that it really is a great session style ipa. i have to get some more of this shit."
"D - This was really good. I had heard about Daisy Cutter and it did not disappoint."
"Maybe its just me but I feel like some pale ales may as well be IPAs. This, on the other hand, is light, crisp, and refreshing. Just how I think a pale ale should be. Great stuff."
"Drinkability? Very nice. Huge flavor, sub-6% abv, very manageable bitterness - strengths lie in all the right places, and no noticeable weakness."
"D: Well my can is nearly gone and I feel like I just opened it. Not as hoppy as I remember but very well balanced and an all around great beer, something to be sought out for sure."
"Poured a nice golden amber with a tight head. Smell is very sweet with hints of pine and nuts. Taste is crisp and clean, fairly malty as well. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and dry, refreshing and leaves me always wanting to take a sip. This beer truly is great and so has great repeat drinkability being only 5.2%, light, and crisp."
"Pours a gorgeous hazy golden color with a nice frothy head that is full and fluffy. As the head slowly diminishes, I take a sniff. I'm so blown away by this ale...Never had so much hops hit my nostrils in a pale ale. Even most IPAs don't have such a strong hop scent. Very impressive...this smell is out of this world. The taste is just as amazing. Very strong hop presence with very little malt characteristics. Absolutely breathtaking. Clean and crisp with lovely citrus fruits on the back of the tongue. Lemon, orange, grapefruit, and a tiny bit of melon. This is the most complex and flavorful pale ale I've ever had. Better than a handful of IPAs I've had (and I've had many.) Absolutely amazing beer. Great Job!"
"Well done!"
"Libation: Very good all around and better canned than the bottled versions I've had. Hat's off to Half Acre or taking the step toward increased sustainability and a great way to deliver their beer."
"My pour created a finger of fluffy, bone-white head with good retention. The beer was a cloudy lemon-yellow, like raw honey. Nose was very grapefruit-citrusy! Mmmm. Hops. Good! Mouthfeel was medium with a pronounced citrus hops bite. Goddam! The finish was puckeringly dry, like I had just bitten into a grapefruit at breakfast. Man, this was pretty intense for being called an ""AmeriCAN Pale Ale"". The combined relatively low ABV and intense flavor make it a definite cooler CANdidate, if only I could get some more. 8=( Definitely worth seeking out."
"Overall - A fantastic APA. Nice mix of citrus hops and malt, reminds me a bit of Alpha King. Not as hoppy, but that's a good thing. Highly recommended."
"Poured hazy amber color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate sour citrus hop aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium bitter flavor with a medium bitter finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable brew."
"to me this blurred the lines between a pale ale and an IPA. It was a golden amber color with good head retention and excellent lacing. Smell was preety hop heavy, but excellent. Citusy hops are the dominant flavor and despite the big hop profile, the beer is not overly bitter. I thought the mouthfeel was great to with just the right amount of carbonation and a slightly sticky, but good feel."
"The flavor is of grapefruit rind and juicy flesh, with accompanying notes of pine and orange. Like the aroma, the flavor shows no real sign of malt except for a whisper of biscuit character. Bitterness is at a pleasant moderate level. The mouthfeel is dry, sticky, and crisp. Carbonation is at an upper moderate level. This is a very good hoppy pale ale. Highly recommended. Excellent stuff and extremely drinkable."
"The more I drink this beer, the more drinkable it becomes."
"D: Very smooth and refreshing. Could drink this one any day. Would love to have this available down here."
"This beer would work to have several while watching a game or on a a patio, while still being interesting enough to sip for a while. This is likely the best APA I've ever had."
"Very well done and I'm glad that this is my first offering from Half Acre."
"This was a little more bitter than I expected. It seemed a little aggressive for a pale ale, but was still quite enjoyable. Tasted like apricot and grapefruit. Once I got started this went down pretty easily. I would certainly order this again."
"D: intresting pale ale but a great offering from half acre. Liked the beer all around. Send me some more peter."
"D-this is quite a tasty and hoppy pale ale, very nice drink and very enjoyable. little thin in boddy but i don't want to split hairs."
"A wonderfully drinkable beer. I wish this was local to Boston. Would definitely be a staple for me. Among my favorite Pale Ale's..."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Goes down super smooth, this is a great pale ale with some pretty cool character. Thanks Alex!"
"D: One of the best pale ales I've had, ever, to be quite honest. This is almost to the point of an IPA in terms of the hop character, but it was great no matter what you call it."
"dry and hoppy. that's what it has going on. very little malt character; just enough to keep the beverage off the tea shelf. hop flavor is nice: good bitterness for an APA and some prickly grapefruit. the hop enhances what sweetness is already there from the malt bill"
"It's certainly unique although I can't say I was overly impressed for something that is rated so high here. Would give it another shot but wouldn't seek it out."
"A strange goose, but a nice beer to have after a long run. The weedy character is weird, but looking past that its got some great drinkability to it, and my glass doesn't last long. Really glad I got to try this one! Thanks again, Eric!"
"Goes great with food or just a glass. Try it."
"A very tasty APA, but not hitting me as particularly vibrant or fresh. I can tell there is promise there, and I regret not getting a draught when I had the chance at The Bottom Lounge."
"D -Almost more of an IPA than a pale ale by flavor profile, although alcohol level is fairly low at 5.2% keeping this more in line with the APA style. Very full flavored beer - tons of hops and plenty of malt presence. Malt is not typical - not much in the caramelly flavors, way more towards the dry, biscuity malt flavors which serves this beer really well. I would highly recommend this beer...I could drink this all day without any complaints. For a beer with this much flavor (especially hop flavor), it is extremely easy drinking...tastes great and the alcohol is on the low end of the spectrum for craft beers...a winning combination for sessionability."
"D - I thought the grassy hops wouldn't get to me at first but after a while I'm wondering why this was so acclaimed. It's a middle-of-the-road Pale Ale that's not all that impressive, Not something new really and definitely not worth searching hard for. It's still drinkable none-the-less."
"Medium bodied, perfectly carbonated. Soft, plush texture. This beer is ridiculously drinkable. As good of a hoppy pale ale as I've ever tasted. Quality stuff."
"Overall a bit of a let down. I've had this on tap and remember it being much better. Now I know never buy this in bottle form. Maybe the cans will translate better."
"D - A drinkable and well balanced pale ale. This beer has a level of hop character that nearly pushes it into the IPA category, especially the fresh, powdery hop aromas. However, it is nicely balanced with restrained bitterness and nice malt balance. Very good, and quite sessionable by American standards."
"Give me this all night long. For a beer to have this much flavor at such a low abv is amazing. Outstanding APA and a must try! My only regret is not picking up more of this."
"As a Pale, this beer has a backbone and bite that often is lacking in the breed. This comes at the expense of balance and malt underpinnings. This is a pale for hopheads. It's brighter than most IPAs and lacks some of the sometimes cloying piny viscosity of bigger IPAs. This is a good thing as March fades and the promise of April and spring is around the corner. A very nice summer beer."
"D: Excellent hoppy pinch and super balance, wrapped inside a session-worthy strength. Pale Ales aren't usually something I go to crazy over, but this is certainly a fine one I'd really like to have again. Well played, Half Acre, well played..."
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable. The body and the hop character join forces to make a beer that's very refreshing. You can certainly have several of these in succession without a lineup change. All in all, it's an exceptional pale ale."
"D= Extremely drinkable, both in the sense of flavor and ABV. An IPA drinker's pale ale, with lots of hop bite. I personally prefer more caramel malt for balance, but that's just me. This is a great example of the style and one I will drink again for sure."
"The beer pours a golden yellow color with a white head. The aroma is piney hops with some other hop flavors. The flavor is medium bitterness and some pine and orange-citrus hops. Medium-high carbonation and medium mouthfeel. A great hoppy American Pale Ale."
" D- This beer has a nice soft malt support to a nice hop flavor but the bitterness just overpowers everything. I think it is still stuck in my tongue."
"Pours a cloudy, rich honey color with a good finger of snowy head that leaves a nice, sticky trail on the glass as you drink it. Smells a very flowery and slightly citrus hoppy aroma. Very well balanced pale ale that really improves as it warms up, which seems very rare for the style. Grass with a gently bitterness to it. Medium body with a creamy, yet easy bite to it that is balanced well with the carbonation. Loved it more and more as it got further into it and could definitely see me drinking more of these."
"D: Drinkability is pretty high here, this is a brew I could session. Overall, I am really enjoying this brew. It's hitting the spot after a long day at work. I would really like to have this one on tap. Skal."
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1"" beige head above the clear golden amber brew. Pillowy head lasts great, with average to good lacing. Aroma is green, fresh hops. Taste starts with pale maltiness, quickly heads toward citrus in the middle, and closes moderately bitter. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, maybe a little gassy, with good drinkability. Nice one that caught me off guard."
"D - Low alcohol, great taste, nothing overpowering, quite easy to drink."
"Overall this is just a great APA. I don't know that I have had a better one ever."
"Half Acre, making some great beers for a great city..."
"With all of this, the mouthfeel is effervescent and light. Backed by the light sweetness, I am reminded distinctly of moscato d'asti wine, if only for a minute in the finish. Wonderful. I would like to see more body though overall. That is one of my only gripes here. Awesome."
"D - Drinkability is superb. There's a lot of flavor packed into the 5.2% ABV, and killing a bomber is no problem at all. It's a fantastic go-to session beer and is totally worthy of the buzz that is going around."
"D - Not as good as a few days old on tap at the brewery but still damn tasty. I highly recommend it if you find it on tap."
"On tap at State and Lake. Pours a super hazy orange juice color with no head or lacing. Great hoppy aroma on this one, plenty of citrus, namely orange, lemon and grapefruit, with a light herbal quality. Taste is fantastic. Nice and hoppy, bitter, orange and grapefruit come out again, semi-sweet pale malts, dry grassy finish. Medium body. This is a fantastic hopped up pale ale with low ABV that keeps it's incredibly drinkable for the bitterness. Yum. I will be drinking several of these over the weekend!"
"Overall, I was surprised as I wasn't expecing much. This is an incredible session beer that will be added to my staple."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It's a very good tasting easy drinking beer that I would gladly have again. it's nice to have something so flavorful and only 5% abv for a change. I could easily have a few of these."
"On a side note, I wish Half Acre dated their bottles. The first bottle of Daisy Cutter I tried had an awful stale cardboard taste. The only reason I purchased another was because of the great reviews it received here."
"Pours a nice caramel-amber with a very nice head and plenty of lacing as it goes down. The smell is loads of citrus with plenty of orange and grapefruit. Some pine in there as well. Great bitterness to this one, and just absolutely outstanding flavor for an American Pale Ale--next to Columbus Pale from Town Hall, probably the best that I've ever had. Medium body and good carbonation with absolutely outstanding drinkability. Man, I miss Chicago."
"Conclusion: This APA is very pleasant on the nose, but is slightly less exciting on the palate. It represents the style well with the exception of an overly dry grip on the tongue and a dry finish."
"D: Highly drinkable and highly enjoyable."
"D - An extremely refreshing and drinkable beer. Next time I'm home I plan to go pick up a growler from the brewery and bathe in it."
"D: Great ABV and very drinkable. This would be right up there Alpha King's APA greatness."
"Conclusion: Awesome! When it comes to beers brimming with hops, usually I'm into DIPAs (Pliny, Hopslam, and Double Crooked Tree are my favs), but this is packed with hop flavor, yet remains drinkable enough to have a few in a setting. What a great beer! I'll have to search out more from this brewery. This is right up there with Southern Tier's Hop Sun."
"D: I'm sure the on-tap version of Daisy Cutter is even better than from the bottle. Drinkable to the point that I'm actually stopping by the brewery after work tomorrow to pick up more of it."
"D: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer that is worth drinking for an entire evening."
"D: the drinkability of this brew is excellent. I'm glad I now have a growler from Half Acre as I am going to have to get fills of this from time to time. Definitely worth checking out!"
"It's just a great bear, I want to drink tons of it. Would be great with some chicken or turkey. Very drinkable. They need to get this stuff into sixers ASAP!"
"Pretty decent looking beer. Vibrant golden color and a inch or so of frothy head with OK retention. Citrus and floral hops hit the nose with very faint malt presence. Strangely the taste doesn't exactly follow the smell - the hops are more herbal and earthy and very little in the way of malt character. I can still pick out some grapefruit but not to the degree I found it in the nose. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side but I don't mind that at all. Drinkability is a strong point as it is 5.2% abv and not at all heave-bodied. This would be a good summer beer and pair well with seafood. Glad I tried this but probably won't be back until summer and I've worn myself out on wheat beers and lighter lagers."
"Overall I do not how this really could have been improved on. It was just amazing. Straight forward hop bomb in a 5 percent package, just wow. Everything I wanted it to be and more. I would have this hooked up in my house every day. Seek it out, it's up there with any of the best I have had."
"I received this as a christmas present from a friend of mine who lives in Chicago. He went to the beer store and asked the guy for some advice, he recommended this and said that it was one of the best APA's around. I must say that he is absolutley correct. This is a great tasting APA and I am very upset that I can't get this where I live. A very easy drinking beer that I could see myself having in all sorts of places. Thanks Brian!"
"D - Very much like a little brother of Founder's Double Trouble. Tasty and easy drinking."
"Yu- ummm. GOOD BEER!! Solid beer. Straightforward pale ale. Poured with a nice white head and lots of lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is malty, a bit earthy, rotting hay, hoppy, and enticing. Flavors the same but lots more. A tiny bit of citrus which, for me, is passable. Very good body and carbonation. Finish is pleasant and super easy to have another swig. Session beer for sure. Job well done."
"This is my favorite pale ale. With Alpha King and this, Chicago has surprisingly emerged as a real destination for this style. Goose Island need not try when there are such options. Now this needs to get into sixers, fast, so that this beer can be enjoyed more widely. I will finish the growler by the end of the night and not be the slightest bit bored. Tremendous beer, and one of my favorites. Top 100 worthy in my mind."
"A very sessionable APA, bomber not a problem for a Sunday afternoon. Hope to make this one of my regulars."
"I loved this beer, as it packs a ton of hoppy bitterness into a light-bodied and super drinkable pale ale. I would stock my fridge with this if I had access. Outstanding."
"D: This is an great everyday beer. SOmething you could enjoy from the day until the night."
"1/6 barrel from the brewery store, one day after brewing."
"Never pass up Daisy Cutter if you find it - this is a fantastic beer!"
"At ~5% this is WAY too easy to drink and is becoming one of my go to beers whenever I see it on draft in the city. I am expecting great things from half acre going forward because they have delivered an awesome pale ale."
"The first sip reveals that Half Acre is taking this style as far as it can go before people just start calling your beer an IPA. If you find IPAs too hoppy, this beer will not provide you shelter. Vigorous and complex hop notes dominate. The grass and pine launch the opening salvo on your taste buds, followed by grapefruit and raw hop bitterness. Just when you think that the beer might fall into an inappropriately bitter finish, a light lemon tang, coupled with some biscuity malt notes, restores order and balance. With that slight detour, Daisy Cutter actually manages a refreshing finish. Truly a world-class APA."
"This is a top notch and very sessionable pale ale that I'll be revisiting as frequently as possible."
"The mouth is a nice combination of silky & oily. The beer is so easy to drink. I hope to see this on tap at more outlets. Well done guys!"
"My first offering from Half Acre and it didn't disappoint, I'm glad that Binny's has a bunch of these on the shelves because I'll certainly be going back for more."
"Very drinkable pretty light, lower abv lots of hops but there will be no problem putting down the bomber I have thanks again to rudylaw for this beer"
"HV"
"2010 standard growler: No carbonation issues, solid mouthfeel, what we've come to expect from Half Acre. A Chicago classic."
"D - Very sessionable and would 100% recommend."
"Like the name of the brew implies, this is a great beer to have after mowing the lawn or a hard day at work. Wouldn't mind having more of this if it was easily available. Another solid brew from Half Acre. Looking forward to more from them."
"D: This is an impressive beer and is the only beer in the APA style which I could say could rival AK. Really an amazing beer; one which I could easily drink all night long. The only issue I have with it is that is not more readily available."
"drinkability: great"
"A perfect, perfect summer ale. A dollar off the price tag and I'd make this my go to from June - August. Now, to try some on tap!"
"Watch out Alpha King, we have a new crown in town. Daisy Cutter is one of my best beer finds of the last couple months and the best pale ale I've ever come across. If you run across this on tap make sure to grab two pints, the first will disappear before you know it."
"quite good via 16 oz can as well. very dryish and crisp, highly aromatic of us hops, maybe the biggest, hoppiest nose on any apa i've had."
"I'm probably not going to seek it out again but it's definitely good."
"I had this on tap at the Map Room, pint glass. The beer wasa little hazy, light orange color, with a 2-finger head that left some lacing on the glass. Nice hops aromas, just the way I like American Pale Ales, some light citrus (more orange than grapefruit) with a light malt sweetness. The taste was light and citrusy, not in-your-face with flavors but an easy drinking hoppy quencher. I'll look for it in bottles next time I'm in Chicago."
"Thanks Dave!"
"couldn't go wrong... a golden orange with a nose of straight pine sap and a billowing head of a nice foam white with lace. palate is very crisp. not to much malt to back it in thickness. a clear sparkling beer. grassy, and well... piney. simple and sweet. wonderful when fresh and i don't want to say it but i can see where they got the name. the hops are crisp and the a bitter grassy finish doesn't resemble dandelion greens."
"This is a solid pale ale from Half Acre brewing. Be warned though it is quite hoppy for the style (which I enjoy)."
"The beer is really easy to drink. Light bodied, well carbonated, nothing overbearing. I drank an entire bomber and really wanted more."
"APA? Yea, whatever. I really wish I could have gotten more detailed with the review, but all I can taste are freshly picked, barely ripe green hop petals with a tangy lemon finish. Pretty damned near perfect. The regional influence is definitely there, as this could easily be the single IPA that Three Floyds never got around to brewing (think Gumballhead with extra IBUs, minus the wheat). Yea, I'm going to be that annoying homer who gives his local beer an A+ after trying it only once. Shoot me."
"D: Awesome. We first had this on draft at Hopleaf and we were really taken with this beer. So far I'm very impressed with the beer they've been turning out of their new brewery."
"Notes: This is the most enjoyable American Pale Ale that I've had in a while. Perhaps due to the freshness of the beer (the brewery is less than two miles from the bar), but I'm wagering that it's the craft of the brewer I'm tasting."
"I'll probably grab another pint after this and pick up a six pack when I see it. This is another newer local brewery and I want to see what else they have to offer in the future. Good job Half Acre!"
