After my first foray with it this summer, I thought it might fill the role, but it would be a couple of months before I saw it at the shop again. With that six pack I was initially underwhelmed (disappointed is actually a more appropriate term for how I felt), and thought it was back to the drawing board, but about halfway through the magic was recovered. I don't know why it seemed so drastically different to me from the first to the second half of that six pack, but I'm now firmly back in the camp of loving it (thought honestly not as much as I had hoped). This is an excellent pale ale from a brewery I am only now learning to appreciate. Sad it took me this long to discover them, but glad I'm getting to now!!","kemoarps","Sep 15, 2013"

Aroma was extremely pilsner-like, I thought, and while I like a good pilsner here and there, I didn't buy a pilsner, and was therefore a little thrown by the zingy grass and breadiness. I should mention I don't drink a lot of pale ales, though I do like SN's (of course, who doesn't?). I guess I was expecting more hoppiness given the story about St. Lupulin tending to his hops and the hop field design on the label, and there is some, but it's not really up front. In fact, this beer is just so balanced, just so medium across the board (medium body, medium hops, medium malt) that it was hard for me to identify this beer's particular character. I mean, where's the hook? What's the angle here? Very drinkable, and you could probably drink these all day long and not get tired of them, though the 6+% abv kind of excludes it from a sessionable as well. Good, but just confused as to where they were going with this.","BeerWizard","Aug 19, 2013"

Poured to pint glass the beer arrives a translucent pale orange color with light honey colored highlights in the light. A decent 1 finger white head with little retention, and a bit of lacing. The nose is hop-forward with notable piney, fruity tones: grapefruit and lemon. Not an assault with the hops but more hoppy than malty, with just a hint of caramel malt base. The flavor again begins with the hops, with a more tropical fruity flavor than the nose let on, the pine and citrus are present as well. Mildly bitter for the style with a gentle caramel malt base. Fruity and sweet, though quite dry. Lighter in body with adequate carbonation. Overall, this is a seasonal release that isn't bad, though I typically buy one 6-pack each release and don't come back.

At first you smell the rind of the clementine, afterwards the actual fruit shows itself to give it some sweet juiciness. A wonderfully layered flavor profile to this, moreso than the aroma had led me to expect. Some clementine and lemon, some grass, some florals, on top a bready, even slightly biscuity, malt foundation. A crisp and silky medium body with some decent activity to it making it very drinkable. Overall, Odell does it again with another great and unique beer. Very bright and refreshing, will make for a great summer beer.

The taste buds grab onto this enjoyable pissy hop that so nicely combines citrus, floral edges and a hint of pine. The body is on the light side, the feel is lightly peppery and crisp, very refreshing while delivery plenty of bright hop satisfaction. It has a bit of biscuit clove that becomes obvious as you go.

The taste is of a lot more balanced than the aroma. There is still a very nice hops presence, but it is moderated by some nice pale malts.

Odell always has terrific bottle art, but I think this one is exceptional, with the glass of beer formed by the negative space in the picture. Pours a nice light gold amber with a ful inch head the consistency of quality dish soap. Incredibly resinous nose with plenty of hop aroma. Pine, grass, and some grapefruit abounds. Hops are present throughout the beer. There's pine and grass up front with some surprising bitterness in the middle of the sip before finishing with citrus fruit. There's no real complexity here, though there's a nice balance between malt and hops. Thisis is a beer that's very straightforward on the palate, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.","eclaycamp","Jun 21, 2010"

My fear of the pale color has been realized. I need more malt besides the slightest wisp of sweetness in the finish. The featured hops do taste good but more balance is needed.

From there the journey gets more exciting - a strong blend of orange blast & melons awaken my senses... all of these bright hoppy flavors are buoyed by a sweetish, lingering maltiness. Sufficient carbonation keeps things crisp, sharp as well, which is a nice treat... I'm surprised the alcohol stands at 6.5% abv, in my mind that detracts from the drinkability.

4.35,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A familiar sweet smell of Odell's hop profile. A bit of maltiness in there. Amber in color with a slight white head. The bitterness of the hops is combined with the sweetness of the hops and malt and creates a good balance. Not the bite of their IPA which I love and which makes this a bit more drinkable. Once again Odell's has produced an incredibly balanced and quality beer. I am lucky that I live in FTC.","johnyeast","Jun 02, 2009"
