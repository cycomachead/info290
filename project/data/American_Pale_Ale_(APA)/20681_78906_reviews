"O: Overall, a very good pale ale. I'm lucky to have tried it."
""
""
"O: This is quite good, definitely in the league of something a Hill Farmstead would put out, if you're looking for a comparison. Buy it when you see it and drink as soon as possible."

"Just plain tasty. Definitely taste of pine and citrus fruit. Perfect balance and nice finish. Something to return to."

"Had this on draft into a tulip glass.  Had it directly after the Half Acre Daisy Cutter, which had a nice west coast feel.  This is distinctly east coast.  Nice earthy piney aroma.  Good body and taste.  A bit on the sweet side. Nice finishing bitterness.  My second MBC beer and I am impressed."

"Excellent balanced pale ale. Not overwhelming. Nice linger."

"16.9oz bottle shared with friends, poured into plastic cups. Golden orange in color with a two-plus finger off-white head that settles to a cap. Not much lacing, but probably due to the ""glassware"". Aroma is very nice: citrus, floral, and grassy hops jump out followed by a slight malt sweetness, mango, and tropical fruit. Taste is a muted version of the aroma. Good hop bitterness, light sweetness - just faded. Not an old bottle by any stretch - less than 30 days post-bottling, well inside the recommended 90 day window. Light-medium body, crisp but thin, thin, thin texture, moderate carbonation, dry, bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
"Over all a good pale ale. Nice hop and citrus notes with the perfect balance of malt. I detect no alcohol. Mouth feel is a little thin. This beers only down fall."
"A true Pale Ale and perhaps the best one I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
"Look, aroma and taste were all solid. Feel was, as many have described, somewhat light. The finish was interesting. Dry with an almost peppery aftertaste. Overall, I thought it was just okay."
""
""
"Poured a one finger off white head that disapated fairly quickly. I was pleased with the decent lacing. Unfortunately though I was disappointed with the smell. I couldn't grasp what it was exactly, but was unpleasing to me. Fourtunetly, that smell did not carry over to the taste. Which I found quite pleasing with sweet citrus flavors that finished with sutle hints of pine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly dry for my taste but otherwise the flavor was spot on."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is really really good.  The bouquet is plentiful.  Taste has a great start and better finish.  My first from this brewery, won't be my last."
""
"Overall: A very good beer, but I will probably never buy it again due to the price.  I feel like I should try everything from Maine Beer Company once, but unless it becomes more affordable I likely won't buy it again.  Which is a shame because they make excellent product."
""
""
""
""
"It's deep, it's rich, it's complex, but it has the lighter body and bite of a pale ale compared to an IPA. It holds a great mix of hop notes with spicy and biting dry bitterness topped with floral and tropical fruit juice plus a citrus punch. It's just impressive how much variety of hop flavors this beer covers. Go enjoy a bottle, even for a pale ale, it's a sipper."
""
""
""
"Big head.  Somewhat hoppy and light-bodied for the style, which is to my liking.  The hop flavors are complex and forward without being too bitter.  Finishes dry."

"Light-bodied with a perfect pale ale punch, but remember it's only play fighting here, which isn't a bad thing, because nobody likes being knocked out all the time."
"Served in a pilsner glass.  This beer is right up my alley.  Very drinkable, clean and crisp.  It lives up to it's wine like bottling and packaging.  The color is almost champagne like and I think it would pair with many foods.  My only hesitation about this beer is that in it might not have a strong enough taste for a beer drinkers on this forum, but I really enjoyed it."
""
"Overall: This is a better version of SN Pale Ale, its also more expensive. I have not had any of the bigger more popular Maine ales, but if this is any indication, its a solid brewery and one I would like to try more offerings from!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very impressive Pale Ale. Has many shared characteristics to beers like the Chainbreaker, but arguably, better. This is one of the best Pale Ales I've had in a long time. Tassstyyyyyeeehh!"
""
"Pours a pale golden color with a white head.  The aroma is herbal, grassy, piney and a bit dank.  The taste is earthy, dirty, hoppy, and pretty delicious.  A nice slightly toasty malt character adds a nice depth of vague sweetness.  Dusty yeast and dry and smooth.  Very nice."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium, slightly chewy. Overall, this is a great pale ale."

""

""
""
""
""
"5 month old bottle; still solid. Probably better fresh"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Perfectly on point carbonation (medium) and a solid medium body that is a little thicker than you'd expect from a pale ale (albeit one higher in ABV than APA normally weighs in at. The dryness in the finish is exquisite."

"I can't think of a more appealing pale ale than this one. Beautiful translucent orange color, lovely citrus nose, crisp and very pleasantly drying on the tongue. Malts are very subdued both in flavor and aroma, but in a good way. Maine Brewing really knows what they're doing, and I applaud their restraint as far as not trying to make every imaginable style of beer. Drink this pale ale fresh!"
""
""
""
""

"Picked up two single bottles dated 10-28. Have had this beer several times but just now appreciating how damn good it is when super fresh. Subtle, delicate, nuanced and many other adjectives that escape my buzzed brain at the moment ( just killed the second one). Still don't love their prices but this is super high end APA!"
""
""
""
"O: about near as perfect so you get for a lower ABV pale ale, very clean dry orange on the tongue and very light in the mouth it looks great, it smells great, it tastes great find if drink it.  Beware of bottle dates at two months this beer is shockingly bland on citrus, falls off quick. Under a month you will just sit there dumbfounded."

"My favorite pale ale by far!"
"These guys certainly know how to brew.  Northern New England is really experiencing a brewing renaissance after decades of buttery ringwood sameness.  Two thumbs up."

"This might be my favorite American Pale Ale. Great Beer.. I love having this beer on tap and bottle is great as well. This beer has just the right amount of hops.. Nice and smooth..The percentage of alcohol at 6% is perfect ..if u haven't had this beer, try to get a hold of it"

"Probably the best APA in New England, or ever, really."
""
"I know something that is 6% abv isn’t an ideal session beer, but damn me if I don’t want to try! If I were to encounter this on-tap at one of my locals, I’d probably stick with it all night."
""
""
""
""
"...which is sad, because this is an every day pale ale.  This is a vision of what day to day fresh beer can be: delicate flavors masterfully put together.  A pleasure to drink, provided it's fresh and plentiful.  I'm not chasing the delivery truck around to get a chance to taste this, but I'm loving the hell out of the fresh bottle I lucked into.  Why not just sell every drop of this fast, fresh, local?"
""
"A great pale ale with understated malts and an assertive hoppiness. This is really ""well made"" and definitely tasty, but as with other Maine beers I feel like it could be a bit bolder. I know, I'm quibbling. It is great."

"Bought at Beverage Baron in Barre, VT, dated 7/26. Hazy orange as I've come to expect from any decent IPA. It has a huge citrusy smell that hit me as soon as I opened the bottle. The taste followed albiet a hair more bitter then I was expecting. If it was just a *bit* more balanced (less bitter) it could be as good as Lawson's Sip of Sunshine. It was bright, sunny, citrusy with a dry finish that wants to be followed with more. It says 6% but it packed a pretty good punch, too...perhaps because it goes down so easily. Cheers!"

"DAMN! Ok so this is the best APA I've ever had. Maine brewing always kills it, but this time it's ridiculous. This is on par if not better than Three Floyds Zombie Dust, actually screw it this is better. Great hoppy taste with an awesome citrus afternote, grapefruit or tangerine can't really tell. 95 is good but sorely under-rated for this beer, just go get it and you'll agree with me. Again, DAMN!!"
""
""
"Overall: better than the other pale ales I have had from Maine Beer but still fair from my list of top pale ales. the taste come off with too much earthiness, along with a hop profile that just doesn't do it for me. That said it is refreshing as a pale ale should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Maine Beer Company again with some of the best hoppy beers around."
""
""
""
""

"Big bright orange hue, big white head, and huge thick lacing down the glass. Big citrus nose, orange dominated, slightly tropical. Taste starts off with some biscuit notes, grapefruit and orange through mid palate and finishes bitter and piney. Big bright explosion of carbonation, medium body, and slightly dry finish. Classic American pale ale and one of the best."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: MO is a beer to seek out, savor, and enjoy. A perfectly executed, complex, flavorful ale with moderate alcohol. The real deal."
""
""
""

"Overall a good brew, but I will not be purchasing more Maine Beer Company beers unless the prices in my area come down. $7.99 for a 16.9 oz bottle is highway robbery. I can get a sixer of Sierra Nevada for the same price and this really doesn't taste any better."
"o. This was an excellent APA that was a bit pine heavy in the profile but so well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is mostly golden in color and pours with a thin lacey head with a mild dank, hoppy flavor. As with most Maine Beer Co. beers, the fresher the better, so be mindful of the stamped-on production date. After 90 days the quality does suffer, and that would certainly be a waste of an extremely well crafted ale. Cheers!"

"O: I look at a lot of these reviews and the one thing I can say is complaining about the price is SUCH a cop out for giving a beer this good a low grade. This beer is not meant to be bought by the dozen and sessioned all night long, its 7$ a bottle (thats the equivalent of some cheep wine) buy the beer and enjoy it."

"Combines a very fragrant hop aroma with a complex flavour and a highly sessionable profile, I could drink this all night with no complaints. Taste has lots of complexies, smooth green fruits, citrus, and florals with pine and earthy undertones. Carbonation felt on the low side but it really helped the hops come through. Comes highly recommended. Delightful beer and shows excellent character as it warms."

"thanks to my bro John for sharing the spoils of his travels. highly reccomend."

""

"Super drinkable and a great clean mouth feel. Not overly hoppy and not the typical tropical fruit bomb every other brewery is pushing out these days. At around 6% ABV you can have a few and not be disturbing the neighbors. Enjoyed this one sitting by the campfire on a cool night. I recommend you do the same."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another fantastic offering from MBC. Would never hesitate to try an offering from these guys. Seek it out."
""

"Poured a cloudy gold body (maybe orange) with slow dying one finger head and lace all down glass. A wonderfully wet, citric hop aroma with touches of sweetness. Smooth, slightly grainy with something akin to crackers for a dryness that passes the tongue on each sip. Flavors are bitter yet juicy hops and there are some tropical fruits and a touch of sugary sweetness but for most part this is a hoppy, dry beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an awesome APA, one of the best I have had. Very west-coast, even more so than a lot of west-coast beers. I would recommend this to any hophead looking for a fix."

"very flavorful. very hoppy, in a pine and grapefruit way. nice mellow brew. very nice. a little bit of the simcoe/cat pee in the smell but it's not bad. the flavor imparts the same, but it's not bad. not getting the sweet aroma I first had in the taste and that aroma has long since subsided.. Lemon!"

"Although the packaging might not be the most eye-catching or engaging, but within is a great beer. A light gold color with a thin head yet the smell was fantastic with hop and citrus notes in the nose. The taste was even better with well defined notes of hop through out with great flavors of lemon peel, banana, and I tasted notes of elderberry although those I was with said they didn't agree. One of my favorite kinds of beer, simple yet excellently crafted. It was a little thin for me but I thought this beer was great and would definitely recommend."

"A very recent arrival to mercurial Calgary in April, four beers from this Maine brewery have appeared in my fridge thanks to a heads-up from my favorite neighborhood beer dealer wordemupg. Cheers brother. This is only round one and frankly things might have already plateaued based on how f'ing tasty this pale ale is. A somewhat cloudy yellow with orange and red tints, featuring a lively pour with a soapy white head managing to fill much of my shaker pint glass. Phenomenal head retention, stuff sits there like a milkshake. Aroma is sweet, fruity, and redolent with a hoppy spice. I get lychee and white grape, mango, orange, faint pineapple, kind of a gummy worms effect presumably from the crystal malts. An absolutely masterpiece on the palate, with uber-clean yeast, pine, grapefruit rind, peaches, and some weedy and catty notes all in a well-integrated interplay. Bitter but very clean, faint onion and pepper apparent from the IPA-level hopping regime but with nothing sticking out in an unpleasant fashion. Toasty caramel malts provide the backbone and the finish is leafy and a tad woody, with more citrus rind and tropical ghost notes lingering until the end. This could be the best American pale ale I've had to date, a hop-centric brew but with sublime malt balance and nary a flaw to be found."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as APA's go, this is perfect. Appearance is a hazy khaki orange. Smells amazing, big time citrus- orange peel and lemon in particular... a bit of pineapple as well. Taste is slightly hop forward and heavy on the citrus, but mellow and refreshing enough to remind you that this isn't an IPA. My new favorite pale ale, and it isn't close."

"Nice gold body, bit cloudy with awesome lacing. Smell is real nice, grassy floral and hoppy. Lush citrus fruit in the flavor, really explodes in the palate. Very creamy, strong body. Nice balance of sweet fruit and citrus bitterness. A real winner!"
"A very well rendered American pale ale, the hops definitely in charge, but they don't abuse the power - they're much more about the flavour, than any bitterness chip on their collective shoulders. Pretty tasty - other than the high-end single serving price around here, I could see enjoying a number of these in a single sitting. I know - a 'session' with a 6% ABV brew - blasphemy!"

"Served on tap at Miller's Pub. Pours a orangeish gold with slight haze. White head forms and retains a collar. Some lacing present. The nose is heavenly, loads of tropical notes, mango flesh, peach, and pineapple. This is backed by some pine and resin as well as mild malty notes. The taste is hop forward with moderate bitterness and an emphasis on tropical fruits. There is not much body or malt backbone, which works to make this brew light, refreshing, and full of flavor! High carbonation. Overall, a very well crafted pale with an excellent hop profile. Check it out!!"

"O: a thoroughly enjoyable beer from a great brewer. No match for some of their other brews, but I would offer this as a decent entry APA to a new craft drinker to see if they appreciate the smell and fruity/floral tastes that are present in many IPAs that pack a more bitter punch (if I felt they were worth the cost)"

"Bought most of the beers that Maine Beer Co. was offering this past Fall with plans to do a tasting with six of my BA Buddies. But I wound up drinking them all with a couple of my beer buddies who attended my annual New Year's Party. Tasted Peeper Ale, Another One, Zoe, Mean Ole Tom, King Titus, Lil One, Lunch and MO. Lunch and Mo were two of the eight Maine Beer Co. beers that I was really looking forward to tasting. MO did not dis-appoint me in any way. Outstanding is where I rated it and it was all of that."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazey golden color with a couple fingers of thick sudzy head and leaves breat lacing as it falls. MO has a great hop blast of a nose, with lots of citrus (grapefruit) and other tropical fruit, pine resin and some floral notes. The taste follows suite and this APA drinks almost like an IPA with big juicy fruit, pine and spicy hop notes but with a nice bready malt backbone with a clean, dry finish. The body is full but light on the palate and there is plenty of carbonation making MO light and refreshing. Really well done!"

"A slightly hazy copper body with an inch of white head. The head fades leaving behind tons of lacing. Reeks of citrusy hops. Awesome. Crisp and refreshing with malt and hops in near perfect balance. An awesome brew. The only problem with the Maine Beers is that they aren't cheap and they run in and out of availability. But thats what happens when you make something special in a finite amount."

"Damn nice balance is struck here by Maine. The hops are super fresh and fairly pungent but it all rounds out in the end. This is what hoppier APAs should be like, great hop flavors with balance at the same time. It is not a mini-IPA in my opinion, just a great Pale Ale."

""
"Different kind of Pale Ale as it behaves like spritzy soda water but with strong hoppiness. The hops are light and earthy with pine, rose petal, flower, spring like airy tastes with an easy caramel malt sweetness. Quenching and easy this is different but delicious."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma, and following flavor. The nose, right from the start, gave freshness and cleanliness that is hard to come by. Although the taste rushes in rather abruptly, it too gave a spice and ease of sip that followed rather well. This is the last of the Maine Beer Company “heavy hitters” for us to sample, and it was certainly no disappointment. Compared to Lunch and Zoe, however, we did find this guy to sip back a bit easier, and flow a touch lighter. While this can be attributable to stylistic differences, it detracts nothing from the overall sentiment of flavor and forward punch this beer has to offer. This is a fantastic beer, and one of their best, most consistently drinkable to date."

"Atmosphere is really nice. Great persistent head, and some very persistent lacing. Nose is hoppy with a slight balance of sweet resin. Hoppy bitterness rules the day. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
"Pours a large frothy head cresting around three fingers of eggshell white foam, very whipped up and airy, lots of dimpling across the surface, the retention is so-so, the lacing is comprised of a few razor thin but very long streaks. The liquid is a pleasing light orange with a mild metallic sheen, quite clear and pretty, slight yellowing at the rims, plenty of fat bubbles, no beads, all randomly dispersed. The nose has a certain purity to it, milled grains, sour mixed white citrus, spoonful of honey, pine cone, not very sappy, minimal herbaceousness, soft cocoa maltiness, needs to warm to really release the peach, yellow apple, apricot fruit scents. Full-bodied, in fact a little too broad shouldered as it tends to progress slowly through the palate. Here it’s much more floral and the white to pink grapefruit and orange citrus a bigger overall element. The fluffy carbonation helps relieve some weight and create lift and mouth perfume. The sweetness of the apricot, peach, pear fruit takes hold with force. Some peppery notes but the graininess lost a bit. Otherwise, does a good job of masking the total sweetness and making it a blended experience versus bunch of soloists jockeying for position."

"Overall - I could drink this by the pint any afternoon. Doesn't ever really live up to its own aroma, but it's still excellent."

"O - This is a nice Pale Ale, but I expected it to be a little better. I think it would be better if it was fresher (bottle date was 10-22-13). I'll update my rating if need be. Prost!"

"O - I like the smell a lot, and the taste is pretty mild. I like that it is not very bitter, but the piney taste is pretty strong. I am not sure that it is a flavor I would seek out, but it is pretty good if you like piney taste without the bitter (which seems a bit unusual)."

"Got this bottle from Bay Ridge in Annapolis. Well past it’s prime most likely with a 7/3/13 born on date, drinking 1/4/14. The Maine Beer stuff was this old everywhere I went in MD while visiting so I figured I would take a chance anyway. Pours a slightly hazy apricot color with a massive fluffy white head on top. Aroma of zesty, earthy hops alongside some citrus and a big sweet toffee/caramel malt bill. Just smelling this I have to assume it isn’t fresh enough to enjoy as intended so I’ll tick for now and rerate another time with a fresh one. Flavor begins with some light grass, a good bit of lemon zest, grapefruit, and ending with some sweet toffee. Even with this age the beer is light and zesty on the palate. I will have to try this fresh because it must be glorious. Hops are a bit on the stale side and the malt bill is taking over a bit. Goes down easy with medium high carbonation. Nicely crafted beer. Now someone trade me a fresh one."
""
""
""
"NYE bottle share at Proof courtesy of Masterson. Pours a nice, slightly hazy yellow orange. Healthy amount of white head with a very thick collar; both of which lasted pretty dang well. Aroma is floral, slightly sweet malt, good amount of sweet citrus. Medium-light body and same carbonation. Taste is overly floral, some pine, again with the citrusy hops. The balance in the nose is not there on the tongue."

"500 ml bottle into pint glass, bottled on 10/22/2013. Pours moderately hazy golden orange color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and rocky off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts the entire glass. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pineapple, peach, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, floral, grass, light honey, light caramel, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with huge hop complexity and a fair amount of malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big pineapple, tangerine, orange peel, peach, grapefruit, lemon zest, floral, grass, pine, light honey, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Good amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, peach, orange peel, lemon zest, floral grass, light pine, light honey, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of bright juicy hop flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic pale ale! All around awesome complexity and balance of bright hop and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: Super pysch-ed this beer has come to Chicago. My best friend has a great trading partner who lives in Maine, so I've had a few Maine Bee Co brews and they have all been SOLID. I love clear date stamping on the bottle and the additional recommendation of number of days to best enough the beer by. Purchased on 11/2, bot said drink within 32-days of 10/22. Everything is correct with this pale ale. Love the flavors of citrus and pine, with the additional notes of spice and/or herbal and/or floral. The 6% abv is perfect and in the right portion with a 17-oz bottle. And it's a clean and refreshing beer to drink. I know this statement might be challenging, but I had a fresh Pliny the Elder a week ago, and I think the brews from Maine BC are on par with the WC powerhouse."

"Bottled on 7/30/2013, consumed about 95 days after... a bit beyond the recommended time frame. Regardless, I can't find a single flaw with this bitter, exotic fruit flavored pale ale. Absolutely love it!!! Will definitely try it again when I can find it fresher!"
""

"Pours a hazy honey orange color with a finger and a half white head. Great head retention that leaves a thin blanket of lacing. Good amount of carbonation coming off the glass. Smells of more citrus fruits up front like grapefruit and orange. Then beneath that there are some tropical fruits like pineapple and mango, as well as a tiny hint of pine and floral. The malt imparts a sweet breadiness note that makes the fruit aromas seem more juicier. Taste is outstanding. Reminds me of a Hill Farmstead beer. Starts with hefty doses of bitter grapefruit and orange notes. The the middle brings a crackery, bready, sweet malt presence that balances quite nice with the increasing bitter, yet juicy grapefruit. Also starting to get tropical fruit notes as well. The finish brings more juicy tropical fruit notes like pineapple. Also getting more juicy grapefruit and a good amount of pine. Definitely detect the red wheat on the finish as well. Getting almost like a bubblegum flavor. Bitter, but not as aggressive as you might expect. In-your-face, yet delicate from the balance of malt and hops, as well as the clean finish. Medium body with a creamy and oily mouthfeel. The carbonation is perfect, as it refreshes the beer and cleanses the palate, which makes you want to take another sip. I’ve had a lot of amazing pale ales, and this one is right up there with those. Glad they are in Chicago now."
""
"D - A very nice pale ale. Really dig the 500ml format too, as it's the perfect amount for one serving of this brew. Really drinkable, as the alcohol and bitterness is held in check. It's really nice to see this brewery distributing to Chicago."
""
""
"O: No singular element of this blows the mind, but in the same way that Lunch or Sculpin work, continuing to drink it will reveal a very elegant, refined example of a style that's mainly reliant on brute force. Still, this is a LOT of money for a simple pale ale, even one as good as this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a well balanced fresh APA that I would definitely have again"
"Overall this is an outstanding Pale Ale, love how much hop character it has without being too bitter. This is the first beer from Maine Beer Co to land in IL, I can't wait to get my hands on Lunch. I'm a big fan of this format ( 16.9 oz / ~500ml) as opposed to bombers, although not a big fan of the price point ($6.99) but I can appreciate they are a member of 1% for the planet."

"Clear, brilliant gold topped with a huge, lumpy white head of thick froth. Sheets of lacing. Big fruity hop aromas burst from the glass: zesty grapefruit, pineapple, and pine resin over a little sugar cookie malt. Very hoppy and fresh flavor like a pale ale should have. Much like Peeper, things start out oily...juicy, zesty grapefruit, flowery hops, resin. Great APA flavor...ultra drinkable. Soft yet crisp. One little bottle to split with my wife is not enough. :-("
"Color is pale gold, and a little tangerine orange. Head is bright white and foamy. Nice splotchy lace and good head retention. Aroma is loaded with juicy grapefruit. Some pine, flowers, leaves, and generally tropical. Like peeper, a mouthwatering aroma, but bigger. Taste is fruity, tropical, zesty, grapefruity, piney, and a weeee bit herbal. Mmmm. Texture is gritty-like/resiny mixed in slickness. Really good stuff."

"O: Overall it was a very nice pale ale. It wasn't very complex or anything, but it was a good tasting beer that was enjoyable to drink. In the Pale Ale realm this one felt on the lighter side of both bitterness and body. I would have liked to taste some of the malt in there, but it was still a very enjoyable beer to drink."

"Served in a 16oz pint glass at the Pourhouse, Westmont NJ"

"MO isn't as complex or enjoyable as Lunch but with that said its still a really well made IPA. The grapefruit is large and in-charge while the tight grassy bitterness is something I don't come across very often in IPAs. If you're looking for something bitter and easy drinking get you some MO!"
"Overall, clean and crisp, pretty much what I expected, if a bit dry. Maine has a good setup, look forward to trying more in the future, cheers."

"Overall: This bottle is a couple of months old and, from reading the other reviews, I suspect the hop profile on this one fades rather quickly; a very nice beer but I am not digging it like some others who conceivably had a fresher example"
""
"Pours into a standard pint a dull medium golden with a large blooming white head,maybe a little over carbonation issue.Juicy grapefruit in the nose with a little grassiness as well,not much malt profile just juicy hops.Maybe the best hop profile of any ""standard"" pale I have had flavor-wise,fresh grapefruit and grassy flavors with a dryer base making for just hoppy goodness.A tad sharp in the mouth but man this is just a hopped up flavor punch of an APA.Wow."

"MO will become a summer staple for me for as long as Maine Beer Company continues to send it my direction."
""
"The beer is golden to yellow with a mild haze and a huge, white, frothy head. The aroma brings some zesty citrus, floral notes, pine, a light sweetness. Hop forward and refreshing. Light in body with moderate carbonation. Big floral and citrus notes. Oranges and lemons with a touch of bitter pine, finishing dry. A wonderful pale ale. My only complaint is that it's $6.99 per 500 mL bottle, when a beer of this ilk should be $9-12 per sixer. For that reason alone, I won't be revisiting this one, as tasty as it is."
""
""
"Nice pale ale but I don't think I'll seek this one out as I don't enjoy it that much more than pale ales that are more accessible to me. Great extra, thanks buddy!"

"T: Slightly bitter, hoppy and all that good stuff. Tastes a lot like a refined ipa rather than a pale ale. I also detect some qualities that I cant quite put my finger on that are usually common in DIPAs. And at only 6% and easily sessionable, I'm in heaven. Regardless of ABV, this is a gem. Anything above 93 rating on BA usually is. Do try it if you have a chance. As I'm finishing this glass a waitress brought another beer along the same style to sample. I can already tell this is going to be a bumpy ride."
"Thick rich body for a pale ale. Good carbonation, a little sticky but the medium plays it down a bit in a good way for balance. Citrus peels with a faint touch of tobacco. Earthy meets bright citrus fruits with a solid sweet malt backbone throughout. Simple and subtle yet packed with flavor, slowly building bitterness but balanced by a lingering malt sweetness, quite the pale ale. But like everything else Maine, it's just a tease, a beer is rather have in a 6. I'd even pay stone 4 pack prices for their stuff."
""
""
"O - Decent Pale Ale. Had high expectations, but was mostly disappointed in the end."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with a thick white head that has some staying power. Lots of lacing. Very citrusy on the nose, redolent of grapefruit and tangerines. Mild sweet malt notes in background. Subtle sweetness with some citrusy hops hit the palate first followed by some bitterness. Finishes bitter, but not overly so. Malty sweetness provides the right amount of balance. Smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Overall, a well crafted, balanced Pale Ale that is almost hoppy enough to be an IPA. Another great beer from Maine."

"O: An outstanding American Pale that is almost nothing but a showcase for strong citrus hops aromas and flavors with a very enjoyable grapefruit character."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled on 7/09/13. Pours a dark yellow with a sticky, white, billowy head, that leaves behind amazing lace. Smell is tangerine, mango, pineapple, and earthy hops. Taste is all about citrus and a little grapefruit in the finish that lingers a bit. Body Is medium for the style, nice amount of life, a little dry, and great drinkability. Very nice beer, as you would expect from this company."

"Resiny taste and great lacing, the malt and body here is very nice, and belies its relatively light color, biscuity and a bit chewy. Perfect carbonation level, coats the palate, hype be damned, this backs it up, better than expected. I'm going to shut up and enjoy the rest."

"even better than lunch, this is one of the best beers made in maine as far as I am concerned. it pours a hazy straw color with an orange glow. the head isn't much, white and airy, but not lasting real long. the nose is like fresh pineapple juice, not bitter at all, real tropical and real fresh, reminds me of hill farmstead or lawsons stuff, east coast and hoppy, but more than high alcohol oily dankness, its insane how good this is. a veritable fruit punch of hop flavors, lemon and grapefruit too. I love the intensity of it, while staying not too bitter. jazzy carbonation, clean finish and feel, as good as any American pale on the market I think. the lightness is what impresses me most. I could drink this forever, and my 10 ounce pour just isn't enough! all beers on at maine beer company were tasty, great examples of their respective styles, but this to me was the pick of the litter. already looking forward to my next one, whenever I may be so lucky. a true gem."

"A very hoppy nose and great beer. It was a very welcomed surprise as we do not get many Maine beers down this way! It held up well to other beers as well as I had just come from an IPA tasting. This beer vanquished the ones I had just tried and set up shop on my palate!"

"The taste also had a good hop flavor although the roasted malts were a but more forward in the taste than on the nose. Hop bitterness at the finish."

"O- A nice pale ale. Hoppy, but balanced."
"22 oz bottle. Pours hazy-golden with long lasting foamy head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, biscuit malt and orange marmalade. Body is medium and tangy. Citrusy, floral hops, biscuit malt, yeast and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long and bitter. Delicious brew."

I absolutely would've brought more than one bottle home from that Total Wine in Fair Fax, Virginia; only, they didn't have more than one. Here's hoping I stumble upon a bounty of this particular brew. For someone who is not big on American Pale Ales, I'd stock the fridge with this all summer. I couldn't imagine getting sick of this."

"Overall: This is only the second beer I've tried from Maine Beer Company and it definitely doesn't live up to the hype for me. It was ok, but definitely not something I'll rush to try again. I'll take SNPA over this all day."
"500ml bottle: This one pours a crystal clear golden color. There was a rather large fizzy head on it that lingered a bit and left some lacing. It has a nice nose: a lot is going on there. Get some apricot, spices, pine notes as the main players. The taste is very good. Just a hint of the apricot, and a bit of bitterness. Hints of citrus and pine. Good malt body behind it, with no sweetness coming through. Glad to see their beers making it past the borders now!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly hazes faint apricot colored with a firm head of tight foam that lingers long and settles out slowly. Inviting aroma of citrus and honey, some pine. Flavor matches the nose, very citrusy, full of tangerine and melon, hints of mint, sappy pine, grapefruit rind and honey. Finishes dry, pine and orange rind itch lingers. Great beer, pretty hoppy for a pale ale."

"Pours a nice straw color, a bit hazy with a solid head. Great looking beer! The smell is not even close to over powering, but it's nice; just a light, citrusy hop smell; classic american pale ale. The taste is nice too, but the citrusy side of the hops is muted a bit and instead you get more bitterness that I would expect in a beer of this style. Still, it's a great tasting beer. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but fine. All in all, a very nice apa. It actually reminds me of Founders All Day, but it's more bitter, has less hop aroma and taste, and it costs about 3 times as much. That's why, even though I'd be happy to drink this beer again, I probably won't."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and floral aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and grapefruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some very nice citrus aromas and flavors."
""

"Nice honey colored ale with a solid, persistent quilt of soapy whites atop. Nose is pretty simple, some resin, some pine, some grapfruit pith, and light english malting. Taste follows suite with some decent bitterness, a good resiny, piney, PNW-ey character and a sweet tea malt backbone. Tastes more English aggressive than APA to me, but I dig. Medium bodied with fluffy carb and an off dry finish. Not sure what the price is on this, but on tap at average prices, I'd probably slam a good several annually (with one night probably being pretty top heavy)"
""
""
"Poured cloudy lemony orange with a frothy head of soft foam that would not go away. Fell to some crags and great lace. Nose was pine, sweet citrus, tangerine, candy sugar, toffee malt, and a little pepper. A little soap too. Taste was juicy citrus. Grapefruit rinds and pithy lemon, a tad astringent, and peppery. Nutty toasted malt and finished with lots of floral, dry and bitter and somewhat thin. It was worth trying and I liked it but not as much as everyone else."

"Tap: Poured a light hazy amber color ale with a small foamy head with good retention. Aroma consists of citrus notes with some floral hoppy notes also perceptible. Taste is also dominated by some citrus notes with some floral hoppy notes and some citrus notes with lightly sweet non-descript malt base. Body is about average with good carbonation. I really like the take on this one with nice floral aroma notes and limited bitterness."

"Overall: Drinkability is great on this one. A nice, light APA to drink as the day cools off. The nose smells like a fruit salad and the citrus hops are a real thirst quencher. However, the hops aren't too heavy handed and the malt backs them up quite nicely. This is one to go after this summer."

"Overall (4.0): This is a very solid pale ale, though I admit I was expecting something much more lush and juicy—but what’s in the glass is crisp, grassy, dry, refreshing, and very enjoyable. The aroma is fantastic, and to be honest that’s what I was expecting from the palate, but at least with this bottle that’s not the case. But y’know what? Still pretty tasty."

"On tap. Pours a burnt golden orange in the glass with a ½ finger of bright-white head. This stay smooth and creamy looking, leaving back a robust smattering of lacing behind. Smells fresh and floral with a little dankness and pine mixed in. Lot of juicy tropical fruit notes. Taste has a zesty grapefruit bitterness with a resinous finish. Sticky notes of fruit, herbal flavors and neutral malt sweetness do a tremendous job of balancing and adding extra flavor to this. The mouthfeel is medium with a firm and sharp feel in the mouth which is undercut by just the right amount of creaminess. This was really nice. An APA with a good bit of aggressive to it yet was still extremely well balanced, with those tropical passion fruit flavors in particular really standing out. Well worth checking out."

"I have to give this beer high drinkability marks because its light bodied, easily drinkable, and filled with great flavors. I got this beer in a trade so I'm not quite sure of the price. Would I drink it again? I sure would! This is my second Maine Beer Co. beer and I've been very impressed with both of them. The ones I had make me want to try their other offerings."
"I like the beer and its the fresh hops. This is what this beer is about. Like many other american beers it focuses too much on the great hops this country produces and forgets about balance or modesty. Learn from the Belgiums! 3.75"

"Looks good on the pour. Nice citrus nose. Good punch on the mouth, in a refined way. That's how I would define this beer: refined. It's not overdoing it just for the sake of things. Carbonation is a bit much and biting. But overall a very nice drinker."

"O- At first, the nose made me think of American IPA, but it is truly a properly amped-up APA."

"There is some very good balance in this easy drinking brew. I recommend this to pair with many other beers. Maine Beer puts out many quality brews... this is definitely among them."
"O - Overall a 6% pale ale, I guess some would consider it an IPA. The balance, light body, and drinkablility definitely say pale ale and a damn good one. One of the best I've had."

"Overall (4.75): One of the best Pale Ales I've ever had but it's really more of an IPA. Still really good under that style. Not much to detract from this one. Gotta pick this one up if you haven't yet - not sure what took me so long. Well worth the steep price tag."

"Very dry, aromatic, and refreshing, this would be an ideal APA for the summer months. Looking forward to trying more beers from Maine Beer Company."

"4 week old bottle from Wineworks. Aroma is fresh pine, grass, and a lemon zest. Pours opaque and golden with a huge foamy head. Taste is delightful with citrus notes, grass and a slight pine underneath. Mouthfeel was a little muddled and busy but the hops shine through. Overall, this was wonderful and tasty. Love it."
"Taste is similar. Very cleans refreshing, but with a very complex hop favor. Begins with a resinous quality and turns over to grapefruit and orange peel. The malt is not complex, but provides a wonderful bread like background tying it all together. Very drinkable on the lighter side of medium bodied yet a creamy impression. Very enjoyable and much appreciated beer."
"O - A spectacular Pale Ale, it emphasizes what an APA should. It's isn't so intense that you think it should be an IPA (Like Dale's can be some times) and it is perfectly balanced and very drinkable. Worth seeking out, no question. Man does this do down easy. Really need to find me some Lunch."

"I love everything about this beer. The label, the way it looks, the way it tastes... This is an expertly crafted pale ale. A bit of a larger malt backbone could really give this beer some incredible balance and bump it up to world class, but this was meant to be a hoppy beer and Maine Beer Co. has succeeded in creating such. I could drink this every day."

"o - Overall I thought this was a good beer, but like all Maine Beer Co. beers, make sure you check the bottled daye before buying their stuff in NYC or it might be months old. This one holds up much better than 2-3 month old bottles of Peeper and Zoe, but I get the feeling this could be great if you got it super fresh. Still a lot of nice fruit and citrus and something I'd certainly revisit if I saw a fresh bottle/it on tap."
"A fairly easy to drink beer but I think their Peeper Ale is the better of the two. My main problem with MO is that the flavor comes on too strongly."
""
""
""
""
"O - An easy drinking pale ale that was crafted right."
""
"Overall: Easy to drink. A good american pale ale. Tone down the lemon/citrus aroma and flavor just a slight bit and this beer would be excellent."
"From the simplistic label, to the smell, all the way to the last drop. This is a wonderful experience. I think this beer will become a legend. People will find out about it, and make this a Mecca for beer drinkers. Great beer. Thanks again to Crabbicus for this!"

"O: A very nice, well-constructed APA. Easy drinker."
""
"[O] What a fantastic pale ale. But...I wouldn't expect anything less from such a solid brewery."
"a great pale ale. this is my first offering from this brewery and damn well worth the wait. seems like a very basic recipe but is perfectly executed. no off flavors, everything tastes extremely fresh."
""
""
""
""
"O: A fine, very tasty and balanced pale ale. The aroma suggests more of a hop presence than the taste delivers, but it's still quite good."
""
""
"Got this as an extra from a generous BA. Pours a very hazy, golden orange color. Large white head. I also see a lot of yeast at the bottom of this bottle. This bottle is definitely unfiltered and bottle-conditioned. Scent is...WOW! Blown away by this aroma...very reminiscent of the hoppy beers I'm familiar with in Santa Rosa. Awesome tropical aromas... I actually pick up mangos in this one, along with grapefruit, honeydew, pineapple, and orange peel. Not an ounce of maltiness. Does the east side know what they're doing now??? Taste is just as great. By far, one of the most flavorful and tasty Pale Ales...in the same family as Daisy Cutter, Row 2, Hoppy Birthday, Zombie Dust, and Happy Hops. The flavors are spot on from the nose. No overwhelming maltiness. Amazing hop flavors with the right amount of citrus, pine, and bitterness. I love when such a sessionable beer packs such a flavor punch. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, with a crisp, dry finish. Drinkability is crazy high. Overall, this is an outstanding beer. This is my first beer from this brewery, but I'm onto them. They're smart. They realize the success of Russian River, and they're using them as a model. Simple labels, 500ml bottles, emphasize the ""drink now"" aspect, and make the beer taste DAMN GOOD. Much respect for Maine Beer Company. I can't wait to try more beers from them, and will definitely be seeking this stuff out."

"Medium bodied with dry, sticky hop bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malts into a dry finish. There's a decent amount of tropical/citrus sweetness but it isn't as prominent as the nose suggests. More of an earthy/floral character than expected overpowering hints of pineapple, orange peel and grapefruit. Decent malt backbone but it doesn't hinder the hop flavors, giving off hints of biscuit and cracker. Well balanced, flavorful and easy to drink but could use a bit more sweetness for my taste."
""
""
""
"Pours orange bodied with a lasting bubbly off white head. Great smell, grapefruit and oranges. Smooth mouthfeel, great drinkability, creamy. Very tasty orange creamy good hoppyness. The proof is in the taste and this is an excellent American pale. From Capone's Restaurant."
"Add more pine, body, and aroma and you'll have something almost identical to Pliny the Elder."
"D: wow, this is some good shit. highly fruity, very drinkable. wouldnt hate more. a lot more."
"Pours a clear golden straw color with a huge white head that takes forever to recede and leaves lots of stickies on the side of the glass. Aromas of citrus fill the air as soon as I tilt the bottle toward the glass. Pine and resin with a hint of bread round out the nose quite nicely. The flavor is light bread, cracker and a hint of seltzer water with a nice pine and grapefruit flavor going on. There's a solid shot of bitterness in this one, I'm guessing because the body is a bit light to stand up to the massive hopping here. Moderate level of carbonation with a watery and resinous mouthfeel. This is a really nice pale ale, but I would have liked a bit more body especially with the heavy dose of hops in here."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with moderate carbonation. Very good beer overall. The hoppiness was really nice, especially the juicy tropical notes. Very easy drinking and flavorful beer. Great APA overall."
"O- A solid Pale Ale that is worth trying. Finally can buy MBC near me and can't wait to try more of their beers and be able to buy this again."
""
"Drink- Just a very good beer. Right on par with ZD and Hoppy Birthday in the hoppy pale ale category. Super refreshing. Would love more of this."
"The hops are a little clashy on the palate, there is simultaneously a strong fruity hoppy sense with this other pine hop flavors, they don't play well really well but it is still a good beer. I'd ditch the pine hops and just make a second pale ale with those hops. Beer is medium to light in body, moderately bitter at the back, a good beer, minimal malt character, no sweetness. I'd have this again. Especially on draft."
"O: A fine beer that I think is benefiting from the freshness -- under 3 weeks since bottling. Delicious with a lot of hops aroma and flavor with relatively low bitterness and ample maltiness to support the pleasant hoppiness. There is a fair amount of dry hopping with Amarillo, Centennial, and Simcoe I would guess by the bright nose and flavor. Great job Maine Beer. I like this one even better than Peeper which was also quite good. This is probably one of my top 5 APAs -- drinks very much like an Extra Pale Ale because it is very light but with more layered hoppiness."
""
""
""
"O - Way hopped up for a Pale Ale and I love it! The hop presence is something you would encounter in an IPA or with some higher alcohol beers. Lighter bodied, crisp, and at 6% I could drink these all day. Hop Heads, seek this one out."
"O- A really nice pale ale, very light and drinkable with some really nice hop flavors going on, so far I haven't had a single beer from Maine Beer Co that I haven't really enjoyed."
""
""
"O: Goes does easy, very tasty, not too filling, mild kick, nice representation of style. Perhaps a bit hoppier than typical APA's, though works really well for this beer."

"Overall, a great brew. Glad I finally opened this one."

"Medium-light body, medium carbonation, smooth feel. Drinks just about perfect for this style. Very impressive. These guys are doing excellent, really top-notch work."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation that is effervescent yet it is soft enough on the tongue to not distract and help move the flavors across the tongue. The 6% abv is very well integrated and overall this is a pretty solid pale ale. Again, I can only image that this brew is pretty awesome the fresher it is. Since this is the freshest I have been able to get one, I can only call it as it is. It is good and I would certainly drink it again if the opportunity arose. No questions asked if it was fresher than 3 months old of course."

"Overall: What a spectacular brew, Maine Beer Company needs to keep it up, all the beers from them so far have wowed me in being some of the best so far! Definatly will have this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Full frontal flavor bud assault from the hops but it cleans up just enough to keep from drying out the palate from the bitterness. Loaded with pine/citrus hops, more than enough to sate the hop fiend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent pale ale that is well worth checking out....fresh that is (if you read the bottle). It certainly shows but the carbonation bothers me. Then again, it could just be me and not the beer itself. Another solid offering from MBC!"
""
""
"o - a pretty nice beer overall, but i wish the taste and feel were on par with the smell. really, this seems to compete with most non-west coast ipas to me. worth buying if you come across it."
""
""
"Body sits a golden orange with a fluffy, off-white cap, with a good amount of clinging lace. Some small sip marks inside the glass. The aroma is of undercooked biscuits and light earth, with some tropical fruits over top. The hops seemed a little overpowered by the malt; like they are struggling for a little bit of the spotlight. On the palate, tropical fruits (pineapple, papaya, and mango) make a run early, before a sweeping rush of biscuity malt and soft earth. The finish is mildly bitter and lightly sweet from the tropical fruits. This is a nice APA. Well-balanced. Highly drinkable, and even though this is 6%, I could drink this all day."
""
"An incredible APA! Maine Beer Co. really knows what they're doing with their hoppy beers. This, along with Peeper, are some of the best examples of what a Pale Ale can be."
""
"Pours a very nice slightly hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, with a very nice one-finger plus white creamy head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, slight malt blend, citrus, and some pine notes. The taste is very nice hoppy, a little malts thrown in, nice citrus and slight pine note. Medium body, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Overall a very nice brew."
"O: Another job well done by Maine Beer Company. Some might find the $8 expensive for the bottle, but I find it well worth it. I think it's somewhat similar to the Peeper Ale and would like to do a tasting side by side to find those subtle differences. Pick this up if you can."
""
""
"O: it's a solid beer that is just not worth $5 for a 16.9 ounce bottle when Zombie Dust can be had for $10-12 for a six pack. Still, a good one-off buy, and recommended to try once for an interesting hop medley."
""
""
"The only knock on this beer was that it’s expensive (around $8 for a 16 oz bottle), but after the last sip it justified the price as this was an excellent beer. Maine Beer Company is 3 for 3 in my book, with all 3 beers that I’ve tried from this brewer have been excellent. A very high recommendation."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, bright, crystal clear yellow-gold coloring with a thin, sparse, bright white filmy coating on the surface. Aromas of resiny, bitter, pungent green hops with piney overtones. Smells delicious! Flavors are heavily roasted, with a bitter overtone that is undercut by a citrus and bready backbone. Both lemon zest and buttery biscuit support the heavy dose of hops character, that quickly gives way to an effervescent, light, crisp aftertaste. The flavors are so huge initially that it almost seems like it disappears on the backend. Clean, crisp finish makes this beer an incredibly easy drinker. Nicely put together, but a little abrupt on the ending."
"The beer pours a pale straw yellow color with a nice big creamy head that pusses down to a rocky finger’s width, leaving slight spots and clouds of sticky lacing. The beer is hazy and torrential with bubbles of carbonation racing up from the bottom of the glass. This beer smells fat and juicy. It is drizzling with citrus, mango, pine, and slight pineapple. There is a great buttery biscuit smell lying below the fruity hops and giving the beer a great body. This smell is very enticing. The beer tastes like a mellower version of the smell, but it’s a little disappointing. The initial sip dances with some of those wonderful hops but rushes away quickly and is replaced by vegetal bitters. The taste overall is bitter and average. There is a great bitter taste at the middle with a little stale biscuit taste that lasts in the mouth and reminds me of a bitter earthy hops. Mouthfeel is crisp and velvety, sitting quite nicely on the tongue and leaving the mouth with a nice skim of saliva and a little dry. The only problem is the earthy, almost vegetal bitter aftertaste that tingles through the mouth. Overall this is a pretty good APA that is hurt by its aftertaste. The smell is to die for and might be my new favorite smell, but the taste doesn’t quite follow up. This is another good offering from Maine Beer Company but my least favorite of the ones I’ve tried; to be fair I must admit that APA’s are not my favorite. This beer is definitely worth a try and smell and continues the excellence that this nano-brewery has developed."
""
"Very drinkable beer. I can see this pairing well with food, although I didn't here. My only beef is that...this seems very familiar. This beer is in a good high tier, but is very similar to others. I don't know if I could pick it out from some similar brew. It lacks that unique edge that makes you say -- that's a Maine Beer Co brew. I know I'm nitpicking. Overall, these brewers have put together another great beer. A real winner. Try this."
"Pours a dirty-water yellowish orange with an absolutely huge bright white head. Head sticks around and ""Peter Norths"" the glass on the way down. Aroma of fresh citrus hops and plenty of them, orange, lemon and grapefruit, also a nice sweet, subtle malt aroma. Very refreshing smell. This brewery never disappoints. Perfect, true to the style, hoppy pale ale. Nice range of hop flavors. Bursts of grapefruit, orange... nice lemongrass kick. Really mild pine notes and a nice sweet malt. No one huge flavor, but perfection. Perfect blend of flavors. Perfect cohesion. Very light, crisp, but packs a huge flavor punch while still being light. Grab a bunch of these and enjoy, great flavor, big drinkability!"
"16.9oz bottle with a bottled date of 081212. Pours a murky, cloudy orange color with an inch of fluffy white head. Some lacing. Fantastic whiff of sweet orange, grapefruit, and tropical fruits. The flavor is just as the aroma indicated. Sweet grapefruit and orange hop flavor followed by tropical fruits, mango and pineapple most nnotably. Nice bitterness. Slightly floral finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Overall, amazing Pale Ale. I hope to get my hands on more."

"One day these guys will brew a crappy beer. Until then, I'll continue to enjoy whatever they put into bottles. This one is a bit less prickly and spicy than their Peeper ale, but is no less refreshing. Enough hops to put it at the edge of my liking but also enough fruity orangey-lemony to make it worth my while. And the fizz! And the puffy white head! Take two-- they sell out quickly."
"Light body with a refreshing effervescence. Very easy to drink even if the abv is on the higher range for a pale ale. Another nice beer from Maine Beer Company."

"O: This beer has lots of hoppy aromas and flavors like an IPA but is very to drink since it is an APA."

"Ok overall but not the greatest, especially with some really nice pale ales being made out there these days."
"Overall: Really great APA and MBC continues to impress me. Seek out again for sure."
"Serving type: bottle"
"MO pours an opaque orange. It actually looks just like orange juice, but for the finger or so of white foam that's sitting atop the beer. There's both solid head retention and lacing. The nose is of dank, bitter grapefruit peel, an aroma a typically associate with Centennial hops. The flavor displays a brief bit of bready malts at the open, before a very snappy bitterness comes along. The close tastes of grapefruit peel, but also the pith, which ends up giving the beer a slightly unpleasant close. The body is a tad chewy, and the carbonation dull, but both are super close to being right on the money. MO is right at the upper end of the APA category, trending towards an IPA, and it's just an alright version of the style. I definitely prefer Peeper from MBC."
""
"overall a refreshing, flavorful, and very tasty pale ale. i could drink this all day. another hit from maine beer co, who continues to impress. my biggest criticism would be that they tend to be a bit on the pricey side."
"Overall: Maine Beer Company is all about fantastic bottle conditioned beers. MO and Zoe are without a doubt my favorites; honestly they are tied for 1st place. Lunch is pretty good too, but this APA definately beat out Lunch as the better beer in my opinion. I wish that Maine Beer Company was available to me as a local beer!"
"O - One of the best APAs I have had. Remarkably tropical with great balancing hops. This beer is sessionable and full of flavor. It's not Lunch, but it is very tasty. I will definitely pick this one up again."
""
""
""
""
"This definitely shares some qualities with Peeper and Lunch, but MO is clearly it's own beer. It's aggressively dry hopped yet not very bitter, and actually pretty mellow. I typically love this approach to the style, but MO has a few off-flavors. Regardless, it's still great."
""
"Taste, fractional crystal/caramel malt, solid hopping, not bracing bitterness, solid body, but not an in your face kind of way. Really good mouthfeel that doesn't get old, nice and delicate breadiness that is subtle, allowing the hops to come across. Minorly grassy and grapefruity. Pretty dry throughout. Another winner as far as I'm concerned from the Maine brewing company."
"O: Stands up against all PA's and most IPA's. Keep 'em comin' Maine Beer Company!"
""
""
""
"O: All in all, this is a good beer. I kind of expected more from this as Peeper, Zoe, and Lunch are amazing beers. This one is a little over-carbonated and I wish it had a little more body to it. It's a good beer, but a few tweaks away from being a great beer."
""
""
""
""
"A clear light amber color with lots of tiny bubbles racing skyward and a very healthy eggshell colored head and an undeniable wall of lacing. The aroma is a beautiful, delicate floral-citrus combo and a touch of biscuit...simple and classy. The flavor is a bit more bready but continues to offer a brisk, herbal citrus medley. Lemon and toasted grains, floral edges, perhaps a bit of oak. This is a solid but light bodied brew with a tingly, lively feel. Very enjoyable and highly drinkable. A picnic must!"

"Not quite as good as Zombie Dust, but remarkably close. Very impressive!"

"Bottle dated 2/23/12. Poured into a standard pint glass. Nice soapy white head on a dark sunset orange colored body. Lots of carbonation. Huge piney aroma of hops. Nice hop flavor balanced well with malt. Not overly assertive, which is what I like. Mouthfeel was nice, with just a slight hint of bitterness at the finish. A very nice beer; tasty and solidly built."
"Overall-- this is a wonderful warm weathre refresher beer with outstanding characteristics. Solid proof that a fine flavored beer does not have to be a flavor steam-roller, nor does it's ABV content have to be a flashing neon sign."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel nice and light, carbonation good. This is wonderfully complex for such an easy-drinking beer."
"O: not a bad beer, but nothing to scream about. Since the hops take center stage on this beer, I'm not exactly sure if this is really a pale ale. I'm just wondering if this is closer to an IPA. No worries, I would have this again."
"Taste is similar to the aroma, the grapefruit citruys hops taste the forefront, malt smooths things over a bit, decent bitterness, body is almost right, sadly I think all the carbonation disappeared in the head since it tastes almost flat like, I'll be more careful with the second half pour."
"Pours a bright glowing orange amber with light haze, prickly cap of white bubbles, decent lacing. Scent is huge whiffs of juicy tropical and citrus fruits such as mango, tangerine, pineapple, kiwi, lightly floral with sweet light malts. Taste follows suit bith big tropical and citrus notes, lightly sweet malts with faint residual sugar, lightly bitter. Only knock was the active and prickly carbonation, could be toned down a notch,medium bodied. Fantastic fruit notes that few pales or IPAs produce, an all around winner."
""

"Poured a hazy golden orange with a delicate white head; moderate retention and lacing. Aroma is hop-dominant, with scents of fresh citrus. More of the same in the taste, loads of fresh juicy citrus hops, floral notes, orange, passionfruit, light caramel sweetness. Light and crisp, medium body, very drinkable. Another MBC success."
"Medium body, well carbonated, dry and lingering on the tongue but super refreshing. This drinks superbly - not exactly the most complex thing out there, but a really well done, straight up, no frills pale ale."
"O: im mad at myself because i bout this beer about a month and a half ago and stuck it in the back of the fridge, i entirely forgot what it was and thought it was a stout so i just kinda kept letting it go, i wish i had drank it sooner so that it was even fresher, that being said it drinks quite nicely and has a nice taste, maine beer co has once again come through in my opinion"

"This is a far and away better pale ale than Peeper, seek this one out and you won't be sorry."
"Overall: Another really nice offering from Maine. Very well balanced and easy to drink. I would definitely have another."
"Very creamy taste...hoppy and malty. Well balanced and worth every penny. I love MBC. They have to be one of my fav brewers. They are consistantly good and this is no exception."

"Overall: Another solid offering from MBC in western Portland. Good to see that so many amazing brews are made at 5 breweries in such a small industrial area. Will be looking forward to more of this in the future."

"This was a hoppy, but not overly hoppy, beer. Very pleasant to drink."

"Overall this has a uniqueness about it that warrants a tasting. Definitely an enjoyable pale ale."
"O: a great pale ale overall, though definitely more of an IPA. Still, it smells great and tastes good as well."
""
"O: Just too dry for me. The malt bill seems emaciated."
""
""
"O: This is tasty. Hops could be a little more assertive in the taste but it's still refined."

"Smells awesome, big hops- citrus, pine, but mostly citrus. Nice dry malt cracker flavor to back up the bitter. This beer is awesome, might be my new fav pale ale."
"Overall not bad, def not their best beer so far. It's more like an amber than APA with the amount of malty flavors in it, esp the reddish toasty malts. THe hops aren't quite what I was expecting either, but all in all a decent tasty beer that is worth a try. I would like to try this again on tap and see if it changes, like Peeper did."

"Kinda makes me think of Lunch light."
"EDIT: I had another bottle of this just 1 month old anod it couldn't have been more bland and boring. The aroma was non existent and the flavor practically vanished at the first hint of any flavor. Highly dissapointing. I have to dock points for inconsistency. Too bad, because the first bottle was so good. I felt taken the second time around given the price."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice smooth finish. Overall, MBC has another top-notch hoppy beer with MO. Fills the slot nicely in between Peeper and Lunch."
"The nose carries some faint tropical fruits and a bit of citrus. Light mango. Just a touch of pale malt lingering in the background for some depth. The flavor has the same elements with a bit of orange peel sneaking in. Nice and light. Light body with crisp carbonation and a slightly-bitter dryness through the finish."
""
"Mo is a very tasty, fairly well balanced beer. Would make a great year round offering."
""
"O - Very good American pale ale. Nice and hoppy overall - full of hop flavor with a smooth bitterness. Fresh and crisp flavors - nothing overpowering...a hop lovers pale ale. Another winner from Maine Beer."
"A very light example of a pale ale, bordering on a lager with the impression it gives."
"Right off the bat, another solid Maine Beer Company beer. These guys know what the fuck they're doing Pours a brilliant, transparent gold hue with a nice two finger head with some decent lacing. The smell has a very lovely hop aroma with some stellar citrus and pine. The taste is just sublime. Seriously...MBC knows what it's doing. Excellent balance of all components across the board. The mouthfeel too is slick as hell. This could EASILY be a go to beer for me. I can't wait to see what else these guys have going on. This may be better than both Lunch AND Zoe, to me. Incredible."
"This is an excellent beer. With the amount of hops and 6% ABV this is borderline IPA territory. I suppose it's whatever the brewer calls it but if I had it blind I'd call it an IPA. Either way it's a great example of a clean, hoppy beer that could be a mess if it wasn't done properly."
""
"O - decent, but it smells better than it tastes. Extra points for local and 1% for the planet"

"Very good beer and maybe the best I've had from Maine so far. Very glad I got to try this."
"Overall, this was a great APA. I have been impressed 2 out of 2 times with this brewery. Their hoppy stuff is legit. Very flavorful and very drinkable. This is right up there with TH APAs for me."
""
"Taste is sweet pale malts to start, citrus in the middle, with ample pine through the close. Mouthfeel is so smooth, and drinkability is great. Price is somewhat prohibitive for an APA, but if I don't think about when I'm drinking, it's so good that it's all worth it."
""
"O: I don't know how Maine Beer keeps doing it, but they do. This is a borderline IPA but focused better on balance and drinkability. Flavors compliment each other wonderfully and makes this another great addition to their lineup. This one falls somewhere between Lunch and Peeper and fits in perfectly."
"O: Definitely recommend this one, too good to pass up for the price. I've had APA's twice the price that were a quarter as good, definitely a score for MBC."
" Well done Maine Beer Co."

"Overall, a really nicely balanced pale ale with some great citrus hop notes. The hops are really delicate and offer some great flavors and aromas. Another great beer from Maine Beer. It seems everything they is quality and top notch for the style, even if its just a pale ale."
""
"O - another fantastic offering from maine beer company. definitely up their with my favorites by them."
"O-a solid pale ale that compliments their line nicely"
""
""
""
"O: This is the third beer I've had from Maine Beer Co. and it's my favorite so far. Definitely seems like it'd be a great beer to drink in the nicer, warmer weather. Easy to drink and definitely one I'd pick up again."
"Great brew all around. Zoe is still the class of this brewery, with a similar hop profile plus a wicked spicy bite that makes a wonderful drinking experience. MO is a solid pale to be reckoned with, however. I'd love to see this sucker in cans some day..."
""
""
"Nose is phenomenal! Just as good, if not better than I remember it being. A Pale Ale I could drink until the end of my days. One of the top 2-3 best smelling beers I have come across."
"Serving type: bottle"
"*Update 7/05/13* Had this a few times since. They've really dialed this one in. Hop flavor to bitterness ratio has improved. Taste score upped."
"Overall: I love this aggressively dry-hopped APA thing. Maine Beer Co. kills it. Great balance and one hell of a nose. If they keep this kind of stuff up it'll disappear faster than Lunch, and that's saying something."
""
"O: this is a delicious pale ale, kinda seems like an ipa to me, but whatever you want to call this, it is delicious and I would highly recommend this. A seriously hoppy pale ale!"
""
""
"O - Overall this beer is well, oh my god is it good. Great tropical aspects that just scream fresh. Really worth picking up if one has the chance."
"This is a good Pale Ale, but I expect a lot more from MBC. A pretty underwhelming offering when compared to the quality of Peeper, Zoe and Lunch."
"Slight fruitiness initially. Dry bitterness takes over quickly and is particularly tingly on the tongue. Exceptionally long bitter aftertaste. The body leans on the richer side while the carbonation is as expected."
"I am just blown away by how good this brewery makes beer. Just another solid offering regardless of mouthfeel."
"Real good stuff here. MBC is really hitting home runs with their hop forward beers. I need six packs."
"Very delicious. Drink fresh!"
""
"Overall this is great stuff especially for Maine/New england where everything is heavy on the malt. Pick up a bottle."

"O: a very good pale ale. Quite hoppy, this beer flirts with IPA status and reminds me a lot of Zombie Dust. Excellent! I am going to attempt to buy a case before it sells out. A must have. 5.0"
"Always excited to try anything new from the guys at MBC. This one pours a very vibrant gold, very clear, huge rocky head. Lively, and screaming fresh. Very hoppy in the nose, lots of green pine, some citrus, herb-y. Flavor is indeed very hoppy but this beer remains balanced. Lots of bright hops, herbal and grassy and pine again, woodsy, light doughy malts, and a definite crispness. This beer is super light on the palate for having so much flavor. Very airy and quaffable. Definitely along the same lines as Peeper and Lunch but a testament the brewery that they can pull off such a variety of hoppy light colored beers that all have their own identity. Curious to see if this makes it into the regular rotation or is just a seasonal / one-off. Always a delicious, fresh, well made beer from Maine"
"I like this beer. Although similar, it is distinctly different than Peeper. This is hoppier than a lot of pale ales...it's close to an IPA. Fans of MBC won't be disappointed with this new product. IF you've enjoyed their other offerings, I recommend you give MO a shot as well."
""
"O: The extreme care and hard work shown by the brewery is evident yet again in this newest beer. Not sure if this is a one-time deal or if they will release more, though. This is a lot like peeper, only a little maltier in the taste. Very easy to drink and evenly priced with the rest of the line-up"
