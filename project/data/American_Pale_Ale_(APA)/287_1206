At first I liked the taste, but as I drank more of it and it warmed, I enjoyed it less. I'll take the average and give it a 3.5. Mouthfeel was above average for an APA.

3.72,9.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer is a golden blonde color, with a healthy head. As I take the aroma in I detect bready malts and coriander, with a slight hint of hops. The taste has a floral touch, full of wheat and rich graininess, and a citrus background. It finishes with a alight bitterness on the tongue. The mouth feel is medium and overall, no one thing dominates. I began to appreciate this beer more as I went through it for its subtleties. Underrated.","Neorebel","Nov 05, 2011"

The smell of the beer had some fresh grain aromas with some hoppy aromas in there as well. The taste of the beer was average in my opinion.

Taste is lackluster, faint hops, earthy, hay, no citrus, no real pine, no real nothing. I got more out of Bell's Amber which is saying something. Pale malt is not to heavy which is commendable. The body seems on point, light and crisp carb, it's just lacking any taste from remaining on the palat for more than a few seconds. I drank it and thats that.","BARFLYB","Sep 19, 2011"

With as many really good to excellent beers Bell's puts out, this one is a total dud. It may be a bit harsh on the beer by itself, but c'mon Bell's…seriously? You really cant brew a fantastic APA?

Tastes like a sharpened Oberon. Moderate carbonation. Very, very dry taste. Healthy bitterness. Smooth with gentle spiciness. Excellent hoppy finish. This might be my new favorite summer beer.

My first was Two Hearted Ale, so the standard was set pretty high, maybe a little too high for this one. The label describes it as ""a blond ale...with a distinctive spicy, floral aroma and taste."" I'd say this is totally accurate. The floral taste just does not do much for me. It's not a bad brew, and having it on a hot Sunday afternoon while working on my deck was probably an appropriate time for it, as it was light and refreshing. But just found it to be nothing special, and i'll probably not be picking any more of this up on future road trips.","AngusOg","Jun 26, 2011"

First thing's first. This is a different monster than the average APA you'll have. The up-front citrus and the backing herbal hops give it a completely different character than most APAs, which use bright, juicy hops. Here, all the brightness is imparted with the citrus, and the herbal hops help temper it. The mouthfeel is solid, it's well-carbonated and has a lighter body. The drinkability is quite good. Overall, this was a solid and fairly unique pale ale that's very easy to drink.","shand","Jun 11, 2011"

Big rubber type smell with a metallic tone. This tastes more like a tea than a pale ale. Ginger, spice, clove, herbs, tastes kinda like lemon flavored medicinal herbal tea.

The nose comprises coriander, orane peel, slightly dank wheat, and a touch of caramel. That wheat smell just doesn't really work very well for my 'strils. The taste is a blast of vague and blunt rind-y bitterness, with a kiss of musty caramel for effect (I assume). Wow...no... The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry-ish finish. Overall, I never thought I would dislike a Bell's product this much.

Smell of grapefruit and malt is in the forefront with aromas of wheat and corn is lighter fragrances. There is also a touch of black pepper. Taste is an improvement over the looks and smell. Great taste of the hops in nodes of grapefruit. There is some flavors of malt, wheat, oats, and spices. There is quite a bit of body in the mouthfeel of this brew, creamy and just the right amount of zing. Some aftertaste of the hops linger. Got better as it warms.

It's not your typical west coast over hopped cascade boring beer. Frankly I don't know what hops are in it but the taste is very distinctive and kind of citrusy but not like the so called west coast citrus which is more like pine in my opinion. The beer is full tasting not thin as suggested by some who of the reviewers.The guy who owns that beer distributor in the South Hills of Pittsburgh area says it's his favorite beer. He has dozens of craft beers ,most of them more expensive and that's the one he drinks. It is fresh tasting and doesn't have that typical caramel sweetness. This beer is similar in some ways to Bell's Oberon, another fine example. To conclude if you beer drinkers think that over hopped beers like Sierra Nevada are the alpha and omega of your beer desire don't buy this. If you like a fresh tasting, satisfying and pleasant experience out of the norm then you MUST go buy this beer. I go to California every year and because it is not distributed there as yet I have to suffer the experience of drinking all those IPA that pretty much taste the same.","gat1240","Apr 02, 2011"

Bitterness was apparent throughout, biscuity malts were prominent up front, then grapefruit took over and lingered in the finish.

The white head initially swells up to about a finger's worth, but retention and lacing are both a little weak. The aroma is of citrus american hops, but not as pungent as I would expect from an american pale ale. There's also a prominent pale malt sweetness in the nose. The taste is a carbon copy of the nose, orange and lemon zest at the close along with an upfront sweetness that reminds me of a belgian pale ale. A brief crack of hop bitterness falls in between the two and is a welcome addition. Body is appropriately light, almost surprisingly so for the amount of malty flavor this beer has, and the carbonation is medium and does a good job of emphasizing the hops while not becoming too fizzy. The solid taste, restrained hop presence, and great mouthfeel make this an extremely easy drinking beer. A great effort from Bell's.","axeman9182","Jul 20, 2010"

Smell is everything I would expect from a Pale Ale, with hints of biscuit, grain, bits of fruit...dry overall character.

It had been forever since I tried a good pale that I had not had, and let alone a Bells I was stoked. Poured a nice very hazy golden amber with about two inches of white head on top. A nice slow fade gave way to copious side glass lace and a nice film across the top. You could tell it was nice due to ample carbonation consistently replenishing it. Great fresh aroma, with lots of floral hops and a good bit of grain in the back. The taste followed through pretty much the same. Great floral hop flavor hit you right away, but it was very light and refreshing, nothing overbearing about it at all. Nice underlying grain base had a touch of sweetness to it which gave it some good depth. Smooth, crisp finish with a nice lingering bitterness. Great light bodied feel and amble carbonation made it very light and refreshing and kept you wanting to come back for more. This was easily a session ale with no issues. Overall I was very impressed here. This was an awesome pale that was more the adequately hopped and really had a great profile. I would love to have this on tap in my house, it would really be something that would go well for a large gathering of friends or during a game. Highly recommended here.","mikesgroove","Oct 24, 2007"

Smells of spring flowers, light spice, spearmint and peppermint. There is a really assertive hoppy taste and mouthfeel, dry and sharp. Substantial body but fairly high alcolhol seems to come through in the ginger-snappy aftertaste that is also a touch sour and takes away from the drinkability quotient.

Trademark Bell's yeasty suspension as well. The nose is partially full of light, fresh citrus aromas and dry spice. Imagine the misty aroma you get when you bend the peel of a lemon or orange. Not a whole lot of hops present in the aroma, although they are slightly detectable. There is also a slight whiff of dry malt. A light and smooth body carries, what you can tell is, a brew that has been created by a smart brewer. Light hop flavor hints of aromatic citrus fruits as mentioned above. A well balanced, and again very light, malt sweetness supports the hops and does not overpower. Finishes super clean with a nice dry, fresh husk flavor. This has got to be one of the cleanest and freshest beers I've ever tasted. One could easily have a fantastic session with this beer on a very hot summer day.","BeerHonky","Feb 12, 2007"

Taste was an improvement on the aroma but still not much more than average. Good blend of mild hops and pale malt. There was a pleasant sweetness on the final sip. The peer possessed a decent carbonation and alcohol was hardly noticeable. This would be a decent session beer, likely better suited for the summer.","atsprings","Feb 11, 2007"

The bouquet consists of pale malts, spicy/floral hops, and maybe some yeast. It tastes of a pale malt background - mainly for balance - with a nice mix of piney/grassy/spicy hops and hints of grapefruit/perfume, combining to deliver a medium bitterness. It feels nice on the palate, with natural carbonation and a lightly tingly, dry body that leaves a medium to long finish. Overall very reminiscent of SNPA except with more bitterness and less of a malt profile. Definitely sessionable if you can get it.","mmmbeer","Dec 21, 2006"

Having tasted the Bells Two-Hearted Ale, ans some of their stouts, I am a little let down by this rather average offering, yet I admit that most American Pale Ales that really knock my socks off could actually qualify as IPAs in disguise, much like a 20 year old senior on the Highschool Varsity football team.","dedrinker","Dec 06, 2006"

Finishes with notes of citrus and spice, fairly dry. Good example of an intelligent pale ale, excellent artwork on the bottle as well...","mikeys01","Aug 02, 2003"
2.7,-20.8,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"If it wasn't for the dominating grainy tannins, this would be a pretty decent beer. However, as it stands, this is a one beer beer. Glad I gave it a try though ...","Todd","Jul 31, 2003"
3,-12,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a flourescent orange color with little head that soon left and there was no lacing to be found. The yeast was strong flavored here and provided a citrusy aroma and taste. Hops seemed to be more floral in taste and definitely strong. Finishes with a mouth puckering hop kick. Everything about this beer tells me it's average for a pale ale.","granger10","Jul 25, 2003"

3.8,11.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Finally got around to reviewing this one and overall I'd say it's a solid pale ale. It pours out a clear golden yellow with a small white head that fades to almost nothing. Malt dominates the nose and has a sweet bready, almost biscuity aroma with some help from the yeast. Hops are there but barely play a supporting role. Good texture on the tongue and a proper medium body. Again, malt takes the stage with bread and some fruit. Hop flavor is very detectable with some earthy tones and a nice lingering bitterness. Not a whole bunch going on here with this beer but a good pale ale needs not be overly complex. I could drink this all night if I could only get more of it here in Virginia.","DrewS","Jul 15, 2003"

3.33,-2.3,2.5,4.5,3,3,3,"Another questionable bottle of Bell's beer. Pours a cloudy gold/orange color, topped by a loose, off white head, and highly sedimented. The aroma is nice, with strong malts and a nice floral aroma. Notes of orange in the nose as well. Actually very nice and fruity. The taste is more lager-like than ale like, with a sharp malt taste finished by a crisp hoppiness. Lingering bitterness on the finish. No souring or wet cardboard flavors to hint at an old or spoiled bottle. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, with agressive carbonation. Drinkability is average. Best part of this beer is the nose.","aaronh","Jul 05, 2003"
3.2,-6.2,3,3,3.5,3,3,"This brew has a very mild aroma almost non-existent. It has a light yellow orange body with no head and great lacing. It also has a bit of an after bite.

2.95,-13.5,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Looks just like a wheat beer, cloudy deep golden color with small white head of foam. Smells kind of yeasty with a slight floral aroma. Very crisp and effervescent. Flavor is a little stale with a slight bitterness. Not one of the best pales I've had. Would prefer a little more hop presence. Reminds sme of one of my homebrews I used to make. Not as good as some of their other brews. This brewery seems to be inconsistant in my opinion. They have some stellar brews and some like this one. Just doesn't impress me.","BierReise","Jun 19, 2003"
4.73,38.7,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"What a spectacular looking beer! Pours a creamy head. Looks like a mogul-covered ski slope. Except it's not downhill. It looks like there is a storm in the cloudy peach-colored beer. The head refuses to settle. It's there as I drain the glass. Smells wheaty and slightly of apricot. Tastes fantastic. This may be best traditional pale ale I have had. Very complex. Somewhat bitter aftertaste. I think I need to head to Kalamazoo. I'll bring my kazoo.","dwarbi","May 27, 2003"
4.1,20.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Notes: Judging from several of the other reviews, it appears that some question this being a pale ale/bitter. I also found it very mild in the bitterness category, but I also really enjoyed the taste of this beer.","OldFrothingSlosh","May 13, 2003"
3.97,16.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours to a orangish-copper color with an off-white head. Has a huge blast of fruity, citrus hop aroma. Has a different flavor, almost nutty, with fruitiness. It flows to a very dry and bitter finish. It is medium in bodied and highly drinkable. Another tasty brew from Bells.","BeerBuilder","May 12, 2003"
3.31,-2.9,2.5,4,3,3,3.5,"I have to say I was a little disappointed in this beer, especially after being so impressed by most of the other Bell's brews I have tried. Pours an almost sickly looking light orange color with a thin and foamy white head. Very floral hops aroma, with light citrus notes as well. Flavor is mild, with perfumy hops and light malt. Finish is crisp and light, with a nice hops presense lingering. Okay, but gimme an Expedition next time.","Dogbrick","Apr 22, 2003"

It's citrusy and yeasty, I really enjoy it. There's a wonderful smoothness to this beer, medium carbonation and mouthfeel. I really enjoy the spicy hop character, also fruity in a way. This character follows pleasant malt character. It's kind of odd for the style to me, but I really enjoy it regardless. It's an awesome beer.","AudioGilz","Apr 09, 2003"
3.63,6.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Chunky, murky pale orange appearance with a lighter 1/2 inch head of medium bubbles. Laces in rings. Grassy hop aroma, quite evidently mixed with an oiled pizza dough yeastiness. Semi-coating and smooth mouthfeel and a mid caramel malt bill supplemented by a nectarine fruitiness. Hops tend toward an slightly astringent citrus and are evident mid mouth onward. Good balance. What's really evident here is the yeasty breadiness, welcome in many of the Kalamazoo Stouts, but somewhat strange here (as in the Sparkling Ale as well). So I'm a fence sitter, balanced but somewhat odd flavor.","ADR","Mar 31, 2003"
4.1,20.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A somewhat reserved pale ale, but very well crafted and quite drinkable. Citrusy/floral hops were judiciously administered and well balanced by a lightly toasted malt. Tended to lean a little toward the English interpretation. Very clean and refreshing - a good session ale. Strikes me as a good transition beer to build a non-hop-head's tolerance (and appreciation) for Two Hearted Ale.","Brent","Mar 30, 2003"
3.5,2.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"@The Press Grille: This beer poured a hazy/cloudy yellow color(chilled glass did not help-note to bartender after I get to know him better)and had a small bubbly white head that left trace lace. It had an aroma of hops, citrus and slightly of malt. A flavor of hops, citrus and bread. The finish was light an a touch astrigent. As far as pale ale's go, this is not a good example and a rare miss for Bell's.","Wildman","Mar 19, 2003"

4.42,29.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy gold, with a persistent fluffy white head that leaves a fair amount of lace. Aroama is full of toasted malt, cut grass, and spices. Flavor begins as bread dough, then becomes herbal and bitter. The flavors balance quite well. Mouthfeel is just slightly rough and somewhat oily, with a medium body. This is a most excellent pale ale, that I could drink all night long. Kalamazoo does it again!","zerk","Feb 09, 2003"
3.15,-7.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a hazy yellow, very little head that fades to zero, and virtually no lace. Faint smell of sweet hops, slightly bready. The taste reveals very little carbonation, light malty, slightly spicey. Not too much going on in the mouthfeel, and a short, slightly hoppy finish. Strange, I have the Expedition stout in the wings that I am looking foward to, but this one falls short.","HopheadEd","Jan 22, 2003"
4.75,39.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"The color's that of ripe apricot, the head a solid, stocky white. Aromas are explosive, spinning off citrus, primarily grapefruit, orange, lemon, and a whiff of spice. A downright friendly finish, that meets you, and greets you and treats you right. Awash in bitter, but fruity flavor, with a sensational, and long lasting drizzle of hops. Fresh, sea-foamy nose. Light body, excellent texture and mouthfeel, full of that unexplainable effervescence that permeats all of Bell's ales. It's got to be that yummy, yummy yeast. One hell of a great pale ale!","feloniousmonk","Jan 11, 2003"
4.12,20.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a reddish orange with a white head. Nice hopiness with enough maltiness to back it up. A really solid version of the style. Another solid brick in the foundation of a rock solid brewing company.","jtw5877","Jan 03, 2003"
3.18,-6.7,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Enjoyed on tap 12/9/02. Pured an amber color with a medium head that quickly dissipated. The strong hops aroma was clearly noticable on the nose and accompanied by an overwhelming citric, grapefruit taste. The presence of malts providing any balance to this brew was undiscernible. One pint was enough for me.","rotsaruch","Dec 09, 2002"
3.88,13.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Hazy gold body with a thick, almost creamy head.  Head fades surprisingly fast, but never disappears altogether.  Smell is a bit grassy, with bready caramel malt and citrus hops.  Good smell, but a little weak.  Well balanced flavor.  Neither the caramel malt nor the hops really takes full control in the taste.  Caramel malt is a bit biscuity, and the hops are bitter and citrusy.  Finishes oily and bitter.  Rough, oily mouthfeel for this excellent session brew.","Viking","Nov 09, 2002"
3.85,12.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"It's a little paler than I was expecting from Bell's. A lot of PAs are darker than this beer. It does have that nice wet, clingy head that I love pale ales to have, though. The aroma is mostly the hops, a bit thin and astringent, but not unpleasant. I was a little worried at the taste. Had the brewery I had come to expect for big malty beer let me down? Turns out the light color had less to do with lack of malt than with the color of the malt used. The malt flavors dominate early on. As the beer warms, the thin, bitter hops dominate the beginning finishing with the crisp malt. Not my favorite APA, but far from a mediocre example of the style. One thing, though. If you're expecting the huge hoppiness of a lot of the really popular APAs, this is a bit mild.","aracauna","Nov 01, 2002"

4.03,18.2,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Palest of all. Gold. At first there's an impression of brown sugar on the nose with candied lemon in the background. Then the kaleidescope shifts and there is a custard-like egginess predominant. Then, once more, it reconfigures as a freshly opened can of creamed corn, corn and milk. The attack is of overripe citrus. Bright, clear flavors of cane, pancakes and lemon marmelade with sunny, hayfield notes weaving in to linger. This beer was easy to pick out in the lineup for that trademark Bell's signature flavor.","putnam","Oct 05, 2002"

It is very unique though as it almost has some Belgian qualities to it..a pours a cloudy golden with a big thick head....smell is yeasty as you'd expect with a bottle conditioned beer...also some sourness on the nose...  Taste has some biscuit, breadiness to it and some real spicy hop accents..maybe even some subtle smokiness to it similar to Batch 5000 in that regard but toned down about one-thousand times...One of the more unique pale ale's but not my bag of tea...nice to try and solid in its own right but I like many others better.

A nice hoppy sharpness with some of the fruitiness giving way to a hint of toastiness.  Mouthfeel is smooth without being slimy.

Light floral and spicy hops smell.  The hops attack the tongue first thing but are then nicely followed by just enough malt to balance this one.

4.13,21.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The huge, billowy thick and creamy head sits atop a light golden bubbly brew.  Good clarity, although there are yeast particles from the apparent bottle conditioning.  The signature but subtle fruity, almost pearlike esters from Bell's yeast strain are discernible in the aroma, along with a hint of diacetyl.  The Centennial hop nose is citrusy and a touch grapefruity-- the hop nose is reminescent of a subdued Two Hearted Ale.  Very smooth mouthfeel. The hop bitterness is mild to moderate for a pale, and a firm malt character manages to assert itself into the flavor profile.  Slightly leafy hop flavor.  The finish is very clean with a pleasant nuttiness and mild hop bitterness.  Although this isn't as distinctive as other Bells brews, this pale is finely balanced.  As the risk of sounding esoteric this beer tastes like a mix of Liberty Ale and Odells Cutthroat Pale.","marc77","Apr 06, 2002"
