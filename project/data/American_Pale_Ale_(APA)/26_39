The nose is aromatic, earthy/piney hops, but not smashing in your face - quite a reserved hop profile that mixes well into the malty sweetness. The beer drink with a malt sweetness upfront, which quickly transitions into modestly bitter and flavorful hops that linger. It's well carbonated, has balanced malt-hop character, a pleasant aftertaste, minimal alcohol, and a hint of bready yeast. This is a pretty crush-able beer, balanced and with good availability - I'd definitely recommend.","ThePorterSorter","Jan 18, 2015"

I have this a few times a month on draft, and it is always excellent- perhaps the best balanced APA I've had. Aggressively hopped with fantastic citrus and caramel at the same time. One of so many great Three Floyd's offerings. Believe it or not, this one can be had for $3 a pint or less year-round at two bars in my town.","Roadking1979","Nov 08, 2014"

Creamy, smooth, medium low carbonation and medium high body gives it a big smooth, and very soft, mouthfeel. Decently balanced, leans toward the dry side, and like Zobie Dust, low acidity. Piney, slightly catty, and at 6.6 ABV, a nice in-between all days and DIPAs. Wouldn't call it intense aroma, though. More understated and consistent with the flavor.","LittleDon","Oct 19, 2014"

4.28,0.5,4,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Pours a deep copper color with a big, foamy white head that settled slowly to a creamy collar and leaving some nice lacing. The nose is a nice balance of malt and hops; bread biscuits and caramel along with some floral, spicy hops. The taste follows suit with again, a really nice balance. The malt presents as nice and toasty, some bread and sweet caramel. The hops were difficult for me to tweeze out, and presented more as those great West coast spicy and floral bouquet. It has a easy drinking body, yet is still round and creamy with enough carb to lighten but not too much. Overall, I was impressed with the balance FFF achieves with this brew and the depth of flavor considering its low-ish ABV.","mtomlins","Jun 27, 2014"

The aftertaste is sad, because the ale is going away. Otherwise, it too is sublime, with malts and hops staying on the tongue for a long time. It tastes as though the alcohol would preclude you from drinking more than one, but I think I could do SEVERAL of these, and be in heaven, so I will try to get more. But alas, they are rare, and in demand. Rightfully so.","schoolboy","Jun 08, 2014"

3.4,-20.2,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Pours a robust copper color with about a finger’s breadth of off-white, almost ivory colored head comprised of medium-sized bubbles. Respectable retention and lacing. The aroma is of spicy and earthen hop cones, a bit of pine sap, some wet earth, and orange citrus. It tastes similar, but with a greater emphasis on the orange citrus. A bit of lemon rind and grapefruit come through as well. Earthen notes, including grass and pine, are more predominant than the spicy character that was notable on the nose. Hint of caramel malt on the end. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, but rich in carbonation with a nearly effervescent quality. Finish is wet and refreshing, but doesn’t linger longer than wanted. Overall, this is a very drinkable and enjoyable pale ale. While commendable, it lacks a certain depth that some other top-tier examples may provide, seeming somewhat one-dimensional. Still, this only adds to the drinkability, as it prevents it from becoming too filling or overwhelming; in that regard, great success here.","eclipse54","Feb 22, 2014"

It's got the hop presence of an IPA but is labeled as an APA. The smell is not outstanding at all, and while the hop profile really is quite nice, the one-dimensional malt character (oversweet caramel) contributes an odd and unappreciated balance to all of the hops. The mouthfeel is the strong suit here--despite all of the super-sweet caramel flavors, it's not sticky and the thickness and carbonation are near spot-on. While I very much enjoyed this brew, I can't say it quite lives up to its hype.","DeFaz","Jan 08, 2014"

Aroma is sweet malt and bitter peach, tropical fruit and fresh cut grain. Flavor is sweet and malty up front - the hops seem to be an afterthought upon the first sip, merely there to balance the classic carmel malt flavor, but man do they slowly creep up to dominate the palate with earthy bitterness and stone fruit that lingers well after the malt gives way in the overall flavor. Finish is dry and clean, light effervescence with sappy hop oil lingering for days! Overall top 5 pale ale i've ever had the opportunity to try. Right up there with Alpine's Hoppy Birthday.

Taste is not aggressive but very assertive, no harsh bitterness at all. Lemon comes through strong and is followed by a subdued soft bitterness. Modest sweet cereal body ties it all together. Light alcohol flavor, but hidden enough that it could sneak up on you. More drinkable than its 6.6 ABV would suggest. Overall this is an incredible Pale Ale, and it most definitely lives up to the hype it gets. Well done. 89/100","MetricOcean","Oct 31, 2013"

Getting hints of bread, biscuit, a bit of carmel and some piney hops off this one. Kind of underwhelmed on the aroma. The taste makes up for it though. Tons of hop presence from the first sip. Nice resiney pine base with citrus fruit overtones, also getting some peach through on this one. The malt comes through less in the flavor than on the nose, but the same flavors are there. Good caarbonation, medium mouthfeel. Overall, great beer. I enjoyed the hop presence in this APA, and found it very easy to drink.

4.64,8.9,5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,"Thanks NW2285. Pours orange to brick red with slightly cloudy body. A thick, three finger off-white head with excellent retention and nice lacing. Strong orange notes dominate the nose with a hint of pine needle and faint caramel as well. Orange hits the palate first delivering a strong citrusy taste that’s faintly tart. The next notes are sweeter - sherbet and caramel. Alpha King finishes dry and slightly bitter, with faint resin notes. Medium bodied, not quite as chewy as an IPA, but pretty close. The carbonation is lively. Overall this might be the finest example of an American Pale Ale out there. Great work 3Floyds.","JohnG190","Aug 08, 2013"

The smell of hops is a bit thick, and the aftertaste is a bit to hoppy for me, but that's the style. It absolutely represents the style well. There are times when I'm in a hoppy mood. I usually turn to an Imperial Stout, but those are quite heavy. This is a little lighter, a bit more drinkable. I could have another.","DougT","Jul 27, 2013"

If I was at a party and that was among a variety of other beers, I would grab it first (followed by a Zombie Dust). The only problems with the beer are the price, around $12 a six pack, and availability.","Birdsong73","Jul 17, 2013"

It's by far the 2nd best American pale ale ever produced IMO and I'm sure everyone knows who make the #1 APA. Yep, FFF hold both of those 1 and 2 spots in my book. Simply remarkable what they do with Alpha King and Zombie Dust. Both are clear cut winners and both a must try. If you have access to this then you should be enjoying it. It's top shelf good. I just wish we'd get the bottles of this on a regular basis here at home. Ill buy this anytime I see it. A well balanced world class APA that's ridiculously tasty and fulfilling? Indeed. FFF brewing a liquid like Alpha King = pure Class. Pure genius.","BradtheGreat7","Apr 17, 2013"

I love the look of this beer poured into a pint glass, darker then your average pale ale (or ipa) amber, with some caramel color, hazy, nice head and lacing. Don’t get me wrong it has plenty of hops up front but this thing is well balanced and the very last taste in the back of my mouth is toasty malts. This is damn good beer, I love how the citrus hop flavor up front is balanced and nearly taken over by malt. Hate to use the ""malt backbone"" cliché but it's really appropriate here. It takes a hell of a malt backbone to even out these hops. Times change fast, this used to be seen as a real hop bomb of a pale ale/IPA but now that job is left up to it’s brother Zombie Dust, meanwhile this one is becoming a classic.","Frankinstiener","Apr 03, 2013"

4.17,-2.1,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"real hoppy for a pale ale, more of an ipa to me. very red in color, not quite amber, but definitely moving in that direction, with a big rich tan head that doesn't fade at all. bold hop aromas are just blasting out of this, with equal parts forest and fruit grove. definitely some higher alpha acid varieties, this beer seems by the smell to be very appropriately named. the flavor actually does find some malt balance, despite the intense hopping. there is a sweeter yet dry American caramel malt going on, which holds up the hops quite well. plenty of citrus bitterness in the finish too, not lemony, but equally pungent. there is also a sort of woody character to this that I sometimes find in hoppy beers, not like its been oaked, but like its made in part from freshly milled timber. in any event, the finish is about an 7 on a 10 point bitter scale, strong but not overbearing. nice mouthfeel too, maybe a little dense for the style, but this is a style that's constantly in flux anyways. plenty of carbonation and a decent abv make this about the perfect 6pack beer in my mind. One of my first few beers from the much hyped three floyds, and it did not disappoint, although I can think of several American pales that are every bit as good as the alpha king here. still fantastic.","StonedTrippin","Mar 26, 2013"

The finish is super clean, and offers a burst of fresh hops. Not only is this beer pretty much perfectly balanced, it has an outstanding flavor. There's virtually no aftertaste, which makes me want to keep going back for another sip. Alpha King's a worthy flagship beer at Three Floyds, and one of my absolute favorite beers overall. I can only hope that they ship this stuff to Michigan some day soon.","Alextricity","Feb 09, 2013"

The hops are balanced absolutely perfect with a slight citrus aftertaste. the 6.66% ABV is also a nice touch from the boys (and girl) over at three floyds.

The aroma is dominated by hops with bright orange-tangerine and freshly cut grass notes taking the forefront. However, there’s a nicely doughy caramel malt backbone holding up that hoppiness. This beer definitely straddles the line between APA and IPA. The taste is also much bigger than your average APA. It has marvelous balance, starting with malt sweetness and smoothly transitioning to hop bitterness in the finish. It’s very, very easy to drink. The beer has a round, full feel that never gets too heavy. Flavor fills your mouth with each sip, but it finishes clean, light and in need of another quaff.","popery","Jan 26, 2013"

But this one hit me with a tantalizing blast of hoppy aromas as soon as I popped the cap of the bottle and unfortunately went down hill from there. I found it overly sweet, more assertively bitter than flavorfully hopped, and drinking bigger than it should. Lacks subtlety of any kind and has more alcohol presence than I'd like, both characteristics I've encountered before with this brewery 's beers. Not bad, but I clearly am in the minority here in not being a huge fan of this.","tobelerone","Oct 19, 2012"

Nice apa, their zombie dust is preferred. ale Ales have never been near my favorite types of beers, but Alpha King is definitely good. VERY hoppy, with a strong malt backbone, AK is best (at least for me) paired with food to ""wash it down", as I dislike the extremely hoppy aftertaste. This is going against the grain of my Great Divide Titan IPA review, which was glowing, but I prefer the Titan due to it’s dryness. There’s a sweetness in the background of AK that I can’t get over. Still, Alpha King is outstanding, but I prefer other pale ales.","menkros","Sep 28, 2012"

I remember it being more refreshing without as big of a malt characteristic. So, definitely pick up a six pack, but don't let it sit too long.","C20Percent","Aug 07, 2012"
4.26,0,5,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the dark and beautiful coloring, and the freshness throughout. The hop presence is phenomenal, and again, so fresh and gritty. The malts become a bit muddy in the nose, and almost overpowering with warmth from those great hops right at the start. Throughout the taste, however, the blend of the malts and the hops is supreme, and this is one of the best in the style for sure. Drink on the colder side, as excess warmth throws the balance to the more sour grain side of things.","TheBrewo","Aug 07, 2012"

So, it can be a little pungent and I recall not wanting to take big sips, but at the same time I could easily have a couple of these in a sitting.","TheRealBigC","Jul 30, 2012"

Poured a dark copper color with its foam being a sort of bone-white. Smell makes it immediately apparent that this is a fiendishly hoppy beer- I smell the citrusy notes that I've come to associate with cascade hops. That taste measures up to the smell- hops from beginning to end and rounded out with a nice medium light body. The mouthfeel is wonderful as well- a little oily from the hops and medium carbonation make it very drinkable. I would get this all the time if it was available to me.","Hopdaemon39","Jan 09, 2012"

The nose is very nice- hops, some malt, citrus fruit, a little grass. Very well blended, and pleasant smelling for the style. The flavor is almost like an IPA- much more flavor and hops than I was expecting. Big hop bite, with grapefruit, orange, pine, and a decent malt backbone holding everything together. Really big taste for the style. Fairly smooth, malty aftertaste.. but the hops are definitely still there. Feel is medium, with a nice bite, good carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, I can see why this is the #3 beer for it's style. Really well done- another winner from FFF. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Jan 06, 2012"

Smells of citrus, lots and lots of grapefruit fresh from the produce isle. a bit of toffee, bread and a hint of caramel malt are buried deep underneath. Taste is citrus and resinous with bits of bread and malt barely breaking onto the scene. Long lingering hop bite in the finish is there but never harsh. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation with a smooth resinous mouthfeel. This is a very nice beer, but to call this a pale ale is a bit of a stretch.

There was a liquor store down the street that had 3-4 craft beers and this was one of them. (Another was a spoiled sixer of Abita Turbodog I bought once. It was AWFUL. Pure soy sauce!). I loved Alpha King from the start, and still do. I drank it when I was at the brewery way back then, before the brewpub existed and it was just a well-lit factory atmosphere. Some old-timers were drinking their Light Lager offering and eating some potato chips they had brought. It ruled. Citrus, caramel malt, a bit sticky, excellent. I had it on tap at MacNiven's during lunch (a liquid lunch in my case).. to celebrate the end of my first semester at grad school. I also had Bell's Sparkling Ale, which I was less impressed by but still enjoyed. Indianapolis is a good beer city. We have lots of good options.","MarkBlackout","Dec 08, 2011"

Aromas of big orange zest, pine, lemon zest, caramel, light grapefruit, bread, and a bit of spiciness. Some fantastic aromas here with great balance and strength. Taste of big orange, pine, spiciness, caramel, bread, and a bit of toasted malt. Nice amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, spiciness, caramel, and bread on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Fantastic drinkability with no alcohol noticed at all except for a slight warming on the finish. Fantastic balance of flavor and bitterness.

4.42,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a deep orange with a generous head. Aroma is mostly hops (citrus and pine) with some malts coming through too. Taste is the same floral hops with a little bit more of a malt backbone than I expected/remembered -- it is an APA after all. Still, it's a pleasant surprise because the smell had me expecting IPA all the way. The malty backbone really mellows and balances the spiciness of the hops. Great use of hops to balance out the flavors here. Plus, it's nice to find a beer where the hoppy flavor blends so well and doesn't overwhelm. Good, balanced mouthfeel with a crisp, hoppy finish. Drinkable and delicious.","scout","Oct 23, 2011"
4.35,2.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Alpha King pours a deep orange/amber color with a finger of off-white head. Decent lacing. The nose is citrus hops and pale malt. Taste opens with bitter orange rind. Malt lends notes of sugar cookies and caramel mid palate. Bitterness reasserts itself in the finish and there is a nice lingering bitter aftertaste. Feel is medium bodied. Carbonation is spot on and lends a creamy texture to the beer. Alpha King is an excellent example of the style. Ridiculously drinkable and insanely tasty.

Deep copper with a beautiful three finger head and really awesome lacing. The nose is like wildflowers, grass and pine... smells like a vibrant forest should. Excellent hop flavor right from the beginning the really fires the senses and adds some spice, and the floral flavors accent it very nicely. The malt takes somewhat of a backseat but is there to tie everything together with lingering sweetness.

I didn't really want to follow along with the pack and say something was good just because of the name on the baottle since this was my first experience with Three Floyds, but I do have to say that I wish I could pick some of this up in Iowa.

First whiff is an attack of hops. Pungent notes of grapefruit and orange backed by notes of pine and a little apple cider to boot. Malt backbone is quite strong, husky kiln dried malts with the faintest touch of roast. Taste begins bitter, much stronger then any pale I have knows. Hops flavor is big on citrus (bitter grapefruit and orange rind) and the malt does more then just provide the backbone. The malt presence is high, but the sweetness is quite low. Medium bodied, smooth, creamy and very dry on the palate.

Yes. The flavor is highly hoppy, citrus rind, floral and slightly piney. After the burst of hop flavor chewy, bready malt emerges and that is finally wiped clean by moderate hop bitterness. The beer finishes perfectly balanced between dryness from the hops and sweet, bready malt, very smooth and well rounded. The carbonation is medium-low and body medium.

On the tongue this thing rocks, very crisp. Lots of piney aromatic hops up front, but the malty backbone tones them down a bit through out the end. A good amount of grapefruit comes out when it warms up, with i think compliments the malty characteristic. excellent brew to go with a late summers night dinner, or to exhaust fatigue from a hard day's struggle.","SDDanC","Jul 10, 2011"

Now, before I say, ""BUPGOO!", imagine putting this in kids' hands ... How about a box of matches to go with? Even after all of that thinking and typing, the head was still hanging in, leaving behind the kind of lacing that will require a jackhammer to remove later. Nose had the kind of upfront hops intensity that seared my nostrils! Really, it was big on piney hops and underlain with caramel malt sweetness. This should be an air freshener, especially for my classroom. Mouthfeel was creamy, exploding with hops initially and then letting the malt get a chance. I amend my initial take on the mouthfeel to ""oily"". Man, they squeezed those hops for all that they were worth! Once more, I began to hear my Hops Monkey screeching for his Jones. F**k! I rue the day Victory Hop Devil touched my lips and sent me down the road to Perdition. I am a Hops Junkie, nay, a Hops Fiend and every time I wean myself off the hops, a beer comes along to pull me back in. Finish had the hops that I crave and although the malt tried to assert itself, I was focused on dem hops, baby. S**t, what can I hock in this dump and get some scratch? I need to be on the road, like tomorrow if not sooner, so I can score some more of this! Hey, man, is it normal to itch like this? My skin is crawlin'. Dig, my neighbor across the way deals in hops, so maybe I can cop a taste to hold me over. He lets me buy a pellet at a time, just to dissolve under my tongue. Yo, lemme get a hit of some Columbus or some Amarillo, bro. He's down, but I gotta hit the source (again). This tongue-poppin' bottle-swiilin' nonsense ain't makin' it.

4.13,-3.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This pours a burnt orange with a nice, tight, one finger head that faces down to a collar and leaves good lace behind. On the nose are earthy, caramel malts that I don't remember being around before, but on top of that is a huge orange peel and other citrus note assortment. In the mouth is more of the same, maybe with the caramel hanging back a bit further and the orange peel mixed with some dirtiness, really a great hop profile that's a little different than the centennial bombs I'm most familiar with like Two-Hearted. The body is on the thin side of medium with a big bitter finish. It goes down really fast and my two bottles were gone quickly. One of the great fake session brews of the Upper Midwest, at least those that I've had experience with, and something of a high-water mark for pale ales.","EricCioe","Mar 21, 2011"

There's a nice citrus smack to the scent that carries on to the taste. There's a bitter / sour grapefruit taste that hits me pretty hard as well.

Poured yellow-orange with a two and a half finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, chocolate, citrus, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty excellent brew. Very well balanced and complex. Not too much missing on this one.

There are some hints on the nose of caramel, but they aren't too strong. The taste is interesting, as it is a combination of hop fruitiness and a slight nutty background. The pale malt is still rather hidden behind both of those flavors.

The taste has an initially sharp bitterness but turns into some citrus orange and light pine. As the beer warmed up the bitternes mellowed out and I could taste more sweet caramel flavors. Had the pleasure of enjoying this beer with freshly grilled Alaskan King Salmon and Asparagus. It added another element to my dinner. This beer borders on the realm of a single hopped IPA but is less over the top than its hoppier cousin and the bigger Imperial IPAs. However, it has less pronounced fruit flavors then the bigger IPAs. It is well balanced and a very versatile beer when it comes to pairing it with food.

Also get a lot of hops, but not nearly as much as DC. The citrus fruits are there, but not very ""in your face."" This smell is more well balanced than DC. Taste is very sugary sweet up front, then some citrus fruitiness (i also get hints of cherry), followed by the hop bitterness. This is just an amazing pale ale. The mouthfeel is chewier than most pale ales I've had, but keeps an AMAZING drinkability. I wish they sold this here in California. I'm so spoiled after these last two nights with DC last night and now AK tonight (got 1 of each as extras in a trade).

Disappeared pretty quick to leave almost no head and minimal lacing; the bottle wasn't dated, no idea how fresh this is. Smells of citrus hops right off the bat, pretty grapefruity I'd say. Taste is right there too, quite hoppy and bitter up front but that sweet warming malt comes in there to finish it off nice and a bit dry.

This beer is unique - nothing else I can compare it to. The hops and bitterness are forward. There is citrus in there and sweet malts that kick in part way through. By that or whatever means, the bitterness goes and is only faint in the finish. Refreshing. It has a light mouthfeel and good carbonation. At 6% and a warm day, could delve into this more, if I had the chance. Nice.","regspeir","May 06, 2010"

Pours a clear copper color with a massive rocky off white head that has great retention and impressive strings of clumpy lacing. Aroma is very rich, full of bready malt and grapefruit hops like an IPA, impressive balance. Hop bitterness grabs you from the beginning, unusual for an APA but is supported by a strong biscuit malt backbone and finishes slightly sweeter with smooth citrus hops. Medium thick body with moderate carbonation and a smooth dry finish result in a very hoppy, drinkable APA.

The aroma is strong and full of citrus and pine, some nuttiness and burnt caramel. The taste hits you with pine hops up front but then cools off with some malt balance in the middle and finishes with a great bitter bite.

Aroma is wonderfully balanced between the sweet caramel, and bready malts and the piney citrusy hops. If this is any indication of the flavor I'm in for a real treat. Oh yeah, great bitterness on this one, lots of grapefruit and pine, sweet at first, but bone dry on the finish. This is about as perfectly balanced as you can an APA, but I feel like this one is borderline IPA. Medium bodied, ample carbonation. Just an all around great APA (if you can call it that). This would slightly edge out SNPA for the standard on which all others APAs are judged.","KeefD","Nov 26, 2009"

Delicate lacing is left on the glass clear to the bottom. Big, pungent, massive, are all adjectives that could be used to describe the citrus hop aroma coming from this beer. It is not all hops however, as there is some sweetness from the malt as well. The flavor features the hops well. Grapefruit and orange come to mind. Bitterness is high. I am not a big fan of the malt bill. Overlly sweet in my opinion. I have knocked the scores of other beers of having similar sweetness, so I will knock this one down as well. A very good body and carbonation. It feels substantial without weighing down the palate. Nice texture. This almost lived up to my expectations. Just a little to sweet for my tastes. The bitterness and ABV limits drinkability as well.","morimech","Nov 14, 2009"

Not much, just a little. Taste was great. Quite possible the best I've had of this style yet. Amazingly smooth and well balanced blend of a dry caramel malt with some hop bitterness.

It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a clean, tropical bitter aftertaste. Overall this is fantastic. It meets the hype. The super clean and tropical taste meets my ideal for a pale ale or IPA. It had nice body also, and was very easy to drink.

4.15,-2.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Alpha King pours a reddish amber with minimal head. I wish I had multiple bottles to see if that was the case with just this pour, but nope. The foam resides quickly after giving a good show for a few seconds and then proceeds to lace the glass as I continue to drink. The smell has a certain fruit characteristic to it and makes Alpha King smell kind of bitter. It's very reminiscent of an IPA actually in its smell, which made me check the bottle (the only bottle I have) to see if it in fact was an IPA in which in fact it was not, it's a pale ale; welcome to obvious statements by Josh. Alpha King actually has a very present hops flavor which I quite enjoy. The moderately bitter fruit taste, grapefruit, blends well with the malts that it makes me wish Three Floyd's distributed to Missouri. I really enjoy this beer, it reminds me of going to see Royal's Baseball games with my Dad when I was little kid. Except neither of us were drinking and this beer wouldn't be in the memory and the Royal's probably lost, not characteristic of this beer.

This tastes much more like an IPA then just a pale ale. The flavor is very hoppy but, not a hop bomb at all. The malt is well balanced with the hops making for a super drinkable beer. There is a orange peel sour/sweetness that comes out as well. The mouhfeel is awfully pleasant. Medium body with a nice creamy texture. This is a top beer on my list.

The aroma is piney hops, grapefruit? and caramel. Pretty good smell to it. Taste is really great. Piney, bitter about halfway through but not nearly as bitter as some other beers which is good in this particular beer. Also their is fruit in there as well, grapefruit?

It's darker than most IPAs, and while yes it is very hoppy, it's not super bitter or dry. It really has an excellent ""hop efficiency", yes I just made that up. Basically I mean that the hops used in this beer seem like they go a long way and the utmost flavor is achieved from the ingredient, therefore it's not overloaded with extra hops or clouded by other ingredients trying to balance out the hops.

4.47,4.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"Pours with a beautiful creamy head. Good lacing. A light amber color, my favorite color for a hoppy ale. The smell is centennial, you know citrus, kind of pungent. There is also a bit of breadiness if you seek it out. A brilliant smell. The taste is great. A bit bitter, but talk about balance! There is a sort of nutty, biscuity malty taste under the hops. And the hops are just like it smells, refreshing bitterness with grapefruit flavor. You can also detect the tiniest grassiness in the taste, which I enjoy. You get a hit of carbonation with each drink, pretty straightforward in its delivery, which is very enjoyable. The taste lingers, and actually feels a bit sweeter after the initial bitter feeling. This could be dangerous. For an APA, 6.00 could catch up with you quickly. But it would be possible to drink quite a lot of these quickly.

Much darker in color than I would have guessed with a frothy head that left a nice stache on your face. Slightly hoppy smell with tones of citrus. Great classic pale ale flavor.

Shows a hazed light amber in the glass with a light covering of white head that is dying fast. Smells of strong flowery hop, dark caramel, toffee, orange, and pine - hops dominate the nose. Big, bright flowery hop flavor to start complimented with some orange peel, moving into pine and finishing with caramel and lemon. Medium carbonation and body, and a nice drinker for fans of the humulus lupulus. A very hop forward pale with a higher than average caramel malt character. I would have to say one of the finer examples of an American Pale.","kkosmoski","Dec 10, 2008"
4.48,5.2,4.5,4,5,4.5,4,"It's suprisingly dark for a ""pale ale"" and this coupled with the intense hoppy aromas let's you know you are dealing with a serious brew. Taste is burly with sharp flavors up front and smooth on the finish. For some reason this reminds me of Stone's Ruination, and yes, I know the styles are different. Maybe it's just the up front machismo that both of those beers deliver. Whatever the case, this is a fantastic beer. Of the 3F's that are available all the time, I put this right behind Gumballhead. On tap, this actually gets the slight edge, the Gumballhead seems to shine a little brighter out of the bottle. Either way, that is a potent one-two punch from the crew up in Munster, one that can stand up to any brewer in the nation.","SwiftyMcBeer","Dec 09, 2008"

The off white head was fluffy, laced well and retained well too. Great looking brew. The aroma was bright and hoppy, lots of citrus, some floral notes and slightly resinous. The taste was equally spot-on for the style, first a bitter hop bite followed by grapefruit and lemon zest. Behind that was the deeper malt balance, biscuity and solid along with some pine. As I continued to sample it the hops developed more nuances, orange zest, kumquat and hemp or it's smokable cousin. Quite complex and yet approachable like that cute, late 20's, school-teacher you want to chat up at the end of the bar. The mouthfeel was smooth, medium bodied and it finishes crisp.

4.1,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Another extra from bgramer; an unbelievably generous trader (thanks Brendan). Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a translucent copper red; excellent clarity. Tight, off-white head approached the rim of the pint before reducing its volume in half within about 30 seconds. Cap eventually settled into a thin semi-consistent skim with strands of watery lacing spattered around the walls of the glass. Aromas of floral, piney hops immediately hits the nose. Taste consistent with nose with a strong grapefruit character that leaves a lingering bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a distinct tingle across the tongue. This is an excellent representation of the APA style and I can see why it is a Three Floyds flagship brew, as such, I tried to be true to the style in my rating; however, a little too hoppy for my preference. If you are a fan of the style, this is definitely a brew to measure all other APAs against.","Jwale73","Jul 19, 2008"

This beer pours a Sienna brown, and the hints of red come through pretty generously when held to the light and the big frothy white head left sticky lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is citrusy hops with lemon in the forefront and nice sweet bready malts coming thorough on the back end. The taste is really complicated. The obvious citrusy and piney hops come through but subtle hints of caramel, anise and rye for some reason come out to me. These tastes are not what I would normally pick out in a APA but man, every single flavor is pretty precise to me. Weird. The mouthfeel is full for an APA and leaves a nice coating on the mouth. This is a great APA, my only knock is it seems a bit hopped for a standard APA, almost more like a mild IPA.","hwwty4","Jul 10, 2008"

There is a pleasing bitterness to the end of the beer; the bitterness comes across a bit strong at first, but settles out quite nicely after more drinking.

A strong hop aroma did not translate into an overwhelming hoppy taste, which I was glad of since the Kong almost destroyed my tastebuds. It was a clean, crisp tasting pale ale.

Tastes of grapefruit covered with table sugar. The hop bitterness that follows is actually icing on the cake. I'm so enjoying drinking this one that I find it hard to write.

Poured an orange/amber with a thin head that faded to a ring that stuck around. Smells of fruity apricot, cherry, a touch of rhubarb, with citrus as a top note. The taste is beautifully balanced and fruity,similar flavors as those found in the aroma, with cherry, vanilla, and citrus being especially pronounced. Nice hoppy bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, perfectly carbonated, a little rich. My absolute favorite session beer.I would have this around all the time if it were available in my area.","Georgiabeer","Jan 12, 2008"

Smell is a wonderful harbinger of what is to come. VERY hoppy, mainly citrus. If I thought that the nose was hoppy, it was nothing compared to how it actually tasted. This bad boy is like a hop bomb. Amazing. The hop flavors actually come at you harder and faster after you swallow, kind of like when a roller coaster goes down the first big hill. Thicker on the mouthfeel than most pale ales, though this is definitely a good thing. With such a low ABV, this is easily sessionable. One of my new favorites, especially when I'm craving hops.","atrus138","Jan 11, 2008"

A good dose of spiciness in there too. Taste is likewise, only stronger. Powerful from both ends, with a nice balance to the hops and malt. How an APA should taste. Feel is solid, well carbonated.

The taste is pleasantly bitter and refreshing, one of my favorites to drink on a hot day. Caramel and a touch of alcohol are present as the beer warms up a bit.

The taste offers caramel and pale malt sweetness that balances the bitterness while it lasts. The piney and citrusy hops detected in the nose dominate the taste with a strong hop bite.

Awesome nose on this one, very bitter hop aroma, grapefruit, pine, pineapple, with a nice balancing malt aroma to it. Taste was more of the same. Piney hops, mild citrus fruit notes, and somewhat grainy. Very well balanced in my opinion, mild carbonation, and some well hidden alcohol. Mouthfeel was full bodied, thick, and pleasant.

The smell was very hoppy and citric (either grapefruit or tangering). Really had more of a IPA smell than an APA as mentioned in other reviews. Definitely set the table for what to expect.

Starts off with the grapefruit then the pale malt comes through and blances it out so well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. So clean in the mouth.

Maybe its the age- I can't imagine I have a bottle at its peak of freshness. First time trying, so I risked the purchase in my excitement not knowing its age. The hops are there, just in weird muted kind of way. given the rep of FFF, I was expecting more. Truthfully, pass the SNPA, as this pale ale doesn't match the benchmark classic american pale that is Sierra Nevada. I would love a chance to try fresh on tap or bottle.

Very sweet smell, like orange sherbert or candy. Very nice and plesing to the nose, smells like it will be a winner. Taste struck me as odd, after all the sugary itrus in the smell, none really came through in the taste. There was a strong bitter hop presence, providing lots of IBU's however it was more of a pine,resiney type of hops, rather then the sweet candy orange that came through at first.

Tawny amber-gold with a moderately-sized, creamy, just off-white head and undying sheets of lacing. A lovely hyperactive citrus aroma greets my nose, with tangerine, grapefruit, and bergamot predominating. There is also a distinct scent to the bouquet that is not at all unlike high-grade cannabis, all sticky and resinous. Exceptional aroma for me, if only due to the affective evocations it elicits. Big pine and citrus flavors with a crystal malt sweetness in the very back. Bitterness is the dominant characteristic of the taste, but it's not rough (so I'm guessing no Chinooks in this one). Lip-smacking, but not for the faint of heart, at least as regards hoppiness. Fairly light in body; there's a stickiness to the mouthfeel that borders on syrupy but doesn't quite get there.

In the mouth, there is more pine, but more reminiscent of the wood itself as opposed to the fragrant needles. The citrus notes become more distinctive and remind me of tangerine, mandarin orange, and grapefruit. The hop flavors are substantial, but their sharpness is blunted by the equally assertive malt presence. The bitterness is about on par with the style, which is somewhat of a disappointment considering the name of the beer.

Massive flavor of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice and orange peels. There is a moderate caramel malt backbone, yet it is certainly second fiddle to the three letter h word.

The hops are predominate in this brew and are very citrusy. This is a bit over the top to be classified as a pale ale, this is definitely a very nice American IPA. As the grapefruit flavor dies down, a nice doughy malt flavor comes through and then ends with a nice bitter. Mouthfeel of this beer is medium and nicely carbonated. I will have to say this is another great beer by 3 Floyds and I would drink it very regularly if it was available locally. This beer tastes like the Dreadnaughts little brother.

More on the grassy side than citrusy side for me. Nice long lasting bittering finish. No sweetness here.

Very chewy with the amount of hops, but also little special additions of sweetness along with the hops. When its swallowed, the first 3 seconds have mostly a malty taste, then the hops take over and command the rest. These two tastes are surprisingly well balanced for such a big beer.

Even more strongly hopped in the taste, though again the malt base waits patiently underneath and asserts itself more noticeably as your palate adjusts to the hops.

The spiciness wasn't as prevalent with the second sip, which hinted at various citrus juices. Later, a light maltiness barely peeks through. No alcohol to be found anywhere in the beer, and even at 6.0% ABV. I'm thinking about sessioning this one. A creaminess appears further into the glass.

The scent of citrus here is collosal; more like fresh squeezed oranges rather than the rind. Some faint pale malt aroma lingers somewhere in obscurity. Toasted crystal malt and vienna upfront. Semi-dry aftertaste, herbal/citrusy cascade does an excellent job of balancing the sweetness. Low carbonation and medium body allow a hint of slickness, but it's really just enough to keep the mouthfeel less than crisp.

After transfering my IIPA to secondary and getting a good whiff of cascade and centennial hops, this beer comes off as a hop tea, the aroma as fresh as those hops. A little sweetness is also detected in the aroma, but American hops dominate. Flavor starts out sweet with the hop flavor dominating. Lots of complexity in hop and malt flavor swirls around the mouth ending in a stab of bitterness. This beer is almost too perfect in the realm of APAs or IPAs whatever you want to call it. I've yet to experience one like it, but I hope I can make one damn close.","dreadnatty08","Jul 13, 2006"

Complex taste of sweet oranges up front, quickly followed with bitter grapefruit,a little biscuity and then a dry slightly peppery finish. Mouthfeel is also very good, crisp and clean with a nice mild dryness in the finish. Definitely pushes the envelope of the Pale Ale style category in a very good way.

A very nice semi-clouded shade. Thorough lacing too. Explosive aromatics. One of the most full bouquets I've encountered with any style. And lively too, quite vibrant. Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth, drinkability is at a super high level. A polished mouthfeel leaves the flavour almost undetectable for a second, then you can feel the hops come back and coat your mouth. A great deal of citrus character. Different hops come out but the malt is blended in well enough it keeps this beer level without interfering with the hops. In other words, this taste and smells (and well overall, just plain IS) ultra hoppy - but it doesn't feel like it! Immense job with their flagship beer.

Several aromas come through from citrusy, floral, and earthy scents, with a slight scent of malt. The taste is amazing, very well balanced. It starts with some malt and barley flavors, then the hops begin to announce themselves midway to the end of each taste. The mouthfeel has the consistancy of skim milk, watery, but it does have some body to the texture. Overall, this beer is incredibly drinkable, great taste, wonderful aroma.

I also noticed grapefruit as others have mentioned, there is also a slight maltiness in the nose, but hardly noticeable. On to the taste, the grapefruit taste came in strong, slight caramel for a second, but finishes with a lemon zest, a hint of pine is present throughout entire taste. Medium bodied and average carbonation level, pretty slick. Just a flat out good beer here, one of my favorites to keep around.

It pours a beautiful clear copper with a long lasting rocky off-white-head that left lots of clumpy lace. Aroma is in your face citrus, iodine and notes of pine with some faint swet caramel out there fighting to be noticed. Taste is desert dry with strong grapefruit and juniper obliterating the palate in an agressive but not unpleasing manner.

Aroma is fresh citrus and floral hops, along with hints of sweet maltiness present, smells very fresh and clean. Taste is exceptionally balanced between the citrusy hops and the caramelly sweet hops that stand out in this brew, just enough fresh hop oils/ hop resins to create a nice appreciative bitterness that is kept in check by the sweet malt.

It is a very tasteful and well controlled array of luscious malt sweetness and a mild but nonetheless, dare I say, dazzling hop bouquet. Great citrus notes and nice herbal impressions. The taste shows wonderful synergy betwixt green and grain. The sweetness slides in and swirls into a fruity citrus notion. Everything seems to be lightly expressed with the sum total of flavours leading into complexity. One may find a very subdued grapefruit as a subtle hint, or vague orange inflections, or muted grass and pine. The possibilities are many and intriguing with a refreshingly dry finish that begs the thought of orange peel bitterness and a lemon squeeze. All of these culminating while adrift in the well scaled structure of the malt profile. The body is model. Light but full enough to please the palate and float the myriad flavours.

Taste is very bitter, but has an average citrusy APA taste to it with mild malt flavors. Mouthfeel is a little acidic and is highly carbonated. It leaves a very bitter after taste in your mouth that seems to last forever.

It never ceases to amaze me how powerful that first whiff is. No detectable alcohol. And now to taste. Ahhh, the creamy smoothness is the first thing you notice. Perfect carbonation and body. All the citrus fruits in the world are there, with the orange flavor really standing out next to a little bit of grapefruit and lemon. The malt adds some balance to this brew as a nice bready bisuity aspect, though it is definitely hoppier than your average pale ale. As others have said, it almost crosses the line into an IPA, but the hops in no way overpower the malt in this beer. The finish is extraordinary. Hops all the way, though it's not too bitter. I could drink this all night. In fact, I might just do that now. In case you couldn't tell, this is my favorite APA.","PatYoda","Jul 19, 2005"

Hops hit you the second the beer taps your tongue, and they leave their joyful mark in a linger aftertaste. Although this is a definite hop monster, it's reasonably smooth and has a tinge of sweetness. There are hints in the beer I didn't like, perhaps something about the yeast. There was an imbalance in this beer that spoke of lack of control. I had an entire six pack during the past week, and I reacted to each bottle differently. Is it me, or the beer? I think it's the beer, because I had several cans of Dale's Pale Ale during the same period, and they were consistent.","GnomeKing","Jul 16, 2005"

Smells like pine and citrus, and slightly sweet, maybe like caramel. The taste is outstanding, finding a nice balance between hops and malts. Hints of grapefruit at first with a nice, earthy aftertaste. A pleasant hop flavor lingers long after swallowing. Leaves a nice, slightly slick feeling in the back of the mouth.

Typical PA color and head on the pour, but right away you can detect the hops in the nose. Taste is complex and incredible.

I can smell it across the room! Really, this beer has some sort of candy-like smell and taste due to Three Floyds malts. They give a somewhat sweet caramel like taste which nicely compliments this very hoppy pale ale. Definitely NOT normal! By far the hoppiest pale ale (which isn't very pale either) I've had to date.

When you first take a drink, you are once again given a pretty substantial taste of malt, but that is soon replaced by a rush of hop taste. Floral, citrus, bitter, some pine too.

The stain smell also came through the nose. The flavor was a nit tarnish at first. But after I let it breath the hops really started to come through. A full bouquet of flowers. The malts are slightly sweet, but balanced nicely with the hops. The mouthfeel is not crisp, quite heavy on the tongue, probably thanks to the hops and high ABV.

Im also hoping that this appears in draught at my local watering holes. Its been some time since Ive had this (I bought a case about 18 months ago at Shangys). Somehow, I remember those examples as being more pleasantly drinkable, with better balance, and a fuller flavor. Perhaps these are very fresh. Also, although the Bros. dont like this, I have to review this as an IPA rather than a Pale Ale. If I were honest, Id have to rate this low as a Pale Ale, as it really doesnt deliver those flavors. I noted at the time of my Ithaca Pale Ale review that it couldnt possibly compare to SNs Harvest and 3Fs Alpha King and I think that still stands. Still, this is fine beer that Im happy to have in NJ.","Dantes","Mar 08, 2005"

The nose is citrous with some fruit, as well as a slight floral quality. The taste is bold yet very refined. Although generously hopped, there is some good toasted malt to even things out. Some caramel and spice add their balance to the citrous explosion of hops. Slightly thicker mouthfeel than some other pale ales also helps to counter the sharp hops bite. The toasted malt flavor sticks around with the aftertaste, blending wonderfully with the hop oils in the finish. The most striking facet of this ale is the dance between hops and malt, without one dominating too much.","BeerFink","Feb 28, 2005"

There is a nice malty sweetness that complements the hop. No sign of the 7+% abv, as this goes down so easy. This is classified as a pale ale, but it's one the most unique beers I've had in recent memory.

Starts rich and malty, with darker notes of fruit and dare I say, a bit of sweet chocolate? Then come the piney, grapefruit hop flavors, giving way to a dry, sweet malty finish. Wowzers. Balanced.

The first sip was full of juicy, sugary and caramel malt flavors laced with heaps of spicy, citrusy hops. The body is fairly thick, but doesn't keep me from taking larger sips. The alcohol does slow me down. I don't recall this beer being so strong. The lasting bitterness stay with you for a long time. The finish is not only quite bitter, but much drier than I remember. (I really like a dry finish.) All the complexities of this beer, the sugary, almost tropical fruit flavors that seem to meld with the citrusy hops and caramel malt are truly wonderful.

Following some malts make themselves present giving a nice caramel and toffee like flavors but the hops just crash right in again showing that they are the king of this beer. More flavors of an assortment of fruits and some oily piney flavors just coat the top of my mouth. Literally this beer just sticks on the pallate and won't let go. This beer finishes spicy and hoppy with just a nice zing to it that makes it killer Pale ale, not for the faint hearted I must say.

Ooh, quite bitter; this beer finishes with a drying intense bitterness. Overall this beer is only slightly sweet, it has a light body & is focused entirely on the hop component. The hops are over the top, but perhaps it is missing some hop flavor. There is lots of bitterness, but it feels like it is missing some balancing hop nectar flavor. Underlying the hop attack there seems to be some nuttiness, as well as some caramel notes. This beer is all about the hop attack, not much malt here, so if you don't like hops stay away.

The alpha king pours out a subdued orange/light copper color, topped with a healthy head that's just a bit off white. The carbonation in my Alpha King was very present, not lacking at all as I have heard some say in the past. Aroma is a curious blend of grapefruit citrus and pine resiny hops, with just a bit of sweetness and malt creeping in. Taste is very boldly hoppy, but surprisingly malty as well. Much more balanced than I expected, the bitterness of the hops blends well into a caramely malt sweetness and a bit of piney hop flavor is left of the back of your tongue with the nice crisp finish.

I'm writing this after my second bottle; if I start the review the same sitting (or day) I can tell it's a winner. The mouthfeel was extremely crisp with a slight citrus twang, but definitely not that syrupy taste that sometimes lingers.

Much more alcoholic than expected for a pale ale so this is not what you would call a session beer, but a nice way to mix things up and kick your taste buds around a bit. The unrefined hops make it something to drink towards the end of the night when you are ready to not taste anything else.","GreatPondBrewer","Nov 02, 2003"

The smell hints at pineapple and grapefruit, with a good dose of hops as well. A very full smell. The taste starts a little sweet and malty, but ends with a fury of hops. This brew reminds me of Burning River, because both are pale ales that have lots of IPA characteristics. The body is fairly thick and strong for a pale ale. The drinkability is really good for a 7.25% brew. A fantastic pale that works anytime!","SheepNutz","Oct 29, 2003"

Taste: Rich balance between the full hop bitterness some pine cone like and earthy tones available to the palate the juicy robust malt backbone also is here teasing the taste buds just so good. Mouthfeel: Medium body not sticky but texture just enough to let the sweet maltiness and hop oils run across the palate with some consistency. Drinkability: Freaking amazin' so damn drinkable perfect with a sixer and a ball game on the tube just one of those beers, I personally love the Dreadnaught but this is so damn good and palatable for a flagship beer they better never touch the recipe.","WVbeergeek","Oct 29, 2003"

Laced very well. Damn lovely nose, hoppy(!) acidic, bold grapefruit, hints of pine very distant caramel malt. Powerful. This is the Alpha King of all Pale Ales, the bitterness is not as assertive as the bouquet would indicate; it is might tasty though. Oh, dont get me wrong, it is bitter. The maltiness plays more that a secondary roll, Id say the relationship of malt and hops is 40/60. Yes, the hops steal the show, grapefruit rinds, acidic, zesty, vaguely piney. Flowery too. Savor this one, its hoppy enjoyment and complexities only seem to grow better! Medium body with light carbonation helps produce a silky smooth mouthfeel.

The hops produce a marvelous floral aroma at the front, sweet malt in the middle, fresh crisp ending to the nose with a semi-sweet malt start and the middle a moderate feel on the taste buds. Finish is lenient in acidity with the hops dynamic in their spiciness, WOW, they make your whole sensory system sit up and take notice, dry and long lasting aftertaste.

Im not talking about hefeweizen, but theyre there. Great hop taste and bitterness which is kinda implied by a name like Alpha King. Usually with a hopping like this one would expect to find a sticky malt body, but remember this is a pale ale not an IPA. The malt provides precarious balance to the big hop flavor and assertive bitterness. The hop flavor is rather complex and changes throughout the mouthfuls. There is a little apple late in the finish. Looking back on this brew, it seems like this is about as close to a big, homebrewed PA as you are going to find out there with the hops, haze, and esters. This is one beer I wish would come to the Garden State.","yen157","Oct 23, 2003"

4.27,0.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,5,"Lightly turbid dark copper hue. Topped by a solid, stiff, cream white head that leaves steadfast Belgian lace. The aroma is comprised of pronounced pink grapefruit with sprinkled with hints of acidic lemon zest. Overshadowed, non descript light lovibond caramel malt tapers the pungency slightly and couples with understated hints of pine to lend a sweet, sappy spruce counterpart to the dominant citrus character. Obviously hop driven and very welcoming aromawise. Brusque snap of simple caramel sweetness initially in flavor is nearly overrun by a barbed, yet agreeable melange of grapefruit flesh and barely burnt biscuit. A suggestion of candied lemon surfaces mid palate along with rounding hints of toffee, and manages to facilitate a lingering, rich, nearly balancing malt presence. A balmy, grassy, dry hop derived component surfaces late and extends the lemony citrus theme in a fresh lemongrass like nature. A bit skimpy in body to support the pervasive hop character, but certainly passably dextrinous in mouthfeel. Finishes with a deceptively light and balanced mix of clean hop bitterness and stately caramel sweetness. Alpha King is a unique and highly enjoyable American brew. Its overall flavor profile precariously teeters between an American pale and a northwest IPA, but manages to find balance. The quintessential sugared grapeftuit impression is there, but never becomes cloying. Reminescent of a Hop Ottin / Liberty Ale hybrid. Superlatively drinkable, and ominously so at that.","marc77","Oct 02, 2003"

4.3,0.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer poured amber/orange colored that was clear and well carbonated. It created a creamy beige colored foam that lasted the whole way to the last sip and more. The consistency of the foam was watery (as it moved fairly well), thick, sticky and creamy. It created a sheet like lace on the sides to about ½ way down the glass then slowly broke into a spotted lace to the bottom of the glass. The aromas were dominated by hops, fresh (just harvested), then aromas of grass, citrus (grapefruit), pine trees and sap, and some malt soon began to mix in to the nose of the beer. The flavors that rolled over my tongue were also dominated by hops. Tastes of dry hops, fresh hops, pine needles, floral hops, fresh grass, citrus fruit (grapefruit), and some malt at the end. The aftertaste was mainly of hops, some citrus, some fresh, with malt tones, but light. Semi dry appeal and not overly bitter. The body was on the light to medium side. I did notice that as I came to the finish and the beer was allowed to warm, it became thicker and the malt flavors seemed to become more pronounced.

Instead of bittering, the hops bolster the sweetness of the malts. Interesting effect. Kind of like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale crossed with Magic Hat #9. But sweeter than both those beers. Top-notch mouthfeel, creamy frothy and just a hint of rawness. This should appeal to not only the hophead but the fruit beer fan, as well as middle of the road drinkers looking for adventure.

The yeast didn't bother me while drinking, but it wasn't a very appetising (sp?) sight.  Grapefruit and floral hops dominate the oh-so-wonderful aroma.  Pretty damn hoppy for an APA (really closer to IPA).  Wonderful bitterness in this beer.  It's a must for hopheads.  Nice thick mouthfeel.  This ale, truly, is ""meat, drink, and cloth"" - it's all one needs in life.  At 7+ abv, this is a pretty damn drinkable beer.","Viking","Mar 28, 2002"
3.15,-26.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Hazy orange tinted amber color.  Frothy white head.  A bit of a pungent hop scent.  An oily hop taste present.  Quite bitter.  More like an IPA though.  An average pale ale.  Tastes more like a British-style pale ale to me.  American styles have more of a floral and herbal aroma reminiscent of the NW hop varieties.  To me, this one doesn't possess that characteristic.  I see I'm not in agreement with most on this beer, but SN, Summit and Big Sky are a lot better in my opinion.","Bighuge","Mar 24, 2002"
4.65,9.2,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Ahhh, now this is what an APA is supposed to be. Golden orange color with a thick white head that lasts throughout. Floral aroma and knock-you-on-your-ass grapefruity hoppiness. Delightful. Now I am a huge Sierra Nevada fan, but this definitely tops their pale ale. Nicely done!","mophie","Mar 19, 2002"
4.23,-0.7,4,3.5,5,3.5,4,"As someone who loves American hop flavor but thinks that lemon tones in wheat beers are sour, I was a little worried that the label was in tropical colors and promised citrus.  One short sip later, my fears were allayed, we're talking grapefruit hops...this is a truly good American Pale, and I can echo the grapefruit comments of VENOM and others...yes, better than Sierra Nevada, to me...only the similar but even  more hopped Summit Extra Pale is a better example of this style, in my opinion.","ADR","Feb 21, 2002"
4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Certainly smokes more well-known APA examples like Sierra Nevada. Pick some up...you will not be disappointed.","cokes","Feb 20, 2002"
4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice herbal nose and fruity malt palate, especially towards the back where some real juicy flavors come through.  Hop flavor is mellow but the bitterness is solid.  Not the cleanest pale ale, but its really well rounded and has a deliciously plush mouthfeel.","bcm119","Nov 12, 2001"

4.24,-0.5,4,5,4,4,4,"Hops had a great citrus aroma, but I was a little disappointed that the citrus did show up in the finish, which seemed a little on the harsh, quinine-like side.","Brent","Aug 07, 2001"
4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Well built and one of the best ales in the US. Hop character is above the rest ... a must buy.","BeerAdvocate","Jul 22, 2000"
