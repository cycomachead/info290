"O - Overall a decent Pale Ale.  Not the best I've ever had but not anywhere close to the worst either.  I could easily down 1 or 2 of these with dinner.  3.75/5"

"I am drinking this 3 months before its best by date. The nose begins with s slight tartness that quickly dissipates bringing forward caramel, light biscuit and hop notes. It pours amber with a slight haze under a white, a” fluffy, persistent cap that produces good lace.  Malt and light fruits roll over the tongue to finish with a moderately bitter hop accent. It has a smooth, creamy texture, medium body, and moderate carbonation. Well balanced and easy to drink."

"Cloudy deep orange in body with white head that never leaves. Aroma of citrus, honey, light fruit, sweetened cereal. Tastes of citrus but no rind, light fruity notes, mild mint, honey sweetness, and toned down bitterness. Light bodied with light carbonation. Lacking some body but nice and sessionable. I could tank these all day."

"Now this is what an APA should be.  Perfectly balanced, not too hoppy but a ton of flavor.  This beer needs to be your designated BBQ beer, just as you would expect from a brewery in Kansas City.  You can enjoy this one year-round, and I do.  It's Boulevard's first-ever beer and still the best.  I'm a Colorado beer guy mostly but this one finds its way into my fridge fairly often."
"I'm not a pale ale guy but this is a smooth drink that can definitely satisfy."

"Boulevard Pale Ale has an extremely high carbonation factor for a pale ale. It is not a good mouthfeel but tastes overall okay. The carbonation is almost too much. This beer albeit different is perfectly predictable.Good but not great just what you expect from the ""Show Me State."""

"I have drank literally hundreds of these beers.. So I figured I should review it.. Boulevard is a GREAT brewery with some of the best tasting beers probably in the World. That being said I have tried many many different brews of theirs and this is one of the best. It use to be less consistent with taste but I actually called them about it months ago and it seems to be fixed... I even broke a case on accident once because of their weak cardboardish packing. I told them about it and they changed the packaging and sent me money for another 12 pack!... I love this company and this beer and will be a customer of theirs till the day I die. One thing about this beer I have found with NO other beer EVER.. I find if I fall asleep and a beer has been opened.. I can wake up and even after being open all night. I can take a drink and it still tastes like a fresh beer and even has carbonation!!! That blew me away, most beer is crap after being left open.. This is one of the greatest brewed beers in the World IMO."

"O Good APA. Nothing special. But that's kinda how the style is. Either it's great and people are bitching that it should be classified ""IPA"" or its a bland run-o-the mill ale. This sits somewhere in between. Try it. You won't hate it."

"Rich toasty malt balanced by a hop bite with taste of citrus. A real beer, I rate a brewery by how well they do the pale ale, a pilsner, a wheat. They have to get those right. The Double Imperial IPA is gravy after that. . Boulevard got this right. Boulevard was the first micro besides Sam Adams available in my area. They always have a soft spot in my heart."

"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"this is what an American pale ale should taste like to me. its light, crisp, hoppy, drinkable, and wonderful when ice cold. the nose is well hoppy, bitter and bitey, with a lighter malt profile and a floral and piney hop character. the crispness of this is what impresses me most. its packed with flavor, but its snappy in the finish, ultimately refreshing. sweeter grains up front with a glorious bright hop flavor that seems unfamiliar to me, not sure what varieties are used here, but it works. theres a juicy fruity vibe that is new to me here. the feel is the best, perfectly carbonated with the cleanest fastest finish I can remember in this style. whatever yeast is used here I would like to clone for my own brewing, it really makes the feel of this pale ale pop off. overall the best of boulevards standard releases. cool that they've found a way to make the most commonplace style of beer as interesting as this, its sessionable and a lot of fun."

"Pale ale pours a hazy golden color with very little head. There is a slightly hoppy aroma. The taste has some floral notes, and a grainy yeasty taste. A bit lighter of a taste, and not very bitter or dry. Overall this is a unquie pale ale, the yeasty flavors add a twist to this beer."

"A no nonsense pale, a bit perfumic smell."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a burnt orange color with a thin, rocky looking head that left lots of lacing. The aroma has a caramel base with nice hoppy tangerine and lemon flavors. It tastes of bitter lemon with biscuits, the most noticeable flavor is bell pepper. This beer is light with sharp carbonation and a slightly dry finish. I thought this was a good pale ale, and it was my first boulevard I ever had many years ago when I visited Keokuk, Iowa."
""
""
"O: It's a good pale ale, but nothing amazing. I'm happy to have tried this beer, but I don't think I'd seek it out again. However, if I was at a dive bar and this was one of the few beers on tap, I'd order it all day long."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-An OK APA but as it warms it takes a turn for the worse with the malt dominating. (Bottle was 2 months away from best by date)"
"O - The hops on the label are no joke--smells and tastes pretty hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little more delicate in flavor then I expected but this is a very enjoyable beer. The beer is quite easy to drink and could be sessionable."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a muddy orange amber with a slight head and light lacing. Orange light malt with light citrus. Finishes with a light malty, spicy flavor. Nice for a low ABV ale. Darker and more flavorful than I'd expect from a pale ale. Boulevard does a good job on these beers"
""
""
"O) Nice Pale Ale right here. Not as flavorful as some offerings, but if you're looking to knock back a sixer on the patio, or around the fire pit, this will do the job. Glad to recommend this beer."

"O: Not bad, but overall, middle of the pack."

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a little above average. Overall it was a pretty good beer of the style, pretty easy drinking and flavorful."
"3/2.5/3.5/2.5/4"
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber orange color with a decent head. Off-white head and good bubbling from carbonation. Nose is floral and citrus hops. Taste is fruity with more of a hop flavor. It is initially sweet malt with a nice hop bitterness mixed in that fades to a middle of roasted nuts. The finish is long and bitter-sweet with a faint alcohol warmth."
""
"O- As I said before, this is a staple in my fridge. Easy to get, and decently priced. A nice one to kick back relax and enjoy the game. An easy drinker."
""
""
"Overall - This is a good, solid beer. It won't blow your hair back or call your mom, but there certainly isn't anything wrong with it. Can likely be used as a session beer, and is also a good transition beer for trying to convert people to the craft beer scene, as it isn't too strong in any direction. Just a nicely made pale ale. I'd drink one of these any day."
""
"M: Finely textured, slightly creamy, and very carbonated."
""
""
""
""
"Taste: There is a slight hoppy bitterness which is complimented nicely by the sweetness that no longer seems fruity. The slight sweetness tones down the aftertaste bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is nicely balanced, with hops and malts working in tandem, neither side overpowering the other. This is a smooth-drinking, sessionable pale ale, and one worth repeatedly enjoying."

"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this is a solid beer with enough flavor and substance to make it worth pounding down for a long time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is just a so so beer in my opinion. Drinkable, but not memorable."
""
""
""
"O - overall, a solid beer. Nothing outstanding, but as I said above, a fairly decent example of the style and sessionable as well. I would definitely pick up a six pack for a barbecue or party."
"O: The beer is quite easy to drink and can be considered sessionable."
""
""
""

"I enjoyed this one, though there was an off-putting banana-like flavor that detracted from the experience. Worth trying but you can easily find better options."

"Boulevard Ale: At an airport waiting to depart I opted for the beer lunch. Boulevard was on tap. The body is straw yellow, translucent and very lightly carbonated. The head is pure white, very fine and did not last long. The aroma is subtle, and more fruity than malty. Very smooth drinking, this beer goes down easily. No robust flavor here, just a subtle malt taste and no sense of bitter or hop. I enjoyed this brew, and its easy going nature."
""
""
"An average beer. Nice and easy to drink, but not interesting or different."
""
""
""
""
"Drink- A good bit of bubbles with a nice malt presence and a nice bit of citrus make this a very tasty and easy to reach for brew."
"Overall: Not bad, but not that great. There are just too many good local APAs for me to reach for another of these."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. Again, a very solid boulevard brew that I really wish we got out here on the east coast."
"Even balanced pale, less ""american"" than others, but in a good way. Doesn't hammer you with hops. Good drinker."
"I picked up a Boulevard mixed twelve pack last week at Argonaut. This was one of the beers included in that box. Poured a nice amber color with a medium beige head. Aromas of grass, floral hops and a light breadiness. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of grass, resiny hops and caramel."
"Pours a burnt orange color with a thin, rocky looking head that left lots of lacing. The aroma has a caramel base with nice hoppy tangerine and lemon flavors. It tastes of bitter lemon with biscuits, the most noticeable flavor is bell pepper. This beer is light with sharp carbonation and a slightly dry finish. I thought this was a good pale ale, nothing special but there's nothing bad about it either."
"Overall: I think this is a very solid pale ale. It's body makes it very easy to drink and has a nice sweet character while still tasting like a pale ale."
"O- Middle of the road pale ale. Not bad by any stretch, but lacks any substantial factor to make me want more or keep this beer in my scope of pale ales. I would buy this for the right occasion if I had it in my market, but it's not something I'm sad to not have in market..."
"Finally done with this variety pack. What a ride... This stuff pours a mostly clear copper-amber topped by a dirty cream-white foam. The nose comprises light toffee mixed with mild orange peel. Such is all, and it's all pretty weak. The taste doesn't really change too much up, though now the citrus is ascendant. A slight hint of rubber permeates the background. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a kinda sad pale ale, frankly, and definitely a disappointing way to finish the pack."
"D: Really not very enjoyable.  I'm not one for pale ales to begin with, but this one seems a bit off and watered down.  Everything is muted, and there is an odd after-flavor that doesn't sit well with me.  Mouthfeel is pretty good, and it goes down easy enough, but it's not especially enjoyable.  This, to me, is the black sheep among the heard of great beers that Boulevard makes.  I know it's the flagship beer, but I think it might be time to tweak the recipe (... this coming from someone who doesn't homebrew at all :)"
"Poured into my ccb pint glass. Golden brown in color with decent carbonation but only a papertgin head to show for it Aroma is very light, hard to detect much in the nose but I do smell bready yeast and feint citric from the hops. Taste follows the nose, good balance between malt and hops. Just an average beer, nothing special here."
"Poured from the 12oz. bottle into a snifter w/ a nice off white head an color is of rusty brass. Kinda hard to describe. The nose is as you would expect. Mostly some nice citrus hops in the forefront. Nothing too exciting or out of the ordinary on a pale ale. Has some damn good lacing. Taste is bitter, citrus hops dominating, not much of a malt presence to it. Leans on the hop side of the balance in a good manner. Dry finish after scrubbing the palate. There's a little bit of a grapefruit component to the taste of this but not a lot. Mostly getting the hops. I've had this several times over & for some reason something seems a little off on this one. Can't quite put my finger on it. Mouthfeel is light. Overall, a very drinkable beer. Great on the hot summer days. A decent one to have in the regular rotation. Prosit!"
"aroma is light herbal hops, lots of wheat and grain, hints of grassy notes and herbals that blend with a light spiced rye note and a really well done light floral finish. perfectly drinkable this was simply an amazing pale to drink on the first 85 degree day. long finish of light hops and grains that rolls through slightly dry but clean and crisp."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into Bruery snifter into the sink. Pour is copper with some off-white head. The nose is bready malt/yeast with big perfume and grassy hops. Does not smell very good, actually. The taste is...not good. Again, perfumy, acidic, grassy, herbal, flowery, bready and all coming together in a poor way. The hoppiness is harsh, but not in a good way. There is an off-flavor that I am not ciceroney enough to identify (vegetal?). Mouthfeel is mostly fine. Carbonation is good, body is ok. Not an easy drinker for a pale ale, which is all wrong. Overall, had maybe 1/3 of a bottle then moved on."
"O - Not sure why this one gets low marks. I guess because its not a hop bomb. Or maybe I'm sentimental. This is one of the very 1st crafts I drank. You know what, its still a darn good beer if you ask me. Really miss not being able to get Boulevard regularly"
"O: Sort of a disappointing beer for what is usually a pretty easy style to brew."
"O: Not one I'll go out and buy myself with the number of beers that are out there, this one did not leave a lasting affect...."
"Overall, this isn't a terrible beer. It's just under flavored and bland."
"O- I really enjoyed the citrus flavors in this pale and coupled with the easy drinking could make this solid summer beer, there are others I would reach for first, but this is a beer I will def have again."
"Mediocre Pale Ale. Not my favorite of the Boulevard variety pack."
"Overall- A solid pale. Nothing makes this stand out from the pack, but there is certainly nothing wrong with it. A nice enjoyable thirst quencher."
"This was not the best PA I've had, and most definitely wasn't the worst. It was average, easy drinking, and great for refreshing me after moving a fridge. In St. Louis this is a tap or bottle option at a lot of places, which would be a welcome choice over any BMC product. However, you can spend a little more and get something that is slightly better."
"O- A decent, but hardly spectacular pale. Easily drinkable, but nothing all that memorable."
"O: This is a decent pale ale."
"O- not as bitter and hoppy as i would like. it might be nice for a change of pace once in a while, but i think that sierra nevada pale will still be my go to for the style."
"Pours burnt orange with a 2 and a half inch white fluffy head. Not much nose. Maybe alittle grass on the nose, some citrus, but not very strong. Tastes about the same as it smells, very light, not overly hoppy. Everything about this beer is light and mellow, however it works and is very drinkable."
"O- Overall, this is a very solid pale ale... comes close to giving Sierra Nevada a run for its money."
"O: I like what Boulevard brings to the table, but I'm not overly impressed with their Pale Ale. The hop/malt balance could use some adjusting, but overall a pretty good beer. Drinkable none-the-less."
"D: Very drinkable, not special."
"overall - solid flavors and great price low abv all on the plus side but the heavy body gets a whole pt deduction"
"Feel is mellow smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation."
"Pours hazy with a brownish copper color. One finger head that dissipated quickly with some latticing. Not much aroma at all. Tastes metallic, with hints of caramel. Maybe even a biscuit type taste. Definitely not flat, lots of carbonation. Not great, not terrible. I've had much better pale ales though, so I probably wouldn't get a six pack of this."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy amber color and produced a white head. A absolutely no lacing. Poor head retention. Aroma was malty. Malty backbone and a mild amount of hop smell. Malty and mineral taste. Earthy hop overtones. Slightly dry finish. Medium body. Below average pale ale. Just not much to talk about."
"Overall: Something is suspect with this beer. I can't get over the soapiness of it to give a better review (Yes it was a clean glass). I've had this beer last year and it tasted a lot better, well balanced with a lot of malt character. However, this beer is a drain pour. I would try again with caution."
"Drinkability is solid and it's a solid pal for sure!"
"D: Unexpectedly this beer is somewhat of a let-down. It seems to hedge its bets in approach to style, ultimately lacking in any really distinct character. Of even greater concern are the unappealing metallic and medicinal qualities. While neither is overpowering, they are two of the most memorable features about this beer."
"A very good pale. Nice flavor and smell. Very balanced and smooth. I do think there are many better pale ales out there, but for a BBQ or similar spring/summer gathering, Boulevard can't be beat. It's not as expensive as some other brands, but still holds up to a high standard of flavor and quality. Great Beer Boulevard Brewing!"
"Drinkability: A drinkable summer brew, but there are better APAs out there. A great choice at Kaufmann Stadium if you are in KC for a Royals game, however."
"D- This beer has a lower ABV which helps to the drinkability. Flavors were well balanced but the malts were a little too high for my liking overall. I would drink this one all the time if I was looking for a malt forward pale ale."
"Light bodied and fairly dry. Bitterness was actually more perceptible in the Pale Ale than Single Wide, it was a refreshing palate cleanse. Definitely a good burger or pizza beer."
"Overall this is very drinkable beer- hoppy enough to be refreshing and make you take note but not enough to slow you down, with enough caramely malt character to keep it from being one dimensioned. I would certainly have another!"
"(from notes - tasted April 2010)"
"Mouthfeel: Light bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. This beer goes down very easily and is definitely sessionable. A flavorful beer that isn't heavy or too much for the taste buds."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is somewhat faint, but what I do get is orange hops and biscuit malt. The flavor is more of the same with a lot of biscuit malt as well as some various hop flavor components such as orange, pine and grass. Low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"A great value at 7.50 a sixer, available all the time."
"D - Pretty good. Interesting enough to have another but wouldn't seek it out."
"D - Nothing wrong with this one, just not all that exciting, but it is a delicious pale ale."
"T- A nicely balanced, yet ultimately hop forward pale. Starts biscuity, but only briefly. Pine and orange rind come and try to steal the show. The finish has a slightly odd astringent flavor to it."
"A little bit bitter, not much hop feel to it. Seemed like a real light pale ale, just the slightest bit of caramel. Gritty at times, nothing up or down on this one, very straightforward, no nuances or special or off flavors. Does finish pretty clean. This one can be passed off on entry level beer persons and girlfriends."
"I'm pretty impressed with Boulevard Pale Ale. Though nothing remarkable, it's a solid, hop-forward APA that tastes good & is enjoyable despite the carbonation."
"Such a good mouthfeel coupled with a subtle but hoppy flavor make this the second of two Missouri brewed APAs that I really dig."
"D - this pale ale surprised me. The malts shined and the hops were very noticeable. Very solid beer. Too bad I have passed up on this so many times before. Better than average pale ale."
"This beer is a hazy amber orange color. There is about 1/2 inch of head which recedes to a thin film; little to no lacing. There is little in the nose, although I do smell a bit of floral hoppiness. Pretty unremarkable. The taste is a bit better than the nose, but really only average. Not a ton of hop bite, but there is some fruity and floral tastes which are nice. I'm really enjoying the mouthfeel of this one. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation."
"D- A very ""blah"" pale ale. Would probably please those with more sensitive palates, like me, who likes to eat plain crackers."
"Drinkability: I've really been digging on all of Boulevards' beers and this one is no exception. Good style and good company. Another winner."
"D: Although it wouldn't my first choice for an APA, this beer is very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but a bit strong and heavy, even by the standards of an ale. I would enjoy this with a sandwich at lunch or a light dinner."
"An average pale ale. Flavors are not blended perfectly. Nonetheless, still a decent brew and hard to pass up on a summer day."
"Drinkabiility: Easy to drink but it's really just a standard APA and it's too light on flavor and body. I bumped the score up slightly because it is pretty refreshing if drank quickly."
"This is one of America's oldest existing pale ales; it is over twenty years old at this point. Yet, like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Boulevard's offering in the style remains as tasty as ever. Sure, it is like an introduction to hops. But I know a good many beer drinkers that were served well by this being their introduction. Myself included. This is the beer that started my love for craft beer. It is still good."
"Not a bad pale by any stretch of the imagination, but it is not one of my favorites, either. Very balanced, which can be good or bad depending on your viewpoint. Readily available in chains that don't have many craft offerings, so I end up having it quite a bit."
"D: Decent at best and really just not that exciting. Oddly this one is both malt forward without being overly malty. There is just not that much there and what is there isn't impressive."
"A clear amber colored beer with a thick 1"" head that fades to a fine small layer that lasts for a while. Fruity citrus hops rise pleasantly from the glass. Tastes of a bitter citrus start that ends cleanly with some caramel hops. Great tasting pale ale. Light bodied with a crisp finish. Good carbonation and great drinkability."
"D: This would be a great beer to sit around and put down 5 to 6. The alcohol content isn't off the chart and it is extremely easy to drink."
"Easy to drink pale with a refreshing quality. Not a bad one to try."
"RJT"
"D: Decent hops for a pale ale. Flavorful, but not overwhelming. Perfect for when one won't quite do the trick. Will definitely try again."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. Flavor is nice and overall experience is pretty refreshing. This could make one seriously sessionable beer."
"D-Yum. This is a nice beer to enjoy while doing something like cooking. It's able to splash my palate with some fun flavors intermitently, while not being so intense or deep as to require my entire attention. From what I've seen, only available in the Boulevard mixed 12-packs in the Twin Cities area."
"D: Very drinkable pale ale. Easily split a six-pack with a friend, or have one to yourself if you feel the urge."
"Beer is a nice amber color with a full head. Aroma is malty with a hint of caramel. The taste is a balance of sweetness and bitterness. It finishes with a nice body which goes down smooth & easy. This is a great beer for relaxing or for some session drinking"
"Overall- Hop presence is a little faint but good juicy malt makes this tasty."
"D: Smooth and easy drinking pale ale here. Would like a few more hops but could easily drink this one again."
"A deep amber color is poured into the glass, with a light beige colored head forming on top. The head is about a quarter inch thick that dissolves away gradually. A grassy fragrance hits the nose at first that is followed by light citrus scent. It finishes with bread fragrance and followed by a touch of cracked grain. The taste comes forward with the malt, bringing bread and biscuit flavors that seemingly dominate each taste. The hops do make a feint appearance at the backend, with grass and citrus flavors. The texture starts a bit watery then grows to become more medium bodied. It then starts to fade to as reaches the back of the palate. The growing carbonation crashes on the back of the palate like a wave. This is an easy to drink ale, if I were drinking a mild ale. This says pale ale. Though it has a strong color and look, with a descent aroma, but the taste is lackluster and the feel is below average, makes this beer a little disappointing."
"D - Easy drinking. ABV is very mild. Not filling. Flavors aren't overwhelming. A decent session beer."
"pour an apricot color with a good i finger head and good lacing..i smell pine and citrus i smell malts hops a hint of grass and some biscuit smells..the taste is good it is thinner then the smell but has the same qualities mentioned b4,,the mouth feel is light/medium but it is a pale and not an ipa although it looks like one..pretty solid pale ale that easy to drink and < 5% abv..recommended"
"Fuller bodied than expected with a crisp and dry earthy hop presence up front that lingers throughout into a sweet dry finish. Very hop forward for a pale ale with a nice malt bcbone providing some nice balance. Hints of light golden fruit, mostly apple, as well as some biscuit, grass and straw. Pretty complex and very quaffable. I would love to drink more of this in the warmer months. Another solid offering from a very underrated brewery."
"+ it's still an easy drinking pale ale. something that doesn't wear on the palate and has a decent flavor. i would probably drink again, if offered, though i would double check for a Bully! or a Lunar Ale."
"Notes: I liked this beer, but the flavors are a little light and don't stick around long enough. That said, the flavors are good and tasty, I just want a little more."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is solid, but nothing to write home about. The hop bite is a perfect little slap on the tongue. There is something in the aroma that lowers the drinkability below your average pale ale."
"Drinkability is very good."
"D- A perfect session beer, nothing punching you in the face, just a good beer."
"Quite drinkable, as it should be. I like this beer though it is nothing special. The style leans toward the slightly boring but very drinkable. This one has good balance and enough clean hop flavor to be enjoyable."
"D: THis is the definition of a session beer-nothing to offend or excite; an easy drinking beer for most ocassions; not the best representation of the style but not the worst"
"D: A real solid beer for a few seasons. Easy to drink and has a nice balanced taste that stays interesting."
"D: One of my favorite everyday beers. I could always have several of these. Not too sweet, not too bitter. The balance of this beer is ""spot on"" in my opinion. All around a great pale ale."
"D) An alright PA. Average but not a standout."
"Really a decent pale ale, but the hops just don't pop enough for my tastes, which I'm sure was the intention since this beer was the first one ever released by Boulevard. I can definitely appreciate it for the fact that it helped kick off a brewery that has really thrived and is now churning out the wonderful Smokestack Series."
"The mouthfeel is a bit light. I would prefer a little more body. This may not be the tastiest pale ale but it is a good one."
"Poured bottle in pint glass: weak caramel and earthy aroma; hazy amber color; minimal off-white head with some lacing; nice hoppy flavor with medium bitterness and slightly dry abrupt finish, sticky texture with light to medium body, soft carbonation, great drinkability, well balanced, but not very complex if that is what you look for."
"D: An above average pale ale. It's about what I expected from Boulevard, whose main beers I wish had a little more refinement and a little more balance."
"A: A finger width thickness of creamy head, the color is a medium and slightly hazy gold, touches of spotty lacing along the edge of the glass - 4.25, S: The nose packs a solid punch of grain, a bit doughy and with some mild sweetness that reminds me of banana and citrus - 3.50, T: Quite dry and with a medium hop bite, some biscuit flavors along with a hint of caramel, a pretty average APA - 3.00, M: 3.00, D: Very drinkable beer, not much in terms of gusto or anything that makes this stand out from the masses but I still enjoyed it - 3.50"
"An extremely light colored beer. Decent head, decent taste. The smell is very light but a nice fresh hop scent. Very mellow. The taste is unusually smooth and overall very good. Nothing amazing here, but definitely makes me want to try more from this brewery. It's just a great smooth fresh flavor and fairly drinkable. I could imagine diving into a lot of these on a warm summer day. Aftertaste is somewhat non-existent but not bad either."
"the finish is that of a good balanced beer but a bit on the sweet side for my liking with this style, a trusty old friend but nothing for a special occasion."
"I love it!"
"Good body to the beer, nice bite with a slick oily feel. Aftertaste lingered for a good amount of time. Low ABV make it sessionable and good flavor make this a good solid beer."
"D - good, could have a couple."
"Drinkability- Good."
"Overall, a pretty good pale ale. It's a bit mild in the hops for me."
"D - Refreshing but not that flavorful."
"D - Oh, considering the ABV and the over easy drinking, heck ya."
"If you like your pale ales to be loaded with hops, you might take a pass on this ale. If you enjoy well balanced ales that are not too complex, this one is well worth a try. I liked it."
"Overall: Although I feel this beer could use a bit more work with the malt, overall I did enjoy this beer. The hop profile was unique."
"12oz bottle, BBD of 10/24/09. Pours clear amber-gold with a nice white head that doesn't die very quickly. Good lacing. Nice aroma of floral, citric hops and malt. Tastes equally pleasant, with nice aromatic hop character, pale (and a hint of caramel) malts. Interesting, slightly bubbelgum-like notes thanks to the yeast. Citric and fruity. Very well-rounded. Light-medium body. A nicely balanced, flavorful pale ale that you could drink all day long."
"Super easy to drink notwithstanding the basically mediocre components. Won't go out of my way to get this one again but the brew is not disappointing, it is what it is."
"- A decent pale, but the flavors don't do it for me.. bit to bright and zesty... not enough hop."
"Another very sessionable beer from Boulevard's standard line up. I could switch back and forth from their wheat and this guy all day long. (I'm a much bigger fan of their dry stout and porter though)"
"Insanely drinkable for style...for me, anyway. Some may be disappointed with the lack of punch, but I find the balance to be wonderful...and the creamy mouthfeel with the creaminess on the finish are great touches."
"Overall pretty disappointed with this beer."
"D - Good medium bodied beer and lower in alcohol content. Feels a little on the heavy side for a pale ale, which limits drinkability, but not much. I could see myself having a few of these in a session and being quite happy."
"D- An easy drinking Pale Ale, not as much bite as most I drink but good. Nothing to complain about with it."
"A fairly light beer, maybe more medium bodied. Low ABV and lots of flavor. All in all a pretty decent representation of the style, crisp and refreshing, well balanced."
"Overall this is nothing to write home about but it remains a solid APA. Worth a shot."
"Low ABV, plenty of flavor, what else could you ask for?"
"Poured this into a pint glass pours a nice copper color with foamy head that leaves a bit of lace. Smell is of slight citrus with more of a wheat type of smell. Taste is heavy carbonation with a faint hop bitterness, citrus, bubblegum, orange peel. Overall this is a nice session beer and goes down smooth."
"D: This beer is pretty drinkable thanks to the low ABV. For me; however, the flavor could use more depth and complexity. As it stands, this is a nice session brew for times when the beer isn't the center of activity."
"Nice start for anyone trying to get into hops. It's not overpowering in any way, and quite well done. A little mild for the style maybe, but extremely approachable."
"Poured with an off-white head and almost no lace. Looks and tastes force carbonated. I'm prejudiced against the beer as the hops give the beer a grapefruit character that I don't like. Do pick up some malt in there and that helps. Proly not bad if you like the grapefruit thing."
"12oz bottle, I think I paid $8 for the sixer. Interesting that this is bottle conditioned as well as made with whole hop cones juts like another certain pale ale. Color was golden, clear, good head. The smell was well, nondescript to say the least. The taste was very balanced between malts and hops and not what I would call hoppy at all. It was however amazingly easy to drink. I could see myself purchasing this with some regularity if only it were cheaper than SNPA."
"D- It's an easy beer to throw down with its mellowness. Since the hops are fairly weak, it doesn't mess with the palate. This is a reliable, sessionable brew that is widely available in Missouri."
"EDIT- I may have caught a bad or old keg. On tap at Boulevard outpost at KC airport, the taste is quite a bit brighter, with far more noticeable malty sweetness, and a bit more hop presence. Review reflects the latter, and better, experience."
"Mouthfeel is firm. Easily drinkable. Flavor profile is a tad sour and yeasty at the onset, but gives way to a mellow sweetness that I really like. Nice malt presence sneaks in, with just a hint of hoppy bitterness. Well done. Recommend."
"Drinkability? Very good. It's easy drinking and tasty."
"Eh, this beer is average. I'm glad I only bought one."
"Overall I really wasn't too impressed with this beer. I'm sure that I'm spoiled with easy access to Alpha King and Founders Harvest Ale, but if this is what the other APAs taste like I will gladly stick by those."
"Mouthfeel is fine for the style. It has medium body and the carbonation is reasonable. Drinkability is good but I wouldn't want to drink more than a couple. It just doesn't have enough character or complexity to keep me interested."
"D: Very nice session APA; mild and balanced."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color. One inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops up front with a slight secondary sweet malt aroma. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops up front, slight earth malt, slight fruit (lemon), and overall a little watery overall."
"Overall: A big thanks go out to Vancer for hooking me up with this beer. It was good. Nothing I would go out of my way to have again, but worth having this time."
"Pours a very clear, very light amber colired body, with a huge cremy white head, lastingish. Nutty malty aroma, wheaty/grainy smell. Dry aroma, weakish. Dry malty nutty taste. Grainy dry taste. Carbonated. Somewhat tasty session-like."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little dry in the end, which in this case is a bad thing. I'm glad I didn't have to buy a sixer."
"Nose is clean, with a moderate dose of piney hops taking center stage. Flavors of earthy, piney hops, with some sweet malt coming through in the aftertaste. The hops are certainly the centerpiece, but this is pretty well balanced. Light-to-medium bodied, leaning toward light. A good amount of tongue-scrubbing carbonation. Clean and easy to drink."
"M/D - Nice carbonation and very enjoyable. This is one I could enjoy day after day"
"This poured a hazey straw amber color from the bottle into a tall glass. The head was a modest bit of white with similar lacing. The aroma was very subtle, wheat and a little hint of citrus hops. Very well carbonated but generally a very ""green", acidic flavor and thin bodied. Although there is a sense of bitterness, it doesn't taste like hops and just doesn't get 'er done for me. It's drinkable to a degree but I don't think the palate would ever be thrilled enough for much of a session. Not particularly tastey or impressive. It was refreshing though!"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my new and improved Boulevard Smokestack chalice (really the thing reminds me of a sacramental chalice, but I digress). The beer pours the color of peach jolly ranchers with a mediocre, off white head that recedes it to a flat film in the center of the glass. The aroma is pretty hoppy for a major brand, craft APA. There is definitely a good amount of citrus going on. There is also a good amount of malty sweetness lingering in the background of the aroma. The flavor follows suit with the hops really showcasing the flavor. Mostly orange with just a bit of lemon and a good malt kick to the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good bit of soft carbonation. This is definitely one of my go to beers while I'm out on the town in KC. Almost every bar has it on tap, which makes it a God sent when at a BMC joint."
"Poured from 12 oz into pint glass. Pours a hazy golden color with two fingers of fluffy white head. Gobs of retention stick to the side of the glass. Very piney smell. Taste is very smooth and balanced. The biscuitlike malts shine through first but give way to pine and light citrus hops. Medium bodied mouthfeel that lightly coats the tongue. Drinkability is very high as it's ABV is low and it's not super filling."
"Overall, this is a very easy to drink beer. It is a staple from Boulevard and could easily be a session beer. I will be drinking more of this."
"> Can't wait to try this one when summer comes back around."
"Pours to a light golden-orange with thin off white head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves okay lacing. Nose is mild and of apples and citrus fruit, with a fairly bland mouthfeel. Taste is more of the hoppy fruit, with just a slight hint of skunk. Finish is short-lived, but pleasant. Not a bad beer."
"As far as drinkability goes, this is a top notch introductory Pale Ale, IMO, nothing to brash or to off-puttish about it, it's just a solid beer that you can drink quite a bit of and not feel like you have been overwhelmed."
"Since I've tried all 6 in succession now, I would strongly encourage people who haven't tried any of Boulevard's offerings to get the Sampler Pack. It certainly doesn't disappoint and gives you 6 very different but very good beers. At a decent price, I consider this a steal."
"Overall a drinkable, but uninspiring APA. A little to thin and light for my taste. However, this could be a decent session brew as the mild profile makes it very easy drink."
"mouth is crisp and clean, highly carbonated and drinks easy esspecially on a very hot day. I could session the hell out of this beer. Overall, just middle of the road, a very ""safe"" representation."
"Out of their variety pack. Poured a clear orange with a thick head and lacing. The aroma and flavor pale compared to modern pale ale standards. This is more on par with a slightly stronger English pale ale, for the more subtle hops and malt balance. There's some pleasant citrus grapefruit in the aftertaste, but nothing big and sharp, just a dull, somewhat spicy bitterness. A decent session beer and starter pale ale I suppose. Certainly not bad."
"Taste is more satisfying to the hophead in me than would usually be expected in an American Pale Ale from a local brewery. Of course it isn't very complex but hey, its just a pale ale. I am starting to really like Boulevard as far as local stuff goes. I would choose this if I couldn't get a Sierra Nevada."
"D - This really isn't a bad beer its just that the hop profile in it just doesn't do it for me"
"Another good beer by Boulevard. Kind of standard for the style, though if this was all that was around I would be very happy."
"This beer pours a light golden hue. Head was a bit thin, wispy and disappears VERY quickly. Wispy lacing was left on the side of the glass. This beer has a strong hoppy character both in the scent and the taste with slight malt background. The one thing I noticed when I first took a drink of this beer is the strong crisp taste one can notice when first drink it. There is not much of an aftertaste at ALL. It's lighter body, but strong presence. This is an outstanding pale ale, and great for a session."
"Drinkability: A nice beer without complexity. Needs a bit more hop and malt flavors to make it more interesting"
"I did not like this beer at all. The best aspect was the appearance and the beer did not live up to this at all."
"Thanks to mugglesandhops on this one."
"Very easy drinking pale, but not interesting enough to warrant trying again."
"goes down easy. a decent beer. im glad to have tried it but i dont think i will be visiting this one again any time soon."
"orange golden color 1 finger head faded very fast, no lacing. smells floral some citrus but not much, taste of citrus, mouthfeel is thin from start to finish. very easy to drink I will drink this again. Not a very powerful pale ale though"
"Pours a mostly clear golden color with a thin off white head that sticks around a little bit. Smells of crisp citrus hops and some caramel malt. Tastes like it smells, hops up front malt in the middle, and a lingering caramel in the finish. Medium body, crisp carbonation. Great little session brew, wish I could get this locally."
"D - Great beer. Not too sweet and not too hoppy. Well balanced."
"D- Cheap, sessionable, not super hoppy nor to malty. All of these make this quite a drinkable beer."
"I think this beer has a pretty good balance but definitely was more hoppy than I remembered. I would describe it as pretty hoppy with a just a little maltiness poking through. I like the hoppiness but the beer is a little plain. Still its a good everyday type beer."
"Not bad in the least, but a true lawnmower beer."
"Drinkability is good and enjoyable Pale Ale nice on a hot day goes down easy, tastes good."
"Even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Good session beer, but would like more complexity."
"D - Better than some but not really excited to try it again."
"Boulevard Pale Ale is an American Pale Ale and it ranks as a very good example of its style. It isn't overly assertive and makes for a good session beer, as well as a good beer option for those who like hops, but only in moderation. It offers qualities that make it a good choice for seasoned veterans of this style as well as newbies who do not appreciate the big hop flavor of many of the more assertive pale ales on the market"
"It was a bright spot to find this beer in a grocery store in rural East Tennessee. Although I gladly threw down a few pints of these, doesn't mean that I'm going to replace Sierra Nevada's pale ale on top of that pedistal. The beer begins promising enough- a medium copper hue with golden highlights, lively carbonation, well-headed with good retention. A mild haze persists, I'm thinking from a dry-hop character. Aromas of citrus, pine, lemon grass, and fruity esters dominate the glass while giving mild maltiness to the nose. Flavors of hops shift the balance away from the yeast, fruit, and malt character and into the oranges, grapefruit, pine, and grassy notes. Malts are well-attenuated, perhaps to grainy, cracker-like levels. Moderate fruity esters give a light hint of prunes, appricots, apples, and pears. The well-attenuated character gives the beer a crisp, sharp, dry texture- combined with a grassy, dry, sharp, bite from the hops give the beer a lot of crispness and refreshment, even if a bit harsh on the hop front. A beer certainly worth trying."
"Golden pale ale with a slight haze...maybe from temperature. 1"" off-white head falls to 1/4"" and retains there for a while. Good lace. Sugary caramel aroma with subtle floral hops mixed in. Taste follws closely along with the aroma -- caramel, toffee malt and a floral, herbal bitterness. Light bodied, medium carbonation with a somewhat thin mouthfeel. Very mild but drinkable and enjoyable."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Nice flavors and low alcohol make for good sessioning."
"T/M- Almost nothing. Very, very subdued cascade (I think) hops and little malty presence at all. No carbonation whatsoever. Like drinking a can of pop that was opened and left in the fridge for a month. I'm guessing that this was a very, very old keg because it just did not seem fresh. I will have to try it again sometime in a bottle that I'm sure is fresh."
"D: My first review of a Boulevard brew. Seems like a decent APA in flavor and aroma, but nothing memorable or exciting here. I may be spoiled by big, bold examples of the style - ones this doesn't compare favorably to. Session-ably light but disappointing in its simplicity. Good to try, but a beer I'd pass on for many others of the style."
"Drinkability: Endlessly drinkable. This is a great pale ale, and one of my new favorites. I could drink these all night and never tire of them. This would be a perfect session beer."
"D: A decent session beer. Not the best pale ale, due to the minimal hop character."
"Drinkability: very light tasting ale, refreshing, not a bad beer, not a great beer, I enjoyed it. A nice summer beer."
"D - Nice session brew and so far the best of the sampler pack."
"Fresh bottle brought to Cole's by the brewery, on their way to Cooperstown. Cascade and Simcoe, very good bitterness. Yellow with a bit of white head.High carbonation. Still, quite drinkable. Solid, though not the pale I would seek out again. Warmup for the extreme series."
"pours a gold bar lying in the egypt sand golden colour .... has a muted honey and slight hop aroma ... a decent brew, very people friendly ... abit thin but generally refreshing ... this beer needs more (hops mostly) to be called a good beer , it just seems to fade in the end.."
"A solid offering from Boulevard..."
"The bottle has yeast added for a ""second fermentation"" that the brewer calls bottle conditioning. Cloudy amber color with too small head. The head is about 4 cm when poured down the center with large bubbles that quickly disintegrates into just a ring around the glass. The nose is hoppy but somewhat bland hoppy, not as complete or deep as some of my favorites. Very good flavor and mouthfeel which was a surprise compared to how it pours and smells. Mild in both malt and hop but very balanced and drinkable. I don't like an APA that overwhelms you with hop and this one strikes the right balance. I'd say its an above average pale ale with better hop flavor than say Bass and some other more popular ales. only slight lacing follows this beer down the glass. The drink is much much better than appearance. I'm happy I picked this one up."
"Not my favorite Boulevard offering, but a slightly above average APA. Drinkability is pretty high, very sessionable. Will most likely stick to one or two sixers of this each year."
"D: Definitely above average. Tasty and refreshing. A good ballpark or picnic beer...one you can drink all day without getting too bored or too drunk (4.9% ABV)."
"All and all, I would probably pick a few 6'ers of this up every year if I had it available... Thanks Tim."
"A touch watery although it's certainly crisp on the finish. I could see having a few of these."
"I am looking forward to 4 more to finish off my sixer. Very light and can down these with ease and I find most beers I prefer to be way more filling b/c I like the stouts and porters but enjoy a lighter beer occassionally. This is a beer you will terminate and you will be bock for more!"
"Subtle nose but with the sytle in mind very good does not have that in your face scent of an IPA but notes of hops,malt and a certian degree sweetness, the taste is nearly perfect for a session APA the hops alcohol and malt combine to make a very easy to drink crisp beer, light body with an outstanding carbonation level, very drinkable for those long hot summer evenning this is one of my staple and will remain that way awsome brew"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured a medium gold, forming a 1 inch off-white head, with light lacing. The aroma consisted of equal amounts of malt and hops. A very balanced aroma, with neither dominating but still very pronounced. The taste again is a very balanced combination of the malt and hops. Good hop flavor, but with enough malts to smooth out any harsh finish. Medium body and mouthfeel. Very smooth finish. Overall, I really enjoyed this pale ale. Full flavor and great balance along with a low enough alcohol level to make this an excellent session ale. Recommended!!"
"Overall, a solid offering from Boulevard. I'm glad that I was able to get it on tap here in central IL. Should be a staple in bars. Not the best Pale Ale I've had, but a solid offering and definitely worth trying if you can get it."
"Easy to drink, not the best APA, but about the best the bar had to offer."
"This beer has been my mainstay for a while. It was the first beer that got me into trying more than your buds, coors, and Millers. Now I can't even drink the mega brewed beer. At first I didn't like this beer but it has grown on me. It is a great beer. Wish it had a bit more of a hoppy flavor but it is very good. The beer has a bit of bite but turns into a very smooth gulp."
"Tasted on 4/4/08 as part of a sampler pack."
"Pours a light amber with a thin but creamy head which quickly dissipates. Light aroma of malt and hops with a hint of cardboard (oxidation alert). Tastes fairly generic to me--caramel malt with a light hops finish. Decent balance but not particularly complex, and somewhat thin bodied for the style. Not a bad brew, but nothing to write home about."
"Pours an orangeish-red with almost no head. Smells is mostly orange peel. Taste is relatively hoppy with some fruit. A decent taste but nothing special. The beer is very drinkable though since it's relatively low in alcohol. Overall, it's not a bad beer, but I don't know if I would pick this up on a regular basis."
"appearance is copper and it has a fairly white head. smell is citrus and very hoppy. taste is very hoppy with some notes of grapefruit. mouthfeel is good and it is a nice drinkable beer. very good pale ale. they are also selling alot more beer down here in texas, so it is always available."
"A good, solid representative APA, better than many, but not truly exceptional. Develops a moderately thick head that subsides quickly but does not fade completely. Definately a hoppy note to both the taste and the scent. Citrus, yes, but not as pronounced as some. Mouthfeel and taste are what you would expect from an APA, no surprises. Still, a very good ale. I'd rate it a bit behind Sierra Nevada, Red Seal, Hazed & Infused and some others."
"My favorite of the Pale Ales."
"Orange, gold pour with short lived head. Smell at first was pretty nice, and hoppy, but after a minute it turned to a very astringent smelling hops and honey like malt. Very carbonated, I thought, and hops are quite present all throughout the tasting of it. Finishes with a touch of sweetness, but the alcohol like chemical presence is a little offputing and keep this from being an above average pale in my opinion."
"It has a sweet malt taste with a nice hop taste in the finish. A near perfect taste for an APA. It is light bodied with good carbonation. Leaves a bit of a cloying feeling in the mouth though or else mouthfeel and drinkability would be perfect."
"Not an extreme beer, but terrific when you just want a good beer, full bodied and flavorful, just not kick you in the ass strong."
"Orange, amber in color with white head. Smell is lush,surpisingly malty with orange accents. It's also quite full-bodied, with more malt than the Sierra Nevada and a nice hop balance. Finish is very dry, making the beer utterly drinkable. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I think it is now my go-to Pale Ale."
"D: A great session APA as everything is even and inobtrusive, but I wish there was a little more distinctiveness."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. It poured a hazy orangeish color. The smell is hoppy with some citrus scents. The overall taste was similar with a citrus aftertaste. Not an overal distinguishing beer, it is still good enough to keep a few around for a pinch."
"Hazy orange, accented by a halo of webby lacing. Mild cereal grain and citrus in the nose. Mild hops detected in the flavor, very light pale malt and citrus in the middle. A thin mouthfeel, good enough to session, but ultimately, not possessing any distinguishing characteristics. Wish I had a handful of Amarillo to dump in the glass."
"Drinks easy, but not very interesting as APAs or even EPAs go, just a little more hops might've held my interest enough to session on. Run of the mill"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date into a pint glass. It was a rich gold color. It had a decent off white head that settled into a collar with broken film. Slight carb and slight lacing. The aroma was light hops - floral and citrus blend. After drinking a ton of double IPA's this year, this one pales in comparison for hop aroma but I really liked it. After a bunch of uber hopped beers it was enjoyable to have one that was moderate. The taste matched the aroma. Was nice and solid with a good hop bite that didn't shred your tongue. Most 2IPA's I can only drink one per session since so intense. But this one could be a great session beer. Overall, this is a really good beer. By far the best I've had from Boulevard yet. It won't get the press of the bigger breweries or the 2IPA's but it definitely worth trying. Strong recommendation. (Regular to heavy rotation)"
"Very average beer in my opinion. Looks ok, cloudy copper color with a nice head and average lacing. Slight malt aroma and a good hop smell meet the nose. Taste is thin. I think it is too light flavored for my taste. The hops save it though make it worth another try. Maybe it is my afinity for AIPA's but I find this offering to be a little weak. I'll have to try Boulevards IPA."
"Not the best pale ale I've had, but not bad, either. Worth a shot."
"Boulevard Pale Ale pours almost a perfect even, orange/yellow. It has a rather pleasantly mixed smell of yeast and hops. These come together real nice to make for a mild tasting, well balanced, smooth brew. If your looking for a good ale, this drinks mighty fine."
"A good session beer. Not too complex, but tasty."
"Worked well with the sandwich and I would definitely revisit this beer in the future. Too bad this was my second beer and I had to leave."
"d: Disclaimer: this was my first apa when I started getting into beer and its made by Boulevard, my hometown brewery, so I suppose I probably have some bias. That being said, the drinkabilty is good, this beer does a great job of showcasing its hops yet not overwelming the drinker with bitterness. The stangth of this beer is its balance, nothing really stands out, its just a well rounded, easy drinking pale ale."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer at a reasonable price."
"Smells of grapefruit and hops. Orange and grapefruit come through in the taste, which gradually fades to a hop bitterness with hints of bread. Bitterness is not as pronounced as in some APAs, but balances well. Perhaps lacking a bit of complexity, but very well balanced and drinkable. I've yet to try anything bad from Boulevard."
"The beer is a slightly hazy, golden color with orange hues and a thin white head. The aroma has faint spicy, citrus character, moderate sweetness, and low maltiness. The flavor is moderately sweet, slightly oxidized, giving a slight sherry-like flavor. The hop bitterness is moderate. The carbonation is medium-high, body thin, and not the smoothest swallow. Overall I think freshness doomed this sample (best buy date 3/19/2007, which I didnt see when buying out of town) from being very good. I would try it again if it was fresh and update this review."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass forming an off white 1 finger head that stayed for a while, hazy light amber color. The smell is kind of sweet citrus, metallic, piney. The taste is smooth with lots of carbonation not very hoppy at all. Medium mouthfeel with decent drinkability."
"Not a bad pale ale, pretty well balanced, just not too memorable for me."
"Pale malt, slightly sweet but no tannins. Good balance, nice hopping that's not too aggressive but still offers good depth of flavor. Enjoyable if somewhat ersatz APA."
"Decent but ultimately standard-issue stuff. There are a million out there like this, and a million more which are better."
"Pours a light copper, with a big white head. Smells of citrus hops. Also citrus tasting, with a good malt backbone to match. Bitterness is not very high, but still well rounded. Carbonation levels are good. A very tasty sessionable APA, a balanced beer overall, that's bottle conditioned, which is a plus in my book."
"A solid brew. Good for summer and fall. I don't get this in Colorado, and while I won't trade for it I always look for it when visiting Kansas."
"Had this on tap at a local joint last night. Nice copper body, medium white head, that left pretty quick. Nice lacing. Smell of a hint of hops, and fruit. Taste of citrus, decent hops. Finishes nicely. Very easy to drink, really decent craft beer. I bought one for a frien who isn't a BA at all, and he enjoyed it."
"overall, i really enjoyed this beer, it was refreshing with a nice amount of bitterness, very refreshing, complimented bbq very well"
"Typical hoppy IPA smell, but it's not a great IPA. Not terrible, not too sharp, but somehow bitter without purpose or flavor. It has a decent mouthfeel: carbonation, not too watery, decent feel. There is too much acidity in the aftertaste. And since it's not that enjoyable to drink, it's not that drinkable."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy orange-golden color with a thin, bubbly head. The smell is enjoyable, primarily of piney and citrusy hops but there is also a light sweet maltyness about it. Initially on the taste there is a slight maltyness and hint of yeast which is quickly covered by a pretty bitter finish. The mouthfeel is a heavy medium bodied beer with a light amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer and an enjoyable one. At 4.9% this could easily be a sessionable one."
"this was the ubiquitous local beer on my recent trip to kc, and it was everywhere i went, which was a good thing as my only other choices would have been macro. had to pretty much drink this all weekend. by the time i got back home i was dying for an alpha king...now there's a fucking pale ale. this is a clear straw in color with a tinge of orange. head was not impressive. very subtle nose, got a bit of biscuity malt. very light sweetness and not much in the way of hop bitterness...at least the balance is on. light, spritzy mouthfeel. a mediocre offering for a craft brewery...the beer scene in this cow town just ain't that great."
"D: It disappeared dangerously quickly. If not for the long drive, I'd have put away several more."
"Very nice light highly carbonated prickly sensation-fied pale ale. Easily drinkable. Not very complex with moderate bitterness on the finish. Again very piney with some light stone fruit flavors and that same caramel with only the lightest amount of RS. Crisp clean and satisfying. Easily drinkable."
"D: Not the best Pale Ale I've ever had but I found it to be enjoyable."
"Overall impression: This one is mediocre at best. From the Boulevard offerings I have tried, I would say stick to the dark beers."
"Overall this is a good beer which is very drinkable, slightly intresting pale ale."
"Drinkability: Its exceedingly drinkable, I will say that about it, but that's about all there is to say about it."
"Thanks, Vancer, for the opportunity"
"Quoting a colleague in KC, I order this as my backup when I'm out for dinner in the area and I don't like the rest of the beer menu."
"Mouthfeel was medium to light in body with prickly carbonation. Underwhelming overall."
"D- This beer doesn't have much freshness to the malt flavors and the hops are very soft. I like pale ales that are more subtle in hop flavors but they have to have good flavors. Instead I found this beer just to bland."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark golden color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, not much lacing at all. The nose is mostly malty with some hops and caramel. The taste is also mostly malty with some hops and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, I thought for sure this would be a better brew, but I was mistaken."
"Opinion: This is an OK beer. There isn't a huge margin to set this beer apart from many others like it. It is rather mild flavored with a subtle balance, so it would be good for someone that doesn't really care for Pale Ales or for flavorful beers for that matter. I am not too fond of the hop schedule on this beer, but that is not a manufacturing flaw. I have drank this beer quite a bit, but this is because it is a little easier to find than many others when you get to the Missouri/Arkansas area. I am sure that I will be drinking this beer again, but if I had my choice of an APA, I would choose something else."
"Overall not a bad beer slight better than average, but not by much."
"Drinkability was decent. Without much flavor, it goes down easy. The lack of flavor was disappointing, although it had a nice base."
"D - Excellent. Very quaffable. I like it better in the bottle however."
"Very consistent with the Pale Ale style. Unfortuantely, I wont be able to purchase it again for a while."
"Poured into a shaker at the Boulevard Brewpub - KC Airport. The beer had a light tawny body, with a thin but persistent glass ring, but unfortunately had weak lacing. The nose was filled with nice earthy, citric, and pine hp notes, which, along with the sweetness, helped the beer to smell English. The taste was very malty, with the same hop profile as the nose. Simply had great balance and flavor. The mouth was thin, but appreciated, with light and smooth carbonation. An excellent pale ale."
"D: This is a very sessionable pale ale and I only wish I bought a sixer of these before leaving Missouri and coming back down to Texas. That said, I am glad I have Boulevard's other beers to sample in their gift pack, as this is a damn good brewery."
"A simple Pale Ale that I bought while in Nebraska for Thanksgiving. Nothing really jumped out of me though. Faint lemony flavors, some malt, strong hops. Very crisp and might be good on a hot day or with a big meal. Just not an interesting brew at all."
"D - All in all this is a simple, uncomplicated, but altogether refreshing beer."
"Lots of herbal hops in the first mouthful, nice bite, Then the hops dominate all the way to the finish. I'm not sure if the hops are so strong or the malt profile is that thin. Some fruity malt profile detectable but way back there. Hops linger in the aftertaste. All things considered, nice stuff. An uncomplicated but tasty pale ale."
"This was served with a light, off-white head that quickly dissipated, disappointingly. There was intense clarity and brightness in this deep gold colored beer. The nose had a light hoppiness with a pleasant, underlying sweetness. There was a good mix of hops and malt in the mouth with a refreshing, dry finish."
"Great brew that I can and do drink often. I feel this beer is very underated."
"Pours some redhead tones with some more bubbling than expected in the background and great lacing going up and down the glass. Penty of biscuits and resin flowers in the nose. A very distinct Polish rye bread malt with some more citrus zest mixed into the crust. Well matched hops and malt in the palate."
"Da good pale ale and easily a session choice (which is what I did). I didnt care for the perfume fragrance, but the taste is good"
"Overall, this is a decent example of the style. I think this is a really good session beer, especially for something found occasionally in establishments that don't stock hardly any craft beer. I would encourage the proprietors to continue to stock it for beer geeks like me while the other customers through down their American Light Lagers."
"Pours amber colored with white head. About an inch of head the dissipates quickly. Aroma is citrusy hops. Taste is hoppy with malts balancing it. It is pretty crisp, I don't notice any fruit like flavors. The mouthfeel on this is medium, with a good amount of carbonation. One thing I do like about this one is the lower alcohol content. Many APAs taste great, but they are often too strong. A good beer, I wish it was available in my area."
"Overall I liked this and will be happy to have more as a good summer beer."
"Pours a nice off-white/tan head which recedes after a minute or so, leaving a nice touch of lace around the glass. Nose is sweet and malty, with hops present as notes of juicy grapefruit. Color is light amber and a bit hazy - chill-haze with a touch of yeast? Sweet and tangy from the get go, but with a touch of astringent hop bite and toasted malt aromatics. Hops linger a little bit, but not enough to call this bitter. Some minty characteristic to the hop bitterness, which I really enjoy, this is no single-hop showcase, there's a lot of hop character in this. Finish is dry, but theres a nice biscuity malt characteristic which lingers along with the bitterness. Reminds me a *lot* of the way Summit Extra Pale used to taste back in the late eightees, and there aint nothing wrong with that!"
"D=Under 5 alcohol and lightness equals good drinkability"
"D - It is very drinkable. One of my favorite APA's around."
"Boulevard's Pale Ale is an attractive copper color with a head of average height. Aroma starts mildly sweet, then rolls to citrussy hop smells. Smell is enjoyable, but nothing special. Flavor is nicely balanced. Hop flavor is a combination of piney and citrussy, with more of a rounded flavor as opposed to a bitter sharp taste. A sweet, biscuity malt backs up the hops nicely. Drinkability is very good. Overall, a very solid APA, but nothing to write home about."
"I have tried Boulevard Pale Ale on tap and in the bottle. This is a good summer beer to drink while grilling in your yard. Has a minimal head, little lacing and indistinct aroma. You may notice a citrus finish. Less hop element than I like in a pale-ale. This is a much better beer than the common mass produced brews from industrial producers."
"Overall easy to put down, just isn't anything ground breaking, good nonetheless. Would make a good session pale."
"This beer pours a pale golden color with a small, fluffy white head. Almost no lacing. The aroma is nice... citrusy, earthy, slightly sweet and inviting. The flavor is subtle... not so much watered-down, but not terribly pronounced, either. Slight citrus from the hops, a bit of malt and a background that reminds me of clover honey. The mouthfeel is thin and light. Overall, fairly drinkable but not terribly exciting... reminds me more of a cream ale than a pale ale. I want more hops! Free the hops!"
"A pretty decent session beer and one of my favorite of Boulevard's offerings. I like this beer for days when I savor some hops but don't want my taste buds to be blown away by something more assertive like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"Pours a light, clear amber with a short head. Nose is quite muted, with fruit and hops straining to poke their heads out however unsucessfully. Flavors are light-bodied and thin, might be a session brew as it was not unpleasent, just not robust enough. It makes Pale make total sense. Thanks jhammerly for the bottle."
"12 oz bottle, poured into an Imperial Pint glass. Nice golden orange color. Good clarity. Sticky white head, two fingers thick. Receeds to a decent lace. Smell is a bit piney with stiff citrus notes. Strong hop flavor like grapefruit. Very refreshing. Mouthfeel is a bit on the watery side, but not too bad. Not a lot of carbonation on the tongue. This is a great go-to beer for gatherings when you don't want anyone drinking your expensive stuff."
"Overall an above average American Pale and as I said a great fallback when superior brews are not available."
"I feel like this is a type-cast American PA. It is a good overall beer, but doesn't really do anything to stand out. It has a nice orange/amber appearance with a decent head that leaves a ""sip record"" on a glass. The smell is quite floral, with a hint of citrus, just like the taste. The after-taste is what I appretiated most though. The malt and hops work together to leave a dry, fruity flavor. The mouthfeel is like any APA, a bit on the carbonated side. All in all a complete beer that I can drink a bunch of when I am not feeling experimental."
"Drink local."
"Thanks to GreatGallaspy for this bottle."
"Mouthfeel is a tad thin and stingy from the carbonation, but otherwise I would say this is a textbook pale."
"My first try from Boulevard Brewing and it's definitely a solid beer. It has plenty of head and a deep dark yellow hue. It smells spicy and zesty with an inviting yeast undertone. The taste follows up on that impression to deliver a quite a bit of flavor. Not heavy as schlafly's version and probably a little less true to the style, but still of good balance and complexity just the same. This is a fine beer. As it turns out upon further inspection of the bottle, that it was bottle conditioned and formed its carbonation while in the bottle. It gets extra points for that as it is more authentic and I like to think that it helps the flavor. It probably does."
"It always leaves a great aftersight, nice concentric circles, tastes good, and doesn't overwhelm me with hopps."
"Overall: I've really got to note that I had this recently on tap and found that presentation much better for the taste and mouthfeel especially. For an APA, certainly worth a try."
"Drinkability: High. This is a great example of a midwest pale ale with a wonderful complexity, yet light enough to keep puttin' 'em back. I wish Boulevard beers were available in Chicago, but every time I've tried them on past trips or at beer fests, they have been consistenly good beers and I feel priviledged to sample them every chance I get. Nothing too esoteric, just very well-made beers. The pale ale is certainly a good example of this."
"This brew pours a semi-clear pale orangish-red color with a huge fluffy white head. The aroma is quite faint. After a thorough inspection of the nose, I can detect some malt and citric hop aromas. The taste is as thin as the aroma is faint. Seriously, this beer has almost no flavor. There is a sort of bitter flavor in the aftertaste (if it can be called an aftertaste when their was no taste for it to come after). The mouthfeel is sickly thin and watery. Overall, this is a bad beer. Not bad because its character doesn't agree with me, but because it has no character."
"This golden pale ale starts pours with plenty of carbonation and a bright white head. I can't help but noitce the hoppy, floral aroma. This beer has a good malt saltine cracker-like malt flavor, a slight fruitiness (almost like Juicy Fruit gum) with some pleasant tasting hops. The finish is bitter, but not powerfully so, with just enough hops to let you know you're drinking an American Pale Ale. Perhaps a bit thin for the style, which I suppose makes it a good pale ale for summertime quaffing. I used to drink Boulevard beer a lot starting about 12 years ago when I as a college student in Western Illinois. This is a respectable pale ale and I wish the Illinois distribution reached the Chicago area. Although the aroma reminded me a bit of Berghoff Pale Ale (which is brewed in Wisconsin and distributed in the Chicago area), I think Boulevard's pale ale is a bit more refined than the Berghoff and closer in taste and body to SNPA. The packaging is pretty refined; as this six-pack comes boxed with some nice artwork. The beer is described as bottle-conditoned, and I like that, as bottle-conditioned ales tend to have a bit more complexity than highly filtered ones. Thanks go to fellow BA RedBaron for bringing this back from Oklahoma."
"Very drinkable, should work well with most food."
"12 oz bottle. Best Before 10/02/05. Yellow gold with continual CO2 rising woth a off white, longstanding head. Very thinck lacing. Some hazy. Grainy straw and horsey aromas. Very little hops aroma. Maybe some spice. Estery. Estersy come thru in the flavor also. Bready. Mild hop flavor. Med-full bodied and prickly carb. Flavor does not linger. BLVD Pale Ale used to be so much better before they started brewing for dollars."
"A decent beer. I wouldn't pass it up if offered."
"Like a traditional pale ale this beer has a strong hoppy character. It's like most pale ales I have consumed. The one thing I noticed when I first took a drink of this beer is the strong crisp taste one can notice when first drink it. There is not much of an aftertaste which is a good thing. Just a good exceptional pale ale."
"Sometimes memory plays tricks, but I remembered it being a little hoppier than it is now. Oh well."
"The head retention could be a bit better, but the delicately zesty mouthfeel from the very-fine-bubbled natural carbonation makes up for that. In the flavor, a lightly sweet and straightforward maltiness (a touch biscuity and lightly caramelish) is perfectly balanced by a firm bitterness, and woven with bright threads of floral and citrusy hops. It finishes dry and refreshing with its fruity hop flavors fading to more grassy hops that linger. Excellent drinkability!"
"Pours a rich amber hue with a full bottle conditioned headskie. Tastes like a pale ale, but not the supergreat apa I was hoping for. Alas. Still, a decent beer worth tasting if the oppertunity presents. Very very smooth and easy to drink."
"Calories: 145 per 12 ounces."
"Pours an amber color with a small head that falls slowly and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma has some fruits, but mostly US hops - pine, citrus, etc. The flavor has a caramel/toffee flavor underneath lots of hops of the same character as were in the nose. Pretty good pale ale here. Drinkability is good and the mouthfeel is moderate."
"A fine example of the style, but nothing to get excited about."
"Best by dating found on a 12 ounce bottle. sixer came in a sturdy cardboard box with brew and brewery info, so give 'em some packaging points. Pours light amber, somewhat cloudy. Yeasty, resiny hop nose. Medium malt center, so so hop finish. I would put this in the decent, but Middle of the road P.A. category. Decent balanced sessioner, but nothing overly exciting to my hop monster craving taste buds."
"Standard copper color, slightly hazy (it even says unfiltered on the neck label). Head pours out at about 3/4"" fades quickly, and leaves some stickiness. Slight hops present in the nose, kind of floral. Taste is underwhelming to say the least. Hops are very muted, with malt actually providing a lot of the sweetness and flavor of this beer. Mouthfeel is quite watery with low carbonation levels. OK drinkability, but there are tons of beter APA's out there. Thanks to babydoc for the sample."
"This beer pours a brilliant golden color with a light coat of head over top of the beer. The nose is filled with a nice spicey and sweet hop with a bit of caramel malt sweetness in the background. The flavor is not bad either. The hop is almost peppery. The sweetness from the malt is a little too light for me. The feel is also a bit thin. Overall, this is an okay beer. I'd like more body, but it works well for a session beer."
"The pour showed a great, hazy amber / gold beverage, 1 tan head, tart circus smell and taste  laced the glass the entire way down. Smooth and balanced frosty, a lite hoppy finish. Great beer from KC!"
"Maybe it was the day, the water, does drinking a beer get any better that this?"
"The mouthfeel is kind of light, but it is smooth on the palate. With such an excellent taste combined with an ABV under 5%, I could drink this all night, and I certainly have in the past, and will do so again in the future."
"Pours a nice light orange color and has a thick white head. It has a typical fruity/malty Pale Ale aroma... nothing special, but very inviting nonetheless. It has a very full body and the hop bite lasts long into the finish... grapefruit and citrus flavors abound. The Pale, Caramunich, and Caravienne malts balance with the superb choice of hops to make this beer something to enjoy. It is definitely going to be one of my favorite pale ales."
"Where's the hops? Maybe I'm missing something but this seems to have a weirdly cloying sweet taste with not a lot to back it. It looks fine, decent head and lacing and clear orangish-golden color, it isn't worth your time. Nearly as ubiqious as the wheat, but not as good. Not worth your time."
"A very well contructed APA, from Kansas City. I could session a few of these. Many thanks to babydoc for this nice midwest ale."
"This brew came from bditty187 I believe several months ago. I am sampling a chilled beer in a pint glass. The beer pours a bright gold and amber color with a soft creamy eggshell white head of about 1 cm. Aroma is present immediately with pine and sour grapefruity hops present. I also get faint whiffs of toffee. The body is a little thinner than I would like and carbonation is mild. The flavor allows light toffee and a sort of bready flavor to start off and recedes to citrusy hops and pine needles as well. The finish is slightly bitter and refreshing. Some orange flavors appear on the finish as well. A very easy to drink beer that I could drink several of in a sitting. Not sure if it would be my choice though. A decent enough beer just not outstanding."
"Very refreshing pale here. Not really what I'm looking for in a session pale, but this one goes down pretty easy (I can imagine it will go down easier during the warmer months)."
"On tap. Pours a clear, dark golden/amber color. Thin white foamy head. Very little head retention. Some good patches of lace on the glass. Slight grainy smell with a small amount of citrus, grapefruit. Light flavor from the malt, citrusy hops. Some bitterness, but still maybe not enough. Balanced, but could use more of each end, malt and hops. Light body, too much carbonation. I will say that this grew on me a little more as I drank it. Seemed to be an average pale."
"Starts out with light malt flavors. Faintly sweet biscuit with hints of fruit. Big, tart, citric, acidic hops pick up the back end and carry into the appetizing finish. Medium bodied, good carbonation. Refreshing, dry, not bad. A very hoppy pale ale, or maybe just malt-deficient. Could use a little more malt."
"Pours a straw colored liquid with a thin head which quickly fades to a sheen. Mild smell of sweet cream and caramel. Nice medium body. The taste is a mild sweet caramel flavor . Not a strong hop presence here. Definately an ""east coast"" pale ale. The barley dominates this brew. Pretty good."
"Boulevard Pale Ale is dark golden in color with a thick head that does not last. The aroma was light with citrus hops and some malt. The taste was citrus hops with a malt background and dry finish. The body is medium-light with plenty of carbonation. I my opinion this would make a good session beer."
"Come to think of it, this beer is a helluva lot like ol' Roger. It smells like grain and sweat, as I imagine he would. It's corny, too, not in a bad way per say, but sometimes that corn can stick out against the more serious, bold, and talented elements surrounding it (Entwistle), and it sometimes comes off a little clownish against the hoppy bitterness that it lives with (Townsend). Also, it's got a thin but satisfying body and it's pretty smooth, just like Roger."
"This is a good session beer, however, as the flavor and body lend themselves to mass drinking."
"I find this one to be a very good session beer. I am kind of ashamed that I ignored it for so long as I tried other brews. This has reestablished itself in my list of ""return to"" beers, that I come back to time and time again. Definitely worth a try!"
"Thanks to BDitty for the bottle!"
"Since I drink primarily for flavor, I doubt that I'll be buying any more Boulevard Pale Ale. Too bad the brewers couldn't have added a little of the magic that they put into each bottle of Bully! Porter."
"Color is dull copper and clear. Tight, off-white head died quickly and left little lacing. Nose is a mixture of citrus/floral, with an undercurrent of malty biscuit. Flavor is tasty, with a well-balanced blend of subtle hops and malt sweetness. Finishes on the dry side, with a distinct note of honey at the very end. Surprisingly smooth on the palate. This one screams session brew. Give me this on a hand pump and I'd be set for the night."
"I've drank this beer for years and have had many a session with it. The last few months I've had different and great beers, mostly bigger beers, but I always know I can come back to this one. And that's a good thing because this is often the best beer available on-tap in this town."
"I can see this as a nice every day kind of beer. A solid offering."
"Overall, another winner from Boulevard."
"One nice thing about living in the Kansas City area is that almost all restaurants serve this... so you rarely end up having to drink a crappy beer!"
"taste - sharp, short, clean, super citric hop burst that is less bitter and more apple/minty/piney sweet. very puckering. medium/light bodied- very dry. mindless drinking, but too puckering and dry to be enjoyable as a session beer for me."
"This beer can be enjoyed year round."
"You could slug these back without too much trouble, as long as you are thinking about something else."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is decent. It boasts of pale malts and a faint floral hop scent. It seems to come across slightly malty with a bit of carapils malts added for flavor and body. The taste is above average. It is full of pale malt flavor along with some hops as well. It doesn't seem to have good balance. The mouthfeel is fine. This is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average pale ale that's all. It's one and done for me."
"Overall: A very tasty Pale Ale from Boulevard. Cheers to the Huge for this one."
"Final Thoughts: IMO comparable to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (which is one of my favorites of the style). I usually pick this beer (while maybe not as good) because of the proximity from which it is brewed (in KC) but also because of its low price in this area."
"Served in a cold pint glass, after letting it sit to warm a bit, pale golden color, small white head that quickly disappears, light bready and grassy aromas, clean balanced malt hop flavor, watery and thin mouthfeel, really light, crisp clean finish, a decent english pale ale."
"Rich orange or amber-red when poured. A head of small white bubbles formed and, as I poured, a pleasant flowery hop flavor rose from the glass. A closer sniff was quite satisfying as some of the malt sweetness blended with the hops. Upon tasting, this medium-bodied beer was bitter, as a Pale should be, with citrus-y aromatic hop flavors (probably Cascades) on top of a gentle (hardly noticable) malt. A hint of honey (is honey an ingredient of this beer?) blended the bitter hop, but I was wanting of more sweet malt to bring a sense of completion. 'Empty' is the best way to describe the experience. The beer suds subsided (rather quickly) to a white ring of foam that clung to the sides of the glass and were eventually left behind at the bottom. The gentle flavors of this beer are easy on the tongue such that it does not demand attention from your taste buds. A great beer for a casual evening."
"Pours a hazy orange-amber color with a medium off-white head. Thin lacing. Aroma is lightly hopped and a little citrusy. Medium-bodied and crisp with a decent hops flavor through and through. Very little malt but it is there. The finish is crisp and rather hoppy. This beer really does nothing to offend, although it doesn't really take any chances either."
"Draught: This one pours a somewhat darker golden color. Definitely lighter than expected. There is some white head and a bit of lacing. The aroma is a bit on the lighter side also. Some grapefruit hops to the nose. The taste is some grapefruit hops also. A touch bitter, with a somethat lighter body. A decent pale ale. Like their wheat, a little lighter than your standard Pale Ale."
"Picked up a sixer while passing-thru Mo. on vacation. The six is sold in a nice sturdy top closing box. The beer poured a nice hazy copper/orange color with a nice, full fluff, vanilla head. Lace was short lived and in spots. The aroma is citrus or grapefruit. The taste and mouthfeel is crisp and clean hop. The hop is most over a well balance of malt, but not a bitter taste. Makes this a very drinkable beer. When im that way again, i'll be sure to pick up more. Meantime I ordered the Pale Ale mustard from thier web-site. Also good and the order was timely."
"This beer poured into the glass a yellow/gold color that was crystal clear and well carbonated. It produced a beige/off white colored head that was fairly thick and creamy, lasting somewhat but falling to a ring on the outside edges. No lace was present. The aromas were of sweet malts, pine hops, fruits (citrus lemon, grapefruit), some caramel and a hint of yeasty bread. The flavors were of sweet malts and fruits, citrus (grapefruit bite and lemon), hops, yeast and grains. It left a pine needle hop feel behind, on the tongue. Light bodied. Sweetness of fruits or malt seemed to dominate the pallet. Refreshing decent beer. Would have liked something more from it, seemed to be a little on the weaker side when matched up to others of its style."
"Smell is mildly subdued of lemon and grapefruit with a bit of dryish malts. Taste is a fast start of caramel sweet malts, kinda breadish that turns right into mild fruits of lemon and grapefruit, sort of a dulled juicyness. Quite easy with a smooth carbonation and fruity mild sweetness and a fabulous backing of toasty breadish malts. Medium body feel, a bit thin in places, but would suit for a good session beer as this stuff goes down easily."
"Bright amber with a fine head of close to 1/2 an inch and its nice and rocky. Like Bully! Porter, great retention. Respectable pale lacing. The smell is malty, emphasizing a fruity quality. Taste follows aroma, fine carbonation merges with pleasant fruit and a very faint cinnamon toast maltiness. Slight Cascade-like finish. Not as interesting as some, the finish is light comparatively. This is a sessioner for me, like Sierra Nevada Pale, its a little dusty and dry and there could be more going on."
"Aggressive this is not. In fact, it is rather forgettable. But for a brief moment in time, this is perfect in its simplicity and easy-going nature."
"Always good for a session and reasonably priced (at least in the Lawrence/Kansas City area)."
"Solid production piece by the KC local brew. Pale Ale is a big time seller for Boulevard and I recommend it for all true beer fans. Firm aftertaste provides big-time drinkability. While I am rating the bottle version, the keg product retains its flavor despite mass consumption. (i.e. Two day long keg party!) Overall, it's an economical micro that will be worth the taste."
"Mouthfeel was a bit weak...but the drinkability is high...not a favorite but not bad"
"Goes down beautifully, and I'd toss it back with regularity if I could. Sharper aspects of homulus lupus arrive late on the palate, and contribute to some variety in this brew. Finish is short but sweet. Quite enjoyable. Much thanks to bditty and marc for their trades!"
"hazy copper colour....thin foamy head....rings of lace. yummy grapefruit aromas of hops....nice caramel maltiness too in the nose. solid in it's subtleness....tastes very good....typical caramel malt base....balanced by some grapefruit and bits of piney hoppiness. medium bodied and very drinkable. solid session pale ale. could drink a lot of these. thanks again to my bro for bringing this up from missouri."
"Pours a reddish amber color with a foamy white head that sticks all over the glass as it dissipates into a nice amount of lace. Nose is dominated by floral and spicy hops with a bit of citrus. Medium in body and a bit spritzy in texture. Taste is fresh fruit and some sweet caramelized malts at first followed by notes of citrus and grapefruit rind bitterness. A quite enjoyable pale ale. Thanks to bditty187 for the sample!"
"A very typical Pale Ale. Copper/Amber in color. Medium lightly sweet malt body and fairly high in hops. This bottle-conditioned version offers no surprises and nothing exceptional, but it is a very nice, drinkable ale. Pleasant floral and light fruit aroma. Slightly yeasty and some citrus bite. Not much of a head. Mild and tasty!"
"This brew is a clear, dark golden color, small white head topping it off. Smell is mainly flowery hop scent, slight grain malt scent as well. The main taste is a combo of both of those, grainy malt up front, with a flowery hop backbone. overall a pretty tasty brew, different than some of the PAs that are around these days."
"Ahh, good memories makes any good brew taste great if you let them."
"This brew poured a honey-golden color with a small white head that dissapated quickly, it left little lacing as well. The smell was mostly hops with some citrus. The taste is mostly of hops up front with a sort of flowery taste. There has to be some malts somewhere because the beer is not too bitter, there is a pretty good balance between the two. I feel the taste is a little thin and bland as well.. The little taste that is there is hard to pick out. The amount of carbonation is good however giving this brew a good mouthfeel, and it is easy to drink. Overall I was a little disappointed with this brew. I think I was expecting more because I love their Bully Porter so much."
"I think this would be a wonderful everyday beer!"
"Tasting notes. A sampling in an 8 pack winter Boulevard sampler, this is a top notch pale ale. Drinkable on any occassion."
"Medium to big body, tastes dry/fruity, loaded w/lots of malt and hops. Crisp finish."
"Golden in hue with hints of bronze, slightly cloudy from the yeast I agitated and released into my glass. The head is eggshell white, it reached two fingers on a harder than typical pour. Very good retention and it laced rather well. The nose has good potency, mild citrus notes upfront with kisses of pine in the middle; the malt is noticeable at the back. The bouquet is not complex but it does speak its mind, youre invited, take a sip. So I do. The palate, for a Pale Ale, is on the simple side. However I find it very tasty. The citrusy-hops bitterness is found upfront with clean, ordinary maltiness in the middle; at the finish a hint of pine is detectable with a smidge of grapefruit. The malt is more prevalent than your typical APA yet Boulevards rendition is not English in nature. It is just a smaller than normal APA. It is what it is. This beer does suit me great; it is cheap, drinkable as hell, and easy to find. The body is medium; while it is not thin it does lack some pizzazz. The carbonation is modest, low, and natural. Which seems very appropriate for this beers flavor construction. Session beer material. Its not worth seeking out but dont avoid it either."
"Great with savory foods or by itself as an appetizer for other beers."
"This brew comes up with a golden reddish light color with good foamy retentive head exuding a biting spicy hop aroma.  The well-balanced flavor presents a bold spicy hop profile with a light malt balance and a clean finish.  Pretty good."
"Without question the best of the four beers I've tried from this brewery...The others were average...this is downright good....deep gold in color...cloudy....nice white lace.. very tantalizing hop aroma of grapefruit along with some floral tones...medium bodied...well balanced...Iwas surprised with the sweetness and maltiness that comes along with a pretty decent hop flavor..caramel base with a sweet grapefruit finish (like when you pour sugar on your grapefruit)..very drinkable...very solid..."
"This hazy copper brew throws out a small creamy off-white head that displays some nice retention.  Lacing is nice and shows a spiderweb-like quality.  The carbonation is evident in the CO2 bubbles surfacing at a nice clip.  Nice citrus and floral blend on the nose.  A bit of grassiness perceived also.  The citrus and pine characteristics stand out to me.  Also get some grapefruit rind subtleties.  Very nice.  However, this is all backed up quite nicely with firm malt backbone.  The  body is about medium.  This is a very drinkable very nice Pale Ale."

"Warning: upon ordering this beer at Outback Steakhouse, request that it be served in a room temperature mug. Save those for the Fosters and Bud customers. I know that is what was wrong with mine.  The condensation inside the chilled glass may account for the weak head and unusually sweet flavor I encountered. As the brew warmed in my mouth I could discern the craft-brewed complexity of this very drinkable, tasty ale. The Hop aroma is assertive. The caramel malts add sweetness and balance out the hops. It could have used more bitterness, but I think it was the low temperature of the beer that was masking the bitterness. Better yet ask then to warm up a glass for your beer."
"This was a nice treat in the hotel bar on a recent visit to Missouri, especially given the rather large A-B presence there! Golden copper color with a slight, white head. Floral hop aromas, with just a hint of grapefruit, balanced with a slight malty sweetness. Taste is dominated by floral hops, with a bit of citruis and malty sweetness. Medium carbonation level creates a smooth mouthfeel. Nice, dry, refreshing finish adds to its drinkibility."
"Light copper hue w/ good clarity.  The head falls fairly quickly, leaving a rim around the glass.  The crisp, floral and slightly citrusy hop nose seems to a Goldings / Cascade mix.  Just a slight hint of biscuit malt, but not much else there.  The fairly high carbonation results in a somewhat prickly mouthfeel.  Hop bitterness is mild, clean and crisp and sufficiently balances the generic caramel malt sweetness.  Mildly floral hop flavor.  Malt characters are minimal.  Finishes quite dry and refreshing.  An okay pale ale, but the overall cleanliness and above average hop profile makes this an excellent session brew.  It's much better on tap."
