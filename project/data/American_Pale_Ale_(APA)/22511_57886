4.43,-0.2,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On tap at the Worthy Burger. Despite living in neighboring NH, I've been waiting a long time for this. A cloudy pumpkin pour with a thick frothy head that died down quickly, but left excellent lacing throughout the glass. An almost smokey hoppiness on the nose. Big herbal fruity hop flavor; how did they pack all that in an Pale Ale? A strong bitter pop, especially late. The carbonation seems right on, and there is a creaminess to this one, a pleasure to drink. I often forgot I wasn't drinking an IPA because it left me wanting nothing more, like some APAs can. With the possible exception of Zombie Dust (boy would I love to test them side-by-side!) this is easily the best APA I've tasted.","RobbDogg","Apr 05, 2015"

I feel bad... had this after an Abner... and didn't get to really clean out my taste buds before this one. At a low 5% with the flavor you get... outstanding. EFB just has the magic touch... but like all their brews... just so hard to get your hands on... which in my opinion... goes to my sense of "feel."","fulcrumbs","Apr 01, 2015"
4.48,0.9,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Hazy opague amber orange much like Abner and similar fruitiness but with a much much lighter mouthfeel.  Unlike any other pale ales that I've had and very very VERY crushable and enjoyable.  Nose of any and all citrus fruits (particularly orange and mango).  Great beer to pair with food as it's so light in texture yet rustic and flavorful.  This is a all day on a boat in the hot sun kind of beer at 5.2% and one of the best pales I've ever had.  I'd put the Fort Point Pales from Trillium ahead of this but otherwise it's right up there.","HopDeezy","Apr 01, 2015"

Nice delicate mix. Flavor is sweet and sharply citrus initially, twhen turns to spicy and herbal. A lot of deliciousness to take in. Texture is smooth but loaded with prickly carbonation, subtle dryness, and slight hop resin grittiness. This is a great beer to have a growler of. It's got a distinct Hill Farmstead taste to it. Very fresh, hoppy, herbal, and spicy. A very likable beer.","tastybeer","Jan 04, 2015"

Delicious, mouthfeel is really full with a moderate carbonation. Very well balanced and a beer I will certainly look forward to having in the future.","mick303","Nov 26, 2014"

The taste is very fruity and hoppy. Nice pine, resin, mild tropical punch, light citrus. Refreshing take on a pale. Light body, light to medium carbonation, slightly drying hop finish. Overall, this is a great brew, thx to K0IZ for the pickup.","Stinkypuss","Aug 06, 2014"

It is a lot more dry than it is sweet, but I think it's a perfect balance of sugar. Crazy good crisp finish with a really pleasant lingering aftertaste.","Satchboogie","Aug 02, 2014"

Taste follows with citrus, mainly orange, and a piney resinous finish that is quite bitter for a pale ale. Slick mouthfeel coats the palate then in a flash goes away clean with a drying bitter finish. IPA like medium body is nice. Overall an amazing pale ale that delivers IPA mouthfeel and big flavor.","HopBomb515","Jun 24, 2014"

Citrusy hops, with a grapefruit character and a tropical fruitiness to it. Maybe a light piny sensation on the back end. The flavor is so similar. The hoppiness is heavy, but there isn't a overbearing bitterness. The fruitiness and light sweetness at the end is delightful.

A new favorite for sure, another reaffirmation that it was worth all the extra driving (3 hours round trip from Waitsfield) and line standing (an hour and a quarter, which I understand is about half of normal for a Saturday!) and money ($86 for 5.75 total liters or about $5.50 per 12 ounces including $19 for bottles) to get Hill Farmstead brews. Edward's relatively low ABV could make it the best session Pale Ale in existence.","scotorum","Apr 28, 2014"

This beer smells floral and fruity. Lovely light citrus, pineapple and mango for intense sweetness. Earthy pine that is not heavy and does not stand out past the other scents. The malt on this nose is a light sweet perfume. So wonderful how all Hill's beer has this quality of lightness both in the nose and in the drink. I think if I had to summarize Hill's trademark as a brewer I would do it like this - He is trying to put the hops in the beer and leave them on the vine at the same time. He has a way with hops and in this beer they are so fruity and yet so light on the palate. That's his other trademark, the light malt that is so light it's like the beer wants to just float out of the glass. Crisp, light sweetness like a floral nectar, a bit of light sweet cracker that has exactly the perfect balance. The beer has a resonance rather than an aftertaste and it's light floral and fruitiness. As the beer warms some sweet grass and pine comes forward and this is just a lovely beer.","utopiajane","Apr 20, 2014"

Citrus mostly, small amount of grassy pine. The taste is very crisp. Lots of orange flavor upfront. Very light and refreshing. Nice hoppy aftertaste, but not huge.

New thoughts on this beer, having had multiple of highly acclaimed American Pale Ales such as Zombie Dust, pseudoSue, etc. and having had the chance to enjoy this at least 8 times since the first growler I split back in September. The best thing about this beer is that it is so complex that each time I taste it, there's something different that stands out that was previously in the background. It has citrus, passion fruit, mango, floral, pine hop characters in there. Most of the time, citrus and passion fruit stands out, but other times the floral and pine stands out. It just seems to depend on how you're feeling that day. And either way the delicious malt backbone provides just enough sweetness along with the fantastic HF mouthfeel to make drinking this a real treat. It's not overwhelmingly bitter, is flavourful and almost juicy, and a true pleasure to drink no matter where I am in my day or my life. It's by far my favorite American Pale Ale and in my opinion, it is more or less perfect.","Stevedore","Feb 15, 2014"

From the first encounter, this uniquely flavorful and balanced pale really showed off how great a typically simple style can be if crafted properly. Lots of tropical, citrusy hop character with a lovely presence softened by notes of herbal grass, peach, and the pale bready malt body. Lush hops notes with a very tempered, midrange bitterness complimenting a light malt sweetness. Light-moderate body with a moderate carbonation and dry finish with a touch of resin.

Nose has the essential Hill Farmstead sweet cream butter going on in the nose along with fresh biscuit. Oh, there is a ton of dank hops but the malt character is more impressive as always. Taste is very quenching, soft, biscuity, sourdough, light fruitiness like cantaloupe and peach. Grassy, herbal hops come to balance. So nice to have a zero astringency, zero abrasive, zero specialty malt stickiness APA. Hill Farmstead has this style on lockdown and should write the textbook.","tarheels86","Sep 25, 2013"

As in some of their other hoppy beers, this plays an integral part in the aroma and the flavoring, giving a certain genuine brush to it, and making the grain and oily hoppiness that much more close, wholesome, and real. The hops through the flavoring, here, were insanely flavorful, juicy, and authentic, giving the illusion that one was literally sucking on a thin slice of dripping wet grapefruit. Again, this mixed with the exquisite base components, making for yet another memorable, thoughtful, and deliberate beer with true character.","TheBrewo","Jul 28, 2013"

I’m smelling huge amounts of citrus - predominantly grapefruit but also orange peel and a little bit of lemon zest. There’s a slight amount of piney aroma as well. The taste is almost perfection. It’s everything I want a pale ale to be. The malts and hops are completely balanced with an unrivaled lingering finish. The pale malt is wonderful. All the citrus is still there as it was on the nose and the fruity, citrusy hops are just enough without going too far. Mouthfeel is super creamy and it the head is retained all the way to the bottom of the glass. It would be tough to ask for a better pale ale.

Flavor started off with a hoppy flavor, but sweet hops with a bit of a orangy profile. Felt great in the mouth. Just a bit of cling to the insides, a tad too much kick on the tongue for my liking.

Good carbonation action throughout the body. Nose of lemon-lime citrus sweetness, pepper and basil spice, and a subtle biscuit backbone. Wow! Flavors of citrus and spiced hops on the forward tongue, followed by a light caramel sweet and bready backbone. Very balanced and very easy to drink. Body kept light by the carbonation. The aftertaste has piney and grassy hops characteristics, with a subtle citrus sweet linger. Clean, dry finish, begging for more. Flavorful and easy to drink, this one could be trouble.

The aroma is hoppy with some citrus and tropical fruits. Maybe tangerine? the taste is bitter apricots with nice tropical fruits. grapefruit notes as well. Nice bitterness with a good amount of fruity hop flavor. Dry and resinous. This is a Pale Ale with a lot of fruity and hoppy that rivals most IPAs. Overall, its bitter, hoppy and drinkable. Glad I got to try it. Fantastic Pale Ale worth seeking out.","PicoPapa","May 05, 2013"

I had Edward in a 12 oz glass and I must say, it was very smooth. It had a nice amount of hops, yet was not at all overpowering. There was a little foam when poured, but that quickly dissipated. It poured a nice light orange color and smelled very nice. I highly recommend this beer.","MitchD14","Apr 02, 2013"

4.3,-3.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,"The beer pours a hazy orange-yellow and several shades darker than Society and Solitude #6 (I just reviewed that beer, and that is why I am comparing them in color). The beer also pours with a big rocky, egg shell white head of varying sized bubbles which leaves sticky fat strings on the glass as it mellows into a finger’s width head. In body the beer is a cloudy haze, like most hoppy beers from Hill Farmstead. On the nose, the beer smells of juicy citrus hops with touches of tropical fruit and a solid backbone of pine. The malt is present as a light spicy bread and sweet caramel that melds nicely with the Hill Farmstead ale yeast’s breadiness. This is a nice smell that highlights the hops while still giving a good light malt character. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter sweet with a slight acidity from the hops. In flavor, the beer begins as juicy hops, featuring sweet orange and tangerine flavors with touches of tropical fruit before it blossoms into grapefruit, bitter pine, and then aspirin flavors that properly bite. Beneath the bitters rise a nice malt character that is slightly caramelly and mellow, it also features a slight spice grain flavor. The finish is surprisingly long and returns to the beginning’s juicy hop flavors only now with a solid cereal caramel flavor that is mellow and warming on the throat. The aftertaste brings the bitters back to the tongue with lingering whiffs of cereal malts. In the mouth, this beer feels medium light and creamy in body with a beautiful fluffy carbonation that I’m coming to expect from Hill Farmstead. The mouth is left bitter-dry but wet on the sides of the tongue from the hop acids. Overall, this may be my favorite American pale ale of those I have tried. Mo from the Maine Beer Company is a little behind it, though I think Mo had a better nose, but this beer handles its bitters beautifully and melds them into the malts so that each has its turn to shine on the palate. Its taste definitely surpasses Mo, and that is where it counts. This is another beautiful beer from Hill Farmstead. Try this beer.","Maxwell","Mar 31, 2013"

Reminds me of a toned down galaxy- I would say more prominent citrus notes and a bit of subtle tropical fruit in the background. The hops are lightly floral but still very juicy and I can still get some risinous tastes, but not too overwhelming. Taste is very well balanced- juicy and fruity hops come at you with grapefruit, tangerine, and a little lemon? I can notice the malt however its in the background and doesn't take away from the hoppy PA nature of the brew. Balance between the hops and malt is the key for this PA - however the hops are certainly brought to the forefront which is what I would want out of an PA of this nature. I prefer DIPAs above all else, however I loved this HF brew and I would certainly recommend it to anyone- don't let the APA style fool you, it still has tons of excellent hoppy character.","80x2HopHead","Mar 18, 2013"

Hazy orange complexion with a loose, quarter inch off-white head that dissipates into a consistent skim. Concentric bands of lacing encircle the shoulders of the glass. Nose expresses citrus and floral notes; slightly grassy and delicate with some biscuity aromas towards the back. Taste follows nose; however, more of an earthy/grassy character comes out in the flavor profile with the citrus notes lingering lightly and some hops bittering in the background. There's also a trace of wet cardboard at the finish. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a pleasant, palate cleansing carbonation. Overall, an immensely quaffable American Pale Ale that is a hallmark of the style in my humble opinion.","Jwale73","Mar 04, 2013"

The aroma is of pine and grapefruit. The flavor is goes along and one gets the citrus first followed by the piney essences. There is almost a resiny flavor from the hops. The bitterness lingers for a little bit on the back of the tongue before fading away slowly. This beer is light and mildly bubbly leaving just a hint of stickiness after the swallow. Overall, Edward is a very nice Pale Ale on the hoppier end of the spectrum.","Levich","Dec 31, 2012"

Flavorful bitterness, but never harsh. Medium to light body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a bready resinous mouthfeel.

Even though considered an APA, I say this one is pretty comparable to higher end IPAs like Pliny the Elder. Medium body, full of flavor and highly drinkable, for an excellent beer overall.","Rifugium","Apr 23, 2012"

While present in copious amounts, the hop flavor seems slightly dulled and dare I say, a little oxidized? As with the nose, the flavor leans heavily on the fruity hops. Mango, clementines and grapefruit lend plenty of flavor, and the bitterness is low. The Cascade (dry hop?) character is particularly noticeable. The malt character is clean, cracker-like, mildly doughy and unobtrusive. Drying on the finish with a lingering hop flavor (particularly the citrus) and a mildly resiny (and gorgeous) bitterness. Light in body with soft, gentle carbonation that's perfect for the style, this beer is extremely enjoyable. I'm glad to have tried it, but I have a feeling this batch is just a touch old.","DefenCorps","Nov 30, 2011"

There is a nice bit of pineapple and other tropical fruit flavors. The finish leaves some fruit flavors and hop bitterness lingering on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a nice smooth feel to it. There is a nice amount of hop bitterness here, with some nice fruity sweetness that gives it nice balance. This has really good drinkability.

Taste follows the amazing scent, fruity and juicy, full flavored (this is a pale ale? stronger than many IPAs!) without being overly bitter.

4.24,-4.5,4,5,4,4,4,"Edward pours a nearly solid (opaque) orange, with a thin bit of white foam sitting atop the beer. That little head is definitely spunky, it sticks around longer than I would have expected, but it only leaves a tiny bit of lacing. The nose is absolutely wonderful, dank with grapefruit, pineapple, and orange aromas. Forget IPAs, this bad boy is more pungent than some imperial IPAs that I've had. There's a brief flash of cracker maltiness at the front of each sip, before some (but not all) of the hoppy goodness hinted at by aroma is delivered. There's also a bit of an off aftertaste that I usually associate with Simcoe hops that lingers for a second after each sip. The body is a bit on the light side, appropriate for the style, yet still sturdy enough not to be completely overrun by the hops. The carbonation is just a little off though, the beer falls dull by the time it reaches the back of my palate. Still though, Edward is one of the better American Pale Ales I've had, and an excellent choice for someone who wants a serious hop fix within a lower ABV beer.","axeman9182","Sep 04, 2011"

The bone dry bitterness of this would keep me from actively seeking it out so I'll give it a 4, but this is a really memorable and intense beer. this pushes the limit of a Pale Ale, and is fresh and vibrant tasting.

I imagine it owes some of its greatness to its freshness, but either way this is an excellent beer. It's wonderfully hoppy, bitter and flavorful without having some of the dehydrating characteristics of some IPAs and APAs, and would make a great all-night beer. At the anniversary party and in the three growler fills I've had, Edward is the beer I keep coming back to at Hill Farmstead. I dream of one day having a bierkeller with old shelves stocked full of beer around an old oak table and a keg of Edward at hand.","FrankLloydMike","Jul 22, 2011"

All I can say is citrus and flowers work so well together whilst smelling this beer. The flavor is quite tasty as well. It's good for it's style and the malt body accents the perfectly added hops.

The body is a rather light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry, kinda sticky finish.

Poured a murky yellow-orange with a one finger bone white head that subsided to a very minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. The citrus aspect on this one kept me coming back for more. I really like citrus in my beer (no, not like the citrus people like in their Blue Moons) so this one was a no-brainer for me. Really glad I got to try this one.

The taste drives this up to the next level--simply awe-inspiring. Wow, so good. There really isn't any hint at all of malt, other than that it adds a bit of a base so the beer's not too thin.

A very solid APA, this one is very drinkable.","nkersten","Feb 11, 2011"
4.05,-8.8,4,4,4,3.5,4.5," The taste has a lot of vegetal hoppiness-grassy at times with mild taste of green herbal acidic hops which gives the impression of some tea-like astringency. The hops have a spiciness w/ slight peppery heat and there is mild sweetness from the malt w/ a faint citrus element as it finishes. I think this is a great beer, but it straddles the line between IPA and American Pale: it has the hoppiness of an IPA but lacks the malt and alcohol so it comes off as more bitter and yet still is highly drinkable for the style. I think this is an excellent beer, but hard to rate it higher since it is flavorful but seems slightly out of place in the traditional American pale category.","Slatetank","Feb 07, 2011"

The floral nose is exceptional, with a two-finger head and lacing that lingers for quite some time. Taste is delicious and sesionable - good hoppy bite up front, though not as hop-forward as a West Coast IPA, but very smooth with a mild creamy aftertaste, likely aided by the residual lacing.

4.38,-1.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Edward arrives at my table an ever so slightly hazy orange amber. It is dressed in a nonic pint glass with a wonderful frothy white head. The head has slightly above average retention, but leaves some of the prettiest lace I have ever seen, perfectly chronicling the volume of every sip on the side of the glass. The aroma is wonderfully fruity with a nice citrusy "C" hop vibe as well as some bright grassiness. I also catch a hint of bready malt in there. The taste is killer with plenty of citrusy grapefruit, lemon and pine hoppiness, as well as some more earthy and grassy notes. This is definitely a very hop forward APA, but it also has a very pleasantly bready, slightly caramel malt backbone that does its job well. It holds up firm bitterness and keeps this beer from being a tongue bruiser. This has to be the most enjoyable straight up pale ale that I have had in a very long time. The mouthfeel is pretty much perfection. Lighter side of medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation and an amazingly clean finish. This beer has great drinkability and I can very easily imagine throwing a few back with good friends. I am definitely looking forward to trying more of Hill Farmsteads offerings after enjoying this awesome brew.","zoso1967","Jul 25, 2010"
3.86,-13.1,4,3,4,4,4.5,"Edward pored a light amber with an inch of white head. Aroma was of fragrant hops, but seemed average for pale ales. Flavor was an excellent balance of sweet caramel malt, clean hop bitterness, and spicy hop flavor. It had more of a hop presence than I expected from a Pale Ale, but it was still balanced and pleasing.","amccormi","Jul 24, 2010"
4,-9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer was an amber orange, clear with no head. The smell was of fruity hops and a clementine orange and grapefruit aroma that I associate with Amarillo or C hops hops. The beer tasted almost solely of hops: grassy, herbal, with a sustaining bitter finish. The body of the beer was a little thin but good to style, with a dry finish. This was a good beer that I would order again","Soonami","Jul 24, 2010"

3.68,-17.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Taste is refreshing and quite malty, I just had a chinooker'd so that mght be why I feel like there's so little hops here. Malt is really refreshing and almost reminiscent of a a German beer. It's a good beer but not a hop bomb at all.","kingcrowing","Apr 28, 2010"
4.72,6.3,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"D: Fantastic. Again, referencing the Alchemist, this beer has the taste and drinkability of Holy Cow with the aromatics of Heady Topper - the best of both worlds. The hops are intoxicating in their own right; hard to believe this is only 5.7%ABV.","skivtjerry","Apr 27, 2010"
4.37,-1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Had this on tap at American Flatbread in Burlington, VT. A very fresh tasting and well balanced IPA with a solid backbone of hops. A well crafted amber-ish IPA. The freshness of the hops really jumps out of the glass. It's obvious the ingredients that went into this beer were of the highest quality. Very well done! Looking forward to more from these guys.","abriggs1","Apr 27, 2010"
