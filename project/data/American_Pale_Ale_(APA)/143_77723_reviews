"3/22...pours copper amber, mostly clear, some white foam. Light caramel sweet nose, malty. Taste is a thin open, light body,  modest hop, fast close. Smooth. A little chewy, fruity like an english pale would be. Simple but enough of a flavor profile to stay interested."
""
"Nice balance of malts and hops...didn't go overboard on either"
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a clear medium amber with a white sudsy head and possesses mild notes of grain malts, floral hops, caramel and a stale cardboard odor. This brew is a little lighter than I expected, it has a very mild hoppiness and a light caramel sweetness and not much else. Really nothing special here... www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReviews"

"Great color and very refreshing taste. Not much of a smell but very light and good drinkable! Bottle has a nice design too."
""
"If it didn't have the off flavor in the finish this would be quite a good brew indeed."
""
"Very mild. But very good pale ale. Not super hoppy or super malty. Very well made beer."
"Very boring beer. Not very hoppy or flavorful. Would buy these for a large gathering if you're having a lot of people for a BBQ or want a decent beer that's not a light beer"
"Pours a dark clear golden color with average head and damn nice clingy lacing. Aroma is light with touches of malt and some citrusy hops. Flavor is similar to aroma, this beer is very light and subdued. The maltiness seems to be more of the hero here, but some of the hops and a small amount of citrus do come out. This was not what I expected from a pale ale, but not too bad..."
""
"2/7 - Home (Bottle) - Decent Shiner offering. Somewhat strong, but a bit bland for an Pale Ale. Better than their standard offerings, and would have again if given the chance."
""
""
"Overall OK, but nothing special, decent malts, decent hops, a little icky bitterness, probably a meh hop added to some decent ones."
""
"Pours orange/amber and clear with an almost khaki head of foam.  Clear.  Nose is caramel and a herbal hops.  Cracker malt with a bit of richness.  Drinks citrusy, light tangerine, a bit piney and tangy.  Crisp.  Light body medium carbonation.  Not really dry finish."
""
""
"O - ok APA, I actually would have scored it a bit higher if categorized as an EPA. I don't think I'll come back to this one anytime soon."
"Holds its own the top tier pale ales"
""
"Shiner didn't fail with it's pale ale"
""
"Should be a safe bet for almost anyone.  Craft drinkers will appreciate that it's smooth and has solid flavor, and people used to fizzy North American brews will appreciate that it's not too terribly strong."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pretty reddish-orange in color with a good 1+-finger foamy/creamy off-white head. Lots of 'sheet lacing' was seen when sipped, which surprised me actually. The aroma is of malts. Pretty much the same for the taste but was pretty smooth and went down easy, unlike many pale ales. Just a very slight taste of hops for the finish but was gone in a few seconds. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Very tasty and really liked this one."
""
""
"Picked up one of Spoetzl's mixed six pack, and this was included.  Poured out the bottle into a pint glass, it had a decent off-white head with nice lacing. The color was a dark amber, or light brown.  Slight aroma, mostly of malt.  The taste is pleasant, with a bit of maltiness and very slight hops taste. According to the label they use Munich malts and U.S. Golding & Bravo hops.  I would say that this is a 'Pale Ale Light', fine for the times you don't want a strongly flavored ale. It's definitely not retired - I have seen it in all the mixed six packs from Spoetzl."

"Two things.... #1.This Pale Ale is NOT retired and #2. It is actually a QUALITY Pale Ale...Well Done Shiner!"
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer was okay. It's not going to be a go-to beer or anything like that, but it was good. I'd much rather have a Shiner than something like Coors or Miller or anything like that. I drank this beer straight out of the glass bottle. In the end, this beer is just an average at best (or slightly above average) beer."
"O: Nothing great about this beer, might be why its retired, easy drinker and nothing complex about it."

"Pretty weak pale ale, not very hoppy taste at all and no real hints of citrus or anything else.  Smooth-drinking but I like my IPA stronger with a heavier hoppy flavor.   Typical of a Shiner beer, not bad but not great."
""
""
"Nice caramel mix with pale malt.  Nothing groundbreaking here.  A solid, slightly above average APA that is easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Lots of caramel flavor. Very little hop. I'd say this is too sweet for a pale ale. Rich body, lowly carbonated. Short cloy aftertaste."

"What happened when, while the lady was gardening, she bent over to pull up some carrots that a rabbit had already set its sights on? She got a Wild Hare up her ass! I simply unscrewed the top on mine and held it upside down by its back legs in order to skin it. It tried to rabbit on me, but I am wise to those sorts of tricks so I held tightly to its tail until it settled down. The pseudo-cascade formed three fingers of dense, tawny head that slowly fell, leaving behind some great lacing. Color was Amber to Deep Amber/Light Copper (SRM = > 9, "

"Poured a cloudy amber color with golden highlights when held to light and two fingers of fluffy off-white head. It's pretty good looking, though with maybe a bit too much head formation. Scents of bready malt, light fruity esters reminiscent of apple, light notes of tangerine flesh and a light level of floral and grassy hop aromas. Malty and delicate, with a low level of hop aromas and a moderate level of fruity esters overall. Far more like an English Pale Ale than an American. Flavor begins with notes of bready, biscuity malt with a touch of caramel and medium-light floral hop flavors. This moves into a slightly drier yet still lightly sweet middle with a moderate level of floral hop flavor, a touch of apple-like fruitiness and a bit of sweet malt. Finish lightly dry with moderate flavors of floral and herbal hops, a light touch of apple and a bit of orange peel. Aftertaste is dry with notes of floral and herbal hops and biscuity malt. The flavor profile is balanced and not overly hoppy, with flavors most resembling an English Pale or an older style American. Not groundbreaking, but pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with medium-low carbonation and a smooth feel. Nicely drinkable and true to style. Overall this is a serviceable Pale Ale. It's balanced in flavor and aroma, smooth and easy to drink. It's not the hoppiest or the most experimental American Pale around, nor is it the best simple pale ale, but it's good in its own way."
""
""
""
"Appearance: Darker than I am used to for a pale ale. Pleasant amber color with a nice finger-worth of head. Smell: Not much to it for me. Some malts and grains and some hops as well. Taste/mouthfeel: Kind of fruity/citrus-y with a definite presence of hops. I am not normally a fan of IPAs, and this one, to me, was moodle of the road overall. It was tasty, but I won't buy it again."
""
""
"My impression is that this is a good beer, but not a great one. It has a decent amount of flavor, and nothing negative in it. My biggest complaint would be that it seems a touch watered down, like it is close to being very flavorful, then they got a bit timid and scaled it back. Had they just allowed the flavors to fully emerge, this would have been a standout. Still, it is pleasant enough, and a good beer for a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear light amber pour with a small head and light carbonation. Nice grainy aroma. Flavor is pretty basic with a bit of sweet and bready malt backed by a light grassy hop bitterness with just a hint of grapefruit. Crisp finish. Very basic...not bad but nothing stands out to make me want another."

""

"I really did not like this one. Upon reading reviews I was really excited to try this beer, as I love fruity beers. But I got no fruit flavor what so ever. I was very disappointed. The best thing about this beer was the appearance. It looked exactly how a beer is supposed to look. Nice amber color. Taste at first was kind of rotton but it got to tasting a bit bitter after that. I just did not care for it at all. I finished it out of obligation not to waste it honestly."

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s an ok beer overall but there are several other choices in the style that are better."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a decent sized but short lived off white head. Aromas of bread and light caramel maltiness with hints of fruit and earthy hops. The flavor holds more earthy hop flavor than the aroma suggested backed up by a solid bready caramel malt base and lots of sugary fruitiness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Decent pale ale, but kind of middle of the road. Nothing flawed, but a bit boring."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"My favorite of the Shiner series recently released in CT. Nice hazy yellow color. The smell had a lot of hop to it and the taste was similar with a lot of pine notes and a very clean finish. The mouthfeel was a little thick for a pale ale, but overall it was a decent beer."

"Notes: Nice label. Retro. Deep golden / light amber in color. Creamy off-white head. Good retention and better than average lacing. Aroma of malt and hop: gently sweet, bready, slightly caramelish malt and leafy/grassy/floral hops ~ quite English in nature hop-wise, not what I think of as ""American""; and ""European"" in malt, but again, not ""American"". Overall, balanced a bit too far towards sweet malt. The hops are nice (pleasantly floral against the sweet/bready malt). Easy-going basic pale ale that's got enough to satisfy."

"Pours a beautiful redish amber ... pillowy head (two finger plus) .. settles to an attractive short head with impressive lacing. Not much noticeable about the aroma ... pretty neutral. Clean taste with a hint of fruitiness ... nicely hopped. Clean, crisp finish. Silky smooth on the palette .. very pleasing mouth feel. A good ale that I wouldn't hesitate to have again."
""
""
""
""
"O: I understand why other people don't rate this highly because its not trendy in the pale ale style. It's subdued. It's wet with a hint of dryness. It's quite good if you're not looking for the modern big pale ale. It's good but mellow for the style."

"O: too sweet, tastes sugared up or flavored but not to the point of undrinkability; definitely a gateway beer at best, for there's more sweet here than anything and next to no hop presence; almost more of a bad imitation of an English pale than anything like an American pale"

"ive done my share of bashing on shiner, we all have, but ive had three solid beers from them lately, so it time for reassessment. yeah, this pale ale isnt zombie dust, but its pretty darn good. clear amber tinted pale beer with a passable white head. the nose is citrusy hops, light and fruity with very little bitter. slightly richer malt profile gives some body. the hops really shine in the flavor, really citrusy, lemons and limes even, its quite a nice surprise. malt supports it with a touch of english sweetness, but the finish is clean, almost like a lager, a delicious combination, highly drinkable, and one of the better shiner brand brews ive gotten into. a six of this on a hot day would be enjoyable work. time to give shine another chance folks."

"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and medicinal yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, yeast, and earthy citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is fairly drinkable but the yeast presence in the aroma and flavor somewhat dominate things in this one."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, a bit of fruit. Taste is well balanced. Hops coming first, mild bitterness, strong malt backbone at the finish. A touch of fruit is there as well. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"I am typically quick to judge, but have learned when tasting beer to give the chosen brew a chance to grow on me - Shiner Wild Hare Pale Ale did just that. At first taste I was slightly taken back by the strong citrus and harsh hops, but in the end this beer shined as a well-balanced beer, perfect for the fall."

"enjoyable pale, but not what I look for in one. too sweet and not enough hops is a death knell for me."
""
"O: It's not a bad beer at all. it definitely has flavor and has a decent amount of alcohol. Once the beer warmed up the floral and piney flavors that are often found in IPA's became much more present. I wish the carbonation wasn't so strong and that the head was more consistent but other then that it was enjoyable. The lacing did not stay throughout the whole time and the beer eventually looked like I had some apple juice in my glass."

""
"Shiner Wild Hare Pale may, as the brewery advertises, have 'assertive aromas' and 'hoppy brightness' to drinkers that have only ever known commercial lagers. But anyone who's accustomed to truer, better brewed examples of the style will find it unsatisfying and lackluster. That was my impression anyhow. Not something I care to drink again."
""
""
"This is quite a nice APA from the Shiner brand. It may not be an intensely hoppy APA that everyone loves to rave about, but this is a solid, highly drinkable, flavorful, balanced beer that has just enough hop character to keep you interested and a solid malt backbone. This is a beer I could definitely knock back."

"Pours a dark golden amber with an lasting off white head, some moderate lacing. Aroma and Taste of caramel malt, some fruity notes and light floral hops. A medium body with moderate carbonation on the palate. Finishes with caramel malt, yeasty, light floral hops with a bit of a nutty ending. Overall an good session brew for late summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Not a bad APA, however, I haven't had many, and my rating may change as I find better ones out there. I did enjoy this, and Shiner was surprisingly unafraid to let their hop characteristics shine through strong here."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Slow gusher upon opening. Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, bread, floral, grass, slight pine, light pepper, and light floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, bread, floral, grass, light pine, light pepper, and floral earthiness. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, caramel, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance of malt and hop flavors; with no cloying flavors after the finish. A little lacking in flavor robustness. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty solid pale ale. Quite pleasant in flavor and balance, but lacking in some aspects. An enjoyable offering."

"Pretty uninspiring APA. Would work in a pinch, but truly nothing to get excited about"

"I am not sure what the problem is with this beer: the people who wrote the labels never drank it, or the people who make it don't know how to brew. It claims to be a classic American pale ale with a golden color. I will have to recheck the color, but it seems more medium to dark amber than golden from memory. And classic pale ale? No. It has a yeasty sourness to it that I do not associate with a classic pale ale. Now you call it a saisson and all the foo foo belgian snobs will give it a 4.5, maybe that is just showing my anti saisson snobbishness. Anyway, its not a bad beer, if you can handle the sourness. And, it could be a great bargain as the people truly looking for a 'classic American pale ale' stay away and Shiner cuts the price to sell the stuff. Of course, if the people at Shiner really can't keep the yeasties out of their ale when they want to, you'll just be taking your chances with this."

"If you like hops, this is an excellent beer. The first impression is a very floral, aromatic hop aroma that is counterbalanced by a much more restrained maltiness. Nice amber color and head, mouthfeel is refreshing. Kudos to Spoetzl for brewing a beer that delivers on hop flavor without the overkill of many IPAs"
""
""
""

"O: This beer is easy to drink but I wasn't overall crazy about the flavor of the hop profile."

"Pours a hazy orangish brown with a medium off white head. Aromas of molasses and grain. Taste begins with some plums, then some oatmeal, and a slightly salty, earthy finish. Decent mouthfeel. Overall a below average pale ale. One of Shiners weaker offerings IMO."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a clear light copper/brass color with a thin quick to fade white head atop.A decent shot of floral hops mixed with some caramel/biscuit malts with neither winning out over the other.The hops don't show much presence on the palate with mainly lithly toasted biscuit malt flavors.The feel is pretty light and ho hum.Eh it goes down easy but there are better ""no brainer"" beers to be had out there."

"Pours a clear copper color with a well retaining white head that leaves some good lace on the pint. Aroma of caramel and floral hop. In the taste, light caramel and bitter, earthy hops. A little bread and then finishes with a grassy bitterness. The mouthfeel is light to medium and a bit watery. Carbonation is good. Overall this is about average for an American pale. Par for the course."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"overall, i'm sort of impressed. what it lacks in aroma and body is quickly made up by the taste, mouthfeel and quenchability/bitterness. for a Shiner product , it exceeded my expectations, and certainly has a wild hair (sic)."
""
""
""
""
"This pours a semi-cloudy, golden amber color with a thin beige head. The aroma has a weak scent of grains and yeast that is overtaken by the smell of hops. The taste is kind of unique for a pale ale as it has a little bit of spiciness to the hops. Drinks a little more like a spiced beer than a pale ale to me. Drinkable a fairly decent for the price."

"Overall: not a bad pale ale but not a great one either. probably won't buy again, prefer schlafly."
""
""
""
"Spoetzl's first ale ever, testing the waters with a Pale Ale. We guess it would have been odd if they jumped into barrel-aged Double IPAs. Wild Hare sits in the middle of the pack; balance and drinkability seem to have been the focus. Give this one a whirl."
""
""
""
"This offering pours up a deep clear copper with a 1 finger head, a thin retention ring and lots of lacing. Smell is mostly grasses and biscuit. Taste is a mild citrus with a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is about average without a lot of carbonation. An okay beer, but just okay."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, sweet malt, hint of grass, and hint of pale malt. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight grass, slight citrus hops, hint of caramel malt, and hint of pale malt. Overall, great appearance and mouth feel, but the hops were too much of a secondary feature for an American Pale Ale."
""
""
"Drinkability: It is a decent brew and offers a nice spiciness. However, that is really not what I expect from this style."
""
""
""
"a malty sweetness. Odd flavor for a APA (in a good way) If this was a blind taste test I would have thought I was drinking a wheat beer. Good carbonation with a medium to heavy mouth feel. It had a slightly dry sweet orange finnish. I would have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not bad at all. I could buy a sixer of it and drink them all without complaint. I don't think it's world class, but it's tasty enough to enjoy. A good effort, hopefully Spoetzl will keep trying new and bolder beers over time."
""
""
""
"Overall - For a Pale Ale, it's very malty almost to a fault but there isn't any particularly bad about it. At the very least it's worth checking out but be prepared for a decent but imbalanced flavor"

"I could go for a dish of wild hare about now... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunrise amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises light orange zest, light BO (and I checked: it's not mine...), biscuit, and funky greens. The taste brings in more of the same (minus the BO, of course), with a slightly more pronounced orange character. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, an uninspired pale. It's not really bad, per se, but it's not very good, either. Average at best."
"Had this on tap at a Casino , not a bad looking beer at all , but average in smell and taste. Had a nice head on it with very little lacing. The flavor was kind of a generic pale ale for me , but most brews from this brewer all seem like a good idea that someone just stopped short on. It was free so I wont complain , but I wouldnt purchase it myself"

"O - This is an okay pale ale. It is an inexpensive brew with the potential to be a gateway beer."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: For a beer from Texas, this is not a beer to drink cold, or at least not for me anyway. Cold it's offputting - the smell and the taste made me think it was way past due, but as it warmed up more of its charm came out. It grew on me, but I think that was because it was so bad at first and as it got better I did a bit of ""oh thank god I won't have to drainpour this - it's not so bad after all"" but that's not a good way to start a beer. It's not your typical APA. Once warm its just above average, but before that....it's a beer to avoid. I do wonder if this beer is a bit old, but no way of knowing. So overall, it's just okay if warm. Drinkability - one is enough."
""
"I like this beer a lot. I am very impressed."
""
""
""
"Pours to to a decent white head and moderate lacing. Golden amber color. Aroma is citrus hops and sweet malt. Flavor is a mild mix of citrus, lemon, pepper and dry malt. Mouthfeel is light and co2 is moderate. Overall, a light version of APA well suited for the texas heat."
""
""
"Tiankfully, the alcohol wasn't detectable here and only leant a bit of a warming effect to the beer. This could have been more full, hoppy, and carbonated but as a near-session beer, it suffices. Only lovers of Shiner or this style should give it a go."
""
""
"Wild Hare may not be the most flavorful American Pale Ale, but it really isn’t bad and I am convinced that most people will find that it does meet their minimum standards. It is priced lower than most APA also and is widely available for a craft or semi- craft beer. Try it and see what you think- I’m betting you will find it to your liking, by a hare."
""
""
"Pours reddish copper in color w/delightful head. Good bitterness, aroma kind of flowery imo. Goes down very easy but watch out this is a pretty strong brew if you're used to drinking standard lager like Budweiser or Coors. I like Blue Moon and Sierra Nevada pale ales and this one is on par with those brews. Anything from Shiner is good"
""
""
""
""
"A well-balanced brew. It's an APA, not an IPA, but even for that it is thin. Still, it is easy-to-drink. Just on the thin side."
""
""
""
"3.53/5.00"
"The feel is brisk and light and plenty crisp with a slightly more than moderate carbonation. It could use a bit more cleanness to it, and while the lightness of the body is appropriate, it does seem thin at times, but it's not bad."

"Comes out of the tap a somewhat hazy and very appetizing copper-gold with a respectable pale wheat head. Strong aroma is malty and fruity, providing tones of apple and pear and a hint of banana. Flavor is mainly fruity, pear and apple and a bit of banana, malty and hoppy notes and a touch of horehound. Texture has good body and sassy fizz.

"Mouthfeel: This is an easy drinking a clean bodied pale ale. It is medium body which allows the palate to hang on to the flavors more than a typical pale ale."

"Overall: Not overly bold, but not entirely mild, it's a decent, inoffensive pale ale."
""
"Overall an average pale ale but not terrible in any way. Good for those who don't like too much hops."
""
""
"Taste-Toasted malt, caramel, faint floral and earthy hop note. Overall, a pretty tame, malt forward, entry-level pale ale."
"as a resident of los angeles with access to loads of west coast pale ales, my judgment of this texas brew may be biased. poured a coppery red tone with a smallish white head topping the glass. aromas threw me off - i get something of an estery, wheat-like nose coming off this one in addition to the caramel malts. label claims there is both ""assertive aromas"" and ""hoppy brightness"". the amlt characteristics are more prevalent than the US hop combination in my opinion. fruitier than i would have thought. i probably had built up in my mind a bit of an expectation for this beer, but it wasn't that great. the mirror pond i revisited in the store was better, but when in te-jas you gotta go with the local. nothing special here."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Decent hue, with a nice bubbly head, and a bit of lacing. Nose has some interesting compliments to the malt body manifesting sweet and floral components. Flavor is blunt malt and pine with plant-y characteristics. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
"Big disappointment. Not even a good pilsner, but a pretty bad pale ale. Don't bother."
"There’s a faint aroma—so faint I struggled to pick anything up. Maybe like orange juice, not quite a fresh citrus smell but more like a juiced concentrate scent. Tastes similar, with a faint orange juice flavor which is lost under a malt bill more towards an amber ale. Felt like this was a pretty one-dimensional brew. [Insert ‘wild hare’ replaced by a ‘tame bunny’ joke here.]"
"overall, this is an average pale ale. a bit more flavor could have done wonders for it, but it is honestly nothing out of the ordinary. still a decent cheap beer for summer days, and i see it has a modest abv% so that's not so bad!"
"O: To be quite honest, I'm confused on why Spoetzl mirrored Great Divide's labeling and design. The beer is not all that ""wild"" and I'm disappointed overall."
""
""
"I thought that this was an above average Pale Ale that fell somewhere between the English and American styles but was still pretty flavorful and very easy drinking. This bottled tasted pretty fresh, which I think was key to my overall enjoyment of it. I’d definitely have another."
"O:  Decent but pretty one dimensional. Flavors are subtle and not overly impressive.  I really expected more from this but it seems to come off as cheap. "

"O - Shiner's Wild Hare is certainly not something I'd have the dog fetch, but it's also not offensive. The oddities in the aroma seem to disappear, but the flavor is, quite candidly, weak in hoppiness, something Shiner can't afford to have going on with the strong competition in the market. Refreshing nonetheless, Wild Hare would make for a good lawnmower beer, just a little beefier than the ""standard"" lager."

"Overall: Not a great beer but a good, solid brew. Easy to drink and enjoyable. Tastes just as good in the bottle as it does in the glass so perfect for parties with no proper glassware."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours clear light copper with an eggshell colored head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts and hops. There is a citrus smell due to the hops. The aroma is fairly mild, but pleasant. The flavor is sweet from the malts. The hop flavors add some bitterness as well as some citrus. The aftertaste is not strong. There's a metallic taste that is almost typical of Shiner beer. The body is light to medium with adequate carbonation. The drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a very good beer and a solid effort from Shiner. Here's to 103 years."

"o: not bad for their first apa. easy enough to drink the six pack. the only thing i didnt like, there was a mineral presence like i pick up in samuel smith beers, maybe from the water used."

"I went into this with high hopes for some reason. It wasn't as good as I'd hoped. Everything happens right of the top and then just washes out."
""
"Clear orange, thin white head that leaves sparse patches of lace. Prominent bread crust malt with a kiss of caramel. Orange peel and herbs form the light hop profile. Clean and crisp. Pretty much what I was expecting out of Shiner - an easy drinking ale with broad appeal."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent pale ale, maybe a higher rating than it deserves when compared to world class ales, but a step up from the regular Shiner lineup."
""
"Overall, one of the better ones from Shiner in a while, despite not living up to the style. But Shiner Bock is one of my favs, despite it's own shortcomings. I'll get this again."
"O: Overall, it is not bad I guess. Its nothing to go crazy about. If I wasn't from Texas and have a soft spot in my heart for Spoetzl brewery, I would not be happy with my purchase...."
""
"The beer pours a medium orange-amber color with a large off-white head. The aroma is quite floral with some bread notes also mixed in. I also get some orange citrus and perfume notes in the aroma. The flavor is full of bread and toffee with some floral and perfume notes. The beer has very little bitterness and the floral notes are quite sweet. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"I could taste malt and spice, with a nicely balanced hop finish. I have tried most of Shiner's offerings, and this may be their most flavorful to date. This pale ale is very easy to drink, yet still has plenty of flavor. I would not say this is among the very best among this type I have tried, but Shiner has a good effort with Wild Hare Pale Ale."
""
"Refreshing with a good light body and carbonation. Balanced and drinkable."

""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours a golden color with a large foamy white head which leaves a lacing. The smells are of bread and caramel malts, light hops. The feel is medium. The taste is okay, better than most shiner products but less than many apa, caramel, light hops bread malts."
""
"Overall: A nice session or lawn mower beer, but a pretty timid APA. Glad to see Shiner trying seasonals and experimenting a bit, but they don't stray too far from the shallow end of the pool. Nothing wrong here, just doesn't wow me much."
""
""
""
"Light-medium bodied, medium carbonation, just a little dryness in the palate."
""
""
""
"Tastes like barely competent homebrew."
"Overall, this is a very unremarkable beer. I'm a P1 of Shiner Bock (my go-to on the golf course), but Wild Hare comes up a little empty for me. Not a bad offering, but not particularly memorable either. I'd drink another if offered, but I'm not going in search of another bottle, either."
""
""
"MF- A nice moderate body, and the heavy carbonation lets the flavors, as bad as they may be, linger for a little while."
"So, overall, it's pretty decent. I'd buy this beer on occasion. And I'll be looking forward to their next adventure too.."
"O- After the reviews and word of mouth, I was greatly surprised by how much I enjoyed this beer. I call it a nice effort by Shiner and a welcome new direction in pale ales."
""
""
""
""

"The mouthfeel gets it a little bit right with finally a hint of hop bitterness. Combined with a crisp carbonation and a mild bodied texture you have a forgettable session beer. I wish there was more to this but overall it's a drinkable disappointment. Happy to see it as it might push more mundane beer drinkers towards superior beverages but overall it's a pass."
""

"What is with the fruity yeast going on here? It is the Red Delicious of the apple world...milly, mushy and makes you want to throw it at a car. I know it is Shiner's first ale and all...but really...did you have to let the yeast run this rampant? The bitterness is there, but where is the hop flavor? I was hoping this would be a nice, moderately priced beer to quaff on through the summer months here. No, that will not be happening. This is a bad example of a Pale Ale, reminds me of the Saranac lineup I had over the holidays."
""
""
"O - Very easy going IPA. I've seen and heard people judge it like a commercial IPA, but I appreciate the sentiment to step outside the box for a typically German brewing company. I would liken it most to the analogy of Molson:Budweiser::Sierra Nevada IPA:Wild Hare. There is obviously a difference, but I wouldn't be disappointed one way or the other.."
""
""

"O- My roommate brought this home and I thought that maybe Shiner was going to make something a little more ""craft"" but then I poured the bottle into the glass. Will not be buying ever, glad I didn't this time."

"If you're someone who enjoys pale ales, you won't think much of this beer. But if you're looking for something a bit more hoppy and complex than your Miller High Life, this is the beer for you."
""
""
""
"Golden-brown in appearance with a good 2 finger head after pour, with excellent lacing. You can definitely smell the hops- with tones of floral and citrus. It's pretty mellow, but you get a nice bite and hoppy character towards the end of the sip. Overall, excited about Shiner's first Pale Ale- It seems that Shiner is starting to get more creative and coming out with more complex beers."
"But overall this is an EPIC FAILURE"
"Solid, Shiner. Solid. Pretty honey color with a fluffy white head afloat on top. What a beeeewteefull smell of hoppiness. No too much, not too little, but right on the money for a pale ale- Goldilocks. Just enough malty backbone mixed with the citrusy (I'm sick of hearing/citrusy, but it applies here). Sturdy mouthfeel w/o feeling like your drinking cotton balls. Mostly clean finish with a little syrupy residue, but it's fine. Just fine. I like it, Shiner. Now go fix your ""bock."""
"Thank you Shiner!"
"Overall: This is typical Spoetzl, all hype and no delivery. I was told that this is gunna be one of their best beers yet and I have yet to find one I really like. There is just way too much malt and sweetness."
