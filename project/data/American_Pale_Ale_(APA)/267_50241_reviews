"Between this and the Denver Pale Ale, those are my favorite pale ales."
""
"have had great bottles of this beer then also skunky German pilsner flavors (Heineken).  the good ones had fresh resinous hop profile with good malt backbone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a world class beer."

"Billed as an extra pale ale. I like that style a little dryer, lower abv.  Seems more like an ipa or stronger spectrum pale. Golden-yellow, translucent. Hops subtle citrus, i get a little pine. Mostly malt forward. I'll drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very pleasant and outstanding APA. It has its own character, superbly balanced for hop heads, not cloying and hoppy and crisp. That is definitely a 6-pack beer, to have it in every season."
""
""
"This is a pretty good summer seasonal, though I prefer some other Odell brews a little more.  Not sure it's really that much different than 5 Barrel or even their IPA, but once again, I'll drink it if it's out there.  Harder to find than most of their other beers as well, but worth a look."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a delicious and very refreshing pale ale. Among my favorites in this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of citrus hops and high ABV could easily pass for an IPA. Flavor dominated by hops, would expect more balance from an APA. Overall tasty,will definitely buy again"
""
"Turbid golden body with resinous floating particles & creamy tan head. Floral and caramel malt nose and flavors."
""
""

""

"Pretty solid, not a ton of depth, but very crisp and pretty tasty"

"Great, exactly what I want in a beer!"

"Overall: Get it whilst you can, because it's not gonna hang around! Anyone with even a passing interest in any kind of pale ale really should give it a blast. Probably the best thing I've tasted in months!"
""
""
""
""

"O - Best Pale ale I have had in awhile. Almost - IPA-ish. Get some!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good take on a APA. Very good taste of citrus and earthy hops with a nice malt backing. One of the better hop forward versions of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Iâ€™m impressed with this beer, as I have been with most beers from this world class brewery. The fruity, floral character and light but not too light body seem just right for a hot Texas day. This is certainly a beer I will be looking for each and every summer."

"The beer is clear and light golden with a thick head. The aroma offers herbal and floral notes, with grass and light pine. Medium bitterness throughout. Grassy and even tart. Some biscuit malt in support. Zesty and tangy. Pretty tasty."

"Poured from 355 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted June 2014."

"Pours out a pale copper with a thin white head. Hops smell strongly of citrus and tropical fruit. A bit of guava. Tastes of bready malt sweetness and loads of fruity hops. The fruitiness goes well with the sweetness. Mouthfeel is rather full, with a lightly prickly carbonation. This is delicious."
""
""
""
""
"A really good pale ale. This is Loose Leaf's bigger brother. It is a bit sweeter, with a more pronounced piny/soapy flavor, which is not a bad thing at all. I do think I like Loose Leaf just a bit more. Though this is no less of an enjoyable beer."
""
"O: a good beer but not one of a kind -- it's got good citrus notes, and the bitter bite is there but very manageable. tastes good, and I'd have no problem drinking this all the time, but I can name 20 other American IPAs just as good or better"

"One of the best beers from Odell. I'm counting the days till the new batch comes out. It's one of the great summer time drinkers. With the heavy hop taste but a light easy drinking finish. It should be back in stores over the next couple of months. Texas is in for a great surprise this summer. Welcome to the big show!"
""
""
""
""
"Smell is still as robust as ever for an IPA."

"O: I think this is a good example of an Extra Pale Ale. It is not as big in hop bitterness as I thought that it would be but it is tasty and delicious. I would buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Decent head, and some really nice lacing. Nose is sweet and piney, with citrus and honey. Yeasty tone bittered with a crisp hop and diverse citrus, sweetened with honey, and balanced with a little fresh tea leaf. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"O - This was a great beer and in my opinion is spot on for the style while remaining unique and interesting. Not overly complex, just very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I also prefer these brews in a very frosted mug pint size which at happy hours is 3.50 per pint"

"I was looking for a go to pale ale after moving away from the coast and had exceptionally high expectations that this would be it. After my first foray with it this summer, I thought it might fill the role, but it would be a couple of months before I saw it at the shop again. With that six pack I was initially underwhelmed (disappointed is actually a more appropriate term for how I felt), and thought it was back to the drawing board, but about halfway through the magic was recovered. I don't know why it seemed so drastically different to me from the first to the second half of that six pack, but I'm now firmly back in the camp of loving it (thought honestly not as much as I had hoped). This is an excellent pale ale from a brewery I am only now learning to appreciate. Sad it took me this long to discover them, but glad I'm getting to now!!"
""
""
"it's hard to pick up on certain flavors, but it is a very well balanced pale ale. the hops used are more leaning towards floral/fruity, which work very well with the grains used for the malt. if you're into sweeter pale ales, this is for you. i usually prefer mine with a more hop forward profile, but this is pretty damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - not a bad beer at all but nothing worthwhile as well. A good sipper for a couple"
"Overall very drinkable but still holds my interest."

"Poured into a goblet, yellow-amber color, with a nice looking head that had some staying power. Aroma was extremely pilsner-like, I thought, and while I like a good pilsner here and there, I didn't buy a pilsner, and was therefore a little thrown by the zingy grass and breadiness. I should mention I don't drink a lot of pale ales, though I do like SN's (of course, who doesn't?). I guess I was expecting more hoppiness given the story about St. Lupulin tending to his hops and the hop field design on the label, and there is some, but it's not really up front. In fact, this beer is just so balanced, just so medium across the board (medium body, medium hops, medium malt) that it was hard for me to identify this beer's particular character. I mean, where's the hook? What's the angle here? Very drinkable, and you could probably drink these all day long and not get tired of them, though the 6+% abv kind of excludes it from a sessionable as well. Good, but just confused as to where they were going with this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Tonight is the first time I have had St. Lupulin from the bottle (I have had on tap multiple times prior to this and enjoyed it more) and I have to admit that I was not terribly impressed. The smell was balanced, but just ""OK", and the taste, while packing a nice hop note, was a bit of the same...middle of the road. The feel, however, is great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The medium body was good, very smooth and with a nicely dry finish. Drinkability was very good, the beer went down quickly and easily, and you could slide several down with no trouble. Overall, a pretty nice beer. Not really outstanding or memorable, but certainly enjoyable and worth a shot if you see it."
""
"The beer pours a cloudy golden yellow with a razor thin halo of white head that doesn't lace. The nose is predominantly sweet hoppy citrus. The taste is oj concentrate forward with a potent zestiness and sweetness. Thick, syrupy, medium bodied with an orange soda finish. I'd say there isn't the dry, bitter finish I'd hoped for, but the mouthfeel is expected with a cask brew. Residual citrus dominates the palate, but it's a bit too heavy. I'd like to try this in bottles next time."
"Overall this is an excellent beer. The hop aroma and smooth hoppy finish just make this such a real treat. The beer is light enough that you can session them and the hops are tame enough that the beer lets you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pleasant, clean mouthfeel and little aftertaste make it very drinkable."

"Overall, a good way to break into Odell. I though this was an IPA in the store, and despite its APA classification, this one could go either way. Looking forward to trying more offerings from Odell."
"The crispness bites while allowing some smoothness to flow nicely in a medium body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Odell has never ceased to impress me, and St Lupulin is no exception. This is currently my favorite APA and holds a candle to their phenomenal IPA, believe it or not!"
""
"Poured from tap into pint at Euclid in Denver. Nice copper color with small lacing. Sweet citrus hop aroma. Taste is a sweet citrus and candy hop with a nice dose of malt. Its a bit over malty but still nice. Solid flavorful pale ale. Just a bit heavy..."

"A very pleasant beer to knock back while my dog and I wait for the oven to heat up for our pizza supper (Rocket also likes the taste of this beer â€“ well, just about any beer I offer him...). All the same, a nice summer solstice brew to knock back, especially as Colorado smokes and burns, but year-round, too (based on numerous previous purchases of this beer)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers."
""

"Overall a fantastic summer pale ale. This is what American pales should be for warmer weather. This one has instantly moved up near the top of my choices when it comes to APAs."

"A pretty good pale ale. If you try the Odell IPA, youâ€™re almost trying the same thing. But that is not a bad thing. Good beer."
""
""
"Pours a pale golden orange color. A finger width of head dissipates quickly. Modest Lacing. Aroma is great. Nose is slightly floral with grapefruit, orange, and peach. Taste is full of hoppy fruitiness with a nice clean bitter hop finish. Just a great hoppy fruity flavor throughout. Mouthfeel is great with the perfect amount of carbonation. This beer is fantastic and I highly recommend it."
"Overall, St. Lupulin is another wonderfully crafted beer by Colorado's Odell Brewing Co. This is exactly what an APA should be. Flavorful, balanced, and refreshing. A perfect summer seasonal. This tasted great relaxing on the front porch at sunset after mowing the lawn."
"O: Solid APA from Odell. I'll be drinking more of these this summer."

"Beer is medium-bodied with carbonation of medium to medium-light intensity. The beer foams up slightly, but is still smooth overall. Closes out with a little burn from ethanol, fostering a dry finish and little residual stickiness across the palate."

"Overall I really enjoy this beer. Not simple, yet not terribly complex."
"O - A very pale ale with a hint of hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall a very nice pale ale. not a malt bomb, great balance...good hop presence, but clearly a pale ale. a damn enjoyable one at that."
""
""
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Hop taste makes it very refreshing, at least for a hops lover."
""
""
""
""
"Great beer! I will be buying again."
"Most Pale Ale's are hit or miss for me, and Odell's St. Lupin was off the mark. Maybe I am to blame for cellering it for over a year (which may explain the cloudy appearance), but I didn't like the way the floral dry hopped notes mingled with the biscuity body. In summary it has many aspects of a good beer, but things just don't come together quite right. I'll pass next time and go for a more fresh and refreshing APA more worthy of the St. Lupulin name."
"O - Not an EPA expert but this is a sessionable hoppy beer. Easy to drink and not too bitter. Recommended!"
""
"Final Thoughts: Going with an EPA as a summer seasonal was a great choice by Odell Brewing. A solid beer from a solid brewery."
""
""
"The St. Lupulin, like their ""house"" IPA is one of the better overall pale ales I've ever had the luxury of having. Having lived in Fort Collins, I was surrounded by a myriad of delicious brews, however, when I found a place that had St. Lupe, I always leaned towards it. I feel it tastes better in the bottle than on tap, unless you're at the brewery of course."
""
"Overall: This destroyed my expectations. A great pale ale with an outstanding mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this may be the best APA I've ever had. Rivaling some of the ""fresh"" hop varieties around. I really can't find much bad to say about this beer other than it really seems more like an IPA to me. If I did this taste blind I would have called it an IPA. As a beer it is truly a 5, but as a APA it falls jut short. For a non-hop head this may be too much. Summit EPA has the hops and the balance with a great malt profile. Recommended to all. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer easy to enjoy. I'll definitely revisit this one."
""
""
"Above average."
"D/O: Good overall, with some honest Cascade hop qualities, this blond/pale ale is undone only by the too-heavy texture. At times it reminds of Marin's excellent Mt. Tam pale ale, except for the mouthfeel which would be quite attractive in a DIPA. Perhaps draft service would really push this beer over the top, as it does with Mt. Tam."
"Overall, a good beer, this one. The balance of malts and hops is good, but weighing on the hoppy side for sure. The finish is really bitter, but the experience is a good one."
""
""
"O: A pretty good beer that I would consider buying for friends that are newer to beer. Very approachable, refreshing and tasty beer since, in my opinion, it's certainly not as complex as other beers. It's like Corona was imagined by Coloradans (that sounds like an insult I guess, but it's supposed to be a compliment)...I could see this being a beer you'd have with nice grilled fish, steak, or chicken."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is a solid apa. Very nice and super drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thia is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. Overall this is a pretty good brew. However, it had some pretty big shoes to fill considering how much I enjoyed Odell's IPA and red when I previously had them. This brewery really knows what they are doing with hops. While the best by date was still a month or two out, I dont feel confident that this was as fresh as it could have been. I would have this again in the future regardless of being more fresh or not."
""
"All around more than solid APA. A very nice drinker and perfect summer quaffer."
"O: Good drinker that goes down easy. Good representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Odell's make some good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A really good West Coast Pale Ale with a weak nose. Another awesome Odell brew."
""
""
"O-a great drinking pale ale with good flavor and balance"
""
""
""
""
"This is my kind of pale ale - heavily dry-hopped, so it smells great, but without the bitter hop acids. I like it a lot. Main complaint is the low carbonation. But I could drink a whole lot of this, and I don't even really like pale ales."
"Poured from bottle the day it hit the shelves, though the freshness box is not stamped on the bottle...weird. Anyhow, I know this is fresh. Poured to pint glass the beer arrives a translucent pale orange color with light honey colored highlights in the light. A decent 1 finger white head with little retention, and a bit of lacing. The nose is hop-forward with notable piney, fruity tones: grapefruit and lemon. Not an assault with the hops but more hoppy than malty, with just a hint of caramel malt base. The flavor again begins with the hops, with a more tropical fruity flavor than the nose let on, the pine and citrus are present as well. Mildly bitter for the style with a gentle caramel malt base. Fruity and sweet, though quite dry. Lighter in body with adequate carbonation. Overall, this is a seasonal release that isn't bad, though I typically buy one 6-pack each release and don't come back. Better options out there."
""
""
"Pours a light golden yellow with a thumbs width white head. Nice lacing. A sweet, floral and citric aroma. At first you smell the rind of the clementine, afterwards the actual fruit shows itself to give it some sweet juiciness. A wonderfully layered flavor profile to this, moreso than the aroma had led me to expect. Some clementine and lemon, some grass, some florals, on top a bready, even slightly biscuity, malt foundation. A crisp and silky medium body with some decent activity to it making it very drinkable. Overall, Odell does it again with another great and unique beer. Very bright and refreshing, will make for a great summer beer. I was bummed to see Red leave the shelves but after trying this it softens the blow just a touch."
"Absolutely fantastic pale ale, that is more IPA, but a bit less bitter. Great pine and fruit notes and very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden with a thin white head. The nose is a bit of tropical fruits and pine, but a little muted. Taste is a citrus explosion to start, followed by a good amount of honey flavor, then a clean, dry minty bitter finish. Mouthfeel is rich, smooth carbonation. Overall very good, I would certainly get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a somewhat unique hop profile for an APA with the pine and perfume creating an interesting flavour, I would call this an occasional sipper if the mood strikes you, worth a try"
"Worth trying, but it's not in the mainstream of the style, which is a good thing in my opinion. They call it an ""extra pale ale," which seems fitting."
""
""
"D - I would struggle to give this anything other than an average score. There is nothing particularly dislikeable about the beer, but by the same token, nothing to get excited about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. Not one to turn down. Thanks to the non-brewing friend who brought it over to a home brew tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A tasty APA with some unique characteristics making for a pleasureable experience. Easily drinkable and certainly sessionable. I could drink a 6-er of this stuff any day."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite summer seasonal beers."
"O: Considering that it's an old bottle, it is quite balanced and flavorful. Good complexity. Will look forward to tasting it again next summer."
"Damn - very nice! Highly drinkable, if I had another I'd crack it right now. Light body and sweet malt perfectly balanced with a hefty dose of aromatic/bitter hops. Too bad it's a bit pricey over here, otherwise I'd make this a regular purchase. A must try for the uninitiated."
"Like their IPA, not huge, not chest beating but firm and strong with so much character and development. Another total winner from Odell."
"an almost genre defining american pale ale. has all the complex hop characteristics you look for, but also has something all of its own. a jazzy light to medium mouthfeel despite the higer abv make this a magical back porch session. there are hop flavors in this beer that i have never tasted in another brew, it somehow gets to the essence of hops, without being major bitter. its just a real treat. bravo odell!"
"Overall, this beer is delightful and I can't wait to try it again next year."
"Odell Lupulin Pale Ale: This seasonal from Odell has a rich golden body topped with a pillowy head and a great aroma to drawn in slowly. It is very smooth, almost a luxurious feel to it, with flavor that is full but well balanced. Nice malt tone throughout with great hop flavors coming and going, but no bitter or bite. The Lupulin is an extraordinary pale ale. Congrats to the folks at Odell."
"O: Good starter beer for those who aren't quite acclimated to hop bombs. More hoppy than an EPA but not quite up to IPA standards. Easy to drink and a good compromise."
"The bartender mentioned that this was a very popular beer, and I guess I can see that. It's got enough flavor to appeal to most beer geeks, but is not so intensely flavored that it will shock any macro drinker in the mood for something with a bit more flavor. However, for me, I'd take a SNPA over this beer every time."
"Super hoppy and tasty Pale Ale, nearly IPA territory. A real treat to get a chance to try this!"
"O-A great hop forward pale ale that is easy to drink. My favorite beer from Odell."
"O: Excellent pale ale. Not for the feint of heart, a bit hoppier than most, and certainly more earthy than any other I've had. But well crafted, complex, and has a sensational mouthfeel."
"0 - This brew is way to good, its the perfect beer for summer. It's perfect for after going for a bike ride, or for sitting by the beach. I wish this wasn't a seasonal and was year round!"
"A very nice beer. I bought this in Kansas City and wish I could get more."
"The first to last swallow is crisp and refreshing as expected from an extra pale ale. The hops are mild hops but there are lots of them. A hint of sweetness, almost red aleish. Clean aftertaste. Fetching label provides an eye-taste of what's inside. Perfect for aprÃ¨s mountain bike exhaustion."
"Overall Impression- Very refreshing but not enough hop or flavor for me. This style is usually VERY hoppy and this brew would be perfect if it had more of this. Love Odell Brewing but fell short on this one for me..."
"Thanks chugalug06 for the extra in the trade!"
"Overall: A real solid Pale Ale; simply put."
"This is a nice beer, although probably not sessionable (6.5%), it drinks kind of like a session beer. This could be dangerous on a hot day."
"While certainly solid, I think that this might have a bit of age on it, as this just lacked that fresh brightness that so many other reviews seem to mention. This was still well flavored and balanced and an overall refreshing quaff though. Iâ€™m going to be seeking this one out on draft when Iâ€™m in Idaho next month, as this really showed some potential."
"Overall I think this one stands up to most American IPA's brewed in the US. This has such a bright and refreshing taste and mouth, it should be enjoyed by the sixer all summer long. Highly recommended, Summer or not."
"O - Another great beer from Odell. Great representation of the style. I could easily see myself drinking many of these on a hot summer day. Extememly satisfying when you're looking for a pale ale with lots of flavor that doesn't burn you out. Wish this was available year round."
"Not a whole lot of complexity, but what is there is delicioius. A really great beer. Mouthfeel is maybe a bit on the carbonated side, but not too bad. The alcohol is masked nicely in the flavor. Odell's offering is spot on. A great APA."
"Like a good little APA, this approaches, but does not dare to meet the IPA boundaries - easy to drink, enjoyable, and a welcome respite for various parts of my palate."
"I've had this beer several times, and I really like it a lot. It pours an average-sized head, which dissipates rather quickly and laces the glass a little bit. Sweetened citrus is what I smell most in the aroma. Every beer I really like balances its hops and malt and has a flavor that makes it stand out in a pleasant and hard-to-describe way. This is one of those beers. It's sweeter than most of my favorite beers. The hops are both sharp and soft at the same time. The aftertaste is strong, but clean."
"O - Solid beer, easy to drink, not my favorite of the style, but it's refreshing and can go well with a lot of things. I'd drink it again if it was offered."
"Tasted a week after I'd undergone sinus surgery, so my sense of smell was a little wonky. I'd been through a string of aggressively hoppy beers (Lagunitas lucky 13, Two Bro. Hop Juice, Hop Ottin') and this was a nice break. Hoppy, but not too hoppy. Cheers!"
"overall: good, but not a trend-setter for the style"
"We sampled this one at the Odell Taproom with some friends, a few Saturdays ago. Poured a bright golden color, with a decent cap of bubbly white foam. Great floral/fruity hop aromas, somewhat grassy, bubblegum. On the palaet, this one was light bodied, with flavors of fruity hops, pears and malt."
"Final Notes: This is a great beer, and easily one of the best summer seasonals I've had. Bordering on IPA territory but retains the refreshment and lighter character of the APA style. Good utility beer."
"Overall - a fantastic summer beer. I continue to be impressed with O'Dell. They are definitely one of my favorite breweries."
"O - Awesome seasonal ale from Odell. Great job once again Odell... I could drink this one all summer long!"
"Lots of feel and body to this one. It's slick off the bat and turns slightly chalky through the finish. The carbonation is mild but certainly ample. Odell does it again."
"O: If there was an extra pale ale category, this is the winer in my opinion. A great summer brew because it is light but still carries some hop presence."
"O- one of, if not the, best summer seasonal brew I've had. So tasty, crisp, and different from most of the IPA's out there. It isn't overdone with grapefruit. Very good beer, especially for the style. I will buy this."
"Medium bodied and fuller than expected with a crisp floral hop bite up front that lingers over the sweeter, earthy notes into a dry finish. Earthy pine, grass and straw countered by some grapefruit and lemon peel."
"D - A pretty inoffensive pale ale from O'Dell. I'd have it again in a pinch, but it's nothing terribly exciting."
"Pours a semi-clear orange-yellow color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Distinct rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and citrus zest with a noticeable soapy aroma. Taste is of malt and citrus zest and floral hops again with a slightly soapy flavor like the smell. This beer has good carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I wouldn't get it again. I am glad I got to try this one though as Odell isn't distributed to CA."
"o: an above average beer.. just expected a bit more from this one."
"O- Very impressed. I could easily see this becoming one of my regulars in the fridge."
"(12oz bottle from Total Wine Desert Ridge). Pours clear golden color with off-white head. Light carbonation. Aroma has grapefruit, lemon, resin and some dank aromas. Taste has some bitterness, but is mostly malty like Fat Tire. Medium bodied with chunky texture. Bitter finish. Not a fan of this att all. Not sure why this beer is so highly rated on this site; its like a hoppy version of fat tire."
"D: Very good. Worth a second or third try."
"Overall, this is an insanely refreshing brew with some superb hop aromatics. A very solid brew."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty good beer of the style. It had some very nice hoppy notes to it, but the malt came through with some nice balancing flavors. Very easy drinking and flavorful beer of the style."
"D - Well balanced and very easy drinking. Nice summer beer."
"O: A pleasant drinker that I would recommend."
"Dr: A wonderful summer ale. It obscures its ABV very well. Quite delightful, but don't make the mistake of buying it in Ireland when you're from the state it's brewed in. Oops."
"o-I think this is a great seasonal beer. Just got done doing yard work in 85 degree weather, and this is just what the doctor ordered. I would say this beer is a good example of an American Pale. Good for a session beer."
" I was really expecting a bright sunny hop profile just short of Odell IPA, a bit taken a back. This comes off a more balanced and earthy dry hopped English pale ale with the balance of malt and hops slightly shifted towards the hops. Resinous hop oil feel was as good as advertised."
"Drinkability: Another quality hoppy beer from Odell; much better than the typical APA"
"D: Very high. Pass me another."
"Would definitely get this on a regular basis if I could."
"Overall - A excellent, straightforward, hoppy and very drinkable APA... recommended..."
"Very crisp and extremely light in the mouth. Easy to go through a bottle without really realizing it."
"Light to medium body with bright flavors. The carbonation level adds to make it a really refreshing drink as it is a summer seasonal."
"In the end, due to this being a seasonal beer from May to September/October, it really fits in with the early summer feeling. It's one to mow the lawn with, so you can further pull out the plant smells and tastes that are hiding under all the hops. I would love to sip this while walking through fresh cut grass, that crisp, tangy smell permeating the last of the early afternoon humidity."
"cannot stress this enough one of the best beers i have had in a long time. top notch."
"Drinkability - unique ""feeling"" to the bitterness that I like. Fairly easy to drink and complex enough to make it worth thinking about while you drink it."
"This is a really nice beer, you will need to like a dominant hop focus though. Light and quaffable with a robust hop character that keeps this hop head coming back for more."
"Toasted malt up front. Dry, hoppy bitterness follows with flavors of lemon, orange rind, and light pine. Very mildly sweet biscuit and fruit malt notes settle in. Citrus and pine hoppiness steals the show though. The dry, zesty hop btterness almost takes on a floral, herbalness. Light tropical fruit shows up in the lingering, mostly bitter finish. Moderate body with a lightly creamy feel, due partly to mild carbonation. A nice, very dry and refreshing APA that really shows off the citrus hops, but in a not overly bitter and heavy-handed way."
"Beer poured a golden orange with a nice two fingered head that is leaving a beautiful rings behind. Nose is light floral hops. Taste is a nicely balanced between a solid malt backbone finishing with a decent citrus hop. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and very satisfying. Drinkability is good, definitely not a session beer but several can be enjoyed at one sitting. This is a good solid beer with some nice heft that is very enjoyable. Another fine effort from my favorite Colorado brewer!"
"Overall pretty drinkable and refreshing."
"A solid, playfully light and sweetened showcase of a style I usually avoid. A solid drinker of a Pale. This was a pleasant surprise."
"Cheers!"
"Nice carbonation, crisp, clean, light to medium bodied. A nice drinkable beer which I would gladly buy and drink again."
"Great to see Odell now being sold in MN."
"A new brewer for me to try thanks to the Muddy Pig in St. Paul MN . At 6.5% and 46 ibu's this dry hopped extra pale ale looks a bit hazy and golden amber colored with a fair head with a fantastic sheet of lace. The aroma says pine and sweet floral hops, with that likable skunk to it, very alluring and somewhat unique. The taste buds grab onto this enjoyable pissy hop that so nicely combines citrus, floral edges and a hint of pine. The body is on the light side, the feel is lightly peppery and crisp, very refreshing while delivery plenty of bright hop satisfaction. It has a bit of biscuit clove that becomes obvious as you go. I liked this and would consider this a definite candidate for hop session beer of the month. A happy introduction to Odell from Fort Collins, CO."
"This beer pours a hazy orange-red color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma screams centennial hops. There is a ton of citrus, with some grapefruit, and pine resin. The malt is kept way in the background. This area reminds me a lot of Bell's Two Hearted Ale. The taste is of a lot more balanced than the aroma. There is still a very nice hops presence, but it is moderated by some nice pale malts. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is one of the better APAs I've had in a long time. I will certainly drink this beer again in the future."
"Drinkability is the key for this style. St. Lupulin isn't a bad one, but it's a little too mild for me."
"Extra-drinkable, this hop-forward EPA. I might choose this over a Summit EPA, but wouldn't pick one over an IPA. That's me, though. Very nice EPA, suitable for many occasions."
"Nice pale with a solid hop kick but little else."
"D: This might be my perfect summer beer. Loads of hops in a refreshing dry finish. This beer is a session beer for those who love big hop aromas and flavors."
"overall: a very nice APA that had a fresh, crisp hop smell and bite with a dry, yet refreshing finish. a nice summer seasonal"
"M & D - Nice crisp and light bodied refreshing beer with very nice hop and malt profile. This would be a good intro to craft beer newbies juts like SNPA is used for this many times."
"Light body and lack of chew keeps this from being an IPA. Top 10 APA, for sure."
"It's a decent, enjoyable beer, but given the price of it here as an import, I doubt I'll buy it again."
"Poured a golden orange with yellow highlights that had a thin head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass. The nose was kinda soapy with really faint hops and had more of a hop character. There was also slight wheat and citrus notes. Up front malts dominate the taste very little hop bitterness and very little citurs wheat flavors. The beer was light to medium body with moderate carbonation that had slight hop bitterness but was crisp on the finish. I think the brew was a little old cause it was more maltier than it was hoppy but then again it was only a pale ale. It atill drank quite welll and was expecting more of a hop bite."
"12 ounce bottle. Great to see St. Lupulin back on the shelves! Odell always has terrific bottle art, but I think this one is exceptional, with the glass of beer formed by the negative space in the picture. Pours a nice light gold amber with a ful inch head the consistency of quality dish soap. Incredibly resinous nose with plenty of hop aroma. Pine, grass, and some grapefruit abounds. Hops are present throughout the beer. There's pine and grass up front with some surprising bitterness in the middle of the sip before finishing with citrus fruit. There's no real complexity here, though there's a nice balance between malt and hops. Thisis is a beer that's very straightforward on the palate, and that's not necessarily a bad thing."
"D- 6.5% wow, this is a pretty big APA, I'm impressed, this beer is smooth, clean, nice bitterness, good lasting finish."
"Overall, a really nice epa. Started out weird with the aroma, but got past that with the taste and it was decent. Nice drinkability."
"Throughout, went down smooth, didn't fade, just wowed me consistently, and I have never been the biggest O'Dell's fan. Porter, sure, Extra Red, decent. IPA? Not a fan. But this? This is golden, this is the archtype, the model, the gold medal."
"Medium bodied and well, just right. Not watery. Not heavy and slow drinking. Just right."
"Slainte."
"D: incredible; It is complex yet refreshing with a delicious hoppy flavor that really lives up the ""extra pale ale"" moniker given to it. This is a damn fine beer and one that I will continue to enjoy throughout the summer."
"Crisp, hoppy bite on the front of the tongue with earthy pine and resin. Malts are restrained, but bring enough balance to even out all the hoppiness. Body is bubbly and light on the palate, and finishes clean and hoppy. Odell knows how to brew solid, drinkable beers, and St. Lupulin is no exception. Recommended!"
"Drinks: Like a day spent watching the clouds. Like those puffy wanderers, St. Lupulin becomes complex upon deeper contemplation. With flavors evoking images of flowers and sunshine, it's a fantastic beer for summer and another great one from Odell."
"D: this is a great APA, nice fresh hop profile, nice balance with the malts, drinks like it is way lighter than 6.5%. Great beer!"
"Drinkability: Though it is too high of ABV to consider it a ""session beer", it does not reveal any flavors of alcohol and gives it great drinkability."
"This beer has to be about 1 IBU away from being an IPA."
"Very drinkable beer, terrific APA, lots of great hop flavors."
"Overall a good beer."
"This tastes more light a hoppy pilsne at times than a pale al. Pretty easy to drink and session."
"Light, pale, golden color. Nice aroma from the hops and even the malt. First sip is nicely balanced and then the bitterness from the hops comes through. Just enough bitterness to make this unique, but not so much to make the profile lopsided. Light body and mouthfeel. I prefer a slightly heavier mouthfeel, but its clearly labeled as an extra pale ale, so what can I expect! Finishes nice and pretty dry, I could drink this all day long! Very enjoyable..."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"M/D: Light to medium body. It does have a very interesting mouthfeel, its very slick almost oily? Its like there is no sign of carbonation when it first hits the palate, but then you can feel it right after that. This is good for a hot summer day, but I think I would get tired after 1 or 2."
"Drinkability: Lots of hop oils for an APA, making this a fairly unique beer for the style. However, despite the hop oils, it does not stray into IPA territory. Very drinkable with lots of flavor. Pretty impressive overall."
"Pours a clear, golden, yellow color with a large white head that had very good retention. Quite a bit of lacing is left on the glass. A bit worried about the lack of depth in color. Aroma is all hops. Citrus, piney and resiny, very strong hop aroma for a APA. The flavor is one dimensional and not balanced. Almost all hops. My fear of the pale color has been realized. I need more malt besides the slightest wisp of sweetness in the finish. The featured hops do taste good but more balance is needed. Nice carbonation for a hoppy beer, but the body is a little on the thin side. A little too bitter and high ABV for this to be a prolonged summer drinker."
"Odell's summer seasonal is a balanced pale ale. Some pretty good hop flavor, not too bitter or too sweet. Reminds me of their IPA. Not too bad."
"Cask at Papago. Aroma was that of grassy type hops. Some malt background but faint. Carbonation was low but appropriate for a cask conditioned beer. Flavor was rich two row malt with plenty of wonderful hop flavor. Odells did a great job dry hopping the beer. Again, very grassy flavor, not to much citrus. One of the best cask beers I've had in a long time."
"Pale and slightly hazed lemon yellow body. Fluffy white head. Lace is quite full. The aroma brings it all. It's piney, resiny, cannabis like, citrusy. Really nice. The flavor bursts with hop goodness. Lemon and citrus, pine sap and resin.... Base is a nice biscuity maltiness. Medium-full body. Modestly carbonated. And highly drinkable. After IPA, this is my second favorite Odell beer so far."
"A decent brew, but I'm not a fan of the color and flavor seemed to lack a bit. What was great in aroma was not as noticeable in taste. Still a good beer, but I had higher hopes."
"D: This is a very sessionable APA, even at 6.5%. Simply delicious. It's definitely one I'll be enjoying throughout the Summer months."
"D= Excellent brew. Really well balanced. A nice APA that has good balance. The Summit EPA is a little too heavy on the hop side and the hops they use don't fit as well. This beer is delicious."
"Drinks very well, although this would be tough to session. Two or three wouldn't be out of the question though. A very nice hopped up APA."
"Tasting notes: Smells piney, slight citrus, lots of grapefruit and marijuana. Foamy with a wet - hoppy feel. Pine and citrus. Mouthfeel was ""chewy."" Very citrusy. Hidden but noticeable alcohol bite."
"Damn good beer, another hit from Odell's!"
"D: Nice and quaffable, but not one of my favorites from our visit that day."
"Drinkability is very good. Great beer overall."
"this is odells summer seasonal ..an extra pale ale..it pours a clear dark yellow with a small white head an some nice lacing on glass..the smell is citrus hops and malt bready smells with caramel and floral smell ...the taste is the same as the smell its very floral and crisp with pine/citrus upfront with plenty of malt in the finish to balance things out..the mouth feel is medium and solid it fills the beer taste buds with plenty of hops and malts..this is a good extra pale ale but if im buying odells i will go for their IPA first b4 this on"
"D - Quite drinkable, a perfect summer drink. 4.0"
"12 oz. bottle, dry-hopped, best by 10/3/09; sampled 8/7/09. The beer is a fairly clear golden amber, with medium carbonation and a thin cap that leaves moderate lacing. Smells of citric, floral and leafy Cascade hops and not much else. Citric hops and some fruity alcohol show up on the palate first, but the malts follow with a light sweetness and some toastiness. Creamy and mouth-filling, with a dry, crisp finish. This is a tasty and refreshing pale ale, but it has too much alcohol to be a sessionable summer ale."
"overall i am impressed with this...my first bottle from the latest trade with ottovon proves a hit i can only imagine what the rest will be like"
"Amber brew, one finger white head with nice lacing. Sweetish malts dominate the nose, with a good citrusy hop presence on the tastebuds. Very smooth and dangerously drinkable. Very similar to Odell IPA, except this is a bit more sweet and a little less hops on the tastebuds. Don't be fooled by the (Extra) Pale Ale designation, this has plenty of hops to satisfy the hopheads among us. Definitely worth a try."
"D: Very light and easy to drink. Could have plenty of these in a sitting"
"Hazy and golden with a moderate amount of carbonation. Fluffy, bubbly head and medium amount of ensuing lace. I get some grain from the aroma, but nothing more. Somewhat muted. Wonderful balance between the malt and hops. Slight sweetness that fades to subdued bitterness in the middle and finish. A hint of citrus in the upper palate. Medium bodied and very drinkable."
"sixer from the Liquor Depot, Rock Springs, WY...best by 10/03/09"
"D- Highly drinkable with just enough hop flavor to keep me happy."
"Poured from a bottle into a heavy pint glass. The color resembles a wheat beer and has an orange tint. Nice citrus on the nose. Not as hoppy as I expected, but nicely balanced with some sweet malt. Very creamy and easy to drink. I usually enjoy an IPA or two, and this was a nice change but still had the hopiness that I prefer."
"Final thoughts: A nice bitter pale ale that has a great hop taste, very clean and refreshing, slightly juicy, nice malt backbone that could have some off or old flavors but its hard to tell. I would love to get this fresh and review it again. Thanks again Chase!"
"VERY GOOD, easy drinking EPA."
"Taste starts too light on the lips - watery and bouncy on the front, the beer begins to open up right on the middle of the tongue with a biting, noble hop profile. The beer 'catches', and the body seems to grow from nowhere.. From there the journey gets more exciting - a strong blend of orange blast & melons awaken my senses... all of these bright hoppy flavors are buoyed by a sweetish, lingering maltiness. Sufficient carbonation keeps things crisp, sharp as well, which is a nice treat... I'm surprised the alcohol stands at 6.5% abv, in my mind that detracts from the drinkability. Otherwise this beer is fantastic. Odell has brewed one of the more enjoyable APA's I've tried in a few years."
"Very drinkable. But for how long is anyone's guess since they don't date bottles."
"Overall, a very well done and easy drinking APA."
"D - this is a pretty good beer. Very lemony and citrusy - I can see why it is a summer seasonal. I don't know if I would purchase this again based on its price, but I was satisfied by it nonetheless."
"This is one of the better APAs I've had recently. The balance between malt and hops, bitter and smooth, is nearly perfect and makes for superb drinkability. This is a great seasonal from Odell, and I'm glad I have five more to enjoy."
"I am grateful to have been able to drink this beer while in colorado this summer. it was great while reading ancient chinese poetry after fishing trips. I just finished my last bottle that I had brought back to chicago. It is a very solid, tasty, fresh, refreshing, hoppy APA. One of my favorites of the style."
"Got a nice hop bite at the start but then the maltiness kicked in. Nice interesting mix of flavors going on in this beer. It went well with the food we were having. Very easy to drink and several others at the table ordered one after sampling mine."
"Pretty impressed by this pale ale from Odell. The aroma is outstanding, and the flavor packs in a lot while managing to feel light, making it uber-drinkable."
"a pretty apa overall, very earthy and bread like so a few would be my limit but pretty easy to drink in small amounts. decent overall."
"Pours a dried wheat color with a nice beige head. Nose has bready malts, floral hops and citrus. Taste has crisp malts well balanced by fruity hops. Medium body has a light carbonation. Very refreshing body with a nice bitter finish. Good session beer from Odell."
"Light/medium bodied, very easy to drink. The label calls it ""extra pale ale", evidently the extra is alcohol and hops, which to me nudges this up to an India pale ale, put still a nice all purpose brew."
"Pours a clear, golden color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong hops, earthy malt, and hop oil. Very strong and good aroma. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes of floral hop oil and slight earthy malt. Overall, a great appearance, aroma, and body - though it does lack in complexity."
"Conclusion: Had no idea what to expect with this one, liked the label and typically really like O'Dell's stuff, so I figured I'd give it a try, and I was pleasantly surprised!"
"overall -nothing to write home about, but a solid go-to for the summer time, a bit on the pricey side though."
"Definitely enjoyable and something I'll have again. What's really nice is that it can be everything from a hop fix to a lawnmower brew."
"M/D: light and sligtly dry with good amount of carbonation. The drinkability is good do to it's good taste. Good brew for the summer months."
"Drinks very well. Crisp, clean, refreshing, with good taste and leaving a desire for more. Top notch."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some malt notes, and some citrus. The taste is hoppy, bitter, slightly sweet/malty, with some citrus. Medium body. Drinkable, another very tasty brew from Odell."
"12oz bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear gold with a finger of gold head. Nice citrus hop aroma with a hint of ginger?! Starts out with some piney, green hop flavor. Seems very fresh and alive. Light bodied. Not overly bitter, but there is a lot of hop flavor that really lingers. Good example of why I like seasonal beers. The freshness of this beer is evident which is good for this style."
"This is a good beer to seek out and I would recommend trying it once."
"D: Very easy to drink. Good sessionable APA; flavorful, balanced."
"D - very easy drinking. I can tell already that the 6pack I just bought this afternoon won't be around tomorrow! Really good and I'll have to get more! Excellent for a hot day! YUM!"
"Blipped ""New Patron Saints and Angels"" by A.F.I."
"I could enjoy this beer for the remainder of the summer - it's nearly on par with the new Boulevard IPA. But remind me what makes this an EPA?"
"12 ounce bottle, purchased at Gomer's in Kansas City. 101709 is stamped on the label, not sure what it tells us....anyway this tasty offering pours slightly hazed yellowy amber, decent retention on the off white head and respectable froth and strandlet of lace left on the glass. herbal and citric nose...grapefruit infused ale, fruity,fairly tart and bitingly bitter, especially in the finish. Hop heads rejoice and go and get some of this tasty nectar"
"Drinkability:"
"This beer was poured out into a pint glass. The wheat colored brownish beer created a fair amount of foam. Yet reduced to low amounts of lacing. Giving off the evidence of not having tons of hops. The aroma of the beer is great, sweater amounts of malts with a great balance of hops. The taste of the beer is an equal amounts of hops and malts with a fair flavoring coriander."
"This is a great anytime beer; they are advertising it as a seasonal and that's too bad. This is a damn good brew!"
"D: Wow, one of the easiest hoppy beers I've had to drink. Not overly bitter, and extremely crisp and refreshing. Great summer seasonal, and really a nice beer. Makes me wonder if an XPA should be a classification, not quite a pale ale, but not quite an IPA."
"Trough the roof sessionability, I sure hope this stays in the rotation. One of the better APAs (not including AIPAS calling themselves APAs) out there IMHO"
"Drinkability: I love this beer. If Odell chose to make this a year-round offering, they could ship a few cases out to Kansas every month to a very happy home and palate."
"Odell's knows how to make an enjoyable beer, and this is one of my new favorites. Crisp and refreshing, borderline IPA, but not too overwhelming on the ABV to be hard to put down a few."
"D: This is a nice beer. The wateriness in the middle was the only thing getting in the way of my enjoyment. Definitely worth a revisit."
"D: From the title of the beer, thought it was going to be a tad more hoppy. But, a good beer nonetheless. Nothing that really smacks me over the head and amazes me, but drinkable and would have another. Odells makes great beer."
"Bottle. Pours a clear light orange with a thick white head. Aroma is very hoppy with lots of grassy and citrus hops. Flavor is slightly more mellow with tropical fruits and citrus hops. Pretty hoppy for an APA (it tastes more like an IPA to me), very delicious!"
"D - This is a really good APA. I took a sixer of it to a barbeque and found it to be very easy drinking and enjoyable."
"D: This is a great APA. Definitely a must try. The beer is suprisingly light for the amount of flavor it packs. I wish it wasn't so damn expensive. I'll pay it though."
"Carbonated a bit to much but not to distract. Drinks incredibly easy for a good summer seasonal. Another great beer from ODell."
"Drinkability? Just another hoppy bitter APA that I don't think I'll visit that often. I ask the singular most important question comparing this to the draft version...where's the Malt?"
"[NA; 2-6x]"
"A quality seasonal from the folks at Odell. I'm always a sucker for a citrusy IPA."
"What a fantastic year for Colorado beer. Keep 'em coming boys."
"D=extremely enjoyable and definitely sessionable."
"d: fairly easy to drink, but the flavors didn't come together well enough for me"
"D: Extremely drinkable especially at 6.5%. A wonderful new release from Odell's, my new favorite summer brew. Well done!"
"D-Absolutely Delightful. A great summer beer. Good for those not looking for bitter but still want refreshing. Will be picking up at least another 2 six packs. Cost is not terribly low though at 10.99 yet well worth it in my opinion. Especially compared to other 6 packs in that price range around here."
"First off it is my opinion that this beer is a little too expensive at $10 a sixer but that is the nature of beer prices these days. Very nice transparent orange color, kind of looks like the IPA but doesn't have the same level of lacing to it. The smell is quite nice and hoppy for a pale ale, like straight hop oil. The taste is good, slightly bitter finish, a little citrus, lemon specifically. This is a very nice extra pale ale and I would be buying it on the regular if it were more competitively priced. Sadly this will be like the Red Ale for me, once in a blue moon."
"This is an incredible summer session beer, if you can get this - get it!"
"A familiar sweet smell of Odell's hop profile. A bit of maltiness in there. Amber in color with a slight white head. The bitterness of the hops is combined with the sweetness of the hops and malt and creates a good balance. Not the bite of their IPA which I love and which makes this a bit more drinkable. Once again Odell's has produced an incredibly balanced and quality beer. I am lucky that I live in FTC."
"D - Very good drinkability. Has a very nice hop profile, and it is quite refreshing. Solid new seasonal offering from Odell, they have yet to let me down."
"Overall it's another great beer from Odell and an outstanding summer seasonal."
