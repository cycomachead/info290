"Dull, plain, and virtually tasteless. Not worth my time to write a full review."
"Very nice beer- the heart of Chicago, refreshing and a no bitter aftertaste"
"Nice slightly hazy golden color with a finger of foam that dissipates into very strong lacing on the glass. Smells of tropical fruits, citrus, and pine. Taste is strong with pine and biscuity malts. Very strong up front, especially for such a low ABV, but finishes relatively clean and crisp. Mouth feel is  medium to high carbonation. Overall a lot more than I expected judging from its 76 BA score. Well worth picking up. Enjoyable."
"Gobbledygook: ""We are from the city that invented the skyscraper. We constructed our Urban Pale Ale on a balanced malt backbone, so the citrus hop aroma and crisp flavor can stand tall."""

"O:  really better than I was expectingl.  A good session beer."

"12 oz bottle poured into an English pint.  Well balanced.  Bottled on 20 Feb 14, but still fresh taste."
"3/8/15 (Bottle) - Crisp golden pour with nice white foam head and a good flow of carbonation. Aroma of malt and citrus. Crisp taste, nice texture and feel going down."

"Tasty. The taste is different than the smell. Tastes citrusy and refreshing. 4.0"

"I usually don't like IPAs since they are too hoppy so I actually liked this one since it wasn't as strong as other IPAs I've tasted."

"O- Middle of the road.  Seems to be an attempt at ""Gateway Beer"".  Beer for the BMC crowd to get them to the better stuff......."

"The bottle pops with an assertive burst, but no gushing beer. Pours in to an IPA tulip with 2 fingers of loose white foam that crackles and fizzes away without wasting any time.  A little picturesque lacing and patches of foam around the edges are all that remain. The golden-orange appearance of the beer shows a tremendous degree of clarity, displaying scores of tiny bubbles that ascend with a sense of urgency. A mild aroma of caramel malts, biscuits and sweet fruity esters paves the way for a touch of sour citrus scent. Tastes of toasted grain, a bit of sugar, and some slightly dry, fruity hops compose the flavor profile. There's a nice biscuit-like backbone and an oddly-interesting lemon candy aftertaste that sticks to your palate. The slick mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium, with tame carbonation. A bit surprising given the audible pop that announced the open bottle. Overall, this doesn't quite come together in a cohesive way. It has a decently complex flavor profile but the lack of body and unbalanced attributes holds this one back.  Worthy of a sample and not a bad effort by any means, but give me the Sierra Nevada that's right next to it in the beer cooler if we're looking for a pale ale."
"Chi city, great beer, awesome."
"The aftertaste is more hoppy than I would like."

"Pale, clear, golden..small white head.  This is a drinkable, but pedestrian pale ale.  Balanced, pale malt and American hops.  Medium in body and moderately bitter finish, this is a good brew, but not exceptional."

"hundreds and hundreds of unique beers are listed for goose island, so of course all of them cant be back yard rye bourbon county or madame rose right? well, this one feels a bit corporate, like a reach to the perimeters of craft beer, rather than a beer for those at the center. i appreciate bringing new people on board, but they already have beer for that. this is a dumbed down american pale, pretty tasty actually in its hop profile, and very fresh, but there just isnt enough of it. its like the flavor is great but the part that makes it great is reduced or suppressed or just a flash rather than a presence. grassy and floral and summery are the hops, very mild bitterness, and an irrelevant grain base thats clean and simple without much structure. i know the purpose of this beer, and i can appreciate that, but i know they are capable of making better beer, so i have mixed feelings about this one. totally pleasant and definitely a league better than other beers that will share its contexts."

"Overall - Eh. It's okay. It's not going to blow anyone's socks off, and I don't think that's the intent. It's a fair flavored, easy drinking beer. Decent barbeque option, though personally I'd pass for something better. Not much else to say."

"O: Certainly not Goose Island's best effort. An uneven beer with a badly thought out flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Um, was this beer filtered through barbed wire? Because it definitely has some metallic stuff going on. Along with that is not the most savory of hop flavors, and I guess some malt just for the hell of it. As it warmed up (or maybes Raul's dome did, cuz this was his third beer) it mellowed a bit, but no amount of bubble kush could chill this bad boy out."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is bitter lemon, fruit peels, grass, hint of bitterness with light grain, bread crust sweetness balancing bitter well but with bitterness just dominating and leaving it a bit dryish.  Hint of metal."

"Had it with Mexican tonight the taste didn't hang in your mouth after took a drink like some ales so it didn't interfere with the taste of the food"

"Pours a medium copper color, a nice head of buttery foam.  Has a somewhat fruity aroma.  Taste is very pleasant, balanced with a citrus note that is not overwhelming.  A very drinkable beer."

"I'm highly suspicious about watered-down, pseudo-craft beer vibe in this product. I'm boycotting Goose Island from now on."

"Notes: I like this Pale Ale for it light hop balance and harmony of flavors. I donâ€™t expect Pale Ales to be IPA want to be hop bombs. I could drink quite a few of these."

"312 Urban Pale Ale pours a golden color, with a small lacing head. There isn't too much of an aroma. The taste is sweeter, some floral notes, but no bitterness, a fruity aftertaste. Flat feel, and weaker flavors. Overall its a very weak beer, but no offensive flavors."

"Taste starts out with the caramel malt, very slick tasting right away that almost has an oily feeling but that doesn't last, mild bitterness in the finish but nothing that really speaks to citrus or pine, carbonation is in the medium range and helps lend a decent body."

""
""
""
""
"Smells nice, pleasant hop aroma. Then things go downhill from there. Taste of onion and garlic with a bad lingering aftertaste. This is my second attempt with this beer. I want it to be good but it's not. Disappointed. I have to add more words here because beer advocate requires it. Blah blah blah. It sucked."

"Overall, we were happy to see an addition to the 312 series here. They take it, obviously, away from the pale wheatiness of the original, giving more hops and pale ambers and toast for an IPA or pale ale lover to bite into. The malts, however, seem rushed, allowing for much more infiltration of the hops, and of curious inherent tropical fruitiness to take hold, erasing the strict balance from the grain bill. We are certainly being strict in our dissection, but figured that the lack of balance was the most notable detriment to this guy. The flavor tends to just peter out, without much to bolster or keep your interest. We hope this is not representative of what is to come from the new Goose Island."
""
""
""
"Not very good at all."
""
""
"Gotta admit I like this one. It's a well balanced pale ale with all the attributes of a good balanced pale ale. Malt and hops are blended well with some biscuit, bread, and caramel malt mixed nicely with some crisp, bitter hops. I find this beer refreshing and tasty, even more refreshing in that it's not caving to the new-fangled trend of ridiculously over-hopping everything and then rating it really high because it's chock full of ridiculously inappropriate levels of hops. Good job Goose Island on making a pale ale that's a friggin' pale ale and not an IPA."

"I am really digging that my beer was born on my 49th birthday and so I am going with an aggro pour to celebrate. I netted two fingers of rocky, tawny head with persistent retention as the result. Beautiful lacing began to appear as it fell, so I leaned in for a sniff. The pine and grapefruit-citrus nose was as prevalent as any AIPA and my mouth was watering in anticipation. Color was a gorgeous deep-gold (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity. It should come as no surprise that the Unholy Trio of Midas, Mammon and Croesus suddenly appeared to beg for a sip, but I was having none of it. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and the hops were much more prevalent than the label had led me to expect. APA?!? If they say so, but this was really drinking like an AIPA, which was okay by me, actually. Maybe it speaks to how we urban dwellers roll. We need more hops than they can handle in those little soft cities. Finish was dry and I suppose that it could have been as dry and puckering as alum, were it not for their purported malt backbone. All I ask is that they consider putting this beer in a CAN."
""
""
""
"An inoffensive beer and might find friends among those who think Bud Light is a quality beer.. Everyone else, however, will be disappointed in this one. It's light and refreshing but lacks character. Could easily be a sessionable beer, but there are plenty available that offer more flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, gold color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of citrus hops, floral hops, hint of alcohol, sweet malt, slight yeast, hint of earthy malt, and a hint of pine. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, slight pine, hint of floral, hint of alcohol, sweet malt, slight earthy malt, and a hint of yeast. Overall, decent appearance, average body, aroma, and feel. Average beer at best, nothing special."

"The pale malts are noticeable at first but there is a more abrupt citrus hop character with the flavors of cantaloupe and pineapple. Ends smooth. Easy drinking."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a bland interpretation of the style, it's drinkable. I didn't appreciate the soap touch, which I think, after having a second, is from a general blandness more than a defect, maybe. Anyway, it is drinkable. It does have some balance to it. It starts off sweet-ish, lands bitter-ish, but doesn't really come together. Okay, I've gone back and forth on the overall long enough to say it hits 3.5 overall. But, I'm really trying to be supportive and this beer is making me work at it. I'll give it the ""benefit of the doubt""."
""
""
"O-A boring, not good beer. Expected more from GI, this beer is a definite pass."
"Golden color with good clarity. Weak head with no retention and minimal lacing. Clean aims, just mild bread gains and citric hop. Flavor follows the nose. Nothing special. Finishes with a somewhat harsh, soil like edge. Light bodied, highly carbonated and somewhat crisp. Overall, mediocre."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a clear, golden amber color with a slight head. The aroma is slightly bitter but nothing too wild. The taste is smooth, light, and just the right amount of bitterness. Pretty good tasting that is well-balanced and leaves a lingering bitter aftertaste. Not the best pale ale in the world, but it sure is easy drinking."
""
""
""
"Overall: A subdued but decent light brew. Kind of more like a English Bitter than APA."
""
"I know the regular GI IPA is better than this and I'll bet they have one or two other good ones, but these 312's don't give them any cred at all. It figures that AB would buy them."
"Mouthfeel: This is a light bodied beer that has good flavor but can be a great session beer I think."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An OK pale ale, but nothing I would need to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall boring, but a great session beer to watch playoff hockey at a bar. I had 4 of them and felt fine as the ABV was low and well hidden. It is what it is and could be a good starter craft beer for the masses."
""
""
"Overall: Overall, I think this beer is underrated. This is a solid, true-to-style APA that is meant to be a simple, flavorful ale without blowing your tastebuds out in one way or another. Comparable to SNPA in aroma and flavor, but the thin mouthfeel detracts too much to really make the beers absolutely comparable to each other. I would recommend this beer for cookouts and parties if you can't get a hold of SNPA and you want a relatively inexpensive, easy-drinking pale ale."

"The copper ale is a tried and true American-style pale ale that's not afraid to tilt slightly in the favor of hops rather than malt. But that's what Americans do to craft beer. And that's what makes this ale uniquely of the Midwest but commonly of domestic pale ale."

"Upon moving to Chicago this was one of the first beers I was recommended to try. Everyone I talked to seemed to love it. My initial reaction was that it didnt have much taste. It has a very earthy taste to it, that of wheat and hops. It did go down very smoothly but overall I thought it was just okay."
"Overall: Not real complex, although I thought the aroma was going to be a good start. Pretty boring otherwise."

"overall: interesting aroma and flavor profile. A nice complement to Honker's Ale."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 2/25/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep golden color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, grapefruit, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, biscuit, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bright citrus hops and pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, biscuit, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, floral, grass, biscuit, wheat, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish. Nice balance and complexity of citrus hops and pale malt sweetness; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale ale style. Good balance and complexity of citrus hops and pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"overall a pale ale brewed with midwest sensibilities. easy drinking with sessionable aspects. some will find this boring and underwhelming, others will appreciate the approachability. some pub grub and a pint of this to wash it down is a match made in heaven. a definite crossover pale ale."
""
""
"Picked up this one as part of a mixed six to try as I have really liked some of the Goose Island stuff so here we go. Pretty good looking beer, but a little pretty for my taste. Nice smell, but not real strong. Not bad, not just a plain pale ale with good, not great flavor. Decent beer but nothing that I will be going out of my way to get again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Meh. I will not try this again unless I'm handed one on a golf course."
"Bottle picked up locally and enjoyed from a goose island tulip, bottled late february. Poured a transparent orange with a generous frothy head that left nice lacing on the glass. Nose is an earthy malt with a bit of grain. Taste to match. No questioning if this could be an IPA, this is a pale made for the fan of the malt but it is a bit grainy too. Decent cross over brew for the macro fan into the possibility if having flavor in your beer? Probably not something I would revisit, decent session brew if there aren't other options."

"This beer was bland and unmemorable. The best that I can say for it was that it was easy to drink and didn't have any offensive or overpowering tastes/smells/mouthfeel, which I find to be the case with most macros. But absolutely nothing about it stood out. Would only order again if there was nothing better available."
""
""
""

"Overall, this is pretty much like it's yellow 312 counterpart, simple, decent, but nothing special. If you're looking for an everyday drinking pale ale that doesn't pack the hop punch of a SNPA, then this might be your choice."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: You wouldn't guess it from the price tag or the quantity of it in stores, but this is a fantastic beer. Completely unique (in my experience) combinations of flavors, and even if there is no subtlety in them they still provide more than enough depth. What's more, this is The Every Man's Beer: straight from the bottle you will still get all of the nose and flavors, only sacrificing that somewhat confounding but amusing syrupy-looking appearance. Loved it at first sip, and I'm hoping this will be available fresh throughout the summer."

"Urban Pale ale is aromatic and flavorful enough to drink. The citrus is not nearly large enough to support the very malty base. It is always refreshing to get a beer with more than just citrus hops happening, just make them be there if the beer is supposed to have them."

""
""
""
""

"Pretty nice basic pale ale."
""
""
""
"It's got that familiar Goose Island taste. Malty and a bit dry. Very smooth and light bodied. Some vegetable crispness. A mild honey. Dark fruit, grape taste. It has a bronze color, fairly clear with some streams of bubbles here and there. A good foamy white head with a fair amount of spider-web lacing. A bit of a white wine scent to it."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and subdued citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet malt, slight citrus zest, and metallic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a below average beer with subdued aromas and a metallic flavor that isn't all that pleasant."

"Goose Island 312 Urban Pale Ale ---3/5."
""
""
""
""
""
"Usually I quite like Goose Island's beers, so upon seeing this for the first time I thought I'd give it a whirl. It's drinkable, but for most pale ale fans like myself I'm guessing it tastes pretty darn bland. It's a bit too carbonated and rather thin, with little to no aftertaste, and so the overall impression I get is that it's safe, i.e., for those who don't particularly want to drink a pale ale in the first place and don't really realize what they might be missing. Sorry, GI. It's fine, but I'll be passing on this one from now on."

"O - different, but it's not that good. One and done for me. I wouldn't get this again. Not sure where they were going with this gimick, but it wasn't worth the effort. It seems to be more of an InBev-AB push rather than a more crafty Goose Island idea to me."

"Pale copper hue crystal clear completely filtered with a nice off white head forming thick, leaves behind some speckled scattered lacing. The bottle says to serve it into a nonic pint glass, check. Aromatics generic hops a bit of citric quality, maybe some floral notes, but just dumbed down and doesn't really jump out at my senses. Flavor clean pale malts, just hints of labile bitterness from a tame hop profile. Even the malt profile is dead on arrival all carbonation not real malt breadiness just a semi sweet cracker/biscuit quality, residual hop bitterness not much in the way of hop flavors if I had to pick some descriptors I would say herbal and citrus notes (very dumbed down) and approachable...sold at a Speedway gas station this shouldn't offend any of the masses or become a ""eureka"" crossover beer for too many. Mouthfeel, I mentioned the unnatural carbonation, please send us some Goose Island from Chicago...we aren't that far in Ohio. Medium bodied carbonation is just a bit much, no hop oils just a very laid back rather boring stab at a mainstay pale ale. Overall, I'm happy to have a rare taste of Bourbon County Stout or Barleywine, but this shouldn't be this unassuming."
"O - Not one I would pick up regularly but had heard it was inspired by Green Line pale ale so I needed to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Everything in this beer (apart from the aroma, natch) works solidly. While it's too safe to be a great pale ale, it thankfully proves that I can still enjoy a good ""standard"" pale ale from time to time. As far as middle-of-the-road daily drinkers go, this is quite successful."

"I thought that this was a very well balanced beer and I was surprised at how much I liked it. The smell was full of the wheat that is in the original 312 but with a little bit of added grapefruit. The taste delivered more of the same. It was about what I expected but wasn't boring. Overall I thought it was a good beer for the spring and was happy with it. My only criticism is that it is a bit of a dull beer. But I thought that during a nice spring day, watching the snow melt, there are worse things."

"Urban Pale Ale is brewed with Amarillo, Mt. Hood, and Nugget hops, giving it a bright, crisp pine and citrus aroma. Caramel malt gives a slightly sweet body that mingles with pine and grapefruit hop notes in the taste, giving it good overall balance and high drinkability."
""
""
"O -- I jokingly told someone, ""This had damn-well better taste like SNPA."" And while it doesn't exactly, it's definitely on that same plane. Far more full of character than its older 312 brother and proving a good Pale Ale can come out of an A-B brewery... given the right crew to build the recipe!"
