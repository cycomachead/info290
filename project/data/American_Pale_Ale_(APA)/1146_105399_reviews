"Dark copper colored with great clarity and vibrant carbonation bubbles.  A fingernail of off white covers the top.  Light Brussels lacing.  Aroma is citrus hops and light malt.  The taste is very citrus hop forward with plenty of light malt keeping things from going IPA.  The hop bitterness and carbonation tickles the taste buds and is very delicate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a quite nice session pale ale, mild and too-malt forward though."
""
""
""
"Bottled 10-22/drank 2.23, which I had caught this one sooner but it was still  a nice beer. Not IPA class, but it still had a representable amount of  hops aroma left in it. Malty, full thick carbonation, dark amber. Cheap, would buy again at this price, but will keep an eye out for a fresher batch next fall."
"A decent beer although it offers nothing new to the pale ale experience. Pleasant enough."
""
"Nice floral smell from the hops. Smooth yet a very nice kick of hops I look for in my APA's. Overall a well crafted beer."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 10/22/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, apple, light pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/earthy hops and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, apple, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Good amount of pine and earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange peel, apple, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity, balance, and robustness of citrus/earthy hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and a light lingering bitter astringency after the finish; but not too bad. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good pale ale style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of citrus/earthy hops and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"might have been an old bottle.  seemed to be missing something..."
""
""
"O: Not bad.  It hit a lot of the marks for the American Pale Ale standard.  It wasn't jump out of the pack, but it wasn't bad either.  I would say it fits about in the middle, but they did get a pretty color.  Nice kick at 6.2% ABV though."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours an orange amber color.  Just a dusting of head and light blotchy lacing. A bit of pine in the scent. A well-balanced pale ale. Nice representation of the style but not memorable. (8.0)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel may be a hair light, but it is crisp with good hops ""bite"". At 6.2%, you could enjoy a second  one!!!  I would drink this again.  Good APA."
"Decent APA but a little hard to figure out, malt and hops need a tad adjusting. Interestingly, seems like a malty bite with a sweeter hop taste. Appreciate a hidden yeasty taste and like the hoppy ending but generally at times a little rough."
""
""
""
""
"Nice color.  Thin head.  Generic flavor.  Meh."
"I would call this an above average example on an APA. It is darker and has a bit more hops presence than I usually associate with the style. Not a bad beer, but being as I am not a big fan of hops, not one I'd drink a lot of."

"Bought from Table & Vine in West Springfield, MA. From the Goose Island Flight Pack. Served in a glass goblet. The beer has a clear golden-amber appearance with little head retention and spotty lacing on the sides. Aromas included a sweet orange citrus flavor mixed with earthy tones. The beer tasted nicely bittersweet with a good balance of citrus  and malts. Pretty good carbonation to the drink, which allows it to be refreshing and crisp. Overall, a good pale ale."

"Delicious pale ale, wish I had more than 6!"

""
""
""
""
"This is a solid pale ale. I had it in a GI flight pack and found myself wishing I had more than three."
""
"Found it to be better than its average, and am not generally a fan of pale ale."
"Deep clear amber with average head. A very solid strong-ish pale ale, with good balance but a definitely strong hops profile (I would have called it an IPA)."
"Overall: An earthy pale ale, pretty standard, would probably be great locally on tap but hasn't traveled well down to Texas. It's a new label, we may have had old stock dumped on us."

"a fine pale ale, but i had higher hopes. its caramel colored body shows me right away that this thing is going to be balanced by bigger malts until maybe too high a level, and i was right. although the look is nice, clear and bright and holding over an inch of fluffy white head, the nose and taste are less exciting, certainly less sexy. the grain is a little big and a little sweet for the hops, and even without an english yeast profile, it almost tastes like an english pale because of the malts and more bitterness than other flavors coming from the hops. still its crispy and refreshing and not sweet in the taste, i appreciate that part, but i want a little more out of my hops in an american pale than this beer offers, more bitter and grassy than anything else. light feel is nice though, and unexpected for the color, this drinks real easy, almost watered down or something, medium carbonation is fine. overall not the best of goose island here, but their larger batch stuff so rarely is impressive anymore. still, i always buy their beer when i see it, too much good beer they do to not try everything! a solid if a little boring session right here."
"Ten Hills Pale Ale brewed by Goose Island Beer Co., with an ABV of 6.20%  This brew pours out a nice deep amber color with a nice white head. The smell is rich with grains , malts , and hops.  Now for the taste, it is bold with hops. you pick up on a few grains and malts in this brew. Ten Hills Pale Ale has a decent balance to it.  If you do not like hops this not the brew for you. The mouthfeel is bold with flavor, but this ale has a smooth aftertaste.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Over all I'm giving Ten Hills Pale Ale a solid 4 out of 5 I would buy this brew again."
"        Overall, a  4 for Ten Hills Pale Ale - Goose Island Beer Co. For a ""hoppy"" beer, this is smooth and very sessionable."
""
"Ok offering from Goose Island but this beer fails when compared to other beers from goose"
""
""
"A decent pale ale for sure,  I just tend to like my pales ales a little more hop forward,  bordering on ipa territory. At first I was thinking I wished I had tried this one before committing to an entire 6 pack,  but then again on second thought,  the drinkability is definitely high,  so it won't be a chore polishing them off in a couple days."
""
"Taste is light and hippy with a background sweetness. Nice malt balance to even the beer out and make solid in the drinkability category."
"Clear copper pour with thin, clingy white head. Aromas of citrus and plums. Hop flavor starts, with malt becoming apparent in the middle. Finishes with a lingering semi-sweet herbal flavor. Pretty good stuff!"
""
""
"Average beer from GI. Brewery beers seem average."
""
""
""
""
"Alright...Goose Island brews great beer...my reviews of said suds are consistently positive...""Ten Hills"" is a total hang out pale ale..smooth...a little bit of a sweet finish...kinda like a carbonated Tootsie Roll...and if you eat with a decently spiced Chili...you won't go wrong"
""
"Good balance of hops n malt. Smooth finish"

"Not that I was beginning to develop BMC level disregard for anything NOT BCBS and variants from GI, but at the same time, I wasn't setting my expectations very high either. What I got in return was a beauty of APA. From it's near perfect lacing and deep copper to the floral yet a dash citrusy nose, this was setting up to be a nice treat. Taste followed the nose in that the floral nature came shining through with just a hint of spice. Maybe a tiny blast of tart trying to peak through the otherwise very well balanced malt profile. Finally, no cloying sweetness or lingering ""off"" bitterness in an amazingly dry finish. Excuse me now while I plan my trip back to TW to get more of these. Seriously, nice unexpected awesomeness from GI"
""
"O: Overall good although nothing necessarily spectacular. I'd drink it again, but there are certainly other pale ales on the shelf I'd probably pick over it.  Still, decent malt profile and I could see putting down a few of these during a summer BBQ."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty decent beer..pretty balanced not over hopped."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, copper color.  2/3 inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of caramel malt, sweet malt, hops, rye, and alcohol.  Fits the style of an American Pale Ale.  Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of rye, hops, hint of citrus, sweet malt, caramel malt, and a hint of alcohol.  Overall, good appearance, decent aroma, and decent body."
""
""
"O: an okay pale ale, malts are right there with the hops, neither one overpowering the other; some wheaty character come through in the ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent take on a pale ale. Nice earthy hops upfront with a solid caramel malt backing."
""
""
""
"Very nice, bright hoppy taste, smells of citrus and pine needles. Smooth and flavorful, just dances on your tongue, deceptively easy to drink given its higher ABV."
""
""
""
"Bottled on 11/6/14. I thoughts this tasted a lot like Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA, another one of my favorites. Wonderfully balanced, and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fresh tasting pale, almost an IPA in flavor. Nice hoppy flavor and a little boozy for 6.2%. I like it."
""
""
""
""
"Not bad. The aroma had me fairly excited at first but the malts and a fair sweetness combine to distract from the freshness of the hops. Solid but not all that noteworthy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Real fun pale ale, very solid and drinkable and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"picked up a sixer of this easy drinker.  This is a nice balanced pale ale not overly hoppy with a little bit of spice and slightly bitter.  A nice holiday beer."
"The malt could have been more substantial but there is a nice hop bitter finish to this offering."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit on the malty side. Taste is malts up front, some light hops, drinks almost more like an English pale ale. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, not a bad beer per se, but one was enough for me."

"I hope this isn't a one and done with Goose Island. A very pleasant beer. Nice orange/reddish hue with a good amount of head. The smell was very grassy with hints of citrus. The taste was a bit more subdued with the hops, but still had a crisp finish that I really enjoyed. The mouthfeel was light and fizzy and very refreshing. Hope to try this one again soon if possible."
""
"Perhaps my taste-buds don't appreciate pale ales and IPAs properly, but I have yet to find one of either category that I like. They taste like soapy water mixed with intolerably bitter hops, in my opinion. Could barely finish Goose Island's Ten Hills Pale Ale, with every sip becoming harsher and harsher in terms of flavoring. Perhaps I'm just not one for these kinds of beers, however, I can at least appreciate that more time, effort, and labor goes into these than your average macrobrew. As usual, I'm stuck at the corner of admiration and recognition rather than actual appreciation."

"Interestingly, I get a bevy of hops on the nose but those are not what I get in the taste at least immediately. Those roasted pale malts jump in first and then the hops find a way to introduce themselves later."
""
"Overall: A really nice beer. I wish it was a year round offering."

"O - Malty and watery. Not a good combo."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice caramel hue with a lace of thin wispy head. Caramel malt aroma under a piney, lupilin and lemon. The flavor is easy tea leaf malt, pine lemon and a resiny hop. The feel is carbonated and abrasive, thin and harsh. This is a good example of the style but the feel is simply too harsh."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good beer! Definatly would have this one again."

"Fee: Medium body is smooth, with modestly lively carbonation."

""
""
""
""
"On tap at District 13 in Hollywood, Calif., which is worth a visit to help fortify you against the dreadful surroundings. [notes from 25 Feb 2014 visit]"
""
""
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied but could even be described as light as it seems to swing back and forth between the two. With a dry, crisp feel this beer drinks similar to a pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
"In my defense, it actually was my day off... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunrise brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises somewhat mild pine sap, light grass, light flowers, and mild toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, the pine kinda blunt, but still mild enough to the point that it doesn't matter. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a decent little pale ale, nothing to write home about at all, but it's drinkable."
""
""
""
"O-Too malty for an APA, needed more of a hop presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure how I first heard about this beer, but I was intrigued by the story of the hops involved in this beer. The result is, indeed interesting. But it's not very special beyond that. Worth a try (despite being only brewed once, it's still around)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear deep amber color with a huge frothy off white head that persists forever leaving stickies all over the sides of the glass. Aromas of caramel, earth, pine and sulfur. The flavor is sweet rich caramel and toffee with just enough earthy pine to provide a break in the sweetness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy bubbly mouthfeel. English inspired brew, easy to drink, but not really my cup of tea."
""
"~Carry on Citizens!!!~"
""
"Pours amber/honey colored with thick foamy head that persists through drinking. Excellent lacing on sides of glass. Citrus aroma with hints of apple and pine. Very hop forward taste that persists through drinking. The taste is very piney, but you can discern some citrus qualities. Overall a good beer. Not the best APA I have had, but is definitely one I would drink again."
"Mouth is semi-thick and a bit slick. It is a bit too much ABV to session, but it is easy to throw back several. I would like to see this one as a full time offering."

"O - this is a decent pale ale. It will never replace SNPA as my ""go to"" but I wouldn't hesitate to drink another one."
""
"OVERALL: this is not a bad pale ale by any means but was just not the hop profile I prefer. Goose Island makes a lot of good beers but I probably will not but this one again."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty standard pale ale. More British than American. Easy and enjoyable."
""
"Pours a copper-orange in color with a thin white head that lasted through the drinking. Lots of lacing was seen with each sip. The aroma is of various hops and grains. The taste is the same with a slight citrus and floral coming through, BUT ends with a bitter and dry aftertaste. Seems to get stronger with each sip. Ended up pouring about half of it out since it was too 'hoppy' for my liking."
""
""
"The citrus / pine (?) hit me at first sip, but subsequently mellows out. Strong after taste, would be better with a food pairing. The 'pale ale' label ignored - not quite the bitterness - a decent taste. Not sure if I would like to drink a few of them, though, due to the heavy aftertaste. May buy again, next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It’s very one dimensional, but it tastes good."
""
""
""
"The medium body holds it up pretty well. Carbonation is light to moderate. Crispness is consistent. It starts off with a smoothness that continues most of the way but fades out at the end of the sip."
"pours to pint glass, copper orange color. bit of caramel malt on nose, well balanced flavor, this bottle is about 2.5 month old and the hops are fresh enough but I think even fresher this might've been more hoppy but where it's at sits well with me, fair amt of dryness"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A decent, refreshing beer. I enjoyed the malt forward flavor with just enough hop bitterness that wasn't overpowering."
""
""
"A decent pale ale. The mix of malts and hops seems kind of even; at least, not leaning towards the hops. Which I would prefer. Turns out to be a fairly easy drinker though. Kind of a malty sweetness seems to dominate the ride. A nice drinker, though nothing really memorable. I think I'll forget about this one within the next say, 12 hours. If Goose Island did as well, it wouldn't hurt either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Balanced and tasty - a nice pale ale."

""
""

"Paired with the mozzarella sticks...."

"tasty, maybe middle of the road but it has a really nice array of flavors with no peaks - just enjoyment, nice beer"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is like you are eating a flower. My wife loves it, I'm not a huge fan of it. It's different and that's pretty cool. The fact that my wife enjoys it is a big plus for me, that way when I come into the house with a bunch of beer, I can tell her some of it is for here and point to the Goose Island."

"Mouthfeel is thick but surprisingly dry. Pleasant. Overall, this is a pretty solid beer."
"Taste starts with caramel malt, then a hint of orange and musty grapefruit, followed by hearty bread and herbal hops. Has a metallic aftertaste, that ruins the flavor a bit. Feel is heavier than average with expected carbonation for an APA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Fruity and malty APA, good for a change from more citric intense APA."

"I picked up a single to try on 2/24. Bottled on date was 3 months old (11/22/13) so I was leary that it would be stale. Not at all with this pale ale. Very malty and a touch sweet with a crisp slight bittering hop note finish. No citrus or pine bomb at all with this one. I found this Goose Island pale ale very flavorful and enjoyable. Would like to try one fresher to see if is more noticeable hop flavorings besides the finish. Recommend highly."
""
""
""
""
"O: I liked this quite a bit. A solid IPA that could be an every day drinker. But, I can't say I would search it out. There are many beers that fall into this bracket these days."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, bottle 11/23/13. Pours a bright red, with a one inch white head that leaves behind some lace. Smell is cut grass, biscuit, caramel, and pine. Taste what you expect from the nose, a little grapefruit that I didn't get from the nose. Body is medium, plenty of life, a touch dry, and easy drinking. This is solid, seems more like a bitter."

"Goose Island's beers have always been tasty, and this one is no different in that sense. It's a bit different for a pale ale tho, refreshingly so. I picked this up in a mixed 12 pack, but I'd buy another sixer if I found one."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: All in all I liked this pale ale. It has a nice hop character and I'd recommend trying it."
""
"Overall OK but nothing too special, the noble hops mixed with some base American hops seem to get kinda boring, doesn't really do anything wrong but doesn't do a whole lot in any direction, malts are OK btu not great either. It is drinkable and has a nice big bitterness, but fairly meh."

"--I was disapointed by this beer for two reasons. First there were no citrus hop notes as stated by the label. My guess is what little were there to begin with were drown out by the over powering herbal hop notes. Personally when I go for a APA (which I like very much) I wish to have quite a bit of citrus hop flavor in it. Secondly I am extremely disapointed to see this beer was bottled in Baaldwinsville NY, when named for a classic Chicago neighborhood (I live a couple hours outside the city, I would expect a local brewery to brew a local beer? )"

"First beer of the day.Bottled on Nov.7 2013.Pours into a nonic a rich clear brass color with a billowing sticky one finger white head atop,great color and head.Aromas of grassy and leafy hops with a hint of sweet caramel malts.Leafy and mildly citric hops at the onset of the palate that don't really linger,light sweetness from caramel/biscuit malts.Not a complex APA but not bad,I would have liked more hop complexity but again not bad."
"Overall, there's something about the taste and aroma that I cannot identify that makes me not care for this beer much."

"O- This is a decent APA. It is nothing to write home about and I am surprised. I expected more from Goose Island, but it is still a solid APA."

"Overall not a bad ale but I don't think I will revisit. Sorry Goose Island if only it didn't smell so bad."
"more interesting than the honker ale, not sure if it's better"

"O-A well welcomed new brew. Will buy again. So refreshing. Bold flavor yet smooth going down. You can chug like a lighter color/pale beer, or sip like brown/darker brews. The taste was the highlight of the beer. Packs enough pine and citrus to be labeled a full on IPA rather than pale ale. The addition of caramel, brown sugar and bready tastes make this a unique, multi-layered beer. I can see Ten Hills Pale Ale becoming a year-round offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty generic pale ale from GI here. I picked up a bottle to fill out my mixed 6 pack. Seems on the border between English pale and American pale--not malty enough for EPA and not hoppy enough for APA, so pretty generic."
""
""
"Pours rich copper, dark but see through, white foam atop. Citrus, malt, grass, trees, all in the nose. Taste is a light spicy hop kick, which fades into a subtle sweetness. Fresh tasting. Bright. Little bitter sticks in at the end. Nice pale. Juicy."
""
"Nice mouthfeel and pretty drinkable so the other bottles I have won't be a chore to finish but I would not buy another lot of Ten Hills."
""
"Recommended, especially if you get a great deal on them - these were $8.99 for 6."
""
""
"O: Fairly straighforward for the style, perhaps a bit more aromatics and herbal would be better."
""
""
"This one doesn't really resonate with me. They should stick to English or Belgian style ales."
""
""
""
"Taste is a well-balanced mesh of malty sweetness and citrus hoppiness. The finish has a slightly bitter twist on the back of the palate, but overall this is a superb pale ale, and one I'd have no trouble revisiting again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crystal clear and light apricot colored with ruddy edges and a low off-white head that settles quickly. Low aroma of apple and pear, some biscuity malt. Flavor of bready malt, subtle hops, honey, firm bitterness, some lemon and pepper, grassy notes. Moderate mouthfeel, not too full. Decent beer overall, but not among this producer's best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - While I don't drink much Goose Island ""craft beer"" I saw limited release on the bottle along with a hops from elf mountain farms, seemed interesting. Turns out Elk Mountain Farms is Anheuser-Buschs hop farm. Another example of a macro brewer pretending to be micro. I should have know better."
""
""
"Noticed that this is brewed in Baldwinsville, btw--so it's more Anheuser-Busch than Goose Island, probably. I was expecting more from GI. Kind of a harsh bitter taste, like hops extract, maybe. Good body, color, head retention, just not an entirely pleasant taste."

"O- My favorite beer from Goose Island. Great hop flavors prevail in a drinkable clean ale. Not a favorite but solid."
""
"Overall: easy drinking ale. Nice flavor profile, and a beer you can have a few of in a session."
""
""
"Medium body with a blast of dry, sticky bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and caramel malt backbone into a slightly boozy, bone dry finish. Surprisingly hop forward with resinous bitterness, grassy pine needle and spruce tip countered by subtle citrus/tropical fruit sweetness and a caramel malt backbone. Some grapefruit and citrus rind sweetness cutting through the bitterness along with caramel, toffee, light fruit, bread and biscuit. Only 6.2% but there's noticeable boozy heat in the finish slightly taking away from the hop flavors. Decently balanced with nice bitterness but it's a touch too boozy for my liking and could use a stronger citrus/tropical fruit character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: The feel of this beer is not too thin not too heavy just the right place right in the middle. Well done beer by Goose Island."
""
""
"Taste was more malt forward, very lightly bitter and grassy with a dried orange peel note. Light bodied, supple feel, fairly smooth though the carb level is noticeably moderate. Overall it seems to have lost some hop nuance, or maybe it wasn't very assertive to begin with. Nothing worth going out of your way for, but it washed down Thai food well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a decent American Pale Ale and I thought it was a pretty average example of the style with it not having anything that sets it apart from all the other average American Pale Ales that seem to flood the market. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, clean, crisp, not filling, but the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention and I could see myself getting bored with it so I think one would be my limit. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both pretty nice and true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the kind of generic hop flavor and the high amount of sweetness in the aroma, I think those were the two weakest points of this beer. I don't think I would buy this beer again, I might order a pint to go with food, but I don't think I'll be stocking up on this Limited Release and I can't say I would recommend it as Good American Pale Ale, but it's not a bad beer. All in all I thought this this beer fell right in the middle of the style, it wasn't bad and there wasn't anything offensive about it, but it wasn't memorable to me and it didn't have anything that made it stand out. Better luck next time guys, this one was a little bit of a disappointment."

"Overall: A decent APA, but nothing worth writing home about. I wanted to try this as it is Goose Island's first widely distributed new beer since the AB-Inbev takeover. Certainly not bad, but does not even come close to unseating Sierra Nevada Pale Ale as the best widely available, cheap APA on the market. Offers a good introduction to hop characters to beer drinkers who may not be used to it."

"O: This is like a very tame version of Celebration in terms of the malt/hops balance and hops used. Drinkable but not particularly interesting."

"Goose Island is a macro brewery that is as good at faking it as my women. Whenever I purchase a Goose Island product I feel like I am really indulging in a craft brew, yet they technically are a macro brewery in lieu of ownership. Nonetheless, this beer, like most Goose Island products, really pulls it off. The appearance is a dark orange that leaves decent lacing, and the aroma is malty and bitter, just like the taste. It tastes like a standard I.P.A.(Stone, Alaskan ect) with extra malt and bitterness. The carbonation is electric, and yet it finishes smooth. This beer is not up to par with Honker's or Sofie, but if you are craving a pale ale with some pronounced bitterness, this is a great choice, as the price is definitely fair."
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and slight nail polish remover aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and slight herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with an odd nail polish remover aroma that thankfully doesn't come across in the taste."
" Easy drinking IPA I would have again."
"I've had this both on tap and from the bottle in the last week. I had hoped it was bad draught but the bottle confirmed that this beer blows. It is so bad i'd actually like my money back, i have 5 more in my fridge if anyone wants them. The appearance is super dark for a pale, honestly, it's dark even for a stiff IPA. The taste is nothing like i'd expect, Pale Ale is a real stretch in name. This is a poorly flavored IPA. No fruit, pine, kind of spicy but overall just pretty shitty."

"Not a bad beer, some great fragrance and flavor. Doesn't seem completely balanced, but it's worth trying"

"Overall it looks and smells fantastic but that only gets you so far. Taste is what brings you back and ten hills there is little flavor. I would buy a six pack but not a case."

"On the label the hops are noted as from Elk Mountain Farms and they are fairly subtle but very, very nice. The bottle also says limited edition, so it may be hard to find more."
""
"Easy to drink, a nice straight forward APA, that I would consider buying again. Loved the way this started, but flavors toned down as it warmed"
""
"Overall, this is a great, cheap, smooth, balanced pale ale. Not one for people who want a hopped up pale ale, but more for those who want more balance. Reminds me of the standard brew at your corner pub."

"Very drinkable beer. Not overwhelmingly bitter, and the malt is restrained enough to let the delicate floral hops show through."

""
""
"Overall: Another solid Pale Ale to enter the American market. Solid enough, but probably not really needed."
""
""
"O: A good APA with great balance and good drinkability. The hop/malt combo works very well and helps out with the drinkability. If you don't mind supporting the big boys, this is a solid choice for an APA"
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours clear amber with long lasting, fluffy, white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops, orange fruit and biscuit malt. Body is medium and tangy. Taste is of citrusy and herbal hops, biscuit malt and ripe fruit. Finish is long, grapefruity. Nice, easy drinking APA."
""
"Very malt forward with a surprisingly full body. Generally not what I look for in a Pale Ale."
""
""
""
"Overall -Pretty good and easy to enjoy. Has a sweet citric flavor that makes it easy to drink but its not something id want to drink a lot of. The wheat is masked under all the fruits and sugars, throwing the balance off some. Still worth a drink."
""
""
"I could drink this one all night long."
"o: A fine American pale ale with an exceptionally well balanced malt/hop profile. Hops make themselves known but are not gratingly bitter by any means. A worthwhile addition to the Goose Island lineup."
""
""
""

" The taste is very good lots of citrus from the hops with a mild caramel malt flavor which adds dimension to the pine-like hops and some mild alcohol in the finish. Overall I enjoyed this as it is a solid stronger pale ale, not quite an IPA hop wise, but pretty nice balance"
"Bottled on date Nov 22, 2013. Pours a deep copper amber hue with a big khaki light tan head, forms fine intricate lacing with more than ample head retention going on. Aroma has citrus notes, with a hint of sourdough bread...dig deeper and I get some earthy pine hop notes as well. Flavors hit middle of the road mainly muddled malts with an earthy, pine, slightly citric hop accent. Not quite an orchestra of hops like I was hoping more of another muddled hard to pick out hop character, by the way this batch was brewed in Baldwinsville, NY versus in Chicago. At least the labels are honest, I've found Oktoberfests and Harvests brewed and bottled at both locations. It's a hoppy beer yet it's hard to distinguish the cohesiveness of these darker caramel malts and these hops from Elk Mountain Farms, definitely solid and sessionable and will be shared at the party we are hosting tomorrow night. However, I want more expressive hops in my pale ales, especially when the label is as green and littered with as many hops as this label expresses. Mouthfeel has a slight resinous feel with ample carbonation, yet something is off...I'm having a hard time expressing what it is I don't care for but it's lacking something."
""
""
"The Ten Hills IPA from the Goose is decent. The beer poured a nice clear amber with 1/4 finger thick head that is lacing nicely. The scent to me is floral in nature...almost smell bubblegum. The taste is on the bitter side and is more of a pot purri flare. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall its a good beer."

"Nice little surprise right here! This is a very good APA, interesting hop profile, similar to this years Hop Trip from Deschutes but not quite as pungent."
""
""
""
"Overall this brew pushes the limits of an APA with its dark color and dominating hop profile. I think this brew was released at a good time: just before winter. With cold temperatures I want my brews to be darker and more flavorful. It's pleasant to drink and does an excellent job of featuring the hops. My only critique is that I would like some more malt flavor to balance the hops."
""
""
"Poured into GI pint glass. Appearance is a nice filtered deep gold with white head that retains nicely and leaves dense lacing. The nose has some earthy hop character with some firm pine and not much else. I must say, it is not my favorite hop profile, but there is definitely significant hops in the aroma. The pine comes on fairly strong on the flavor and has a strong bitterness by midpalate. The finish leaves some malty notes with caramel coming through. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with light body. Overall, not a bad 12 pack brew from GI, but definitely prefer Harvest Ale or Honkers to this."

"Overall –This was a very enjoyable brew with a great feel, nice smooth taste profile, and very pleasant and easy drinking feel. I would like to see this made an average release instead of a limited. Rather tasty."
"O: Enjoyable but not really anything special - interesting combination of hops with the herbal notes very present. I liked it but I'm not sure that I would grab it again as there are many others more interesting/enjoyable to me in the style."

"O -- A nice Pale Ale addition to the shelves, maybe more to my liking because it's a limited release and shouldn't turn into ""just another pale ale."" More herbal than fruity, as Pales go, but very satisfying for a hop hit."
""

"O-the balance is the best part. Great hops taste that goes to a dry malt finish, and nothing about it overpowering."
