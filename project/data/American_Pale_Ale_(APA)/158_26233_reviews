"Still excellent, but lacking that hop pop. I rated this as the earlier tasting of this beer.  My advice...look for this early next year and drink it fast!"

"Fresh and taste."
""
"Pours from the tap at McNellie's OKC a dark copper with about a finger of white head. It dissipates fairly soon, leaving moderate lacing. As several others have said, there is very little aroma. Maybe there's a hint of bread, but it's probably more in my mind than my nose. Tastes of caramel, toffee and just a bit of hops in the aftertaste. The mouth is nice and creamy. Maybe there's something wrong with the tap because this tastes more like a hoppy brown than a pale ale. It's not bad, but rather unremarkable."

"Overall: My top two in fresh hop beers, I still think Founder's harvest edges this on out in flavor and aroma by a small margin. But this one is definitely a top notch beer."

"Poured a brownish reddish color...looks filtered and a big frothy 2 inch off white head. drinking out of a frosted snifter glass. a good looking beer. Not getting much off the smell which is odd coming from a bottle titled FRESH HOP, this did not smack me in the face like a stone enjoy by would for example. Getting some earthy soil like grassy hops....some pine..tad of sweetness, not much at all here. weird. Taste follows the smell to a tee...pretty one dimensional and straight forward, but not bad at all. grassy...leaves a slight bitterness on the palate after swallowing. very drinkable and enjoyable. Almost a session beer I would say. I feel like I went in thinking this was going to be a giant hop monster Double IPA. For a pale ale...this is good. Medium carbonation and slightly creamer in the mouth. very enjoyable."

""
""
""
"Beautiful head. Tasty! Spot on, fresh, grassy hop profile. Hops are aggressive, but not overwhelming. Bitterness has some bite, but without biting your head off. Complex herbal and botanical notes, with citrust and grapefruit notes adding brightness and zing. A great beer! Get it fresh and on tap!"

""

"O - An enjoyable offering.  If you are into pine and grass, this will serve you well."

"Ruby red grape fruit and grass. Great take on an apa it's a refreshing change of pace , check the date because freshness is the key here.. it's a very drinkable ale that has a one dimensional citrus flavor and smell but it's not such a bad thing... I will continue to buy it , great beer to enjoy with a something off of the grill..."

"Overall:  One of the best fresh hop ales around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light tea colour with pleasant frothy head. Nose is bright and herbaceous, with hints of fruit. Taste is complex with melon rind, white pepper, thyme, bitter grass, and a nice oily, creamy malt palate. Great!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a bit closer to an IPA than a true pale ale, but whose drawing that line?  I really liked this beer and was sad to see the last of it in my glass."

"O-This is a pretty tasty beer. I like how the hops are not overly juicy, but not overly bitter or harsh, either. The balance is well done and the fresh hops provide a unique aspect to the mouthfeel, in particular. A nicely done beer."
""
""
""
"Bottle best-by dated 12/24/14. Darker caramel color than I expected, with almost no head. The taste is predominated by caramel malt flavors, with some floral and bitter notes contributed by the hops. Not bad, but I would've liked to see the other elements of the beer be a bit more delicate to let the fresh hops shine through."
""
""
""
"Not the easiest 6%-ish pale to throw back, but if you're craving dank hops with a lighter malt-backbone, this might hit the spot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, one of the better fresh hop IPAs I've sampled to date and at a great price point it's likely I'll pick this one up again soon."

"Overall this is extremely drinkable and interesting beer that I will definitely be drinking again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is medium with some heft and depth to it, revealing a couple layers on the tongue as it rolls smoothly over, almost silky without giving up a strong crispness all the way from beginning to end."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I can't say this is the best wet hop ale I've had, but it's a very good one, and much easier to obtain than some of my favorites. As such, I will slot this into the list of seasonal beers I must procure when they come out each year."

"overall, it's alright but I cant say it's above 85 overall. maybe the date has something to do with it . . . ."
""
""
"T/M: carbonated beginning with an orange-honey, mango sweetness on top of a grapefruit-grassy mouth draw. The tastes work well together, neither side overpowering. A well-balanced beer, but one that could use maybe just a little more hop bite."
""
"O-this isn't a bad ale but when compared to other fresh hops ales it comes up a little short. Best by date of 30 December makes me think this bottle is just past its prime. Will have to try it again next year."
"O: it is definitely a big fresh hop ale. Those dusty, dank resinous new hop notes present a nice complex hop brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"I bought this about a week from the expiration date which was Dec.30 so freshness was about 99% lost. I'm sure fresh this would be a good beer but not this time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, copper-gold coloring, crystal clear with some carbonation bubbling, and a frothy, cling, off-white head that coats the glass as you drink. Aromas of wet, green hops, with cut grass, pine tassels, a subtle pepper spicing, and resinous bitter notes. Flavors are bitter forward, with a resinous background of pine pitch and subtle caramel notes, with piney, grassy, and subtle citrus highlights of lemon and grapefruit. Very well balanced and flavorful. Smooth bodied, but kept light and crisp with the carbonation. The aftertaste is resinous and bitter, and the caramel rich notes help to balance throughout. Awesome lacing left along the glass. The finish is slightly dry, crisp, and clean. Solid beer, and ridiculously easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very balanced easy drinking pale ale."
"BBD of 12/30/13. Pours a light copper with a nice head that laces well. Mild nose of pine hops with a citrus background. Light medium body with normal carbonation. Nice balanced hop flavor with grapefruit at the front while the pine claims the back end. Finishes clean with a slight residual bitterness of mostly grapefruit and then followed by pine. A sound beer that is well suited for those that desire a not too hoppy brew."
""
"The pours a creamy and frothy head that dissipates quickly but still leaves some foam around the edges and clings to the glass. The beer is a clear dark amber color with a slight reddish tinge. The beer has a stronger malt smell than expected but the hop smell is not too diminished. The hops have a wet grassy smell to them and slight notes of pine resin as well. The taste is similar to the smell but with a much maltier presence. The hops are much more bitter and a wet grassy taste than the smell but still have slight notes of pine. The malt is stronger than the smell and only slightly offset the hops with a sweet malt taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but on the heavy side with biting carbonation. The feel is smooth bordering on velvety an dis quite refreshing. Overall, a very good pale ale with wet hops. I'll definitely pick this one up again each year."

"O - A good beer but I think I was expecting just a little more hop tones, especially in the taste, than what I got."
""
""
""
""
"Lightly carbonated. Good color that is an amber golden. Smell is a very pleasant hoppy odor that teases the taste buds. Minimal floral hints. A real earthy simple scent. The taste is equally simple and straight forward. Just as I expected from the name. The hoppy bitterness is not compounded by further complexities. A delightful beer that is deserving of the name ""fresh hops"". I will be looking for this beer again."
""
""
""
"O - Not terrible, but there's something either in the execution or unique to this bottle that puts the balance out of whack."
""
"Overall: A pretty fresh tasting APA. You get a nice burst of hops but it finishes sort of empty. Once the hops hit the palate they are gone not too long after and there isn't much left to it. I like brews with a little more bite with a solid aftertaste. It's still a solid brew from Great Divide and I would definitely dig into another bottle."
""
""
"o: An exceptionally easy-drinking fresh hop ale. However, I still prefer the much cheaper SN hemispheres, so will probably not pay $8 for this again when I can get either of those for $5. Plus you get 3 ounces more with the SNs."
""
""
""
"Poured a orangish golden hue with one finger head that left a lace ring around the glass. Fresh, floral, grassy citric hop smell with touch of sweet caramel and biscuits. The slightly breadiness and sweet caramel malt add balance and fullness (not quite chewey but definitely not thing) to a mostly floral/grassy, citric hop beer that isn't sharp or biting but still packs a punch. This is as close as it seems one can get to a hoppy IPA (or even DIPA) without making the hops so dominant that everything else is just outside the lines. Very enjoyable and sessionable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well I am so pleasantly surprised by this. I was quite disappointed with last year's release (in fact, I kept coming across a similar very astringent grassy note in many of their beers that threw me off, not the case here). This is a great wet-hopped beer with all the right resiny, oily hoppy goodness. Well done Great Divide"

"A fantastic beer. One of the better examples of the IPA/APA style."
""
"O - Stupid beer. I say that because there's a lot missing here, aroma is good for sure, but the taste is unbalanced, too much malt, and this diacetyl problem keeps persisting with almost every Great Divide beer I've had in recent times."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-Very nice beer. Strong layered aromas are my favorite part. I would've preferred a longer finish but I can forgive for this solid beer."
"O-Another great fresh hop beer. The fresh hops are showcased nearly as well in an APA as oppose to an IPA but still a yummy and very affordable beer."
""
""
"Beer is medium-light to medium in body, which is surprisingly thin for the ABV and style of beer. Carbonation is of medium intensity, leading to a mouthfeel of foamy (1/4), smooth (1/2), and watery (1/4) sensations. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness on the palate and lips."
""
"I like the balance in Great Divide Fresh Hop, as it makes for a versatile beer. It doesn't really fit the bill when it comes to the fresh hop A(I)IPA style, though. A very good, nicely balanced APA, but not really worth the price per fl. oz. in bomber format."
""
"Pours a clear amber with a thick white head. Decent retention and lacing.  Citrus and pine on the nose, subtle, nothing overpowering. Starts with a grassy earthiness, slightly bitter but without that IPA bite. Sweet malt comes in mid-palate that balances the hop bitterness perfectly. Finishes dry and slightly bitter. Overall, this is an extremely drinkable fresh hop pale. Well crafted and balanced, another quality beer from Great Divide."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O for 7.99/bomber this is a good pickup. I would buy another in thr future. I would pair it with some sort of roasted lamb or a cut of primerib and some seasonal veggies. Kudos to Great Divide for a tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a finely crafted beer that is superbly light on the palate. Very drinkable, it goes down very smooth, it covers the palate and very enjoyable.. My only complaint about this brew is I wish more of the hop, dank, sweetness and pine notes would have come through. I understand this brew is not meant to be the boldest IPA. Great divide went for balance and I must say they got very close to perfect. I just wish more smell was present. If you served this to me with any other IPA this would not stand out, until I tasted it. However, this is a very nice balanced IPA, probably the best I've had in the taste category. And is a variety break from the darker, heavier brews in the Autumn season. Cheers!"
"Overall, this is everything a wet-hop ale should be, plus some. Big bright hop character, and some an excellent malt backbone, just damn tasty."
""
""
"Get it up and get it good."
""
""
"O: a very solid take on the style, with lots of fresh grain and (hop) flower"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light to medium bodied with average carbonation and a bitter finish. A good fresh hop APA.."
""
"Overall: A very good fresh hopped take on the American Pale Ale style. Very grassy and juicy with a nice smooth medium body."
"All in all this is a solid drink, malts are raw and earthy and I expected a bit more boldness from a fresh hop beer. We can't forget that this is only a pale ale so it competes well for the style."
"Mouthfeel is great lots of hopy oils and a medium body gives this a moderate sticky thickness. Carbonation is mild and gives it a soft feel."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, citrus zest, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and earthy herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a sightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice fresh hop profile but the mouthfeel is a bit thicker than what I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep gold with thick white foam, good carbonation rising up from the bottom of the glass, head recedes back to an easy half inch of thick foam. Lots of pine and dank resin on the nose, some bread, a touch of citrus and grass. Flavors follow the nose. Bready malt backbone, just enough to support the hops that dominate the flavor. I get thick, resinous pine hops with a bit of citrus as well. Great hop presence in this beer. Mouthfeel is dry, yet oily and sticky from the hops. Overall, out of the fresh hopped beers this year, this is hands down the best."
"Cheers!"

"O= The relatively light body showcases the hops wonderfully, they are certainly in the foreground but by no means overpowering or overly bitter. Very drinkable and flavorful. No complaints to be had."

"Later EDIT: discussed this with a couple of friends and they are confirming that the October batches are selling for huge discounts on both keg and bottle - don't let the hype on ""Fresh"" sway you, the 1/6bbl costs me $40 which is a screaming deal on any IPA of quality. I hear the former $12-13 bombers are going for $3-4, which again, is a heck of a deal on a marvelous beer!"
""
""
""
"O: Wonderful. Do try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall far from the best fresh hop ales but I believe this may be one of the best pale ale fresh hopped ales I ever drank. Pity it cost 10-13 dollars fresh or I would love to get it again. If you see it now discounted for as cheap as I got it give it a try!"
"O: a nice APA with good bitterness that isn't overly obtrusive or complicated"

"very great and intense hop flavor and extremely hop forward flavored beer pretty high bitterness really great flavor relatively light beer with a lasting bitter dry finish"
""

"I'm a fan, and I'm just getting to like IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is smooth and almost crisp, with a medium body, light zesty carbonation and a bitter finish which was on the light bitter side, full of fresh piney and citrus hops with a nice balanced mix of bready malts and juicy hop sweetness. A top notch pale ale that was incredibly easy to drink and could be great on its own or paired with food. Overall it was fantastic, very easy to drink and really smooth."

"O: Probably one of the best fresh hop ales I've had. It's about two months old so I imagine this was orgasmic when fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is one of the best APAs I've had to date!"
"Overall this beer works as a fine IPA, a clean example, not complex in my opinion , but well-made nonetheless. Until I try some of this brewery's acclaimed stouts, a couple of which I'm still aging a bit, this is about my favorite beer of theirs to date."
""
""
""
"Overall, a good APA but a little too average. Even with it being fresh hopped there just isn't a whole lot here that really sticks out to set this beer apart from the thousands like it out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had big expectations given the experiences with Great Divide. It's a good beer but there are better choices. Nothing stood out as far as complexity with aroma or flavor. Maybe I had an off bottle."
""
"Overall, this is excellent beer, and it’s amazing to see what Great Divide can do to a pale ale: the difference between this and a standard offering in the style is akin to the difference between Michelangelo and a talented high school student. The sheer variety and potency of flavors in here is impressive, made all the more so by the light ABV and the mid-range IBUs. Well worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice fresh hop pale ale that went well with the spicy chinese food I was eating. I'd have this again and I'm looking forward to having it on draft. I enjoyed this year's Founders Harvest ale better though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours clear copper with minimal head. Aroma slams with grassy, piney hops. Taste follows, with this one highlighting the hops foe sure. Interestingly there is a massive malt backbone to this, and it doesn't take away from the grapefruit and aromatic hops. Excellent pale with medium carbonation and slick palate. Malty sweetness really comes out as it warms up. Good stuff."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured golden yellow-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, spice, and spicy hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, citrus, citrus hop, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. The hoppiness aspect going on here really carried on throughout the entire glass in both the aroma and flavor. The flavor was fairly well balanced and inviting. If I hadn’t been on a ticking spree this day I likely would have had a full pint of this one without hesitation. Definitely worth your time trying if you have not done so before."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear, golden with a effervescent white head.Flavor and aroma matched each other quite well offering some nice bright floral and grassy hops on top of a sweet crackery malt belly. A lighter, active mouthfeel. Overall, an enjoyable beer. Glad I got to try try, would happily drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the better fresh hop beers out there. Wish I could have had this closer to the bottling date but it's held up well after more than a month in the bottle and a trip across the country."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very solid beer. Right up there in the fresh hop brews this year."
""
"O - One of the better fresh hop beers I've had. It really hits that wet / fresh / dank note, but it's rounded out well with a floral hop backing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent brew. Would certainly like to have it again and again."
""
""
""
"Pours beautiful copper/gold with nice inch of white foam. Nose is bold, grassy, funkiness. Some citrus peel and melon are detected as well. The flavor definitely picks up that dank grassiness in a big overwhelming way. There is some fruitiness in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is decent with good amount of carbonation. IMO it drinks heavy for what I would classify an APA. Ultimately it just didn't do it for me. Lacked nothing in terms of flavor but the flavor just didn't work on my palate. Far too one dimensional with a dank mulchiness that struggled to achieve any complexity."
"O- Haven't had this one in a while but it's just as good as I remember it. Can't ask for much more in a pale ale except maybe that it be sold in 6-packs rather than a bomber. Guess you can't always get what you want."
""
""
""
"This is one of GD's best beers."
""
"Overall - A well done, tasty beer. Love the 1 2 punch of hops, then malts. Very balanced and easy to drink. Good price, easy enough to find, worth the purchase for sure."
""
""
""
"Drink- I will say I am usually excited for GD beers. Although besides the Yeti lineup my fervor is waining for some other beers in the series. May have to try to land things in the 12oz size before going 22oz. Probably wont have this one next year."
"This pale ale is a very clear amber color with a modest white ring of head and spotty lacing. The aroma comes on with skunky grass hop and deep grape wheat. For a pale ale it's nice enough for sure. The flavor is mellow toasted rye/wheat and soft lemon grass hops. Very crisp feeling with medium to near light body. Frisky carbonation for an edgey hop brew. Very refreshing and tasty."
""
"O- A solid fresh hop ale. A more floral hop profile then the usual from GD. I can really feel the freshness in this beer, good stuff."
""
""
"O: Overall, an excellent wet hop ale. I can't tell what time of hops were used but very delicious."
""
""
""
"Lots of bubbles run throuigh the body of this orange colored brew. A creamy inch thick head sits on top and retains very well. The nose is ""fresh", and grassy. I wasn't expecting so much grass, but that's fine. It tastes grassy too. Grassy notes with some grapefruit rind and herbal notes. Very hoppy, that's certain. It's medium bodied and somewhat creamy, rounding out what is a good fresh hop ale."
""
""
"This is one that I’ve wanted to try for years, but always passed it up for some reason. Decent fresh hop ale, but not my favorite as it is more balanced than I like, fairly malty."
"O: Pretty well balanced making the beer fairly easy to drink - also, it is not overly bitter. Enjoyable."
""
"O: Super easy to drink pale ale. Very pricey though ($7.99 for 22oz)."
"O:  I was so excited when I grabbed this off the shelf. 9 days old, super fresh. Alas, I was kinda let down. Don't get me wrong it's a great beer but I expected much more. The aroma has something odd that is dairy like and wrong. Not to the point of ruin but still wrong. The hops are really fresh and the overall flavors are well balanced. Expectations aside this is a great pale ale. "
""
"O - Dank and grassy for a normally pale and light beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Re-EDIT: 2013 Batch - much improved over 2012's. More grassy presence, and a very nice cracker malt base. Nice fresh hop presence into the hang. I've updated my ratings to reflect this batch."
""
""
"Pours a honey golden with rich amber hues with a fluffy one and half finger head. The smell of sweet pineapple and fresh grassy notes on the nose is very inviting. Opens with pineapple, flora, and grassy accents, joined by slight breadiness and malt with just the perfect level of sweetness to balance this brew midpalate. Finishes smooth with just a hint of grapefruit rind and pine sap and a slight bite. Medium bodied with a slick, oily, and slight soapy mouthfeel, perfect for a wet hop ale. I look forward to this brew every year. The drinkability of the brew is exceptional as the other characteristics of the brew are not overwhelmed by intense bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really liked this one, it is extremely easy drinking and it has a great creamy mouth feel."

"(Overall) Pretty good brew but there's certainly a marked difference between a fresh batch and one that has been around for a while. Get this and enjoy it as fresh as possible, or miss out on a lot of content. 3.5"

"This is a really nice pale ale and the type of hop really seems to make a big difference. The freshness adds a touch of that earthy, grassy feel while remaining juicy, citrusy and finally dry and bittering. Really good beer here, very drinkable and balanced."
""
""
""
""
"Single finger head with nice lacing on a golden with amber tones hazy body. This one is very aromatous, with citrus mostly pineapple with hops and a subtle pine note. The taste is a bit of a let down. Mostly a musty hop flavor withe a soapy finish. Actually a little plain. Maybe I was expecting too much from a pale ale. Very drinkable and smooth. Medium body and moderate carbonation."
""
""
"D ~ Well balanced & extremely drinkable. Why is this not in Six packs?"
""
""
""
""

"Fresh Hop is a sessionable pale ale that will also please the discerning beer lover out there. In a world of fist-to-mouth IIIIPA's (yeah, four Is) this is a nice break that offers a rare opportunity to reflect on the complexity that can be found in a pale ale."
"I liked this beer and went back and forth on a host of ratings, but decided to settle on my initial thoughts. I’d definitely give it another go."
"This was the first beer that I've had from Great Divide and was very impressed and cant wait to crack open the bottle of Yeti I have in the basement. Fresh Hop was very easy to drink which is nice. You can easily have a bomber to yourself or split it with someone which is half the fun of craft beer."

"Poured an attractive copper color with a generous white head that dissipated slowly leaving a thin layer of head across the top. The aroma is of grassy hops and smells outstanding. The taste is of citrus hops and is medium-bodied. This is a very good beer and very drinkable. I would definitely have this again."

"Overall, this is the best pale ale I've personally ever had. My bottle date was October 3, 2011 so my only wish is that I could have drank this a couple of months ago so it would have been more fresh. I still believe SNPA sets the standard for the style but if this was sold in six pack form and readily available, which I imagine would be nearly impossible because of the fresh hops used, this would be one of my go to beers. Another great beer from Great Divide."

"Appearance is a hazy copper with significant lacing. I expected a dominating hop nose, but instead found myself noticing the earthy tones and a bit of citrus hops. Tasted sweet, citrusy, and more malty than I thought this would be as a fresh hop beer. Little carbonation on this beer. I wonder if drinking it while it was fresher would have given more of a hop impression. Regardless, it is an extremely enjoyable pale ale and something I'd buy again."

"Flavor is hop forward at first, mirroring the nose of oranges and fruit. Candy maltiness comes into the middle. Firm balancing bitterness in the finish. Nice full mouthfeel."

"Crisp finish with a floral and citrus aftertaste. Overall a very easy drinking fresh hop brew that still satisfies a hop head's desire to be immersed in dank. Will drink again!"
""
"Dr: Quite drinkable, but largely unremarkable for the style. I wouldn't have it again. It's okay."
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy!"
""
"Pours a crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a thin laced head full of tight bubbles and a frothy foam. Citrus hops on the nose, fruity, piny tones, big sweet refreshing scents pouring from the hops. Sugary sweet citrus hops explode in the mouth, hop from front to finish, bitter lemony finish. Light bodied, high carbonation, clean, easy to drink. This is a mega hopped fruit filled easy to drink pale ale. Will come back to this beer again for sure."

"22 ounce bottle with green foil over the cap, bottled on 9/30/2011. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick lacing cap that lasts. Good amount of lacing clings to the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up from the bottom. Aromas of huge fresh orange zest, lemon, pine, grass, light caramel, breadiness, and light spiciness. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of big orange, lemon, pine, grass, biscuit, and spiciness. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, grass, pine, biscuit, and spiciness on the finish for a while. No alcohol noticed at all except for a slight warming after the finish. Great balance of bitterness and sweetness. Medium carbonation and body with a slightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Overall this is definitely an excellent fresh hopped pale ale. Very drinkable with nice flavor balance."

"D - Very drinkable. Nice malt and hop balance from start to end with a nice hop profile as well. Very sessionable for 6.1% abv."
"Cheers!"
""
"O: Certainly airs on the side of an IPA. Great Divide ships the hops for this beer overnight from the West Coast, so with this level of attention to the hops it's not surprising that they dominate the beer. Overall a great pale ale (from a devoted DIPA drinker). Would buy again, bomber or six pack."
"O - This has good drinkability. It is a nice refreshing, easy going pale ale, and it really hits the spot. I think this is a really nice beer on a warm summer day, but it works all around as well. The hop flavor is perfect in this for it being a pale ale. Overall, I really enjoyed this, and I would buy it again. I recommend trying it out."
""
""
"M: Mouthfeel is medium; Carbonation is refreshing and well balanced. The piney resin along with the biscuity malts, give for a great medium bodied, but non-aggressive APA."
""
""
"Bottle 650ml. Color unclear hazy orange with smal not lasting white head. Aroma malt ,extremely hoppy giving it notes of citrus and pine, grass. Taste sweet, bitter, citrus, long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. Refreshing."

"I am a fan of the fresh hop/wet hop experimentation brewers are experimenting with these days. There is a purity I detect with this approach, and while these beers sometimes lack the complexity of the more traditional hopping technique, I like the fact we get choices. The Fresh Hop Pale Ale has an orange-copper color when poured, and retains a friendly skim of head throughout my glass. Aromas are full of sweet pink grapefruit with some floral notes hiding in the back. I detect a bit of molasses sweetness on this one, too. Highly quaffable and refreshing with the expected bitterness. Does not totally dry the mouth, but I wouldn't want a pale ale to do that. Seems a bit maltier than the Sierra Nevada Northern Hemisphere but only just."
""
""
""
"Conclusion: For all those who love hops and wish to deepen their appreciation and understanding of their flavor spectrum, fresh hop ales add another category for exploration. This beer is a great example, and one that I would happily drink again and again."

"Great Divide’s Fresh Hop is resinous, but there might not be enough base malt flavor to back it up. It’s a well-hopped pale ale, but without much sweetness, the hops become too powerful for my tastes."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass, bottled on date of Sep 30, 2011. This pours a golden color with a nice off white held which leaves a nice lacing. The smells are of hops, citrus, pine, grassy with a little caramel malts. The feels are medium with a nice mouth coating hop bitterness. The taste is great a mouthful of bitter hops the same taste as the smells, great stuff."
""
""
""

"A nice pale ale, but a little over the top on the hop bitterness. Compared to a Sierra Nevada or Dale's Pale Ale, this one has more of bitter bite. Now that's a personal preference, but I prefer something more balanced and less jarring. So I'll stick with Sierra and Dale's for this beer style."

"3.5 D: I used the word ""moderate"" a lot in this review and it's only fair to call this beer ""moderate"" overall. Nothing really stands out, but it is still a solid brew."

"O - A damn fine APA one of the better ones Ive tried if not the best. Excellent."
"O: A pretty good APA, one of the best I've had."
"O-The beer has an awesome appearance. The aroma is pretty mellow, but the taste is solid. Occasionally can come off watery or weak-ish on drinks, but I think that contributes to the beer's drinkability."
"O - another great example of a fresh hopped ale by great divide... Always a pleasure to drink"
"This is a wonderful after work beer, which is when I'm enjoying it. Very much recommended and you can be very sure I'll be buying this one again."
"The Accidental Highway to Hell Tour continues! This stop pours a clear straw-amber topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises pine, lemon zest, light caramel, light biscuit, and grass. The taste brings in more of the same, but with more biscuit and some light celery (or some form of cellulose, anyway) in the back. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a smooth feel, and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a solid, if not wholly distinctive, fresh hop brew. Good times."
"Overall: Overall. Its a good pale ale, and the wet hopping is a tasty, aromatic touch. Its a bit too bitter and unbalanced to get higher scores."
"O- this is a really good beer. i would highly recommend this to anyone who likes hops. this is only the second fresh hop beer i have had and they have both been very good. this one might be the better of the two."
"Another winner from Great Divide, and a definite 'must-try' for every hop head. Highly recommended."
"A great beer. I could drink this all day during the fall. Gotta love fresh hop season!"
"I might have preferred a bit more sweetness for balance, but after spending most of the last six weeks ODing on marzen, this beer is pretty damn close to what I was looking for. It's a great representation of the fresh hop style."
"D - easy drinking."
"O: I guess because Founders Harvest Ale is an IPA, I should expect it to be a bit more hoppy than this, but overall I liked Founders better. More hops, tastier, and more drinkable. This was good, but not great."
"Medium body, well carbonated, sticky and oily on the tongue. I'm a huge fan of wet hopped beers, and Great Divide's is one of my favorites. Excellent."
"This is a light, hoppy beer. This was a great experience. Thank you to Great Divide for making it."
"Eh not one of my favorites. The grassy fresh hops overpowers most subtle flavors and it ends up kind of one note."
"Poured with a hearty finger of billowy foam sitting atop a gloriously golden-amber straw colored beer. There’s a splendid hoppy aroma that’s at once delicate yet pronounced. Some pine. Wonderful, wonderful flavor. Light, sweet, piney finish. Resiny, but just a touch. Delicious."
"O - This really was fantastic in my opinion, light and crisp with fresh hops and a great balance, new favorite pale ale."
"This one pours a light bodied bright copper in color with a one finger, soapy white head. The aromas are very fresh and ""green"". You get a lot of grass, floral notes, steamed leafy greens, slight pine, and some caramel malts. The flavors are very light and clean. You get a moderate amount of fresh hops with a nice malt backbone and slightly bitter finish. Again it's kind of an earthy hoppiness. The lighter body does this one some favors and make it more and more drinkable. Overall this is a very nice fresh hop pale and definitely worth trying."
"O-Real nice Fresh Hop ale that I've passed over numerous times because of freshness issues.I was very pleased to find a fresh one.Didn't disappoint."
"Taste is very nice. Grapefruit is the dominant flavor with lots of malty balance. Hops are very nicely represented. You could tell me this is an IPA and I wouldn't argue. Very crisp and light. Perfect carbonation. The hops linger long after you finish. Just lovely."
"Overall a really good beer. There are other fresh hop beers I've liked more, but this one is solid and very drinkable."
"Pours a beautiful golden amber colored into the glass with a nice fluffy white head, left some great lacing on the glass. The smell is to die for, it probably has to do with the fresh wet hops that they use but its aromoa is extremely grassy with a ripe great fruit scent that almost makes you think you are about to drink an IPA. The taste is equally as enjoyable as the smell. Very fresh taste, crisp taste, great hop to malt balance. Leaves a nice hop coating on the palate, I had a hard time convensing myself that this is a pale ale not an IPA. Great beer for hop heads, to put it in a nut shell if you could take the breaking of fresh celery stalks and put a flavor and feel to that sound that is what this beer is. I wish it was a year round brew but I guess I will just have to stock up on it."
"O: Delicious. I really enjoyed it. Highly recommended. I will definitely have again...maybe tonight."
"Overall, an excellent beer that I highly recommend especially if you can get fresh. I missed this one the last couple seasons so was very excited when I was able to get a couple this year. Really loved the aroma and taste on this one. Very smooth. Avail here in TX - limited release seasonal. Rotation - got one more that I'll drink while super fresh and see if I can get on-tap this weekend. Definitely going to seek several bottles each year. [H;Y]"
"Pours a hazy bright orange with a good two fingers of off white head. Boom! Aroma is pure hops. I homebrew and it smells exactly like when you open a bag of whole leaf hops. Really grassy (but in a fresh, complex, vegetal, lightly green way, not in a bad old musty hops way). A little bit of hop citrus on the nose but it is definitely 80% grassy notes. Taste is more of the same. The bitterness is really quite mild as compared to the strong hop flavor. The flavor of the hops really opens up on the palate and I started to get more herbal (mint, chives...) flavors. Malt is present but only as a stage for the hops. Mouthfeel was smooth but nothing amazing. Overall this beer accentuates the fresh hop flavors and gives you something a little different than your basic APA, but not quite the strong bitterness of an IPA. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Clear medium amber with a small even white head. Aroma dominated by grass and citrus pith. Not unpleasant, but not quite what I was expecting. Taste is biscuity malt and grassy hops. Very earthy overall, unlike the citrus heavy California IPAs. Easy-drinking, dangerous with the ABV. Not the best wet hop ale I've had, but one to revisit."
"one of the better fresh hop pales i've had this year. pours a sappy golden color with a lively head. nose is awesome, fresh west drippy oily hops all the way, but not bitter or sharp at all. taste is more balanced up front than anticipated, with a medium body and moderate carbonation. the hop kick comes late, and it just slips in and out, crafty and patient, but a measure less than subtle. delicious brew, perfect out back after a good raking of the yard!"
"O/D-I was expecting this to be good, but I am surprised by how much I like this. I love the hop profile here. Oh so drinkable. Smooth and flavorful. I would like to say that I wish this beer was year-round. But I prefer it once a year because now I have a hoppy Fall offering to really look forward too."
"The beer pours a clear orange color with a decent-sized white head. The aroma is full of papaya, orange and orange, with some biscuit malt. The tropical fruit hop aroma is very fresh and dominates the smell. Very nice. The flavor also features a lot of tropical fruit. I get some nice pineapple and papaya notes, with a low amount of bitterness. The biscuit malt is also present, but it takes a back seat to the fresh hops. The alcohol is very well hidden. Medium, soft mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation."
"M: Light-to-medium body that has excellent carbonation and a very clean mouthfeel"
"O: A great beer. Not near the likes of Zombie Dust. But definitely tasty."
"O - A very nice pale ale, with an extra flavor spike you'd expect from fresh hopping. Nicely drinkable at 6.1%"
"Gorgeous beer, eminently drinkable and extremely refreshing. Even for 6.1%, it's an amazingly sessionable beer. So clean, so light and just so damn good. One of the best APAs I've ever had."
"A very nice AIPA overall, although it seemed a bit metallic at the finish, I would write this off to the fact that the bottle was just over a year old (did not notice when purchased)."
"A minimal amount of foamy head on top of a pale copper body. Aroma hits you with a large amount of hops. Lemon/Lime citrus, grapefruit and honeydew melon. Some malts are also present but this is all hop. Before I go on about hops the pale, subtly sweet caramel, malt bill is a great base for the hops that go over it. With that as a base there is a great mix of hop flavors. Juicy grapefruit, pineapple and melon upfront. The finish is a mix of pine and grass but the lingering bitterness is fruity. Awesome balance of juicy and bitter. Medium/light body, hop bomb but not bitter bomb. Very drinkable."
"O: Very good beer. Definitely recommend this one."
"Price = ?"
"Clear, amber with white head. Smells good, just a very mild hop smell. Soft but very present bitterness. Highly drinkable beer. Maltiness is sort of lost. Considering the IBUs and overall hop presence, this is pretty much an mild American IPA. Luckily I love IPAs. I was surprised to read the ABV, I assumed much less. Pretty good beer, kind of expensive."
" Not a bad offering, though I don't know that I would consider this one of the very best in style. It's refreshing though, and drinks well despite that lack of real malt balance."
"Drinkability - The feel in the cheeks really made this for me. I really like this brewery but this was one of their lesser offerings. It was good but not great."
"Fairly robust and nicely balanced, this has great flavor and very complex for a pale ale. Certainly not a backyard chug-a-bunch but a wonderful sipper and probably ideal for pairing."
"Drinkability: Here is a bottled on date of October 14, 2010. Now four months later, I Probably should have skipped it. Almost certainly would be better ""Fresh"". Will look for it in the future, fresher."
"If it is still on their shelves on my next visit, I am going to bring this to their attention. This travesty is on their distro, not them."
"Worth drinking!"
"Well-balanced pale ale; would love to try this one again fresh."
"As I said, I like Fresh Hop, but I'm not thrilled by it, nor do I think it is a great representation of a fresh hop pale ale."
"I had this on-tap at ChurchKey in DC. It had an amber colour with a decent head that maintained some lacing. The smell was lovely - mostly citrus and hops obviously - and was the highlight of drinking this. The taste was of citrus, mostly oranges, and was not particularly bitter. The aftertaste was smooth. This was a fairly simple but delicious brew."
"drinkability is so so - the overall musty mothball taste kills this for me but others might enjoy"
"D- this is a seriously hoppy pale ale, even in mid january. im going to look for this one as soon as it comes out again this year. i bet its intense."
"This beer started out almost a bit too bitter for my taste, but soon mellowed out as my taste buds were surrounded and beaten into submission."
"Simplistic, but the IBUs are there. Not as fresh-tasting a fresh hop ale as some of the SN Harvests, though. Looking at some of the other glowing reviews, I wonder if this has suffered through shipping and storage..."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is a very tasty fresh hop ale, would love to try this one on tap."
"D - Best fresh hop ale I have had this season and a great ale overall. The body really surprised me, to have the bitterness biting at the tongue with the softness of the beer really created a perfect experience."
"M - light to medium body; slight chew. Medium carbonation."
"Burnt orange body with one finger head of off white. Lace is splotchy and very clingy to the glass. Color is a bit hazy and matches a 9 on the SRM Beer Color Chart. Smell of pine forest, lemon, orange, grapefruit, lime, and malt. Flavor is intense grapefruit, lime, orange peel, pine, sour dough bread, and malt. Good fullness in my mouth, like light cream and soda. Great American Pale Ale. What beer is all about. I will hunt down and buy some more of this great stuff."
"D - Smooth IPA drink; great with food pairings; citrus pale ale with nice flowery tones; I really liked this drink for being a very hoppy IPA, it really hit the spot and it was very easy to drink"
"D- a very fine offering that I enjoyed rather quickly"
"(D)- nice drinkable beer and i feel it is a descent beer from great divide. Honestly im not a huge fan of GD but i def think this is one of my favs."
"(D)- A decent pale ale, but far too much bitterness for the style."
"Enjoyed this very much, I can see more in the fridge in the near future."
"OVERALL: I first had this beer on tap at the Beer Temple in Amsterdam, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The bottled version was no different. This is a top notch, flavorful pale ale with lots of character. A bigger palate could help support the flavors a bit more, but nevertheless, this is certainly a great example of the style. Yet another one in the long line of winners from Great Divide. Worth checking out if you get the chance."
"This is a good brew. Kind of like a poor man's Surly Wet."
"Drinkability: They don't get any easier to put down than this."
" The Fresh Hop pale has a nice light toasted malt flavor w/ herbal lemony tinges and mild slight floral quality from the hops. The flavor is subtle with citrus bitterness and the gentle caramel malt provides a great backdrop to the wet hop goodness. The finish is semidry and keeps you coming back - the drinkability is very high, one of the best fresh or wet-hop beers out there. I was glad I got a taste, but the keg blew so no repeats. The bottle I had was good, but trying this on tap was great. This sample was incredibly fresh and tasty!"
"Def an easy drinking beer. Just a tad too expensive to drink regularly with so many choices out there."
"D - Very easy to drink. Nice Fresh balanced taste."
"Recommended"
"drinkability: might be the best fresh hop beer ive had. definitly up there"
"Pours a light orange color, clear, cap of soapy head, good retention and lacing. Scent contains a muted profile of piney hops, touch of grapefruit and biscuity malts. Taste slightly more aggressive then scent, leads with a mildly bitter bite from piney hops, faint kiss of grapefruit and a solidly sweet biscuity and nutty malt background. Lighter side of medium bodied, slightly undercarbonated. Decent Pale Ale that doesnt necessarily show what fresh hopping can do to a beer."
"D- I expected more. The bottle is only 6 weeks old, so it should still be ok...overall, disappointing, but still good"
"Perfect drinkability....very nice lacing as well"
"D: Overall I'd buy this occasionally if it were local, but there are plenty of west coast APA's that I'd probably rather drink. Good but not memorable."
"D: Very easy drinking, good hop character but well balanced."
"D: Sessionable and tasty, just nothing earth shattering."
"Drinkability, sure get me another no complaints!"
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. This seems to tiptoe the line between pale ale and IPA, but I think it manages to remain a pale ale. I really enjoyed this one. I highly recommend checking it out."
"D: Excellent beer. I'm glad I was able to sample a fresh bottle. This would certainly be amazing on draft."
"D: The beer is very drinkable because the bitterness is not overpowering in any way."
"d - A very drinkable, enjoyable APA. At 6.1% I felt I could drink a few of them, and I enjoyed the pine and citrus hops in the smell. Would order again."
"D - Pretty decent, especially if you're looking for a bitter experience with a moderate ABV."
"D: Really nice body, but the poor hops taste put a damper on this one for me."
"D: A decent mouthfeel and taste combination makes for a nice drinking beer. I was hoping for more of the malts to come through later as I drank to balance out the hops, but it never really made itself evident."
"Average pour gets you close to three fingers of creamy eggshell white, starts to dimple and turn wispy immediately, then holds on nicely once it's down to a thin coating across the surface, the lacing has super stickiness, you'd need to sponge it off. Solid light amber to orange rust color, above average brightness and clarity, minor yellowing at the glass bottom. The nose has some weight to it but, predictably enough, openly weaved with an airy freshness to the wet herbal, vegetal scents, the orange to grapefruit citrus might be the second strongest component, however, still mellow, the pine relaxed too, mild earthiness, no distinct malt scents, you almost make up the cocoa dust out of your imagination. Medium-bodied, fine prickle to the carbonation, makes for an active mouth presence, close to conjuring up mineral water feel and flavor. Pleasant orange, lemon, lime citrus, nothing unduly sweet as regards the peach, red apple, pear, pineapple fruit. More breadth to the cocoa, mocha powder but, again, not more sweetness. Conversely, the hops are green and moist and pungent but not bitter in any meaningful way. Pepper, flowers, pine, earth all artfully arrayed throughout the palate. Classy, but its private school pedigree gives it an air of remove."
"Highly drinkable, especially given its low ABV."
"Beer is piny in the mid palate, midly sweet on the onset but that is not distracting from the moderate bitterness at the back. Its well put together with good palate connectivity. The finish is nice. Overall its a medium bodied APA with a wet finish. The hop resin stays in your mouth for a minute but there's no after taste. Its a nice hot day beer."
"Awesome brew from Great Divide... Never been that blown away by their hoppy stuff but this beer is special..."
"D - I have developed a real liking for fresh-hopped ales and this one does not disappoint. Very drinkable and at 6.1 abv, not too strong to enjoy drinking more than one or two in an evening. A very nice beer."
"Quite drinkable, I'd love to have this on tap."
"Good but nothing exceptional given the flavor/ABV ratio."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Overall: I have been really disappointed with these so called fresh hop ales that are sooo prevalent today. This delivered exactly what I was looking for in a fresh hop ale....actual Hops!"
"D - One of these was enough for me. It seemed to be a little bit old. I think I might revisit this one down the line when I know I can guarantee the freshness."
"DB- Fresh Hop is one way to describe this. It is nice to have a reminder once in a while of how damn flavorful hops can be. I really love the malt finish that keeps it from being just another IPA ""APA""."
"EDIT: I'm bumping the score of the appearance up a notch (from 3.5 to 4.0) due to the packaging. This is a good looking bottle and the green foil is a great touch."
"The transition from hoppy to malty on the finish is pretty awesome, an interesting well-balanced pale ale."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, citrus hops and mango like hints. In the taste, fresh hops, a small citrus note, pineapple to to pine, with a nice malt backing. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry pineapple and fresh hop aftertaste. Nice hop presence and easy to drink, dig it!"
"Pours a moderate copper color with a single-finger white head after a fairly hard pour. A bit of lacing remains on the edges of the glass; mostly spotty. Nose is light floral and citrus hops with a bit of earth. Light caramel malt. The taste is mildly hoppy with a bit of green character and some floral hops. Slightly bitter mouthfeel and a bit dry. Good drinkability and a pretty nice beer."
"D - Expecting more for the price. A nice drinkable beer, and just about right for an APA. Would not seek out multiple bottles of this one."
"Drinkability: Sessionable."
"Overall impression: A fresh hop ale definitely worth seeking out."
"D: Not a standout in the wet hop beers by any means. While not a bad beer, when I can get the world class Hop Trip and High Tide or even Sierra Nevada Harvest Ale for a dollar or more less, I'm always going to go there in the future."
"D- Fairly easy to drink just not what I was wanting out this one."
"Fresh hop beers are the ""new rage"" and this is easily in my top 3 favorites!"
"The body was thinner than I enjoy for the style. Drinkability was decent, but being somewhat one-dimensional, became boring. Overall, a decent beer, although mostly it's a hop delivery system. Worth a try for most beer lovers, a must try for hop heads."
"D - Though I really can't knock this beer for its flavor, I wouldn't recommend it to those who have earned their 'big boy pants'."
"D: I will look forward to imbibing this fresh every year. This particular beer was bottled on October 4, 2010 and I count myself fortunate to have it at its peak of freshness. Chalk up another winner for Great Divide."
"Overall this beer has nice balance which makes it extremely drinkable and enjoyable. I could drink this all day; lesser hop character than most wet hop ales which I can appreciate as a change of pace from the hop bombs of today."
"Future outlook: A winner of an APA, will be happy to have again."
"It's clear auburn in the glass with a 3/4 collar with great retention. Top notes of basil and white flowers and sensimilla. The flavors are hop dominate at first with citrus and spice then structured nicely with a solid malt bill. medium weight with a remarkable 'freshness'. light bitterness, but I don't ever really expect wet hop beers to be too bitter. Long finish and the malts don't get sweet on you at the end which I love about this beer. All I can say is get it. NOW."
"D: This beer provides a response to the question, 'Is proximity to hops a factor in producing a wet-hopped ale of quality?' What it lacks in interesting qualities, it makes up for with an overall appeal that equates to better than average drinkability. Still, for a fresh-hop seasonal it is mid-pack at best. It leaves me with a very similar impression to the riptide that I had at Pizza Port a few weeks earlier."
"D= A great hop forward APA pushing the IPA boundary. Smooth and drinkable with a little complexity keeping you coming back for more. A fine wet hop beer."
"Midwest but have continued my Boise based fresh-hopped adventure. On tap at the wonderfully moody Black Sparrow."
"Poured from tap into pint glass. Enjoyed this after a 12 hour shift. Poured a dark orange color. alittle haze to it but not much. The smell had a little more ripe fruit smell then a dry hopped IPA. Flavor was super well balanced with a hops and ripe tangerine. I was very impressed with this beer. One of my favorite offerings from great divide. Would have had about 3 more but I was too tired."
"I'm certain to get my hop fix here. Exceptional."
"Yet another great beer from Great Divide. Check this out if you love hops."
"Mouthfeel; is well nice perfect. Light, fluffy, it makes the most of the flavors presented by the beer. Insanely drinkable."
"Drinkability: Comes across as a fairly typical APA that is somewhat elevated by how fresh it is. Very good, but not one of my favorite Wet/Fresh Hops."
"pours light amber with one finger head. some lacing. smell is faint earthy, citrus. 55 IBU but real smooth. taste is well ballanced grapefruit, citrus and earthy tones. lite creamy maltyness with crisp finish. finish is a little oily from the hops but welcoming. very drinkable 6.1%ABV well done pale ale. bottled on Oct 4,2010 drank on Oct 20,2010 . Pairs fantastic with a wide range of foods."
"Fresh indeed - my bottled date was just a couple of weeks earlier. Nice hops profile, both citic and wet-hops herbacious. Lively mouthfeel, this beer comes across as being quite a bit bigger in the ABV department, and I was surprised to see it is less than the 7% or more I would have expected. A very nice example of how to handle fresh hops for maxiumu flavor."
"Pours a clear reddish amber, bordering on coppery, with a fine-bubbled, barely off white head. Richly hoppy aroma has grapefruit and spicy hints. Flavor is quite hoppy but not at all bitter, with hints of evergreen and sour orange. Smooth yet lively and fizzy texture leaves behind a nice tingle."
"Overall a really tasty beer. Bottled October 4th and consumed the 16 so I can't really find a fresher beer. At 6.99 this is just way too freaking expensive though. A 22 dollar 6 pack and lets not forget sierra makes a better fresh harvest for $4 for 24oz. Goose island makes a 6 pack for something like 8 bucks that's again better than this."
"A nice smooth drinkable beer. Great flavor and smooth mouthfeel."
"Pours a bright, crystal clear bronze, with a large, foamy, white head. Good retention and lots of sudsy lacing left behind. As one would have guessed smell is tons of hops. Grassy and citrusy just as the label promised. Taste has a ton of hop flavor with surprisingly little bitterness. Citrus and floral hops with a touch of sweetness and a faint malty backbone that provides some balance. Flavor is weird (in a very good way) in the sense that it has the flavor of a major hop bomb but doesn't have that tounge smacking bitterness you would expect. Medium bodied with a nice crisp finish. This is my first experienced with a wet hopped beer and I am pretty disappointed that it is over. Loved this beer and I think I've found another yearly release to look forward to."
"D: Highly drinkable and enjoyable."
"Great Divide Brewing Company--Fresh Hop Pale Ale--Grassy--Citrusy--2010. 6.10% ABV. 55 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Lacy dense lasting thick white head. Fizzy clear bright ripe peach amber color. Delicate grassy citrus floral fresh hop front. Mildly textured slightly creamy mellow sweet soft doughy caramel soft hop resin flavored palette. Smooth mild citrus hop spice end. Sampled 10/29/2010 from 22 oz. bottle purchased for $9.99 @ The Greenwood Market, Seattle on 10/20/2010."
"The taste is more of the same, but very crisp, giving it huge scores in the mouthfeel department. Just a pleasure to drink, not overpowering and easy to enjoy."
"Great Divide Fresh Hop Pale Ale is a pretty clear light amber ale with a dense white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a very grassy aroma with notes of grain and flowers. It's pretty light bodied and quite slick. The finish is dry and clean. It has a perfectly balanced flavor with a biscuity malt tone and a grassy bitterness. It almost seems a touch sweet right before the finish. The grassy bitterness lingers for a little while. This is very smooth and refreshing. This bottle is nine months old, so I'd really like to try it fresh at some point."
"D: Extremely drinkable APA. Not the hoppiest I've had, but definitely one of the most well balanced and drinkable ones."
"I was very pleasantly surprised by this one. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I enjoyed this one very much."
"Dense amber brew, big eggshell head settles to a thick film and leaves awesome lacing. Lacing is interesting and very dynamic as the glass goes down- first sticky thin webs, then a thick even coat, then large sticky chunks. Smell is thick body of light malts, robust citrus rind, a bit of pine and grass, sticky sweet, maybe a hint of bubblegum. Taste is sweet orange rind, thin malt background, bit of semi-burnt caramel, bitter grass. Mouthfeel is crisp, very soft carbonation, body not as thick as it smells. Easy drinking. A little EtOH burn in the finish, but not offensive."
"Would definitely pick this one up again."
"Very well balanced with a strong malt backbone that compliments the citrus and earthy hop presence. This beer has a bitter hop bite up front which lingers over the sweet malt body into a dry finish. I usually do not prefer hoppy beers to have this much of a prominent malt character but I thought that it provided some nice balance and complexity in this beer."
"The Fresh Hop APA pours a golden color with a nice foamy 2 finger head. Plenty of lacing on the glass. Very nice looking pour. Aromas are mostly floral hops and a cut grass. A musky finish rounds out an average nose profile. Taste is mildly bitter with plenty of sweetness up front that contains citrus fruits. Mouthfeel is light bodied with good carbonation. This is a very easy drinking APA that has a good, not great flavor."
"Pours a nice medium orange color, capped off with some generous white foam. Nosing this one, based on past experiences with this style, I was expecting nothing but huge hoppy aromas; not the case here. I got some light grassiness, citrus and a touch of pine. On the palate a little bit of caramel and sweet biscuit malt, along with lemon zest and grapefruit. A decent effort, but not even close to the hoppiness I was expecting."
"Drinkability: I had the entire 650ml bottle, but that was plenty. I think a regular 12 oz bottle or 16 oz pint at a bar would be a great beer to start the evening or a single serving if you're looking for that to accompany a meal.I wouldn't be pounding down a lot of these."
"D: Not quite sessionable, but I probably could have finished the bomber myself and been content. The fresh taste from this beer would be good for another 11 ounces."
"pours a golden orange color with limited amount of head. very pine like hoppy smell as well as taste. i must say i was not really very impressed with this beer. everything about it was good, but i just didn't find anything about it that was great or extra ordinary. don't get me wrong it was a good, very easy to drink beer that had good flavor. but to me it was just mediocre."
"Very drinkable. Fresh, hoppy, and refreshing."
"Overall- for not being an american pale ale fan this one is pretty damn good. a good choice for a step into the more hoppier ipa's. hop bite isn't to bad. it just shows up slightly in the end."
"Note- Best enjoyed fresh. This and all Fresh/Wet hop beers fade fast and this one is no exception, while still very drinkable the bottle I am now consuming is a ghost of what it once was."
"In all a good bitter ale."
"D. Highly drinkable. This would be pretty close to my definition of what an APA should be. I like pale ales with a kick of hops, but not so much that it borders on an IPA. Damn good Pale Ale."
"D: As a usual IPA drinker I can appreciate the punch of hops in this pale ale. Good for a hop fix when you don't want the 6-9%ABV of an IPA."
"The taste has a great amber male that stays around for awhile. Only as the beer reaches the back of the palette does the hop presence appear. The aftertaste is definitely astringent and dry but is balanced my the lingering malt. There is also this interesting earthy, garden like taste, like the lingering of a bite of fresh vegetable soup. Carbonation is nice and full. The beer is medium bodied and stays on the pallet; very smooth. It's been awhile since I'v had a pale ale that didn't have India in front of it. Love the restraint Great Divide had in this. Is a perfect example of an American Pale Ale."
"D - The medicinal bitterness detracts from the drinkability of this one. This is about 4 months old, so maybe some of the fresh hop goodness has left this one. Not a bad beer, but one bomber is plenty. It's going down without any problem...I just wish it was a little bit smoother on the hop character."
"The mouthfeel is outstanding -- pleasantly carbonated with some body to match. At 6.1%, it's eminently drinkable."
"D - Good drinking stuff. The hop flavors are noticable but they aren't overwhelming. Overall the beer is decently balanced and a pretty good showcase for hops."
"If there was one thing I could add to this site, it would be a sixth category, ""value"". This beer, which I bought on closeout for $4 a bomber, was definitely worth its asking price and demonstrated more of a $6 beer quality, however, its retail price of $9 is simply excessive and this beer is not worth that much, simply put. My experience with this beer and their Hercules IPA is that Great Divide makes beers that are marginally better than the competition and charges an arm and a leg for the result. I would not buy this beer at full price, however, I will go back to the store tomorrow and buy more at the sale price!"
"Great Divide, great job as always."
"d - good beer, hop heads will be pleased."
"The beer shocked with a strong dose of hops. The refreshingly bitter taste is excellent. The beer is medium bodied, and has a complex flavoring to it. Very drinkable beer. Good for both summer/winter times. Outstanding product."
"D: Fresh an refreshing. There is a cleanliness to this brew that you don't see everyday. Every once in a while, it's nice to take a break from the bigger beers out there and mellow out with the likes of an easy drinker like this."
"D: A nice APA with a little of everything nice. The fresh hops sure makes a good impression. I like the size of the bottle; 650 ml - a lot of liquid to enjoy!"
"D: Goes down smooth and easy. Very enjoyable but it was missing that ""it"" quality to make it great"
"Great drinker, especially for hops. If hops aren't your thing, then stay away."
"Golden yellow and clear with copious carbonation and a thick and lasting white head. Lots and lots of lace. Piney hop aroma. Hops in the middle and noticeable bitterness. A bit of honey sweetness to compete with the hops. More IPA than APA. Crisp dryness and light mouthfeel, making it very drinkable."
"An unbalanced and tired APA, perhaps not as fresh as the name implies."
"D: High price tag but probably worth it because of the dedication to quality that Great Divide always devotes to its brews. I'm glad I tried it because it is excellent, but I would still probably buy an Arrogant Bastard if they were the only brews left on the shelf."
"This is a pretty solid fresh hop ale, although the hop profile is not my favorite and the flavors were almost too subtle. Still a tasty brew though."
"D: Very smooth. Lighter than I'd expected."
"Fresh Hop Pale Ale would make a great girlfriend: it looks nice, it smells nice, all its parts are well proportioned and it's incredibly easy to get along with. The only problem would be that, given the nature of the beer and the fact that only freshly-harvested hops are used, you'd really only get to see her once a year. Hmm, perhaps then she'd make a better affair!?"
"Medium in body, with a very smooth mouthfeel. Definitely an easy drinking big hoppy beer."
"D - Very drinkable stable ABV."
"D: Overall, this beer is very easy to drink. Great on it's own, but would be great with spicy dishes, fish, or even wild game birds."
"Drinkability rates pretty good. This beer is a palate crusher and very hop-forward. More like an IPA than an APA."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer Raleigh on Dec. 3 served in a standard pint glass and reviewed from notes. The beer was served a crisp orange with a decent eggshell head. The aroma was an abundance of citrus hops. The taste was a nice citrus hop presence in front of sweet malts. The beer was quite crisp and refreshing. This is a very enjoyable beer, it's too bad it can't be produced year round."
"overall a lot more bitter than i would expect of a pale ale."
"Good offering"
"Beautiful pale amber colour with a thick white head that hardly subsides and leaves very impressive lace. A subtle but promising nose with plenty of grapefruit and hay. By this point you know there's going to be a heavy hop profile. Slightly malty up front with a dry, bitter finish. Very little carbonation and so a bit thin as far as mouthfeel is concerned, but a very nice beer all the same. I'll buy a few more bottles of this for sure."
"I liked this about the same as the bottle but it was more fun to have a ""fresh hop"" beer on draft. Surprisingly dark for a pale ale but the flavor is not overwhelming and the hop character is about the way it should be for an american pale. This is a very easy beer to drink and i'll have it as long as it's available."
"I had this one a year ago on tap in Phoenix and really enjoyed it. The bottled version was just as good."
"Ultimately, this beer drinks like an APA from a random brewpub. I wasn't impressed at all, though this is fine enough."
"Not my favorite style, could be more accessible once the bitterness fades. Despite that, drinkability is good, making this a good candidate for a summer session ale."
"Pours a clear reddish amber with a small tan head. Smells strongly of freshly cut grass. Taste is malty sweet up front, with a earthy grassy bitterness in the middle, and a hint of citrus in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, low carbonation. Drinkability is great, a refreshing pale ale with a pleasant hop character."
"D: Very nice fresh hop pale ale. I really enjoyed this beer and wish I purchased more than the (2) bombers. This was a very nice interpretation of the emerging fresh hop ale beer style which means that the hops are freshly picked and thrown into the kettle without any kiln drying providing a very robust earthy hop flavor compared to traditional hopped beers that use dry hops."
"D - I really enjoyed this brew a lot. Full of great fresh hop flavors. A relatively aggressive and delicious take on the pale ale."
"Poured an amber color with a large white foamy head. Lots of grass and grapefruit in the aroma. Taste is also dominated by the grassy and citrus flavors of the hops with some pine coming through as well. The malt is there but the hops are clearly the star of the show. It wasn't bad by any means but I didn't enjoy this one as much as some of the other Fresh hop & IPA's I had this weekend. It had too much of the grassy flavor for me."
"A beautifully brassy pour into a pint glass with a slight white cap. The carbonation is average. The orange peel and piney notes are arranged nicely. The smooth and clean hop flavors linger nicely on the pallet. This APA is not too big, but more of a mellow representation of the style, nicely backed up with mellow tactile attributes. The aromas are complimentary of the hop flavors and in turn are complimented by the stickiness of the mouthfeel. This example of AIPA is a great winter warmer or summer refresher."
"D- Not a terribly heavy beer, but slightly unrelenting in the hop department, which lowers the drinkability a little, but not much."
"A almost dry finish, medium body. Really easy to drink!"
"D - This is truly a fantastic American pale and perhaps one of my most recent favorite discoveries. I've always like APAs, but until recently they haven't held much interest for me. This one certainly got my attention. The hop flavors and aroma are vibrant and wonderful - a must try if you can."
"Overall - Disappointing by this one. Labeling it an IPA would probably score it higher marks, although then it would have faults as an IPA. It's refreshing and is just what I need at the moment, bu they have much better beers."
"D: Of the fresh hops I have enjoyed this season it is by far one of the most drinkable. The hops don't tear apart your palette, but dominate a large portion of the flavor profile."
"Standing alone this is one 22oz bomber that could be consumed in pairs. Clearly worth the price."
"D - Not that good. Too piney, not a great beer from Great Divide. Very disappointed by this one."
"I prefer the Sierra Nevada Harvest Wet Hop Ale to the Fresh Hop. However, it's a very enjoyable example of a full-flavored pale ale."
"The taste is really nice and has a nice grainy sweetness that is complemented by grassy hops. The hops are not overpowering at all and just really are a nice complement and balance to this beer."
"Drinkability is scored down a bit; a bit more pine hoppyness than I prefer, and a tad bit expensive without to much ""wow"" factor IMHO (@ $8 a 22oz bomber)"
"D: So incredibly smoooth and easy to drink. This beer is incredibly fresh and kudos to Great Divide for putting out a great beer that sticks to the style."
"D - There were a bunch of beers on tap otherwise I would have had a second pint. This one was very well balanced."
"Medium body, with an adequate amount of carbonation. Very enjoyable, and certainly a hop showcase here."
"saw the 22 0z bomber in my local and had to try this one did not see this one last year.. dated 092909.it poured a golden orange color with a 1"" head that settled to some fine sticky lacing..the smell was grass and citrus with hops and more hops ..the taste was pines with some grass and with citrus and spice the hops are delicious with a nice caramel finish..what makes this pale ale great is the use of wet fresh hops balanced perfectly with a malt finish this is an outstanding pale ale that taste like an ipa well balanced and highly drinkable"
"D - I expected a very hop foreword beer, and I was not disappointed. The hop aroma is very nice and fresh, but with a malt character that is more than an afterthought. The flavor is not quite as three-dimensional, with more of an emphasis on bitterness and a gin-like pine hop flavor that almost totally crushes the malt character. A good fresh hop beer, though it could easily tolerate more malt character (especially in the flavor) and perhaps a more varied hop profile with some floral or fruity additions to augment the pine and citrus."
"D- Great drinkability. Not too high ABV no overwhelming or palate stomping flavors. Really good beer this is, I highly recommend it but I do really love fresh hop beers."
"Pours a crystal clear darker amber with two finger fluffy white head, everlasting lacing. Smell: fresh cut grass, piney, spicy, and a hint of orange citrus. Taste: piney, grassy, spicy, acidic and sweet pineapple aftertaste, just enough balance from the sweetness of the pale malt, a touch of wheat tangyness. Mouthfeel: prickly carbonation, medium bodied and fluffy, juicy finish. Really nice hoppy pale ale. Enjoyed from bomber bottled 9/23/9."
"D - Unfortunately, I only had one bottle of this one, otherwise I could have downed plenty more. It was incredibly smooth and tasty."
"More muted all the way around for me. Maybe, more like 2013 than previous years."
"Notes: Nice wet-fresh hop brew. Nice how it balances being a hoppy pale ale, with a noticeable freshness without giving it a sense of a jump to an IPA, which would have been fine by me but would turn it into another beast. Instead, they have accomplishes an rather nice and balanced pale ale with a very nice touch to it."
"Yum!"
"D- A nearly perfect pale ale for lovers of balance and order in the beer matrix."
"D: Clean, crisp, and refreshing."
"My favorite wet-hopped beer I've tried to date. I pick up a bottle every year and it has yet to disappoint."
"Drinkability: Overall, it's an okay beer, but the flavor is very faint. I was hoping for a slightly more hoppy flavor."
"Overall, another great showing from Great Divide."
"Overall a very good APA but not one of my favorites. Not my prefered hop profile and a little pricy."
"M/D - Finish is clean, and body and carbonation level are medium. Some lingering hop resins on the palate. Drinkability is high."
"D: Overall, this is a very nice APA. The hops add a lot of flavor without making the beer a hop bomb. A very nice effort from Great Divide."
"It is very hoppy on the tongue, malt and caramel cone to play as well. Mouthfeel has a hop sting and bitterness otherwise quite light. I like this beer it is what a pale should be."
"22oz. Poured a brilliant, transparent copper color with a huge rocky head - ivory in color - good retention and leaves a foam slick atop the ale once finally dissipated. Spotty lacing covers the glass all the way down. Aromas are bold - toasted grains, toffee, citrus, and caramel. Tastes are full of character and complexity consisting of biscuity malt, toffee, overtones of citric grapefruit, slight orange, fresh piny hop that slicks the palate wonderfully with hop resins. Finishes slightly bitter with pine and a hint of white pepper prickle on the tongue. Mouthfeel is thin-to-medium, but coats the palate well with low carbonation. Overall, this one grew on me - if it were a 12oz I don't think the additive effect of the hop bitterness would have jumped out at me the way it did during the 2nd half of the bottle. Excellent take on a fresh hop ale."
"Nice well balanced APA. Just enough hops to make it interesting."
"This beer poured a clear copper color witha one finger of thick rocky head to it, leaving ample lacing along the glass on the way down. Nose is of some pale malts, floral and piney hops. Taste is somewhat muted. For a pale ale, close to spot on, but with the Fresh hop billing, hop presence should have been more prevalent. Hops are indeed fresh upfront - floral and citrus goodness, and then the beer falls flat, somewhere in the middle the taste just drops and isn't balanced well. Medium to light bodied, medium carbonation, crisp clean feel to the beer."
"Transparent bright copper liquid with an ample amount of rocky ecru foam that hugs the pint. Nose is hyper-fresh hops, screaming into a crescendo of vibrant floral, pine, grass and citrus notes. Bright hop flavors of pine, apricot, pineapple, and grapefruit rind, attacks the tongue but a swift, sweet maltiness balances out the ale. Finishes fairly dry without being overly sweet or full on the palate. Forget your malt-bomb or pumpkin ale this Fall season, rejoice in this fresh lupulin lovefest."
"Low drinkability, this may be an old bottle. Unfortunately it's not dated. I'll hunt down another and edit this review."
"Drinkability: A nice treat! Paired well the Pinback tune ""Offline P.K."" and ""Soaked"". The beer presented a more than sturdy malt base and plenty of hop flavor and bitterness without the ponderous, heavy DIPA body and subsequent, downright bothersome alcohol content, which keeps this brew surprisingly drinkable. Of note, however, is the fact that though the Great Divide's Espresso Yeti and Saison I recently purchased had ""bottled on"" dates, the Fresh Hop Pale Ale is curiously missing it, though it is of the new label styling. Still though, it's one I cheerfully recommend."
"the bomber is a perfect size for this one. you know you'll want more than just one pint, but more than two might be overload!"
"D: Highly drinkable, Great Divide has yet to disappoint. Without a doubt I will be having this again."
"Drinkability - Pretty good. This is an excellent beer for hop heads. The flavor hits hard and lingers around a little. Then you want to take another sip to get that jolt again."
"This is not a classic beer. It is not a fancy beer. But it is strong enough to satisfy a hophead and mild enough to keep everyone else interested."
"One of my favorite Great Divide (session) beers. Easy drinking with a great amount of flavor."
"M/D - a little more earthy than i was expecting, but not bad. If you're expecting a nice juicy citrusy hop bomb, this isn't the way to go."
"It has a great foamy head that lasts. The color is a perfect amber. The aroma has plenty of hops and grains and a hint of citrus. The flavor is all hops. But it's not overpowering. Towards the back and in the finish is a bit of grapefruit. And around the edges is some sweet malt. Really a great balance between them all. None overpower. The hops are strong but not brash. It's not an overhopped double IPA. This is as great drinking beer. I thoroughly enjoy it."
"Drinkable as much as the style would permit. For some one who is building their hop tolerance, this beer would be a good step."
"pored a nice honey orange with a nice 2 finger head - leaves sheets of lacing all the way down the glass - good 'fresh hop' flavor - 'grassy and citrusy' is certainly right - nice and light feel for an ale with this much hop taste - goes down real easy - satisfying for me - very drinkable - i'd think this would be a good one for someone new to hoppier ales to try - good stuff."
"Ultimately, this is a really nice beer because it can be a lower alcohol percentage beer while still hanging on to a lot of the same hoppy characteristics of a double. And to be perfectly honest, it truly is better than a lot of the ""Imperial"" IPAs I've had from other breweries around the world."
"D - Because it doesn't finish too deeply, it is an excellent session beer."
"Pours an amber color, very clear fizzy. Frothy white head, not big but lasting. Very hoppy grapefruit aroma. A little smell of skunk. Some earthy aroma. Sweet grapefruily taste. Robust but not bitter, slight sweet aftertaste. Very tasty. A hoppy pale ale. Sweet mallty taste."
"This beer pours amber with a 2 fingered head, lots of lacing as well as some sediment. The smell is nutty and malty. The flavor has a wonderful malt base to it with that nice fresh hop flavor that I am beginning to recognize, certainly a nice balance between the two. The mouthfeel is ok with a slight dry aftertaste and a good carbonation level. This beer has nice drinkablility and I could drink many of these in one sitting :)"
"J"
"A golden amber color, with a half inch head that is light cream in color. It laces slowly and clings itself to the glass. Pine and citrus are dominant scent at the front, then the sweet scent of malt strikes the nose. Then it finishes with herbal spicy aroma. The malt is hearty and strong at the front, then the hops begin to grow in strength. The hop onslaught comes out with a strong grapefruit citrusiness, followed by earthy and pine flavors. Slightly watery at the front, gaining weight as it crosses the palate. It does finish with dryness on the back end. This is a strong pale ale, th e fresh hops are brought on strong and in your face. Throw this beer at something spicy, Thai, chinese, mexican or cajun."
"Big hops, no doubt about it, but I wonder if I'm tasting what everyone else is? Pungent is good, insanely bitter is good...just not sure about the animal/musk stink that prevails. I eventually found myself warming up to this strange element, although it keeps me from having a full-out love affair with this beer. I will seek out another bottle in the hopes it reveals something further. It's unique among hoppy beers and even wet-hopped beers, no doubt about that, and for that reason alone it should be tried at least once if you kneel at the altar of the almighty hop."
"Medium to light bodied and very, very drinkable. Refreshing, easy going, yet still flavorful."
"750 ml/$8.99/Wine Specialist"
"Thanks to Keith for sharing a bomber. Apparently this just landed in PA - in late January. Go figure. The hops in here seem a little weak for a fresh hop beer, but that's relative. There's still a rich, perfume of juicy citrus hops with an earthy, almost dirty undertone, like the hops maybe should have been washed. Either way, this was a pretty tasty beer."
"Overall a great pale. Like i said, a little boost in the sweetness of the malt profile could do wonders here IMO. But besides that, still a very desireable pale ale."
"Nice crips hop bitterness. A little too bitter for an APA. Lacks some of the sweet balance that this style is know for. Is there such a thing as an imperial APA? If so, this is it. Slight roasty flavor mixed in as well. I like this. Recommend."
"The flavor of this beer is unique and a little inappropriate for sessioning. 22oz of this is probably enough for the whole year actually. I great beer that has its place, but not one I will be coming back to soon."
"D - Solid drinkable brew that met my expectations."
"I really enjoyed this beer , although not a session beer , I could drink all night."
"Conclusion: Not bad, it's pretty tasty overall, but the hop flavor is surprisingly understated...I would have liked a little more."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly full bodied. Drinkability is great. More like a well balanced IPA than an APA."
"Good stuff. Very tasty and sessionable."
"D - Very drinkable. A light, crisp beverage that has enough flavor to keep me happy."
"Pours with a huge four finger head and sticky lace at the edges. It's a deep orange color, with plenty of visible carbonation and ok head retention. Slightly funky yeast aroma, malt sweetness, and a vague grassy quality. Not the fresh hop character I was hoping for. Sweet malty butterscotch taste, mildly bitter with some earthy, aspirin-like hops in the aftertaste. Creamy texture from mild carbonation, and sort of filling. One bomber is drinkable, but it's slightly too heavy for a session. Overall it reminded me more of SNPA than a wet-hopped ale, probably won't revisit unless it was fresh on tap..."
"On Tap at the Falling Rock. Pours orangish with nice head. Smells of hops and floral, a nice crispness to it. Was hoping since it is described on here as the Liberally Hopped made for the DNC it would taste more like it. Tasted citrusy, hoppy and clean but not like the Liberally Hopped at all. Overall a good beer though."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear copper/orange color with about an inch frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The aroma is mostly hoppy, like grassy and citrusy (orange peel and grapefruit) hops with a little bit of bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly grassy and citrusy hops with some caramel and bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium with decent carbonation, but seems a bit thin. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and has a clean finish. I think this is a good overall brew, not a bad choice at all."
"Very very drinkable. I could have a few bombers in an early night."
"D: Excellent drinkability. The project for Great Divide was to make a pale ale, not an IPA, and they superbly accomplished that goal. The body is medium, flavor is balanced (well, relatively anyway), and drinkability is high. My only regret is that I didn't buy more bombers of this stuff when I had the chance (though it is kind of expensive!). As far as comparisons go, this beer is more sessionable than Sierra Nevada's Harvest Ale this year. I love the wet hop beer experience, and I'm pleased that I finally got the opportunity to try a few of these beers."
"A three finger, bubbly tan head sprints to the rim as a hundreds of tiny bubbles make their way up through a pale ruby red colored brew. The head stays put for a while before slowly fading and leaving huge chunks and rings of lacing in its wake. Aroma has notes of fresh, bright citrusy hops up front with some candy sweetness, pine and grain following closely behind. The hops are noticed first on the palate, but are enveloped byby a malty sweetness, spice, orange peel and some lingering alcohol heat. The beer goes down fluid, and lies somewhere between medium and light-bodied. Carbonation is quite active. This is one of the best APA's I've tried."
"Pours a clear amber with a frothy off white head. Aroma is medium sweet with pine, grapefruit, caramel, orange and grass. Flavor is pine, grapefruit, light caramel, light herbal and citrus. Very dry and fruity finish. Light to medium body, light chewy texture. One of the better APA's I have had in some time."
"O'Briens Wet Hop Fest. Amber pour with a fairly large off-white head. Clean pine aroma with grass. Bitter, resiny taste, but without the stickiness. Malt, orange peel, vanilla, and oak all make up the background. A very refreshing APA that rivals good IPA's in taste."
"Fresh is definately the key to the beer. A complete joy to drink. Sessionable for any time of the year. Why is it rotational only? Thanks for sharing Gary, I wouldn't have done it."
"Drinkability- fair"
"Too hoppy for me to enjoy on a regular basis, but that's just personal taste preference. It's still an overall good hoppy brew."
"3.7/5"
"A great choice. Perfect beer to pair with cold pasta salad. A great brew to use to advocate. Hops are strong but not overpowering."
"Drinkability: A damn good beer, if I do say so. I just finished the Founders Harvest Ale, and this one just seems a little fuller, more rounded ... just a little better, and it may perhaps even rival the Sierra Nevada Harvest for the ""Best Wet Hopped Ale"" crown. Regardless, the 6.1% abv is low and well-hidden, the flavors and aromas impressive, the lacing and color amazing ... this would become a fall fridge mainstay ... if only Great Divide distributed to Virginia. Bollocks!"
"D - A fun and easy to drink beer but not as good as I'd hoped. It was a bit on the pricey side so I expected more but it didn't quite deliver in full."
"Balance is great. This beer is exceptionally drinkable. It's well crafted and well put together. It lacks the intangibles to make it world class, in my opinion."
"pours a clear copper (leaning more towards rusty orange) color with a decent off white head. nice lacing. the nose is dominent floral hops, subtle piney hops, faint grapefruit hops, subtle sweet malts, a touch of lemon. the taste of hops are subtle spicy, piney, lil bit of grapefruit, subtle sweet malts. medium bodied, low carbo, good Pale Ale..."
"The drink is crisp and medium-bodied with fine carbonation and a mildly sticky linger. This tasty seasonal is wonderfully drinkable, if a bit pricey here on the East Coast."
"Great pine aroma that was followed up in the mouthfeel by a ever so slight creaminess with hints of grapefruit backed by some caramel malt. I definitely am enjoying the fresh-hop ales this year but I wish I had gotten them a little earlier because even this seems like it would've been hoppier when it was a little fresher. Definitely drinkable- It would be nice to have 2 bombers of this in a night. I'll definitely be getting it again next year."
"This is a clean, bright hopped, pale ale and should not be overlooked. Very easy to drink, and extremely fresh."
"The body is moderate and balanced well. The carbonation is right on. Overall a very enjoyable seasonal beer. Great hop presence that isn't over the top. Some minor character flaws but very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with creamy carbonation that makes it really easy drinking."
"I would say that this is a pretty respectable beer, but as far as a harvest ale goes, it seems to lack a little something. it just doesnt smack of that certain freshness that characterizes so many of these beers."
"Pours a golden, straw color with a decent size whitish head. Nice looking beer. Aroma is wet hops and grain...a bit nutty as well. Flavor is mildly hoppy with a good malt backbone. Decent palate and almost sweet finish. Good brew."
"Overall probably the best pale ale I have ever had, but you must like hops. If you don't like hops, stay away...far away. Bravo GD, you continue to impress the hell out of me."
"I like this beer. I'm gonna go look for more..."
"Drinkability is pretty good, not my favorite Fresh Hop, something about the maltiness isn't really my taste, and I could use more depth from the hops, but I love how strong the flavor and aroma were, without being to acrid. As a 'pale ale', it's very good."
"Drinkable, sure, and tasty too, but not my favorite harvest or pale ale."
"D: my local brew pub brews makes what to my taste is the very best APA I have been able to get my hands on, not being as huge a fan of Great Divide I was not anticipating to be wowed by this beer, but what can I say, line them up. This is one tastey APA and a couple or three pints won't hurt, while seated."
"Bottle pours a light amber with a nice, fluffy couple inches of head. Very soapy lacing left on the side of the glass. Smell is hops, but less than I was expecting. There are more hops in the taste, but they are more 'watery' for the lack of a better term. The beer seems to have no edge to it. A very easy drinking and way too easy to finish beer. But not much more than that."
"Overall this is one of the better APA's I've had recently. Be sure to give this one a shot if you see it around."
"D: very drinkable APA, especially if you enjoy fresh hops. Well worth getting, but I would obviously recommend drinking it fresh."
"2008 version. 22oz. bomber served in a shaker pint glass. Poured a dark copper with a fine bubbled off white head. Big piney hop aroma. Pretty good initial hop blast. Decent malt base with a little sweetness. Smooth mouthfeel, not that mouth puckering dryness you get in some hoppy beer. Maybe a little one dimensional, but if you like hops that's a good dimension."
"From What I understand this is Great Divide's liberally hopped ale with whole fresh hops rather than pellets. My restaurant was lucky enough to get a few kegs of it during the DNC in Denver. I was pretty bummed out that LHA was a one time brew until Bryan from Great Divide dropped of a bomber of Fresh hop. I have a case on order, it won't last long."
"clear, deep amber color. thin head but very nice piney, citrus smell. I would like to know exactly what variety of hops are used but they are super strict on revealing recipes. A very drinkable pale ale from a very good brewery, all bias aside. Thinking about ""wet"" hops makes this beer very appealing and I was sad when my bomber was empty."
"["
"22oz bomber served cold in a pint glass. This pours a dark brown and has a nice tan head. The nose has a good amount of fresh bitter hops backed by sweet malts. Taste also has a good amount of fruity hops and rich malts. Medium body is well carbonated. Great session brew from Great Divide."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer. As I said, it shares qualities with the Denver Pale Ale, a beer I'm not that fond of. That being said, this beer is well done and has a solid taste to it."
"This is a really good beer. A murky darker shade of orange, not a big head but still some nice sticky lacing. Fruity hop aroma and potent for a Pale Ale. Grapefruit hoppy flavor, slightly sweet maltiness, which sneaks out more as it warms, bitter and a little dry. Nicely balanced. A lot of flavor and a lot of hops for a Pale Ale, which seems like it could be an IPA. Perhaps Great Divide put an IPA in a Pale Ale bottle so we'd be shocked at the flavor. Whatever, it worked, this might be the best Pale Ale I've ever had."
"beautiful golden amber with a nice sticky head and good retention. unbelievable lacing going on here. smell is equal parts piney hop and citrus hop with a little floral backing. bright and citrusy when it hits the tongue rounding out with some bitter hop coming in with a faint alcohol warmth. finishes with a little bitterness and some acidity. crisp and medium bodied, i feel like the malt is a little lacking here to combat some of the acidity and make it a little less harsh. drinkability is very good, but i might try something a little smoother."
"Goes down smooth, but I think I would tire of the flavor profile after a few."
"The feel is thick and creamy. It leaps off the tongue with mild carbonation. Overall it's a nice, well-balanced Imperial IPA. Quite good."
"I like this and would gladly enjoy another."
"Overall, a good Beer. However I would not pay $8.00 for another bottle, as I could find many similar tasting Beers for a more modest price... That said I would still reccommend trying it at least once."
"O/ M - Great fresh hop ale! Strong hops but balanced with malt. Nice bitterness for finish."
"D - unparalleled."
"Lots of pine and american hops ... no alcohol detected ... smooth as a new bowling ball... this is an IPA right?? no APA here ... it actually tastes fresh with a great bitter backbone...One of the nicer american pales available on the market today, just hope the quality doesn't get effected by the hop shortage.."
"D- pretty good, really liked it."
"D : Not one I would get again. It needs more balance to it"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours an amber color with a good head and alot of lacing along the glass. Smell is a sweet, citrus pine smell. Taste is very well balanced between the hops and the malts. Similar flavors to what are in the nose, including grapefruit/citrus, with a slight bitter aftertaste. Another solid brew from Great Divide."
"D: Overall a very well rounded and smooth drinkable pale and sets the standard by style."
"Drinkability: Damn! Last one I have! Hopefully more when I get back to the states!"
"Had this again April '07 and it was still tasty, but not nearly as aromatic and flavorful. I think the key is to pick it up within the first couple months it hits the shelves."
"Drinkability - this is a good ale, but it is rather subdued, and so I don't find it to be sessionable."
"Poured with a frosting-like head that never uite went away. Fairly clear and brown. Nose is hoppy but comes across as very evergreen and wet sod. Flavor is full of citrus and pine but leaning more to the grapefruit and lemons than Christmas. Malts are very subdued and overpowered by the hops. Medium mouthfeel with an oily texture from the hops that lingers surprisingly briefly."
"D: Solid, flavorful, enjoyable. 2 pints would be great! Yea for fresh hops!"
"Definitely recommended..."
"Pours a clear filtered amber with a fluffy off white medium lasting head. Smell is fresh, green wet hop aroma, slighty gritty malt sweetness as well in the nose. Unique, and somewhat restrained aroma, but very nice. Taste is awesome on the first sip! Incredibly smooth body, mild perfect bitterness matching with the sweetness of the malt throughout the entire progression of the beer in the mouth. Perfect mouthfeel, and great lacing on the glass. Almost a tingly spiciness to the hops that give it a lightly almost herbal earthiness. Easily one of my new favorite beers. Up there with FFF Alpha King in terms of overall favorite American Pales. I tore through the bomber of this wanting much more. I wish it were less than $7 a bomber, but I'll still be picking up another at that price."
"Plenty of gritty, citric hops here, as a dedicated hop head, this one does it for me and lives up to its name. Nice! Grapefruits surrounds the taste buds and continues to the long finish. Sweet malt present but just enough for a pass at balance, ha....hops carry the freight here. Nice offering from G.D.B.C. Go get some and enjoy"
"great beer, not sure what to consider this one, a stronger pale ale or an IPA, but this one was good, bought this beer in a 22 oz. serving bottle ina recent trip to belmont station in east portland, drank while brewing my own wheat beer on a monday night in mac oregon, good beer, great color, I thought with the name it would be more hoppy and bitter but it was actually more of a subtle taste."
"Pours a slightly hazy orangeish color topped with a standard 1/2 inch head. Decent lacing down the glass. Smells glorious, fresh, wet, piney hops. The taste is juicy piney hops all the way down, this is a pale ale? Minimal malt presence, but I'm not complaining. Aftertaste is of mellowing hops. ""I like!"""
"An APA with more than a slight hat-tip to an IPA. Clear yellow/orange with lots of bubbles, like carbonated apple juice. Nice off-white head. Nose is grassy cascade hops. Taste has a recognizable amount of malts up front, then citrusy grapefruit hops that linger. Good mouthfeel, quite bubbly. Drinkability is good too."
"Drinkability is fairly high as the flavors of this beer are not overwhelming. Just watch the 6.1% ABV."
"I recently bought the last that my local liquor store had in stock. This beer is great. I love the fresh floral taste that each bottle has. Overall I feel this is a great beer easily a top 10 in the North America Micro Breweries for a harvest time ""wet"" hopped ale. If you can find this beer I highly suggest trying it."
"A unique IPA experience. I'm not a huge IPA fan, but this might be my favorite."
"Not quite as good as Sierra Nevada's Harvest Ale, but still a tasty beer."
"I love the look of this beer, a creamy/rocky off white head on top of a slightly cloudy yellow-orange body. The head loooks really nice. The nose is grassy with a hint of alcohol. The nose isn't as pleasing as some other fresh hop beers I've had recently. The taste starts spicy, kind of piney and then there is a good biscuty malt flavor to hold up the spiciness. The finish is bitter and dry. The mouthfeel is a little too heavy for an APA if you stick to sytle but it needs to be that heavy to hold up the hops."
"D-A very well done fresh hop beer. One of the best I had in the 2007 season."
"The aroma was of piney hops and was beautiful. In the mouth I got the bitterness of the hop flavor with some citrus overtones. It was bitter up front on the mouthfeel, then sweet and then tart. Very unique for me. I really enjoyed their version and hope they have one next year all things being considered with the hop shortage and all."
"Taste is well balanced with lots of medicinal herbal notes, grapefruit bitterness, and floral honey sweetness. There's a decent amount of cracker malt here with a touch of caramel. Again, not overly complex but a very flavourful APA that definitely leans on the bitter, hoppy side. Medium-heavy body with mellow carbonation, maybe a little bit thick for the style, but nonetheless it's a really drinkable APA, full of flavour, bordering on an IPA in its hoppiness."
"Honestly, I have been enjoying this brewery's products since I found them in Virginia in the mid-90's. Now that I can get them here in Pennsyltucky, I can't wait to enjoy this one again."
"I could drink this all day long. It may not be my favorite IPA of all time, but it's mighty tasty. And at 6.10% ABV, it's not going to knock you out after just one. A session beer? Sure, if I could find it on tap, why not. And I'd love to find it on tap. Another outstanding effort from the gang at Great Divide."
"Would definitely buy again, and as my first fresh hopped beer I now want to homebrew with fresh hops! Gotta buy some Rhizomes!"
"I guess I am a little bit ""over"" IPA's. Recently, I have been finding them all a little monotonous. Fresh hop, double, imperial, to much of the characteristic profile is numbed down by irresponsible hop application. However, Fresh Hop, from Great Divide has enough nuts to break this cycle. Its' most outstanding characteristics are in its taste- nice cherry body, closed out by extremely well-placed hops. Drinkability at 6.1%, with appropriately placed hops, forget about it. For a mid-sized beer this is it!"
"Smooth creamy mouthfeel and sessionable drinkability(if it didn't cost $6 a bomber."
"2008 version: either the beer is better or my palate was off previously. lively head and sticky lacing. nose and taste similar as above with also some earthy/spiciness to the hops going on. nice moderate malt sweetness. medium bodied. really nice shit."
"Pours a clear light amber color with a full finger foamy off white head that fades slowly to a nice amount lacing. The smell of the initial pour is filled with the floral fresh hop smell that is balanced with a sweet malt aroma. The nose dampens out quickly to a toasted malt and slightly grassy sharpness. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is light-medium bodied. Full flavored, that toasted pale malt flavor finishes with an astringent grassy hop note that lingers appropriately. A really nice drinker. Recommended."
"Poured a double deuce into a Chimay chalice (2 pours). Aroma is grainy and of grass with the sweetness of the malt coming out at the tail end of the nose (rather surprised me). Taste is much mellower then I expected. There is a definite west coast hop presence with the citrus coming out. Just enough hops to leave a slight bitterness on the tongue. The malt backbone really comes out in this and it balances this beer very well. I was expecting a hop monster but was very pleasantly surprised. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slight oily texture and just enough carbonation. A very drinkable brew put out by Great Divide."
"Drinkability- This is a very easy to drink pale. I could have a session with this one pretty easily. Not my favourite from the 'harvest/wet hop' style, but still a formidable beer worth trying again if given the opportunity."
"Looks pretty solid: clear copper with a big frothy head that stands up in stiff mounds. Aroma pungently hoppy - very grassy and herbal with muted citrus and a faint background pine. Not much to say about the malt character - I guess that means it's supporting the hops well: neither overly dry nor sweet nor light or toasty, just giving the requisite beeriness to the brew overall. Hops are foremost in this, leaning more towards flavour and aroma rather than straight up bitterness (although it has enough of that as well). Herbal flavours dominate with some grapefruit pith and raw greens. Mouthfeel is middling, neither light nor heavy, and a moderate carbonation. Maybe a touch astringent though, with detracts a bit from otherwise quite good drinkability."
"Id definitely come back to Fresh Hop. Heres a certain recommendation. Great Divide scores another hit."
"Pours a clear amber with an off white head. Nose is reaching out to me even as I pour. Just getting it anywhere in the vicinity of my nose is giving me something. Upon close review, it is - surprise - very strong with the hops and that expected pine-like fragrance. Flavor is a strong, bitter hop influenced ride. A hopheads liquid paradise. Feel is thick from the high amount of hops and it holds a decent carbonation. Even though it is so pungent with the hops, it is still extremely drinkable."
"A pretty solid brew. I would prefer a cleaner ale without the diacetyl, something that reduces the drinkability and overall enjoyment for myself. With that said, however, this beer does a better job of showcasing the fresh hops than another fresh hopped pale ale, in my opinion. Recommended to fans of hoppy pale ales, and those who like their hops fresh and oily. I'll be looking for this again next year. May Mother Earth provide a bountiful harvest!"
"Mouthfeel - excellent. Smooth, silky, yet crisp to the taste. The hops was overtaken with citrusy, somewhat natural flavors that really engulf the palate. The hops taste quickly was alleviated with a smooth, aftertaste of the earth. Quite delightful! The overture of hops was not as obnoxious as one would expect based on the name, label, etc. The beer leaves you wanting to keep sipping heavily all day, just to keep getting that wonderful aftertaste. Definitely one to sip along through the days and nights. Enjoy!"
"This is a great sessionable and refreshing brew. Notes of bitter piney, citric hops. I can only hope they continue to make this style in spite of the hop shortage."
"Drinkable, though not a session brew. Something one could enjoy x 2 in one sitting then would likely seek to move on. Nice effort by a solid brewery."
"Drinkability - Good. I wouldnt seek it out again, but found it enjoyable. Worth a try. Cheers!"
"Pours a striking pale orange/amber color with huge fluffy white head, really nice; clarity is great, though I imagine lots of floaties towards the bottom of the bottle. Aromas are a nice blend of floral, sweet candies and a bright herbal tea. Last year I had this closer to the bottling date and it seemed fresher then, but nonetheless it is hopspectacular with some cinnamon like malt notes in the end. On the palate it hits with a medium body and lower than usual carbonation. For a super hopped beer, this one does have lots of amber and crystal malt balance. The hop flavor doesn't come across as fresh as other beers (Hazed and Infused, MoJo Risin'), but it does have a great herbal foothold that lingers long passed the just slightly sweet swallow. Overall, it's a great beer to look forward to every year from a great brewery, but one that needs to be drunk as soon as possible."
"A incredibly well-put together offering from Great Divide. I classify it as borderline IPA, but that's what it's all about. By pushing on a style that has limits, and breaking that boundary. I feel that as they nailed exactly what they were going for, and extreme APA - and by doing so, did it perfectly."
"D  I enjoyed this beer. For me, it was easy going It was nice to crack it open at the end of a seemingly never ending day of work. Will likely purchase again."
"Matted mouthfeel but with good carbonation that makes for a lighter texture Somewhat dry as well. Pleasurable, but not terribly complex or flavorful even for a wet hopped pale ale. A solid selection, but not as good as I expected."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and extremely smooth. Carbonation is excellent and abv is perfect. Very drinkable. Overall, it's a very nice offering from Great Divide. Recommended."
"Thick oily hop goodness. Full malty flavor layered with juicy hops. Smooth and well-balanced up front and midway brings in the resiny hop flavors and the citrus notes for the lingering bitter finish. One of the most consistent wet-hop brews I found this season, great in bottle and on tap. Wish it was more affordable!"
"Slightly less then super beer. It pours a nice golden amber color with a fluffy head that dissipates quickly leaving a lacy residue on the glass. It smells like a hoppy bread. Hmmmm hop bread? Sounds like I have some experimenting to do with me free time. The taste is a-ok. Its a light pale ale with a nice malty, hop start and a good long bitter finish. Its has slight citrus flavors that are layered under and through the hops. I like it. Its not punch you in the face hoppy but also not a wimpy beer. There is a good balance of flavors and smells to this brew."
"I would recommend this to only the most devoted of hop heads."
"Bottle purchased in Columbus for about $5. The appearance was brilliantly clear, pale copper, thick and frothy topper. The aroma is mostly hops, fresh and resiny. The taste is OK, a nice balanced pale ale base with a blast of fresh hops giving a bitter punch, tasty enough to keep my interest through the bottle. Overall this is not something I'd miss if I didn't see it again, but it's far from bad."
"Drinkability: Another excellent member of the Great Divide family. A good fresh hop brew that showcases different hop flavors with a good amount of bitterness."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin for my tastes, but not bad. Nicely carbonated, but not enough residual sugar to create a pleasant stickiness. I could drink a couple of these in a session perhaps, but in my opinion this would be much better paired with a meal. The thought of downing a bomber of this alongside a plate of blackened chicken czarina makes my heart melt."
"d: The fresh hop addition makes this APA more of an American IPA at least in terms of aroma and flavor. Hops aren't too bitter, alcohol isn't really noticeable, a good brew. I'll be looking forward to next year's batch."
"Crisp, clean Pale Ale stylings. Its beefy, but not loud. Hop maintains significant presence, but isnt overpowering. Hop bitterness grows to a quiet roar. Nice balance. Spot on, I say."
"Autumnal copper with golden edges. Frothy, cottony, eggshell white head with good lacing. Pine sap and citrus hop nose mixed butterscotch. Light hop bitterness up front. Sweet shortbread cookie and butterscotch malt come on strong. Light tropical fruitiness. Piny and herbal hop bitterness in the finish. Maltier than expected and the hops don't seem as ""fresh"" as other harvest ales. Still good, just not overwhelming. Medium body with a low carbonated, casky feel."
"D - Eh? Pretty run-of-the-mill offering. Again, I'd like to try a bottle with a freshness date to re-evaluate this brew."
"Pours a clear amber honey orange with a giant tan foamy head. The head lasts forever and leaves great lacing making this an outstanding looking beer. The smell is pungent with bread yeast,hops, carmel,and malt. The taste is very hoppy with citrus and pine flavors present,a creamy bread yeast flavor,and some malt. Not bad,but the hop bitterness is alittle much. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing well. A pretty good beer that's alot hoppier than can be believed."
"I would rate the drinkability higher if the fresh hop season was in the spring so that this would be a summer brew instead of a fall/winter release. That is obviously not something the brewer can control i know. I wish this came in 12 ounce size, as i think one at a time would have been enough for me, but again, i am not a hop head. Now that i have tried this one i am looking forward to trying the other fresh hopped offerings i have in my fridge."
"Good choice overall."
"This beer pours a golden amber with a slightly off white head. This head is rocky and frothy and laces well. The smell is full of fresh piney hops. The taste has bitterness along with those hops and notes of toasted caramel. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of dryness. Overall, fantastic Pale Ale or IPA whatever you really want to call it."
"Feels light in the mouth and is very easy to drink! I would reccomend this as a nice beer to drink while watching football on a saturday or sunday as I am doing right now!"
"D - a very smooth, very good drinking APA."
"Slick and sticky, this probably makes it for many hop heads, but Im not a big fan of the floral hops  still, I could sip on this beer for an hour or two. Relatively low alcohol almost makes this a session type brew."
"Great Divide's Fresh Hop Ale pours a medium turbid amber. The smell is moderate of hops, and the taste has an exceptionally smooth hop taste that makes for an outstanding mouthfeel. Overall, this is what I would like to see in all well hopped beers. A bold hop taste that is very smooth, and not over powering."
"A very one-dimensional beer. that being said, it was still enjoyable."
"Beautiful fresh hopped pale ale. The color is like polished copper, but i could've done with more lacing, but whatever. Love that it has so much flavor but almost void of sticky mouthfeel. Drinks so fresh and so clean clean. I would definitely reinvest in this beer soon."
"This beer poured a clear amber color with a thick white rocky head. The aroma is just like the name says  Fresh Hops! The taste is bitter with a big hop flavor. There is a slight touch of malt noticeable, but just enough to give a good framework in which the hops can shine. The finish is slightly dry. The mouthfeel is medium and about what one would expect. Overall, this is a flavorful brew that goes down easy."
"D- Very good example of the style and not over the top or too mild. I am impressed."
"The feel on the palate is a bit resinous but it cleans up nicely after a little bit. This is one of those brews that I find it difficult to not guzzle down as quickly as possible. I'd get this by the case if that was feasible but I imagine that this one doesn't age too gracefully. Everything delicious about this beer revolves around the fresh characters. With all this freshness going around, this is a refreshing beer. Get some if you can."
"D: Excellent hop head's PA. Another great offering from Great Divide. Definitely something to look forward to every year."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It looks great, the smell is nice but subtle, and the taste is all-around solid. There's just a bit of an odd drying/oily taste and feel that lingers in the mouth that keeps those respective ratings down. All in all, though, a very drinkable beer that is worth trying. I will look forward to this beer's release each fall."
"The appearance of this beer is almost picture perfect. A thick off-white head sitting on top of a golden body with amber highlights. Good head retention with some lace clinging to the sides. A nice whiff of citrus and floral aroma after the pour. A bitter grapefruit taste that lingers on the tongue for awhile. Not much maltiness, but it isn't lop-sided with hops either. Light to medium-bodied and a good beer over all."
"Pours a golden amber color with a nice dense egg-shell head that left some real nice lacing on the glass. The smell is strong and of grassy hops, quite nice. The taste is of grassy/floral and piney hops. Has a slighty citrus/fruity hop characteristic as well. The hops are very up front and center, not much of a malt presence. This borderlines on an IPA status. The feel is moderate and almost creamy, finishes with a piney bitter twang. So far one of the better fresh hop brews that I have had. The hops really stand out on this one. Chalk up another great brew from Great Divide."
"light ambery yellowish... (it was kind of dark, so that was what I remembered) nice white head and good lace. smelled nice special smelling malt and a real fresh hop taste. taste had that nice, oily, resiny hop taste. not overbearing and in your face, but clean and strong. harvest time always brings the funk. mouthfeel was nice and full without being too sticky on the palate. i need more."
"Something to try once and move along, pretty standard as the fresh hop brews go,especially at $6 bucks a pint. Ouch."
"Finally, the finish is very bitter, long lasting and dry, just as I would expect from this style. Very possibly the best APA Ive ever had."
"Great Divide hasn't disappointed me yet. This is a great seasonal, it is just too bad that hops are an annual plant, because this would be a great brew to have year-round."
"The beer is easy to partake of. I'm not sure its a session beer, but its damn tasty!"
"Dark straw, nose of grain and green hops. The flavor had a pleasant husky grain note that was the platform for leafy late addition hop character that did not overpower or underwhelm. A great rival to Sierra Nevada Harvest Ale. These beers are a little tricky in that they do not attempt to overpower, but infuse with oily resinous freshness."
"D - Very easy to drink. I would have followed it with another, but more than 2 or 3 would be pushing it for my tastes. I would look for this beer again any time."
"Pours crystal clear and bright, golden amber with a frothy pure white head. Very pretty. The nose is big-time citrusy American hops with some soft green edges, laid on a foundation of evocative caramel malts. On the palate, scratchy hop oils and brilliant orange marmalade flavors come up first, followed by a softened malt sweetness. Lots of bitterness toward the end, with active hop tingles left on the tongue. Overall, this is a great beer. Everything is balanced, smooth as possible given all the hops that were thrown in, and well-integrated. Very well done."
"Great Divide comes through again with this years batch of Fresh Hop. Bold hop character and a medium ABV make this easy drinking for not only Hop Heads but also lovers of fresh tasting APAs in general."
"Drinkability- This is a really nice beer. Its really similar to Deschutes Hop Trip with a bit more bitterness. If I had to pick one, Id probably go with the Hop Trip (just biased probably). This is a great beer though that you need to pick up while its still fresh. Thanks again to stopbarking!"
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. The Fresh Hop has a beautiful reddish copper color with a good off white head. The nose was a mix of grass and citrus, it smells good,a relaxing smell. The taste is hoppy but not to hoppy. I like this beer, the hops are not so overpowering, which is a good thing to me. I would recomend this beer, it is very easy to drink and will buy more of this beer before it is gone."
"Pours a clear light rustic copper hue with a one finger fluffy off-white head that stays for a while. Stickiness is very full covering all over the sides of the glass. Slick oily hop odors dominate the nose. Some mild earthy hop odors as well as the slightest hint of pine. I also detect a small bit of metallic caramel malt which balances our the smell quite nicely. Taste begins with a creamy grapefruit flavor that blends with an earthy grasslike tingle. Midway to the finish is pretty dry and bitter, but not to the point where it takes away from the flavor. Aftertaste is a bit dirty with some mild pine as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a subtle carbonation. I would definitely have to put this one a notch above Sierra Nevada's Harvest Ale. Deschutes Hop Trip is up next."
"Pours a crystal clear burned orange with a big soapy white head that laces as it dies. Smells of abminor blast of fresh hops(ha) and almost a little sweet malt. Taste is big juicy hops, grapefruit rind, bittering finish but all of this is doesnt linger. A miniscule amount of malt but nothing that can balance the hops. Crisp in the mouth with good carbonation. Very drinkable. An awesome pale ale from GD."
"Beautiful. A welcome change. Very smooth. The taste of earthy hops without the bitterness usually associated. I like the earthy tones in the beer."
"good stuff. One bottle is enough, as this is a hop kick to the teeth."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I wish I could have brought more back."
"Overall: I really like this beer; it should be introduced earlier in the season though. This would be a nice light hopped beer to drink at the beach or on a hot Florida afternoon. I love Great Divide and this is another example of a finely crafted easy drinking brew that is easy on the pocket."
"WTH? My husband just poured his half of the bomber to me. Guess I'm in luck. LOL"
"Drinks easy, not as impressed as the last 2 vintages, but nothing to sneeze at, one to look forward to every harvest!"
"This is a very nice and easy to drink APA. Great Divide rarely disappoints."
"If only this was readily available 365 days a year. Has a nice, deep amber appearance. The foam from the pour has that fresh from the fermenter look. Smells like fresh-cut grass after a nice mist of rain. The taste is truly exceptional -- piney taste of hops hits up front, but balanced with malt creaminess. A real, refreshing grassy, pine-like taste, which probably comes from the fresh hops. If you like Pales and IPAs, do whatever takes to give this a try."
"This is"
"Pours a cloudy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice small off-white creamy head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is very hoppy, some malts, good dose of citrus, and some pineyness, also some caramel. The taste is pretty hoppy for a Pale Ale, tones of malts, some citrus/pines, and caramel. The finish is slightly dry and bitter. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an extradinary pale ale, very tasty and hoppy, highly recommended."
"Dark orange color, clear with sudsy white head. The smell is grassy hops. The taste reminds me of bubblegum at first and then a bitterness comes around. The mouthfeel is perfectly smooth and creamy, excellent. I like this a lot better this year than I did last year."
"D: It's a decent example of a pale ale, though I think their Denver Pale Ale is better. I also wonder if this bottle might be from last year, in which case I might have an entirely different review for a truly fresh bottle."
"The taste is grassy and floral with a hop bitterness on finish. Maybe a little smoke aftertaste. Light bodied and perfectly carbonated for the style. A good APA and worth a try to find out what a fresh hop does to beer."
"i enjoy the seasonality of a fresh hopped beer and will look for this again next season"
"pours a beautiful red-gold with a cloudy head, highly carbonated. smells fantastic, huge amount of floral hops and some malty tones too. Tastes like an IPA and a red ale got together and made babies, lots of yummy maltiness but with a great compliment of hopness. mouthfeel is full and warm, drinkability is good, since it is a higher ABV beer i can't drink these all night long unless i want to forget how good it is"
"A very good pale ale base for the beer that is golden in color, a bit little when backlit, but a solid creamy head on top that hangs on. At on 55 IBU, it's not overwhelming but give a solid bite to the beer on which to overlay the fresh hop. A very citrusy taste though a little grassy but nothing distracting. Better cold because the grassy grows a bit as it warms--cleaner at frig temperature. Overall a very good beer if you like fresh hop in your nose."
"D - This is a VERY good beer with an awesome taste (for the style). Definitely my favorite APA I've had, I like it a lot better than Alpha King. And unfortunately this is the only Great Divide beer I can't get in Duluth!"
"An excellent beer."
"Overall, light and easy to drink. The hops are the featured ingredient without coming anywhere near harsh. Flavorful, light body, smooth mouthfeel. Highly enjoyable on a summer night spent outside, but I wish I'd gotten a fresher bottle."
"D - The Deschutes Hop Trip was a more memorable fresh hop pale ale in my opinion, perhaps because of the overnight hop shipping required for this brew. Still very tasty for a pale ale and worth a try."
"Pours out the usual pale ale colour with good clarity and a soapy white head with good lacing. Smell is subdued- probably due to bottle being consumed in April that is probably on the down turn. Taste- biscuity malts with medium caramel flavour. Hops are a little woody and have a herbal/tobacco bite. Nicely balanced and reminds me of FFF Alpha King. Very quaffable and a solid offering from one of my favourite breweries. Would love to try fresh in the fall."
"Notes: A little bit one-sided, but I like that side and it clearly lived up to the advertising: this tasted like fresh hops. This would be a great beer for a hot summer day."
"Quite drinkable. Crisp, clean, refreshing. Hoppier and less balanced than some, more bitter than some, but still within the APA style. I'll have this again."
"Drinkability: solid, just the right amount of pungent hop bitterness that doesnt go into the extreme category of the double IPAs. drank a bomber of this no problem at only 6% abv."
"A: Nice amber, head that stuck around. S: Citrusy and floral, grassy hops. T: Very nice, surprising sweetness underneath the hops, great balance. Dry finish. M: Mild carbonation, very smooth. D: Obviously very hoppy for a pale ale, but I didn't find any part of it overwhelming. Really refreshing. Very nice all around."
"Mouthfeel is nice, medium-bodied for a pale ale. Quite drinkable as I would have liked more after finishing the 22 oz bottle."
"D: More like an IPA than an American pale ale. For many American pale ales the distinction between the two styles is moot. Good beer. Easily drinkable. Let this beer warm - it really come complex with added strong malt character."
"Nicely done for the style."
"Overall an outstanding APA. Extremely well balanced malt and hops makes this one of the best pale ales I've ever had."
"D: Insanely drinkable. Very clean and refreshing. A wet hop dream in a bottle. I am in Hop Sedated Heaven!"
"Bottom line: I'm glad I have another bottle of this stuff because this is an APA that is all about, no celebrates the hops. Good job Great Divide!"
"This was a good beer. It had a nice appearance. The head stayed until I finished my beer. One of the best heads I've ever seen. Very thicka and frothy. THe smell was of hops. Sort of an earthy smell. Taste was hoppy with some caramel and pale malt balance. Mouthfeel was alright, but there wasn't as much carbonation on the palate as I would have liked. This beer is a sessionable beer. It's easy to drink."
"Drinkability: One of my new favorite APAs, this beer is so drinkable and well balanced. I want to say it's less aggressive then mirror pond (cascade hops), but a lot more going on than Sierra Nevada."
"Well if you like hops you'll love this one. If you don't well...steer clear of this mother. It has a smooth body with wonderfully fresh and crisp hop characteristics, and best of all a beautiful creamy head through the whole drink! A must have!"
"Overall this is an excellent APA and a special treat for hopheads. It has many of the wonderful qualities of a Double IPA, but it's much more drinkable, thanks to the lower alcohol level. I highly recommend this beer. Seek it out."
"Piney fresh hoppiness on the taste, very organic and bitter but decadent. Mouthfeel is juicy with a decent carbonation level, doesn't ""wow"" me up front but the hop bite in the aftertaste is nice. I will surely have this one again. Good complexity (not outstanding) but a solidly brewed, great beer."
"Overall a very good APA. Very drinkable."
"D: I could easily down a few bombers of this without batting an eye. I can't wait to try it fresh at the brewery."
"Drinkability is fine. This is a tasty and enjoyable brew. A good example of the XPA style--hops over malt with absolutely no defects. It calls itself an APA, and falls right in the middle of the IPA judging category at 55 IBU and 6% ABV. There are plenty of beers with more IBU but less flavor. All hail multiple hop additions!"
"Drinkability: this is an exceptional pale ale that can be quaffed all day long without developing boredom or laying flat on the floor. Absolutely great beer."
"In lesser hands the newly mown hops might come off as unduly brassy and raw, but here they impress as the green, viscous essence of American beer ingenuity. Now, the bite might get punchy after too much, but one happy bomber is decidedly drinkable and enjoyable. So the dimensions may be few, but they're a pleasing mix of subtle APA and snappy new-harvest hops with more depth than at first perceived."
"This beer poured into the glass a medium copper color, very clear, and was topped by a thick, fluffy off white head that showed good retention, and left a nice lace on the side of the glass as it settled. The nose does impart a good bit of hops. Light on the floral hop, more grassy with a citrus finish. Light caramel character in the aroma. The flavor is classic American Pale. Decent balance of caramel malt with a punch of citrus hops. Floral hop shows more mid way through the drink, and lasts into the finish. More bitterness than I expected in the beer. The mouth feel is slick, just a touch sticky. Decent drinkability. I've had a few other fresh hop offerings from Russian River, Moonlight to name a couple, and this lacks the strong floral character I really enjoyed in those beers. It could be the age, and if so, I apologize. Good enough that I will try again next year, and test the freshness."
"Overall, this is one interesting beer. It's not overly complex, being, as I said, nothing more than a standard American Pale Ale. But something with the wet hops does add a level to the drinking experience which was new to me, and one I enjoyed tremendously. This isn't a great beer, but it's a damned fine one, and well worth seeking out."
"Very drinkable and nice will be having more of these while I can still get them."
"Certainly worth trying."
"Just as good this year as I remember it being last year. It's intensely hoppy for a pale ale so be sure to pick this up hop fans."
"Fresh, tasty, crisp and very smooth. If you like hoppy pale ales - this one's for you!"
"Creamy, oily medium body with a dry, bitter aftertaste. The dryness makes you want to take another sip...to which I will gladly oblige. I only bought one of these, but I will be grabbing more before they disappear. This one is almost a session brew for me. Tasty."
"Pours a nice hazy darkish copper color with a nice cream colored head with good retention and lacing. Wonderful citrusy and floral hop aroma. Upfront the taste is biscuity malt then some powerful citrus flavor. Very nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied as the label promises and is pretty smooth. A very drinkable APA. Overall this is right up there with Alpha King as far as APA's go in my opinion. A great beer."
"D: Very nice fresh hop pale ale. Excellent bitterness makes me question if it's really a sneaky ipa. Definitely worth a shot if you can find it. One of the better hoppy pale ales out there."
"Fresh Hop Pale Ale pours a light tea color with an off white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. I like the aroma, it's all hops. The flavor is excellent, strong citrusy hops. Much lighter body than a double ipa, but in some ways fills the bill to get a hop fix that I might expect from a double ipa. Highly recommended."
"Great drinkability. Nice flavors and very refreshing."
"Poured from the 22oz bottle. This beer is an orangish amber color with a small creamy head that leaves a good amount of lacing around the sides of the glass. The aroma is dominated by fresh floral and grassy hops. The taste much like the aroma is dominated from the beginning by the hops. However, the malt does a pretty decent job of holding it's own in the background, but the hops not suprisingly definately steal the show. Overall, this is a highly recommended beer that I will surely revisit in the future."
"Hops, hops and then some mild sweet malt and then more hops. Its good for what it is, a massively hopped pale ale. I might even drink it again, but I wouldnt drink it a lot."
"I like the concept of the fresh hops, which you can actually taste (at least I felt I could). If you like hops, this is a great one to try."
"A very well done example of the expanding fresh hop family, hurry and seek this out before it grows stale."
"Aggressive enough to be interesting, but stops before it becomes a total hop bomb. Flavor is very smooth and balanced. Another winner from Great Divide."
"Can Great Divide go wrong? I haven't had a bad one yet, and this is simply divine. Highly drinkable especially considering the low ABV."
"Overall: A great, well-hopped pale ale, heartily recommended."
"D - Excellent. This brew goes down like a pale ale of much smaller proportions. The hops do not overpower and really just provide an all around great beer."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all night. Excellent."
"go buy a bottle. in a way this is just a really good example of the style, it pulls the right chords in all the right places."
"This beer is one of the most drinkable I have ever had. Another great beer from Great Divide. I have yet to find a notable flaw in any of their beers."
"The mouth is medium to light bodied, decent complexit, finishing dry and bitter on the hoppy climax. It's drinkable for any lover of the hops. I've yet to find a beer from GD that I haven't liked considerably."
"Pours a golden orange color with a thick head of medium sized tan bubbles. Aroma is sweet citrus with a touch of lawn. Taste mimics the aroma, with a pine resin bitterness in the aftertaste. OK, but I guess I expected more. An above average pale ale, but nothing special."
"Overall, may be a case of too high of an expectation. Beer is quite good. What is odd, is that the bottle version seems hoppier to me. A bit smoother as well."
"Drinkability is great, very enjoyable run out and get some if you can."
"I thought this beer was pretty decent. I didn't find myself thinking it was excellent, but it certainly went down fast nonetheless. It's very close to being worth the $6-plus I paid for it..."
"Great Divide Fresh Hop Pale Ale is pretty close to the beer that I thought it would be. It's a showcase for the (warning: bias ahead) best, most delicious hop varieties in the world. I can't think of one thing that I'd change about this ale; something that I don't say all that often. It's a damn shame, given the nature of the fresh hop style, that beer this good can only be released once each year."
"that's a tasty beer"
"This is one kick ass pale ale, maybe second only to Alpha King out of the ones Ive tried. Im a fan of fresh hop ales now!"
"Mouthfeel was slippery and thin to medium bodied. Carbonation was medium to mild. I will look for this one again."
"S - A very good APA. The fresh hops make it quite good."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" off-white head over the clear dark amber brew. Head lasts nicely, with plentiful sticky lace. Pungeant fruity pine hops aroma over a deeply sweet malt character. Flavor mimics the nose, both grain and hops strong but complementary to each other. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, but overall this one's a bit too intense for me to be a session drinker. Definitely and enjoyable brew though."
"The taste starts sweet before huge resinous hop flavors come along and eventually give up the floor to spicy and earthy subtleties. Little fruit notes pipe in occasionally and citrus flavor is conspicuously abscent until the beer has warmed considerabley. There is a resinous sticky/sweet/bitter aftertaste that is almost more interesting than the beer itself. I was reluctant to wash it down. Mouthfeel is light and sticky. The real story here is how much hop flavor Fresh Hop has with very little bitterness to speak of. This is certainly APA pushed to the fringes."
"D: The abv is moderate and a fresh hop flavors are quite good, making me look forward to next autumn's harvest."
"Pours a nice copper tone, with a good sized head that has some nice clumping and staying power as well as some decent lacing throughout. Smell is wonderfully hopped, like a pine cone dipped in orange juice! Fantastic full hoppy smell. Taste is right up with the smell. Full on hops from the gate. Piney, very grassy and citus, AWESOME. Very smooth with a nice dry aftertaste that begs you to come back for more."
"Mouthfeel is good, nothing spectacular. Drinkability is ok, I enjoyed this beer, but I'm not sure it lends itself to sessionability. This is something I'd have later in an evening when I'm perhaps folling this beer with a big IPA to end the night."
"D  very drinkable, although the bitterness starts building up halfway through the 22 oz bottle. I like the way the hops really dominate, might be room for a little more malt for balance, but this is the best of the few fresh hop beers I have tried."
"Drinkability: It doesn't get much better than this for a hophead"
"D - tasty beer, a nice IPA with a good hop flavor and not overwhelming bitterness. Not really something I will put on my calendar every year though."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Good balance, but hops dominant as I only get a glimmer of a malt presence. A very refreshing pale ale more than a full-on hop attack, but I think that's what they are going for. Great drinkability, and definately good for more than one in a sitting."
"Overall, this is another winner from Great Divide. The hops taste is clean and perfect without being overbearing. There really is no flaw with this beer, although the hops punch could be too much to handle for some."
"Highly Recommended!!!"
"Out of the 22 oz. bomber, this Pale Ale came out clear and bubbly, and readily formed a three finger thick head, which looked quite nice atop the pale amber colored body. The aroma was typical of the C hopped west coast products, with a leafy and citric hop profile. The hops were backed by the scent of sweet and partially caramelized malt. While not overly strong, especially considering the presence of the words Fresh Hop in the name, the smell was spot on for an American Pale Ale. The taste was well balanced between sweet toffee-ish malt and spicy dry hop oils. Not a lot of bitterness was present, except for a little grapefruit rind like flourish at the end of each sip. Feeling a bit thicker on the tongue than a run of the mill Pale Ale, this was highly quaffable, while not being watery. A well made beer, which was not quire the showcase of hops I was hoping it would be. The quality was however so good, it kept my disappointment from creeping into the score."
"This pale ale is mighty good. It would be hard to top. There was a fair head that has faded to a thin coating. There is ample lacing. The beer has a nice orange glow when held to the light. The smell is is of sweet hops. The taste is of hops and nothing else. A very bitter beer. There is a sweetness to the taste as well. The mouthfeel is sticky and there is a lasting bitterness that does not go away anytime soon. Overall, a very good beer that is a must try for hop lovers."
"Bite covers most of the tongue, instead of just the sides. Crisp finish. Flavor was overpowered by the hops and 'slickness', still not bad though. Rated mostly 4s, cuz it seems less like a PA."
"Delightful with a very farm fresh hop feel."
"Very tasty and (obviously) fresh overall. A green, refreshing pale ale."
"I feel this beer deserves a five on drinkability as I would love to have this as my everyday pale ale but alas, the paradox remains that you can't really have a beer that tastes freshly hopped all year, can you? I'll give it a five anyway though because it's very very good."
"Well-chilled, Great Divide Fresh Hop Pale Ale sits in my nonic a glowing amber orange, with zero visible carbonation, and a thick, clumpy, pock-marked off-white head. Great sticky rings of lacing. Mellow grassy pine and mild grapefruit aromas mingle with understated caramel malt scents. The wet hops give this pale ale a far ""grassier"" taste than most other American versions of this style. There are certainly pine and citrus flavors apparent in the taste, but they are far more subtle than in other pales. As I mentioned before, the hop profile is primarily grassy, with some earthy mineral notes coming through. Slight caramel sweetness, off-dry mouthfeel. The palate is a bit clingy in patches, sort of juicy at other times. Altogether, this is an ""uncharacteristic"" pale ale, that ends up standing out for not being a normal c-hop showcase. Extremely easy to drink, but only with the proviso that this is not a pine-grapefruit bomb. A bit pricey, but certainly worth the effort to seek out."
"Good amber/orange color with a modest fluffy white head.The nose was a pleasant grassy grapefruit aroma. Medium body with a nice orange peel, earthy silky taste. The big difference between this extravently hopped ale and say a Ipa is the fresh hops seem to be more mellow and fruity not as bitter. The low alcohol level helps alot in this regard to. Such a good price for how much planning and hard work that goes into this fresh hop ale!"
"I used to really love this, but after having had Sierra Nevada's Harvest this year, I really needed to reevaluate this offering from Great Divide. Just doesn't offer the great malty caramel backing which SN's does. Just a bit thin and one-dimensional. Still a really good beer, but for the price, you can certainly get a better wet hop beer."
"This beer is very drinkable, very tasty, alcohol is nearly unperceivable. This can easily become a session beer."
"Mouthfeel was nice. Just the right amount of carbonation to go with this beer. Nice and smooth. With the fairly low ABV, I could drink this one all night. I wanted another bomber immediately after I had finished the first. But alas, I had only bought one."
"Poured with a frosting-like head that never uite went away. Fairly clear and brown. Nose is hoppy but comes across as very evergreen and wet sod. Flavor is full of citrus and pine but leaning more to the grapefruit and lemons than Christmas. Malts are very subdued and overpowered by the hops. Medium mouthfeel with an oily texture from the hops that lingers surprisingly briefly. Fine and drinkable but a bit off-balance to really enjoy."
"SIgnificant grapefruit C hop aroma, quick fading head, lots of lace. Bitter like an ESB dying but very drinkable on a scorching Saturday. Drying aftertaste, tasty complex bitterness,like the hops, citrus, well malted, well carbonated. Some of the fresh homebrewed taste from this sub-style."
"Medium mouthfeel, but a bit stickier than I'd like and great drinkability. For $3.99 per bomber, this is one great value for money brew."
"Slàinte!"
"I will buy this more often because it is so good. I love amarillo hops and this is a little better than Sierra Nevada."
"Picked up a bomber at AJ's in mid-October 2007 for $6.99. Not much has changed since my first try of this. This is one fine APA!"
"I really enjoyed this beer. I've been looking for it for awhile at stores that seem to carry most other Great Divide brews, and finally found it in a store that only carried Fresh Hop and one other. The fresh hops add a distinct taste to this beer that I really like. I'll be venturing back to the store to buy a few more bombers very soon."
"Overall: A solid brew with some intense up front flavors. Takes a few sips to really taste the quality of the brew, but I don't mind the continuous sipping. A nice, fresh APA."
"Taste; as expected the hops are right there in your face, but manage to keep from becoming overwhelming. The malts are there just enough to add a bit of sweetness, that seems to set you up for the next bit of hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and is just about what I would hope for in the style."
"Murky amber with a full frothy white head. Excellent hoppiness comes through in the aroma. Great floral and citric bitter notes nice and juicy with hops. Flavor starts with some lightly bitter citric hops notes before some smooth toasty malt sets in. Some light caramel provides a sweet touch to it. Finish is lightly bitter and hoppy. The aroma was great with the hops juiciness but the taste was a bit of a let down from that but still good. Solid body with good carbonation. I could have drunk a few of these."
"Surprisingly quaffable for the level of bitterness, this is a solid straightforward American Pale Ale."
"Hazed and fiery copper. The head is a fluffy eggshell foam that slowly settles to a skim coat. Strands of sticky lacing cling to the sides. Citrus rind bitterness with a fresh cut grass undercurrent, there is also a bright, clean note clearly present. Boldly bitter upfront, sharp but not too sharp citrus rind. Solid malt body works to support the hops and provides a counterbalancing sweetness. The finish is bitey, rindy, and lingers a long while. There is an almost salty component. Medium body, light mouthfeel, moderate carbonation and smooth. Not bad overall, enjoyable and drinkable, but it seemed as though there was something lacking, something that would have made this clearly standout from among the other pale ales."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied with good carbonation. This is a damn drinkable, sessionable brew for sure. I wish I had local access to it as it would be a staple in my fridge. If you're a hophead or ya like APA's...get yours hands on this beer! Yet another winner from Great Divide...keep them coming!"
"Copper with orange highlights. The nose piney, lemony, floral, citric, caramelly and very fresh. Lovely aromas. Great hop flavor but very little bitterness. Pacific Northwest Hops. Very grassy with leaves, citrus notes, pine sap, light fruitiness and caramel. This is a very well rounded Pale Ale. This isnt a big beer at all, just a plain n simple medium bodied, lightly hopped (for the style) american pale ale."
"This is a very drinkable beer and I'm looking forward to finding some fresh next fall. What impresses me is just how good this tastes when it's certainly ""past it's prime"" at six months old. The hop flavors are still clear and clean with no apparent degradation. If a fresher bottle tastes better than this it would be a treasure."
"Crystal clear amber/orange with a frothy, off-white head. Great retention and lots of clumpy lace. The hop aroma is very smooth and completely without harshness, very delicate for the amount - plenty of grapefruit and grassy character. There's also a bit of caramel and honey behind all the hops. Very balanced flavour with Just enough maltiness to keep the hops in check. Bitterness is solid, but not overdone. Green, grassy, and grapefruit hops are everywhere in the flavour - they linger long into the finish along with a hint of caramel. Slightly drying and creamy texture - there's a bit of powdery character from the hops. Carbonation and body are just on the light side of medium. There's a hint of warmth as well. This beer is highly quaffable. I can imagine drinking pint after pint of this."
"Wow. Pours a clear orange/brown, medium sized white head, lots of sticky lace and great retention. Smell is citrus hops, caramel, floral hops, more hops, some more caramel, excellent, and superbly balanced. Taste is caramel up front, followed by an extreme citrus and floral hop hit, lots of hoppage in the finish, clean bitterness thats just right. Great floral/citrus aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with low carbonation. Amazing, best pale ale I've ever had, hands down. Malt and hops are perfectly balanced, a superb sipper, would love to stock up on this. Thanks DrJay!!!"
"Moderate body, delicate carbonation. Pleasant, easy drinking, but not out of the ordinary. Pretty drinkable, a bit hoppy, but it is a ""fresh hop pale ale", so I really shouldn't use strict APA guidelines (hah)."
"(2006 Note: While on tap I think this beer was much like last year's, the bottled version's hop potency is DIPA level. Makes for a unique experience because the alcohol isn't there. I don't think it's as easy drinking as before, but for a hop kick it's nearly unmatched)"
"D: As stated above, the beer seems smoother as you drink more of it. If you combine that with the fact that it’s not very filling, the beer is pretty drinkable as long as you’re down with the hop taste. I’m not sure how many I could drink at a time; since I only have the one 22 oz. bottle, but I’m sure I could put away a decent amount. Overall this is a good beer, but not for beginners. I find it a bit stronger than other beers that I’ve had of this style."
"Hazed orange. Thin, tight ivroy white head. Good retention and intricate lace properties. Great aroma of fresh hops, orange marmalade based malt derivatives and grassy, pungent hop oils. This all follows through on the buds. Bright citric hop tones of grapefruit and lemon peel. Grassy. Very fresh tasting even though this is months old. Malt provides a solid backbone and is toffeeish and caramelly in nature. Some of that marmalade character comes through as well. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Yet another nice accomplishment by Great Divide. They have been impressing the hell out of me over the past year or so."
"Pours a hazy amber (possible ""hop haze"") with a nice thick beige head that retains well. The aroma just jumps out at you with huge, juicy citrus and floral hops, some sweet caramel, toasted bread, fruity esters and a hint of ethanol. The taste starts off with an agressive hoppiness, citrusy and floral (very fresh and green tasting), followed by a caramel sweetness, fruity esters and toasted bread. The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation and drinkability is excellent. An excellent APA, just bursting with fresh hop flavor and a crisp finish that balances the beer well...something to seek out for sure."
"Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, clean. Good balance keeps this from being too harsh, easy to drink. I could have a few."
"Quite drinkable and a nice tatsing brew. At times, it's almost like having a mouthfull of fresh hop cones."
"I'd been enthusiastically seeking out this beer for a while, ever since I heard it was coming out. I like Great Divide's stuff, and I'm glad to say it was worth the effort to get a bottle. An impressive showcase for this year's delicious pacific northwest hop crop. I'm hoping they make this an annual thing. I'd love to try this fresh off the conditioning tank. I bet it's heavenly."
"met my expectations, only wish it was a tad more drinkable. for a pale ale, could have dropped to 5 or so % and still kicked ass. recommended for fans of hoppy beers.. just don't go in expecting nectar of hop juice spritzer."
"This is an APA to treasure. One of the most drinkable very hoppy beers I've ever had!"
"The beer pours a dark gold color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich and complex malt scent that is comprised of pale, carapils, and bisquit malts. It has a nice bisquity aroma that balances well with the hops. The hop aroma is very nice. It has a grassy hop scent that is bitter and rich, but not over the top. The taste is great. It has a well balanced attack of malt and hops. It has a light crystal and bisquit malt flavor along with a bitter, citrus hop finish. This beer is incredibly smooth and easy drinking. It has tremendous mouthfeel. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a near perfect beer. I like everything about it. Just another great beer from Great Divide."
"Cheers2Beers"
"drinkability: very very easy drinking...this bomber wont last long. smooth, fresh and delicious"
"Clear light orange brew. Nearly white one finger head on the pour. Left only a single bubble layer on top. Lots of lace. Aroma is strong with fresh hops. Mostly citrus grapefruit with some pine. Simple but really pungent. Taste is strong with pine hops with a little citrus and grassy hops in the back. Not overly bitter though even though there is a hearty dose of hops. Fairly balanced, but the hops are the main focus here and nothing overly malty comes out to me. Mouthfeel is good, typical of a decent pale ale. Drinkability is really good. Crisp and refreshing and not overbearing with the flavor or the alcohol level. Definately worth a shot..."
"Tastes of fresh herbal hops. Soem bitterness here but not overwhelming. More fresh and floral than bitingly bitter. SOme nice fruity malt to back it up. Hops stick to the mouth but the beer is fairly light otherwise. Nice stuff!"
"Drinkability- Not sure I could session a six pack of this because of the sweetness. But it's damn well one of the best if not the best pale ale I've had. Right up there with Alpha King. Borderline IPA."
"D - The drinkability was good. Not my favorite Great Divide beer, but a good one none the less."
"Put this cloudy, sort of muddy looking beer bam, right in the kisser. Huge grassy fresh hops greet the nose, and then beat on your toungue when you take quaff. Big hops for a pale ale. The hop bitterness makes this a lip smacker and taste bud killa. A damn fine beer from a damn fine brewery."
"The beer dispenses from the 22-ounce brown bottle a luminous golden amber color with a moderate semi-creamy light tan head that slowly erodes leaving a fine coating of lace to surround the glass. Nose has pleasant hop floral aroma backed buy sweet malt, start is slightly sweet, the top middling in feel to the palate. Finish is mildly acidic with nice hop spiciness, dry aftertaste and a very drinkable beer and Great Divide a long time favorite brewery."
"Fairly drinkable. The finish is rough at first but I was craving it by the end. Still, this wasn't up to par with the other ""hop harvest"" beers I've tried this year (Founder's, Sierra Nevada)."
"Hats off to Great Divide for trying something fresh."
"Feel is about medium, a bit parching in its bitterness and dryness, but stays the course(coarse) and keeps a very teetering balance that could fold either side into too much pine and/or too much parchness. That said, for no other reason then this- its damn drinkable. It keeps a nice clean profile overall while grabbing hold with woody, citrus tinted bitterness, and maintains a doughy little malt backing while doing it. Some sweetness finds its way in around the corners, in the middle, and very, very late after the finish. Which in turn helps this become quite a fun ride to drink down. After finally sitting down with this one, it seemed a bit more woody then the others I've had in the past month or so. A little more clean, snappy, crisp, and citric and this bottle would have nailed it, much like previous bottles. Another bottle or two and another review may be in order..."
"Copper in color with a slight haze to it. Ok head but some great lacing on the glass. Huge hop aroma-very fresh as the name implies. Not as citrusy as some pale ales but very ""fresh cut grass"" like. Nice big hop flavor that is well balanced with just the right amount of malt. Doesnt have the over hopped astringency of other US pales. Good body-nice clean finish considering how hoppy it is. Overall a very enjoyable beer. Really well done US pale ale. Great Divide is quickly becoming my favorite US brewer. Thanks a bunch to mushroomcloud for the bottle."
"This is one of the best beers I've had in 2005. Great Divide has been a multi-year roll of brilliantly brewed beers."
"This brew pours a cloudy reddish-orange color. The head is one-finger in height, rocky, and white. Lacing coats the glass all over the place. The aroma is amazing. It is as if this beer climbed a mountain and screamed citrusy hops. Absolutely breathtaking. This just might be the best smelling beer I have drank to date. The taste is all that a pale ale should be and more (but not so much more that it infringes on IPA territory). Citrusy hops dominate the flavor but there are also nots of pine. The mouthfeel is perfect; medium-thick bodied, with nice carbonation, and oh so smooth and creamy. Overall, this is by far the best pale ale I have ever had. If only hops could be harvested year round."
"Overall Impression: Massively drinkable, enough balance to really let me enjoy hop goodness. A very well crafted beer, I recommend it."
"Finally found this in Atlanta. I really the fresh hop beers, when I can get them. The aroma was only moderately hoppy with distinctive grass and citrus. Rocky, off-white head wit excellent lacing that lasted longer than I expected. Initial flavor was moderately bitter with a light, sweet, short finish. Carbonation was quite flat. This was a good, but not great beer. As far as ""fresh hop"" beers go, this is the best I've had for a while."
"Amber in colour with medium carbonation and good head retention. Not much of a surprise with the aroma.. the c-hops are huge with this one. Loads of pine resin, orange, and grapefruit, with some minor floral and grassy notes. In the mouth, there is a decent amount of caramel malt presence, and a bit of a peppery note, but really, this beer is all about the hops... with more citrus, pine, and some green hop cone flavors. Its fairly heavy in the mouth too. Not really all that balanced or complex, but if you like hops, this is the beer for you."
"This is generally a good beer, I like the aggressive hoppiness, but I just don't get much out of the taste."
"The color is copper with a large, off-white head. Retention is very good. The aroma is solely of strong, delicious, citrissy hop smell. Taste is more of the same, very flavorful, yet at the same time I was a bit disapointed because the flavor wasn't much different than standard dry-hopped APAs. Freshness was perhaps a little bit more noticeable in the flavor. Bitterness was moderate. Okay, this is a great APA, but I didn't find it to be as exemplary as most other reviewers."
"Appearance: Copper amber body with a fine bubbled off white cream head leaves wide bands of lacing evenly down my Duvel chalice as the head floats above the rim. Aroma: Great pine cone and citrus hop aromatics also packs some floral tones mixed with a sugary slightly fruit malt base that pair well with the grassiness of the hop additions. Taste: Hop bitterness very welcoming grapefruit and grassy hop flavors are streaking across the palate semi sweet bready notes help balance finishes with a touch of caramelized citrus peels that reminds me of well done Orange chicken from a chinese restaurant. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied slight oily texture from the lucious loads of wet hops used may be the best pale ale I've tasted yet. Drinkability: 22oz. is effortless loads of flavor very refreshing brew, Great Divide has found a friend in the hop."
"22 ounce bottle. Great Divide Fresh Hop Ale pours out a clear copper color with a creamy looking head. Pungent, resiny hop aroma. Biscuit malt flavor with lots of hop flavor. Not as bitter as an IPA, but this beer certainly has as much hop flavor as almost any IPA. Grapefruit hop flavors. The malt is there, but almost overwhelmed by the hop flavor. Soft mouthfeel. This is a pretty good beer, but I prefer the Titan IPA."
"I am really enjoying these fresh hopped brews popping up in our area. Another solid offering from Great Divide."
"Drinkability: Good. I found myself drinking this like it was the last beer on earth and had to remind myself to slow up and enjoy it. No problems. Very fresh. Very crisp. Very well engineered. Normally I would pass up a pale ale for an IPA, but this was a rewarding experience that any hop enthusiast would enjoy."
"I'm gonna call this one an I.P.Ale Ale. Witty, huh? Because this beer really defies categorization. Hoppy and citrusy like an I.P.A., but with the rich finish of a superior pale ale. All the fresh ""wet"" hops they use in this brew lend a remarkably fresh taste right out of the bottle. A bit spendy at almost $7.00 for a 22-ounce bomber, but this baby's worth it..."
"Drinkability & Notes  Its hard to find a flaw in this beer, its just really good. It has more hop flavor than most IPAs with less bitterness. This is my first wet hopped beer, and if this is any indication I should search out more immediately. Another gem from Great Divide, I need to go buy a few more of these."
"22 ounce bottle."
"The mouth starts out moderate, but it seems to hit a blank spot and thin out towards the finish. Interesting, but not enough to keep me interested past one or two more servings."
"Still, I don't mind it, but I would consider using a different hop varietal to brew with next September."
"Overall impression: Great example of what you can do with fresh hops - definitely another quality offering. Hopefully this will be an annual event!"
"Drinkability: I like the fresh hop style, i think this is my 3rd or 4th, and they are always delicious, the way they bring out the flavors of the hop, but not piling it on like IPAs (not that that is a bad thing). This is a good example."
"Fresh Hop Pale Ale reminds me a little of the Silver Creek IPA I had a couple weeks ago, in that it's darker than the average PA, yet still quite hoppy. Great Divide definitely didn't skimp on the malts--this is no hop bomb--and there are definitely some low-level chocolate notes floating around underneath the fresh hop smack. As cokes noted, the hop flavor is huge, but the bittering is controlled to the point that you could easily drink a couple of these bombers in quick succession. Great beer."
"Extraordinaily drinkable... I must go find some more of these... at $6 a pop, they're quite a steal, as are most of this brewery's products."
"As a caveat, this either has some variation, or needs to drunk very fresh, as the last two bottles I've had were weaker hop-wise, and, while still solid, generallly disappointing in comparison to my initial euphoria."
"Extremely drinkable. Strong hop flavor up front balanced by a good maltiness. This is one hell of a beer. I think it leans more toward an IPA. This should be an all year treat. Thanks to Coal Train Liquors for carrying it."
"Excellent offering from Great Divide. If you are into hops, you owe it to yourself to try this! Great hop flavor, but it's also nicely balanced."
"Pours a solid copper color with a finger of head that falls to a solid coating over the brew. Leaves a touch of lace as the head falls. Nose is all about the hops. Sweet citrusy hops. Touches of caramel malt are there, but its mostly hops. Flavor is very hoppy as well. Sweet, citrusy, as well as a solid caramel malt backbone. Light bitterness clings to the finish, but not offensive at all, along with a very raw hop flavor. Similar to taking hops right off the bine and tasting the flowers. Very tasty beer. Feel is moderate with a moderate to moderate-high carbonation. This is a fine beer. As far as an APA goes, this really is really drinkable. Flavors are really well melded. Nothing to complaing about."
"Drinkability is great. Too bad this is a seasonal...I wish this would replace their Denver Pale Ale."
"The mouthfeel is the one complaint I have with this beer. Seems to lack carbonation almost altogether. Other than that, the palate is quite refreshing. In conclusion, This is a very drinkable beer: one bomber is not enough."
"As far as I'm concerned, this is a fine beer and fits right in with GD's other brews. Well-made, intensely deep and flavorful. This is a rather aggressive APA, but a name only does so much."
"Extremely drinkable for one bomber. Much more than that and my taste buds will be gone."
"Another very well-done beer in the Great Divide bomber series. And a fine example of the ""style", such as it is..."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"An exceptional brew. This one is worth searching out."
"Resiny and tingling--my tastebuds are ringing with fresh herb oils: wild bergamot. Citrus skins and drops of pine essence clad in silky malts hug my tongue . Mildly fruity. Drinks like a fresh, clear cider. I find this very sensual with a lingering and enticing aftertaste. It's like necking on a warm lawn."
"A nice offering found here in Greensboro,poured a rich copper with a fluffy 2 finger head that left a nice sheet of lace behind as it settles.The label says whole hop cones are shipped wet overnight to Denver to be brewed the very next day after being shipped and let me tell ya the aroma of this baby shows it.Intense grassy,piney,resiny goodness smacks you in the face and the aromas just continue to linger well after being poured.The big dose of fresh hops are not overpowering in this brew yeah its big and resiny but there is a sweet caramel malt backbone that holds up extremely well.At 55 IBU's its not insanely bitter but the freshness of the hops makes it immensley flavorful,I will be getting more of this very very soon for sure."
"Overall, a very nice APA. A decent amount of hoppiness, but definitely in the APA vs the IPA category. The body brings it down some, otherwise it would be one of the top APAs I've had - as is, it's still up there."
"The beer finishes with a solid bitterness, which does not particularly linger too long. The finish is quite smooth, it really just begs for taking another sip. The overall hoppiness and carbonation of this brew gives it a peppery bite as the beer sits in my mouth. This beer is really quite nice, perhaps the most flavorful Pale Ale I have ever had. The fresh, vibrant hop character is really nice and this beer is still fairly smooth without that intense grassy character I have had in other fresh hop beers."
