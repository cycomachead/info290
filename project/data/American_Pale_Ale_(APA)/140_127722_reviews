"I Pop!ped the cap and began a very gentle pour as I was simply unsure of what was going to happen. Would the hops have fallen off and settled in the kick? The only was to really know was to initiate things. There were some lees becoming visible, so I backed off and left them in the bottle. I then employed the bartender's trick to get a finger of tawny head that quickly fell back to wisps, but left sticky lacing in its wake. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, "

"I was really expecting a hop bomb, but this is actually really nice.  Definitely hoppy, but surprisingly restrained on the lingering bitterness."

"Richer (and darker) than a typical pale ale, lovely velvety yet surprisingly heavy mouthfeel, and pours with a foamy head that resembles soft~beaten egg whites (in a good way). I'm neither a pale ale nor hop-lover, but this is a nice departure from typical APAs."
"O: Given the quality of pale ales both SN and FFF make this is a big disappointment. An okay beer but very unremarkable. Not nearly as good as any of the year-round let alone special pale ales either brewery makes"

"11/23...BCAA 7/12....pours medium copper/amber with fluffy white foam, small layer. Light hoppy pale nose. Taste is a mellow malt with a spiky hop push. Long finish. Notes of pine, trees, oils, peppermint. Classic pale with a twist."

"A nice pale, overall tastes like it was dumbed down from 3F's standardly aggressive style. It has a nice creamy malt bill which is really good, however there's lack of hop presence. It just doesn't taste like a SN/Three Floyd's collab should to me~"

"Pours a nice fairly clear light amber color. One inch fluffy tan head, good retention. Aroma is really yeasty, like the smell of rising bread dough. I get just a bit of piney notes as well. Flavor is pretty subdued, with just a bit of malty sweetness, some faint citrus flavors and a bit of piney bitterness on the back end. Mouthfeel was kinda thin, not much going on there. Overall, this beer was a little underwhelming, considering its pedigree."

"Nice and enjoyable."

"O: great beer, can't wait to try zombie dust and other 3F originals"

"Uncomplicated but, well balanced. Light and easy drinking. Not bad."

"Overall:  More of an English style than American, but pretty content with this beer."
"O- This one is okay. Honestly. I like both these guys' individual Pale Ales better than this one. Just a bit underwhelming."
""
""
""

"o; A pretty tasty, solid American pale ale in every respect, although not as hoppy as many."

"Had with dinner last night.  I liked the tropical hopping but the malt bill was a little off."
""

"Pours a copper amber with a medium white lasting fluffy head. Aroma and Taste is citrus fruity notes, somewhat mild herbal earthy hops bitterness, some mild orange notes as it warms up, a bit of malty caramel as well. Palate is a medium body, moderate carbonation. The finish is a sweet malty flavor, some herbal earthy hops, citrus orange notes. Has good malty character, a somewhat subdued pale ale but still very good and solid all around."
"Medium body and carbonation."

"Yes, I know... I should have had this 6-8 weeks ago. Didn't happen... deal with it. Nice amber pour into the old snifterino... 1/2 finger of off white head. Nice piney notes, along with the signature SN clean, bitter aroma. Definitely more malt than hop, but there was a nice, even bitterness. I did not dislike my Beer Camp experience... would it have been better 6 weeks ago... probably. It must be a well made brew if it is still enjoyable a bit beyond the optimal dates... still the first FFF I have seen around these parts! Light, refreshing moutfeel... nailed the crispness, etc. I am def going to pursue Beer Camp next time around!"
""
""
"Was expecting a little more because of the Three Floyds collaboration; however the hops likely faded well past their peak of freshness.  A tad disappointed because this beer doesn't exactly ""wow"" me, but it's such a well balanced and well brewed pale ale that if this were a regular beer by any other brewery it would find itself in my rotation quite often."

"Pours a clear, copper color.  1/4 inch head of a white color.  Slight retention and slight lacing.  Smells of pine, sweet malt, hops, hint of alcohol, and a hint of citrus.  Fits the style of an American Pale Ale.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of caramel malt, hint of alcohol, pine, hops, and a hint of citrus.  Overall, weak body, decent aroma, decent feel, good body, and good blend."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very nice pale ale; a lot going on;"
""
"O - Not a big fan here. An unbalanced APA with some glaring flaws. One of the weakest of the Beer Camp 12 pack."

"Good beer has three Floyd's hop characteristics with Sierra Nevada consistency ( not that three Floyd's doesn't also have great consistency)."
""
""
"As a Pale Ale fan I would keep this in the fridge always if it was available."
""
""
""
""
"SN and 3F team up to make a great pale ale? What a surprise!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A decent beer but could have been so much better given the breweries involved and the style"
"Taste-Citrus hops, toasted malt. Nicely balanced and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - an excellence Pale Ale."
"O:  Like another reviewer said, this was a combination of Alpha King and SN Pale Ale.  I longed for more King and less Chico.  Nothing stellar.  Just OK."
""
""
"Pours a mostly clear copper hue with a quarter inch of head. Pine, hop, citrus, alcohol aroma. Taste is sub par, especially with the two breweries involved. Messy. Flavors do not coalesce. Odd and off-putting. Next..."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours  a significant amount of head that dissipates quickly but still leaves a film on top. The beer itself is a clear brownish amber color. The beer smell has a strong hop and malt notes. The hops are the stronger of the two and has a grassy and citrusy  and earthy note. The malts have a caramel note that dominates but mixes well with the earthy hop notes. The taste is similar to the smell with a sweet caramel malt flavor mixing with an earthy and bitter hop taste. Also, there is a slight citrus taste surrounding the bitter hops and malts. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium but on the heavier side. Overall, a pretty good pale ale."
""
"To me this tastes like SNPA and Alpha King, perhaps 65/35 respectively and I love both of those beers. IMO the mission was carried out with reasonable success; some of the flavors aren't quite as smooth as those two but it is quite good."
""
""
"Overall: A very solid take on an American Pale Ale. Good balance of citrus and earthy hops with a solid caramel malt presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little mild but very nice and smooth."
"D:  Chico King tastes impeccably like the blending of SN Pale Ale and Three Floyds Alpha King.  And I must say the whole is better than the sum of its parts here.  Bravo with this one as well.  Thoroughly enjoyed drinking this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Surprisingly malty (as many others have said) for these two powerhouse breweries; age is clearly a factor but it is a very forgettable APA"
""
""
""
"The flavor has a nicely rounded bitterness, with a bit of straw and some melon notes, as well as a kiss of strawberry on the end. Finished dry, leaving me wanting more."
""
""
""
"O: Well balanced, quite drinkable, but not really anything super special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Standard pale ale here, nothing more, nothing less. Nice and drinkable, very refreshing, but, unfortunately, very forgettable. No aspect of the beer stands out at all, and if it was a general release there would be nothing bringing me back to buy more."

"Bottle: Poured a copper color ale with a nice off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of citrus hoppy notes with some sweet malty notes also noticeable. Taste is dominated by some citrusy notes with medium bitterness and not as much floral notes as expected. Malt backbone is bigger than I had anticipated with some residual sugar notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Good drinkability but hops punch is not as dominant as I would have expected."
""
""
""
""
"Overall...meh"
""
"Overall this is a darn good beer."
""
""
"Overall, this was ok, but way too earth, dry and rustic for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a wonderful pale ale, bordering on IPA by stats and flavor but having more of the sweetness and body I associate with pale ale.  Perfect balance for my palate.  This is one of the best pale ales I've had in the past year outside of Toppling Goliath's Pseudo Sue."
""
""
""
"Totally forgettable beer.   I expected more from this collaboration."
""
""
""
"Crisp and refreshing throughout. Short aftertaste. Easy to drink beer."
""
""
"Solid but not exceptional APA."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid American Pale Ale. Nothing really stands out, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. I suppose the issue I have here is that I expected more from the collaboration; I would definitely choose a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale or a 3 Floyds Alpha King over this."
""
""
""
"how could a beer with such hop character only have 45 IBUs?  Very nice head - tight foam with lace that coated the entire glass on the way down to the bottom.  Like most of the other brews in the year's collection this offering isn't short on malt.  Bright and clear - cleansing to the palate.  Wishing I could buy a case of this fine brew."

"Pretty good, but I'd honestly rather take a regular Sierra Nevada."
""
""
"Two plus fingers worth of crisp airy light khaki colored frothy goodness comprised of big chunky bubbles...  Excellent retention...  The top of the froth turns a much more rocky as it settles a bit...  The color is a medium bronze with a slight green apple hue when back lit...  A moderate bit of small bubbled slightly quick paced carbonation rises throughout...  A good bit of lacing clings to the sides of the glass...  Overall a really nice looking brew...  A rich warm bready biscuit aroma...  Some light caramel notes as well...  A faint whiff of hops, but not much more...  The palate is much more of the same...  A big assertive malty base tempered by only a slight bit of hops...  I'm a big fan...  The mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium bodied...  Big and chewy...  Fills and coats the mouth evenly...  Each sip is enjoyable...  Overall this one is a rock solid APA...  I'm not 1/2 way through the Beer Camp Across America collection and this one is the leader in the club house at this point...  A very nice job by Sierra Nevada and Three Floyds...  I could see myself drinking this one with regularity if it were available by itself year round..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste has a nice hop flavor with mild citrus and slightly leafy quality mixed with a slight caramel taste from the malt and light biscuit accent w/ mild dry bitter herbal element but not quite grassy with resinous aspect in the hoppy dry finish. Overall this is not a bad Pale, but not meeting expectations either considering the two breweries that collaborated on this. It is almost like a mild pliny nice but not outstandingcould have used more hop aroma/flavor"
""

"Decent but nowhere near what I was hoping for."

"Aroma of cascade hops makes this smell like a super version of SNPA on the surface, along with a touch of onion/shallot with warming.  Taste follows but is a bit drier than expected and with a spicy hop finish.  Offers a full yet dry finish.  Firmly carbonated, smooth and creamy in texture.  ABV is well hidden even with the dryness giving the beer a slightly chalky feel.  Old school with some new hops."

"Overall: Hard to truly judge this 3 month old bottle, but it didn't hit our area until it was 10 months old.  I don't pretend to know the logistical struggles with release a variety pack with 12 different bottles... but I tend to believe these hoppy beers should have been brewed closer to release time... (3.80)"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the few beers I simply couldn't finish.  I'm assuming I had a bad bottle, because if not, this wasn't good.  Did not like the aroma or flavor, and what favor it had was very muted."

"Overall a very good American pale ale. The Beer Camp Across America pack keeps turning out winners."
""
""
""
"Overall - Quite dull. Unexciting and almost nonexistent hop flavor. Just malty."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Its not bad really but its not that good either. Whats the deal with the carbonic mineral flavor in every single one of these beer camp offerings this year? Meh."
""
"Glass- shaker pint"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Alpha King has far superior aromatics and SN Pale Ale has a far superior mouthfeel. Built to survive the time it was going to take to get this to market- I do think it would pair quite well with a bit, sweet plate of bbq ribs, but not having fun drinking it on it's own. Would much rather have one of the two flagships this is based on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A quite thick and hearty pale ale. Lots of malt in this one with a rather big flavor at only 6.5 % abv. Not bad, but somewhat over malty and thick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Sierra Nevada shaker pint. Pours a medium coppery amber with a one finger light tan head with great retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of biscuit and caramel malt, grassy and citrus hops. Flavor is citrus, lightly piney hops with a bit of resin, caramel malt with some biscuit, finishes with interesting light fruit juice mixed with citrus hops and biscuit malt. Medium bodied with hints of creaminess. Quite malty for a pale ale, and with the moderately dark copper color, more in an amber ale territory. Hops are muted, but have a good mixture of flavors. I really liked the finish with the combination of light fruit and hop flavors."
"O: FAR from a hop bomb, but it is an APA after all. The malt levels keep away any lingering bitterness, but never gets anywhere close to being overly sweet. Quite mild, actually. Definitely not what you'd expect from this collaboration, but it's still a solid pale ale"
""
""
""
"Overall OK, but not great. A bit heavy on the malt for a pale, hops are OK but not great, and blended together are also OK but not great for a pale. Again, both great breweries, and make great beers, but again and again and again, collaborations DON'T WORK!"
""
""
""
"O: A nice Pale Ale that is easily drinkable and enjoyable."
""
"O - A tasty, easy-drinkin' pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think that this beer would have been better canned or served on tap in order to give the hop bouquet a boost."
""
""
""
""
"Pours like a Pale Ale should with a copper hue and a thin rising head. The aroma is rather plain but decent enough with light pine, tea leaves, malt and some floral scents. The flavor is stronger on the barley malt notes, light roasted nut then a more hop finish of pine and whole cone. Better than average but below expectation from SN and 3F."

"Overall this is a solid beer and a classic pale ale with nice flavor, but with Sierra Nevada and Three Floyds making it I was very excited and expected some serious hop zing that would be a cross between a Zombie Dust and SN Pale Ale – instead it’s more like a Bass Ale. Sigh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: so far my least favorite from the variety pack. just muddied hop flavor and too much caramel in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure why this doesn't strike me as pleasantly as most Pale Ales. An aftertaste of spoiled fruit with the heel of dark loaf? From the 12 oz bottle in the Beer Camp 2014 boxed set, purchased in San Diego early August."
""
""
"This is a pretty good beer but being that it was a collaboration between the makers of SNPA and Zombie Dust, I was expecting more of a hops blast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly disappointed that these two breweries calloborated and came up short of expectations. Nothing bad or overly good about this beer. Average pale ale."
""
""
""
"o: Typical SN IPA, which is a compliment when fresh. Worth trying though."
""
""

"Served in a Pint glass"

"Part of the Beer Camp compilation. Collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Three Floyds. Pours a nice amber color with a good amount of white head. Has some west coast hops on the nose, grapefruit galore but still has that SN malt backbone. Flavor profile is almost the same way. Dry citrus/piney hops, a nice malt profile, solid mouthfeel, but here is my problem with this brew. I'm a huge FFF fan because they hop the living sh*t out of their beer. So when I was FFF, i totally expected a hop forward beer. Don't get me wrong, this is high in alpha hops but I would never guess, never ever, that this is a FFF brew. I feel like SN is just holding them down here. That being said, it's a solid pale ale and will hold me over till my next beer trade where I can get some real FFF!"
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is a nice brew for sure, it is a one two punch of hops and malts, but always stays thoroughly hoppy like a Sierra Nevada should. Raise it up!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, my least favorite beer camp so far. Hoppy unexciting amber."
"People can be quick to call pale ales' an IPA, however this is a prime example (in my mind) of the true difference between the two. Its a wonderful beer with bright floral and fruity notes. The balance between hops and malts is very present in this beer. I get strong notes of citrus and fruit, with a wonderful flavor of fresh herbs and malt to round it out. This beer is bold without a doubt, but it achieves it without throwing loads of hops in there. It adds wonderful bright fruit flavor with just the right amount of robust malts to give it a confident body. I really love this beer!"

"A nice beer, but one that is such a typical example of an American IPA (I know they call it a Pale, but c'mon now) that I'm having a hard time finding something to say about it. Medium orange-gold amber color. 1/2 inch off-white head. Hop-forward scent, with a slight malt backbone. Same flavor profile. Solid body. Good drinkability. Good overall. It's in the 12pack, so drink it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid offering, but well below my expectations, given the breweries involved and the description on the label. Each brewery is capable of producing better APAs on their own than this particular offering. Off to an unspectacular start at camp."

"Sierra Nevada Beer Camp Across America Chico King ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
"Least favorite in Beer Camp series.  Really disappointed that these two great APA brewers did not come up with something better.  I would rather drink a SNPA or Alpha King - both are better beers by a mile.  Way to malty for an APA, which pretty much muted the hops."

"O- A very good pale ale, but to be honest I think both Sierra Nevada and Three Floyd's both brew much better Pale Ale's then this collaboration."
""
""
""
""
"O: It takes a similar track as Alpha King. Well balanced with a fat malt body and an equally bold hop contribution. It's not as captivating as Alpha King, but it's a good big-boned American Pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a nice pale, nothing special but certainly worth the drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall I would've hoped for a bigger hop assault on a pale ale collab with FFF, none the less a tasty pale. Even though 2.5 months old at this point (and these cases hit town last week!) I would expect the hop tohold on if it was there über fresh. Tastes more like a Sierra Nevada brew than a FFF brew. Happy to have tried but not really that memorable for a collab between these two titans."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very flavorful for a pale ale and has lots of flavors from the hops without hardly any associated bitterness."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"The Verdict: Very good. Not a lot of depth but very solid and well balanced. There’s nothing spectacular here, but it is an excellent example of what a good beer should be."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a lot of love for this one, it seems. And off the first sip, I can certainly see why. The hop character seems muted for whatever reason. And a lot of malts seem to show. It seems almost nutty? It's just a mix that doesn't work. I was hoping that the negativity that some people were harboring towards Beer Camp, and this beer, would end up being misfounded. Unfortunately, the general consensus seems to fit the reality of the situation."
"Really just a masterful pale ale. Not sure why they emphasize these are hoppy breweries on the bottle and then deliver excellent balance, but the beer is great."
""
"O-For an American Pale that clocks in at 6.5% from these two APA master breweries, I am disappointed. I do give some points for going in a direction nobody probably saw coming, though."
"Overall, pretty good. I'd buy this if it was a permanent offering. Worth a try. Not sure why the low scores to be honest."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent well crafted beer but nothing to make it stand out. I also picked up some stale flavors."
"O: A very nice pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great for a pale ale. These are starting to run together though."
""
""
""
"Pours out a deep amber with a thinnish head. Aroma is strong with toasty malts and citrus hops. Kind of a toast bomb in the nose. The flavor is also big on toastiness. Not into that. I pick up some good caramel malts, nice citrus hops, fruity esters. The toast is still a little overbearing. Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit creamy. This is a good pale ale, but this is no SNPA. Can't improve upon perfection."
""
""
""
""
"Nothing particularly mind blowing, but certainly a delicious beer for the Pale Ale style."
"Overall, not what I expected, but really nice! Well-balanced and interesting."

"O: I was expecting a bit more hops from the label's description, but it's still a damn good quaff."

"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a hazy amber with a tight, quarter inch, bright white head. Clusters of web-like lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is non-existent - perhaps pale/biscuity malts and a hint of floral hops. Taste has a more earthy quality as well as trace of sweetness (maybe caramel). Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation. Overall, body is bit heavy and hop profile is a bit light. Didn't really do it for me."
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a semi translucent golden brown color with an inch of frothy white head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is floral and citrus hops as well as some bready malts.The taste is some lemon and lime upfront followed by a mix of piney and floral hops. Nice malt backbone. Finishes with more of the pine and floral hops as well as the sweet bready malts. Lots of carbonation with a slightly oily mouthfeel. Maybe almost too carbonated for a Pale Ale. This has a decent amount of hops to it. Overall, good beer but nothing special"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Well, was looking forward the most to this one since 3 floyds was involved. This is agood beer but nothing about it is over the top or special. Its soild, maybe because the bottle date is already 2 months old, this is already dying on me. In all, its good, but not great."
""
"Bottle from 12-pack packages on 5/15/14 (wtf?) and poured 7/29/14. Yikes quite a delay for a hoppy brew to be released. Pours clear orange copper colored with a big fluffy off white head. Aroma of generic and unexciting hops, some light malt, grass, pine. Flavor is decent with some sweet bready malts, mango, dry pine, and a slightly funky finish. Super dry, medium bodied, with plus carbonation. Decent enough beer but a bit disappointing. Sort of a bland version if SNPA."

"O: An alright beer, overall, though nothing really stands out about it. Beyond a lingering bitterness, the hop characters are all somewhat muted."
"A solid drinking pale ale. That's a good plan."
"Pours a nice medium amber, generous sized white head that laces nicely. Nose had some peculiar aromas that I found indescribable, almost an off-funk. Palate offered some good balance of malt to hops, some dryness, with good carbonation. Medium bodied. Slow drinking for a pale ale, for me at least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very drinkable pale ale, but not all that special. Nothing really stands out in is character to set it apart from the masses of pale ales in the market. I could easily drink this all day, but I would probably be thinking about what I could have had instead that would be more enjoyable/memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like it a lot, I just like my big hoppy beers within weeks of the package date not months. Despite early signs of aging effecting the beer it’s still super well made, but nothing like any of the hoppy offerings from 3F’s including their trademark Alpha King Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really interesting berry flavor, will have to see if this is what everyone else is getting too. It is subtle but interesting, I like the bready notes with the berry."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a terrible beer by any means, nothing offensive but it doesn't bring anything particularly interesting to the table. It's neither SNPA or Alpha King, but I interpret this to be a strange amalgamation of the two. It works alright, but not in a particularly outstanding way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Certainly not a bad beer but I found it to be a little disappointing/lackluster - I had higher expectations for the collaboration between these two excellent breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I can see why this is getting a mixed reaction, as I am sure many were expecting a very hop forward pale ale. It almost drinks like an English Pale Ale. Light, floral hops backed up by rich nutty maltiness."
""
""
"Overall: I have to be honest, when I saw that 3 Floyds and Sierra Nevada were collaborating, I was extremely excited. This beer is pretty disappointing due to the extremely high expectations I had. It would have undoubtedly been better if it were a little fresher - come on, Sierra Nevada, you should have brewed the hoppier collaborations right before packaging. This is a decent pale ale that isn't nearly as hoppy as I would have liked. I'm glad I tried it, but you're not missing much if you give this one a pass."
""
"Taste is bitter and hoppy, but with an unexpected caramel malt foundation, as well. I get a hint, somehow, too, of a rye-like spice underneath it all. Overall, not a bad pale ale, but one I'd bet would be vastly different if tasted a bit fresher."
""
""
""
""
"The hop aroma is not really there, but the basic classic American Pale and hop angle hits the palate solidly. Not mindblowing, just decent and simple balance."
""
"Poured on-tap at a Beer Camp tap takeover, the beer was served in a shaker pint. The beer is a crystal clear, orange-copper coloring with a fluffy, clingy, off-white head. Nose of subtle berry fruit, caramel, and hips bitterness. Flavors are tangy sweet and rich forward, with caramel roast and subtle bitter undertones. More of an English style Pale for me. Tangy sweet and peppery aftertaste, with a dry, slick finish."

"It's decent. You see 3 Floyds and expect magnificence, and this isn't it, but it's drinkable."
""
""
"O. I'm left slightly polarized by this one. On the one hand, it's a very good beer, with nice balance, solid flavors, and good presentation. On the other hand, it doesn't taste much like a modern Pale Ale. In fact, this reminds me a good bit of an amber or even a Sam Adams Boston Lager. Not assertively hopped, with a relatively mild flavor profile for the APA style. In short, I just don't think this quite fits into the APA category, at least not when you consider modern examples like Fat Head's Trail Head or Three Floyds Zombie Dust. A good beer overall, but as malt-forward as it is, it's more of an antiquated example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a fine APA worth seeking out, if not quite as stellar (or hoppy) as FFF Alpha King."
""
""
""
"Overall another winner from a ground breaking 12 pack. These all-star brewers delivered, Sierra should have taped the collaborations, I bet they had a great time brewing these gems."
""
"Cheers all"
""
""
""
"I was expecting more hops, but this turned out well."
""
""
""
"Aroma features orangey/citrusy notes with pine in the background. The hops are a bit subdued, but very well balanced and almost perfectly suited for a pale ale. Orange notes also predominate in the taste, but certainly not in an overpowering fashion, with very subtle tea flavors detectable in the aftertaste. This is once again very well balanced and completely in keeping with what I expect of the style. Mouthfeel is moderately full bodied with a nice but not overpowering level of carbonation. Overall I call this collaboration extremely well done. If this were a generally available brew, it would definitely be among my go to pale ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A pretty good pale ale, but not the hop bomb I originally expected. Has the maltiness of alpha king, but a way different hop profile."
""
"O. Not bad, not excellent. This PA goes head first to the pine/resin hop profile. While it is nice to see so someone go against the citrus trend, it's not balanced. The appearance is amazing but I think it falls short afterwards. I'm glad I was able to try one but unlikely to get another."
""
""
""
""
"Its malty-dry finish is toasty and lightly modestly bitter, carrying the balance of English bitter, but with American ingredients. We have become accustomed to American pale ale having a slight nod to the hops, more resembling IPA. However this collaboration remains malty- quite unlike each brewery involved."
"O) Decent brew... I enjoyed it... This was the 3 Floyds collaboration, but it seemed to have more of the characteristics of what I would expect from a SN release."
"O - Not at all what I expected - but then again most 3 Floyds beers I've had are curveballs. This brew has a unique blend of earthy, spicy, and savory hops flavors paired with a hearty malt bill that is reminiscent of English pale ales. The hops were especially surprising and reminded me a bit of what I remember Arctic Panzer Wolf tasting like."
""
""
"Overall, just meh. I feel that a Sierra Nevada/FFF collab should have been primo, and this isn't."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 5/15/2014. Pours slightly cloudy bright orange amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate caramel/bready malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, light toast, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, light toast, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of citrus/grassy hops and moderate caramel/bready malt sweetness; with a nice crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice and pleasant pale ale. Good balance and complexity of citrus/grassy hops and moderate caramel/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O - A very clean Pale Ale. Easy drinking, but not much in the way of hops. A very average beer."

"12 ounce bottle, part of the Beer Camp Across America 12-pack. Served in a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass, the beer pours a mostly clear amber color with about an inch frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like caramel and bready malt, nuts, and some light earthy/herbal hops. It tastes similar to the aroma, but there's also some light fruitiness noticeable. To me it's more malty than hoppy, maltier than I expect for a pale ale. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy, smooth and easy to drink. Moderate carbonation. It's not a bad brew at all, nice to try once anyway."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable beer, but very forgettable, as well. After the sip, the palate isn't left with much to remember."
"O: Not bad but in terms of being billed as a hoppy pale ale it didn't seem to follow up on that promise. A very balanced pale, maybe a little weighed down by the abv. Good but not great"

"A have heard so much about Three Floyds. But I will have to say this one was a bit of a disappointment. Someone said an English style Pale Ale. That's about right. Bass maybe, the carbonation on this one was a bit flat and there was virtually no aroma in the smell. More malt than hop forward. I have had a few pale ales lately that have done very little for me. I can say that this one is right in line. Maybe I just don't care for this style. This was my first one and out of the pack because I had heard so much about Three Floyds and I am sure this is not as representative as their original stuff, but this beer was a solid alright. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. On the the next one!"

"O - If they billed this as an English IPA, I would score it higher. But as a pale ale, it falls short. The hop bill is a little dates and I'm not a big fan of sweeter crystal or caramel malt in pales."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a more cloudy amber/honey colored with finger width foamy head. There is a small amount of head retention and lacing. Mild hoppy, apple aroma. Grassy hops hit you at first taste, you get a heavy bitterness, followed by a malty taste at the very end. There is a nice touch to the bitter aftertaste with hints of apple. It seems to be a well balanced beer and one I would definitely be up to purchasing if it was a full time beer from SN."
""
"O- So it did not really meet expectations for a collaborative pale ale from perhaps the two breweries who make the style best. It is refreshing, has a nice mouthfeel, and is balanced although it might be a little too soft on the hops with them really only being prominent on the finish."
""
""
""
""
"The taste begins as it smells with a good roasted malt presence and moderate sweetness that is displaced by the bitter hop bite at the end. The hops are not floral. They are earthy all around."
""
""
""
"So review is subject to review."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an amber hue with a full head that trails down the glass. The smell had a ton of different fruits in the nose. Orange and lemon were there, but so was banana and pineapple. The taste was also really nice with those fruit flavors mingling nicely with the toasted flavor from the malt. Overall it made for an interesting pale ale with a smooth middle and a nice crisp finish. The mouthfeel was also nice. Light but not too thin. Definitely a fan."
""
""
"Poured a very nice deep, cloudy amber with three fingers of fluffy white head that slowly receded to a cap of white leaving copious amounts of lacing down the glass. A very nice looking pale ale. Scents of yeasty white bread at first, giving way to tropical fruit, mostly light pineapple-like aromas, orange flesh, orange peel, a bit of overripe fruit, and some pale malt in the background. The overall impression of the aroma is light, but layered with fruity and malty aromas dominating. Nice, though not as good as expected. Flavor begins with a nice balanced hop bitterness with notes of pine resin, toasty and sweet pale malt flavors, and citrus peel. The middle opens with more citrus peel flavors, some floral and earthy hop notes, hints of pine resin and a bit of toasted malt. Finish is medium-dry with notes of bitter grapefruit and citrus peel, hints of pine resin, some floral and earthy hop flavors and a hint of toasted malt with a very light alcohol presence. A nice hoppy pale ale flavor profile with an abundance of fruity and resinous flavors, leaning more towards citrus peel and pine resin, but balanced with some faint floral and earthy flavors and a bit of malt. Quite nice, though a bit one note overall. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with low carbonation, and a smooth, slightly slick feel. Quite easy to drink and very pleasant. Overall this is a decent pale ale that reminds me a great deal of Sierra Nevada's classic. The 3 Floyds influence is hard to discern however and overall it does just feel like a slightly different take on SNPA."

""

"It's not palate obliterating like Dreadnaught, but shit, it's not meant to be. To me it's riffing on Sierra Nevada's classic granddaddy status, especially considering the name. This is a retro early 80's pale ale that would have blown any of us away back then."
"Yet another mediocre beer. I've now gone through a quarter of the box and haven't had a good one yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"another beer i really liked from the box, although it may not be the most challenging style, i dont think that was the intention with any of these beers. its a very hoppy amber tinted pine forward pale ale, which i could happily drink ten of in a sitting and not think twice about it. wish it was a regular release for that reason. crystal clear but ambery for a pale ale, some nice special red malt in here or something, giving it this glowing color. bubbles are everywhere, fast paced but not hurried, collecting into a half inch of white head. pine and bitterness in the nose, a lot like sierra nevadas normal pale ale in that regard, but its a lot more vibrantly hoppy in the taste, where the pine needle complexion really comes out. i liked this as it warmed too, malt balance shows up more readily, and the carbonation never dissipates out of suspension, which i always appreciate. good to the last drop. again, not supposed to be a real mind bender i dont think, its for outside summer drinking and appreciating, without requiring any sort of cognitive dissertation on it for it to be understood and admired. i hope to see this one come around again, great use of some classic west coast hopping!"

"O: What happened here? Big dissappointment for me. Not the ""King of Alpha Hops", rather a ""Joker of Malts"". Would like to try a fresher bottle or on tap."
""
""
"bottle pour into mini pilsner glass. smell fruity, orange peel, grapefruit, carmel. taste is slightly sweet, fruits such as mango, strawberry, citrus, and carmel notes. Some spice essence coming through the nose, with it's complexity, and richness. mouthfeel is medium bodied. I could see this one paring nice with mild spice dishes, such as kabob, and mild smokey meats, and cheeses."
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, earth, herbal hop, and slight caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with earth and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a hop profile that is quite earthy all around."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours into a standard pint glass a clear burnt orange with a half finger white head that left a few splashes of lace as it settled.Aromas of mild fruity hops and caramel malts,there is light resin to them.Flavors are fruity but with not much pine resin or bitterness,a caramel/biscuit malt backbone more than stands up to the hops it might be the main flavor component.I expected a little more here,it's not terrible by any means maybe just a little lackluster."
""
""
"Overall: an interesting pale ale. It tastes like they were going for a whole, fresh hop beer here, which can be good, although the overall effect is a bit muddled."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This was almost a first rate Pale Ale. I am not sure why this is so full bodied with such strong malts. What I can taste of the hops is outstanding, and while I am okay with a balanced Pale Ale, I think this is a little out of whack on the malty side. Still, quite delicious."
""
""
""
"This is a well balanced beer. This would make an AWESOME session ale . That being said, it is definitely not a signature IPA that you'll braggin' about at your next beer club meeting. Overall, well done brewers!"
"O - nothing spectacular here, but it fits the American Pale Ale style to a T. I'd prefer a Three Floyds Alpha King or a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale over this, but this is still really good. I do think I expected something more outside of the box with this one...it's definitely missing a wow factor. I also feel unmet expectations are hurting this beer's overall ratings."
""
""
""
"Clear copper pour with a two-finger white head and lots of carbonation. Big floral hop aroma. Initial taste is strong, spicy and bitter. Can taste grass and light citrus backed by a caramel malt sweetness that balances the flavor out. Definitely has that Sierra Nevada hop flavor. Finishes with long lasting slightly grassy bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
"O: Well, I never thought that either FFF or SN would put out an East Coast style IPA, but I do believe that is what we have here. Not a bad beer, just a lackluster one considering the pedigree of the brewers behind it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There will always be high expectations with two breweries such as 3 Floyd's and Sierra Nevada coming together to make a Pale Ale. This is really sub-par for what it should have been. Why not just do a 50/50 blend of Zombie Dust and SNPA?"

"O- Very decent. Kind of like an SNPA/Torpedo hybrid."

"The aftertaste is amazing. This stuff is very creamy for the style, yet not too much so. The bitter roastiness you are left with ... I just want it to last all day. I probably will not have another beer or anything else to eat for a little while after this to let it seep in. Nice!"
""
""

""
""
"Pours a medium amber, maybe a bit on the darker side. Appears to have some haze, but the color might be making it look less transparent than it is. Medium head, a couple shades of tan off white. Fine foam shot through with some larger bubbles. Pretty good retention, just a bit of lacing. The aroma is mild. There's some pine and citrus hoppiness along with a dose of caramel-ish malt. Hops win out with a mix of grapefruit, pine, lemon, tangerine, pineapple. It's nice enough. Taste is similarly mild with more hop than malt character. The malt is just a background of caramel with some light toastiness. On the dry side of things. Hops are pine resin, tangerine, lemon, berry and pineapple. It's all pleasant and quite mild. A little bit of spice in the finish. Nothing wrong with it, but eh. Mouthfeel is pretty standard pale ale fare, maybe a touch creamier than most. Decent enough pale ale but quite boring. I don't get it. I was already fully aware that these two breweries could make decent easy drinking pales. This feels like a waste, particularly as a single bottle in a mixed 12-pack. It's like they set out to craft a flagship pale ale for a brewery starting up in the '80s. Beer doesn't get much safer than this."

"Overall - Disappointed with the taste after drinking an Alpha King and a Zombie dust earlier in the week and a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale a week earlier. For being brewers of some of the best hopped beers I was expecting more. The taste wasn't nearly as good as any of those beers I just mentioned and to be called Chico King, very upsetting! All and all the beer as an OK hopped beer that has a mint of an amber style pale ale."
""
""
"This is actually a very tasty APA. It doesn't live up to the promise heralded by two of the premier APA brewers on the planet (SN Pale Ale; FFF Zombie Dust), but it's a very, very drinkable and crushable summer drink. People looking for an absolute hop bomb should look somewhere else."
""
""
""

"O- Good beer. I think I was expecting more due to the hype of the Beer Camp buzz. I will enjoy the rest of the bottle now."
""
"Pours a darker orange with big rocky offwhite colored head, spray of lace down half the glass. Smell: sweet orange citrus, floral, resiny, caramel. Taste: toffee, candied citrus, resinous, overripe apricot. Ok. Mix pack just got here this week but this is marked as bottled 2 months prior; that's kind of a bummer."

"Overall 4.0: Great Pale Ale. Hops are restrained and are a perfect complement to the chosen grains. Outstanding balance at all taste levels and just a really refreshing, master-crafted beer."

"Golden pour with a thick creamy foam head that leaves curtains of lace. Smell is rather malt forward with a hint of citrus pith. Tastes lightly citrus. Mild bitterness. Very light sweetness but is dry with a good carbonation and a medium light body. This one isn't as good as anything I've had in the pale ale category from 3 Floyds namely Alpha King and and Zombie but then again it's an eminently quaffable brew that finishes lightly bitter and dry with a crafted body that holds together well. Not outstanding but good nonetheless."
"Disappointed that two fine breweries produced such a meh brew. Does not bode well for the rest of the 12-pack."

"On tap at PreFunk as part of Beer Camp 2014. Pours out with a nice amber body with small creamy head, a bit dark for a pale ale. Silky, slippery body and mouth feel. Light malt, bready, some sourdough taste, lightly hopped. Finish is dry, dusty and chalky."
"12 oz bottle. Pours clear copper with a big off-white head that has good retention and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is malty with a decent amount of caramel malts and the classic Sierra yeast smell. There is a bit of grapefruit and some mango present as well, but not particularly hoppy. The taste also has a decent amount of caramel malt as well as a bit of grapefruit. Finish has a bit of bitterness and a lingering caramel that isn't all that pleasant. Medium-high carbonation. Medium body."
""
"Pours mostly amber capped by a two and half finger billowing off-white head. Excellent retention, plenty of sticky lacing. Floral accents & some very light general tropical fruit notes. Opens with light grapefruit, floral notes, and touches of citrus. Caramel joins in midpalate. Finishes with citrus rind bitterness. Very smooth silky body, paired with the perfect level of carbonation. Very easy drinking. Overall a solid pale ale."
