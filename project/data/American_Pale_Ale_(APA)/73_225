Decent flavor, easy drinking but just not the pop I was expecting.  Too average for what I was hoping for, just wanted more flavor and bite.","hotpauko","Apr 03, 2015"

Maybe fresher, or on a summer day? Clean mouthfeel in general, gently lingering flavors (unfortunately some bit off), easy drinking. Overall ok, but FL can do a lot better!

The beer itself is a dark copper color that borders on dark orange. The beer smell has floral hop notes, malt sweetness, and a little bit of earthy notes as well. The malt sweetness and the floral notes mix very well together and very difficult to separate but compliment each other such as that it gives off  a nice sweet floral smell. The smell also has a slight yeasty note that comes off as a sweet and bready note. The taste is a bit different from the smell. The taste has a much stronger hop flavor which is earthy and herbal instead of floral and the malt is barely noticeable while the yeast note is stronger. The mouthfeel is fairly medium bodied but on the heavier side. The beer finishes fairly smooth with a bit of carbonation. Overall, a pretty good pale ale worth getting.","HattedClassic","Sep 30, 2014"

Great Lakes is very reasonably priced in my area so that's what keeps me coming back to this beer.","Bone53","Apr 23, 2014"

The taste is clean and slightly sweet from malt. A little biscuit and a little fruit.... then the hops kick in, flavorful, juicy, bitter hops. They give a nice backbone to the beer. Full in body, with medium carbonation. This one is a treat...a solid, clean, and very drinkable east coast pale ale.","Suds","Apr 12, 2014"

Smell is quite malt forward with caramel and a slight bit of hops in the nose but it is very slight. Taste is also pretty malt forward with not much hops at first but they come through as it goes down the throat. This as actually a pretty well balanced APA as far as taste. Mouthfeel is thicker than I would have expected with nice carbonation. Overall I'm pretty surprised that I liked this beer so much. It really is very balanced.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 13, 2013"

4.07,3,4.25,4,4,4,4.25," The flavor is a very good mix of malts with more of a German toasted perhaps vienna flavor with mild herbal and pine hop flavors following with some mild orange rind accents. The flavor of malt is pretty well balanced with the hops with a generally clean yeast taste very nice dry finish with no alcohol in the taste to speak of. Overall this is a different take on the pale style, with more german type munich toastiness and more herbal/noble type flavor than straight citrus, but it is very drinkable and well worth repeat tastes","Slatetank","Oct 01, 2013"

3.93,-0.5,3.25,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall, what we found to be most enjoyable about this brew was its simplicity through the taste and aroma, and its ease of drinkability. While we’ve had this beer many times in the past, and enjoyed it, today it seems to be striking our palates at a funny angle. The aroma and taste both seem to be wrought with a curious plastic component. This actually faded quite a bit with warmth, but it did simultaneously reveal a heavy malt base, which tended to overwhelm the hop components. These were also a bit more bittering and puckering than we remember, as well, but in the end it didn’t stop of from enjoying this drink and leaving it with fond thoughts yet again.","TheBrewo","Sep 20, 2013"

Weed like with lots of bread and nutty malt character. Caramel. Citrus is there but faint, a little floral and herbal, a hint of tropical fruit but doesn’t quite stretch out. Taste is grassy, very nutty , herbal, with lots of malt rolling sweetly over the hay like palate. Cracker, biscuit, and a little bit of sweet orange. Finishes crisp and dry with just enough bitter hop oil and sweet honey on a cracker. This is a very big malt Pale Ale that drinks lovely and smooth.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Golden orange, the color of honey, crystal clear with a medium-thick white head that dissipates pretty quickly leaving some delicate lacing. Smells of clean malts with slight bitter hops in the background. Taste follows nose; clean and smooth malts with a crisp bitter hop finish that rounds off a great-tasting beer.

I almost get some lagered notes. There are additionally some bready qualities in the scent, followed by a mellow earthy (and somewhat mossy) background. The flavor was not at all what I was expecting. The lagered scent follows through in the taste, but is followed by very rich (medium darkness) malt flavor. There is medium sweetness and a crisp dry finish. The hops are interesting in this beer. Not a large profile, but most present in flavor (as opposed to bitterness or smell). I mostly taste earthiness (fresh cut grass and moss). There is a bit of fruit here too, but not a typical citrus hop bomb. The fruity qualities are subtle, smooth, and complex. The mouth feel is typical and well-executed for an APA: a smooth texture, medium carbonation, and medium body. Overall this is a fine brew. It's not my favorite APA, but it turned out being quite drinkable and interesting.","lunarbrew","Apr 09, 2013"

Color was a classic shade of deep-amber with NE-quality clarity and should be the standard for Lovibond in the style. Nose reminded me of just how fresh this was, courtesy of Sunday's visit to The Fridge. The grapefruit scent cut right through my burgeoning sinus headache and made my eyes pop. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was about as perfectly balanced between hops and malt as I have experienced for a while. You listening, Lazy Magnolia, with your overly hopped Deep South P.A.? Finish was semi-dry as compared to AIPAs which are my go-to, but perhaps dry when compared to others in the style. I am not a style maven, but I know what I like. I like this beer.

3.93,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy golden orange color, with a thin but sticky cream-colored head. The aroma is certainly hop-forward, with notes of grassy hops and sweet citrus. The flavor is not bright and fresh, but it isn't tame either, with a dull orange rind and herbal bitterness being contrasted against a bready malt sweetness. The fine carbonation works well with the solidly resinous (but not overdone) body. Overall, this beer has substantial body and flavor, but it is also nicely drinkable.","devilben02","Jun 27, 2012"

Taste of grapefruit, biscuit, pine, floral, honey, orange, caramel, and herbal spiciness. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange, pine, biscuit, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great malt flavor balance with bitterness.

Flavor is crisp and hoppy, but not overbearing. Citrus notes are present, along with lively carbonation, followed by a clean finish. Quite a palatable pale ale, which is a style I'm not especially fond of, so take my numeric rating with a grain of salt.","MaximalC","Feb 16, 2012"

Strangely, it tasted and smelled just like the wort I boiled a few weeks ago in my first home brew batch. Almost as if the yeast did not get all the way through this most recent batch. Essentially tasted like slightly bitter malt extract. Not what I remember from my previous experiences with this living in Michigan, as it was one of my favorites. So I downgraded to 4.1 for now (was one of my top beers before). Would like to try one more time to get things straight.

The taste is a wonderful mixture of malty roasted flavors with a slight overshadowing of wonderful floral and citrus hops. The flavor is extremely rich and well balanced. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean and light bodied. This is a wonderful pale ale that would be great at anytime of year, but especially to welcome spring and summer in.

4.66,18,5,4,5,4,5,"Great Lakes Burning River pours a crystal clear golden-orange color with a large white head. Smells sweet and citrusy thanks to the cascades. Hop taste through and through.. Similar to the nose (sweet and citrusy) with a bit more of a punch and a decent hoppy bitterness on the end. Hoppy sweetness and bitterness lingers in the aftertaste begging for another sip. This is one of my top 5 APA's if you haven't had it. Get it!","JustinMatthew","Nov 10, 2011"

I missed the chance to have this on tap at TJ's recently, so I'm glad to have a chance to enjoy this. Beer pours a gorgeous transparent amber color. The nose is a bit muted, but there's a very pleasant light citrus nose followed by some malt. The taste in this is definitely on the malty side, although the initial taste showcases some nice hops. The finish is way sweet. The mouthfeel is very light and creamy, with the maltiness mentioned previously hanging around. Overall this is a nice beer. I'd like more hops, but, this is an APA and not an IPA, and it' in line with the style. A good beer bye and bye.","Retail1LO","Sep 20, 2011"

3.88,-1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This brew pours the standard pale amber color with two fingers of head that quickly drops down. The aroma has some nice hops over some pale malts, but it's a little weak compared to what I'd prefer. The taste is upfront hoppy, with plenty of bitter grapefruit rind to go along with it. The mouthfeel is nice, it's bubbly on the way down the throat, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, a solid brew, and one that I'd keep in rotation if it were local.","shand","Aug 28, 2011"
4.27,8.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability – This went down extremely well but it is a rather big beer so be prepared for that.

4.25,7.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The Great Lakes Burning River Pale Ale is another great offering by the Cleveland Brewery. The appearance is a rich clear copper color. The carbonation is very good that led to at least a finger think head....which laced thoughout the draw. The smell is dominated by pine, but there is a touch of smoke or roast. The taste is very good. There is a good balance of hop and malt that keep the beer from being too bitter. The taste is slightly down graded because I did taste some Alcohol which I though was interesting cuz its not a high ABV. The mouth feel is fine...certainly could session without question. Overall is is a very good beer.","WoodBrew","Aug 06, 2011"
4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Though not as mind-explodingly good as Edmund Fitzgerald or Dortmunder, this is nevertheless a great tasting pale, that is light and crisp enough to quench a thirst on a humid afternoon, yet tasty enough to sit and ponder over.","JohnnyBarman","Aug 03, 2011"
4.33,9.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear copper color with stark white head and some decent lace. The aroma is of a caramel malt backbone with a big piney and citrus hop characteristic to it. The taste follows suit with a caramel malt backbone and a bitterness due to citrus and piney hops throughout. The beer is bitter thoughout but does have balance with the malt. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated with a dry finish. Overall a very soild pale ale. The tatse is balanced and consistent throughout. Very good beer.","goblue3509","Jul 31, 2011"

4.23,7.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O - I really enjoyed this brew. I have become to enjoy Pale ales as I age. I didnt pay much attention to them when I first started drinking quality brews. GLBC have a lot of great tasting brews coming out of Cleveland,Ohio. They always leave me satisfied and I always find myself buying more. Burning River is another one of my favorites and is a true quality Pale ale and brew experience thanks to GLBC.","BradtheGreat7","Jul 24, 2011"

Hop amount is just where I like it. Solid bready malts as well. I like the taste a lot too. Great balance going on here. Again, very refreshing. Mouthfeel is right where it should be.

3.8,-3.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O - Very nice summer beer - or anytime beer really - that is simple to enjoy. It's not one that you need to sit down and really chew over all the flavors. Yet it still gives enough to make this very enjoyable.","Eldalonde","Jun 29, 2011"
3.8,-3.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours clar with a golden/amber hue. Thick head and takes a few seconds longer then usual to settle. Has a rather light hop aroma with a lingering hint of caramel and hidden sweetness that is hard to place. If this was a blind tasting you wouldn't know it was a Pale ale till you took your first taste. The hops makes its presents know but then leaves and you are left you the hops coating the tounge, littl more bitter then your usual pale ale.","elginirishpunk","Jun 29, 2011"
4.38,10.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"If you don't get Great Lakes you should definitely do a trade to get this. It's an American Pale Ale at its best, and tastes totally unique at the same time.","orourkebr","Jun 22, 2011"
3.51,-11.1,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"O-> This looked and smelled a lot more like an Amber upon first inspection. Only the taste really indicates otherwise. That being said, I really enjoyed my first GL brew. It was a solid American Pale Ale that was very well balanced and refreshing. Perhaps the American Pale Wheat Ale kick I've been on lately threw me off on the smell and appearance on this one at first but that is beside the point. I could quaff the shit out of this brew even on the hottest of days. Cheers!","Fluke828","Jun 22, 2011"
3.78,-4.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Medium bodied and very hop forward with a dry, bitter character up front that lingers over the sweet malt into a spicy, dry finish.

Hints of grapefruit and orange peel balanced by a sweet caramel malt backbone that gives off notes of toast and biscuit.","corby112","Jun 22, 2011"
4.23,7.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Seriously, it looks good and tastes great. My neighbor really enjoyed it and I was very impressed as well. Pale Ales are very obscure to me but this had a nice flavor, mouthfeel and everything else to make it a really good beer.

3.94,-0.3,5,3.5,4,4,4,"A good APA. I enjoyed it, but probably wouldn't buy it again (unless it was on sale). I tend to lean towards APAs with a bit more maltiness. When I want hops, I'll get an IPA.","deadonhisfeet","Jun 14, 2011"
3.41,-13.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O – Good solid APA. Very drinkable. Nothing to make it stand above other APA’s but this makes a great cold brew on a hot summer day.","GallowsThief","Jun 12, 2011"

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The taste was similar to a Sierra Nevada. However, the flavor was a little more distinct and pronounced. This had a nice smoothness.

4.38,10.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O - This is a very well balanced beer. Probably my favorite pale ale, and an easy go to beer as it's local. I've yet to have a GLBC beer that I don't enjoy.","BigDRS","May 31, 2011"

Nice ruby-golden color with a white head. Very hoppy aroma, some light grass and fruits from the malt as well.

4.3,8.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice dark copper with a a tight 1 finger head that smears and laces around the glass. Big sweet hops hit the nose, very fruity mix of cherries and berries with a bold malt and bitter hops. So good on the tongue, the malts give almost a woody, and chocoatly taste blended well with distinct hop presence but not overwhelming, bready and sweet. Light to medium on the feel, low carbonation. Overall, this is awesome, its a little bigger than your average APA, with a little more breadiness and a solid hop balance.","gabedivision","May 19, 2011"
3.71,-6.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a deep yellow orange with a big pale tan head that falls to a thigh blanket. Great lacing. Smells of citrus hops and sweet malt. The taste is not overly complex like the nose. It's mild citrus hops with a sweet malt backbone. Nice lingering fruit with slightly dry aftertaste. Sweetness makes it's appearance after half a glass. Really pretty refreshing on a whole. Body is light/medium with average carbonation level. Overall a nice brew a little on the sweet side if you're drinking several.","ThirstyBird","May 14, 2011"
4.3,8.9,5,5,4,4,4,"what is most impressive to me is that they managed to mask a 6%abv so damn well. one could easily approach this as a session beer only to realize five beers late they can barely get off the couch","spitInTheOcean","May 13, 2011"

There also seems to be an alcohol and yeast taste in the background while some hops are in the forefront of the taste. The aftertaste is floral hops and an orange citrus taste that is not too over powering.

It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this wasn't a bad brew, but it also wasn't that great either. The skunky aspect on this one hurt this brew overall.

A heavy pour into the center of the glass gives a big 3" of frothy bubbly beige head that lingers pretty well. The head leaves a bunch of spotty chunky lace on the glass. Smell is some soft orangey citrus hop and milky smoothness, like a semi-bitter orange creamcicle. Taste is mild and subdued, much like the nose but dialed back a few big notches, plus a little diacetyl and maybe vanilla. Orange creamcicle indeed. A little sharp pine hop also tries to fight through and, although it is very minor, it stands out quite easily and I wonder if the beer would be better off without it.

3.76,-4.8,4,3,4,4,4,"Picked this up at a great beer store, Save-On Tobacco & Beverage in Mentor, Ohio. Clear orange-yellow pour with a nice head and decent lacing. Very odd nose for a pale ale. Kind of earthy and salty with none of the typical perfumy, floral pale smell I love. Really had to strain to get anything remotely hoppy. The taste was much better than the smell. Lots of caramel malt with a touch of fruitiness and just enough bitterness to balance it out. Great, slightly chewy mouthfeel and highly drinkable if you can get past the nose.","beerdrifter","Jul 27, 2010"
3.78,-4.3,4,3.5,4,3,4,"I had this on tap at a local bar. The color was a clear amber with very little foam. There was a mild hops aroma, with no malt in the smell.

A typical pale ale, very drinkable.","sonata2008","Jul 26, 2010"

This has no real importance, but this beer tends to bring that memory bubbling to the surface. (Seriously, don't swim in the Wabash.) It pours a clear copper topped by a tall bit of thick, light ecru froth, which leaves some decent lacing behind as it subsides. The nose is pretty unspectacular, with notes of caramel, maple syrup, and a light touch of hops (not citrus, not floral, just hops in general). The taste comprises a slight bit o' citrus, some bitterness, and a solidly bready caramel backbone. The body is a light medium, with light carbonation and a crisp finish. Not bad, though I wish the smell were a little better.","TMoney2591","Jun 21, 2010"

A steady stream of carbonation bring up a citrusy nose of Pacific Northwestern hops. Flavor is typical APA- slightly sweet, bready light malts up front, grapefruit rind citrusy hops off the back. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a long hop aftertaste. Pretty typical American Pale Ale here- just about every brewery makes one, and honestly, you oughta be drinking the one your local makes- it's fresher that way. If I lived in Cleveland, I'd definitely be rockin' with this one.","shadow1961","May 23, 2010"
3.73,-5.6,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a clear, pale amber color with a large head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Plenty of hop aroma with hints of citrus and pine. The caramel aroma of the malt starts to make an appearance as it warms. The flavor is too one dimensional to warrant a higher score. As it is, it features the hops but lacks suitable malt balance. A good body for a hoppy pale ale. Nice carbonation and texture. A good hoppy drinker. A little more malt would be nice.","morimech","May 12, 2010"

Looks great in the glass, coppery, orange in color. This is probably the clearest pale ale I have ever seen. Small, abundant bubbles make an inch of white head that dissipates leaving no noticeable lacing. Tastes of bittering hops, dry and spicy. Faint citrus, but mostly clean, dry bitterness. Feel is good, if a bit thin. Excellent carbonation gives way to a dry finish. This is a very drinkable Pale Ale. I find it very refreshing, and the 6% ABV means I could enjoy a bunch of them without ending up face down on the floor.

Clear amber brown with a swift lightening into orange hues, close to yellow at the outer rims, squeaky clean and transparent. Open and gregarious nose of mandarin orange, toffee, brownies and a counter-balance of rye, grains and witch hazel, suggestion of yellow apple, apricot, peach fruit, not crafted for complexity, rather for consistent harmony. Medium-bodied, solid and barrel-chested, moves with deliberation through the mouth. Fairly active carbonation, however, doesn't break up much of the density. Much hoppier here with grassy notes, grapefruit along with the orange zest, grainy even in texture. The cocoa, mocha powder back into the chorus, more regular "white bread" here than rye.

There's a very nice bitterness to the flavor, it's slightly sweet at first, some toasty, biscuit-like malts make up the backbone, becomes slightly medicinal and dry on the finish. Nice use of bitter hops on this one, but missing some hop citrus flavor that I love out of APAs. Medium bodied, nice crisp carbonation. This is very drinkable, reminds me a lot of SNPA.

The feel is full and the aftertaste lingers with the hops at the fore. There's also a little bit of tannin-like feel to the finish. Good stuff...and for what it's worth I got this in Great Lakes Sampler and this is the least favorite of the beers it contains and it's nice to find a sampler without the ubiquitous IPA and Belgian-styled-inspired-copied ale in the mix.","saradad","Feb 12, 2009"

Got a little of the grapefruit zest in the first sip as well as the bitterness of the hops. It left my mouth coated after the first sip and had a lingering aftertaste.

This smells sweet with a hoppy profile of pine and some buiscuty malts. This could give my old stand by Sierra Nevada PA a run for its money. SN is very one dimensional in the hop profile and lack of malt,while Burning river is very balanced,with hops conquering the weaker malt in the end. This has a fruity/citrusy middle that adds that third dimension that really puts this one into a league of its own. Creamy and medium bodied with just the right texture and carbonation.

I mean.. maybe it's because I'm a little sick but I think I pick up on some peanut butter in the taste. Interesting how that works. The bittering presence is right for the style but decreases the drinkability a little bit for me.. it doesnt seem to fit with the rest of the nice medium/heavy mouthfeel and otherwise it's like the beer is yelling out at you to drink it. Unfortunately it's that bittering presence that sort of ruins it for me..

4.33,9.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a golden/squash color with a thin head. Lacing is surprisingly persistent. The smell is well balanced between the sweet malty notes and the punch of hops. The taste is silky smooth, especially for a pale ale. The slightly bitter, hop heavy, finish remains in your mouth for quite a while. The finish is a great counter to the exceptionally well balanced taste of the beer as you first drink it. The hops are never overpowering and, instead, work well with the malt and yeast notes to make an exceptionally drinkable beer. Very smooth, I could easily drink a lot of these in the course of a night. Great beer.","sundevilstudent","Aug 08, 2008"
4.08,3.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer has a beautiful color and just enough carbonation to keep the bubbles rising. The color is a brilliant orangish amber in the late afternoon sunshine. For a pale ale, the aroma is subtle, but betrays the brew's hoppy character, which really bursts on the palate as a floral blossoming of flavor. A lovely smooth silky texture makes it slide languidly down the back of the tongue, leaving a wonderful bitter accent at the finish. The bitter aftertaste leaves a clean lasting freshness in your mouth. A truly lovely beer.","jushoppy2beer","Aug 05, 2008"

Being in North East Ohio, the beers from Great Lakes Brewing are always readily available and for that I am extremely thankful. Burning River is amber and copper in color, pours with ample head and leaves a nice trail of lacing as I empty my pint glass. The aroma is bursting with hop flavors comparable with most IPA's. Pine and citrus notes are further detected. The flavor is everything a pale ale should be, well hopped with abundant malts. This beer is always an enjoyable experience.

Smell is mostly the moderate citrus hops with a significant caramel malt background in the smell. The taste starts with a slight hop bit before giving way to the caramel malts. There was also a definite spice presence in there as well and the finish had the slightest pine hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was light to medium with decent carbonation and the finish was actually on the crisp side of things with less hop bitterness than I'm used to. The drinkability is very high on this one as the hop profile is pretty tame and the mouthfeel is crisp and clean.

It is assertive, but it also doesn't cross the lines into other bigger beers like an IPA, and I think it is really nice and refreshing. The flavor profile is a good balance of bitter hops and sweet malt. I get more citrus than pine in the flavor profile that is balanced quite well with the almost bready malt.

Poured a beautiful clear, rusty copper color. Noticed tons of carbonation bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass. Beer was topped off by a solid inch and a half head that was super white. Head had great retention and left huge amounts of sticky white lace behind. Smell was of floral hops, minor citrus notes, and tons of sweet malt and bread. Taste was quite good as well. A nice mild hoppiness balanced almost perfectly with plenty of sweet malt. Also noticed slight hints of yeast, orange peel. Seemed a bit grainy. Finished rather smooth with a bit of bitterness.

The peanut butter flavor emerges again on the tongue with a bit of a hop bite, but is quickly taken over by some caramel malt. Aftertaste is actually pretty dry with a bit of a grassy flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good carbonation feel, but the bubbles are non-existant to the eye. Much more of a malty pale ale than a hoppy pale ale. Great Lakes makes amazing stuff.

To the nose there was not much bouquet, a soft malty base and some slight citrus. The taste was fuller and smokier at the outset than I would have expected from the smell (maybe they really did want to capture something of the old burning river), and there was definitely a hint of lime in the aftertaste.

The aroma is rich and complex-- warm malt scent, fresh hops and a hint of spice and earthiness. It's perhaps a little more full bodied than most APAs with relatively low carbonation but just enough to tingle in the mouth. The taste is excellent, full and well balanced. You taste sweet malts, tart hops a bare spark of alcohol and a perfect yeasty bite in the aftertaste, but none steps on the others.

The same notes are there, but every flavor is toned down a bit in comparison to what I found on the nose. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth.

Dominant is floral hops with some citrus; malt is evident more than other APAs I have tried although hops still prevail. Pleasant bitterness. Moderate carbonation and medium mouthfeel.

Couldn't say much about appearance for this reason, my guess is a typical IPA yellow/ orange that isn't transparent b/c of the strong smell. I could smell the strong hop element, most apparent of anything else. Has a good body to it, a certain crispness that is associated to pale ales, but this was a little too harsh for me. The strength of the hops and the 6.00 abv took me off guard. Leaves a bitterness from these two elements that I didn't find very pleasant, so an average score for drinkability.

The flavors are superbly balanced in this one. A not unpleasant mineral taste lingers for just a second. The mouthfeel is doughy and medium bodied. Quite nice. More than adequate lacing down the sides of the glass, too. Drinkability: very high. If the price were comparable, Id pick this one over SNPA (the extra hoppiness of this pale ale gives it a slight edge over that champ in my book).

Flavor was a bit on the flat side, as this beer could have benefited from higher carbonation to liven up the taste. Flavors of hops and malt, with traces of citrus, and a tea like finish. Not bad, but like I said, the addition of more carbonation would really kick this brew up a notch. Decent mouthfeel. I'd have another, but not before trying something else.

The caramel malt dances lightly in the background. The hop carries through as a light bitter in the background. Very nice flavor as well. The feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation.

For being hopped soley by cascades this one has a nice flavor. Citrusy, mainly grapefruit and lemon, but not overpowering. The sweet malts balance this brew well.

Aroma is very enticing, with citrusy grapefruit and orangepeel, some pine cone, and a solid caramel malt background. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Very smooth. Taste is well balanced, with lots of citrusy hops and bready caramel malt sweetness. Very smooth, with a slightly bitter citrusrind finish and aftertaste.

Smell is a real treat; strong citrus hop scent followed by any fruit you care to conjure up while you're taking your whiff. Pears, apircots, apples, grapefruit... the whole damn fruit basket. Nice fruity malt flavor for sure. Enough already. The taste is also strong citrussy bitter hops, but that's not the entire picture, as in some beers. The point of this beer wasn't to make is overly hoppy, but to balance that flavor with a ripe sweetness of fruity malts. Grassy too. Great complex flavors, all over the place. Mouthfeel is excellent. Almost feels/tastes like a less intense barleywine in terms of thickness and syrupiness. Great smooth and sticky juicy feeling. A real treat to drink.

4.35,10.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Coppery-honey gold hue with a slight haziness, the vaguely off-white head reached almost two fingers in height, the retention was very good; it slowly faded to a long lasting cap. However the lacing was a little spotty but still this is a lovely looking beer. Juicy citrus aromas charge ahead of the toasty-biscuit maltiness, there is also an occasional hint of floral, as a whole the bouquet is very inviting; it smells like a Pale Ale should. Good potency as well. The palate is tremendously tasty with a big bite of hoppy bitterness, juicy as well; I am impressed with the potency of the hops, why can more breweries make IPAs this good! It is true the hops steal the show and it is unbalanced in a blissful way but it must be noted that the maltiness is detectable, a little bit of toasty crackers and a hint of a caramel too. But seriously, this is a nicely hoppy Pale Ale. Yummy! It would be a stretch to say this is a complex beer but how many of this style are? The slight burn of the alcohol at the back of the tongue is charming. The mouthfeel is very sturdy, this might be the most impressive attribute of all the GLBC beers Ive had, medium/medium-full in body, natural modest carbonation. Appetizing aftertaste, it is making me yearn for a good cookout. Burning River is tremendously drinkable, this is a top-notch Pale Ale, easily one of the best APAs Ive had. I wish I had more.

A good chunk of malt is always there literally dancing with the complex hops blend as described above in a perfect balance and harmony. The medium body never fails to support those intense sweet toasty cerealic citrus flavors. Medium carbonation.

Well rounded and appetizing aromawise. A transient, well baked biscuit note upfront in flavor fades quickly, yielding to a combination of mild toffee and candied lemon zest. Hop bitterness of a gentle nature leaps in mid palate, quickly drying the flavor profile. Leafy, lemon tea like hop flavors surface late, adding subtle earthy hints. Moderate in body, with the well calculated dextrin content lending a soft, lightly viscous mouthfeel. Finishes slightly sweet, with fleeting hints of sweet marmalade and grainy cracker. A tasty, fairly complex pale that remains light on the palate. Not as assertive in hop character as I remember, but very enjoyable and drinkable, regardless.

The first has a nice malty and light fruitiness to it on the front. Then the beer takes an interesting twist. As indicative of the nose, the Cascade hops take over in the finish.

At 65 IBU, this is a hop heads delight. The hops hammer you over the head at first taste, as the malt comes through ever so slightly in the finish. I was impressed with the aroma and taste particularly, as they were very closely connected. I could drink this all night, and if it weren't for the availability in my area, I would more often!

There is 2 fingers of head that has pretty good retention and a slight bit of lacing. The smell is a rich hop aroma with some citrus. The taste surprised me because it tastes like an IPA, but is listed as a pale. Of course this isn't as hoppy as a ruination or a two-hearted, but ranks up there in IBUs. There are hints of citrus and pine with a good hops bite. This is super refreshing. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy and the drinkability is very nice.

The bouquet displays soflty sweet, caramelized malt over a mildly floral and gently citrusy hoppiness. A medium/full body and smoothly creamy mouthfeel accentuate the lightly toasted/caramelized malt while floral and citrus hop flavor and bitterness balance it out perfectly. Very well done. Although there's alot of malt going on in the mouth, it thins and dries in the finish, and yet still retains a light touch of malty sweetness at the tip of the tongue... really, really nice! This APA exhibits a slightly fuller malt than many examples, and maybe a touch less hop flavor and aroma, but it's all still there and balances exceptionally well. It offers a great amount of drinkability while still retaining a good amount of character! Very well done and well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Jan 05, 2003"

I'm not talking subtle over or under tones here... smack bang exactly like the snuff. Both in smell and taste. I do recognize the quality of the beer, and I would generally enjoy a highly hopped beer like this. If I'd never tried the snuff it would've been fine I think. I tried to persist through the bottle, but it was just too much. The more I drank, the more it reminded me of the tobacco.
