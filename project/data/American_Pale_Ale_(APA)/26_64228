This just explodes with hop flavor and finishes with honey and I want to say toffee/caramel. Not as piney as some of the west coast ipa's I am use to, but I like this flavor profile much more. Only complaint here is the nose, which is definitely lacking although something I can live without.","blockdude","Monday at 11:59 PM"

I waited until the last bottle of my 6-pack to review it, as I didn't want to let my initial euphoria influence my rating unjustly. Pale ale, IPA, call it whatever you want. This beer is a work of art in every way. I wanted to find a reason not to rate it a 5, but I'd have been lying to myself.","glass_house","Monday at 06:01 PM"

There is a je ne sais quoi here - something that drives both hopheads and casual beer drinkers alike to go wild over this beer. I think it has something to do with the bold but not overpowering hopping and the incredible gush of tropical fruit that sets this apart.","Barnoloid","Jan 11, 2015"

Nice golden color (slightly darker than Heady if you care) good looking white foam. Nose is incredible with an explosion of piney fruityness. Just epic hops, juicy grapefruit and it will blow your mind. Maybe the best smelling beer in the world! Taste is equally good bitter but it feels perfectly integrated.

Huge grapefruit and mango. Yup, this is Citra alright. A little earthiness in there as well. Taste is like biting into some sort of grapefruit/mango hybrid fruit. A nice malt backbone too to round things out. I'm getting just a hint of pine and maybe a bit of onion. Drinks incredibly smoothly. Many say this blurs the line between APA and IPA and I'd have to agree. It has that bitter edge and hop aroma of an IPA, but enough balance with the malts that brings it closer to an APA. Mouthfeel is wonderful. Clean, crisp, refreshing, very light and easy to drink. Overall, this is definitely worthy of the praise. Just a great all around beer. Huge hop presence, easy to drink, and a great ode to Citra hops.  I want to compare it to the likes of Alpine's Hoppy Birthday, although that one uses more than just Citra. Really just a fantastic beer any way you look at it.","MisSigsFan","Dec 28, 2014"

Every craft lover I talk too speaks of zombie dust like it's the loch ness monster of beer; a legend that's rarely been seen. I was expecting something epic, rememberable, and the fact that I had to taste this and gumballhead side by side to tell the difference days something. Gumballs are hard enough to get ahold of where I'm from, let alone this beer, that is with out a doubt, more hype than delivery. It's a great beer, but not the holy Bigfoot x files Grail that, at least in these parts, it's played up to be. Still an easy 7/10 overall.","UriaHeep","Nov 06, 2014"

Hits hard at first with hops but at the same time a nice malt sweetness that balances it all out well. Intensely hopped(I like it) yet balance is nice. I wanted to try it and now I have.

5,8.5,,,,,,"Not sipping right now so I will reserve my review for later but from what I remember from last Thursday, this was like a Heady Topper with less alcohol bit to it and a wonderful blend of Citrus (lots of citrus for you hop heads like me), bitterness (relatively low at 60), and bite at only 6.4%. It's a Heady that you can have more than 2 of in one sitting. My own personal order would put this beer at #2 after Pliney The Elder (only because of how perfectly balanced that beer is). This beer isn't balanced much it's a smack of Citrusy Hops across the face. My #3 would be Sofie, with Maine Lunch and Heady rounding out my personal top 5.","Phishbum","Oct 26, 2014"

4.5,-2.4,,,,,,"Had the opportunity to try this fairly fresh (three weeks after bottling), unfortunately it was after a beer festival. With that said, this beer still stood out. The beer in itself is very well balanced. There was enough of a malt backbone to support the bitterness, so it never became a palate destroyer, which I like. The hop aroma/flavor is why this beer stood out. Loads of juicy nuances that keeps inviting you back to take another drink, just so you can stick your nose back into the glass. This is a great example of a very hop forward, well balanced pale ale. Worth seeking out to try.","frothy_80","Oct 25, 2014"

Aroma is a rich blend of orange and other citrus along with very subtle pine notes without being cloying or overpowering. Taste is outstanding with a continuance of orangey citrus notes and pine plus with a barely detectable presence in the background that brings to mind children's aspirin believe it or not. Mouthfeel is full and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall this is an outstanding beer. Though I have some philosophical objections to to the arch-hipsterishness of Three Floyds in general, this might be the premier example of what an American pale ale should be.","bristol2120","Oct 18, 2014"

Thirsty Dog's Citra Dog and Odd Side's CPA try to imitate but don't even come close. Really tried to go in not expecting to be blown away and I would suggest everyone try to do that. It's not a DIPA but just a very aromatic and full hop flavored pale ale that you could drink all day and not get sick of. Definitely worth a drive for your 2 case limit.","PaulyB83","Sep 27, 2014"

Big citrus and tropical notes combine with a bready, caramel like malt presence.  Taste is of citrus fruits, grapefruit, orange and tangerine.  Tropical flavors of mango, pineapple and guava.  Underneath the blast of fruit flavors that ride the whole way through the palate is a great sweet bread malt presence.  Medium body, crisp mouthfeel and semi dry finish.  Overall a great APA.  Is it worth the hype?  It's a great APA which showcase the citra hop extremely well.  It's a top APA for sure so the hype is at least partially warranted.","HopBomb515","Aug 17, 2014"

In my opinion not a 100, probably a 98 and wouldn't argue with a 99. The fact is it isn't fair that this is #10 on the BA list simply because of people obsessed with three Floyd"s, compared to some of the other beers out there it really shouldn't be a 100. Don't get me wrong this beer is absolutely delicious but to compare it to some of the other 100"s and even some of the other APA's, like MO which is sooo underrated imo, it just isn't so much better that it deserves a 100.","Skordi13","Aug 07, 2014"

Smell is fantastic , floral and fresh, west coast fragrance. Taste when it hits the tongue is same as smell but gives way to a belgian style flavor, not my style. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean and beer is super fresh tasting. I tried it twice to make sure it wasn't an off day, but it wasn't. I would drink again for sure, but I wouldn't seek it out, just not my style of PA/IPA","HopLover1","Aug 03, 2014"

4.6,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Enjoyed at the brewery in Munster. It was served with a light yellow color and a medium head that had fair retention. The smell was largely fruit, and especially tropical fruit. The taste, as others have said, more resembles that of an IPA as there isn't a whole lot of malt to balance it, but the fruit flavors are great, and it starts off sweet (but not too sweet) and does finish with some bitterness. It's moderately carbonated and goes down very easy. It's very, very similar to White Rajah (which is an IPA) in both smell and taste, but the mouthfeel and color are slightly different. Overall, this is excellent. Yes, it is definitely overhyped as it is not by any means earth shattering, but it is worth seeking.","DeFaz","Jul 27, 2014"

4.57,-0.9,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a world class example of an IPA, I know the brewery calls this is a Pale Ale and while it has some of the balance that a good Pale Ale should have it still tasted and drank just like an IPA. This beer had great drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, refreshing, not filling at all and the taste did a great job of holding my attention, I think I could drink a lot of these without even coming close to being bored with it, it's a great combination of taste and drinkability and I think it's a great beer to have on a warm day. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma and mouthfeel, to me those two aspects stood out just a little more than the others and they were both really well done. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't a single that about this beer that I disliked or would change, it's great just the way it is, but I do wish I could buy this in Michigan. I would for sure buy this beer if I had the chance and I wouldn't hesitate to grab a case of it. I would recommend this beer to everyone, it is truly one of those must try beers. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, with how famous it is in the craft beer scene I was expecting this to be a great beer and it ended up living up to that and it delivered in every aspect. This beer made for a great first impression for Three Floyds and I would love to try more of their beer. As a a Pale Ale, I'm pretty sure it's the best I've had and as an IPA it's up there in my top three for sure. Great job guys, this is one Awesome beer and It deserves all the recognition it gets.","StoutHunter","Jul 20, 2014"

It was poured into a small taster glass from the bottle and I could smell an intense passionfruit aroma before I even picked the glass up from the countertop. The nose on this thing absolutely blew my mind. Huge amounts of juicy tropical fruit amazingness. The flavor was the same and led me to believe that some sort of actual fruit was added to this beer, nope just citra hops! This may technically fit into the IPA category, but who cares....those lines have been blurred for a while now anyway. Cheers FFF, you did great with this one","kevobutler","Jun 05, 2014"

4.8,4.1,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,5," The flavor starts with citrus zestiness and juicy tropical fruit -mild mango and pineapple flavors give way to juicy grapefruit and light pale malt with subtle herbal and almost grassy accents with pure hop goodness all the way through. Love the fact this has a balance of malt for the style yet not holding back any hop intensity at all with finesse in the flavor. Overall one of the best pales in existence if no THE best - very worth with the emphasis on Citra making for a enjoyable flavor from first sip to last with citra essence in each taste -incredibly drinkable.","Slatetank","May 28, 2014"

I can smell citrusy hops that wafts strongly from the glass. I don't have to be close to the glass at all to smell them. That being said, the smell is the only thing that disappoints me about this beer. It's lacking somehow that I can't quite put my finger on. The hops hit me immediately as I taste it but they're calmed down almost immediately by the sweet malt. Neither the hops or the malt is overpowering. The mouth feel is very balanced, not too heavy...not too light. As it lingers in my mouth, I can feel a distinct bite tingling in my mouth. Overall it's a great beer. What impresses me the most is how well balanced it is.","W9820","May 25, 2014"

The lighter citrus flavors on the initial sip turn to an odd late skunky bitterness blended with some malt flavors. I definitely enjoyed the smell more than the taste, but an overall great offering from a great brewery.","Dawgboned37","May 20, 2014"

It pours very nicely. Leaves a thumb width head when served from a tap or poured from a bottle. The smell has a faint citricey smell followed by a grainey finish (for those of you that have looked at a couple of my other reviews, I state that I am a big fan of anything citrus flavored). This smell got me kind of excited. With the first taste of this awesome beer, I did pick up hints of grapefruit and then a strong bold taste that I'm not used to experiencing (again, just starting to delve into IPA's and APA's) all the way to the finish. The beer had nice viscosity and felt nice all the way across the palate. After the first beer I was a big fan and have had many bottles since. I am fortunate enough to live within a hours drive of FFF and have made a couple trips to pick up cases of ZD. I will be drinking this beer many times again down the road.

Beautiful beer, with a burnished gold color contrasted with a stark white head that leaves some decent lacing. Citrus and herbal aromas with a touch of grain. Clean and fresh smelling. The taste is where it's at. Clean citrus and a touch of clean sweet malt. Candied grapefruit peel followed by a long spicy hop finish. All very pleasant and quaffable.

Pours a hazy dirty-orange with an off-white head. It has an amazing tropical fruit aroma, which carries over to the taste, combined with a perfect balance of bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but maybe that's what makes it so drinkable. Overall, a very approachable APA that I wish they sold in my neighborhood.","FFreak","Apr 08, 2014"

Bell's Hopslam, Three Floyds.... this stuff is GREAT. if you want the breakdown and the review, everyone else is writing them. sorry, but this review is just a praise with supporting document....","pkalix","Mar 29, 2014"

Citrus hops, grapefruit and maybe a little melon or mango, and honey again, with a bit of maltiness, and not overly bitter aftertaste. A well balanced ale. Bonus points for the sweet artwork. Deserving of the ratings it receives, and not ridiculously priced for such a great beer. This APA presents as an IPA. Glad I was lucky enough to get some to New England.","RobbDogg","Mar 17, 2014"

Everything about it is a step above the rest- fantastic and unique appearance, exceptional balance between bitterness and sweetness AND showing the true potential that hops have besides 'citrus and pine' (other breweries take note), and somehow making a non-abrasive but refreshing mouthfeel.

Definitely in a grey area between an APA and IPA though. I don't like this one in the APA category because of its hoppiness, but it doesn't belong in the IPA category because of its maltiness.

Orange Grapefruit, Mango, Passion Fruit, Lemon Zest and Pineapple... All of which are balanced to near perfection with Carmel malt, Honey and a Bready Backbone~ Zombie Dust is not complex, her strengthens are a ridiculously refreshing, well balanced sleek and smoothness that delivers on point and shines while doing so~ How Three Floyd's pulls off their brew being light, refreshing smooth and subtle WHILE also being Big, Hearty, Satisfying, Bold 'Meaty' and Tasty is beyond me!

Pours a cloudy orange tan with a slight head that quickly turns to a thick off white lacing that lasts throughout the ale. The nose is deep and malty. Sweet but not bitter with the hoppiness normally found in a pale ale. There is pine and grass notes but not much citrus on the nose. It Sips clean with a pleasant mouth coating effect. Not bitter but not sweet either. Rather balanced and very pleasant. The tongue is malty and rich with a tangy bitterness on the start and an unexpected sweetness on the finish. The balanced flavor lasts long after the ale is gone. The flavors of this ale are astoundingly balanced, almost too much so. It is an incredibly well crafted ale but lacks any notes that make it stand out from the rest. It is a delicious ale that is incredibly satisfying but, even with all the hype, not one that I would go out of my way for again.","lochef81","Jan 16, 2014"

All kinda of citrus and a small amount of grass and pine. Only a little malt comes through, the hops are straight forward. The taste has good citrus qualities, as well. The malt cuts into the bitterness and is balanced nicely. Citrus, pine, and some other tropical fruit come through on the aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, small amount of carbonation and the taste lingers on the tongue for just a little bit, which makes you want to keep drinking this all day long.","Mikeypnh","Sep 25, 2013"

Smells of intense, juicy, sweet fruits like pineapple, mango, grapefruit, some peach, tiny bit of floral notes, lots of tropical fruit, sweet carmel. Almost like a bubblegum smell. Taste starts a hefty dose of citrus, sweet, savory fruits like pineapple, mango, and peach, get some floral qualities as well. Very classic floyds taste. Then gets even sweeter with the carmel malts and more fruits. Then finishes with more citrus fruits, even more tropical fruits, more carmel. Nice dry finish. During the entire taste profile, a good amount of hop bitterness lingers. Somewhat bitter, but just so darn smooth, fruity, and refreshing and definitely not as intense as the aroma suggests. Mouthfeel is creamy. Medium body with a good amount of carbonation, which adds to the refreshing quality of the beer. Have had it many times, and never ceases to amaze me.

Intense tropical fruit aromas with a whiff of grass and lemon. Bitterness at the front of the palate gives way to a malty middle that finishes with a floral, lemony hoppiness. Light bodied with great carbonation make this a very refreshing pale. Overall this a well crafted pale, complexity to rival the best DIPAs on BA with an ABV low enough to make it just about sessionable, a most impressive achievement. Thanks Xthul!","JohnG190","Aug 17, 2013"
5,8.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Label art is probably the coolest out there. Like a page from a comic book, except shiny metallic! Since I live roughly an hour from the brewery, this is frequently stocked at my house. I just love this beer. I know perfect scores should be very hard to come by, but this beer is what changed my outlook on beer forever. I have read by some that this beer is overrated, but it is truly the best single IPA i have ever had, and what is even more amazing is that I can get it regularly.

Three floyds calls this an APA when it is an IPA based on the IBU and other criteria. Judging this to be a 100 in the world of American Pale Ales is like saying the best type of apple in the world is a banana. If you don't pay attention to style parameters you shouldn't be judging any beers at all, because otherwise all we're doing here is telling the world what your OPINION is of a specific beer, and frankly, I don't care about your opinion if you can't even compare a beer against its supposed style guidelines.","MrHadack","Jul 17, 2013"

The taste was unbelievable, It was completely everything you can ask for which provided a great hoppy taste which provides a lesser to stronger to a very lesser taste. Brushing around the pallet leaves your mouth thirsty for more. I was craving this beer for weeks after having tasted it. This is a jewel in my book, a very smooth fantastic tasting beer.

It's more like this green velvet over coat for your tongue and the roof of your mouth. That's what really strikes me it's not merely an aftertaste but a coating you can feel and taste long after you've swallowed. I've never experienced such an amazing, live aftertaste.

Then suddenly I started noticing ZD popping up in many more bars on tap over the past few months. It's a really refreshing beer and one of my go to beers to grab a pint of after work. Although I am more partial to their darker creations, Three Floyds has really got something here and this one.","bluesbrewsguys","Jun 16, 2013"

Thick waves of lace stay on the glass as the foam slowly fades. Nose is exuberant with bursting pineapple and floral resinous notes. Pine and dandelion comes through as well. With first sip I am taken by how refreshing this beer is initially. The hop profile of this beer really builds with bitter bite. This brew really has nice malty balance while letting the hops shine. Very juicy as the citrus plays nicely. Gets piney and prickly on the back of the tongue as it finishes. Mouthfeel is not without the appropriate bitter bite and a really nice tingle that is unique and very enjoyable.","SPLITGRIN","Apr 27, 2013"

It is a beer that is so unique in it's flavor that it is hard to relax while drinking; it commands your attention. This is rare for a beer that is not overwhelming in its bitterness or flavor. Though the beers are not at all similar, Pliny comes to mind as another beer that can shock with the combination of both it's character as well as it's restraint. Excellent beer that I feel lucky to have been able to try!","rboinski","Apr 22, 2013"

The sip starts super fresh, clean, and crisp, developing with warmth into this outrageously complex and well-integrated drink. The malts gave a unique softness, but solid flavoring and boldness, while the hops got dirtier, more herbal, and more spicy throughout the tasting. The hops then play off the malts, sullying them and dragging them down to an equally as gritty level. The feel was soft and personally contributory to the wholeness of this experience, helping to keep drinkability just below the force of a fire hydrant. Despite the changes to this beer as the sipping progresses, it always remains welcome on the palate, definitely living up to the hype. If this is the dust of the zombie I’m almost afraid to see what meeting one face to face would be like…","TheBrewo","Apr 17, 2013"

Aromas are a fruity, tropical nose with mango, pineapple, grapefruit, biscuity malt. Tastes are pineapple, mango, semi-pungent grapefruit rind, mild pine, biscuity malt, a touch of caramel, juicy, coats the palate, semi-dry fairly astringent on the finish. Pine-resiny, medium mouth-feel, nice juiciness. Overall, this is a superb American Pale Ale, but in my books Alpha King wins, but just by a little bit. I like the bready malt with more caramel. This seems to showcase the Citra hop more, while having a little less of a malt presence.","barnzy78","Feb 03, 2013"

It's juicy, dank, fruity, mildly bitter, and will flood your mouth with wave after wave of hop flavor. There's a reason why this a legendary ale. Reputation earned and confirmed.

Smell is unreal, big citrus, pine, west coast style hops, the best smelling beer I've ever had. Taste is as good as the smell, west coast hops, pine, lemon, tons of citrus, floral, so clean, so crisp, so amazing. Overall this beer is definitely worth a top ten rating, I have no idea how it is considered an APA, there is almost no Mal flavors and the hops dominate. This beer is pretty much perfect, if you can get it, buy as much as possible. No matter how many times I drink it, it never gets old. Just wish they'd sell it in Ohio.","brewtus","Jan 26, 2013"
4.5,-2.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: As close to perfect as you can get for this style. While I personally prefer an IPA with more body and a little more malt, the hop presence in this beer surpasses that of most IPAs, even DIPAs. I guess technically an APA, it'd be hard not to call this an IPA. If you like your IPAs dry, clean, crisp, and ultra-hoppy, you won't find better.","MCain04","Jan 26, 2013"

Quite pricey at 20 a six, but well worth it. Okay, the citrus is there as it is with all hopsy beers, but it stays constant. The same peppery, citrusy flavor throughout. Its obvious since there is only one variety of hops used. Okay, hops aside, this is a carefully crafted brew that the owners of the recipe want to get right. I think they did it. The hops crafting is the feature of this brew, but there is no skimping on the brewing. Body, taste, head, and mouthfeel. I like it. Not an everyday drinker, but a special occasion one.

Piney grapefruit flavor, hits right on. Not as bitter as I had expected. Less carbonation than I was hoping for, and the finish comes off slightly syrupy. I guess I was expecting all hops. Strong malt profile here. That's a nitpick though, as the taste is all there and I love the citra hop aroma. All in all, a great pale ale.

It has a massive flavor for its abv % and throws out notes you only get with the best double IPAs in the world. A remarkable feat if you ask me. It's as of a session Dreadnaught as you'll ever find. I just can't get over how stunning this ale is and the pure genius crafted into this. For me Dreadnaught is the World's best double ipa and this is of the same breed. I will buy this every single time I see it(I'm hoping it's often). It lives far beyond any hype you've read or heard.

Juicy citra hops greet the nose, and pretty much take control of the aroma, though there are hints of a pale malt sweetness in the background. In the taste, again, hops are the dominant factor, as I would have expected, lots of orange zest and some pithy bitterness, biscuity malts taking the edge off slightly, keeping this on the fine line that separates IPA from APA. Body on the lighter side of medium, crisp and clean, and a tasty, drinkable treat. Nothing here that I haven't had before, and nothing really that screams "greatest APA in the world," but it's still a solid and tasty brew, will always be welcome in my fridge.","Rifugium","Jan 12, 2013"

I think my palate's evolved quite a bit with all the imperial stouts and DIPAs I've had recently- beers with more malt backbone. This is a very drinkable IPA (I don't care if BA calls it an APA) that showcases the Citra hops and what it can do given a minimal malt backbone. Honestly, after having had more APAs/IPAs, this is definitely one of the best I've had. I think a lot of it is branding (this beer didn't sell well when it was known as Cenotaph), limited distribution (almost but not quite brewpub only) and an otherwise excellent beer. Regardless, I enjoyed drinking this beer so I can't take too much away from it.","Stevedore","Jan 01, 2013"

4.53,-1.7,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12 ounce bottle, this just came to the store yesterday afternoon so I'm hoping it's a fresh batch. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with about an inch frothy off-white head that stays around for a very long time. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is nice and hoppy, it smells mostly like citrusy hops (grapefruit, mango, tropical fruits), along with pine hops, orange peel, and some light bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some floral/earthy hops noticeable, and a nice lingering bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit sticky, but also very smooth with moderate carbonation. I think this is a pretty good brew, I know I'd buy this again if I came across it. $10.99 a six pack and worth every penny!","bluejacket74","Dec 29, 2012"

It has a dark honey pour, very slightly cloudy with a thin foam head and very fine lacing. Scent of grapefruit, pine, earthiness, and more mellow citrus. So far nothing particularly out of the ordinary. Upon first sip, I figure out what its all about. Extremely well balanced combination of hops and malts that continue to mellow out in the aftertaste. I taste a hint of caramel in the aftertaste too, a really fantastic brew. Mouthfeel is perfect, light carbonation and a certain heaviness to it. Highly recommended!","srv33","Dec 26, 2012"

It reminds me a lot of the Laughing Dog citra hop ale they did for Capital Ale Houses 10th anniversary. "I wish it were winter, we could make it into ice blocks and skate on it!

I was scared that my palate had changed and Zombie Dust would no longer be the same sweet nectar I fell in love with the first time around.

Taste follows the nose mostly with the grapefruit and a bit of the tropics. There's also a really nice caramelly malt note on the finish that wasn't too noticeable on the nose. Ends with some really pleasant bitterness that invites you to take another drink. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with enough carbonation to keep it EXTREMELY refreshing. The beer absolutely lives up to the hype. Has enough complexity and intensity to keep it interesting while being refreshing enough to quaff. Can't get enough of this beer.","Thurgoft","Nov 09, 2012"

Delicious hoppy goodness with bits of orange peel. The taste follows with a nice hop punch and tastes of grapefruit. Just awesome! This embodies the smooth, fruity IPA/AIPAs that I love.

4.67,1.3,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"There’s really no denying that is an exceptional apa. It’s got 3Fs flair for sure, and nearly on par with Alpha King. Aroma is an A+. Tons of big, juicy, tropical citrus fruits, subtle pine, and vibrant florals. More tropical fruit here than usual 3Fs. It’s so hop fruity, but balanced with sweeter melon fruit, caramel, and cereal grains. The pour is decent, semi-translucent with a golden body, and fluffy creamy, starch white head. The body is light-medium (for a 3Fs product), big on flavor, though not quite perfectly balanced. Less of the great tropical fruit compared to the nose, but more lemon grass, strawberry, and melon starburst candy. Also, caramel and malted cereal with some light soapy qualities. Finish lingers very well with more florals and citrus. I definitely liked alot, but maybe not quite on par with Alpha King, though that is definitely debatable.","Samichlaus82","Oct 24, 2012"

The smell is of grapefruits and oranges, and the infamous Citra hop, the only hop this brew is made with, refreshing. Taste follows the nose. Absolutely refreshing, clean, crisp, citrus fruit taste, with more pineapple, orange, and an alcohol sweetness coming into play as it warms. Clean, smooth, almost milky mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation keeps it light and highly drinkable. The hype is real on this, and in my opinion, it truly is the best APA on the market.

4.16,-9.8,5,4,4,5,4,"355mL thanks to vw73182. Bottle release from the XV anniversary party. About two weeks old. Pours a clear amber orange with a towering, massive, rocky, off-white head. Sheen appearance with ridiculously insane, webby lace. Big sheets of complete lacing. Nose is huge orange juice, ultra dank mango, pineapple, mild sweet onion, pineapple flavored alcohol. My girlfriend thinks it smells like caramelized onions with meat...not necessarily bad. It certainly is not just a citrus/floral hop aroma. I would place the nose more at something like tamarind or other meaty Asian fruit we are not as familiar with. As it warms it gains more starchy character and sweet potatoes. In general, the nose starts off explosive and mellow out so no reason I see to let this decant like most beers. Taste has a nice biscuity quality to stave off astringency. Huge orange juice, ultra quenching malt character, with mild pineapple like alcohol and meaty fruits like jackfruit and durian. Very soft biscuity, quenching mouthfeel with decent amounts of butterscotch richness I get from Sculpin, Duet, and Alesmith IPA. Hot damn this is good. I’ve now had about three bottles of this over the past few days and the palate gets super quenching, small orange juice acidity, citrus fruitiness. Whoa. Like APA category demolition right here. Forget about topping this ever. Well, maybe fresh Spring Peeper. Perhaps a little boozy for the style but who cares. Would be dangerous as a session beer. 12/1/2011 8/5/8/5/16=4.2","tarheels86","Sep 06, 2012"

Sweet grapefruit and pine as well in there, and if somehow in a tropical way the taste follows suit. Nice, nice drinkability, finishes crisp and bitter with a very appealing lingering hop flavor. I guess I really favor citra hops!! I'm trying to pinpoint any slight shortcoming here but I'm already at the last sip and haven't come up with anything. Even though the malt backbone was nice it was backstage of the hop florality (new word) and I like it that way. I'm biased toward anything IPA/ DIPA, and AIPA is the least visited of the style for me. But of the ones I've tried, this does it. Superb. Easily in my Top 3 ever.

Fresh green hops, grapefruit, melon, orange slices, honey - all melded perfectly to make this splendid beer. This beer is bitter, no doubt, but I love that it doesn't linger in any harsh manner. The finish is short, which I like and don't like at the same time. I like that it keeps me sipping (or gulping) more and more, but I don't like that my glass is soon empty, unable to be filled with this blessed brew again. More ZD, please!!!","Onenote81","Jul 23, 2012"

However, there is plenty of malt sweetness, which makes a huge impression on the beer's taste and mouthfeel. Thankfully the abrasively bitter hops didn't melt off my eyebrows and taste buds because the mouth watering, bitter-dry finish makes this beer something special. I would easily drink this beer all day and actually have trouble not finishing it within 5 minutes after opening.

4.89,6.1,4,5,5,4.5,5,"This beer pours out a hazy orange color with a decent head. The aroma is absolutely fantastic. This is one hoppy beer for sure, it's almost like sticking your nose right in a bag of hop pellets. Tropical fruits and citrus are the stars of the show. The taste is also absolutely fantastic, it's seriously a hop assault of the first order. The relatively low ABV keeps the malt profile to the absolute minimum (there's just a bit of pale, slightly biscuity malts if you can cut through the hops), letting the brilliant Citra hops shine through. Orange and grapefruit come out big on the flavor, leaving the tropical aspects to more of a backing flavor. Either way, it's fantastic. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and leaves the kind of dryness that's really quite similar to biting into a hop pellet, just on a much smaller scale. There's that much hops in here, guys. The drinkability is outstanding. Overall, this is the king of pale ales/IPAs for the hophead. Superb in every way.","shand","Jul 02, 2012"

Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose was rich with citrus - grapefruit and orange in abundance. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a citrus intensity on the tongue that killed off all of the weak taste buds that got in its way. I felt like the fellow in the old Maxell tape commercial - blown back in my seat by the intensity of the experience. The finish was literally breathtaking - I really felt as though my breath had been taken away for a second or two after the swallow. The next thing to hit was the intensity of its dryness as I tried to catch my breath. The hops were toying with me to see if I measured up and I was doing my best to rise to the challenge.

Even as guests of Firestone-Walker after having been invited to their beer festival, the 3 Floyds staff were lifeless, provided no information about their beers, and couldn't even muster a smile or spare a "you're welcome."

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, citrus, citrus hop, pine, and pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, earth, and pine hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. Holy refreshing as crap Batman!!!

The balance on this one made it quite easy to drink and quite nice to smell as well. I actually found myself taking HUGE mouthfuls of this brew rather than sipping on it. Not sure if that is a good thing or bad thing, but I definitely didn’t mind. Still one of the best American Pale Ales I’ve had. Get this on your palate!!!","thagr81us","Jun 07, 2012"
4.97,7.8,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Nose up front of pineapple and orange zest. The taste is citrusy sweet with tangerines fading into lemon and finishing with slightly grapefruit notes. This is without a doubt the best pale ale I've ever had. For me pales are usually too mellow and bland but this guy could stack up to any IPA just without the bitter bite.","DonDirkA","Jun 07, 2012"

The taste is so well balanced with the hops it makes this by far the most drinkable beer I've ever had. Sweet but not too sweet, bitter but not to bitter. The malts are a slight caramel mixed wonderfully with citrus notes of the hops. Just an incredible example of the pale ale category.","Prospero","Jun 01, 2012"

Maybe the best looking brew I have seen, sunset orange with super thick sticky two finger bright white head that clings to the glass leaving beautiful lacing. The nose, maybe as good or better than Kerns Citra, I can just happily sit here and smell this for hours, tropically dense from the Citra, amazing. The flavor profile is citrusy, sweet, balanced, and a tad bitter from the 60 IBU, perfect.The mouth is crisp, clean, and medium weighted, perfect for this holiday weekend at the shore. If there is perfection then ZD is it, the best APA I have ever had. Sadly not available on the west coast, happily sitting with two six packs to enjoy over the next couple weeks.

It is much hopier than any APA I have had, but it is also much more balanced than any West coast IPA. The bitterness is very smooth, but the hop flavor is extraordinarily large, a trend that has been occurring more and more as time goes on.

Citra hops come through strong and sharp in my nose. I could smell this all day. Bit of pine, lotta citrus. Taste is mellowed and more appropriate for an APA (though you won't hear me complaining) I taste citrus sweetes in the middle of the palate and get a resonant pine bitterness aftertaste. The mouthfeel is spot on for an APA, medium/light body with carbonation enough to liven the beer. This is a great beer, it's unfortunate this isn't sold out here in Oregon/Washington.","gkunkle","Apr 25, 2012"

Scent brings big whiffs of pungent grapefruit, some pine resin and a good blend of tropical fruit and citrus, mouthwatering, lightly sugary sweet and modest detection of light caramelized malts. Taste is not as bold or as devastating as the scent had me fearing, but this is a pale ale... strong bitter grapefruit notes, followed by more citrus and tropical notes, fruits come across as more rind than juice. Sweet in a juicy way with a touch of lightly caramelized malts. Bitter, lightly drying on the palate, good body.

The taste is more of the same, tons of hops all over the place with a bit of a spicy bitterness on the palate. The mouthfeel is very nice, could have easily downed a 6 pack if I had it. Overall this is a great beer but I would have liked just a touch more maltiness on the taste to balance out the hops, as it is it came off just a bit harsh.

The nose is an explosion of Citra hops in your face. Awesome. A large citrus and tropical fruit character with a hint of pine. Couldn't possibly be better. The flavor follows suit. Terrific. It's hard to think this isn't an IPA with the hop character. Again, the Citra hops explode on your palette. Medium bitter with a large tropical fruit, mango, grapefruit, pine tone. Again, I am not sure how this could improve. The light malt base provides enough sweetness to balance this out well. Finishes with a lingering citrus on the tongue. Medium bodied and well carbonated.

Aromas of huge mango, pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, light pine, floral, herbal spiciness, and apricot. Fantastic aromas here as expected from one of my favorite hops. Taste of big pine, pineapple, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, and herbal spiciness. Nice amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, herbal, and tropical fruit for a bit. Great malt balance makes this extremely drinkable. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice slightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed at all in the taste or finish. Overall this is an mind blowing pale ale.

The bouquet of citrus hops is instantly delivered upon opening the bottle. Floral biscuit, near cherry blossoms over delicate grain. Very nice and such a pleasure when risking the often too tame genre of pale ales. The flavor brings an interesting combination of floral grain with a grassy finish. After the tongue has a couple moments to contemplate this, you get more of the citrus back and it ultimately presents a fine, sweet but reasonably balanced hop refreshment. Body is medium-light with a near slick feel and fairly delicate carbonation that crescendos to a mild froth in your mouth. Very drinkable and a fine entry for the pale ale world!

The bitterness on the palate is fairly mild and sticks around but that's not a bad thing at all. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a very bubbly mouthfeel.

For the style, which is very key here, it is mindblowing. To get a better hop forward beer than this in my opinion, you'd need to have a top notch DIPA like Heady Topper, PtE, or another FFF brew Dreadnaught. It's really some spectacular stuff. I really wasn't expecting an APA to be this great, but I'm so glad I had the opportunity to receive this in a trade. It's too bad I only have a few left, because I'd drink this all the time.

Aroma is green, fresh and raw. Citrus rind, grapefruit pulp, mild pine, and light caramel malt. Not quite as aromatic as some of the HF APAs, but very well balanced and nuanced. Medium thick, chewy body with moderate carbonation and a slightly wet, thin finish. Strong biscuit malt and earthy body with resiny and pulpy citrus hops buttering the finish. An exceptional, citrusy APA, but a little too much alcohol presence for the style and not quite Hoppy Birthday or Edward.

Washes of grapefruit rind with some nice malt underneath. Dry and bitter, but complex with really pleasant citrus tones. Takes me back to the days when I could actually get Three Floyds IPAs.

4.84,5,4.75,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, a phenomenal display of what a pale ale can be like with the citra hop, a softer touch to it than the SN Torpedo citra or Kern river, much less in the malt department to let it stand out, it just has a more flowery and delicate aura to it here. Big points for keeping the bitterness down and the hop mouthfeel very high.","Beerandraiderfan","Dec 24, 2011"
4.5,-2.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a nonic pint glass, an apricot golden orange hue with a bright chunky head just barely off white in color. Fine even lacing lines the sides of the glass as the head dwindles down. Aroma has a super citrus grapefruit nose, hints of crushed aspirin, tropical fruit with a underlying biscuit malt character. Flavor is crazy with Citra hops bringing out tropical fruit marmalade it's pretty awesome, nothing else like this creates the same flavor. Bitter citrus peel, pineapple notes, and a mellow biscuit malt sweetness matches the bitterness. I keep getting a really green peppermint tone in both the nose and the flavor, crazy but it works with the beers flavor. The palate is coated with hop oils ample carbonation rolls everything perfectly across with each sip. Overall a classic pale ale that could be most breweries, IPA really unleashes the perfect wave of Citra hops equating into a easy drinking pale ale that we all wish was more readily available. Thanks to the great trader, Ryan aka Schlais, out of Minnesota for this early Christmas gift.","WVbeergeek","Dec 24, 2011"

Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation with a sharp resinous mouthfeel.

Pours a slightly-hazy, golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very heavy with the Citra hops. Lovely citra aroma with a bit of pine and somewhat earthy notes. Taste just has so much hoppy goodness going on, it's ridiculous. I haven't had Alpha King in a long time, but I remember thinking the same thing: "How do they get such intense hop profile into a pale ale?" Great citra hop flavors with lovely citrus fruit and just the slightest hint of malt. Not sure if this is a fresh hop ale, but it sure tastes like one. An all-citra fresh hop ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, somewhat resiny, with a crisp finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a fantastic pale ale. I would love to do a side by side with Alpha King and Daisy Cutter to see who gets crowned supreme pale ale.","DovaliHops","Dec 03, 2011"

CITRUS SON! fresh hops come through and are very pungent. pale biscut malt intertwined, the taste follows the nose of amazing citrus filled beer, fruity and limp wristed, oily hop feel leaves a fresh tracked bitterness. medium bodied on the palate smooth and not very prickly for the style. overall 3 floyds has been a rollercoaster ride for expectations and this one was on point. i love the citrus involved and complexity it brings to compliment the bitterness. well done 3 floyds, all the talk is justified in my eyes. this one sets itself apart from the field in APA's.","JayAre46","Nov 26, 2011"

Taste is just a party in your mouth with citrus, hops, sweet and some kind of NW woods kinda thing. Finish lingers with sweet, which would make this a perfect beer to pair with anything from BBQ to fish.

The citra hops are both insane and perfect. This beer is so ridiculously aromatic that it haunts your dreams. The flavor too, citra overload with some orange zest, light pine, slight caramel malt, with a touch of alcohol. It's exceptional. The detection of alcohol is the only knock I have on this beer. This beer should be knighted, nominated for saint hood. It drinks light in body and is both kickass and sessionable at the same time. I drank two beers multiple times at Dark Lord Day, Pliny and Zombie Dust. I had four of these at Darkness Day. I drank six of these throughout the day at the FFF Anniversary party.

I used to think Daisy Cutter was the best pale ale out there but this one beats it and beats it solidly. It helps that my favorite hop being Citra is used in this one.

The nose has a light grain profile, a touch of doughy malt, citric bite and notes of mango. The flavor follows the same path but a bit fruitier and more integrated. The grain and dough malt balance pretty nicely on the assertive fruity hop flavors of citrus and other tropical fruits. The bitterness is assertive but not overpowering on medium body with a clean semi dry finish.

4.05,-12.1,4.5,4.5,4,3,4,"12 oz. bottle from Woodchopper. pours a honey gold with a one finger head, fades to spotty lace. the nose on this one is off the charts, full of orange, mango and apricot. taste is sweet caramel malt with a nice balance of lingering yet mild bitterness. very nice and I’d love to sit down and have 2 or 3 of these, but if I had to choose between this and Alpha King, I’d go with with the King.","barleyPops","Nov 11, 2011"

It's reception, drinkability and subsequent market availability is reminiscent of its FFF comrade, Gumballhead. In fact, while I was drinking this, I felt as if I was drinking the zombie offspring of Hopslam and Gumballhead.

4.12,-10.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Gold to amber APA with a full head that falls to a rounded lace in an imperial pint glass. Menu says 50 IBUs, but it packs a much bigger punch. Grassy, earthy nose that sings of hops, light fruit, and bitterness up front on top of caramel sweetness. Not a big beer, but doesn't taste light or watery at all--just not heavy.

It is more like an IPA (those looking for a more mellow APA should stay away), but it is quite complex. The flavors accentuate flowers and grapefruit at first, and then finish with a strong IPA-like bitterness. It is a nice balance. The mouthfeel is also very unique. It is almost creamy, like warm milk with slight carbonation, and it somehow works pretty well. A nice job on this one.","mentaltraveller","Oct 15, 2011"

The citrus from the nose doesn't betray the palate. I wouldn't call it rich but rather drinkable. I could certainly make a six pack enjoyably last through a full sunday of football.

Really can't overstate this fact, as to me, having a "session" IPA/APA of this caliber shows the artistry of the brewers and their ability to create such a fine brew and not need to jack up the alcohol.

The massive hop flavors and aroma may indicate that this beer could be classified as an IPA, but who really cares what the style is because it was delicious. Thanks to my friend Justin for hooking me up with some kick ass Three Floyds straight from the brewery. I highly recommend this beer and will be seeking it out again as it was ridiculously smooth and outstanding overall. An absolute session beer for me that I could drink anytime and all the time.","CHickman","Oct 02, 2011"

Although it is a rare find, I got my hands on some at Whole Foods in Chicago. I poured the beer into a stemless wine glass to appreciate the foggy golden color and offers a heavy mango aroma with hints of pineapple, floral and miscellaneous citrus scents. The first sip bites your tongue with the sting of hops like other IPAs, however the aftertaste doesn't linger, it finishes clean leaving a delightful taste behind. The carbonation floats down the side and reflects the light to shimmer, it such a way that it looks like it could be zombie dust! It is a very refreshing brew, and offers interesting comic artwork by Tim Seeley. I highly recommend if you can find it!","StevenSpringer","Sep 28, 2011"

Pours a cloudy golden amber with a small white head that has good retention and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is wonderful. Huge mango, light pineapple, light grapefruit, and some light honey. This is definitely a Citra hopped beer. The initial taste is some sweet mango that goes into a light breadiness with a bit of pineapple. The finish has some biscuit, more mango as well as a light bitterness. Light, slick mouthfeel and a relatively low carbonation. Great beer. I would love to be able to drink this regularly.","jethrodium","Sep 26, 2011"

Huge pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine notes. Citrus goodness just dominates the aroma. I feel like I'm at an outdoor farmers market selling only tropical fruit. Taste is only a slight notch below the smell with the bulk of that citrus hitting you square in the palate. The tail end of the taste has a hint of grass included with the citrus. Mouthfeel is solid though a bit dryer at the end than I expected. This beer really goes down easy though. This is another winner from Three Floyds and one that I will always have on my wants list.","smokeypeat","Sep 25, 2011"

I always want to leave room for another beer to come along and blow me out of the water, but you also have to pay your respects when you have a beer that does just that. This one has rocked me to the core, and I can't believe what a sensory experience this is. It's a Pale ale with an infectious personality, and I can see why this would be called zombie dust. If i had enough of it with me, I'd drink this till I was a zombie myself. Put this on your wants, and get a full pack. I have to admit, I think this is better than Hoppy birthday -- sorry Alpine.

Once I got past the formalities and actually got to taste it what I got in the smell carried over to the taste as far as it being similar to Gumball Head. This beer to me is a heavier more tasty version it. I enjoy drinking this and could see myself drinking multiple of these. This has a very good mouthfeel and is very pleasant to drink.

The flavor has some caramel malt early, then the juicy hop flavor and finally a dry, slightly bitter finish. I wish it was just a touch smoother, but it's so good as is. Mouthful is nice.

The taste is huge orange hop flavor with a medium bitterness. Holy cow, this is fantastic if you like citra. The malts are there for only the smallest amount of balance and the citra hop gives off other, much smaller tropical fruit notes. Again, simple, but effective. Better than Daisy Cutter and equal to Hoppy Birthday, where hoppy birthday has less malt balance and a different type of hop flavor (pine). Good body and good carbonation. Wow, this is fantastic.

Mild caramel dominate the palate. Body is medium with lower than average carbonation, oily on the tounge, and finishes extra dry with a very long lasting bitter citrus aftertaste.

Dry leafy green bitterness in the finish, hints of aspirin. Feel is relatively light, creamy and soft at first, drying out into the bitter finish.

The nose comprises orange zest, grapefruit, lemon zest, apricot, very light leek, and mild caramel. The taste holds notes of orange zest, orange rind, lemon peel, grapefruit (both red and white), light pine, mandarin orange, and some even milder caramel than before.

4.77,3.5,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Zombie Dust is a very smooth American Pale Ale with exquisite citrus and tropical fruit flavor. While some prefer the more intense pang of bitterness in the throat, this ale is much more delicate and soft than more conventional hop-forward beers- making a standout that has no competition!","BEERchitect","Mar 10, 2011"
4.33,-6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D: This is very drinkable, and very tasty. I think I put away most of the growler on my own. Fantastic stuff.","Arbitrator","Mar 08, 2011"

4.3,-6.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is definitely a crushable (makes beer chugging gesture) beer that I am now really regretting that I did not get a growler of. I found it to be very similar to some of the super hoppy west coast APAs that I have tried, but with just enough of that more balanced Midwest feel to make it that much more enjoyable.","zoso1967","Feb 21, 2011"
4.12,-10.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"No doubt, I would definitely order this one again.","PrinceDarren","Feb 20, 2011"
4.74,2.8,4,5,4.5,5,5,"It looks good with a nice light orange color it also has a finger width of head that clings to the sides of the glass. The smell is fantastic huge piney notes with citrus. The taste is fantastic it has great bitterness for the style more than I expected. The pine and citrus carries right through the nose to the taste. The mouthfeel is amazeing if I didn't know what I ordered I would have thought this was an ipa not a apa. Compared to other apa's this blows all others out of the water. I hope they put this in six packs the drinkability is crazy good.","phisigben","Jan 19, 2011"
4.59,-0.4,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The appearance wasn't anything mind blowing but I loved the smell, the grapefruit, the floral aroma, oh man, I could sit with my nose deep into a glass of this for awhile. The taste reminded me of Double Trouble from Founders which is a bit random, but it's what immediately came to mind. Maybe not as complex a taste but still really strong. Great hops presence, good sweetness but not to cloying. This is extremely drinkable and the growler flew by. I hope 3F's makes this a regular, I would love to have this to drink during the summer months. Just when you start to wonder if 3F's can bring something new to the party, they drop this delightful treasure.","SwiftyMcBeer","Jan 10, 2011"

4.15,-10,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"I grabbed this at the Trion in New Haven, IN near Fort Wayne. It was on draft and they offer takeout growlers. I heard about it from a couple friends who couldn't say enough about it. I would definitely agree it is a great beer and was a nice surprise (that's a biased statement, I'm a big 3f supporter). It is a very clear light golden color. The smell is great with a very fresh hops dominance. The taste is good, and very light on the malt presence. I was expecting something closer to alpha king, but it doesn't have the richness. It's unusually smooth, light and refreshing. Definitely has a potent hops presence, with lots of citrus spice. Seems like a great session beer and would be great with some spicy food. I hope it becomes a regular.","bheilman","Jan 08, 2011"

4.25,-7.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Beer is relatively light in body with a very mild sweetness lead off and an explosion of hop character in the midpalate. The finish of the beer is mildly bitter but it is a wonderfully rounded beer with so much hop flavor. It's lighter than I expected and not quite as bitter but I suppose this is an APA and not an IPA, I would have more of this anytime.","drabmuh","Jan 06, 2011"
4.55,-1.3,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"The taste was this sort of sublime soft citrus, with lots of lemon, apricot, and grapefruit, some tropical notes, lots of hop flavor, but a very silky mouthfeel and a very dry, pleasant ending with only a trace of bitterness. Excellent beer, and I'm very pleased I stopped by the Pub while it was around.","lstokes","Jan 06, 2011"

4.35,-5.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The flavor really takes off on what was present in the nose. There is quite. Bit of tropical fruit, some orange, and then quite a bit of nice bitterness. Really nice how the flavor and bitterness interact here. Feel is bitter.and a bit light with really nice cabontion. Thrilled that this was still here and am very glad I got to try it. Will be bringing a growler back for the DC folk to enjoy.","Thorpe429","Dec 23, 2010"
4,-13.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability -- A damn tasty APA, though the single-hopping has made it a bit one-dimensional. It all depends on how much one likes Citra hops - great aromatics and fruity flavors, but is somewhat lacking in earthy bitterness to counterbalance the caramel malt sweetness that this varietal is always paired with to make those juicy citrus, apricot, and peach notes sing. All in all, absolutely worth a try.","yeahnatenelson","Dec 19, 2010"

4.69,1.7,4,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Great beer here. The carbonation is perfect, and I could sit and drink way too many of these if 3F were down the street. As much as I enjoy Alpha King, I would rate this one even higher with better drinkability. The common trait they share in my opinion is that neither really drinks like an APA, but a great IPA. Well done 3F... what an impressive brewery!","Macky20","Dec 13, 2010"
4.29,-6.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,5,"Extremely high. Might be the most sessionable beer from FFF. Hopefully they have this on tap for awhile.","cetherid","Dec 11, 2010"
3.85,-16.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3,4,"5 hour old growler provided by Alex...Pours a brilliant clear orange, a light white head good retention...Citra aroma, what else do you expect. Not much different than any other citra beer. Nice, just doesn't stand out from the others, but I like it...The taste is more citra hops, a little orange, and yeast, not bad but I'm not feeling this as much as the citra's Its not meaty enough to stand up to the flavors, needs a strong backbone.","jrallen34","Dec 10, 2010"
4.32,-6.3,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,5,"D - Here is where this one shines. Crisp, fresh, and very easy to drink. This might just be the most drinkable beer I've ever had from FFF. I could easily knock off three pints on my own, maybe even an entire growler if I was feeling ambitious. I'm sure this one will become available in bombers. At least I hope it will...","airohead2001","Dec 08, 2010"
4.31,-6.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,"D: Fairly high, although the earthy/bitter aftertaste may get to be a bit much after a second glass. Still, there is great balance in this beer. Overall though, I was very impressed with this beer. In fact, I had it alongside daisy cutter and it blew daisy cutter out of the water in my opinion.","glazeman","Dec 08, 2010"
