I had it the next day (while writing this review) side-by-side with a Fat Head's Sunshine Daydream, which I liked more, but it is 4.9% ABV and this is 4.2% ABV so it's not a head-to-head comparison. I'd say in this ABV range and session IPA style; it competes well with the best of them.","Tucquan","Jun 28, 2014"

Flavor is light pale malts with a nice sweet citrusy hop character, some hay. Some juiciness. Pretty flavorful. Ther German influence is definitely there and it is almost like a super ultra hopped up pils, but finishes extremely clean. Light plus bodied with medium plus carbonation.

The aroma is spicy with big juicy hops The body is dry with a biting cracked pepper finish—so very drinkable and satisfying to a hop head. There are mild floral and fruit notes that slip into citrus rind. Overall, a great session beer, but be ready for dry hoppy goodness on par with an extra bitter saison.","tempest","Jun 18, 2014"

Pours to a bright slightly cloudy yellow with a bright white head. On the taste this brew has a good semi bitter hoppiness right off the bat. Very similar in taste to an ESB. Taste continues with a balanced middle then a semi bitter aftertaste. Not a bad brew. Simple as the name states, potentially a session brew as well as it packs good flavor for a 4.2% AC.

The alcohol feels alot bigger in perception, the hops are potent, american citrus flowery hops. Advertised as a session ipa, labeld a apa, this brings a ton of respect for the session <5%abv then most beers much bigger. The bitterness and flavor aspect is very strong and good, seemingly getting stronger as the drink goes on. Keg/case worthy, a session that drinks like a strongly hopped ipa.

Flavor is a strong bitter grapefruit with a long bitter and dry finish. Malts are cracker and white bread. Perfectly in the background. The beer is super light and so easy to drink. The bitter aftertaste gives heft to the beer. Its really nice, just so easy to put down.","jbaker67","Mar 10, 2014"

Pours a translucent straw gold with a loose, half-inch bright white head that dissipates into a soapy froth. Tropical fruits and grapefruit notes are evident off the pop. Once in the glass, there's a hint of pine, followed by a slight yeast presence and some cereal grains; however, the fruit character drops off a bit. Taste is not as bright as the nose - citrus, noble hops and light, toasted malts, with some residual bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light with a lively, almost prickly carbonation and mild acidity. Overall, a great session APA, although I have to say that I enjoyed this on draft a little bit more.","Jwale73","Dec 09, 2013"

Pretty surprising blast of hops in the nose, citrusy, piney, crisp. For a 4.2% brew, this really had a lot of flavor, and the hop profile almost pushed it into IPA territory IMO. Citrus pith, lemon and orange, pine needles, floral notes, crisp bitterness that didn't turn foul in the aftertaste. Body was light-medium, mouthfeel was snappy and dry, carbonation was moderate. Simple and flavorful. I could see this being an everyday beer.","Rifugium","Nov 30, 2013"

Go To is pretty damn good too, but I think the sweetness of it almost gets in the way of things. Boat is simple. Not too hoppy where you get worn out but hoppy enough to keep things interesting over a session. Great beer.","mikeburd1128","May 01, 2012"

4.15,1.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Carton Boat pours a very hazy lemon yellow, with about a finger and a half of white foam sitting atop the beer. The head lazily makes its way down the glass, leaving plenty of nice lacing left behind. The nose is a wonderfully fruity citrus bomb. It's redolent of Amarillo hops, and surprisingly pungent. It actually took a little bit of effort for me to pull my nose out of the glass and get down to drinking. There's a bit of cracker malt sweetness leading things off, before all those hops from the nose come barreling through. All the grapefruit and mango promised by the nose is delivered, but the bit of bitterness that floats through mid-palate is just a touch oversized to me. The mouthfeel is nice, light bodied with a subtly bubbly carbonation. Carton's Boat is a very welcome addition to the local scene (especially at $5 a pint), as this mashup of a Kolsch and APA is a mostly successful one.","axeman9182","Nov 17, 2011"
