The nose begins with s slight tartness that quickly dissipates bringing forward caramel, light biscuit and hop notes. It pours amber with a slight haze under a white, a‚Äù fluffy, persistent cap that produces good lace.  Malt and light fruits roll over the tongue to finish with a moderately bitter hop accent. It has a smooth, creamy texture, medium body, and moderate carbonation. Well balanced and easy to drink.","pat61","Jan 23, 2015"

That being said I have tried many many different brews of theirs and this is one of the best. It use to be less consistent with taste but I actually called them about it months ago and it seems to be fixed... I even broke a case on accident once because of their weak cardboardish packing. I told them about it and they changed the packaging and sent me money for another 12 pack!... I love this company and this beer and will be a customer of theirs till the day I die. One thing about this beer I have found with NO other beer EVER.. I find if I fall asleep and a beer has been opened.. I can wake up and even after being open all night. I can take a drink and it still tastes like a fresh beer and even has carbonation!!! That blew me away, most beer is crap after being left open.. This is one of the greatest brewed beers in the World IMO.","Warmonster","Feb 04, 2014"

3.93,9.2,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"this is what an American pale ale should taste like to me. its light, crisp, hoppy, drinkable, and wonderful when ice cold. the nose is well hoppy, bitter and bitey, with a lighter malt profile and a floral and piney hop character. the crispness of this is what impresses me most. its packed with flavor, but its snappy in the finish, ultimately refreshing. sweeter grains up front with a glorious bright hop flavor that seems unfamiliar to me, not sure what varieties are used here, but it works. theres a juicy fruity vibe that is new to me here. the feel is the best, perfectly carbonated with the cleanest fastest finish I can remember in this style. whatever yeast is used here I would like to clone for my own brewing, it really makes the feel of this pale ale pop off. overall the best of boulevards standard releases. cool that they've found a way to make the most commonplace style of beer as interesting as this, its sessionable and a lot of fun.","StonedTrippin","Beers"

A slight hint of rubber permeates the background. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish.

There's a little bit of a grapefruit component to the taste of this but not a lot. Mostly getting the hops. I've had this several times over & for some reason something seems a little off on this one. Can't quite put my finger on it. Mouthfeel is light. Overall, a very drinkable beer.

The hoppiness is harsh, but not in a good way. There is an off-flavor that I am not ciceroney enough to identify (vegetal?). Mouthfeel is mostly fine. Carbonation is good, body is ok.

A grassy fragrance hits the nose at first that is followed by light citrus scent. It finishes with bread fragrance and followed by a touch of cracked grain. The taste comes forward with the malt, bringing bread and biscuit flavors that seemingly dominate each taste. The hops do make a feint appearance at the backend, with grass and citrus flavors. The texture starts a bit watery then grows to become more medium bodied. It then starts to fade to as reaches the back of the palate. The growing carbonation crashes on the back of the palate like a wave. This is an easy to drink ale, if I were drinking a mild ale. This says pale ale. Though it has a strong color and look, with a descent aroma, but the taste is lackluster and the feel is below average, makes this beer a little disappointing.","cameraman","Beers"

The beer pours the color of peach jolly ranchers with a mediocre, off white head that recedes it to a flat film in the center of the glass. The aroma is pretty hoppy for a major brand, craft APA. There is definitely a good amount of citrus going on. There is also a good amount of malty sweetness lingering in the background of the aroma. The flavor follows suit with the hops really showcasing the flavor. Mostly orange with just a bit of lemon and a good malt kick to the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good bit of soft carbonation. This is definitely one of my go to beers while I'm out on the town in KC.

Although I gladly threw down a few pints of these, doesn't mean that I'm going to replace Sierra Nevada's pale ale on top of that pedistal. The beer begins promising enough- a medium copper hue with golden highlights, lively carbonation, well-headed with good retention. A mild haze persists, I'm thinking from a dry-hop character. Aromas of citrus, pine, lemon grass, and fruity esters dominate the glass while giving mild maltiness to the nose. Flavors of hops shift the balance away from the yeast, fruit, and malt character and into the oranges, grapefruit, pine, and grassy notes. Malts are well-attenuated, perhaps to grainy, cracker-like levels. Moderate fruity esters give a light hint of prunes, appricots, apples, and pears. The well-attenuated character gives the beer a crisp, sharp, dry texture- combined with a grassy, dry, sharp, bite from the hops give the beer a lot of crispness and refreshment, even if a bit harsh on the hop front. A beer certainly worth trying.","BEERchitect","Sep 15, 2008"

The flavor is moderately sweet, slightly oxidized, giving a slight sherry-like flavor. The hop bitterness is moderate. The carbonation is medium-high, body thin, and not the smoothest swallow.

Not heavy as schlafly's version and probably a little less true to the style, but still of good balance and complexity just the same. This is a fine beer. As it turns out upon further inspection of the bottle, that it was bottle conditioned and formed its carbonation while in the bottle.

There is a sort of bitter flavor in the aftertaste (if it can be called an aftertaste when their was no taste for it to come after). The mouthfeel is sickly thin and watery.

This beer has a good malt saltine cracker-like malt flavor, a slight fruitiness (almost like Juicy Fruit gum) with some pleasant tasting hops. The finish is bitter, but not powerfully so, with just enough hops to let you know you're drinking an American Pale Ale. Perhaps a bit thin for the style, which I suppose makes it a good pale ale for summertime quaffing. I used to drink Boulevard beer a lot starting about 12 years ago when I as a college student in Western Illinois. This is a respectable pale ale and I wish the Illinois distribution reached the Chicago area. Although the aroma reminded me a bit of Berghoff Pale Ale (which is brewed in Wisconsin and distributed in the Chicago area), I think Boulevard's pale ale is a bit more refined than the Berghoff and closer in taste and body to SNPA. The packaging is pretty refined; as this six-pack comes boxed with some nice artwork. The beer is described as bottle-conditoned, and I like that, as bottle-conditioned ales tend to have a bit more complexity than highly filtered ones.

The beer pours a bright gold and amber color with a soft creamy eggshell white head of about 1 cm. Aroma is present immediately with pine and sour grapefruity hops present. I also get faint whiffs of toffee. The body is a little thinner than I would like and carbonation is mild. The flavor allows light toffee and a sort of bready flavor to start off and recedes to citrusy hops and pine needles as well. The finish is slightly bitter and refreshing. Some orange flavors appear on the finish as well. A very easy to drink beer that I could drink several of in a sitting. Not sure if it would be my choice though. A decent enough beer just not outstanding.","sulldaddy","Nov 24, 2004"

3.82,6.1,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Rich orange or amber-red when poured. A head of small white bubbles formed and, as I poured, a pleasant flowery hop flavor rose from the glass. A closer sniff was quite satisfying as some of the malt sweetness blended with the hops. Upon tasting, this medium-bodied beer was bitter, as a Pale should be, with citrus-y aromatic hop flavors (probably Cascades) on top of a gentle (hardly noticable) malt. A hint of honey (is honey an ingredient of this beer?) blended the bitter hop, but I was wanting of more sweet malt to bring a sense of completion. 'Empty' is the best way to describe the experience. The beer suds subsided (rather quickly) to a white ring of foam that clung to the sides of the glass and were eventually left behind at the bottom. The gentle flavors of this beer are easy on the tongue such that it does not demand attention from your taste buds. A great beer for a casual evening.","mentor","Sep 30, 2003"

The taste and mouthfeel is crisp and clean hop. The hop is most over a well balance of malt, but not a bitter taste. Makes this a very drinkable beer.

The aromas were of sweet malts, pine hops, fruits (citrus lemon, grapefruit), some caramel and a hint of yeasty bread. The flavors were of sweet malts and fruits, citrus (grapefruit bite and lemon), hops, yeast and grains. It left a pine needle hop feel behind, on the tongue. Light bodied. Sweetness of fruits or malt seemed to dominate the pallet. Refreshing decent beer.

Quite easy with a smooth carbonation and fruity mild sweetness and a fabulous backing of toasty breadish malts. Medium body feel, a bit thin in places, but would suit for a good session beer as this stuff goes down easily.","tavernjef","Jul 06, 2003"

The head is eggshell white, it reached two fingers on a harder than typical pour. Very good retention and it laced rather well. The nose has good potency, mild citrus notes upfront with kisses of pine in the middle; the malt is noticeable at the back. The bouquet is not complex but it does speak its mind, ¬ìyou¬íre invited, take a sip.¬î So I do. The palate, for a Pale Ale, is on the simple side. However I find it very tasty. The citrusy-hops bitterness is found upfront with clean, ordinary maltiness in the middle; at the finish a hint of pine is detectable with a smidge of grapefruit. The malt is more prevalent than your typical APA yet Boulevard¬ís rendition is not English in nature. It is just a smaller than normal APA. It is what it is. This beer does suit me great; it is cheap, drinkable as hell, and easy to find. The body is medium; while it is not thin it does lack some pizzazz. The carbonation is modest, low, and natural.

As the brew warmed in my mouth I could discern the craft-brewed complexity of this very drinkable, tasty ale. The Hop aroma is assertive. The caramel malts add sweetness and balance out the hops.
