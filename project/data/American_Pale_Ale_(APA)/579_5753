4.09,13,4.25,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Poured in to an IPA glass, the unique look of this beer immediately catches my eye. Despite the fact that the head disappeared about as quickly as it formed, with scant lacing to be found, I am struck by the appearance. The tangerine-grapefruit color of the beer looks almost electric when its chilled haze meets the light. Interesting. The aroma promises bright tropical fruit, with a subtle essence of pine. A little biscuity malt in the background rounds out the nose. The flavor brings sweet bread, subtle dried fruit, lightly toasted malts, and a balanced hop character. Mild pine and grapefruit. This is a well-rounded brew. The mouthfeel is on point, with just enough body and carbonation to keep this refreshing. I believe the few extra months have mellowed this beer, as I remember it being more vibrant when it was in season. As it stands, this is superbly sessionable, perhaps more so now that time has reigned in the flavors a bit. I have enjoyed it either way. It's nice to see an American Pale Ale that is not trying to masquerade as an IPA and brings it's own unique qualities. I put this near the top of my list when a Pale Ale is in order. Fresh or mellowed, it's always delicious.","JohnnyI","Dec 30, 2014"

Sweet and syrupy with a light consistent hop belt.  Went great with the seared tuna appetizer, tenderest I've ever had filet main course and following cheese plate. ( switched to Cabernet for desert) Not sure if it was as good as it would be fresh on the big island, but tasty none-the-less.","mooseisloose","Dec 20, 2014"

Somewhat tart in the nose, black currant and cherries, meshed with hops and wet grain feed. Alcohol right in the beginning of the taste, wasn't expecting that. Some cinnamon, and toasted grain in there as well. Really nice aftertaste, hops and crushed pepper. A little watery maybe, but really not a lot of complaints here.

Heavy medium bodied with a nice slick oily texture. Average carbonation level with a bit of effervescence on the finish. The taste profile is balanced between the flavors of the nose. It begins with tropical notes, flows to a bit of spice and ends with a light bitterness over caramel.","tillmac62","Jul 22, 2014"

3.74,3.3,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"I did as they directed and simply allowed the lava, I mean, liquid flow from the bottle and into my glass. This set up a pseudo-cascade which then settled into three fingers of dense, rocky, tawny head with good retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber (SRM = > 9, < 13) with NE-quality clarity. As the head slowly fell, it left nice lacing in its wake. Nose had a light grapefruit-citrusiness to it along with a caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was intensely citrusy and probably pushes the envelope between an APA and an AIPA. As a self-avowed hophead, this was right in my wheelhouse, but for style mavens, it might be just a tad too hoppy. Finish was semi-dry with a light caramel sweetness kicking in to better align it with its style. I now await its release in CANs.","woodychandler","Jul 14, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, pear, light caramel, biscuit, honey, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop and malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, pear, biscuit, light caramel, honey, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal earthiness. Light earthy floral/pine bitterness; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange/lemon zest, pear, biscuit, honey, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of citrus hops with malt sweetness; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale ale. All around well balanced citrus hop and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 11, 2014"

As it warmed up and got more balanced and the Mango flavor came out, I liked it more and more and drank it down fairly quickly. Quite a drinkable brew - I could easily have another one without batting an eye. Went well with dinner (pepper + wine sauce chicken, buttered carrots) and I think it would go well all by itself or with other meals as well. I'll have to pick this one up again.","damndirtyape","Dec 10, 2013"

Great mouthfeel with medium body and carbonation; the taste follows the nose with sweetness from caramel malts, biscuity nutty flavor, lightly roasted malts, hop flavor is floral forward and floral/fruity back.

3.95,9.1,3.5,4,4,3.75,4,"Poured a clear amber with a one finger white head that receded to a ring of white lace. It looks like a typical filtered American Pale Ale, not bad, but not really the point of the beer. Scents of citrus pith, grapefruit, pine, light floral aromas and tropical fruit. Not near as intense as in a standard West Coast IPA, but a very similar, more nuanced and subdued version of the scent profile. Quite nice. Taste is mildly bitter, with pine resin, grapefruit pith, some faint grassy and floral hop notes, and a bitter finish. There is a nice, yet subdued caramel malt backbone keeping the flavor balanced. It's not too sweet, nor too bitter, very true to the style. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a semi-drying finish. It's nice and easy to drink, but maybe a bit too light and a little too drying, overall quite nice though. Overall this is a pretty good pale ale. It's not the best in it's style by a long shot, but it's not bad and a good choice when nothing else is around.","Auraan","Jan 26, 2013"

There is a slight haze to it and carbonation is noticeable. It smells great- I am picking up pineapple, grapefruit, as well as some nice malt sugars. The citrus scent is also present, as advertised. Wow, this is a magnificent APA! Great balance of fruity notes, toasted malts, and unique hops. This beer coats the mouth nicely and the sugary taste fades out to a somewhat dry finish. Medium bodied and slightly warming on the way down. When I first tasted this on tap at Firewaters in Atlantic City, I thought it was almost hoppy enough to be like an IPA, but I am not getting that at all this time from the bottle.

I mentioned that this was a beer to have while you eat, just a generic beery accompaniment that wouldn't distract, so that's what I did. Roast chicken and veg with pan sauce and this beer. Suddenly these other flavors come out. It was actually pretty tasty. Almost tasted like a pale ale. A little floral or fruity something going on. Some slightly sweet caramel. I'll give it an extra half point for that. And interestingly I had another after dinner and it was back to where it was before, nothing wrong but nothing interesting. I feel like trying all beers with roast chicken now. Try it!","BrownNut","May 18, 2012"

Smell is a nice interplay between caramel malts and hops that results in a fruity sort of impression. yeast esters and a slight citrus twang behind it all. the taste is a very nice balance of those rich caramel malts and a firm bitterness, and slight hop flavor. Full flavored for sure, with an emphasis on the malts, but the hops stick around as well. It's medium bodied and has a hearty feel to it.

Namely, apricot, grass, wheat-like flavours, and a bit of yeastiness. The good thing about this beer is that it's got some sweet maltiness to balance it. Many pale ales are light in colour, body and flavour to bring out those nasty hop flavours, allowing them to even further dominate the beer.

Smells very sweet which throws you off when you take your first drink and get the overwhelming bitterness of an IPA, not what i normally expect in an APA. This beer is very smooth going down, that was probably my favorite part of this beer. Overall my opinion is biased based on the fact i am not the biggest fan of this bitter of a beer but if thats your cup of tea than i would suggest it to you.

Nice crisp finish with a lingering of hops on the palate that makes you go back for more.

This brew is a bit more like an amber to me. The carbonation comes through at the end of the palate. Sharp, toasted aftertaste of roasted caramel. The finish is sweet and smooth.

Maybe I got an older bottle, but this beer is very malt forward without the hop flavor or mouthfeel that I've grown accustomed to in the best APA's--which have bright citrusy hops and toasty biscuity malt. The malt in this beer even tastes a bit oxidized and a bit too sweet/caramelly. The sweetness at the end of the beer is a little too much without the hops.","Soonami","May 03, 2011"

There is a roasted quality to the malts that is also coming through and that coupled with the earthiness and caramels define this beer.

The pour was an average coppery brown with decent head & lace, but little aroma other than a malt-hop. The flavor was a basic pale ale a la Bass when I expected more. Simple hops & sweet malts prevailed with nothing else of note...not a bad beer for a bbq, just a let down.

3.58,-1.1,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,4,"Poured into a pint glass and comes out a fairly dark coppery-orange. A two finger head develops and is off-white and fairly frothy. The head has decent retention and leaves behind a light coat of lacing. A small coat of white stays atop the beer with a pretty creamy ring. Smell is alright. I get mostly notes of fairly toasty, caramel malt and a bready/wheat/yeasty note. If anything, I get a tiny bit of earthy hops in there too. The aroma has decent strength but not much too it. Taste is pretty much the smell with a bit more complexity and some hops. I get the caramel malts and the bready hints. The hops come through and are a tiny bit bitter with grassy, earthy and a tiny bit of fruit to them. Once again, the malt is the prominent character here but it is a bit too caramel for me. Some citrus peel from the hops comes around once in a while as well. The mouthfeel is probably the best part of this beer. It has a moderate body with a medium level of carbonation. The creaminess is nice and helps make the beer more enjoyable. There is no warmth but a coat of bitterness stays around on the tongue with some malt flavor. Drinkability is good. The beer was one of the cheapest on the shelf, even after being shipped from Hawaii. The taste is decent as well. There really are no bad flavors but they are not exceptional. If the malts were a bit less caramel and the hops were a bit more present I think this beer would be great. I enjoyed this one but wasn't hugely impressed with it.

Despite all the nice flavor it also seems to have a nagging off flavor bitterness, some hop characteristic that I'm not really digging, or it seems more like a burnt malt bitter flavor that doesn't go well with a pale ale.

The body of Kona Fire Rock Pale Ale tends toward the medium to light side and the hops offered here are not over the top, nor are they very bitter. The Galena hops contribute to a flavor that reminds me of a fine English Pale Ale and the beer is highly drinkable and very pleasant. Add to that the citrus fruit taste enhancement from the other hop varieties and you have a nice combination of flavors. It's a good pale ale choice when you want some hops but don't want an overwhelming taste of spice and bitterness.","BryanCarey","Jan 29, 2009"

There's an underlying tinniness to the beer which is a shame. Sometimes, I wonder if the tininess is from my glassware, but I faithfully took a sip straight from the bottle and got the same notes. The feel is really the least positive aspect of the beer. There's some carbonation but it gives way to significant wateriness quickly. I liked Kona's Pipeline Porter better, but it's close.

A surprising flavor and texture for an American pale ale - a style which doesn't usually appeal to me. The color is a deep orange, almost rusty shade, with almost no head. But what I really enjoyed about this beer was the smoothness. The hop and malt flavor is extremely well balanced. The carbonation lends the beer a great mouthfeel that makes this one very drinkable. Although the flavor is a tiny bit thin and mildly fruity, I thought it was worlds better than other pale ales in the American ""canon"" (Sierra Nevada springs to mind).

Somewhat biscuity. Maybe some hints of dark fruit. No real hop presence, though, in the bouquet at all. The taste echoes the aroma. Rich and malty, this is kind of like an Old Chub junior, but that is a weak, weak comparison, and I know it. Smooth malty taste. Slightly thin, but refreshing. Some woody, nutty flavors, and the faintest hint of strawberries. Slight hop kick right before the finish, which is nice for balance but otherwise unimpressive. I would never have guessed this beer was almost 6% ABV, because the alcohol is masked very nicely. On the whole, this is a very drinkable beer.

3.85,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This is a fine interpretation of a classic APA. It is well-balanced between malt sweetness and hop bitterness. The alcohol was well-covered. Nothing particular ""wowed"" me, and I was considering a 3.5 for flavor, but decided, especially after another, that is just makes the higher score because, while the taste is mild, it is nice and has some complexity to it. I recommend this one if you are in the mood for an easy drinking, well-balanced pale ale.","jwc215","Dec 02, 2006"

Pours a cloudy copper color. No head (at least not in the frosted beer mug), light lacing, good hops smell. Great taste of bitter hops and spices. This is not a hops bomb, but has enought bite to satisfy a hop head. It reminded me a little of Harpoon. Mouthfeel was fairly rich, not at all watery. Drinkability is good, both with food and as a sessions beer. I had this one with the fish tacos, but I could easily see myself drinking several of these.

A 1 1/2-2 finger frothy head sits atop the deep and rich dark copper body. The aroma is largely grapefruit with caramel and sweet malts. The carbonation is fine but, the mouthfeel is thin and watery. For a pale ale, this beer is fruity (not necessarily tropical but a bit more tropical than the normal citrus profile) and earthy malt-sweetness tastes strange. If the malt flavors were bigger the beer would be excellent, well it would be interesting... now if the malts were more pronounced and it had more hop bitterness, then this beer really would be excellent. As it stands, this stuff is a bit bland and too thin. Fire Rock Pale Ale is not a bad pale ale by any means, it's just frustrating since it could taste so much better .","goschool","Aug 27, 2005"
