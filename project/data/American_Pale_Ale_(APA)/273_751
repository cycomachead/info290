Deliciously fresh, bursting with lemony hop aromatics and a hint of orange zest to the taste, great hot weather session beer, and I think easily my favorite beer I have had from these guys. No caramel malts getting in the way, it stays nice and light. Pale, like a pale ale should be but so few really are anymore, not trying to do too much, while simultaneously doing it all.

I'm glad I ordered it.  It's easy to find in stores around here, so it's nice to know if I ever feel like drinking something more hoppy than  the usual (and don't want to worry about the high bitterness that tends to come with stronger beers like IPAs) I won't have to go far to find a pint (or a six-pack) of this one.","Pantalones","Jan 18, 2015"

It's similar to Sierra Pale Ale, but a bit more dry.  Pretty solid beer.  Mine was pretty close to it's expiration date.  Had it been fresh and on draught, it could have scored even higher in my book.  As it was, not a bad option.","DavidBart","Jan 13, 2015"

Get an aroma of rising bread dough and some floral hops. Sweet smelling too. Flavors are white yeast sweet bread, with a tinge of caramel/vanilla, and a very pleasant mild, but slightly peppery and grassy hop nip. Nice feel and carbonation. I like this one a lot. Could drink several of these.","DelMontiac","Jun 16, 2014"

The head is compact, very close to pure white and almost one finger tall. Lace consists of both patching and spotting. The aroma takes some time before the hops come out. It starts grainy, but that backs down as it breathes. When it does, it displays a simple balance of floral bitterness and biscuit while a ghost of buttery, sweet grains flashes in vaguely and briefly. The hops take time on the tongue as well, floral with a little rawness. Biscuit is still there in the malts, though the butter vanishes entirely. It takes on some dryness as hops bitterness shows a leafy aspect. Breadiness in the malts adds texture to the body while it bites on the tongue. The body eases toward light.","Brenden","Jan 29, 2014"

This is going to seem odd, but the nose reminded me of golden raisins! And/or honey plus a breadiness. Wild. Mouthfeel was pretty full for the style and I swear that it tasted more like honey than the mead I had on Wednesday. It would not be sustaining for a hophead, but it was a nice diversion. Finish was so honey-like that I began to question whether I might not be drinking a lager. It was very sweet, especially for the style.

3.98,9.6,3.5,4.25,4,3.5,4,"This beer was purchased at Ingles' market in Athens, TN. In a 6 pack of bottles consumed one a night for 6 days. Appearance is a brownish copper. Has notes of citrus, caramel, and flowery overtones. Very strong hop notes. Extremely carbonated. Very light malt notes. Very drinkable but the carbonation level needs to be backed off. Nice fruity caramel taste which has heavy hop notes. Needs more malt to balance the palate. Very excellent overall for it's class. Easily a 3.8-4 out of 5 the same. Easily available in my area as are most all Sweetwater beers are. Would have this beer again. Enjoy this a lot.","KentT","Sep 23, 2013"

4.1,12.9,4,4.5,4,3.75,4,"Has always and will always be my go-to beer for the summer. This one has a much more citrus kick than any IPA I have had and almost has a rush of grapefruit on the initial sip until the hops come into play. I don't mind the stronger carbonation but I can see where this may be a turn off to some. The citrus notes really take the edge off the ABV so be careful (or not) lest you start feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. If you're anywhere in the southeast, look for the rainbow trout on the tap. You won't be disappointed.","Danielthecameron","Aug 17, 2013"

Those of us who are not hop-obsessed (not me!) will appreciated the focus on malt and grain balance present in this brew. It is slightly sweet and the sweetness is cloying, which interferes with certain foods (such as salty pizza, salty cheeses, etc.). Overall, however, this is a solid beer.

The beer pours a translucent pale straw color with a small 1/2 finger white head with virtually no retention and minimal lacing. The nose is rather mild, more of a sweet crystal malt presence than hops, which is odd considering the name of the beer. Hints of earthy hops but mostly malty nose. The flavor is more inviting than the nose lets on, a gentle blend of crystal malt with a light earthy bitter together with a fruity sweetness. Nothing is all that pronounced rather well balanced. A mild bitterness and lingering fruity character remain on the tongue. Light bodied and decently carbonated. Overall, a treat to try. I've been wanting to try this on name and label alone. I know it's won some awards so it was nice to try. Not earth shattering but solid.","hopfacebrew","Mar 02, 2012"

The temperature was high enough to melt steel, the opening bands sucked and the only beer I could find was Coors Light in 24oz cans. Shameful I know. I wouldn't wash my feet in that shit now. But then later while the main band was playing (Slayer) I found a beer kiosk that was in the process of closing and they only had SweetWater 420. The guy poured me the beer--on the freaking house because he had already closed the register or something--and I thought I was the luckiest man on earth. I was blown away after the first sip. This is great stuff but imagine what it tasted like after a hot day, drinking nothing but Coors Light.","godlessape","Dec 10, 2011"

Smells of grains, a bit of lemon, some faint hops, and perhaps a bit of orange. Beyond that, smell is a bit ""watery"" though still inviting for a pale. Tastes similar, but is very balanced. A bit more hop character is noticeable in the middle, and there is a faint alcohol presence near the end, which seems odd. Still, the rest of the flavors are balanced phenomenally and lend some additional refreshment to the drink. Mouthfeel is smooth, and pretty typical of a pale.

3.06,-15.7,4.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a bright orange-gold coloring with no head. The beer almost glows in the glass. The nose is a muddled fruit sweetness, with a slight citrus note, also, but more cloying characteristics than anything. Slight hopping helps to balance everything. The beer is very sharp and crisp in mouth. Flavors are slightly smoked, but very tart and bitter citrus, also, with an overpowered hops presence. A little too lopsided for me. The aftertaste is very watery, with slight peppery-hops hints throughout. The finish is dry, but lingers a bit.","GarthDanielson","Jul 13, 2011"

The taste starts malty sweet, with the typical hints of bread and caramel, and then finishes with some complex hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced and finishes clean.

It had a nice hoppy flavor with a well rounded, crisp finish. A nice fruity aroma also carried through in flavor.

I have a bottle of their regular IPA, so I have higher hopes for that one since it is a little bigger.

Pale malts, a touch of fruitiness and just a hint of lightly toasted malt are all present. Tastes like it smells, rather unremarkable. The aforementioned smells are accurately translated into corresponding flavors with some hop bitterness for balance but not much flavor (again this is probably not the beer's fault).

It has a certain sweetness to it that meshes really well with the hop character but doesn't really temper the hop flavors with a malty balance. Certainly an interesting take on the APA as well as a very crisp and sessionable beer.

This is on tap at Charleston's minor league baseball park. I could definitely throw back a few of these at a game!","jpro","Jun 27, 2009"

Copper color with an off white tan head. A Good slighty toasted/bready malt flavor matched the bitterness of the hops. The hop flavor in this on tap brew was much better than the bottled version I remember trying because the hops were more floral, citrusy, and complex. From the bottle the hops seemed to provide only bitterness and lacked any floral or exotic flavor. Has the level of bitterness you would expect from an american pale ale. Decent.","joshwlt","May 30, 2008"

The head was seriously pathetic and makes me wonder if it wasnt the glass that was the problem. The smell was lemony and reminded me of iced tea. It is uncanny how much this smells like iced tea, different than most pale ales. The taste is a little herbal hops up front with a macro lager-like finish. There are some bready malts hanging around but the lemony, herbal hops are front and center. The mouthfeel is sort of thick and full. Carbonation seems just right.

D: Very drinkable as I returned several times for refills at the Sweetwater tent. Hope to see this in the local market soon.","veech","Oct 15, 2006"

Very nice.The aroma offers bright, fresh, floral & citrusy hops over a sweet, doughy maltiness. The body is medium with a delicate, fine, natural carbonation. The flavor delivers a combination of lightly tangy, citrusy and floral hop flavors and a bready, caramel & biscuit maltiness backed by a firm bitterness.

Mild hop bitter that's nearly clean...some co-humulone. Malt sweet is buried under the hops. Hops border on pine sol favored. Definitely pine, some orange, and mild grapfruit pith. Carbonation is a bit too much, the acrid on my tongue augments the hops, so I will swirl to release some carbonation. Now it's sour tang with sweet malt and unpleasant bitter. Not good.

White head, about two fingers in height at its apex. Head retention was good; it faded quickly to a half finger cap. I was impressed that a cap of this size had such good staying power, a small cap lasted the entire consumption. Subsequent lacing was spotty and it clung poorly. Overall, the appearance is good. The nose is softly malty with hints of spicy hops. Bready throughout with a good yeasty aura, it has that fresh baked scent. The potency is low though. Clean. The nose is interesting, in the sense that this Pale Ale fails to be hoppy. Hell, it fails to say much of anything. The bouquet is not inviting because there is nothing there! What a bummer. The palate is much improved over the nose. I can taste the hops! Yeah! Now, dont fool yourself the hoppy influences are minimal but they are, at least, perceptible. Hops do offer some grassy-spice, some citrus, and some wood. Malt is soft and kind of bready, dry at times like a cracker. Orange zest, flowers, and some distant peaches can be found at the back. Modestly yeasty. The palate is very average but friendly, it reminds me of Boulevard Pale Ale (420 is not as bitter or as citrusy). The aftertaste is malty and dry with just a flash of hops. The palate is good. Medium in body, low but natural carbonation helps produce a pleasant, creamy mouthfeel that works well with this beer. Nice mouthfeel. This beer is plenty drinkable but it is nothing special. I am sure if this beer were a local Id quaff this Pale Ale with burgers or on a poker night. Its a solid beer but forgettable.

The sweet taste holds throughout the tasting as there is amazingly little to no bitterness at all. The mouthfeel is a little thin but the drinkability is very high as this beer goes down incredibly smooth. Overall, this is a very drinkable APA and I could easily lose track of how many I've had.","DaveGood","Apr 18, 2004"
3.68,1.4,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Pours a nice gold-copper color with a 1-2 finger head that dissapated quickly. Nice strong hops aroma with a slight citrus note also, possibly grapefruit. Fulfilling mouthfeel, not watery but not overly thick. Obvious strong hops presence but not overpowering, nice citrus also. Being a local beer i'm a little biased but this really is an enjoyable brew, definitely easy to put a few back.","Southernbrew","Feb 18, 2004"
3.89,7.2,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Pale golden brew with low to minimal carbonation and a non existent head. Taste is balanced between the spicy aromatic hops and pale malt. Medium body with a grainy and dry mouthfeel that is dead on for the style. Very tasty and drinkable, but lacks any memorable qualities. I'd order it again and again, as the freshness and drinkability put it head and shoulders above most large imports like Bass and Newcastle. Easy to find around Atlanta.","rajendra82","Feb 15, 2004"
4,10.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,5,"Clear tangerine honey amber pour with a short lived white head. Attractive island lacing. Aroma is an interesting array of fresh baked white bread with Cascade hops. Mouthfeel is good, mild carbonation without any serious hops bite. There is a taste of grain in evidence(very pleasant here). Taste is excellent. Very well balanced. Perfect blend of hops and malts. Hard to believe this was brewed in Atlanta, Ga. Can't believe I passed this one up during my many trips there. Not hoppy enough to be an IPA, but certainly bittered enough against some quality malts to be world class drinkable.","merlin48","Jan 02, 2004"
3.4,-6.3,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Light golden-honey color with a light, lingering head. Very sweet, floral nose. Exceptionally sweet on the palate, again with the honey and a tinge of hops. Fairly thin, but overall it's more than acceptable. A good session beer for hot days, which is I'm sure why it's popular with the folks in Atlanta and Athens.","ElGordo","Oct 10, 2003"
4.37,20.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Honey colored with a white frothy head - wish it stuck around a bit longer. Smell is pale malts, very sweet, and a crisp hop aroma. The taste is fantastic. I admit, I'm partial to this brew - it's my favorite local beer and has been for years. It just hits me right. A crisp bitterness hits first, followed by a good depth of malt character, and then a fruity dry finish. I love it. This is my definition of a great session beer - it's interesting enough to drink for hours, but not overwhelming, filling, or overly intoxicating.","jlervine","Sep 11, 2003"
3.12,-14,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Overall an average ale. No off flavors or bad taste, just nothing special about this beer that would make it remember it a hour after drinking it.","purplehops","Mar 04, 2003"
3.72,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I like the taste of this beer. The hops & malts seem to be in balance. I would like a little more hops in my pale ale, so that is the only fault I can really find with it. Stays almost sweet instead of bitter throughout. Mouthfeel is decent, but a little thin. I think you could drink a lot of this beer. The beer went very good with the shrimp and crab claws I had for an appetizer.","Redrover","Feb 12, 2003"
3.42,-5.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours a pleasant to the eye golden yellow, and is topped by a modest white frothy head, that as it evanesces leaves a fine sheet of lace to hide the glass. A slight Georgia peach sweetness hits you up front, malt, fresh and clean, quite pleasant with the start ambrosial and the top slender in feel. Finish is sparsely carbonated with pleasant hop spiciness and the aftertaste lightly sweet and very dry, quite quaffable.","Gusler","Jan 07, 2003"
3.8,4.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Golden yellow in color with a white head. Aroma is somewhat malty for a pale ale. This beer is an easy drinker with a good, but very mild flavor. Not aggressivley hopped. More balanced than I expect an APA to be. Finishes crisp and clean. Very drinkable. Probably the best Atlanta beer I had while there. Solid, but not very exciting.","PhantomVodoo","Dec 31, 2002"
3.82,5.2,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Great session brew. Amber/Gold with a white head (thin) and very little lacing. The smell is off citrus, some spice and malt - I did not get much of a hoppy smell. The flavor is malty, citrusy, with a bit of hops at the end. It has a bit of a sweet taste in it that I cannot pin down. The beer is refeshing and easy to drink. With a shortage of options in GA, this was always a good choice, and I still enjoy it (A friend from GA brought up a bunch on Thanksgiving).","doho95fu","Dec 03, 2002"

Sweetwater 420 is a rich and tasty pale ale that will cause you to ask that time honored question: ""Did I drink all those already??""","maccroz","Oct 29, 2002"
4.3,18.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The flavors playing in this pale are interesting.  Up front, it starts fairly sweet and astringent, almost like a wheat.  Suddenly, the astringency fades and the hops take over, and almost as suddenly the hops vanish, and the finish is rather tart and clean, with little residual hops bitterness.  Sort of a hops Houdini act.","Brent","Jul 11, 2002"
4.47,23.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is one of the best beers I have ever had, to me it leaned more to the IPA side than the pale but I'm not complaining. Excellent hoppy aroma deep golden color and a taste to die for. This is for sure in my top 10.............CHEERS","tigerpaws","Jun 27, 2002"
3.2,-11.8,3,3,3,3,4,"I'm not really sure this should be called an APA. There's not enough hop presence and it's low in bitterness for the style. It does have a strong malt backbone, however, unfortunately there's little else to the taste. Solid, easy-drinking beer, but nothing spectacular.","aracauna","May 28, 2002"
