4.06,10.3,4,4.25,4,4,4,"On tap at the Bryant Lake Bowl. Brilliant copper gold under a 1" white foam collar that clings to the side of the glass. Floral citrus nose with traces of fruit. Sweet malt and light fruit on the palate give way to a balancing citrus rind bitterness. Medium body and carbonation. A bold, easy to drink pale ale.","pat61","Tuesday at 07:22 PM"

4.15,12.8,4,4,4,5,4.25,"Draft in a pint glass....nitro....thus the incredible creamy mouthfeel. Light brown/Amber with a 1/2 inch creamy head that stayed until draft was half gone. Light hoppy nose.  Tasted as expected light malt...light hop...slightly bitter... The nitrogenized draft made for a pleasant creamy mouthfeel...some would call it flat, but again just how I expected it to be......I had two!","wmickdds32","Apr 04, 2015"
4.02,9.2,4,4.5,3.75,4,4,"Pours an enticing golden copper with a nice foam head; good lace retention throughout. A fruity aroma hits you as well as a malt backbone and some floral esters that develop as it warms. Spicy, herbal, and bold piney hops taste as well as a slight lemon finish. Good pale malt backbone; I nevertheless would have liked some of the fruity elements of the aroma to match the taste a tad more. Medium light bodied, prickly carbonation and very drinkable; definetely a session brew. I  liked it a lot and will get again for sure.","Gajo74","Apr 02, 2015"

Part of the issue, though, is that I am a Stout, Breakfast Stout, and IPA lover, so Pale Ales just don't do it for me. However, I have had other pale ales and enjoyed them more than this particular one. This is my least favorite Founders beer.","chopp02","Mar 25, 2015"

This tells me it is a smaller batch brew; not mass produced! Smell- not entirely distinctive; faint hops but not very fragrant. Taste- very good for style. Well balanced-  crisp high quality water is used here, light in the hops. I am not the biggest APA guy but this is a good one. Feel- carbonation, dry finish as advertised.

It does a great job balancing the Cascade hops with fruit to avoid a too sharp pinch-you-in-the-face experience. I enjoy it from the bottle, typically poured into a goblet or weizen glass. It's very hazy with a nice, hoppy and floral aroma. I dare say the hops are mild. The head leaves you rather quickly but I see lacing. Hops are very present in the taste but its again mild and balanced with citrusy fruit and a clean, dry finish. The best news is that I don't count this among Founders finer brews, and it's still great! If ever you find yourself in/around Grand Rapids, MI, the brewpub located downtown is a must see (seriously, it's impressive only to look at) and sports amazing, seasonal offerings.","ob_carr","Sep 09, 2014"

Great citrusy hop aromas due to the dry hopping process dominate the smell, there is also a bit of clean caramel in there also to give some balance. The taste too is almost all hops. A lot of resin and bitterness with the typical cascade flavor profile is all right out front. The rest of the beer is pretty clean with the malt flavors falling into the caramel, biscuit range perhaps not enough malt or enough range in the malt flavors to balance the hops for the style. Nice levels of carbonation along with assertive bitterness make this a tingly beer, the finish is bitter and long lasting. Overall this is a middle of the road APA, the hops are trying to push this beer into the IPA category while the malt just isn't where it should be for this style.","fank2788","0"

Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and citrus/floral hops; with solid strength.

Very nice flavor balance of citrus/floral hop flavors with bready malts; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, lightly sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish.

Dry hopped pale ales are becoming my new favorite thing, so to see it so muted at this point is rather saddening. I bought this two weeks ago, and broke it from a six pack, but I've no clue why it was still sitting around. It still is crisp, and amazingly resemblant to the flagship West Coast PA flavor, but it has way too much lemon going in on in it, and not enough else other than the earthy grains. Not horrible, but not up to par on Founders' standards.","magictacosinus","May 14, 2013"

Of ALL the Pale Ales I've had (NOT INCLUDING the India Pale Ale style) this Pale Ale made an INSTANT impression on me and actually SURPRISED me because it had the agressiveness of an IPA - certainly due the dry hop treatment. It instantly had a nice crisp burst of flavor with a citrusey edge and that slowly dissipating aura of a green forest. Very, very nice beer - NICE JOB! I have had about 7 styles of the FOUNDERS so far and I have liked every single one. I expect Pale Ales to be more malty - this beer encourages me to look for more dry hopped beers.","GoldHorde","Jan 04, 2013"

The first thing that hits you is that sharp floral lemon noted in the aroma, but as it works its way toward the back of your mouth, there's a slight waxy bitterness the brings out the "floral" nature of the hop profile in a much more pronounced fashion. Malts are fairly absent from the taste, as I can only faintly pick out the general "sweet" bready notes I found in the aroma. Others seem to find them more forthcoming in the taste, but whatever. Carbonation is medium, and the slick mouthfeel makes this incredibly sessionable. Again, this isn't going to blow any minds, but it would be foolish to think that this is the beer's intention.

I can smell iced tea lemon with a faint hint of pine. Pleasant for a pale ale. The flavor offers much more hop bite than anticipated with a cracked wheat explosion of dry citrus and grass hops. It really roughs up the center of your tongue with crisp, slightly angry bitterness while tagging along a bit of grain sensibilities. I expect most would say that this is a bit harsh for a pale ale and could probably use some balance toward the malt and grain side, but I'm not complaining. Leafy, perhaps a bit oaky, this stuff is medium-light bodied, very fine but highly effective carbonation for a completely titillating feel with a bit of an aqueous quality. Not sure I'd want to session this pale ale, it's not Sierra Nevada, but bravo for the hop love in a pale ale!","Durge","Oct 22, 2012"

It is something of a sleeper; interest builds steadily from start to finish, eventually juxtaposing a nearly ideal malt bill with hops that are finally able to catch up. In fact, the malt qualities offer a welcome reminder of Founders Harvest Ale. Hops come in a distant second, although this beer stops short of seeming truly malt-focused.","beagle75","Feb 12, 2012"

Has a very sweet malty smell with a hint of citrus and grains. Faint aroma but very pleasant. The sweet malt hits first in the flavor, followed by a smooth rush of bittering hops and light grain, with a touch of fruit. This one leaves you empty handed on the finish, dry and watery. Very drinkable, though. Crisp feel with medium carbonation and a medium body. Overall the only thing I didn't like was the finish in the mouth. Founders has a lot to offer, and I wouldn't make the pale ale a top priority to try among a lot of the other brews. But this is a good, mild session beer.","anth0ny","Beers"

Flavor is more soapy and way to watered down. There is a very light earthy and citrus mote. Light to medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall aromatous but watered down is what I take from this.

Oh well, here goes: It pours a clear light amber topped by a finger or so of dirty white foam. The nose comprises pine resin, mint, a touch of menthol, light spicy greens, and soft caramel. The taste holds notes of pine needles, lightly toasted caramel, light balsa, grass, light greens, flowers, and the slightest possible touch of orange peel. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a pretty enjoyable pale ale, one that's not too hoppy, but doesn't go too far in the other direction either. It's almost too easy to drink at times...","TMoney2591","Jan 04, 2012"

The Centennial IPA was mediocre, lacking the hop kick I was hoping for, especially with the Centennial right in the name. Same can be said about this Pale Ale. The label calls attention to it being a Dry Hopped Pale Ale. I get very little hop aroma from it after pouring into a pint glass. There's some bitterness (label states 35 IBU) but the malt backbone seems to dominate. Not a bad thing, just not what I expected given the label calling out the dry hopping and Cascade hops used. Maybe I've just been trying too many West Coast brews when I can find them here in MA. I fully expected much more hop aroma and flavor due to the label's description.

Deep dripping lace down the glass, and a bit of a bubble stream coming up from the bottom. Smell was big and strong. Big citrus players here, lots of orange and grapefruit. Very sweet smell, like orange sherbert or candy. Very nice and plesing to the nose, smells like it will be a winner. Taste struck me as odd, after all the sugary itrus in the smell, none really came through in the taste. There was a strong bitter hop presence, providing lots of IBU's however it was more of a pine,resiney type of hops, rather then the sweet candy orange that came through at first. Nice and crisp, clean, very dry and long lingering finish, leaving a taste of burntor raosted pine for several minutes after a sip.

Taste is balanced, but lacking in real body. Flavor of roasted wheat, sweet barley, and citrus.

A tiny bit of lacing is left and the beer ends up looking almost like juice. Smell is big on malts and has a nice earthy hop backbone. I also get a tiny bit of citrus hop. The pale malts and grains are nice on the nose. I would like a bit more strength here as it is hard to get a large amount of anything on the smell. Taste has a very nice massive malt backbone. The hops are earthy and some are floral. There is nice hop taste melded in with the flavors and bitterness to compliment the overall taste and feel of the beer. It is very nice to get huge malts in an APA. The hops certainly help to add a nice backing to the malts though. Body is light but has some creaminess to it, which I like. The carbonation feels extremely smooth and there is no warming at all. Very nice feel for an APA. If this one was a bit cheaper it would be the ultimate session beer.

The nose is grainy with oat, meadow grass elements, on the whole somewhat flat, corn with a little oiliness, the citrus indistinct, the malts impart a rye bread quality, for its relative cleanliness it is heavy and without much lift. Full-bodied, moves at a slower pace, not languid, but in no rush. More hoppy than malty without being so in a biting manner, just has that herbaceous graininess which keeps it dry and cresting on and off the tongue. For its weight the carbonation is noticeable and helps to funnel things forward. Orange, lemon citrus, not much, if any, grapefruit. More generic "resin" than pine, some nuttiness and malted milk ball flavors. Entirely without flaws, however, needs a touch more verve.","farrago","Apr 05, 2009"

Founders PA leans heavily on the malt in this offering, some citrus hop shines through, just not quite enough for me to put this up there with my favorites. This has a solid quality taste none the less. The body was the biggest let down for me. Thin and not nearly as creamy as I would hope for, losing almost all its carbonation after a couple swirls of my snifter.

A touch of pine and bitter resins greets the back of the palate, but for the most part this beer tastes like (slightly stale) crystal malt. Mouthfeel is a step in the right direction, with a light body that's well-carbonated, giving it a crisp, clean finish that allows the bitterness to linger for just long enough.

I get this generic hop feel with no structure; a bit of bitterness, and no nice crystaly malt finish. I feel like this sample is probably very old because this, in no way, tastes dry-hopped.

Beer is currently being served at fridge temp (I've had it at all temps by now, and on a hot summer day nothing beats a cold PA). Poured into an American pint glass. A nice fluffy off-white head formed, and slowly receded to a layer of foam floating on top of the beautiful brew. This beer is clear, and straw colored. Aroma is clearly dominated by citrusy American hops. Lots of aroma is being eminated, no need to even swirl to get a full "wiff". The aroma told the truth, flavor is dominated by a smooth and mild citrusy hops flavor, with a nice smooth maltiness to bask it up. For a pale ale, this is pretty damn hoppy, but still alittle mild for me. Definitely not your average PA. Founder's seems to like to have a certain degree of thickness in its beers, and that is seen here. Most other pale ales I have are pretty light bodied, but this has alittle more to it, no where near the body of its others though. Drinkability is amazing. I love this beer, but normally go for the more hoppy Centennial IPA, or Red's Rye. If you are liking your PAs and are afraid to move on to IPAs, I'd use this as a stepping stone. I think its one of the better pale ales out there.","Avagadro","May 31, 2006"

Nice lacing was noted on the interior of the glass. Aromas were of roasted malts and hops. Hints of citrus hang in the back. Taste is very straightforward, but well crafted. Lots of malt mixed with blends of citrus flavors and some dry grain and hops. Nice. Mouthfeel was good enough, but I would've cared for a more slick feel. Drinkability is pretty good.

I gotta say..I am not a fan of the overcarbonated bottles (other reviews show this is not an extremely rare thing with this beer). Aroma is pale malts and light citrus (orange peel?). The taste is good for a pale ale..very flavorful without being over the top in any single aspect..mostly pale malt character with a notable dry-hop addition.

Hop flavours are mostly citric and a bit harsh. Finishes extremely dry with a bit of malt and lingering pine needle bitterness. Carbonation is indeed very high, giving this lighter bodied beer an airy texture. But the astringent dryness and harsh hop character make this less than a favourite.","DrJay","Jul 10, 2005"

Taste is minimally of pale malts, and the switches to hops mode, which are restrained, yet remaining flavorful. Just seems the flavor profile lacks a bit of something, but still good.

Hop flavor isnt really too evident here, I mean it is here, but not very noticeable, you couldnt pick it out of a line up. The bitterness rounds out this brew.

Absolutely wonderful hop flavor. Nice malt backbone as well. The hops have a solid bitterness to them and a noticeable but restrained citrus flavor. Very smooth both in bitterness and mouthfeel, with a vibrant tingling from the carbonation. Drinkability is terrific, as 12 ounces was finished much too quickly.

3.71,0.8,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Slightly hazy, pale gold in hue, it is a pale color, even for the style. There is a barrage of carbonation, the head reached epic proportions, at the zenith this foam was five-fingers, I mean, there was a fist of foam. It sat on top of the beer like meringue. It took multiple attempts to fill my pint glass. Those are the breaks. In time the head faded to a tight, frothy cap. Subsequent lacing was clumpy and widespread. On the whole this beer looks good. The nose offers flaky citrus, kisses of pine bark, orange zest, sugar, and neutral grain hints. The bouquet is very muddled; it fails to articulate its point. Based on the nose, it seems to be saying, Im not very bitter and I have little malt base. Those comments dont compel me to quaff. There is nothing off about the bouquet; it just is messy with no direction, no depth, no start and thus no finish. Flat. The palate isnt exactly what the nose said it was going to be. There is some bitterness in the middle; it is heavy and awkward though. The start is skinny and weak with minimal flavors, speckles of citrus and pine. In the middle these flavors turn louder and some raw leafiness is introduced along with some musty, hoppy residue. This aspect is quite pleasant. In the finish the beer houses a good dose of fruitiness (rather nondescript, more berry-like and citrusy then anything else) and some yummy marshmallow flavors. Sugar. Heat. The nose was correct about the malt; it is unremarkable aside from a kiss of caramel. The aftertaste is warm and raw. This beer ends much better than it starts and it tastes more complete then it smelled. But at its best this beer is only above average, as an APA it is solid. Overly carbonated mouthfeel, I really dont like this feeling it is spritzy and airy. Medium/medium-light in body, this beer needs more malt as it falls apart right before I swallow. Empty. This beer is easy to drink; it is a BBQ beer or a beer for chili. Im not knocking it but Im not going to go out of my way to drink this beer again. I was very happy to purchase a six-pack in Iowa City, IA. If the circumstances were right I would drink this again. It is solid overall but lacks finesse and depth. In that sense this beer is forgettable, in the moment it is quaffable. I shall enjoy the rest of the bottles I have. It is uncomplicated but tasty worth a try.","bditty187","Feb 23, 2005"

Afterwards more hops come up and leave an almost lime taste with yet more citrus and a light bitter finish. This beer is nice and crisp with a creamy mouthfeel almost. As for drinkability this beer is quite nice, almost like a mellow IPA that still has a good hop hit. Overall a solid beer that's nicely balanced with the hops dominating only a little over the malts.
