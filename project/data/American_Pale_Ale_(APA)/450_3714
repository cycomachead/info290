Clean pale malt. The hops are lemony and grassy. The malt is pale and unobtrusive. Has some cracker elements to it. A bit of citrus rind. Body is very light. There is a good dose of flavor packed into this diminutive brew. The carbonation is very peppy. Drinks easily. Would be an easy sixer to do away with.","VelvetExtract","Sep 23, 2014"

The aroma is malty, with nice bread notes and a little hint of earthy hops. The taste is equally mild, somewhere between a pilsner and a pale. It's an interesting combination. It's got a lighter body, most likely from the malt bill, but there is a nice crispness on the finish. This is a good session pale ale.","delta490","May 06, 2014"

Aroma is on the subtle side with citrus and floral hops and pale malts. Flavor is also easygoing with a nice balance of sticky malts and crisp hops leading to a dry, refreshing finish. Mouthfeel is light for style. Overall, at 4.6%abv, it makes for a very sessionable pale ale. I had a few and kept my shit together.","EagleTalon","Apr 14, 2014"

3.77,2.2,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"O - I enjoyed this beer. The orange zest tea element is fairly strong so I wouldn't want this all the time, but it is a refreshing alternative to a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale with elements of a Daisy Cutter Pale but with a low ABV similar to a 21st Amendment Bitter American, which I prefer over this. Perhaps the closest beer to this is Surly's Bitter Brewer, which has a similar citrus tea flavor and low (4.0%) ABV. I will definitely have this flavorful, sessionable Pale Ale again.","Tucquan","Jan 02, 2014"

Have a Flying Fish Octerberfish clogging up the lines now. Will be sure to get this after I purge the fish. Or perhaps a Long Trail, Brooklyn. Update: ordered 1/2 barrel Yards PPA 9.26.13, should be as good as the 1/6 I had before the (still working on) fish. At $165 +tax (1/2) and $75 + for 1/6 it is a bit up there, but as me sailing friends tell me ""you only live once"". Is that true?","Leftsailor","Sep 20, 2013"

This bit pours a clear sunlight straw topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam and populated by a decent amount of floaties. The nose comprises cantaloupe, light honeydew, very light leek, and a soft touch of toffee in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, though the fruit notes are toned down a good deal (though by no means do they disappear) in relation to the toffee. There's also some light banana and orange peel tossed in for good measure. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a silky feel. Overall, a nice pale ale, nothing that truly distinguishes it from many others, but a very solid offering nonetheless.","TMoney2591","Dec 02, 2011"

Fresh aroma, filled with sweet malts, crisp hops, citrus zest, and light fruits. Flavor is nicely balanced between sweet bready hops, bright hops--citrus, pine, floral--and lightly and subtly fruity with notes of citrus and apricot.

Moderate mineral character that accents the hop bitterness IMO. Light and drying on the finish, there's a beautiful, crisp, clean, resiny hop character that lingers, leaving flavors of grapefruit zest and a firming bitterness. Light in body with a high level of carbonation that's both crisp and creamy, this feels quite wonderful on the palate. Not much yeast character is noticeable, this is all about a rather beautiful balance between the citrus hop resin and doughy malt. Surprisingly excellent stuff this, closer in concept to Alpine's Emerson than a traditional pale ale. Excellent IMO.","DefenCorps","Jul 07, 2011"

The carbonation becomes a liability to the weight and texture, which go up in bubbles before I can get a bead on them. Overall a very interesting beer that's a lot of fun to drink.

More than 2 fingers of white frothy head appear with decent retension and an abundant amount of lace clings in a sticky coating about the glass. Aroma is full of hops smelling like citrus, more particularly lemon and a touch of grass with some spice that tingles the back of the nose. Little bit of malt sweetness and grain comes through in the back of the aroma as well. Taste is minorly bitter upfront with a hop bitterness that tastes like a mixture of lemon and grass, somewhat herbal.

Pretty aggressive bitterness makes it kind of hard to pick many other elements. It really seems like it could benefit from more of a malt backbone.

Very subtle biscuit in the aroma, but the taste revealed a little more bready maltiness. All of the citrus and biscuit really hits you at first, but my knock is that it disappears quickly.

The flavor lingers a bit too. Mouthfeel is crisp, refreshing, with carbonation a tad on the higher sider. A light body is present. This stuff is really good fresh, and of course quite quaffable.

It dissipated very slowly and left some lacing. Attempted to pour another slowly and the same thing-seems way overcarbonated. Dark brown ""flakes"" settled to the bottom of the glass-maybe yeast, but have not ever seen that before. Smells of citrusy hops and slightly herbal. Tastes of hops with biscuity malt and an earthy taste. Mouthfeel is light and very carbonated. I think this was an interesting brew.

4.14,12.2,4,5,4.5,3,3,"Philadelphia Pale Ale is an English IPA with a darker color than the traditional IPA but still lighter than an amber. The spicy aroma is indicative of the hoppy bite this beer imparts from the first sip to the last. The hop selection for this beer covers the malt flavor and has no hint of citrus. I was impressed that Yards did not apparently filter this beer and allowed the yeast to sit in the bottle and condition this ale naturally. The bottle conditioning added a larger bubbled white head that had great staying power as this ale was consumed. I would suggest serving this beer closer to 50 degrees than to 40 degrees to let the hop aroma fill the glass and come out of the beer. Be cautious in opening and pouring this libation, the yeast in the bottle have added quite a lot of carbonation.","DevilDogBeer","May 18, 2005"

After several tries, a large foam light yellowish head sat on top of a very cloudy straw colored beer. Smells of citrus, dish-soap, and pine sol. Uhhm. Not so good. Reminiscent of Arcadia batch #999. Tastes actually pretty good. Nice malt sweet mixing with hop bitter. I feared a soap or overly piney and co-humulone flavor but instead got a moderate orange and grapefruit with some gentle fruits (peaches and some apricot). The ending was a bit thin and the mouthfeel was mediuim light. Carbonation was about right, which is funny considering the excessive head during the pour. Drinkable? yea, if you're willing to wait for the head to settle.","mentor","Feb 15, 2005"

The head holds the whole way through with sudsy like appearance. The smell is all grapefruit like hops with little malt, very appetizing. The taste comes across with strong grapefruit and lemon citrus flavor with sharp acidity and carbonation. It's a little thin on the malt sweetness and body, so it comes across a bit out of balance on the side of citrus hops. I'm all for a low ABV brew, but this one could use a little more gravity to balance everything out. But on the other hand, if you are looking for a sharp flavor to pair with some food, this may be a good choice.","yeagerbm","Jan 17, 2005"

Not the most flavorful either but that taste was interesting as there was a bit of caramel malt mingling with the citric flavors with a touch of pine. Pretty good flavor that could have been better if it was a bit less subtle and tried to get noticed. Mouthfeel was about average for the style with no particular pluses or minuses.

The body is medium and its very fine, natural carbonation lends a gentle zest to the tongue before it fades smoothly away. The flavor bristles with bright, fresh hops (fruity, citrusy, subtly pine-like) wrapped in a supple, straightforward malt.

There are copious amounts of yeast/sediment in the bottom; I had to leave about an inch left in the bottle to keep my pint clean. It smells of light hops and oddly (for a PA) of yeast. I think they could have left off with the bottle conditioning, and the CO2 level is too high anyway with the large and annoying head. Taste is very dissapointing. Thin and smooth with a strange phenolic bite and minimal hopping. Even the malt seems to be missing. Thin mouth, not tasty enough to have a high drinkability.

It has a smooth, grainy pale malt flaavor that seems a bit watery and weak. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

The hops aren't overpowering and the malts didn't add as much flavor as I was expecting. There is a floral taste to go along with a citrus flavor to leave a tangy dry taste.

The flavors of licorice and ginger poke through a heavy bitterness. The body is fairly smooth for such a gushing head. The yeast comes through in a bisuity finish.

Very clean finish, but there is no malt body to speak of, no sweetness, just strong piney bitterness. I actually find it hard to drink because it's just not that enjoyable. This beer is like drining a macro with a bunch of hops dumped in early in the boil and a slightly restrained carbonation. I'd take a Rolling Rock over this any day.
