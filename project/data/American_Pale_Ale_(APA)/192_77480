Pours crystal clear golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of lemon, mango, peach, pineapple, orange zest, grapefruit, light pine, floral, caramel, light honey, and bread. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes with good malt balance. Taste of lemon, peach, orange zest, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, pine, floral, light caramel, bread, and light honey. Light citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, tropical fruit, pine, floral, light caramel, bread, and light honey on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop notes; with a solid malt balance that still showcases hop flavor; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale ale. Damn nice complexity and balance of hop flavor with good malt balance; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 13, 2013"

This poured a deep amber color like tree sap with almost no light penetration. The head was generous, puffed up and the color of fresh pizza dough, leaving great lacing all over the glass. The smell was very much west-coast hop resins and oily citrus fruits. There was lots of lemon zing and some grass notes as well. The taste and mouthfeel made a good show on the palate. It was a good medium mouthfeel with that zing and crisp finish. The taste was pretty sweet, again like lemons and maybe some oranges with a good strong bittering finish.

I'm happy that New Belgium didn't decide to join in on the Hop madness that seems to be going around, and try jamming this pale ale full of IBU's like a lot of the other brewery's are doing right now with there, APAs, IPAs ans IIPAs. That being said though this pale ale definitely doesn't leave you particularly wanting in that category either. I really like how unique this pale ale is, it's definitely one worth remembering. It's mildness coupled with it's low ABV make this beer incredibly sessionable. I could definitely see myself enjoying this beer while doing some work outdoors. While hop heads may want to reach for something a bit more their style, anyone who considers themselves an all around beer lover should give this beer a shot.","Zachtheporter","Apr 22, 2012"

Nice flavors, with a wonderful sweet malt and a nice easy bitterness at the end, with some slight citrus and slight floral.

4.42,23.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I really liked this beer and I thought it was a really good example of an American Pale Ale. This beer had great balance and was very true to style, with just enough hops for the style. It had very good drinkability, it went down way faster then I expected, it was refreshing and crisp, it wasn't filling, and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention. I would be perfectly fine with drinking a six pack throughout the day. What I liked most about this beer, was just about everything, with the balance being one of the highlights of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was the fact that I can't buy it in Michigan, if I could it might be one of my go to American Pale Ales. I would for sure buy this again if I was somewhere where New Belgium was sold, but since they aren't available in Michigan, I doubt I will be having it again any time soon. I recommend this beer to just about anyone and especially if you are a fan of American Pale Ales. New Belgium came though with one damn good American Pale that I really enjoyed, I just wish I could buy it at the store, good job guys you are one solid Brewing Company and with beers as good this you can be sure that I am more than willing to try more of your different brews. When Comparing this beer to their Mighty Arrow Pale Ale, this beer comes out on top in every aspect and that makes Dig a better American Pale Ale.","StoutHunter","Apr 14, 2012"

Color is a very clear orange amber with some nice bubble trails. Aroma is malt, hop, caramel, earth, spent grist, a little fruit and citrus. Flavor's much like nose, very well balanced with the bitter, sweet, and tang just right. Body is just right for this beer, a few round high points from hop and acid, full mouth.

These days it takes more than a good product to hit it big, branding is key. So where did New Belgium come up with Dig? As a name for a beer, it is pretty poor. Anyway, Dig, despite poor branding is not a bad effort from a drinkability standpoint. Amber in color, thin but persistent head, but not much in the aroma column get things started. Smooth experience going down, almost a dry feeling, with very little aftertaste. Flavor is a balance between malt and subtle hops from start to finish; one never gets in from of the other. In the end, the Dig is a very drinkable beer, with no outstanding qualities, but no shortcomings other than an odd name.","iSip","Mar 27, 2012"

This go round, Mighty Arrow Pale Ale was replaced by Dig Pale Ale. Dig pours a light copper, almost amber with a thin, off-white head that provides a lot of lacing. a bouquet of hop aromas dominate the nose, with whiffs of tropical fruit, grapefruit, and lemon all very noticeable. Very little malt flavors are detectable on the pallet, with the bolder notes going towards lemon, orange and passion fruit hoppiness, before a dry finish.

It's got more bite than many Pales and could be considered a wanna be IPA (maybe New Belgium set out to build a complex IPA, but settled with this Jr. version and slapped on the Pale label...or not, they're pros after all). Finishes drier than some of the easier drinking Pale Ales, but I still like it. In my opinion this beer will be a good companion for summer BBQs.","BCraig","Feb 29, 2012"

The chalky character is reduced, and there's more lemon, peach and even some floral characteristics present. Bitterness is medium-low, and the hop flavor is quite nice in the mix. Sweeter flavors, with honey, toast and a little caramel, are noticeable, but aren't prominent right now. Drying on finish with a refreshing bitterness, this is quite nice on the palate. Almost over-carbonated, this has a mild carbonic acid bite, especially on the finish. While the bitterness is low, it does have a nice snap to it. Apart from that, however, there isn't much I can say in a particularly positive light as this beer is just... bland.

Wonderful aroma; initial hit of some sweet but bright lemon rind. Following behind that is the sweet tropical fruits and caramel malt. As it warms, the sweet layer becomes the dominant aroma. I wish the aroma could have been a little bigger and bolder but it is still mighty fine. Flavor is awesome (though again, I wish it could have been a little more assertive and smacked you in the face); sweet, tropical fruity, some peach, and a touch of prickly bitterness. A little pepper and hop bitterness lingers. Very nice and well balanced. A medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel with a bunch of carbonation. It needs the carbonation, though not sure it needs as much as it has. Not that big a deal though. Overall, I think this beer is pretty much fantastic and my first New Belgium six-pack offering that I have been genuinely pleased with. I tried a bunch of stuff I didn't care a heck of a lot for (some were decent but average, others just plain no good) but it was all worth it to get to this. Great seasonal, I look forward to drinking a bunch of this during its release.","denver10","Feb 12, 2012"

Its not bad by any means, I just think they could have showcased the zesty, lemony Sorachi hops better with a cleaner, more lightly malted beer.

Something about this beer strikes me as unusually good-looking. The nose comprises sparkling lemon zest, light peach, light caramel, and a touch of minty pine needle. If some of these were a bit stronger, this would smell damn pleasant; as it is, it ain't close to bad. The taste halts the love train, bringing notes of orange peel, grapefruit rind (in both cases, the white part only, along with a lick of the unwashed outside), light caramel, light pine resin, and bitter, chlorophyll-laden grass. I'm gonna assume the Sorachi hops ruined things, as usual, but it's not normally like this when they do, what with the sharp bitterness and all... I got nothin'. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a nice-looking and -smelling beer, but one that falls apart in the flavor department.

Biscuity malt scent is hard to pick up on until the brew has a chance to warm up somewhat. Has a transparent coppery amber color and a two finger soap detergent texture of a head with nickel-sized loops of lacing left behind with each sip. The taste starts out with a white pepper and Saaz-like crisp spiciness emphasis, than somehow manages to visit every kind of hopping flavor profile in rapid succession EXCEPT for tropical fruit and pine resin, all at an appropriately gentle level for a Pale Ale, and balanced with a bready malt. I'm impressed with the high level of flavor complexity considering how restrained and subtle it is. Texture is medium-light, well carbonated, zippy and crisp across the tongue.
