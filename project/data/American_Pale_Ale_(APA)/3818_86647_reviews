"Good taste.  Would recommend to get a case!"
"12 oz bottle poured into a stemmed glass, above average APA."

"If you've been disappointed by US Craft attempts at a balanced Bitter or Special Bitter type ale, bottle conditioned or otherwise, this one will too."

"In short- IPA flavor in a pale ale. Saw that this was on tap at the Jersey City Barcade and I had to go try it out. I have had bottles of this before and very much enjoyed them. Given the conceit of this beer I figured having it on tap was necessary. Rich citrus, hoppy flavors, medium bodied and very easy to drink; like, I could drink this all day.It might be fun to try. I really like this stuff."
""
"O: a sessionable pale ale, not the most complex flavor but enjoyable"
""
""
""
"O:  Great beer.  Will have again."
"2nd time I've had it in bottle and it's a good drinkable beer."
""
"I live 15 minutes from Southern Tier Brewing Company, so it's always nice to pick up a keg right from the place in which the beer was brewed. More times then not I'm drinking this beer fresh, so my review might be bias. Great APA, with citrus notes of grapefruit and apricot taking over the aroma as well as the taste of the beer. Mildly hoppy. Reminds me of Founders All Day IPA in taste. Once in awhile I will notice inconsistency in the taste of the beer from batch to batch, but this is a great summertime beer, one I usually have on tap, and one I've been enjoying since I had STBCs trial run of this stuff a few years back."

"Poured cloudy, smells of hops and citrus, which was a nice surprise from a pale ale. However? Where's the hop taste? It just struck me as funny with a big hop nose and a little hop taste, but whatever. Regardless, It's still very good. I wouldn't recommend."
"A little hoppy and citrusy in the nose. Clean taste  some nice lacing  head fades"
"Love this beer. Was able to enjoy this one while watching the game with friends was very impressed."
"Not sure if I got a bad bottle or not but a funky fruit like aroma and taste. Maybe citrus. Just tasted very off to me. Not one of my favorite brews from southern tier."
""
""
""
""
"Nice and crisp. Quite hoppy and carbonated for a pale ale. Thin and light nonetheless. Delicious nose. No award winner yet exceeded expectations."
""
""
"Had it on draft... Live beasts didn't seem to impart much"
""
""

""
""
""
""
"A very slightly cloudy yellow with thin, but lasting head; smells of lemon/citrus; fairly typical pale ale with good hop features; mild bitter that lingered a bit too long for my liking;a fairly standard and very drinkable if you prefer this style"
""
"A nice dry pale ale that still manages a fruity character.  Very tasty and easy to drink, lives up to Southern Tier's lofty standards."

"aside from the fact that the bartender cant put a head on this beer to save her life, i really like this one. its golden and a little hazy, but still light enough looking in the glass. what makes it special is its hop profile. definitely new zealand varietals in here, high alpha and high oil, fruity and tropical and almost smells like a lotion some young hottie should wear, its that intense aromatically. the flavor shows the hops just like the nose, less perfume and more grassy summery feel to it, which is welcomed. the malt bill appears to contain some wheat, and has that sort of texture, which helps the hops last just a little longer. its only a little bitter too, more tangerine than anything else in the finish, which lasts awhile. overall a really really good pale ale, maybe a touch more body than it needs, but i like it this time of year, where the feel suits the season but the flavor teases summer, hard to do that well. this is top notch flavor-wise."
""
"I hate to even mention the word surprise but it was a bit of one for me. Some of the Southern Tier six-pack offerings have been hit or miss in my experience but it has been quite some time since I've consumed them. The bright, fruity hops are matched very well by the bready malts in the finish. The live yeast seems to give the body a nice boost which helps the flavors truly shine."
""
""
"Nice and drinkable with enough hops to keep me interested."
""
""
"Drinkable but boring.   Too many tasty sessions out here on the West Coast to look out for this again.  I'll stick to ST's tasty big beers."

"A very good beer, and when you consider the cost it is a good go to, but still could not give it an outstanding rating."
""
""
"On tap at local Brass Tap.  Nicely balanced.  Would gladly drink again"
"Pours a golden yellow with a fluffy white head, some lacing. Aroma is of pleasant orange citrus esters, floral and citrus hops and a mild tangy grapefruit flavor, some caramel malt as well. Taste same as aroma. Palate is a medium body, crisp, smooth and good carbonation. Finishes with a citrus orange flavor, caramel malt, some tangy grapefruit on the tongue. A very good, flavorful and tasty summertime brew."
""
"More of a session IPA than a true APA."
"Nice hop aroma with balanced malts.  Pleasant tasting with mild bitters.  Clear gold short lived Snow White head.  Good enough to please Grumpy."

"Very nice, easy drinking. Pours a pale yellow with a nice head. The smell was full of hops in the beginning but you could also pick up subtle notes of sour fruit and a little bit of toasted bread. The taste was highly refreshing with crisp hop notes throughout that created a wonderful beginning and finish. Light but very good."
""
""
"Overall: Refreshing, not overpowering."
""

""

"O-Pleasantly surprised by this one.  I've been underwhelmed by this brewer previously.  I wouldn't buy a six of it while considering my other options.  However, handed one or available in pint form at a bar would consistently make me happy."
""
""
"MF: Refreshing, keeps you coming back for more, med-bodied, great upbeat finish."
"This seems to be more like an IPA Lite rather than an APA. The bottle conditioning is the best part here because it adds such a wonderful mouthfeel with the added carbonation. Tone down the hops and you might be able to find a pale ale in there."

"Tasty beer! The ""Live"" is just a gimmick. They ought to package this on its own and give it a better brand name."
""

"Clear golden pour with a white one-finger head and medium carbonation. Really nice grapefruit flavor upfront. Medium body also has a good pine presence with hints of bread in background. Flavors are really well defined. Finishes dry with a mild lingering citrusy bitterness. Really good beer, grapefruit hop flavor is perfect."

"O - In all fairness Pale Ales are not my favorite style but this one is pretty sessionable. If you really enjoy the style it is worth a try. Its interesting how tame this beer is for Southern Tier, a brewery notorious for going over the top with sweetness, flavors, ABV and just about anything everything else."

"Poured from bottle into a glass. Hazy golden color with nice head that dissipates slowly leaving some nice lace. Light and drinkable. Subtle grapefruit notes followed by nicely balanced hop profile. Very sessionable. *Bottle-conditioning leaves natural sediment in bottom."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While bottle conditioned is far from rare, this one seemed to take that moniker very seriously; I haven't had a bottle open so violently from CO2 and/or bubble up for a few seconds after pouring."
""
"This pale ale might have the foamiest head I've ever seen on a beer from a bottle. A 2-3"" off white, fluffy head on every bottle I poured. There is the off-putting (to me) residue at the bottom of the glass, but otherwise the appearance is solid. Hints of grapefruit, floral hops, and yeast in the smell -- very nice. Hops and citrus overtones are the highlights of the taste. Easy to drink -- not too astringent, which sometimes APAs can be. Overall, very solid choice for a summer APA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great balance. Enough to satisfy the hop tongue and crisp enough to session. This is spring and summer in one. No need to go all the way down to the light IPA style brews. The live yeast gives extra shelf life , however being close to the brewery that's not an issue here. I've heard of at home kegs getting weak toward the end but never had issue in bars"

"The cloudier the better with this brew. In my experience with this beer, if u get crystal clear LIVE you have not recieved the best southern tier has to offer. However if your LIVE is all muddy u have the best beer offering the beer gods can deliver. Have yet to determine what makes this beer so muddy and great, wether it is early runs or later ones, or if sitting for awhile helps. If you discover the secret let me in!"

"O: Great drinkability. An APA that could be easily classified as an IPA. Quite hoppy, refreshing and... Delicious"
""
""
""
""
""
"Had on tap at Isaac Newton's in Newtown, PA. Served in a pint glass. Yellowish amber color. Closest pale ale I've had to an IPA. I very much enjoyed this beer. I find this as a good beer for those who aren't in the mood for all the bitterness of a full IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A well hopped pale ale yet balanced by slight malt and grassy character. Very refreshing and sure to please during the warmer months. I find myself drinking more IPAs and doubles nowadays, but this is a solid example of the style and I will consider this as a sessionable hoppy beer."

"Pours a nice amber with a two finger head. Smells yeasty and citrusy and very bright. Reminds me very much of a grapefruit like beer. Some pine like flavor. A very nice clean and refreshing beer. Has good flavor and good mouthfeel. Alcohol is well masked."
""
"This beer somehow ends up being a totally decent beer."
"Overall: For what it is, it's still a relatively pleasing beer."
"Golden hued with excellent clarity. Vibrant carbonation is evident with the inch thick rocky white head. Brussels lacing. Aroma of pale biscuity malt and a blend of hops is judiciously used. The feel is very light,smooth,and drinkable. There's the nice blend of piney and citrus hops on the front of the palate. I get biscuity pale malt following shortly thereafter. The fade is rather abrupt."

"Review from 4/2/14, on tap at Tribeca Tap House, NYC. Pours clear yellow gold color with a huge foamy 2 finger white head that was full of small bubbles and faded very slowly, leaving good lacing as it dissipated. Smells of lemon zest, citrus, malt, spring-like hoppy notes, grains and light caramel; nice balance and appropriate for the style. Tastes like it smells but with more citrus and piney hop notes to go along with the lemon zest, malt, herbs, grass, light bready grains and caramel; very has nice balance with a little malt sweetness that makes it very easy drinking. I drank 2 of these quickly as they felt nice and light with average to mild carbonation, a medium body and very good drinkability. Aftertaste was clean and near crisp, this was a definite session beer and one I’d like to try from a bottle. A solid brew."
""
" The taste is good with slight pine tinge from the hops with light citrus and slight astringent flavor like overbrewed tea with a mild malt flavor which adds sweetness to balance the slight bitter aspect. The taste of malt is pretty well interwoven with the hops and yeast as a pale should be. Overall this is a nicely flavored pale, not very complex or intense but it is good for the style"
""
""
"o. Scores range from a 4 to a 5 on this one. Have to say it is an excellent summer choice. Refreshing, playful, light. An outstanding beer that would be welcome at BBQ's and Picnics."

"BOD 11/31/13. Pours a clear gold with a slight amber cast when decanted. Massive well formed head with superb lacing. Nice nose of citrus against a slightly sweet background. Very light medium body with average carbonation. The flavor profile is a mild grapefruit citrus focused bitterness against a biscuit background. A very slight spruce note is also present. The finish is clean with a lingering grapefruit flavored light bitterness. A good session ale."

"I drank this right on the heels of Sixpoint Resin and Hi-Res (with pretzels in between of course). What a relief! I'm really enjoying this, my third Southern Tier pale ale (IPA and 2XIPA). Very, very balanced, floral hoppyness with enough bitter to add character but not to overwhelm. The perfect ""session"" beer!"

"A very easy drinking APA, smooth, BALANCED, hoppy, liquid gold. Would easily buy again, cheers!"
""
""
"Very subtle hop aroma and smell, pleasantly surprising how much the malt comes out in the nose. I would have to agree with ST and say it was a light copper, almost golden or blonde. Very clear, slightly carbonated, not undercarb'd. A fair bit of sediment settled in the glass. ST says there is a hop dominated flavor, which I don't get. The taste feels very balanced to me for a Pale Ale, the finish is where I get the most hop bitterness. It's slightly sweet, but very well rounded with the malts and hops. A lot of citrus and pine, slightly fruity. Mouthfeel is light, and with a 5.5 ABV very much drinkable and feels session worthy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is more sweet than many IPA's but there is a kind of juicy watermelon note on it as well, which I did not expect. The fruity character tends to take it all over. Moderate bitter finale."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very raw and powerful hop-centric pale ale that uses Citra quite obviously as its focal point. A little bit of rough yeast character adds to the raw feel of it too. More of a 'Shock and Awe' approach from Southern Tier, as they normally make very clean and focused beers. It's punishing in a good way, if you're a hop head and you like that sort of thing. It draws some comparisons to Zombie Dust in the way it wields the citra hop. A great buy at its price point and availability, and the concert ticket marketing really works for it. Great concept, great execution."
"O: I'd love to try this even fresher but it's nice as is"
"Delicious. The smell and taste is perfect; exactly what I love about hoppy beers: the grapefruit and citrus. Through and through, that's the theme, and it doesn't disappoint. The taste seems more akin to the IPA than just the Pale Ale. I wouldn't hesitate to get this again."
""
""
""
""
"Live pours a cloudy bronze color with a large lacing head. There is a fruity and floral aroma; nice and hoppy. The taste has a bold hoppy flavor, nothing else to take away from the hops. Very full flavors and strong body. Overall its a very enjoyable and tasty beer. Good hop flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly hazy medium gold color with lots of floaties in the glass and a bubbly white head that dissipates quickly to a ring on top. Aromas of lemon and grapefruity citrus with bits of pine resin and a light bready crackery malt to back it up. The flavor is bready malt with a hint of sulfur and a fair amount of citrusy hop flavor. Light level of hop bitterness. Medium to light body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a slick bubbly mouthfeel. Decent pale ale, certainly quaffable, but for the price I'd buy something different next time."
""
""
"O- A bitter, hop forward pale ale at 5.5% abv is a year round winner."
""
""
"Very good APA, tasty with good citrus complexity and still very easy to drink."
"Overall: This is a pretty solid APA, hoppier than standard for the style, but whats not to like about hops? Would gladly get again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Just a touch of corn/adjunct flavour is what keeps this beer from being truly great. Still a very good beer that is well worth picking up."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great tasting pale ale with some nice flavor features."
""
""
"D - A rather pedestrian American Pale Ale that has a tad more hop bite than most... Nothing remarkable nor nothing off putting... I absolutely love the label which is a collage of random used concert ticket stubs... A decent enough brew that I would gladly indulge again if provide the opportunity, but I'm not sure I would invest in a six-pack or case in the future..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice yellow with minimal head and lacing. The smell is unremarkable with a light hop smell if u try and find it. The taste is plain and really nothing good or bad in either direction. Not all that impressed. A very plain APA that I really have no desire to have again."
""
"I would pick this up again, in comparison, not nearly as accomplished as Hop Devil that I've had recently but a very good find."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-light to medium in body, with carbonation of medium to medium-high intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is at first fizzy, gradually tapering to a foamy mouthfeel. The carbonation is a bit too high for the beer, and the fizziness is not entirely pleasurable."
"O - Not a bad tasting Pale Ale. A solid taste is brought down by a lack of ""oomph", and a slightly watered down taste. Still a very drinkable beer. Won't buy this again, but I would certainly drink it if it were offered."
""
""
""
""
"Near great but ultimately just a really good beer. A near miss. Appearance is lovely. Light and cloudy. Smell is a vague citrus character. What puzzles me is the mouth feel, which is a bit over-carbonated and light for a pale ale. Yet the taste is the kind of light citrusy quality that might seduce you on a hot summer day. It's a really good beer but a seasaonal one."

"Overall it's another darn tasty one from Southern Tier. Definitely worth a try for pale ale lovers."
"My oh-so-gentle pour so as not to disturb the lees produced only a skim of wispy, tawny head. Color was a deep golden-yellow (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity and I was uninterested in playing referee to Midas, Croesus and Mammon, all who wanted some. Nose was predominantly grapefruit, but I felt like I smelled pineapple in there also. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste, while citrusy, was not as pronounced as it would be in an AIPA. I really felt like I was tasting pineapple on the finish, but I may have convinced myself of that on the nose. I will not feel slighted if you disagree with me on that. This was a very mellow beer, especially at the end of the day when I am contemplating an early rack time. My last trick was to swirl the remaining beer in the bottle and pour the lees. Waste not, want not, I always say. Now, I swear that I tasted pineapple! Could the yeast be imparting that flavor? Good stuff."

"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, golden-straw coloring with a thin, filmy, clingy, bright white head. Lots of carbonation throughout the body. Aromas of resin and grassy hops, with lemon and grapefruit tart and sweet highlights. Some floral highlights on the nose as well. Flavors of tart citrus sharply hit the forward tongue, with a blast of resin and bitter on the midtongue. The palate is a bit out of balance. Light, effervesced body that comes off sharp in places. The aftertaste is very tart and slightly bitter, again out of balance. Also some earthy and barnyard notes into the aftertaste. Tangy sweetness lingers into the finish, which is light, very crisp, and clean."

"O: A fine example of an American pale ale, one I think I like even better than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. A very refreshing cool drink on a hot summer day, the overall experience being somewhat like drinking a carbonated juice -- pear, perhaps, even though it doesn't *taste* at all like pear. It says something about this beer that not only I but both my parents like it; we have very disparate tastes in beer."
""
""
""
""
"There is not much I can say other than this was a phenomenal beverage. Went great with the homemade smoked ribs and beans/w pulled pork. Great smell. The aroma took off as soon as the contents were poured into a pint glass. The full body finish made my brain think I was drinking something slightly hit with vanilla. I truly enjoyed this beer. Definitely recommend."

"32 ounce growler from Blacklick Wine and Spirits. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear dark gold color with about an inch frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells mostly like citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) and pine hops, and some bready/wheat malt. It tastes like citrusy (grapefruit, citrus rind, mango) hops, pine hops, and bready malt. Taste doesn't seem to have as much kick as compared to the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and coating, and has good carbonation. It's easy enough to drink! Really wouldn't have had a problem getting a regular size growler of this. It's a good pale ale, I liked it."

"Overall, a really great beer from Southern Tier. Loads of hops while remaining fairly light and easy to drink."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, a small hop presence and malt balance. In the taste, a lighter pine like hops and balanced malt, a touch thin though. A small hop bite, but mainly smooth and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small hop dryness in the aftertaste. Truthfully, just a nice nice pale without over hopping at all."
""
"I thought it needs more flavor because it tastes somewhat washed out but it was good."
""
""
"Overall, would certainly recommend this beer, a very good pale ale indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - I'm really digging this one. This is a hopped up (NOT super hopped) APA that is quite refreshingly unique. I love the low alcohol, hoppy, APA combination that just absolutely works here. Southern Tier has crafted a winner."
""
"12oz bottle. Pours hazy-golden with tall, foamy, long lasting white head and soda-like carbonation. Aroma is of orange marmalade, citrusy hops and biscuit malt. Body is medium and tangy. Taste is of citrusy hops, oranges, pale malt and yeast. Finish is long and slightly bitter. Very tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
"O: A really pleasant bottle conditioned pale ale. I'm kind of glad I stumbled across this one. It's an incredible beer to drink on a hot day. I will definitely be picking more of this up in the near future and would happily recommend this beer to any fan of hoppy pale ales."

""
""

"o - Overall I liked this one quite a bit. i thought the nose was awesome with tons of tropical fruits, and the mouthfeel was great; smooth, creamy, and easy to drink. Taste was not as strong, though it is good, with less tropical fruits. Worth checking out and something I'd definitely have again."

"The body is medium and rather quaff-able. The beer coats the palate rather nicely, and definitely leaves the drinker wanting more after each sip. I'm loving what they did with this 'bottle conditioned pale ale, with 4 types of malts & 4 types of hops.' Complexity wins me over every time as long as it's not too bizarre. This gets my high recommendation - try it without hesitation!"
"Do not pass it by if you do not like other ST offerings. This one is spot on!"

"O: This is one of the better APA's I've had in a long time. Seriously delicious stuff."
""
""

"O: Nice drinkability, feels fresh and young and very crisp. The Hops are fresh upfront wtih a gentle dryness on the close. Very good overall no hesitation on repurchase. The way a good pale should drink."

"Overall, a very nice pale."

"O: Very enjoyable beer, way better that I expected. Worth checking out"
""
""
"Great hop character. A little weak in body. Could use a touch more malt. Impressive posturing, though a little bitter for my liking."
"Overall this beer suprised me , I didn't think it would be as good as it is. I really would love to see this made in cans for a nice lake beer , but not sure how the bottle conditioned flavors would lose out during canning"
""

""
""
""

"this really feels like a nice IPA that has been taken back a step or two. It has the tropical fruit hoppiness that I love without being too bitter or strong. The bottle conditioning adds to a great mouth feel. A real winner here and like I said above I will be picking this up again."
"O: Wow, can bottle conditioning really make that much of a difference? I’d like to taste a filtered version of this, but I doubt it’s going to happen; without that comparison, all I can say is that this is an unmistakably enjoyable beer. Cheers!"

"Most noticable taste is floral hops. Also, orange and lemon rind and just a bit of piney hops. Also tastes of light bread and yeast. Has a light mouthfeel with heavy and slightly biting carbonation. Great taste with this APA, I also am fond of the bottle conditioning and haze. the heavy carbonation is very refreshing and compliments the beer well."
""
""
"It's crisp in a medium body with an unexpected sort of smoothness off an even carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Where did all the fruit go? I get onions, piney hops and some floral underpinnings but lost all the fruitiness from the scent. Small bit of tangerines at the finish but it does not redeem this for me."
"A very good APA. Well balanced with good hop flavor."

"Pours a rich gold with an orange hue and slight haze. Frothy eggshell white head that fell off rocky to a cap and collar and left lace all over the glass. Nose is fantastic and tropical. Sweet like candy with light tangerine, orange, grassy, floral and perfumey hops. Malt is sugary sweet, deep with bread and honey. A little yeast on the nose to delight you further. Drinks so well. Smooth, light, sweet pine and orange. Earthy and dry. Plenty of malt depth it has a pilsner like grain that lets you know this is beer not candy. Very easy with a touch of oily bitter on the back palate. This is a full and indulgent ale from Southern Tier."

"A nice pale ale from a very good brewery."

"O- This is a good pale ale, I could put back a few of these with no complaints."
"Overall, this beer has whetted my appetite for Southern Tier, I shall explore them more."
""
"Super drinkability, not great on the verge of greatness"
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and onion and garlic hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus and herbal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that tastes better than it smells in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of Southern Tier's newer offerings, this continues their tradition of quality balanced, flavorful ales. The American pale ale designation is accurate, not overpoweringly hoppy with a solid pale malt base. Fruity and floral notes dominate throughout as opposed to the piney flavors of west coast hoppy ales. The live terminology refers to the active yeast in this unfiltered beer which give the beer a tart but not sour quality similar to belgian pale ales though it does not taste like a belgian yeast is used. Finishes clean and dry leaving the pallet wanting more, this is a beer that you could drink several pints of."
""
""
""
"Of the several ales I have tried from Southern Tier, this is possibly the best. They have brought all the elements together to make a very refreshing and quaffable ale, while maintaining flavor and a little complexity."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit of hops. Nothing mild about the taste. Hops, citrus, slightly dry, a touch of malts, lots of flavor here. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
""
""
""
""
"OV: A rather refreshing Pale Ale for those who enjoy a little hop bite. Some nice flavours, but nothing extraordinary. A pretty solid brew that is sessionable and can be paired with moderate to lighter fare."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazed copper hue with a light beige off white head looking great in my chalice, I love Southern Tier I always have it's nice to see them attacking a bottle conditioned pale ale they have been missing one for a long time. Aroma is citrus and mild pine all day with a bread biscuit malt character super fresh bottle it's almost like a Sierra Nevada clone with a bit more hop action. Flavors bitter waves of rolling hops intermingled with biscuit caramel malts a very clean malt profile no residual sugars left behind just super tasty stuff. The live concert theme goes very well with the overall presence that the beer offers due to the pure drinkability, it's the type of beer one could get away tailgating with only 5.5% abv great stuff. Hops are great enough bitterness to keep any hophead interested with enough balance to keep a newbie on board and not running away in fear. Mouthfeel is light to medium even carbonation flow very natural feel on the palate I'm a big fan of Southern Tier from the early days of great core session ales into their extreme path of bombers that have been hit or miss for some beergeeks."

"O: This beer feels like it has a lot more back-bitterness than many other APA's, and a little less upfront. It is pleasant to drink and I would say that it is above average. The APA range of beers runs the gambit of lighter to heavier hop bitterness. I think this one has a harshness that would be more accepted by IPA drinkers. I do recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good. A nice summery APA, if that makes sense."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy light amber with rocky white head, big patches of lace. Smell: pineapple, grapefruit, lemon peel are all here but somewhat underrepresented... light biscuity-ness beneath. Taste: lots of hop flavor and nice bitterness...sugared grapefruit, pine, lemon. Mild caramel and dried apricot. Medium bodied with a fluffy feel and semi-prickly carbonation poking through. Nice."
"O: I think this is a really easy to drink and enjoyable beer - I like the hop flavors/aromas and thought this was a nice new beer."
""
"Taste-Burst of white grapefruit, citrus rind, floral hop notes. Very crisp and refreshing. Nice flavor and balance. Very nice summer brew!"
"O: Live is a new entry to the New Orleans market. Seemed superior on tap, but this is a very, very good APA which is not far qualitatively from the West Coast paragons of the style, SNPA and Anchor Liberty. Quintessential hot-weather fare, and very sessionable at 5.5%."
""
""
""
"Something tells me this beer might kick ass were it consumed at Budokan... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, light sweet biscuit, sweet flowers, honey, light white grape, and a twist of lemon for good measure. The taste holds notes of grapefruit peel, light orange peel, mild grass, flowers, mild biscuit, and a vague sense of yeast. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice pale ale, one of the best I've had from Southern Tier in a long while."
""
""
"Taste: A lot of peach sort of flavors on the front, with a very nice malt finish. I find that Live smells quite a bit like an IPA, but it definitely drinks like an APA. Fairly high carbonation with a pretty light body, making it quite drinkable. Bitterness is low ... my guess would be that the IBUs are about 35 or so. The fruity and spicy hop front with the malt, SLIGHTLY drying finish make this a very good APA. Well worth trying out."
""
"Overall: a very refreshing and drinkable pale ale. Do the hops give it this lemon brightness? In any case, it would make a fantastic lawnmower beer."
""
""
""
"There’s no much carbonation, which gives the beer a very light body. I do wish it had more complexity and more refined cleanness. However, still a great pale ale. Spot on for beer lovers and a great intro to getting into hops, like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. For those who can't get their hands on Maine Co. MO, this is actually a competent beer for relativity. Huge hops, just a refreshing wonderful beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Southern Tier has a top notch APA on their hands here. Much more impressive than their higher gravity beers. I'll definitely be picking this up again."
""
""
"Overall – A decent brew overall. A little on the drier side for a APA for me with a slightly unbalanced hop flavor (It is just a combination of hop that leaves a rather strange aftertaste). Even so it is still somewhat tasty and a good one to try as I think may would enjoy it.."
""
"This was a welcome change of pace after the somewhat disappointing Dampf Loc. Hazy lighter amber pour, with a medium-sized, foamy, white head that receded to a thin layer, but never completely disappeared, and left some spotty lacing on the glass. Nice aroma crisp with fresh hops, pale malts and a bit of toastiness as well. More of the same in the taste, a good balance, fresh grassy and citrus hops, with a biscuity pale malt base. Simple and tasty. Light-medium body, easily drinkable, and worth revisiting."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice golden orange hue with a giant head, and some decent lacing. Nose is full pine resin, with a little honey and citrus. Woody flavor with bitter punchy hops and a tinge of sweet and savory. Overall, this is pretty good quaff."
"A very tasty, super easy to drink APA. Solid tropical hop profile and a mild bitterness. This was a pleasant surprise."

""

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with a thin off white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of bready malt and piney and grassy hops, light orange citrus and pineapple. Mild, but nice. Flavor of biscuit malt, grassy and lightly piney hops, light citrus, finishing with grassy hop bitterness and lingering biscuit malt. Light bodied. A nice, pale ale with no stand out features, but pleasant and well balanced."
"This pours a cloudy, golden yellow color with a foamy, beige head. There is a decent amount of citrus and hops in the aroma. This is perhaps a little more watery than I was expecting but it still delivers a great pale ale flavor. Drinks very smoothing making it a great summer beer that doesn’t taste like water. Finishes a little sweet and malty, pretty unique stuff."
""
"D: not too shabby. nothing thunderous, but certainly not a bad brew. just lacking that umph that I enjoy my favorite pale ales. maybe this is better a bit fresher, but mine isn't that old at 2.5 months, especially for a bottled conditioned brew."

"O - An okay pale ale. I would choose many other PAs/IPAs over this, but still drinkable."
""
""
"Live continues the theme that I'm seeing in a recent trend- big hop aromatics and taste upon a thin shell of malt. Generally low in alcohol but big on flavor- I like where this trend is going!"
""
""
""
"www.brewreport.blogspot.com"
""
"O - Now here's a really hoppy pale that this style has been screaming for. It's great to enjoy a low ABV hop bomb for a change, 'could drink several of these without getting stupid, Southern Tier has a winner here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Interesting brew that is very drinkable. Wouldn't mind having this once in awhile"
""
""
"Medium bodied with a dank, crisp hop bite that provides a strong bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malt into a bone dry finish. Very earthy with soil like flavor along with grass and pine needle followed by bready yeast, light fruit and biscuit malt. Sweet hints of apple, pear and subtle alcohol provide a decent counter to the strong hop flavors. Pale malt backbone with bread, biscuit and cracker. Light and well balanced and while its nothing out of the ordinary, it's a decent, sessionable beer."
""
"OVERALL: Good, but a little too dry and the thinness really kills the mood. Sweetness is on par and the rosemary scents were very original, unique, and welcoming. Just needs more maltiness to bring up the viscosity."
""
"O- A highly quaffable pale ale that doesn't skimp on flavor."

"O - A well done pale ale with lots of flavor, will buy a six pack next time."

"This is an APA that pushes towards an IPA. Tasty and hoppy. Sharp, but nice."
""
"Bang on APA. Recent bottle from Premiere. Citrus hop flavour is smooth and subdued. Gigantic head and good lacing with light orange body. Mild orange citrus aroma. Good hop taste without being an IPA. Excellent drinkability, and excellent subdued carbonation appreciated."
"O: Very easy to like. Granted, it's not a fresh bottle, but beggars can't be choosers, really. This really works well as simple refreshment."
""
""
""
"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its freshness through both the nose and the flavoring. The aroma opened things up beautifully, with hearty hoppiness and perfumy floral hops. This was balanced with just the right amount of sweetness of malt and juiciness of authentic fruit, making it highly inviting. The sip follows perfectly, striking that same balance of fullness and cleanliness. If anything, things are a bit light, but this is an excellent beer from a great brewery, and exceeded our expectations."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not the most interesting Pale Ale, but definitely worth a try. It's brewed well and balanced nicely. Southern Tier Rocks!"
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed the aroma and flavors of the hops in this beer—they were both strong like an IPA but the beer was very easy to drink and didn't have too much in the way of bitterness."
""
""
""
"Poured from tap at tap and mallet in Rochester ny. Pours a hazy golden - bottle condition. Nice hop aromas. Lots of citrus and some biscuit malt. Great citrus hop flavor...with a great biscuit balance. Its a bit tart but otherwise a nice brew and a solid pale ale."
""
""
"Overall: A very good American Pale Ale. Very good citrus flavor with a solid malt balance. One of the better takes on the style in a while."
""
"Pours a bright yellowish gold color with a big frothy white head. The head gives way to a little bit of lace on the glass. The aroma you can smell as you get close, pineapple, oranges, lemons and a little bready malt at the very back. The taste follows suit pineapple, mango, oranges and lemons fill the first part of the beer with a bready malt end. The taste is very well blended and very smooth. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall this is a very solid beer, it is a nice beer that you can enjoy multiply beers. Smooth and easy drinking."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: With all the big and bold IPAs, DIPAs, and Barleywines out there it is easy to forget how good an APA can taste. This is a good beer for anyone, newbies to the craft scene and hard core beer advocates alike. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
"D - Pretty straight forward and simple and there is nothing wrong with that. Will make a nice spring/summer refresher."
""
""
""

""

"The beer pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with 1/2 an inch of fluffy white head that dissipates into a thin blanketing. The nose is sweet and malty with good yeast fruit forward and a touch of bitter hops (not distinctly citrusy/piney/earthy/fruity). So far everything about this beer screams ""balanced and drinkable," and I certainly was not disappointed by the taste. Upfront maltiness transitions into a well-balanced bitter, yeasty, semi-dry finish. It has great carbonation and a light-medium body (heavier than a regular APA) followed by a lingering, citrusy bitterness that pulls everything together. I'm glad to see ST getting into new styles and think this beer is worth a try."

"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome! It has an incredible pale malt scent along with a killer citrus hop nose.; totally surpassed my expectations. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor with an excellent hop character. It has a mild bitterness, but finishes with a great hoppy freshness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good good APA; probably one of the best I've had in quite some time."
""
""
"Cloudy, glowing golden color with a mighty, frothy head that retains nicely. Classic pale ale aroma: lots of juicy, zesty citrus, floral and grassy hops, fresh cracker-like malts, and pine. Grapefruity, fresh hoppy flavor...oily, juicy, leafy, and spicy, with a little sweetness from the malt. Slick and fluffy feeling in the mouth, not highly carbonated. Excellent APA!"
"This poured out as a hazy orange color with thin white head on top. The retention settles into some clumps of bubbles on top. The lacing is minimal. The smell of the beer is malty there is a subtle hop aroma coming off of this one but not much at all. The aroma reminded me of a pilsner at first, slightly grassy and earthy. The taste of the beer has a grainy earthy malt, very typical of a Pale Ale. The bitterness is low. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a good carbonation to it. The mouthfeel is creamy then it dries out quickly. Overall it's a decent brew, not my favorite from Southern Tier but it was nice to try."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 3/7/2013. Pours hazy and cloudy pale golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge grapefruit, orange zest, orange pith, lemon zest, pineapple, tangerine, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, and floral earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus notes with big strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, and floral earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, light honey, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of citrus hop flavors; with a solid malt backbone and zero cloying flavors present on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent pale ale. Great balance and complexity of citrus hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"I love a good APA, but it's been a while since I've had a great new packaged one. Southern Tier just started bottling Live, so I hope it stands up. The appearance, at the very least, does. Live pours a hazy orange color with a large head. The aroma is briskly hoppy, providing sharp citrus over light caramel malts and grains. The taste is hoppy and clean, with the sharp citrus and a touch of pine cutting over grainy malts to a very clean finish. The mouthfeel is light and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is great. Overall, Live is a solid APA. It falls to the age-old problem with APAs though - where a six-pack costs almost as much as a twelver of Sierra Nevada, and it's not really better than SNPA."
"Overall I always try anything these guys put out and I could see picking up a case of this. A very drinkable hoppy pale ale."
""
""
""
"O: On the whole, this is a straightforward and easy to like beer. Drinkable."
""
""
"EDIT: Having this multiple times, including on tap, this beer is just stupid good for and APA, unbelievably refreshing, flavorful, and definitely sessionable."
"Overall a very nice beer that I will buy throughout the spring/summer season. Great Job Southern Tier !!! <3"
"Curious about this one. Pours a nice, thick head. Light colored in my shaker pint glass. smells terrific. Citrus hops. Tastes the same. Big favors, almost an IPA really. This is basically a delicious session able IPA. I'll enjoy many more of these this summer. Dig Southern Tier."
""
"Overall: great beer, good purchase"

"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours golden with a lasting white head and lots of visible carbonation. The aroma is of citrus and malt. It's a fairly clean smelling beer. The taste follows the nose mostly. I get the citrus, though it's mostly orange as well as some lemon. I also get the light breadiness from the malt. There's some back end biterness that is fairly mild. It's a bit like some bitter orange on the back end. The body is fairly light with strong carbonation. The beer drinks very smoothly due to all the carbonation. This is a good beer."

"This is a very nice, refreshing APA that has tremendous drinkability. This is a sessionable ale with enough hop character to keep you interested through several bottles. I would like to keep some of this on hand for my new ""any occasion"" beer."
"Spot on for the new breed of American Pale Ales!"
"O- Overall, this was just plain enjoyable. Nothing stood out that made it spectacular, but that's what I like about it. Adequate flavor without being overdone."
"Another nice beer from ST with great flavor and aromas which are fresh and distinct."
"Poured into a nonic a clear lighter dull golden with a fluffy,sticky one finger white crown atop,the bottle says to decant into a glass,I saw no need.Aromas of grassy/herbal hops over top of nutty malt,not real big but pleasant nose wise.Herbal notes along with a tinge of red onion on the palate,a little tea and mint is noticable,a firm lightly sweet nutty biscuit base holds up to the hops.This a nice APA not gigantic hops but a minty herbal approach that makes it really drinkable,the maltiness is big enough for non hopheads to like this beer as well.Nice job here."

"Pours a cloudy golden with a nice white head. Good retention, and very nice laceing. Aroma is of piney hops. Body is light and crisp. Taste is of grassy,piney hops. With hints of fruit, it's smooth from start to finish. This brewery continues to impress. A must try."

"This is a pretty smooth and easy drinking pale ale. A consistent hop influenced flavor profile. Definitely is a pale ale and doesn't wander into IPA territory. Carbonation is a bit full. Very easy to drink though. I am sure this would be super tasty on cask."
""
"I also had it on draft yesterday (11/27/2013) and it had a similar character, but a tad smoother."
"O- This is a nice brew. Very easy drinking and smooth. There just isn't a ton of flavor or feel to this beer, Although the flavor that is there is very pleasant."
""
"A really good pale ale, similar to many hoppy southern tier offerings which I always seem to enjoy. I think I found my easy drinking summer session beer."
""
""
"O- Terrible. I hope they just changed their formula for this because I don't believe my tastes have changed. I was extremely excited to see this at the store a few days ago and now, I'm extremely pissed. The bottle has a DOB of 2/25 too so it couldn't have gone off. I drank a whole 6er over the past few days before making this review to confirm that it was THIS bad, and unfortunately, it is. I sent out a few bombers to friends about a month or two ago and they said it was also very good, so again, I certainly hope this was just a badly-packaged 6er..."

"One of Southern Tier's best hoppy offerings, only behind 2XOne and 2XIPA, really."
""
"This is a mixed bag. On the debit side is the body and appearance, but the flavor and smell are appealing."
""
""
"Great new product and soon to hit 6-packs and cases. Great price. Awesome hop notes in the nose. Perfect aftertaste to the style. This is an awesome beer for hop-heads and those looking for that special APA! It dances the APA style line very closely and does not go into the IPA style zone. Not to mention names, but this is a serious contender to a certain undead Pale Ale from the beer gods in Munster. It has that beer's, and others like it's spirit! Buy this beer when you see it."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy bright orange with a fluffy eggshell white head. Aroma of huge citrus notes, ripe tropical fruits. This pale is dry hopped with 100% Citra and it shows. Taste takes the beer in a different direction. Tons of juicy lemon and grapefruit bitterness coats the mouth. A very slight sweetness appears at the back of the palate to balance things out a little. Very dry finish. Sort of a session IPA, which is awesome...this will be a new favorite of mine from ST. Can't wait to see this in 12 oz bottles in the next few weeks."

"O/D-This one grew on me. At $3.70 for a bomber, this is a steal. Far better than many of their offerings. I would take this over their regular IPA everyday for the rest of my existence. So much orange! A super-hoppy Pale Ale that is, to me, an India Pale Ale. Whatever it is, it tastes pretty delicious."
" a Duvel tulip. Nice copper color. Head is white and lite and leaves just a little lacing. Aroma is really nice, lots of Citra and cascade. Obviously lots of pine and citrus. Carbonation is right on, lots of it, which I like, seems to evenly distribute flavors. Mouth feel is dry, yeast did a great job, none of that unfermented sugary feel. Flavor is just what I was hoping for. Relatively light IPA in terms of gravity 5.5 abv. Great hop combination. If I could get this year round, it would be a top pick."
"Overall an interesting beer for sure. Nice hops that could come out a bit more, interesting malts that take a background flavor and leave the beer overall light and drinkable, but also could be a bit more maybe. And a unique yeast character that brings the beer to life alright, effervescent, nice carbonation, and a light almost earthy farmhouse flavor that's not quite there. A nice beer."
"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice flavorful pale ale to pound down for a long time."
