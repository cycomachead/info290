"If there is a better pale ale for the price, clue me in. Finally found some with a date I like (5/29/15) and bought one to sample. Into the Spiegelau. A finger of fluffy, white head on top of a deep tangerine body, hints of red in the light. Light piney aromas, hint of grapefruit, clean and subtle with a hint of lemon grass or saffron. Nearly perfect for a PA. Balance is the word on flavor. Light grapefruit rind, citrus bitterness on the front. Mid palate has a nice lightly toasted malt base. Super clean. Perfect finish like a cool glass of lemonade on a summer's day. This may be my summer lawnmower beer. Hands down beats the pants off SNPA."

"Had this on tap at the Bryant Lake Bowl and Tilia. A: Brilliant Amber, 1” snow white foam collar that clings to the side of the glass leaving sheets of lace. S: Citrus and grapefruit with some floral, fruit, melon.  T: A rich, creamy fruit filled palate sweetened with light caramel that dries out with a grapefruit rind bitterness on the finish. M: Medium body with medium levels of carbonation. The carbonation is very creamy and soft. O: A very drinkable American Pale Ale with character."

"Excellent pale ale with a great nose that's very drinkable. Too bad it's a rarity in the northeast."
"Good hoppy red, pretty heavy"

"Nitro in chilled pint glass at The Diller Room in Seattle.  Orange color with thick white head and heavy lacing due to nitro.   Mild smell with more malt than hops.   Well balanced with pronounced hop flavor.   I tend to prefer bigger beers,  but opted for this as it was available on nitro.   I like it."

"Really good! Smooth, enough hoppiness to notice, but not overpowering, and a little bit of citrus. Very nice...too bad it's only a seasonal, could definitely drink this one year round!"
"good smooth beer. Didn't think I would like it not usually my type of beer but this one was really good. Only got a sample before it sold out! Little disappointed would have liked to get more."
""
"Had on tap at Pizza Boy just outside of Harrisburg Pa.  What a perfect pale ale.  This one is so dialed in with hops and malt.  Sweet, no bitterness and full in body.  Absolute delight."
""
"Solid example of the style but not impressed. May revisit again someday."
""
"Malty at first, then a very nice hoppy taste this vibrant and not overly bitter.  Very surprised how well it tastes.  Hard to say this, but better than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  Excellent, excellent beer."
""
"Im digging this well done this would be a good starter into ipa not super hop charged just a very smooth beer"
"Very good example of a west coast IPA. Nicely balanced hops and malt. Moderate alcohol."
""
"Decent head and lace, caramel and fruity smells. Substantial grassy and earthy bittering hops. Dry finish"

"A must have Pale Ale!"

"This is one of the most perfectly balanced beers I know. A lucky customer can snag a 12-pack of this at the supermarket for as cheap as $12.99 (but usually a bit more), making it in Seattle *the* best beer that one can buy in terms of quality to price point. Significant head dissipates to a enduring lace around the edges. Strong and sweet slate of light malt, lightly toasted, is prominent. Fruity, but not citrusy or cannabisy, aromas--saffron?-- and taste of hops balance the flavor but don't dominate. One of my ATF beers, which I buy regularly, and this tasting hasn't changed that perception a bit. Easy drinking and a crowd pleaser."
""

"Tastes like Listerine. I probably wouldn't get it again"
"Very tasty NWPA. highly recommend it."
""
""
"Whoa momma... that's good stuff."

"to me, this is just a very average northwest IPA"
""
""
""
"Excellent. A fantastic IPA. Highly recommended"
""
"Lightly weathered copper orange in color and a deep hazw. Poured with an off white foam. Both soapy and tight, frothy bubbles and medium retention. Medium high hop aroma: tangerine, herbal mint, spicy. Medium sweet malt aroma beneath. Medium bodied with creamy, medium high carbonation. Light, pleasant, warming sensation beneath. Medium high hop flavors and bitterness: earthy herbal mint and orange zest. Medium low maltiness. Balance certainly tips toward the hop side but not too drastically. Finished dryly with a light minty, herbal hop aftertaste. A well constructed, well balanced, easy drinking pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Weird as it might sound, this was basically what I was expecting - A very pleasant, balanced and easy-drinking (india) pale ale. The hops has strong aromatic and flavor characteristics without inducing the amount of bitterness one might expect of an IPA. Just a smidge on the sweet side, but I still love it. Glad I picked up a sixer of this one."
"Overall they could do better.  This beer is drinkable but not exceptional."
"For a pale ale, this is very dynamic in flavor."
""
"2/12/15 - Finley Dunnes (Chicago)  Draft - Decent offering - liked the citrus smell and taste. Hops were light, the texture was very light. Nice beer to complement a meal, but less strong in taste and strength than I typically look for in an pale ale. Good beer."
""
"This is an awesome beer, very well balanced and drinkable"
"O-  This stuff is fantastic.  Had a 6er of it last year, and sought out a case this year."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall:  a go-to-beer every late winter/early spring.  Absolutely love it.  And love the label/name!"
""
""
""
"Gross, I trusted the rating but wow it was totally off, for me at least. Tasted like cleaner! Tried it on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Hands down one of the better pale ales iv had. It has all the fruity hops you want in an APA, but also has a wonderful bready backbone that carries the flavors through the finish. I like my pale ales to be a subdued version of a juicy IPA, and thats exactly what this is. In fact, this is basically the little brother of fresh squeeze. Deschutes has been gradually rising towards the top as one of my favorite breweries since they started distributing in my state about a year ago, and this is another reason why."
""
"An amber ale, white head and good clarity.  The aroma is grainy, with a slight fruit and hop undertone.   The taste is notably better.mmgreat balance...sweetness, malt, fruit, and a mild hop bitterness.  Solidly good, but not unlike many others of the style."
""
""
"Deschutes just keeps getting it right."
"Were God to appear to a human and ask him to show Him his greatest achievement, the man would be in remiss if he didn't give God a mug of 50 degree Red Chair NWPA. The balance in this brew is ridiculous. A sweet citrusy hoppy profile gives way to a smooth caramel/bready maltiness that then, just as quickly, lends itself back into a crisp piney finish that lingers while reminding you of the malty profile it just impressed upon you. This seriously may be the most well balanced beer I've ever tasted. I've had this beer for the past four years before finally reviewing it. It is simply unmatched in balance. Damned near a perfect beer in my humble beer loving opinion. Cheers!"
"Overall - just a great pale ale. Super glad I tried and would definitely make a good go to low-mid abv beer for light session drinking."
"And I don't know why Deschutes doesn't put this in their year round lineup."
""
"Somehow all the reviews I read on this have not hit the note, except one.  The taste is so unique, you will only know it when you drink it.  But, let me describe it for you the best I can, OK?   First, pear, apricot and cherry hits the note with the right amount of carbonation. Cherry note finish, but dry and soothing with creamy finish.  Spot on in my book, this is a A+ beer, got to get it every season.  Great job, Deschutes!!!!"

"O -  Very solid pale ale with a nice balance of flavors."
""
"Spectacular. Poured into pint glass. A: Amber I'm color with a two finger ivory colored head that slowly dissipates to half a finger thick for duration of drink. Heavy lacing that does not disappear. S: citrus, wheat, notes of raspberry, and bitter hops. Not bready at all. T: initially, bitter citrus hops, followed by strong wheat aftertaste. F: moderate carbonation, still smooth enough to drink steadily. O: deliciously brewed. I give a 4.5 to another superb beer from Deschutes Brewery. Definitely added to my top 5."

"malt then bitter, nice crisp and easy after taste"
"At some points too grassy and bitter, but leaves you feeling like you have drank to much rootbeer, overly sweet. Earthly after taste."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another great offering from Deschutes. Starts off very similar to hop trip IMO. As it warms the sweet malts kick in toning down the hops a bit. Very drinkable pale ale that has a nice hop presence balanced with a sweet juicy malt backbone."
""
""
"Overall - ""Big flavor, perfectly balanced", are the 4 words that best describe this for me. A beer with a delicious hop punch that doesn't shy away from letting a tasty malt backbone get some air-time too. Bitterness is low, and dries the palate just enough to make you yearn for the next sip. The body and feel are ethereal... Just so damn easy to knock these back. When I think of ""beer", this is the one I think about. This beer is in near-perfect harmony."
""
""
"One of the best pale ales around. Well Done!"
""

"This beer to me is perfectly balanced with hops present without being overpowering. Dangerously drinkable for 6.2%. Highly recommended."

"O: I'm glad a bought a six-pack of this -- this is a delicious, refreshing, and crowd-pleasing winter beer. It might be the best I've had from Deschutes."

"O: Maybe not my favorite, but another solid brew from Deschutes."
"O - Decent, but not a go to pale ale for me. I have some others from WI that I prefer."

"So looking forward to Red Chair again this winter. Very well balanced and the hoppiness is subdued enough that my non hophead friends say ""oh this is pretty good!"" One of my go-to favorites for the winter and spring while it's available and a great value to boot so I can buy it often!"

"O: Deschutes seems to strive for balance in their beers rather than going full-on HOOOOPS like other breweries, especially on the West Coast. I do love hops, but it's nice to have APAs like this one, which is very well balanced. The hops are there, but there is a really great malt presence too. The flowery and piney hops come on first, then the sweet bready malts take over. The flavors wash over and over. This is an excellent beer."

" Pours a pretty medium-amber in color with almost a 1-finger thick off-white head. A decent amount of lacing is seen that sticks to the sides of the glass, which is common for this type of brew. The aroma is of light sweet bread, with some floral hops. The taste has more going on with some citrus zest in the mix as well. Great taste but has a slightly bitter finish that stays around a bit. Does take about half the drink to get used to it. Overall great taste and even better with a less hoppy finish. I did drink the whole glass as wouldn't be the case if it was a I.P.A."

"Final Word: Another highly recommended beer from Deschutes Brewery! This beer is for those of you that tried Mirror Pond but thought it too malty, not challenging/potent enough, or simply that you prefer a stronger hop character over a maltier one. This beer is never too hoppy though, and isn’t for hop-heads, as it is still superbly balanced and rich."

"O - well made APA with little bittering hops, as such easy and smooth to drink. Nice. Could be fresh, could be less so, but than again I am not sure what Deschutes BB policy is."
""
""
""
""
"O: a nice western IPA with very little hoppy aftertaste. Another solid beer from Deschutes, I just wish they were easier to find here in northern IL. My local store doesn't carry many of them, preferring to order more from Wisconsin brewers instead."

""
"A superb pale ale, with wonderful drinkability and an ideal session ale!"
""
""
"The citrus punch of a big IPA, minus the one-dimensional hop sledgehammer. Seven select European and domestic malts round out the edges for a complex, copper-colored brew. Like its namesake ski lift, it's an insider's ride to fresh thrills."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a medium bodied beer that is easy to drink like a pale ale should be."
""
""
""
"D - This is an absolutely stellar American Pale Ale... Equal parts hops and malt... I don't have a single bad thing to say about this brew... This one ends up being much more than the sum of its glorious parts... If this were a year round offering, it would be in my fridge with regularity..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with moderate carbonation. A bounty of hop flavoring that finishes a touch dusty and vegetative but otherwise solid. A pale I could throw back in quantity quite effortlessly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I can’t find anything to criticize about this beer. I am amazed that this beer has a 60 IBU rating as the hops are so well balanced with the malt. Outstanding and bordering on world class!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I bought one, I think I'm going to buy a six pack its enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My favorite pale ale and a great, balanced example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and even though the ABV is a little higher than I would normally recommend, this feels like a sessionable brew in my opinion. Nice flavors that have some aspects of an amber but more of a pale ale. Very enjoyable."

"Hands Down the best Pale Ale of all I have tasted. This starts out with a wonderful aroma. The Copper color is darker than most PA's I have experienced. May not be a fair comparison since the named it NWPA, it certainly favors the taste of those living from Oregon North!Starts great and finishes even better. It was by a complete fluke I even bought it, a person at working stocking the beer at Safeway in Ballard suggested it. I was smart enough to listen."
""
""
""
"Overall - I regularly drink IPAs, but have decided to branch out. Red Chair has a good amount of depth and I would recommend it to anyone, even my IPA brothers. This is a well-rounded, quality tasting beer, made with love, and given a cool, fitting name."
""
"o: Wow, what a great beer! Perfectly drinkable with incredibly complimentary balance between the malt and hop profiles."

" The taste is excellent very fruity with subtle mix of orange notes in the hops with ruby red grapefruit and mild caramel flavors from the malt all blending in a way that nothing is out of balance yet the sum of the parts is really interesting. The taste of the yeast adds a slight hint of tangy sweet apple skin with a mild toasted malt element and light herbal flavor in the finish 4.25 Overall I really enjoyed this about equally in the bottle as the draft version the only exception is the hops seemed more aromatic in the draft, but the overall enjoyment is the same -4"

"O - At first, it reminded me of a lighter bodied, more citrus oriented Sierra Nevada Northern Hemisphere, which is high praise for me. As I continued to taste, this pale ale leans more toward an amber like a Troegs Nugget Nectar; again, pretty high praise. Bottom line is that for 6.2% ABV, this beer packs a lot of flavor and feel and I'm glad it made it to south-central PA starting this week."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark amber color, bordering on rust almost, with a decent cap of foam which was just sticky enough to leave some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma signals that this is indeed a hoppy ale from the northwest. The citrus, orange mostly, and floral character are sewn together beautifully. A very subtle malt note lingers in the background. This theme continues on the palate. Orange, grapefruit, and floral hoppiness scrub the palate and leave a faint oily residue of hops. Malt sweetness isn't a major player here, but there is enough to prevent this from being a one trick pony. Nicely done."
"Poured dark amber color. Slightly hazy. Very thick foamy head with large amount of lacing along the glass. Strong citrus smell. Can also pick out pine, maybe grapefruit. Hop forward tastes that mellows to a more malty smooth presence. Still retains the bitter aftertaste I love about pale ales and IPAs. Strong citrus and pine taste with a hint of grapefruit. For some reason, I keep on thinking cherries as well after taking a drink. Excellent, smooth beer that you can enjoy in multiples on a nice spring day."
"O: I'm a little disappointed that I couldn't find this a little fresher because I'm certain that I'm missing out on some important fresh hop flavor that would have surely kicked up my taste score a notch. With that being said, every bit of me enjoyed this brew regardless. It's super easy drinking with a ton of great flavor. Deschutes scores again."

""
""
""

"It has a 6.2 ABV and I did catch a slight buzz after downing the first two after completing a 6 mile mountain hike. It's worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: A little watery, but carbonation is well balanced. A tiny bit of malty thickness at the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- delicious and great drinkability. I drank this too fast! Got this in a create your own 6 pack to try it out. Definitely getting a 6 of it next time."
"The Verdict: Delicious. Complex, well balanced, and tasty, and the mouthfeel is nearly perfect. More, please."
""
""
"Overall - This is a killer beer. Light, smooth, flavorful and soooo easy to drink. Perfect balance of sweet and bitter. You can get your hop fix with this, and not get palate wrecked at all. World class, and unique, nothing else ive had quite tastes like this one."

"This is subtler than those big aggressive amber ales- it's got a decent malt body and has more subtle citric hops (although don't get me wrong, it's quite hoppy). But it's big bodied. I'd place it close to Arrogant Bastard and the American Strong Ale genre."

"Enjoyable semi strong pale ale. Very nice color. Perhaps a little deficient on the carbonation. Taste reminiscent of English Bass Ale. In all regards a pleasingly bitter and well constructed ale, at a reasonable price. Lovely to come ""home"" to at the end of a hard days skiing in Tahoe."

"Pours a dark amber orange hue with a creamy three finger head right up to the brim and lacing everywhere quite a nice looker,the smell is light citrus,a touch of subtle pine and light malts,the mouthfeel is light yet creamy and moderately carbonated with tastes of nice citrus,tangerine,pale malts and finished a subtle floral bitterness and overall it's nice and sessionable and something u want when you don't want a smack load of hops and I'd Love to have a pint of this off tap cheers."

"This ale pours a beautiful reddish copper color with a very slight white head and nice lacing. The aroma is quite complex with lots of malt and hops. The flavor is just as rich and complex. Very impressive for a seemingly simple apa. I wish I'd have bought more than just a single of this one."

"Poured a cloudy amber orange without any head to speak of and some slight bubbles coming up. Not the best looking pale ale I've seen, but its pretty nice. Scent begins with a big hit of orange zest from Centennial hops, mingling with some pine resin and slight grapefruit along with a nice, pleasant malty sweetness and some nice grassy aromas. Quite appetizing, very well done. Taste begins with orange sweetness, a bit of pine resin and some nice caramel malt. Pine resin comes out more in the middle, overpowering the orange and caramel sweetness. The finish returns to the caramel and orange but also adds a good hit of bitter citrus pith and pine resin. The aftertaste is bitter with hints of toasted malt. A good, robust, but not overpowering flavor profile. Complex but accessible, very well done. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of prickly carbonation upfront and a smooth feel in the middle and finish. Very easy to drink as a result, expertly done. Overall this is an excellent pale ale. It highlights citrus and pine forward hops, without the high bitterness of an IPA, balances them with some nice sweet malt and combines that flavor with an excellent aroma and mouthfeel. Another winner from Deschutes."

"The feel is the best aspect in this beer. It's rich with a creamy thickness that doesn't exceed its medium body, and it's completely crisp to boot. Silky creaminess gives way to sweetness that cuts through a dry edge it begins to take, adding depth to the overall feel. The key to keeping it together is really that it stays so crisp all the while."

"Enjoyed 16 oz. on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary, another product of me watching their beer board like a hawk for stuff you cannot yet find in stores here. Keep 'em coming guys. A light bronze colored brew, just a notch above dark gold, with around an inch of beige head. Aroma a pleasing blend of rich crystal malts, bubblegum and red berry fruit esters, and fresh citrus zest, quite balanced although the citrus is probably the main component that jumps out. On the palate I again get considerable citrus: Grapefruit, mandarin, lemon, and lime zest/juices along with orchard fruit (peach?), white grape, baby aspirin, and a mellow brown sugar malty backbone. Some booze winks through from time to time and the hops morph a bit from citrus to celery stalk. Body and mouthfeel are right on point for the style, more chew than a lager but about the same degree of carbonation. I might ratchet this latter element down a notch or two. Has much of the Cascade hop character of its stablemate and fellow pale ale Mirror Pond but with more west coast citrus flavors layered on and a higher ABV. A nice enough jaunt. The mellow sweet malts let the hops shine through. It would be great to crush a six-pack or two with a few buddies."
"I don't recall having a beer that smells so much of fresh hops. The bitterness is just a touch more than I prefer, but a great brew. The more of it I drink, the more hollow it tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The nose is citrusy and sweet and very much what I get on the taste buds too. It's almost sweet and creamy and like biting into a juicy orange, but the backend is resinous and bitter and lingers with a bit of dryness. Very well-balanced and really easy to drink. I enjoyed and could go through many a six pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Body feels a little watery and undercarbonated."

"Overall, a very good APA that displays good hop character of its home region. You can really taste the floral and piney flavors of the hops change as the drink progresses."

"O: I really feel like Deschutes has done an excellent job presenting well integrated malt and hop flavors in this beer. Perfectly balanced, quite flavorful, and immediately approachable this, in my book, is exactly what an APA should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deschutes does a nice job of representing the region in ale form. But if its didn't boast its origins, I would have suspected any brewery in American could have made such a beer that's caught somewhere between American-style Amber Ale and Pale Ale"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Red Chair is delicious. I haven't had many from Deschutes, but I'm getting the feel for their texture as I feel its the most important part of any great ale. Red Chair has loads of class to it and is a perfect January IPA. I'd drink this one any day! A must try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Amazingly refreshing and enjoyable - this could also become a great session beer. I will be picking up more of this very soon. Another winner from what is fast becoming one of my most favorite breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice pale ale right here. The craftsmanship really sells this beer for me."
""
""
""
""
"The aftertaste is more like an IPA. All around, this is a major winner."
""
"This is an old-school, well-crafted pale ale. Terrific balance, lots of flavor, and it doesn't ruin your palate. A good introductory beer to craft newbies."
"Overall: Well balanced, easy to drink, tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a lot of pale ales fight between hoppy and malts and this one is clearly leaning toward malt. A unique sweetness with some bitterness for a PA and worth a taster or glass. Not sure if I would ever buy more than that for this one."
""
""
""
""
"A moderate pour yields an inch of frothy, eggshell-white head that lingers for a few minutes before resolving almost completely. Scant patches of bubbles linger to decorate the surface as wispy trails lace the glass. The aroma is of varied, citrusy hops and a malty, caramel background. Some orange up front with balanced toffee in the rear; not aggressive, not underwhelming, but balanced and reasonably complex. Flavor follows suit, with a nice malt component playing second fiddle to fresh, citrusy hops. Some orange, pine, and lemon zest meld with caramel, toffee, and subtle notes of brown sugar in a very drinkable manner. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and refreshing with a slightly resinous finish. The carbonation level is appropriate for this style and does well to liven the beer. Overall... while there may be pales out there that fit a specific flavor profile or showcase a different ingredient better, the Red Chair offers a surprisingly refreshing degree of balance and quality in a beer that does not decimate a single population of taste buds. The substantial malt background makes it an excellent choice for the colder months, and the superb drinkability/affordability is why I return to it (by the case) every year."
"Clear golden amber with a light tan head that dissipates very quickly but leaves a lot of nice lacing. Hoppy with a few piney notes. Very smooth and full flavor, the hops is not overpowering, some citrus; a little bitter after taste, but not unpleasant. The mouth feel is clean with some dryness that comes on after you swallow. Overall: One of the smoothest IPAs I have had. If you are looking for an IPA that won't knock you out with the hops and still has outstanding flavor, this is the one."
""
""
"sorry for clipped writing/done on phone!"
""
"Gorgeous amber color with red tint. A quarter inch of moderately sized off white foam bubbles. Good clarity. I get a gentle amount of piney hops and doughy pale malt in the nose. The front of the palate is doughy light malt and then a nudge of piney hops takes gently over at the fade and then back to the bready maltiness in the aftertaste. The mouth gives a bit of prickliness from the hops and feels well balanced and is very prolific for a beer with so much subtlety."
"O- I love this pale ale. Juicy and smooth."
""
"Overall: This is a great example of a beer straddling the fence between an American Pale Ale and an American IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Got is as an extra in a trade and this is my first Deschutes beer. Very impressed and has some flavors in it that I haven't had in a Pale Ale. I hear Deschutes is coming to Michigan this year and I am very excited to try their other offerings."
""
""
""
"Overall: A great sessionable pale ale that I would gladly enjoy again."
""
""
""
""
"A nice drinking and approachable brew."
""
""
"Not as perfect as Hop Trip from their Bond Series but worthy of the ratings bestowed by the Bros and the BA community."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty beer here, this is perhaps one of the most pleasing pale ales I've had. It's not the most bitter, and yet it has a very appetizing hop characteristic which leaves you wanting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Nice head that never really dissipates, thick persistent lacing. Nose is piney with a fine balance nutty, sweet, and citrus components. Very hoppy and biting, some bitter nutty components, and bittersweet citrus. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
"O - this is the best Pale Ale I've had. Just hoppy enough to match my taste buds, but smooth."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nice ""alternate"" pale ale that would be a great introduction for some to craft beers. Very drinkable...I wouldn't describe this as flabby; it has a nice balance and does what it says."
"Pours a copper color with a three finger off white head. Good amount of carbonation coming off the glass. Smells of Northwest Pacific hops like the title suggests. Citrus notes like grapefruit, tangerine, and mango. Also a good amount of pine. A hefty dose of carmel malts and breadiness sweeten the aroma and stay true to what the beer description suggests: a well balanced american pale ale. Taste starts with some nice hoppy flavors. Get grapefruit and orange, almost like a marmalade. The middle brings a big malt profile to go with the hops. Get some grains, breadiness, and carmel sweetness. Maybe get a belgian-like malt in there too. This balances the beer in a really nice way. The finish brings a lot of pine that gives the beer a resinous quality, as well as more grapefruit, marmalade, floral esters, carmel, spiciness, and breadiness. Light medium body with a pretty creamy, smooth, and slightly watery mouthfeel. This is a solid pale ale that lives up to what it says it will be. In the world of american pale ales nowadays, it is nothing to ride home about; however, it’s great balance stands it out from a lot of the hoppy, one-sided american pale ales that are being produced today."
""
""
""
""
"Wonderfully easy beer to drink with complimentary, sweet flavors. The bouquet could be bigger, but the palate certainly delivers."

"Overall I found this to be a smooth, enjoyable drinking brew; one that I could enjoy without worrying about any noticeable defects. On the other hand, the lack of a big hop presence or intense flavors leaves it behind some of my favorite pale ales."
""
""
"A very good North Western Pale Ale that I would gladly drink on a red chair, on the ski slopes in Oregon, or in a swamp located in the Florida Everglades. It doesn't matter. A session beer a the way!"
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, creamy and smooth on the tongue. Drinkable but pretty mild overall and frankly quite forgettable. This bottle was before the 'drink by' date but I'd like to give it another go with one that's less than a month old."
""
""
"Copper color, Very malty for being labeled a Pale Ale. Almost sweet, but just enough of a hop balance to pull it back from the edge. The body almost crosses thew line into red/amber ale territory. The aroma strikes a nice balance of maltiness and the floral/citrus notes of the hops. A very nice beer!"

"Very malt forward Pale Ale. Even with the use of American hops this tastes like an English Pale Ale. Meh...why does this have such good ratings?"

""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my go-to beers when it's in season. This is the perfect beer for someone relatively new to craft beer and still uneasy with hop forward IPAs. This beer is somewhat of a hybrid between an easy drinking american pale ale (think Sierra Nevada Pale Ale) and a more complex IPA. It has a nice malty backbone and a decent amount of sweetness allow for easy drinking while the burst of aromatic hops (pine, grapefruit) give it a great deal of depth. It has a decent head and is a nice cloudy burnt orange. Not a ton of a carbonation and a long-lasting almost sticky aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"A good well made beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"So drinkable, I think we got some old crap last summer when this was introduced tp Missouri last Summer. This will be in the hot weather rotation if I can get this fresh"
""
""
""
""
"O - definitely an impressive and unassuming brew, they nailed it in terms of a brew that's just hoppy enough to bring out some flavour but not so much that it will scare off the masses, well played"
"Good brew. It looks good and laces enough to let you know it's there. The smell doesn't jump out as much as some, but the taste and feel of this fine little APA are great. This will be how I get newcomers onto the IPA bandwagon. Very balanced while allowing for the separate flavors to be tasted. Both malts and hops have a role to play and they do it well. I would drink again."
""
"The Dechutes Red Chair was more of a Red/Amber Ale than a APA. The beer poured a clear amber color with thin white head that did not leave much lace. The scent was malty and on the sweeter side. There was not much presence of hops. The taste to me was a amberish type beer....not much bitterness, but a good sweet malt base with hints of caramel. The mouthfee was medium in body with decent carbonation. Overall its a fine amber ale....if I'm judging this as a APA, then it was dissappointing. I was expecting a hopped up red..."

"I don’t know why I was surprised by this being Deschutes and all. Great Pale Ale with an inviting sweet aroma and taste to it."

""
""
""
""
"O- easy to drink as a pale ale should be, but plenty of flavor to go around. I really like the fruity esters and subtly malty sweetness."
"Unique pale ale. Quite sweet and fruity and delicious. Really happy for the balance on the finish though. Overall quite a tasty choice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"An awesome beer. Perfect for those cool, damp winter days in the PacNW... or those cool damp spring days here in Minnesota."
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with fairly low carbonation levels for its weight. The result is a beer that's slightly more heavy-feeling than it should be, also slightly stagnant on the palate, though it still flows well enough due to the bitterness level. Closes semi-dry, with fairly substantial stickiness lingering across the palate."
"Overall:  Really enjoy this one.  This is one I make an effort to pick up when it's available.  Good balance of malt and hops, very easy to drink.  I would highly recommend giving it a try."
""
""
""
"This reminds me so vividly of the spices and aromas that go with Autumn, yet it seems to work so well right now during a chilly night on the first day of Spring. In a way, I don't see how this wouldn't work for any season, really. It's nicely refreshing and flavorful with lots of aspects that are present in variations of pale ales, yet come together nicely in a balanced manner. Fans of Deschutes, don't pass this by. Personally, I'd take this over a Mirror Pond or even most Winter Warmers available on the market any day!"
""
"O: A good pale ale, didn't notice this was 6.2% at all. Probably would pair well with steaks or burgers on the grille."
""
""
""
"O- This is a world class pale ale bursting with tropical hop flavor nicely balanced with a very flavorful malt profile."
""
"O - This beer surprised me as I thought it was going to be more hop forward, but it ended up being a sweeter pale ale for me. I wasn't the biggest fan as I like my pale ales to be more hoppy but it was a good value at $10 a six pack. I'll probably revisit this next year."
""
"O: in my eyes this is a red ale and for a red ale its exceptional. It has the strong hop profile to complement the lingering caramel malt. Its between this and lakefront fixed gear for my fav reds. Thx"
""
""
""
"(O)- Definitely a good beer. It might just be be, but this almost seems more like an American Amber than a pale, but either way, this is a solid beer."
""
""
""
"This one is a really tasty brew that I could definitely session. Kudos to Deschutes, a new brewery in the Chicago area and one I have heard great things about."
"O - malty PA with a citrus flavor and a weak, but nice aroma. More hops, please."
"terrific stuff"
"Serving type: 12oz bottle"
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy red with minimal white head. Heavy lacing hangs around on the glass. A big caramel malt profile is immediately present in the aroma with firm bitter notes, pine and graham cracker. The taste starts out with some sweet maltiness that is quickly joined by earthy and herbal hop notes. The bitterness is light and the finish is a bit sweet. Mouthfeel is medium with high carbonation. Overall, a decent little pale ale that could benefit from a little more hop bitterness."
""
"O: I love the hops flavor but I feel there is too much malt in the backbone. I only got an individual bottle. Maybe it is just the particular batch I got because this beer rates very well here. Maybe it is just not to my palate. I assume that is the case. Deschutes makes awesome beers."
""
""
"Overall a simply perfect pale ale that I'm of so grateful to have tried. If I lived in the area, I'd drink this as fresh from the tap as possible. I cannot remember a pale ale with so much attractive pronounced goodness, but still keeping a blue-collar stature and humbleness. Simply love this beer."
""
"O Balance! It's all there, malts, hops, sweetness, bitterness. None of those overpowers the other. Great job by Deschutes. It's a good thing this a seasonal because otherwise, this 6.2 ABV beer might be my session beer."
""
""
""
""
"o - overall great pale ale. with a best by date a month away, i'm sure i'm a few months post bottling on this one, but i love it. would love to try uber fresh, but right now hits the spot. great malt heavy pale ale with a nice hopping to tame the malts. great deschutes flavor profile. tastes like a stream in nature."
"A top pale ale."
""
""
"O-Refreshing, smooth, and complex. A fantastic quaff."
""
"O – Something off-putting with this beer. Malt profile is odd and dominates whatever hops are there."
""
""
""
""
""
"For being on bottle date life support, there's still a hell of lot to like about this. Flavors are soft but everything melds nicely, a drinkable and flavorful Pale."
""
""
"Taste- zesty up front, some citrus hop bite. Delicious fruity bouquet, apricot, apple, orange. Sweet malty breadiness, finishes nicely malty with some herbal (green tea) and fruity hopiness. A fantastic pale ale, shows some great malt layers yet still very APA in its lush hop profile. Very drinkable, the beer I wanna drink all spring/ summer"
""
""
"O=Reminded me of Magic Hat #9, with a tastier hop backbone. I may try a tap with the right meal,e.g. barbecued chicken."
""
"O: Nice overall beer. Really easy to drink, very sessionable, would be perfect for a nice summer day, but I'm still enjoying it in bitter cold of February."
"O - very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good. Exceptional, even. Personally, I find it runs a bit malt heavy, but I expect this from Deschutes. I'd be very interested in trying this fresh."
""
"Overall: Highly enjoyable even considering the sweetness. I would be happy if more APAs were similar to this level of hopping."
"This is a beer that is worth keeping in stock and serving to friends."
""
""

"Deschutes Red Chair NWPA ---3/5."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is less bitter-refreshment forceful than your typical west coaster like SNPA. The malt body is robust and comforting, but does not tower over the flavorful hops and esters. I recommend this beer to anyone, especially if you appreciate northwest pales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Toasted malt up front. Spicy, herbal hop bitterness follows and builds. Fruity, jammy, sweetish, caramelly malt fills in. Butterscotch notes as well. Apricot and orange hop flavors gradually become more bitter and grapefruity. Pine, spice, and lingering caramelly malt in the drying finish. Medium body with a nice, creamy mouthfeel. Very nicely done!"
""
"Overall: Not bad at all, a well-put together APA that straddles the line with the IPA. It's got the balance I like in my pale ales but shows its Pacific Northwest roots by giving my palate a punch on the arm, so to speak. While its nice that they are distributing to Chicago (easy to drive down to get it for me being in Wisconsin), I think I would rather have Alpha King if I want a nice hoppy pale ale- it does what this beer does but quite a bit better, and I can still get it in Wisconsin. Otherwise, for the style, it's a nicely done effort by Deschutes. (4)"
""
"Mouthfeel is a good carbonation, not sticky, not heavy. Overall, it's probably my second favorite pale ale, and it's nearly my favorite. Don't miss it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is definitely a very strong malt presence for an APA. There is a slightly bitter, bready taste, but I think this beer could be more well balanced. Overall, I'm slightly disappointed because there was a decent amount of hype when Deschutes started distributing to Illinois, but I think Black Butte it their only beer that has lived up to the hype. Red Chair is a decent APA has some unique characteristics, but I would not choose it over other APAs at a similar price point such as Dale's Pale Ale."

""
"I find red chairs in my living room to be a bit gaudy... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper topped by over a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises pine needles, grapefruit zest, orange peel, a touch of tangerine, and a hint of honey. The taste brings in more of the same, slightly rindier than before, but still pretty bright and enjoyable. A bit of grass is tossed in for good measure. Thee body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice pale ale, one of the best Deschutes offering I've yet had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a semi-cloudy amber orange color with a slight head. The aroma is mostly hops mixed with a little citrus. The taste is smooth, malty, and complex. Initially there is this bready, toast, malt taste that then turns into a dry crisp after taste. Full of flavor and very well made!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really like this beer, but I think I remember this more fondly than it really is. Maybe it's because I've had more pints of this than most of the non-seasonals from Deschutes so I'm numbed to it's greatness. Maybe they changed the recipe over the last couple years. I don't know. This beer still is very solid. It's no longer my favorite, but its toward the top of the list though. A word of warning, the bottle serving is a tad too bitter and woody for my taste. Though still good, the bottle just doesn't seem to finish quite as clean, diminishing the best quality of this beer. During spring, this is my go to beef unless there's something new on another tap."

"O- This beer has a full hop profile with nice depth and it has a pale hop quality so it is very sessionable with out make my tongue go hop numb. This must be a classic NW hops brew."
"Overall - Exactly what I want in a Pale Ale. That classic hoppy honey taste that goes down smooth and smells like a drink of champions. I highly recommend this brew"
""
""
""

"O- this is a great pale ale, nothing overwhelming or unbalanced, very clean and easy to drink, alcohol is barely noticable, highly reccommend"
""
""
"This is quite possibly the most balanced pale ale ever, no wonder it has such top level awards. The taste and hops are very similar to Mirror Pond, but there is the Grapefruity, orange, and even mango-ish explosion added to it, with a more amazing balance between the big hops, and toasty malt. It is a ""perfectly complex"" beer, a pinnacle of fine brewing ingredients and skill. A must have!"

"O: I love their Mirror Pond and this is just as good, if not better."
""
"12oz bottle pours amber with excellent clarity and is topped with a rocky, off-white head that holds good retention & leaves lots of sticky, chunky lace. Floral hop nose with citric grapefruit, caramel, toasted malt. Tastes are piny hops up-front, grapefruit rind, caramel malt, bready malt, nice toasted grain finish while the piny hop lingers yet finishes clean. The hops come across more juicy and slightly tropical rather than piny as the palate warms up to the moderate bitterness. Mouth-feel is smooth with pleasant carbonation allowing the vast complexity to meld. Overall, amazing balance with a nice complex array of flavors. One of the best APA's out there!"

"Overall, with just a bit more hops this beer would be quite balanced. Otherwise, very solid."

"Best by 3/29/13. Poured a slightly-hazy orange with a short white head. The aroma seems like it should stand up more— I just gets a creamy, mild floral and tangerine hop character. The flavor, however, has big, biting grapefruit over a subtle caramel malt backbone. There's also a nice juicy hop undertone that sets this apart from your average all-citrus pale ale. I'm a fan, it's a touch thick for the style, but damn tasty and a good break from the often-boring APA. Have a couple pints, you won't regret it."
""
"Piney and citrus hop flavors mixed with syrupy biscuits upfront. Well toasted malt and hop bittereness that lingers, but does not overpower. The baance is a little more hops than malt overall, but that being said, I'd this is a very well balanced APA. The malts and hops each have there influence on your tasted buds and palate. Pretty easy to drink this 6.4% abv. beer."

"O: This is a very good secessionable beer that would be good on a hot day. Why it is an early winter release, I don't know but I will still drink it while I can."
"Good representation of the style. Certainly the best American Pale Ale i've had in awhile. The color is a nice amber with a good solid hop smell. Yep, the mouthfeel is just about right, maybe a little more carbonation. Oooo baby, this one tastes perfect. Totally pale ale. Slight hops greet me with a full flavored ale which i WISH wasn't only a seasonal. This one needs to be a full-time offering for sure. Overall, great beer indeed."

"First nitro beer! Pours a light amber with a one finger head. Citrus, pine, and caramel on the nose, same goes for the taste. It's got a nice bitter aftertaste as well. Mouthfeel is epic. It's milky creamy goodness, lightly carbonated & highly drinkable! Great brew, fantastic on Nitro!"

"Theres a reason this beer won beer of the world 2 years now. 2010 and 2012. Red chair has a very nice malty-hoppy flavor with a crisp taste and a nice mellow finish. one of my favorite deschuttes beers. Cheers to becoming beer of the world. worth every bit of respect from me. this brewery knows what theyre doing."

"Overall: This is a really great APA. Love the orange notes the hops impart on this beer. The mouthfeel feel is perfect for this beer."
""
"Poured this APA from a bottle into a pint glass. It poured a clear reddish amber color, produced a thick, white foamy head, excellent retention and it left outstanding lacing on the glass. The aroma of this APA consists of orange peel, grapefruit and floral hops. The foundation of this ale contained toasted malted grain, spicy white pepper, sweet caramel and citric orange peel. This is an outstanding APA, well balanced, excellent ""hop factor"". If your looking for a unique APA that is ""hoppy"" try this excellent brew."

"This is a nice robust pale ale with good hearty tones. Lots of hop action, in a pale ale fashion, but not obliterating the palate. This is a nice drinker. I bet it'd be nice on cask. And, I bet if I had a very fresh sample, I would enjoy it even more."

"Overall: I true pleasure to drink this one. I mean I could sit back and put away quite a few of these. Not overly hoppy and not overly sweet or fruity either. Just an absolute perfect balance to be able to enjoy any time. I know this one was past it's prime according to the best by date but it's excellent IMO even three months past said date."

"O- This is one of my favorites from Deschutes, I really like the hoppy character with the good balance of malt, smell and look are also nice"
"Serious yum going on, here. Plenty of tastiness, good censurability. They've got a hit on their hands."
"This is nicely balanced and actually pretty unique. I personally did not enjoy it as much as Mirror Pond, but that is tough competition. If I could get this more often, I would."

"Poured into a pint glass, this beer is a beautiful semi dark amber color, slightly hazy and has some mild carbonation. It’s topped off with an off white head, very bubbly and sticks around for a while and is accompanied by some decent lacing. The hops are very present and you can pick up some mild roasted malts too hops. Grapefruit zest and fresh grain aromas come through as well and you can pick up a mild hint of figs. Its sweet when it first hits your tongue, slightly bitter on the side of your mouth and in its aftertaste; some citrus fruits do come through and its bitter overall. It does a medium to heavy mouth feel."
"Yum!"

"Overall: Fantastic APA! Probably my favorite that's available to me. I wish this was year round, as it's just a fantastic beer, that has tons and tons of flavor, but that's super refreshing and easy to drink at the same time."
"Overall - This reminded me a bit of a beer that is available to me locally called Smashbomb. The taste is delicious and I would definitely drink it again any time. One of the better beers I've had from Deschutes."
""

""
""
"O: Brilliant APA ... on my third six pack this year so far. Please make this year round Deschutes."
"Good creamy smooth mouthfeel. Little bitter bite nice mellow malt flavor. Nothing to complain about here. Well rounded delicious brew. Comes off as your standard pale ale with a fruity hop kick, but not bitter enough to be an IPA."
""
""
"O: Very drinkable and tasty. Citra hopped pale ales are really revitalizing the style."
""
"Overall this is a very good beer, very complex and rewarding. And even more rewarding considering that I got the six pack for just over $7! One of my best purchases without a doubt, and if you're ever in the position to try this beer, do yourself a favor and go for it!"

"Deschutes Red Chair NWPA (North West Pale Ale) pours a beautiful orange-amber, with three fingers of cream colored head, and a decent amount of lace. A citrusy and floral, hop heavy (grapefruit, mango, orange, pine) nose fades into some sweet malt hints (caramel and bread). Juicy flavors of grapefruit and mango mix with hints of piney resin and some floral tones before becoming exceptionally well balanced with complex malt flavors including breadiness, toastiness, and caramel. Medium-light in body, Red Chair ale features a moderate amount of carbonation, and an exceptionally balanced and smooth flavor profile. Amazing!"
""
""
"Poured a dark gold with a copper hue. An aggressive pour yields a white one-finger head. Hop-heavy for the style both in flavor and on the nose, with piney notes standing out. Citrus and fruit flavors add complexity. Lighter feel than one might expect to given its taste and appearance. Just an excellent pale ale. One of the best I've had."
"Overall - Deschutes does not disappoint, once again. I will likely have to put them in the same category as Founders, in that I have never had a ""bad"" beer from them to speak of. This is a very impressive APA. I would highly recommend this beer to the novice and the experienced beer drinker alike. Absolutely drink this one."
""
""
"Overall this is super well balanced. Nice and hoppy but with a decent and enjoyable malt backbone. Very smooth on the uptake and a slightly fruity/tropical but dry finish. Very enjoyable. Would drink again and would like to try on tap!"

"Finishing the last sip or two of a six pack I bought a few days ago. I absolutely love this beer. It's the only pale ale I care for. It's utterly delicious, with fruity, juicy textures and beautiful white head. The lacing is minimal, but nice. Smells great, very fruity, but not sweet. Light and enjoyably carbonated, but not low ABV like a lame ""session ale"". I'm grateful to have access to such an exquisite beverage, thank you Deschutes #We'reNotWorthy"

"Overall: A great pale ale. One of the better ones around. Great juicy taste."
"So good. This is one of my favorite easy-drinking beers for sure."

"The beer is pretty simple and clean though, but better a balanced, well-executed beer than a complex one with shortcomings. Overall, well worth a try, and definitely a beer that I'll drink again."
"Low B"
"o: excellent pale ale. everyone should seek this out."
"Grades out really high because there's no doubt that it's very good. Oddly though, I'm not that drawn to it. Not warranting a ""I'd really like another," response."
"Lovely amber with a couple fingers of tannish foam leaving webbed lace. Smells of pine, sweet grapefruit and more pine. A sincerely PNW aroma here. Flavor has a good bite up front with cameos from the hops in the substance of weed and, imagine, pine. The malts are nice and solid sans sweetness. Medium bodied with moderately hi carb and a semi dry finish. A really nice beer and particularly a fun treat to look forward to annually - we'd be spoiled to have this beer all the time."
"This brew pours a beautiful copper color leaving about a fingers worth of an off white head and nice lacing. The aroma has a very strong citrus hop character(think grapefruit) imparted from the generous amounts of Cascade and Centennial hops used in this brew. When it comes to the taste of this beer, it packs a nice strong citrus like hop presence and has a medium mouth feel from a nice strong malt backbone."

"O: Its a pretty one dimensional pale ale in my opinion. Enjoyable yes, but far from mind blowing. I do prefer my pale ales though to have a more bread, toast character."
"Last night I had it and I loved it, however, today I don't like it as much."
"This is a very nice pale ale, one of the best I've had, right up there with Drake's 1500. Light, easy drinking and completely rewarding."
""
""
"This is among the smoothest, most well-balanced pale ales I've tasted. In your mouth, it re-effervesces lightly, tingling on the tongue and roof but not acidic. Flavorful, it's not heavy. I've had this beer plenty this winter after skiing and with different meals. I recommend it again and again, except after cough drops."
""
"Conclusion: If you want a hoppy flavor-fix but don't want to be blown away by bitterness, this is the beer to turn to. It is almost dreamy. Excellent American pale ale."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's very fine and I plan to drink it again and again! I like a good hop forward pale ale and this one fits the bill."
"O: The nose gave me a lot of hope, but the mouthfeel and taste really didn't do it for me. Just a touch too malty and thick for me. I guess I'm spoiled with the likes of Zombie Dust."

"Pours a fine amber with generous amount of white head. Citrus is immediately obvious in the nose, but more of a bready malt than I was expecting. Taste follows with very up front hop character, citrus, mostly grapefruit and pineapple, but nice malt profile. reminds me of an American version of an ran. Very fine. Smooth mouthful. Overall my favorite beer of the winter. Solid all around, no weakness."
"O: Nice American Pale that turns the dial a little closer to the malts. I accidentally left this beer out for well over an hour and it really warmed up... and it's delicious! I'd recommend anyone who buys a six pack to let one settle to a warmer temperature... it's still comforting and really quaffable!"
"overall: Good, but not a repurchase"

"O - Red Chair is just an all-around good pale ale!"

""

"12 oz bottle pours a medium amber with good head and lacing. Aroma is citrus hops and sweet candy corn malt. Taste is moderate citrus and piney hops with sweet malt backing. Medium body with dry finish. If I were to do a blind taste test I'd probably think this one was an amber with the sweet malt. Good solid sessionable beer from Deschutes."

""
""
"O- Another gem from Deschutes."
"A dark amber with a thumbs width white head that started to dwindle just as soon as I put the glass down. Great lacing. A delicious aroma; sweet citric heaven. One of the best grapefruit aromas I have come across from any beer, like I just cut open a fresh grapefruit and put it right up to my nose. Sharp, pointy, crisp. Flavor is just as good with the marriage between malt and hops. A light caramel malt base alongside a wonderful hit of ruby red grapefruit. There is a very balanced layer of piney bitterness throughout. A very crisp, silky mouthfeel aided by the carbonation. Wow, this is a great beer. Extremely balanced, extremely drinkable, extremely good. I can't get enough of this one and can't believe its only seasonal. I could drink this 365 without any problems. So damn good."

""

"O: Deschutes has managed to thread the needle by retaining the hoppy soul of a NW IPA, but in a genuinely refreshing, tasty package. Nice beer to enjoy after hitting the slopes."
"O: An excellent pale ale. Not my absolute favorite but there is really nothing wrong with this beer. Drinks great."
""
""
"Overall, would recommend, but definitely a once-a-week type of brew"
"A great balanced beer. Plenty to enjoy, and easy to do so. ""Edges out, layers in"" indeed."
"O: I would seriously drink this every day and never get tired of it. Pretty much ideal for a session beer. I recommend Deschutes discontinue Mirror Pond in favor of this."
""
"O - With how much I have heard about it, the hype was too much. Beer is good, but nothing I would need to seek out again."
"D - Another great offering from Deschutes. I don't think can make a bad beer, though. The balance on this one alone is remarkable."
"OVERALL - 3 - A little too unbalanced towards hops that aren't as delicious as they ought to be to carry this beer."
"Overall, this is a fine brew that I will look forward to seeing every January. As a side note, I think this would be a perfect candidate for serving on cask. Hopefully someday I'll get a chance for that."
"Overall: One of the best Pale ale's out in the late winter. Another high quality Deschute's product."

"O. This is going to be a regular in my house. It is hoppy but it doesn't assault the mouth. Yum."

"Deschutes Red Chair Northwest Pale Ale: The Deschutes Brewery cranks out some very fine products, so I was looking forward to trying their Red Chair Pale Ale. Peering into this deep cherry wood color brew, you can’t see through it due to a medium amount of haze. The head is thin, but the aroma is wonderful. Lots of hoppy spice and fruit notes. The flavor is outstanding; the malt is subtle while the hops do the talking, but not too loudly. Lots of flavors come and go: apple, spice, and flowers. There is an undercurrent of bitterness, and in a good way. In the end, this is a winner. Maybe not as smooth as other beers, but it is well balanced, and the rich variety of hop notes are wonderful to experience. It will show up in my fridge again."
"Overall it must be said that I have enjoyed this offering for the last several years and I think I have enjoyed it more this year than in the past years. Note: I think it is better right out of the bottle."

"O- A pretty damn good beer that I'm very happy I got the chance to try"
"This is a good beer, but not spectacular. I remember enjoying this a lot more when I was just drinking it, rather than sitting down and actually putting words and numbers to the brew. For that, it gets an extra half-point in the overall rating."
"A MUST try.... A"
""
""
""
"O - A very good example of an APA. I would highly recommend this brew."
"O- A fairly good easy drinking pale ale that provides a good hop kick."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an excellent APA that would appeal to a lot of different palates. I imagine it would be easy to down several of these over the course of an evening."
""
""
"A big, malty yet hoppy and fruity pale ale that is complex enough to be interesting and quite drinkable at the same time. I actually would prefer for a bit lower alcohol percent so I could down more of this. Excellent beer."
""
"Thanks to a buddy who brought back this good tasting brew from Deschutes and shared this with me. Poured into half glass and gives an amber orange appearance with a thin white head and just a touch of lacing. Aroma of citrus, grainy malts with touches of toast and caramel. Dry and spicy aroma overall. Citrus hops upfront with layers of spiciness. The semi-grainy malt backbone is fairly complex with biscuit, toast, caramel and some grassy characteristics. Ends with a spicy bitterness. Moderate carbonation, medium body that is fairly full and smooth for an APA. Nice dry finish. A very nice Pale Ale overall that is quite a bit better than Mirror Pond in my opinion. Quite sessionable!"
"O: over all this is everything i love in a pale ale, sweet spicy citrus hits and nice piney hops...the NW rules!"
""
"great great seasonal. a nice change of pace from the malt bomb spice happy winter beers of 2011/12. this one smells a little sweet, malty and complex, but lighter and drankable. balanced flavor, notes of caramel malts but also some paler stuff and a touch of hops to finish it. fantastic flavor, really really silky in the mouth, like the dead song feel like a stranger... gonna be a silky silky crazy crazy night. thats this beer, smooth as hell and drinkable for days. love love love it"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just a tasty understated brew. Would be great w/ a burger. This should be available year round."
"O - Solid, but not amazing. Good hop presence, but not overly."
""
"I remember really liking this beer. A lot. What happened? Looks great in the glass. Aroma disappoints. Butter and citrus zest. I dig the citrus, not the butter. Flavour is again buttery. Very full, viscous mouthfeel. Diacetyl run amok. Bummer. I really liked this beer in the past, but the flabby butter character is a big let down. Oh well."
""
""
"Poured a clear orange-amber with a white head that was small but still retained well and left some spotty lacing. Aroma of citrus and piney hops mostly. Good balance of bready malts and citrus/pine hops in the taste, citrus pith and splashes of mango. Medium-bodied and very solid overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Its a crime against humanity that this isn't a year around beer. The price is supremely cheap for the quality."

"A rather stellar pale ale - pretty much as balanced as possible, without fear of tipping over and up to the next level of IPA temptation. The purported extra level of booze beyond standard issue in this here particular offering is a minor bit of distraction, but overall this is one hoppy, tasty, and fruity pale ale, worthy of its lofty American stature."
"Appearance is an amber tone with a two finger head. The smell has pine, citrus hops, some malts. Red Chair has a taste of resin coated hops, bread, malts, some orange and other light citrus flavors. MF is medium-fall, with great carbonation. In summary, this is a very nice APA and I wish that I could get this back home in CT."
"o - Overall I thought this was a really nice, drinkable APA. Definitely felt like I could have and would want to have a few of these. Great hoppy and fruity nose and mouthfeel, would love to have it again sometime."
"Pours a clear lite reddish copper with an off white foam head, good head retention and a nice lacing. Smell is of citrus and pine hops with some caramel malts. Light to medium body with expected carbonation. The taste is a nice balance between the biscuity and caramel malts and a crisp citrus hop finish (not extremely hoppy but very present), its also lighter than I expected, very refreshing. Overall a pretty good session / summer beer, I like this one."
"Beer pours a reddish copper hue with just a slight bit of haze. Very nice one finger, frothy white head. Aromas of fruity malt balanced by a solid hop backbone. This beer goes down very smoothly, hoppy, but not a hop bomb, malty, but not overly so. This beer appeals to me in the same way that Sam Adams Boston Lager does. An easy to come by, easy to drink, delicious beer that would probably appeal to lots of different drinker."
"O: This is an incredibly well made beer that has a good balance between hops and malt. Very easy to drink and full of flavor. This would easily be my year round session beer if it weren't a seasonal release."
"O: As previously stated, solid. I will definitely be drinking this beer again in the future and recommend it to others."
"Very enjoyable overall!"
"O- A very well made beer. It's well balanced, full of flavor, easy to drink and is quenching on the palate. I would recommend this to anyone who likes this style and who wants something that's reserved yet does the job well!"
"O: A nice summer sippin' beer, I could drink a lot of it and not care! Over 6% but doesn't knock you down. Solid alternative to stronger pales or IPAs"
"Beer is medium to light in body with a moderately hoppy bitter finish. The lead off is some malt but it is not a big malt flavor just an average lead off flavor. It is a decent beer but nothing too special, a little maltier than I expected but I would have it again."
"Pours a hazy brownish yellow. A bit of smooth head with great lacing. Overall not the prettiest beer ever. Smells pretty great. Lots of light hops and a touch of sweetness... Tasty but not overwhelming. There is a bit of bitterness on the back of each sip but overall pretty solid"
"Pours a clean amber with a nice orange glow with a white head which leaves lots of frothy lacing on the glass. Sweet candy and caramel, citrus hops. Taste is bitter, pine and citrus hops and balanced with a biscuity, toasty caramel body. An excellent and aggressively hopped pale. Let's face it, this is an IPA."
"O-This ""debut Northwest Pale Ale"" is very good. My only regret is that it is a seasonal. Very easy drinking. I could readily enjoy a whole six pack on a hot summer day into evening. One of my favorite APAs."
"A slightly hazy dark amber with a moderate cream head. There is a prominent clean pine scent followed by slightly floral and spice notes. The taste is complex where pine and mild citrus mix with boozy floral notes. This is a hoopy pale ale that because of the higher ABV has some Imperial characteristics. Very tasty indeed. The mouthfeel is creamy and there is some bite to this beer in the form of some mild bitterness. There is a lingering fresh aftertaste and some nice lacing on the glass. I like it. This is another great beer by the wonderfull people at Deschutes."
"Overall a decent pale ale at best it had nice hop and citrus flavors and scents. I would drink this beer again only if someone gave it to me"
"The color when poured was hazy amber with a reddish hue. Very little foam, but, a load of lace on the side of the glass. The smell of piney hops was very evident. I could'nt pick up anyother aromas but hops. On the first sip, piney hops (mild IPA) was sort of overpowering. Upon the second sip, I got a creamy hoppy flavor, with a hint of yeast, citrus and spice, but just a hint. There was also a sweet/bitterness that made it interesting. Loads of components that would have been more evident if not for the overpowering piney flavor. Might as well advertise this as an IPA, not Pale Ale!"
" I normally find Deschutes beers to be well made, but this one really was hard to appreciate, and was really only drinkable straight from the bottle. I won't be buying it again, and I'll keep the last few in the fridge for guests who really aren't into what I usually have on hand."
"-this is a very solid beer. almost like a PA version of torpedo. it's not a big go-to, but i sure do respect it"
"Overall, this is a really good APA from Deschutes. Tip my hat for them. However, I think SNPA is still a tad better."
"This is what a Pale Ale should taste like. The essence of the hops and Pale Ale that come from the Pacific Northwest. I could drink this all day. Deschutes never disappoints. I highly recommend seeking this beer out on-tap as opposed to bottle. I've had both and the freshness from a keg is outstanding."
"O - Really enjoyed this pale ale. Would def like more on a hot summer day. This pale ale brings the caramel/sweet malts into the profile better than any APA I've had thus far."
"LazyL, thanks for the beer packaged. This must be one of your favs, a hopped pale ale."
"Two thumbs up--definitely a buy."
"overall...i'm a bit perplexed at the fence riding aspect that this beer presents. it purposely blurs the line between pale ale and IPA, which presents problems of perception. it's malt-centric for sure, but in my opinion could use more hop character. but then it would be an IPA. oh well. it's enjoyable and worth recommendation to try."
"Cheers Deschutes!"
"Can't say enough about how great the mouthfeel Deschutes puts out on some of their beers, Red Chair fits that bill. A bold northwest American style beer lots of hop variety yet balanced and whole."
"Pours an amber color with a two finger off-white head and a bit of lacing to boot. Smell is piney with some citrus and some sweet bread malts. Taste is well balanced in a bittersweet sorta way. Sweet bready caramel notes with a bitter citrus grapefruit kick. Finish is mainly bitter with some earth tones. Mouth feel is medium bodied smooth and well carbonated. Has a wet hoppy finish. Overall this is a damn good beer. First time having it. At 1.99 for the bottle it was money well spent. If I see it again I just might pick up a couple more bottles."
"The CPJ"
"O: A good APA. It didn't blow me away but very enjoyable and easy to drink. Could easily down three of these."
"This beer is more more malty than hop with lots of chewiness and biscuit elements. The hop is light. The finish has a brown sugar presence. The beer is flat (low carbonation) and very rich. The aroma matches the flavor to a ""T"."
"O: This beer brings me back to how I felt about SNPA when I first started drinking it in the early 90's. Like I was drinking something real special. Could easily pass as an high quality IPA in a blind tasting. But I'll go with label and call it the best pale ale around."
"O: This is currently one of my go-to beers. It's tasty, highly drinkable. The hops are nicely displayed, but it's not palate-destroying, and you can have a couple of them in a night without overdoing things. My only real complaint is that it isn't a year-round beer."
"O- Solid brew that deserves a spot in everyone's fridge"
"This is a really well balanced beer that hits a number of very nice notes; definitely one to stock regularly (provided it's available!)"
"Overall (5): This jumps into my list of top Pale Ales along with Alpha King, Daisy Cutter, and DC Brau Public. Although the nose doesn't stand out, the flavors are incredible and the mouthfeel is very pleasant. A very well done beer which I will seek out again."
"Very good beer."
"This is a really good beer that taste much more complex than your average Pale Ale and isn't too over the top at 6.4%. The more I taste the more I like! I almost skipped it, but decided to pick up a six pack yesterday. I will have to get another six pack before the beer is out of season."
"M: Bold, well rounded, but too heavy."
"D: A really easy-to-drink, simple, nice and balanced APA"
"Pour yields a copper-colored brew with a nice two-finger white head that sticks around for a bit before falling and leaving a ring or two of lacing on the sides of the glass. The nose brings forward some light floral hops and a touch of bready malt. Some citrus there as well. The flavor is an improvement with the bitterness working well along with the floral flavor. Bit of citrus rind there as well. Mild malt in the background. Really drinkable and refreshing. Solid brew, for sure. Thanks again."
"Drinkability: This is a really well balanced beer with a lot of flavor. My wife is not a fan of overly malty or hoppy beers and she loves this one. A very easy drinking American Pale Ale that doesn't scrimp on flavor."
"D-This taste more like a 5% beer, than a 6.4%. If I could get this in Ohio, I'd buy a lot of it."
"As always, I'd always be up for a Deschutes brew, and if out west, I'd recommend this. A very exceptional example of northwest pale ale!"
"Deschutes has one of the best track records with me; not a bad beer yet!"
"Pours a semi-clear dark orange-brown color with a small 1 inch off-white head that fades to a tiny cap. Smells strongly of citrus zest and herbal hops and some sweet malt. Somewhat astringent hop taste up front with the sweet malt coming in at the end. Good carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, a pretty good beer that is very hop heavy. I read that this beer replaced the Red Chair IPA that was a Bond Street Series from Deschutes and honestly I have had that beer and it was much, much better than this offering."
"O - I love a good American Pale Ale and this one doesn't disappoint this is one of those beers that I can drink a number of in a night worth getting sometime to try"
"Pours a lovely dark gold with a huge head. Hoppy nose and hoppy taste , this is the hoppy cousin to the Mirror Pond. Totally drinkable but very well balanced with the hops showing up as the star in this beer. I hope this shows up in BC as it is a great staple beer for the fridge"
"Overall, quite tasty, though I like Mirror Pond better."
"O- Excellent and unique choice, one to go back to time and time again. A real treat to sit back and enjoy and marvel at the craftsmanship and time devoted to entertaining our beer obsession."
"Opinion: I am pretty happy with this beer. It has a nice blend of flavor and the hop schedule is complex enough to keep it interesting. I would definitely drink this beer again and recommend it, especially if you enjoy hoppy beers."
"Appearance is a lightly clouded mid amber having a thin head, but fair lace. Smell has that strong nice balance of rich malts and floral hops. Taste has a light sweet to the malt with a good amount of citric hops that ends dry after going down. Mouthfeel is a viscous medium with good carbonation. A nice enjoyable hearty ale."
"All in all, i wouldn't judge deschutes over this one. I'm gonna hunt them down for others, but I guess this is an example of the american love for hops (that I confess I share) that isn't quite what you expect. Too generic, too bitter but too simple. I like my beer bitter, but flavourful."
"on the lighter side of medium bodied, really refreshing and clean. still has alot of flavor but isn't cumbersome."
"All in all, an undeniable grade-A beer."
"O- Just a spectacular beer from one of the best breweries in the country, IMHO. Seems to taste more hoppy one day and more malty another. Very complex but yet simple and also very drinkable. I have yet to have a Deschutes beer that disappoints and this one is one of their very best."
"O: overall this is a great brew. Expected this to drink more like an IPA considering the abv.. but it really drinks like an APA but with a nice twist.. highly drinkable & go down easy in the heat."
"Overall Drinkability - Overall good beer, but nothing really stands out here. It has balance though, so it's a decent session pale ale. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to have it again though."
"Easy to drink and enjoyable."
"Strong carbonation, not a knock as I could have well done 2 or 3 of these."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being about average. Overall, I thought it was a very nice beer of the style. It had a very nice and bright hoppiness to it, and just enough malt to give it some nice sweet, balancing flavors. Very nice beer overall, definitely one I could drink several of very easily."
"The beer was a clear copper color with a thick cream colored head that stuck around. It smells of sweet caramel malt, fresh peaches and citrus. The taste consists of grassy hops, a lot of sweet malt and a spicy/ lemony aftertaste. The beer is light and coats the tongue until the soft, prickly carbonation washes over leaving the mouth dry. This beer has some great flavor and it's not your typical pale ale, I could see myself getting this again."
"Drinkability on this is high. I hope it stays around for the summer because I could drop these back on a hot day and at 6.4 ABV I wouldn't worry about getting toasted, at least not right away."
"Finish: Clean floral hops with a little stickiness on the lips"
"Very drinkable! I could see sittin' down with a 6er or a case...on the patio or in a fishing boat and relaxing the day away..."
"D - Easy drinking APA. I would think this is more appropriate for a spring/summer release but tastes just the same in the winter!"
"Drink- Nice layered profile and clean flavors. I could put back a few of these. Tastes great and I mean deschutes, how could it not?"
"A good simple Pale ale good good good. Drinkability is mighty fine with me. Don't know what else I can say."
"Overall this is a really great beer, a solid pale ale with a delicious, classically west coast hop character - this will join the ranks of other solid Deschutes beer...mmm"
"Drinkability: Very pleasant and balanced brew with a good amount of desired flavors for the style. The ABV, however, may be a little high for an extreme amount to be consumed in a short session."
"Thanks Dave."
"D: Well made, but not exactly delicious, there is an astringency at times in the flavour. Solid, but I liked the old recipe better."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is definitely a nice poundable beer with a lot of flavor and substance to make it worth drinking for a very long time."
"Would certainly consider this a session beer if I lived in Oregon. Extremely rewarding, I highly recommend this beer."
"Pours a nice light orange amber with a half-finger whitish head that leaves a bit of lacing and a thin layer on the surface. Smell is pine and earthy hops, rather gentle on the nose. Taste leads with hops, fairly strong but not overpowering, backed up by a decent bit of caramel malt sweetness. The flavor is pleasant and soothing. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with below-average carbonation. Everything about this beer says ""Drink me."" Nothing about is says ""I'm amazing," or ""I'm delicious."" It's a nice, balanced pale ale. Not overly flavorful, but very drinkable. I guess the ABV is a bit high to call this a session ale, but it definitely drinks like a session ale. I could kick back with a few of these on a summer afternoon."
"Overall an OK beer, but I would have liked to see some more balance from the malts to offset the bitter notes. Their website indicates this falls somewhere between a pale ale and an IPA. I think its closer to being an IPA than a traditional pale ale."
"Nose is really nicely balanced. I get the pine and citrus hops, but I get the semi dark malts as well. Flavor brings on more of the malt, but citrusy hops stay present. Bitter finish lingers, but is nice. On the lighter side of medium-bodied. Very refreshing and drinkable."
"An easy drinking pale ale."
"D: Very drinkable. This is a good anytime beer, nothing fancy or hyped, just a great goto beer."
"My first beer from Deschutes and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"D: I wasn't the biggest fan of this beer at first, but over the course of the six-pack (not in one sitting), I've been considerably more impressed. Good stuff."
"D - The hops on this one were delicious and were perfectly balanced with the caramel malts. Very enjoyable and easily sessionable."
"M - Light to medium body; light carbonation."
"Red Chair is very well balanced in the taste. Though it follows the smell, there is a meta/mineral background that throws it off just a bit. Other than that it goes down smooth, is very affordable, and in my opinion, is a welcome sort-of new-comer to Deschutes."
"Personally, I don't care what they call it, it is a much better seasonal replacement for Cinder Cone than the Buzzsaw Brown was, and if they get it in their heads to make it year around, well, so much the better. I'm not going to get my hopes (or hops) up."
"I got this beer as part of an order from bottletrek and I am glad I included this in the shipment. This is a good APA offering and one that would be in my regular rotation if it were available."
"Taste, a delicate pale, can't tell its anywhere near 60ibu, aspects of grapefruit to it. A good pale, but really nothing identifiable to it I would figure in a blind test. Balanced, easy to drink. I like the mirror pond pale ale they make moreso. In the bottles I've had, the hops fade pretty quick on this one, a good amount of variation, not too sturdy."
"A good malt backbone carries the beer well but the malt character doesn't dominate. In fact, it's quite bitter and sticky with a clean and lasting bitter finish. I usually have a problem with higher carbonation but it seems that Red Chair could use more as it seems to struggle against a body that's bigger than needed, in my opinion. One of the maltier but even more hoppier American Pales."
"Drinkability is good. I could have a few if I wanted, but I don't."
"Drinkability: This is really good, I will choose this one again easily. I hope Utah keeps importing this one."
"A great beer!"
"Overall, I really like this beer, it's got good flavor and kick and I will continue to look for it during the spring months."
"deschutes makes the best pale ales. mirror pond is my favorite, however red chair is a nice change up. the subtle balance that deschutes uses is impressive. the 6.4 is a nice kick too, which will sneak up on you, being this beer is so drinkable. the fact that they only use whole hops is the most impressive, and all their PAs' have a similar mid-pallet buttery malt. so good! the nose is sweet and not too hoppy, but the hops come in at the end when you taste, dry and well balanced with the malts. i drink this up all spring long, and always look forward to next year's when it's gone."
"drinkability I have to say this beer is highly drinkable and curious tasty beer to savor over at the bar"
"This is another solid beer from Deschutes. For a pale this is pretty hopped up (sort of like Sierra Nevada Pale). I would have liked a bit more balance but at the same time the hophead in me loves this. Will be getting more of this for sure."
"Wow, I am really impressed with this pale ale. Delivers nice flavor without getting too heavy. It's hard to describe, there's a crisp bite of hops in this that I haven't experienced in other beers. Take a drink, bang! it's there, then it's out. Yummy!"
"This is a great pale ale, with some very nice west coast hop flavors. Personally I'd like a little more malt in the backbone, but it's quite good. Awesome flavor, but not so huge as to overwhelm the palate-I could easily drink several of these."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is just under medium bodied, and smooth/creamy as hell. Overall, this is a ridiculously drinkable APA. I don't recall a beer of this style that I've had to date that can touch this beer. Another impressive outing from Deschutes."
"Very good for an American Pale Ale, very Northwestern."
"D: I find this to be very drinkable and the ABV is hidden well. A nice lighter malt balanced PA that still holds a high hop presence."
"Pours a transparent copper color with a 2 finger white head. Head has dang good retention and leaves some nice lacing. Smell contains both hops and malts. Taste is smooth for an APA, starts with the hops in the front of the tongue then moves to the malts in the middle. Deschutes tried to emphasize the malts in this one, it's a really good argument for a great APA that doesn't have a jr IPA. The balance leans a little more to the malty side, but it still seems ""right"" the finish contains some bitterness from the malt and hops but the after taste seems clean. Mouthfeel is perfect for an APA with this flavor profile, just a hair heavier than a hoppy APA, but it still has good carbonation. Drinkability is great, this is something I would share with my friends who have just recently gotten their foot in the door of craft beer. Bravely done Deschutes!"
"D: I could drink these all night long! Keep 'em coming!"
"Not much in the way of carbonation, thin mouthfeel."
"Very drinkable. Well done from Deschutes, again. Tis one took. Bit of getting used to because it doesn't use the typical citrine hops of the NW. A bit dark for a pale ale. Still, well crafted."
"Super drinkable. Doesn't drink like 6.4% at all. Food friendly, sessionable, but still provides that hop fix we all need now and again. Red Chair enters the market at a time when APAs almost seem like old news, as though with the growth of IPAs this style is antiquated or redundant. Red Chair shows that APA still has something to say, it is still relevent, and when done right, you can tell why so many APAs have become brewery flagships over the years. This is a great beer. Nothing new for Deschutes."
"Overall a great hop-forward Pale ale. Worth trying if you see it."
"Love this beer. Tried it on a whim at the Palms because i hadn't seen something listed as a Northwest Pale before. I am sure there are differences, but it very much resembled an IPA to me. My drinking buddies couldn't tell the difference either. Smells like pine, grapefruit and slight cannibis. Loved how smooth this went down though. I drank it with a buffalo chicken sandwich and the spiciness of the chicken was tempered by the hops in the beer, very refreshing and crisp. I went home and immediately bought a 6 pack which was gone in like 2 days. Also tried it with a burger (excellent) and pasta (not bad). I like it because it doesn't dominate the conversation like a strong IPA or 2xIPA, the food has a chance to be complimented by the beer as opposed to being overwhelmed. Delicious."
"Mouthfeel is dry and a little thick, but pleasant. Bitterness is just on the verge of being too much for what I look for in a pale ale, which probably means that it's way too much for most people. I like it."
"Overall, a solid APA and another great outing from Deschutes. I'm in more of an IPA or 2XIPA mode these days but this one hits the spot. High recommend. Avail here in TX. Rotation - winter seasonal so probably a 6pk per season. [O;Y]"
"Overall a very solid pale ale that really leans towards the IPA category. Nicely done."
"D- a very drinkable beer and would be even better during the warmer summer months."
"Just bitter enough without overstepping the pale ale category while keeping the focus more on hop flavor and soft malts. So much juicy tropical fruit comes out on this beer, incredible. Reminds me of the spray that comes out of an orange peel when bent/squeezed. Mouthfeel is very smooth and drinkability is through the roof. I still like a fresh Mirror Pond better, but this is still a very fine ale."
"Mouthfeel is really, really well done, with the tingle post-swallow being the highlight. Drinkability follows the smoothness - very, very good for the 6.2%. Fantastic pale ale, and not too expensive either."
"This beer pours a clear amber-orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of mandarin oranges, grapefruit, pine, and pale malt. The taste has a firm bitterness that runs through everything. There is a lot of citrus, and pine that coats the mouth long after the beer is gone. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively, fine carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a really, really, good APA/IPA hybrid that I will surely become a regular of mine."
"D: Apparently this is the ""debut"" Northwest pale ale--while I don't recall that claim on the label in its previous vintages, otherwise this beer is as strong as ever. Red chair is very full-flavored, not to mention fairly strong for an American-style pale ale. While acidity gets in the way or becomes distracting in many beers, here it elevates the other qualities. A stylistic moniker of 'extra' or 'strong' before the pale ale would not be out of place here, if Deschutes ever decides to shelve the NWPA movement."
"D - This certainly isn't my new favorite APA, but it's kind of different and easy to drink. Might be an interesting one to try with some different food or cheese pairings."
"D: This is a very nice pale-amber ale. I'm not sure if I'd call it an amber as it is missing a little bit of the maltiness present in the style. It definitely has some caramel malts as well. The hops and malt flavors are well balanced. I feel the yeast character is what makes this beer enjoyable. The strain must be more expressive than your standard west coast strain. I find some of the esters present enjoyable. I will buy this again."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Bottle. Poured into a Dogfish head tulip glass a copper color with a fluffy slightly off white head that slowly recedes. The aroma is fairly pungent with notes of citrus, apricot, mixed with a fairly rich malt backbone. Nice lace left from me swirling this around. Medium/light mouthfeel. Hmm, the taste is really not as good as the nose with a hoppy citrus start that then transitions to a a slightly soapy taste and then a burnt toast type flavor. The beginning I like but it then falls apart a little for me."
"Overall, another xpa that I thought was a bit too malty. This one wasn't as bad because it was an apa and I expected a little more malt and not as much hops, but it brought a decent amount of hops to the table."
"D: This is a great beer, nice balance. Very sessionable."
"I think I was expecting a hoppy red ale and got a borderline West Coast IPA. Just another wonderful beer from Deschutes."
"The body is just on the light side of medium. The feel is nicely carbonated, sharp but light. It's mostly slick through the finish where it eventually leaves off at dry. Drinkable? Absolutely. Definitely a sessionable pale ale, despite a surprisingl well hidden ABV."
"This beer didn't blow my mind the first time around, but after revisiting it I'm really impressed! Really tasty, balanced, and easy-drinking."
"Pours a bright copper with enormous meringue-like head that jiggles. Nose has fresh bready components, citrus, and tingly herbal notes. Nice balance of biscuity toasty flavors with citrusy hops. Light bodied and incredibly drinkable. Hides alcohol well."
"Pours a nice one finger head, doesn't last long. Gives nice lacing throughout the glass. Smell is hoppy, not overpowering, and gives a slight hint of sweet malt. Taste is hoppy but very drinkable, not an IPA, but hoppy and SUPER crisp. Slight floral and citrus notes, but very very vague. A little sweet, but nothing too sweet, very very good balance. Mouthfeel is light, and drinkability, like I said is unbelievable, I could drink these all day."
"The taste is also dominated by the same hops. The malt backbone is there, but not impressive. A strong bread taste, but also a lingering mineral bite that I wish it didn't have. The hops suffer from the same somewhat bland hit that it had in the nose. The mouthfeel is not all that impressive, but it's not bad either. The overall decentness combined with the somewhat muted flavor profile of a pale ale as opposed to an IPA makes this fairly drinkable. I jut wish it did the little things a bit better."
"I think this is a great session beer, but the overwhelming citrus tones might get a little tiresome after five or six of these."
"Drinkability: Overall it's a decent brew. I'd drink it again, although there are a lot of better moderate hop/malt brews out there, including quite a few by Deschutes. I had it on tap at Old Chicago, as part of their WBT."
"D: Decent drinkability. A bit hoppy, a bit malty. Pretty easy to drink no thrills APA."
"The taste just doesn't work in the overall beer for me. This one is not for me and I don't think I'll have it again. Does have some nice qualities. Different strokes for different folks though."
"D: really kind of bad. The dough and the cheese were straight up gross. Come on Deschutes, I expect better of you."
"A flavorful and well made beer, balanced, complex, interesting, and refreshing. This may be my favorite pale ale, one of the few spring seasonals I look forward to and buy multiple six packs of."
"Great sessionable brew that does not destroy the pallet, but does bring flavors throughout the drinking experience."
"Slainte."
"Mouthfeel: A little overcarbonated but still highly drinkable, though it may be too bitter to handle for some people."
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. You can tell this is well made.I could drink this on a regular basis if it was available year round."
"D: Quite drinkable, not the hop assault of many new APA's and IPA's."
"Drinkability: A very nice Pale Ale overall that is quite a bit better than Mirror Pond. Very drinkable indeed."
"Notes: This is a light to medium-bodied ale with a very silky mouthfeel. Quite tasty, and makes one Hell of a session brew. Not my favorite seasonal release from Deschutes, but very solid. I'll be enjoying it while it's available."
"Deschutes Brewery--Red Chair NWPA--Northwest Pale Ale--Witness the subtle aromatic seduction of the debut Northwest Pale Ale. Another slap at brewing conventions--2011 12 oz. Bottle. 6.40% ABV. 60 IBU's. (4.25 / 5.0) Pale Ale--IPA? Thick pour. Thin thin lace white head. Clear bright deep amber red hint color. Malty lightly toasted sweet floral hop front.

Sampled 1/9/2011. 6-Pack purchased for $6.50 at PCC--Fremont, Seattle on 1/6/2011"
"D- is very high this really reminds me of an ipa..it tastes and drinks like one its very smooth and creamy well made delicious"
"Drinkability: A really solid pale ale that would verge on IPA territory had it been brewed in other parts of the country"
"Couldn't drink a lot of this in one sitting. Good beer though."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear amber color, nice carbonation, nice thick creamy one-finger plus off-white head, with lots of nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is mostly malty, with a touch of hops, and caramel. The taste is malty, sweet, slightly hoppy, with a nice touch of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice APA."
"The beer pours and orange color with a white head. The aroma is bready malt with some orange citrus, grassy and earthy hops. The flavor is bready and toffee malt with some grassy and citrus hops to balance out the flavor. Low bitterness. The beer is very well balanced. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - This review comes a bit late, as its almost 5 months old, but i cant help but love this beer. I hope its brewed again. A winner in my book. Very drinkable. So drinkable that i didnt want to drink the last one."
"Pours red amber with a strong two finger head. Aroma is piney floral hops. Taste is similar to the smell with a big touch of pine. Very bold and tasty Pale Ale. There is some confusion between the IPA version and the Pale Ale version of Red Chair. The IPA version was in the middle of the IPA style and the Pale Ale version is toward the top of the PA style. Both are very fine beers. The Pale Ale version is very good, maybe one of the best. Too bad it is a limited edition ale. Probably my favorite Pale Ale so far."
"overall just a wonderful pale that really is more of an ipa but works wonders for me on this hot day. a must try."
"A very solid Northwest style pale ale overall, bordering on IPA territory. Highly drinkable."
"I never would have guessed the ABV was this high-- I am quite shocked by this. I thought for sure this would be under 5% and be amongst the top session beers list. That is how smooth and drinkable this beer is. The flavor/nose don't do it for me as much as the looks and the feel! Overall, though, it is quite worthy of another pint!"
"Overall it was a little touch and go at first but a little warming smoothed the rough edges."
"When I think of a brewery that produces traditional Pacific northwest ales Deschutes easily comes to mind first for me,this pale is exactly what Iam talkin about.Poured a clear burnt orange with a fluffy one finger slight off white head that never really fades,a creamy mass holds to the finish.A mix of citrusy/piney hop and a healthy caramel malt base in the nose,no frills just goodness.Flavors are slightly piney but much more grapefruit-like and citrusy, a big biscuity caramel sweet malt base holds up to the hops,the hops win out slightly but its pretty balanced.I could drink this all night,it dont need to be complex for me because the flavors are great,this is old school northwest American craft brewing at it's best."
"First pint of night at the Deschutes pub down the street from Powell's (from notes--was there two nights ago). It's a bright amber color with a thin topping of foam. A lovely aroma wafts off it--piney, with a little floral spiciness. The taste provides a mix of pine-resin, distantly citrusy hops, backed by sufficient caramel malt. Bitterness is moderate, but hop flavor is very prominent. Finishes both dry and toasty. Excellent mouthfeel--carbonation is of course restrained, it being casked, but it has an excellent soft creamy texture. Very good."
"Overall, a very nice beer that would be better served being named differently, style-wise."
"Beer poured a copper color with a one finger head that is leaving lacing. Nose is bready malts and floral hops. Taste is a nice blend of citrus and piney hops well balanced by a nice bready malt backbone. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and the carbonation is quite refreshing. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a very easy drinking session like beer but beware of the abv as it is well hidden!"
"Final Notes: A good beer to pair with a light lunch/dinner or for a night out at the bar. I'll be buying this beer again."
"To my palate this beer is the perfect combination of bitter and sweet, dry and tart, to make a drinkable IPA that can be enjoyed with any food unlike many of the palate wreckers (don't misunderstand, I love those too!). the alcohol makes itself known barely in the flavor, and all-too-soon at the bar as I realize how many of these babies I've had. Pale ale? Whatever. it's a killer beer with killer drinkability. Soft carbonation amid medium body. Enough pale malt sweetness to not-quite-balance the hops, but even the flavor of the malt is towards lightly toasted and untoasted sweet, not really caramelly. It's like sucking down a beautifully buzz-providing orange juice. I love this beer."
"D: This is incredibly drinkable and it is the balance of this beer that makes it so good. Cheers!"
"D- If it werent for such a hoppy taste this could be more drinkable. The tastes are all there, the hops just seem to be doing too much over powering. For something that is 60 IBU's it taste like a heck of a lot more."
"single from College Liquors, Grand Junction, CO"
"D: Overall a decent beer but I'd rather have the red chair IPA. To bad they retired it."
"D - Overall very good beer. A little heavy to be sessionable but still a nice beer with good flavor and drinkability."
"Before I forget, I should mention the aftertaste, it's a dry but not overly dry with a light caramel malt tint."
"D- you won't want to put this one down"
"Caramel malt sweetness accompanied by a strawberry, bubblegum like flavors are met by other fruity esters and a perfect balance from NW citrus, piney hops. Even clocking in at 60 IBUs, this brew has very little bitterness, but plenty of hop flavor. Overall, this is a very drinkable, big APA, and at 6.4%, has a nice warming kick."
"Thick, somewhat chewy mouthfeel. Moderately bitter finish. Balanced and easy drinking. Would buy this one again."
"Overall: The body of the beer is a medium light and the finish is medium. This is a very tasty brew from Deschutes. I like the flavor, the body, the contrast, and the profile. Really good APA."
"overall: real good beer wonderful session beer for a light IPA I would buy this again for sure."
"Another awesome extra from rmjavanut. Also my first beer from Deschutes. Pours very dark for a pale ale, dark orange, almost red. A small but sturdy white head sticks around nicely. Leaves some pretty nice lacing here and there. Smell is faint, much more malts than hops with a slight, pleasant whiff of citrus. Hops are more present in the taste but malts still have the upper hand here. Has a sweet butterscotch and caramel smoothness, carbonation is low which makes it stand out above anything else. Ripe citrus and hops pop in now and again to say hello. I really question the style categorization for Red Chair, it drinks infinitely more like a red ale than a pale (hence the name?), especially with the biscuity aftertaste coming into play. Hops seem to show their face a bit more in the finish. I loved the mouthfeel here, perfect thickness, very smooth. Some may want some more carbonation but I enjoyed the lack of it here. Very drinkable as well, if this were available in my area I'd pick it up as a session beer."
"Pours a brilliant orange color, with a cap of pure white foam. A very nice floral hop aroma is immediately present, and remains throughout. Good spicy hop flavor, and a bit of sweet malt. A nice, hoppy, easy drinking pale ale. Perfect for a Colorado spring afternoon."
"Overall, this is a tasty and refreshing brew, and one I'm enjoying. Luckily my gf was able to bring a 6-pack of this home from Arizona so I'll get to enjoy it again soon. Not something I'd buy often, as it's a little plain, but it's still very enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Pours a red amber with good clarity and a finger of copper tinged tan head. Good retention and lacing also obvious. The aroma is spicy and floral with a hidden malt butterscotch or pear tart to back it up. Fresh and hoppy with an elegant malt backdrop. The flavor is rich and full The flavor up front is hoppy with fresh floral notes that develops into a spicy flavor where the malt background develops, here the hops become more earthy and a light cookielike malt character reveals itself. This one is robust and delicious yet also approachable, balanced, and easily drinkable. The body is medium to a bit thick, the carbonation is high but it lends itself to a creamy fullness that gives a rich feel. Overall this is an exceptional brew, flavorful, well executed. In my book the best Deschutes beer that isn't $13 per bomber. I will buy a six pack of this at least every year."
"D: This is your slightly above average pale ale that shows excellent craftsmanship and care. However, like I said before, not much in the way of innovation or uniqueness here. Very enjoyable nonetheless though and I wouldn't hesitate to reach for it if it were more available in the area."
"Drinkability: this is a very tasty beer which I find quite drinkable indeed. I would definitely not mind having a few of these, especially out grilling or somesuch."
"This beer is a friendly one, like many of Deschutes. It does have a bit more weight on the malt, but it is not overdone. Its light enough to be an warm weather beer, but robust enough to make its way into the cooler months. I do enjoy this option from Deschutes, can be considered a solid go to beer."
"Huh, if I did have this before it makes sense why I forgot it. Not a bed beer by any measure, but certainly nothing special."
"Reddish copper clear body, one finger white head, medium dissipation with nice trail of lacing rings down the glass. Nose is sweet malts with a fairly decent floral hop hit on back end. Taste is a bit more bready than bottled version, and the hops are more noticeable. Mouthfeel is more creamy than the bottled version. Very drinkable, quite sessionable at this ABV. I prefer this to the bottled version. A slight, but noticeable difference."
"On the palate it's an even mix of hop and malt flavors; toast, orange peel, a touch of pine and caramel sweetness. Medium in body but rather crisp, this is somewhere between a pale ale and a Pacific NW-style IPA. The finish reveals a faint metallic twang and a light, smooth bitterness. The body seems a touch heavy to me for this to be a session ale, though the overall mildness makes it very easy to drink. Solid and enjoyable stuff with a distinct Deschutes quality."
"Poured into a snifter from the bottle a nice copper color with a slightly off white head that sticks around somewhat before dissipating to a white cap and crown on the beer. Laces minimally. Smell is very much along the lines of pine with some faint citrus notes. Taste is bitter pine notes with a nice crisp feel and a slight aftertaste of the pine. Overall extremely drinkable with great aromas and flavors."
"I beg to differ. The preceding review was written by an ignorant philistine. It does not drink like an IPA it is a great pale ale with great malt notes of biscuit and caramel sweetness and a citrus hop balance with a light bite and linger yet a long malty finish. The former review should be stricken from the archives and the author reprimanded severely. Luckily, he scored it incongruously high Iand mostly agreed with the score."
"D: This beer was too one dimensional for my tastes. It's an easy drinker, but the grapefruit flavors and aromas make up too much of the picture for my tastes."
"my new favorite go to for a sessionable hop bomb."
"Drinkability is quite good. This one grew on me the more I sipped it. Nice sessionable ale."
" I'll have another please!"
"I highly recommend... a good accompaniment to any chicken/beef dish... even some spicy ones."
"Overall - Yum. One of the best new(ish) beers I've had in a while."
"D: Well balanced, light sweetness goes well to even out all of the hops. Not too bitter. Nice beer."
"Amber/copper in color with a fine, eggshell-colored lace. Aroma is malty with ripe red fruit notes. Clean pithy bitterness delivered on the Deschutes signature brassy, fruity malt profile. Malt flavors are complex, with red fruit dominating, but not sweet or cloying at all. Hops are well integrated-- green and fresh, but not overpowering. Dryish, a bit minerally, with fine carbonation. Balanced and composed-- the definition of finesse. Very well done, one of my favorites from Deschutes."
"Overall: Good, very similar to other Deschutes IPA/PA's."
"This is a very drinkable beer."
"D - I can enjoy these all night long. This would probably go good for a summer bbq. Just need to remember to drink in moderation since its a stronger beer."
"Love this! Definitely recommended as it's a nice change of pace for pale ales. A good malty, full-flavored APA. Kind of like Torpedo, though not as hoppy."
"Bottle, home. Red Chair seems like a cross between an APA, IPA and Amber Ale. The color is somewhere between pumpkin and amber. Tight, dense, off-white cap of bubbles. The aroma has a clean caramel malt note with a fair bit of piney-floral hops. Flavor has a touch of sweetness from the bready, caramel malt, but hops provide a bitter finish and a mildly bitter sense of resin throughout. The feel is round and chewy with some hop oiliness. It's an easy beer to drink with good balance for a West Coast style Pale and a tame but flavorful profile. Enjoyable."
"I had the Red Chair IPA that was discontinued from the Bond Street Ales. That brew had a ton of hop flavor with subtle hop bitterness and was labeled an IPA I guess it shook up the Pacific Northwest brewing scene a bit too much. This is the newly released Red Chair NWPA. Appears a bright copper with a bright white head forming thick and dwindling slow, leaves fine speckled lacing down the sides of my Otter Creek fluted pils glass. Aroma has bitter citrus peels with a fruity floral component. Complex hops very nice offering from Deschutes the flavor really explodes with a nice rolling hop bitterness and citrus zest. A mild fruity sweentess comes through but mainly citrus zest, floral hops, and earthy herbal hops. Hoppier than most IPAs, I don't get it they made an IPA that tasted like a pale and now a pale ale as hoppy as an IPA. Mouthfeel is nice with slick hop oils medium bodied not heavy, carbonation rolls on without a problem. Extremely drinkable a solid beer that I wouldn't mind more access to another fine session ale from the folks at Deschutes, thanks Geof."
"D - Very enjoyable pale ale. Hoppy, fruity, quite flavorful. A 6 pack of these would be a nice companion on a weekend afternoon. Another fine beer from the people at Deschutes."
"The body on this is a bit of a disappointment. This is pretty thin and weak. Carbonation level is low-moderate. I like a bit more chew in my beer. This is like a tamed-down IPA in flavor. Nice crisp hops at the forefront that bitter this one up. Semi-sweet candy-like finish. Not as balanced as I'd like, as it leans a bit more towards the hoppy side, but this is a NWPA, so that's expected. Great beer. Glad I had the opportunity. Thanks again, Evan!"
"D- Pretty high... really a unique and flavorful beer. I'd be happy to drink this again. Really surprised me. Good stuff."
"Nice pale ale here though not all that outstanding. Tastes like a watered down Lagunitas Imperial Red Ale."
"Clear amber with a slight haze. A small amount of carbonation. Healthy off white head producing some lace. Caramel, berries, and a bit of banana in the aroma. Slight sweetness with a bit of spice (nutmeg?) in the middle. Nice balance between the hops and malt up front, a bit on the hoppy side in the finish."
"The palate opens with plenty of bitterness, some orange and citrus rind, and a great hop flavor. Fruity and hoppy, there's some malt character noticeable, toasty, caramel-like and mildly sweet. Drying on the finish with a light sweetness and a lingering bitterness, a touch of alcohol is perceived as well. This is solid stuff. Bigger in body than I care for in an APA (medium-light) with a soft, creamy carbonation, this is enjoyable, though not quite sessionable due to the ABV."
"Drinkability - Very tasty, close to a session beer but the alcohol is getting up there"
"Smells mostly of nice northwestern hops, contrary to the bottle advertising that it is not a full-on hop assault. The taste however, is like the bottle. It has that wonderful hoppiness that I would expect from a northwestern APA, but the malt manages to dull the sharpness of the hops, making it extremely drinkable. The only complaint I really have is that it is a bit thin on the feel, but not too bad."
"Great job, Deschutes! Out of curiosity I visited their website, and was surprised that their first line of introduction for Red Chair was ""Not up for a full-on hop assault?"" While it's not an assault, Red Chair tastefully piles on the hops for a great northwest APA. My only fear is that it might be pushing out the also truly excellent Cinder Cone as a seasonal. Can't we have both!?"
"Bottom Line: Sweet, and easy to drink, probably the easiest to drink and tastiest pale ale I have had. So, if you don't usually like pale ales, you should give this one a shot. It isn't radically different, but it gets it just right."
"Surprisignly full medium body for a pale ale that is slightly chewy with a decent balance of crisp citrus hops and toasted malt. Pretty hop forward with lots of earthy pine and sweet citrus notes. Plenty of lemon and orange peel along with some mango and faint pineapple and grapefruit. This is balanced by a toasty biscuit/caramel malt backbone that is strong but doesn't overpower the fresh hop flavor. Nicely balanced and very quaffable session beer. A lot more complex and hoppy than I expected."
"Other comments: A pretty smooth, not-too-hoppy pale ale."
"Edit: I originally reviewed this as the IPA. My bad."
"Soft seems to be a theme throughout, but just an excellent pale ale that is incredibly subtle. Highly recommended."
"The mouth feel is medium bodied, perhaps a tad light, but still very good. Probably my favorite seasonal offering from Deschutes, it is a very well done, enjoyable and easy to drink beer."
"The flavor is well balanced, with some fruitiness, diacetyl, herbs, and malt. I get quite a little pepper from the hops, with caramel and pale malts that hint toward an English IPA. Good carbonation leaves it smooth and firm. Finishes minty and somewhat bitter, but it's really pleasant. Well done."
"The red chair goes down crisp and clean with a satin feel. The carbonation is close to perfect. It comes in at 6.4abv but in my book every bit a session beer. I could seriously drink this year round and hope it will not be a limited or seasonal release."
"Overall I am really enjoying this, beers like this are helping me get into this style more and more. Which is good, because I generally stick to stouts and the like."
"Off the label: ""Not up for a full-on hop assault? Red Chair NWPA is a smoother ride."" As a hop head I was a bit nervous when I read this, but was pleasantly surprised. The appearance isn't that impressive, not much lacing at all, and not too much of a head. Nice copper color though. The smell is very mild, with a very subtle citrus aroma. The taste was what made me want to write a review about this beer. I was very impressed with how well balanced the hop and malt characters were. The hops are there, but mostly in the background, most of the flavor up front comes from the malt. Usually for me, the hoppier the better. Even as subdued as the hops were in this beer, they were present enough to make me happy. The two positives that really stood out for me about this beer were it's pleasant citrus flavors and its drinkability. I could drink this beer for days. So refreshing! Will definitely buy again!"
"Overall this is a very enjoyable beer. I like the fact that the hops were noticeable but not in your face. A very well rounded offering from Deschutes."
"Very drinkable and a nice addition to the Deschutes line-up (again, assuming this is it's first year)"
