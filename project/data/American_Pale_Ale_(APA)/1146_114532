3.7,11.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Nice slightly hazy golden color with a finger of foam that dissipates into very strong lacing on the glass. Smells of tropical fruits, citrus, and pine. Taste is strong with pine and biscuity malts. Very strong up front, especially for such a low ABV, but finishes relatively clean and crisp. Mouth feel is  medium to high carbonation. Overall a lot more than I expected judging from its 76 BA score. Well worth picking up. Enjoyable.","TBCE","Monday at 02:43 PM"

3.65,9.9,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,"The bottle pops with an assertive burst, but no gushing beer. Pours in to an IPA tulip with 2 fingers of loose white foam that crackles and fizzes away without wasting any time.  A little picturesque lacing and patches of foam around the edges are all that remain. The golden-orange appearance of the beer shows a tremendous degree of clarity, displaying scores of tiny bubbles that ascend with a sense of urgency. A mild aroma of caramel malts, biscuits and sweet fruity esters paves the way for a touch of sour citrus scent. Tastes of toasted grain, a bit of sugar, and some slightly dry, fruity hops compose the flavor profile. There's a nice biscuit-like backbone and an oddly-interesting lemon candy aftertaste that sticks to your palate. The slick mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium, with tame carbonation. A bit surprising given the audible pop that announced the open bottle. Overall, this doesn't quite come together in a cohesive way. It has a decently complex flavor profile but the lack of body and unbalanced attributes holds this one back.  Worthy of a sample and not a bad effort by any means, but give me the Sierra Nevada that's right next to it in the beer cooler if we're looking for a pale ale.","JohnnyI","Jan 23, 2015"

They take it, obviously, away from the pale wheatiness of the original, giving more hops and pale ambers and toast for an IPA or pale ale lover to bite into. The malts, however, seem rushed, allowing for much more infiltration of the hops, and of curious inherent tropical fruitiness to take hold, erasing the strict balance from the grain bill. We are certainly being strict in our dissection, but figured that the lack of balance was the most notable detriment to this guy. The flavor tends to just peter out, without much to bolster or keep your interest. We hope this is not representative of what is to come from the new Goose Island.","TheBrewo","Jun 27, 2014"

Malt and hops are blended well with some biscuit, bread, and caramel malt mixed nicely with some crisp, bitter hops. I find this beer refreshing and tasty, even more refreshing in that it's not caving to the new-fangled trend of ridiculously over-hopping everything and then rating it really high because it's chock full of ridiculously inappropriate levels of hops. Good job Goose Island on making a pale ale that's a friggin' pale ale and not an IPA.","AlCaponeJunior","Jun 23, 2014"

I netted two fingers of rocky, tawny head with persistent retention as the result. Beautiful lacing began to appear as it fell, so I leaned in for a sniff. The pine and grapefruit-citrus nose was as prevalent as any AIPA and my mouth was watering in anticipation. Color was a gorgeous deep-gold (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity. It should come as no surprise that the Unholy Trio of Midas, Mammon and Croesus suddenly appeared to beg for a sip, but I was having none of it. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and the hops were much more prevalent than the label had led me to expect. APA?!? If they say so, but this was really drinking like an AIPA, which was okay by me, actually. Maybe it speaks to how we urban dwellers roll. We need more hops than they can handle in those little soft cities. Finish was dry and I suppose that it could have been as dry and puckering as alum, were it not for their purported malt backbone. All I ask is that they consider putting this beer in a CAN.","woodychandler","Jun 22, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear deep golden color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, grapefruit, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, biscuit, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bright citrus hops and pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, biscuit, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, floral, grass, biscuit, wheat, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish. Nice balance and complexity of citrus hops and pale malt sweetness; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale ale style. Good balance and complexity of citrus hops and pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 24, 2014"

Poured a transparent orange with a generous frothy head that left nice lacing on the glass. Nose is an earthy malt with a bit of grain. Taste to match. No questioning if this could be an IPA, this is a pale made for the fan of the malt but it is a bit grainy too. Decent cross over brew for the macro fan into the possibility if having flavor in your beer? Probably not something I would revisit, decent session brew if there aren't other options.","cosmicevan","Apr 17, 2014"

The bottle says to serve it into a nonic pint glass, check. Aromatics generic hops a bit of citric quality, maybe some floral notes, but just dumbed down and doesn't really jump out at my senses. Flavor clean pale malts, just hints of labile bitterness from a tame hop profile. Even the malt profile is dead on arrival all carbonation not real malt breadiness just a semi sweet cracker/biscuit quality, residual hop bitterness not much in the way of hop flavors if I had to pick some descriptors I would say herbal and citrus notes (very dumbed down) and approachable...sold at a Speedway gas station this shouldn't offend any of the masses or become a "eureka" crossover beer for too many. Mouthfeel, I mentioned the unnatural carbonation, please send us some Goose Island from Chicago...we aren't that far in Ohio. Medium bodied carbonation is just a bit much, no hop oils just a very laid back rather boring stab at a mainstay pale ale.

The smell was full of the wheat that is in the original 312 but with a little bit of added grapefruit. The taste delivered more of the same. It was about what I expected but wasn't boring. Overall I thought it was a good beer for the spring and was happy with it. My only criticism is that it is a bit of a dull beer. But I thought that during a nice spring day, watching the snow melt, there are worse things.","WhiteHillsStore","Mar 11, 2014"

Caramel malt gives a slightly sweet body that mingles with pine and grapefruit hop notes in the taste, giving it good overall balance and high drinkability.","BlackDog","Mar 07, 2014"

Far more full of character than its older 312 brother and proving a good Pale Ale can come out of an A-B brewery... given the right crew to build the recipe!","steveh","Mar 06, 2014"
