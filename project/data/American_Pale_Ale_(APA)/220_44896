Once receded there is a full thick veil of lacing and a surprisingly thick collar...  This one is 110% translucent...  The color is a medium gold with vibrant orange undertones...  A moderate bit of varying paced carbonation rises randomly throughout...     A good bit of lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the session proceeds...  The aroma is earthy and slightly dank...  It's a strong all malt aroma dominated by bread crust and graham crackers...  Perhaps some very faint hints of toffee and orange zest as well...  The aroma was a good indicator of flavor...  In addition to the strong malt base that was expected there is also a distinctive hoppiness and a slight metallic presence...    On the fuller side of medium bodied...  Dense and sits heavy on the tongue...  Moderate carbonation...  This one is a text book American Pale Ale...  Nothing off putting, but nothing overly memorable either , just a rock solid offering which should come as no surprise from Lagunitas...","philbe311","Feb 27, 2015"

The taste was good as well mixing the hops up front with a nice amount of malt to mellow out into a very clean finish. Very happy with this one.","WhiteHillsStore","Feb 26, 2015"

Unlike many of the other Lagunitas offering I've had, this one has more of a bitter hop presence versus the booming maltiness I'm used to from them. This one actually kicks more than some garbage IPAs. It is somewhat understated in the sense of intensity sort of like Dale's Pale Ale and could pretty much be considered an IPA.","mpedara429","Jun 23, 2014"

Taste is definitely big citrus hops...grapefruit/lemon being the primary. If u dont like hitter hops, this is not your beer. Carbonation level is fairly high, but it works with the flavors.

4.24,7.3,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"BOD 038 14. Clear light amber (golden) pour. Massive thick head with excellent lacing and retention. Nice nose of citrus, mostly grapefruit and orange but sweet tropicals are also quite noticeable, coupled with a light spruce over a slight biscuit sweetness. Medium bodied with a nice slick texture. Slightly above normal carbonation with a nice effervescent finish. The flavor profile is a complex blend of hop flavor that leaves the sweet biscuit in the background. It begins as a tropical blend with grapefruit in the forefront, then flows into a grapefruit / orange rind like bitterness. As the bitterness subsides, a touch of biscuit sweetness evolves that highlights the orange hop component. The finish is tart with a burst of effervescence that leaves a slight rind like lingering bitterness. An outstanding well crafted pale ale.","tillmac62","Jun 11, 2014"

Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of bright citrus/floral hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/floral hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish.

3.83,-3,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,3.75," The taste is very good with a modest amount of malt supporting a pretty hop forward flavor with slight spice and pine and gentle tangy zesty citrus which makes for a mostly balanced taste in general with some mild sweetness as it finishes. There is a mild alcohol note in the taste which adds to the slight bite of bitter hops which are almost grapefruit-like. Overall I think this is decent for what it is -a stronger west coast style pale -practically an IPA, but a nice malt balance explains the pale label IMO.","Slatetank","Mar 28, 2014"

This ale pours a hazy yellow copper color with a generous and lasting white frothy head. It sips very clean and light given the abv and the style of beer. The aromas are citrusy and hoppy at first giving way to a malty sweetness. Flavors follow suit with a beginning of pine and citrus as a result of the hops. Giving way to a sweet malt and yest note and resolving back to the bitterness of hops on the finish. I'm even getting some notes of coffee, surprising for an ale of this lightness. As with all the Lagunitas products, this is a quality crafted beer and one that I could enjoy frequently and in ample amounts.","lochef81","Jan 19, 2014"

Aroma is bready crackery malt with lots of grapefruit to counter and a hint of mineral water. The flavor is pretty straight forward. Light hints of sugary sweetness and oyster crackers with plenty of citrusy grapefruit and a hint of pine to skew this one towards that hoppy side of the road. Firm hop bitterness keeps the palette awake. Medium to light body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. Very nice pale ale, nothing horribly complex but with an old school feel and drinkability I could get into a few of these.","johnnnniee","Dec 11, 2013"

It had an amber pour with a creamy head and good hop aroma. It had that signature Lagunitas hop flavor with a bit of toasted malt to keep it balanced. This is another excellent beer from Lagunitas and one I would definitely keep on hand.","brurevu","Nov 24, 2013"

Very tropical aroma, pineapple and mango being the biggest notes. Hints of bready malt is there, but very light. The tropical notes continue in the taste. I can't remember a pale ale this tropical. More of a malt back-bone in the taste then in the aroma. The mouthfeel is quite good, medium bodied but still very drinkable. One of the best parts of this beer is the dirt cheap price, not dirt cheap, but you can't beat $8.99 a sixer of craft beer. If this ever moves to the Cincy area, I would have it in my fridge everyday.","screamking","Oct 24, 2013"

Taste is citrus (grapefruit, orange), well-rounded sweetness with little overt caramel/toffee, some herbal nettle or rosemary notes, perhaps a hint of gooseberry or current as things progress. Crisp and refreshing. Some subtle white pepper heat/spice. Kind of an archetypal APA on the hoppy end of the APA spectrum. Not earth-shattering but certainly not bad either.

Nose was dry and the perfect blend of leafy hops and pale malt. A little grapefruit and a little soap. The malt in the nose gives a promise of sweetness that’s luscious and provocative. Taste is herbal, generous with hops, hay and silky with citrus that wasn’t overbearing. The malt backbone was aggressive and evoked some honey sweetness while standing up strong against the bitter hop oily resin. This was a full bodied and boisterous pale ale that was clean, thirst quenching and had a depth of flavor that was solid and satisfying.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

Smell is awesome. Has that quintessential Lagunitas aroma -- light pine hops, sweet flower (to be honest I think I can't adequately review smell because there is smoking allowed in this bar. Will have to revisit). Taste is similar to other Lagunitas offerings, but less flowery/creamy than Sumpin Ale, and obviously less bitter than the IPA. Still, it's sweet and malty and very good. Mouthfeel is nice, not too biting but also not terribly smooth, with medium carbonation. Overall New Dogtown Pale Ale is very nice, really enjoy the brewery and this fits nicely with other offerings.

Smell: dried tropical fruit pop upfront, then grapefruit and floral. Taste: grapefruit, mango note; pine, biscuit and sugary pale malt in the finish. Lighter side of medium bodied. Bottled 10 days ago, this might be a new go-to once their east coast distribution picks back up. An IPA, but different from Lagunitas' IPA. Both are quite good.","babaracas","Apr 03, 2012"

A perfect west coast pale ale, really pours a glowing orange copper hue with a bright white head forming thick and rising above the rim of my glass. Fine intricate lacing left behind as the head slowly dwindles down, this beer just showed up at my local I may have to clear them out. Look aroma wise it can't get better than this citrus peels with hints of orange, grapefruit, and apricot with even a touch of mild pineapple or something tropical. I know these guys use hop concentrate or hop oils but it's working this beer is so hoppy. Hoppier than their IPA think Hop Stoopid light, that's how they should market this, still a substantial amount of alcohol going on at 6.2% abv it's still effortless to drink besides dealing with a barrage of hop burps that it may induce. Flavor hits with a well rounded bitterness and biscuit pale malts with some herbal spiciness coming through again citrus peels and hops burn your nares with hop burps. Mouthfeel is coated with a slick layer of hop oils streaking across the palate, carbonation is moderate but carries the light to medium bodied pale ale so well. A true classic in my book, you just can't get these same flavors in anyother pale ale out there espcecially any pale in the 6.2 range, which could be a light IPA.","WVbeergeek","Jun 29, 2011"

4.37,10.6,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is an orange-tinged light brown coloring that is almost completely opaque, and a good healthy stream of carbonation present on the pour. The head starts out at a two-inch profile of light, frothy off-white foam, and eventually settles down into a thin layer of bubbles. Aromas are a smooth, tasty blend of caramel sweetness, fresh green hops, and a light citrus highlight. Very well balanced on the nose. The flavors are strong, riding a light and crisp body. Tastes of pepper spice and cedar, with a tangy grapefruit and toffee sweetness. Very well blended, and the peppery spice cleans up the palate on the aftertaste. The finish is quick and dry, leaving the mouth ready for more. Not for the faint of heart or those new to the realm of hops, but for everyone else, this is a tasty Pale!","GarthDanielson","Jun 12, 2011"

It is in the taste, but is still low for what I would like. Otherwise, this is a really good beer. The balance is hoppy, but overall it doesn't go outside the beer's capability. All of this said, I can say that this is one of the better Pale Ales out there. This particular bottle has a bit low of carbonation for what I feel it should.

4.87,23.3,4.5,5,5,4,5,"It starts with the sweet malty biscuit cracker tastes and then just hits you with really nice hop flavors that consist of that grapefruit rind, orange citrus and ends with that fruity bitterness. Not too bitter as the sweet malt washes some of it away but definitely leaves room for the hops to shine through with the bitterness. People would think they'd put fruit in this yet somehow you can tell they don't. Pure hop flavor right here. It also leans towards a lighter mouthfeel despite being sweet from the malts. It definitely has a pale ale body and mouthfeel. This is better than some IPA's I've had. It almost reminds me of a Nugget Nectar light or something.

Now, is it just me or is this Pale Ale on its short way to being as hoppy as Lagunitas IPA? The taste here is generously hoppy, not by much against the style, but just a BIT hoppier...No complaints from me though...Cheers to American PA! While citrus hops do take center stage here, there's a very nice balancing malt to reel this into a smooth and refreshing mouthfeel.

Upon further tasting, this brew has a very tangy bitterness with a twang that has sweet malt in the background that finishes sweeter then drops off a cliff leaving a very dry flat bitterness.

Aroma here is very nice as the citrus hop aroma really comes out, gives a juicy like aroma. Sweetness in the nose comes through and goes together well. The flavors of this one are very good as well, citrus hops hit you the hardest and the flavors of them are excellent. Malts seem to give a slight caramel flavor, also maybe toasted malts? Perhaps just a touch to sweet, but that would be the only thing that I can say might be a retractor. In my opinion this is a well rounded and very tasty beer.

The tap version (to me) had much more of an oily, hoppy flavor to it, it was amazing. The bottled version was good but nowhere even close to the flavor that came off the tap. I've experienced the same thing with several of the hoppier Lagunitas brews. It makes me wonder if they might put some whole hop cones in the actual keg. This beer is definitely worth a try and not overbearing with hop flavor. Definitely leans more towards hops than malts, not at all balanced, but darn tastey, just how I like my ales!

Lots of citrus in the aroma highlighting a bouquet of clean, fresh hops with a hint of malt holding it together. The hops are almost overpowering at first but fade quickly and leave a biscuity, malt center that finishes softly with a dry, pine and grapefruit on the finish. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy and quite enjoyable all around. I'd say this beer is good but a little bit out of balance as far as the flavor goes. The interplay between malt and hop was less than seamless but in general it was worth drinking though Lagunitas has made better beers along the same lines as this one.","apbarwood","Sep 25, 2009"

It boasts of pale and bisquit malts along with a more noble hop based aroma. The taste is decent. It has a turbulant balance of malt and hops. It's got the pale and bisquity flavor, but with citrus hops in the finish. The two don't mix well together. There is a bready sweetness along with a rich mouthfeel.

4.3,8.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured light copper and with a decent head. Smell is light hops and malt. First taste I was very impressed for an APA. Excellent hop taste, one of the few times (being a hop lover) I felt the brewer nailed it with a perfect hop/malt balance. The thing I really liked about this brew is it has it's hops but it's not overboard or too hoppy. You could have several of these and not fry your buds.","unionturf","Dec 07, 2008"
