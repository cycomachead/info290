"This reminds me of a session IPA. Very little malt character. Which is different from most Pale Ale's. This is a piney,hoppy, and slight tropical fruit Pale Ale."

"A finger and a half worth of of pale light khaki colored crisp slightly airy forth that displays decent retention...  Once receded there is a full thick veil of lacing and a surprisingly thick collar...  This one is 110% translucent...  The color is a medium gold with vibrant orange undertones...  A moderate bit of varying paced carbonation rises randomly throughout...     A good bit of lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the session proceeds...  The aroma is earthy and slightly dank...  It's a strong all malt aroma dominated by bread crust and graham crackers...  Perhaps some very faint hints of toffee and orange zest as well...  The aroma was a good indicator of flavor...  In addition to the strong malt base that was expected there is also a distinctive hoppiness and a slight metallic presence...    On the fuller side of medium bodied...  Dense and sits heavy on the tongue...  Moderate carbonation...  This one is a text book American Pale Ale...  Nothing off putting, but nothing overly memorable either , just a rock solid offering which should come as no surprise from Lagunitas..."
"Pours a light orange/ dark yellow with a white head that laces the glass. The smell was really nice with scents of grapefruit and lemon peel as well as some pine. The taste was good as well mixing the hops up front with a nice amount of malt to mellow out into a very clean finish. Very happy with this one."
""
"Bottle poured into a wine glass. Citrus, biscuit, hop aromas and flavors. Good carbonation."
""
""
""
"Have not had this in about a year and a half. One month old bottle. Laggy does not make a bad brew imo, but this one is just ok. Very easy drinking for what it's worth."
"Light amber color withe real light cloudiness.  Mild fruit hoppy smell with hint of pine.  Somewhat bland taste.  Almost like a session ipa with a little malt on back.  Average carb and a little dry.  Wouldn't drink again unless options limited.  Very average."
"You cant go wrong with New Dogtown Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
"Not sure what to make of this vs the IPA, which is roughly the same ABV and IBUs. Hop Stoopid Lite, some people have said; I could get down with that. It's also soft and way drinkable - the only way, in fact, that it actually resembles an APA. Might take this over the IPA, which could be the point. 4.25"
""
""
"Poured one finger white head in a snifter, there was minimal lacing. Color was a bright pale straw color with a little cloudiness. Taste was smooth with a considerable amount of drinkability. Fairly good brew."
""
"Pale slighty cloudy with tons of lace.. A/T pale cracker malt, noticeable pine spice hop, Pilsner mixed with a IPA is the best way to describe it.. Sweet floral aroma is very nice aswell.. Thin lager like body with a heavy hop bitterness and dry cracker malt.. But being a pale ale and not a IPA I think it makes for a great pale ale."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deeper gold, slightly cloudy. There is a nice cap a foamy white head that holds on and leaves some sticky lacing. The aroma is lighter and tropical fruity and floral. The taste has that same quality with a little woody hops added in and a nice lighter caramelly body. The body isn't too heavy and it has a nice light carbonation tingle on the finish."
""
""
""
"Really good pale ale, perfect for BBQ's"
""
"Comes off hoppy. Thick head when poured into a pint glass, nice lacing. Wouldn't of guessed it to be a Pale Ale. Tastes of an IPA. That or I've drank too many IPAs tonight before trying this.I dig it. With Lagunitas it seems you can't go wrong with any of their offerings. Curious to see how the Bros to rate it."
""
""
""
"Above average beer.  Double dry hopped version is much better"
""

"Pours clear orange copper with two nice, tastes of citrusy white hops With a slight malt and dry finish,"

"Overall – This is a very enjoyable brew to drink with tons of flavor but still easy drinking for the pale ale style of the brew.  Rather well done overall."

"A very good pale ale. Smooth, floral on the front, pine bite on the back.  Solid pale ale that I would revisit, but this is on the lower end of Lagunitas IPA offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  A decent pale ale, and I was really impressed by its look.  The taste was surprisingly complex, and it held its own all the way to the end.  A solid effort from Lagunitas."

"Clear amber color , medium , white head. Aroma of pine and caramel malt . Pine and citrus in bittersweet taste. Medium body and carbonation. Good beer."

"I had this on tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Bowling Green, my fourth Lagunitas review.  Lagunitas really nails the IPA/PA beer types.  Great malt and hops flavors, strong citrus, maybe some pine.  I loved the aroma, very strong, you can tell what's coming a mile away.  The color is an orange-copper, very enticing.  Give it a shot if you have a chance."

"You just can't go wrong with Lagunitas when it comes to nailing a style."

"Overall: 4.25/5. One of the best standard APAs I've had. Lighter in body than SNPA, but still big on the flavor without being too over-the-top for the style. Would highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brilliant clarity, frothy ivory head that lingers. Aroma is dominated by pine, earthy and floral hops, and a touch of tropical fruit. Flavor lacks a bit in comparison, fairly bitter dominant in the finish. Malt is somewhat bready, but those bittering hops kill the taste for me. Citrus eventually comes out, but the bitterness overwhelms."

"O: good quality pale ale with nice flavors"
""
""
"O:  Honestly, I was expecting more here.  Lagintas normally has very solid offerings, but this was not one of my favorites. I'm wondering if this keg was a touch old.  Maybe I will revisit this one at a later date."

""

"O: Very good pale ale. Unlike many of the other Lagunitas offering I've had, this one has more of a bitter hop presence versus the booming maltiness I'm used to from them. This one actually kicks more than some garbage IPAs. It is somewhat understated in the sense of intensity sort of like Dale's Pale Ale and could pretty much be considered an IPA."
""
"Pours a crystal clear bright gold. Decent head retention/lace. Looks good! Smells like loads of every type of citrus you can imagine. Big fruit nose. Taste is definitely big citrus hops...grapefruit/lemon being the primary. If u dont like hitter hops, this is not your beer. Carbonation level is fairly high, but it works with the flavors. Overall, I'm impressed. Lagunitas brews some high quality pale ales! If u like hops, this is a good one."

"Not a big fan of this one, but if you're a big hophead, you might like it more than I did."

"BOD 038 14. Clear light amber (golden) pour. Massive thick head with excellent lacing and retention. Nice nose of citrus, mostly grapefruit and orange but sweet tropicals are also quite noticeable, coupled with a light spruce over a slight biscuit sweetness. Medium bodied with a nice slick texture. Slightly above normal carbonation with a nice effervescent finish. The flavor profile is a complex blend of hop flavor that leaves the sweet biscuit in the background. It begins as a tropical blend with grapefruit in the forefront, then flows into a grapefruit / orange rind like bitterness. As the bitterness subsides, a touch of biscuit sweetness evolves that highlights the orange hop component. The finish is tart with a burst of effervescence that leaves a slight rind like lingering bitterness. An outstanding well crafted pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, an OK pale ale with good bitterness. The biscuit malt and grassy hops aren't my thing though."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 4/20/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep gold color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of bright citrus/floral hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/floral hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent pale ale! All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/floral hops and pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"So, it's not sessionable, and not an occasion beer, so I don't see it getting any space in my fridge anytime soon. It's really a notch below the Sculpin and Stone's Ruination IPA, imo. It's not even in the same universe as the Enjoy By."
""

""

"Ho-hum. Let's assault our palate with hops. Could be quite nice if we actually had atleast a trace of malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I know this stuff is beloved but I'm kind of lukewarm on it. It's very average. The dominant flavors don't appeal to me, which is kind of a deal-breaker."

" The taste is very good with a modest amount of malt supporting a pretty hop forward flavor with slight spice and pine and gentle tangy zesty citrus which makes for a mostly balanced taste in general with some mild sweetness as it finishes. There is a mild alcohol note in the taste which adds to the slight bite of bitter hops which are almost grapefruit-like. Overall I think this is decent for what it is -a stronger west coast style pale -practically an IPA, but a nice malt balance explains the pale label IMO."

"Overall / Drinkability: A very hoppy beer - but not a bitter hop wallop. Strong emphasis on aroma hops with this one with a simple hop flavor profile. Well crafted and well done. Interestingly though, due to the dryness and weaker malt backbone, I find one is enough. It's strong flavor wears out my palate such that I don't want another one right away. Another one later on, but not one right now."

"Overall: Goddamn Wonderful. One of, if not the best, PA on the market."
""
"O: Worth a try. Not one of the best pale ales out there, but drinkable and tasty."
""
"Taste starts with grapefruit and orange rind, then stale bread and caramel malts, with a light bready, rindy, floral finish. Mouthfeel is a touch heavier than average with a bit above average carbonation, a bit grainy."

"O - I hope to be able to find this stuff again, it could develop into one of my favorite Pale Ale's. Smooth and crisp, yet packs plenty of flavor. Both hoppy and malty. Quite complex for a Pale Ale. Highly recommended."
"As a fan of Lagunitas' s ipas I was quite excited to try their Apa. It did not dissappoint. This ale pours a hazy yellow copper color with a generous and lasting white frothy head. It sips very clean and light given the abv and the style of beer. The aromas are citrusy and hoppy at first giving way to a malty sweetness. Flavors follow suit with a beginning of pine and citrus as a result of the hops. Giving way to a sweet malt and yest note and resolving back to the bitterness of hops on the finish. I'm even getting some notes of coffee, surprising for an ale of this lightness. As with all the Lagunitas products, this is a quality crafted beer and one that I could enjoy frequently and in ample amounts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Overall - A stellar American Pale Ale from Lagunitas. Nice level of bitterness complemented by the bready malts make this a true example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent pale ale. Would like more hoppiness and less grainy flavors."
""
"O- This is a real nice hoppy pale ale. easy to drink and has a respectable drinkability. Tons of floral piney aftertaste that I enjoy. Makes me want another one. Maybe I will..."
""
"O- I had another one of these beers later that night, and it definitely grew on me. Definitely a pale ale I would gladly recommend and drink again. Long live Lagunitas!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: A decent APA but not something I'd seek out. A little average where that category is concerned but supplies enough hop bitterness to keep things interesting. Would I drink it again? Sure, on-tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very tasty brew that is just a bit beyond sessionable. Definitely is an IPA and not a pale ale. Definitely try it if you have the opportunity!"
"This is one of my favorite pale ales."
""
""
""
"O: This is the best pale ale I have had so far. I love bold beer. This fits the bill."
""
""
""
"Nice pale ale. Great session brew."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a touch hazy medium gold with a decent sized white head that dissipates to light foamy nebulous and marginal lace. Aroma is bready crackery malt with lots of grapefruit to counter and a hint of mineral water. The flavor is pretty straight forward. Light hints of sugary sweetness and oyster crackers with plenty of citrusy grapefruit and a hint of pine to skew this one towards that hoppy side of the road. Firm hop bitterness keeps the palette awake. Medium to light body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. Very nice pale ale, nothing horribly complex but with an old school feel and drinkability I could get into a few of these."

"The Lagunitas New Dogtown Pale Ale really impressed me. I don’t usually pick a Pale Ale, as I would prefer an IPA, but I found the Dogtown Pale Ale a creamy and smooth Pale Ale that I drank easily. It had an amber pour with a creamy head and good hop aroma. It had that signature Lagunitas hop flavor with a bit of toasted malt to keep it balanced. This is another excellent beer from Lagunitas and one I would definitely keep on hand."

"O - Fantastic. I could drink a sixer of these no problem. I'll come back again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall - Really nice beer, packs quite a punch and has a hop bite, mixed with some nice malts to make a balanced beer. One of the best apa's ive had, worth trying for sure."
""
""
""
"A really tasty pale ale. Nothing particularly unique, but the clean, crisp flavors are very well done. Bright hop notes upfront are well balanced with the malt."
""

""

""

"Pours light apricot with a 1 finger foamy white head. Lagunitas never disappoints in the appearance department. Very tropical aroma, pineapple and mango being the biggest notes. Hints of bready malt is there, but very light. The tropical notes continue in the taste. I can't remember a pale ale this tropical. More of a malt back-bone in the taste then in the aroma. The mouthfeel is quite good, medium bodied but still very drinkable. One of the best parts of this beer is the dirt cheap price, not dirt cheap, but you can't beat $8.99 a sixer of craft beer. If this ever moves to the Cincy area, I would have it in my fridge everyday."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a real nice drinkable, well balanced brew by Lagunitas. Pretty hoppy but balanced well to make it very drinkable....almost sessionable. Good beer to sit back and enjoy a few of. If i ever see this on tap id totally get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid beer, I much prefer Peeper as an APA but this isn't a bad deal for the price (around $9.50 for a sixer). It smells great, I just wish its flavor matched its nose a bit more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not as bold as many pale ales but sometimes that's a good thing as components besides the hops get to shine"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very good APA. Highly drinkable, lots of hop flavor and good bitterness that leaves your mouth with a slick resin rather than the dryness associated with high hopped beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well I'm not a fan of IPAs or any beer with overt amount of hops (which is most of Lagunitas stuff), I bought it cause it was cheap but well I shouldn't have since I don't like these kinds of beers. None the less, for hop lovers, this would be a beer you would like to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A tasty pale ale."
"Poured from bottle into New Belgium Tulip. Golden slightly orange color with thick 2 finger foamy head. Grainy piney hop aroma. Taste is crisp piney hop, nice malt balance, and an almost fruity hop finish. Its light and balanced but aggressively hopped. Really nice APA...actually always underestimated this one but its a great brew I will likely get again."
"A good APA, the hop presence resembles an IPA and adds some nice citrus, grapefruit, and pine flavors. The malt is picked up in the nose but is less dominant in the taste, although it gives it a bready quality. The mouthfeel is spot on with the thickness and carbonation but is somewhat oily. Overall, the beer is very drinkable, going down easy and with enough hop flavor to make the beer enjoyable for an IPA fan, but it doesn't have a ton of complexity. Still, it's worth trying."
""
""
"O: Tone down the graininess and you have a serious contender for best pale ale. I am impressed by this offering. While it's not to the level of Sucks or Lil Sumpin Sumpin, it's a very good, very balanced take on the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a pretty tasty, hop-forward APA. The smell is particularly inviting with a nice balance of mildly sweet citrus flavors and sharper, drier notes. The taste is a little bit harsh and rough around the edges, but not terrible by any means. This is a solid, easy to drink brew for everyday drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Outstanding pale ale, Lagunitas is flat out one of the best breweries in the world, and this APA is exactly what you'd want in a pale. Lighter on the body, refreshing, crisp and bright. I could down a ton of these. So delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Second Best Pale Ale ever made. Ridiculously hoppy for a pale ale, and I LOVE that. Close to Lagunitas IPA, without any hint of bitterness. So glad Fresno started carrying this gem. More expensive than the IPA here, but worth every penny!!! Very refreshing."

"12oz brown bottle poured into a pint glass. The beer is a mostly clear golden color with a white head that left streaks on the glass. The beer is full of citrus and tropical fruit aroma and flavors with citrus rind bitterness on the after taste. Medium bodied, smooth and easy enough to drink a few. Very good overall."
""
""
"Overall it's a damn fine quality beer. Not that I would expect anything less from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
"Overall- Solid pale ale which I've had before and will be another go to beer for me. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A hops forward APA that pours cloudy amber with decent foam. Aroma is pineapple, grapefruit, subdued pale malt, woodsy hops. Taste is citrus (grapefruit, orange), well-rounded sweetness with little overt caramel/toffee, some herbal nettle or rosemary notes, perhaps a hint of gooseberry or current as things progress. Crisp and refreshing. Some subtle white pepper heat/spice. Kind of an archetypal APA on the hoppy end of the APA spectrum. Not earth-shattering but certainly not bad either. Would drink a few of these over the course of a hot summer afternoon if not in the mood for a more classic sessional. I continue to really enjoy everything Lagunitas does, particularly the less subtle stuff."
""
""
"This is a very drinkable pale ale. I'm not sure if this really reflects the recent wave of West Coast APAs, but it has some nice hoppy notes. It's not the best of its style, or the best thing from Lagunitas, but I might be getting this again."
""
""
""
"O: Overall a simple but well-made pale ale. If you like them hoppy, then you should try the New Dogtown."
"O- this pale ale reminds me of snpa, citsidy-hop-forward for a pale, very good overall"

"O: Found it in Chiangmai, loving it for its scent, taste and American flavour. Rare find in these parts, takes me back to travels in the US. Would pair well with spicy food but is great by itself."
"o: I'll have to get more of this to try fully carbonated, because it was so good. Another winner from Luganitas."
""
"Grade: B"

""

"Overall this is one of the few American Pale Ale's I like, make that love. Another winner from Lagunitas, which is quickly becoming my favorite brewery. They do hops right. Although this brew is not listed as ""sessionable"" I believe it is the most sessionable A.P.A. I have had."
"O - This is an amazing beer for the summer or really anytime. Super session beer that also carries a pretty high ABV. This is a great ""burger"" beer that would be awesome to bring to any BBQ or to have on draft with some wings and fries."

"I have been leaning towards hoppy pales over IPAs lately because of the finess you get in the flavor. I just recently got to try ZD for the first time and had high hopes, but alas it was all bitter an little flavor. This is just the opposite all hop flavor no bitterness. I hope I can keep getting this around here fresh, perfect summer and almost perfect Pale."
""
""
""
""

"Pours splendid into a pint glass with a tall head of foam that fell ever so slowly to some sticky, craggy lacing. Classic copper orange color and clear. Nose was dry and the perfect blend of leafy hops and pale malt. A little grapefruit and a little soap. The malt in the nose gives a promise of sweetness that’s luscious and provocative. Taste is herbal, generous with hops, hay and silky with citrus that wasn’t overbearing. The malt backbone was aggressive and evoked some honey sweetness while standing up strong against the bitter hop oily resin. This was a full bodied and boisterous pale ale that was clean, thirst quenching and had a depth of flavor that was solid and satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent hoppy pale ale. Certainly not as hoppy or heavy as an IPA, but very flavorful and refreshing. I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this before... or that I don't enjoy more often."
"O: Awesome pale ale from Lagunitas. I'll be buying more of this."
""
""
""
"O- More like a straight up IPA but who's keeping score? Another great beer from a great brewery."
""
"O- Nice drinking pale ale."

"O: a fine American pale ale but I'm not sure it stands out from the other American pale ales I've had. the color that bleeds just every so slightly toward peach is unique, and the orange smell is cool. VERY similar to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which ain't a bad thing at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The brew pours a clear, amber-gold, and is capped by a modestly foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Pale malt aromas and a touch of caramel and honey add a sweetness to the citrus and floral notes that dominate the nose. Slightly toasted malt and a bit of caramel provide the sweet flavors that balance the leafy and citrus hop flavors. Very well balanced, New Dogtown is medium bodied with a perfect level of carbonation."
""
""
""
"Overall I liked it a lot. Would definitely have it again."
""
"Very nice golden color, nice head that fades quickly, lacing on the glass. Strong smell of grapefruit. Citrus and pine on the front end, fades to a gentle sweet malt back. Nice mouthfeel with good bitterness and carbonation that both linger. Overall a really nice pale ale. Perfect on a warm afternoon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: This is an incredible and fantastic beer. It has the perfect balance of hops, slightly more than the sugar. Perfect hop-forward west coast pale ale."

"Medium strenghted body and feel to the brew: a little on the fizzy side but pleasant enough and easy to drink. Passing Alcatraz as I drank the beer made it even better."

"M: Smooth and quaffable."

"O: Lost in Sucksamania is this rock-solid pale ale. Yes, it tastes like many other hoppy offerings from Lagunitas - but when they're all really good-to-fantastic, who cares? A great 'lunch' beer."
""
"Taste is not as complex as some of the other Lagunitas beers I've had. Bold hop character all the way through. I don't detect much malt balance in this pale ale. With all the IPAs these guys produce I guess I was expecting an even balanced and more hops subdued and malty pale ale. Either way, gotta love Lagunitas. Gonna try their Pils next."
"Lagunitas New Dogtown Pale Ale ---3.5/5"
""
"This definitely falls under the extreme category. If you like sucking hop pellets, you'll like this beer."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, It was pretty damn good, although it tried to be a Maximus, however it failed."
""
""
""
"A damn fine pale, one of the best that I've ever had and a definite session beer that I could drink any time. It was so smooth and full of flavor that I had 2 so fast that I had to slow down. A very high recommendation, I can't wait to have another."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall first time having this beer and am impressed, Lagunitas makes some good hoppy beers. Would love to try another one fresher."

"On tap at the Castro Theatre during Noir City festival."

"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. 2 finger fluffy white head, some cling, light golden coloring, lacks that deeper/darker color I associate with other APA's I rate highly. Smell is awesome. Has that quintessential Lagunitas aroma -- light pine hops, sweet flower (to be honest I think I can't adequately review smell because there is smoking allowed in this bar. Will have to revisit). Taste is similar to other Lagunitas offerings, but less flowery/creamy than Sumpin Ale, and obviously less bitter than the IPA. Still, it's sweet and malty and very good. Mouthfeel is nice, not too biting but also not terribly smooth, with medium carbonation. Overall New Dogtown Pale Ale is very nice, really enjoy the brewery and this fits nicely with other offerings. Cheers."

"This is another great lagunitas beer, very hopy and tasty."

"O - A good pale, but not great. Its really threading the line with an IPA, but not quite there. I'd rather go with the IPA"
""
""
""
""
"O: Just malty enough to keep this from being an IPA. A damn good PA that's enjoyable to drink. Glad I bought a 6-pack. The epitome of the style."

"Bottle: Poured a light amber color ale with a relatively large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of medium bitter notes with some light residual sugar. Taste is a mix between some dry malt notes with some bitter hops and subtle floral aromas notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Good but not as hop-centric as I was expecting knowing the brewer other offerings."

"(revisited in June 2013 with a, most likely, 2013 bottle)."
""
"O: Very enjoyable and easy to drink - the alcohol is well hidden as this drinks like a 4% beer than the 6.2% that it is. Very nice aromas and flavors of grapefruit/citrus hops."
"O: An aggressive beast of an APA, this one delivers on both the malts and hops, maintaining a very flavorful balance throughout. Not very bitter, but it shouldn't be with this amount of flavors. Absolutely worth trying"
""
""
""
"O - Pale, hoppy-touch. Pretty balanced."
"Huge fan of Lagunitas here, and this left me a little underwhelmed. That said, this is a well hopped pale, and supremely drinkable. Just not my favorite."
""
""
"O : Overall worth a try. it would not be my first choice but I might drink it again if I see it."
""
"A very hop dominated american pale ale, i'd like to throw in an ""indian"" as well."

"This pours a light golden-amber color with a ruddy orange hue. There is some light foaming and an upfront, assertive grassy hop aroma. The flavor comes across as green, grassy, and hoppy—just what I’d expect!—with a piney bite and a dry finish. Nicely bodied, tasty and smooth. Hoppy pale ales = yum!"
""
""
""
"Very easy drinker. So nicely balanced of a drink. This one may have had a bit of age. but still was nice."
""
"Medium bodied but fuller than expected with a great balance of dry bitterness, citrus/tropical fruit and pale malt.  Dry and bitter up front with some grassy pine flavor countered by orange rind, grapefruit and mango.  Subtle malt backbone but just enough to balance things out.  Easy drinking and very flavorful.  More like an ipa than a pale ale."
"O: I really, really love this beer. It's pretty bitter up front so I think hopheads will appreciate it but it's also nice and balanced for beer drinkers like me who prefer a nutty, malty ales. Highly recommend this one."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is an excellent vision of a very hoppy APA. Just enough malt to keep it from being overly bitter. A fine session ale that will never get boring."
""
"This is a very flavorful APA. It's bready, malty, and full of hops. The citrusy, floral hop character lends great balance and drinkability to this pale ale. I'll definitely have this again."
""
""
"Well done Lagunitas!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear, golden-orange with a slim, frothy looking white head. Fairly light, but lovely fresh hoppy aroma...sweet floral and citrus. Tasty oily floral and orange rind flavor. Solidly bitter with some sweet grain and subtle biscuit to back up the hops. Medium bodied, pretty crisp, and very drinkable. This is a really nice example of the style. Satisfying!"
""
"Overall - Definitely a very flavorful and bright pale ale. I like this because the citrus stands out more than the other flavors, and the finish is very crisp and dry. 6.2% ABV makes this nearly sessionable, a great APA to knock back on a hot summer night, like I am right now. Another excellent Lagunita's offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, this is one of my favorite pale ales out there. Highly recommended!"

"Surprisingly good. Great balance, perfect bitterness. Very good on the patio during an Arizona spring day."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass, unknown bottled date. This pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a decent foamy off white head which leaves a lacing. The smells are of pine hops and caramel. The feel is medium with a mouth coating hop resin. The taste is pretty good, closer to an IPA which I really liked, nice amount of bitterness, good earthy flavor with a nice caramel backbone."
""
""
""
""
""
"Life is uncertain. Don't sip."
""
""
""
"Did I mention the nice head? It's another great Lagunitas product that I would love to drink again and again."
""
""
"Overall, a simple pale ale that ends up being as balanced as I would prefer them... not too malty, and only slightly hoppier than usual. A solid product."
"It seems like they can only make IPA's over at Lagunitas, but I can't complain."
"O- Enjoyable for sure. Would probably choose lil sumpin sumpin over this 9 times outta 10 however"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O - An interesting take on the style that combines the drinkability of a Pale Ale with the scorching hop bitterness of an IPA. Another nice Lagunitas offering."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber with white rocky head. Slowly settles leaving a sheet of delicate lace down the glass. Smell: dried tropical fruit pop upfront, then grapefruit and floral. Taste: grapefruit, mango note; pine, biscuit and sugary pale malt in the finish. Lighter side of medium bodied. Bottled 10 days ago, this might be a new go-to once their east coast distribution picks back up. An IPA, but different from Lagunitas' IPA. Both are quite good."
""
"this brew pours a nice full bodied golden color. the head has been sticking around for a good amount of time. it is a creamy off white. the smell is more of an ipa than a pale ale but i am likeing it a bunch. there is the slight malt with a strong hop overtone. the taste isn't as sweet as some pale ales but it has something different that i really enjoy. it is like the little brother to the Lagunitas imperial red ale. there is a sense of grapefruit tingles the tounge. there is freshness that reminds me of the smell givin off from a fresh tomato plant. the mouthfeel is bubbly with some thickness as it moves through. overall i really enjoy this take on the style and will go back to this one plenty of times."
"O-pretty good beer. very straightforward. I could enjoy this any time. Nothing to go out of my way for though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good beer. It's not great, but I suggest trying it atleast once. It has a high ABV for a APA (6.2%). It's very drinkable, and has nice flavors in there. I'd say it's just about average as far as APAs go."
""
""
"Verdict: A decent pale ale, it’s definitely not Lagunitas’ best effort, but still a solid brew. I do have some high expectations when it comes to their hoppy beers with the successes of Lagunitas Sucks, Maximus and Hop Stoopid, and this does fall a bit short, but a great beer for someone getting into craft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was expecting a little bit more from the nose. But all in all it's still tasty. I wouldn't hesitate to try again."
"O - One great APA glad it is back and better than ever."
""
"O: I will never apologize for being a beer geek. I love trying out new beers every week, and either liking, loving or severely disliking them. This is a beer I like. It’s packaged with good looks, enough smells to keep your interest, a taste that fools you a little but works itself out in the end, mouthfeel that doesn’t suck, and gives the drinker an overall feeling of satisfaction, first for having made a smart purchase, and second for having enjoyed a pretty good beer. How was that for a run-on sentence? Sorry, Ms. Littman – I promise to do better next time."
""
""
""

"Overall: B+"

"If you around it, get dis!"

""
""
"O- I am a big lill sumpin sumpin fan and I was scared to try this beer. I had it on tap at the Lagunitas taproom and really enjoyed it and later bought a six pack. Its a very solid pale. I've come to the conclusion that I like Lagunitas on tap a lot better than in bottles after trying this beer."
""
"Overall a decent beer. I guess I was secretly hoping for something a bit better since it’s Lagunitas, but I’d have it again."
""
"O: I've had this beer a few times before and enjoyed it as a refreshing, flavorful, but still light, brew. Sitting down to review, I found myself longing for a more hop forward approach (wished it followed the nose a bit more), and a little more substance in the body... but then - isn't that asking a little too much of the style? This is not an IPA - although the nose teases you into thinking it may be. So - overall - a good Pale IMO."
""
""
"Poured a clear, light amber color with less than one finger's worth of head that quickly dissipated. A strong aroma of citrus, and hints of banana. This a very clean tasting beer with a refreshing hop character. The hop bitterness is well balanced. The mouthfeel is decent despite the lack of head retention. Overall the his a highly drinkable Pale Ale."
""
"Color is amber with a moderate head that is quite persistent. Lots of lacing on the glass too. I have to give it an extra half point for appearance since I LOLed at the label. Citrus hop scents are nice but a bit faded and weak. Hops are a bit subdued in the flavor as well. There is a floral bitterness that provides a slight balance to the malts. Typical mouthfeel. Not bad overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Word to the wise - if you're out of California/tap range, make sure you try a fresh bottle - this style and this brew especially go downhill quickly should you not obtain the freshest possible."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am kind of disappointed that I can't find this locally since I needed to order this from halftime beverage.com but at least I can find the IPA."
""

""
""
"Not bad. Big Flavor."
""

"O - very good pale ale"
""
""

"New Dogtown pale ale looks like a pale, a light golden color mixed in with some faint yellow and orange. A nice amount of foam on top that left some stains. Smell is fairly simple and light, faint aroma hops with earth and a mild backing in malt profile. A nice array of light citrus hits the nostrils with light grapefruit, papaya, etc. Taste is a laid back pale ale, pale malt with a earthy taste and light citrus with grapefruit, mango etc, slight pine, just light tropics and light malt, that's the name of the game when it comes to the pales. Feel is light, smooth with a mild bittering that leaves instantly, comes and goes, leaving dogtown to be easy drinking, without killing ye old palate. I could drink this all day given the chance."
""
""
""
""
"O – A good drinking beer that I can drink one after another. Nothing special just plain good."
""
""
""
"O: Lagunitas does it again with this fantastic pale ale. I'd like to complement it with an orange wedge and see how it does... I hope I get to try this again."
"Overall, this is a delicious pale ale on the verge of being an IPA. Very refreshing, overall a great choice."

"O- Good, but misses the boat on the balance that I treasure in an APA (i.e. Sierra Nevada, Victory Headwaters). I'd have it again, but won't seek it out."
"O. Don't consider this beer if you are new to beer drinking. It is very hard to drink and tastes horrible."
"Peppery, spicy, but bright with fruit characters and really nicely balanced. It's a pretty complete beer—it's hard to see how it could be improved. This is the rare sort of beer that I'd be happy to drink by the six-pack."
"Overall: Good pales, but...it is IPA strength, IPA bitterness...its an IPA. In fact, it is pretty much indistinguishable from Lagunitas IPA. Solid beer, but it feels like they brewed it twice and slapped two different labels on it. Lagunitas should drop either their APA or IPA and use that spot to release something else regularly."
"(O) I feel this beer drinks more like an IPA than a Pale Ale. It's got a lot more hops and bitterness than I expected to it."
"Overall a hop forward pale ale but not too dominating. I would prefer more malt backbone on this."
"O: A solid pale ale with a noticeable malt backbone. Me likey. A solid ""A" rated brew."
"serving type: bottle"
"Overall: interesting beer but not going to get this one again."
"O: This beer looked and smelled great. The flavor was pretty good, but the mouthfeel was lacking. Overall, pretty good though."
"O - Enjoyable APA with a story to tell...but that story has a journey through India at times :)"
"Big floral, dried citrus peel, pale malt aroma. Wondering how old this is... Caramel malts, dense and chewy, some light weedy bitterness and citrus flavor also. Medium bodied, drinkable... easy to have a couple. This bottle seems a bit malt forward, though there's some residual hop character left. Will probably re-try down the road sometime."
"Definitely worth a try."
"Damned tasty Pale Ale. Nice crisp hoppiness with a tasty bready backbone. Would definitely buy this again, especially if I come across a really fresh sample."
"Pours a golden orange color with a frothy white head that left a lot of lacing. The aroma is awesome, I could smell fruity bubblegum, creamy vanilla and grapefruit and sugar. It tastes bitter at first with lots of lemon, tangerine and grapefruit, it has a wave of sweetness and a piney aftertaste. The beer is medium bodied with lots of soft carbonation and a dry hoppy finish. This pale ale can hang with the best in my opinion."
"12 oz bottle. Pours deep golden with a fluffy, short lived, white head. Citrusy hops, biscuit malt and marmalade in the aroma. Light-medium tangy body. Taste starts with moderate citrus hops followed by biscuit malt and ripe fruit. Then finish becomes dry and quite hoppy. Delicious brew."
"Enjoy!"
"Pours a clear honey orange with a 2 inch off-white head that settles to a chunky and craggy foam. Thick chunks of lace and foam stick to the walls of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of very nice citrus and tropical fruit notes with some grapefruit juice aromas. Taste is very hopppy with citrus zest, unsweetened grapefruit and its juices, and a slight malt presence towards the finish. A mild hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good APA with a very nice smell and another solid beer coming out of Lagunitas."
"12oz bottle from a six pack that cost me $8.99 (not too bad). Bright orange color, super head, some lace. The smell is extra hoppy, mostly citrus. The flavor is a hopped up pale ale, citrus flavors and bitterness. This could almost be an IPA with the level of hoppiness going on. I really enjoyed this and might have to buy some more soon. Good job Lagunitas!"
"Faint malts, a little ""biscuity"" as the bros would say. Great stuff."
"This beer begs the question of where a pale stops and an indian pale begins. Presented this blind, i would probably guess IPA, but its not out of bounds for a regular pale."
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and has a medium level of carbonation. Leaves a smooth layer on your palate after each sip. This is very drinkable, and very balanced. Overall, this is a great brew. A great APA, definitely glad I picked it up."
"O - Overall, for a pale ale, quite bitter and quite powerful at 6.2%"
"O: This brew is pretty on par with the style but I just wanted a bit more balance in it. A little more of a malt presence would have been nice."
"A delicious pale ale--though at this ABV and with this much hop presence, it's really much closer to an IPA, in my opinion. Whatever they call it, it doesn't matter--this is tasty beer, especially perfect on a summer afternoon."
"Dogtown pours out a clear tangerine color with a sticky white head that leaves some of the best lacing I've seen lately. The aroma – a hop lovers paradise – is a wonderful orange and grapefruit citrus blend. Dogtown tastes of citrus bitterness throughout the drink, but is exceptionally well balanced by the sweet pale malts which together give it a lemon and honey characteristic. You get a small snap of grapefruit bitterness on the swallow, but it doesn’t overburden the tongue like other APAs or IPAs do. Overall, this is a really fantastic APA."
"This ale pours fairly clear deep golden/light amber color with a white head that quickly diminishes and leave a bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very inviting, fresh citrus hops and just a bit sweet malt. The flavor is hop forward, grapefruit and lemon rinds, with high hop bitterness that delivers a nice poke to the tongue. Any malt flavor is second fiddle to the hops. The beer finishes with a lingering hop bitterness/flavor and well-balanced, not dry, not sweet. The carbonation and body are both moderate. Overall a solid APA."
"Light copper orange color. Clear, with a nice two finger head, lacing around the glass as it subsides. Aromas of pine and candied grapefruit. This is a big APA, as many others have said, borderline IPA. Nice malt backbone to balance the big hops. Also, this beer tastes like Lagunitas to me, in a good way. I feel like even if I had never had this beer and I were tasting it blind I could still identify it as a Lagunitas beer. I think that is the case with most of their beers, nothing wrong with it though, I happen to like their style."
"Don't really like this so much. In my opinion, it's too sweet for an apa. The alcohol also seems kind of noticeable which is weird for a pale ale. I like Sierra Nevada better. Probably won't get this again"
"Overall: So let's see. So far in this review I've coined the term ""Lagunitas Doily Effect"". I've also created the League of Craft Beer Super Friends and in the process made Lagunitas a super villian based on their line of APA, IPA, and DIPA formulas. I've also referred to this as ""Beer pr0n"". Yeah, for an APA this is phenomenal. APA's should aspire to this level of greatness."
"I've been meaning to retry this beers ""New"" Dogtown version, I have to say I love Lagunitas and all things Petaluma, CA (Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals). Had a great time living in Cali when I was a youth, summer of 2001 and I turned 20 I was living in SoCal...this is the type of beer I fell in love with out there that got me this into beer. A perfect west coast pale ale, really pours a glowing orange copper hue with a bright white head forming thick and rising above the rim of my glass. Fine intricate lacing left behind as the head slowly dwindles down, this beer just showed up at my local I may have to clear them out. Look aroma wise it can't get better than this citrus peels with hints of orange, grapefruit, and apricot with even a touch of mild pineapple or something tropical. I know these guys use hop concentrate or hop oils but it's working this beer is so hoppy. Hoppier than their IPA think Hop Stoopid light, that's how they should market this, still a substantial amount of alcohol going on at 6.2% abv it's still effortless to drink besides dealing with a barrage of hop burps that it may induce. Flavor hits with a well rounded bitterness and biscuit pale malts with some herbal spiciness coming through again citrus peels and hops burn your nares with hop burps. Mouthfeel is coated with a slick layer of hop oils streaking across the palate, carbonation is moderate but carries the light to medium bodied pale ale so well. A true classic in my book, you just can't get these same flavors in anyother pale ale out there espcecially any pale in the 6.2 range, which could be a light IPA."
"O: A good, hoppy Pale Ale. Very enjoyable and worth a try."
"overall, nice example of style creamy, refreshing, good, not the best."
"Overall: Well balanced APA with the signature Lagunitas hops making their presence known. Still trying to decide if it is a positive or negative that most Lagunitas beers have a somewhat similar taste profile, but when they taste so good, I guess the answer should be obvious."
"New Dogtown is delightfully crisp, clean and refreshing with fruity, citric, piney and pungent hop flavors and aromas. Fantastic example of the style."
"Drink- A nice little 12oz bottle of beer. Was a great way to unwind after work. This might be the beer to keep around the house in six pack form."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is an orange-tinged light brown coloring that is almost completely opaque, and a good healthy stream of carbonation present on the pour. The head starts out at a two-inch profile of light, frothy off-white foam, and eventually settles down into a thin layer of bubbles. Aromas are a smooth, tasty blend of caramel sweetness, fresh green hops, and a light citrus highlight. Very well balanced on the nose. The flavors are strong, riding a light and crisp body. Tastes of pepper spice and cedar, with a tangy grapefruit and toffee sweetness. Very well blended, and the peppery spice cleans up the palate on the aftertaste. The finish is quick and dry, leaving the mouth ready for more. Not for the faint of heart or those new to the realm of hops, but for everyone else, this is a tasty Pale!"
"notes: I really enjoyed this brew.i am a big fan of APA's and always looking for a great APA. this brew defies greatness and should be tried by all. i highly recomend this brew to any APA fans out there."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good Pale Ale. It is definitely not an Imperial beer, and overall about my only ""beef"" with it is that the carbonation didn't stick. It is in the taste, but is still low for what I would like. Otherwise, this is a really good beer. The balance is hoppy, but overall it doesn't go outside the beer's capability. All of this said, I can say that this is one of the better Pale Ales out there. This particular bottle has a bit low of carbonation for what I feel it should. I do not regret picking up a six-pack of this beer."
"This is my go-to beer of the moment. Very hoppy as pale ales go. I often prefer a hoppier pale ale like this to an IPA: the better-balanced hop and malt profiles actually make it easier to appreciate the nuances of both. Wonderful golden hue with ample head makes this a very satisfying beer to behold, too. Reasonably priced, which doesn't hurt. Highly recommended."
"Great drinking pale. Record Toronto heat, who cares - got my citrus hoppy satisfiying thirst quencher (follows with water bottle). Pours orange and is very lacey. Neutral aroma, but high marks in drinkability and taste. A little less carbonation is only tiny criticism."
"Uber drinkable, this is what APA is all about. Dogtown is great, way better than their IPA and one of the better everyday Pales on the market. Reccomended."
"O - Not bad at all. A solid pale ale and easily sessionable. Certainly wouldn't disappoint any hop head."
"Overall - A delicious beer that is actually more is a IPA than a PA. It's not overly sweet and it his a great west coast citrus flavour and lots of hops. If I could make any changes, I might tone down the carbonation level a little bit, but other than that it's a great beer."
"It starts with the sweet malty biscuit cracker tastes and then just hits you with really nice hop flavors that consist of that grapefruit rind, orange citrus and ends with that fruity bitterness. Not too bitter as the sweet malt washes some of it away but definitely leaves room for the hops to shine through with the bitterness. People would think they'd put fruit in this yet somehow you can tell they don't. Pure hop flavor right here. It also leans towards a lighter mouthfeel despite being sweet from the malts. It definitely has a pale ale body and mouthfeel. This is better than some IPA's I've had. It almost reminds me of a Nugget Nectar light or something. Excellent beer and definitely one of my favorite Pale Ales EVER."
"O: nice easy drinker.. very good stuff here.."
"Very drinkable. Very tasty and bitter. A bit bigger tasting and bitter than most pale ales. Borders the IPA line."
"The brew does feel clean and a light chewy with some oiliness. The palate is left quenched."
"Notes: This light to medium-bodied brew is overall pretty good, but lacks a bit in some aspects. The thin mouthfeel and light aroma are a bit of a downer, but taste makes up for it. On a humid day, this is just the type of beer I would seek out."
"This is more intense than their IPA, but takes the cake as one of my favorite american pale ales."
"Overall, really enjoyed the aroma but missed on the flavor. A bitter showcase for sure and I enjoy some semblance of balance. Avail here in TX. Rotation - one is enough for now but would revisit in a year or two. [N;N;BL]"

So it time for some New DogTown Pale Ale!!! The color is a golden clear amber with a finger white head. The nose includes a subtle citrus...not over bearing. The taste is a triumverate of citrus, malt and booz....a little more leaning towards the malt and booz. the taste lingers tart on the pallete. The mouthfeel is decent and certainly would try to session, but may get too citruscy after a while."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall it was a very nice APA, I really liked the brighter, fruity notes the hops had. It had a nice balance between the sweet flavors at first and the bitter flavors in the finish. Very nice beer of the style."
"Overall, a good pale ale that I would have no problem buying again."
"New Dogtown is, as the brewery will tell you, pretty doggone good. It has a lot more body and character (read: hoppiness) than most of its pale ale brethren which makes it bound to be blissfully, boundlessly quaffable to a select few, while too much to handle for the vast majority of others. From where I sit, it's everything a proudly American pale ale should be."
"Overall: A very solid pale ale with great flavor and crispness. This APA could probably pass just as easily as an IPA"
"Into a pint glass on 3.30.11 this pours a slightly hazy dull yellow golden color with a sudsy thin head. Aroma seems right on for an APA with a nice combination of pale malt and outstanding flowery and citrus hops. Now, is it just me or is this Pale Ale on its short way to being as hoppy as Lagunitas IPA? The taste here is generously hoppy, not by much against the style, but just a BIT hoppier...No complaints from me though...Cheers to American PA! While citrus hops do take center stage here, there's a very nice balancing malt to reel this into a smooth and refreshing mouthfeel. There's a favorable, somewhat sour, and acidic bitterness in the very citrusy hop accented finish."
"Mouthfeel is mild with a steady carbonation and before mentioned bitterness that I find style appropriate. It could use a little more malts to balance things out or more of a hop flavor but all that said it's a very drinkable beer. Nothing memorable."
"D: It is not fresh but it retains its original flavors somewhat; it is okay."
"I'm still not quite sure I like this, but it's definitely not your run of the mill pale ale. The herbal tea flavors from the hops really set this one apart. I can definitely imagine some interesting and potentially quite rewarding food pairings to be had with this beer."
"Overall a very satisfying Pale Ale that had a nice blending of fruit, malts and hops."
"I was surprised initially by how hoppy it was, almost reaching to an IPA status. It does mellow, or I got used to the hops, but it is definitely within the APA framework. Citrus abounds, malts are pale and light, body is medium, and finish is dry. Drinkable as hell and gets a definite go-ahead for this category."
"Lagunitas' Pale Ale is very drinkable. It's pretty sweet and is the most citrusy I've had of Lagunitas, or maybe any other brewery. I wouldn't say this is one of Lagunitas' best - they make some of the best pale ales I know of - but it's still a damn good beer and entirely enjoyable. It doesn't look too great or smell too profound but you can't argue against the taste and drinkability. Yummy!"
"12oz bottle. Pours a semi-translucent golden color with a thin head. Good lacing. Aroma is of citrus and floral hops. Nice bitter, citrusy taste. Good amount of hop flavor to this one. Slightly floral as well as some breadiness. Bitter aftertaste. This is a smooth, refreshing Pale Ale. Good price for the amount of hops and flavor. Fine APA for certain."
"Te citrus follows through nicely in the taste and the finish brings a blended bitterness all the way home. This is a lip smacker. For a pale ale this has hops in spades and even better, has some complexity and nuance to boot. Mouthfeel could probably use some light or dainty texture adjustments as it seems a bit heavy overall. Still, that seems like a minor complaint. More quality from Petaluma."
"The mouthfeel is nice, it's medium bodied and goes down quite easily. The drinkability is also great, this is is just a superb pale ale from top to bottom, sure to please hop-heads. Lagunitas sure knows their way around a hoppy brew. Highly recommended."
"M - medium body; a little firmness; decent length; balanced;"
"Maybe I'm being a little hard on it (though the score I'm giving isn't bad), but for me the beer is a miss. Give me Dale's Pale Ale or Berkshire Ale instead."
"Really nice carbonation and mouthfeel, as it has a nice body and fantastic tingly carbonation that never overpowers. Drinkability is stellar as a result of all that, there's no knock on it whatsoever other than the relatively high 6.1% abv for a pale ale. This might become my go to beer-in-bulk selection."
"Overall, a tremendous value. This is my go to pale ale from now on."
"Notes: Overall this is a good beer. It isn't great in terms of pale ales, although it is a solid choice. The hops are somewhere between a sticky, resiny APA and an earthy English Pale Ale, and I'm not entirely sure if I like the combination."
"D; Would drink another."
"The beer pours a golden orange color with a white head. I get a of different things in the aroma. At first I get a lot of orange and some biscuit malt, but then it opens up and I get a lot of fruit - pineapple, pine, papaya and some cattiness. The flavor is not as complex. I get some pine and biscuit malt as well as some papaya and pineapple. Low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: Another enjoyable and drinkable beer from Lagunitas. Will get again soon. However, feel this is on the verge of a IPA and that may be why I like it so much."
"Keep it up Lagunitas. I have foud a new brewery to love."
"D: Really easy drink with a good appeal to new drinkers. However, not really a great showing for Pale Ales, in my opinion."
"fantastic pale ale. easy to drink, perfect balance. not so hoppy that i can't taste the malt, and not too malty that it competes with the fruitiness. Lagunitas never fails to deliver."
" Body is nice and crisp, clean throughout. Carbonation is fairly mellow. This is a pleasure to drink, an excellent example of a hoppy American pale ale."
"Lagunitas mentions on the label that this beer, when first brewed, tasted like brocolli and had palate devasting carbonation. Sounds like a way to lose your appetite. New Dogtown will wet your appetite, and keep you going for another round."
"If your looking pale ale that is a wanna be (not in a bad way) IPA this is a good choice. I'm loving the hops in this one."
"Pronounced hop presence is the lead dog here. Bitter and dry, somebody else said this one seemed more British in style and I agree. Tastes like a well hoped Brit IPA, doesnt have that citric/grapefruit assault of more West Coast style IPAs...anyway, of course I like, but I'm not in love. Servicable, sessionable, works fine in a pinch, just wouldnt call it a ""go to"" IPA."
"Crystal clear lightish golden pour with about two fingers of white head. Kinda grassy/citrusy hop aroma. Lots of grapefruit and some tropical fruit notes in the taste. Pine is more of a tertiary flavor. Malty backbone makes a pretty strong appearance in the mid to latter stages of the taste. Light to medium bodied beer. This is just one of those beers that you'd like to session. Very easy drinking and the flavors are not anything that's going to destroy your palate after multiples. This is good for the style, but I prefer Lagunitas' bigger offerings."
"Overall- This was unexpectedly great! Reminds me a lot of FFF Alpha King actually. I feel this is closer to an IPA than your classic APA, but either way it is a very good beer."
"12 0z bottle from Roths Sunnyside Market Nice clear light copper coloured ale, with a small yet persistand egg-shell white head. Copious lace. Vibrants aromas of spicy/grapefruit like hops and honeyish malts, quite elegant actually. Taste is on the sweet ,honey malt side, but the vast hop conspracy isnt far from the surface and busrst through in all its juicy,fruity glory at the back of the mouth. Very good mouthfeel for style, thicker than usual but still well drinkable. Overall a really nice APA."
"Overall/notes: Hey, it's a nice APA, and it's refreshing to have a more laidback brew of Lagunitas. Given the comedic style of their bottles, I decided to watch The Good, the Bad, the Weird and you know, it was a fun film to have a drink to. Certainly worth trying, and grab more than one when you do!"
"Bottle no. 30876716. There is an attractive copper-yellow pour with a long-lasting, silky cream head about three-quarters of an inch thick. It never diminishes to below a quarter of an inch. The aroma is abundant with pine and floral hops. The body is creamy and in the medium range. The taste comes on strong with bitter hops, vaguely sweet malts, and a smooth finish. Something better than your typical pale ale."
"Pours golden / orange with a nice offwhite head. Aroma of floral hops, some citrus. Taste is bitter hops, some citrus notes. Palate is crisp, medium body with good cabonation. Finish bitter hops, followed by some light malts help to balance. Overall its a bit on the bitter side but still a nice brew."
"Light to medium body, easy drinker for a big hoppy ale."
"Overall, this is a very good beer... more than I thought it would be. In some ways, it doesn't quite measure up to the strong traits of the aforementioned beers, but that also works in its favour. It's a little more drinkable than the IPA, and, for some people, probably easier to drink than Hop Stoopid as well. It'd be a nice entry point to IPA's."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I was concerned about reviewing this since it was not as fresh as I would like but it really held up well. This seems like a borderline Pale Ale/India Pale Ale. I would rate it highly in either category. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"D: An excellent mouthfeel and taste combination makes drinking this beer very easy. Overall a well rounded beer adn a solid example of an APA."
"D - Super tasty beer, easily drinkable and another delicious treat from Lagunitas!"
"Drink well my friends"
"Loved every Lagunitas I have imbibed to date, haven't tried this one, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top yields a big malt backbone with a citrus and banana hoppiness. Pours into a tall tulip with a bright orangish yellow with a big head with big bubbles. Taste is, at first impression sweet, bitter and dry. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, carbonation is low and sufficient. Upon further tasting, this brew has a very tangy bitterness with a twang that has sweet malt in the background that finishes sweeter then drops off a cliff leaving a very dry flat bitterness. Great flavor variation, balanced but oscillating. Much sweeter in the malt department than most pale ales, but the hops kick in a finish well to leave a lasting impression. Another good Lagunitas selection."
"D: a pretty decent beer, maybe bitter to the point of imbalance, but drinkable nonetheless."
"D - dominated by citrus and hop flavours, somewhat refreshing although maybe a little too tart, another solid offering from Lagunitas, although I prefer their IPA offerings to this"
" ~ This is a solid pale ale and one I look forward to again in the future. The robust hop presence is really what I look for in a good pale ale. Once again, another good beer from Lagunitas."
"It's a good beer and you can drink it."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinker and a great value for the price (aren't all of Lagunitas' beers though?). Definitely will be back in my fridge again."
"Seriously killer pale ale. Poured with a nice, cream colored head with lots of lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is big citrus hop, malt, caramel, grain, fresh cut grass, earthy. Flavor is like aroma, thankfully only a hint of sweetness to offset the hop. Body is great, chewy, great carbonation. Finish is pretty long, like flavor and has a slow taper. No alcohol. Session if gone slow."
"D-Quite drinkable. Doesn't give you taste overload but still tastes delicious. One of my favorites from Lagunitas. Its a Pale Ale with more than enough balls to match up with most readily available IPAs in my area. Drinkability is off the charts."
"D-This beer has an extremely high level of drinkability.Easy and unassuming but pleasantly so."
"D: A very tasty and satisfying hoppy pale ale and a big improvement on the Dogtown Ale. The 6.4% ABV is masked nicely behind the sweet malt backbone and citrusy, aggressive hops, but its still a lil hot and boozy. Still, I'd likely pick this on up again. Good stuff."
"12oz bottle into a standard pint glass pours a crisp pale orange with a thin off-white head that diminishes to barely a thin layer. Aroma is crisp citrus hops and slight sweet malts. The taste is a nice amount of citrus hops balanced nicely by sweet malts that gives way to a nice bitter citrus finish. The beer is quite light, crisp and refreshing. This is a very good pale ale that toes the IPA line nicely but does not cross it like many others do."
"D - Not bad, not great."
"Medium body, ample carbonation. Well balanced and easy to drink. Pretty solid stuff."
"Lagunitas Brewing Company--Lagunitas Pale Ale--New DogTown--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.60% ABV. 35+IBU's? (3.5/ 5.0) No sediment. Mild lace foamy thin white head. Clear pretty bright gold color. Doughy mild floral Lagunitas Signature hop aroma front. Smooth mellow sweet cloying doughy butter caramel mild fruit body. Tangy mild hop spice clean dry citrus hint end. Very Lagunitas flavored. Tasty but not exceptional. Mildly quenching. Sampled 8/4/2010. 6-Pack $9.99."
"A cloudy golden amber color pour with a big,lasting fluffy white head , lots of lacing left behind , medium carbonation . Aroma of grapefruit , lemon zest , and toasty pale malt . Flavor is very citrusy up front with lotsd of grapefruit , lemon and floral hops followed by a good pale malt backbone for a nice balance , nice level of bitterness , medium body , smooth clean mouthfeel , long hoppy finish , very sessionable . One of the best Pale ales I have tried . Very good ."
"D: Not bad, it's a pleasant drink, but a little expensive for what it's worth here."
"Let me be clear, this is not a bad beer. However, it's similarity to the IPA makes me wonder why bother with the pale ale if I can get great hops in the IPA? It's realy not what I want in a pale ale especially when their IPA is so good."
"Cheers!!"
"Pours a clean golden color. Light to medium body. Hoppy bitterness followed by sourness and an assertive astringency and a woodiness that comes as a surprise. Was expecting a bit more, it seems like they are just trying to fill a category here. Not a terrible brew but not one that I would like to quaff very often."
"D: This beer is very refreshing and easy to drink."
"drinks really easy, a very nice session beer. i could see myself buying this again. this has the hop content of an ipa, but like i said thats not a problem for me, and i dont see it being a problem for most people on here. a good beer, 4s across the board."
"Bottom Line: A solid, but unusual APA."
"D: Goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick. This isn't a bowl you over APA but a solid one that is worth sitting with for a while."
"A good beer, but I think I would rather make a meal of it, rather than a night of it."
"Drinkability: This brand new Dogtown PA is nothing more than solid, simple, and adequately quaffable."
"Drinkability is decent, but it does leave you with a lot of resiny bitterness"
"T--Very complex and bitter. Beautiful. Bold, but not overly. Nice bite with a floral undertone and a hint of mint."
"pours a slightly cloudy orange yellow color with spare head and spare lacing. soft carbonation, light body and thin texture. hints of grapfruit very apparent in the smell and taste. slightly bitter, sweet and tart finish. long flavor duration. way better than i would've expected. very different and exciting to the palate. great brew i would definitely drink again."
"drinkability - amazing hop varieties used, did not expect this to be so delicious, really an amazing APA"
"Wow! Overcome with a fruity / pine odor upon cracking the cap. Definitely made me want to dive right in. A hazy orange-yellow with not much head to speak of. Decent lacing. Very delicate hop flavor and very easy to drink. This is my second Lagunitas brew and I think it's high time I investigate their other offerings soon."
"Cheers."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability? The mmms I'm saying after sips says it is very very good and drinkable. This is now one of my new favourites of the style."
"Overall, another winner. This will make a great summer session beer."
"D: A solid American Pale Ale. Good drinkability, the finish makes the beer all the more drinkable. Definitely would recommend this."
"D: Easy drinking, quite sessionable. This is one of the best APAs out there for certain."
"I liked the look of this dark golden ale in my new pint glass. It's medium- strong aroma of hops invited the first taste, which seemed to have a honey element to it. As the carbonated taste and the lacing descended into the bottom of the glass, I tasted blond malts and found that it was easy to drink."
"Good drinkability. This is a great pale ale, one of the best from California in my opinion."
"Taste is phenomenal. Way better than their ipa or maximus ipa. Rather than being overly bitter, they stuff a bunch of dry hopping I suspect, because this is so citrusy hop, but with a lighter body. Perfect. So drinkable. This is the standard for a pale ale."
"If you like your pale ales on the hoppier side then this one should please you."
"Edit: After having gotten this brew a couple more times, it is truly one of my very favorites of all time. So so so so so drinkable. Perfect for any season, at any time, especially in the summer. I'm very impressed. I'm still only 21, but I think this may be the beer that I purchase and drink most of in my lifetime. I am totally in love with this beer. I think its drinkability is absolutely through through the roof."
"D – An overcrowded style. A good brew. I usually get the great one, since it is probably available. This is a good beer."
"D - Very drinkable. I think I will definitely pick up some more of these when it gets warmer."
"D-I could drink this year around. Would love one in the spring for sure."
"Brew poured to a slightly cloudy off golden color with a good sized white frothy head that had good retention and left quite a bit of lacing. Aroma here is very nice as the citrus hop aroma really comes out, gives a juicy like aroma. Sweetness in the nose comes through and goes together well. The flavors of this one are very good as well, citrus hops hit you the hardest and the flavors of them are excellent. Malts seem to give a slight caramel flavor, also maybe toasted malts? Perhaps just a touch to sweet, but that would be the only thing that I can say might be a retractor. In my opinion this is a well rounded and very tasty beer. Nice Lagunitas offering."
"Until recently, my experiences with Lagunitas have been few and far between. Lately, however, I've had many of their beers and am finding them all quite delicious. I'll have to see what else of theirs I can acquire, because I'm betting whatever it is will be good."
"D: Yeah, it's friggin' good. Have not been let down by this brewery yet."
"I cant wait to try fuzzy eyeball!"
"drinkability: solid pale ale, perfect session"
"I would buy a ton of this if it were as available to me as I would like. Balanced, with tons of hop flavor this one reminds me of a Slam Light. Awesome."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a nice sessionable beer with flavor and substance that make it worth drinking for a long time."
"Hopheads will have little to complain about regarding this brew."
"D: Definitely on the maltier end of the pale ale spectrum, and quite flavorful. I would call this an English Pale Ale rather than an American, but either way, still works. I think that with some extra hopping, this would make a wonderful IPA."
"More citrus and hops on the palate. The mouthfeel is sturdy if not a little oily. This beer is a little rough around the edges. It could use some malt balance. Given those criticisms, it is still an enjoyable, drinkable ale."
"Golden-bodied beer with a good offwhite head that leaves sheath lacing down the glass. Has an herbal and bitter hoppy smell that is light, a little juicy, with some minor malts. Medium-bodied and smooth, his beer has a sweetness from piney, grape hops and some caramel malt as well. Balanced just right, finishes with a light herbal dryness that is perfect complement to this beer. Solid."
"I couldn't taste or feel the alcohol in this but that's probably because I was concentrating on getting it down before the taste could settle in. To me, this wasn't so bad as much as it seemed to be a runner-up to the west coast counterparts that this emulated. Not a poor choice but there are a lot of better offerings in this category and without a doubt, make sure you have something to eat on hand to help get this down!"
"D: A smooth to bitter Pale Ale. I've had better, but not many. Will certainly have this again. This quest continues for the perfect APA! Recommend."
"Light bodied but somewhat firm, with a lingering bitter but fruity finish. Very enjoyable, and the best American pale ale I've had to date."
"Not the tip-top, but flavorful, sessionable, and respectable."
"I had this one on tap a few weeks ago at the Toronado in San Francisco on tap which tasted much better than the bottled version. The tap version (to me) had much more of an oily, hoppy flavor to it, it was amazing. The bottled version was good but nowhere even close to the flavor that came off the tap. I've experienced the same thing with several of the hoppier Lagunitas brews. It makes me wonder if they might put some whole hop cones in the actual keg. This beer is definitely worth a try and not overbearing with hop flavor. Definitely leans more towards hops than malts, not at all balanced, but darn tastey, just how I like my ales! Had this been the tap version I was trying, the score would have been higher."
"Poured into a footed pilsner glass (I know, wrong glassware. I was drinking from the cleanest glass in my house...). A beautiful white frothy head, about an inch tall. It subsides into some nice, lasting lacing. The beer itself is deep copper and absolutley gorgeous. Smells piney, plenty of hops in this one! The taste itself is floral and piney with a bit of citrus at the end. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the pleasant, refreshing carbonation compensates nicely. Very drinkable, crisp and refreshing. A very nice example of a tasty American Pale Ale."
"D- This is an excellent offering by Lagunitas. Strangely reminiscent of Russian River's IPAs"
"Drinks very easy, great sessionability, wish I was a bit more in love with the hop mix..."
"A warm golden color with a dense head of white foam that lasted forever supported by a strong carbonation. Lots of citrus in the aroma highlighting a bouquet of clean, fresh hops with a hint of malt holding it together. The hops are almost overpowering at first but fade quickly and leave a biscuity, malt center that finishes softly with a dry, pine and grapefruit on the finish. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy and quite enjoyable all around. I'd say this beer is good but a little bit out of balance as far as the flavor goes. The interplay between malt and hop was less than seamless but in general it was worth drinking though Lagunitas has made better beers along the same lines as this one."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has more of an English style pale ale scent. It boasts of pale and bisquit malts along with a more noble hop based aroma. The taste is decent. It has a turbulant balance of malt and hops. It's got the pale and bisquity flavor, but with citrus hops in the finish. The two don't mix well together. There is a bready sweetness along with a rich mouthfeel. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent APA, but I was expecting better from these guys."
"one of the best lagunitas i've had"
"I empty the glass quickly, and I am saddened that I only have two more bottles left sitting in the fridge. Fortunately, I know where they sell more. This time, I think I'll buy more than a sixer so that I can't forget that this beer belongs in a regular rotation."
"This Pale Ale is much smoother than the spicy Sierra Nevada and will show the consumer why Lagunitas is one of the best breweries around....imo."
"D- I could drink these all night! I highly suggest this one for any beer lover. Hop heads and non hop heads, be warned, this beer might convert you to the hop heads universe!"
"medium bodied with nice balance,this is an easy drinker.gonna have to be my standby pale ale now that i'm not within driving distance of alpha king."
"Fairly clear caramel color. Small, lacy head. Love the aroma, but it gets my hopes up a bit more than the flavor delivers. Still a great beer however. I've been thoroughly pleased with all of Lagunitas' products thus far. Could drink quite a few of these with no regrets."
"D - This one is reminiscent of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It is really one of the hoppiest and best ones around."
"Mouthfeel as expected, not thin at all. Very drinkable for so hoppy a beer. Sometimes a beer this hoppy coats the tongue and makes for an undrinkable affair, but not so with the New DogTown. A great example of a West Coast IPA!"
"D= very drinkable if you greatly enjoy up-front bitter citrus-floral hops. It makes a nice break during a session of their IPA."
"A good example of am American pale- quality beer for the style. If you like a hoppy pale, you'll find this drinkable. I enjoy the 12 oz and move on."
"Pours a light, pale transparent brew. Citrus and hop oils in the nose. Spices, hop resin, dryness, and the usual Lagunitas oily aftertaste. Light in body, dryness turns to slickness. It's what I come to expect from Lagunitas: a well-rounded pale ale full of slick citrus West Coast hops."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, possibly the best pale ale I have had"
"You can find a sixer of this brew in my fridge often, particularly during the summer."
"D: Just on a role with good beers today, a very impressive APA out of Lagunitas, one to put into the rotation."
"Always love getting my hands on some new Lagunitas stuff.Poured into a nonic a dull light to medium golend with a thinner but well retained white head.Great aromas the hop profile really stricks out,pine with citric notes mixed with a lightly sweet caramel/biscuit malt base.The flavors dont hit home as much as I ecpected,the caramel malt notes show thru upfront with the citric,piney hop notes finishing but its a little lighter than expected.Mouthfeel is a tad thin but the beer is quaffable."
"Definitely in the luscious no-mans' land between an APA and a West Coast IPA. I found it went down very quickly, maybe because I was trying to determine which way it was leaning for each quaff, but mostly, it just tastes great. The only drawback, which I guess is locale-specific? 20 bucks for a sixer on this side of the 49th."
"D: A really solid APA. Not the best in the world, but pretty damn good. At $6.99 definitely worth the price. I'll buy it again."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink."
"Drinkability: This is an awesome pale ale. It is very drinkable, and I could easily do a six pack of them. Worth seeking out."
"pours a clear copper color with a good head and lacing..the smell is hops and malt some citrus some peat smells and spice and grass smells..the taste is the same it hits you with spice/hops and some grass and grapefruit it finishes with some sweet malts its all good but not great the mouthfeel is the same it s drinkable and good but to much ipa ,pale ales out there to really bother with this one..try it is my recommendation"
"Flavor is crisp, clean, refreshing, and--above all--hoppy. Very impressive for a hop-forward Lagunitas beer, as I usually find the malt base to be hit or miss. With New Dogtown, the pale malts are clean and slightly bready with a mineral finish, while the hops lay down a solid flavor profile of citrus and pine. Not too bitter, either, just the right amount of IBU's to provide the finish with a lingering smack of hops. Very solid Pale Ale, and one I'll probably be revisiting soon this summer."
"Pours a beautiful golden light amber with a small head that leaves nice lacing. Smells like citrus hops, nothing too crazy. But drinking it is a world of fun - it's like a big glass of grapefruit juice in your kisser. Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit. So clean and tasty. It's actually not really like drinking a beer at all -- but in a good way. An unusual and very appealing beverage. Now that good weather's here I have to have this in fridge at all times."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Poured into a pint glass. Clear dark gold color with a nice, lasting white head. Aroma is unripe citrus and pine needles. Flavor is pale malty without much sweetness, with a huge hoppy dominance. Citrus rind, hop resin, and pine with a nice medium bitterness. Like a beefier SNPA. Refreshing body and carbonation. A very solid pale ale."
"D) A well crafted pale ale. I could many more of these!"
"D - Great for the style, very good pale ale overall."
"Pretty darn drinkable. Good for a day in the yard."
"D - heck yeah, this is a damn good beer."
"Pours a clear amber with a thin creme head. Nose is pungent floral spiced hops. Citrus tones are on there as well. Flavor is bringing a higer aciditiy with salty citrus toned hop characteristics. Feel has a boisterous carbonation and a good liquid body. This is definitely an American Pale Ale. Higher acidity and higher IBUs than an English version."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: This beer is very easy to drink. Not to heavy with lots of flavor. Might be my new go-to Pale Ale. I cant wait to drink this beer on a nice warm summer night"
"D: Drinks like an IPA, in the sense that it's heavy on the hops. Not as well balanced as other APAs, but definitely worth picking up a 6er. Another good brew by Lagunitas!"
"D: Another great Lagunitas offering. While they aren't all home runs, many are excellent, and the value has no consistent competitor. New Dogtown Pale Ale is an improvement over the previous, good version with a unique overall flavor and aroma profile."
"Decent carbonation and fairly drinkable. Overall a good beer worth trying."
"D: just a very solid pale ale, plain and simple"
"Highly recommended..."
"Overall- Light crisp and easily sessionable. 1 of my new goto Pale Ales."
"Great beer, I like more than their IPA to be honest."
"A slightly larger than one finger tan head sits atop a dark golden brew with some medium sized bubbles jetting to the top. Retention is ok, and a thin sheet of lace is left behind. Smells of sweet malts which are enveloped by the hops. A bit of mustiness floats in there as well. Tastes oily and hoppy with a bit of earthiness and spice in the background. This is not a bad pale ale at all. It's medium bodied and fairly tasty, and would work well on a warm day when you don't want anything too heavy, but you need a slight hop kick to keep things interesting."
"Considering it is Lagunitas, I am surprised at how heavily malted this beer is. A nicely balanced beer. Hops are still in abundance and have a citrusy and grassy flavor. Very fresh and delicious....I dig this beer. It will sate a hop craving and still maintain a high level of drinkability. Another high quality brew from Lagunitas. Definitely recommended."
"Great sessionable hoppy beer."
"Overall: I think this beer is a super duper APA. Perhaps a bit bitter for newbies (overhoppy), but if you can take SNPA, this is great stuff."
"Possibly the best smelling beer in existence. This IPA like pale is a light amber, head retention and lacing differs from batch to batch but usually is more than acceptable. Incredibly inviting piney aroma makes you think this is a hoppy bomb IPA. Taste is similar to the aroma, a blast on piney bliss. Excellent beer from this brewery that once was just O.K. in my book and now they are one of my favorites. Good stuff."
"D - It is unbalanced which makes it hard to enjoy. Hops need to be mellowed out a bit."
"Nice! Lots of American hop flavor and an extremely good drinkibility make this a winner of an APA in my book! I could session this easy."
"Poured light copper and with a decent head. Smell is light hops and malt. First taste I was very impressed for an APA. Excellent hop taste, one of the few times (being a hop lover) I felt the brewer nailed it with a perfect hop/malt balance. The thing I really liked about this brew is it has it's hops but it's not overboard or too hoppy. You could have several of these and not fry your buds."
"Overall this is one of the best valued APA's you can find. Solid!!"
"I was pleasantly surprised by Lagunitas New Dogtown Pale Ale and will return to this brew again in the future."
"I have enjoyed every Lagunitas product thus far and this one is very good as well."
"D: My hat's off to Lagunitas! This pale ale runs circles around their ipa. A definate winner. I'm going to pick up more whenever I see it!"
"I really enjoyed this one, and will definitely purchase again. Cheers!"
