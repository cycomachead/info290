"This American PA is in the Classic British style and is very well done.  Highly recommended.  Drinking it makes me really appreciate and respect the brewers' efforts to protect the watershed."
""
""
""
""
"Good one! A clean and lightly hopped APA"
""
""
"The fresh water that they brag is retrieved just a dozen miles away really does seem to make all the difference. Not very aromatic but very crisp and fresh tasting with hops that are very not overwhelming. Very drinkable"
""
""
""
"I want to love this beer, and feel like I should given the brewer and the hop bill, but it just doesn't hit the spot for me. Solid, but average beer. This is a legitimate APA though, and I feel like some other higher rated ones have clearly crossed into the IPA category."

"O: good hoppy beer to drink with food"

"Overall - I'm interested enough to try another bottle on another day. If you inhale while sipping, you'll get a very strong grapefruit aroma which carries over in the taste. Overall I like the Prima Pils more."
"The feel of this beer is light bodied with a really smooth finish. There is a pleasant drinkability that helps this beer go down easy."
"Overall: a very easy to quaff pale ale that has a nice flavor profile and is satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good pale ale. Has that west coast citrusy feel."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 12 oz beer into a standard pint glass.  BB date of 3/2015.  Deep clear coppery golden color with one-finger head that dissipated fairly quickly.  Medium lacing.  Nose is predominantly earthy piney hops with minor touch of citrus.  Taste is assertively hoppy with nice lighter maltiness in the background.  Decent bitterness dries the palate at the finish.  Great example of an APA and, frankly, has a bit of IPA profile to it.  If you like hops, you will like this."
""
""
"This is the downfall of their large expansion last year. Product quality and availibilty suffers. You as the customer pay the same, or more for an inferior product."

"Enjoyed from a 12 oz bottle.  Pours a bright amber with moderate white head and light lacing.  Nose of citrus and pine hops with a light malt background.  Flavors of hops to the front and aftertaste.  Citrus hops meld nicely with sweet caramel malts with bittering hops in the background.  Decent session pale ale."

"Great light crisp body, little bit of vienna like malt comes through, biscuity and dry with an outstanding hop character that shines through, super citric and fruity with just enough bitterness to balance. American pale ale at it's best"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep clear gold with a clingy white head. As it settles, is leaves sticky lacing. Nice aroma, mild, but with discernible malt and citrus hops. Earthy hops are dominant, with some backing effort from the citrus hops and the malt backbone. The body is lighter with a little bite from the hops.  A really good American Pale Ale."

"O: A good smooth drinking beer.  Drank on Turkey Creek Road, Clyde the first night of our arrival June 14, 2014.  A solid brew by a great company."

"Overall a decent APA. Not too hoppy but tastes good and easy to drink. Would have it again and easy to drink a few of."
""
""
""
""
"This ale is a one-of-a-kind. Wonderful! Haven't yet tried anything that is close to it. You've got to try it - it defies description.  But you definitely have to like dry…very dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  A good beer with major flaws.  Hops mitigate the lightness somewhat, though.  3.75/5.00"
""
"Bright orange gold with a head that starts nice and thick then settles to a fine layer of bubbles.  The smell is clean citrus hops with a strong malt backbone that is primarily bread and biscuit.  The hops come right out front in the taste.  Hop flavor seems to be a mix of grapefruit and more herbal grassy varieties.  The body is light to medium and relatively dry with a bitterness that falls off sharply inviting the next sip.  A highly sessionable beer not overly complicated but crisp and clean with a good shot of bitterness that is well balanced by the malts."
""
"A great example of what a pale ale should be.  Golden color, good hop aroma and a great balance between the hops and rich malt backbone.  Very refreshing.  Good carbonation level and smooth mouth feel with a sweet finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pale ale has hop bitterness in abundance but has little hop flavor.  Perhaps I’m being harsh for this is an otherwise very good pale ale.  The head retention and lacing are good, the nose is attractive, the palate is good – just the flavor is lacking.   Since the flavor is the most weighted, a lower final score occurs."

"From a bottle into a stemmed tulip. This is a local brew for me, one that I've come back to often as an after work beer. A beautiful IPA, clear amber body, soft head, top smells of grapefruit. Very hoppy in front slight malt aftertaste. Leaves a nice citrus hop taste overall. This is something that one could drink over and over as I have."

"Taste is a well balanced between malt and grassy hops, neither is overly strong to overshadow the other aspect but that also means there's no shining star, carbonation is decent with a slick mouthfeel, very easy drinking and sessionable."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of hops, some citrus. Taste is hoppy, bitter upfront, some citrus, pine as well, smooth and enjoyable. feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"Final Word: This one feels pretty self explanatory to me, given how few descriptors there are for the beer, as even the hop/bitterness lovers that I would recommend this to (and those are the only ones I would recommend it to) should still want something with more depth, complexity, and balance than this beer offers. The vicious carbonation, and overwhelming bitterness make for a brew that you have to brace yourself against before every sip, and even if it were in better balance, there are so few flavors present in the beer that it would still be underwhelming/bland. My hope is that the passing of time could benefit this beer by reining in the carbonation, and hop bitterness, creating a better balance. As it stands, I can only recommend this to someone craving an extremely bitter, piney tongue bruiser, and would recommend that all others find something else!"

"Nothing is overpowering in this beer. Smells good...but faint. Taste is there...but subtle . Great example of the style. The taste does not overpower your palette. Some breweries confuse the American pale ale and the India...Victory does not. Overall a good beer that satisfies during a hot afternoon."

"Overall, a very good pale ale and a really exceptional session beer.  This has been one of my go to session beers especially in the summer season, as it's fairly light and refreshing and goes down extremely smoothly while being very solid in the flavor department as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a pretty tasty brew, nice representation of the style."
""
""
"It's enjoyable and on the more bitter side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouhfeel: Pretty decent, but far from great. VERY biscuity which reminds me a lot of DF 60 Minute in that regard. I was a bit let down with this one. However, it's still very refreshing and a solid offering during the warm months."
""
""
""
"Really like this style, don't know if this one is a good representation. Smell has a hint of what wine people call ""pipi du chat", or cat piss. Didn't care for smell, but tastes much better. Really like this brewery, and most of its offerings, but this one falls a little flat for me. Will try on tap if given the chance, but won't buy in bottles again."

"Looked good in the glass. Really nice lacing. The smell leaned more toward bready malts, but there was definitely some caramel and a light citrus/piney hop presence. Taste followed the nose pretty closely. Sweet and bready with notes of citrus, pine and spice. Mouthfeel was medium and lightly drying."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a very clean, very light Pale Ale that has a nice hop profile of pine and herbal notes while delivering a light malt backdrop. The appearance is very light in its copper hue with a thin fizz for a head. The aromas are subtle with pine, floral notes and a touch of caramel. The flavor follows suit with a very clean light finish. This is a good example of a Pale Ale but does little to set itself apart."

"Overall- A decent and flavorful ale. Not super exciting but pretty basic. A good hop presence however. On the refrshing side too and easy drinking for a warm day. Also, hats off to Victory for advocating environmental stewardship and protecting waterways on the label on the bottle!"

"O: Very good example of the style. Not too bitter, not too over the top."

"Echoes of toasted barley malt return as the stronghold of bitterness starts to relinquish. Its refreshing and satisfying taste isn't as IPA-ish as many. Headwaters retains its caramel ""Pale"" roots but also modernizing them."

"Incredibly flavorful and interesting Pale Ale. Reviewed to style, this one is among the better pale ales I've had. Good complexity of hop aromas and flavors, balanced on the palate, yet also refreshingly easy to drink. Rivals the best of the new, trendy ""session IPA"" beers too, I would wager."
"O - Nails it for me on the APA style. Aggressively hopped and that is a good thing."

"On tap at Prime 16 in Orange. Pours a translucent amber color with a 1/4 inch of head. Good amount of lacing. Aroma is citrus and spicy hops. Slightly tropical with some biscuity malts. The taste is spicy hops with some orange peel and pine hints. Lots of hop flavor with a good amount of bitterness. Biscuit towards the end with more orange peel bitterness. Light mouthfeel with a fair amount of carbonation. This is one of the hoppier Pale Ales I've had. Overall, lots of flavor that's easy to drink. This Pale Ale is worth seeking out."

"Epilogue: It is probably unfair to force a reviewer to write a review longer than 250 words when a beer is this proudly simple."
"O: Overall I love this beer! It is super refreshing and light. I really would like to try this beer on tap."
""
""
"I like this. I like this a lot. As with Hop Devil, it doesn't smell as good as it tastes. A musty smell is forgotten the moment it hits your tongue. This was my favorite among the Victory taster pack I bought. I don't mean to draw a parallel, but it feels and tastes more like a wheat beer. Either way, I enjoyed the heck out of it."
"Clarity and the amber glow was exceptional. Carbonated perfectly. Dense tan head laced the glass and retention was there to the last ounce. Against the APA style this is way too hoppy, however, is more in line with an IPA standard. There is certainly a good amount of Citra Hops pushing an incredible citrusy aroma with some piney, lemony notes. The taste is the same as the aroma with a well balanced overall experience. Has a good level of bitterness, certainly more than present in APAs. This is the beer your want to have when an traditional IPA is to big but when you want all the nose and flavors. One of my favorites and is my go to beer when people like hoppy without the extreme bitterness."

"A tasty brew - goes down nicely. Looks alright, with a fantastic aroma/flavour of hops and sweet caramel malt. Decent body, though more effervescence would add texture. Reminds me somewhat of SNPA, which is a pretty good endorsement. Could happily drink a few of these. Worth sampling if you come across it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a classic in my book. I find that many pale ales - even the good ones - fall flat for me. I'll find myself saying that something's ""good for a pale."" This is a great beer. True to style, yet different enough to stand out and be known"

"Flavor is piney and a little bitter and still yeasty. Very lightly carbonated almost like a light beer but with a hoppy flavor. Not a complex beer at all and doesn't get better as it warms. But a simple solid version of a pale ale. Not my favorite frm victory but its a sessionable ale."
""
""

""

"UPDATE 11.11.13 Had another from the same sixpack, which seemed to lack the offending metallic tinge of the first. Still finding it rather undistinguished, but then by now I am spoiled by so many good brews. Reminded me somewhat of Sam Adams Vienna Lager, which is generally available for less money, although the Victory may have had a bit more hops presence than Sam's. Did not see much reason to upgrade my ratings enough to make a very significant difference."

"Got this sixer at Derk's Fillet & Vine in Montgomery Alabama. My goodness, Alabama has come a long way in the last few years. I'm seeing world class beers sitting beside some great local selections. There's not much else that I can add to the reviews that are not here already. Headwaters Pale Ale is delicious. It's malty and hoppy and the combination of flavors is great. A very nice pale pale ale for times an IPA may be too much. Will be buying again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall- we have a winner here. wish my local tavern had this one on tap. gives you exactly what you are looking for in a pale ale. not a mind blowingly great beer, but definitely one to put into your regular rotation. good hop flavor, yet with balance, and an abv that you can have more than one (or serveral) of."

"Overall: Tremendous balance in this beer; this is the kind of beer to settle down with while watching a football game - enjoyable but happy to stay in the background rather than be in your face with every sip"

""
""
""

"O- A very fresh and decently balanced ale. I love the simultaneous aromas and tastes of both malt and hop."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid APA. Nice hop flavor and balance with caramel and bready malts."
""
"This is one of the best pale ales you will have. It's refreshing, it's delicious, it's well made and you want to have it always in your refrigerator. It's confident and brisk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O--Excellent. Another example of a high quality craft brew from Victory. These guys just can't miss."
"O: A very well balanced American Pale. Too easy to drink. Shows more layers and complexity than the average APA."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"I was disappointed with this because I it's a Citra hop brew that does not compare to the Zombie."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Reddish brown with a one finger head. Gives off a strong smell, like bread and raisins. Very smooth at first. Light and refreshing on its way down. Bready yeast flavor come through. Aftertaste is different. Leaves a light fruity taste on the pallet. Yeasty feel clings to the back of the tongue. Overall, a pretty decent beer. It's more refreshing than most but lacks a complexity of flavor."
""
""
""
"Good summer choice if not overchilled. For me this is a strong preference over comparable Sierra Nevada PA which tends not to hold flavors quite as long. An excellent part of a mixed 12 (with Prima, HotDevil and Golden Monkey) that would work well in any season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good pale, nothing less then I would expect from Victory. Well priced at a little over 2 dollars for a single."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not one of the most balanced pale ales I've ever had, as the hop flavors dominate when fresh. The hop flavors are bright, clean, and refreshing though, and this beer is really drinkable- easy to put 3-4. Another winner from our friends at Victory."
""
""
""
""
"O - If I could find a 12-pack of this I would absolutely buy it again. I would love to drink this all afternoon. And evening. And night."
""
""
" Strong bitterness up front. Balanced towards the bitter, clean and crisp, refresing. Clean finish."
"For me, this is just a wonderful pale ale. It really separates itself with the fruitiness and pine. The sweetness compliments the beer extremely well. It’s a great balance, but tons of hops, and packs lots of flavor for a 5.1% beer. Very impressed with this pale ale and definitely something I’ll be going back to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer, not an outstanding one. A good refreshing pale ale with a good amount of flavor. Again, nothing outstanding, but it's a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A straight forward, hop driven beer. A darn good pale ale."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 6/23/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy rings of lacing cling down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, grass, light pine, bread, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of hop notes with a moderate malt balance. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, bread, light caramel, light pine, and floral earthiness. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, bread, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and good complexity of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, lightly sticky, and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice pale ale. Good balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"O - Really no complaints as this is a solid pale ale that has plenty of flavor. Another staple beer from Victory."

"at 5.1 % may bee a reasonable balance for a hoppy session beer."

"Overall: I like the direction this beer was trying to head in. Looks and smells great, but in the end, the hops overwhelm the malt body. Still good overall."

"Overall, I really need to try this bottled or on tap to gain a better gauge of the mouthfeel. It's tasting fantastic and is a solid pale ale."
"Here is a hazy, golden brew...thin white head. The aroma is of aggressive, piney hops and grain. Citrus and a pungent tree bark quality. Almost cheesy hops. Odd. The taste is moderately dry, sharp , bitter hops. Some companies may call this an IPA. Crisp, bitter, and clean. Full mouthfeel, firm body. Refreshing, and very enjoyable after an afternoon of hiking."
""
""
"Overall: Extremely interesting to say the least, and quite good. There is a nice dank flavor that evolves from the first sip to the last. A solid pale ale, I'll have to pick this up next time I see it."

"Overall - a great offering from Victory. Victory is a pretty underrated brewery in my opinion. I really enjoy all of their beers I have tried."

"O: a nice APA that leans to the hoppy side."

"Freshness date printed on bottle: Enjoy by June 23, 2013. Pale gold in color, about what you expect for the style. Nice head almost filled up the rest of the pint glass then shrank down to a thin layer leaving faint lacing. I thought I got more of a citrusy hop smell right when I opened the bottle, but after pouring it into the glass and taking a wiff I'm getting more of an earthy type smell thats hard to put my finger on but not as impressive. Taste is crisp an well balanced and leaves a little bitterness behind. Solid pale ale overall definataly a good example of the syle but nothing new or special here. At 9.99 a six pack there are couple pale ales right in the same price range that I would prefer."

"Taste/feel: Sweetness with the hops up front, that develops into more hops... and then more hops... and then finishes with the bitterness, with the flavor of caramel malts coming in to balance the hops. It's odd to me, because the hops seem sweet, and the malts seem bitter. Hey, I'm not complaining. The Citra (I believe they're Citra) hops, as usual, provide a very juicy quality to this beer, and the slight malty and spicy aftertaste on this beer makes it all the more satisfying. This is a great pale ale that has the bitterness of an IPA, but more overall qualities of an APA. Definitely a tasty pale ale worth seeking out. For the best flavor, I say take it out of the fridge five minutes before drinking it -- it's when it's at its best, I think."

"O - Great APA, Victory is somewhat overlooked, but this is a solid go-to beer, and should get more recognition. Refreshing and flavorful"
""
"Overall: My go-to shelf pale ale/session hoppy beer. Underrated in my opinion. If the label said ""Three Floyds"" instead of ""Victory"" this would be rated considerably higher."
"One of the best APAs available - an overlooked style in the days of ""bigger is better"" beer making."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a translucent orange with a small white head. Smells of citrus hops and slight flowery notes. Tastes of earthy and slight citrus taste from the hops a a nice malty body. Beer is light/medium bodied and carbonated well. Overall a very good beer."

"O - an extremely drinkable pale ale"
"Overall, Headwaters is like a more aromatic Sierra Nevada, which is a decidedly good thing. A great choice for a lighter offering that still packs a solid, hoppy bite. Despite being the ""baby"" of Victory's pale ale lineup, I think this is their most impressive."
"O - I think the prickly hops with lighter body are a little too much for my taste, seems like a sligthly watered down IPA, but still a good and interesting beer"

"12oz. bottle served in a willibecker. Pours a light, translucent copper with a one inch, frothy cream-colored head. Nose expresses Simcoe, an earthy/herbal quality, citrus notes and light, toasted malts. Head eventually disperses into a consistent, 1/8th inch cap with delicate spots and strands of lacing revealed in the wake. Taste consistent with nose, as well as the addition of a slight buttery flavor that cuts across the flavor profile and a light, noble hop bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive, slightly prickly carbonation and some citrus astringency. Overall, a very satisfying and tasty APA that would pair well with pub food and quite quaffable at 5.1%."

"12oz bottle. Orange color, great head, lots of lace up the sides of the pint glass. Aroma is very floral hops, perfume-like and reminiscent of the floral/perfume aspect I get from Sierra Nevada amped up to 10. Flavor is more of the same. Overall a solid pale ale but it is also sort of one-dimensional and becomes overwhelming."
""
"This is a good tasting beer. Another winner from Victory."

"More citrus hop character than anything, certainly more along the ipa line, if bitterness were more pronounced. Wish the flavor matched the aroma more closely."
"I liked this a tad better than HopDevil!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice, simple pale ale with a good bit of hops and the malts to back them up. Nothing to really write home about, but a good drinker nonetheless"
"O: Bam! Victory makes some great beers this one included. While some people arn't a fan of the catty character the newer aroma type hops provide I love them in combination with the old classics. The aroma of Headwaters puts this thing in the IPA cattegory for me despite what the label says, I would love to hear the grain/hop bill for this bad boy. Good show ol' chap, good show!"

"Just a really good pale ale. Will savor my other two in the Victory variety pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another great brew from Victory."
"The flavor is pretty strong for a pale ale. You get a lot of citrus hops with really minimal malt. This leads to some decent bitterness. This is a pretty good pale that tastes more like a single IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear amber with an average, frothy white to off-white head, medium retention with good lacing. Aroma is fragrant fruity, citrus, grapefruit, and pine hops and cereal malt with tropical fruity esters. Flavor is heavy hops and bitterness, supporting dry malt and fruity esters with a dry finish and a spicy character. Medium body and carbonation."
""
"Would definitely have scored 4.5 if fresh. I will seek this one out, an younger bro of Hop Devil. Certainly."
""
"Overall (4.0): Talk about crushable. This beer is so crisp and drinkable, it’s a perfect springtime beer—I can definitely see having a couple of these on the porch on a warm April evening in upstate NY. This is a great example of the style, and I will definitely be seeking it out again when I need something to shake me out of the winter doldrums and open me up to the crisp air of springtime. Good job, Victory."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark golden brown with great clarity. The smell is amazingly hoppy. I love the nose of this brew. Slight malt taste upfront and then a powerful mule kick of hops that is extremely citrus and very powerful. I love the hop character of this beer. The mouthfeel is average and the carbonation is too. If you have never had this I would recommend."
""
""
"o: pretty tasty, easy drinkin, glad i grabed a six pack."
""
""
""
"Overall actually caters more to an American IPA lover, than to somebody who's looking for a true pale ale, due to a strong hop presence throughout."
""
""

"This offering from Victory pours up a deep gold with a one finger white head, not much retention, but substantial lacing on the side of the tulip. The nose is floral, citrus, and pine. Taste is very sweet upfront followed by a bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is good with a bit of an aftertaste, though not completely unpleasant. Certainly a worthy offering. Not world class, but good stuff nonetheless."

"O- Easy drinking beer. Tasty and floral hops. I wish I took better notes on this one."
"4.0 D: Tasty, well rounded pale ale. Super drinkable and easily classified as an ""anytime beer."""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite new-ish APAs. Complex, strong (but not overbearing) hops. Interesting, complementary malt base. One of my favorite Victory Brews. This has a similar hop profile to Hop Wallop, but without the huge ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is very beer-like. It has the color of beer and has a foam that appears when poured. Smells good and tastes great - not sour or bitter or sweet. Ask me if I like it....yes, tons! Beer is about the circumstance - not the provenance. Not too much hops and not too dry. Well balanced."
"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a long lasting white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, orange marmalade caramel and biscuit malt. Body is medium and crisp. Citrusy, earthy hops dominate the palate while caramel and biscuit malt and ripe fruit provide support. Finish is long, grapefruity. Delicious brew."

"Medium bodied, restrained effervescence. A bit of biscuit comes into play well into the aftertaste. Dry finish. Not a bad beer but it definitely is off style, IMO, and that's what I'm supposed to be rating it on."
"A slight haze envelops the light orange beverage topped off with a tight off-white foam. Lacing clinging to the glass as the head retraces back down. Lemon rind hops propped up by a salty cracker, toasted malt foundation. Sweet wort also makes a brief appearance in the aroma along with a danker hop note. Firm light toasted bread malt along with a steady, persistent level of bitterness lending a nice balance to the beverage. Short pine needles on the back-end preceded by a touch of navel orange fruity. Medium bodied and modest carbonation. Overall a well-balanced beer with enough flavor on both sides of the hop-malt spectrum to keep me coming back for another taste."

"Toasted malt up front. Hop bitterness soon follows; very citrusy, with some marmalade, grapefruit, and spice. Caramel and fruit show up in the malty base. Drier in the finish, with lingering peppery, citrusy hop bitterness and traces of caramel malt. Moderate body with a smooth, easy feel. Very enjoyable and quite sessionable. Can't believe it took me so long to try this beer!"
""
"Overall: This is a really drinkable pale ale. Nothing to think about too much, but I enjoyed it enough."
""
""
""
""
"Bitter to some, but I prefer bitter presence. Somehow more of the fruit taste would make me love this even more, more of a tropical fruit profile such as that of Zombie Dust. But Victory hasn't disappointed me yet, and this is one worthy APA."
""
""
""
""
""

"Golden-orange pour into an imperial pint, clearish, with a solid layer of white head that leaves a bit of sticky lacing on the glass. Aroma is hop dominant, almost IPA-ish in nature, fresh citrus and lots of it, with notes of grass and pine, sweet biscuity malts in the background. Again in the taste, I felt this walks the border between APA and AIPA, lots of fresh citrusy hops, pithy and considerably bitter, with a touch of pine resin; maltiness is present but generally subdued. Medium body. Not nearly as smooth as some of your other APAs, but still quite drinkable."
""
"Mouthfeel: Crisp, easy drinking. Medium mouthfeel. Smooth carbonation. Balanced with a mild bitter hoppy finish."
"OVERALL: I have not always loved Victory, but most of what they have done has been pretty decent. This, however, is a hidden gem in their lineup. What an excellent option as a session beer. I could drink a few of these for sure."
""
""
"Pours a nice gold color in the glass and a good head. Lacing on the glass is present during consumption. This continues to challenge older traditions of pale ales and has a healthy dose of hops both in the nose and on the tongue. Hops tend to be more spices than citrus or pine. Good refreshing beer and could be used as a session."
""
"Overall: Delicious hoppy pale ale."
""
""
""
"This has a nice hoppy bite to it. Good spicy tones with a thorough bitter bite. It's nice. Real nice. I like it better than when I had it on-tap. Maybe it was the place I had it at. Either way, this is a good one, which is no less than I expect from Victory. Try it if ya got the chance."

"Poured into plastic cup while on vacation, so I don’t yet have proper rating for appearance, but looks like other pale ales…it was pale with white head. Moving on, the aroma on this beer was exceptional. Very bright notes of grapefruit and citrus with a hint of pine and some subdued malt. One of the better smelling pale ales I’ve had. Taste follows suit, very fresh hope profile and a crispness in the taste that reminds me less of pale ale and more of a pilsner. The creamy mouthfeel present in so many pale ales is not as evident here, but nevermind, since a great beer in its own right. Can’t wait to have again, really made a strong first impression."
""
""
"A very good pale ale by Victory with an enjoyable and well-balanced hop character. Almost sessionable at 5.1% which is good because I could drink several of these in one sitting."
"It is nice to see the APA out there still getting respect and at least this not like the run of the mill. Any one can ad hops and call it a pale but giving the beer that nice biscuit taste goes a long way in my book. This beer does it quiet well."
"I think the secret to its great taste is Victory's wet-milling process. It permits the barley husk to be removed from the kernel with less breakage. A more intact husk means less tannic bitterness imparted in the sweet wort. Not too many brewers do wet-milling because it is a slower process and takes more time than dry-milling."
""
""
"O-a good pale ale, nice session beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – I think it is a good beer, nothing spectacular though. Easy to get down. Victory is quality."
"I gotta say, this thing bleeds Simcoe. At first its cat pee (dont even yet), but then I get a bit of pineapple and lemons--enough to cancel out the flavors I dont like from Simcoe hops. Light bodied and slightly sweet. Theres enough malt and fruity hops to pull this thing through. Might be the best use of Simcoe Ive had yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty solid pale ale, not usually what I think of for Victory but this I could easily have again."
""
"Overall – It has a nice more bittering flavor and is quite easy to drink. Not bad, but not the best either."
"Overall (4/5): This is one tasty APA and another successful creation by Victory. Any experienced BA will appreciate this beer's easy-drinking nature and subtlety of flavors. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that likes hoppy beer but is looking for something lower in ABV and a bit more restrained."

"Poured a 3"" custard head with a pretty long life. The body is a clear golden yellow. It smells of grapefruity hops. The taste is far milder than the smell but the grapefruity hops are still there, and I guess that's what keeps this a Pale Ale instead of an IPA. There's a persistent long finish. And it's a very refreshing beer. Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a crystal clear gold with a large pale white head on top. Good lacing down the glass while drinking. Scents are citrus, fresh bread, and a little bit of grass. The taste has a big hops profile - strongly citrus, with bitter grapefruity hops coming through stronger than some IPAs I've had. There is still some semblance of balance though, with a malty sweetness coming through in the background. I would rate this near the top of its style. Another winner from Victory."
"O: A killer PA from Victory. Well done!"
"Mouthfeel is great- light to medium body, moderately carbonated, no sticky, resiny hop feeling. Great summer beer for sure."

"Pours a nice amber with a medium offwhite lasting head, with very good head retention and lacing to the end. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus, orange fruity esters fill the senses as well as some good citrus piney hops. Taste is caramel malt, fruity citrus notes, some yeast and citrus piney hops. Palate is a medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, fruity citrus flavor, some slight orange peel, ending with some good citrus piney hops bitterness for balance. Overall a very good, balanced and tasty solid all around Pale ale. enjoyed this"

"Overall a very drinkable, tasty and balanced pale ale. Solid entry by a great brewery. I like the barley notes but wouldnt mind a little more hop."
""
""
""
"Odd that I've had so many other Victory beers before trying their flagship offering. It's a very solid pale ale, enough so that it might compete with Great Divide DPA as my go-to choice if it was more readily available in Colorado."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice golden with amber hues. One finger plus head with good retention and nice lace. Aroma is of citrus, hops with notes of bread. Body is the lighter side of medium with some carbonation. Taste is a crisp well balanced treat. Nice grapefruit edge to the finish. Very nice."
""
""
""
"In general, a very nice looking beer. The aroma is not too bad, not too great either. The taste is for sure the best part of the beer, VERY drinkable but also VERY delicious. It's what a pale ale should taste like! Mouthfeel was oaky, nothing great but I can't really point out anything negative. Overall, this is a really good beer! I'd recommend it to any beer drinker looking for an overall good pale ale! This is what I come to expect out of victory brewery, nothing amazing, but if I'm looking for a good beer to drink, I will trust them to supply it."

""
""
"A deep golden color with a little of an amber hue to it with a white bubbly head. A fruity, floral, sweet aroma. Flavor wise this is quite malt forward and relatively sweet for an APA. First thing that hit me was the malts, the hops kicked in mid stream, grassy, floral, and a touch fruity, and they carried through into the finish. Mild and balanced bitterness. A medium plus body that is aided by the carbonation. A little heavier than the style dictates for my taste buds. Overall, a its a nice sessionable pale ale (surprisingly given the heavier mouthfeel). The more of it I drank, the more it grew on me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you are looking for a hoppy session beer, this is your choice....It pours light amber in a pint glass with a nice off-white head. PLenty of light delicious citrusy grapefruit hop zing with each sip balanced with malt, thanks to citra hops! This is plenty smooth, but not too smooth where the beer becomes forgottable. This is a great beer year-round, but really awesome for any get together for casual beer drinkers and beer geeks alike."
""
"Grapefruit and grassy malt aroma, smooth German malt flavor balanced with hops and alcohol. Mild beer, per style, yet richer and much more full-bodied. Quite malty without being too sweet. Very tasty, if not delicious, a crowd pleaser, unless your crowd are lupilin-crazed hop heads."
""
"cool environmental cause here. pours a orange blossom honey color with a fading white head. little bit of cloudiness. smells like citrus all the way, really pungent lemon/limey hops and just a touch of english feeling pale malt. flavor is less hoppy than the ipa nose indicates, but still a nice fruity character to the hops. really nice evolution in the mouth fruity hops first, then thick amber-esque malt flavor, then a nice bitter hops, delicate finish. feel is decent, body feels a little heavier than it should, and definitely heavier than it looks. it would be appropriate if the abv was a few percent higher, but its just a tiny bit out of balance there. overall a great beer for a great cause. hops are the star here, really nuanced flavors. yum"

"O: This pale really took me off guard. I had no idea it was going to be as good as it ended up being. It's bright, balanced and really drinkable. Nice work Victory."

The taste is a nice bitter, stinging hop taste with some citrus coming through, The mouth feel is nice well balanced and carbonated. Overall this is a great tasting beer."

"Just a touch of hops balance nicely with a substantial amount of malts. The hops are slightly bitter, but more citrus and piney than a sticky/bitter style. The malts are sweet, but not candy/sugary sweet. Very nice balance and a very clean smooth finish."

"O: Exactly what I think of when I hear ""APA"". Moderate flavors, hop forward, nice malt base, average ABV. I liked the piney and citurs hop balance and also enjoyed how there was just enough malt and a touch of sweetness to really balance everything. I would buy this beer again."

"This is an excellent beer. It is extremely clean, as noted with the comment opening up the notes about the nose. There really isn't anything to hide behind here. If the flavors and aromas aren't dead on with this beer then it will be very apparent that something is off. This is a great beer to reach for when you're looking for a hop fix but not the higher ABV of an IPA."

"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours a bright orange yellow, with a nice 1 inch white head, that leaves some nice lace. Smell is tangerine, grass, flowers, and pineapple. Taste is less pungent, with hints of grapefruit in the finish. Body is pretty standard, plenty of carbonation, on the drier side, and easy drinking. Little disappointed because the taste couldn't live up to the smell. Still a good pale ale, but the smell is outstanding."

"This offering from the folks at Victory is a very well made, drinkable beer. The beer pours a nice amber-copper color with a very lively cap of foam. The foam clings to the glass causing fractal-like patterns. The aroma is a heavy dose of citrus and and flower hops. The malt provides balance . Caramel and grain offset the dollop of citrus and flower bitterness at the end. A very nice addition to Victory's lineup."

"O: Hop Devil light. A moderate pale ale without the peppery bite of other hoppy Victory beers. Personally, that’s what attracts me to Victory beers is the assertive hop and alcohol presence. So, this beer comes across as middle of the road for them. I’m sure it opens their market up a little bit by having a less aggressive pale ale, however, there are better travel lane pale ales in my book – Troeg’s Pale Ale comes to mind."

"I had this beer on tap a few weeks ago and didn't care for it, there was a strong aftertaste I didn't like. I decided to give it a second chance and picked up a few bottles. I was pleasantly surprised, the potent aftertaste I first experienced was gone, it was replaced by a nice crisp clean finish. The one I had on tap a few weeks ago must have been from a bad batch, or it could have been the result of sampling five beers back to back."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. There is seemingly no alcohol inclusion. Easy drinking and well rounded, this is easily approachable. Hops are bold initially that luckily give way just a bit to let you enjoy the other aspects. Worth a try."

"D-I'm glad I got this in a mix-a-six; I'd be hard-pressed to buy another one of these."
""
"I think this nicely shows how a more subtle kind of beer can showcase so many flavors. Massively drinkable. Just pleasantly bitter with real hop flavors. Makes me think of their Summer Love. Another win for Victory."

"Clean floral hop aroma. Transparent straw/light amber in color with white head. Juicy and medium in body. Big grapefruit citric hop presence up front followed up by a balancing juiciness on the back end. Unique and well balanced. Flips the presence of the malts and hops. Slightly minty upon finish as well. I normally think pale ales all taste the same but this one shines amongst the crowd. Love it."
"O - This is a very nice easy drinking pale ale. In fact I would like to put a few more of these down. The hops are subtle but they start to come out after a few sips. Very nice."
"O- A nice, easy drink beer. Have had it on-tap a few times, it is a nice go to Pale Ale."
"Subtle, yet grand. Headwaters is Victorious."

"This is a solid pale ale but fell a little short of what I was anticipating. A very good floral and citrus scent that unfortunately failed to materialize in the taste. The body overall seemed light to me for some reason. The overall mouthfeel was clean and crisp. Not a bad pale ale at all but there are others that I prefer."
"Great balance in the flavors. Light earthiness but there's also a smoothness to the malt flavors. The hop shows up mid-sip and continues through the swallow. The bitterness is less complex but is perfectly appropriate for this style. The body is as to be expected with a slightly high level of carbonation. In short, this is a fine pale ale. In fact if I were to suggest one to give as the example of the American style, I would choose this one."
"T: Some good floral hop flavor upfront followed by some biscuity malt and a touch of breadiness and malt sweetness on the finish. There's nothing about this beer that blew me away, but it's a tasty pale ale and I'd definitely try it again."
"Overall this is a solid beer. Very easy to drink and good to just kick back and relax with."
"Overall, a very nice pale ale, understated malt backbone with a solid hop nose."
"I liked this one. Plenty of character, and plenty of tiny flavors that pop up as the palate clears. Worth a try and a revisit."
"Very easy sessionable brew. Not the best I've ever had, but in the mood for something a bit lighter with dinner it did the trick."
"Pours a clear copper body with two fingers of off-white head with decent retention. Aromas are largely biscuity, with leafy hops. Taste is very biscuity and toasty, with hops that are less earthy than those of an Oktoberfest but less fresh and vibrant than those of most pale ales. ""Leafy"" is the best word I can think of to describe its bitterness. Overall, well-balanced, pleasant to drink for many rounds."
"O - An enjoyable, crisp, and sessionable pale. Seems more refined than some of its APA brethren."
"ENJOYABLE, WORTH TRYING!"
"A very well-balanced pale ale that represents the class well. nice presence of hoppy aroma and flavors with a good malty backbone. Victory is a solid brewery that continues to impress."
"O- Very nice stuff. A pleasant drinker with a powerful hop punch without a ton of alcohol."
"This pale ale pours a clear golden color with a nice layer of foam giving off a big hoppy aroma. All the usual suspects (citrusy more than piney, and ever so floral) come together in a delicious combination. Another winner. I might just have a new favorite pale ale."
"Pretty solid. Goes well with all this chorizo I've ingested. :)"
"Back lit, the beer is a clear, straw gold with a lingering white head. Biscuity malt with an earthy spice for the nose. FruitA little research pulled up a note from Lew Bryson that it's Citra/Centennial hops as the American hops. Caramel and sweet on the tongue with a slight tang from the hop bite on the back of the tongue. Bitterness from the Citra lingers and builds further into the beer. I like the beer more as I go--better than the initial taste. Named for the local waters that supply the brewery, this is a good strong pale ale that is on par with all of Victory’s offerings."
"delicious. my new go-to pale ale."
"O: Victory's Headwaters Pale Ale is one of the better (albeit newer) entries into the APA style. If you like hop forward APA's, then I highly recommend checking this out when über-fresh, as the hops show significantly better. I foresee myself knocking off sixers of this stuff on the regs. Well done, Victory."
"Drink- Not as refreshing as I had hoped but still tasteful. A bit fuller than most pale ales and a tad darker and more layered."
"The beer pours a golden-orange color with a white head. The aroma is very hoppy for a pale ale. I get a lot of piney hops, as well as some resin and grass notes. There is also a little bit of cattyness in the hop aroma. The flavor is a little milder than the aroma. I get some resinous and grass-like hops, but they are balanced somewhat nicely by the biscuit malt. The bitterness is low, as expected in the style. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O- I like when pale ales use herbal hops but this one goes too far down that road. Interesting but probably a pass for me. Sadly, my least favorite beer Victory has put out so far."
"This is a well blended APA with a nice blend of hops and malt. The flavor profile is a little short lived and at times a little thin, but overall I found it really enjoyable."
"O- Well done Victory. I think I found a local replacement for all those sixers of SNPA I usually have in my fridge. Recommended. Cheers."
"A wonderful example of what a Pale Ale should be. I look forward to drink more....now."
"Ale pours a hazy orange and an inch head that laces down the pint glass. Aroma is pine and citrus, flavor is an assertive hop citrus flavor. Malt is more evident as the ale warms up a bit. The ale finishes a little on the watery side which is the only letdown. Overall it is a very refreshing, flavorful ale."
"O: I like Victory products a lot and this was no disappointment. I'll be getting this again."
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a frothy white head that fades fast. The aroma is inviting, more than I expected from a pale ale, nice hop aroma, citrus and grapefruit notes, subtle malt is there as well. The taste starts with a nice hop punch, bitter and citrus hit immediately. Subtle malt flavor mixes with the hops as it finishes with the bitter coming back, then has a nice citrus aftertaste. This one has a medium mouthfeel, somewhat smooth, with a nice balance of different flavors. Overall a good beer, nice flavor, crisp and well hopped."
"Overall maybe the best Pale Ale I've ever had. Probably will be my next homebrew project to clone this."
"O: Pretty good. Nothing to go out of your way for, but I'd have another if not much else was on offer."
"Overall a very nice pale ale... very refreshing and drinkable!!!"
" This is just a classic."
"O- a decent victory brew and i would purchase a sixer of this. A good beer for working outside with. A good beer to grill with as well."
"Headwaters poured a darker copper color, with a decent sized retaining head. There was a nice floral smell. The taste was slightly bitter, good floral notes from the hops were present. Nice to drink, easy to have more then one. Overall a very good APA, enjoyable, and drinkable."
"The beer appeared a nice orange/darker amber color with a nice bright white head that was decently retained, but faded into a very thin, uneven cap. Aroma was perhaps slightly more malty than hoppy, but some citrus hops were noticeable. Taste is good, well balanced with perhaps a slight edge to the citrus hops, but not much. The taste of the beer really did not linger too much in the mouth. Lighter feel with good carbonation. The beer was easy to drink, very refreshing, clean and crisp. Overall, a good beer from a great brewery."
"O- I would easily go through 6 of these in a night and enjoy every one. A lighter American Pale Ale with a very oily, sticky mouthfeel and a easygoing lemon and sweetmalt flavor."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the feel. While the carbonation came out on the higher side, with each sip there was a good cream, making this beer nice and satisfying. This beer was good for the style, but the flavoring could have stood to be more pronounced."
"O- A pretty solid APA. With the prices on Victory 6 packs, it won't be a common buy for me, but I'm not going to have any problem finishing the 6."
"Overall: Refreshing, hoppy, earthy, not too malty, great hoppy pale ale. The tar characteristic from the hops is something you should be in the mood for, but goes extremely well with certain foods such as BBQ ribs. This beer plays with BBQ sauce so well! Very fun to drink! Bartender...I'll take another!!!"
"Well balanced slight maltiness with a little hopiness from a sip. With the mouthful the hops are more pronounced and this pale ale starts to shine. It is what a pale ale should taste like, very drinkable."
"Still starts with that little bitterness, just right for a pale, and there still is some hop character beyond, but the malt just rides it out. Sadly, this bottle is a shell of its former self, but I know based on past experiences what this truly is. Bottle says enjoy by 9/12..shiit. Probably should've looked at that first before I bought em. Oh, well. Still a good beer."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Pours a semi-clear copper color with a slight head but not much of one leaving a little lacing in the middle of the glass. the scent smells great with its bitter hops and blend of grains and malts. The taste isn't anything new but it is great. It has just the right volume to it as well as flavors. There's just enough hops to make the beer great without going too far overboard. Some nice citrus and wheat hints as well. A very well made beer that I definetly suggest trying!"
"A lot of flavor from relatively low IBUs and low ABV. Why can't more brewers do this."
"Nice summer session beer."
"O - Pretty average all around. Yawn, yawn."
"This is one very hoppy PA without the stinging bitterness of an IPA. Very fruity so you can get your hop fix even if your not a real IPA fan or want to cool on the bitter finish. Looks great. nice head, the nose isn't anything special, but much better than say Hop devil which IMO smells funky. This one is all about the hops, and the only other similar PA I've has would be Burning River. One really well done PA that gives you a nice fruity hop lick without crossing over into IPA territory. Worth a shot by any beer lover."
"Light mouthfeel that is extremely easy to enjoy. This is definitely one of the best APAs I've ever had."
"A great, refreshing pale ale that goes down well in the summer months."
"A quality pale ale from Victory. They make good beer, this is a nice pale ale, hits the target of being very drinkable. A nice alternate to Sierra Nevada or Summit pale ales."
"O: Overall a nicely hopped pale that doesn’t forget its malt base. Nicely balanced, good drinkability, and one that is definitely six pack and repeat worthy, what’s not to like."
"Not a big hitter DIPA, but one very pleasant session pale ale one could drink all night!"
"Pours a beautiful dark amber with a pale tan head that has just a tinge of golden amber. Aroma is rather hoppy, almost more like an IPA than a regular ale, with a malty underpinning and a hint of citrus. Rich flavor has a nice balance of malt and hops with grassy, fruity and honey hints. This ale is very drinkable! Texture is smooth and quite pleasantly fizzy. Recommended."
"Well done & enjoyable pale ale...think I'll pour myself another. ;)"
"Pours a thick cottony white head. Body is very dark orange/amber color. For the abv and the style it looks exceptional. Smell is sweet grassy, earthy, pineapple, caramel malts. Very potent in the nose with all these pleasant smells. Nice clean hop bite upfront. Mellows out into a smooth caramel malt. Not as good as the smell but still leaps and bounds above a lot of pales. Taste is also grassy with a bit of grapefruit. Very oily and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall this is one the best Pale Ales I have ever had. Very clean and refreshing. Should be a real summertime crowd pleaser!"
"Is the new standard bearer as far as I'm concerned for the modern American Pale ale."
"comes out a nice shade of orange with a pure white head that has great retention and decent lacing. the nose is powerful and full of doughy malts with oily hops citrus and grapefruit. tongue picks up doughy malts again with a piny hop character to it. its pretty good but nothing too amazing. this is a light bodied brew with medium carbonation. not too much of a hop bite on this which is good. overall its a decent beer but nothing that i'd go out of my way to find."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Solid, quite bitter and hoppy for a pale ale."
"Overall: An ok pale ale. I could have a couple of these, but this one really does not stick out. If you love hops, try it, but I will pass on this one in the future"
"Overall impression: A definitively malt-driven American pale ale. Too malt forward to be truly American. Not enough malt character or English hop character to be English. Fits in the style space between American hoppy and English malt driven. Well done but nothing outstanding for me to want to try again."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a coarse texture that I really liked. Plenty of carbonation. This one is a keeper."
"Poured with a spare, off-white head, quickly gone. Clear, orange color. Subtle, hoppy aroma of orange and honey. Medium bitterness, mineral taste supported by toasted malt. Some sweetness behind the hops. Dry, lingering finish. Lighter-bodied, average carbonation. Well-balanced and drinkable. A good session beer."
"O. A decent pale ale, very drinkable, quite subtle. I could easily see myself drinking this all evening. Very tasty."
"O: Pretty drinkable Pale Ale. Not bad, but also not remarkable. I would probably buy this again because it goes toward a good cause and the beer is decent."
"Pours to a golden body with a thick white head that disappears rather quickly. The retention is very good, and has good lacing on the side of the beer. Has an earthy hops with a sweet malt in the nose. The taste starts out with some caramel malts followed by some floral, pine and citrus hops. It is a very crisp clean smooth creamy mouth feel to it that leaves the mouth slightly dry. A very smooth well made beer that has a great taste to it and one I can see myself enjoying for many years to come."
"O - I had one of these on cask a month or two ago and it was very good. Something tells me this one is from that same back, just much older. I still enjoyed it for what it was."
"O: Victory Headwaters strikes me as a decent pale ale whose overall score is hurt by a relatively harsh finish. I will probably revisit this beer, particularly if I find it on tap. "
"O/D-I have heard mixed reviews both on BA and by those I know who have tried it. I must say that I think Headwaters is a damn good Pale Ale. I only bought a single, but would not have been disappointed if I had bought a 6-pack. High drinkability. Hoppy enough to keep me interested but not too heavy, which makes this a great warm weather beer. I would absolutely love this beer in a can. Not your average APA. Worth a try? Yes."
"I've somehow not yet tried this pale from Victory. How'd that happen? It pours a clear straw-amber topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises dark greens, egg yolk, caramel, flowers, and light leek. Not sure where that egg-y smell's coming from, but it's not helping things at all. The taste holds notes of greens, flowers, toffee, leek, grass, and grapefruit rind. Everything tastes kinda dusty, kinda dirty... The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, I'm not sure what went wrong with this beer. It's still a few months before it's Best By date, it doesn't seem officially skunked...it's just not very good. Hm."
"If you love good hops, this American Pale Ale is for you. Highly recommended."
"O: I do not know what is going on with this beer. It is just wrong. It is well within the ""enjoy by"" date so it should be fresh enough not to be skunked. But the aroma was horrid while the flavor just wasn't much better. Really just not a very good beer and not one I enjoyed drinking."
"Mouthfeel is extremely crisp, like a quick spike. Doesn't leave a bitterness on the palate. A lemony flavor lasts few a few seconds. Light-bodied beer, great for hop-heads that don't want to spend a lot of money, and want a sessionable beer. Good job again, Victory."
"O - Very solid, drinkable pale ale. Really glad I tried it. This was the last one to go into my mixer 6er today."
"O - Of the APA's I've had, this one stands near the top. The style isn't one of my favorites, but this one is very solid."
"I was really excited when victory released this pale ale as its one of my favorite styles. the beer pours, looks, and smells nice, however, there is a funky aftertaste that I can't get around. I can understand that it might appeal to some but in the eastern pa/philly area there are some great Pale Ales being produced (troegs, yards, philly brewing, etc). while i'd still list victory as one of my favorite breweries this was a serious let down."
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is a copper color, with a thin, foamy head, white as snow. The aroma is wet, green hops and semisweet caramel malt. Flavors are roasted and toasted caramel sweet, with peppery hops and loads of cedar green characteristics. The aftertaste is syrupy sweet, with a bitter hops presence. The beer's finish is semi-dry and bitter. Very tasty."
"Pours copper with some foam that settles out. No lacing. Piney hoppy smell. Malty taste. Up front hop bite oily through the middle fades out. Smooth. Watery in a good way. Thin carbonation some grapefruit notes. Overall good beer."
"O- Very nice, easy going beer. This is a very good summer beer. Flavors aren't as bold, but very easy to drink. Low abv would allow to put down a few of these at once. Thanks Troy!"
"I think this is a nice mix between an American pale and English pale. Not sure if this is because I'm drinking it on cask, but it definitely seems to affect the overall experience!"
"O: very drinkable and with a relatively low ABV great for enjoying a few on a summer afternoon as I did"
"Taste, starts off good, carbonation, hops, mild sweet caramel malt, average bitterness. Swallow. Wait for it, ugh, what is that aftertaste in this? Slightly off flavor. Not horrible, just not pleasant like everything else about the beer. Its fresh, it still has 3 more months on it before the best by date, and the hopping is there. The only possible descriptor that came up was like, you know those biscuits that come in the pressurized metal containers that pop open when you depress a spoon on them? This had a like, stale, metallic bitter, biscuit aftertaste really ruined an otherwise pleasurable beer."
"D - Very quaffable... Very sessionable... A very easy going accessible American Pale Ale for most with just enough flavor and character to keep it interesting for beer geeks... Will gladly welcome into the beer fridge in the future, but not more than 6-pack form..."
"Taste is smooth with a citric finish and a light balancing bitterness. Finish is a bit tea like with citrus and flower notes, though a bit short and watery in the delivery, constraining the overall experience."
"Overall, highly drinkable. Victory celebrates its anniversary by going to the style that built the craft beer movement and makes a dandy."
"Drinkability/overall- overall i think this beer was extremely drinkable and the keyword here was balance , they managed to use to the right amount of hop ratio to malt and just perfect balance, this to me would make a great session beer that I will probably go to from time to time, just a beer i think a beer that is complex enough yet simple enough to make you want drink it through the night, good showing by victory for a solid pale ale"
"Amber color with nice carbonation. Rich hoppy aroma and light citrus and fruiy sneak through. Initial taste is smooth and hoppy like a mellow IPA and then your palet quickly clears. definitly a very unique pale ale. Great beer for warn spring or warm sunner day."
"Overall: Nicely drinkable and refreshing. It's a nice take on the style from Victory. Very clean and balanced."
"Well Victory has finally done it! They have created the NJ/NY Hop Lover's dream in a ""session"" style interms of alcohol level beer. Picked up a case of this as well as $1200 more of beer and wine for our annual sales meeting. As soon as I had one I knew I was headed back to my store hoping they had not sold the last case as I needed to have at least a case in my frig! Not a big fan of Victory but I LOVE this beer and plan to purchase/consume as long as it is for sale in Northern NJ!"
"This is a great beer and one of the few from Victory that I enjoy. Get it!"
"M: Balance is the key, equal parts hop and malt, bready and biting. A comfort beer. I'm glad that Victory finally listened to the masses."
"Poured from the bottle into my favorite pint. Frothy white head and nice lacing. Floral hops on the nose emanate from the clear bright liquid. Yum. The best way to describe this brew was Nugget Nectar Jr. Nice balance of strong flavor vs drinkability. Would definitely have again."
"Bright amber with a creamy white lacing. Sweet floral, herbal and fresh, with apple skins and fresh grain in the nose. Firm body, creamy mouthfeel, crisp carbonation. Citric hop bite up front with a mixed bag of floral, herbal and spicy notes, followed by a small dose of malt sweetness (cereal grains, biscuity, bready), and apple-y fruitiness rounds things out. Chalky, bicarbonate, and dry with sticky and spicy herbal flavors lingering on the palate. A very solid addi- tion to the Victory lineup. This will no doubt become a benchmark APA in years to come, if they keep it consistent."
"O: Very drinkable and would like another sadley have none to have."
"O: Overall this is a good beer but it could be better IMO if they pulled the reins back on the hops a bit."
"Very, very pretty. Smells nice. My first sip forced a double-take: am I drinking a beer, or am I munching on a bud of chronic? Seriously, you guys, this is delicious. Bitter and fresh. Nothing mind-bending, nothing revelatory, but for reals: I could drink a whole lot of them. I want to drink a whole lot of them. I'm sad I only bought two."
"O - Kind of a summer session beer for hop lovers, really drinkable crisp and clean. Really easy to drink, not bad"
"O - I liked this a great representation of the style of a pale ale and nice to see in Maine."
"Appearance is a hazy amber color with a good sized off-white head. The smell is quite nice with floral hops, some grapefruit. Headwaters` tastes fairly sweet for an APA, but it is done well, along with some hops and small amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and crisp. All in all, this is a good pale ale and a good choice for a leisurely spent afternoon."
"Having this on tap at amity hall and tagging for later review. Beautiful appearance copper base, puffy head that stays all over the brew, bubbles floating up... This is pale ale. Smell is indistinct, biscuits, bready malt, tiny touch of hops pine and citrus. Tastes good: bread, small grapefruit up front and in back, bit of grass in the front, refreshing. Pale ale taste. Good mouthfeel medium with good carbonation. Overall Ray drinker, interesting taste to repeat. I'd call it a success."
"This beer is best as a hoppy chug after doing something outside on a scorcher day."
"O- I actually like this much better than Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. Don't hate me, but I think the flavor of this beer is much, much better."
"Pours a very hazy orange color with a tiny head. The aroma is full of bright citrus and floral hops. Caramel malts also make themselves known. The taste is very bright, full of floral hops and citrus notes. The finish is really smooth and crisp, this is truly a delicious APA. The mouthfeel is nice, it's fairly light-bodied and has a medium level of carbonation. The drinkability is also very good. Overall, this is a solid, drinkable pale ale."
"O: A decent well-balanced pale ale. It’s been awhile since I’ve had a regular pale ale, since everything seems to be IPA’s these days. It was a nice change and a good beer."
"I might be crucified for saying this, but I like it more than Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale, and I stand by that statement 100%!"
"Nice drinking pale ale, definitely on the hoppy side of things."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer and it has a nice balance. Though there was a good off-gas when the bottle was opened…the carbonation was for my taste on this style. If that was fixed, this would be a different beer."
"Overall- Another quality offering from Victory. A very good pale ale. Definately not one of those APAs that are basically IPAs, so do not expect a hopbomb. Just a quality beer you can drink a six pack over the course of a night and not regret it in the morning."
"O - This isnt a bad example of an APA, just nothing to write home about. Enjoy a better APA for a better price."
"Poured a deep amber and presented a white, two finger head. Good retention throughout and left a cobweb-like lacing. The nose begins with hoppy floralness and settles to a toasty malt aroma with some spice. Taste was consistent with the smell, plus some citric elements. The spicy-toast malts in the nose makes a pleasant and balancing presence alongside the bitter hops. The brew felt crisp and refreshing on the palate. A light body finishing mildly bitter and dry. Overall it was balanced and refreshing. The nose and taste were pleasant, but wholly, just seemed rather average. However, as a session beer, it worked out quite nicely."
"I great session pale ale - put this stuff in casks please!!"
"So far I have turned three normal Macro beer drinker's into really loving this one and buying there own and for $34 a case.Very well worth it and a tremendous session ale."
"This is a great beer. At 5.1% ABV, you can drink a few and not get tanked, but it is still very flavorful, kinda reminds me of Stone Levitation in that respect. I would definitely recommend it and would like to buy it again."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful malt character that boasts of pale and biscuit malts along with a floral hop nose. It's refreshing, yet displays a good bit of complexity. The taste is good as well. It has a solid malt flavor that's easy drinking with a touch of biscuit malt character in the finish. It's smooth with only a moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a terrific APA. It's balanced and easy drinking; a fine session pale ale."
"a spicy apa with without that much accent but a distint mineral note. dry and consistent over time. amber with a mild toast quality. nose of protein and pine resin. hints of walnut and apple. palate of pine apple and a feel that has to open up to the bitter spicy mineral dryness."
"In any case, THIS beer is not bad. My biggest complaint is the finish has a note of alcohol (which is crazy because the ABV isn't that high?!). Perhaps another issue is that the carbonation is low for my taste... But still, not bad."
"Palate is a a nice dry and wet. Dry from the hard water flavor, and wet for the quenching finish. Not a bad session APA."
"All in all, a nice try at the style, but I think there are both better offerings in the APA market [Sierra Nevada, BR XP] and from Victory [Hop Devil, Golden Monkey]."
"A well crafted Pale Ale: balanced, flavorful, and drinkable. I would definitely recommend this Victory offering as a session Pale for the spring."
"M-Light and refreshing not thin and watery, which is how I sometimes perceive low ABV pale ales"
"Overall, tasty beer, I'd go back"
"O: Victory really packed a lot of flavor into such a low ABV beer. If I were to taste this one sight unseen, I would have tagged it as an IPA. Really good stuff... and I will be drinking more of it in the near future."
"This is one seriously drinkable APA and a fine addition to the victory line. It is one of those beers that is floating between an IPA and an APA, which is a sweet spot for me. I will surely seek out a six pack of this next time I am relaxing with some friends."
"Gold color in the glass. Slight citrus smell, most like subdued lemon zest. Clean, fresh taste with reasonable bitterness to the tongue. Lower ABV makes for great drinkability. American session beer. Great for summer if you're not into summer ales and kolschs. One of my new favorites for the style and great output for Penn brewery."
"Bang-on APA style, good citrus bitterness. Golden, good head, good hop aromas. A bitterness in the 60 range, years ago what would be called by many an IPA. Above average mouthfeel, satisfying. A bit of a palate shredder in bitterness, so not for everybody. Very flavourful; very drinkable."
"Pours a very clear light amber, rising bubbles, and a small layer of head. Citric hop nose, hints of lemon and pine, a touch of honey or caramel. Nice balanced flavor. More malt then expected, hearty bread flavor plays well with the sweet fruityness of the hops. Smooth texture and nice body. Really nothing wrong at all with this beer - it's just not super interesting. A decent sessionable pale."
"Clear copper-yellow pour with quickly fading one finger head and minimal lacing. Floral, piney, citrusy, fresh hop nose with a hint of biscuity malt as well. The citrusy hops dominate the taste with hints of tangerine, orange zest and grapefruit with just enough sweetness from the malt to balance out the hoppy bitterness. It has that signature Victory taste that I love so much with HopDevil and Hop Wallop, but it comes up just a little bit short for me. Nice crisp, dry finish, but there's a bit of a squashy aftertaste that I'm not fond of. I think maybe I just expected too much. It's a decent, solid pale ale though that I will definitely drink again."
"O- I would almost buy this as a session beer. Man up and knock some of these back because they are delicious."
"Soft sweet malt, grassy hop, light lingering bitterness. Very simple and understated malt character. Hops come across as slighty spicy and floral. Light carbonation, easy drinking. A bit simple with no real flaws, slightly sweet for my taste personally. Still it's a quality offering, like the majority of Victory's output. Good craft transiton beer."
"Cheers!"
"O: Goes down easily, quite tasty, not too filling, mild kick, nice representation of style. This is a nice beer to sit with for an evening - and that's just what I'm doing."
"Flavorful and well done, nice job Victory, It’s not going to replace Hopback as my favorite session beer, but I might rotate back and forth between them every couple of trips out to the bar."
"On tap at a small pub in western Mass. This is a very clear and filtered beer, light copper color with a few fingers of foam. There's some light citrus on the nose, with a grain base behind it. And it tastes just how it smells, a touch of citrus with a pale malt backbone, in other words a very approachable pale ale. Light-medium carbonation, very drinkable. Recommended!"
"D- A nice hoppy pale ale that hits all the right marks for me. Love this one from victory. Might be my favorite."
"O: This is very much along the lines of how I like my pale ales. Nice hoppy character without being overly bitter or malty."
"O: A hop-centric, sessionable APA at 5.1% ABV that would have me picking up a sixer for grilling picnic or summer party if there were not a lot of interesting alternatives. Quite serviceable with my avocado turkey burger and just fine on its own."
"D: definitely a super drinkable APA. more on the session side than APA side in my opinion. a good beer from victory but not my favorite."
"Good light body with ample carbonation. Overall, a terrific offering here. Really hits the mark on a pale ale in my opinion."
"o - sometimes a really strong IPA is to overwhelming to separate the hop flavor from the rest of it. this beer leaves room to enjoy that, and thats why i like it."
"O - To me this pale ale is a tug of war between the hops and the malts... The malts come out of the gate strong and then the hops beat them down and leave a lingering bitterness on the palate to remind you who's boss."
"Nice bronze color with an off white soap suds head. Sticky lace trails for the entire glass. Smell of floral hops with citrus notes. Taste follows suit. Nice caramel malt backbone. Solid medium bodyFinish is nice and clean. A nice new offering from victory. Good session beer and a nice summer lighter good beer."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this beer nicely drinkable, with each sip following the last quite easily. When the beer was finished I was looking forward to a second, and expect I’ll have this one on my shopping list for some years to come. My overall impression is of a well crafted Pale Ale that I could drink several of during an evening of conversations and socializing with friends and family."
"Nice easy drinking but hoppy beer. Pours a pale yellow with a slight orange tint and thin White carbonated head. Good retention. Hoppy aroma with notes of grapefruit. Moderately sweet/malt flavor with earthy, herbal hops. Balanced. Almost an IPA. Not bad."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent beer but there are others in the style that I would pick first."
"I could have easily had more than one in sitting since this is about a good a session beer as it gets. Normally, I don't consume this in the summer but I could see myself having a few of these on a nice warm day. This wasn't a hop bomb or has tons of resin and burning in the aftertaste. Rather, this is unassuming, nicely crafted, and clear as it appeared to be. Certainly worth a try for anyone who hasn't had this style of beer before!"
"Bottle. Enjoy by Aug 17, 2011 but no idea when it was bottled. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a clear, darker than expected copper orange color with a 2 finger antique white head of both large and small bubbles. The aroma is not overly fruity or piney but has subtle hints of orange and grapefruit rind. Medium mouthfeel. The taste is more subtle than I thought it would be with a light sweetness up front with a light/medium amount of citrus bitterness that quickly fades. Mild lingering bitterness. Some lace. Overall, not bad but I was hoping for a wee bit more of a pop in flavor from this."
"Overall: A nice, pleasant pale with a little bit of potency going on."
"STOP THE PRESSES>>>This beer is F'ing A....F'ing awesome! A very nice flavored yet subtle pale ale. Victory hit the mark for me! A wonderful tasting pale ale that does not linger nor leaves a brutle bitterness and super elevated ABV. The color was copper in color...the white was very thin and not a lot of lace. The nose was heavy with grapefruit with subtle pine. The taste absolutely followed suit...awesome balance! Mouthfeel was great....SESSION!!!"
"Meh, next time I'm having a reuben or sailor sandwich I'll look for one, but not really something I'd drink repeatedly"
"Poured into my pint glass a crystal clear golden color with a frothy head. A more than modest amount of carbonation. A lot of grassy hops in the aroma. Some very pale malt notes (Marris Otter?) Some light fruity characteristics pop out from a good hopping. Some mild grapefruits and orange. The taste has a solid hop character and once again is grassy but has a very dry finish. Crisp right up front but with a fruity, mostly citrus bite but is balanced with a solid pale malt body. Very drinkable beer with a light to medium body. Crisp and has a good balance of hops for 5.1% abv beer."
"Manages to be hoppy and light at the same time which is uncommon for many beers I try. I love hops and this one is chock full of them, but combined with a creamier mouthfeel and subtle sweetness that balances the beer out nicely. There is a pleasant bitterness to the aftertaste that makes me want to have another sip. All in all this was a good beer and pretty refreshing on a hot day. Reminds me of a hoppier SN Pale Ale, which is nothing but a great compliment. I'm coming to the conclusion that Victory and hops go hand in hand."
"There are a lot better APAs and IPAs coming out of Pennsylvania (Nugget Nectar, Hop Devil, Double Simcoe, et al) so I won't be returning to this one despite liking it. It's just the others are much better."
"Taste has more malt early in the sip, particularly when cold. No tropical fruitiness at all. Ends grassy and astringent; bitter. Finishes much more quickly, much more dryly."
"O: I find this to be an intensely drinkable beer. Reminds me of a good summers day. I grow tired of beers that are just liquid hops, but this has a nice balance of malts and hops. And the Aroma and flavor both rather remind me of a summers day."
"O: Overall this is a really solid pale ale that I'm glad I bought a six pack of. It's not one to write home about but I would gladly get it again."
"D- i really enjoyed this one. very hoppy for a pale ale and with an ABV that allows you to have more than two or three with out guaranteeing a crappy morning. this could give sierra nevada pale ale a run for its money. i wish it was year round. check it out."
"D: It is a well made pale ale and it should definitely be tried. However, the balance is a bit more hop forward and the finish becomes to dry for me to want to have several in a row."
"Had a bottle today that was graciously given to me by a friend. Poured into one of my favorite mugs. Dark orange color, with a slight head and lots of carbonation. Musty, earthy, grassy smell of hops. Flavor certainly had a great hop taste, but not as much as I was expecting from the nose. Subtle enough hops to notice, but well within range for the style. A slight bitter aftertaste on the palate at the end. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but easily drinkable for an APA. A decent beer, but nothing too outstanding. I'd call it a lawnmower beer for craft enthusiasts."
"The finish is probably the highlight of this beer, otherwise feels like a mixture of average/messy/slightly unpleasant."
"Victory Brewing is as constant as the north star. It's no surprise that their pale ale turned out as solid as everything else in their lineup. Its delicately floral, fruity hoppiness showcases that there is beauty in simplicity and that you don’t have to read Walden to find heaven in nature. This is definitely no ego-stroking anniversary beer - it's the kind of flavourful, characterful, quality brew this brewery made a name for themselves with."
"Great pale ale. It's a little like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but with pineyer hops."
"o: as a fan of ipa's, i think this really is a great beer. it's nothing too crazy, but far superior to something like sierra nevada."
"It definitely has a very pure fresh taste to it and I can tell they use really fresh water in this. I've had a bunch of Victory beers and this is absolutely one of my favorites. This almost reminds me of an IPA light By light I mean lighter body less alcohol less filling but definitely not lacking on the hops. What a fantastic beer."
"Straightforward finger of off-white foam, nothing unique about its retention, the lacing holds on in spots, transparent and spotless liquid of a red-tinged orange color, metallic sheen, very few bubbles to be seen, if any. During the pour a bodacious amount of pink grapefruit, orange citrus bursts forth, lively bitter hops keep you on your toes, some pine tar and earth, baguettes, salt and pepper, a pinch of bittersweet chocolate powder but not that malty, conversely the hops never use this opportunity to go for the jugular, quiet confidence leads to extended nostril presence and overall balance. Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation is made of tiny, scrubbing motions with little foam. Strong mineral water, quinine, metallic character which gives it a raw and rugged freshness. Sourdough and wheat bread notes, salted pretzel dough, dried lemon and white grapefruit pulp, green lawn grass, some pine. Carob and mocha but no real sweetness in any of the usual malt-derived flavors. Florality spreads enough to allow it to avoid astringency. The hoppiness suggests pineapple, nectarine or papaya but, again, lacks the sweetness to deliver on this. More interesting warmer, more satisfying colder. A tactful, almost patrician, quaff."
"Clear amber base w/ 2 finger of nice off white head. Smell is fresh hops and a touch of sweet bready malts. Taste initially is sweet and hoppy but finishes nice and dry. Overall a good brew. Reminds me of SN Pale Ale, but a little thinner. But with both brews, the first thing that comes to mind is clean and fresh..."
"O-A very nice APA that goes down very easy. This makes a really good lawnmower beer."
"Victory realy know what they are doing up there! Nice beer,Send more down south please!"
"A very standard APA, I'd prefer a bit more hop flavor. A good outside drinking beer during a bbq."
"Overall, a pretty solid pale ale. Not exactly my style, I find it a bit too bready and grainy for my taste, wheras I prefer mine a tad juicier, but I do find myself going back for another ocassionally. Pours a slightly hazy light orange with a very fine head that leaves some grainy looking lacing. Smells floral and grainy with a touch of meatiness. The taste is nicely balanced with some grain up front followed by some sspicy hops. Very dry, crisp and more crackery than bready. Well made and a bit different."
"O- Overall, I enjoyed this beer. It has everything I want in a Pale Ale. It is not going to knock your socks off, but it is a solid beer that is highly drinkable."
"I would recommend with pulled pork BBQ or any traditional cook out fair. Just as good out of the bottle as in a glass."
"D - Excellent, it is mild and balanced but very full flavored for the style. The hop aroma isn't so strong that one could mistake it for an IPA, but it is pungent and very enjoyable. This has to be the best APA that I have ever had, simply brilliant."
"Decidedly East Coast in its leanings, this beer is fresh enough to be thoroughly enjoyable. The combination of German malts and American hops is relatively unique, and this is very tastefully done. Pungent and bitter with grapefruit and citrus peel, there's a very nice balance of flavor as well with nice aromatics. The malt character is enjoyable, biscuit and toffee with a little caramel, all on a hearty but light on the palate base. Drying and bitter on the finish with some nice flavor hops, there's also a light sweetness that lingers, though the resiny hops do dominate. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is rather excellent."
"Medium bodied, higher carbonation, dry and tingly on the palate. Drinks smooth and easy, refreshing and pleasant especially for the season. A quality pale ale, definitely something I'd drink again."
"overall - not a bad pale ale. Not sure if it's one that i'd get again, but it is a very easy drinking pale ale."
"Overall I was very satisfied with this beer, and would have ordered a second had there not been so many other beers on draft at Melt."
"Had this one on tap at The Distillery in Rochester, NY. Glass arrived fresh pulled at a nice temp. Noticed the color right away at a reddish, copper. Next, the smell was very uplifting, and hoppy. Various floral, piney, fruity scents. Small head on it with descent lacing. Taste was very nice and rolled around the taste buds sweetly. Went weel with the pizza we ordered. Would def have again. It was on sale fro $3 a pint. Cant lose there for sure."
"Overall a great American pale ale. I was excited to see this on tap but I would really like to see it in bottles here soon."
"It's light bodied, with steady, percolating carbonation. It's an absolutely refreshingly quaffable, and with enough character to stay interesting throughout the session."
"Very nice drinker. An overall balanced beer that if it leans it does towards malt character. But it goes down well, light enough for a few. Seems like a lovely ale for the coming warmer weather. Seems like an outdoor beer."
"Overall - This is a nice, light Pale Ale. Definitely not world class by any means, but its pleasant and light for an easy drinker when in the mood for a mild style Pale Ale, with slight apricot flavorings."
"It has a nice hoppy taste with a nice finish. It has a slight bite, but is generally nicely balanced and pleasant. I would want to have this again."
"O- I took a shot on this beer, (i know im in the minority when i say this but) i cant stomach alot of Victory's beers, so it takes alot for me to plunge 12 bucks into their 6 packs. This beer may have changed the way i feel about this brewery. This was awesome start to finish, i cant put enough of this down my throat."
"Overall, a decent pale, but nothing I would want a lot of. Somewhat easy drinking. Average pale."
"Overall this is a very good pale ale from Victory. Nothing revolutionary or mind-blowing but a good sessionable Saturday day drinkin' and grillin' beer. Recommended indeed"
"Very crisp and refreshing. Another quality beverage from the fine people at Victory that will likely find it's way into my fridge regularly. I love a good sessionable beer..."
"O- I think this is a great APA and very drinkable. The flavor simple, approachable, but also well thought out- everything a great APA should be. Good job Victory, those who don't try this beer are missing out on a wonderful session beer."
"On tap at a beer festival poured into a sampler glass. From notes: Pours a deep golden with a small creamy white head. Aroma is balanced citric and piney hops with a very sweet honey and biscuity and caramel malt backbone. Flavor starts with the same sweet caramel and bready notes, picking up some light pine and citric hop notes before a smooth clean lightly bitter finish. Medium body and a sharp carbonation. A good pale ale, balanced and fresh, smooth and quaffable."
"O: a very nicely done apa and one which id buy again. Glad to see more lower abv quality beers."
"Overall - I thought it was a decent APA. But I'm not sure if I had a bad bottle or what, because there was just that faint trace of soapyness that became all I could think about when drinking."
"Taste is lightly hoppy but not killer, lightly grainy taste with a bit o caramel. Mouthfeel is sharp and creamy with a good bite on the end."
"O - Nice crisp pale ale with depth and complexity crammed into 5.1% abv. A welcomed, long overdue addition to Victory's year round lineup."
"Overall: I will likely buy this along with Prima Pils over the summer for some nice session drinking. It is light in the flavors so do not expect this to blow you out of the water but every beer has its place, this one will be a regular over the summer months given it becomes a little more available."
"D: Not a bad beer, and drinkable, but not really all that memorable."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, mellow pine hop and a small malt. In the taste, pine hops balanced with a mellow dry malt. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry pine to clean aftertaste. Nice hoppy pale, nice and easy."
"O - This is a nice little beer, if fresh. Easy to drink, a decent option, but nothing I will seek out. Then again, there is very little I actually seek out so that consideration is somewhat worthless."
"Pours a lightly hazed copper color, nice cap of khaki hand pumped head, decent retention and sticky lacing. Scent is a nice balanced combo of grapefruity, piney and grassy hops with a lightly sweet and nutty malt backbone. First sip brings stronger notes of hops then scent dictates, and the nutty and bready malt counterbalances it nicely, avoids being sweet. Good creamy cask body, smooth. A nice Pale ale that is big on both hops and malt."
"Yet another winner from Victory,they never cease to amaze me, and always fail to dissapoint me."
"O - 2011. Easy to drink. Too malty for my tastes. I'd rather have a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, a 21A Bitter American or even a Victory Summer Love when I want a sessionable ale."
"The market seems crowded with a lot of these hoppy,american style pale ales. The overall quality of this offering sets it apart from most. With the low ABV, this is very sessionable. And great thing about this product, you can always know you have a fresh bottle with ""enjoy by"" date clearly marked."
"This is quite a good beer, and another job well done from Victory. This offers just he right amount of flavor for the style without going overboard to escape its boundaries."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. Nice copper colored pour, 2 inch white head, sticks around for a while, nice lacing. The aroma is a mix of pine, grass and sweet citrus. The first sip has a nice grapefruit pop. There was also some sweet pine, the finish was mostly grapefruit and it lingered. The body was medium/light and it has average carbonation. One of the better APA's, just a step below daisy cutter."
"This beer pours a clear deep copper color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of freshly cut grass with a hint of grapefruit. It is a rather strong aroma. The taste is a nice balance of citrus and grass. Bitterness is firm without being overpowering. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a silky texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is one of the best American Pale Ales I've had in a very long time. It has nice complexity. I can see this beer becoming a regular for me."
"O - This started off as a hoppy APA but it showed to be very balanced...Victory did a nice job with this beer...I could session with this and not have a problem...happy anniversary Victory"
"D: This is a very good pale ale from Victory. A big, interesting hop profile is joined by a persistent malt backbone - all wrapped into a neat little pale ale. It's hoppier than some IPAs, but it manages to fit well within the style. Definitely recommended."
"Dr. Goes down easy."
"This is another very nice offering from Victory, who never disappoints."
"O: This is a nice flavorful pale ale and is very well balanced. The drinkability is great. Based on the description, I was hoping for a bigger impact from the Citra hops."
"O It was a dissapointment to me. After smelling the beer I so wanted to drink but after my first swallow and I got the rind taste it was all down hill after that."
"M/D - It took me a minute to figure out what it was about this beer that was giving me mixed readings. Despite all the flavor described above I still felt like it was almost watery. To me I think it's way under carbonated. Aside from that issue it's a great beer but it does affect it's drinkability."
"A very drinakble beer which is smooth and light medium bodied. I would definitely recommend trying this beer. This beer could definitely replace one of my everyday beers."
"Well done Victory! A really nice pale ale. Pours a deep copper with good head and lacing. Smells nice with good hop presence. Taste is more hop forward vs malt. But it's a good balance overall. Sort of like an IPA-lite. Finishes dry and crisp. At 5.1% abv---you can reasonably enjoy a few of these. I would put this brew firmly between Sierra Nevada and Dale's pale ale---not bad company! Had mine with Asian take out and it made a tasty combo. This is one I'll be returning too!"
"Good to the last drop."
"For the style, I found this to hit all the major points pretty damn well. Not as hoppy as a Dale's or as caramel-laden as a sierra. A damn good example of the style."
"this beer is ok but really stops short of what it could be. definitely leaves something to be desired from a hop perspective. the lightness of the beer was the star here but it still was not amazing."
"D - Great drinkability. Nice and light. There's a tiny bit of a gap between the intensity of the hops and the overall drinkability. It seems like Victory wanted to make it highly drinkable - and it is - but it does seem a bit watery on some sips, but it's actually nice and refreshing. Solid beer. I love what they do with lighter ales. They never ever miss."
"O- As usaul Victory produced a pretty good beer. I could see this being a beer that could get the average Joe macro shit beer drinker to start to appreciate a finer brew. The amount hop bitterness wouldn't leave their mouth feeling dry and thirsty and the flavor wouldn't be enough to scare them away. Overall an easy beer to drink and a very refreshing one. Thanks again Victory."
"This is a very nice quality APA that I would definitely buy again."
"O: This is a solid beer from Victory. I love the sight of the beer and the smell is awesome for a pale ale, I would recomend, but in a crowded catergory of beer, this is not something I would run to buy again. Great session beer though."
"All things considered I found this to be a really good pale ale. I would have liked the flavors to be a little brighter and fuller perhaps but I don't have a whole lot of complaints. Very pleased with this one and definitely something I wouldn't mind revisiting from time to time."
"Overall, is a decent brew. I would drink this one a nice hot day after doing yard work."
"O: The beer goes down very easily and is quite sessionable. I would have no problem drinking this beer all night long."
"Overall fairly decent, not the best APA but a decent hop addition, light malts, very drinkable and refreshing."
"overall i was not expecting much but i ended up really, really liking this one, good session beer."
"Finish: Hops and a thick grass"
"My overall impression is that it's a very basic, yet unimpressive example of the style. I was expecting more flavor."
"Overall, this is a very solid pale ale. The hops stand out in this one, but in no way overwhelm the whole of the beer. That is the way a good pale ale should be. Nice brew."
"Perfect carbonation. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Overall a well balanced, tasty APA. Not the best I've had but a nice effort from Victory and well worth picking up a sixer."
"Thankfully, it's a pale ale that isn't trying to be a IPA or some other bastardized-macho-hop-whipper. Not the best out there, but well worth a seat the pizza parlor booth (and a repeat visit to my fridge)."
"Victory Headwaters Pale Ale is a fantastic APA. This is a crystal orange-amber beer topped with clingy white lacing that just explodes with citrus flavor. The nose is dominated by tangerine and navel orange peel with subdued whiff of baking biscuit. The beer tastes like candied orange peel, with a fruity mango-like sweetness (not sugary or malty) and a hint of grainy toasted cracker. This is a beer with great balance of hops aroma and flavor with malt, but I wish it were just a little bit more bitter to give it a little more crispness and bite. The beer also has more body than I would've like and tastes a little under carbonated. I guess maybe I want this beer to be more like Prima Pils with it's crisp snappy carbonation and sharp bitterness but with the fruit ale yeasts and citrusy american hops. Either way this is very good but just short of perfect."
"Pours a nice clear golden with a frothy off-white head that retains OK. The aroma is grassy and citrusy hops upfront, along with grainy malt and some biscuit notes, honey and some minerals. The flavor is similar with honey and biscuit malt initially, along with some grassy, citrusy and slightly floral hops, grainy malt and some fruity esters. The mouthfeel is light and sprightly, and drinkability is excellent. A tasty and quaffable pale ale, perfect for warmer weather."
"Overall: Very impressed with this beer. I'm looking forward to drinking this in the summer months as it is really refreshing."
"O: it is a little less hoppy than I hoped but it is highly quaffable and inexpensive - $8.99 per sixer."
"Moderately strong pungent citrus hops over spicy noble hops in the aroma with hints of light crystal sweetness. Clean, no off aromas. Poured short, foamy, white head that faded slowly to a thin ring leaving a few strings of lace. Pale amber colored beer is brilliantly clear. Spicy noble hop flavor up front with minimal citrus flavor. Lightly sweet malt base fades as the moderate bitterness kicks in towards the finish. Fairly clean finish with just a hint of lingering bitterness. Smooth, not harsh at all. Medium body with moderate carbonation is just enough to carry the flavors while maintaining drinkability. A really clean beer that is well balanced with enough flavors to keep it interesting. Well done."
"This is a mighty fine Pale Ale. Succulent hop flavors are complimented by a shifting grass hop bitterness at the end. Not to be outdone, the biscuity and toasted malt flavors manage to shine as well. Mouthfeel is right at medium for an APA and it goes down very easy and smooth. I think Victory has a real winner on their hands here. I know I will buy more than a few six packs of this each year."
"Pours out a golden amber color, with a thinning but still creamy looking head. Smells a lot like a famous Pale Ale from Northern California that I won't name, some nice citric hop whiffs with some spiciness that is hard to point a finger on. Taste is nice a balance, some malty, breadiness but with a spicey hop background to help balance the flavors out and cleanly come off the palate. Definitely a bit more spicey than that Calfornia Pale Ale, but I think these are similar in quality, I believe they both are using lots of whole leaf Cascades, which to me is still one of the best hops on earth. Anyway, would take a point off for originality somewhere, but from the brewers standpoint why try and reinvent the wheel? A nice, high drinkable interpretation nonetheless!"
"Overall, this is a mild but still tasty and well balanced beer that will be an excellent beer on a hot summer day and I look forward to having some fresh bottles in a few months. Victory has produced a pleasant, nicely made version of an APA."
"Victory Headwaters Pale Ale is a crystal clear, lightly sparkling golden ale with a dense, bubbly white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a huge, fresh hoppy aroma of pine and flowers. It has a very smooth medium body with a solid, dry finish. It's a nice, simple, hoppy flavor with perfect bitterness and perfect balance. It tastes slightly dry and piny. This is a supreme example of an American pale ale."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is the first time that I've had this beer, and I'd like to have a fresher bottle sometime. I almost didn't review it, but if Victory still considers it to be well within the freshness realm, then why not. It was good, but I prefer Southern Tier's Pale. But then again, ST is close, so I only drink theirs fresh."
"Overall, I like this one. Solid pale ale."
"O - while this fits into the category, it does push into some other boundaries. I do like the bite this beer has, because it will pair with foods very well and can get some new attention to the craft beer world to non-craft drinkers. Kudos for pushing a new beer into the lineup, and a pale ale of all things. This one works."
"O= A nice easy drinking beer. Actually quite nice. Weather I would buy it again is up for debate. While it is very tasty I can support the guys down the street at Summit for less money and get what I would concider a better product. Not bad by any means however."
"Overall a beer I'd seek out again. Especially if in the mood for more than one."
"O: The lack of any really enjoyable flavors or complexity hurts this beer's overall score; I was pretty tired of it by the end of my glass and doubt I'll be picking this one up again."
"Overall a decent beer, nothing special but above average."
"O - Oh wow, so no more ""Drinkability""? Ok, this makes more sense anyway. So, this one is in the middle for me. The ABV makes it easy to put back a few, but as with most decent PAs it's a bit heavy on the palate. I'd certainly order this if I ever find it on tap. I'd buy a six pack again in a few months. This would be a good one to keep on hand in the fridge for the day that you want a good full flavored and moderately hopped craft ale. Nice job, Victory."
"D- Much more drinkable then off regular draft. Props to Victorys 15th anniversary beer headwaters for supplying the firkin."
"Overall I really enjoyed this offering from Victory and to me it was the definition of a session ale. Moderate ABV, smooth taste and little bite with just enough to take another sip. Hopefully I can find six packs someday!"
"O - A nice, exceptionally easy drinking pale with sessionability and a great hop fix without being overwhelming in that area."
"Clear, light amber, good head retention and lace. Aroma: pineapples, a touch of caramel. Good hop/malt balance, lean toward the hoppy side. Finish is a bit on the flat side. Fairly high amount of carbonation with a medium-light body. Overall, very drinkable as a pale ale/IPA hybrid."
"A good bit of hop taste but not overwhelming. Not an IPA. So it becomes an easy-drinking beer."
"clear golden body with a small white head. A very nice citrusy hop smells is present, wow, maybe a bit of pale malt too but I have to say this APA is one of the best smelling around. I'm impressed with the flavor as well. A nice citrus hop flavor is incredibly well balanced with the pale malts. Finishes with a nice hop flavor but isn't overly bitter. Mouthfeel is light to medium body with a light carbonation. Drinkability is extremely high on this one. I'm really blown away by how good this beer is. Well balanced but with plenty of hop flavor, honestly I think this is the best APA I've ever had."
"The liquid was a light, copper, orange color with a thin, bubbly, white head that dissipated quickly. It smells amazing for a pale ale, there are hints of lime, grapefruit and sweet malt. The taste consists lemon and lime with a hint of bready sweet malt and a piney, hoppy aftertaste. The beer is light, with stinging carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Headwaters pale ale is highly drinkable, it's perfect for a hop-head that wants to have a nice drinking session."
"Feel is slightly bitter with good carbonation on a medium body. Quite drinkable. Not a huge standout, but with this ABV and overall profile, I could see myself coming back for more of this."
"Golden color, nice lacing, smooth drinking. Aroma of big juicy fruit hops not present in the flavor. Reminds me of some of the coveted CA beers from the aroma, but doesnt get there in taste. Still good though. A little citrus and a lot of pine in theflavor, balenced, alittle bitter. Drinks smoove,"
"D- Very drinkable APA with a really nice hoppy flavor. I will definitely pick up another 6er of this."
"I declare misuse of the word ""head"". I isn't nearly as heady as I presumed."
"the CPJ"
"Overall, a very nice offering."
"D: A nice session brwe from Victory -- I would order again, but I thought the bottle was sharper and more distinctive."
"I really liked the aroma off the bat, but the grass notes get to be a bit much, especially in the flavor. Not my favorite type of hop flavors, which turns me off a bit."
"Victory Brewing Company took an interesting path with releasing Headwaters Pale Ale as its 15th anniversary beer. I would've expecting a trendier, bigger beer. Honestly, I love what Victory did here. Not only is it an interesting choice, it's a fantastic beer! This is the most impressive American Pale I've had in a long time. I'm thrilled that this is going to a year round release. Happy 15th, Victory!"
"D- easy to drink but the taste was a watered down pale ale ..i like victory but this PA was a let down for me..and one i would not buy again.. ill try it on tap and maybe buy a single again"
"Overall, highly recommend."
"Drinkabilty - A nice mellow drink low in alcohol and has some hop kick. A nice job with this beer. I can see drinking 3-4 very easy and not realizing it."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability is pretty good, it's a pretty good APA. It had some nice hoppy flavors, and also a pretty nice pale malt base to it. Nice mix of the flavors overall and a nice beer overall. I'll be buying this one again."
"D: This wasn't my favorite pale ale, but still very drinkable. I could use this as a session beer."
"It would be easy to try and characterize this new pale ale as just an IPA but that would be doing it an injustice. It is firmly in the pale ale category and easily shines as such. Crisp and very drinkable! Another fine beer for the Victory lineup."
"The only question is, are today's craft drinkers savvy enough to recognize that balance, or will they still be blinded by the next bigger and better (read as less-focused but brash or bold) thing? Headwaters is a great American pale ale that carves its own little niche; and hopefully will be rewarded rather than passed over."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - The hops are very strong, fresh and tasty. They are not overpoweringly bitter, but I definitely would not prefer them to be any more bitter or this would probably be classified as an IPA."
"When I drink an APA, I like a little more balance than this I suppose. It seems like an IPA in a way. It's certainly not bad, just not my favorite in style."
"Headwaters pours a nice coppery color, with rich suds and nice lace. Next, a lovely bouquet of hops hits the nose...fresh pine, grass, and citrus. Perfect. The flavor? A little bitterness, but with a smooth, clean finish, this is a well-done pale ale with character and distinction. A favorite, and an easy-to-drink treat."
"Got a growler from Victory yesterday. Pours a nicely clear copper color with great carbonation and nice head. Smells mostly of citrus hops with a slightly sweet malt aroma. Tastes a little more malty with slight bitter tinge. Glad to see the malt backbone and not have the hops completely dominate. A light refreshing beer, but the sweetness does seem to weigh it down a little. As this one appears to be Victory's new yearround offering, I'll be looking forward to having this one in the warmer weather. A welcome new addition to an already solid lineup."
"A tasty beer. I am basing my observations on a bottled sample, but I recently tried several on draft. Although I didn't take notes or analyze it too critically, I recall the draft as richer and more satisfying and I'd probably have given it maybe a half a point higher in most categories."
" Headwaters is a tasty pale with some citrus notes from the hops with a slight lemony and herbal effect with mild hints of bitter flavor interwoven among a slight bready and dry toasty malt which doesn't quite get to the nutty realm but the lingering acidity of the hops seems to give the flavor more of a dry taste toward the end which is refreshing. I have had many American Pale ales and I think this one is pretty solid, it has the Victory signature taste, pretty nice balance which is a sign it was brewed to be drinkable. I think Victory achieved that with Headwaters."
"A nice example of the ""new"" American Pale Ale style."
"overall: a nice offering from victory. overall an average pale ale with a slightly amped up hop level. i would drink this again if offered, but i prolly wouldnt buy this again. its definatly worth atleast a single."
"Nice to see a newer Victory offering here in Greensboro.Poured in a nonic a clear copper with a frothy white head that left multiple chunks of broken lace as it never fully settled,good carbonation.A mix of hops in the nose upfront,grassy,herbal,and citrus fruit mixed with a hefty caramel/biscuit base.A little this and watery in the feel it seems to take away a little oomph from the beer.A mix of herbal and citric hops and sweet caramel biscuit malt on the palate,the hops get the slight edge in a pretty balanced brew.A nice APA,big hops but really balanced,tweak the thinner mouthfeel and this is steller."
"HV"
"Love Victory beers, so I had to try this one. Nice golden color with a big old head. I can smell the hops - citrus and spice. The taste is also has a spicy zing to it. Great Spring beer: light in body but with a little hop kick to the taste. Definitely sessionable."
"D: Nice beer to have with dinner. I had it with a fish burrito. It paired well. It goes down smooth and is an easy drinker."
"D-This one is right in my wheelhouse, especially on cask! A session APA if there ever was one...not too hoppy, not too big, everything is ""just right"". I would like to try this on tap and from a bottle to see if it as enjoyable. I doubt it but....Victory has done a fine job with this one."
"D-I hope this becomes a year round release. It's a very good pale ale."
"d: a superbly crafted pale ale not too far off from the hallmarks of the style produced by SN - not much of a surprise from Victory, glad to have another worthwhile, drinkable beer readily available"
"Overall this is another outstanding low-ABV beer from Victory. Well worth a shot."
"D: Goes down easily enough. Fairly flavorful for a lighter (5.1% ABV) ale. Kinda reminds me of a cross between an ESB or an Eglish Pale Ale and an American Pale Ale."
"I can definitely see where this may be thought of as ""HopDevil Lite"". The similarity becomes more apparent the further down into the glass you get. While I could drink HopDevil in any given situation (I've most often had it w/o food), this I'd rather have accompany a toasted deli sandwich with some potato salad, beans, and a dill. Ideal for summertime and barbecues."
"Overall impression: What took ya so long to brew an APA, Victory? This will surely demand an occasional spot in the beer fridge as the temps warm up."
"Cheers"
"Pours clear orange in body with white bubbly head. Grass, hops, lemon, citrus, and dew in the nose. Hops, citrus, wet grass, lemon, and malt sweetness backbone in the finish. Light and sessionable. A lovely pale. Possibly the best Victory has to offer."
"Crisp malts snap at the sides of the tongue with a bitter hop burst on top of the palate that suggests pine cones and grapefruit. The hoppiness brings forth too many perceived IBU's and not quite enough hop flavor for me, however. Still, this is a tasty Pale Ale with a solid mouthfeel, uppity carbonation, and medium body. Definitely glad to have another five waiting for me in the fridge after breaking open the six-pack..."
"D: Excellent! Light, bitter and refreshing."
"Well done!"
"DB- Pretty straight forward with a nice flavor. Maybe a bit big on the bitterness for a smaller pale ale."
"D- High and very quaffable! Non-offensive and easily shareable."
"D - borderline session beer for some but I think I could do a few in a sitting."
"Spicy hopped up APA, hops quite minty and prominent. Some malt, but the hops are the star here. A bit thin, could use some more body and more of a malt presence. Eh nothing too special going on here. Just an easy drinking pale ale, with a bolder/fresher hop thing going on, then frequently encountered."
"Drinkability: A nice session beer from Victory. Lots of hop flavor and at the modest ABV I could make this a stand by."
"D: A really solid example of the style especially for someone wanting to taste some malt in their APA."
"D: Really nice pale ale. Classic flavours, a winner from Victory. Very much a mini Hop Wallop, they both have very similar hop profiles."
"Overall: A solid PA from victory. After the last two sub par beers i had from them(ie Dark Intrigue and Victory Village) it's good to get a winner. Nothing earth shattering but well made."
"It's not going to blow anyone away, but it's a solid drinker."
"Clear amber with a soapy off-white cap, some spotty lacing, decent head retention. Intense hop aroma, fruity grapefruit rind, citrus zest, a bit spicy, with just a little toasty malt in the background. Hop bitterness was sharp, maybe due to the light body and mild malt sweetness. A little spicy, lots of fruity citrus, a bit earthy. Medium-light body with moderate carbonation, off-dry, decent texture. Overall I liked it, but it did tread very close to being overly aggressive in hop character."
"D- While Headwaters won't be the highest APA according to the masses... it still is a very delicious and refreshing APA. IMO, Victory should cut this into the variety pack with the other three brews and really push out a winning 12pk. I will definitely enjoy having Headwaters with some Prima this spring and summer. Cheers Victory!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and refreshing APA - not surprisingly coming from the always solid (and often great) Victory. However, I have to admit that when a 15 year old respected craft brewery releases their first APA, I expect a little more. Maybe it is just a wee bit too herbal for me."
"D: This is an easy to drink Pale Ale. Very refreshing...a solid offering from Victory!"
"Overall, a very strong first OFFICIAL release of a pale for Victory. Always a fan of their products and this did not disappoint."
"D- I really like this. Not as good as Prima Pils, but a solid example of the style. I'll be buying this a lot"
"Single, twelve-ounce copped from Total Wine & More in West Orange. Superb depiction of the style; pours a ruddy, copper, amber-hue with slight carbonation visible. Aromatic, floral notes depicted on the palate and in the nose. Excellent, highly-drinkable brew with hints of tangerine and orange peel. A refreshing, medium-bodied pale ale with a noticeable hop presence. One of the better examples of the style I've come across in a long time. Great stuff. Recommended."
"Crisp, hoppy, refreshing APA. Very nicely done, Victory!"
"I'm glad I was a given a bottle for free and didn't spend $38 bucks on the case. Others appear to enjoy this beer, but my taste buds say no."
"A- A very clear looking olympic gold with some honey color and a bright white and firm inch of ivory colored foam. Very small amounts of stick. I get Citra right off the bat, a nice pale malting and a herbal/earthy scent, not grassy. don't pick up any alcohol. This smells great and the beer is super fresh. Taste really shines from the citra giving off citrus in a pale aleish amount, not shocking like a IPA. Some mango, pale malt, biscuit and just fresh ingredients. Feel is light and comes and goes on the tounge leaving just the lightest aftertaste, that keeps me coming back quicker. This is easy drinking beer and one I can drink a lot of. I won't go crazy over it, but a 6 pack on a hot day will do. This blows hopdevil out of the water, just a more balanced beer alltogether, showing the true skill coming out of Victory. It's harder to make simple beer and pull it off."
"Taste-Toasted malt, mineral stone, citrus hops, spicy yeast. Very tasty and flavorfull, a nice ""go-to"" fridge beer. A great match for a burger or a round of spicy appetizers."
"I bought a case at McBroom's today, thank god my sister is living a block away. So I always have a good excuse, to get up to D'z and McBroom's. Fresh cases of Headwaters Pale Ale. Appears a pale copper, full thicket of light beige head with fine even lacing. Light speckled lacing, with aromatics have a pungent citric/floral aspect no pine or earthiness. Hints of sugar coated biscuit malts in the nose, very nice malt base with sturdy citric hops standing up to the malts. I believe they're using Citra hops with a combo of other hops for this brew, I tried the Dorado version of Pursuit of Pale Ale. Flavors just work with this brew, herbal/citric hops blended effortlessly with a nice biscuit sugar coated malt profile that matches perfectly, low alcohol by volume makes for a very sessionable brew, right at the time when America really needs this style of beer Victory is there for us old school craft beer drinkers that would rather have an accessible pale ale versus the next big beer that is released by the thimbleful to the line of people camping out to drink it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied slight oily texture from the hop resins with ample carbonation, I can't complain. Drinkability, excellente low alcohol meant for consuming with friends over many a conversation and celabratory song. In all reality it's quite tasty with enough booze and flavor to keep you interested great beer."
"D- I like it. Its super easy going and full on flavor. I'm all about hoppy sessionable beers."
"Not a bad beer but nothing out of the ordinary. Usually Victory makes above average beers for the style but I wasn't terribly impressed with this one."
"Egesegedre!"
"Notes. Moderate to medium bodied, and quite flavorful. The creamy mouthfeel makes this beer quite sessionable. Another solid effort from Bill and Ron."
"Recommended. Best comparison would be a lighter version of Ithaca Flower Power."
"This is a very sessionable beer. Drinkability is high due to the fact it seems designed to not push any boundaries and hover in a very neutral place. Not bad if you can't figure out what you are in the mood for. A little disappointing as I've had better Pale Ales from Victory and when I heard they were making one as a flagship I thought they would taste similarly."
"An excellent pale ale that is really enjoyable. A perfect everyday drinker with lots of flavor. Highly recommended."
"EDIT: Just read jeffthechef's review posted just prior to mine. ""Generic"" sums it up perfectly."
"Flavor is simple and gentle with very light bitterness for a pale ale. The overall hop flavor is gentle and balanced with the malts. The malt flavor is gentle with caramel and toast. It seems like it could use a bit more of a sharp, hop bite in bitterness and flavor. Carbonation is average, with the mouthfeel not bringing much to the table. Overall, a bit generic."
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a hazy straw yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, and slight pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, and pine hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Definitely had robust 'in your face' flavoring going on in here. However, the flavors were not awe-inspiring. As the previous reviewer stated, I didn't get ANY citrus aspect in this one at all. I even mentioned to Cameron (regional rep) that it would have been much better with a citrus aspect. To each their own I guess. This thing did have a very nice aroma going on in it though. It is worth trying at least once, but that is about it for me."
"An interesting take on a pale ale. Not as hoppy as I had expected, more reminiscent of a Stone pale ale than a Sierra Nevada pale ale."
"Poured out of a growler into an imperial pint. 1.5 fingers of off white head. It's beautiful copper color is bright and clear. Right away I get a good citrus hop presence with a hint of minerality. Body is medium with slightly oily mouthfeel not a bad thing. Finish has just the right amount of malty/bready characteristic and I'm left with a bit of metallic/mineral aftertaste. It's quenching and definitely sessionable. Fills a gap in the year round victory line up very well. All around a very good brew."
"Man, I liked this. Bright and full hop flavors that were well balanced and that super crisp and easy body made for a most thirst quenching and drinkable presentation. This was just so fresh and vibrant here on draft during its premiere. I'm looking forward to seeing how this translates to the bottle as well."
"Had on tap at the brewery for the 15th anniversary celebration. Nice golden color with decent clarity and a good head. Easy drinking with a hint of cereal and citrus notes. Slightly dry but finishes refreshingly clean. Also sampled on cask. Would like to re-review this one at a later date as I tried about 9 different beers after this one. All in all a really great experience at the Victory Brewing Co."
