"Interesting brew. Strong hops aroma as well as floral esters. A strong malt backbone with quite the hops kick in the finish. Smooth and creamy feel, very drinkable. I could see it as a session beer."
"Mostly clear yellow gold with a small, but nicely creamy, sticky white head.  Smells citrusy at first - orange and grapefruit - giving way to more pungent floral aromas, leafy herbs, and raw grain.  Flavor is pretty much standard, classic APA: floral/citrus Cascade hop bitterness, light resin, and a clean malty sweetness underneath.  Medium bodied, finishing clean and dry.  Nothing memorable, but it doesn't really do anything wrong either.  Good,straightforward APA."

"A rather nice looking beer... The big soapy near white head makes this look delectable. Lace is spotty. The beer is a nice shade of golden amber, and once the head calms down a quarter inch layer hangs on. Aroma is lightly sweet with a nice crisp and semi juicy hop aroma over a bed of grainy malt. Dank tropical fruit mixed with zesty citrus, and some grassy floral. Taste is dry and briskly hopped with doughy, slightly caramel maltiness. The hop bitterness is evenly dispersed throughout and lingers on for awhile after the finish. Good well balanced beer with a slightly forward hop presence. Very likable and also sessionable. Good stuff!"

"Got this one b/c I had a Schlafly Pale Ale draft I really enjoyed. This one is solid but nothing spectacular. Good piney flavor that's not overwhelming. And no bitter aftertaste. Worth getting but probably not better than your favorite IPA."

"Schlafly Dry Hopped American Pale Ale -----4/5."
""
"A well balanced pale, but it has a super drinkable, lack of flavor."
""
""
"O:  A solid beer.  Would have again."
""
""
""
"At this point in my beer-drinking life, I have to wonder how many pale ales I've tried...  This one pours a clear brass topped by a finger of off-white foam and populated by some random floaties.  The nose comprises dry grapefruit peel, mild biscuit, light toffee, and a touch of pine resin.  The taste focuses on the resin, though some grapefruit rind, dried caramel, and mild grass contribute as well.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a decent pale ale, but not one that can stand up to the heavy hitters of the style."
""
"this is an underrated hoppy pale ale.. very solid on draft.."
"O- This one doesn't skimp on the hops and the varietals chosen are of the earthy variety so it's a nice change of pace from the citrusy pale ales that are so popular lately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So, I actually liked this beer pretty well.  To me, it was nicely hopped but not over done.  Keep in mind this is not an IPA as some seem to think; it's an American Pale Ale, a style a bit lighter all around.  Use that for a basis of comparison and it will score a little higher."
""
"Probably won't seek it out specifically, but would buy again if I came across it and was in the mood."
""
""
"Nothing super special, but it does have a nice fresh hop taste to it. Certainly not a bad beer to order a glass of, and a good solid choice if you just want some hops."

"Dry APA by The Schlafly of St. Louis."

"Copper gold with lots of suspended floaties,mother wise clear with a slim head.  The aroma is moderately hoppy, not as intense as expected. Fresh flavor....bitter, dryish, and enjoyable."

"O: I like this beer. It as a pleasant complexity in the hop bill. The sweet malt profile supports the bitterness. It drinks like  an IPA with training wheels. Good job as usual from Schlafly."

"More herbal than hoppy. I would not buy again. What else can I say to meet the 250 character requirement, as I am an engineer and not an English major? While I like hoppy beers, this beer had a taste that I would call herbal and bitter, and not in a good way."

"O) A tasty APA. I'd drink another one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel: rather light bodied; near medium carbonation; smooth."
""
"Pours light amber with a touch of haze, no head. Smells of pine and citrus. Tastes of grapefruit, pine, caramel, touch of salt, bit of metal, a touch of bell pepper. Finishes really clean with very little linger, the bell pepper taste most present here. Very drinkable, quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a very nicely balanced, crisp and refreshing apa, recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An okay APA, which is a hard territory to be with such fierce competition with great representatives of the style in the US."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells mildly of hops, fruit, malt, some pepper. The beer has a light aroma but it works well. The taste is of citrus and hop with a hint of green pepper. The malt is light but in the background. Has a pine taste as well. Very smooth but not overpowering in flavor. Finish is of hop and mild pepper."
""
""
""
"O: The feel was great, but everything else was rather lacking. Luckily, it's great drinkability helps (somewhat) to mask its less-than-amazing flavor profile. Still, this isn't going to be on my ""repeat purchase"" list anytime soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden in color with bronze tint. I can see the microscopic bits of evidence from dry hopping churning within this unfiltered beer. A third of an inch of creamy off white head. The aroma reveals some pale malt,a sweetness of hops that with this blend almost deliver a honey like sweetness that is more of a cereal grain aroma. You do get pale malt blending fairly well with citrus and pine like hops that seem to illicit that sweetness hinted at with the aroma. The mouth is dry,slightly warm,and then prickly from the hop bitterness. In the end there's a fading bitterness from the hops."
"Overall decent, try fresher next time. Cheers."

"Pours golden with white big bubble head leaving lace along the glass. Smells of musty pine, slight rust, earthy notes. Taste hop pine upfront, not too aggressive on flavor, bitter, complexity. Feel is a bit watery but not terrible. Overall an easy drinker, wouldn't seek it out and buy but enjoyable to try once or if it was a goto for locals for a summer party that would appeal to the masses."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of floral hoppy notes with light citrus undertones. Taste is also dominated by some citrus and floral hoppy notes with a dry malt backbone. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Good beer but not as hoppy as I was expecting."
""
""
"O- not a terruble beer by any stretch but definitely underwhelming"
""
""
""

"An okay APA and maybe one that I will go back and get again."

"Pretty easy to dink, the mouthfeel is smooth, with mild carbonation that’s a little fizzy, a medium body and a dry and slightly bitter aftertaste that shows off more malt than hops. It was average to me and bordered on a let-down since it’s called a dry hopped APA. Should have just been called APA."
"Tasted side by side with Dales Pale Ale, my gold standard for APA. Not quite as bright or piney, or as bitter in the finish, a little sweety and much more malty. All good, and many would prefer the Schlafly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As i said, it's one of my go-to ales, and one i highly recommend to anyone wanting to try a nice and hoppy beer but who isn't quite ready for something like bitters or a powerful IPA."
""
""
""
"O: 3.75 This is a solid APA, I love the addition of the dry hop. I wish the aroma endured through the glass as strong as up front, but what can you do."

"Pours a beautiful copper amber hue with a bright slightly off white head forming thick, fine speckled lacing is left down the sides of my tulip chalice. Aroma has earthy, citric, and resinous based hops very aromatic very nice subtle malt biscuit sweetness going on not too complex but a nice lighter hoppy ale. Flavor ample hop bitterness a bit of hop pellet concentrated hop action with some hop flavors layered in I would go with mild dank cannabis and citric earthy hops actually quite nice...enough sweetness to keep things rolling but really the hops shine here. A bit of biscuit malt just enough to make the beer balanced. Mouthfeel is slick with hop oils from the dry hopping process medium bodied crisp carbonation feels good going down. Overall the type of beer that every brewery should offer flavorful not overkill with alcohol or hops, really nice warm weather hoppy brew."
""
"Overall - Not bad, has decent amount of hop flavor for being a low alcohol beer. This is a nice lighter beer to enjoy, especially summertime weather. Worth a drink but nothing to actively to seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I went through a phase where I would not drink a beer below 7% abv because I didn't think that they could have enough flavor. This is one of the beers that proved me wrong and I love it for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a solid take on what has become a ho-hum, ubiquitous style. It doesn't shine, but neither does it disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 3"
""
""
""
"Overall I would drink this again if I ever came across it. Quite a drinkable dry hopped pale ale."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a coppery amber with 1/2 an inch of fluffy white head that laces. The nose is mild, hoppy with a touch of sweetness. Predominantly floral hops. The taste is quite hoppy, floral/citrusy, with a touch of malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is a mild, typical pale ale sweetness upfront, light bodied, effervescet, and hoppy, but not too bitter. The bitterness lingers, but is quite mild. I'd try this again, sessionable and tasty."
""
""
""
"Standard APA nothing exciting. A bit disappointing considering the dry hopping but no off flavors."

"Trying to remember the various great beers I had while bicycling cross-country last year. This one, seems not too well known outside it's local area, is a damn good beer. I hadn't been in the States for some years and was quite impressed with the improvements and availability of good craft beers (you are excused, Utah) and I recall going into a bottle shop somewhere in Middle America, land of Bud Light, and asking for something 'dry hopped'. The knowledgeable guy in the shop sold me this. Full flavored, well hopped, it is a fine one!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm a little torn by this one. It is fairly easy drinking but the astringent bitterness can be a little much after awhile. Probably not something i will pick up very often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a shaker with almost no head, though it appeared to be poured correctly. Pale orange like an under-ripe pumpkin with a little bit of haze to it. Very minimal lacing throughout the glass. The nose was very clean and seemed like a lot of crystal malt and very mild bitter nose. Definitely not the usual ""west coast"" hope smell, but more of a mild, slightly resinous nose. The taste was very much like the nose with a good, balanced malt backbone, slightly bready with a stinging bitterness and a spring of citrus at the end. Good mouthfeel, very smooth with nice carbonation. Very solid offering in a pale ale."
""
""
""
"Poured this APA from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a somewhat hazy copper color, produced a thick, creamy white head, very nice retention and leaves an above average amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted grain and citric hops. Medium in body, smooth and creamy mouthfeel- There is a foundation of sweet malted grain, piney hops, and a touch of fruity apple.- Overall, it is a nice example of the style, great session beer and an excellent ""entry level"" APA. Another very solid offering from Schlafly."
"Good but a little pricey."
""
"O: Good APA. Maybe it would have a nicer aroma on tap or from a fresher bottle? But that's the only lacking characteristic of this APA."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very grainy, otherwise dull pale ale. I can drink this, but it's not what it says it is, and it's disappointing. I don't plan on drinking this again, that's for sure. This surprises me, as the other Schlafly beer I've had was stellar and very hop-forward."
""
""
"Overall this is a nice take on a dry-hopped pale ale but the bitterness seems a bit high and the dry-hopping comes across a little resiny which could be from prolonged exposure to the beer. While I like this I don't love it and would probably not revisit it again in a 6pack format."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a really delicious hoppy brew that I was glad to try."

"I was very impressed with the complexity of the scent so the taste was a bit disappointing but still good enough to drink regularly."
""
"Nice beer. Will have my bro bootleg it up to me again, when he gets the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very drinkable beer, but not a great example of the style in my opinion."
""
"O-At the end of the day too much malt. Even for an APA the hops needed to be there a little more."
""
"Odd as heck, but not at all bad. This would cut right through a spicy dish. Given the fact that this stuff is ubiquitous in my neck of the woods (90 miles from St. Louis) this could be a go-to beer for Thai or Indian nights."
""
"A solid APA with tremendous balance. A nice easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: even though malty this one is well balanced with nice hop variability. A memorable beer."
""
"a more than good session american pale ale. pours a light and bright golden color, with a tiny bit of yeast remaining, and a two inch head, white and dense, lasting and sticky, sexy. the smell is pretty bitter, with english hops on the lighter side and a citrus hop profile, tangerines and lemon zest. the flavor is more mild, almost dull or mellow, not as jivey as the nose, but lots of hop bitter on both ends, and enough malt in the middle. dry hops add flavor, but i think this isnt as hoppy as a lot of american pale ales. feel is solid, perfect medium body and great carbonation. infinitely sessionable and really satisfying as a morning beer. malty and hoppy at the same time, without being overwhelming. a worthy quaff for sure, but not the best choice at the taproom"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent brew. Could have been a lot better."
""
"Flavor has a good malt base, with lots of hoppy flavor. Fruity and citrus hops, lemon and grapefruit, maybe a bit of pine resin as well. Good flavor, but I wanted more hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel and body are appropriate, smooth and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"I only had one of these but it would have been easy to drink a few in a session, even with the alcohol being a bit higher than I anticipated. This is atypical for a Pale Ale but only because I've become so accustomed to the norm that exemplifies this style. While this didn't stand out a ton, I have to give props to Schlafly for pushing the edge on this and proving me wrong when it comes to picturing what an APA should look and taste like."
""
""
"would like to try it fresh"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I liked this beer but a little work to provide a little more body and lighter carbonation to give a creamier feel would be welcome."
""
""
""

"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with a detectable, but ""soft"" carbonated feel. Resulting mouthfeel is very smooth and enjoyable, with a solidly dry finish. Could stand to be a bit thicker-bodied, but this is still very drinkable."

"Drinkability: Solid and very drinkable. A very good brew."
""
""
"Overall: This was a decent example of an APA. I really liked the way the hop bitterness popped but did not rip the top layer off of my tongue"
"M: Drying, pleasantly grainy, really sticks in the tongue. Appropriate to high carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This beer is easy to write off upon first exposure, but its nuances have the ability to win over the senses to a certain extent. Part of the blame lies in the underwhelming smell which, while not offending, does nothing to entice the palate. Other qualities provide more interest without really standing out among other examples of the style."
"good example of an APA. if you can keep from comparing the flavor profiles from IPA's, you can really learn to enjoy the subtle nuances of APA's."
""
"A good choice for quaffing with friends or watching the game. Balanced and unoffensive, if less than memorable."

"I had been skeptical of Schlafy products, but this is a world-class beer. I could enjoy many of these."
""
""
""
""
"Overall just great, Loving this, it goes down like nothing and is so easy to drink. Beer was gone in less than 2 minutes it was so good, glad I got more!"
""
""
"O: nice well balanced apa. The hops dot knock you over or anything but they do provide quite a bit of flavor."
""
""
""
"Needs to be dryer for me, with a bit more umpth. Not bad, just a little week. Worth a try however."
"Although the hop flavors and aromas are not necessarily my favorites, this is a great, balanced, and easy drinking APA. Definitely worth trying if you ever find yourself in St. Louis."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - There is certainly plenty of bitterness to be had with this pale ale, which is something I do enjoy. The characteristics of this beer place it between a pale ale and an IPA for me. Overall, it's a very solid beer that I wouldn't mind having again."

"O- Not at all bad, but not great by any means. To be fair, I've had this on tap at Schlafly and it was pretty damn good. The bottled version just seems to lose something though, even though it isn't that old at all."
"O: A good APA with a good ABV.. worth looking for."
"not bad, but not something i go to unless the options are limited."
"Session brew, for sure. Nothing that will wow, but a good take on the style."
"Trying the Schlafly APA on a raining Monday after work. Just read the forum...regarding a post I put about Zombie Dust from Three Floyds. Apparently several people felt the Schlafly APA rivals the Dust....I say ""ney ney""! The appearance of this beer is a good copper color, clear with great carbonation and finger thick white head that is lacing. The aroma is hoppy and can smell the bitterness with touches of grapefruit. The taste is a decent hop taste mostly of bitter citrus (grapefruit). Hardly any pine or floral notes that I could pick up. The beer lingers on the pallet but overall a decent taste. The mouthfeel is smooth....not overly bitter. Worth a try....but I do not like it more than Z'Dust."
"Overall kinda meg, a bit bland for an APA IMO. this is more like a bitter ale than anything, not much for hop flavor/aroma."
"Pine hops up front that give way to a long and citrusy finish. Pretty bitter in a citrus hop sort of way, but some off flavors from a heavier malt bill than I expected. This gets in the way of a pretty fantastic lemon taste in the back, as well as a lemon bitterness that would make this really well balanced and lighter in body. There is a certain biscuit quality to this that takes away from potentially delicious citrus hops. That said, this is still a pretty good beer, one that would satisfy most hop heads. Mouthfeel is a little on the watery side and doesn't add much to the overall end product. Solid and passable APA, and the dry-hopping is definitely present, but some room for improvement is there."
"Pours a hazy orange to light copper body with two fingers of white head with very good retention and lacing. I love the aromas. A citrus hoppiness is more assertive than on most pale ales; the smell of caramel maltiness seems pretty normal. The taste is hoppy on the front and back palates, with malts more apparent on the middle. Overall, the hop to malt ratio is not as balanced as some of the better pale ales, but I don't think balance was the intended objective. This is an excellent beer for pub food of all sorts. I quite like it."
"Overall - decent APA. From the cask, didn't expect much carbonation, and this didn't have much at all. Nice hop and malt character. Would like to try it on the tap instead of the cask.. was room temperature."
"Overall: I was quite excited to try Schlafly as they just started distributing in my area, but this was a real let down. This is pretty much an adjunct with more hop bitterness. I will not give up on Schlafly, but our first meeting was certainly awkward."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. I don't know about this one. This one brought me back to the days of late 90's college when beer was hardly beer. I'm going to skip straight to smell and taste on this one. I thought for sure I was diving into a Schlitz or Schaeffer. The nose just had a high level of maltiness too it. The hops were very faint, although this isn't an IPA so it's not exactly designed to be a hopcentric offering. The taste is VERY malty and quite bitter. Overall, I enjoyed having a chance to try this, but it's just not my thing. Probably won't be coming back for it."
"O - A decent APA, but one that departs from IPA origin and really leans to the side of just a pale ale. While I like the hop character of this beer, it’s not astounding. I could use both more bitterness and more aroma. Still, it’s finely balanced and very drinkable. A good session APA, and a nicely done beer from a brewery that’s normally a miss or disappointment for me."
"O - A very American beer. hop aroma is spot on, but is a little lacking on the flavor of the overall beer."
"O--I'm really glad I got to try this. It's from a brewery I have never heard of, but it makes me want to seek more of them out. Very balanced, no flavor overwhelms another part. I could see myself drinking several of these."
"The body is medium to light with nice fluffy carbonation. The slick feel leads into an oily finish. Not a bad effort here, certainly worth a try."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a one finger head and great retention. Great lacing throughout the drink. Aroma of piney and citric hops. Taste follows the nose with great balance of malts. This tastes fresh and clean. It tastes like an awesome homebrew and I mean that as a complement. It's smooth and refreshing, I really like this brew!"
"O: There is nothing wrong with a hoppy pale ale. This beer keeps things interesting with the dry hopping. Two weeks ago when I had this a little fresher the citrus and pine didn't work together so well, they seemed to but heads in the flavor profile. Maybe this one is an oddball that gets a little sweet spot a couple months out. A good buy from Schlafly."
"O: At the price, there are better session beers to be found in the region, but this stands up well enough. I'll work through the rest of the six-pack happily enough, and am happy for some more variety from my corner grocer."
"Happy 20th Anniversary!"
"Taste is really a nice drinkable hoppy flavor. Blends of pine and citrus; not in your face though. Mouth feel goes along with the nice head, really creamy. This beer is really enjoyable to drink and I will buy it again."
"O: Great APA style; not extraordinary, but worth trying if you like APAs, or if you like IPAs"
"seek this OUT."
"O: Enjoyed this one on tap. Would have had another if I was going to stay longer. Not necissarily complex, but well balanced and I got my hops fix in at happy hour."
"D/O- Easy drinking but was really hoping for more from this offering after having a few of Schlafly's beers at their taproom last week in St. Louis. middle of the road pale ale. Nothing off-putting but nothing that stands out. Shoot for something else from this solid brewery."
"O: Schlafly's Dry-Hopped APA is a rare miss from a very solid brewery. I won't hold this one against them, but I'll be damned if this isn't one of the most dissapointing dry-hopped brews I've ever quaffed. You're best bet is avoding this one entirely."
"Overall: This was a good pale ale. Crisp enough with a solid hop profile. Not a ton going on, but tastes quite nice."
"O: Solid APA. Nice balance to the malt and hop bill. Moderate ABV makes it very sessionable."
"O; My basic impression of this beer is that as soon as my glass is empty I'll have forgotten what it tastes like. It's just nothing special, and not even a good simple beer. It just IS."
"A fantastic brew and, in my opinion, the best that they have that is somewhat readily available."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and is rather sessionable."
"This pours golden brown with nice chunky white head and some good lacing. The smell is pretty pungent even as you pour this beer. There is a lot of grassy/hops smells, but there is a fresh bready element too. The taste is much more herbal and hoppy than the Schafly Pale Ale, but the bready malts flavors come out even more in this beer. I even get a little green pepper vibe that I will attribute to the crisp, clean bite. There is great complexity in the balance here, and I am thrilled that I’m not suffering through a sweet, heavy bodied, syrupy beer. This is a solidly crafted beer where the flavors sits on the tongue and invokes the next sip, without leaving a mucky gross taste that you find yourself wanting to wash down. This is medium bodied, but definitely something I could have a few of."
"Pours golden orange with thin, fizzy white head. Good head retention and lacing. Nice carbonation. Bright malty aroma, fresh grain with a pleasant, resinous hoppiness and some spicy yeast notes. A heavy malt flavor, not overly sweet though. However, there is a strong bitterness without much to balance it. Resinous and earthy hops. The mouthfeel is also out of whack from the perceived bitterness of the beer. I'm usually a fan of resinous, pine tree hops but this one is a bit overboard on the bitterness without much hop flavor to show for it."
"O: Not to shabby. Its not Sierra Nevada, in terms of an American Pale Ale, but for the value, its something I will absolutely purchase again. This is a great session ale and a go to when I need a quick hop fix with mild alcohol content."
"O: I've heard nice things about this one, but you know what they say, ""Tasting is believing."""
"Overall- I am very lucky to have had this ale during the End of Prohibition Festival. They will not be brewing a batch like this again they said. Very complexed and the Citra Hops added a great component to the ale. Will be waiting to have the APA once again in bottle and see the differences between these two. Very nice! Could drink more than 2 but the availability was limited."
"Thankful for the opportunity, but this is a middle of the road APA that I had higher hoped for."
"O- Not the best APA. I have had one or two worse, but the malt backbone was off and not supported by enough hop flavor. I would like to visit this one again down the road since it seems others don't get that alcohol burn, but for now I would say it is a little below middle of the road per style."
"Overall this is pretty good APA...far from the best I have had. I was expecting a bit more from Schlafly."
"Worth drinking."
"D: A nice pale ale from Schlafly. A fairly complex balance of hop flavors contributes to an extra dimension that many APAs lack. This is more grainy than malty, but it works well enough. Certainly worth a look."
"Flavor is rich, chewy, and full of strong pine and orange citrus notes. Very flavorful, and quite enjoyable. On a par with good IPAs, this one is one of Schlafly's finest, and my favorite of their regular line."
"Nice, thick head that sticks around for some time. Smells of roasted grain, citrus and sweet bread. Tangy grapefruit dominates the initial taste, but gives way to creamy breadiness and sweet honey. A substantial body and crisp, fresh flavors make this quite a pleasure to drink."
"A solid drinker and was a great compliment to some fried fish!"
"Light amber in color, with a fluffy white head that dissipates in a few moments. There is a faint, yeasty aroma that couples with hints of the well-balanced and well-integrated hop flavors. A medium to medium-light bodied beer, the malts and grain flavors nicely balance the moderate hop profile which tend toward grapefruit citrus flavors. Overall a very drinkable beer that seems to straddle the boundaries of a hoppy IPA and a smooth drinking pale ale."
"No complaints on drinkability. The 5.9% ABV really slowed me down, though. Probably because I had a lighter supper than usual."
"Drinkability - This brew is, without a doubt, a sleeper in my opinion. Solid all around. It's sessionable, easy to drink, pleasant on the eyes and taste buds and is just really pretty darn good. It's not outstanding, but better than most. A pleasant suprise that I will visit again sometime in the Spring or Summer."
"D- This has easy drinkability but mostly because it has a muted overall flavor. ABV was low enoguh that drinking many pints would be in the future. A easy drinking pale ale but I couldn't really get any dry hopping flavors like I thought I would be able."
"Superb offering for a hoppy APA. Very drinkable."
"Solid beer. Might make a good gateway to hoppier beers for folks who don't normally like the style. Will pick this up again at some point in the future."
"I would consider giving this beer another shot when I am more aware of the freshness."
"D- Not quite what I was expected from the aroma and not something I would order again."
"D - the sweet finish and slightly sticky texture hold down drinkability"
"Overall, a very good APA, and a beer I wish I could get in Michigan."
"overall, a pretty mediocre pale ale for being a dryhopped one. It's certainly not bad, very drinkable. But this could pass for a blond in the NW."
"Drinkability -- To be honest, I didn't care much for this one. The hopping was a bit off and the weird tortilla taste was distracting. This falls short of expectations, especially considering how many great APA's come from the Midwest. Given this beer was bottled eleven days ago, I will assume that this hasn't passed it's freshness threshold."
"Drinkability: Overall pretty enjoyable, just wish that the hops would have been a little more in your face, but I could see myself drinking a few of these on a warm summer day."
"D: This is a pretty average APA."
"The cask version of this beer is astoundingly hoppy and should be experienced."
"D- All in all a good (not quite great) representation of style. I though it was a good beer but the advertised dry-hopping didn't manifest itself as much as I would have liked."
"Drinkability: very smooth and easy to drink. Not taxing on the palate."
"O - B, pretty good for a pale ale which isn't my favorite style. Definitely like the aroma and flavor is light enough to be enticing. Would consider buying in the future..."
"Pours a moderate orange color with a white head. Nose brings some orange, grapefruit, and hints of pine. There is some moderate malt in the background that works its way into the taste. The taste is mainly comprised of citrus hops. The dry hopping has done this quite well. Nice mouthfeel with good bitterness levels and a really high drinkability factor."
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I would love to have some more but I can't get it here in California."
"D: This is a beer that goes down easy. Likable and drinkable."
"M & D - Very good carbonation with a crisp light body and overall good flavors but still an average beer."
"Overall this is a good beer that's interesting and unique, but it seems to lack drinkability and a level of carbonation that could make a beer like this much more refreshing and highlight some of the hop characters a bit more."
"Drinks great. I wish I could find this one regularly, because it's a good value and good beer all-around."
"D-Exceptional drinkability.Great lawnmower beer."
"This is a darn good beer and gives SN Pale a run for its money"
"Classic and true, there's not much that separates Schlafly's Pale Ale from many others who are doing this style very well. But this one seems less processed and has a bright and vibrant freshness to it, similar to a few great homebrewed versions."
"Mouth feel wise it's got a crispness of a lighter beer, but a slight warming feeling in the end. Overall a good complex stronger session beer."
"12 oz. bottle courtesy of a trade. Loved that ""bottled with love on..."" dating. Pours a cloudy yellow-amber with a smallish white head. Lacing is present but thin and not long-lasting. Nose is toffee, some citrus (especially grapefruit and lemon), some pine and grain. Taste is pretty well balanced - sweet malts, citrus and yeast. There is some bitterness but it takes a backseat to the sweetness, especially in the finish. Body is lighter than medium, a little sticky and creamy. I had never heard of this beer but it was a very drinkable brew and one I wouldn't avoid in the future."
"Decent APA that is worth trying and something I could see myself ordering again."
"I'm glad that I tried it, but it's not a do-over."
"D: A moderate abv and hop profile that far outpaces most APAs? I'm diggin' both. A nice ale to sip through after a long week."
"Medium body, carbonation is not as aggressive as it looked. Very easy to drink. Enjoyable."
"Drinkability: This is really an all-day kind of beer - light body, bitter and refreshing and a very moderate ABV would allow this one to be sipped on morning (er, late afternoon?) on into the night."
"The taste follows the nose, but adds a hint of citrus towards the finish which presents with a nicely balanced touch of bitterness. This has great carbonation and a nice medium body-- excellent feel and very easy to drink. I could have several of these in a sitting without problem."
"The taste starts with a light resny palate with some earthy hops and a little citric bitterness. The malts add some toast with few biscuity flavors. his is a simple bittr beer with a musty hop fiish that lingers."
"Big fluffy head, off-white, loosely knit with a surface of exploding bubbles, steady dissolve, lacing slides steadily down the glass sides. The hazy orange color has as much red as yellow in it, translucent and close to opaque, average vibrancy. The nose offers sweet tangerine, tangelo citrus, pungent florality, these really dominate the rest, golden honey, green hay, pepper, earthy, leesy yeast, the hops leave very little space for maltiness to develop. Medium-bodied, good firmness and mouth presence, the carbonation adds percolation, doesn't distract. Tangerine, orange, white grapefruit drier here, still in the driver's seat. Leafy hops verge on bitter at times, rye bread, flowers join in. Hint of caramel. Apricot, pineapple, nectarine fruit carves out a moderate presence. It's well-crafted, however, arguably exceeds its categorization, should be more relaxed and fluid."
"To me this is very drinkable APA. Probably not the best one out there, but definately worth having. Very balanced and smooth, but with enough hop kick to satisfy."
"Quite drinkable and overall a solid pale ale which can't seem to decide whether it wants to be an IPA or not. Very crisp and refreshing. I'd buy it again."
"Beer is smooth with only moderate bitterness. It finishes nicely but dry. The more I drink the more harsh the finish becomes. I think the bitterness is growing on me. I think the best part about this beer was the aroma and I feel that there are better hops to use for dry hopping. Overall the beer was OK to good."
"I would love to try this beer again on draft somewhere. I think the tap would really open this beer up."
"Pours a golden color with a decent head that slowly fades. Not much aroma, just a trace of citrus and hint of sweetness. The taste is citrus with a lingering bitterness, which is not a bad thing. It has a medium feel, continued carbonation and mildly dry finish. A respectable mid-range APA. I would like to try this fresh on tap to compare."
"Very pleasing and one to drink for prolonged periods."
"2.5 D: Not a big fan of this one. I'd be happy to try it fresh, as many people seem to have liked this."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a cloudy yellow-orange color with a large, fluffy off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is caramel malts, straw, and citrus hops. Flavor is caramel malts, sweet, grapefruit, citrus and resin hops. Mouthfeel is light, creamy, and bitter at the end. Good beer, refreshing."
"The dry hopped APA poured a very hazy orange color with some noticeable sediment. A very frothy off white head sticks around and laces the pint glass. Smell is mostly hops and some citrus as well as pines. Aromas are pretty good. Taste is also pretty hoppy with similar citrus tastes as well as some floral earthy tastes. I much prefer the added hops from the cask than this out of a bottle. Mouthfeel is slick and smooth. Drinkability is solid for this. ABV is medium grade and taste is good for the style."
"Picked up a single 12 oz. bottle dated 10-5-09 last week at the recommendation of a fellow beer lover. Poured out a cloudy light orange with a decent head and tiny bubbles rising quickly. The color was the way i like to see these types look. Smelled of pineapple- citrus with a nice crisp hops tone in the background.Mild flavor with citrus fruits,hops and malt nicely balanced leading up to a fairly dry finish. Pleasant aftertaste brought on from the dry hopping. Soft, creamy mouthfeel. Good, bitter bite on the way down. This is an easy drinking beer with a low abv that i really enjoyed. My first taste of Schlafly's dry hopped and surly not my last. I could easily drink 6 or more of these in a sitting."
"Worth a try, but also worth improving upon, too."
"Overall, well-rounded, easy drinkin' APA. It's simple and to the point. I love how the hops come together with the bread-like malt and in good balance. Also, my favorite offering from Schlafly."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel thins out a tad bit as I drink, and it could use just a little bit more body. Drinkability is pretty good however, and it would serve well as a session beer."
"D: Another good example of an APA. A mild bitterness and an overall refreshing quality make this a nice sessionable pale ale."
"This beer pours a nice light orange color with a great, foamy head and perfect lacing. Wonderful leafy hop aroma greets your nose and flirts with your senses as your mouth begins to water in anticipation. And, no doubt about it, the taste is very hoppy and bitter with a nice sweet, citrusy balance. This is an excellent ale, and one of my favorites from Schlafly. Perhaps a bit too bitter for some, but to me it's delicious. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth to slightly coarse with perfect carbonation. Ease of consumption? Oh yeah. Very drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable with the nice hop taste and mouthfeel. I would definitely buy this beer again, great beer for the price as well."
"D: I'm really trying to give this beer the benefit of the doubt because I know its a bit past its prime. However... its hard... the flavor is not there. There is no crispness, no fresh hop flavor. The profile is messy and the carbonated mouth just makes all the lack of qualities stand out even more. I don't think I'm gonna have this one again."
"Nice color, exceptionally light in color with a decent head. Don't love the smell, it's a little to earthy for me. The beer is good to excellent in taste. Has an overall feel that seems to coat your whole mouth with a nice citrus flavor that isn't too bitter. A bit of sweetness that has a great balance with the hops. Overall this beer is really good. The smell is the only thing that puts me off a bit, but the flavor is the most important part, so I would definitely recommend this beer as a very drinkable beer for anyone who likes a pale ale. I'm guessing the smell must be related to the dry hopping, but I haven't had enough dry hopped beer to be sure."
"Drinkability? This is one easy drinker! Plenty of flavour and a very nice mouthfeel bring the A game for this delicious American Pale Ale. This would be a cool beer to buy often if it was available here. My hat's off to the brewers!"
"This one looks very nice. The beer is clear and golden, with a little layer of yeast falling down towards the end. The head is at least an inch, dense and white, which ends up leaving very nice lacing. A good looking pale ale. The smell is nice. It's very clean, filled with a light sugary, caramelly sweetness, with some crusty bread. The hops are nice, a bit zesty and leafy, but not incredibly robust. Seems nice and a bit better than normal. The taste is nice too. Clean and refreshing. A slightly bready, sweet, and nutty malt comes up, with a layer of slightly herbal hops. The bitterness is low, the hops have a bit of pollen a hint of sweet lime, kind of leafy. It's really nice, but not one that will really wow you. The body is about medium, the carbonation provides a nice rush, but doesn't really sting. I think it's good. The drinkability is very good. I think it's almost as good as it gets as far as a drinkable beer. This could make a very pleasant night of drinking. It doesn't overdo it on bitterness or resins, a nice smooth, slightly sweet malt body. I would probably buy it again."
"D - Really drinkable. Goes down nice and smooth, very crisp, and hop/malt balance is tremendous. Very easy drinker."
"I can drink a couple of these rather easily. This brew gets a lot of shelf space in St. Louis supermarkets and I can see why. One of the best offerings from Schlafly. I would buy that again."
"seems like potentially a lovely brew. will hopefully come across a better sample in the future."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear deep golden color with a huge off-white, frothy, cloud-like head. The nose is of hops, more subdued than some of the earlier ones I had (I should have reviewed this a long time ago, I just found this one in the back of my beer cabinet - bottled 2-24-09). Still west coast type hops, citrusy and piney. The hops are still apparent in the flavor, grapefruit comes to mind immediately, slightly resinous and piney. A solid malt backbone to balance but this is definitely a hop forward beer. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a creamy, velvety carbonation. Overall an excellent APA, again - I should have rated this as a fresher beer but it still stands up over time. Definitely the best Schlafly beer I've had."
"Overall, a decent pale ale, but not my favorite."
"This beer pours a clear gold with a two finger of off-white head. Head retains well and recedes to a layer that stays fairly frothy and thick, leaving nice solid lacing on the glass. Nose is of floral hops some citrus hops and faint pale malts. Taste starts with citrus hop bitternes, balanced in the middle with pale malts and a touch of sweeter caramel malts, finishes with a floral hop bitterness. Medium body, medium to high carbonation, very crisp, dry finish to this beer. Another solid offering from Schlafly - I could sit with this one all day."
"Drinkability: Eh, this stuff is decent but nothing special. I would not go out of my way to procure much more of this stuff"
"D: Very easy to drink but a bit carbonated"
"A pretty nice APA, considering I haven't really had a good new one that I really liked in months. The taste didn't live up to the aroma unfortunately and I found it to have too much of the hop character and bitterness that has come to be slightly revolting over the last year or so. I think if it was a bit more balanced with some residual malt sweetness this would be much more enjoyable."
"Definitely would drink this one again."
"Drinkability: A very solid brew, and one I'm glad to have tried. The dry hopping adds a nice touch to this one, and at 5.9%, you can have a couple of these to truly appreciate that touch. It's not the best APA I've ever had, but it's near the top of the ladder. A very drinkable, well-crafted brew."
"12oz. Poured a golden-orange color with a fairly thin, bubbly white head that held decent retention and left decent lacing on the glass. Aromas were weaker than expected. Some floral hops with a fruity aspect of apples or grapes. Tastes were much sweeter than expected, especially initially. Very fruity with an apple and grape juice taste, some faint toasted grains. A slight citrus and floral hop taste comes in towards the finish. Finishes dry, but fairly sweet. About half way through, the hops seem to come through more, offering some bitterness and hop oils. Mouth-feel is thin to medium bodied with more carbonation than expected, but still seems ok to me. Towards the end, the hops continue to build on the palate, and the dryness keeps you coming back for another sip. I guess I was expecting more of a hop profile because of the giant hop cone on the label, but in the end, this is a great example of an American Pale Ale with tremendous balance. I liked the fruitiness which offered a refreshing taste with excellent drinkability."
"Very drinkable and sessionable APA. When had fresh this is truly an incredible example of a classic dry hopped American Pale Ale."
"D-Very drinkable with plenty of hop flavor and mild enough body to pound quite a few down while enjoying a good BBQ on the back porch."
"I'm not sure how many I could drink as the carbonation is a bit high. Other than that it is a nice session beer."
"I recently discovered the Schlafly brewery on my last trip to St. Louis, and I have to say they are one impressive microbrew. I, personally, am a huge fan of hoppy beers, and this one definitely hits the spot. Aside from it's strong, hoppy flavor, this APA manages to finish smoothly with a bitter twist. Excellent beer!"
"Light to medium bodied, leaning toward light. A good bit of carbonation. A good drinker. Mild enough so as not to assault my palate, but flavorful enough to keep me interested and convince me to have another."
"drinkability is good and has been a go to beer for me for some time now"
"Overall this is a solid APA and one that I could have often - definitely worth a shot."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a bite of carbonation."
"D - I like the way the malt and hops are balanced in this; almost like a lager. The citrus flavor from dry hopping gives it crisp and clean taste. This is very drinkable."
"Overall while not mind blowing in anyway it was very nicely done. I would have no issue at all with try thing this one again."
"Pours gold in color with a decent amount of white head. This is the hoppiest (is that even a word?) that Schlafly currently offers so I'm usually drinking this. Smell of hops, citrus, grapefruit. Smells more hoppy then it really is...could use more! Taste is of slight hops, citrus, bitterness but I'm wanting more. Mouthfeel is decent but it's lacking. I usually drink this when I'm at the Taproom and/or Bottleworks but I would like something with a bit more umph! Decent APA."
"I have had this both on tap, and in bottle. I, surprisingly, enjoy it from the bottle as I found the tap to have lost some of the hop edge (maybe it was just an old brew?). Definitely one of my favorites, and has become my standby when I can find it."
"A solid choice for an APA. You get a big hop aroma from this beer but the taste does not live up to the smell, which is a bit like cereal. I was hoping for something more bold, not that this beer is completely without character. It is, it's just not very complex. You can get this beer all over St Louis, where it is a favorite."
"I retried this brew with a 1 month bottled on date the taste was crisp and the sour flavors were not apparent maybey I had a light damaged bottle the last time , but this brew was good and I will enjoy this brew some more. Changed the rating."
"Oh yea, this one has some lupulin bitterness! Kind of an herbal, citrus hop flavor. Light bodied with a very weak malt presence, but sometimes that is a good thing. Carbonation is too high, but it tastes pretty clean and fresh. A nice beer, worth a try!"
"Poured into a pint glass and poured a cloudy amber/orange color. Produced a huge head. At first I thought I just poured it poorly but upon pouring a couple others later all of them had a huge head. The head sticks around for a while and leaves a fairly nice lace all the way down the glass. In both aroma and taste it's pretty hoppy and has a sort of sweet taste to it but also kind of bitter. Mouthfeel is fairly average, nothing special there. At first I didn't care much for this beer and thought I couldn't drink that many at once but after a second I found I could drink a few of these in one sitting no problem. Overall this beer is pretty good, I might pick it up again, if it were on tap somewhere and the other choices were poor I would have no problem getting one."
"This beer pours a slightly cloudy amber color, not that dark but not quite clear. It looks good. The smell is pine and citrus. On the first sip you get the taste to match the smell, hops, hops, hops. Tasted like pine that got more citrus notes as it lingered. Hops dominate but don't wash out the malt flavor. Quite tasty for someone like me who isn't really a hophead. Its about as hoppy as I like beer. Very drinkable, I have no problem putting back five or six of these in a sitting. The glass shows decent lacing as I put it back down on the bar. All in all an excellent ale for those who like a lot a hops but not crazy IPA levels. Recommended."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Quite hoppy, but it should be and you should be expecting it."
"Not sure where the sulfurous smell came from but was very detrimental."
"Amber in color with an orange tinge; slightly cloudy; fine white head. Light citrus hop aroma. Delicate, fleeting citrus hops up front. Mellows into a soft, floral mid-palate with pale malt lending some light grainy notes. Finishes with a light hop bitterness and lingering grain flavor. A solid pale ale. Malt bill is perfect for delivering hops-- fresh, bready, unobtrusive-- and I suspect this is really good when fresh on tap."
"Mouth is crisp and slightyl dry. Drinks easy and Damn what a good job by schlafly."
"This is one i'll have around much more often I may have found my perfect summer yard work beer"
"Pours a slightly hazy light amber, almost golden in color. Grainy, crisp aroma. Moderate head with good lacing throughout. Lots of hops evident. Very good going down, bitterness throughout. Excellent APA IMO. Will definitely buy again. Bought it at the only place in our town I could find. Will make sure they keep carrying it. To me a good value for $1.25/bottle including tax - Cheers!"
"D-Very tasty beer,perhaps my next favorite session beer.I should have picked up more!"
"This is a good beer and is not only a taste sample, but a beer you could enjoy regularly."
"Had from a 12oz bottle purchased in Peoria last week. The beer is hazy, light orange colored, some very fine yeast floaties. There's a little dry lace on the glass which is nice. The beer smells hoppy but in a bitter way (not citrus or pine which would be preferable for my palate). The taste is toasted malt, a little biscuity, with a hops bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is OK, decent carbonation. It could be that this beer is a little past it's prime, I like to get dry-hopped beers fresh. But still this is pretty good."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a deep caramel golden color with a half finger of head, decent retention. Taste is very hoppy up front. Citrus and floral hop flavors. Light dry mouthfeel. Fairly drinkable. Doesn't stand up to most of schlaflys offerings."
"Serving type: bottle"
"It's okay, but good only for a brief blast of hops, and little else."
"Nice APA showcasing those great American hops."
"Thanks to htomsirveaux for including this one in a recent trade."
"D- Very drinkable especially on handpull at the Taproom."
"Overall, a tasty apa, but I don't get anything from it that really stands out. I do have to say, I find nothing wrong with it, as it has a good level of hop bitterness but is not by any means overwhelming...just a solid example of what i think an apa should taste."
"Not bad. I guess I was expecting a bit more from the profiles considering that this was dry hopped but this ended up being a solid drinker, especially when you factor in that this is nearly 6%."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D--I just said session beer, didn't I? Well I'll stand behind that. I could drink this all night. Alcohol level is a bit high to be perfect."
"a little smoother than an IPA."
"M/D - a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. Very well balanced and nicely carbonated"
"All in all a very enjoyable APA. I would never be displeased with a sixer of this in my fridge. Another dependable offering from Schlalfly."
"Drinkability is high. It's a tasty beer, well made for the most part, and an easy drinker."
"Pours a very clear light brown body, with a big creamy white head that is very lasting. Dark grapey aroma, dusty, malty. Fruity taste, some sweet maltiness, a little nutty. Dark grape taste. Soft mouthfeel. Some hoppiness, but mostly a malty taste."
"It has a beautiful bronze color with a tan head and lace. There is a ton of lace and head as a matter of fact. It has great fruity and floral aroma. The floral aroma is very clean and crisp. It is not overly bitter but the hop flavor is predominant and you can tell that it has been dry hopped. The body is carbonated just right for a medium bodied beer. The aftertaste is the bitterest thing about the flavor."
"D-not very assertive for this style but all styles have a range and this is on the weak end of the assertive flavor scale"
"D: A very nice APA, very smooth, good flavor, very easy to reach for another. Recommended."
"Delicious!"
"Nice, slightly cloudy golden brown body, with thin head but good retention. Strong aroma, with lots of floral hops. Lots of hop flavor as well, with a bit of mild malts hidden in the middle. In contrast, the mouthfeel is surprisingly soft and even fluffy at the front, until a more bitter and tingly finish. Very interesting. Great beer, even though I'm no hophead."
"drinkability is good. this is a solid APA with a nice hop quality and a solid malt base. nicely composed."
"Drinkability to me was good for this style. I'm not a big fan of IPAs and related styles, but this one had enough balance in it to where I wouldn't refuse one if offered. Worth giving this one a try."
"Pours a slightly hazy gold with an attractive pillowy white head. The head recedes but never leaves, and a slight lacing is left. Smell is a nice amount of piney hops and slight papery oxidization, but not enough to be a bother. Taste follows the smell with piney hops to start but then developing into a surprisingly sweet malt flavor. Finish is moderate bitterness but a little too short. Mouth is medium, but with very nice carbonation. This is a VERY drinkable APA. I actually prefer this to Dale's Pale, which says quite a bit!"
"D - a tasty brew that's easy to drink."
"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this at first but this is a damn good little brew. Actually, behind Alpha King, this is the tastiest APA that I've had. Its hoppy, piney, and delicious! Well done, Schlafly!"
"Drinkability - the medicinal taste is a bit of a letdown, but this is a pretty decent session beer otherwise."
"Sampled at the brewery in St. Louis while on a road trip with my lady. The beer was honey gold with amber highlights and a creamy, white head. Great retention and solid lacing. Aromas of piney hops and mint with sweet malts, and spices beneath. The flavors are again hops-forward, piney and citric. A malty/bready character appears in the middle to add some gumption and balance. AS the beer warms it gets more drinkable and the hops provides a resin-like, tongue-coating, dry finish. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Sessionable and enjoyable. A very good example of the style and worth seeking out."
"D- Great taste, great session beer for hop heads"
"Pours a very slightly foggy amber with a decent crème head. Nose is almost like a musty minor citrus thing. Flavor is sweet. And there is a fairly thick amount of citrus in there. As it warms it gets smoother and the sweet tone really becomes nice. Feel has a slight bite to the carbonation and the liquid is just a slight bit sticky but overall smooth. This is smooth and nice to drink. However. I say put this in a cask and treat it right. Then we'll have something reeeally nice."
"Had on tap at a recent visit to the Flying Saucer. This beer was served in a non-branded shaker pint. This beer pours a clear, straw golden with a big frothy white head that left sticky lacing down the entirety of the glass. The aroma is piney hops, a hint of orange and a subtle malty sweetness. The taste is spot on for an APA. A nice piney hop presence that's not overpowering yet strong enough to let a mild bitterness reside on the tongue. The sweet malty backbone comes out in the finish to push the hops off the palate. Really nice an crisp mouthfeel. Its light with just a hint of dryness. This is a really easily drinkable brew by Schlafly. I really think that their best brews are their sessionable ones."
"Thanks to jtrockchalk for the chance to try this."
"D- A very balanced beer that could be a session beer for me. The low price and availability also make this more drinkable. Drinkable but nothing great. Does not leave a lasting impression."
"D- A great and wonderfully drinkable APA. Taste and aroma blew me away. I recommend this to anyone that can get their hands on it."
"Big thanks to Stlstoutaddict for this one! Pours a golden yellow with a fluffy white head on an aggressive pour into a sam perfect pint glass. Wonderful citrusy smell. Great big hop aroma for a pale ale- I love it. Great balanced flavor as well. Great hop bite with some grapefruit and orange tinges then mellows quickly but smoothly with a sweet malt finish. Great session beer! Wish I had more."
"this brewery has yet to disappoint me."
"Note: this review is for the bottled version. the casked version available at the downtown brewpub is a step up in taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability."
"A must try, do not blow this one off. Quite possibly, one of the best pint's to ever cross you're lip's !!! It's almost like a cross between The Floyd's Gumball head and Alpha King."
"Hazed honey blonde with a whipped,almost meringue-like head that lingers long into the drink leaving impressive sticky rings of lace on the glass.Nose is mostly fresh piney hops and faint yeasty bread.Taste is very balanced between malty sweetness and hop bitterness.Silky smooth textures dominate the medium heavy mouthfeel.This beer is darn close to a perfect everyday APA,right up there with Sierra nevada.Delicious."
"Highly drinkable APA this brew is a must try in my book. Very enjoyable glad I started of with this one today"
"Pours a slightly hazy light golden amber with a small fizzy head that dissipated to nothing quickly leaving no lacing. Smell is dominated by the resiny pine hops and citrus with a definite bready malt aroma in the background. The taste follows the aroma with the same pine needle hoppy flavor with a bit of citrus in there as well. The malt background is again evident and balances out the hops nicely. The mouthfeel is medium and slightly sticky with very little carbonation leaving the resin aftertaste to linger. This is a very drinkable APA as the dry-hopping is not over-the-top."
"D- Good beer that I could drink a lot of with a pizza in a beer garden."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber/orange with a creamy white head that stick around forever. Aroma is hops, floral grapefruity resinous hops. Taste follows the smell, adds a little caramel malt, and leaves a bitter citrus on your palate. Crisp carbonation, medium body, again great head retention. Nice highly flavorful apa."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 1/29/08. Served in a snifter, the beer pours an amber/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is very nice, it smells mostly like citrusy hops with a bit of malt and bread. It tastes like citrusy and grassy hops with some bready/biscuity malt too. Nice full flavored brew, with a lingering bitter hoppy aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with a nice coating mouthfeel and good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth, goes down easy and quite sessionable. I think this is one of the better APA's around, another good beer from Schlafly!"
"D: I liked the way it finished. Not the typical bitter aftertaste that you sometimes find in this style. The hop choice was perfect."
"D - very very drinkable! I could see sharing a 12 pack with friends and everyone being quite happy with the choice."
"Pours a deep copper color. Nice white head, average retention, Decent lacing. A nice citrus aroma. Strong malt backbone but the hops shine through as one would hope. Mouthfeel is very smooth with perfect carbonation level. Very easy drinking, the growler is half gone in no time. My favorite of the regular Schlafly offerings, even better now that its dry hopped. Was great on tap earlier in the day, and still good at home in the growler."
"D: Aside from the high ABV (5.9%), this one is extremely easy to drink. The glass will go from full to empty in no time. Simply fantastic."
"Thanks, rsyberg01, for the opportunity"
"Another solid effort from this brewery. This is my third beer from this brewery, and I have not been disappointed."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and carbonated. Very drinkable."
"This was a nice bitter beer with some things going on in the background once you got past the initial shock of the bitterness. This probably does not fit in the session beer category as it is 5.9% alcohol and would take a lot of work after a couple. I would like to try the on tap version."
"D- Nothing to write home about, but it does go down easy. I'mnot sure I would want that initial aroma to hit me all night long though."
"Another enjoyable offering from my favorite St. Louis brewery... Infinitely preferable to patronizing you-know-who."
"Slightly hazed amber pour with a nice sized white head. Slightly earthy, musty orange like hop aroma. Nice mild, earthy hop flavor as well, with similar malt qualities to the Schlafly pilsner. Orange noticed in the taste as well. A nice pale ale overall."
"Top notch APA. Another winner from Schlafly."
"D - 4 Very easy to drink, definitely a go-to beer for me"
"Drinkability- Would really like to try this fresh from the tap one of these days."
"If you happen to be at the Tap Room and this is available do not pass it up."
"D: Easy drinking so no problem there, very sessionable and if you are in the saint louis area there is probably no better local beer of this style out there but just a little bit of a let down."
"This beers pours a hazy burnt orange color with a nice white head that sticks around, leaving a fair amount of lacing. The smell is citrus and pine hops. The taste is very hoppy with bitterness that hits the middle of the tongue and sticks around for a while. A hint of malt backbone, but the hops are the stars of the show. The mouthfeel was a just a bit thinner than medium. All around, a very good representative of the style."
"I like the drinkability here so I am going to rate it pretty high. Would like to go to St. LOuis someday and try this fresh from the barrels."
"Good citrusy hop aroma with a little hint of yeast. Creamy mouthfeel. Some caramelly malt to start off with followed by a solid American hop bitterness. Good balance, very drinkable beer."
"A medium copper color with a cream colored head three inches thick, incredible retention. A slightly malty scent at the front, that is soon followed by a strong floral aroma and the scent of sweet citrus, like an orange. The malt strikes the palate at the start, and stays with there till it reaches halfway. That is when a citrus flavors of lemon and mild grapefruit takeover. Those flavors blend to grassy, earthy finish. A bit of a watery start on the feel, it gains weight as it crosses the palate, to a more medium bodied feel. An easy drinking beer, very strong aroma and solid flavor, plus the low alchol, make this an excellent session beer."
"This wasn't the freshest sample of this beer, having been bottled on 9-27-07. It was still a solid enough pale ale and I would love to try a fresher bottle sample."
"Medium bodied, very easy to drink and somehow makes you want another. Another great brew from Schlafly."
"Found this on sale for $5.49 for a sixer. At this price, a great value. Not sure if I would make it a regular rotation at its regular $7.99 price, but I will not be averse to buying more."
"The taste has a good balance of piney hops, spice, and pale malts. It's not overly flavorful, but for a Pale Ale, it's better hop-wise than alot of IPA's I've come across. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect for the style, with a crisp, spiced (albeit a bit thin) body that's both refreshing and appropriately carbonated. The aftertaste leaves a lasting, delightfully spicy & bitter hop finish. Drinkability is a bit limited, simply by the fact that I'd go for a hoppier beer (IIPA or otherwise) if given the choice, but this is an easy brew to consume and one I'd buy again without hesitation."
"Schlafly gives Alpha King a run for it's money..."
"Drinks too easy, nice APA"
"Sample at the Lambert St. Louis airport location (as Expedition Reserve). Clear amber-orange color with a thin off-white head that dissipates steadily. Stringy lacing. Aroma of floral hops and citrus. Medium body with flavors of floral hops, citrus and toasted malt. The finish is moderately hoppy and fruity and lingers awhile. Pretty good overall."
"Schlafly Dry-Hopped American Pale Ale is one of those beers that should be consumed uber fresh for maximum enjoyment. It's still pretty good months after bottling and is a beer that I'd love to see locally."
"Many, many thanks to Vancer for this brew. Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Pours a murky orange, with a huge, off-white rocky head. Smells of west coast hops. Taste is Highly hoppy, distinctly dry hopped with piney, citrus flavors, as well as a good malt backbone. Not especially bitter, most of the hoppyness is from the aroma and flavor. Mouthfeel is good, good carbonation levels. It would be easy to drink a few of these."
"Poured into a snifter. Appearance is a slightly cloudy straw with orange-like hues. Aroma is of citrus with hints of bread. Taste is slightly bitter a little pine and grapefruit and a light biscuit malt profile. The finish is dry and a little chalky. Body is in the medium range. Overall an easy drinking APA, with no spectacular or horrible qualities."
"d: For a beer that's all about the hops, this one is very drinkable. It is not balanced well with malt, but because most of the hops are from dry hopping, the bitterness is not too bad. This APA makes for a good hop dominated session beer."
"Courtesy of someone cool. Mostly citrus accented hop aroma. Strong, but not overbearing along with some lightly sweet malt notes. The body is a hazy yellow and holds a small, tight, white head. Sweet malt and citrus hop fore. Low bitterness, but high hop flavor. Faint hints of caramel. Nice sipper."
"Drinkability: Well, it is a good drinking APA but is not very strong with its aroma. I find this strange buecause the bottle claims this is dry hopped. What's up with that? Anyway, this is a very medial pale ale that is drinkable but not worth seeking out specifically."
"Overall, this is an above average example of the style. Well built with an intentional nod to hop prominence. Solid, easy drinking beer from a brewery that I have come to appreciate."
"Pours a murky burnt copper with a fluffy one finger off white head that slowly dies to a nice layer. Stickiness is pretty good, spotty lacing all over. Smell is a dirty citrus hop with a sweet evergreen pine scent. Very little caramel malt in the nose, but it's there. Taste is a clean but sweet citrus up front with a dry grassy hop flavor aftertaste. Creamy light body with a mild carbonation. Very easy going down, wish I had another one. Definitely a nice hoppy pale ale that's worth a try."
"Ale pours a golden yellow with a substantial 1"" head. Aroma has mild flowery hops. Delicious bitterness up front with plenty of chewy malt. Nice citrus aftertaste. Smooth and extremely drinkable. I could drink 3 or 4 with no problem. Another fine brew from Schlafly, this is a definite repeat purchase !"
"5.7% brew, a slow sipper, and it went well with some home made fajitas."
"Found a sixpack of this at one of the Schnuck's grocery stores in Evansville. Pours a hazy amber body with a large offwhite head. Lots of clingy patch lacing. Aroma is leafy grassy hops backed by citrus and red apples. Light medium body with crisp carbonation. Taste opens with a leafy green hops bitterness that lasts throughout but is quickly joined by a note of McIntosh red apple fruitiness that really sets this ale apart. Toasty caramel maltiness is subtle but balances quite well. Comes off as a very well balanced APA that is light enough to session. A really pleasant surprise here."
"D - This is a great APA. It has the powerful hoppiness of a DIPA but it much lighter and very refreshing."
"D: this makes for a great summer time session beer under the ol' oak tree."
"pours a really pretty light amber color but looks a lot like a lager. has a decent white cloudy head on it as well, smells great, for the first time in a beer i smell distinctly apples, and actually granny smith apples, has a tartness to it that i can really discern. has some hoppy scents to it as well, tastes great, like a toned down ipa but with some malt thrown in, a very well balanced and tasty beer, a slight bitterness with a malty touch, very good beer, try it if you can get get some!"
"This is a really good sessionable APA. I had to ask if this was different than their earlier APA and was told yes. After tasting, I could tell it was different and better. Enjoy."
