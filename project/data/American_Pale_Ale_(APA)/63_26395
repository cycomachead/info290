Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear tawny amber topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises grapefruit zest, orange zest, pine resin, light grass, and a healthy amount of caramel.  The taste brings in more of the same, though the resin takes a stronger position here.  Luckily, the caramel balances things out rather well.  The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.  Overall, a very nice, well-balanced, hoppy pale ale.  Not bad at all.","TMoney2591","Feb 03, 2015"

If you find it in sixers (which I imagine is how its sold) and want a good sessionable IPA or APA pick this one up. I'm having a hard time analyzing it as it is going fast.

This is so focused on the caramel malt aroma and flavor that the hops just don't play much of a role. I know this is billed as a APA instead of a IPA, but with a name like "Hop Trip", I expected much more complexity from the hops. Instead, the malt dominates and is just too sweet in my opinion to let the rest of the flavors play a role. Mouthfeel is fair, and appearance is quite nice actually, but again, I leave disappointed.","DeFaz","Nov 20, 2014"

Aroma of caramel malt, piney hops, tropical and light citrus fruit. Flavor is rich caramel malt, resiny pine and citrus hops, light orange citrus and mixed fruit. Medium bodied, nice for a pale ale. One of the ales that straddles the border between pale ales and IPAs. Not as intensely hoppy as many current IPAs, but well and freshly hopped with a substantial malt body. Great balance and flavor. I'm not a regular pale ale drinker and so I've missed this in the past. I will definitely pick this up again. A stellar APA.","LiquidAmber","Nov 16, 2014"

The nose starts you a little strangely, with a curious tartness, but offers up fresh hoppiness alongside a toasty, gentle malt bill to see you through.  This six-pack was purchased as our “sippin beers” for the night, for an easy, hoppy beverage.  Being in St. Louis for the next couple days, we were looking for a local IPA to keep the background noise at bay.  We settled on this, however, with Deschutes having a proven track record, and a shiny façade.  While we’re happy with the decision and are still excited for the remaining four bottles, this, too, did not blow us away.  I suppose expectations got the better of us here, as we were hoping for an even more hoppy showing, but this remained nicely fresh and approachable.","TheBrewo","Nov 03, 2014"

4.66,12.6,4.5,4.75,4.5,5,4.75,"Pours out a hazy orange body with a frothy head. Smells like some funky hops. Oniony, citrusy, piney. I get some caramel and toasted bread from the malts and a touch of fruitiness from the yeast. Taste is way bigger on citrus rind than I would have imagined. I don't get as much funkiness in the flavor as I do in the nose, but those huge orange, tangerine, and grapefruit notes and delicious. Malt is certainly there, providing a sweet background with some caramel and toasted malts. Toast doesn't go overboard. My only complaint in the taste is that the sweetness can get to be a bit too much. Very minimal bitterness. Mouthfeel is about perfect for what the flavors bring. Creamy and a little fluffy, but, when left in the mouth, the carbonation picks up and strips the tongue of the hop resins. This is a great beer. It's hard to put down.","goochpunch","Nov 14, 2013"

4.33,4.6,4,4,4.5,4.25,4.5,"yes! love wet hop stuff, and this is only my second of the year, but a real gem, much anticipated and does not disappoint. it has a perfectly clear pour, radiant, glowing red, caramel in color, over an inch of off white head, but it fades rather quickly. the nose is just lovely, really hoppy, clean, and well supported by a slightly richer malt profile than I expected. pine on the hops, toffee sweetness on the grains. the flavor agrees, but I am surprised how well the bitterness of the fresh hops cuts through what would otherwise be a rather sweet grain bill I assume. its great balance, still hop forward, refreshing, and unique. not sure what varietals are used, but I don't remember wet hop beer being quite so bitter an pungent, I always thought more sweet, floral, and understated, but not this one. similar citrus and drinkability to founders all day, and I really would drink this all day everyday if it were available, its that good, so fresh! very drinkable with a light feel despite the color. a little still, it could use just a tad more carbonation, but I like the way it sits in my mouth. its the essence of the fall season for me, and yet another highly refined and expertly done brew from Deschutes.","StonedTrippin","Oct 11, 2013"

4.35,5.1,4,4,4.5,5,4.25,"Pours a dark, amberish orange color with a finger of an off white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a thick ring of lacing. Nice carbonation. Smells of resinous, dank, and grassy fresh hops. Get some herbal characteristics, along with pine, sugary grapefruit, tiny bit of tangerine, and plenty of floral. A very nice, clean carmel malt is detected as well. Taste immediately starts with a resinous, grassy hop flavor, but is quickly balanced out by a sugary grapefruit flavor. The middle continues the sweetness, this time bringing a carmel sweetness. This is balanced with more resinous, herbal hop qualities, along with some grapefruit and tangerine. The finish is really good and makes this beer. Get more resinous qualities, but are more of the bitter variety. This bitterness is tame, however, and is accompanied with more intense notes of grapefruit, grass, and tropical fruits. It seems to start off with more fresh hop qualities and finishes with more juicy, fruity hop qualities. All the while balanced with a sweet, clean, and bready malt backbone. Very clean, crisp, and surprisingly full mouthfeel for a pale ale. Although it has a fuller body, it still drinks likes a session ale and leaves you wanting more. A very well-crafted fresh hop pale ale. I wish the hop harvest was year round because this is awesome.","brewskis","Oct 10, 2013"

Strong sweet grapefruit and tangerine absolutely dominate the olfactory senses, ontop a nice caremel malt base. Taste is sweet and fruity; a supportive caramel malt underbelly letting the hops steal the show -- the tangerine hits first, it transitions gracefully into the grapefruit and a little grass bitterness closes things out. A crisp, active moutfheel. Overall, Deschutes with another great beer. So glad I have 5 more bottles of this in my fridge.","denver10","Oct 06, 2012"

Also, I read somewhere that the hops they use are from a farm about 20 minutes from where I grew up in Oregon, so that has some value to me. This probably isn't a "must have world class beer" but I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a nice pale ale with hoppy aromatics. It's good. And it's a good trend to support. Worth trying for sure. Also, on a side note, I was very excited to see this in a six pack in the bay area. A 22 oz bottle of pale ale just doesn't make as much sense to me. 12 oz at a time is the way to go for this beer, in my opinion. Cheers.","olfolxholme","Nov 19, 2011"

Overall this beer is unbalanced, but sometimes that can be a good thing. I can see this beer pairing with certain foods very well as a slow sipper. Hop Trip and a blackened steak would be heaven.

The sensory qualities, particularly those delivered by the hops, were sadly under-represented at the tap (but appearance did count for something extra in that case). The bottled beer added much of what seemed to be missing from the draft experience, with a mostly floral hop presence. This beer changes every year, which is fine in an ephemeral and artisanal product such as a wet hop ale, but here the variance encountered in the different forms of packaging seemed noteworthy for their distinctness.

I get some fruity flavors in there but not the bitter ones it's all sweet like super ripe oranges and spring flowers. A bit of spice comes in there too which I appreciate.

It's a terrific, clean, very balanced taste, but being a Fresh Hop Ale, the hops just don't shine. This is one of the smoothest APA's I've had, a very, probably dangerously sessionable beer. In fact, I'd love to see this beer as a replacemet to Mirror Pond, or see it as it's own, sadly, I don't believe dry hops could produce the awesome, albeit small, hop flavors it does have.","iammatt","Nov 28, 2009"

Smells true to style, which IMO doesn't have all that much going for it...roasted malts with a nicely balanced hoppy character. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied and creamy...a really good combination. Full malt flavor with an excellent hop sidekick. At 5.5% ABV this one is a real nice drinker.

Frothy off-white head barely breaks one finger even with a somewhat vigorous pour and lacing is there but not overly thick. Surprisingly sweet malt aroma with clean floral hops and and blood orange coming through. Taste is not what I typically expect from a fresh hop but I have to say I'm impressed. The resin sticks to the teeth in a way that lets you know there really are some wet hops in there. The malts are just sweet enough to create a nice balance for the hops. Speaking of the hops, they start mellow and floral and increase their bitterness as the taste slowly works it's way towards the finish making it's way through sweet blood orange to stop briefly at grapefruit to end with some full-on rind. If there's a "flaw" in this beer it's in the feel, and it's a minor one. The carbonation is a little light and the overall presentation is a little on the thin and watery side. Seriously a small price to pay. All in all an excellent fresh hop pale ale that I wish was more readily available on the east coast.","Med","Nov 10, 2008"

Lots of juicy tangerine aroma, soft floral hops, grapefruit, and a sweet caramel malt backbone.

This aroma is very fragrant, with minty tones coming through. There's some nice hop resin aroma as well, but it all comes back to this minty aroma. Interesting to say the least. I notice a nice firm body when I begin to taste this elixir. The carbonation is appropriately moderate. The flavor hits me with hops and a little malt all at once. This isn't overly hoppy (and I believe it is only 35 IBUS to my surprise), but it's a nice tasting beer nonetheless. The fragrant minty aromas are translated right over to the palate. The malt base is heavy on the caramel malts. The bitterness level is quite low. This is a nice tasting nicely balanced beer.

Good stickiness, nice webbing on all sides of the glass. Smell is a clean and slick citrus hop of mostly fresh pink grapefruit. A hint of caramel malt appears in the nose as well. Not an overpowering scent at all, very pleasant and enjoyable to sniff. Big oily citrus hops up front with a tiny hint of dry grassy hops midway through. Aftertaste is extremely clean with a lemongrass like flavor that lasts. Mouthfeel is amazing. That's the one thing I've noticed with all these "Fresh Hop" style ales. They all have a fluffy light mouthfeel with a nice mild carbonation. Probably second in line to Great Divide's Fresh Hop Pale Ale.

There is a light, honey-like sweetness that is actually quite pleasant. Not cloying at all.

It pours a hazy orange with a nice creamy head topping it off. It does not have much aroma, a slight citrus smell is all I picked up. The initial flavor is a tingling hop sensation that coats my tongue, but not at all overpowering. This beer is very easy to drink while still having a substantial flavor and mouthfeel.

The taste began moderately fruity and bitter, followed by much carbonation and a quick finish....starts like an IPA but ends like a Pale Ale. Mouthfeel was dominated by high carbonation and a mild - medium, not too lingering, dryness. Overall, I think the drinkability was exceptional.

The low ABV adds to the drinkability.My first thought was to go back to the store and buy the remaining bottles, so I did. This is one of the best Pale Ales I've had in a long time.

What really makes this beer shine is it's mouthfeel. Perhaps this is where it's 'youth' comes out, as it has a softness across the palate that adds a just-right light touch to the overall character of the brew.

3.92,-5.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4," Pours a pretty orange-amber color topped by an inch of creamy, off-white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. Inviting aroma of piney, lightly fruity hops, light caramel malt, and a whiff of grapefruit and pineapple. Palate is well-balanced, with the lightly sweet caramel malt complementing the tasty, assertive hops. Notes of pine and grapefruit are detectable, as is a little bit of maple(?). Body is a bit lacking in carbonation, but is nevertheless sturdy enough to convey the ample flavor quite well. If this were available fresh year-round, I'd drink it fairly often. Alas, it's a once-a-year treat that appears to lose its punch pretty fast. Grab it while you can, and make sure it's fresh.","ElGordo","Oct 20, 2006"
3.95,-4.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Tastes like oranges drizzled with caramel and good mint sauce. Stick aftertaste, but a nice lemongrass and ginger flavor helps keep the mouthfeel interesting. Free flowing carbonation also break up the honey cake aftertaste.","gbontrag","Apr 05, 2006"

Theres some citrus quality to the aroma, but there are other fruits in there too (apple-pear maybe?), along with some gentle herbal notes. The flavors are of mild fruit (orange, tangerine, peach, MacIntosh apple), medium caramel malt, and the smallest touch of pine resin. Low to medium bitterness, which again, is unlike most of the beers of this style that Ive tried. A welcome change of pace. Very well made and very complex.","fisherman34","Dec 16, 2005"

3.5,-15.5,4,4,3,5,3,"Pours a one finger dark tan head over a cloudy copper liquid. Smells citrusy hops during the pour. To the nose, it's butterscotch, caramel, apricot, grapefruit pith, and some orange oil. Tastes malty, but dry. Like oodles of munich malt was used. Flat grassy, but I think not from the hops, I think it's the malt. Woody dry hops with a hint of oranges. No grapefruit or pith to be detected and hop bitter is mild at best. Huh, that description matches how Goldings taste to me and I don't see how Goldings would be used as the hops in an APA. No fruity esters. Instead I taste pot-roast beef, deep and flat, late in the taste. I'm not impressed. Nice body for an APA, it's md-thick with a chewy quality. Moderate carbonation that forms bubbles on the flat of the tongue, but that do not detract from the flavors. Towards the end, the hops do become apparent as a mild, but persistant chalky dryiness. Overall, I'm not fond of the taste of this beer, but the other qualities are quite good.","mentor","Nov 27, 2005"

This poured a medium amber and the head lasted all the way down and left plenty of lacing on the way. Nice piney fresh hop taste and that is the point right? This beer is made with fresh or wet hops. The "fresh" taste was there but not quite as up front as I had hoped, I'm sure on tap this is a killer. Good though with a nice malt backbone as well. Just a bit teasing. Mouthfeel, didn't know how to rate it because this is the most full bodied pale I have ever had. Mixed feelings but had to rate it high as it was not only thickish but had a very creamy feel as well.

It smells more like many of the superior NW IPA's than a pale ale. Unusually this tastes justs as the nose suggests. It has a very full flavour for a pale ale and decent carbonation.

4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"22-oz. bomber purchased from Bottleworks in Seattle. Poured into a large pint glass, this has a nice light copper color with a thin but persistent head. Smell- and taste-wise this is like the beer equivalent of a Sauvignon Blanc, what with it's fresh green grass, melon, pineapple, herbaceous, woodsy, and slightly mineral-tinged profile. The raw green leafiness of the hops is especially prevalent in the nose, and the pineapple/melon flavors are more noticable in the taste, probably because of the sugars from the sturdy malt backbone kicking in. Finishes fairly sweet, would prefer a bit more dryness, but this is a unique beer and a good one.","bultrey","Nov 07, 2005"

I thought, "Kinda weak for a beer named Hop Trip." But then I realized that this is supposed to be a hoppy pale ale. It has a nice hoppy bouquet, not over powering, just perfect. The hops and malt are balanced perfectly, leaning twords hops. A little is left to be desired at the end, but another swallow cures that. The beer has a slight carbonation and an excellent mouthfeel, not to watery and not to thick. I think this beer is perfect for many meals when you feel like smething a little lighter.
