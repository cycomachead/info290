The malts have a caramel note that dominates but mixes well with the earthy hop notes. The taste is similar to the smell with a sweet caramel malt flavor mixing with an earthy and bitter hop taste. Also, there is a slight citrus taste surrounding the bitter hops and malts. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium but on the heavier side.

Malt backbone is bigger than I had anticipated with some residual sugar notes. Body is about average with good carbonation.

Each sip is enjoyable...  Overall this one is a rock solid APA...  I'm not 1/2 way through the Beer Camp Across America collection and this one is the leader in the club house at this point...

Aroma of biscuit and caramel malt, grassy and citrus hops. Flavor is citrus, lightly piney hops with a bit of resin, caramel malt with some biscuit, finishes with interesting light fruit juice mixed with citrus hops and biscuit malt. Medium bodied with hints of creaminess. Quite malty for a pale ale, and with the moderately dark copper color, more in an amber ale territory. Hops are muted, but have a good mixture of flavors. I really liked the finish with the combination of light fruit and hop flavors.","LiquidAmber","Aug 11, 2014"

Has some west coast hops on the nose, grapefruit galore but still has that SN malt backbone. Flavor profile is almost the same way. Dry citrus/piney hops, a nice malt profile, solid mouthfeel, but here is my problem with this brew. I'm a huge FFF fan because they hop the living sh*t out of their beer. So when I was FFF, i totally expected a hop forward beer. Don't get me wrong, this is high in alpha hops but I would never guess, never ever, that this is a FFF brew. I feel like SN is just holding them down here. That being said, it's a solid pale ale and will hold me over till my next beer trade where I can get some real FFF!","bneel317","Aug 06, 2014"

Its a wonderful beer with bright floral and fruity notes. The balance between hops and malts is very present in this beer. I get strong notes of citrus and fruit, with a wonderful flavor of fresh herbs and malt to round it out. This beer is bold without a doubt, but it achieves it without throwing loads of hops in there. It adds wonderful bright fruit flavor with just the right amount of robust malts to give it a confident body. I really love this beer!","AyeMito","0"

This beer is pretty disappointing due to the extremely high expectations I had. It would have undoubtedly been better if it were a little fresher - come on, Sierra Nevada, you should have brewed the hoppier collaborations right before packaging.

On the other hand, it doesn't taste much like a modern Pale Ale. In fact, this reminds me a good bit of an amber or even a Sam Adams Boston Lager. Not assertively hopped, with a relatively mild flavor profile for the APA style. In short, I just don't think this quite fits into the APA category, at least not when you consider modern examples like Fat Head's Trail Head or Three Floyds Zombie Dust. A good beer overall, but as malt-forward as it is, it's more of an antiquated example of the style.","siege06nd","Jul 27, 2014"

This is once again very well balanced and completely in keeping with what I expect of the style. Mouthfeel is moderately full bodied with a nice but not overpowering level of carbonation.

Aromas of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate caramel/bready malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, light toast, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, light toast, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of citrus/grassy hops and moderate caramel/bready malt sweetness; with a nice crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice and pleasant pale ale. Good balance and complexity of citrus/grassy hops and moderate caramel/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

The brew smells like caramel and bready malt, nuts, and some light earthy/herbal hops. It tastes similar to the aroma, but there's also some light fruitiness noticeable. To me it's more malty than hoppy, maltier than I expect for a pale ale. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy, smooth and easy to drink. Moderate carbonation.

3,-17.1,3,3,3,3,3,"A have heard so much about Three Floyds. But I will have to say this one was a bit of a disappointment. Someone said an English style Pale Ale. That's about right. Bass maybe, the carbonation on this one was a bit flat and there was virtually no aroma in the smell. More malt than hop forward. I have had a few pale ales lately that have done very little for me. I can say that this one is right in line. Maybe I just don't care for this style. This was my first one and out of the pack because I had heard so much about Three Floyds and I am sure this is not as representative as their original stuff, but this beer was a solid alright. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. On the the next one!","humuloner22","0"

Grassy hops hit you at first taste, you get a heavy bitterness, followed by a malty taste at the very end. There is a nice touch to the bitter aftertaste with hints of apple.

3.58,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured a very nice deep, cloudy amber with three fingers of fluffy white head that slowly receded to a cap of white leaving copious amounts of lacing down the glass. A very nice looking pale ale. Scents of yeasty white bread at first, giving way to tropical fruit, mostly light pineapple-like aromas, orange flesh, orange peel, a bit of overripe fruit, and some pale malt in the background. The overall impression of the aroma is light, but layered with fruity and malty aromas dominating. Nice, though not as good as expected. Flavor begins with a nice balanced hop bitterness with notes of pine resin, toasty and sweet pale malt flavors, and citrus peel. The middle opens with more citrus peel flavors, some floral and earthy hop notes, hints of pine resin and a bit of toasted malt. Finish is medium-dry with notes of bitter grapefruit and citrus peel, hints of pine resin, some floral and earthy hop flavors and a hint of toasted malt with a very light alcohol presence. A nice hoppy pale ale flavor profile with an abundance of fruity and resinous flavors, leaning more towards citrus peel and pine resin, but balanced with some faint floral and earthy flavors and a bit of malt. Quite nice, though a bit one note overall. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with low carbonation, and a smooth, slightly slick feel. Quite easy to drink and very pleasant. Overall this is a decent pale ale that reminds me a great deal of Sierra Nevada's classic. The 3 Floyds influence is hard to discern however and overall it does just feel like a slightly different take on SNPA.","Auraan","Jul 22, 2014"

Medium head, a couple shades of tan off white. Fine foam shot through with some larger bubbles. Pretty good retention, just a bit of lacing. The aroma is mild. There's some pine and citrus hoppiness along with a dose of caramel-ish malt. Hops win out with a mix of grapefruit, pine, lemon, tangerine, pineapple. It's nice enough. Taste is similarly mild with more hop than malt character. The malt is just a background of caramel with some light toastiness. On the dry side of things. Hops are pine resin, tangerine, lemon, berry and pineapple. It's all pleasant and quite mild. A little bit of spice in the finish. Nothing wrong with it, but eh. Mouthfeel is pretty standard pale ale fare, maybe a touch creamier than most. Decent enough pale ale but quite boring. I don't get it. I was already fully aware that these two breweries could make decent easy drinking pales. This feels like a waste, particularly as a single bottle in a mixed 12-pack. It's like they set out to craft a flagship pale ale for a brewery starting up in the '80s. Beer doesn't get much safer than this.","popery","Jul 17, 2014"
