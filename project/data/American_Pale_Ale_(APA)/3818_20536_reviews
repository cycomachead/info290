"I was able to have this as a nitro handle at Town Hall in Cleveland and it became a completely different animal of smoothness.  I wish I could go back and have a full tasting note to share."

"Taste starts with sweet stale crackers, then floral hops, moving on to floury bread with a sweet, bready, grassy hop finish. Feel is medium-light, very creamy for how light it is with a touch of breadiness. Higher than average carbonation is what you would expect/want for this style."

"Wow this surprised me. A - rich golden color. S - hoppy, I'm still undecided about IPA's so I'm hesitant.  T - smooth malt flavor with hints of hop notes. Bites at the end but pleasurable. M - Thick but goes down fast. O - 3 hops instead of 2 with the farmers tan, yet a touch more subtle. Makes up for it with a dry end, it surprised me how good it tasted."
"One of my new favorite IPA's. If you've had a farmers tan by southern tier it's similar. Not to hoppy of an IPA and it goes down very easy. I'm just getting into IPA's and this is a good one. Smooth taste and mouthfeel. Will be buying this again. New fan"

"12 oz bottle. Pours deep golden with short lived, fluffy white head. Aroma is of citrusy, piney hops and biscuit malt. Body is medium and crisp. Herbal, piney hops dominate the flavor while pale malt provide some balance. Finish is long and dry. Ordinary Ale."

"Calling it an Extraordinary Ale may be an overstatement but it is very well balanced and just plain good."

"A very good beer. The appearance is a nice hazy yellow with a nice cream colored head. The smell was full of hops and malt. The taste was great with hints of citrus taking a back seat to the malt and just a very satisfying brew. It isn't a weird or terribly complex beer but it is well balanced and incredibly satisfying. All in all, a very nice beer that I would recommend to someone looking to get into craft beer as an intro into how much better beer can be than the standards."

"O: Not the most focused effort. The hops really run away with the show here. Still, you can get away with that these days. People are happy with one-dimensional, hoppy beers. And it stays drinkable enough to forgive this."
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was decent beer and it's fairly close to being an average American Pale Ale, it had some nice balance to it, but I didn't think that the malts and the hops clashed a little and I don't think they blended together as well as they could have. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, crisp and clean, but the taste didn't do the greatest job at holding my attention so I think a one or two would be enough for me since it doesn't really keep me coming back for more. What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and balance, I thought they were both pretty nice and worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the drinkability, it just didn't keep me coming back for more. I might recommend this beer to someone who likes Pale Ales that aren't that bitter, but I don't think that it will really stand out in the style for most people. I don't think I would go out of my way to buy this again, but I might order it at a bar if I saw it on draft. All in all I did't think this beer was that great, but it wasn't that bad either, it was kind of right in the middle and it didn't really have anything about it that made it stand out. Better luck next time Southern Tier, this beer just wasn't that memorable."

"A rather run of the mill basic pale ale, but drinkable with nothing too off putting."

"Pours a golden amber with a small short lived white head. Aroma and Taste of biscuit malt, citrus notes, some yeast and citrus floral hops. A medium crisp body on the palate with some good carbonation. Finish is biscuit malt, a bit of grains and cereal notes with some citrus flavor and floral citrus hops balance. A bit more lager than ale. Overall a good refreshing"

"O- I remember liking this beer a lot more when I first had it several years ago. Maybe I should have tried to find a fresher bottle for my review."

"Appearance is good, A golden light amber color. Smell is OK, not very strong. A little citrus a little pine. Not a whole lot going on with that. Taste is little better then the the smell. You get the same things, with a litte grapefruit bitterness from the hops and some bready taste from the malts. Mouthfeel is good, light and crisp. This a good beer for today since I've been busting my @$$ in the yard today and it's the hottest it's been all year."
""
""
""
"Pours clear and light. Copper/gold with a fingers worth of foam that fell fast but left a skin and hung around on the sides of the glass. Spritzy looking with constant bubbles rising from the bottom. Nose is floral and herbal. Light orange and lemon citrus.A little pine, grass and corn. There’s even a touch of musty basement. Malt is bread and plenty of caramel. Taste is clean and smooth. Malt is cereal, bread, dough & caramel. Hops are light but stay with the nose. Slightly sticky mouthfeel and a lingering sweetness. Semi dry, creamy and very easy to drink. I thought this was a pleasant and easy to drink ale and while it wasn’t really extraordinary, you could drink a few of these."

"Poured from tap at tap and mallet in Rochester ny. Pours an orangey golden color. Looks like a run of the mill pale ale. Subtle hop aroma and bready malt. Taste is crisp bready malt - biscuit I guess with a nice hop balance. Easy drinker but a bit bitter and dry finish almost tanic. Its a solid brew just not my fav."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Extraordinary? Maybe not, but I could see this as a staple-like brew with the likes of a SNPA."
""
""
""
"O - The aroma is distinctly similar to a saison. More of an English hop emphasis with solid balance. Little sweet in the taste. Very drinkable good brew but a bit out of APA style. Not sure whether to grade it well for uniqueness or poor versus typical APAs."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light copper with a thin layer of head that dissipated almost immediately. This offering had a mildly hoppy and floral nose. The flavor is relatively thin with some dry hoppiness on the finish. This is a mediocre pale ale that is certainly not bad, but not even close to superb either."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a clear golden color with, initially, a decent and frothy off-white head, diminishes quickly, fair lacing. Aroma is pale malts, caramel, bread, citrus and maybe a hint of pine. Flavor is bread and caramel malts, pine, grass, and a little bit of yeast. Mouthfeel is light-to-medium, a little watery, and a bitter finish. Easy drinking beer, not very complicated."
"Overall, a sessionable beer but also a bit flavorless. Founders and Lagunitas both make great ""session"" IPA's with less alcohol but tons more flavor. While I know this isn't technically a session beer it is quite refreshing but lacking all around."
""
""
""
""
""
"Average finger’s worth of just off-white foam, full mix of bubble sizes, lots of dimpling but decent retention, the lacing is thin but spreads into broad sheets and sticks nicely. Bright yellowish gold color with a touch of zinc or rust to deepen it, crystal clear with only a few random bubbles visible, looks kinda adjuncty. The nose is grainy with a strong pepper component, also offers pizza crusts, cornmeal and some orange to lemon citrus to sweeten it up, same for the vague apricot, peach fruit accents, becomes leafier and greener as it warms. Medium-bodied, has some prickle to it and seemingly intentional bitter bite, on the hoppy side for an APA. Then it has the resinous feel without the pine flavor. More of the pepper, rye to pumpernickel bread, mineral water and with larger presence of savory garden herbs than flowers. The tartness suggests a space reserved for grapefruit citrus and more tropical like pineapple, nectarine, papaya fruit but the chair left empty. Its overall dryness tends to distract, not that it lacks flow but you start getting bitter beer face."

"O- nice and light, enough flavor to let you know it's their but still easy drinking pale ale"
""
"O – This is a pretty good pale ale. The hop profile is interesting. It’s pretty tough to pick out all of the individual aromas and flavors. It’s very different than any other APA that I’ve had, and unfortunately not in a great way. It’s not a bad beer by any stretch, but something about the aroma and flavor just seems “off,” and I can’t really put my finger on what it is. Regardless, it is a drinkable and refreshing beer and I’m glad that I tried it."

"Overall: Southern Tier is the pride of NY, and this beer is nothing less than I'd expect from them. Although nowhere near their best offering, it's very drinkable with above average flavor. There's a reason why this company is successful."
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle; clear and golden witha thin white head that fades to a nice ring of foam. Smell isn't much; light bready malts with some slight hops in the background. Taste is clean malts, with just a twang of hop flavor to finish it off crisply. Nothing complex here, but a tasty and drinkable pale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The body was spot on, but I found everything kind of underwhelming. I will pass in the future."
""
""
""
"Overall a beer I always enjoy. Although often looked over it never lets me down. Great for those making the transition from pilsner to IPA."
""
""
""
"a less hoppy american pale, pouring a clear yellow color with a spiderweb lacey white head an inch high. the nose is light crystal and pale malts, dry and bready, with a mild fruity hopping. flavor is the same, nothing too intriguing here, but a very balanced and fresh tasting brew with some cut grass notes in the finish. crisp and clean, drinkable and refreshing, a sessionable brew. lots of bubbles, light light body. i wouldnt buy this because it isnt my type, but its yummy and down easy with a bowl of chili con carne."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled in July 2012. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, pine, pineapple, bread, grass, herbal, and floral. Pretty nice aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of pineapple, grapefruit, orange zest, floral, grass, pine, bread, and herbal. Light crisp bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, grass, pine, herbal, floral, and bread on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of flavors, with a good hop/malt balance; a bit watery but still tasty; no cloying flavors at all on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very crisp and clean mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale ale. Good hop flavor profile with nice balance; extremely crisp and smooth to drink. An enjoyable and sessionable offering I would have no problem getting again."
"O- I like the balance of this beer neither extreme, nor dull. Well rounded and easy to have a number of if you have that thirst."
""
"Overall – A quite pleasant brew. Wonderfully smooth and delicious. A great easy drinking and crisper brew."
""
""
"I would have no problem drinking this at some chain restaraunt or a backyard party or down the shore if Saqndy leaves any."

"Pale golden body was clear, and the head was a two finger thick layer of foam. The aroma was grainy and slightly vegetal with a dash of piney hops. The taste was oddly sour which was followed by a nondescript bitterness from the hops. The body felt refreshing and light with the tangy sourness helping the beer go down easy. Not a bad beer to accompany some food or when enjoying a game with a friend."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma. There was great fruitiness and tartness, making the drinker quite excited to sample. We felt that those flavors needed to pop more through the taste. What flavor was there was warm and spicy, but just so subdued by the end that we’ll probably reach for something else next."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured light golden color with about a finger of suds. Smelled a bit malty with some topical fruits and pine. Taste was light with nice carbonation, slightly sweet up front with hint of bitterness, flavor of pine, grapefruit hop finish. Very easy to drink, well balanced ale."
""
"Very bold of Phin & Matt to call this ""extraordinary"" when it is clearly not. The typical ""would not seek out again but wouldn't turn down if offered"" type of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When i poured this beer, it has a hazy golden/orange color body with not head just a thin lace around edge of the glass. The smell has a slight hop aroma and some malt also. The taste has a nice pine flavor from the hops and on the back of the tongue the malt come in to play. The mouth feel is nice and smooth goes down nice. Overall this is a average APA, but very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad beer, but not really extraordinary either (regardless of the name). I tend to like a bit more of a hop presence in a pale ale. Perhaps my bottle was a bit old."
"Overall, they totally nailed the look, aroma and mouthfeel. The flavor is just not happening, though there's nothing flawed."
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and just on the edge of being sessionable (might be a little too high in ABV and too intense in flavor, but not by a lot). I would definitely have this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A moderately hop beer with enough restraint on the bitterness to make for a very approchable and refreshing beer. Hop heads won't be wowed but they won't be disappointed either. Overall it has a good balance of flavors and is a good representation of the pale ale style."
""
""
"A pleasant, non offensive beer that doesn't really stand out."
""

"The current label lists this at 5.7% ABV. From the 12 oz bottle."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: drinkable but with all of the high end flavorful APAs out there this one hardly stands out and is way too simplified."
""

"this is not a flavor bomb. this is a very palatable, very sessionable ale, which is what i think the brewer was intending to do here. very nice. i would not describe this beer as extraordinary. pleasant though."

"355ml bottle. Pint glass.Enjoyed on nov´11. Golden color, crystal appearance. Crown is white, close & dense, large size bubbled with fairly good retention. Caramel malt,yeast & grassy touch to the nose. Gentle maltiness with lemony notes.Dry bitter palate balanced by sweet malts. Medium body, heavy carbonation. Smooth astringent finish & resins on the aftertaste. Drinkability is ok."

"The taste gets ya. Its pretty unique. Kinda feel like I just drank some flower beer. It has a sweetness to it that isn't too sweet or anything, but a unique flavor when teamed with the malts and hops."
"O - Phin & Matt's is pretty good. Enjoyable, tasty, and satisfying, sure. But worth the price tag? I'm not quite so sure about that. Either way, if it was on-tap somewhere for a good price I'd definitely be interested, depending on the other options available of course. 3.0"
""
"The ABV is a bit high to really pound them back to back though. Still, a good all-around choice and a generally excellent beer. Good work, Southern Tier."
"Are you kidding me? My expectations WAY exceeded what this beer delivered. Started OK. It poured a 1.5"" white head with average fade speed. The body though clear straw yellow was at least darker than the BMCs. Smell seemed like it was going to be good - with IPA strength hops and grapefruit accents. But the taste, that's where it fell down. I found this completely unmatching of the smell, rather watery, and it has a strange bitterness to it which I wouldn't liken to any tasty hop I've had. This is ""Extraordinary Ale""? Really? I genuinely like or love many of the bold flavor bomb beers Southern Tier puts out. But I just don't get this ale folks. Maybe I got a bad sample?!"
""
""
"Crisp and easy to drink."
""
""
"Sampled on February 28, 2012. The pour is golden yellow to medium amber with a small head that fizzles fast. Good clarity. The aroma is of toasted malts and floral hops. The body is light to medium with a creamy character. The taste leans more toward the hops with a touch of citrus. The toasted hops are in the flavor but it starts out slightly malty and ends almost dry. It is not as exciting as the way it is billed on the label."
""
""
""
"Clear golden color, smallish white head that leaves a light covering on top after a slow fade. Bits of lace here and there. Smell has a healthy amount of malt and carmel sweetness. Hops are citrusy and in good measure. Taste has an American tilt toward hops in the front with a nice balancing amount of malt and breadiness to keep it in check. A bit yeasty fruitiness that hangs in the finish which is clean, dry, and nicely hopped. Feel is crisp and lightly tingly with a nice medium light weight. A good sessionable, easy drinking pale ale that will go well with many good foods and good times."
""
""
"O-Not that anything should ever be judged just on name, but this really doesn't qualify as it is billed"

"Lightish body with a medium effervescence. Somewhat watery throughout. This could be a good deal better."

"Pours a deep golden yellow/orange with a 1/2 finger fluffy white head with a massively visibly carbonation. Faint citrus hops on the nose with a lemon musk wafting around. The low profile hops and funky must give it almost like a lager type smell that i cant seem to get over. A citrus tingle on the tongue, light malts, light grassy hop character, more of that grainy lager style on the taste, slight lemon bitter on the tongue. Light in body and in the mouth, big carbonation. Southern Tier makes some extraordinary ale's ... this aint one of em. I just dont get this beer at all, this is a perfect beer for a person just weaning off of BMC or drinks it regularly to try because they have similar characteristics. Man, it hurts slamming a ST beer but this beer sucks, do your self a favor and avoid it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, average at best. certainly not ""extraordinary"" by any means. maybe ""pedestrian"" or ""working mans"" ale might be a more appropriate. my scores are kind and definitely give this the benefit of the doubt. the label lists this as %5.7 ABV."
""
""
""
""

"Poured into New Belgium snifter. Soft white lacing with some nice wheaty peach color. Nose is a touch muted but opens up with some nice spearmint and orange marmalade and same on mouthfeel with some rather muted citrusy hops. Not overly hoppy but pleasant. Worth a shot."
""
""
"This is a decent APA but it's hardly complex. The flavor profile is all around subdued. I prefer ST beers that are more robust and showcase a more profound flavor profile. For the style, however, it fits in nicely."
"Ring of soapy white head, golden orange, light lace. Smell is full of citrus, orange, spicy yeast notes, firm malt backbone, lemon with grassy notes. Taste is grassy and citrusy, lemon, bready malt, mildly floral, moderate bitterness, citrus and grapefruit finish and aftertaste, drying. Medium-high carbonation, medium body, fairly oily. Solid stuff, could easily drink a bunch of these in one night."
"Pours a light clear orangish color with a slight head but not much retention. The smell has notes of orange with a touch of floral hops. It has a great light flavor and is something that I would prefer to have on a sunny hot day. Taste is refreshingly crisp. Notes of citrus are what really pops out at me. comes off as a touch on the dry side which I like a lot. I'll be trying this one again for sure"

"Taste bitter grapefruit giving way to sweet orange, with some spicy coriander notes, followed by a biscuity, chewy malt mouthfeel. Very nice, a solid ale."

""
"Overall not as impressed with this one."
""
"Advertised as having 3 types of malts, 3 types of hops. I was pretty excited. Color is clear yellow... with almost no head. The aroma was nice - sweet apricot and grains coming out. The taste was bready, earthy, and bitter, in a somewhat stale and off putting way. I almost didn't review this because I thought the bottle may have gone bad, but other reviews seem to suggest that's how it is... Pass on this one."
"Drinkability is nice. A good american pale ale. I have had better and I have had worse. A good beer for a drinking session, but it may get boring after a while."
"I've been liking the southern tier products lately so I picked a single up from wegmans mixed six area. Poured into my Duvel tulip. Clear and golden with a minimal head. What's going in here? Slight hop aroma mixed with malt. This is kind of weird. Tasted kind of basic. Kind of like a junior APA. Not sure why this is extraordinary. Basically ok."
"Not sure what a solid club like Southern Tier was after with this one, it is not extraordinary by any stretch. It's easy to drink and there is nothing offensive about it, but it just seems like a lost puppy with no pedigree."
"Good brew. Tasty and refreshing."
"Overall a light refreshing brew, easy drinking but not as great as some good Pale Ales. Don't see ever re buying this one not bad just not good enough."
"Alot of hop flavor with only a fair amount of bitterness. Malt backbone is pretty flabby, but I think the brewers intended this to be light bodied and easy to drink. Biscuit dominates with a grainy, very mild toffee character. I like the hops used here...little bit of tropical, lot of citrus and a smattering of resin. Freshness seems to be paramount to this one, as I already notice a difference in the 3 weeks it has been since I last cracked one of these. Pretty tasty stuff overall, I could see myself getting a sixer of this at least once a year or so."
"O: Pretty good APA but not extraordinary."
"O: Solid. Well-balanced. An easy-drinking APA."
"O: A pretty decent Pale. Not the best by far, but very drinkable."
"I like it. This would enter the regular rotation at my house if it weren't so pricey, $10 a six pack."
"O-Upon review the IPA is better (but I also remember thinking the IPA in the mix was a little off). However it is still solid, not the best APA but a cheaper and easy to get session beer."
"O: Very easy drinker, good for a few. Not an extrordinary beer but well worth a visit."
"Extraordinary ale? A bit short of the mark, but does qualify for at least ""good."" Nice depth of hopping, with some tea-like notes. Malt is likewise nicely layered and balanced. Hops bittering is less than one would expect for an APA, and seems more in line with that of a pale ale. Nice session candidate."
"Poured a clear copper color with a decent white head. Toasty aroma, malty, with mild hints of floral and citrus hops. Taste of toasty grains and malts, moderately sweet, with floral and citrus hops gently infused, a bit metallic. Medium bodied and quite drinkable, but pretty standard. Aka, not that extraordinary."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp making for a refreshing APA. One could easily knock back a few of these in an evening. Overall, not my favorite APA but I'd have it again if offered."
"O: Phin & Matt's 'Extraordinary' Ale? Not so much. This isn't even ordinary, let alone extraordinary. This is about the weakest APA I've ever had out of a microbrewery. On the bright side, at least it's not offensive at all. It's basically seltzer water that someone dropped a slice of toast in. So far Southern Tier is 0 for 2 on their 'regular ABV' lineup. Love their big beers though."
"Overall- Not enough body or hop for this one.. Very refreshing but just doesn't suite the style. Such a shame since I'm such a huge fan of Southern Tier. (Also have had this one in bottle and remember it MUCH differently!)"
"O - A decent session pale ale. It feels good, it smells good, I just wish the taste were a little more refined. It’s certainly good, but it doesn’t feel like a wholly balanced beer."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and has some refreshing properties."
"Poured the 12oz bottle into a pint glass to find golden straw colored body with a small white head. The aroma had a lot of malts with a few hints of grapefruit hops and some citrus notes. The taste was good, though I did feel like it was missing something. I didn't think that the taste held up with the aroma, it was a good tasting beer but nothing out of the ordinary. It was a light and crisp beer that was easy to drink and enjoy, I just wish that the flavors would have stood out a bit more."
"Phin & Matt's Extraordinary Ale is an American Pale Ale. Pours out a pretty clear golden color, just a ever so slight haze to it. Small white head which disappears after a couple of minutes. The scent has a light candy sweetness, along with just a touch of piney hops. As for the taste, its got a candy sweetness, much lighter malts than many PAs you'll see. Not even getting any caramel out of this. Touch of flowery/piney hops, some toasted breadiness. Medium to light bodied, nice wet feel."
"An easy-going ale, a nice session style."
"Very tasty - for a beer that doesn't list its style I'm really impressed!"
"Overall, Phin & Matt's is a good ale, but tends to lose flavor as the sugars get dominated by bitterness. If the entire bottle tasted like the first mouthful, this one would be gold."
"overall, i like it better than the regular Pale ale, there's more flavor."
"d- overall this is an average beer but i guess it's worth it's price tag"
"Phin & Matt's Extraordinary Ale poured a strawy yellow color, with very little head, but alot of bubbles from crabonatin. The smell was rather malty, and earthy, I was expecting and hoping for something hoppeir. The taste was very malty, but the hops arent noticable, ruins anything sweet from the malts, theres almost a harshness. The taste does stay on the paletee and thats almost unforntante, its harsh, a random bittners comes, but you dont get to enjoy a floral hoppy flavor. Overall I wish I could say some better things, I didnt like this one, I would avoid."
"Smooth and creamy in the mouthfeel and a nice little carbonation kick. The taste has some notes of citrus in the way of lemon and a little hop kick that brings a crispness to that smoothness. The hop kick is a little too brief and doesn't linger very long, leaving one sort of wanting a little more strength out of it. Not much in the way of a malt presence, leading to a bland taste in the end. Truly, its not a bad brew, but the blandness of the flavors is definitely underwhelming. An ""eh"" kind of a beer but its drinkability is a plus and therefore still worth the try."
"D - entirely drinkable, totally a summer gulper. Would compliment a salad, or a burger even. Totally worth the purchase, and much easier to drink than dales pale but would file under the same category."
"good mouthfeel overall i think this is super quaffable i will definitely buy this again i am loving the pale ale style and these guys definitely have it right on i will seek out more of their beers for sure"
"D: Nicely balanced, interesting, but not complicated. Nicely drinkable. Solid malt base really lets interesting hop profile shine – not distinctly American (west coast C hops), not really English, not really Noble – a nice select blend. Good for a session. Certainly better than their Pale, though perhaps not truly extraordinary (careful with those superlatives)."
"D - Very drinkable. Very crisp and refreshing, but at the same time a bit empty. Could have used a bit more of a kick mixed in there."
"Body lays a bit flat with the carbonation and sits just under a medium mouthfeel. Starts a bit empty and picks up a general steam of pick me up as it goes. Pretty much the younger brother beer of Gemini. The only other brew from Southern Tier I steer away from. As Pales goes, this stuff is a little above average, but not by much."
"O-Shit the bottle had me excited...three different malts...thre different hops (probably not that much different from other PA's but it is good marketing)....the product is not very good though...the regular ST Pale Ale kicks the shit out of this. That is a decent beer. This is not. Stop brewing this would be my suggestion."
"I believe this bottle may not be as fresh as I'd like so when I find a fresher batch, I'll edit my review accordingly."
"Drinkability/overall- this beer overall is just to bland for me its not hard to drink but just kinda bland, its simple and decent but certainly far from the best pale ale i have had recently"
"Just a pleasant all around beer to drink and enjoy. Nothing wrong with having a few of these in the fridge for when freinds come over."
"It’s similar to the first citra beer I fell in love with. It’s not ordinary, but it’s not really extra-ordinary. I’d say it’s somewhere in the middle, we’ll call it extraord, or traordinary."
"Had at Bobbique, pours a bright amber, some decent lacing. Head did not last. Smell was floral, earthy, not hoppy. Rather like an ESB than a pale ale. Tasted more like an APA, balanced, bitter, and only a bit hoppy. Maybe more hops would have made this better. mouthfeel was tacky, liked it. Overall, decent brew from Southern Tier. ST is proving that they can brew more than just dessert stouts."
"This certainly is a pretty drinkable and tasty beer, albeit strange for style."
"Decent example of the APA style, could use more American hop character and bitterness to improve. Tasty malt backbone and a great dry finish."
"It's alright - drinkable. Bitter through and through."
"O - A great extra in a great trade! Super glad I go to try this one! Thank you Lerxst!"
"Overall it was an average example of a pale ale. There was very little extraordinary about it. I'm sorry, Matt and Phinn."
"Pleasant mouthfeel with nice carb. I like it. I could drink this and be quite pleased but there's nothing here that would make me buy it again."
"Overall my only gripe is maybe it could use a touch more hops. Would like to try it again but I liked the pale better."
"Finally pulled the trigger on a single o' this. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises mild caramel, musty flowers, and light pine. The taste holds notes of even milder caramel, orange peel, light grapefruit rind, and light grass. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a finish that seems to want to be dry. Overall, I was severely underwhelmed by this brew. I can't say it's necessarily bad in any real respect, but it doesn't come anywhere near something I can call ""good""."
"The name brings about flashbacks of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure though I'm sure thats just a coincidence. Pours a dead clear golden amber with virtually no head. Smells of hops still hanging on the vine and taste like it too! First sip is instant hops however there is NO lingering bitter aftertaste as with other hoppy brews. As the hops roll off there are definite notes of caramel and malts. This is perfect for the person looking to ease into the flavor of hops or is an excellent choice for a session beer. I could easily drink many of these and not get bored with the instant hop hit. Extraordinary? Maybe not... but it is refreshing and damn delicious none the less."
"Overall not bad at all here This was a very good little session ale that I would have no issue at all with trying out again some day. I would love to find it on cask to give it a good whirl. Definitly worth another look here."
"Poured from the bottle a amber orange clear color with a bright white loose head. Smell is soft citrus and hints of some buscuit and sweet caramel malts. Taste is simply complex, not overpowering in hops or malt but a nice complexity to the flavor ranges with citrus and floral hops to bits of buscuit and caramel malt. Mouthfeel is smooth and light good body and carbonation. Overall very enjoyable beer, not outstanding but balanced and good."
"This beer poured out with a gigantic amount of head on it. It was pretty much the entire glass was foam and with the smallest amount of liquid at the bottom. It took several tries to get the entire beer into the glass. Once it settled this beer was a clear yellow color. The aroma was on the hoppy side not too much else really happening there. The taste was a little piney, the after taste had some malts kicking in but not a whole lot. The mouthfeel was ridiculously carbonated, every sip I took the beer just went crazy and foamed up in my mouth. It was kind of a pain because it was hard to get a decent mouthful."
"Overall - Easy breezy session beer"
"Overall a pretty flavorful pale ale. Looks good and drinks good. I like this beer. Actually one of the best pales I've had. A nice mix of hops and malts."
"One's like or dislike of this offering will hinge entirely on acceptance of a sugary, jasmine-flavored ale. I found it interesting and quite drinkable, on occasion; others may downright hate it."
"Overall I'm fairly surprised at the reviews here. This is an extremely simple but tasty beer."
"Overall: The taste is pretty basic but it isn't a bad brew. It is more balanced than southtier's pale ale which I think is a good thing. All in all very drinkable and simple brew, just nothing extraoridinary."
"D - I rated this high. It's not an amazing beer. But it drinks well. Really well. This is a session beer and goes down pretty easily and is pretty good if your looking for something lighter to drink but there are still better choices out there for sure."
"O - I wouldn't really classify this beer as ""extraordinary"" as the labels says. It's an okay beer overall, well-balanced but lacking a lot flavor. I'd classify this as an adequate, drinkable session beer, but I will not seek it out again."
"Highly recommended by the bartender at one of our local watering holes (I generally trust his recommendations) ...I'm a huge PA and IPA fan...this beer tasted like the beers was strained through a grass catching bag from a lawn mower...Poured attractive as typical pale, but as soon as the beer hits the inside of the mouth, the bitterness is more biting than appealing and therefore, brings most catagories into the not impressed range for me on this beer...the finish is a finish a long to forget."
"It has a below average mouthfeel - boring, too watery and macro-brewish. It's not hard to drink and not terrible by any stretch. But I wouldn't buy it again, either."
"D - Crisp and refreshing, I'd probably prefer it colder and drink it as a lawnmower beer. Not bad for the money, but not great either. It's a good, solid, nothing fancy APA."
"T/M: Again, the citrus and piney hops balance well with the moderate malt profile. Lighter bodied for the style cut nicely with a higher carbonation level. Finishes clean."
"This beer pours a clear golden-orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of citrus fruit, and herbal hops. The taste has some grapefruit, and a little bitterness. There isn't much else there. The mouthfeel is a touch lighter than medium bodied with carbonation that is a little high. Overall, this beer isn't bad, but it isn't good either. I wouldn't complain about drinking this again, but if given other options I probably wouldn't."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a small white head. Little to no lacing. Smells malty and a bit toasty. Also a little orange rind and coriander. Palate is malty, earthy, and citrusy. Hops add grapefruit and some orange flavor. Mouthfeel is slick and fluid with mild dryness. Drinkable but not memorable. Their regular Pale Ale is much better than this, so I have to wonder, what's the point?"
"Poured a deep yellow with a hint of orange. Excellent clarity. Nice foamy white head that leaves wet lacings and a thin white cap. Medium bodied with tangy carbonation. Lemony citrus and bready aromas . Taste is similar to aroma: lemony citrus hop flavor and bready, grainy malt flavors. A bit of a stale bread finish."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a hazy golden straw color with about a finger of snow cap white head that retains fair enough and gives off sparse soapy lace. Slight hoppy aroma and bit of fruitiness to it. I guess I would call it strawberry. Oddly enough, I also kind of smell sharp cheddar cheese faintly. Grainy flavors with a slight fruity profile and again a weird cheesy flavor. This just seems a bit off for me. The mouthfeel is fair, kind of under carbonated in my opinion but it drinks alright. Certainly not my favorite though."
"d: highly drinkable."
"The beer was a lighter medium feel to it with good carbonation. The beer was very smooth, crisp and very refreshing and very drinkable and finishes with a nice dry aftertaste. This is one of those styles that I think is very under-rated. This is a quality APA and one that should be enjoyed often."
"Much better APAs out there. I finished it quickly to get something more flavorful to drink."
"D-very drinkable, crisp at tasty all the way through. I could have many of these in a night. there aren't any real negative qualities that keep me from wanting to have this again. in fact, this wasn't my first bottle."
"Poured a nice crisp yellow into a red plastic cup (beggars cant be choosers) with a thin frothy head that could be reawoken with a swirl. smelled of syrupy thick hops. Taste followed the nose a bit but more malty, but definitely rich and a bit syrupy. Pretty drinkable but a bit thicker than I usually aim for. The hops malt balance doesn't really make it heavy in any direction, seems like a safety type of brew. Nithing outstanding, but nothing offensive."
"This actually drinks pretty well. I'd certainly buy it again. Would be great in cans for fishin'."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy, gold color with no head or lingering lace. It's aroma is mainly grapefruit with hints of citrus and caramel. The flavor begins with grapefruit followed by a good balance between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is light and drinkability is average. Phin & Matts Extraordinary Ale is a decent beer, recommended."
"I really wish they would ""can"" this beer and make more of the stuff that actually tastes good. This tastes like a mainstream ale that should appeal to the masses but in the end doesn't impress. Nice hop aroma but the taste is flat...no real hops...no real malt flavor. Too many good beers from ST to drink this one."
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent light orange color with a thin head. Some lacing. Aroma is earthy with some grains and a small amount of hops. Taste is a bit more malt than I expected. Has a slight bitter hop taste too. Earthy flavors as well. Certainly a drinkable APA. Works fine in a mix 12 pack but not worth seeking out on it's own."
"Overall i was very unimpressed with this beer. It was just not pleasurable to drink. I would not recommend it to anyone else and probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Nothing in this beer really stood out for me. This beer is exactly ""extraordinary."" But has good drinkability."
"D - I rated this high. It's not an amazing beer. But it drinks well. Really well. This is a session beer and goes down pretty easily."
"Drink - An average beer that I wouldn't seek out again. It wasn't awful; it was just nothing special."
"Medium/Deep Orange color, some yellow highlights. Quite hazy at pour, clears quite a bit with time and warmth but still just barely has a haze. Thin, spotty head, lasts throughout. Bright rich citrisy aroma. Pretty heavy on orange and grapefruit. Almost a pale maltiness present. Average Carbonation. Beginning of drink is somewhat bland. Darker citrisy flavor in middle, heavy orange peel at end. Very light mouthfeel. For such a heavy aroma, almost feels a little empty. Would make for a light refreshing summer beer. Malt shows through more as beer warms. Taste not very complex, not to have three hop varieties and three malts. Simple and relatively clean."
"Drinkability: This isn't one I'd seek out, but would be perfectly acceptably if somebody handed me a couple three bottles."
"Taste, like the aroma, seemed to be largely devoid of hops. With a name like extraordinary, I found this to be extremely pedestrian and average all around. Light hops, light, light, light everything, tasted like a ""good"" light beer, which is pretty much unacceptable for an apa, much less one made by the awesome ST. Pretty bland. I can get bland without spending this much for it."
"D: nothing mindblowing, but solid overall. i like the pale malt profile in this one."
"nice drinkability to it, could throw these back like easy drinking session beers."
"D- Pretty average. I would not consider it Extraordinary at all."
"D- drinkable. Not outstanding by any stretch of the imagination, but its drinkable. You could probably put a few of these down...and its cheap, too"
"Overall not a terribly impressive brew and I probably won't return to it"
"DB- A decent Pale Ale but I don't think the floral forward APA works for me, the malt balances it somewhat but it feels unbalanced. Light and refreshing but not Extraordinary in the least."
"This isn't a Southern Tier for the extreme brew lovers. This shows a lighter side of Southern Tier that buyers of their imperial bombers might not even see. It's awesome that they're good at both sides of the spectrum. Highly recommended to those who don't always want their beers to be ""extreme""."
"A fine example of the style though not particularly memorable. The label boasts 3 varieties of hops and 3 types of malts -- nothing that amounts to a deeply complex beer, but ""extraordinary"" in its execution."
"Overall, I'm disappointed. I've fallen in love with Southern Tier's Imperial beers and maybe I'm spoiled as a result but this doesn't live up."
"(D) Drinkable? Yes. Southern Tier worthy? No. Nice transition beer from something along the lines of a bud light but not worthy of a true APA."
"D-Easy to drink. If you're looking for an easy drinking beer that offers more taste than BMC here ya go. Also seek out this beer if you're a fan of being disappointed."
"O: Disappointing selection from a brewery that normally impresses me."
"D - High. This to me is a great summer beer. Light enough to have a few and enjoy."
"drinkability: Nice balanced APA. My 5th Southern Tier since loading up on their brews (just new to Colmbus, GA). Great line-up."
" ~ Overall not my favorite beer. It doesn't have the character I normally find desireable in a pale ale. However, while I don't think I'll be partaking in this brew again I do recommend it be sampled by other beer fans so they too can offer their opinions."
"drinks average. almost reminds me of a pilsner in the flavor profile and body, but not a terribly good one. nothing terrible about this beer, but one that ill pass up in the future unless its my only option, in which case ill drink it."
"The body is firm and actually quite filling for this style. Good carbonation. Per the reviews, I wasn't expecting much going into this one. But this is a pleasant PA. Mild bready flavor that is touched up by a kiss of honey sweetness. Finishes with a smack of American hops. I like this beer. This would be a regular sessioner were it available here."
"Clear solid yellow brew generates a half inch of light tan foam that settles to a thin dense layer. Smell is semi-sweet malts and lemongrass. Swirl of the glass gives a short-lived flare up of watery foam that runs straight down the glass instead of hanging on as lace at all. Taste is pretty earthy, yeast, light citrus and some other mixed hop."
"D: While not my favorite beer by a long shot, it's got a nice flavor if I was looking for an inoffensive summer ale. Worth checking out."
"Mildly rich body, carbonation could be higher to cut through that massively malty sweetness."
"Pretty good! I liked it..It was a little bit different than the usual APA."
"Overall, this is a very well balanced beer. You do get a sense of malt as well as hops, with neither one overpowering the other. I was expecting a little more from Southern Tier in this one, but not a bad beer. Just not extraordinary as the title claims."
"D: It is easy to drink but lacking in flavor overall"
"Meh. Trite story and a beer to match. That's really surprising from Southern Tier. Served with a small off white head that settled down and no lace. Color is a copper amber. Aroma is malt, caramel, a little honey, spice, and hop. Flavor has a little more sweetness coming out along with a little hop. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and kind of short. A yawner."
"I poured into a pint glass to one finger of eggshell head. It is a deep golden color. The aroma is yeast, caramel, and hops. The taste is yeast, caramel, and almost imperceptible hops. I was really hoping for a balanced APA. This not an immpressive attempt from a company that makes some tremendous beer."
"Taste-melon, biscuit, subtle hop bite. Creamy, nicely balanced. Nothing over-the-top here, just a nice, easy drinking, well-balanced pale ale."
"Overall- this is one amazing stock brews. for being an ipa fan and not usually caring for apa's i thought this brew was pretty good. really clean. a good one to have on hand for the hop or malt lovers. really good for people getting into the realm of craft brews."
"Had this one several times, the first time I've had it, I absolutely loved it. However I've had it a couple of other times since and haven't been as impressed. To only be fare I waited to review this when I was really in the mood for a nice Pale Ale Poured this one into a Sam Adams Perfect pint. Golden orange in color with a creamy white head that fades away about half way through and some pretty good lacing to it. The smell is good, mainly citrus hops, with some floral and herbal aromas as well, some slight pale malts. The taste is on par with the smell. Some toasted pale malts. I really like the taste too. Caramel and toasted pale malts. Citrus hops dominate the rest of the flavor, it's very well balanced. The mouthfeel is very good, lighter in body and a good carbonation feel. A little complex because it feels prett clean, but as it warms a bit there is almost a buttery tone to it which makes it seem like a more hopped English Pale Ale, in my opinion. Very drinkable, could easily be had year round. A solid well-done brew balanced brew. If they were a bit cheaper and more excessable in my area, could easily be a stand by."
"I drank this one with pleasure."
"Overall: Great summer beer, but balanced enough to carry itself into mid-late fall. It's assertive and flavorful, but not too much."
"D - A really solid American Pale Ale... A little more in the flavor profile would make this a terrific offering, but unfortunately it falls a tad short... However, this one delivers in all other facets and I would gladly drink again... Quite quaffable and sessionable..."
"This beer seemed like it didn't know what it wanted to be. If you like pale ale from Sierra Nevada, Three Floyds, or Bell's, don't bother buying this."
"Very drinkable and very enjoyable. I just wouldn't go so far as to call it extraordinary."
"Pours a golden yellow color with 1 finger of head that fades with chunky lacing. A nice citrus hop aroma greets the nose with a lot of malt in the background. The malt has a toasted, caramel aroma. The front comes in with decent amount of malt character, but not as much as I expected from the aroma. The middle is prickly with carbonation before going out with some slightly harsh bitterness. The finish is lingering, body is pretty creamy and drinkability is Ok. A decent beer."
"OK pale ale, reminds me more of a cream ale. Refreshing and nice for the summertime."
"D- Very drinkable, I'll probably buy a sixer soon."
"Value: Pricey. I paid $8.99 for a sixer. I'm no cheapskate, but I think this beer would be more fairly priced at around $6.99 per sixer...maybe it is up in New York."
"Pours a nice light amber with a bit of orange shining through with a bright white thick head that laces through completion. Aroma is faint. Hints of citrus and bread. A lot of breadiness and a toasty flavor to start. Semi-sweet malt. A little citrus hops are next before a subtle caramel malt and the slightest hints of dark fruit. Finishes with some pine/grassy hops."
"Overall: Overall the beer was a decent light citrusy ale. Not really my style but I thought it was decent. I much prefer their Creme Brulee (A+) or Porter (A)."
"D: A decent pale ale, but nothing extraordinary. It's not something I'll actively seek out again."
"Pours an orange amber with a thin head that fades to a ring with some light lacing. Smells somewhat waxy and grainy, with a meaty backbone of herbal hops. That same grainy waxiness is in the taste along with enough malt to balance. In fact, the malt tastes oddly like a malted shake, but without the sweetness and the effect is that the beer tastes more dry than sweet. Not bad, actually. Stiff and a bit too thick in the mouth for a pale ale, but I found this decent enough for my tastes."
"D - Good drinkability because of the light body and complex taste."
"D - This is challenging Alpha King for my fav session beer. Extremely drinkable, at least on tap."
"Good Beer. Very drinkable and worth trying."
"D: Definitely would be a good session beer because it is smooth and easy-drinking."
"The feel of this beer is medium and is a nice easy drinking beer. It goes down well and would pair well with a few different food choices."
"really good drinkability, really easy drinking. nice for the summer months on the beach and what not(as i just finished a sixer of these the other day on the beach and it couldnt have been more of a perfect beer). i would recommend this, but ST's pale is a much better pale ale. phin and matts is more towards the malty side whereas pale is more hoppy."
"There's nothing extraordinary about this ale. My second Southern Tier and I'm not seeing what everyone is raving about. Sorry."
"This ale comes out of the tap a nice clear coppery amber with a decent head. Aroma is nicely malty although not too strong. Rich, malty flavor has an undertone of spices, mainly cloves and a bit of cinnamon. Texture is pleasingly smooth and somewhat lively."
"A golden color with a small white head and a fair amount of lacing. Sweet malt aroma, lemon/citrus, flowers. I thought the malt came through more in the taste, tasting like a brioche, with a little lemon, and some late hops. Pretty balanced. I imagine this would be a good session beer."
"Drinkability: I found it to be well balanced in all regards, there wasn't scads of malt sweetness and there wasn't a splurge of harsh, unnecessary bitterness. It's just a straight-up good APA."
"The flavor is mild, traditional malt taste with a tasteful amount of hops that makes me think of a SN Glissade a little bit. The hops are bitter and flowery and balanced to the malt well. Over all this is a good beer for the warmer weather and a welcome subtlety and balanced come with it. Although compared to other APA's this one is kind of lacking."
"It isn't a bad beer and I expect that it is designed to be much better but without a date on the bottle I have to take it at face value. The hop character they claim to have is missing and all I get is a malt bomb, without the bomb."
"Mouthfeel was medium body with a moderately coarse texture. I enjoy that in a APA/IPA. Thumbs up."
"D - I found myself sipping this, and I'm not quite sure why. It was very yummy, and if I had started my night off with this I could see having a few."
"Decent brew with easy drinkability."
"Overall I am simply whelmed by this beer, with no real feelings one way or another. I also found that the tap version was slightly hoppier than the bottle I had but not by much. Worth a shot if you see it around."
"Pretty boring beer in my opinion. Definitely an upgrade to Budweiser categories, but not an exciting craft brew. I wouldn't buy this again."
"Phin and Matt's is an extremely well prepared brew. The clarity is perfect. The head, though not exceedingly robust is consistent. The taste is good at all temperatures. And you really could drink a whole mess of these."
"D- This is overall an average beer and is easy to drink. It is worth getting every once and a while, and it is a nice beer to use to introduce light beer drinkers to mircobrews."
"D- Overall,, nothing all that extraordinary with this one. It is a decent Pale Ale, but nothing spectacular."
"Cheers!"
"D= Pretty good beer. If it were more avalible to me I would buy it from time to time. Not bad and sort of reminds me of some of my homebrews. Not worth seeking out regularly but worth trying for sure and worth enjoying from time to time."
"Drinkability: Not a bad little beer. Would recommend to others trying to kick their macro habit, but not something I would seek out again."
"D- This beer lacked the wow factor for me. I enjoy a well crafted light ABV beer but this seems to be lacking a lot of things overall. I will revisit this one again just incase I got a old bottle. I am hoping because I like Southern Tier but...they seem to be a hit or miss with me."
"D - Very drinkable and well rounded. The hop aroma is more pungent than I would have expected with a big whiff of pine that contrasts the rich malt character nicely. The flavor is more mild with a greater emphasis on the malt, but there is still enough hop flavor and bitterness to keep the beer balanced. Nicely done."
"I bought this beer in a mixed 12 pack, and I look forward to drinking the other 2 bottles from the pack. I will not however, go out of my way to find more of it."
"Mouthfeel is fine, but I don't think I even want to finish this one glass. It just isn't very tasty for an APA. Not what I expected. I'll probably try another bottle next time I see one just to give it a fair shot."
"bit thin, but good APA overall."
"Poured an orangish color with a small white head. Nose is malts, hops, citrus. Taste is bready, citrus, nice malty backbone to it. Mouthfeel is sticky, light booze, sweet and coating. Reminds me of an English Pale on the mouthfeel. Very drinkable beer"
"Drinkability: this is actually quite a nice, refreshing, drinkable pale ale. Kudos."
"D: Very drinkable--Does not feel like a 5.6% at all. I think this is a very sessionable beer. Not really a pale ale, but I would rather drink this than most pilsners and other beers."
"D: I was surprised to see this one listed an APA - I would have never guessed it to be a pale ale. Light, vibrant, easily sessionable, but otherwise rather uninteresting. I suppose this one could be an everyday drinker, but I personally don't think I'll drink it ever again."
"D - The weakest Southern Tier beer I've had to date, it doesn't showcase much but it's not bad, just bland. Nothing stands out."
"This is an enjoyable, tasty ale, but like most of the other viewers, it is not extraordinary. I nice evening ale to quaff. It does not drink like a 5.6 ABV ale."
"D-easy drinker here, decent flavors albeit kind of faint. Definitely goes down smooth; but the bitterness and phenols at the finish detract from the overall drinkability"
"This is a nice drinkable brew. Would be popular in the summer time. Nothing too persuasive one way or the other, just a good solid brew."
"This would be a easy drinking brew that would be good to bring to a party. This brew would not offend anyone. This brew is a decent and drinkable, good - just not great."
"Aroma and taste of fresh grain and cascade hops. It's over priced and under qualified. I'll pass on this and have a Sierra Pale instead. Thanks."
"Pours clear orangy with lively carbonation producing a short-lived head. The aroma is cidery and a little thin, though some citrusy hops peer out as the beer opens. The aroma is flowery and little citrusy, with a cider-like character. But the effect is weak and disappointing. The mouthfeel is thin. This would be a perfectly adequate beer for a hot day, but nothing to get the tongue excited."
"Pale, hazed deep sunny hue. Slow carbonation is noted. And an airy white head of decent size sits on top. Lace clings to the walls of the glass like it's holding on for dear life. The aroma is citric and grapefruity. Flavor is mellow without anything really making an impression. Soft malt qualities mixed with light citrus. Easy going mouthfeel. Medium bodied. Average all around."
"Very drinkable and would be a fine accompaniment to an outdoor summer activity."
"D- Again way too much carbonation, it distracts from the other average qualities of the ale."
"D - Not bad. I've had better from Southern Tier, especially from this ""Pack of Pales"" I reviewed this weekend. It's certainly a creative and interesting take on an APA."
"It pours with a thick and creamy head. Lots of lacing. The color is a very crisp amber. Perhaps a bit too fizzy. The aroma is weak with boiled hops. The brew is a bit too sweet with malt upfront. The hops peek in the middle and are a bit present in the finish. The hops get a bit better when the beer gets slightly warmer. Really, a very plain pale ale. Slightly too sweet for my tastes. But nothing off putting either. A decent session beer and a slight step up from a middling macrobrew."
"I seriously have to thank my favourite bottleshop once again for venturing out and finding new brews many thanks to adam,joel and bernie,this brew pours a light amber hue with average carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing half finger head and no lacing at all,the aroma is sweet boiled candy,passionfruit and some citrus aswell,it has a nice mouthfeel which is neither thick nor thin and easily slides down with tastes of passionfruit,boiled candy and a little hint of lime,overall i really like this brew and could drink it all night."
"the taste comes across much much lighter than expected, but it's rather refreshing. much more bready/biscuity. mouthfeel initially comes across with the carbonation, but flattens out a bit. a little bitter finish that i like, but would like some sustaining power. one of those here it is, now it's gone. not a bad thing at all, but something is missing. it's not a matter of subtlety...it's not dull at all. very drinkable. seems like a lesser ABV brew. a summer light APA for sure."
"This is an average to below average American Pale Ale due to the thin body and weak malt profile...it just doesn't taste seem to be a very high quality ale."
"I could have a few of these at a time. Solid."
"D: I will def. be seeking this out for a session."
"D-great tasting, sessionable beer. would have this again. Very easy drinking."
"There was not much for head what was there went away fast and left just a little island in the middle. It has a great full hop aroma. The taste is slightly bitter at first a little bit piney and beany. The body is thin with some great carbonation. It has a grassy and dark brass colored body."
"DRINKABILITY: As far as being able to drink. It's not bad. I mean theres nothing notably wrong with this beer other then the fact that it has no smell or flavor. This is not something i would waste my time drinking again. It's called an extraordinary ale. Why?"
"Drinkability: A solid effort. Nothing spectacular. More hops than your regular APA. Very similar to their IPA with just a touch more carbonation so i like this one better."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer feels good in the mouth. The carbonation is correct for the style. Drinkability is good; you could drink a few of these while watching sports on T.V."
"D Good, which is also true to the style but this is rather forgettable. 4.0"
"this beer pours a nice clear golden color with a billowy off white head that's clinging to the sides of the glass nicely. there's a nice bit of citrus hop in the nose as well as some sweetness from the malt. the taste follows with a goodly bit of sweet malt up front and the promised hop bite at the end. a very smooth drink, highly drinkable."
"I'm not a Hop lover and this one hits the mark for me.... the hops are there but don't over power everything.... Worth a shot... go give it a try."
"Reviewed on 8/27/2009. Bottle. Pours a clear light orange with a small ring of white head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, crystal malt. dark fruits and raisin. Flavor is very similar with sweet, grainy malt, some dark fruits. Ok, drinkable, but boring."
"Easy enough to drink, but really not worth the effort."
"Picked up at Beer Geek Christmas tonight -- woo-hoo! Christmas early! This poured an orangish-amber (work with me here...color-blind) with a nice white head. Head dissipated fairly quickly but nice lacing throughout the drink. Light citrusy smell followed by a nice balance between malt and hops. Good carbonation, maybe a little on the watery side. Overall, a nice beer with a good balance of malt and hops."
"Drinkability is very good, this is something I could see myself substituting for any macro beer when drinking more then a few with macro drinkers. Nothing over the top with taste but enjoyable and drinkable."
"D: A pretty average to slightly above average pale. Not nearly as good as the standard ST Pale. Not one I'll seek out, but I wouldn't turn it away."
"D - I would drink this again, and its very sessionable. However, even ST has better offerings than this."
"I had this straight from the bottle without appropriate glassware which is odd for me...I've come to realize that any beer that touts the words ""extraordinary"" or ""divine"" in the title or anything of the sort tend to be anything but. This was good, but not great. Kind of watery and not hoppy enough for me as far as pale ales go. Still it was crisp and fairly drinkable."
"Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated. Feels light on the tongue."
"D - This is a great APA, tasty and sessionable. This could be a staple in your fridge."
"dr. An okay brew, but something in the smell and taste is off-putting to me."
"Pours a clear, copper/golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, slight citrus, slight pine, and sweet malt background. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, slight pine, citrus (lemon), sweet malt, and slight caramel. Overall, a really good blend, but only average mouth feel."
"Overall impression: This beer is either past its prime, or just not good. Its still mildly drinkable, but there is an unpleasant sour note that takes away from whatever base flavors this beer has."
"Bottle: Poured a light hazy amber color ale with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light bitter hops with a subtle citrus undertones and medium caramel malt base. Taste is more bitter in terms of aroma then actual taste with a medium caramel malt base. Body is full with good carbonation. A good session ale though more hops presence could have benefited this beer."
"Drink is decent but this seems to have some off flavors to me."
"overall, i really enjoyed this a.p.a. i look forward to the next!"
"taste is of grain, sour malt, corn, a sweetness in the back, and corn-nuts, ends thick yet dry and a little bitter."
"D: Good drinkability, just not great. Though this is one of my favorite APA out there. ST to me, never fails..."
"Overall this is a fairly average brew. Decent enough but definitely not ""extraordinary."" Basic flavors and a week presence in mouthfeel make this a nice one to grab just to have a decent brew, but not anything to write home about."
"Overall, this is a drinkable beer...and has a decent flavor balance, but lacks in significant mouthfeel and doesn't contain anything really memorable."
"Light-medium bodied. The carbonation stays moderate throughout. It doesn't set itself apart in a sea of pale ales, but it's a decent quaff."
"12oz bottle cracked in anticipation of the OSU-USC game in 2009. The beer is clear (maybe chill hazed), an amber shade of yellow, with a thin but durable wet foam of spitty consistency. The smell is kind of muted, what I can get mostly is bready or pepper-cracker, maybe just a little light citrus. The taste is about the same, a lot of bready malts with a touch of bitterness, really a good combination for an APA. Good carbonation gives a peppery mouthfeel, overall this is solid as a ST beer should be but not really extraordinary."
"D- Easy to drink, not going to take your tastebuds on any wild rides. Just staight forward beer. Maybe a good ""bridge"" beer for the non crafty's. This beer is kind of a wall flower...solid, not bad, but forgettable."
"Had it not been for those off flavors I'd be rateing this much higher. I wont be drinking this one again."
"Once again the flavor is bland and uninspiring. Watered down and thin bodied with subtle floral and citrus hops and a caramel malt backbone. This beer is well balanced but is pretty boring with not much interesting going on. The hops are not very bitter and only have a slight touch of citrus fruit. A pretty drinkable session beer but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"Good drinkability, tasty beer."
"Overall, this isn't really that extraordinary. I enjoy the ST Pale Ale much more than this, as it is much more flavorful. A good APA that is a bit on the light side and unfortunately doesn't live up to its name. Not terrible but not ""extraordinary."""
"Not bad but nothing I'd go for on a regular basis."
"Drinkability was decent. This may not be the tastiest example of a pale out out there (it is indeed far from ""extraordinary""), but it is quite refreshing nonetheless. I could imagine this pairing well with a variety of dishes."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, pale golden color and a foamy white head. The nose is of citrusy hops and lightly toasted, caramel malt. Nice upfront citrusy, earthy hops initially and has an extremely smooth finish. Very well balanced; the lightly toasted caramel notes complement hop flavor nicely. The mouthfeel is a little on the watery side with just the right amount of carbonation to make this a very easy beer to drink. Between the excellent taste, overall smoothness and drinkability I would have to say that this does qualify as an extraordinary ale."
"Poured into my glass this beer is clear yellow with almost no head. After a large gulp there's a nice layer of sticky lace all around the glass. The aroma is very pleasant. Sweet caramel malt and a kiss of hops. A faint orange fruit aroma is detectable as well. The flavor is malt right off the bat. With a fresh hop bite that comes in and really livens things up. They balance eachother nicely battling for my tastebuds attention. There's a slight peach aftertaste that sneaks up at the last second. This seems light bodied to me. Fairly light and crisp. A good amount of carbonation helps firm thing up. This is a good clean APA that I could see buying a sixer of."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. No freshness date on the bottle. No real head to speak of. Thin lacing in the glass with okay amount of carbonation. Faint taste of orange some mint like undertones. Very little smell faint hops. Very easy to drink."
"An ok beer but hardly extraordinary. Smell is good I will give it that as it is a nice hoppy odor. Appearance is kind of blah a golden color with a white foamy head. Taste was a let down as it tasted to metallic and not enough hops for what I was smelling. Also it was a pretty light and sudsy brew. Overall it has decent drinkabilty. Not a bad beer but by no means but extraordinary? I think not"
"Pours a very light yellow color with i small head. The smell is of malt and citrusy hops. The taste is a roasted malt with a citrus hop to balance it out. The taste is a little bitter but in a bad way and leaves a little bit of an aftertaste that is not good. The mouthfeel is very smooth with moderate carbonation. The overall drinkability is okay, you could drink a lot but the after taste would bring you back down a little."
"Drinkability: I would have another if I wanted to stay sober for the rest of the night."
"D - this is a pretty good pale ale. Maybe not as extraordinary as it claims to be, but pretty decent."
"D: Decent drinker, but nothing stands out. Could have used a little more os something"
"D: I didn't really enjoy this APA and didn't go near the other two that came in the mix pack. I wasn't sorry I tried it, but I'd be sorry if I went and bought a 6-pack of this."
"This beer pours a hazy burnt orange color with a pretty tight thin head, more of a film to it. No lacing to speak of. Nose is toasted malts, biscuit, hops and a bit of orange. Taste is pretty inline with the nose - hop flavoring hits up front, moving in to a very doughy/biscuit taste, then the orange hits you and finishes with light toasted malts. Medium bodied beer, light to medium carbonation, goes down with a slick feel and finishes dry. Overall, it's a decent beer with good drinkability but there isn't much that stands out."
"Drinkability is good, it's quenching. This is a decent pale ale that sports a summer IPA personality. Won't turn heads, but can be satisfying as a thirst quencher."
"Drinkability: Not as extraordinary as the label would have you believe."
"Notes: A decent brew for a BBQ or just for sessions."
"A cross between an IPA and a English pale ale, it didn't do much for me. An OK brew, but I'll pass on another six pack."
"D= A very nice pale ale here. Had enough balance to make it sessionable and tasted good enough to make you want to do just that!"
"Drinkability solid all around beer I could make this a regular in my fridg"
"Drinkability- great. Easy to drink, and moderately interesting."
"Bright and hoppy, this is exactly what i'd expect from an American Pale Ale. I question the name extraordinary, since it does nothing to stand out in the style. The head is thick and creamy, but dissipates quickly. Color is bright gold and inviting. Nearly no aroma to speak of, a faint hops scent but weaker than the flavor warrants. Acceptable, but wouldn't seek out."
"a very average ale, slightly bitter but very enjoyable and refreshing, great drinkability and mouthfeel. this is a beer i huess i would buy again, right price and decent overall."
"Got this beer from a Southern Tier mix-pack. Pours a light orange with a decent thick head that fades quickly. Smells like hops and citrus. The taste is sort of boring, plain old pale ale with not much other flavor going on. Overall this beer had a good flavor, just kind of plain and boring"
"Drinkability: There just is not a lot of taste going on here. It is way light for what I have sampled in the style. I might have it again, but will not reach for it."
"Lovely moderately hoppy flavor for this style. Nice lacing. Aroma was consistent with the taste. A little caramel under the hop when lingered tonguely. Overall a very nice brew. I believe this to be my first beer from this brewer. Would like to have had this one from the tap, but it was nice just the same."
"I poured this into a pint glass, with a very thin head. The body of the beer is slightly foggy, which is a thumbs up for me considering I enjoy unfilterd beers. From looking at the title, I expected something to really impress me; however, that did not happen. But all things considered, this was a very good ale. I would not vote against it. It has a sweet, hoppy aroma with a moderately hoppy taste, which shouldn't offend anyone's taste buds. I would most likely buy this again in the future."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Beer Stop for $1.75 and poured into my shaker glass. Appears a clear golden yellow color with about a finger of tight bone white head. Smells and tastes of lightly toasted grains, grassy, earthy hops, and hints of citrus fruits such as lemon and grapefruit. A bit thin bodied, but amply carbonated. A decent warm weather quencher."
"Definitely clean & crisp, just not what I expected."
"Mouthfeel and flavors are fairly thin and less than impressive. Overall I would only recommend this for hot summer days as a half-step up from macro session beers."
"Medium body. Nice tingly carbonation. Nice smooth texture. This is a supremely drinkable beer. This seems like it would be an excellent gateway craft beer."
"Not the classic take on a pale ale, but a decent effort with a sweet hop twist."
"D: Good hot day drinker. For that purpose, it gets a higher drinkability."
"Quite drinkable and actually delicious, unfortunately light on the malt. But, I still think it's a great beer just for the hop flavor."
"12oz brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a brilliant clear gold with less than a finger of tight bubbled white head. Piney hop aroma with some biscuity malt. Plenty of hop bitterness. Light to medium bodied. Could use a little more malt. Lots of carbonation. Hops provide a drying finish. Very drinkable. A solid pale ale."
"If this was being rated against every beer I've ever tried I probably wouldn't give 3.5's on the smell and taste, but since it is a weak style in the first place I bumped it up slightly."
"Drinkability: Taste is fine, goes down well. Works in this department. Not incredible, but its good"
"Bitter aroma with a nice scent of hops, like planted flowers. Color of Miller Lite, but a good color for this ale. Unfortunately it tastes like Miller Lite with better hops. Too watery, not enough of a pale ale taste. It is a good hot weather beer. Very refreshing. I can't get over the lack of taste. It doesn't stay with me at all. It's very close to water. I wouldn't say extraordinary. It's good though."
"Unfortunately I got a sixer of this and I knew I would be able to really dump it off on anybody so I bit the bullet. I won't be having this again, since anyplace that would have it on tap is bound to have a better beer on."
"Drinkability- Not overly complex, but a highly refreshing beer that fits the style well, and would make for a good session beer."
"D: This is a drinkable beer. As I said, it's not a typical APA, but it's still easy drink."
"Drinkability: I think I'll stick to Southern Tier's big beers"
"D: Great. Two or three of these would be awesome. i like it a lot!"
"D - Good balance makes this easy to drink. Could have a few more."
"M - Watery, just above Busch Light in terms of thickness, medium/low carbonation."
"I love their other beers, but they missed the boat here. Make some more Pumpking, IPAs, or Imperials, don't even waste your time with this one. I never see people drinking it, and when they do they say they don't like it nearly as much as their other offerings."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. It pours a crystal-clear gold, with medium carbonation and an inch of off-white head that leaves patches of lace all the way down. Juicy citrus in the nose, but a bit one-sided. On the palate, herbal and minty hops make way for tangerine and leafy notes, a mild bitterness and a hint of malts on top of a lightish, dry body that leaves a light finish. Not very complex, but it's a refreshing, easily sessionable pale ale."
"D - A decent beer with hints of something that is way out of place, namely noble hops. This isn't a bad beer in it's own right, but it's not very good for a pale ale."
"Very good."
"Nice drinkable take on the style."
"Drinkability- I could knock back six of these and want more. I did not expect to like this. Maybe I was in the mood for a light, refreshing taste tonight, but this one hit the spot and made me happy."
"Tastes of strong citrus hops beating up some poor, thick, sweet malt. Far from balanced. More balanced and piney as it warms but still hop domination. Heavy, fizzy mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, I almost forgot I was drinking beer, it could have club soda. Not my idea of an extraordinary ale."
"Drinkability: Pretty high - could be higher with a little better carbonation."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and goes down smooth. I'd like a bit of a stronger presence in the taste (compared to 3F's Alpha King, this APA is a little light), but still pretty good."
"d. This beer is very drinkable, and with a lower abv (5.6%) you can drink a few of them happily."
"Had this on tap. Good copper amber hue. You can smell the aromatic hops. Taste is a good balance of maltiness and citrusy hops with a crisp finish without an aftertaste. Easy to drink and full of flavor. A great beer for all occasions. Would recommend and drink again."
"Found the taste to improve after it aired out, and I became accustomed to the hop attack. Settled into the APA category as the glass emptied, with a sour malt flavor. Would be a good spring weather beer."
"(rated Apr 25, 2008)"
"D - I could easily kill six of these and want one more!"
"Overall, another good choice by Southern Tier....which is becoming one of my more favored breweries."
"Golden amber in color with a thin white head. Smells orange heavy citrus and doughy malt. There is an over-ripe sweetness in the aroma that leads me to believ that this isn't going to taste good. And it doesn't. I've actually had a couple of these just in case I had got a bad bottle, but alas, this is what the brewers were shooting for and I guess they succeeded. I'm not a fan. Fruity sweet in the middle followed by a balnd caramel malt and subtle bitterness. Its medium bodied and perfectly carbonated. Its not very drinkable. Maybe I'm going heavy on personal preference on this review, but the blend of malts and hops just aren't working for me. I'd suggest skipping this one."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle and served in a shaker. This pale ale poured a fairly clear golden amber hue with a thin head of beige foam that settled into a lasting film. Some nice, even lacing was left around the glass. The aroma consisted of mild caramel, dried oranges, and citrus. The flavor included thin malts and faint citrus. A bland mix of caramel and oranges. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had moderate carbonation. Bland and amazingly dull."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was cloudy and had a very nice goldish hue to it. The beer had a very nice big white head that was very pleasant. The beer was very refreshing and was crisp and very clean to drink. I though the beer was nothing special but because it was so clean I gave it a goo rateing and will buy again."
"D: very drinkable APA, smooth and buttery. I could drink this as an all year session brew. Golf course worthy here in Florida."
"A bit thin, decent body but makes for an easy drinker, goes down easy. Not my favorite APA but better than average, a good summer ale."
"Pours a clear amber/golden yellow, medium size and thick white head forms, slowly drops to a medium layer, lots of lacing on the glass, looks pretty solid. Smell is nice, pineapple, very fruity, grapefruit and citrus, oranges, crackery/bready malts, otherwise all hops. Taste is not as good, lightly sour, oranges, grapefruit, honey and caramel, lemon sharpness in the finish, with a bready dryness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with slightly high carbonation, definitely detracts from the mouthfeel. Overall an average pale ale, but pretty solid. Aroma is nice but the flavour just doesn't match it."
"D - Have to admit that the beer grew on me. At first my ratings were a bit on the low side but as I drank, the beer changed a bit. I still like some of there bigger beers better but this is a good beer in it's own circle."
"D = Probably the best aspect of this beer is that it really does go down smoothly and coupled with a pleasant if uninspired taste does lead to a very drinkable beer everything considered."
" Even though it's a tad above 5% ABV, this is a very good session beer and would hit the spot on a nice summer day when a light (but not so light as to be disposable) beer is called for. I could easily see myself kicking back with a few of these and come lime chips, but since it's the heart of fall now, I'll consider this a less-than-extraordinary-but-still-solid American Pale Ale that is worth a try for those unaccustomed to this style."
"It pours a golden color with very active carbonation. The head is a little off-white and is incredibly thick and retentive. The smell is a nice grassy hop. A little bit of pine as well. Very fresh. The taste is out of this world. I have never had such a clean, crisp, and smooth APA. The hops are up front, grassy and floral then there is a very quick pale malt burst that has a sort of nutty character. Slightly soapy taste in the head. It ends with a tongue-tingling fizz then the flavor quickly fads until the next sip. Perfect summer beer. I could drink this stuff all day."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This would be a nice change of pace in pitchers for a session. Not a great beer but nice and light with a mild but distinctive taste."
"This beer pours a dark yellow-golden color with a very wisp head that quickly disappeared. Sweetness from the malt is present in the aroma along with a hoppy background and a hint of sweet fruit. Medium on the palate. The flavor is malt graininess with some round bitterness throughout. This is an average brew and that's that."
"Poured a clear golden with minimal carbonation and almost no head Some sediment found in glass. Aroma is unmistakingly Cascade hops sweet caramel malts. Flavor is citrus and pine backed by light fruity sweetness. Thin texture, abrupt bitter finish. Overall a nice smaller APA."
"A nice solid brew from Souther Tier here. For a pale ale it is quite hoppy but the best part of it is its drinkability. A great taste, light bodied, and a low enough ABV to not make you half in the bag. An easy drinker from a great brewery. I would definitely have this one again."
"This poured a clear gold with off-white head. It smelled like copper and lemon hops balanced with light barley malt. It tasted like wet caramel malt, with bitter copper and floral hops. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a brief bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean beer with good flavors, although they were a bit generic. It was very drinkable, but I fail to see what makes this an ""extraordinary"" ale. To me, it was quite ordinary."
"This is one really drinkable beer. I love it."
"Drinkability: A solid brew, and one that's easily sessionable. The complexity's lacing, the balanced is good, and it's tasty overall. I'm glad I got a six-pack. There are better examples out there, but this is a more mild sessionable version I would say, and I did enjoy it."
"Drinkability: An average pale ale from an above average brewery that I don't mind supporting. Alcohol's manageable, of course, and the hop presence is nice, but I wouldn't mind a little more out of this one."
"Drinkability - a good beer to pair with barbecue or a quality mett. Extraordinary? Of course not. A worthy session APA?? By all means."
"Golden body with a large sticky white head. Very impressive appearance! Pine and citrus nose. Citrus and floral hops in the flavour, along with some light malt. It reminds me a little of Anchor Liberty. Medium-light body with an aggressive carbonation providing a crisp mouthfeel. Extremely good drinkability - the crispness and nice hopping make for a refreshing beer, which would be perfect on a hot day."
"M + D: That carbonation that made the glass tough to fill makes the beer a little tough to drink. Carbonation is a bit intense and overdone, making the body feel a little more foamy and seemingly lacking substance (though I know that's not the case). If this could be overcome, it would be far more pleasant. I'd be willing to give it another shot to see what another bottle was like, though."
"Good drinkability, goes down easy."
"Poured out of the bottle into my glass with a one finger, nearly-white head that sadly displayed poor retention. Laces beautifully though! The color was a gorgeous true gold. Great aromas of citrus zest, some maltiness and fresh green hops. The beer was very smooth on my palate and had a nice liveliness on my tongue. Flavors of citric hops, honey, caramel malts and a hoppy finish. Needs a little more malt balance, especially at the end. Medium carbonation. Good example of an American Ale."
"Golden amber looks with a thin head, quite appetizing. Aroma of hops with a hint of orange peel and spice, also quite attractive. A sip of this will have you wondering if you misread the label, an interesting touch of cloves, lemon zest, orange peel in between spurts of hop bitterness. It's definitely a unique APA worth trying and with its smooth, medium body it is easily enjoyed."
"Don't drink and review."
"D- I quite enjoyed the aroma of this one, but the taste left something to be desired. All told I'd have this one again, but not at all living up to the other ST brews I've had."
"Drinkability: My first try from Southern Tier and I am very impressed. An excellent blend of malt and hops, with nothing too over the top. Not sure of ABV, but seems like a great session beer."
"D- Pretty drinkable. The aftertaste throws me off a little, but otherwise not a bad session beer."
"your average pale ale nothing special."
"D: Decent drinkability, drinks like a pale though flavor may get tiresome if drinking a six pack at a time."
"I had this beer as part of a 12 pack sampler. It is a nice orangey color. Smell has big hop notes along with caramel malt. Had a semi heavy mouthfeel. Taste has a lot of hop bitter, with some malt finish. I thought this was an average to slightly above average beer."
"tastes just like it smells, malty, hoppy, a little sweet. it finishes with some breadiness and a little spice. nice carbonation in mouthfeel. very drinkable."
"At the end I was happy to find out that the apple juice was isolated to the aroma. If it wasn't, then this beer would have been a disaster. It's not really an extraordinary Ale, but it is a rather decent sessionable one from Sothern Tier."
"I will not be buying another of these."
"It turns out that there's really nothing extrordinary about this pale ale (except that the brewing company thinks that the beer is extraordinary). But as pale ales go, it compares well to Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale even if it's lighter in body and taste. Very sessionable without requiring much thought. Regrettably, the beer probably falls in the ""forgettable"" catagory."
"D: Drinkable but not my favorite hops flavor."
"D : I'd probably pass on this one again. It's ok but not great."
"D: It was pretty drinkable but I think it would suit better for an IPA even though it was more malty than one."
"A pale gold color presented itself with a mild head that died quickly. A hoppy smell with citric notes, but nothing spectacular. For a pale ale the thing that struck me most was the dryness from it - the hops lent itself in this category more towards an IPA. The taste is rather subdued, with some citric notes such as lemon juice and some possible caramel malts. A medium-bodied beer that goes down smooth, I just wouldn't bother having this over and over."
"Notes: Overall it has a strong hop presence with an easy to drink, refreshing palate. Its good but I wouldn't call it extraordinary."
"There is a drink in greece made with citrus preserves you put in water, this is what it tastes like. Love it."
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with lots of little bubbles climbing up the glass. There is a two finger white head with great retention and some solid lacing. Lots of different aromas: passion fruit, grapefruit, citrus, and some spices including black pepper. Tropical fruit flavors lead to a mix of grapefruit and orange hops with a sweet fruity finish. Medium carbonation, light body, there is a cleansing mouthfeel like drinking soda water. Interesting beer worth a try but nothing special."
"MF&D - Good overall ale. I'd drink this one again."
"This is a great example of an american pale ale and gives me even more confidence to say that southern tier is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Very bubbly, goes down pretty easy. I'd disagree with the word 'extraordinary,' but it's decent. Not really anything I'd seek out though. There are much better pale ales."
"I put this one in the upper category of APA's since it's so full of flavor and fun to drink. Really strong hop flavor from the very first sip. Basic, gold, sort of boring color (it's unique enough of a beer to have maybe a little red/rye tinge to it.. that's what I would have done but I don't think that's what they're going for). A little astringent on the finish, sort of kills the all-out hop heaven you get to experience beforehand. Would buy again."
"drinkability- typical for an APA. The (over?) use of hops puts the beer to a slight imbalance but it is standard for the style. This is a decent example although there are better out there. Could be an IPA."
"D - Very drinkable, sessionable brew. Tasty, but still fairly light tasting. Sweet but not cloying. Very welll balanced."
"A good beer."
"Good mouthfeel, nice carbonation level and a pleasant aftertaste with no hints of dryness left behind on the palate."
"M/D - Medium bodied and slighlty chewy. Not a bad beer, just not something I would go back to."
"Drinks easy, a solid APA"
"pours an almost clear golden color w/ a decent white head which dissipates immediatly leaving little lacing in my nonic ; the subtle smell is predominately piney citrus w/ a hint of bread & nuts ; a slightly thin flavor, but a good one nontheless, more piney hop here w/ a mild bitterness and a crackerish malt backbone, some mineral in the finish tastes like an ESB; not really a dry beer, but has the feel of one, light-bodied w/ a decent level of co2 ; very drinkable, something i could easily drink all summer long..."
"this is a good beer, a bit style confused maybe, but it is a solid beverage to enjoy"
"Kudos for the interesting citrus notes that I kept trying to place, but exceptional turned to boredom midway thru the glass."
"Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is lightish. A good APA here with the hops definitely playing second fiddle for me so it's almost more of an English PA to my tastes."
"This is probably one of my favorites in the Southern Tier line, and I'd happily drink it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"Let's be honest, this isn't actually an ""extraordinary ale"". There are lots of good, solid pale ales out there, and this is but one of them. So maybe the name is misleading, but there's not a damn thing wrong with it either. Obviously pretty high drinkability here."
"This beer starts out with lots of promise, but is a slight let down. The beer pours a goldeny honey color with a smallish head that rims the glass and dissipates. No retention that I can detect. This beer is light bodied and quite carbonated. The smell is piney hop notes, some berry like citrus. The taste begins with some piney hop notes, nice bready malts, and some orange hints. There is a sweetish berry flavor to this beer in the backbone that compromises what could be some nice resinous, estery hop flavors. The cloying sweetness detracts too much from the hoppy base this beer should have maintained. The finish has an ever so slight tartness or tang, not bad though. The mouthfeel is a bit watery, but fine, and there isn't much aftertaste. It's a good, drinkable beer but not a great APA"
"Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass. Very slightly hazy orange yellow that left little to no head although it did leave white rings of lacing after each sip. The smell was a blend of citrus and hops. Candied orange with floral hop hints. Tasted decent with hoppy citrus flavors followed by a faint malty character. Decent carbonation with a slightly bready feel. Overall a decent beer though I felt the flavor fell a little flat. Worth trying but dont kill yourself trying to track this one down."
"D: Medium bodied and nicely drinkable pale ale, strong on the hops but does not get too carried away, tastes like a bitterer version of a Fat Tire."
"I liked it though I don't picture this becoming a regular staple."
"Orange colored beer with a quickly fading head.Aroma and taste are both citrus and malt.Light carbonation makes this a bit easier to drink.There is absolutely nothing remarkable about this beer.very bland and boring.Just another APA that is overhyped on this site!!"
"Drinkability: There's nothing particularly extraordinary about this beer in my opinion, but it's a nice session beer in the Sierra Nevada mold. I would definitely drink it again in the right circumstances."
"D - Great session beer, good representation of the style. Looking forward to enjoying more of these in the up coming summer months. Recommended."
"Thumbs Up all the way!"
"D: A nice APA from Southern Tier. The alcohol is very low making this warm weather sessionable!"
"Southern Tier usually does a lot better with their bigger bottled beers, and this one seemed pretty average and run-of-the-mill with a light, unassuming mouthfeel and good drinkabiilty..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Very crisp. Carbonation is very good and it's nice and smooth. Drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a pretty good offering from Southern Tier. I've had better of this style, but it's a pretty good option."
"Poured a pale golden color with a fluffy white head. Smelled of floral hops with a hint of some sweet malts and lemon zest. The taste was not what I was expecting. I didn't think it was going to be an APA. The bottle said extraordinary ale so APA didn't even cross my mind. The taste was grassy and floral hops with a citrus zing that was sweet and tart in the finish. I love this beer. I tend to not drink hoppy pale beer so I can't tell if its a great rendition of the style but its crisp and refreshing and overall a great session beer from a great brewery."
"Pale amber in color with a huge head that just keeps building-infected? Not quite a gusher but...Fairly hoppy aroma with a sightly sour bite to it. Somewhat malty flavor with a decent helping of bitterness. I get a very sharp, somewhat tart ""wang"" right up front. Ok mouthfeel-failry even and uneventful. The sharp flavor tends to detract from a fairly average beer. I think this may be off and will try again but overall a very average pale ale."
"I am trying not to over think this beer. It is a quality product with some great flavors. Easy drinking and enjoyable."
"I enjoyed this beer and am happy that my desire to explore paid off. This could def. make its way into the summer rotation."
"D-I'm glad I tried it, and it's good, but it's got no distinguishing features that set it apart from other similar styles."
"I found this one rather enjoyable. It had the hopiness, but it wasn't too overpowering. It's also just above the level of a normal session ale, but not too strong. Recommended."
"Light honey golden color with a thin but sudsy white head that clings a bit to the glass. First aroma of dry-hopped cascades, second aroma of nothing in particular, third aroma of pilsner-like malt. Flavor is more malty than hoppy - a slightly dry cracker malty I suppose. light-to-medium body - almost like a pilsner (I'm getting a lot of alarming pilsner qualities here from the color, aroma, body, and now even the flavor). The saving grace is the restrained ale fruitiness that pokes its head out on alternate sips (saving grace as in it is saved from suspicion that this really IS a pilsner). The finish is mildly bitter but shares with the dry malt, and dammit here comes that pilsner again. Extraordinary? Well the clear and bright color was nice, and I guess the whole pilsner aspect I detected could be considered extraordinary, but I really don't know what to make of this. There is something missing here though. Maybe the body, finishing hops (not dry hops) and aftertaste could be tooled around with, but I bet this would get better reviews if it came freshly cask-conditioned and people were told it was from England."
"Very drinkable overall, even if not one of my favorites for this style."
"The aroma of this beer was either oxidation or an intentional aroma produced by hops or yeast. The aroma was cardboardy, almost skunked. Either way, all of the bottles in this six-pack were not very pleasant. The body of the beer was thin and the presence of hops is negligable. I bought this beer expecting more based on some recommendations about this brewery. I can only hope that their other offerings are better than this one."
"It's certainly not a bad beer, and has a decent balance, but it's not something that I would go out of my way to obtain."
"D - Ok, not a great ale but not bad either."
"This is a good APA but far from extraordinary. The mouthfeel could use a little work, but otherwise it is very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Looks like a pilsnery pale ale with very little bubbles and a sparse had. The aroma is a little piney with some hard mineral dry malts. The taste is a little metallic,dry but sill pleasantly hoppy. Not as flavorful as expected. Prety light, refreshing, just pretty standard."
"D - Pale ales are so easy to drink, and this one is no exception. Just a tad thin in the mouthfeel department, but solid flavor and aroma overall."
"I think if you were to consider a beer for a typical, mainstream session APA, this one would be in the running. I mean, I might not consider it as extraordinary as they do, but neither can I solidly disrespect it. In fact, the sum of the parts yields a rather high drinkability quotient. So it's not as big, bold, or impressive as many other Southern Tier offerings. That's all right, because I'd feel at home with this most days."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy golden orange color with a large (about 3 inches) frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are very good. Aroma is mostly floral/citrusy hops, with a bit of grain and sweet malt in there too. Taste is the same as the aroma, more hops noticable than malt, but it's not a hop bomb either. Mouthfeel/body is light but with way, way too much carbonation. It almost seems like I'm drinking zippy little bubbles and not beer. Drinkability would be better if it wasn't for the high carbonation. I think if the carbonation was cut down a bit (maybe there was something slightly wrong with this batch), I would have enjoyed it a lot more. It tasted and smelled good, but the carbonation hurt this beer IMO. I'll try it again in the future and see how it is."
"Poured into a pint glass (Surly) a hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger plus foamy white head, lots and lots of sticky lacing follows. The nose is slightly sweet, malty, hoppy, nice little tones of citrus, slight spicy, and some caramel. The taste is sweet, malty/hoppy, citrusy, some spice, and caramel. The finish is slightly sweet/dry. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty APA."
"This is a really good beer for people who don't like beers. Bring it to a party, give it to your friends, maybe it will get them into beer."
"Flavor is redeeming, nice light citrusy hop bite, with lingering earthy herbal hops and a slight honeyish aftertaste long after it's gone. Hints of puffed wheat too, but not distracting in this pale ale. Moderate body, not thin, well balanced with ample carbonation. The glass disappeared in 5 minutes after the 1st sip, if that's any indication of being sessionable."
"Phin & Matts makes a great session beer. It is wonderfully light, with still enough body there to let you know you are drinking a fine micro brew. This beer makes a great beer for parties. It is light for the Miller Lite crowd, but has a nice hop touch for people looking for something a little more serious. Also if it is availble to you, it is a cylinder to have in the kegerator"
"pours a light amber in color, with 1 1/2 finger head, and average lacing. The smell is of grass floral hops and something i can only describe as plastic. The taste is much less offensive coming in with a grainy malt backbone and some grassy hops. A bit on the hoppy side for an APA but for me thats not a bad thing. The mouthfeel in drinkability are ok. Not as impressed as i am with some other things from southern tier, but not bad as long as i dont get my nose to deep into it."
"D_Phin and matt's extraordinary ale is a good description if you were to leave off the prefix. This is most definitely ordinary. Much better pale ales out there. Not so sure I should have bought the sixer. Oh well it is drinkable."
"D-- very easy drinking with this one so far into it....seems like it would make a GREAT session beer...could drink this baby all night...i WAS expecting a LOT more in taste and complexity...but i was not dissappointed...i will get this one again...would be great to have during partys with pizza and freinds and just hanging out when you wanna have a few in a row and not be smashed already.."
"Didn't really get much out of this one. The pour was very yellow, and as such, much lighter than I was expecting. This looked almost like a macro, but not quite. Smell was very average with some noticeable sweet, citrusy hops, and a bit of malt, but little else. Taste, too, was very forgetable. A bit of sweetness up front, followed by very mild hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was a bit more carbonated than I was ready for. Overall, a very average APA that's easy to drink, but not very exciting. Ho-hum."
"The drinkability is ok, not a great brew but worth a try it is diferent. MK"
"Pours a clouded golden brown with a big off-white head off a very aggressive pour that falls rather quickly. Nose is a typical citrus hop. Flavor is smoothly and mildly sweet with an even and not overpowering hop presence. Feel is nice. Good level of bubble on the tongue with a nice liquid feel. Drinkable yes. For being labeled an extraordinary ale, I don't find this one as such. It is still pretty good though and worth trying. (and very quaffable)"
"Pretty nice stuff. Would go well with most foods and satisfy a broad spectrum of moods."
"Appears with chill haze golden copper color forms a vibrant white head pretty thick as it dwindles a collar of lacing forms. With each sip after the first even lacing forms thinly in speckled patterns. Aroma has a light pale biscuit malt component with citrus peel and very floral hops arising. Mellow but you can detect grain and hop here that's a step in the right direction for anybody's flagship beer, let's see how those carry out in the flavor. Hoppy in the floral and citrus burp sense not overly bitter I'm detecting moderate IBUs possibly around 35 on the hop bitterness. Mild sweetness with pale malts bringing out biscuit and cereal grains with a mineral water harshness in the finish. Texture is pretty light this is pale ale light in a good way really light body with some thinner resinous slickness, and carbonation that's dead on. Drinkability is pretty effortless a good tailgating craft beer much flavor but light texture and crispness makes it flow with ease. A really great tasting and refreshing beer from one of my favorite all time brewers."
"Quite a nice beer. Recommended."
"Very average at best."
"drinkability: pretty refreshing after a bruising soccer match"
"Pours a pale color with minimal head. Aroma is nice and hoppy upfront with the maltiness shining through as well. Taste is very nice and toasty upfront with a mild bitterness in the middle. A second taste confirms the toastiness and malt that shows through much more than the hops. Feels more like a well-balanced English IPA but for what it's worth, it's a very drinkable ale that I could kick back on a hot day.Highly sessionable."
"Thanks BeerTruth... Keep those ST gems coming!"
"Drinkability: YES... highly recommended... I could enjoy a few of theses."
"This was fairly decent. I think it would pair well with spicy foods to cut the heat and still remain very drinkable."
"Not a bad beer though."
"Overall, I like this beer a lot. Fairly easy to drink, nice mix of flavors and well balanced. Enjoyable all around. Became more complex as it warmed."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very good beer to stick with for an evening unless you’re looking for something stronger. Otherwise, the beer is quite satisfying if you want something sessionable but with a lot of substance."
"Pours a clear golden color with a bubbly white head that leaves small bubbles along the top. Smell is earthy, piney hops, absolutely delicious for a Pale Ale. Taste is a smooth malt and earthy hops balance. Nice carbonation on this one makes this border on a session versus too filling for more than 2. I have loved everything from southern tier, very good beer."
"Pertfect beer. n easy drinker. Very refreshing."
"Funny, I had a Rogue American Amber last night and this reminds me a lot of a lighter version. The key here is there's a significant yeast character than blends with the caramel malt (the Pacman yeast for Rogue and whatever ST uses). The light malt body is surrounded by a tangy, but not strong, citrus hops note that lends a decent bitterness. Overall, the malt and overall flavor profile are a bit lacking. The hops aren't that distinguishable or complex, but this still makes for a decent session brew. Not bad, but definitely not great."
"Overall, a great session beer. Very easy on the palate but very tasty. Recommended."
"D- A very good session beer, I could see myself getting this again."
"That's exactly what this is - completely and totally mediocre. I could drink a few without batting an eye; neither in a good way, nor a bad. Pours a light gold, with little head. I found the color to be a bit watery looking. Taste has mild sweetness and a decently strong hop sense. Mouthfeel is pleasant and simple. drinkability is high - actually was a good experience on a hot summer day."
"The spicy hops that are noticeable in the finish, in my opinion, save this beer from a watery grave. Without them this is a bland, conservative ale. Certainly nothing ""extraordinary"" about it. While it probably won't find its way into my current beer rotation, it might appeal to fans of lighter, sweeter pale ales."
"Pours a clean copper color with a white head. Aromas of a dry maltiness and a small hop presence. The taste, well it is clean and refreshing, but not much to say, although it is good. A nice body, and no aftertaste. Session-ish, and a good palate clensor. All I can say it is just a good ale."
"Pours a pale golden orange color with an average with head that left so lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is rather faint for an APA, some real light citris hop. The taste is a bit odd. I am picking up some apricot flavors, a slight metallic taste, a quick citris hop taste and pale malt. The feel is light but not watery, crisp and well carbonated, balanced finish. A different take on the APA, with the apricot flavor sticking out for me. Good but not in the same class with Sierra Nevada."
"Jeff Cabral"
"A nice golden brown color but weak in head/lace category. Has an interesting smell of sweet malt, fruit nougat, a bit flowery. Tastes of sweet bread blended with a citrus highlight. Mildly carbonated and kind of watery. The flavor is sweet but has enough hops feel to keep it on the good side of the scale. Needs a little more body to really make this more desirable. Certainly worth a try and I would drink it again."
"a light amber color pour into a glass that never had much of a head from the get go. first hit was a slight piney and bitterness, again slight. the bitterness from the first hit seemed to dissipate as the drink went on. resembled a bully lager in terms of taste and smell more than a pale ale, in a good way, this is not a slam. would definetely recommend this for a picnic or all night affair. although not extraordinary , still a solid offering from Southern Tier ,who seldom disappoints. would buy this again."
"D: Very drinkable. No off tastes. Liked it a lot. Would definitely buy it again."
"Mouthfeel: Feels great! Southern Tier is a top tier brewery and this is one of it's best offerings, especially if you're a big fan of the Pale Ales,like myself."
"M/D - Very smooth yet crisp enough to make you want another sip. It's a warm, humid summer night and the beer is warm, but it still shined. The sweetness sticks to the palate and the drinkability is great like most Pale Ale's. I liked this beer a lot more than I anticipated and I would recommend it to anyone."
"Normally, I never judge a book by its cover, but they should re-think the packaging. It doesn't sell the product well at all, and even though I really like it, I don't pay attention to it on the shelf."
"Smooth with decent carbonation. Fairly dry. Light to medium bodied. Easy to drink. A decent well-balanced pale ale, though not ""Extraordinary"" IMO."
"Overall Impression: Awesome ordinary bitter style beer. Balanced to perfection. Has that delicious bitter bite that doesn't linger, which is great. This is a great session beer."
"Pretty average, all around."
"D- A decent malty ale, with a dryish aftertaste."
"This isn't quite to the level of Dale's as far as I'm concerned, but it's a good beer. I would definitely give this to someone who is transitioning out of American macros and into the good stuff. A good addition to the Southern Tier variety pack that I probably wouldn't have tried otherwise."
"A good drinker and an enjoyable session beer. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Outstanding. This is a sessionable beer indeed. Just wonderful."
"D- This is a great refreshing APA for anytime. Easy to drink and probably easy to session to. I'll probably have this one again."
"Overall: High drinkability because of its subdued bitterness. A nice beer to introduce a novice to the style. Nothing over the top. Just classic citrus, hop, and slight pine flavors."
"D - very drinkable beer, I may have to session this one."
"Drinkability is the real strength of this beer, a favorable and easy to drink ale."
"Pours out a light honey/iced tea mix with a good amount of bubbles in the body and a thinnish head. Solid APA nose with lots of citrus and some grassy tones. Toasted malt and toffee in the background, of course. Flavor is a nice mix of a not-too-clean malt base with its fruity esters and big citrus from the hops. Bitterness is rather minimal considering the hop flavors. Has a bitty of a jelly worm taste. Carbonation is mellow and pleasing while the body isn't too thick. Solid drinkability and a pretty flavorful APA."
"D- OK, but not a must have. Would be good for a session style beer."
"Phin and Matts Extraordinary Ale pours a crystal clear yellow gold. Aroma is sweet, almost wort like caramel malts. Flavor is smooth and malty, with just a twinge of slighlty metallic hops. Delicious and balanced, I'm definitely gonna have to get this one again."
"Overall- A nice easy Ale to drink. Not Extraordinary but good never- less."
"Carbonation is near perfect and helps with the balanced hop presence. Perfect ABV to knock down one after the other, and light enough to not stick to the palette too much. Maybe not extroardinary, but close."
"Phinn & Matt's pours a deep gold, borderline orange and just a little cloudy. There was a finger width white head that dissolved quickly but did leave some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is hoppy but not overpowering. The taste is fresh and clean. it is hoppy with a grapefruit bitterness that contributes to its crisp finish. This is a solid pale ale with a medium mouthfeel and good carbonation. Very drinkable and refreshing."
"Appearance is a little on the transparent side but that's okay. The smell is hoppy with hints of toffee. The flavor is a little bitter and definitely hoppy. Not too complex, but enjoyable none-the-less. Mouthfeel was somewhat too carbonated for me."
"Not bad but not to my fancy.I dont think i'll have it again.I'll pass next time."
"D - Very easy to drink and hoppier than most APA's. Also slightly sweeter to balance out the extra hops."
"This beer poured a clear light amber coloar and formed a small bubbly white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbation is present. An aroma of cascade hops and malt with some caramel. The flavor was of malt, hops, caramel and a hint of pine. The body was medium light with a slightly astrigent, yet sweet finish. Not a bad pale ale style."
"A bit thin in the mouth feel department. Easy drinking and would be a good brew for a cook out or a get together with friends...especially those who are macro drinkers."
"Overall, this is a watered down hot summer day variation of a Sam Adams Lager. Watery and simple yet good flavors. Ordinary in an extraordinary way."
"Medium body,creamy has a light feel to it.Extremely drinkable the lack of malt makes it a bit light,the great hoppy tastes makes it hard to stop drinking. Would be a good summer beer,very sessionable. Get it a try if you like hoppy beers."
"D: Middle of the road. I look forward to trying this again in the spring/summer months, and comparing it to these notes."
"Draft at KClingers Tavern Hanover PA. This beer presented itself in the image of a textbook amber beer with a thin sticky top. But it is well hopped ... oily, resiny, piney and extremely vicscuous! Excellent hoppy little ale with a solid underbody. (#2653, 1/14/07)"
"How can you not enjoy this beer? Pours a light copper color with mild citrus aromas. One of the most drinkable and delightful beers I have ever experienced. I was able to expose one of my ""non-craft beer"" drinking friends to this beer, and they loved it. This beer proves that it's the most extraordinary beer out there. One and all can enjoy this delicious brew. One of these days I plan on visiting Southern Tier and while there I will surely congratulate them on this fine ale."
"D- a great overall APA, hoppy deliciousness and what would be looked for in an alcohol and hop amplified IPA."
"Overall: This is a so-so APA. There's nothing bad about it, but the flavors are just too subdued."
"Poured a copper color with a thick white head with good lacing. Aromas are pleasantly hoppy with some mild malt in the background. Taste is hoppy but balanced by the malt flavor and semi-tangy sweetness. It isnt ""extraordinary"" but is certainly worth a go. I found this to be an all around good brew and something I would session most definitely."
"A nice pale ale with a nice Cascade Hop flavor. Definitely more hoppy than most APAs, but without losing balance. The APA for hopheads."
"Overall-Not a bad selection to try from JLMJL of the beer club. The mettalic taste and watery consistency hold this beer back from being really good. I would take Stoudt's APA or SNPA before this."
"D- This beer has a very nice hop complexity with a supporting flavor of soft malt with a nice subtlety."
"I absolutely love this beer. Slight taste of corriander, but hoppy. Not as hoppy as an IPA though. Very light foamy head that dissapears quickly. Very attractive copper color, that sets the tone for the beer. Pleasing drinkability, where you can drink a few and not feel full. Recommended for the beer drinker that likes slightly hoppy beer."
"There's nothing wrong with this beer, unless you're sampling it right after their infinitely tastier IPA as I am, which probably makes this seem weaker and plainer than it actually is. Drinkable, but lacking passion. Definitely go ith the IPA if given a choice."
"good beer."
"Thanks to the McHugh family for this one!"
"Brew pours to a dark golden color with a slight haze. Has a medium sized off white head that beaks down pretty quickly but does leave a thick layer of lacing down the side of the glass. It has a very enticing aroma, strong citrus hops and a solid biscuit like malt scent. The taste is very nice as well, notice the hops up front but also a very solid biscuit malt flavor, more noticeable than in the aroma. Also has a nice dry feel to it. This is a very good brew to me, has a lot of character both in its scent and taste. With its lower ABV, it is a good session brew for me. A very tasty flagship offering from Southern Tier."
"D - Looking for a quick hop fix in a lighter bodied beer, this is good, but not much of that balance I seek in an American pale."
"ONce again i have not been let down by the boys in New York. Poured a deep amber color with a decent amount of head. Had a great hop aroma, couldnt pick out what specific kinds definelty used more than one to get a really complex smell. Great taste, little piney but not to much. Would definetly want to try again."
"Overall, a very quaffable APA. Just a good all around beer. Very solid."
"I could easily drink a full six pack of this. It has the perfect blend of hops and malt, and a very enjoyable, slightly sweet flavor. Well-balanced might be the best way to describe this beer."
"Not a bad brew, easy enough to drink."
"Overall a nice drinkable session ale, that's a nice change of pace from the average pale ale."
"D-Nice and smooth with balanced flavors make this a fairly drinkable beer."
"As far as drinkability goes, nothing more than a little better than average."
"Pours an attractive, deep gold, nice white head. Aroma is enticing, brimming with fresh, citrusy hop notes. The flavor does not live up to the promising aroma, however - it tastes weak and anemic, with some citrusy hops, but not much malt to back them up. Reminiscent of vitamin c tablets crushed in water. Perhaps I was being suggestible, because I found the body to be thin with a faintly grainy, rough texture. Overall, a decent beer, but I was disappointed. I'd like to retry this to make sure I didn't get a bum keg."
"of their other brews much more than this one."
"Hazy-ish golden peach with meager white froth. Head has little staying power. Very mild citric aromas (lemon, grapefruit) and scents of turbinado laced with iron. Biscuit notes emerge in the flavor, unannounced as they are by the aroma, and are joined by some off-key bitterness that is at first grapefruit pith and then mostly dull, earthy and mineral. Medium carbonation, medium-light body, less-than-lively mouthfeel. ""Pales"" (no pun intended) in comparison to other offerings from Southern Tier. As I'm certain I'm not the first to proclaim, Phin and Matt developed a decidedly unextraordinary ale here. Decent but definitely not noteworthy."
"Cheers!"
"D: Decent session beer, really. I wouldn't call it extraordinary, but it's a satisfying APA. I always found APAs really boring, but a few recent ones have gotten me to change my mind a bit. A nice beer."
"Body is between light and medium, with plenty of carbonation and a crisp mouthfeel and clean texture. Very easy to drink."
"Okay, I was about ready to write these guys off. I'd tried a couple of their brews and was less than impressed...then I tried Phin & Matt's and my opinion of the brewery has been changed. This ale is rich, but smooth and easy on the finish. Classic APA tastes and aromas, however not quite as big as some of the others I've had. The mouthfeel was a little light, but with the easy finish I could see pounding down a sixer of these no problem."
"Slàinte!"
"I can drink a truckload of these... especially on a hot Summer day."
"A very respectable APA, and among the best of those I've had. Easy to drink and I could imagine this stuff is amazing on tap. Reccomended!"
"The mouth is dry with some sharp carbonation. Very drinkable, yet not very ""extraordinary""."
"Pours a hazy golden color, with a dense one finger head. Good retention and spiderweb lacing. Hoppy nose like cascade, with faint toasted malt aromas. Sweet toasted munich malt upfront, followed by floral and citrus hop flavor. Tame acidity in the aftertaste, and a hint of spicy saaz. The malt is indistinct but the hop flavor is showcased to provide a good balance. Light-medium body and even carbonation counteract a mild slickness that would otherwise compliment this style. Finishes semi-dry with a lingering noble hop spice and cascade fruitness. A nice american pale, but probably not worth seeking out."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Starts as hoppy/some malt but midway the hops kick in to the finish still a drinkable pale. $1.45 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Comments: I liked this APA. I would recommend it to all. Very tasty & full flavored without being overly bitter. Only detraction is that I find many of Southern Tier's beers to have the same hop flavor. They should mix up the hop bill..."
"Well rounded medium body with moderate carbonation. Went down easy and I wish I had another. Easily one of the best APAs I've had. Southern Tier once again outdoes their shoddy labels."
"D- Not half bad but nothing I'd go out of my way for, an easy drinking pale with an American hop flare. Certainly worth a try though."
"The beer is very easy to drink and would be very sessionable. Extraordinary? Maybe not, but quite tasty nonetheless!"
"Southern Tier should re-name their brewery Top Tier since that's where I think they reside when it comes to the best microbreweries in American. I've never had a ST beer that was anything less than delicious and Phin & Matt's Extraordinary Ale does nothing to convince me otherwise. It may not be Extraordinary, but it's a damn fine APA that I'd love to have access to. Thanks Calico."
"Frankly, I was not expecting much here, but this is a superior American Pale Ale. Very much worth seeking out."
"Very enjoyable beer! My brother picked up a six-pack of this from Upstate NY and I had one on Easter Sunday after dinner. It is a medium/dark gold in color with a small white head. The smell is a mix of alcohol and orange. The taste is strong, with the orange kicking in as part of the aftertaste. This is a smooth beer with a just a *bit* of a kick. This would be great to have on a spring or summer day."
"Notes: Not a bad beer. Very good and a nice break from the hopped up pale ales that seem to be the trend."
"mouthfeel is about right. medium/light. drinkability is pretty good. all in all a pretty middle of the road APA. decent."
"Pours a golden blonde with a clear bubbly body that leaves a 1in off-white head. The aroma is strong hops, lemon, honey, and a chalky sweet tarts feel. The taste is balanced, starts floural hoppy, with a slight herbal tea sweetness. There is a lemon honey presence that has a natural ""honeycomb"" taste. The floural hop presence is great, very different and the finishes is smooth with a soft creamy feel on the throat."
"Traditional and well-made aren't insults. I like this beer, and I think you will too. Just set your expectations. For anyone new to the style, this would be a good starting point."
"Pretty drinkable...I could have a few of these. Pleasant surprize...this usually is not my style; I bought it as a single just to try...I don't know about ""Extraordinary""...but I find I'm liking it very much."
"Not much of a head when I poured this - the small head faded quickly to a line of lace around the edge. Smell is fruity with a hint of biscuit. Color is a deep golden orange color with minimal carbonation. The fruitiness carries through in the taste with a strong malt backbone. The hops are pretty aggressive for an APA and give a grapefruit like bitterness to the brew which grows a bit tiresome after a while. I also detected a very slight metallic flavor in the finish. Really not a bad brew, but not extraordinary."
"Easy enough to drink, but the spiciness lingers..probably should be pared with cheese or chips to lessen the effects,"
"not as aggressively hopped as the IPA they make.. and it makes this one more drinkable. Of the two I wouold rather have this one to hang out with, I would definitely pick it up again if I come across it. ""Extraordinary"".. well, that is a bit much, but this is a solid APA."
"				~Benjamin Franklin"
"Wow it smells so different..I mean it has caramel malt and some hops like most other pale ales, but I was told it was difefrent so I FEEL like it smells different. Well here is something different...most APAs have some semblance of a head and this one doesnt...at all. Just a light orange/yellow color and a wisp of white film on top. Fore is pretty nice..lots of a caramel malt with a little tinge of citrus kissed hops toward the back end. Its fairly tasty, but not at all different."
"D: Unfortunately, this ""extraordinary"" ale is only ordinary. Nothing about this beer is bad, but nothing really does it for me either. There are too many other good APAs out there to drink this again."
"A clean amber beer with orange highlights. Has a small foamy off white head. The aroma at first has a floral hop character then a piney hoppiness takes over. As the beer warms a smooth malt note comes out of the background. There is a light sweet malt note at the tip of the tongue. Followed by a nice easy tea like bitterness with a grapfruit finish."
"A different pale ale, but still very enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Overall, a very drinkable, balanced, somewhat complex and interesting, but somehow still smooth brew. Definetely one though hard to find (at least where I am), well worth seeking out."
"Overall, this is an easily consumed brew. I really liked it regardless of the non-complexity. Just a good ale overall. Get your hand on it. Southern Tier is solid!"
"Pours golden. Foamy head, not as much lace as their IPA. Smell is floral with a hint of pine. Mouthfeel is light,with little carbonation. Taste is lightly hopped,with a piney finish. This reminds me of a lighter version of Sierra Neveda Celebration Ale.Not bad for a lighter beer."
"Yellow color with a slight tint of orange. Not much head and zero lacing. Also very little noticable carbonation. Smell is faintly citrusy. Taste is malty, some bready notes. Sligtly oily mouthfeel and a little on the watery side. Slightly above average beer that would be good for drinking at a picnic or football game. Might be a good crossover beer."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is not bad, but overall this beer doesn't pack as much as I was expecting. Overall the body isn't too heavy, but just enough for a refreshing pale ale. Drinkability is moderate to high on this beer as its easy to drink and tastes overall prett ygood. I would have another...might just get one."
"Serving from a 12oz bottle, pours a nice golden color with a thin head. Not bad!! Wasn't expecting much from this beer, but it's worth buying again. Great price @ 6.99 for six pack, has a nice bitter taste that goes down smooth. Extraordinary, not exactly, but still very good."
"This is a nice drinking APA and a very good representative of the style."
"Drinkability: Lively on the palate. Solid across the board. I'm really diggin' this brewery."
"Drinkability: superb drinkability, a definite session pale ale. Worth seeking out."
"This poured a hazy yellow-orange with no head. The smell had some faint citrus, but nothing else. The taste was slightly bitter, some piney hops not much malt. Medium mouthfeeI with low carbonation. I am not getting much out of this. It seems very average."
"D - This is definilty a sesion beer. I enjpy it thoroughly."
"I really enjoyed this one. If I had more than one on hand, I would be able to testify that's is an easy drinker, but I'll just have to predict that it is for now."
"The taste is hoppy,but not bitter.There is a definite citrus flavor,grapefruit or orange?,that's refreshing. The m/f is medium with a full coverage of your whole mouth.I would say this is a good beer and I would try it again."
"A swirling, dirty yellow hue, a capsized white head. Juicy hops and a massive freshly squeezed grapefruit nose. Its expected, yet nicely donea bitter blast of juicy and piney hops, very clean malts noticeable and blended nicely. Bubble gum texture, tenderly sweet, very mild carbonation. Traces of orange peel and lemon, a definitive citrus hop palate. This is pretty good stuff, tasty and well rounded. Dont serve ice cold."
"Pours a very hazy orangish-yellow with a small white head that doesn't stick around, but leaves lace. Smell is a pleasant peppery orange with Lucky Charm marshmallows. Bland damp dank dull vegetable and oatmeal flavors churn on the tongue until an astringent bitterness gives a bite as it turns to a watery finish. Seem like sloppy hop usage, possibly the with the awful Amarillo virus. Feel is light and slick. Not impressed."
"Clear amber color with a medium light beige head and thin patches of lacing. Aroma of malt, fruit and hops. Medium-bodied and nicely balanced but the flavor is a little weak. Mild hops, sweet malt and some tropical fruit flavors are there but are subdued. The finish is clean and sweet, making this beer really easy to drink from start to finish. Extraordinary? No. Above average? Yes."
"12 ounce bottle, w/o freshness information. Pours light honey/ almond and clear. Head is tightly packed and off white. This one leaves well developed, fine lacing. Nose is brightly of grapefruit. Tasty pale ale, meaty, citrusy hops up front, overlaid on a well made bed of malts. Balance, flavor, smooth mouthfeel. Nicely crafted creation from STBC. Go get some."
"While this is not a hop bomb, bitterness seemed a hair out of balance. This is an okay beer, but too thin in body."
"Enjoyed this very much and will buy again."

"Nice pale ale that almost borders on an IPA from Southern Tier; I still haven't had a bad beer from them."
"Mouthfeel is easy and light, and this is highly drinkable. Not my favorite APA ever, but an easy drinking beer- perhaps not reeeally extraordinary... but not ordinary."
"Had this from the bottle, pours a mid golden color with a decent head. This beer smells of hops and citris. The citris comes though in the taste with a slight bitterness, but not a bad one. After thinking a while it has a grapefruit taste to it. The mouthfeel is one of light carbonation. A drinkable beer indeed."
"Drinkability is great. Cannot complain at all. These ones go down smooth and fast."
"One of the better American APA's I've sampled, but it could very well be called an IPA. This one would be a staple in my fridge if it were available in my region. Many thanks to my fellow BA for supplying this magnificent ale."
"Extraordinary? Maybe not, or maybe I'm too jaded. But if it's not extraordinary, it's certainly well above average. Enjoy."
"Woahh, delicious. I had this on tap at McGregors Perinton. A glorious 20 Ouncer. This came to me with barely any head but looked great, a nice golden orange color with decent lacing. The smell was very citrusy and hoppy. This smelled and tasted a lot more mild than the other southern tier offerings, and I love the stronger ones but this is a great idea. It is a lot more drinkable but still has a great amount of flavor via floral hops and citrus flavors, you just aren't bombarded with pine trees this time around. It is nice and malty too. A good balance. The mouthfeel is carbonated, sorta crisp but soft at the same time."
"Drinkability is high. This beer could make a good introduction to the hops for a macro drinker. Its not a slap you in the face with hops beer, but the hops definitely make their presence known."
"Very OK beer but nothing more to me. Near crystal orange-red pour with a very thin fluffy white head that faded quickly. Hops and some sort of fruit are the clear nose winners. About the same on the tongue at first giving way to decent malting. A good summer beer for certain and I suspect I would have enjoyed it much more if it were better chilled and I was outdoors. I will revisit."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This brew is a golden orange color with a thin white head. Its a little haze too. Its got an intense, grapefruit hop aroma. Floral, resiny, citric hops dominate the nose. Theres a little sweetness up front, and a nice, rounded maltiness throughout. This is a pretty well balanced brew, tipped just slightly on the hoppy side of things. Finishes with a solid hoppinesspine and citrus. Id like this as a session brew."
"12 oz bottle provided by shippos...thanks much! Pours a one-finger nearly white head over a cloudy tangerine colored liquid. Smells mildly hoppy of oranges and tangerines. Has a malt sweet below this, but I can't place the style. Taste is gently sweet with late rising hop flavor in the form of oranges, a citrusy pine, and woody character. Apricot esters rise in the middle and play with the hop flavor. Hop bitter is low and there is a biscuit malt character. Md body and mildly carbonated. Nice easy drinking APA. Well done to get the hop flavor without an overbearing hop bitter."
"Though this beer is complex and intriguing, it doesn't leave me in the mood to have another. So this isn't an everday drinking beer, more a quality novelty."
"Poured out a dark lemon color with a thin head which stayed a while. Smell consisted of strong juicy, citrusy hops with little malts in the background. Taste started out with a shot of malts with the hops taking over in the middle and in the end. Very citrusy with grapefruit flavors showing the most strength. Mouthfeel was medium with some good carbonation. Overall it was decent, just nothing mind blowing."
"I have to begin by remarking on the head, which was thick, with a lemon-yellow color that reminded me of Weis Markets' Lemon Chiffon ice cream from when I was a kid. There was a zesty hoppiness on the nose. The beer was a crystal-clear golden color. It had a light, pleasant mouthfeel and an overt sweetness both on the palate and at the finish to offset the hoppiness. I found it very refreshing for a muggy summer day while sitting on the second floor back balcony. A definite candidate for a session beer."
"taste is tangerine & grapefruity hops surrounded by more berry and earthy sweetnesses. tea leaves are brought to mind. light overall, super drinkable and puts the IPA to shame, especially when tasted side-to-side. carbonation tingles my mouth and the finish is mildly bitter for some variety against the summer tone. adds substance and aftertaste which quickly dissipates to encourage further sippage. about as close to an A+ for summer as you can get."
"Very good balance of taste between maltiness, hops, and some fruitiness. At the same time, it is not terribly heavy which is unusual for a dark ale but makes drinkability even better. Mouthfeel is good depite this."
"This is one of the only available craft brews around here, as I'm up at Lake Erie (Western New York side) for the summer. There's also the ever-present Sam Adams and Sierra, but I thought this seemed more appealing. Appears a bright and very clear orangy amber color, small head, really nice lacing. The first thing I thought when I smelled it was ""Great Lakes Burning River", but it ended up being different, though still really good. Smell is hoppy and very citrus oriented, offering lots of orange peel flavors in the taste as well as some other citrus fruits. A nice malt backing and an awesomely sweet but subtle honey character, with a nice piney bitter finish. I'm definately going to be getting this again, it's a spot on Pale Ale that's especially great for the summer."
"Pours a clear golden with a white one finger head that is gone pretty quickly not leaving much lace behind,evergreen pine aromas here and quite heavy at that with an underlying caramel sweetness but the pine is main attraction.If you like a well balanced pale ale then this is your thing,a dose of citric hops hits up front but the firm caramel/biscuit backbone of this beer melds extremely well with the hops just making this beer not only well balanced and flavorful but very quaffable.I really enjoyed this brew I would say its ""extraordinary""."
"Taste is on the dry side, almost chalky, leafy. Fair amount of bitterness at the end, but turns a bit nondescript. Slightly lacking in body. Would be best with a meal rather than as a stand-alone."
"This one is much better on tap than from the bottle. Overall a great session brew - I prefer Southern Tier's IPA - It actually is my favorite."
"Interesting take on the style; not really what I look for in an American Pale. The typical hop flavor is almost overshadowed by the maltiness. Pleasant for the season, but not on that I'll go back to."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" white head over the golden brew. Head, what there is, lasts pretty well, and lacing is average to good. Aroma is piney hop leaves. Taste starts with sweet pale malt, then carries through into an unexpectedly well-balanced hops character for the style, with a crisp pine shot at the close. Mouthfeel is excellent, and drinkability is even better. Check this one out, especially for this warm weather we got going on right now."
"12 oz bottle. Gloden, clear, thin white head. Very fresh hop aroma. Flavor is dominated by fresh hop flavor. Not overly bitter. Malt is in the background. Hoppy finish. This seems to be intentioned as a hoppy refreshing and light beer, and is very well done."
"The more I consume high-proof, incredibly complex imports, the more I appreciate the simplicity of a good pale ale. This one here is hoppy, smooth, and incredibly drinkable. It looks nice and smells nice as well, but the flavor is incredibly well balanced. Thank good for good APA's like this one. Had this one at Tulune's."
"Hoppy and Malty, and carmel. Dark Golden. A smoother sweeter member of the North American Grapefruit hophead series of beers. Bold fruit but lemon in finish. Medium mouthfeel. Not much head or lace. Altogether a fine refreshing start to Radekfest, and thanks to the Yankee who served it up.Had on tap a year later and enjoyed hoppiness and fruit though dring."
"It is not sweet, but it is a tad thin...the carmelized malts are what stay w/ me throughout the pint. The taste is slightly bitter and the finish is quite dry. A fairly drinkable brew...real glad I had the chance to try this beer...Southern Tier keeps impressing me with their offerings."
" A surprisingly drinkable lighter shade of Pale Ale."
"Nice pale ale, nothing special either."
"The tastes was very balanced, but elements still stood out. Since i was orginally thinking this an IPA I first noted is fruity hop character, but then noticed more of a malt background than I was expecting.. I wrote it off as a balanced IPA and gladly ordered another. Very drinkable this stuff!"
"Prosit!"
"A slightly hazy, golden-orange amber body is capped by a full head of frothy bright-white foam that holds fairly well before dropping to a standard collar. Lacing is limited. Bright and citrusy Cascade hops greet you in the nose over a delicate biscuity maltiness. The body is medium; and its slightly restrained carbonation lends just a tingle to the tongue. The malt is much more prevalent in the flavor than the nose suggests, and its dryish, biscuity character works as more than just a backdrop to its hoppiness. It's full-flavored and well-balanced with maltiness up-front; hop flavors across the middle and into the finish; and a bold bitterness that cuts through the biscuity and caramel-drizzled malt to dry it out in the end. Quite a respectable American pale!!!"
"This beer poured up with a thick foamy head that lingered before fading. The color a honey amber. It has a nice hop nose. Flovor starts subtle but builds with hops that linger in the after taste. This beer is very drinkable, a good session beer. I would say that this is the best beer fromm Southern Tier but that doesn't take anything away from the others in the line. I would and have suggested this to many people."
"slight bit of caramel malt in the taste followed by a balanced hop character and a thick resiny mouthfeel. more restrained in the taste. very very drinkable and sessionable."
"The beer pours a burnt gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nicely balanced scent that boasts of pale and carapils malts along with a heavy dose of floral hops. The taste is good also. It has a rich malty flavor that goes down smooth and slow. It finishes bitter and quite hoppy. The grain bill is complex and well balanced. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great American pale ale. It has great aroma and taste; a good drinker."
"Pour is a woody orange sorta color with a rather weak head the leaves abruptly. Carbonation seems a bit weak but not too bad. Smell is really grapefruity, i notice the cascades right away, then there's a yeasty freshly baked bread note in there as well. The body might be a bit on the light side, but overall I'd say it's medium and works really well for the balance of flavors in this beer. Lots of complexity in hop flavors here. There's a good dose of flavoring and bitterness here. Almost borders on IPA levels but the malts come big when they come giving this beer remarkable balance. Sweet fruit mixes with the grapefruit. Estery flavors are there. I'm getting caramel and maybe macademia nuts. There's a really interesting hit of hops midway through that gives me a unique apple bitterness. The bready yeast provides something special underneath. Finish leaves me with oily hop resins, yummy! This is a seriously sessionable beer, one I can see myself going back to many times."
"Nice candied piney hop aroma smells fresh. Small, foamy yellowish cream colored head fades quickly to a film leaves some nice lace. Transparent apricot colored beer with streams of carbonation making a break for the top. Piney hop flavor up front is a bit sweet, but tasty. Mild, lightly sweet malt flavor underneath pops out towards the end, and a pinch of bitterness cuts all the sweetness at the end. Finish is pretty clean. Moderately light body. A stale grain flavor that fades in and out detracts from an otherwise tasty and enjoyable beer."
"Tongueland: The hop blend is oily/piney Goldings and citrus/fruity. Citrusy up front with oiley (but not overly) piney finish. Stellar."
