"This is a solid pale ale.  Nothing stands out remarkably, but it's easy drinking and traditional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor starts out great with grassy Cascade and doughy malt.  Good malt to hop balance.  As it warms though it gets a little bland champagne-y. Medium body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful, honey hue with just a touch of head. Some pine, definitely a ton of Cascade in there. Some floral notes and noticeable bitterness. Clean and fresh as can be on the palate. Excellent balance. Medium mouthfeel, aftertaste  of pine needles. This is a BIG pale. P.S. This was about 2 weeks old. Amazing fresh."

"Very nice pale ale. Great aroma, smooth taste."
"Hoppy for a pale, and refreshing--just the way I like it!"
""
""
"Smells bad, looks good, taste better than expected, feels ok."
"On tap at Troegs.  No nose.  Low Ibu and sweet but tasty anyways."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a pale, golden coloring, with a steady flow of carbonation and a sparse, clingy, white head. Aromas of subtle floral notes, bittering hops, and a toasted backbone. Flavors are heavily roasted forward, with a solid dose of resinous hops, pepper spice, floral notes, and a toast backbone. Light and crisp bodied, with a tangy sweet and slightly bitter aftertaste. The finish is dry, smooth, and clean. Pretty tasty and damn drinkable."

"BOD 8/17/14.  Clear light amber pour that is slightly darker than golden.  Very nice head with normal lacing and retention. Light nose of citric and floral hops over a light biscuit.  Light medium bodied with an almost slick texture.  Perfectly carbonated with an exceptional effervescent finish.  The flavor profile is exceptional - intense, balanced, clean and somewhat complex.  It begins with a wave of blended hop flavor (pine, citric and a touch of spice) over a light biscuit background.  The middle is a medium bitterness that is mostly pine, but also has grapefruit rind aspects,  which fades into a very light caramel.  The finish is quite effervescent and yields a nice dryness.   A mild bitterness lingers that has a bit of pepper and caramel sweetness.  An outstanding Pale Ale."

"Malt and citrus aromasa. Nice carbonation and color. I get citrus and hop flavors quite abundantly. The balance is very nice(as is in most of Troegs beers). The carbonation is normal and the mouthfeel is well alanced with just the right amount of sweet and pine to make a great, easily drinkable brew!!!!!"

"O: I really like this beer. It's quite a complex flavor for a pale ale. I can detect the different components through the finish. The balance is very nice with this beer and it drinks smooth. It will appeal to a lot of drinkers I think. The very last thing on the palate is that of chewing on fresh barley malt. The biscuit and bread crust flavors seem to shine through a well hopped beer. I will buy more of this."

"O: I've always overlooked this one in lieu of everything else Troegs makes - I mean, it's just a Cascade-hopped pale ale for cryin' out loud. How many of those exist on the shelves, after all? But, the way it shows off nice fruitiness (lime, primarily) with minimal bitterness puts it a cut above most other examples of the style. I'd have no trouble drink 2 or 3 of these in a sitting."

"Wonderfully hoppy pale ale that has a medium bitterness that grows on you. It is rich, but not heavy. Love the smell. The modest alcohol content allows me to have several pints. Of course it tastes best right out of the tap from Troegs Brewery right here in Hershey. I think it's their best beer, but I know there is some disagreement on that."
"O- a nice above-average Pale Ale."

"Bottle from trade. Thanks! Pours a clear golden color with a nice small fluffy white head. Aroma is floral with some nice citrus and herbal notes. Flavor is a nice juicy light citrus with mild bitter and a sweet malt backbone. Goes down easy with plenty of carbonation. Nice simple exposition of the style. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a really pretty straw color, with a touch of haze and a modest head. The smell is a nice subtle mix of hops and breadiness, pretty much what you'd expect from a decent APA. The taste follows through; nothing to write home about, but nice. A solid everyday kind of beer, that would be enjoyed by almost anyone."
""
"Overall, there's very little to critique in the way of making improvements. A bit higher alcohol content might be nice; it's just a touch thin. But really, this is an APA splashed with quintessence. All the core scents and flavors are present with a hint of charm from others in fine balance. Whenever the scratch options aren't exciting, I count on this standard for a satisfying experience in the Troegs tasting room with or without food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: this is a really solid APA in my opinion. its light and refreshing, but has nice juicy flavors in here combined with that fresh biscuit and finished with the light bitterness that makes this a great warm weather drinker. only thing against it would be feels a little watery - but it doesn't really effect in a negative way."
""
"o: A very good pale ale which although lighter in color than most pale ales, ultimately seems more traditional than the relatively hopped up American versions we tend to encounter today. Not that I don't like that, just what this one isn't.."

"Solid brew, good pale ale with some flavor to it. Hops accentuate the brew, rather than dominate."
""
"Overall, not bad. Definitely a bit more of the pine/citrus rind hop profile, which I am not crazy about. If that's your thing, then this does not disappoint in quality, though."
""
"O- This is a good easy drinker. Nice and mild, but still flavorful enough to keep coming back for more. Well done."
""
""
""
"O: While APAs are admittedly not my favorite style, I found this one to be very drinkable on my most recent session with it. This one is hoppy enough to give it a nice bitter bite, but its rounded off well with some malty sweetness so it's not too palette-busting. An overall decent choice that's widely available in my area. I might go back to this one in the future, solely for its easy-drinking qualities."

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
"Overall: Troegs has a great lineup in my honest opinion. This isn't their best offering but a really nice brew for a hot summer day or any other time of the year. This doesn't do anything to push the envelope or anything (nor does it claim to) but a good refreshing representation of a pale ale done right"
"Pours clear and golden with some friendly bubbles coming up from the bottom. A faint finger plus a little more of foam that fell pretty fast to some sticky lace. Nose is amiable, bright with cascade hops, juicy and fruity with some grass underneath. Malt is deliciously sweet on the nose with biscuit, bread and honey. Taste is crisp, light with a mild astringency and a grainy aspect of the malt sweetness. Broad leafy hops give a touch of bitter and a kiss of orange while the malt stays ample and sweet. This is an enlivening pale ale that keeps it’s bitterness in check leaving the palate open to a variety of foods. So far Troegs is a go to brewery for good session beers"
""

""

"Overall, I find this beer incredibly drinkable! The body is light enough as to where you can drink a few on a hot day but not session them. Preferably they would imbibed indoors in the AC. At first this beer is not at all that bitter but by the end of the glass there is an aftertaste for sure making this a tough beer to recommend as a transition beer from pee-water but making it an excellent example of an APA! This one is tough to score. I don't like the slimy feeling on my tongue and will have to take points for that but all in all, EXCELLENT! 4 out of 5!!"

"Beer is medium-bodied, with low to medium-low levels of carbonation, resulting in a smooth, lightly foamy mouthfeel that's easy on the palate and flows relatively well. Closes fairly dry, with lingering bitterness enhancing this parameter across the palate. Residual stickiness is moderate to low."

"O: A nice, highly drinkable pale ale with a great balance of hops and malts. Quite simple, but it is a pale and not an IPA"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.25 - definitely the most sessionable offering that I've had to date from Troegs, very well-balanced with a pleasant blend of Noble and PW hops, would go well with or without food, N.B. the innocent maiden cousin of Nugget Nectar or Perpetual that is worth seeking out if you want something sessionable/low alcohol and clean tasting"

"O: this is a pretty decent pale ale, especially if you are a fan of the bready/grainy ones, refreshing and easy drinking, not a bad beer at all."
""
"O: I only picked up a single of these to try but I'd rather have a 12 pack."
""
""
""
""
"Pours an attractive golden amber with limited white head. Decent mouthfeel. Hop-forward aroma has a tropical fruit focus with a decent malt backbone. Balanced flavours of sweet caramel and toffee tones with pineapple, mango and other fruit tones. The mild but bitter finish lingers for a respectable time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- A fine pale ale. It is very good, but there are better ones out there. Although its worth a try if you like lighter and/or grainy beers."

"I'm new to Troegs, but have heard great things. So far I've only tried their pale ale, Perpetual IIPA, and rye IPA, but they do an awesome job. While this is certainly a hop-forward, modern American IPA, it's a great brew. I wish I could get my growler refilled in Colorado."
""
"O: Not my favorite beer from Troegs, but certainly not bad. As American Pale Ales go, it's fairly generic. It relies perhaps a bit too much on its hop profile, as so many APAs these days do. I found the sweetness (crystal malt?) to be a touch off-putting too. A little bit more malt character would go a long way, as would a less heavy-handed dose of hops. Still a refreshing quaff, and worth a try."

"Not a bad pale ale. A bit aggressively bitter without the hoppiness."

""
""
"O-a solid pale ale with good flavor, refreshing on a hot summer day"
""
""
""
""
"I recommend this beer while we still have the warm (hot) summer days. You won't regret pulling it from the fridge."
""

"Overall, good pale ale for craft beer enthusiasts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium to slightly light bodied, medium carbonation, pretty crisp overall feel. Dry with a slightly lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Very drinkable and very well made contemporary APA."
"Overall: this is a pretty tasty and drinkable pale ale, although I could live without the strong perfume in the aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a golden straw color body with a nice 2""white foamy head that stays a while. The smell is of pine and hops. It has a nice hop taste with a slight bitterness to it. Also it has a nice malt flavor to it also. It has a excellent mouth feel and is well carbonated and is easy drinking. Overal a good APA."
"Overall: I love a hoppy beer, but the other flavors just don’t quite come through. Not a bad beer at all though, I could have several of these in one sitting. Just a little one-dimensional."
"Not my go-to style but I always enjoy a solid beer from Troegs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid pale ale which would be great with a meal but I couldn't do more than 2 or 3 as the bitter bite would wear thin, but the hops are balanced well and it does finish clean."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This seems to be a nice classic pale ale, a little maltier than Sierra Nevada’s but still with a nice Cascade hop bite."

""
""
""

""
""
""

"Crisp, grainy and dry. Lighter in body but it holds together very well. Hop presence is slightly mellow and really only coming through enough to present the palette with a touch of pine and balancing the malt to finish super dry. Refreshing, good, clean and pretty standard. I'd never grab this over hop back though which has the same sessionability, availability, and price tag."
"Overall a good beer, especially for the warm weather. Kind of like a Troegs ""Nugget Nectar"" light."
""
"A unique, flavorful APA, for sure. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm looking forward to drinking the rest of this with some pizza while taking in the Bruins game tonight. Definitely in the upper tier of pale ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A nice pale ale but there are easily better options available."
""
""
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a small mellow grapefruity hop. In the taste, a grapefruity hop and the dryness of the rind. A small hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry grapefruit rind in the aftertaste. A really nice hop presence for a pale ale, almost on the verge of an IPA."
""
""
""
"This is a fine staple beer while watching a ballgame or after physical work."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A very standard brew through and through. Nothing bad, but nothing too exceptional either."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a good pale ale, good amount of hop flavor, not Sierra Nevada's pale ale, but still easy to drink"
""
"O/D-A very solid APA. I would like to see more beers available in this style. Hoppy enough to maintain my interest, but a good choice when you want something a bit more mild than an IPA. A solid beer. At under $10 a sic pack, I am pretty happy with how this one worked out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brownish orange beer with a soapy head and light carbonation. Has aromas of floral and citrus with some hints of yeast and caramel. Tart, floral and juicy orange flavors with a tea aftertaste. Enjoyable flavors; the hops, however, bite a little too hard for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - not my favorite Pale Ale, wouldn't buy this individually"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Compares favorably to a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale minus the very bright citrus and pine. Worth having again."
""
""
""
"If and when I go to drink a APA again, this would not be my first choice."
""
""
""
""
"It leaves a nice lace too. Overall, this is a nice experience and might make a good ""starter"" APA. I recommend it for that purpose and for nice session drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Drinks very easily."
""
"MO-Goes down easy. These guys are becoming a favorite. I will go with this one again."
""
""
""
"overall a damn good session pale ale. nothing unique necessarily, just a well made easy drinker here. pours standard pale ale color with a 2 inch head. smells and tastes well balanced with a mix of hop varieties. quick crisp finish and bright carbonation make the mouthfeel just right. this is an all season all situations beer that is as versatile as it is drinkable. not my favorite troegs brew, but a solid day to day beverage. will undoubtedly buy this again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one poured a bright, clear yellow with minimal head and some lacing. Aromas were mild - mostly hops and some pine ... but nothing overpowering. Flavor was a great balance between the hops and malt - light in body and a clean, crisp finish. A very simple but great session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a smooth, easy drinking pale ale. The flavor profile is moderate, but for a pale ale its solid and rather complex. This is one of the first craft beers I had when in college, and I get more whenever I can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours copper yellow with a thick, fluffy head like a cross-section of a slice of white bread. Lacing indicates sticky hops (and it's right). Smell is piney hops with a sweetness behind it, sort of a glutinous smell. Taste is spicy, piney hops up front and biscuity malts in the back, with an almost cidery note in there somewhere. Mouthfeel is pleasantly carbonated. Not a bad APA at all, but there are better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is crisp and creamy at the same time, with a light body and light fizzy carbonation, and then a slightly bitter finish that's sweet and almost clean. An excellent pale ale, top notch, and a definite session beer. A very high recommendation, this is a tasty and refreshing beer."
""
""
"Poured into a Pilsner glass. Has a light coppery color and a light not very long lasting head. It has some nice carbonation and is pretty hoppy. It has a kind of sweet malty taste with a nice crisp finish. Overall I enjoyed this beer. It is something on the lighter side that I wouldn't mind having a 6 pack of in a sitting. Very enjoyable."

"Overall a pretty good pale ale; more robust than most"

"Overall: A really solid pale ale, another great offering from Troegs. An excellent ""session"" beer (ok, it's 5.4% ABV, so not quite) with plenty of character. One of my favorite APAs."
"Quite the easy drinker. Could definitely have a few."
"This definitely ranks amongst the best Pale Ales you can get. It blends all the flavors perfectly and gives off one of the best hop flavors you can get without it being an IPA."
"Overall, a good offering. Can see drinking several of these with a light supper."
"O: This beer didn't smell like much, but the taste was pretty good, and the mouthfeel was really smooth. I liked this one slightly more than the Stoudts."
"O: A fine representation of the style. Not trying to be something it's not. I could drink a few of these . . ."
"Overall: a good brew for session or BBQ drinking. I will buy a another case for a staple to keep in the fridge. Good but still not my favorite American pale ale."
"overall impression: a good pale ale. not my normal style so I'm not the best judge to provide comparisions. a beer I would drink again though."
"This is a good solid mix of a pale ale that doesn't try to be a borderline IPA hop bomb. Lets the malt come through and eventually dominate but gives enough presence to make a statement. Easy drinking as well. Solid Pale Ale here."
"Poured a 1.5"" white head. Clear color is golden verging on amber. Smell has malt plus an interesting floral aspect to the hops. Taste is far richer than either the smell or my expectations prepared me for. The hop bitterness carries through in the aftertaste and is refreshing. There's also a slight acidic zing to the beer which perks me up. Quite a respectable pale ale."
"D- Could drink quite a few of these."
"Almost no head over a clear, copper body. Aroma is sourdough bread with a large fruity character. Grapefruits and tangerines. Flavor has a solid malt backbone. Bready caramel sweetness supports a bold fruity hop layer. More of the same hop characters from the nose. Finish has a light bitterness that sits on top of the malty body well. The fruity hop character is what makes this beer. Enjoyed a six pack while hanging out with some friends I haven't seen in a while. Goes down smooth, easy drinking."
"O: Drinks very easy and is what I am looking for in an APA - a little bit of hops, with a crisp mouthfeel, and not too filling. Done done and done."
"The taste falls a little bit short for me. The sweetness appears again with a juicy/chewy mouthfeel, but there isn't much more to it than that. The hops help dry out the finish, and certainly this is easy-drinking, but there isn't anything that stands out."
"This was part of the sampler I had over the weekend when I visited the brewery for the first time. I have had this beer in the past but didn't recall much about it. Having it again was really nice though. The beer poured out as a golden orange color. The head was white and fizzy and leaves just a bit of lacing on the glass. The smell has a nice sweet hoppy aroma to it. The taste is a very good, nicely balanced with hops and malts. The mouthfeel of the beer is a also very nice, it's smooth and bubbly, very drinkable brew. Overall I found the Pale Ale to be quite nice on most levels. I almost wanted to bring home a growler of it but chose the Flying Mouflan instead."
"Overall its a classic take on the style and a welcome sight in the fridge."
"Had this at the excellent Capital Ale House in downtown Fredericksburg, VA. Pours a bubbly light orange with a 1/2 inch foamy head, that dissipates to a thin head that stays throughout. Smell is a floral cascade of hops, with hints of malt and wheat. Taste is initially bitter, but has a smooth, dry finish.Good session beer. Really enjoyed this."
"It's like they took a standard APA, added the sweetness of some ambers and the toastiness of a pils. Interesting mix. It does say it's a ""copper APA"". Very tasty stuff, actually. Exceptionally easy to drink."
"Bottled on May 19, 2011. Dark yellow in color with a touch of red and perfect clarity. Poured with a frosty white head that quickly reduced to a wispy cap that leaves nice sticky lacings on the glass. Floral hop aroma with a touch of citrus orange and lemon hop aromas balanced nicely with bready malt. Medium bodied with assertive, biting carbonation. Nice balance of bready and toasted malts with herbal citrus and pine hop flavor from the beginning thru the middle. Malt flavor stays consistent through the finish as hop character transitions from herbal to lightly piney. Finishes crisp and dry with a light bitter aftertaste. Very easy to drink."
"This beer pours a clear, bubbly, pale orange, huge two-finger head that lasts only briefly. Smells of wheat or grain, a bit of hops and a bit of malt. Taste is a bit more hoppy than malty but not by much. Has some sweetness to it but refreshingly so. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry, really nice and the best part of the beer in my opinion. Overall, a very nice summer quaff from Troegs."
"Pours a clear orangish copperish color with a skim head with a thicker ring around the outside. The are gobs of lace left up and down the glass. Carbonation is visible. The aroma is faint a sweet malt backbone with a floral and citrus hop bite in the middle and end. Good aroma but faint. The taste has a bigger sweet malt backbone more pronounced then I thought it would be. At the backend is a floral and citrus hop bite. The bite brings balance and isn't in your face or tongue. The mouthfeel is light and moderatley carbonated. Overall it is a decent beer nothing spectacular not spectacular but solid."
"O = not bad, but not spectacular. worth a try as are most Troegs from what I've had."
"Decent, simple brew. Poured light golden brown with about an inch of well-lacing, white head. Sweet malts in the aroma well-balanced with some piney hops. Toasty malts in the taste, along with some mild hop bitterness. Pretty well-balanced. Nothing out of the ordinary really. Light-medium mouthfeel, and overall very drinkable if you're just looking for something simple."
"I'd take this over 95% of what's being brewed out there, but I doubt I'll ever seek it out again."
"A decent brew, but I was expecting more after the aroma."
"O: A solid beer from a pretty decent brewery. It is a good warm weather, easy drinking beer that actually has flavor (unlike the major adjunct lagers). I would enjoy one of these anytime I had the chance."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and has a very good balance between the flavors of malts and hops in the taste."
"The great nose just hints at the flavor that bursts from this delightful beer. Initial fresh hop flowers followed by moderate to strong, but not overwhelming, bitter notes then a well balanced follow through. A lively, well stored cask beer that makes for a very refreshing pint. Overall an excellent, world class ale."
"Cheers!"
"O: This might be my new favorite pale ale. It's got great flavor without pushing itself past being a 'pale ale' if you know what I mean. Super drinkable, and super tasty."
"Overall, very well done, I like th hop flavor and malt balance."
"O - Very impressive Pale ale. Very drinkable, would definitely get this again."
"O: I would love to put this up against DuClaw's ""Venom"" in a contest for best PA in the local area."
"Good smell and the taste is crisp with some pineapple. This was a good beer!!"
"A fine looking pale. Hay-colored, a minimal head with a purchase of lace, very clear. I can see the buildings a block over magnified spectacularly through the glass. Aroma at this point is mostly pale malt, a little sweet, some faded pine and earthy hop. Flavor is mostly the same with a decently firm, yet comforting, bitterness. It's okay, probably better fresh. Maybe some other time, we shall meet again, and this review will be altered..in the future."
"O: A good pale ale, though a bit different from what I'm used to. Good hop flavor, though, without being super bitter."
"Super drinkable. Perhaps a newly discovered session beer?"
"Feel is nice, good beer that you could stay with all day any day. Well balanced excellent BBQ beer for the upcoming summer."
"O-A splendid choice worth having on-hand year round. Yum."
"Overall - This is a very nice top of the line American Pale Ale right up there with DFH and Sierra Nevada etc. Definitely a good choice if found on a restaurant/bar menu, offered by a friend and worthy of return purchases and visits."
"Beer pours a nice amber color with frothy head. Pleasant smell with citrus and floral hops. Very nice. Good carbonation that holds up throughout. Taste has a slight hoppy bitterness but it's not overwhelming. Some malt is there and it's unexpected but nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is crisp and light bodied. Overall a very drinkable beer, Troegs was going for an American Pale Ale and I would say they hit the mark."
"D - Very drinkable. Super smooth and crisp and very well balanced. Really nice and balanced hop profile."
"Pours dark golden orange with some cloudiness and lots of fizz. Head holds up well and laces nicely. Crisp carbonation. Hoppiness is as expected from an APA, though subdued somewhat by tart citrusy flavors. Fairly crisp finish. Not terribly complex, but not bad for guzzling."
"Overall a great beer and refreshing brew"
"12oz bottle. Bottled on 02/16/11. Pours a clear light amber color with a tiny head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is a big whiff of citrus hops. Slightly floral. Taste is hoppy with some caramel malts to it. Nice crisp bitterness. Citrusy orange aftertaste. This is an easy drinking Pale Ale that is perfect for the summer. Good amount of hops for this style of beer. Worth grabbing again."
"D/O- Very refreshing pale ale. I received and drank this at the wrong time of the year....downing a few of these outdoors during summer would have made my night...sadly that won't happen now."
"Overall: Very well put together beer. Very good example of an American Pale ale. I would have expected this to come from the west coast. Recommended"
"D Can sit on your backporch and drink plenty of these in the summer time with friends and family."
"Notes: Overall a bit light on hops for an APA but still tasty."
"Drink ability is great. Tasty, feels good, this is a special session beer."
" Pilsnery mouthfeel; a bit tannic and dry, which makes the bitterness ring on the tongue a bit."
"D: I don't know if I'd ever crave this or really pine for it. I could go for another though and it's light enough that I could drink a couple in one setting."
"D- An easy drinking good tasting pale ale. Low enough ABV to session with I think. In my opinion of all the breweries in PA Tröegs gets the most use and flavor out of their hops better than anyone."
"This is just a pleasant beer to drink. Drinkability is way high. I could sit back and consume quite a few of these. Troegs is a go to beer of mine. I haven't been disappointed with a single beer of theirs."
"I really like the diacetly yeast flavors. This seems too low hopped for an American pale ale to me. I would reach for their wheat over this one."
"I'm beginning to think that Troegs really has it down pretty well. This one is no exception. Great low ABV beer that can easily be seen as a great summer drink."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer, particularly the citrus flavors and aromas that truly mask the alcohol. Highly drinkable and one of my favorite pale ales!"
"Decent, especially for someone just starting into craft beer. Just an OK beer for me...plus you can't buy this in Indiana so I highly doubt I'd ever try this again. If someone offered me one, I guess I'd accept."
"D: Taste holds this one's drinkability bit a back; no desire to have another glass."
"Not bad a pale ale, but at the price for a 6pack i could find something a little more affordable and tastier."
"This came off of the handpump with a finger of thin ecru head that held in amazingly well in the face of the day's humidity. Color was a slightly hazy deep golden-yellow. They CAN't all fall bright, I suppose. Nose was hop-forward with a soft grassiness that again started me to sweating. The CANQuest (TM) has had me drinking a lot of AmeriCAN Adjunct Lagers and I simply miss hops as a result. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a mildly understated grassy hop taste on the tongue. My hop jones monkey began to cease his incessant chattering. I began to feel some maintenance drinking upcoming that weekend. Finish was slightly bitter, very appropriate for the style, but leaving me still jonesing for more. Cue the Andrea True Connection (""More, more, more ...)."
"As stated in the mouthful, this brew is very easy to drink. Its got a nice dry finish and goes down very easily. Its exactly what to expect with an APA. Great representation of the style. I would reach for this brew again if given the chance."
"The palate opens with a light bitterness, grapefruit-like with some citrus and floral character too. Again, the malt character is present almost as a mild bread and a little caramel. Sweetness is low, and the hops are very well expressed. The bitterness slowly grows, lingering on into the finish with a blend of grapefruit and candied oranges. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this is a treat on the palate. Very drinkable, this is an excellent pale ale. I'm not the biggest fan of Cascade hops, but this beer manages to utilize them very well."
"I'd order more than one of these. Maybe several."
"Overall drinkability is moderate at best since I really am into more hop forward pales this one came pretty close to my impression of hopback without so much hops. Sweet, drinkable, easy drinking. Would consider it for friends."
"D- This is what a pale ale should be. Easy to drink, light, refreshing, well balanced. Tasty, not weak."
"D: Very drinkable beer with great flavors, feel, and medium abv."
"D - Fairly high. Clean, crisp, taste is very refreshing. I am not the biggest fan of pale ale's but this one is very nice."
"D - Very drinkable, excellent example of a Pale Ale."
"D- real easy to drink. Very mild with the hops, but still has a nice flavor to it"
"D: The standard American Pale Ale. A decent, easy-drinking brew, but considering how many better beers there are on the market, I couldn't justify purchasing this one again."
"Nothing too compelling about this one. I definitely could quaff a few of these, but I can't say its in my top APA's."
"A very nice cool, clean and refreshing beer with a nice crispy hoppiness that is sessionable. Could you ask more for a pale ale that's available year round?"
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, a little dry and chewy. Superb drinking, and a nicely balanced, yet hoppy variety of the pale ale."
"Pours a dark yellow with a shade of amber. A little hazy and a very lively look to it. Head is about an inch and it recedes slowly, leaving decent lacing. Smells of flowers and pine; both very fragrent and mix nicely. Hops immediately present on taste, almost as if it were an IPA. There is a bit of sweetness in the back as well. I feel like this beer is actually a fusion between an traditional pale ale and an IPA. Overall, this is pretty good, maybe not my first choice in the style, however."
"d: Odd taste for a pale ale but not bad. A bit maltier than I would like, needs more hop bite"
"D - I freakin love hops, I could easily drink this as a session beer. Even for those who aren't crazy over the hops, it isn't over the top so it might be good for them as well."
"Drink - A very drinkable beer but nothing special. It actually reminded me more of a pilsner than a pale ale but it's still worth a try."
"Pours a clear golden copper with a small white head. Aroma of floral piney hops, citrus, some malt. Taste of piney citrusy hops, malt. Palate is medium body, nice carbonation, smooth and crisp mouth feel. Finish is earthy piney hops, some malt and caramel, ending is a little nutty with some light bitterness. Overall a very nice easy drinking brew."
"D/M: real smooth drinking brew. Slight carbonation tingle. Not much of a lingering taste but the fact that it is sweet with slight hop notes makes it easy to drink and quite desirable."
"Pours a light golden color, with a 1/2 inch of white head - not much retention but nice lacing. Nice hop aroma, consisting of grapefruit and pine for the most part. I get mostly hops upfront in the taste, a crisp bitter sweetness with a slight malt finish. Light bodied, with good carbonation. Very drinkable, I love this stuff during the warmer months, very clean and refreshing. This is right up there with SN Pale Ale."
"Light and smooth. Very drinkable, and with a low ABV that makes drinking a bunch of it easier. But it's just a lot less interesting than Troegs' other offerings."
"Good head, good clarity, nice copper color and plenty of lacing. Smells good and hoppy. Grapefruit aroma from the hops are fairly prominent. Palate is pretty much classic APA. Pine and citric hop juice with plenty of backbone from the caramel malts. Very flavorful and balanced and doesn't ride the APA/IPA fence. Bitterness is mild and mouthfeel is wet without being too watery. Very drinkable and enjoyable ale."
"D- Troegs has a drinkable pale ale. There just isn't the flavor that you would expect from this crew. Maybe nugget nectar took all the hops"
"It is certainly very drinkable though. This would not be my first choice of APA."
"This is a pretty good pale ale, well balanced, refreshing, and very easy to drink."
"Drink well my friends"
"Pours a nice golden orange color with a several finger white head and a good amount of lacing as it goes down the glass. The nose brings a nice amount of citrus hops along with a tiny bit of pine. Some mildly sweet malt comes through as well. Taste brings good citrus and pine along with some bitterness as well as some mild bready sweetness in the background. Light feel with good carbonation; overall, nice and subtle, though not as good as the HopBack."
"Drinkability is fairly good."
"Mouthfeel is light and lightly oily with a nice crisp carbonation. For the style and flavor of this beer it has a perfect mouthfeel."
"Overall: Solid beer with big flavor."
"A nicely executed pale ale. A bit less hop-forward than something like SNPA, and than what I was expecting, but works nicely. Tasty stuff."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. I feel it should be called Very Pale Ale, it was bright yellow close to a yellowish pilsner type color. Good clarity on it. There is about a half inch white head that slowly fades and provides some better than average lacing to it. The smell is good, when you crack it open you can tell it's pretty hoppy, by far the dominant feature in the aroma. Citrus, floral notes, and a little bit of pine. All in all smells like a good pale ale. The taste is good, not an aggressive pale ale, but good. In my opinion it's more of a pine hop in the flavor than anything else. There's a sweetness from the malts that make it pretty well balanced, but mild overall, still good. Mouthfeel is good, it has a clean, crisp, bitter finish. Good carbonation level. Very drinkable goes pretty quickly. I like this Pale Ale, very reliable. I can't say I'd go out of my way to get it or drink it again, but I'd certainly get it if available. I don't know why, but I really want to try it on tap."
"Nothing special for the style but an alright beer. It pours a medium gold with a smallish white head. Not too much lacing. The aroma is caramel, light fruity hop notes and some butterscotch. It's just kinda simple and light on the hops. Mouthfeel is a bit watery but not bad. Mild piney hop bite in the finish. It's just a bit boring, lacking any real strengths."
"Pours a clear golden color with a slight tint of orange. Very little head that quickly dissipates. A very appealing hoppy and sweet grapefruit-citrus scent. The taste upfront is hoppy and bitter, followed by grapefruit and orange. The bitterness carries over into the aftertaste but quickly leaves a sweet citrus on the tongue. Light-medium bodied with subtle carbonation. A very drinkable and refreshing APA."
"4/4/4/4.5/5"
"Drink: Big disconnect between the smell and taste is kinda disappointing, lost points on both accounts but not because either was particularly bad by itself. Not bad though, pretty decent."
"I drank this brew from the bottle. Pale copper color, light tan head. Mellow hoppy flavor, faint pine and citrus flavor. Nice malt flavor makes this pretty balanced. Mouthfeel is kinda watery all and all this is a very good American representation of the APA style. Nothing crazy, but nicely balanced."
"M/D - Light body that could stand to use just a slight bump in carbonation IMO. Finishes quite balanced between sweet and dry. Light flavors make it easy to drink and not to overpowering. Great drinking beer and very traditional."
"D: A pretty good, none-too-aggressive APA. Smooth and clean, balanced and slightly hop-centric. The 5.4% ABV is manageable over a session, but the flavors don't necessarily wow me. I would pick it up for a backyard BBQ where some uninitiated peers might want to try a craft ale without stepping too far outside their comfort zone."
"Pours a clear, dark, golden color with a very large white head that takes a bit to dissipate. Very nice lacing. Smells of hops and pine; fresh and inviting. Tastes like it smells with hops up front and clean finish. Hardly any aftertaste at all and no bitterness. Medium to light-bodied, it has a pleasant mouthfeel. Overall this is a very clean and crisp beer that gives you just a hint of hops without bitterness and makes a great session brew."
"Crisp, bitey and light but not empty in the body. On the contrary, a solid medium body despite the paler appearance. Medium/high carbonation provides for the crisp backdrop to some real hop character and balancing malts. Well done and decidedly drinkable."
"Overall a great beer and refreshing brew"
"Taste is biscuity, doughy even with a sharp, crisp bite of hops. Has both bittering and flavoring lupulin in equal amounts while the light malts play nicely to create a very refreshing beer. The more beers I have from Troegs, the more I am impressed with their brewing prowess. This is a mighty fine pale and dare I say this might be a regular in my fridge if it were available here? Good stuff."
"East coast version of SNPA. Good beer."
"Drinkable: I'd be thrilled if someone was serving this at a party, but a little underwhelming at a beer bar with an extensive selection."
"D - An excellent example of the style and one that I will definitely buy again."
"D- Easily drinkable, the pale ale is a great summertime beer and this one doesn't disappoint. I enjoyed this one."
"This is medium bodied with an average amount of carbonation, and it goes down easily. Only consumed one pint this time, but it would be very easy to drink several of these in a sitting."
"In terms of drinkability, this is one to be sipped all evening. It's nice and mild, spicy, and bitter. A decent example of a plain pale ale."
"D - Definitely very drinkable. Light and refreshing. Very smooth all the way."
"D: The drinkability suffers, for me, because of lack of personal interest. Overall a decent brew, but nowhere ner the upper-echelon of APAs."
"Pours a clean and clear golden straw color, cap of whispy whit ehead, diminishing quickly with little lacing. Smell is grassy, dusty with a hint of fresh dried grain and light carmel. taste is mellow... grassy and earthy, a touch of fresh bread and light carmel, hint of citrus and pine. Light bodied, slightly watery, decent carbonation. An ok Pale that is very light and not as hoppy as other American creaft pales."
"Notes: I am really, really impressed with this, my favorite APA. I just love it when I do not expect much and I am rewarded for all of my searching with such a great tasting beer. Of course, highly recommended!"
"D: Not bad, refreshing and easy to drink. Not the greatest example of a pale ale, but something that would be enjoyable to drink on the patio on a warm summer afternoon."
"Drinkability: This is neither my first nor my last of this beer. Each sip invites another so it is easy to have a second one. This also is on my shopping list for beers to drink periodically."
"Tröegs Pale Ale is an extremely clear, pale golden ale with a dense white head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a slightly sweet, fruity and spicy aroma with notes of fresh cut wood, flowers and citrus. It's medium-light bodied and very smooth with a dry finish. It has a well balanced flavor. It tastes resiny overall, without the sweetness of the aroma. The ample bitterness carries into the aftertaste. The malt flavor is pretty discreet and perhaps a touch melanoidal. Compared to a Sierra Nevada Pale, this seems more English in style but it's still solidly American. It would make a solid session ale."
"Poured a golden body with a good one-finger head that dies but left lace behind. Aroma is plain but good as it is a mix of sweet malt and citric hops. Medium body, chewy, a solid malt base with some sweetness like caramel and sugar that is balanced and tapered by a slightly dry hoppiness with citric and leafy characteristics. Has a sharp backbite but does not finish dry but more crisp with mild sweetness and just a great ale to drink."
"D: I could easily take out a sixer of this in one night. Very drinkable and refreshing. Perfect for a warm summer night like tonight."
"Overall, this was just ok. I didn't think this was strong enough, and the crisp clean thing was fine, but just some odd flavors and weakness that didn't really stand up on its own or with food. Really didn't care for this one. Nothing to hate by any means, but it is a far cry form some other Troegs products."
"D - one of my favorite APA's, great floral presence. light and very drinkable. great beer from Troegs."
"Poured from a slightly chilled bottled into a tumbler glass. The beer is a golden orange color with a modest white foam head. There is a good amount of minuscule bubbles rising up form the bottom of the glass. There a nice hop character to the nose; it smells fresh and pine like. The flavor is kind of average. There is some malt and some hops to balance it. There is a little bit of bitterness in the finish. There is a little bit of butter to the flavor. The butteriness is really apparent in the mouthfeel. This is a slick, slippery beer. I don't really like the film it leaves behind. In fact, I'd say the buttery qualities negatively affect the overall drinkability. In the future, I would choose a different pale ale over this one."
"D - A very nice APA, it certainly ranks among some of the better I've tried. It's quite hoppy but not overly so, which would push it into the IPA territory, but the malt and alcohol just isn't strong enough to classify it as such. So, hits the mark and is quite satisfying to style."
"Pours a nice medium dark copper amber with a bit of white foam. Modestly sticky. Smell is hoppy, with some citrus notes. The taste is a balanced hop - ranges to bitter but never quite breaks a barrier - and is held is check by the malt. Overall a very nice blend. Good drinkability, well made APA."
"D- Very nice representations of the style, one of my favorites to date."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, maybe a touch of citrus. Taste is also overwhelmingly of hops, not well balanced. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall a decent brew but a tad to hoppy for my liking."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, Drinkability is pretty good, it was a very enjoyable well made beer. It didn't have in your face hops or any extreme flavors but it had a nice balance to it and was an easy drinker. Very good all around beer."
"Poured from a fresh bottle (case good until July 2010) into a clean pint glass. Semi-clear golden color and a hoppy grassy smell. Never described a brew as ""green"" smelling before but that's how I perceived it. Taste was average Pale Ale, kind of spritzy and hpppy, not much malt. Mouthfeel was good, medium and drinkability was good. This would be a good intro to better beer for the mass produced drinking crowd."
"Pours a golden yellow color 1 finger of head that fades to a ring. Lots of citrusy hops in the aroma, with big grapefruit notes and a hint of grassyness in the back. The taste is dominated by a green hop bitterness that really swamps out the malt, until the end where there is a kinda unusual astringent graininess. The finish is lingering and the body is to the thin side of medium. An Ok P.A. with some balance issues."
"D - Pretty drinkable. Low abv and I can see how this could be refreshing in the summer. But it's not much above some cheaper stuff. Probably wouldn't get this again."
"pours a slightly hazy golden yellowish color. good white head that recedes quickly, good lacing and spare carbonation. citrus hoppy smell, and light sweet malts. hop smell goes along with the taste. light floral hints, and a light thin body with a faint bitter finish. nothing special here but all around a pretty good beer."
"Drinkability: This is a great, easy drinking, sessionable beer. A relatively low ABV, nice flavor, and an all-round simplicity that just makes it a great drinking beer. There are times when you are interested in a simple, non-complicated beer that you just want to enjoy with thinking...and this is that beer. Well done."
"Wait a few minutes. This is best enjoyed not too cold, as a really well-balanced beer takes shape. Recommended for sessioning."
"D - Crisp and tasty, I would definitely rate this as highly drinkable. I enjoyed one and would definitely buy it again."
"D - goes down nicely"
"D: I think that I am single-handedly responsible for finishing off the growler. A sessionable pale ale."
"D - A solid pale ale, I could drink a bunch of these on a nice warm day."
"D: Very smooth and drinkable and refreshing, a true pale ale not over hopped just clean and crisp."
"I'd like to try this again when I can find a fresher sample."
"D - A pretty solid American Pale- it is easy to knock back a few. It has a clean quaffable quality and the ibus aren't high enough to confuse you as to wether it is a hoppy pale or an Ipa"
"The mouthfeel was full for a PA and very refreshing refreshing."
"The beer poured a nice old gold with a good white head. The aroma was a magnificent burst of floral hops with malt in the background. The taste was what I expect and want from an APA; a nice bit of malt with a good floral hops wallop on top. The feel was medium and dry. A very pleasant beer to sip on or go with a meal, just a nice all around beer."
"D - Being light, it's easy to drink and I could drink a few due to that reason alone, but I wouldn't because I just didn't enjoy it much"
"First taste was brilliant, this is not a very hoppy tasting beer, though the taste is there. Slight fruity scent, possibly banana? Feels nice in the mouth, smooth. This is a very drinkable beer at 5.4%, goes down smooth."
"Dr. Very easy going here."
"Overall a drinkable and enjoyable beer well suited for sessioning...but after being blown away by Tröegs Dead Reckoning Porter I found myself wishing it had a little more oomph in the flavor department and a lot less carbonation in the body."
"Pours a clear golden color with a large white head. The aroma is citrus, pine and pineapple. The flavor is caramel malt with some nice orange and other citrus flavors. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Drinkability: This is an overall good beer and meant to be enjoyed often and during warm weather. I might have liked a little more hops then this one offers but all in all a very great beer that I could enjoy all night."
"D: Great session beer. Went down great and I wish I could have had another. Hopefully we get more firkins up this way from them."
"Cheers!"
"Overall this beer is not super-exciting, but very drinkable. Definitely on the better side of all American pale ales out there, even if it's a far cry from something like Three Floyds Alpha King. HARRISBURG!!!"
"D - Well balanced and pleasing to drink. Not as bold as many APAs, but solid and nicely subdued. Very drinkable."
"Light, crisp medium body which is very well balanced and more complex than the average pale ale. Nice earthy dry hops up front which are quickly countered by a very refreshing sweet biscuity pilsner malt-like backbone. There's also a fairly prominent earthy grass/straw presence and some sweet light crisp fruit notes, especially green apple. Very quaffable, excellent example of the style."
"This is a pretty solid beverage. It's quite mellow. If anything, too mellow. Kind of forgettable, but perfect as a go-to when you just want a bev."
"Medium to low bodied beer. Everything is mild but well balanced. There is a slight sweetness followed by a nice level of hop bitterness. The mid-palate was met with nice citrus hop flavors. Drinkability is high and mouthfeel is good. I would recommend this beer as a pale ale."
"Drinkable? Well, it's downright gulpable. There is still plenty of room in this category for a good beer that keeps you cool during a summer BBQ. Troegs Pale Ale fills that need quite nicely."
"D- Easy to drink, and enjoyable. Wouldn't mind picking this up every now and then if it were available in these parts."
"Poured orange-amber into an American pint glass, with decent carbonation, over a finger of white head, and very good lacing. The aroma was citrusy (pink grapefruit, orange peel), piney, and malty, but the taste revealed a near-perfect blend of these individual flavors. In fact, the balance between pine/citrus hop flavor and malt flavor might be this beer's strongest suit. Furthermore it finishes on a nice dry orange peel note. Perfectly carbonated and medium-bodied, this is an excellent session pale ale."
"Pours an orangish copper with a beige gead. Good lacing and retention. Nose has grassy hops and pale bready malts. Taste has grainy malts and some stale hops. Light body is well carbonated, but a bit light through the finish. Not bad, good session ale."
"Drinkability: This is a great session beer, but lacking because the malts are a little weak and there isn't as much depth in the hops as I would expect. Still, very drinkable and pleasant."
"D - Very drinkable and I even liked it more out of the cask because it was warmer."
"Drinkability: A decent pale ale. There are better out there but this one is worth a try."
"Definitely would drink again if i had the chance too."
"d- very drinkable, i'd have this again for sure, easily sessionable definately, good troegs beer."
"It's always a pleasant surprise to find a subtle American pale ale that doesn't clobber your palate with hops. Good example of the style."
"Overall, it is not as hoppy as I like from my APAs, but its still worth a try as hop levels are probably a personal preference."
"Troegs is by far my favorite brewery and I love all of their beer. This is a good, solid, ""normal"" all year beer. Nothing too ground breaking and always there if something else isnt available. Definitely gives sierra nevada a run for its money in my book when it comes to APA's."
"Mouthfeel is fairly thick (""chewy"" comes to mind) but not sticky. Pretty drinkable. Good, but not great."
"Pours a solid gold with a decent white head that casts bold aromas of fresh citrusy and floral hops and a honey sweetness. Flavors are well balanced; a nice blend of caramelly malts backed by vibrant hops. There's is nothing overpowering about this beer. It works just as well on its own as it does with food."
"Pours a very clear light orange/yellow color with a finger of white head that leaves a nice amount of lacing, a ring actually upon the glass with every taste. Nose has a pleasant citrus hop aroma that is very welcoming to the first sip. Also detecting a bit of grain in the nose as well. Taste is mildly bitter upfront and in the crisp finish from the hops. Little bit of malt taste, faint sweetness across the body. Feel is about medium to light. Very easy to drink, I think ill have another."
"Shiny and orange, clean look on the tap. Sticky head does a good job, and leaves some lacing as well. Lots of hops in the aroma, leaving it pleasantly bold while waiting for my sip. Citrics all over this one, although the sweet pale malts take over a bit much for my preference toward the end. Light body and low alcohol make this a fairly sessionable hop delivery vehicle."
"I can't say anything bad about this beer. Was a nice clean hoppy taste with a bit of a sweet grape finish, smell is hoppy. Color is a clean gold with white head. The beer is light mouthfeel compared to most apas which is a good thing in some ways. The drinkablity is aided by the lightness."
"This turned out to be a middle of the pack APA. Attractive looking with a clear golden color and a two inch head that had good retention. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. The Cascade hops give a nice citrus aroma that compliments the sweet malt. Has a citrus flavor and a slightly sweet malt flavor but it lacks depth and substance. Finishes with a slight citrus flavor that does not linger too long. The body is a little thin but the carbonation is nice. Easy to drink but overall it lacks the qualities that make a good beer."
"Received in a sampler 12 pack of craft beers from FreshDirect (hey, it's one of the few ways those of us located in NYC can find craft beer!). Appearance was a light amber color. I thought this was a very nice balance between the hops and the malt, just like an APA should be. Great drinkability - this went down nice and easy."
"This one's a simple brew with a good flavor, strong enough to be enjoyed by seasoned drinkers and gentle enough for the amateur. A good in-between beer."
"Drinkability: Truthfully this beer is really drinkable, for all that it lacks, it also lacks anything unpleasant. It is easy to drink, and may be a good beer for someone in transition between NASCAR beer and ""good"" beer. In summary I would say this is what the folks in the Box seats should be drinking at the races."
"D- Well this beer was kind of a let down from them. I was excited to get it and it just didn't do anything for me. It could have been a little more bitter and it would have scored a lot better than what I gave it. Neither good or bad...more like a fence sitter."
"D - Very drinkable given the ABV and smoothness. A great session beer for sure and would love to have this stocked in the fridge."
"D - This is a great go-to beer for me during the summer...it's not a hop bomb but they are there...I love how crisp this one is"
"A solid beer from a solid brewery."
"Overall a very standard pale ale that I could see myself purchasing again, especially at such a great price!"
"D: Great pale ale, good summer beer. Very refreshing and well balanced. I would compare this to a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but rate it slightly ahead."
"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Color was an darker orange amber with a very thin bubbly head. Small amounts of carbonation kept rising from the bottom. Aroma was hoppy, and slightly sweet. Taste was a bit bitter, with undertones of burnt grains. Felt very good in the mouth. Coated well, lasted just long enough to be pleasant. Went down very fast, not terribly satisfying unfortunately."
"Very fresh and crisp drinker!"
"This is a solid representation of an APA, not the most magnificent I've had but certainly not one to scoff at. I will likely be trying this again in the future."
"Not bad, but given the option, one would surely be better off trying a pale from another brewery, or another offering from Troegs."
"Drinkability is very good for a pale ale with a lot of taste. Because this beer is so well balanced, I could drink a good amount of these. However, the beer still provides plenty of taste to keep you wanting to drink more."
"D - Drinkable. Could have a few of these"
"A solid pale ale, classic northwest hops with a fairly balanced malt profile. Clean and very drinkable."
"I liked this. Its a remarkable simple beer, but sometimes that's what you're looking for. It was also free from the bar, so that helps too."
"Troegs can't make a bad beer. Perfect session IPA/PA that easily is up there with Sierra Nevada or other standards."
"Overall this one is a bit watery and leaves a bit to be desired in the after taste. Moderately dry in the after taste it also has a bitter twang with a slight metallic edge. This isn't off-putting but isn't exactly what I'm looking for either. In the end it does go down easy and I could follow it up with more if I had another bottle to do so. As is this is a good APA that is definitely worth a try."
"I would definitely have to say that this is a well balanced, more mild Pale Ale compared to some others that I've had."
"Adequate finger plus head of mixed bubble sizes, fades quickly with haphazard streaks of lacing left behind. Clear golden orange color, a mild haze does not impair transparency, not many visible bubbles within. Mostly sweet nose, grainy hops and cereal, vague swipe of orange/lemon citrus, softly floral but no pine notes, while not that much malt or cocoa evident, does end on a creamy note. Medium-bodied, the foaminess lends a fluffy cushion to the mouth feel, raises the sour dough, raw bread up off the palate and into the swirl above where the sourness is less present. Not much fruit, peach pit, apple or pear skin. Raw grains, oats, wheat, not herbaceous though. Dryness here eliminates much of any maltiness. Keeps good balance as it nears the finish, not a lot going on but it does stay on point and nothing stands out awkwardly."
"5.0 D: Awesome brew. Probably the best pale ale I've ever had. I could drink this all damn night."
"Cheers!!!"
"I had this as part of a mixed 12 pack. The bottle poured out a very light golden colored ale. There as actually a very nice floral hop aroma. The taste was lightly hopped and consistent throughout the first taste, mid taste, and finish. The mouthfeel was light and fairly watery."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and firm. I really dig the flavor on the Ale. Perfect blend of citrus hops that finish just slightly bitter, and ever-sweet malts that gives this a nice honey graham-like quality. This is very well done. I would love to be able to get this locally, as I would make this a regular in the fridge."
"D - A slight let down based on a very promising appearance and aroma... A big let down based on the fact the Troegs is among my favorite breweries and this brew falls terribly short..."
"Tröegs consistantly makes quality beers and this is no exception."
"D- Overall, an easy drinking beer that didn't wow but didn't disappoint."
"Out of Hopback Amber at the store, decided to go with the Pale. Pours clear and golden into an English pint, very impressive head and excellent retention. Light grain and barley aroma. Slight herbal hop flavor but mostly a grainy sort of finish, maybe a little toffee or biscuit. Nice smooth and sturdy mouthfeel. Really refreshing. Wish this was maybe a bit more crisp and a little more hop zip to it but overall a nice English style pale ale."
"D) A well brewed APA and smooth enough to want another."
"I'm a huge Troeg's fanboy but this is not one of my favorites. I may be unfairly comparing this in my mind to their Hopback or their Nectar which I think are outstanding. This is a decent little pale but there are better representatives of the style."
"D: A good session beer that would be appealing to a wide range of craft beer fans and new BMC converts"
"Overall, Tröegs Pale Ale is better than average, but not remarkable. I won't regret it, but I don't expect to remember it in the morning."
"Overall, a decent pale. I would be glad to see it at a bar or a party that lacked other craft options, but probably will not seek it out or choose it over too many other craft brews."
"Pours a golden with a thin white head. Not much retention, but very nice lacing. Aroma is of piny hops and grapefruit. Body is crisp and refreshing with a good amount of carbonation. Some yeasty malts up front with a nicely hopped finish. Very,very nice."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer, but it didn't strike me as anything out of the ordinary. It just seemed like a plain pale ale."
"D: Very high - very good brew and would be happy to have more than one."
"Drinkability is good. This is one of the best pale ales I've ever had and it has a great balance."
"Pours a hazy golden with a foamy white head. Aroma is well balanced bready malt and hops (more earthy/floral than citrus/pine). The taste it well rounded, but the hops seem to be more of a bittering variety than flavor/aroma. The finish ends with malty sweetness. The mouthfeel is decent for an APA, and the drinkability is good @ 5.40%. This is definitely a sessionable beer, but I would buy a bunch of other beers instead of this one."
"A growler purchased fresh from the brewery taproom. Poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Appears a hazed bright apricot color with about two fingers of dense off white head. The foam leaves a thin lace on the inside of my glass. Smells and tastes of sweet malt, citrus such as grapefruit and lemon, caramelized grains. Medium in both body and carbonation. Crisp,drinkable, and very fresh tasting."
"Not really a memorable Pale Ale; however, there is nothing quite unpleasant about this offering either."
"Not a very complex beer, but very drinkable."
"Fresh hop flavor in the taste--somewhat prickly in a pine needle sort of way. Good malt base; closer to a amber ale on the malt side. The body is thinner than I would expect, but that may be the only distraction. This is one of the better APA's I've had."
"Poured from a bottle with a nice head but it leaves pretty quickly. Color is of a normal pale ale, a light golden beer with nice small carbonated bubbles rising quickly. The nose is of hops and citrus. The taste is of the hops but it is very mild and good. This is a beer that I could drink pretty much all day. Very light and tasty but not heavy at all."
"An awesome beverage this and the Hopback amber go hand and hand great combination."
"D: This is a good beer, I wouldn't call it the best, wouldn't call it the worst"
"D- decent. I can't help but think that a little more bitterness would lend balance, and increase the drinkability, though."
"Very drinkable and sessionable."
"D: Leans towards IPA, but a very mild one. malts and hops have good flavor and presence, but arent overwhelming. A good spring/summer pale ale. pales in comparison to the other troegs ive tried. but mainly because the others were that good."
"I can imagine Troegs sells a lot of this stuff. Most pale ales on the market really are nowhere near this pleasing; it's surprisingly uncommon to come across such a fine example of this dreadfully common style. Although a simple beer like this really doesn't show off all the brewer's talents it certainly shows their skill. Thanks DrJay!"
"D - The best word to describe this beer is refreshing...I could drink these all night...I'm looking forward to enjoying this beer as the weather gets warmer"
"D - Something to sit down and enjoy quite a few of."
"D: I can't hide my love of Troegs beers. A pale ale that would be an IPA for other brewers, but not so hoppy that it's overwhelming, just delicious, straight up."
"Overall: This is an excellent example of the style, and way above average. So happy to see Tröegs in my area now!"
"Brew poured to a nice golden amber color with a fairly good sized off white head that had great staying power. Real nice lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma at first is all hops, very inviting cascade smell that reminds me of fresh hop leaves, almost the aroma from the remnants in the primary of a homebrewed pale or ipa . While that is the dominant aroma, I am picking up a slight background malt aroma that comes across a little sweet. The flavor is nice, again hops come to mind at first but I am also picking up a tea like flavor(??), maybe I am crazy but that flavor goes extremely well with this brew. Some malt there as well, roasted profile. The hops that I noticed at first are dominant but not overly as the flavor breaks and does not remain at the back of the tongue. Finish is relatively dry, which is nice for this brew. I like brew a lot as the aroma, taste, feel and drinkability are hight for me!"
"A good session beer."
"third solid beer from troegs 12 pak sampler and i am impressed. pours a honey gold color with a one finger white head that faded to just cover the beer at the finish and a sticky lace that held well after the beer was gone. aromas of citrus and pine come through nicely. very nice balance of malt and hops. slightly fruity malt turning to fresh grapefruit ending with a tart slightly bitter taste finish. each beer just makes you want another."
"Definitely not as distinctive as Nugget Nectar, which is the only other offering from Troeggs I have sampled thus far."
"d-wow, drinkable, quaffable, sippable...all things to all discerning palates. prepare to be wow'd. a near damn perfect, singular piece of art."
"Very hoppy aroma for a pale ale... nice. Moderate lacing, light golden color. Taste is not as hoppy as the smell, very light bodied and I get a lot of ""wetness"" rather than flavor. I understand its an APA and not an IPA but I felt it could have used a little more body and balance to it. Easy drinker though and a solid beer.. just not one of their best."
"Pours clear golden with delicate frothy head and good lacing. The smell is delicate and grainy, like a good pilsner. The flavor is strong pale malt, a little bready, with subtle hop bitterness and just a taste of floral hops. There is a trace of bitter lemon and apple. The overall effect is crisp with a slight clingy mouthfeel. Quote refreshing and an excellent session beer."
"All in all a good APA,all the right components just not enough of each to make it great."
"D - Could easily make this a session beer, the perfect blend of flavors to create a great pale ale."
"Drinkability: I will have this again and could pick up a six. I like this much better than their amber which I believe has similar qualities. Hoppy but not overly so..a complex beer."
"This beer poured a nice deep, clear golden amber. A one finger frothy white head with nice retention. Thick sticky lacing coated the glass the whole way down. Nose is of citrus and floral notes, I can make out slight sweet malts. Taste is muted sweet - initial hit of citrus gives way to the bitterness in the hops, and on the back end the malts even it out. This beer definitely has an arc to it as you drink it. Mouthfeel is great - nice and crisp, lighter bodied. Another nice offering from Troegs. This is session worthy beer for me."
"Drinkability is top notch. Keep this around for good times with friends and food. I highly recommend this one."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good mild but hoppy beer to drink for a very long time."
"The beer is light to medium bodied with a fairly smooth body, decent carbonation, a malty backbone, a slightly saltene character towards the finish. There are some florals present in the beer, it is quite sweet, in fact there is very little drying notes present. There is a slight tartness from the hops, but there really is nothing of the estery hop oils present in the beer. It's a decent APA, worth trying, but nothing really stands out here. The beer isn't overly complex."
"Pours a lightly hazy golden, some light orange hues, tangerine, very thick one finger white head forms, very tight and compact, drops slowly to a thin layer and ring, leaves behind some nice sheets of lacing. Smell is nice, very citric, some lemons and tangerines, very light grapefruit tartness, not a lot of malt, but a light bit of toast in the nose, a bit of honey like sweetness in the back, nice balance, doesn't blow your nose off with hops. Taste is similar, quite light in flavour but refreshing, some toasty malt and light caramel sweetness at first, followed by grapefruit and a lemony acidity, a bit of fruity tartness in the finish, has a strange iron/orange peel flavour in the finish, lightly bitter. Moutfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, a bit too high makes it rough on the palate. Overall a decent pale ale, I like the real citrusy hopping, but the carbonation is a touch too high for my liking."
"Pours a nice copper color with a slightly off-white head. Little lacing. Smells hoppy, almost pine forest hoppy, not citrus hoppy. Taste is very piney, it mellows into biscuity malts by the end. Supprisingly i thought that this was more bitter than the Hopback Amber but not as delicious. It is a very sessionable beer, a few of these would disappear into my belly in no time."
"this beer was better than i expected. first troegs"
"Notes: Standard APA here, nothing over the top but still pretty good."
"Drinkability- A quaffable pale ale occupying a very versatile place, good in any weather and an excellent accompanyment for many foods."
"a solid APA, but nothing to get worked up about either."
"This beer is quite tasteful. Is really drinkable and crisp. A great beer from PA."
"Overall- 1 of my favorite Pale Ale's. I slammed this 1 (a bad bottle I presume) years ago but have done a 180 since."
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with a one-finger white head. Some lacing. Smell is mainly citrusy hops with a hint of wheat. The taste begins with lots of bitter Cascade hops, then a slight malt compliment. Mouthfeel is crisp, acidic. Overall, a pretty good APA, but not as flavorful as many that are out there."
"A classic fantastic example of the style. Nothing fancy, just good, damn good."
"Poured orange with a head constantly replenished by active bubbling. Mildly hoppy aroma... not this beer's strong suit. The taste is initially bitter and fades into a nice balance with a yeasty finish. This is a fabulously rich and rewarding beer which I enjoy in almost all seasons and circumstances... perhaps my favorite ""all around"" choice."
"Would absolutely buy again, very easy to drink."
"This one poured a pale golden colour with plenty of frothy lacing. Smell of lemon zest, and citrusy hops. Taste is very subtle with a little of the hops coming through, very similar to other pale ales. Mouth feel is very light and one bottle was watered down while the other seemed fresh. All in all, I would buy this again for a good session beer."
"Poured 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. Golden straw in color with minimal head and lacing. Touch of lemon zest and hops are the feature title. Gulp. Good mouthfeel upon entry. Crisp in nature, very refreshing. A good session beer all the way. Recommended to those who can handle a medium hoped beer. Will be drinking more Troegs in the near future. This was a great introduction beer, to test the waters on."
"Pours a golden color, not very deep, with just a bit of lacing and just a bit of head. Nice hoppy scent, a bit floral, although a little unbalanced. Nice taste, crisph with nice hops, although the hop mixture seemed a bit odd to me (mixture of English and American hops?). Goes down fine. I would be happy to drink this any time, even if it's not the best."
"Mouthfeel is on the medium side, not extremly complex,but good. Solid,not really standout. Toss me a Stone Pale Ale."
"D= for hops fanatics I'm sure it's a session beer. For me, it's this one to try it. And I'm usually a huge Troegs fanatic. I'll stick to their HopBack Ale."
"D - This is a very good pale ale. I would make a great session brew."
"Taste is big on the citrusy hops, grapefruits seem to come about. Well balanced though, an enjoyable beer for sure."
"I'm not a hop head and I really enjoyed this beer and I am starting to really appreciate hops. I hope that I can start enjoy some of the real hoppy beers out there in the near future. Beer poured a golden color with a big head that left sheets on my pint glass. The hops really are prevalent as expected. Smelled very strong of flowers/pine/grapefruit. The beer was slightly bitter but very well balanced and kept me wanting more. I really could sit back with a six of these and watch some football or hockey."
"Pours macro-yellow (not that that's a bad thing) with a little more golden depth to it. Some head and some lacing stay with the beer a couple minutes after the pour, but not much. Aroma is very pilsner-like with most of the aroma coming from the base malt instead of the specialty malts. Very light and clean, almost corn-like. Taste is.. well.. not very pale ale like. More like a pilsner with slightly more body. Soft 2-row taste with the mineral-free water quality to go with it. Soft flavor of aroma hops and maybe just a touch of cascade in there. Well balanced, but slightly watery and not true to style. Overall, a generally above average beer in terms of brewing technique but I think they're a little confused on their definition of an APA."
"This is a very quaffable pale ale that is very flavorful despite its lack of complexity. The flavor actually suffers a little as the ale warms."
"Pours a nice copper color with a slightly off-white head. Smells hoppy, pine forest hoppy, not citrus hoppy. I've been having a lot of beers lately where the malt is followed by the hops in the taste department, this one kind of flips the script. Slammed into a pine tree at first sip, it mellows into biscuity malts by the end. I like it, is it the best beer in the world or even the best from Troegs? No, but it is an extremely solid effort and very sessionable, a few of these would disappear into my belly in no time."
"This is a great offering from Troeg The beer pours a wonderful golden copper color with a bone white head. The taste up front is spicy pine hops but after that you get a nice subtle malty taste. The aroma is the same spicy hops with subtle malts. This is a very drinkable beer for sure. Almost and IPA in its hop."
"Drinkability: This beer is quite drinkable. Smooth and full of flavor. Wish I had regular access to this. Thanks again Dain!"
"An amber color with touches of gold along the sides od the glass. About a half inch high head forms, cream in color, showing tremendous retention. At first scent you are hit with the strong aroma of grapefruit citrus fragrance along with with a grassy aroma. There is also the feint scent of malty mildness finishing off the aroma. That malt comes out at the front of each taste, mild in flavor, almost like a light to bland bread flavor. Then as it reaches the halfway point the hops take over, with grassy, earthy flavors at first, then finishing with a grapefruit bitterness. A light to medium bodied feel, light at the front and gaining weight as it crosses the palate. This is a solid, if not a very good pale ale. Very easy to drink,plus you can throw this at many different dishes and dinners."
"Impressive stuff from a brewery I've heard puts out good brew (can't wait to try Nugget Nectar). Onward to Mad Elf!"
"Pours a crystal clear light copper hue with a two finger fluffy white head that dies down to a thin layer that lasts throughout. Spotty chunky webbing sticks to the sides of the glass. Light pine and fresh citrus up front in the nose with a good dose of floral hops as well. Nice balancing caramel and pale malts in the aroma too. Taste starts off with pine and herbal hops with some bready characteristics. Toasted grains and biscuit flavors midway with a touch of lemon zest. Aftertaste is sweet and malty with a slight bitterness from the hops. Light to medium body with a crisp feel and a solid carbonation. This is what an APA should be. Good flavor, good balance, and easy drinking. I'm so glad Tröegs is finally available in Syracuse. This will definitely frequent my fridge from here on out."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Thanks a lot Sean!"
"Drinkability - You can't really taste the 5% alcohol but after two or three the unexpected sweeter side of this beer would get to you."
"D- this one has the flavor almost like an ipa with a lightness of a... lighter beer. refreshing and somewhat bracing, easy to drink and easy to want more. looking at the website, this beer is like 1/2 pils (liberty & pils malt) and 1/2 APA (cascade & crystal) an ""excellent take on the style"" indeed."
"D - Acceptable, but not particularly noteworthy. I'll drink this if it's around, but I don't think I'll bother to seek it out."
"D: This is a drinkable beer, though it didn't wow me in any particular way. Not bad, though."
"D - Very nice drinkability, owing itself mostly to the crispness and not having too strong of a bitter hop flavor. Could easily enjoy a few of these at any meal or just sitting around."
"This is a very good beer that is very drinkable. The light active body with the balanced flavors make it very easy to drink. I could drink this all night (in fact I have)."
"Medium bodied with pleasant hop freshness off set by just enough malt make this beer easy to drink, completely refreshing and a great value."
"This pale ale has a pale, goldeny, coppery color that's partly cloudy, with a very light head. It smells of sweet malts and light flowery hops. The taste is light, and has a good balance of malt and hops. It tastes just like it smells, good. The mouthfeel is good. Light in body with just enough carbonation. This is such a refreshing and crisp beer. I could definitely see this pale ale turning into one of my regulars."
"Pours a nice hue of orange, decent white head with good retention, nice lacing. Smells like a bouquet of citrus hops. Lots of grapefruit here, but nice malt undertones. Taste: umm, where did those hops go? brief malts, hop bitterness throughout, but not what the nose promised. Citrusy, but not well defined. Dry finish, earns points in the mouthfeel, smell is great, but tasting was a bit of a letdown."
"Rock on Troegs."
"D - Not great but not bad"
"D. A very sessionable pale ale that is hoppy enough for a hop lover and balanced enough for anyone. At 5.4 you could knock a few of these back before a good meal. Good example of a pale ale here."
"Very drinkable a nice sessionable brew was a great lunch beer with my sandwich. I would drink this one again"
"Solid beer."
"D: A great session beer with strong malting obviously yet pleasant hoppiness and a little less than medium body with great aftertaste. This is a special beer in that it does nearly everything well."
"12oz bottle, poured into a glass...cold. Off white head about 1 inch, medium amber color with visible carbonation. Head fades to a nice lacing around the glass. Smells of fruit, perhaps pears, and citrus. Tastes the same, with slight piney or citrus rind taste, also. Light malt sweetness balanced with the citrusy bite of hops, fades to a grapefruit like aftertaste that does not dry the palate overmuch leaving the mouthfeel as lightly creamy and full. There's also slight buttery feel left in the mouth and something of pine or lemon rinds, though it's very faint. Not bad brew and seems to follow the style. Also popped open a second bottle and tried it with pizza and wings and overpowered it badly,my fault, not theirs. 'Wiedersehen, Y'all."
"Overall, it's a pretty nice pale ale that's quite drinkable."
"I'm not usually a fan of cask beers, but this was pretty damn good, I was quite surprised. Usually one and done, but I could have drank this all night."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It poured a pale yellow with a thin, quickly disapearing head. It left lots of lacing on the sides. The nose is of floral hops and the taste follows the nose. It has a thin to medium mouthfeel, adequete carbonation. The beer went down very smoothly. Overall a fine APA."
"All and all it is a very enjoyable Pale Ale and a good first experience with Troegs. Looking forward to trying the rest of their lineup. This is definitely a beer I could drink a few of each night."
"All in all it was okay, I would drink it again, but never pay for it. Not a good rendition of an APA."
"Bottlecap is interesting with the fanciful Troegs logo. Poured a golden-orange color into a pint glass. A small, white head with moderate retention and a small amount of lacing. Aroma is of straw, grass, a little berry fruitiness and some yeast, hops. Taste is like the nose, not overwhelming, with a subdued hop finish. Mouthfeel is not as thin as I expected it, with a perfect amount of carbonation for the light-medium body. Drinkability is very high especially due to the hop character which I enjoyed, as a person who is just starting to appreciate hops in beer."
"Another from Troegs' sampler case. Poured from bottle to a pint glass a clear golden color with a minimal white bubbly head. Smell was sweet hops up front with mild malt and grass. Taste was hoppy but not as strong as smell had me expecting with a mellow bitterness. This was a crisp, hoppy, very drinkable ale. Troegs has made another Gem!"
"Overall not bad at all here This was a very good little session ale that I would have no issue at all with trying out again some day. I would love to find it on cask to give it a good whirl. Definitly worth another look here."
"Overall it's a solid APA, but nothing terribly special. A good session beer."
"*This beer tastes a little better if you let it warm up for about 15-20 mins out of the fridge. Overall, an impressive beer for a brewery I'm starting to really like."
"All around a good brew and worth a try."
"Drinks very easy, another winner from Troegs! Nice APA"
"D: Not too great. Maybe it would be alright with a meal that you didn't want to overpower with beer since it's such a light flavor. Doesn't go well on its own at all."
"d- i loved it! It had a really unique flavor that I wasn't at all expecting but will definitely try again:)"
"This beer is a winner. Whether or not it is really a Pale Ale is not important. The fact is, this brewery continues to impress me. I could see myself becoming a huge fan if they were more readily available in Mass. Thanks to Kidwell for sneaking some in."
"d: I love this as a session Pale. It's not always in stock locally but often enough!"
"d: Nice local APA that is all too hard to find on tap."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold/orange color with an inch frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is mostly citrusy and floral hops with some sweet malt also noticable. It tastes like citrusy and grassy/floral hops and sweet/biscuity malt. Mouthfeel is light/medium, it's a little bit oily and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink, smooth and sessionable. I think this is a good, straight forward pale ale. It's a good all around brew that I would definitely drink again."
"D- The soft malt flavors and the light hops note really needed some nuance to it, and the biscuit malt was a bit to much."
"One of my favorite pale ales."
"This is a sessionable pale ale. A relatively low abv make this easy to put down."
"Pretty good pale ale. If they tone down the grapefruit just a tad it'll be so much better."
"I had this cask tonight @ Once and for all in Patchogue. This beer poured a light amber with minimal head. The smell was nice or malts with a distant smell of hops. A well balanced cask with the flavor between malts and hops, not exactally something I see myself drinking all night but a nice representation of a Pale Ale cask. The mouthfeel very nice but the drinkability was not the greatest."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a translucent, light copper with a one inch tight, off-white cap. Head dissipated quickly into a thin skim of froth; some spotty lacing present during the session. Light floral hops aroma upfront without being overpowering. Taste consistent with nose. Not much complexity but extremely well-balanced with very little hops bitterness lingering between quaffs and a slight citrus quality present towards the back. Light body with lots of effervescence throughout the mouth. Extremely easy drinking offering from Tröegs."
"D: Very pleased. The sweetness of the beer might inhibit my ability to drink one after another but it is very refreshing. Too bad they don't sell this up where I live."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Low alcohol makes this beer quite sessionable. Flavor is alright, but not too impressive. A decent brew."
"Pours a clear light golden brown color with a small but dense cream colored head. Dissipated into a light cap. The aroma is of nice and juicy hops; grassy and fresh. The taste starts off with the grassy hop hit which is subdued by a rather bland and watery malt. Not overly hopped for an APA, which is nice, but the malt is a tad weak. The feel is light, almost watery, with moderate carbonation; finishes with an ever slight hoppy bitterness. Great beer for a hot day. A nice hop profile but a little light on the malt."
"Pours a light copper color with a nice, but rapidly disappearing foamy off-white head, really good lacing on the glass. Moderately piney hop aroma, with some citrus notes, and plenty of malty sweetness. Nice citrusy hop bite, some biscuity/caramel taste. Well-rounded, good mouthfeel with some dryness to the edges. You could drink this with almost any kind of food, and you could definitely put back a few of these. A great APA."
"Drinkability - I enjoyed this beer and it will become a staple of my stock. I would consider this a pretty good ""session"" beer and could definatley see myself having a few of these one evening while sitting on my deck."
"The herbal and earthy hops come through first, with a nice balance from the slightly toasted malts. Toffee flavor noticeable as well. Mouthfeel was creamy and medium-bodied. This is a very tasty APA without trying to go over the top with bitterness. This one oozes with quality."
"Highly recommended as a sessionable pale ale."
"Drinkability: Crisp and light and easy to drink. Decent pale ale, though nothing out of this world."
"Very nice golden yellow with thick puffy slowley receiding head. Looks Great! Smells of Spicy floral/piney hops and sweet earthy malts. Tastes of piney/grassey hops up front with a constant malty sweetness throughout. Hops leave the tongue tingling for something more in the end. Nice light/medium mouth feel and a session brew for sure."
"D: This is a highly drinkable beer with low enough ABV to be considered for a moderate session."
"Pours a crystal clear amber with a white head. Nose is sweet and a bit hoppy. Flavor is bitter and hoppy. Minor pine notes go against the stronger bitter tone. Very minor citrus as well. It's bright and crisp. Feel has a fairly biting carbonation to it. Liquid is a bit slick. Nice to drink. Definitely on the bitter edge and earthy. Would be interesting on cask I bet."
"D: Very easy to drink and like. A great session pale with a clean, sharp citrusy hopping that will make you keep coming back for more."
"D: Great ""session"" beer, easy to drink. Has a lower ABV. Nice balance, not overly complex but one of the better APA's I have had."
"This looks light and coppery with a scant white head and good lacing. I note a sharp pine hops smell, a little unusual but nice. The taste brings out a fine hoppy crispness with some malt background in a full bodied well carbonated ale. This goes down real easy, but is a little dry at the edges. Very nice."
"D: Would I call this the ultimate pale ale? Absolutely not. Far from it. Too thin for me to be really representative of style. Would not tell anyone it's a good example of a pale ale. However, it is a great beer. It's incredibly pleasant and VERY REFRESHING. I will definitely buy again!"
"no aroma, hardly any flavor to call it a pale, very drinkable noetheless, would be good on a hot summers day as a bud or mgd upgrade"
"MF&D- Spicy and crisp with a nice hoppy oil feel leaving behind a sweet sticky mouth coating. Once again Troegs has knocked one out of the park. They have made a true believer out of me. Definitely a session worthy beer."
"Drinkability: An excellent session beer, very crisp and complex for a pale ale. Props to Troegs for their sampler case with this one, the Dreamweaver, Nut Brown and Hop Back; it should be called a session case."
"MF&D - A little thinner then I usually like. Smooth and slightly oily texture. Above average drinkability. Good session ale."
"D - I love Troegs Pale Ale, and the dry hopping really kicks things up a notch, creating a very fresh, flavorful ale. Could drink several of these in one sitting."
"Pours a clear and light amber color with small offwhite head. Smell is grainy malt mostly with light hops in the nose as well. Taste is smooth creamy, fruity malt and a nice moderate bitterness and light hop flavor but enough to let you know its a solid pale ale. Medium to thin bodied with moderate carbonation. Goes down easy and is extremely sessionable. Nice pale."
"I felt that this was a pretty average pale ale. It's okay, but I feel it's nothing special, just another Pale Ale. The hops were there but they weren't in the range that I would expect from an APA or as balanced as an EPA. It's stuck in the middle."
"I had two 20oz imperial pints."
"One of the more hop-centric pale ales out there. Not surprising considering this comes from the makers of Nugget Nectar and Hopback...good stuff, and extremely drinkable. I could see a huge glass of this stuff doing just the right thing for a summer afternoon."
"very clear pale golden with a white head that fades quick but leaves nice lace. nose is hops with pale malt just like it should be. more hoppy than malty with some nice citrus flavors. good medium body, but the finish is quicker than i hope for. very good, but not stellar pale ale."
"drinkability: i could drink a bunch of this stuff"
"into a shaker pint at The Black Squirrel, DC"
"Pours a crisp bubbly pale orange with a thin head that leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is a nice subtle blend of sweet malts and earthy citrus hops. The taste is citrus hops up front with sweet fruity malts and slight caramel right behind. The body is light and crisp with just enough carbonation. This is a great refreshing Pale that would make for a great session or just a smooth nightcap."
" I had no idea of the ABV % until I looked above, since it can't be detected at all. Hopheads won't go too crazy for this, but for those looking for an east coast version of this style, or a beer that's great bang for the buck, look no further than this. Treogs has a light, refreshing pale ale on their hands here, and this should be an excellent warm-up to their beer that I will be enjoying by the end of this week!"
"Great depiction of the style..."
"A good, solid brew that seems pretty versatile with food. Nice representation of an American Pale Ale without going too far off into the hop realm like many of its West Coast counterparts. I'd probably keep a sixer of these around if they were available in the land of the dropped r's."
"It fit right in with the rest of them."
"Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for the bottle!"
"Pours a clear burnt orange with a mid-sized white head. Light sweet caramel and orangey citrus nose, anchored by grassy hops. Light caramel sweetness in the flavor with a toasted biscuit backbone. There is a light citrus overtone and the finish is mildly bitter earthy hops that linger for a bit. Light-medium body with fresh carbonation and oily smoothness keeps this one quite drinkable. Not an overpowering APA by any means, but pretty much a straight up classic."
"D- Good beer but i would only enjoy it as a variety pack. I dont know if i would purchase a six pack of it on its own. I would def have it over a miller lite though at the restaurant."
"Drinkability: High! this is an excellent session pale ale. Nothing to complain about with this one. Not too bitter, just a spectacularly balanced pale ale."
"D = This is a very drinkable beer. It tastes good and is low enough ABV that you could have a few. It is just a little disappointing in taste given that other elements are very good."
"Overall another great beer by Troegs that is just so damn drinkable. Not an overly complex beer, but just do darn solid. Do we expect anything less? Cheers Troegs."
"Pours a clear amber color. Aroma is pine with a light malt background. Taste is pine and grassy hops. Light in the citrus with a pretty big maltiness. A good APA, seems less ""intense"" than other Troegs beers. Good session beer, easy to drink."
" Overall an excellent session beer that isn't too far from being an all out ipa, actually have had ipa's that are more toned down than this PA. Again, i wish Troegs was available in my area or at least upstate NY. This is the 4th selection from this brewery and i haven't been disappointed yet-someone find me the Nugget Nectar!"
"I believe I have a new favorite PA (and would take this over most IPAs too)."
"D - Very nice session beer....a fine example of an American PA. Could drink this one in succession with ease."
"Final Note: This was the first Tröegs beer I tried and now that their beers are available in my area, it sure as hell won't be my last."
"Damn, nice pale ale. The only thing I can say is that it isn't crisp enough for my taste. There's a great hops profile in the aroma and flavor of fruity, hops resin with relatively sweet grapefruit and a decent, but not big, bitterness. There a touch of toffee and caramel malt in the back, but this is a smooth (odd, but ok I guess) and hoppy beer. Find this and enjoy it."
"Cheers!"
"Pours out a clarified copper with a healthy white head and sheets of ornate lacing. Amazing balance of hops and malt in the nose. Loads of grapefruit with undertones of grass and a sweet caramel maltiness. Lots of caramel, toffee, and hinted at toast in the forefront of the flavor. It's hard to say when the hop presence comes in as everything melds together so well. Some citrus and modest pine. Drying finish. Body is moderate and with mild, soft bubbles. This is one of the best pale ales I've ever had and really reminded me of how good a pale ale can be."
"Body is on the lighter side of medium, with a clean mouthfeel and great drinkability."
"Overall, a pretty good American pale ale, but not a great one. I'll drink this if I'm handed one, but there are better examples of this style that I'd prefer."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a white ½ rocky head. The aroma of fresh hops hits the senses immediately upon opening the bottle. The taste is bitter and heavy of hops. There is enough sweetness in the malt to balance the brew. The mouthfeel is medium to full. This is a very clean and easily drinkable beer."

This is one of the best pale ales I've ever had and really reminded me of how good a pale ale can be."
"you're probably a pretty happy person."
"This beer is the definition of drinkable. This is a beer I could drink bottle after bottle with hot wings, pizza, burgers, ect."
"Drinkability- This is one of those mildly hoppy beers that can be enjoyed at anytime. Its well balanced and super tasty all around. Its what youd expect from a Pale Ale. Great beer!"
"Cloudy, light caramel colour with a whitish head. Awesome retention and the lacing was solid foam that formed rings at each sip. Citrusy aroma (grapefruit and mild orange) with a hint of malt. Quite a mild flavour with medium/low bitterness. Balanced malt sweetness with mild citrus hopping. A little watery and thin, very low carbonation. Very easy drinking, but seems to need some extra carbonation to prop up the body. I'll try it again in bottles or draft to see how that changes things."
"First heard of this brewery from brother Jer...12 oz. bottle from a sampler poured into a shaker...solid copper body with even, strong two-finger head--attractive indeed...appropriate hops, though understated...a palate approach that rivals Sierra Nevada...a solid taste that softens with each sip...enjoyable from top to bottom."
"D: The smooth, balanced taste and nice mouthfeel make this one a winner. I imagine that this would make a great session beer."
"So, this is a really good beer. Gently bitter, not too sweet, not too strong. Very pleasant going down. I'd like to see them experiment a little - go crazy. I mean, they're obviously good brewers..."
"D- this was a great cask ale. Smooth and creamy with a refreshing hop balance. Quite delicious."
"Great carbonation caps a style-typically light amber brew. Fades a little quickly. Orange-esqe and grapefruit NW U.S. hops masks some lightly sweet caramel notes on the nose. Solid hops flavor supports with enough malt to keep it interesting, moderately complex and less sweet (in a good way) than many brews in the style. One of the better AIPAs, especially for the price, that I've sampled on the east coast. Mouthfeel is a little watery, but not a major detraction. Very well balanced with good hop bitterness for finishing. Well rounded and smooth. Very drinkable beer, and I highly recommend as a session beer. Not in the same league as the great AIPAs, but it's a very good beer and well worth keeping around and serving to guests."
"D - very smooth with good flavor. I would definitely buy this again."
"D- A very good, hoppy beer. Enough said!"
"D: Highly drinkable beer, I'd be more than happy to session this beer."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug. A light amber color that was pleasant to watch with pretty good carbonationa nd a good, solid, half-inch, white head. The head was nice, thick, and foamy and retained throughout the entire beer, which was quite nice. Smell was a little hoppy; not overbearing at all. Malts were also very prevalant, providing a nice balance. Taste was about the same, although the malts were more evident than the hops, which was a little surprising. As I drank the beer more, the hops began to come out more to provide the nice balance to the malts that I had expected in the first place. The mouthfeel was very nice; nice, and full-bodied, not very thick ro thin at all. Pretty drinkable overall; nice easy-going beer. A little warming but nothing overbearing at all. Quite pleasant."
"12 oz bottle into a mug. One finger of white head on top of a nice orange-ish amber color. Lots of little bubbles rising through the crystal clear beer. Looks pretty tasty. Nice lacing too. Nose is mostly hops, with some definite fruitiness coming through, and some floral hints. First taste is strong hops, although not overwhelming. Grapefruit and other fruits in there too. Light caramel malt sweetness too. Lingering bitterness sits on the tongue for just a bit. Feel is thin to medium bodied with solid carbonation. Yet another great offering from Troegs. A quality beer that might not astound the taste buds but is an all around good beer, close to sessionable."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden color, nice carbonation, nice two finger off-white creamy head which lasted awhile, nice small islands and sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is of sweet malts, hops, grapefruit, and caramel. The taste is very nice of hops/malts, grapefruit and slight caramel. Medium body, well balanced brew. Very drinkable, a true APA."
"This poured a very clear copper with a slightly off white head that left plenty of lacing. It has a clean hoppy smell, a piney resinous smell with some floral notes, and a white bread background. The taste is excellent, a little bite form the carbonation then some sweetness and just a hint of piney bitterness. The body is on the heavy side of medium, maybe it was too cold, with a biting carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, it is right up there with SNPA in my opinion."
"A nice payoff from BitterBrian in the Super bowl o beer bet."
"Taste is highly reflective of the aroma, nice fruity/citrusy hop flavors on top of a sufficient malt backbone. Medium carbonation and med/light bodied ale. A little hoppier than most pale ale's I'm already accustomed to, but goes down easy and still very well balanced, nonetheless. My mouth is watering for another and I believe this would make a terrific session beer."
"Very well rounded brew- pours clean and crisp, with a very decent sized head. Crips aromas of slight citrus hops and a very clean crystal malt. Great carbonation, though it seems heavier than other pales. Slightly sticky on the mouth, nice balance of fruity malts and a dry hopped finish. Excellent, refreshing and definately a go to for a sessionable beer."
"A very good beer i go all the way PA to get this stuff!"
"This a must try beer."
"A decent ""session"" ale. A bit imbalanced for the style. It almost begs to be an IPA, but doesn't quite make it. Easy to drink, especially if you like hoppier pale ales."
"Poured a nice golden amber color with a fluffy white head leaving some lacing. Smell is rather weak, I think it's trying to be citrus-y, but just not really succeeding. Taste is much of the same, it has stuff going on, but it's just not very flavorful and good things. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and had average carbonation. Drinkability was merely, ""meh;"" I could finish it, but it just isn't something I plan on having again. I'll be sure to try other offerings from Tröegs, but this one started me out on the wrong foot."
"Pours a great frothy head with an awesome lacing. It also has a hazy yellow brown color that's nice. The smell is hoppy with an underlying skunk to it. The taste is hoppy and light with a little funky skunk to it. The mouthfeel is ok, but at the same time not so great. I will never try this again."
"Md thick due to dextrinous character (dang, too thick for the style). Mild carbonation put a playful fine sting. Well done APA, about as good as I've had of the style."
"Drinkability here is top-notch, this is a great session beer."
"Drinkability - Despite all my gripes above, I actually did enjoy the beer overall. Just more the fact that I didn't fit the style quite well, I'd definetly have another though if offered (though I'd prob pursue other Pale Ales)."
"Mouthfeel is light-to-medium bodies, tangy, and little oily. I enjoyed it, and I give this ale very good marks for drinkability. Recomended."
"12oz. bottle poured into a mug a dark golden color with a nice puffy white head and some lacing. Smell of citrus hops. Taste of malt and citrus, floral hop bitterness. Good medium body beer that is easily drinkable. A nice addition in their sampler case."
"Beer courtesy of MuenchenerKindl."
"Drink: Decent drinker. Nothing groundbreaking but a nice pale ale."
"The ABV is 5.4%, so it's low enough to session on. If you like hops give it a try!"
"The pour into my Sam Smith pint raises a short head, off white. The lacing is sticky with skinny lines. The beer's color is a light golden copper. Head retention leaves something to be desired. The nose is dominated by citrusy hops, with just a mild malt aroma. The taste is nutty, grapefruity, and mildly bitter, with some acidity. The beer achieves a very drinkable balance as it warms. The mouth is on the thicker side, and the carbonation is sublime. Overall, this is a drinkable, easy pale ale, with some initial hop kick, but not much complexity."
"D - Unique blend leads to a very drinkable APA. When you smell it, nothing really jumps out at you, but the malt-hop flavor combination makes for an everyday APA."
"the carbonation was not overpowering, but made a good drinkability. I think im gonna have a few more tonight"
"drinkability: high"
"Overall a nice low key APA. Very very quaffable. An excellent session beer."
"This is a very drinkable pale ale and highly recommended for those of you who are not looking for a hop blast everytime. Would be a good choice for a session APA."
"Overall, A pretty good interperetation of the style but there are better like sierra nevada pale ale"
"Drinkability: One of the most pleasant APAs I've ever had--session in every way, I wish I had about ten more of these. One of the most enjoyable (though not the most exciting) pale ales I've had in a while."
"Wonderfully done. I'm very glad Muenchenerkindl was kind enough to send this one my way. Very drinkable. Perfect for sipping on a Friday afternoon after skipping out of work early. It's great!"
"D-Very good,hoppy,good beer, would recommend to others.Well worth $9.25 for a 6 pack."
"Drinkability is very high, very easy to drink would go well with spicy foods. This beer is refreshing & pleasant yet offers a bolder taste up front then most. Prosit MK"
"Drinkability/Overall: APA has never been my favorite style and this isn't the greatest rendition I've had either. Leafy and plasticky instead of juicy and malty. Still a decent beer that's fairly easy to drink."
"The flavor is fruity and hoppy just like the aroma, so good I wish I could find it more often. Almost a mild IPA, a perfect session beer."
"Clear amber gold with a frothy white head. Voluminous carbonation. Juicy citrus Cascade aroma. Big, lingering bitterness. Big citric/floral hop flavors balance well with sweet hops. Finish very dry and mildly acidic. Medium bodied and clean overall. Very juicy. Very drinkable."
"Poured a clear gold, with a slight orange color, modest amount of head. Aroma was primarily hops, no real smell of malt or anything else to speak of. Flavor was similar, with hops coming across as orange/lemon citrus. Slightly bitter, but in a good way. A light bodied beer, with medium to high carbonation, somewhat drying. Very refreshing, and excellent session beer."
"A nice light copper and foamy head. Significant aroma of grapefruit and the malt. Refreshingly carbonated bitterness and malt, nicely balanced. A touch citrus and fruity. Bit drying finish, excellent with light food, and with that it is very quaffable. Second bottle 21 months later, good bitterness though aggressive side of carbonation."
"Golden color with foamy white head that leaves behind nice lacing. Great citrus hops smell that blends nicely with the caramel maltyness. Note that this one must be put into a glass to really get the citrus note. Out of the bottle it becomes somewhat plain but in a glass it really shines. Taste is just as enjoyable, nice maltyness with just enough of a citrus hops note to give it some character. Clean dry finish with just a hint of bitterness. Overall a very clean beer that makes a good session beer. Another winner from Troegs."
"This is one incredible session brew!! Slight maltiness takes the top, followed by an almost dry-hopped finish, that is smoother than hell. Nice cirtusy, piney smell to it and a delicate balanced of great hops and malt. The taste doesn't linger, making you yearn for the next sip. I just went over to PA and tried this at a hotel and bought a case of it. If you are looking to put a few away, I cannot think of a better session beer."
"Overall a very drinkable APA. Maybe not the best I've had of this style, but still very good."
"Overall a quite nice beer, very refreshing (have i already said that?) I believe the six pack cost about $9."
"Drinkability: Troegs Pale Ale would make a great session beer. Highly drinkable and well balanced. Not one element of this beer dominates the other, so the palate doesn't get worn out from too much hops or too much sweet, malts. At 5.4% abv, I could easily put these back throughout an evening session. A nice pale ale and one I would definitely have again. Another fine beer from one of the mid-atlantic's best breweries. Seek out and enjoy this well balanced APA."
"This beer poured a light orange. There is a small head and no lacing. The smell is hoppy and semi-sweet. The taste is bitter. It is fairly smooth for the style. There is a lingering bitterness in the mouthfeel. There was no harshness. I could drink this beer again. A good beer from Troegs. Just a bit too bitter for me to consider a session beer."
"This beer seemed like something in between an English pale ale and an American pale ale to me. The low carbonation and partial English hop flavor threw me a little bit. Not a bad beer at all, just not quite what I expected. This is one I think I will have to try again to see if I feel the same way."
"This is not a hop bomb type of beer, but it is a very good hoppy beer."
"This beer defines the style in my opinion!"
"overall: not a bad offering, wouldn't be my first choice though due to the absence of the bitterness that i alluded to earlier...if looking for an american style pale ale, there are better choices out there, but standing alone it is a pretty tasty choice"
"Mild smooth and drinkable, that is what this beer excels at. If I would change one thing about it I would add more aroma hops but not everyone is attuned to the West Coast HopHeads thoughts on the subject. A good beer and a good choice to lure Budweiser drinkers to better beers."
"Drinkability: This is a very well crafted beer. The beer is easy to drink and is definately a sessionable beer."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing and crisp with just the right amount of hops. One of my favorites to session."
"Drinkability: A damn solid pale ale. Troegs once again doesn't disappoint. I could certainly throw back a few of these in a session without a problem."
"12 oz bottle, best by 4/20, served in a pint glass. Pours a clear bright copper, two fingers off foamy off-white head, pretty decent retention and nice lacing. Nose is a nice herbal and citrus hops over a slight bready malt. Taste is smooth biscuity malt with a herbal slightly tea-like hoppiness, finishing with a gentle lingering bitterness. Medium/full bodied with a nice smooth mouthfeel. This is a really solid pale ale, a good easy drinker."
"First taste was metallic. Had to wipe the top of the bottle. Second taste was of citrus fruits mostly grapefruit and bitter hops. No traces of pine syrup like I expected. The hop bitterness is well balanced with the dryness of the malts in this one. Feels crisp and big bubbly. I like it. I don't care much for pale ales but I find this one drinkable. Remindes me of Sierra Nevada IPA. I'd say this one is good for the style."
"D - A nice drinkable pale ale that has a great hop profile, but doesn;t give you a hop shock. Basically falls between an average pale ale and SNPA in hoppiness. Me being a hophead I prefer the big hopped APAs like SN or my favorite, Alpha King, but I know many drinkers who find those too hoppy for the style. I'd suggest this brew by Troegs as a nice tasting, drinkable APA for drinkers with tastes along those lines."
"Overall: I was really impressed with this hand-pumped brew. It's solid enough bottled or on tap, but having it hand-pumped was the kicker. If you can find it, get it. You will not be dissapointed. I'm going back to get more!"
"-UF"
"A PA session ale for all seasons. Loaded with flavor, but easily consumed during all night Appalachian drinking sessions."
"This beer is a great example of a Pale Ale. This is a really easy drinking brew, with a great creamy mouthfeel. The malt though subdued plays an important role here; it really helps to balance the hops so that they are not too harsh."
"yellow mixes fantastically with gold and orange.. the bubbles bring excitement to the crystal clear body. heady, nice and pillowy. disappears slowly leaving cloudlike patterns on the surface and webby lace. fresh, crunchy amarillo hop nose. essential and juicy. sweet in a floral way. drinks easy... light, airy bready character accented by those fruity hops. slightly metallic in the finish masked mostly by the faintest of bitternesses.. like a cherry stone. this beer is one of life's simple pleasures.. if hopback is medium and nugget nectar is high, this is a delightful low. another great beer from a great brewery."
"Glassy gold with a nice white head and even some stickiness. Smell is exactly what one would want in a pale ale, hops over a light malt base. Taste is more of the same. Fine malt and hop blend right off the bat, leading to a crispy finish. Mouthfeel was fine, a medium and this was an excellently drinkable brew. A fine pale ale and readily available where I live. I'll be keeping this one handy."
"A copper colored ale with loads of white head that dissipates quickly and leaves behind minimal lacing. Aromas of hops, citrus, and pine seem to surface. The taste is dominated by hop bitterness that doesn't not fluctuate. Fruity flavors are also present but they are very much secondary and take a back seat to the hops. A refreshing brew with a dry finish that goes down easy and is filled with hop flavor. A very good APA."
"Final Thought: A classic session beer with all the solid components of a pale ale; light and tasty."
"Not too many East Coast Pales can hang with their Western brethren, but this baby fits in nicely with those from RR and Stone. Many thanks to froggyfrog for this one!"
"A pale ale more on the darker side. Smells great, with hops all over your nose. The taste gets really close to IPA territory, but pulls back right at the edge, giving only a hint of bitterness instead of engulfing you. Excellent toasty finish. This is a mighty fine pale ale, and more than worthy of its above-4.0 rating."
"Ah....fresh, hoppy beer. Simple pleasures, my friends. One of the better pale ales I've had in a while."
"Taste: Hops shine through nicely in the flavor as well, oily, herbal and a great mouth-puckering finish. Could use a bit more malt, but a very interesting example of this style that may be run-of-the-mill for some but quite rare in my neck of the woods."
"It's mild, but it is far form wimpy. A pleasant pale that places its poignant parts precisely on the palate, it pleases plausibly, and then you realize, it's damned good and damned simple as well. The down-home flavor and simplicity make this about as drinkable as it could get, if it's something you enjoy, of course. And I enjoy it- quite a bit, in fact- and I envision sessions centered on this tasty creation."
"D - The taste does it for this one. A solid APA, one that is hard pressed to be outdone in flavor. It is good for a session beer and it would go well with food as well. Troegs is a great brewery, and this the quality I expect."
"Thanks to mntlover for delivering this one from the East Coast..."
"This is a damn good pale ale; hops are the showpiece here, but the malt supports it well. It's clean, fresh, and very refreshing. IMO, this is better than SNPA. No kidding! Highly recommended."
"thanks goes to weerae 138 ,. poured a amber wit a off wite head. aroma hops, and malts, grapefruit. flavor gotta love thise cascade hops they jump right out there. got some lemon and grapefruit and just a hint of malts. this was a good beer. would like to get this again"
"12 oz., bottled on 5/3/05 - served chilled in a nonic. Pours an amber/burnt orange and it's topped with a 1 inch tan head that leaves nice rings and sheets of lace on the glass. Smells like hops - pineapple, grapefruit, orange, pine, and floral/leafy, along with some toasty/biscuity malts. It is crisp on the palate with a medium body and a smoothness that makes me think it's bottle-conditioned. There's pineapple, grapefruit, orange, floral, and spicy/oily hop characteristics - all with a medium bitterness and biscuity/toasty malts and a hint of sweetness to balance. High drinkability - I could drink these all night. And the next night. And the next...."
"Purchased as part of sampler pack.poured a crystal cream amber color with off-white puffy head. Smell is hoppy with citrus notes. Taste is hoppy with notes of fruit. Leaves a nice dry bitterness in the mouth without being over-powering. Another good beer from Troegs."
"A very pleasant golden pale ale, with minimal carbonation or head. Suble hop aroma compliments the smooth crisp piney hop scent. Not overpowering, but very nice. Clean and sharp, with a touch, but not too much, hop oil. Overall, and excellent pale. I was very pleased to find a Troeg's mixed pack during a recent visit to PA, and brought home a case."
"The beer was a nice golden-light amber color, but the head was pretty lacking. The aroma was not bad, but rather bland, with a faint hint of malt that comes across more grainy. I don't get much if any hop aroma. The flavor is pretty good, though - nice and clean, good crisp bitterness coming through, very drinkable. Overall this seems a tad light on the hop aroma and flavor but its a pretty good beer."
"One of the best-tasting pale ales I've had; another great beer from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
"Very drinkable brew, one that was enjoyed surf fishing, swimming, and with several foods. A good all around beer and follows the style as expected."
"Pours a pale copper. Good hop aroma, pine and citris, leaning towards pine. Off white, thick and creamy head, medium sized bubbles. High carbonation, but not overkill. Enough to keep the head around. (actually, it maintained for the entire duration of the glass!) The initial taste matches the aroma. Pine with a hint of citris that quickly gives way to a hint of sweetness before finishing bitter. Great every day beer. I am impressed with the entire lineup from this brewery."
"Drinkability - great everyday beer, a little more of a hop bite than Sierra Nevada and more carbonation too."
"Drinkability: I could have a few of these. Goes down smoothly and quickly, without becoming overbearing in any regard. Well done."
"A good pale ale, but sort of forgetable. I would, however, pick this over many other commercially available pales."
"The beer comes from merlin48. Thanks for this one. It pours a clear golden color with a small head that falls to coar the beer. The nose is rather nice, with a sweet citrusy hop and a sweet malt that gives this beer a slightly orenagey tone. The flavor is slightly orange sweet, slightly citrusy hop and slightly pepper hop as well. I like it. The feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. I like the interplay of the sweet and hop flavors. Another nice Troegs beer."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this one. Highly sessionable, since it is hoppy without being one of those beers that fries your tasetbuds after half a bottle. Definitely worth a try."
"I admit I was concerned that Troegs did not have much to offer but was pleasantly suprised with this Pale Ale. Definitely recommended."
"Overall a very flavorful ale that has a great hop character but remains very well balanced with the tasty malt. This beer is up there with the best of APA's with its great real beer flavor and thirst quenching abilities. A great local beer to kick back with anytime of the year and for any occasion, whether to pair up with some fine food, or by itself for a session."
"Pouring into a pint glass from a 12 oz. bottle, it pours a golden-honey color w/ 2 fingers of foamy, sticky, clingy head that sticks to the glass like glue. Very clean looking brew. Bright citrus hops and floral tones accentuate this brew. Slight sweetness of rock candy comes through just enough to offset the hops. Also a slight grainy pine aroma as well comes through to me. Taste is bitter but smooth w/ grainy tasting grapefruit. Very citrussy w/ some slight sweetness of sugars throughout. However, not too complex in flavor. Feel is wonderful! Carbonation up front on the tongue gives way to a very smooth swallow and a very little alcohol burn. Very light in body but warming at the same time. Although it leaves a little bit to be desired in flavor, this is a very light, smooth, easy ale to drink! Another nice one from the Troegner Brothers!"
"Overall-an absolutely top notch pale ale, while not perfect Troeg's has brewed a classic pale ale with exceptional flavor, highly rated from me."
"Pours a nice clear amber color with very few signs of carbonation. Has a huge frothy head that leaves nice lacing. Head has great retention as well. This beer is very clean and fresh on the nose, mostly malty with a mild hop smell. Also hints of flowers and citrus. Tastes very malty at first with a bit of caramel, then finishes nice and dry with the perfect amount of hops to round it off. Feels nice and creamy in the mouth. This is such a well balanced beer it's extremely drinkable. Overall another nice offering from Troeg's. Definitly worth a try."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability: Awesome. This is Troeg's best beer IMO, and I've tried just about every one they've put out. A true session beer if there ever was one. A great deal also, but I imagine distribution is limited. Beermail for trade."
"interestingly, the six-pack carrier claims the brew to be ""aggressively hopped," but i didn't see this as the case. it was actually very well balanced"
"Not quite as good as their Amber Ale offering, but pretty darn good, nonetheless. Appearance is a light copper with a nice chinky white head and outstanding lacing. Smell is lightly fruity with some maly undertones. Taste is mainly lightly tart throughout, with a pleasant hop finish...not as balanced as some offerings, but the nice lightly hop quality was a plus IMHO. Mouthfeel is medium, with a very slight oily quality that is not a drawback. Easy on the drinkability scale...recommended."
"The head is moderate but firm and carbonation is just right for an IPA. I found this to be a great summer time thirst quencher and I will be getting it ontap again in the near future."
"12 ounce bottle, with no freshness dating to be found. Pours a nice gloden light amber,clear, white medium bubble head, dissolving to a tiny bubble film and leaving well developed lacing. Nice hoppy nose, notes of yeasty bread as well. Medium bodied. well hopped PA, slight citric bite, but not bitter. Very drinkable, well crafted brew. Troegs continues to impress."
"Taste: Initial sweet maltiness. Soft in the mouth, with a nice spiciness. Big grapefruit juice hop bite toward the end, and a nice lingering crispness. Medium-bodied, and only moderately dry in the finish."
"Troegs doesn't brew bad beer (although I wasn't at all impressed with Mad Elf, I can see how some might like it). Pale Ale is a solid pale ale, but isn't one that I'd go out of my way for. I did enjoy this bottle though."
"Re-Review on 5-27-04: Didn't know I had ever tried this until I tried to review as a new one. RoyalT and ngandhi really pegged this one for what it is. An absolutely extraordinary American pale ale. Today, I could have sworn there were no Cascades hops in this one, as the flavors and aromas seemed so smooth and lush, bathed in apple, pear, lemon, and orange. I went to the brewery website to see what hops varieties were used, and, sure enough, it says Cascades. Some pine and grapefruit emerge at the finish, this time, but this is just so smooth and balanced most of the way through. Must be the Crystal Malt. This is now my favorite pale ale. Extraordinary drinkability as an all purpose ale."

"Drink and be happy."
"Another in a long line of reviews I'm finally getting around to posting. Part of a sampler 12 pack brought back by one of my friends as a Christmas gift. Clear, light amber, with a one-finger, off-white head which diminishes fairly quickly and leaves minimal lacing on the glass. Nice aroma of fruity (citrus scents) hops issues forth both during the pour and once in the glass. A fairly nice tasting beer, some sweetness gives way to a bit of hop bitterness in the finish, again the fruity taste of hops is present. Thin to medium bodied with a bit of oiliness left in the mouth. An overall nice beer--not exceptional but on average pretty good, and I'm sure I'll try it again."
"Beer is good. Happy (local) beering."
"This poured your standard deep amber color with a nice, frothy off -white head. The smell was slightly hoppy with a touch of citrus, pine and malt sweetness. The taste was pretty complex with a nice hop bite that mellowed near the end. This was very drinkable and a welcome change after some big IPA's and a couple of lemony wheat's. Troeg's has a great line up and you should try them all if possible. Really easy drinking anytime brew at a decent price as well."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is good. It has a nice balance between malts and hops. It is slightly malty and has a fine hop aroma. The taste is great. It has a complex malty core made up of pale and light crystal malts. There is also a strong hop flavor that makes this beer. It goes down easy and really satisfies. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine pale ale. It has great flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel. What else is there?"
" It is balanced very well, and at the same time the mild hops bite just enough. It is very crisp, and could really hit the spot out in the sun. I will certainly be looking for this one over the summer. Drinkability is excellent. The beer has enough flavor to keep from boring me."
"Pours a nice golden amber with white head that falls to a nice white ring that laces down the glass. Smells of subdued pine hops, not as strong as could be. Taste of fruity citrus hops, not too bitter, nice crisp refreshing brew. Light and refreshing average pale ale nothing out of the ordinary, but also nothing extraordinary."
"my favourite brewery of the moment, troegs puts out good to great stuff, and i've yet to sample anything bad from them. while not mindblowing, their pale ale is solid and a bit different nonetheless. it pours a light orange/amber colour with a nice thick, foamy head. the body looked to be a bit thin, but other than that, solid all around. the smell was quite floral with sweetness all about. fruit smells were enticing on top of hop and malt. the flavour echoed the smell, but was more fruit flavoured than floral, though the floral flavouring was still apparent in it's own right. this one was light to medium bodied and actually juicy it seemed. like i said, different, but nice. moutthfeel was just right for a pale ale and this was a crisp, easy drinking brew. took as few sips to warm up to this one, but after that it was certainly tasty and enjoyable. definitely worth a try."
"Another real good offering from Troegs,pours a nice deep golden color with with a light but well retaines head,aroma is more on the malty sweetish side with some nice fruitiness as well.A very well balanced ""Pale"" nice biscuity sweetish malt to begin with with some grassy hop coming thrue in the finish.A very easy drinking appetizing brew from Troegs I think I will waste the rest of the day in these."
"An amber color with a nice golden hue. The head is a nice fluffy white with little lacing. The smell is a rush of hops to the head with a hint of citrus. The taste lives up to the smell with a little bit of citrus taste and a very good amount of hop character. The hops stimulate your tastebuds and get your mouth ready for another taste. The aftertaste is a hoppy dry one but still very good. A quality Pale Ale that you don't want to put down. Very nice for any season."
"Overall a very nice brew."
"Drinkability: The weird herby taste is slightly offputting, but I must figure out just what in tarnation it is. I'll guess I'll have to drink the others I got.. and I won't be complaining one bit."
"Golden brew with small white head which quickly fell. Aroma of cascade hops and slight caramel in the background. Flavor is well done with sweet caramel initial impression that quickly changed to a well balanced yet bitter beer. The pleasant bitterness increases and lingers well into the dry finish. The mouthfeel is good for a pale ale and the drinkability is good as well."
"Pours with a decent, slighty rocky, pure white head of medium-sized bubbles that quickly fades from the inside out, leaving nice, sticky lace around edges of glass. Color is very nice, bright (!) amber-to-honey colored, with orange highlights. Hop smell comes right out of the bottle; fruity hops are up front in the aroma, with a sweet, mellow orangey quality. For this review, I'm drinking this beer at a slighty higher temperature than usual, and the complexity of flavor has increased. Served cold, I recall more of a piney hop bite; this serving has a more distinct fruitiness to it. Subtle malt background, but the real show is the robust, resiny hops... is this halfway to an IPA? Very refreshing mouthfeel. Although a bit thin in body, that resiny hop character leaves a sticky bite that lingers. As for drinkability, I highly enjoy this by the six-pack, especially with that moreish, lip-smacking hop body. Pairs well with just about any main course at mealtimes and a pleasurable beer in just about any situation."
"Another quality brew from Troegs, and though it's overshadowed by its cousin the Hopback, this beer deserves some acclaim of its own. As good as the West Coast pale ales, only made a lot closer to home. Definitely one I'll be having again!"
"So far, I've yet to meet a beer from Troeg's I didn't like!"
"The Pale Ale poured nicely sporting a copper color with slight head. A mellow aroma that doesn't spark any extra interest. Hop flavor distinguishes this pale ale as it is bold but not overpowering. More hoppy than other Pales, but definitely not entering the IPA zone. The malt flavor slightly hides behind the hops, but has a good taste that I enjoy. After finishing, I opened another one. Very drinkable and satisfying."
"A nice example of a Pale ale. Thanks PintOfAle for the bonus beer."
"A BIG Thanks to Francisweizen for this one!"
"Appears a copper crystal clear color with an off white cream hued head. A healthy sized enduring head with a nice collar of lace forming as the lace settles, and as the glass empties the lace continues to cling form scattered patterns within annular rings spaced nicely with each sip. In the aroma, cascades make the appearance with floral, grapefruit tones with some hops of the pine cone esque variety going on here all built upon a backbone of caramel buttered malted barley also coincides to form balance. Taste is primarily bittering hops with tones of pine cones, earthy dicotamous grittiness on the palate, but by no means is this beer a palate killer just a wonderful representation of a balanced pale ale. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body, on the thin side but the oily texture from hop resins adds a nice sensation to the consistency of the texture. Drinkability easily a session no beer brewed Troeg's is as a drinkable except for the Hopback, but if I couldn't get a keg of the Hopback Amber for my kegerator than I would go with this brew very nice."
"Translucent tawny-gold hue. Smallish white head that collapsed quickly, soapy residue that did produce thin rings of lace. Very inviting nose, pleasantly hoppy raw & leafy with grapefruit highlights, a note of floral too, even a faint kiss of malt. The bouquet is dead-on for the style (it does lack a little potency)! The invitation is not misleading awesomely hoppy palate, just raw enough, bitter and crisp, kisses of toasty malt leafy and dry finish. Balanced and flavorful the grapefruit influence is mild and blended well with the floral influences. Tremendously drinkable! Medium body. Ideal carbonation. Hoppy and more-ish aftertaste yeah, Id love to have this beer in my daily diet. Recommend!"
"Thanks to Francisweizen for the bottle."
"Pours a golden copper color with a foamy white head that quickly settles into a thin and sticky lace. Nose is grapefruit, citrusy hops, and a touch of fresh pine. Just a touch too thin to call this medium-bodied with a slightly sticky texture. Taste initially is sweet malts and dry grains but is soon lost in the strong flavors of bitter hop resins with notes of grapefruit rind and pine oil that linger on the tongue in a lasting aftertaste. Pairs wonderfully with a fresh tomato, basil, and garlic pizza. The ABV is listed as 5.4% on their website. Thanks to francisweizen for the sample!"

"Pours a beautiful amber color with striking clarity, topped by a thick, off white head that displays tremendous staying power. It generates a sticky, clinging lace on the glass. Nice, hoppy citrus aroma smells very fresh and clean, with a touch of soapiness. The initial taste is mostly hops, with a noticeble mild hop flavor. Not a smack you around hoppiness like many AIPA's, but just a prominent, floral/citrus/soapy hoppiness. After a couple sips, the malt sweetness becomes apparent and really balances out this beer beautifully. A touch of bitterness on the finish leads to a lingering hop-laced sweetness on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very solid as well. Not as outstanding as the rest of the beer though. The drinkability is very good as well. I'd love to have a bunch of these on hand. This is a masterfully crafted beer. Truly outstanding. I can't say enough about this beer. Wow. And to think this has been in my cellar for a month!"
"Pours with a nice looking, if not slightly shallow, white head. The color is an appropriate golden/copper and is very clear and appropriately carbonated. Aroma is nicely hoppy, floral and grassy. Slightly sweet malty smell in there as well. Taste is clean and the finish is very crisp. There's a lot of hop flavor, but somewhat light on the hop bitterness. This is a very well balanced, very enjoyable session beer."
"Troegs is a good, solid brewery that doesn't mind playing on the edge."
"Flavor is not a hopheads dream...but the balance is impeccable. Starts off with strong citrus flavors, tangerine, and grapefruit, a full malty middle, and a hoppy finish that has just enough bite. Slightly carbonated in the mouth, but smooth and so easy to drink. I would love to try this on tap. This is a killer Pale Ale, and it has far exceeded my expectations."
"An excellent offering. Orange/beige/deep ruby color with luminous white head. Other reviewers have said it and I agree--tons of grapefruit aromas here, there are other floral notes but they are completely dominated by the grapefruit. Flavor is extremely well balanced. Sweet malts in the back ground but sharp hops up front. Bitter but not puckering and slightly sweet but not 'mouth drying'. Medium body and creamy mouthfeel combine for a good mouthfeel. A good, easy drinking Pale Ale, one of the better I've had in this category."
"Gold/copper in color with a very bubbly white head. Carbonation showed itself with some very fine bubbles constantly streaming to the top of the glass. Fruity and sweet flavors and aromas are dominant. Aroma also showed some pine-like smells. Beer finished slightly bitter, but the bitterness was not very evident in the main body of the beer. Very nice and quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability. The somewhat dry and spicy bitterness at the end keeps you coming back for more."
"Troegs Pale Ale: I was very impressed with this brew, which was shipped as part of Mike Maddens care package. I knew this was something special when the strong and rich aroma hit me as I was pouring the bottle. Off white head (that left a thick lace down the sides of the glass) topped off a clear amber brew. The hops asserted themselves in the aroma, and dominated this very flavorful beer. There were hints of molasses malts, but not much to speak of. All in all this is a very well made beer."
"Upon pouring this pale ale, the first thing I noticed was the smell. Grapefruits greeted me before I even had a chance to pour the bottle. A nice clear, copper color with spare carbonation bubbles filled my glass. The taste was dominated by a subdued hop bitterness, with a nice complement by the fruity esters. Great balance of malt and hop, and the grapefruit scent really adds to the taste experience, too. A very clean, crisp finish with lingering bitterness also adds something to this very good ale. Troegs has produced another fine product in this very drinkable and enjoyable Pale Ale. If it's available, I'm going to consider this next time I stop to get a sixer...perhaps even an entire case."
"A very well crafted Pale Ale. From a brewery that gets better and better."
"Pours to the glass in a goldish color that is crystal clear. The head is nice and large that lasts and it leaves a nice lace behind. The aroma is clean. Has hints of floral, citrus, grass, and malt. The taste is slightly sweet with overtones of citrus and flowers. Also there is a grassy appeal to it as well as hops and malt. Again this is a fresh and clean beer to the end."
"The pour a light crystal clear amber color. Head is frothy, mountainous, the lace lumbersome sheets that last till the end of the glass. Nose is malt, lightly floral, hints of citrus, clean and fresh. Front is malt, ambosial, the top light, the finish meaningfully hopped, thoughtfully acidic, mindfully dry. A quite pleasant beer, just right in all respects, wish I could have been nicer with the lager. Well worth the sample, and wish it was available here in Arizona. Ranks A deserving #484 on my current 1000 beer master list."
"Clear. Deep amber in color with an off-white head that holds well and leaves some nice lace. The aroma is boldly floral & citrusy! Very nice. The body is medium with a moderate carbonation that leaves it smooth and creamy in the mouth. The flavor is rich with a lightly caramel malt sweetness and lots of gentle citrus, floral & grassy hop flavors. Very well balanced with a bitterness that is solid enough to hold the beer in place, but restrained enough to let the sweetness of the malt and depth of the hop flavors come through. Finishes drying with some residual honey-like maltiness and swirls of hop flavor & bitterness. Excellent! A highly enjoyable and extremely drinkable beer with lots of character. Well brewed!"
"The first of many excellent beers from Nerofiddled.  Thank you."
"Ends with a clean crisp finish! Great stuff!"
"Another really nice surprise from these guys. Amber colored, with a really nice full head that stayed for the whole glass. Cascade hops give it the typical floral & citrus APA aroma, but it's nicely balanced by the Belgian malts used in the brew. Taste is also well balanced, with a combination of citrus and a caramel sweetness, with a nice, bitter, refreshing finish. I am now a bona-fide Troegs fan."
"Real nice lace on glass.  I have genuinely like every beer I have tried from Troegs to date.  Try some Troegs if you get the chance.  I have a feeling they may be hard to get outside of PA area though"
"This is a truly great beer.  The cascade hops are well balanced with maltiness in this pale ale.  I like this better than SNPA and I love cascade hopped beers.  Availability is limited to the eastern PA area."
