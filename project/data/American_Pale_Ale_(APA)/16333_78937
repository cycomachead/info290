Spotty lacing left behind as I sip. Smells a bit like a wit style beer, with some spicy herbal hop notes. The taste falls a little flat for my preferences, leaning more towards a strong malt backbone and not enough hops. The mouth feel is right to style for this pale, nice clean finish with a slight hop bite. I would've rated this one higher, but the store owner informed me that this was supposed to be a hoppy pale ale. Not a bad beer at all, just not what I was expecting.","Rizalini","Aug 04, 2014"

Smells floral and citric with some underlying herbal notes. Sweet grains along the back. Taste is similar, with a crisp and refreshing hop bite that spreads herbal flavors and pine out. An underlying grainy sweetness help keep the hops honest. Earthy bitterness sticks to the tongue. The mouthfeel is slick and creamy on the palate with some light crispness that tingles the tongue. This was a nice APA with lots of fresh hop flavors wrapped up in a quite drinkable package. Love the can graphic as well.","Kegatron","Sep 30, 2013"

Regardless, this stuff pours a clear amber-brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises grass, orange peel, light flowers, and a twinge of flaky biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with brighter veins of grass and orange peel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a very nice pale ale, nothing earth-shattering, but definitely something I'm happy to have available around here now.","TMoney2591","0"

Tastes are toasted grain and bready malt coupled with dank, pungent hops, grapefruit rind, caramel, grass, lemon rind, pine - nice balanced complexity. Body is medium, creamy but resiny, bitterness lingers some. Overall, I really enjoyed this one - out of the can or from a glass it's a solid APA either way you drink it!","barnzy78","Jul 02, 2013"

Being that I tried this on a whim from a local bar, my doubts about the up and coming ""micro-can race"" have been subsided for the time being due to this beer.

There is a distinct character here, which may be due to the heavy dose of Galaxy Hops. I don't quite know how to describe it other than bitter fruit, more melon than orchard fruit. This character continues onto the palate. A slight caramel aspect provides some balance, but again the unique hops character dominates. I don't know if I have ever had a beer that tastes quite like this. A pleasant offering from the folks at Tallgrass.","BeardedBoffin","Jan 16, 2013"

Served from can into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Poured a golden yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that remained throughout. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, wild onion, onion hop, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, onion hop, spicy hop, earth, wild onion, and subtle orange zest. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This brew really shocked me as far as all of the elements going on in it. It kind of reminded me of a toned-back Gubna in a way only in Pale Ale form. This is definitely a good thing incase you were wondering… The aromas coming off of this thing smelled intense enough to be an IPA, but still delicate enough to give the hint that it is a Pale Ale. Really well done on this aspect. The flavor was quite nice and refreshing as well with a little bit of spicy hoppiness biting you on the followthrough. Definitely worth your time seeking this one out to try at least once. I’m glad that I did.","thagr81us","May 14, 2012"

The aroma starts with lemon and grass with a bit of bread coming through as it progresses. The flavor is similar to the nose with the addition of some caramel sweetness. The hops balance out the sweetness with a swift bitter finish of citrus and a touch of pine. The body is light to medium with an appropriate level of carbonation.

3.92,3.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Nice APA in a cool looking can. Love the galaxy hops and they really let them shine. The yeast is recognizable from the rest of the line up. Very good overall. The citrus really comes out when warm.","StaveHooks","Beers"
5,32.3,5,5,5,5,5,"This beer pours a slightly hazy bright orange color. The head is a massive two inches in height, and recedes slowly into a firm inch cap of bright white foam. This is one handsome looking beer. The aroma is of stone fruit, passion fruit, tangerines, and flower bed. There is a lot going on in this aroma, and it is also quite strong for the size of this beer. The taste is a bit drier than the aroma leads on, but I am really liking that. There is ample passion fruit and stone fruit with some nice floral notes rounding out the back end. The malt is present, but soft. It supports the hops well, and really lets them shine. There is a nice assertive bitterness in the finish, but it is well integrated into the beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is the best pale ale I've ever drank. I can't see how this beer could possibly be improved on. It is sure to become a regular in my refrigerator.","KarlHungus","0"

3.92,3.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I have been ""experimenting"" with fruity alcopops of late for reasons unbeknown even to me (I hate when my brain starts keeping secrets), but one whiff of this fruity little gem and I knew I was back where I belong. The Crack & Glug was unremarkable and the pour produced just over a finger of fluffy, bone white head with good retention. Color was a hazy orangish-yellow, suggesting a) non-filtering (good) and b) CAN-[CAN]ditioning (better). The nose was tropical fruity and I cheated and looked at a descriptor for Galaxy hops which mentioned ""passionfruit"". I am not sure that I ever ate it or smelled it, so I feel partially unqualified to comment. It was definitely fruity on the nose, however, and in a natural, not chemically-added esters, way. It seemed to just open up like a flower on my tongue! I got an initial sweet fruitiness followed by a rush of grapefruit. Yow! I have a special place in my cooler for Hula In the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually) for something like this. I am planning a trip to the beach this summer with the stated intent of getting me and everyone around me krunked, This will help! Yo, I'm licking my lips like Pac-Man, you hear? Finish was a reminder of why I became a hophead in the first place. Fruity, partially dry with the citrus hops, yummy in my mouth and tummy. I am hereby giving notice - The CANQuest (TM) is back!","woodychandler","Apr 23, 2012"
3.52,-6.9,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Nice mouthfeel: it's lightly sweet and wet, with a soft carbonation tingle. Overall, this is a very solid APA. With a few tweaks it could enter into the conversation of some of the Midwest/Plains best APAs.","Reaper16","Apr 22, 2012"
3.8,0.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall easy drinking, easily sessionable. Will have to seek out a fresher sample to compare, as it seems to be lacking the distinctive tropical/citrus notes of Galaxy hops, but is still solid and well put together.","emerge077","Apr 20, 2012"

3.85,1.9,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Good flavor for a pale ale-starts out with a slight sweetness from the malt but quickly gives way to a fleshy fruit note from the hops and a lingering, but not overpowering, grassy/piny bitter finish. Very drinkable and the body is near-perfection. Crisp, well-carbonated, juicy, medium-thin body. Everything I want in a Pale Ale. Overall, a very well made beer from Tallgrass.
