Some fruity and floral hops on the nose, and crisp bitterness and just enough sweet malty goodness to balance it all out. Nice choice for a lower ABV pale, especially good when looking after 3 kids on the ride home! Can't wait to try more FFF!","Mikus","Sep 28, 2014"

Taste is much the same with citrus fruit, citrus zest, and slight herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip.

This one is comparable in quality and taste to SNPA, though this one has a slightly thinner body in my opinion, and is just slightly darker.

Pretty good for such a small brew. The taste is very good as well, lots of citrus and tropical notes. It's also very balanced, the malt picks up right after the hops. Mouthfeel is incredibly light, this could be one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. As far as session beers goes, this one is hard to beat. Except for the price of course and the fact that I have to drive 40 mins away to maybe find it. Other than that, this is one of the best session beers I've had.","screamking","Oct 25, 2013"

I have trouble detecting a distinct smell but the feel and taste are satisfying. Tastes a lot better than it looks. A tame but nicely balanced beer. It's the kind of beer I would have loved 20 years ago when I was transitioning from Rolling Rock to craft beer.

Nose Slight grassy notes with floral teases. Hops present but not hugely noticeable. Taste quite mild with a touch of hop and dry finish. Delivers exactly what's advertised here very mild with a hop punch and surprisingly floral. More like fresh hop water following the lead of concur water with a hint of bitter elderflower. Medium bodied with a dry finish which makes new any more and more. Overall, a great session and first beer at dinner. I am not sure if all of the dipa and iipas I have had are taking a till on my palate but I truly am enjoying these session pales. Cheers.","AndyP612","May 14, 2013"

Similar in the taste but there's a nice sweetness reminiscent of raw wildflower honey. A bit of malt shows up in both aroma and flavor to give it a bit of balance. Still hop forward. And let's be honest. This isn't a mild. Its another hoppy APA that happens to have a low %ABV and IBU count. There's an interesting earthy and grassy quality to the finish. In summary, pretty sweet and sugary with lots of fruity hops. Almost too sweet and a bit cloying during certain sips. Otherwise easy drinking and delicious.","Gatch","Apr 26, 2013"

Through the aroma, flavoring, and feel, this guy sits very much in the same vein as Three Floyds’ other pale ales, but just a bit more toned down, seemingly for the purpose of easing and enhancing drinkability via lightness. The hops remained very fresh, but the grains cheapened up, giving more adjuncts and corn. The nose, too, is interesting sweaty and plastic, but doesn’t change the fact that this is an easy drinking, refreshing offering.","TheBrewo","Apr 17, 2013"

A fairly easygoing ale with slightly lower levels of hop bitterness and slightly higher levels of malt than you'd see in a typical APA - though I'd say it still is rather too forceful to really be a session ale - hop heads sure to disagree. Unfortunately, it didn't really add up to anything too exciting for me. Great brewery, but this is my least favorite brew of theirs so far.","elchingen","Feb 18, 2013"

It's hard for me to describe how this one tastes, but it's just like a gritty, malty, cereal flavor that keeps making me come back for another sip. The bitterness is there, but it's, like the style claims to be, mild. This may be called a mild ale, but it's really not as mild as one would think... a fantastic hop nose, with a delicious flavor.

4.2,8.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating, but was purchased recently. Pours a very hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fluffy white head with excellent retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation as well. Aromas of big orange zest, grapefruit, pineapple, bread, floral, light pine, grass, and light citrus rind. Damn nice aromas with nice hop complexity and balance. Taste of orange zest, pine, grapefruit, caramel, bread, floral, grass, and light citrus rind. Good amount of grassy citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, pine, caramel, bread, grass, floral, and citrus rind on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic hop flavor complexity and balance; with a solid malt backbone; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent pale ale! Great hop flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth to drink as expected. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 08, 2012"

It's somewhere between a typical APA and IPA, but for me it hits that lightly-hoppy sweet spot better than other top-rated ""APAs"" (like Alpha King and Daisy Cutter) thanks to a lower bitterness, better balance, and more positive hop characteristics.","zeledonia","Feb 28, 2012"

In the flavor, very mild with a crisp grainy flavor, some mild pine and citrus, and a touch of sweet bread. Pretty one note but decent at that. Hop flavor is delicate and leafy, with the faintest touch of fruit, mostly muted. One of the mildest beers I've encountered, Pride and Joy goes down like water. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a crisp carbonation. No offensive flavors at all, this would be suitable for even the most casual beer drinker. Still, tasty enough to be considered a fine beer, just a light one. Light body, solid carbonation. Overall, a decent pale mild and one I was glad to try.","Stinkypuss","Jan 19, 2012"

Very tasty for the style. Feel is very smooth, with the malt taking over, and good carbonation. Very easy to drink session beer. Overall, I'm starting to realize the amazing ability of FFF to create wonderful beers in 'lighter' styles. This would be a go to session brew if I got it in my area.

Small notches down the side. Smell is very fruity with bubblegum, orange peel, tangerine and a small mild maltiness, that is barely a whimper. Taste is very light yet bold with citrus and small malt droppings. Not sure if there is any English essence/ingredients in here as i read it on the bottle, but from the taste I would say no. Feel is light and refreshing with a rip from the carb, not dead and inviting. A nice bitterness mid palate. Real easy drinking here. The low ABV and the feel make this a no brainer for the summertime. Unfortunatly I wont be seeing it again.","BARFLYB","Dec 31, 2011"

I would say the aroma is rather mild with some subtle notes of citrus and light biscuit. Maybe a little honey like aroma as well. Light citrus sweet notes up front with some lingering bitterness.

It smells of honey, bready malt, light citrus, and had a faint amarillo esque tinge to start things off. Maybe I'm just anticipating my next Gumballhead, I don't know. If I had to describe it, I'd call it a hoppy ESB based purely on the aromas. Very interesting to say the least. The flavors consist of smooth, slightly sweet malts and a soft and vibrant piny hop presence. It has really nice flavor and is very well constructed. The flavors work in near perfect unison. It finishes clean and drinks pretty light. It is very, very sessionable. Overall this beer is quite solid.

It's sort of like a baby sister to AK, a less hoppy and lighter pale ale. If you judge this as basically being that sort of brew, a light beer version of their flagship, it's a shining success.

Mouthfeel is pleasant and refreshing with an apprpriate level of carbonation. As a more accomplished reviewer has noted earlier, this is not at all a true English mild ale. It is much closer to an American pale ale. Given 3f's penchant for pushing the hops however, it might fairly be described as ""mild"" by their standards.

Not much effervescence, head turns into a thin lacey bit. Smell is a big floral smack of lemony/lime/grapefruit hops and candied malts, like Alpha king but less dank and resinous, easier on the nose is how I'd put it. Taste is citric hop, more lemon, less grapefruit and some balance from a lightly toasty malt, never overly sweet or too rich. This beer is quite balanced, far more than Alpha King, which is great, don't get me wrong, but THIS is the APA, that is definitely an IPA, both not normal! Anyway, mouthfeel is rich and full but never overwhelming and though technically not a session beer, I could definitely learn to like more of these. Pride and Joy is highly drinkable with a refreshingly large dose of citric hops that makes this a great break from all the big bold APA's and IPA out there.","Star80","Nov 22, 2010"

On the nose the primary notes are grapefruit and a distant pine, but nothing jumps out as very assertive. In the mouth the grapefruit combines with a forward breadiness, with the pine riding on a long wave of carbonation further back.

3.41,-12.1,4,3,3,3.5,4.5,"Pride & Joy from Three Floyds is a very drinkable beer that falls victim to being difficult categorize. 3F wants to call it an American Mild, a sessionable ale brewed with American hops. The beer is a solid amber with little head and aroma. There is just a twinge of tangerine aroma, but not much other than that. The malt is restrained as well in the taste with just a little caramel and graininess. Again the hops are just barely there. I wish there was more hops, malt, flavor, aroma, which in some respects, keeps me drinking more. A good sessionable mild, but not a great pale ale.","Soonami","Nov 08, 2010"

Anyway, it pours a clear copper-amber topped by a surprising half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises a mountain of cascade hops, some pine needles, and a light undercurrent of caramel. The taste holds notes of greens, flowers, light orange peel, and an even more reserved undertow of caramel. The body is medium, with no really detectable carbonation and a relatively smooth feel. Overall, a very nice pale, one that seems to benefit from cask-conditioning (and I suspect some dry-hopping involved as well).","TMoney2591","Oct 31, 2010"
3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer pours a thin head attached to an orange amber body. The smell is definitely of leafy hops, lemon, orange, and coriander. The flavor is smooth on cask. The bitterness of the hops seems rather highly dry hopped. This is balanced by the backing flavor of some sweet bready malts. I also believe I tasted perhaps a hint of nutmeg in the flavor. This has a nice creamy viscosity to it on cask and is rather smooth and pleasant. It's an easy drinking beer, and comes recommended from me.","Vdubb86","Oct 30, 2010"

A bit of a piney scent as well. The taste is not what I expected. Possibly some un-American hops used in this one. I get a taste in this beer that I can't really put my finger on...I wish I had more of this so I could figure out what it is. It is pretty delicious though. Not as hoppy as its scent, but definitely got somethin special goin on here. Possibly some sort of herbs and spices.

3.56,-8.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A clear copper color with a massive dense white head that sticks around and leaves incredible lacing. Looks really nice to me. The smell is just pure resinous hops. Not much of a malty presence at all in the nose...maybe I'll have to wait to smell it once the head dies down a bit, but I expect to be able to detect some sweetness. The first thing I notice in the taste are the moderate to medium esters. It dominates the hops somewhat in the flavor department. Maybe this only had a heavy dose of dry-hopping - maybe move some back to flavor. There's also a spicy herbal flavor, which provides a very dry tartness, next to some chalky, powdery flavors. This is the first time I've actually noticed what is called 'soapiness' in a beer - I can taste it here, like hand soap or something, though it's not incredibly prominent. The malt is toasty and crackery at best, though I kind of expected bready and sweet to back this up. The hop flavors finally return in the finish. The mouthfeel is actually pretty good, but not great. It's a bit light bodied, and dry, but occasionally feels kind of full because of the creamy head. The drink is kind of slow, but good. A nice and enjoyable beer, kind of middle of the range in ABV. This is probably not the best of 3F's work, but still quite better than many beers of the same style (though this kind of defies complete classification - the bottle says mild, here says APA, kind of fits in both).","taylorhamrick","Jun 27, 2009"

It's no thing though, as people can get a little caught up in that stuff and forget about the beer itself. End soap box. Tastes of more citrus hops (slightly sour grapefruit and orange zest) with some chalkiness going down. The malts hover underneath, and perform their balancing duties well.

I honestly wish there were more brews like this out there and readily available. Light amber in appearance with a nice head. Just enough hops here to keep you interested while keeping perfect balance. The bitterness from the hops is more dusty, spicy, and earthy rather than the typical American citrus hop flavor, though you can tell there is still a nice state-side influence on what is typically an English beer style.

4.12,6.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a bright, slightly hazy golden orange with a very small bubbly head that subsides quickly to a ring leaving a bit of lacing. The smell is a nice balace of hops, citrus and floral, and a bready malt backbone. The taste is initially a blast of light citrus, mainly lemon zest and oranges. This gives way to some caramel and sweet bready malts before a slight hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is super refreshing with a very crisp, clean finish. This is a supremely drinkable and well-balanced pale ale and would make a good summer staple.","gford217","Jul 20, 2008"

Nice piney/citric finish that leaves a pleasing aftertaste. Quite good stuff and like I said, easy drinking and the head retention and lacing were more than adequate.

Good head retention that eventually settled into a quarter-inch, consistent cap. Bands of sticky, concentric half moon rings of lacing present during the session. Scent of hops and a mild citrus essence. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a light biscuity quality. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a slight burn across the tip of the tongue and some hops bitterness at the back. Nice brew. Actually reminded me of a more subdued version of Roxy Rolles.","Jwale73","Jul 10, 2008"

A bit of toasty malts are noted, not quite biscuity, but with a caramel like toasted character. On the palate, the hops have nearly dissapeared, and the malts, while not overly characterful like they should be in a mild, take the bulk of the flavor. Interestingly, this beer is WAY over carbonated to giving you quite a bite and drying the finish out too much. I don't think it's infected, but there's something seriously wrong with the carbonation level. Given that, it really hurts the drinkability.","dreadnatty08","Apr 25, 2008"

Surrounded by a endless high-alcohol beers it can be something of a relief to drink a lighter style. This is redolent of a ligher English bitter, muted hop bitterness and quite dry.

The flavors reprise the aroma with the addition of marmalade and a hint of caramel malt. Just a tad lighter than medium body. Finish of yeast, dough, and citrus peel.

The flavors are dominated by an English hop aroma (earthy, grassy) and with a medium malt character that struggles to counter the hops.

Was a hazy golden color with little bits of yeast floating around. Had a good head that settled into a wispy film. A little lacing. The aroma was citric hops with malts in the back. I agree with others that it reminds you more of a pale ale than a mild ale. The taste was pretty good and tastes like a slightly watered down pale ale. It doesn't have a real standout taste but is a good session beer when you want a little more flavor than a standard session. Mouthfeel was light and carby - good mix. Overall, a good average beer that is worth trying. Not avail here so won't be a player in my rotation. But if avail, it would be worth a 6ixer or two every year for variety.

Mandarin orange and a little lemon sourness to round it off. More complex than the average ""Mild Ale"". Mouthfeel is fairly thin, and carbonation isn't overbearing in the mouth. Slightly drying finish, but not extremely so. This is drinkable to a T. My final verdict on this is that it's much like a watered down Alpha King, it has a lot of the same flavours, but they're much more muted. A well made ale, but it dosen't take it to the next level. That's what the rest of the Three Floyds lineup is for.","trevorwideman","Jun 03, 2007"

Very similar to a single orgin coffee from El Salvador. The citrus resembles more of a quaint grapefruit or a tangerine than a lemon, but really sizzles on the tongue. The glass looks great throughout drinking. Bubbles from the bottom, and lacing continues until the end. I really like this beer. I have been liking a lot of area beers lately.

Not even white bubbles acting as the lace. That would have been better than nothing at all. Very disappointing appearance. The smell was no better than the appearance. To get the slightest aroma to emerge, I had to swirl the beer around for a couple of minutes for anything to come out. Even then it wasn't that good. The aroma was that of citrus hops, a lemon peel, toasted malts, and a pinch of English toffee in the back. To get a whiff of the toffee, you really need to stick your nose into it and even then you might not catch it. Where it matters most of all is where this beer finally came out. The taste was mild and slightly dry with a slice of grapefruit, toasted malts, a few more citrus fruits, and with a mild punch of bitter citrus hops in the background. The mouthfeel was light, but yet it had a nice aftertaste of dry roasted bitter citrus hops. I noticed that toward the end of the mouthfeel, it got somewhat watery. Not too watery, but I still noticed it was there. They label this as a ""classic session ale."" I guess you could make this a reasonably priced Three Floyds session ale, but I wouldn't.

More citrus in the taste, a little stronger but still far from overpowering, accompanied by a moderate, bready malt presence. It has a medium-thin body, lightly crisp yet fairly smooth texture and soft carbonation. This beer is super easy-drinking.

A refreshing sweet taste up front, fruity with strawberries the middle leaves way to more of a tangy citrus zest. The finish hits you with a nice mild hop kick. Not bad, a very solid offering. The mouthfeel is nice, full and creamy, with a tingle of trapped carbonation on the tounge and cheek. This is a very drinkable beer, sans hop kick this is mass marketable, with the hop kick it makes for a sessionable beer destine for garage fridges the BA world over (or at least in the Mid-West).

Overall not very mild in any respect except the alcohol content, and I'm fairly sure it's not what an English mild should be even though this is my first example of the style.

The grapefruit rind from the hops melds well with the malt (in the form of dark carmel) to provide a pleasant flavor. The finish is all hops. Its amazing that this beer passes as a mild. Its more of an IPA. Of course all 3F beers go over the top on the hops, but I do enjoy them. The mouth feel is slick and refreshing. Great drinkability.

I do have a small foamy cap currently poised on top of my beer. It looks like it is planning to stick around and it is also giving off some decent lace. The nose holds a nice juicy hop character. Smells predominantly of lemon. The malt character is overshadowed by this hop influence, as both are mild as expected with the malt being more contained off the sniff. The hop character is much more active. It smells really pleasing. I couldn't imagine anyone not enjoying a little whiff of this one. The taste is so easy. This really is a perfect sessioner. It has a nice bit of sweetness and the lemony citrus of hops, but on a more universally appealing scale. A bit of yeasty influence rides along with the lightly proportioned malt backdrop. I can easily envision driving around on a riding lawnmower in the heat with a glass of this in my hand. My mom might even enjoy it. Mild is a perfect description and style classification.

Taste starts with pale malt sweetness, giving way to the pine and citrus notes of the hops. Well balanced, with a lean ot the hops, but not to its detriment.

Very hoppy aroma with notes of citric grapefruit and there's a nutty yeast note in there as well. Taste has more citric bitterness from the hops and the grapefruit goes away. Sweet english toffee and lightly roasted nuts underneath the initial alpha acid assault. Finish is dry and lingering in hop bitterness but its soft as well.

How did it take me 3 beers into the night to see that this was there? It poured a deep amber color with 2 fingers of head, full of large bubbles, that fell to coat the beer. The nose was a nice blend of grapefruity hop and a slight chewy bubblygum. It was slightly crisp, but smelld divine. Cask conditioning this beer took it to places that I didn't know existed. The flavor was mellow. A great blend of the grapefruit hop and the caramel sweetness. This is what I will hold all mild ales up against in flavor. It was mild, yet so full of flavor. The feel was so smooth and silky, with just a bare minimum of carbonation to keep it true. I thought that this beer was fantastic.

Light-bodied and surprisingly crisp, with a moderately bitter amount of hops throughout. Underlying sweetness and citrus flavors make this simply one of the best session ales I have ever had.

This is one hop heavy mild all around and I am loving it. Aftertaste is a hoppy bitter one that is a bit grassy and floral. Mouthfeel is fairly light and crisp.

Not much to speak of in the way of malt to balance this brew out just a bit of malty notes in the middle before more piney hop finish. However, this is pretty much what i would have expected from 3F's Mouthfeel is good. The hoppyness never gets harsh or overbearing.

3.75,-3.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Anyway, I let this one get well into cellar temperature before I cracked it for a more authentic mild experience. The body is a copper-hued amber with very light carbonation moving through it. The head is robust and rolls up quickly causing me to halt the pour on several occasions, it retains nicely though and leaves fat, sticky clumps of lace on the glass. The aroma is hoppy as hell! Not quite what I was expecting for a mild, juicy citrussy hops with a faint malt backbone. Honestly, Ive smelled IPAs with less hops and definitely American Pale Ales, so this level of PacNW hops on the nose tells me this isnt a typical Mild. Drinking this beer leaves me a little bewildered. I love hops just as much as the next guy, but here, its almost like the malt is recognized for a millisecond, and is then ambushed and totally eclipsed by hop flavor. Dont get me wrong, the flavors are delicious but I get no sense of balance here what-so-ever, and normally I need my hops to at least pretend to be balanced by malt, or alcohol, or both preferably. Adding to this the mouthfeel is incredibly light, it goes down almost like water, brings to mind the phrase hop tea. I guess the term Mild is in reference to the alcohol content which is low that makes this a drink-all-day sessioner. A good beer, it will satisfy your craving for hops and you can sip on it forever without getting out of hand, but dont come here looking for balance.","FormatKid","Dec 03, 2004"

I get notes of apricot, ruby-red grapefruit, tangerine and orange. The taste is initially sweet up front, but then moves to a fairly dry finish. Throughout though it is a hop lovers dream. This beer is about as far from a mild as possible, it could easily pass for a supped up pale ale though. I am not quite too sure what to think of this beer, it is certainly by no definition a Mild Ale, but it certainly is what I expect Three Floyds to brew as their mild. I am certainly enjoying the in your face citrus fruit notes, but I wish that there was some of that malty complexity that one gets from a traditional Mild Ale.

Minimal thin strings and spots of lace. Aroma is quite nice for a mild, cuz its mild but with a pleasant amount of strength, both a nice fresh dried and leafy hop balances well with a deep sweet bready maltyness. Nose includes nice light fruityness, kinda dull and maybe musty/old citrus with a heavy frothy barley sweetness. Reminds me of a Vienna, Alt, or sweeter Red, but whatever, its a fantastic nose for a mild. Taste is mild as well but has a nice strength in its presence that seems to carry over from the aroma. Great maltyness, breadish, thick, hardy, almost chewy to a point, lightly sour of bagel dough with some nice touches of dullish fruity sweetness and notes of nuttyness and butter. Hops enter in very lightly at the finish with nice notes of dried leafyness and a perfect little blend of bittering thats a bit grassy very late in the finish. Never overbearing in any way, seems to always peak at just the right moment as to keep the mildness in both the palate and flavors but keeps its brawny demeanor. Wonderful. Feel is heavenly smooth, kinda fluffy in texture with a close to medium body and a grand easy carbonation that just floats down the gullet. I haven't had many true Mild Ales, and I'm thinking this may be over the top as far as the English versions are concerned, but with that aside this stuff blew my socks off for a Mild.

2.45,-36.9,3,3,2,2.5,2.5,"On a whole, I was disappointed with this offering from Three Floyds. The taste was out of balance and the feel was not too pleasing, either. Maybe it was poorly stored or old but Im not in any hurry to find another for comparison.","Boilermaker88","Nov 07, 2003"
3.25,-16.2,3,3,3,3.5,4,"This brew pours a thin dirty white head along with an opaque orangish brown body. As expected, it is lightly carbonated and the flavor and aroma are absent of hops. This is a very easy drinking beer with a slightly tart taste on the tongue. You can see having a few of these with your friends down at a pub.","jcalabre","Oct 31, 2003"

3.95,1.8,4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Thick looking, hazy dark honey color with an off-white head the settles a bit, but leaves a quarter inch of thick foam. Smell is sweet of malt, plus some butterscotch and honey. Smooth mouthfeel delivers a malty flavor with hints of dough and honey, with a slight citrus tingle in the finish. I notice no hops, but the flavor is round and balanced. This is very drinkable.","far333","Sep 23, 2003"
4.52,16.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a clear deep amber color with two fingers of head. There are nice lace rings left after each sip. The smell has both malty caramel and hop aromas. Overall it is a fairly sweet smell. The taste has some caramel and hazelnut at first, then ends with a beautiful hops balance. One of the most balanced brews I've ever had. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, and this beer is very smooth. The drinkability is also fantastic. I'll definately be buying more of this!","SheepNutz","Sep 01, 2003"
4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"This mild ale pours an apricot/orange hue with a thinning, bubbly off-white head that that looks great while leaving minor trails of lace down the pint glass. The aroma is biscuity with some pronounced citric hoppiness. Taste-wise, this brew is mildly hoppy, quite biscuity/malty with a lingering caramel malt finish. It's quite British in nature with a pronounced American hop profile. Very interesting mild ale, to be sure. It's smooth, medium-bodied and finishes quite clean. A perfect session ale for hop heads, this is an easy drinking, low abv ale. Certainly a Three Floyds take on an underappreciated style. Very well done for a low gravity brew.","Jon","Jul 30, 2003"
3.14,-19.1,4,2.5,3,3,4,"I was sort of confused as to why 3 Floyds would make a style that calls for very little hops. They seem to revel in the plant. Pours a nice rich brown, with a pleasing khaki head. Aroma is way too hoppy. You can smell the hops, for starters. Malts smell right, but are overwhelmed by the floral hoppiness. Flavor is also off. Way, way too much hops. Mild roastiness and some bittersweet bready flavors. It irritates me that these guys just overhop everything, like it's a source of pride. Carbonation is way too high, hops are mellow for 3 Floyds, but still way too high for this style. They should have called it an american brown ale, because that's what it is. I rated the drinkability higher, because it is a good beer, but i was hoping for and expecting a smooth english mild.","UnionMade","Jul 28, 2003"
4.15,7,3.5,3.5,4,5,5,"This is a perfect beer for ""multiple"" tastings. A slight hop flavor of Three Floyds that is expected. Definitely Three Floyds version of a typical British Mild. A good hop flavor with a nice balanced malt finish. Definitely drinkable, ridiculously flavorful for such a mild beer, Find it, love it, share it. Nick Floyd for President.","Jables","Jun 20, 2003"

Tastes mild, with a bit of hops. Sweetness--probably from the citrus--can be felt on the tip of the tongue. A very drinkable beer (especially in the summer months) that feels very smooth and light. Not an exceptional beer, but definitely one I will drink again.","tar","May 20, 2003"
3.2,-17.5,3,3,3,3,4,"Three Floyds Pride & Joy: Copper color, nice head, with a good stickiness. The aroma is nice, oranges, or at least a hint of the Florida fruit. Wow, this is a nice beer, but cripes it is as unremarkable a brew as I’ve seen lately. In other words, its got good taste, but there were five of us sitting there and not one could come up with a better description than it tastes like “beer.” After much effort, we concluded that there was some caramel malts, but this beer is balanced with a passion. Its good, but I can’t explain why.","jackndan","Apr 25, 2003"
4.35,12.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12 oz brown bottle. This one depicts a joker with a beer popping out of his hat. Cool. Medium golden dark color. Sticky rocky off-white head. Huge hop filled bubbles pop through. Fresh hop aromas. Taste is decidly hop filled, sticky and rich on smooth sweet creamy malt presence. Almost oily, resin like hop feel. Sticky and syrupy all in one taste. Very good and highly hoped. Medium to light bodied, not much carbonation, the hops seem to do the trick. Very drinkable, easy going down. Another beer I would have guessed was an IPA.","StevieW","Apr 13, 2003"
3.9,0.5,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This beer was a surprise, and not at all what I expected. A mild pale ale...so I expected the predominant flavor to be hops. Oh no. This beer had a high degree of maltiness, a candy-like butterscotch malt flavor. Very light brown in color, with malt and caramel aromas. I liked this beer, but nothing stood out a whole lot to me. Needs more hop flavor to balance things out. Still a good brew, just one I wouldnt want more than one at a time of. Boy is my grammar bad.","IrishRedRock","Apr 13, 2003"
3.25,-16.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Light amber color with a light tan head that started nice but was gone quickly, with not much lacing. Smell was of ripe fruits and a sweet and syrupy lingering aroma. This ale was rather mild in terms of hop taste almost to mild. Had a more malty caramel sweet character than anything else. Overall a decent beer but nothing to go write home about. As for a session beer the extra low carbonation and syrupy sweetness would grow tiresome for me after a few.","OatmattStout","Mar 10, 2003"
4.05,4.4,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Big, creamy head; copper color. Aroma: fresh, slightly spicy, soft, faintly herbal, some lemon zest. Taste:tangy, but smooth, quite mild, but more character and flavor than other session ale types I've tried recently. I could drink a lot of this, if I didn't care too much about variety, etc. Unfortunately, I like to drink quality, exciting brews, and a diversity of them. So I ask: why can't the discriminating session beer drinker, the party giver, the softball player, turn to this instead of Bud Light?","feloniousmonk","Dec 18, 2002"
3.14,-19.1,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Color is a hazy brownish orange with an off-white head that's about 1 finger thick. Aroma was quite interesting-- a combination of hops, grapefruit and madarin orange. Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel. Citrusy, hoppy middle. Creamy finish with a lemony hop bitterness to it. Combo of citrus and hop are good, yet at times a little too bitter and sour. I think this would be a more refreshing beer in summer than in winter when I sampled it.","Winter","Dec 05, 2002"
4.12,6.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Not a mild. Maybe ""mild"" in relation to Floyd's other beers, but actually more like a bitter or even a pale ale. Still very good, citric hops in initial bite, caramel comes on strong and finish is soothing and sweet. Full, creamy, and lots of intrigue with Floyd's trademark hop profile. Lemony. Like an Alpha King scaled down, and perhaps a better session choice considering AK's octane.","Thrasher","Nov 07, 2002"
3.81,-1.8,4,3,4,3.5,4.5,"This is a great example of a highly drinkable session ale.   Light bodied.  Has a crisp taste that balances oh so citrusy hops with dry, hide and seek maltiness.   Try one on your late morning coffee break instead of coffee.","yemenmocha","Oct 24, 2002"
3.92,1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pride & Joy is a light bodied Mild Ale that pour to a nice amber color with a off-white head that quickly dissipates.  It has a light citrus hop aroma, balanced by a light malt aroma.  At first taste there is a subtle maltiness, then a bit of citric hoppiness.  It finishes with a slight sweetness.  Overall it is a light, refreshing well-balanced beer.","BeerBuilder","Oct 24, 2002"
3.9,0.5,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This beer was a medium amber color and formed a nice white head that left some lace.  There was definate aroma hops, but not overpowering, and also of malt.  The taste of caramel whic gave it some slight sweetness, as well as the hops and malt were present.  Definate hops prescense, but not again, not overpowering.  A good summer beer.","Wildman","Jul 01, 2002"

'Biscuity' aroma with hints of caramel and a strong presence of citrus hops.  Well-balanced flavor:  sweet caramel malt blends wonderfully with the bitter, citrus hops for a smooth taste.  Slight metallic tang on the finish.  Slightly oily, with a bit of lingering carbonation make this brew a lively thirst-quencher.  Excellent session brew!","Viking","Jun 24, 2002"

Pretty good, but won't hurry to get more.","John","May 15, 2002"
3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a golden amber with a thick chunky head on it.  There are mild malt and hop smells to this beer.  Nice mild malt profile that is balanced by a hop presence that is far stronger than I would have expected for this style.  It is creamy and smooth on the tongue and nicely drinkable.  I like this beer.  Not as much as some others from this brewery but enough to definitely buy it again.  This would be a very nice session brew for transition weather.  You know, when it is too warm to be spring but not quite warm enough to be summer, it would also fit in nicely in the fall.","Murph","Apr 12, 2002"
