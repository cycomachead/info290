"O: [3.75] Really nice beer.  This was my first Hill Farmstead beer.  Maybe I was expecting unicorns with rainbows shooting out of them.  But this didn't totally blow me away.  This was a solid beer but did not overwhelm me."
"Amazingly flavorful for the ABV. Sessionable and satisfying."

"On tap at the Worthy Burger. Despite living in neighboring NH, I've been waiting a long time for this. A cloudy pumpkin pour with a thick frothy head that died down quickly, but left excellent lacing throughout the glass. An almost smokey hoppiness on the nose. Big herbal fruity hop flavor; how did they pack all that in an Pale Ale? A strong bitter pop, especially late. The carbonation seems right on, and there is a creaminess to this one, a pleasure to drink. I often forgot I wasn't drinking an IPA because it left me wanting nothing more, like some APAs can. With the possible exception of Zombie Dust (boy would I love to test them side-by-side!) this is easily the best APA I've tasted."

"Edward took the top spot for APAs for me. I love the Stoneface and Peeper...  but have to put this higher in the pecking order of APAs. I feel bad... had this after an Abner... and didn't get to really clean out my taste buds before this one. At a low 5% with the flavor you get... outstanding. EFB just has the magic touch... but like all their brews... just so hard to get your hands on... which in my opinion... goes to my sense of ""feel."""
"Hazy opague amber orange much like Abner and similar fruitiness but with a much much lighter mouthfeel.  Unlike any other pale ales that I've had and very very VERY crushable and enjoyable.  Nose of any and all citrus fruits (particularly orange and mango).  Great beer to pair with food as it's so light in texture yet rustic and flavorful.  This is a all day on a boat in the hot sun kind of beer at 5.2% and one of the best pales I've ever had.  I'd put the Fort Point Pales from Trillium ahead of this but otherwise it's right up there."

"O:  This is one kick ass pale ale, probably the best I have ever had.  There is a reason this is the ""grandaddy"" of HF, it is deserving.  Everything you want in a pale ale, and even more.  This beer is a thing of beauty.  Awesome."

"A little too hazy for a pale and a little too heavy on the mouthfeel for a pale but a great beer. I feel like I would have given a higher rating if this was classified as an American IPA."

"Straight up orange colored beer with a big off white head (even out of the growler). Aroma is like a floral bouquet with light citrus and pine. Malts hold up well. Nice delicate mix. Flavor is sweet and sharply citrus initially, twhen turns to spicy and herbal. A lot of deliciousness to take in. Texture is smooth but loaded with prickly carbonation, subtle dryness, and slight hop resin grittiness. This is a great beer to have a growler of. It's got a distinct Hill Farmstead taste to it. Very fresh, hoppy, herbal, and spicy. A very likable beer."

"Growler Nov 14 2014. Beautiful color with firm head. Moderate citrus aroma. Just the right amount of hop bitterness for an APA. Enjoyed immensely."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at the brewery. Aromas of clean grapefruit, citrus, pine, white peach, full growing bitterness. Aromas of strong C-hops, with a really nice clean malt profile and bitterness. Delicious, mouthfeel is really full with a moderate carbonation. Very well balanced and a beer I will certainly look forward to having in the future."

"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, excellent representation of style, this is a great beer to pound down for a very long time."
""

"Hill Farmstead makes absurdly clean beers. That being said, this is one of the cleanest, which really shines in an American Pale Ale. Worth the drive."
"Wow! Super drinkable! Light, crisp, and citrusy. Superb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edward is just about the perfect Pale Ale. I'd need to drink more of it, and drink it side by side with Trillium Fort Point and Zombie Dust to say which one i like the best, but you really can't go wrong with any of those three APAs."

"Pours a hazed orange color with a white head. Aroma is piney and full of tropical fruits. The taste is also tropical, lots of pith, pine, pineapple, papaya. The taste is very fruity and hoppy. Nice pine, resin, mild tropical punch, light citrus. Refreshing take on a pale. Light body, light to medium carbonation, slightly drying hop finish. Overall, this is a great brew, thx to K0IZ for the pickup."

"O: Easily one of the best American Pale Ales I've had. It has more hop flavor than most IPAs, but with a great balance of bitterness and malt. It is a lot more dry than it is sweet, but I think it's a perfect balance of sugar. Crazy good crisp finish with a really pleasant lingering aftertaste."

"Overall great beer excited to try more from this brewery."
""
"Big slightly off white head settles to a cap atop the beer and provides ample lacing that sticks. Big citrus orange, grapefruit and pine in the nose. Taste follows with citrus, mainly orange, and a piney resinous finish that is quite bitter for a pale ale. Slick mouthfeel coats the palate then in a flash goes away clean with a drying bitter finish. IPA like medium body is nice. Overall an amazing pale ale that delivers IPA mouthfeel and big flavor."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a nice yellow pale color. It is a bit cloudy. Doesn't have much foam, although a head was formed but dissipated quickly. Aroma is of distinct hops. Taste is hoppy, great for those that are not looking for a piney IPA. This growler tasted a bit watery. Mouth feel is light."
"he pour is a reddish orange gold with a thinner white head that leaves a beautiful lace on the brewery tulip. The aroma is incredible. Citrusy hops, with a grapefruit character and a tropical fruitiness to it. Maybe a light piny sensation on the back end. The flavor is so similar. The hoppiness is heavy, but there isn't a overbearing bitterness. The fruitiness and light sweetness at the end is delightful. The mouth feel is almost perfect, and the dryness at the end is outstanding for an APA"

"Not sure why this is considered a Pale Ale. So darn hoppy, it really should be an IPA! But really, that doesn't matter. What does matter, is this beer's awesomeness. Taste is out of this world. Fruity, with notes of mango, citrus and even some strawberry. Piney, bitter, and dank as well! And so drinkable, it's scary. Try this stuff. ASAP!"

"Fresh growler from Joe. HUGE thanks! Shared with Pops. Pours slightly hazy golden color with a small fluffy white head. Beautiful aroma of fresh hop pellets, grass, hay, lightly sweet malts, very light citrus peel. Incredibly light bodied and fresh hops, sweet citrus and malt finish. Super easy drinking, medium carbonation, crisp and clean finish. Just awesome. My first HF experience and it is an excellent one."

"o; Great as a top flight American Pale Ale or DIPA. Deliciously citrusy with 85 IBUs to let you know it means business. A new favorite for sure, another reaffirmation that it was worth all the extra driving (3 hours round trip from Waitsfield) and line standing (an hour and a quarter, which I understand is about half of normal for a Saturday!) and money ($86 for 5.75 total liters or about $5.50 per 12 ounces including $19 for bottles) to get Hill Farmstead brews. Edward's relatively low ABV could make it the best session Pale Ale in existence."

"Poured the color of grapefruit juice. Golden hazy and with a slight orange blush on it. Fat creamy head of white foam that lasted well and left lace. This beer smells floral and fruity. Lovely light citrus, pineapple and mango for intense sweetness. Earthy pine that is not heavy and does not stand out past the other scents. The malt on this nose is a light sweet perfume. So wonderful how all Hill's beer has this quality of lightness both in the nose and in the drink. I think if I had to summarize Hill's trademark as a brewer I would do it like this - He is trying to put the hops in the beer and leave them on the vine at the same time. He has a way with hops and in this beer they are so fruity and yet so light on the palate. That's his other trademark, the light malt that is so light it's like the beer wants to just float out of the glass. Crisp, light sweetness like a floral nectar, a bit of light sweet cracker that has exactly the perfect balance. The beer has a resonance rather than an aftertaste and it's light floral and fruitiness. As the beer warms some sweet grass and pine comes forward and this is just a lovely beer."

"Notes: Bottled on 4/9/14 and drank on the suggest serve by date of 4/17/14. Served from a 2L HF growler."
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable, with subtle flavors and nice balance between hops and malt. That being said, there are probably half a dozen beers as good as this that I could buy off the shelf or trade for much more easily."
"O: Just another hit via the genius that is Hill Farmstead!"
""
""
""
""
"Fresh from the growler filled today. Always get Edward whenever I can on tap in vt, have never gotten a growler to bring home. Always overlook it because of the great double ipas. Poured in my HF tulip. Murky, bright gold, nice two finger head, sticks around for a bit. Great lacing on the glass. Smells so fresh. Juicy. Citrus mostly, small amount of grassy pine. The taste is very crisp. Lots of orange flavor upfront. Very light and refreshing. Nice hoppy aftertaste, but not huge. Makes this an easy drinker."

"O-Edward is one of my favorite beers, but who am I kidding anything those guys do up on the farm is unbelievable!"

"Extremely flavorful and hoppy pale ale. Great golden pale color, fantastic hop aroma of citrus. Has a better hop profile than most generic IPAs on the market. If I had to choose one beer to drink for the rest of my life. I think Edward would be it..."

"Re-visited on tap multiple times on my recent Vermont pilgrimage during the week of 2/11/2014. New thoughts on this beer, having had multiple of highly acclaimed American Pale Ales such as Zombie Dust, pseudoSue, etc. and having had the chance to enjoy this at least 8 times since the first growler I split back in September. The best thing about this beer is that it is so complex that each time I taste it, there's something different that stands out that was previously in the background. It has citrus, passion fruit, mango, floral, pine hop characters in there. Most of the time, citrus and passion fruit stands out, but other times the floral and pine stands out. It just seems to depend on how you're feeling that day. And either way the delicious malt backbone provides just enough sweetness along with the fantastic HF mouthfeel to make drinking this a real treat. It's not overwhelmingly bitter, is flavourful and almost juicy, and a true pleasure to drink no matter where I am in my day or my life. It's by far my favorite American Pale Ale and in my opinion, it is more or less perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Growler - nose is stronger citrus, orange and peach. Taste also has more hops, some citrus and some fresh fruity green notes, still well balanced grain, clean and fresh. Bitterness is a touch less than I remember."

"Real orangey. Seriously, it smells like someone peeled a clementine, but no, it's just this beer. Sweet orange aromas, great light mouthfeel with enough body to keep it interesting, but not get heavy after drinking a pint of it. I don't know if I could only drink this beer for eternity, there's no pine or resin to kick me in the teeth, but for a night, a week, I could really dig this in the springtime sun."

"This is a colorful APA that does great justice to an oft overlooked style."

"About as perfect as a beer can be in my eyes... Such a easy drinking and refreshing Pale Ale. Refreshing and easy. If i had to pick one beer to have forever, just so incredibly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great! Beer! This was the first beer beside The Heady once I went to Waterbury, Vermont. This beer fills your mouth with a nice hoppy taste. Tasted very very fresh. Hill Farmstead mastered brewing beers. This beer is right on point. I believe it's a American Pale Ale BUT it punches you in the face like a Double IPA."
""
""
"What more can be said. And quite frankly droning on for more than 140 characters in this day and age is droll. Unreal smell. Wants to be an IPA. Bitter aftertaste. Great to look at. Day old growler. 2L is just enough for my wife and I to share on a cold New England fall night."
""

""

"Pours a light, orangy color, hazy and with a modest, creamy head. The smell is citrusy hops, not overpowering, but solid and nice. The taste follows suit, citrus hoppiness, a touch of malt, but then the hops turn up at the end with a parting shot of orange peel goodness. Mouthfeel, is magical. God, I wish I knew how HF creates the silky, smooth body that they do, even in this very low abv APA... Overall, a very solid APA. One of the best I've had!"
"O- I love the 5.2% abv of this brew, so drinkable. 85 ibus are a lot for an APA, but the malts hold their own. Excellent."

"The taste is not as complex as the scent,but interesting in its own ways. It begins somewhat thin, but rounds out nicely developing to a medium bodied mouthfeel. Initially a nondescript bitterness that gives midway through to the bread like malt flavor. Finishes with an agressive hop bitterness. A little disappointing that some of the wonderful scent does not carry through as well into the flavor."
"One of the better pale ales I've had. Give it a try if you get a chance."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very mediocre. it had promise based on the smell and look, but the taste is so underwhelming one-dimensional, that I am completely unable to understand why this beer is more well-rated than so many other quality beers."

"Overall, Edward is a solid beer. But compared to other Hill Farmstead offerings (What Is Enlightenment? The single hop Citra, Grassroots Legitimacy IPA or Abner, just to name a few that I enjoy more), I feel that Edward is overrated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Served a slightly hazed, apricot in color with a frothy, dense white head that retains well and leaves heavy lace. From the first encounter, this uniquely flavorful and balanced pale really showed off how great a typically simple style can be if crafted properly. Lots of tropical, citrusy hop character with a lovely presence softened by notes of herbal grass, peach, and the pale bready malt body. Lush hops notes with a very tempered, midrange bitterness complimenting a light malt sweetness. Light-moderate body with a moderate carbonation and dry finish with a touch of resin. Rests near the top of the apa heap."
""
""
""
"Pours a foggy oranges with a beautiful frothy head of thick, foamy goodness. Citrus and grass aromas, on the soft side at first, but deep and fresh. Tangerine juice, lemon zest, flowers, and faint cereal grain with a hint of herbal/scallion/dank weed. Flavor is so green, fresh, and juicy...hoppy grapefruit, tangerine, pine, peachy sweetness, and spicy, slightly herbal notes. Medium bodied and very smooth, lightly carbonated, and dry with a lingering bitter finish. We had no problem killing the growler in short order."
"Edward is a perfectly crafted beer and one of my all time favorites."
""

"This is the best American beer I have ever tasted. Hands down. It makes me think of a cloistered European unfiltered Marzens perfection. If I could only drink one american beer for the rest of my life this would be it. I really just can't get over how amazing it is. It was shockingly good on the first sip. And many rounds later still just as amazing."
""
""
""
""
"Tap at the Moll household thanks to yourefragile. Gorgeous pour: thick buttermilk foam, huge rocky retention. Glowing, bright peach color. Huge lacing. Nose has the essential Hill Farmstead sweet cream butter going on in the nose along with fresh biscuit. Oh, there is a ton of dank hops but the malt character is more impressive as always. Taste is very quenching, soft, biscuity, sourdough, light fruitiness like cantaloupe and peach. Grassy, herbal hops come to balance. So nice to have a zero astringency, zero abrasive, zero specialty malt stickiness APA. Hill Farmstead has this style on lockdown and should write the textbook."
""
"A totally hazy, orange-yellow body, draped lacing, great retention; dry, clean and crisp finish, bursts with flavor, nice grapefruit aroma reflected in the flavor. Easy drinking APA thank doesn't compromise on taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had it with the boys at Three Penny Pub in Montpelier. Served in a narrow Hill's Farmstead glass. My first experience with Hill's did not disappoint. It was one of,if not the best pale ales that I've ever tasted. Reminded me of Maine Brewing Mo which is a great thing. Started and ended smooth. I can't wait to go back."
"O - I'm beginning to understand why these beers are rated so highly. However, I can't help but notice that, while everything I tried on this recent trip has been delicious, it has also been relatively one dimensional. I'd love to try some other non IPA/APA styles."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL : Incredible beer that, even though it's called American Pale Ale, might actually be a hybrid of APA and IPA. Not quite hoppy enough to be an IPA, but in my own opinion, not quite round and generous enough to be an APA. Still, I'm glad I still have a couple glasses of this where that came from. I'll enjoy every last drop of it."

"O - Not the super juicy tropical nose I have been accustomed with HF beers. It could be entirely possible I hold HF at higher level. Bc nose is very very good. Juicy hops do explode in mouth. Little more piney than expected from a pale ale. It does come close - buy ZD still holds the crown."

""
""
"Loads of hop flavor without a ton of bitterness, great malt backing, very drinkable, this is to be expected from Hill Farmstead. Having had it recently as well, I prefer What is Enlightenment? as far as their pale ales go, but this is certainly very good by all means."

"The smell is very sweet and piney. The taste is sweet yet very bold. It has a smooth feel that hangs around in the back of the mouth. This beer is a dark gold color with a very thick white head. This beer is all that it is cracked up to be. Very nice. This guy can brew."

"OV: As with Susan, this is a very solid and high quality beer that I would drink regularly if I was able to do so. However, this beer also didn't 'blow my mind' and while I think it's very good, to me it's not quite World Class. I am glad I got to try this."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the hop explosion on the nose, and the wonderfully interwoven realism of the farm’s well-water. As in some of their other hoppy beers, this plays an integral part in the aroma and the flavoring, giving a certain genuine brush to it, and making the grain and oily hoppiness that much more close, wholesome, and real. The hops through the flavoring, here, were insanely flavorful, juicy, and authentic, giving the illusion that one was literally sucking on a thin slice of dripping wet grapefruit. Again, this mixed with the exquisite base components, making for yet another memorable, thoughtful, and deliberate beer with true character."

"Mouthfeel has some rolling bubbles but not creamy, leaves a dry aftertaste"
""
""
"Pours a large white, creamy, foamy head with super small bubbles – almost three fingers worth. Color is hazy yellow amber, touching on orange. I’m smelling huge amounts of citrus - predominantly grapefruit but also orange peel and a little bit of lemon zest. There’s a slight amount of piney aroma as well. The taste is almost perfection. It’s everything I want a pale ale to be. The malts and hops are completely balanced with an unrivaled lingering finish. The pale malt is wonderful. All the citrus is still there as it was on the nose and the fruity, citrusy hops are just enough without going too far. Mouthfeel is super creamy and it the head is retained all the way to the bottom of the glass. It would be tough to ask for a better pale ale. It quenches my thirst like none other."

"Tap: Poured a hazy bright yellow color ale with large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of floral hay and citrus notes with fruity ester and quite incredible. Taste is also dominated by fresh citrus notes with nice floral notes with fresh crisp cereal notes. Body is about average with great carbonation. Loads of hoppy with very limited amount of bitterness. Another winner from this brewer."

"I would certainly put this beer up there amongst the worlds best apa's.  not the prototype of a Pliny the elder but close and a pleasant drink."

"Poured from a 750ml growler into a snifter. Color was a medium dark amber hue, with a very thin white lacing. Aroma was a fruity floral with strong citrus notes. Flavor started off with a hoppy flavor, but sweet hops with a bit of a orangy profile. Felt great in the mouth. Just a bit of cling to the insides, a tad too much kick on the tongue for my liking. Overall a great beer. Easily accessible for most people, but refined enough to enthusiasts to enjoy."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tulip, the beer is a bright, orange-gold coloring with a dense, short-stacked, clingy, white head. Good carbonation action throughout the body. Nose of lemon-lime citrus sweetness, pepper and basil spice, and a subtle biscuit backbone. Wow! Flavors of citrus and spiced hops on the forward tongue, followed by a light caramel sweet and bready backbone. Very balanced and very easy to drink. Body kept light by the carbonation. The aftertaste has piney and grassy hops characteristics, with a subtle citrus sweet linger. Clean, dry finish, begging for more. Flavorful and easy to drink, this one could be trouble. Great brew!"

"I mean, what more can you do to a pale ale? this destroys zombie dust in my mind, wow is this good. it pours a glorious hazy orange color with an inch of cool whip looking head. the nose is amazing, pine and lemon and grapefruit, intensely hopped, but freakishly drinkable. the malts provide just enough backbone, and the yeast that was used clearly fermented every last sugar in this thing, its dry and clean and bitter and superbly well carbonated, and somehow very light and sessionable despite its packed in flavor. this is a beer drinkers pale ale, brilliantly hopped, literally like nothing else ive ever encountered, the craftsmanship here is unrivaled. what was missing in the hill farmstead saisons is captured here, I desire no more in a pale ale, and I think that I have found the one I am made to drink. like when I saw buddy guy play guitar for the first time, I knew talent and showmanship had reached their pinnacle, this is that same peak in an American pale ale, it is not equaled by any ive ever had, and I doubt if it will be. world class and then some, a must try for anyone who likes sessioning hoppy beers."
""
"Verdict: A very nice pale ale from Hill Farmstead, quite drinkable, nice hop profile without being an aggressively hopped and bitter pale ale. It's not in the same league as What is Enlightenment, but this is a fine ale that I would love to drink regularly."
"Overall- This is a great pale up there with Zombie Dust and Blue Lobsters Gold Claw."

"On tap at Farmhouse Tap and Grill. Pours a cloudy burnt orange color with an inch of frothy head. Some lacing. The aroma is hoppy with some citrus and tropical fruits. Maybe tangerine? the taste is bitter apricots with nice tropical fruits. grapefruit notes as well. Nice bitterness with a good amount of fruity hop flavor. Dry and resinous. This is a Pale Ale with a lot of fruity and hoppy that rivals most IPAs. Overall, its bitter, hoppy and drinkable. Glad I got to try it. Fantastic Pale Ale worth seeking out."
"O/D - A pretty nice pale ale. Seems pretty heavy with that bright, lovley fresh citrus flavour, and it's really thirst quenching and complex. Really well made, to the point, and tasty. Very drinkable too. A good one."

"O: Didn't live up to the hype for me. Flavor was a bit one-note and the harsh bitterness in the finish really hurts drinkability. I can't really imagine that I'd want to drink more than a single pint of this. Smells lovely, though."

"I enjoyed this on tap at Hop and Vine in Portland, Oregon. They did a beer exchange with some Vermont breweries and got like 20 different beers. I had Edward in a 12 oz glass and I must say, it was very smooth. It had a nice amount of hops, yet was not at all overpowering. There was a little foam when poured, but that quickly dissipated. It poured a nice light orange color and smelled very nice. I highly recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer pours a hazy orange-yellow and several shades darker than Society and Solitude #6 (I just reviewed that beer, and that is why I am comparing them in color). The beer also pours with a big rocky, egg shell white head of varying sized bubbles which leaves sticky fat strings on the glass as it mellows into a finger’s width head. In body the beer is a cloudy haze, like most hoppy beers from Hill Farmstead. On the nose, the beer smells of juicy citrus hops with touches of tropical fruit and a solid backbone of pine. The malt is present as a light spicy bread and sweet caramel that melds nicely with the Hill Farmstead ale yeast’s breadiness. This is a nice smell that highlights the hops while still giving a good light malt character. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter sweet with a slight acidity from the hops. In flavor, the beer begins as juicy hops, featuring sweet orange and tangerine flavors with touches of tropical fruit before it blossoms into grapefruit, bitter pine, and then aspirin flavors that properly bite. Beneath the bitters rise a nice malt character that is slightly caramelly and mellow, it also features a slight spice grain flavor. The finish is surprisingly long and returns to the beginning’s juicy hop flavors only now with a solid cereal caramel flavor that is mellow and warming on the throat. The aftertaste brings the bitters back to the tongue with lingering whiffs of cereal malts. In the mouth, this beer feels medium light and creamy in body with a beautiful fluffy carbonation that I’m coming to expect from Hill Farmstead. The mouth is left bitter-dry but wet on the sides of the tongue from the hop acids. Overall, this may be my favorite American pale ale of those I have tried. Mo from the Maine Beer Company is a little behind it, though I think Mo had a better nose, but this beer handles its bitters beautifully and melds them into the malts so that each has its turn to shine on the palate. Its taste definitely surpasses Mo, and that is where it counts. This is another beautiful beer from Hill Farmstead. Try this beer."

"Hill Farmstead's flagship for good reason. I could drink this all day."
"Most definitely a top notch Ale made with a thoughtful selection of hops, ale malt and well water from the Hill Farm. Very inviting and for those that appreciate a moderate amount of bitterness, it is a great choice: those expecting a wallop to the palate might feel let down on that front, but there is no denying the quality and the high level of craft to produce this complex and delicious Vermont ale."

"O- probably not a fair review of this beer (growler is 3 weeks old) but not sure if I will ever get to try it again. Surprised how much head it still poured, but I think the aroma and taste suffered from the age."
""
""
"The smell isn't too overwhelming however I can pick up on just the right amount of hops with grapefruit and subtle lemon and orange. Reminds me of a toned down galaxy- I would say more prominent citrus notes and a bit of subtle tropical fruit in the background. The hops are lightly floral but still very juicy and I can still get some risinous tastes, but not too overwhelming. Taste is very well balanced- juicy and fruity hops come at you with grapefruit, tangerine, and a little lemon? I can notice the malt however its in the background and doesn't take away from the hoppy PA nature of the brew. Balance between the hops and malt is the key for this PA - however the hops are certainly brought to the forefront which is what I would want out of an PA of this nature. I prefer DIPAs above all else, however I loved this HF brew and I would certainly recommend it to anyone- don't let the APA style fool you, it still has tons of excellent hoppy character."

"On-tap at the Blackback Pub in Waterbury, VT - served in a Hill Farmstead tulip. Hazy orange complexion with a loose, quarter inch off-white head that dissipates into a consistent skim. Concentric bands of lacing encircle the shoulders of the glass. Nose expresses citrus and floral notes; slightly grassy and delicate with some biscuity aromas towards the back. Taste follows nose; however, more of an earthy/grassy character comes out in the flavor profile with the citrus notes lingering lightly and some hops bittering in the background. There's also a trace of wet cardboard at the finish. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a pleasant, palate cleansing carbonation. Overall, an immensely quaffable American Pale Ale that is a hallmark of the style in my humble opinion."

"I had this beer at the Farmhouse in Burlington, VT. It is a local favorite and every time I visit I end up drinking at least one. The Edward tastes more like a IPA with low ABV, which really brings out the character of the hops. It is aromatic, delicious and you should get it if you have the chance. A Burlington, VT classic."

"Edward pours a nice dark golden color with a thick two finger head that slowly dissipates leaving the glass laced. This beer definitely showcases the hops. The aroma is of pine and grapefruit. The flavor is goes along and one gets the citrus first followed by the piney essences. There is almost a resiny flavor from the hops. The bitterness lingers for a little bit on the back of the tongue before fading away slowly. This beer is light and mildly bubbly leaving just a hint of stickiness after the swallow. Overall, Edward is a very nice Pale Ale on the hoppier end of the spectrum."
""
""
""
"O-What an APA, not as good as Zombie Dust but great none the less. The balance is great."
"I rated this beer pretty high because it's good. More so because it's good and my wife likes it."

"Pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a nice bone white head that persists forever. Wow that aroma has got lots of hops in it for a Pale ale! Juicy citrus and pine with a hint of green onion and a touch of bready malt make for a wonderful smelling beer. The flavor is loaded with pine and citrus with a bit of sweet malt to back it up. Flavorful bitterness, but never harsh. Medium to light body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a bready resinous mouthfeel. This is a great little beer, that at times feel more like and IPA, but its so damn good I'm not going to quibble of stylistic designations."
""
"O - 4.5 - A flavorful pale ale that drinks like an ipa without the higher ABV, hits the spot, nicely executed!"
"Something is familiar between the three hoppy HF beers I've tried but it's hard to put my finger on. I'm not sure if it's the malt, the water (my guess), or a particular hop (I don't think this is it) but the three HF beers all have a similar taste that I really like and isn't like many other beers. It's very slight but since HF beers are few and far between for me I'm really taking the time to analyze each one. I'm interested to see if this carries over into the saisons that are next up."
""
"O: Most excellent."
""
"O: My first and certainly not last beer from Hill Farmstead. As I can already tell, the hype is real. A nearly perfect version of the style and a great utilization of all the characteristics of hops that beer lovers cherish. You can taste all the ingredients and differentiate them as unique to this brewery. Incredible stuff."
""
""

"A very solid pale ale. Pales in comparison to some of the other HF hoppy offerings, but still a pale ale, I'd be glad to order anytime."

""
""

"Medium to slightly light bodied with smooth but clean carbonation. Elegant and totally drinkable. One could drink a lot of this one, a perfect candidate for a session, American style. Not as exciting as the HF IPAs perhaps, but more of an everyday drinker to be sure."
""
""
""
""
"O: an amazing pale ale, loads of hoppy citrus goodness, excellent all the way through, awesome."
""
"Right where modern pale ales should be. Hoppy but balanced nicely by malt and yeast. Would probably buy a 12-pack of this bi-weekly if I could, I can dream."

"O: Russian River's Row 2, Alpine's Hoppy Birthday, and Three Floyds' Zombie Dust are probably the most popular pale ales on BA right now. This and Hill Farmstead's Citra should be in the conversation, as well. Superlative for the style. I feel almost like a broken record saying how good Hill Farmstead's hoppy beers are, but when it's true..."
""

""

"O: most excellent beer. Looks like a homebrew."
""
""
"Poured from tap into tall HF pint at three penny Montpelier, VT. Pours a hazy orange with really nice foam head, with sticky as hell lacing. Really hoppy citrus/grapefruit aromas. Slight citrus and malt flavours with a ""raw"" hop flavour but not bitter. Its creamy smooth for an APA and really easy to drink. Such a fantastic brew."
""
""
"Overall real interesting beer, perhaps not as drawn to it, but it's quite a unique pale ale style beer by these guys and a very well crafted solid brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just a terrific APA. Really well done."
"Enjoyed on tap at Prohibition Pg. Cloudy peach coloured body, with no head. OK drinkability, good hop flavour, citrus tangerine not necessarily my favourite flavours. Carbonation right there. Decent flavour but not my favourite Hill Farmstead nor pale."
"Overall (5/5): Hill Farmstead Edward is a superior American Pale Ale. Its delicious aroma, its exceptionally well-balanced fruity hop and biscuit malt flavors, and its out-of-this-world drinkability make it a true stand-out among not only beers of its style category, but among all the beers in the wide world of beerdom. Now, Edward may not be the most unusual or sought-after of Shaun Hill's fermented creations, but it certainly is one of the best and makes a great introduction to his other beers. Bravo, Hill Farmstead!"
"O- This was a very nice pale ale, one of my favorites. The only one I would say is maybe a little bit better that I've had is Row 2/Hill 56. Has a very nice hop taste for a pale ale and is very well balanced between the citrus hops and caramel/pale malts. I will definitely be drinking this one again. Definitely recommend trying it if you get the chance."
"A very good APA; about on par with Daisy Cutter in my book. Zombie Dust still reigns supreme!"
""
"I love being surprised by an APA. Brewers in the US have mastered the style, and even the efforts from mediocre breweries are usually nice enough. Hill Farmstead's Edward focuses on freshness to make a quenching APA, with very little of the resinous bitterness that sometimes blurs the lines between this style and AIPAs."
"On tap several times. Copper body with thick white head and beautiful lacing. Intense aroma of tropical fruits (pinneaple, grapefruit, mango puree), spicy and grassy hops. Taste is simply amazing. A rush of grassy and piny hops with subtle caramel malts and some grapefruit skin. Awesome hop profile. I thought it was very robust for an IPA before I read the menu and found out it was an APA."
"In the end, I felt the beer to be a really subtle affair, unique and immensely satisfying. It rewards careful attention, yet also hits the spot if you just need a good, soul-satisfying pale ale--the hallmark of a great beer."
""
""
"This is a med bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is very easy drinking and worth checkin out. I would have this again if presented with the opportunity."
"had this at the blue dog and was quite good."

"Taste continues the tangerine presence for me, an initial sweetness which promptly cedes the baton to the juicy fruitiness. Closes with a sedate bitterness and a touch of pine. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, and drinkability is very good. Another thirst-quenching brew here from Hill Farmstead."

"I could session drink this beer all night and pause every couple minutes just to say damn this is a good beer."
"This beer pours a medium bodied and very cloudy apricot orange in color with a one finger soapy head. The nose is essentially clean citrusy hops through and through. There is orange and tangerine everywhere. It's citrusy chaos haha. The flavors too are 100% citrusy hops. I can't get away from Minute Maid. It's hard, really hard to pick out anything else so i can't say the nose or flavors are incredibly complex. It drinks medium in body and moderately dry. It has nice flavor and I could drink a lot of it. It is just that it's an all out orange assault on your senses without much depth."
""
""
"This is a fantasticly well balanced beer. Not too hoppy, not too malty. Very easy to drink."
""
"Served in a signature HF stem glass, Edward poured a murky golden-apricot color with a small bubbly white head; decent retention and lacing. Nice aroma of fresh hops, citrus and grass. Fresh, crisp blast of all kinds of citrus in the taste, juicy hops, bitter in the finish; biscuity malt base as a distant afterthought. Even though considered an APA, I say this one is pretty comparable to higher end IPAs like Pliny the Elder. Medium body, full of flavor and highly drinkable, for an excellent beer overall."
""
""
""
""
"Taste & mouthfeel: Opens with a blast of citrus flesh (grapefruit, pineapple), bitter lemon peel, astringent fresh herbs, doughy/bready malt. Little bit of spiciness up front. Biting, bitter finish. Delicious and refreshing."

"O - Wonderful Pale Ale. This is probably the best Pale ale I have had next to Zombie Dust . I just wish you could get this easier. In bottles also. But since that probably isn't going to happen I'll have to enjoy it on Tap when I see it around Town. This was my first Hill Farmstead beer and I want to try them all now. If this is any indication of how they brew I want more NOW."

"O- This may be my second favorite pale ale behind Zombie dust. A nice amount of complexity for being just over 5%. I could have easily drank the whole growler myself."

"The flavors on the palate are enjoyable, but not quite as good as the nose would suggest. While present in copious amounts, the hop flavor seems slightly dulled and dare I say, a little oxidized? As with the nose, the flavor leans heavily on the fruity hops. Mango, clementines and grapefruit lend plenty of flavor, and the bitterness is low. The Cascade (dry hop?) character is particularly noticeable. The malt character is clean, cracker-like, mildly doughy and unobtrusive. Drying on the finish with a lingering hop flavor (particularly the citrus) and a mildly resiny (and gorgeous) bitterness. Light in body with soft, gentle carbonation that's perfect for the style, this beer is extremely enjoyable. I'm glad to have tried it, but I have a feeling this batch is just a touch old."
"Easily one of the best East Coast Pale Ales I've had as of late. Ridiculously fruity nose of pineapple, grapefruit and passion fruit....initially thought there were Galaxy hops involved, but the profile on the Hill Farmstead site claims otherwise. Tastes similar to a citrus-forward IPA a'la Flower Power, but the 5.2 abv means you can easily drain multiple pints without wanting to fall over...it almost feels like cheating. Magnifique."

"This beer pours a nice slightly hazy golden copper color. It has a nice finger of white head on it. The head has good retention, and it leaves behind a nice sheet of lace on the glass. The nose smells of floral and citrus hops. There are some tropical fruit aromas here as well as a bit of caramel. The taste has a nice citrus flavor with some caramel in background. There is a nice hop flavor that gives a good amount of bitterness. There is a nice bit of pineapple and other tropical fruit flavors. The finish leaves some fruit flavors and hop bitterness lingering on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a nice smooth feel to it. There is a nice amount of hop bitterness here, with some nice fruity sweetness that gives it nice balance. This has really good drinkability. I would have no problem downing a bunch of glasses of this throughout an evening. Overall, I think it is a really nice solid Pale Ale. The hop presence is really nice, as are the tropical fruit flavors. I really enjoyed this beer, and I would recommend trying it out. I don't think you'll be disappointed."

"O- Great smell, great bitterness, and taste. All qualities in this beer you would expect from an IPA rather than a pale ale. So smooth and so drinkable. I can't wait to try more from HF."
"had st the good life. arrived super cloudy in a point glass. los unfiltered and peach in color. smells like classic pale ale but the taste has a bit of a hop bite. quite nice. a bit grapefruit. flavored. nice unfiltered feel medium to light bodied. very easy drinker. why yes, I will have another."
"Very hoppy and strong for a pale ale. Good drinking. Another great beer from this brewery."
"On tap at Armsby Abbey. Cloudy golden color with a moderate creamy white head. Smells of tropical fruit and honey, not heavy on pine and citrus. Taste is clean hoppy goodness with just enough biscuit to balance. Smooth and creamy from the tap. Wish this was available regularly in my area."
"This is like an IPA light or a session IPA. It tastes great and works if you're looking for the HF hop profile without a stronger beer. On my rare chances to get HF beers, though, I'm more apt to try something bigger."
"This beer was the 4th (and last) to run out at the Capone'sevent."
"M: Clean and hoppy, Edward doesn't skimp on the hops. From the first sniff to the last sip, I was in love. Too bad -- no growler fills..."
"Really delicious, and a pretty incredible beer given the ABV. I could easily see this being a summer staple if Hill Farmstead does indeed make its way to Boston."
"Pours a hazed golden orange with stiff and fluffy cap of white foam, long lasting and great lacing. Scent is of juicy and fruity hops with grapefruit, tangerine and pineapple the stars, perfect levels of biscuity malt sweetness in the backbone. Taste follows the amazing scent, fruity and juicy, full flavored (this is a pale ale? stronger than many IPAs!) without being overly bitter. Medium bodied, smooth and lightly creamy, great carbonation. Hands down the best pale ale on the market. A great intro to the brewery a few days before the full visit."
"Overall just awesome. Great hops, nice soft smooth malt, great tropical fruits without the big oily resinous kick, not super hoppy or super bitter, and malts are not only kept in check, but have a really nice flavor addition with that silky smooth malt kick, I wish I knew how they did it."
"O - Overall this was insanely good. So juicy and tropical. To quote a film, I want to freeze this in winter and skate on it, then thaw it in summer and drink it."
"What a great pale ale. The freshness is unreal. Balance, flavor and feel. Well done."
"Edward pours a nearly solid (opaque) orange, with a thin bit of white foam sitting atop the beer. That little head is definitely spunky, it sticks around longer than I would have expected, but it only leaves a tiny bit of lacing. The nose is absolutely wonderful, dank with grapefruit, pineapple, and orange aromas. Forget IPAs, this bad boy is more pungent than some imperial IPAs that I've had. There's a brief flash of cracker maltiness at the front of each sip, before some (but not all) of the hoppy goodness hinted at by aroma is delivered. There's also a bit of an off aftertaste that I usually associate with Simcoe hops that lingers for a second after each sip. The body is a bit on the light side, appropriate for the style, yet still sturdy enough not to be completely overrun by the hops. The carbonation is just a little off though, the beer falls dull by the time it reaches the back of my palate. Still though, Edward is one of the better American Pale Ales I've had, and an excellent choice for someone who wants a serious hop fix within a lower ABV beer."
"One of the better apa that I've ever consumed!"
"Overall: A solid APA. Bitter and easy drinking. Actually sits a bit too bitter on the finish and it impacts the general flavor on subsequent sips. Incredibly drinkable regardless."
"Well-done. This is the best of the HF beers I've had. Hands down."
" You can't do much better than this. Beautiful in its simplicity."
"O - As far as APA's go, this one is really hard to beat. It's amongst the class of Alpine Hoppy Birthday and Russian River Parking Violation, my two favorites. It's good out of a growler, but on-tap, it's at the top of its class. If you're in Chicago, come on by for a pint (while it lasts!)."
"this beer ours a light slightly hazy yellow with a good off white head. the smell is earthy and citrusy with almost not malt presence (nice and dry just the way i like it) the taste is dy hoppy citryusy and wonderful. the mouthfeel is well carbed and light boddied. I wish hill farmsead distributed to mass, maybe someday they will"
"Overall: Another Hill Farmstead beer where the citrus just jumps. If all hops jumped like this, I could turn into a hop head. This certainly tastes more like a well crafted IPA than a pale ale. It may be my favorite pale ale. This is a bitter beer, but not overly so. Just really flavorful."
"Growler compliments of Gluglouburp- thanks again Dany! Pours a hazy light orange with average white head and soapy lacing. Nose- resinous pine, white and pink grapefruit rinds and sweet tropical fruits. Just an amazing hop assult to the nostrils. Taste- light bodied cookie dough followed by a juicy and dank wave of hops. Finishes very crisp, and dry to the pallete although with just a touch of sweet creaminess. Great stuff"
"O: Overall, sometimes a sublime work of art is not ""enjoyable"" but is disturbing. I am being poetic here, but I did not love the experience of drinking this beer, yet I know it was something unusual and special. The bone dry bitterness of this would keep me from actively seeking it out so I'll give it a 4, but this is a really memorable and intense beer. this pushes the limit of a Pale Ale, and is fresh and vibrant tasting. The smell is truly exceptional. This is my first Hill Farmstead tasting and I look forward to trying some of their higher APV offerings."
"O/D-This and Abner were so delicious. Hill Farmstead has such a cool this going on at their farm. I could drink this and be happy for my whole life. Such a bold, stylish APA. Vermont is killing it."
"D: Supreme. The reasonably low ABV, exceptional body, aesthetic beauty, and superb taste and smell make this one of the best, most drinkable beers I've ever had. I imagine it owes some of its greatness to its freshness, but either way this is an excellent beer. It's wonderfully hoppy, bitter and flavorful without having some of the dehydrating characteristics of some IPAs and APAs, and would make a great all-night beer. At the anniversary party and in the three growler fills I've had, Edward is the beer I keep coming back to at Hill Farmstead. I dream of one day having a bierkeller with old shelves stocked full of beer around an old oak table and a keg of Edward at hand."
"This is a pale ale? Really? The quantity of hops in this brew, and the overall complexity, would have me believe that this is an IPA (or even perhaps a double IPA). Impressive, to say the least."
"And despite that conversation, I will use my words to order this any future time it's on tap. In English. It's a beautiful beer. But perhaps not worth dirty trousers."
"its hard to make a good pale these days everyone is making double triple quadruple ipas i like edward though he is a good dude"
"Pales aren't usually my thing. The hops are heavier than I'd expected. I'm sure Edward is very nice but I wouldn't want to hang around with him for more than a pint. We're different people."
"O: nice and sessionable. i plan on killing the rest of this growler tonight."
"O: Simply put, this is a very good beer. Easily drinkable, well balanced, flavorful and aromatic."
"In my opinion as APAs go they are either good or mediocre, there is no inbetween. This is good, damn good. This pours as most pale ales would a golden body with a white foam topper. The aroma is of many many hop varietals that I dare not have my nose try and decipher them all. All I can say is citrus and flowers work so well together whilst smelling this beer. The flavor is quite tasty as well. It's good for it's style and the malt body accents the perfectly added hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and delicious. Overall this is a good beer and more people should have the grand opportunity to be graced with what is clearly one of the top 5 of it's style."
"O: this is an awesome and drinkable APA. It features a nice presentation of tropical smelling hops. Worth a try!"
"And the Gang Bang enjoyment begins here. It pours a cloudy amber-straw topped by a couple fingers of cream-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, lemon zest, mango, papaya, light pine, light caramel, and light vanilla. The taste holds notes of grapefruit peel, orange peel, pine, lemon peel, dark greens, grass, and flowers. The body is a rather light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry, kinda sticky finish. Overall, a very good APA, one where a seeming lack of balance does not hurt it all too much at all. Damn, I wish I could get more of this whenever I wanted to..."
"Lighter end of medium bodied with a blast of dry bitter hops that linger over the sweet tropical and citrus fruit notes and pale malt backbone info a spicy dry finish.  Very good balance of bitter, dry and sweet notes.  Hints of oily pine, mango, pineapple and straw with biscuit and Graham cracker malt notes.  A bit watered down but still plenty hoppy without being one dimensional.  Very easy to drink."
"I have to say that this is one of the best Pale Ales that I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. This stuff comes highly recommended."
"Overall: A revelation. I don't know what's going on in Northern New England, but between this guy and Maine Beer's Peeper, the landscape of the American Pale Ale is being changed. I'm not sure there's a better APA than Edward out there today."
"Pours a hazy yellow orange coor with a white head leaving some good lacing. Nose jumps out pretty well with all sort of citrus, bitter grapefruit with a little dankness and some biscuity character. Taste opens up immediately with hops, grapefruit at first, but I also get some mango and orange coming through too. Malt is almost not even present save for the faintest bit of bread hidden beneath all the hops. A touch heftier than light bodied with a little under medium carbonation levels. I fill up a growler with this regularly if I could."
"Nice light body on the feel with good soft carbonation. Overall a well made pale ale. Easy to drink with enjoyable flavors."
"Clear and pale, like an ale. Clean and hoppy deliciousness with tangerine sexy, I suppose this is the product of their style of hop additions. Leave no wort behind! A little bit of malt character but not much body overall, leaving behind a clean and hoppy beer. Pretty tasty, glad to share it with some good folks."
"Overall, it's good, not a great pale ale."
"Overall: An excellent hoppy pale. I could drink this all night."
"Medium body and carbonation, dry and lingering on the tongue. Crazy drinkability on this and solid flavor - I could easily plow through a growler with a friend during the summer months."
"O: Very drinkable and quite quenching, Edward is definitely a beer that you get by the growler-full. I could drink this one all day on a hot summer afternoon."
"This is just an amazingly good pale ale.... for a hop head. Just lovely..."
"-wow, this is exceptional. i could drink this stuff like crazy. probably the best PA i've had"
"the most dry hopped beer i think i've ever had. straight out of the tap it smells like hop pellets. had a whole twenty liter keg with some buddies over a weekend. orange with nice sticky head. that wouldn't go away. nose opened up to pine, cannibus, and a thick orange mango note. the nose is very much so that but the beer itself is so light and refreshing it sort of designs the palate for the hops as a very delicate matter. this feels like a belgian table beer in spirit and the american craft hopping. palate is light and effervescent and nice and floral. a fruit that is sent dry with hops but not bitter. the beer is dry but its not one dimensional. there are subtle hints of citrus in this rainbow of hops... all expressed once your nose is attuned to it's glory. the first APA i could have everyday."
"Big thanks goes out to mikesgroove for sharing this one with me! Had during Hobo Tasting #5 while sitting inside RJ Rockers! Served from growler into a Stone nonic. Poured a murky yellow-orange with a one finger bone white head that subsided to a very minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. The citrus aspect on this one kept me coming back for more. I really like citrus in my beer (no, not like the citrus people like in their Blue Moons) so this one was a no-brainer for me. Really glad I got to try this one. Just hate Mike left me with a half a growler of this at Rockers when he left. I blame this growler for getting me drunk that night by the way... An absolute must try!"
"Appearance is burnt orange with a thick one finger head. Taking in the aroma of Edward is small event in itself. This APA is beautifully fragrant with citrus, hops, grass, some other elements as well. Its` taste includes more of the hops, pineapple, grape, pine. MF is medium with a bitterness, as well as lemon in the end. Overall, this beer is quite good."
"Overall: Wonderful pale ale. I walked 3 miles in Brooklyn just to taste this beer and it was well worth the journey. Exact type of beer I'd like to spend all day drinking in the summer."
"4.0 D: I have doubts that labeling this a APA is appropriate, but I don't doubt that this is a great beer. Very drinkable as I got through half a growler very quickly. The hop flavor is good, but the impressive aspect is how clean the yeast is. Not the most complex of brews, but worth a drink."
"O: this is one of the best, if not the beat apa I've ever had. This growler will not last long, and I will be extremely sad when it's gone. This is excellent, and well worth seeking out. Skal."
"Beer is medium in body and quite hoppy but without being too bitter. I kept thinking to myself what a great base beer this would be for just about anything you wanted to do. It is a solid APA and one of the best I've ever had. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"I definitely recommend this beer. It would be quite easy to throw back a few pints of Edward."
"overall this was a simply amazing beer that really just has to be tried. i have ephraim in the fridge, cannot wait."
"d - Overall I thought this was a great APA; one of the best ones I've had along with Alpha King. Lots of hops in the nose and taste, and at 5.2% ABV it's insanely drinkable; I felt like I wouldn't have a problem finishing a growler by myself. Would love to have this one again."
"Medium bodied, smooth and juicy. This is a beer that is thirst quenching and refreshing - sessionable and quaffable at the same time that it is worthy of sipping slowly and contemplating. And with more hop aroma and flavor than many IPA's and some double IPA's, at only 5% alchohol - I'd say that is the definition of perfect drinkability."
"Edit 01/13/13: Changing this score to my first perfect 5's because this is... perfect"
"orange colored (slightly cloudy) with weak white head. strong hoppy notes in the smell, definitely more IPA-ish than pale like. Fruity and slightly piney. Smells are very fruity, like a fresh sculpin. Light and refreshing. grapefruit undertones. Mouthfeel is medium to light. Wow, the drinkability is high on this one. I'd hardly call it a pale ale, but who cares? This is delicious. All time great beer. need to get my ass to Vt."
"D - Pretty good. I really enjoyed this one quite a bit. The strong hop punch was very nice, as was the lower ABV, but the chewy feel brought it down a notch. Still very drinkable tho."
"O: Tried this again and the descriptors are similar but the beer is far better."
"Great hop profile on this APA, very tasty. It does have a home brew character to it but its damn delious."
"Pours a very hazy light apricot color with a good white head and a pretty good amount of lacing as it goes down the glass. The nose simply explodes with hoppy notes ranging from tropical to citrus with a bit of floral and pine in there for good measure. Simply a cornucopia of all that hops can do to a beer. The taste drives this up to the next level--simply awe-inspiring. Wow, so good. There really isn't any hint at all of malt, other than that it adds a bit of a base so the beer's not too thin. It is quite dry, however. Dry finish with a very resiny, bitter finish. So much flavor in a 5.2% pale ale. I simply love this. One of the best beers I've had in a long, long, long time."
"D - This was my first offering from Hill Farmstead and I was very impressed...I'm excited to try more from them...this APA was nicely hopped with an earthy flavor profile"
"Big thanks to Sean for hooking this one up at growlerfest part one. Poured into a Lost Abbey tumbler, a pale orange with a small off white bubbly head that sits at the edge of the glass. Grassy hop aroma with a straw like malt, very subtle and clean. Taste is hoppy and bitter, very grassy, some grapefruit, malty bread crust, some biscuit malts, not too sweet. Medium/light bodied with a light carbonation, kind of watery. A very solid APA, this one is very drinkable."
" The taste has a lot of vegetal hoppiness-grassy at times with mild taste of green herbal acidic hops which gives the impression of some tea-like astringency. The hops have a spiciness w/ slight peppery heat and there is mild sweetness from the malt w/ a faint citrus element as it finishes. I think this is a great beer, but it straddles the line between IPA and American Pale: it has the hoppiness of an IPA but lacks the malt and alcohol so it comes off as more bitter and yet still is highly drinkable for the style. I think this is an excellent beer, but hard to rate it higher since it is flavorful but seems slightly out of place in the traditional American pale category."
"D - Really good brew, this would be a perfect post-workout beer for me. good stuff i would drink regularly if I have the chance."
"D - Crushable! It's a very good hoppy pale ale. I don't like it quite as much as Daisy Cutter (or Parking Violation), but there'd be no shame in having this as your local pale. Would (will?) have again when I go to Vermont."
"I'd have this again but wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"People seem to love this beer and I've heard great things about Hill Farmstead. I look forward to trying some other Hill beers but this one really just didn't live up to the hype. What am I missing?"
"D - Drinks very quickly because of the fantastic malt and hop balance in the flavor which ends in a fair amount of bitter. This is a ballsy pale ale, could easily be construed as an ipa thanks to the huge range of tasty hops."
"Cheers!"
"Taste is complex American pale ale that stands out with any I've had. Great, hop finish."
"M/D: Medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Leaves a slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, extremely easy drinking. Would love to have this in my fridge as a go to beer."
"Great overall, although at 85 IBUs, come on, this is an IPA...or at least something other than a pale ale, although I'm not sure the appropriate style even exists."
"Haven't had a lot of Farmstead yet, and this one clearly stands out against the Harlan for me. I look forward to the Fear & Trembling BaconSausage also gave me. Thanks again, Tucker!"
"D: Yes. This is one of the best sessionish beers that I have ever had hands down. I would love to see the hop schedule on this beer. My first beer from them and hopefully not my last."
"Very drinkable and definitely a good session beer. I couldn't drink more than one or two though (my personal preference), because it kinda kills your palate/tongue from the abundance of hop bitterness. A real tasty offering to have just one pint of though. Crisp and refreshing with light bitterness. One of the best APAs I have have in recent memory."
"D: I could drink this as a daily brew. At 5.2% this is a beer that would be a regular go to if it was more available."
"Purchased this at the brewery. As many others have said it is so tasty with a perfect carbonation and overall drinkability that this would be my absolute standard if I could get it regularly. I feel this beer doesnt try to over power you, it comes at you in a subtle classy way with a very fine appreciation of how to deliver the taste of an IPA without overpowering your mouth. Shaun knows what he is doing and has made what I feel is by far the best session IPA out there."
"From my tasting notes. On tap at The Black Door in Montpelier, VT. I'm surprised this is listed as a pale ale, because everything about this beer made it seem like a high-quality, unique American IPA. The floral nose is exceptional, with a two-finger head and lacing that lingers for quite some time. Taste is delicious and sesionable - good hoppy bite up front, though not as hop-forward as a West Coast IPA, but very smooth with a mild creamy aftertaste, likely aided by the residual lacing. I highly recommend this beer. I am very excited to try some more offerings from Hill Farmstead."
"<crickets>"
"Overall I really enjoyed this malt based beverage. If I had easy access I would have it regularly - an excellent pale ale."
"This beer is so hard NOT to drink...it has that inescapable ""more-ishness"" that the English apparently say. My staple beer from now on...whenever I can get it."
"A full flavored hop profile, great balance (the sugary feel of the malts really makes this work) and a smooth drinking body really set this apart big time from your everyday Pale Ale. I REALLY enjoyed this and I'd have to say that this was probably a top three APA for me. This would be a hoppy go-to for sure if I was local to it. Another great offering here from this new brewery."
"Edward is a darker shade than a normal pale ale, not to say that he is not normal but the color resembles a light shade of brown with amber while a mass of white foam is up top, kinda sticky lace. Smell is hop laden with citrus, grapefruit and a touch of pine. Small malts sweetness as well. Taste is good, I had two pints and I hardly repeat myself. Semi citrus grapefruit and pine with a small sweet candi like maltiness. Feel is bold, somewhat bitter and nicely carbed. This is easy drinking here with low alcohol and enough ummmphh to make you come back for more."
"Nice pale, moderate fruit, ample malt, counter balancing a gritty hoppy finish. Tight, flavorful and enjoyable. I'd love to be able to order another and another."
"Very nice IPA overall!"
"I don't know if I've ever had a pale ale quite like this in more than 2,000 reviews - and it's damn good. Find this beer."
"This beer is about as perfect as they get. Seek it out."
"I'd like to have access to this brew on a daily basis. Very tasty and quaffable. Lovely hopjuice!"
"Might be the best Vermont beer I've tried in my séjour here. Shared the growler with a bunch of wine drinkers and suprisingly (to me at least) they all liked it. Top notch. I'd obviously like some details to be different (more crazy floral hoppiness) but that's just me. Objectively, this is a close to perfect beer."
"Very drinkable and definitely a good session beer. Crisp and refreshing with light bitterness. This beer has a lot of flavor for an APA and is a pleasure to drink. Great for a lazy summer afternoon. Nice work Shaun."
"Edward arrives at my table an ever so slightly hazy orange amber. It is dressed in a nonic pint glass with a wonderful frothy white head. The head has slightly above average retention, but leaves some of the prettiest lace I have ever seen, perfectly chronicling the volume of every sip on the side of the glass. The aroma is wonderfully fruity with a nice citrusy ""C" hop vibe as well as some bright grassiness. I also catch a hint of bready malt in there. The taste is killer with plenty of citrusy grapefruit, lemon and pine hoppiness, as well as some more earthy and grassy notes. This is definitely a very hop forward APA, but it also has a very pleasantly bready, slightly caramel malt backbone that does its job well. It holds up firm bitterness and keeps this beer from being a tongue bruiser. This has to be the most enjoyable straight up pale ale that I have had in a very long time. The mouthfeel is pretty much perfection. Lighter side of medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation and an amazingly clean finish. This beer has great drinkability and I can very easily imagine throwing a few back with good friends. I am definitely looking forward to trying more of Hill Farmsteads offerings after enjoying this awesome brew."
"Edward pored a light amber with an inch of white head. Aroma was of fragrant hops, but seemed average for pale ales. Flavor was an excellent balance of sweet caramel malt, clean hop bitterness, and spicy hop flavor. It had more of a hop presence than I expected from a Pale Ale, but it was still balanced and pleasing."
"The beer was an amber orange, clear with no head. The smell was of fruity hops and a clementine orange and grapefruit aroma that I associate with Amarillo or C hops hops. The beer tasted almost solely of hops: grassy, herbal, with a sustaining bitter finish. The body of the beer was a little thin but good to style, with a dry finish. This was a good beer that I would order again"
"A great summer IPA and more West Coast in style than the Abner (Imperial IPA). Nice work, Shaun!"
"Very good! Nice to have another local brewery in which to sample and this is a great beer to start with from Hill Farmstead."
"Drinkability: I want to drink this all day long."
"Taste is refreshing and quite malty, I just had a chinooker'd so that mght be why I feel like there's so little hops here. Malt is really refreshing and almost reminiscent of a a German beer. It's a good beer but not a hop bomb at all."
"D: Fantastic. Again, referencing the Alchemist, this beer has the taste and drinkability of Holy Cow with the aromatics of Heady Topper - the best of both worlds. The hops are intoxicating in their own right; hard to believe this is only 5.7%ABV."
"Had this on tap at American Flatbread in Burlington, VT. A very fresh tasting and well balanced IPA with a solid backbone of hops. A well crafted amber-ish IPA. The freshness of the hops really jumps out of the glass. It's obvious the ingredients that went into this beer were of the highest quality. Very well done! Looking forward to more from these guys."
