"Very watery for an ale; I'm surprised at the amount of hops that can come through such a thin-bodied beer. Even still, it falls flat in my opinion."

"Overall:  This is another excellent beer from Colorado, and another excellent beer from Left Hand, which is fastley becoming one of my favorite Colorado breweries.  It’s beautifully balanced between bready malt, sweetness and floral, slightly citrusy hops.  An excellent American Pale Ale!"
""
""
""
""
"Finally found a pale ale I like.  Not over hopped."
""
""
"This beer had a slightly skunked odor and taste.  Maybe I got a bad batch?"

"Light flower ""y" flavor....coincidentally not much citrus notes ...just an average easy drinking ale....."

"Bottle from Lazy Dog Macon. Pours transparent gold with white head. Aroma of fruity hops and citrus. Taste of bitter hops, citrus and caramel. Pretty good."

"The initial taste is good and the aftertaste is alright but the main body of flavour seems to be missing"
""
""
""
""
"Most people don't know this one because Left Hand makes so many other great beers.  It's a nice change of pace, which seems odd to say for an APA.  But they do so well with the dark beers that this one almost gets lost.  I like it a little better than Sawtooth, but would probably order something darker if I was getting a Left Hand brew."

"This ale is disappointing, coming from the brewery that makes the marvelous Sawtooth Ale. Nothing distinctive here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear gold with a hint of amber. The white head  is non-existent after about a minute; no lacing. The aroma is just barely there and is a weird sweet. The taste isn't an improvement, ill-defined and just...odd."

"Overall: Nothing special."
""
"This is a very run of the mill and ordinary crafted American pale ale that you can find a dime a dozen around the US. Its decent and well made but very generic. If offered take one. If a bar has it on tap vs BMC its a fine choice. Just nothing at all to separate this one from the pack."

"Overall: Great APA. Others wrote, perhaps it's English inspired in style. Original and sessionable. This could be an evening long session. Must try."
""
""
"O - I'm a bit surprised by the over all score as I would think this should rate around an 85. I enjoyed it and it was past its prime. I like the balance of rye, hops. and malt."

"o: Refreshing enough, just little else to make it stand out. Probably a decent session brew or dinner beer with mild food, but not worth much of the extra cost over, say, Genny Cream Ale."

"Overall - Blah... just a basic lager. No hops to be found and zero citrus etc. Not something I'd buy again."

"O- This beer has some nice flavors that are a bit soft and muted but a nice dry woody hop flavor makes it easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The hops are more evident in the taste particularly at the end, which gives it a little more character than the typical pale. Otherwise bready malts and some sweetness in the flavor. But it went down very quickly so it is easy to drink."

"This is a really smooth and easy drinking pale ale. Nice hop character in a noticable, yet milder way. At least in comparison to most of the stuff out there. Very easy to drink. I'm halfway done before even realizing it. Don't know why this one has such little love. I guess it isn't obnoxious enough with the hops. Regardless, I definitely like it."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 6/27/2013. Pours hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, floral, pine, grass, spicy rye, caramel, bread, and toast. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and hop notes with decent strength; very unique aromas. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, pine, grass, caramel, light rye spiciness, bread, and toast. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, floral, pine, caramel, light rye, bread, and toast on the finish for a bit. Good complexity of hop and malt flavors; with very balanced hop/malt flavors and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale ale. Good balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"This pours a hazy golden yellow color with a slight, off-white head. The aroma is filled with hops but fairly mild ones, not quite to the extent of an IPA. The taste is weaker and thinner than I expected. There is a decent bitterness to the beer that delivers flavor without being overly crisp. It’s fairly average and could use some work."
""
"Pours a golden orange color with firm cap of white froth, good lacing. Notes of dried grain, floral and grassy hops appear before a firm sweetness shines through. Taste is grainy and grassy, lightly floral and sugary sweet, moderate fruitiness, faint earthy spice. Medium bodied, some heft and graininess for a pale ale. Solid beer, unique composition."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light, thin, bready, medium carbonation, crisp, missing many key flavors. Refreshing and nice, but not right for the style. Too relaxed. Bitterness is extremely mild. Recommended only for HOT days.."
""
""
""
""
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grass, spice, pine, pine hop, and subtle citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, fruit hop, banana, and bread. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I really enjoyed how the notes of citrus in the nose and the banana in the flavor were incorporated into this brew. These slight little subtleties definitely took this one above average status for the style. I just wish there would have been more things going on if I am honest. This one definitely has a lot of potential with some subtle tweeks. Glad I got to try this one and would likely do so again."

"Good color but a little bit cloudy. Nice hoppy smell, but very light. Not that it's an IPA, but I expect a little more of a hoppy scent in a Pale Ale. Fine mouth feel - not a too bubbly and also not too light either. As for the taste though - it tastes pretty strongly like malt extract. Not sure why that's the case, but it's a little offsetting. I don't expect outrageous amounts of hops, but in my opinion this beer is way too sweet for the style. In general I like Left Hand, but this is not my favorite Pale Ale - probably won't get this one again."

"Overall: It’s good…a nice APA that does have a bit of a unique twist on the idea…the bready malts are flavorful and does make it something different…it’s good, very drinkable and enjoyable…it’s not revolutionary by any means, but does what it does well… a six pack is nothing less than what this ale deserves…(3.5/5)"
"On tap at Left Hand. Pours a light golden. Clear. Small head. Light and crisp. Some citrus hops. Light bitterness."
""
""

""

""
""
""

"Overall: Better than I thought it would be, this random X-Mas gift beer turned out to be a winner. Not quite Alpha King, but I would certainly drink it again over many of the same old, lame domestic options you always seem to get offered."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The mouthfeel and subdued hops make this very drinkable to me. Just above average pale ale."
""
""
"Cheers!"
"This beer pours hazy golden orange with a one finger white head, good retention. The beer doesn't have much on the nose at all. It has a very faint fragrance that matches the taste. The taste is well balanced for a pale ale but lacks in strong flavors. There is a slightly bitter hop presence but it doesnt do much. The feel of the beer is quite nice, it has a heavy and thick feel for a pale ale and it goes down quite smooth. Overall, this is a pass, I think if you can get your hands on this then you can get something better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't appreciate the toasted malt that was pretty forward in the flavor, but the rest of the flavor notes were good. This isn't a bad beer by any means, but it's not one I'm going to pick up again."
"Worth checking out."
"3.63/5.00"
""
""
"Atmosphere is really solid. Great head, and some thick persistent lacing. Nose is piny and spicy. Flavor is slightly piny, and has a more metallic character to it. Washed-out and shallow. Overall, this is a pretty decent quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pale yellow/orange, very hazy appearance. Short white head with decent lacing. Pale malts, sour apples, grapefruit and wheat grass. Soft hop aroma is also present in the aroma. First sip is a sour, bitter pinch of hops and citrus fruits. The rest of the body doesnt really even out at all, remains very bitter and sour throughout. Sweeter, drier finish. Possibly bunked, quite average if not."
"A mild APA with a good balance and pleasant aftertaste. A solid ""sessionable"" APA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – It was very easy to down with a moderately nice flavor. While a good session beer but it is nothing all that special."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - When I want or randomly crave an IPA or APA (which isnt usual...) I will get one of these."
"O- It's a solid pale ale, your not going to be disappointed or blown away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A pale ale that I find average. Nothing worth seeking or returning to. The balance is not superb, which is what I see in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's just not that much of a good beer. Nothing stands out and it's not something I'd have again."
""
""
""
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is full of orange citrus and biscuit malt, with some light pine notes. The flavor has a lot of bitter pine as well a some light orange citrus. The biscuit malt keeps the bitterness low. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O-Decent beer, easy drinker. Would like a little more hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"3.5 D: Good enough, but I feel like I missed the cask experience."
"O- This was a fairly average Pale Ale. Easy to drink, sessionable, but nothing spectacular. Nice lightly sweet honey taste but not too strong or complex in aroma or taste. Probably one of my least favorite Left Hands I've had, but not bad for an offering in a mixed 12-pack."
""
""
"O - Pretty good, sweeter and maltier than expected. I certainly wouldn't hesitate to pick up a sixer of this if was sold locally. Overall I would say it's above average, but not phenomenal. Certainly a good session ale. I wouldn't mind throwing a couple of these back in a row, and the flavor is inviting enough that it's easy to do so."
""
""
"O: This was a pretty easy to drink beer that had a rather pleasant taste. I could definitely sit down and have a couple of these though I am not sure that it qualifies as sessionable (as I would probably only have a maximum of 2)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a better than average ale, and very drinkable/goes down easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - tasty refreshing could have several, the bitterness at the end is nice without being overwhelming - would have again"
""
"This is a very clear, copper-colored liquid, topped with a pale white head. The smell is more malty than expected...a pale malt, clean and sweet-smelling. The malt aroma has a nearly grist-like, malt-extract quality. There are moderate hop scents, herbal and just a little spicy. The taste is similar, but the hops shine through a bit more than in the aroma. The finish is a little dry. Low in carbonation. It's a reasonably good beer, fine for a session."
""
"Overall, it's kind of sessionable if you really are into a bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Malt forward APA, actually seems more like an EPA to me. Toffee malt is the main flavor to this beer. As an APA this is just average."
""
""
""
"O- Good brew, I found it lacking a little bit in the aroma though and it was a little better than average"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This pale ale is a little different and seems a little light. Its fairly drinkable but not very memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours out a fairly clear amber color with tons of cisible carbonation keeping a finger of head afloat. The aroma is full of sharp citrus and light hops, with a bit of caramel malts. The taste is a bit odd, but still pretty good tasting. It's got floral hops and citrus over some lightly metallic malts. The flavor goes as soon as it comes, leaving only the slightest aftertaste. The mouthfeel is crisp and light, and the drinkability is good. Overall, it's a pretty good pale ale. Nothing amazing, but it does the job."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of citrus hops, hint of floral hops, hint of pale malt, and a hint of grass. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, hint of floral hops, pale malt, and a hint of grass, and a hint of sweet malt. Overall, good appearance, blend, but lacking in body."
""
""
"O - A well crafted example of the style. Not exactly something I'd seek out but certainly one I wouldn't turn down if offered."
""
"Inital pop of the cap resulted in a momentary gush before the beer settled down. Pour was a light amber/copper. Hops up front with some herbal character, quickly giving way to a caramel malt. Overall rather mild, and not at all what I would consider an APA. More of a pale ale, with leanings toward the British more malt-centric side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I told them, no, that was just my beer. They offered to dump it for me. I told them it was supposed to taste like that (bitter). Hilarious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty bland and not special in any context. Easily drinkable as it is incredibly unoffensive and at 5% it's pretty sessionable. If you are looking for super exciting and flavorful this is not your beer though."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Clear deep yellow/tan color. 3/8 inch head with a bit of lacing. Head quickly dissipated. Smelled malt with a faint amount of hops. Hoppy pale flavor came through on first taste. Nice medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall a well balanced, above average pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing that wows me over, but nothing I'd refuse if offered again."
"Overall - Pale ales aren't exactly my area, but this one is pretty good compared to others I've tried."
""
"Overall a decent serviceable pale ale."
""
""
"Appearance is a straw color with half a finger of head that had no retention. There is a mild floral hop nose to this offering. Sweet malt is present upfront in this offering. That sweetness is followed by spicy bitterness in the finish. A decent effort, but a bit light for an APA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: It's very drinkable a nice bit hopppiness a solid beer. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy drinker, good for a few. Nothing special about this beer just an enjoyable Pale Ale to relax with."

"Yellow with a slight copper hue. Initially a thumbs width white head presents itself but it quickly disipitates into nothing. Some lacing. Sweet (malt) and citric (orange) aroma. I am wasn't expecting such a sweetness from an APA as it seems sweeter than some EPA's. That said, I am a fan. The flavor is sweet mixed with some citrus and it closes out with a mild bitterness. Again, I like it. A nice creamy, maybe kinda syrupy thickness to it and plenty of activity from the carbonation. I went into this expecting a relatively average APA and ending up finding it to be quite good.While it is a little straightforward and simple, maybe a little more layering to the flavor could have benefited it, but I do like it for what it is. I could see having an inflated opinion of this than others here might but, whatever, works for me and I look forward to having it again."
""
""
"a decent pale ale, a littler richer and sweeter than most. pours a really light fuzzy pale blonde color with a reasonable head. smells like candy hops, rock candy hops, with the flavor of sweet/tart hop. really nice evolution in the mouth, long finish, glory... a very very drinkable beer. goes good after dinner with a nice marijuana cigarette. whatever"
"Overall nothing I would seek out again it seems they do make some pretty nice stouts and porters."
""

"Flavorful, enjoyable and pleasing APA. Site says the style goes well with pungent cheese and salad and I can confirm this fact. Nice balance of more moderatly spiced hops and maple malts with a minor nuttyness adding some nice complexity and interest. Well crafted and a nice addition to the Left Hand line of brews. Well worth a try."
"Overall - Not bad, easy to drink, cheap price and decent avaibility make this a worthy drink. Nothing to special or groundbreaking, just a solid apa with enough flavor to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I like this beer but its nothing special. I is pretty easy to drink, I think it would be a good session beer."
"Overall, nothing really too impressive here but at the same time, I don't hate it. Looked nice but not too much smell, the taste was fairly decent though."
"Trying the Stranger American Pale Ale from Left Hand and would say this is a solid pale ale, but not spectaular. The beer pours a straw yellow color with floaties and a thin white head that is lacing. The smell....initially is a dry cheese....after a couple of waifs...there might be some hop. The taste is very subtle nothing crazy and nothing bad. Its just a solid beer. The mouthfeel is a medium body with good carbonation. Overall, again, it is a solid beer...certainly session it....but I wouldnt go searching for it."
""
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly. I would consider it to be sessionable if it had a stronger and more interesting taste."
""
""

"Overall (3.5): Very drinkable but not very flavorful. Won't go out of my way to pick it up again."

"Perhaps this particular bottle of beer sat around for awhile or maybe this establishment just doesn't sell much. In any case this beer really is not that impressive. An APA should have a good hop bouquet both in flavor and aroma and in this case it was missing."
"Perfectly drinkable, but not a lot of flavor going on."
"O - Beyond the laughably ingenious name, Stranger isn't unique in the least bit. That's not to say it's a bad beer, however. Still good overall!"
"Beer is medium in body and sweet on the front, mildly bitter / dry at the back and the midpalate is more malt and a little pine hops. Not a great pale ale but a decent one. I had two bottles of it and I don't think I'll have much more."
"Not as hoppy as most APA's, but a solid beer. Easily drinkable."
"O- A nice, standard flavored Pale Ale from Left Hand. I could easily put back 3 or 4 on a relaxing night. The soft grassy, citrus and cereal grain flavors are tolerable. I think i like Left Hand's house yeast. It is superbly clean and really highlights intricate hop flavors well. A nearly perfect session pale ale, IMO."
"Poured this APA from a bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a clear , light orange color, it produced a decent white head, average retention and average amount of lacing. The aroma of this apa contains caramel, citrus, and toasted grain. The taste of this beer has a baseline of fresh baked bread, sweet malted grain, spicy rye, citrus, grassy hops. Medium in body, very drinkable, good session beer, excellent example of a craft brewed APA."
"Overall this was an average APA that I honestly thought seemed more British than American. Not sure I would seek it out again."
"Way better than I hoped, very drinkable APA. Well done Left Hand!"
"Pours a golden amber. I pick up a muted biscuit and light piney-hop aroma. It’s a heavy, filling beer—for a pale ale—and certainly holds up as it warms. British-style pale ale? Clean, clear finish, piney hop profile, nicely balanced. Get to know this stranger."
"O: Eh, I wouldn't buy this again. It's completely unremarkable and not cheap enough to justify buying it. There isn't anything negative to note, just exceedingly mediocre."
"A really delicious pale ale - looking forward to trying more Left Hand offerings."
"I'm confused."
"Picked up a bottle of this in a mixed sixer just because. Bottle date 8/25/2011 so this is not quite two months old. Bright orange-yellow color, decent lace. Smells like a hint of citrus hops and something undetermined. Taste is a bit of spice, is that the rye? Also has a hint of citrus to it and overall its not bad but its nothing impressive as far as pale ales go."
"This is quite a pale beer, the flavors are very bright. Those looking for a bold pale ale may wish to look elsewhere, but it is done well. The lightheartedness of this beer makes it effortless to drink, and is certainly sessionable."
"O- A relatively standard pale ale but it has good flavor and is easy drinking."
"Overall Drinkability - Enjoyable. Nothing memorable."
"O) A great brew overall. The visible sediment in a APA when it clear is not a style that is ""unfiltered"" is a bit of a turn off. Probably just a fluke with the processing."
"Poured into a 12-oz mug, this is a crystal-clear very pale beer with a moderately dense head. The nose offers some grassy, herbal hoppy notes, but they're not very assertive. The hops are even more disappointing on taste, with little bitterness for an APA and hop taste that doesn't offer much. Malt is very clean and light, and yeast character is non-existent. Glad I bought this as a single, and not as a whole 6-pack. I'd have a hard time finishing off a full pack of this uninteresting beer."
"Thin white head on a pale amber body. More pale than I was expecting it to be. It has a nice biscuity malt which I enjoyed more as the beer warmed. Citrusy hop aroma with a mild bitterness. This would be a good beer to grab at a bar as I wouldn't mind having several glasses of this."
"O: A decent, drinkable IPA."
"Not terribly interesting, but, damn, if you can't push it past your lips with the greatest of ease. And that's exactly what you want in a pale ale, isn't it?"""
"Good drinkability, on the verge of high drinkability; the second one I had flowed down very smooth and easy, and this could be a good session beer based on the balance. Nice flavor and an overall good APA experience, this was a solid beer and very enjoyable."
"Anyway. More Milk Stout for me when I order a Left Hand."
"12oz bottle. Pours a semi-translucent murky amber color with a thin layer of head. No lacing. Aroma is slightly citrusy and floral. A bit of grass and malt sweetness as well. Taste is on the sour side with some hop flavor but this does not really taste how I thought it would after smelling it. Hint of bitterness. Lightly carbonated. Thin mouthfeel. Overall, this beer is disappointing. It smelled really good but the flavor was a bit of a letdown. I'm all set with this beer."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer and quite drinkable. This beer is subtle, but there is nothing wrong with it at all. Though the flavors and such are subtle, it makes a good overall APA and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. It isn't the best one I've had, but it is definitely a contender."
"Pours a hazy straw amber with a quarter inch white head and almost no lacing. Aroma is sweet, of cherries, some spices, lemongrass, and yeast. Mouthfeel is light, very carbonated. Taste is of grass, some spices, some lemonpeel, yeast, and a metallic aftertaste. Fresh and tasty, but not altogether anything too memorable."
"I see what they attempted, but it just didn't work out."
"Overall a pretty decent APA. No huge complaints."
"O - What a great beer for the alcohol content! I love it. Plenty of flavor but you could drink it all day. Well done."
"Overall: Nice and sweet tasty pale ale. I could do a six of these.One of the better pales I have had in a while, although the bitterness really does not hit until the end."
" ~ This is a fine sessionable brew that does what its intended. An easy drinking pale is what it is."
"Pours light orange that poured a huge head that leaves three-eighths of an inch retained. Off-aromas. Initially orange and fruity and hoppy flavours, followed by lots of malt that took away. Decent drinkability, but a bottle is a lot. Decent mouthfeel. Could this be reqorked into a good hoppy IPA?"
"Overall, I would say I expected more from this brewery and their rendition of one of my favorite styles. In all aspects, this beer seems amateur. However, this APA may be a good transition for those who prefer UKPAs or for someone just getting to know the wonderful world of hops."
"Poured Clear, light straw pour with a huge foamy white head. Aromas of Light, bready malt with a bit of spiciness and light herbal hops. The flavor is grainy malts with some sweetness, leading to a grainy - peppery bitterness. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and kind of watery. Not a very good one from Left Hand. There are far more tasty Pale Ales out there."
"Decent summer quencher, nothing really special."
"This pours a light golden color, with a white head which lasts a few minutes. The smell is pretty light, grassy, floral hops with some grainy and bready malts. Feel is mostly light also. The taste is also somewhat light, I get the grainy malts, a little grassy notes and a light bitterness, there is also a light metallic taste also. Overall an okay Pale Ale, there are far better ones though and I won't get it again."
"The body is medium and carbonation is light. Smoothness comes in under a constant nip of crispness."
"Overall, drinkable but not much to get excited about for me. Might be a good transition beer for BMC friends. Avail here in TX. Rotation - usually love LH's stuff but this one just didn't grab me or make an impression. [N;O]"
"O: Highly recommended. If you're tired of SNPA and the like, you won't be disappointed with this one. Great example of the style."
"O- Treat yourself to an IPA and get some flavor."
"The beer pours out a clear light amber-almost golden color with a light head. The smell off the beer is light and bright with a playful variety of floral and piney hops. The taste is hopper than the smell would have you believe. You get a spicy herbal pine throughout the drink with a burst of citrus hops on the swallow. The drink also leaves a significant amount of residual hop oil on the tongue. My criticism is that it was lighter on the malts than my experiences with other APAs. The beer drinks pretty easily, but it's lightness on malt balance may render this beer more of a hop-head's ale."
"12 oz bottle into a pint glass...have never had this before. Pours a bright golden with a fine but not massive head. Smell is malty, with a fruity bit of subdued hops. Taste is quite mild and very smooth...this could almost be termed a mild ale. Mouthfeel is excellent. Very refreshing beer, well put together and highly sessionable. If you think you're going to find a brew to make you stop buying Alpha King, this isn't it, but if you like to keep a few different kinds of pales in the fridge, this isn't a bad one to have around, it is better than most."
"O - Very drinkable, very refreshing with a decent taste. Overall... I like it. Good alternative to summer ales on a hot day"
"This is an awesome APA, and I could definitely drink a ton of it. It has plenty of hop and malt character in the aroma and flavor to keep me interested, while remaining superbly drinkable. Bravo."
"O- A very drinkable pale ale that is very nice on a hot summer night. Gives Sierra Nevada Pale Ale a run for its money."
"D- Due to the light nature of this brew, I could drink this one all day."
"Light mouthfeel that is very drinkable. A little more hops in the flavor would make this a top notch Pale Ale."
"Very nice lighter ale."
"Overall Impression- I'm surprised this is a brew from Left Hand! Not impressed at all! Too light and not enough hop characters to be an APA. This is more like a English Pale Ale... I'll keep drinking my Milk Stouts."
"Has a strong, malty, slightly fruity, and surprisingly hoppy aroma, almost more at an IPA than an APA. It pours a clear and typical golden with a fairly thick and frothy white head. Flavor is smooth, malty and slightly fruity, a bit on the watery side but still acceptable. There was almost none of the hoppiness that the aroma promised in the flavor, but there is some in the aftertaste. Texture is fairly smooth and somewhat tingly. Somehow it gets a little better as you drink it. Not Left Hand's best, but worth a try."
"This is a nice tasty APA but nothing outstanding. Just an overall easy drinking APA."
"Picked this one up the other day as part of a mixed six pack. While finishing up Camus' The Stranger the other night, I went to grab a beer and this one jumped out at me. Gold, with a white head. This one smells like pot and pine, somehow pleasant and not-so-pleasant at the same time. Medium bodied, with flavors of toast and piney hops."
"Bizarre, I have to assume this one is bad, because Left Hand is better than this. Too bad I can't get another here to compare."
"O - This is a nice APA. I've had better but this is a nice one to have around on a hot summer day."
"Notes: This light to moderate-bodied pale has some really unique flavors, and is remarkably drinkable. Left Hand has always put a solid effort towards their beer. This, like the others, is another example. Well worth trying."
"I don't think the Stranger is bad, but I'm not in love with it. Doesn't have enough to be an IPA, but maybe a bit more than what a standard Pale Ale should have. At least it's aptly named."
"O- a good session PA @ 5% ..i liked this one it had a nice floral hop profile that i like will buy some more singles of this"
"O - pretty good, I like a good pale ale. I haven't had one in a while and this really hit the spot."
"I think this is a good session APA that is just simple, straight-forward sessionably good."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are all nice and powerful-enough and the beer is far from empty. The hop profile is pretty nice and the malt balances nicely."
"Overall, this makes a good session pale ale. I like the fact that it isn't overly hoppy like some APA's. If I'm in the mood for something really hoppy, then I'll drink an IPA. I could drink a 6-pack of these watching a football or hockey game."
"D - Very nice APA; brewer went for a home-run hop hit with this beer and was successful; try this, you'll like it"
"Overall, merely okay and not what I like in a pale."
"A light beer that's full of flavor? Stranger wins. Perfect summer sessioner."
"Bottle. No date on this one that I could find. Poured into a New Belgium tulip style glass a clear, honey golden color with a slight off white head that has a pretty poor retention. The head does collar slightly around the glass. The aroma is a slightly skunky citrus note that like over ripe grapefruit and orange. Medium mouthfeel. Muted citrus flavors with a slight sweetness. Rather bland in flavor to be honest with a minimal hop presence. Even in the back end there is minimal flavors. Overall, this is a subpar APA that I would not consider buying anytime soon."
"O – There was just nothing noteworthy about this brew. After trying a “Sawtooth” earlier in the day, I was wildly disappointed."
"O - A very well balanced pale ale and so far one of my favorite Left Hand offerings."
"O- Solid pale ale and quite enjoyable. The name makes me chuckle..."
"D: Nothing wrong for sure, but not real special. Kudos though for good balance and drinkability."
"D: Impressive. A solid APA that is reasonably priced. This will merit regular consideration."
"D: While this is a drinkable beer, it's not something I'd choose first."
" The Pale has a taste that is good with mild hop presence up front which is semi-bitter and light herbal flavors coming through with subtle toast notes from the malt w/ bits of grassiness and slight citrus quality. This APA is good overall, one I would try again on draft. This bottle was sufficiently fresh and the flavor hops came through nicely, not just bitterness."
"D: Decent drinking apa. I could go sixpack here, making for a decent session offering toned just right hopwise to enjoy in multiples."
"Pours a nice, bright amber with a somewhat thin head. Smells somewhat juicy with notes of tangerine and orange and a hint of graininess. Fairly dry and grainy in the mouth with a little of the citrus but not nearly as much as in the nose. A late grainy bitterness rounds it out. Reminds me of an austere style of cracker- maybe a Wasa cracker or something. Not bad, but a bit too dry and grainy."
"overall - lefthand delivers again - a flavorful pale with low abv 5% that is very drinkable"
"Overall, I didn't really care for this. It had good bitterness for an APA, but I don't really like biscuity malts or grassy bitterness."
"It has a smooth aftertaste and good all around balance. It would definitely be OK to buy this again as long as it is not too pricey (I think it was OK)."
"Overall, a decent pale ale. Nothing out of this world, but pretty easy drinking. Not bad. A bit dry."
"O: nice drinkable pale ale, decent malty character with good balance. I was searching for more aroma."
"Decent to taste and easy to drink, this is not a bad beer. However, I am finding it rather forgettable, so if it does not cross my path again, eh, such is life."
"(12oz bottle from Total Wine). Pours crystal clear dark yellow with white head. Good carbonation. Aroma of cardboard, florals and butterscotch. Taste is mostly metallic. Infected or just this bad? No redeeming quality to this beer. Pass. This was a terrible beer."
"Lightly sour, the malt is very dry. There is a neutral bitterness than fades quickly in the aftertaste. Astringent and earthy. The body is as to be expected."
"Taste-Toasted malt, faint citrus hops. Very clean finish. Nothin' fancy here, all understated flavors much like an English pale ale. Would make a nice entry-level pale ale."
"Brewed on 3/11/2011, my birthday...beer pours out a golden straw color with lots of bubbles and a quickly thinning head. The smell when you crack open the bottle is a good old resiney hop whiffs. Smells nice and fruity. The taste is somewhat dry, clean, mildly fruity, some faint aspirin bitterness. I can detect a crisp spiceyness from the rye, nice touch. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly and quite carbonated. You know at first I wasn't blown away by the this beer. I agree, it is a more ""light"" beer than a lot of brews on the market. The hops are actually more aromatic than bitter flavoring. But smell dominates taste, and right now I am on my last one (first one today) and I will be tempted to buy more someday. Overall a refreshing beer that is highly drinkable, just not extremely complex."
"Overall: Well-balanced and keenly drinkable, without ever giving too much or too little maltiness or aimlessly wandering into being an IPA with excessive bitterness. A good replacement of Jackman's. Good-bye and good riddance, Jack."
"This beer poured nicely into a pint glass. The head stopped perfectly at the brim of the glass. The appearance was bubbly and golden yellow, white fizzy head that settled rather quickly. This beer has a fairly nice aroma of some light pine and citrusy fruits on the nose. The taste was kind of hit and miss. Some sips were better than others. Some were hoppy and other were more earthy. It was odd, but the beer is decent to say the least."
"Sessionable in a cookout/volume sense, but that's it. I won't go to this again."
"The flavor is very pleasant, somewhat delicate, a slight bit thin. There are some citrus florals in the malt, plenty of piney hops, but nothing too biting or estery. There is a bit of grassiness to the beer, and a slight rye like malty dryness. This is a good beer and the piney hops play very nicely with the dry malts, and the floral notes. The beer takes a bit of time to settle and it may have a touch too much of the perfumey alcohol note. It's a touch thin, but this beer is good."
"This beer pours a clear copper color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit with hints of pine and caramel. The taste is of grapefruit. There is a nice bitterness up front, but it vanishes quickly. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a watery texture. Overall, this beer is very one dimensional. It isn't really all that bad, but it isn't really good either."
"Ho-hum another average pale ale, oh well. I will admit this beer is balanced but the flavor as a whole isn't too pleasant and that just makes this simplistic in its approach. Props on the name ""Left Hand Stranger", bahahaha, oh grow up already."
"O - Not too bad, but not incredibly memorable either. My overall impression of this is that it would make a decent beer for having more than one, but not the greatest for sitting back and just enjoying a complex beer since it's not overly complex."
"O: Overall it is nice, it has some good flavors, but I almost feel it is overshadowed by the bitterness. Good, but not great."
"Finish: Grass and a small amount of floral hop"
"O - I like it for what it is, a pretty tasty APA with a low ABV. It's refreshing and has a pleasing flavor with enough bitterness in the finish to keep me interested. I'd like to try this side-by-side with a Victory Headwaters. From my recollection of that taste, I think I like the taste of this Stranger better."
"DB- A interesting pale ale that drinks pretty easily. The fruit flavor is different from almost any beer that I have ever had and refreshes me quite well. Worth a shot."
"O: Stranger doesn't make a great first impression, but it comes into its own with biscuity maltiness and floral hoppiness. Solidly above-average APA."
"An average APA from the folks at Left Hand."
"While this isn't going to blow your socks off with a flavor assault, a 6'er of this would be welcome almost anywhere. There are plenty of good big/bold pales in the area, and I appreciate how LH took a different road."
"Delicately balanced, but with a lot of unique flavor to keep you searching through the whole pint. It's not one to punch you in the mouth, but the craftsmanship on this one is pretty marverlous."
"To sum up, a decent, drinkable pale ale with a little rye to set it apart. And you can make dirty jokes while you drink it."
"It is always to good to have a bottle of ale you know is fresh. There is nothing extraordinary here, but it is flavorful and quaffable."
"Finishes semi-dry with a hint of citrus bitterness. Fuller bodied than expected, with adequate carbonation, but this is quite forgettable. There's nothing wrong with this beer, let me make that clear, it's just boring. Not recommended, seek out better sessions beers."
"I thought about Terrapin/Left Hand when reading they made a new pale with rye in it. This one appears a pale copper hue bright brilliant crystal clear body. Head forms nicely, fine speckled lacing that sticks evenly with each sip to my DFH pint. Aroma spicy rye with citric/pine hops going on this is a nice straightforward drinking hoppy RyePA. America say goodbye to Jackman's Pale Ale and say hello to Stranger American Pale Ale. Adds a nice level of complexity to an APA, crisp bitterness cuts through the body...citric/pine/spicy rye comes off iniitally as the beer warms a nice caramel spiced breadiness flavor comes around. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied evenly carbonated goes down smoothly, right at 5% abv will work for an American session ale for sure. Drinkability overall is excellent, complexity flavor and quality come to mind with my first few samples of this newly released Left Hand Pale Ale. Good choice the last six of Jackman's I had wouldn't go away I'm glad this was at the beer store this weekend."
"All around its considered an American Pale Ale but its not textbook. Had it on draft before liked it alot better. Love the name!"
"D: I wish I bought a 6 pack for myself! This is a pretty basic beer; however, Left Hand nailed it in terms of bottling a light and tasteful beer. Definitely worth the buy."
"Aside from the label stating that this is an American pale ale, it is not as crisp or as neutral as American pale ales should be. Nor does Stranger exhibit the sharp and citrus bitterness of classics like Sierra Nevada's pale ale. But as an English pale ale, the beer fares well- with or without the spicy rye character."
"Had a bottle at Liberty St. Tavern. So this is supposed to be a rye pale ale. I'm not sure if I could pull that flavor out, but overall this is a nice, fairly sessionable pale ale. The hops bring a mild, floral citrus character with a hint of spice. The barley has a standard (for the style) sweet bready taste and a touch of caramel. Check it out for new session ale."
"Excellent beer and totally drinkable. I would like to have this on draft somewhere soon."
"Drink and overall: Very enjoyable. I could drink this all night, and not have to sacrifice flavor. Very drinkable."
"My first beer from Left Hand (not sure why it's taken me so long), but not a good start. I've given up breweries before after two disasters and that was a mistake, so I'll give them a few more shots. We'll see."
"D- Good for a go, but no mo."
"Overall, I wasn't expecting much going in but this was a pretty solid take on the style. Full bodied, well balanced and flavorful making this a pretty good sessionable beer."
"D: This is a nice APA that fit in well with the warm late winter day I had it on."
"Clear pale orange in body with dissipating white head. Sweet aroma of lemon, wet grass, hops, and slight bread in the background. A surprising hit on the palate: bread gives way to grass, lemons, sour fruit skins, and window cleaner to finish. Light in body with light carbonation. An unbalanced, unappetizing pale ale with no real characteristics to praise."
"Pours a golden yellow with minimal lacing and head and tiny bubbles around the edge. A lemony grain smell. Not to hoppy but pretty good for what it is. Carbonation was a bit off but can attribute that to the growler. Very easy to drink and will get a couple bottles if it goes to bottling."
"I found it quite drinkable, offering a surprisingly unique character; and a flavor level that sets it just above some without slipping into almost IPA territory (as some others tend to do). Well done!"
"Pours a golden yellow. a bit hazy with a fairly good amount of head. looks decent enough. Smells very hopy. Lots of citrus and grapefruit on the nice. Reminiscent of half acre's pale ale. smells pretty good. Tastes very similar to half acre. The hop profile is very similar. Less hoppy than I would like but for a pale ale its solid. a great hoppy beer especially for left hand. Good mouthfeel and very drinkable"
"D-very drinkable. Pleasantly suprised."
