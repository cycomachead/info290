"Nice hoppy beer that is only slightly bitter. I can see why some call it a session pale ale. Nice grapefruit smell/taste. Clean and refreshing throughout. My personal favorite from New Glarus."

"A hop-forward APA from Wisconsin.  Very tasty, although just a touch thinner than I'd have preferred.  Typical citrus-hop flavor, and well executed."
"cloudy yellow, foamy white head. A little whiffs of cidre. Some hops, very balanced. Somewhat tart in taste. Dry finish. Refreshing mouthfeel. Not very sticky or oily. Somewhat champagny"
""
""
"O-A very good APA, especially in the sense that is can be hoppy without being a full blown IPA."
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured into shaker pint. Golden body with a tall white head that leaves streaky lacing and hangs on stubbornly. Aroma is cracker malt, some grain, grapefruit zest, citrus juice, and grass. Taste is hop-forward bitterness featuring citrus zest, herbal bite, and grassy. A brief visit of grain on the swallow. Medium-light body, creamy texture, just less than average carbonation, dry hoppy finish."
""
""
""
""
"Nice dark yellow. Wonderfully balanced floral and citrus hop smell. Unbelievable smooth, melon, grapefruit, malty backbone just a ever so faint hop bitterness. One of my favorite session APA's. A+"
""
""
""
"Love the flavor and taste of this beer. One of my top three favorites"
""
""
"Favorite New Glarus offering.  The best beer typically found in their variety pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I is say it was above average but not the best."
""
""
"A fantastic pale. Great aroma. Taste is very good, really nice hop profile. Light, drinkable, was definitely the best beer in their variety pack."

"Moon Man by New Glarus is a great, flavorable, easy drinking pale ale with just the right amount of hops, but not too hoppy!  If you are the type of person who likes a little more flavor and feel to your beer, but maybe don't care much for strong IPA's, give this NCPA (No Coast Pale Ale) a try, I think you will be pleasantly suprised!  Another great beer from the best midwestern brewery in America, New Glarus.  Just remember you can only buy New Glarus beers in Wisconsin, so stock up when your there (as I do) or have a friend grab some for you whebn passing through!"

"Nose: spice, grain, clean malt, graham cracker. Pours brilliant gold under a 1‚Äù white foam cap, Palate: big malt and graham cracker with fruit in the background, spice and a dose of caramel, finishing with a medium hop emphasis. Medium boy and carbonation. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"While nothing earth shattering, this is a pleasant, enjoyable, and eminently drinkable pale ale.  Probably wouldn't take this over a SNPA, given a choice, but nonetheless, this is a tasty APA."
"Nice smooth light IPA can drink a lot of this"

"I consider Moon Man to be the benchmark of other Pale Ales.  I have had on tap at the brewery and in the bottle -- always delicious!  The citrus hops in this beer really shine.  It has the perfect balance that keeps me going back for more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at the a Tipsy Cow. Poured with little head. Nice fresh citrus smell. Light refreshing taste. Some flavors of mango and pineapple. Pretty good."
""

"This is one of my favorite beers. The mixture of hops are refreshing with a slight fruity flavor. Whether it's a hot summer day or a chilly autumn one, this beer is perfect."

"o:  Nice pale ale."

"O:  Like I said above, one of my favorite APAs.  Its hop forward for sure, but there's just enough bready malt to keep it balanced and drinkable.  Great beer!"
""
"My rating may seem excessively high, but considering the style, this is one of the best APA's I've ever had -- right up near the top. For that reason, it gets the rating I'm giving it. If you want a light IPA that doesn't taste like a light IPA, try a Moon Man."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to say for a pale ale, this was outstanding.  Great hop flavor without quite being in IPA territory.  Good toasty malt balance with a west coast hop mentality.  For advertising no coasts, I feel like Moon Man took the best of both coasts and put it all together into a great beer."
""
""
""
"An exceptional Pale Ale with a great herbal and citrus hop character. The hops also have a bit of pine as well giving complex American hop flavors.  There is  strong hop bitterness and have very little malt making for a balance that is firmly bitter."

"But I was wrong. The malt is so well balanced that the beer has a great, of almost a little weak finish. Mouth feel is a little thin, but it makes this beer very drinkable. Especially with a side of cheese curds."

"O: Overall, I was incredibly surprised by this brew. Moon Man is completely unassuming and a phenomenal representation of the style. APAs are my favorite, and this one is at the top of my list. Just a phenomenal beer. A nice malty presence that works nicely with the hops providing perhaps one of the best balanced beers I've ever had. If I lived in Wisconsin I'd be drinking this every day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - In a time when it seems everyone is coming out with a new session IPA, New Glarus' Moon Man, which seems like one of the originals looking back, (albeit a tad less hoppy) stands tall. Amazingly crushable, this crisp and delightfully - and delicately - hoppy beer continues to quench thirst and desire for full-flavored beer pint after pint."
""
"Overall: An incredible APA and one I would very highly recommend. On the lighter end of the color and hop spectrum, and to great original effect."

"Moon Man has been a favorite of mine since the day it was released. The hop profile simply shines. In short it's aromatic, juicy, and immensely drinkable. I look forward to each trip up Nort' just to load up on Moon Man."
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A lovely pale ale from New Glarus. Refreshing, balanced and very enjoyable, just enough hops to impart a nice array of flavors but not enough to cripple the beer with bitterness."
""
""
""
"O: one of the best american pale ales i've had. so much flavor, yet so light and crushable. inhale deeply, crush, and repeat"
""
""
""
""
""
"Simply one of the best beers I,ve ever drank. It has turned me onto American Pale Ales and I,m very excited to try more beers in this catagory to compare. I enjoy this beer at many locations and times but standing at a hot grill with a Moon Man is my favorite."
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice pleasant Pale Ale that should be drank on a summer day. Really refreshing and the flavor dies off fast leaving you wanting to take another sip. My only complaint if their was one is that the flavor is not quit as strong as what the aroma was suggesting. If you want a nice refreshing brew on a hot day and you like the hopped up beers give this one a go and you will not be disappointed, Cheers!"

"Bottle poured into a pint glass (from a trade). Pours a nice golden color with a half finger of white foam. Citrus scent with a small amount of malt. Citrus fruits up front with a small amount of maltiyess in the background with a light amount of light pine notes. Very smooth and light with malt that balances well with the hops. Very easy to drink and with a lower ABV this is an easy beer to have a few of. Very good offering from a Brewery I wish I could get more often."

"Bottle poured into a New Glarus pokal. Clear, pale golden color, with a small white head that retained well and left sheets of lacing on the glass. Nice looking brew. Clean, fresh aroma, pale malts and citrusy hops, light floral/grassy notes. The taste was a bit more thinned out than the aroma would have led me to believe, but it was still good overall: crisp and clean, light citrusy and floral hops, and some sugary pale malt sweetness. Light-medium body, easy drinkability, nicely balanced, with a very mild bitterness. A good, simple pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very, very drinkable. The mouthfeel on the finish really keeps you sipping on this one. This is much closer to a pilsener than many of the pale ales that I have typically enjoyed the most, but the malt profile is also much less wheaty and prominent than the pale ales I have enjoyed the least. This finds a unique space and nice balance for itself, and is really a nice beer. I'd probably not seek this out specifically in trade, but would absolutely purchase it as an everyday sort of beer if it were readily available."

"The aroma that I get from this beer is very interesting - others note fruit, and I get a little of that, but honestly the thing that sticks out to me is a kind of aroma of cheddar. (Not saying that just to make fun of Wisconsin.) This, by the way, is not a criticism. It makes me want to run up and grab a block of cheese to serve with it. Hop scent is muted, I can't pick out the varieties, but with a little swirl of the bottle, there's some pine and a little floweriness coming through. It has a good robust feel in the mouth, with some maltiness for balance at the end. I do not get a particularly clean finish from this beer, but I think that's OK, as it really is begging to be consumed in quantities greater than one. All around a good, solid brew from New Glarus."

"O: A great session pale ale for sure. an interesting balance of flavors that is more complex than i expected. /87"

"Overall, the best thing about Moon Man is his nose. This aspect of it really showcases the five varieties of hops used here, each taking a bit of their own turn in the spotlight, while appreciating the collaboration of the event as well. The flavoring followed well, but lacked a certain punch and zing so favorable to the aroma. This was likely helped along by the lightness of the thing. The feel is exquisitely clean and airy, bordering on thin and watered at times, but saved by the fullness in flavoring. To reiterate what is advertised on the bottle, drink this one fresh. You will get such a different experience. Perhaps that is one detriment, that its longevity is quite low. Either way, we are so happy to have finally sipped back on some New Glarus swill, and we are glad that this tasty offering was our initiation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste doesn't disappoint, although is more restrained in a way I suppose. The grapefruit notes are certainly present without question. There's a bready grain backing it up as well. What's remarkable to me is how there's basically no finish. It's just....clean. Nothing lingers. It's just cut off. Whether or not a person wants a crisp finish will determine if that's favorable or not. I found it incredibly easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An extremely excellent pale ale, that I'd recommend to anyone who is looking for an APA and has access to Wisconsin. One of the best ones I've ever tried."

"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Very clean, crisp and easy drinking. If it wasnt for the mineral notes across the nose, I would rate this higher. But as far as everyday easy drinking pales go, I would probably have this as a standby if it was available in my area."
""
""
""
""
"I may have just found my favorite American Pale Ale. I couldn‚Äôt stop smelling this beer at first. Very drinkable, I could see myself drinking 6 of these without notice; witch could be attributed to the light ABV. Cannot get this in Minnesota ‚Äì bummer."
""
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light golden amber with a one finger white head with good retention and lacing. Nice aroma of tropical fruit, citrus and light biscuit malt. Great mellow flavor of light sweet biscuit malt, lemon citrus, light tropical fruit with a mild hop finish. Medium bodied. This beer is deceptively subtle, with all the flavors somewhat subdued, but the balance and taste are quite excellent. One of the quieter, but most enjoyable pale ales I've had."
"O - This is a fantastic APA that is damn near the best in its category. For those who prefer the style without heavy bitterness, this beer does not disappoint."

"A no frills American Pale Ale. Does what the bottle says and doesn't pull toward any type. It's a quality, drinkable, pale ale. I would expect nothing less from New Glarus."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours semi translucent orange yellow with a white head. Smells of flowery and citrus hops, very sweet and very inviting. Tastes of earthy and citrus hops, with nice grain backbone. Beer is light/medium bodied with good carbonation very drinkable. Overall a very good beer."
""
""
""

"O - very nicely balanced beer, very nice hops notes, smooth taste"

"I was disappointed in the lack of malt. It tastes very much like a ""light beer."" I would of given this ale a much higher rating if the brewer would add more malt and give the beer more body. This would be a good summer drink and I might buy it again."
""
""
""
""
"Great pale ale - well done without any of the bells and whistles. Refreshing to say the least - I am definitely going to buy again."

"A very drinkable, ""session"" pale ale. (By the way, I like the humor of ""no coast pale ale"" on the label.)"
"O - Not a bad pale ale; but, you know the rest. Cheers!"
""
""
"Overall: Easy going mouthfeel, incredibly drinkable. Maybe my over stimulated palate just wanted more going on here, but overall this is a solid brew. Not one of New Glarus' best offerings, but worth a try."
"It's sessionable and a flavorful one. I like it. Wish my sampler pack had more of these in it!"
""
""
""
""
"O: A clean and fresh-tasting pale ale. Very nice."
""
""
""
"O-This is nice everyday beer. It is quaffable, but not boring or insubstantial, and the 5% ABV allows for more than one beer in a sitting without trouble. Its a true session beer. That being said, I keep getting an off-putting onion note that creeps in with every other sip that drags the smell and taste scores down. Without that goofy note, this would rank much higher in my book."

"Very sessionable."

"Goes down quick. Lakes region really seems to know their way around a hop cone."
""
""
"I don't know what's up with my taste buds, but I've got to downgrade this beer from 4.43 to 4.26. It's still an exceptional small beer. But now that I've had the greatness of NG Stone Soup, Moon Man pales somewhat."

"Overall an outstanding pale ale. Very much recommended."
""
""

""
"Straw yellow to gold in color. Brilliant clarity. An inch of white foam rests on top. Cereal grain aroma is prevalent. I get a bit of some floral hop aroma, too. That's pretty much what I'm getting in the flavor. The mouthfeel is fairly neutral. This is a pretty basic beer with no frills."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is really good. Taste is great, the aroma is juicy and woodsy. Very nice, and once again not overly done. New Glarus can make some damn tasty, yet simple and mild beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good! Surprised by this one, expected the hops to be more subdued. It's no IPA to be sure, but man this is a good balance of malt and hops, and the hops are definitely more about juicy and floral characteristics than pure bitterness. I'm impressed."
"This is an incredibly drinkable beer. Pours a beautiful dark golden yellow with a huge amount of head the dissipates somewhat quickly. The lacing sticks very nicely to the glass. The smell is has a mild resiny, citrus hop note to it with plenty of malt. The taste and mouthfeel is fabulous. Light, well-carbonated, with great flavor, but not a ""big"" beer. Incredibly drinkable. Mild hops that are only barely bitter, citrusy, and a great mild malt backbone. The only problem I have with this beer is that I do not have more on this hot day."

"Poured into becker pint glass; clear golden yellow with a huge fluffy rocky white head that leaves chunky lacing. Smell is light crisp bready malt, with lots of juicy citrus fruit hops, loads of floral scents as well. A delicious smelling pale ale. Taste is clean, crisp crackery malt with light citrusey hop flavors giving light bitterness to the nice clean, slightly dry finish. Mouthfeel is creamy-smooth, really fine carbonation. Awesome APA here, glad I got two more in the variety pack..."

"Moon Man is a fantastic pale ale. The aroma and the taste are both strong on citrus and floral hops, with a bit of crackery malt on the taste. Very drinkable and quite delicious. Wisconsionites are lucky to have this everywhere, especially during the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great, great beer. Wish it was distributed outside of WI. 5 hops, flowery nose, grapefruit-forward taste, little acidity, pale with a nice golden hue. Larger size bubbles form a great white top. Tasteful and reserved labeling. No ABV indicated on bottle."

"This missed the mark for me. Something about it is medicinal. It pours with virtually no head, and retains none. Hardly any nose either. I struggled to get past the medicinal taste but simply couldn't. Not sure if I got a bad bottle or what, but it certainly wasn't pleasurable and ended up being a drainpour."

"Overall, Moon Man is yet another well-executed beer from New Glarus. Nothing too unique but at a sessionable 5% this APA has quite a lot of flavor. They're not trying to reinvent the wheel here and that's ok. What they've done instead is created a tasty pale ale that's extremely well-balanced and incredibly smooth. I'm a huge APA and IPA fan but for some reason I prefer New Glarus' lagers and maltier ales to their hoppy beers. Still, this is a really enjoyable brew and a solid take on the style."

"Overall: A well executed pale ale. A definite summer time session beer."

"Citric hop flavors balance with toasted cracker malts and some unmalted barley flavors. The finish is very thin, almost watery palate it seems. Still a very drinkable, sessionable beer."

"O: A really easy drinking pale ale. Like most of their offerings, seems to have something really nice about their malt profile. Not as bold as I‚Äôd typically look for, but a nice pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This beer probably lost some of its hop profile due to it being brewed at the beginning of December. Still is a really nice beer. Really notice the nice bready aftertaste. This is probably a tad more pronounced since it is an older beer. Overall not too bad. Would be a nice pale oil to enjoy on a summer day. Not as harsh on the palate...as say a zombie dust."

"Pours clear gold with what at first seems like minimal carbonation but with a more vigorous pour a pretty, white head forms and never really goes away. Each sip seems to leave more and more lace on the sides of the glass. Hugely citrus aroma. I especially get lemons and a bit of grapefruit. The taste is full of citrus as well, suggesting a fresh leafy hoppiness that I quite like. The bitterness from the hops is somewhat muted but definitely there; it's just not as assertive as some other American pale ales. The mouthfeel is very soft and the finish is quite fruity and a touch dry. The citrus aroma and flavor in some ways reminds me of Three Floyds Gumballhead. All of these qualities make Moon Man an exceptionally drinkable ale."

"No date on bottle and I would guess this is over 3 months old. I had some earlier this year and actually had a score of 4.2. Friend of mine just brought these down. I would love to try another for sure but for right now it's nothing I would buy."
""
""
"This pours a clear, golden amber color with a slight off-white head. The scent is rich with bitter hops and that‚Äôs about it. The taste is fairly light and smooth. As far as the hops go, this is a very easy drinking pale ale. Moon Man is good the way it is, but boy it should would be amazing to see this beer with a little thicker volume and hopped up. Clean, refreshing, and delicious; just the way New Glarus makes ‚Äòem."
""
"I can't imagine a better APA than this. Super drinkable and sessionable. Huge grassy, piney, and citrusy nose right out of the bottle. The taste is sublime. All the notes of your favorite DIPA dialed down into a sessionable format. The mouthfeel is very round and easy to drink again and again. It's got just enough malt sweetness to appeal to folks that avoid hoppy brews too. I could stock this for the entire summer and be happy."

"a great great session beer, drinkable in every way. pours a relaxed pale color with a little more than an inch of white foamy head. the nose is balanced between american pale malt and bittering hops, nothing to distinct about the hops here. ale yeast is obvious, providing some toasted biscuit notes. the flavor too is quite yeasty for an american pale ale, and i like it in this case. bittering hops on the back end, fresh wholegrain toast on the front end. dry mouthfeel, average carbonation, and just a little thin in terms of body. there is nothing too unique about this beer, maybe the stronger yeast presence, but this is an all day every day kind of session beer, perfect in all seasons, at any time. a delightful beer to drink in high quantities."

"Picked up a sixer at Casanova in Hudson, WI. New Glarus calls this a session beer, and while I like my session beers less than 5% ABV, this is close enough. The flavor and aroma are very juicy with mild floral and tangerine. The finishing bitterness is relatively mild, really on par with some blonde or amber ales. The body is a touch light for a pale ale, but this is supposed to be more drinkable (and it is). Check it out next time you're in 'Sconie"
""
"Overall this is a great pale ale that rivals the west coast pale ales and IPAs. The body being small only helps it be a great drinker. The body and the malt character is a great platform that allows the hops to stand out in the delicate dance of malts and hops."

"Visiting the folks back in Wisconsin, I picked up a six of Moon Man. Not sure what Moon Man is all about, but hey, I'm in it for the beer. Nice citrus aroma, odd for a pale ale. The hops are up front in the flavor, some nice malt follows, then comes a watery finish. Overall, an easy drinking beer, but not up to the pale ale's available in the Colorado front range."
"the taste is... well... indescribable. perfect balance when it comes to the hops, malts and wheat-barley. my go to pale ale is summits e.p.a. most pale ales are either not hoppy enough or too hoppy and should be classified as an i.p.a. this is PERFECT in every aspect not only as a pale ale but as a easy to drink - everyday - sessionable brew. AWESOME. if there is a better pale ale out there... SHOW ME! I LOVE THIS BEER, wish i didn't have to visit my inlaws to get it, also wish that i could get this in a 12 pack instead of just a six! sooo gooody goooosh good!!! (whatever that means?) buy it! try it! love it!"

"I really like this beer. Happy I finally tried it - I could drink a whole lot of it. Smell is the definite highlight, but everything else works together quite well. Refreshing, smooth, and clean."

"12oz. bottle: This one pours a crystal clear golden color. There was a bit of an off-white head on it that didn‚Äôt linger long. Some lacing to it. The aroma is nice. Mainly a lighter pine and grapefruit hop nose. It has a very nice taste to it. a nice upfront flavor of pine and grapefruit hops, but not too strong or overly bitter. Medium bodied. Clean and refreshing. A good choice."
""
""
"Pours light copper, cloudy, with 1/4 inch of white foam. Hoppy nose. Swirling blend nose. Taste is a thin non-nonsense malt with a subtle hop bump. One of the lightest pales I've ever had. Simple, yet elegant. Quite good, actually. Simplicity counts for something."

""

""
""
"O - This beer could use a little better head retention. Piney hops could easily rival the hoppiest of double IPAs. I loved the citrus hop flavor in this beer. For a beer that labels itself as ""No Coast"" Pale Ale, maybe a little west coast. I thought this beer was super one sided with little malt character to restrain the hops, I mean that in a good way. I have to believe this beer has a lot of Simcoe hops. Thankfully,this will now be my go to beer as I am lucky enough to live in Wisconsin."

"O - one of my favorite beers. I wouldn't rank this among the objective best, but it's certainly got something I love about it. I'm disappointed that I won't be able to get it again for a long while, but I'll certainly pick up a few six packs the next time I swing through WI."

"Pours a deep, clear, clean yellowish color with fading head, and little lacing. Nose is complex, with clean bright fruit notes, some the standard citrus, passion, and pine, but some that I just can't easily describe and pin down--one of the more distinctive noses in a beer that I have tried. Tastes is light, malt first with assertive but not strong hop character, but under (as expected) and IPA. The balance is really terrific, somewhat dry and very refreshing. Mouth-feel is refreshing, the carbonation big, but not too, somewhat scrubbing, but not aggressively so. Overall a terrific offering and my favorite of the small hoard of New Glarus brews I've tried. Highly sessionable, I would think. Definitely glad I emptied my wallet on this, and would so again."

"Poured into a pint glass. Light golden color with an inch head. It smells of hops and grapefruit. The hoppy taste from the five varieties they include is what does it for me. Not bitter at all, fresh bright and drinkable. Honestly one of my favorite New Glarus beers. An awesome example of an APA."

"Pale straw color, clean with little head. Scent is pale and has some notes of citrus and freshly dried straw with a touch of flowers and sweetness. Taste brings a kiss of citrus, clean fresh dried grain, light fruity sweetness. Light bodied, touch low on carbonation. Maybe too clean of a pale ale for my tastes."
""
""
"Overall, this one blew my socks off. Went into it without any real expectations and was thoroughly impressed. As one of my first New Glarus brews, this one definitely makes a positive impression."
""
"It was a little thin, and didn't keep much head, but it's a perfect summer APA. If I was able to, I'd buy this all the time. I'm a big fan of New Glarus and am surprised that I havent had this yet. I try to stay away from new IPA's and APA's because there are so many that it's easy to be disappointed. This will not disappoint."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very nice beer. It is a bit light on the malt for a true APA, almost like a light IPA. While it is very drinkable, I prefer a bit more body and flavor in my APAs. I love the hop profile though. Never had an APA with so much grapefruit flavor. I would definitely drink this again. Recommended to any who can find it. Cheers!"

"Overall-This is an impressive brew from the usually spot-on New Glarus company. It is a choice beer for Spring and Summer, as its refreshing, citrusy, smooth, and, most importantly, drinkable nature screams to be enjoyed on the porch on a sunny 60¬∫ day. Additionally, because of its relatively low 5.0% ABV (by craft beer standards), Moon Man is a great session beer. As the label states, ""Don‚Äôt let this one lay around;"" it would take immense restraint to allow oneself to do so. 17.5/20"

"This poured out as a clear looking golden color with a thin white head on top. The head settles a bit leaving a white ring around the edge of the glass. The smell of this beer was much more impressive than I expected. The nose is loaded with dry hoppy citrus aromas. It smell wonderful honestly. The taste of the beer has a solid bitterness to it that is well balanced with the sweetness of the malt. The mouthfeel is crisp and dry with a lighter body and a solid carbonation level. Overall this is one of the best New Glarus beers I've had out of their year round releases. I would drink a ton of these if I could get my hand on them."

"Moon Man pours a light bodied very bright and clear yellow gold in color with a slight white lacing around the glass. The nose is very fresh and full of fruity hops. It has some nectarine and mango to it. I love it! The flavors too are very fresh and fruity. The hops are all over but not overbearing at all. There is plenty of fruit character with plenty of citrus and tropical fruit. It has low bitterness and Is pretty refreshing. The lighter body is perfect for this beer. It is extremely sessionable. Overall this is definitely in the upper echelon of pale ales. I see it as a great warmer weather pale, perfect for the pool or a cookout."

"Fresh hops and malt on the nose, smells and tastes balanced, but the hops are the star. Juicy citrus, with notes of orange and a bit of pine. Very easy drinker as it should be at 5%, not a sign of off putting tastes. This is a keeper. Hope it keeps coming out."

"O -- This is a really nice drinker that doesn't try to clobber you with hops or hop character, but your hop craving is satisfied. It goes down smooth and mellow and doesn't fatigue the palate. Glad I tried it."
"Colored like clear golden sunshine, with a persistant foam collar that leaves behind better than average curtains of lacing on the inside of the glass. Smells at first mostly of herbal hop / pine resin combination with the emphasis put on the herbals. As it warms, I can start to detect notes of a sweet malt in the aroma as well as a tiny whisper of cannabis hop aroma. I taste mostly citric peel, floral flavors mid-sip, and a soft-pedaled finish of gentle pine resin that lingers for a nice while. Just barely enough malt in the flavor comes through to balance, this APA is definitely hop focused. Texture is very creamy and smooth, medium-light bodied, with an extended finish that gradually dries out as it progresses. A better than average APA."
"Overall- A soft nose with a kiss of citrus, a laid-back and invigorating palate of sweet and bitter hop flavors, and a feel that instantly leaves you wanting more; Moon Man is a beer that is a privilege to slowly savor and abide with."
""
""
"O: I feel bad for hating on all of jegross2 beer so far. It‚Äôs an above average APA."

"Delicious - hoppy but balanced malt, never too bitter. The finish coasts on with a sort of Christmas spice note lingering. Not overly carbonated, which is good in my book - when there's real flavor in a beer, no point in hiding it. Possibly the best Pale I've had."
"Cost: $9.99 for a six pack."
"O. Like i said, it resembles a down scaled pliny. I would be very interested to try some of new glarus' IPAs, as i think a stronger version of such a beer would rival pliny. That being said, given that this a pale ale and not am IPA, the only thing i wish it had more of is aroma, but perhaps this is due to style as well. Great beer overall, and i will be hoarding the few of these in my variety pack."

"The beer pours a dark yellow color with a wispy cap of foam. Citrus and pine whack the nose. The hops continues to be the main theme on palate. Some malt notes counterbalance. The hops are aggressive and tasty, but a bit more interplay with the malt would be welcome. Overall, a good beer. Highly drinkable."

"Solid all-round offering here. Nice interplay of hops, both floral and herbal, well balanced with a bit of crackery malt. Surpisingly dry toward the finish, but without astringency or acidity.

"O- One of my favorite tasting pale ales. I could definetely do a session with this stuff...what a good session that would be."
"Overall: I love the smell of this beer, but the taste is a little thinner than the smell would indicate. But still a very drinkable beer and I could easily do a session with this one. A very decent APA."
"golden with a half-inch of white foam. Smell is slightly pine resin and a biscuit-like maltiness. Taste is more pine resins, nut bread and biscuits. Somewhat watery taste/body is unappealing. Body is light with ample carbonation. Overall is drinkable certainly, but there are far better APA's"
"This is a very good pale ale for long sessions or warm weather. I would recommend this to those whom are looking for a nice introduction to pale ales."
"I'd say this is definitely the better pale ale I've ever had, lots of character. It's a pretty gold color with a medium amount of carbonation. Aroma is dominated by hops and citrus. The taste has a large hop presence but it seems dryer than the smell, with little else noticeable. The body is good and it goes down a mild tartness that's pleasing. Another winner from the land of beer and cheese."
"O: This is a good, lighter bodied, lighter flavored ale that delivers a citrusy hop aroma and flavor that is not too overbearing. This is a very refreshing ale, I would call it a lawnmower pale ale even. A good beer to introduce someone to the hoppier side of the beer world or when you're in the mood for hops that won't ruin your palate."
"O: Very good stuff. I haven't tried that many APA's yet but this one ranks very high. Good stuff."
"Overall: Overall, this brew is a bit drier than I prefer for a pale ale, but not excessively so. The hop profile is wonderful, and this one actually closely resembles Half Acre Daisy Cutter IIRC. Definitely a highly-sessionable APA!"
"Overall it's a great APA, almost IPA level but not quite since it's not super bitter. Great tropical fruits, nice aromas, just enough sweetness, perhaps a touch more body would help, but otherwise very nice."
"It's slightly cloudy. A pale yellow with nice lacing. The bouquet is great. Floral. As is the taste. My son was drinking the same stuff as me, and his comment was that we should have bought more than two bottles of this. We could, and maybe drag a lot of it South with us when we head home in a couple days. It's great. I am beginning to like Wisconsin microbrews a lot."
"O - This is a delicious brew once again from New Glarus. It's easy to drink, tastes great, and would pair well with a number of meals. In addition, it would be a great brew for the game. Sadly, I believe this is still only available in Wisconsin. Check it out if you can!"
"Overall: In my eyes, this is Wisconsin's Daisy Cutter. It has that great asprin-hop quality in a session strength pale. Very good...but Daisy Cutter is still king."
"O- very refreshing and flavorful pale. Might be the best pale I have had."
"This is an eminently drinkable hop-forward APA, high on citrus and bitterness. If it were more widely available, it would be one to seek out when the craving for those flavors arrives."
"The palate opens with a blend of citrus flavors, a mild weed-like dankness, more intense than on the nose. The hop character is beautifully captured here, with a perfect balance between flavor and bitterness (for the style, at least). Orange peel, lemon, a little bit of a leafy/chalky character I usually find in Cascade-hopped beers are all present here.The mid-palate has a little bit of honey, graham crackers and some wheat-like flavor. While great up until this point, the finish is a little lacking. A little watery, this character is amplified by the lower level of bitterness and hop resin (even for an APA). Drying and moderately carbonated, with a wisp of alcohol and a touch of carbonic acid, this beer is thoroughly enjoyable."
"D - This is a pretty bangin' pale ale overall with fairly aggressive hop bitterness that retains amazing drinkability. A great session beer from New Glarus. I wouldn't expect anything less."
"O - A great offering and definitely a brew I will make a point of grabbing the next time I visit the US. I find it difficult to think that anyone could rate this as sub-par."
"Overall- A nice surprise, wonderfully delicious. Would love to find this one again and buy. Unfortunately unavailable in my area as my brother-in-law brought it back from Wisconsin on his visit."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation. This goes down very easily and is extremely drinkable. This could be a nice sessionable APA. Overall, not a bad brew, but nothing that blew me out of the water. This is nice for some football Saturdays but won't be grabbing it again on my next trip to Wisconsin."
"Pours light yellow with a decent head and great lacing down the sides. Smells awesome. Citrusy hops dominate the aroma. Taste is bitter citrusy hops. Light, but not too light with good carbonation. At 5% this is a great beer to have a few, definately doesn't taste like 5%."
"All in all, highly refreshing. Very drinkable, session beer. In fact, probably the best ""session IPA"" I've ever had. Wish I could get this all summer long. Perhaps the perfect beer for those early tailgates when the weather is still warm and you need a good beer that you can drink for 3 hours."
"I'm so glad this was included in my trade as it is one of my favorite NG beers. A hell of a pale ale that (again) I wish I could get regularly."
"Pours a sparkling golden yellow color, with a thick, fluffy white head. The aroma is hop dominant, with a fresh, fragrant combination of floral, woodsy, and citrus characteristics. The flavor is a bit more balanced, with an earthy vet vibrant hop profile being at least somewhat contrasted by some nice bready malt sweetness. The fine, soft carbonation only somewhat breaks up the resinous texture, but it isn't at light as I would prefer. Overall, I acknowledge that this is a terrific example of a hop-forward pale ale, but even though I do enjoy a good pale ale, I couldn't get too excited about this one."
"Nothing fancy? Maybe not, but delicious, super-solid and well-made all the same."
"Great pale, from Riley's in Madison. Generous retained head of three-eighths of an inch on golden yellow, and leaving spider lacing. Mild hop aroma. Incredible drinkability, I finished in three gulps. Pleasant citrus taste. Very sessionable. Very silky smooth. Highly recommended."
"O= Good beer for me it wasn't anything to special glad I had a chance to try it though."
"A super refreshing beer."
"First noticed the amazingly clear appearance as I poured this. Not much head on the pour. Very strong citrus aroma, with slight grassy tones to follow up the citrus. Hops weren't too strong on the backend, leaving a clean, simple aftertaste. Very drinkable."
"O-good, not overpowering hops to turn of a non hop fan"
"Very crisp, light-medium body with medium carbonation. All in all, very refreshing and an extremely sessionable pale."
"I think my ratings may seem high these days and I have about 20 more to put in from my DC Beer Week trip..maybe I'm not a diverse as I thought...but if you get the chance to try this nice well made Pale Ale (not IPA), I'd recommend it."
"Overall, I can see myself fridge'ing a couple six packs of this beer on a consistent basis when I want some refreshing and flavorful, and not wanting to drink my normal seasoning beer (Gumballhead). Worth a try, my favorite NG yearly 12oz-er's."
"When I first had this beer, it reminded me a more of an IPA, in terms of the hoppy flavor. But overtime Moon Man Pale Ale has really grown on me. Sometimes pale ales can be kind of hoppy, but bland and uninteresting overall. That's not the case at all here. Moon Man is a really flavorful and solid example of the style. Plus, at 5.0% abv, this makes for a great session beer."
"Easy drinking and balanced with a fabulous bouquet. New Glarus fully achieved what they were going after with this beer. This is neither West coast nor East coast. Uniquely Midwestern and a unlike any other pale ale that you've had before."
"Overall, one of the best APA's that I've had and another winner from NG. Easy to drink with great flavor. Highly recommend. Only available in WI so got from Ummagum. Rotation - if avail near me would be in heavy rotation. [H;Y]"
"Overall it's another fine selection from one of my favorite breweries."
"O: A nice little APA, especially at 5%. New Glarus continues to pump out solid beers. Would be a great beer to have as a fridge staple."
"Overall - A really solid Pale Ale. One of the best I've ever had. I'd gladly drink my fill of Moon Man any time."
"O) A pretty solid pale ale, that is easy drinking the whole way."
"Drinkability: POW! This one would take Alice straight to the moon without Ralph‚Äôs help. This is a truly excellent brew, though not hoppy enough for those far down the road to hop tolerance."
"This is just a dang good example of an APA. It doesn't try to blow you away but has a nice hop flavor without much bitterness. These are very drinkable, especially at 5%."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a pale golden with slight haze. Good head retention and some really nice lacing. Nose brings a bit of citrus hops with a light bit of grain in the background. Taste is citrus with a bit of bitterness. Some slight grain in the back, but no real malt character. Feel is a bit light and undercarbonated. I've had a better pale ale."
"-Cheers"
"O) A delicious APA. Wow! I will definitely be drinking another one of these."
"Great beer for my vacation up here in Chetek, Wisconsin. Every glass got better."
"Notes: Nice APA with plenty of hop flavor. Lemon, floral and grass flavors are strong. This results in a nice, crisp beer that is great for summer. Well balanced and overall just nice."
"Light body, just right for a pale, not a caramel bomb, ample hopping gave the beer a very refreshing edge to it. Only minorly bitter, much more hop mouthfeel than bitterness. Slight lemongrass edge to it, carbonation spot on. Very easy and enjoyable to put down. Very clean. Probably the best hoppy session not made in CA. Not overly dry, just right for style."
"I've had this beer about a million times in bottles and on tap, just now getting around to reviewing it. Appearance is golden with a decent white head. Smells of citrus, hops. Taste is a little hoppier than a lot of pale ales - and a lot tastier than a lot of pale ales. Citrus and pine, grassy freshness, malty too... just delicious. Mouthfeel is medium to light, refreshing. One of my favorite go-to beers, the moon man never lets me down."
"Golden-copper appearance, solid lasting head. Great citrusy hop nose, dominantly grapefruit. Malt is upfront with the hops, lending a note of crusty, rustic bread. Great palate, a really nice balance between citrusy/grapefruit hop flavors and bready malt. Has a slight floral/herbal quality toward the finish, something that reminds me of rosemary. Mouthfeel is medium-light, fairly dry. Has a more substantial texture than many pale ales, but it's still supremely refreshing. A great beer, one of my new favorite pale ales."
"The cpj"
"O- Until now, something this hoppy would not be sessionable. Very capable of scratching a hop itch, this is now one of my go to session beers."
"Comments: A great beer to get people introduced to the IPA style, as it gives a lot of hops in the nose and palate without much bitterness at all. (Consequently, for those hop heads that really want to experience the bitter, this might not be the brew for you.) What makes this APA stand out is the clearly pronounced aromas and flavors--hop and malt--that balance with such ease. Very few beers of this style can produce so much flavor with such smoothness."
"D/O: Similar to some of New Belgium's seasonal pale ales, this carefully-hopped blond ale drinks very easily but doesn't really try to grab the attention of the drinker. Like many of the more sessionable American ales, its fair complexion belies its pale ale heritage, but it is otherwise very appealing in its looks. Otherwise it is very stylistically true but never extreme."
"D - It's a Midwest session pale ale. The low sweetness and excellent feel, combined with the low alcohol, make this a great beer for drinking all day in the sun."
"Small, short-lived white head tops a golden colored brew, slight haze but mostly clear. Nice sticky hop scent, floral with a bit of grapefruit. Taste starts with a light sweet malt front, but is dominated by hops. Floral, grapefruit, a touch of bitterness. Medium bodied and pretty wet feel. Thats a handy little PA they put together."
"Overall a good session beer. I could drink a sixer of this in one sitting no problem. This would be a regular rotation beer if available in my area."
"Overall any fan of pale ale with some hop bite to it would love this beer. Thanks to my brother in law who lives in IL for bringing a few over."
"O: This is basically my go-to beer, and what I used to try to recruit people into the world of hops. Super drinkable. Was very glad when New Glarus made this a regular stamp in their lineup."
"Moon Man is easily one of the best pale ales I've ever had"
"And although I enjoy a nice high abv pale ale, the lower abv of makes this beer one where I can knock back a few in a row without getting too much of a buzz. Also, knowing that New Glarus beers generally sell for $7-$8 for a six pack, thsi beer is plenty affordable."
"Moon man pours a nice golden color that is quite translucent. A fingers worth of white head sits patiently. The aroma is citrus zest and a bit of pine and buttered biscuit. The taste is pretty bitter and hoppy. Citrus and pine a pretty bold. A sweet honey taste is balanced with the hop offerings. A nice crisp feel with a bitter dry finish. Drinkable and very tasty."
"Light bodied with a smooth light carbonation. Very easy to drink and perfect for a session beer or to have a meal. Refreshing and delicious, one of the best pale ales I've had."
"Overall a great easy to drink flavorful pale ale."
"This pours golden with active bubbles and nice foamy head. The smell is very potent...bitter and hoppy. The taste is most notably fresh, hoppy, and bitter. This almost gives you a sour candy sensation. The body is pretty light, but the crisp bite of this brew lingers and just adds to the refreshment that it provides. It has a strong, effervescent grapefruit flavor. This is the cold shower of beers, a welcome change to the usual over-syrup douchy IPAs that I usually drink. Seriously, this is a great beer with a fresh hop character that I have been craving, this hits the spot."
"O - Very drinkable, especially for this time of year. Very session friendly for the warmer months that lie ahead! Just a very well put together beer from New Glarus."
"Overall this is a winner. I love an easy drinking beer that's still heavy-handed with hops. It's alot like Gumballhead in that respect, but more well-rounded and cleaner. I'm going to trade for some more of this soon..."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer to drink for a whole evening."
"Chicago distributorship can go F themselves! When you have friends that travel to Wisconsin and are willing to bring New Glarus beers back it quite a blessing. The latest ""contraband"" bought into Chicago was Moon Man. The beer is a clear golden gem with white head. The smell is a smooth lemony/citrus which appeals quote nicely. The taste is dominated more by a sublte pine than citrus as one might suspect from the aroma. The beer is very easy on the pallete and could session all night long!!!!"
"O: A highly quaffable beer, New Glarus Moon Man manages to eek out an above-average grade for a style that doesn't have a lot of ways to be particularly good or bad. Very clean, well balanced, and refreshing. A nice beer overall."
"O - i would definitely buy a 6 this one, very pleasant surprise. i enjoyed this brew and its ease. I would recommend this to people feeling out the craft beer scene, good starter brew that goes down easy and is refreshing."
"Overall - very nice session beer, easy to drink. Solid example of pale ale, well balanced between hops and malt with no off flavors. Seems to be best when it's cold."
"Nice sessionable pale ale."
"D - Super drinkable. The flavors here are nice and balanced and far from empty, but the whole thing feels crisp and super refreshing. The finish is really nice."
"Overall I've had this beer several times and I really enjoy it. A nice, light pale ale with good citrus hop flavor that doesn't overpower. A very good session pale ale."
"O- This is a full hop flavored beer with nice complexity and very little bitterness, making it very drinkable. The fizz just got in the way of the hops at times."
"O: This is one hell of a pale ale. Sessionable, crisp, tasty, refreshing... the list goes on. This beer does it all without doing too much. I wish that they sold this down in TX because it would be a staple in my fridge. Aint no question"
"O: Wow. Not sure why I took so long to rate this. An amazingly refreshing APA. At the pricepoint...it is my go to APA. Taste as good a an English PA but with some fruity hoppiness....without going overboard. I'll take this over a Daisy Cutter or SN any day."
"Overall: This is a nice sessin beer with great balance, i will be enjoying on really hot days. A great introductory beer for someone curious about hoppy beers without numbing their palate with hop bitterness."
"O: New Glarus is an exceptional brewery and this is an exceptional Pale Ale"
"Overall a very mild ale. Quite sweet and lemony - reminds me of lemon drop candy. A little too sweet for my taste. Hops are mild, but very welcome as it brings some balance."
"Solid drinking session ale."
"D - Ther eis no date code that I can find on this bottle, but I imagine this has to be extremely fresh. Hops are intense and citrusy. This is great! I can't believe this is only a 5.0% APA...I'm a hardcore believer in SNPA as the benchmark for this style, but I think this is outstanding. Perhaps more of an American IPA in flavor but strength is lacking. Wow...I could drink this all day."
"This beer pours a nice golden color, with a good size head, good laceing. The smell weas of that of a grapefruit, and there was a nice hoppy order. The taste was a bit weaker, had the grapefurit and bitterness like most APA's, but had a very wet flavor, and pretty weak. Could have used a much stronger taste, it was a bit watered down. Overall not a bad beer, but weak flavor."
"D: Great drinkability. Lightly hopped, great balance of malt, nice and crisp."
"Pours a crisp clear orange with about a finger of a white, frothy head, slowly dissipating. Lots of great floral hops in the nose. A lighter hop taste than I would expect, but surprisingly deep and balanced. Some light citrus starts out, as it builds into a nice sweetness that fades into hop bitterness. I like this a lot better then the last 2 I tried from New Glarus. This and Fat Squirel so far are the 2 I liked best out of the 5 I have tried."
"Very drinkable will be purchasing again"
"O: Loved the look, especially the head, and nice smell. I had hoped for a little more pop from the hops, but overall it was very drinkable, and not unexpected from this great New Glarus representation."
"Drinkability: Now, if you were ever in need of a ""Session"" beer, this would be a serious contender. At just 5.00% abv this one was very easy to drink and I could see drinking plenty of these in any one instance...especially on a hot day and/or a cook out. Well done New Glarus. Your Moon Man was a shot in the right direction."
"D: Eminently drinkable. An amazing session pale. I'd love another and a whole 6-pack (got as a gift in a sampler - thanks to John Hanlon!) update: I bought 6 when I was in WI last and they were fabulous. Will buy again."
"D: This brew is phenomenal, no doubt the best pale ale I've ever had. This is exactly what I want in a pale ale. Very little room for improvement. Wow!"
"Enjoy"
"Great body and mouthfeel. Medium body, excellent carbonation and nice medium length hoppy finish. Superb drinkability."
"D - This pale ale was pretty good...I think it was a well balanced pale ale in the flavor...I was just put off by the ""fake"" fruit flavors...I am happy I was able to taste some New Glarus beers finally"
"The mouthfeel is appropriate for the style, as the light bodied beer has nice carbonation and comes off as crisp and light. The bitter peak is well covered by the malt and only a touch of sweetness and hint of bitterness remains through a clean finish. The beer could have just a touch more body, but the drinkability is enhanced by the light feel. A nice change of pace from the stouts and hop bombs I've been enjoying this winter. I've heard of lawnmower beers, but this was my snowblower beer today."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Drinkability: One of the most refreshing pale ales I have encountered; love the attenuated malt character and the citrusy hops; not over the top, not a challenge - just great to drink"
"Moon Man is a good flavorful beer. I drank it from the bottle so I'm not sure of the color. Went down very easily. A nice pale ale, not overpowering. I could definitely see myself having a few more of these."
"D: Twelve ounces down the hatch no problem. If this was available in my corner of the world, it would always see rotation in my fridge!"
"Love the theme behind this beer: It's not about being from one coast or the other-- just about being a quality beer. Prime example of the American Pale Ale style, it's incredibly drinkable."
"D: Glad I gave this another chance, refreshing session beer. Not a home run, but a stand-up double. (sorry for the baseball reference and I'm not even much of a fan) Excellent gateway beer for you timid friends. The ladies may be intrigued by the pleasant citrus aroma."
"D: Very easy to drink; not a session beer by definition but certainly one you could make a long night out of."
"D - Pretty high. Being only 5% I could have quite a few too many of these if it weren't for the dryness as I think it would get to me over time. Still a very nice APA."
"I'm not usually a pale ale guy, and I got one bottle of this as part of a christmas present, I could see myself buying more. Good stuff."
"12 ounce bottle sample- slightly murky light tangerine in colour with minimal head, some sticky lacing. Nose- floral hops. Taste- moderate hopping - tropical fruit , lemon and floral. Light biscuit malts in the background. Spritzy carbonation and nice drinkability. A good quaffer."
"Drinkability - Quite so. A very good beer, should have bought a couple of these."
"d - good beer but i was hoping for a little more hop kick to this one."
"Incredibly drinkable and clean! One of the most session able beers i have ever had"
"D - Scarily drinkable. My new favorite APA. Very well done, Deb & Dan."
"d-this is a decent APA but there are certainly better examples out there. I did not finish this 6-pack as quickly as I expected"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Slight head with just a bit of lacing. Yellow-gold in color, a tiny bit hazy. Smell is bright and full of citrus. The taste is full of grapefruit. The hops shows up nicely but isn't too powerful. Light bitterness, clean and dry in the finish. This is a well balanced beer that I could spend all evening with. A very nice pale ale."
"d 3.5-4 when this came out it was the only beer i regularly felt the desire to drink 3 of in a sitting. easygoing, teasing with its aromatics, a synch to down them much faster than intended. in a way it's very dumbed down, but when you might be getting in the mood for the sort of charms it offers it's possibly worth having around. when you something with any sort of substance going on, stay far away. i dunno, the more times i have moon man the more it fees and tastes like a fraud."
"D - Its low abv makes this a very sessionable beer. The beer is light and crisp, and on a hot summer day I could see how one could want more than one of these. A very good easy drinker."
"Overall a lighter bodied beer, really spritzy and something that would be a good acomidation for the summer months as well as now."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Color is golden amber with a tiny white head that settles quickly with no lacing and a small collar. An active carbonation in the glass. Smell is great, incredibly hoppy, this must be very fresh. Pineapple, malt, slightly floral, a bit of pine. Taste is smooth and balanced, grassy hops, slightly citrus, lots of tropical fruit and pineapple, malt follows to keep things even. Mouthfeel is light with a medium fizzy carbonation, slightly dry in the finish. Overall drinkability is great - an excellent pale ale. This would be a go to beer during the summer if it was available."
"british american perhaps? not certain. kicks ass whatever the hell it is."
"Very good pale ale maybe a little overcarbonated but still very sessionable."
"D: Very light and easy to drink, but nothing mind blowing. Good for the style, but there are others I'd drink before this."
"Outside of Wisconsin this beer is not easily available, so I hope that I got a good example of this beer to try."
"Absolutely drinkable, I could stick with this all night and be satisfied."
"Pours a clear golden with 2 fingers of white head. Smells are citrus, some pine hops, and sweet malt. Tastes are sweet malt right at the front, followed by some citrus and pine, with a nice smooth semi-bitter finish, and leaves a nice citrusy aftertaste. I say semi-bitter because it's so perfectly balanced that the bitterness fades quickly. Mouthfeel is a perfect amount of carbonation, and drinkability is really high. Very good beer, I totally understand how NG outsells Rogue even though NG is ONLY in WI. Awesome."
"Taste is nice but not as hopped or citrus as I am used to. In general, a hoppiness and citrus blend that leans a little sweet lemon and orange. Really a nice fresh beer but over all is a little middle of the road. Nice carbonation and drinkability. A rather laid back example but good."
"D-Pleasantly drinkable, with an overall easy body and a smooth feel. Sessionable, to be certain, as is indicated on the label."
"D- Great drinkability and great to grab for in the midst of all the big beers out there. I'm happy to have this one while I sit back and relax."
"This beer pours a dark golden in color with a half inch of head. The aroma is hoppy, with citrus and tall grass. The taste is massive, clean, refreshing hops, with citrus, cantaloupe, and mango. This is a delicious hoppy ale. One of the most interesting hop flavor profiles I have tried."
"Good balance with a lean toward hops. Pretty much an IPA. Good mix of citrus and malt. Extremely balanced, Man, I could drink this all day. Very impressive."
"Toasted malt up front quickly gives way to crisp hop bitterness. Orange zest-citrus hop flavors turn to grapefruit, with accents of pine. Grainy malt turns to more of a light biscuit and mildly sweet caramel notes. Drying hop bitterness takes over the finish. Mineral water and lingering citrus rind. Moderate body with a somewhat lively feel. A nice refreshing, pleasantly balanced APA. Very sessionable."
"[D] Drinkability is off the charts. It is not filling, overly alcoholic, palate-numbing, or overly complex to fatigue the senses through a 6-pack or more."
"Really well balanced pale ale, one of the best in the style."
"D: Although this is a decent beer, it doesn't really stand out or have any distinguishing characteristics. I won't go out of my way to find this beer, as it's out of my market and I can drink local beers that are comparable."
"Another entry in the pre-interview extravaganza. It pours a clear pale golden straw topped by finger of white foam. The nose comprises pine, tangerine, melon, and a light caramel. The taste runs along a similar path, with some mandarin oranges and hop spices thrown into the mix as well. The body is light (drifting toward the heavy side thereof), with a moderate carbonation and a dry, prickly finish. Overall, a solid pale, but one that threatens to verge on the overly-ordinary, thankfully without actually following through. Still highly drinkable, though."
"Lighter medium body, some sticky, dry warmth. Easy drinking but still completely amazing flavor profile. An incredibly solid beer."
"D: Overall, a nice session type beer, or a beer that would pair well with seafood and/or a salad"
"O - Glad I got a chance to try it, although it's not something I'd necessarily trade for. Very pleasant but not extraordinary."
"D - Very high in terms of flavors and the awesome session-like 5% ABV."
"Bottle. Poured into my Lakefront Brewery pint glass pours a clear golden amber color with a small bubbled white head. The aroma of hops is really apparent, not overly piney or citrus but a nice balance slightly leaning toward citrus and lemon. Medium/light mouthfeel. Nice balance between sweet my and hop bitterness. Nice lace on the glass. If I was lookin for a really hoppy apa then I would grab something different but the best thing about this beer is the drinkability. At 5% too, this is a really nice sessionable beer."
"Beer is medium in body with nice carbonation that thins the feel out slightly to a lighter body. The lead off is a mild sweetness, hop flavors and some bitterness at the back with a nice midpalate presence. Its probably one of the better beers I've had from them."
"Pours a light gold with a solid head. Smells very citrusy for just a pale ale- the hops really come through. Taste is fairly balanced, but there is a solid hop flavor that is missing in many pales. It doesn't get weighed down by the malt, either; it has just the right amount of each. Very light body with some solid carbonation. This is a very drinkable and enjoyable choice from the always excellent New Glarus."
"This is a very nice beer; I really like how drinkable and light it is, but I could wish for some more fruit-laden hop character here. I really like the aroma of this brew, if the taste had followed suit it would have been heaven."
"Drinkability: A Great beer overall. Seems to be exactly the right amount of flavors and lack of poor ones to be considered the epitome of a very drinkable beer for the style."
"D: I'm beginning to become a New Glarus fan and have yet to sample a bad beer by them."
"Don't buy the hype that this is an APA...it may have been made like an APA, but it sure did not taste like one. This beer reminded me of a weiss--very fruity with strong hints of lemon and grapefruit. I'm not in to fruity beers, but as fruity beers go, this was tolerable...that said, it was not at all what I expected and more like a wine cooler than a beer."
"Pours a pale golden with slight haze. Good head retention and some really nice lacing. Nose brings a bit of citrus hops with a light bit of grain in the background. Taste is citrus with a bit of bitterness. Some slight grain in the back, but no real malt character. Feel is a bit light and undercarbonated. Tasty, but I preferred Hop Hearty and there are certainly better APAs out there."
"An excellent Pale Ale. I can drink this in gulps, and keep coming back for more. Highly recommended."
"On the whole, I'm more of a bigger beer guy, but do enjoy the lower ABV ones when they are tasty, this one is good but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it either."
"Pale golden color with a large head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is all hops. Notes of citrus, pine, and a little bit of spice. The malt comes out a little in the flavor but not much. Plenty of hop flavor that starts off with citrus but finishes more herbal and grassy. This is a dry beer that could of used a little sweetness. Not that it is overly bitter but it is nice to have something for the hops to play off of. I expected a little bit of balance from this brewer. Lighter body with nice carbonation. Fits the flavor well. Just enough complexity to keep the drinker happy. Sessionable and a great value."
"I think the bottle's description of the hops as ""bright"" is spot on and the beer is a nice example of packing a lot of flavor into a pale ale without over-hopping and treading into the IPA category. Not my favorite APA out there, but tasty and a refreshingly unique take on the style."
"This is a very solid beer, and at 5% I would not mind having a few of these. If only they distributed to MN..."
"I had a bottle of this last night and kept thinking about it throughout the day (maybe my Freudian libido's taking a vacation). I couldn't help but take a long lunch and share my observations."
"The body is firm; slightly slick. Not filling at all. Great flavors of lemon zest, hops, crackers, and a light grassy note. This is like a hoppy lager for sure. Light, crisp, refreshing. One of the better APAs I've had in awhile. Is different enough from the standard, that I could have this most anytime. Wish I had it locally. Recommend."
"D- Very drinkable, the thin feeling adds to the refreshing aspect of this, and at 5% 3 or 4 of these would not be an issue."
"D: A very simple but pleasant little APA; I could drink a tone of these"
"Moon Man pours a light gold with a nice fluffy white head. The aroma is in your face grapefruity, citrusy hops. Sweet pale malt hovers in the background. The flavor is light and slightly malty with plenty of hops that have a lemony character. The finish is dry and a bit bitter, but the bitter doesn't linger. This is a great, hoppy session type beer, I would drink it regularly if it was local."
"Drank this one super quick....dammit."
"Pours with some sediment in the glass. The aroma packs a little bit of everything from florals to pine to fruity yeast. Juicy, citrusy hops. Very tasty and balanced on my tongue with just a touch of bitterness. I could see this being my new Sierra Pale if I lived in Wisconsin. Yummy."
"Drinkability: I was disappointed. I finished the beer, but will wait before having another."
"Had this again fresh from the tasting room. On lots of fresh onion and earthy hops explode on this. Much holier than I remembered...very light and sessionable, which is perfect for a midday beer."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for bringing this one out. Pours a golden orange with a loose, half-inch, bright white head that dissipates into a skim and a broken band around the edges. Great nose - peaches and wheat. Simple, but very satisfying. Taste follows nose, but much more muted and the peaches are expressed more as a citric juice quality behind the wheat. Mouthfeel is light in body, with a pleasant background carbonation and a fairly clean finish. A very different APA than anything I've had the opportunity to try thus far. An easy drinking brew with a very distinctive character for the style."
"overall an amazing choice that i was so happy that i made. i was just immensly impressed with this beer."
"D - So easy to get down, it's sweet, but not too sweet. Good drink this all day. A very nice APA."
"Bright feeling and refreshing, this is a VERY tasty and drinkable APA that is perfect for spring and summer. New Glarus hits another seasonal out of the park with this one!"
"D - A good beer to remind you that a beer can showcase hops without smacking you in the face. Another well done offering from New Glarus."
"Overall a good session beer that also would do well as a lawnmower. Its balanced and not overpowering. A delicious beer all around. I really wish I had bought more of this as its only sold in WI."
"D: A beer that is enjoyed best in the sun. A good session brew, but flavors are lacking in presence."
"D: As a fan of pales this beer exceeded my expectations. Very drinkable and begs for a second."
"D: This is one hell of a good pale ale. Wish it were local as it definitely would be a standard for me. Recommended"
"Flavor is strong sour citrus, a very pilsener like malt presence, then a slightly astringent bitterness -- not a really strong lasting bitterness but it has some astringency about it that I didn't find so pleasant. I like everything else about this beer except that ending flavor. It finishes very clean after the astringency fades, making it quite drinkable -- strong flavors, clean finish leaving you ready for more. Carbonation was very full upping the mouthfeel for this otherwise light beer."
"D: Fantastic. You just can't have one of these. I grabbed 2 sixers of this when I was in WI a few weeks ago and I've already blown through them. My 2nd favorite American Pale Ale, just behind Three Floyds Alpha King"
"Really nice APA from New Glarus. I really enjoy the aggressive hoppiness and the refreshing, clean flavor. Well worth seeking out a few bottles."
"Malts make their presence felt in the flavor, with an earthy, roasted barley hint to the paleness. Grainy and slightly doughy, but thankfully the hops kick in mid-swallow to secure Moon Man's footing in the style. A bit of pine to the bitterness, but the big tropical fruits from the aroma have all but disappeared. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly, with a refreshing quality to the crispness that makes this beer go down too easily. All in all, a highly serviceable Pale Ale from New Glarus, but these guys make better IMO."
"This beer pours a clear golden-orange color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into thick, sticky lacing. This is what an APA should look like. The aroma is of pine resin, grapefruit, and herbs. This is a very hoppy smelling beer with no real malt comping through. It works though in the the hop profile is quite interesting. The taste is very balanced. In fact it is slightly on the malty side with some nice hop dryness in the finish. I really like how this beer smells hoppy, but tastes mildly malty. Both play well of each other. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is one of the best American Pale Ales I have had, and at 5% it is extremely sessionable. Kudos to New Glarus."
"D-this is a very tasty pale ale, it has a good hop presence with enough malt to balance, very good feel, just lacking a little bit of carbonation. nice balance with the bitterness, light but still present. very good!"
"(D)- A great example of the style. Smoother and easier drinking than some of the over-hopped takes on the style these days. Very enjoyable and sessionable. New Glarus does not disappoint!"
"D: Very nice. A pretty damn good APA. Rivals some of my favorites."
"Drinkability is good. This is a well crafted APA and fits the style well. Goes down easy, but nothing really pulls me back to the glass. It would be nice to see something more from the aroma or flavor, but this is still a good brew. It seems like most of the standard beers from New Glarus are good, but not great. Still an enjoyable drink though."
"The mouth is slightly oily and sticky. This is an easy drinker and could work as a session beer. I would love to try this on tap or better yet, cask."
"Good solid basic drink. Nothing to shout about and nothing to complain about. I bet it would be nice on tap."
"D= I was expecting a hop bomb with this one but then I remembered this is New Glarus and they not only do everything great but they do it to style. What I got here was a wonderfully fantastic pale ale. This isn't a lower alcohol IPA. It has wonderful balance and sort of reminds me why New Glarus is so amazing."
"Not NG best effort."
"Clear golden color with no head or lacing. Nice piney hops in thenose, some citrus in there, maybe orange, not much sweetness. Taste is all piney hops, some different flavors of bitter citrus rind, particularly orange, and maybe some grapefruit. Bitterness is there, but not overpowering. Medium body, average carbonation, dry finish. A very flavorful APA that rivals many IPAs in flavor and bitterness, but with the added benefit of being lower in alcohol. Good beer!"
"Plus points on the drinkability. Very crisp and refreshing with a low abv. A great sessionable beer."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced. really liked the aroma, but then it came down a notch in the flavour."

"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Not a bad pale ale, definitely has some neat hop character, more IPAish than pale ale. Thanks Russ!"
"D - Another winner for New Glarus."
"d - A decent APA. Mostly citrus hops here, would try again."
"I could do with this in a pinch, but wouldn't seek it out."
"Can't report on the color as this was poured into a red plastic picnic cup. Piney hops dominate the smell and maybe a trace of bready malt. Taste has a very clean and refreshing quality. Hops are evident but they don't club you on the head like many of todays popular super-hoppy brews. Nicely balanced and quite drinkable."
"Picked up a single, it's a good pale ale that is flavorful enough while still being easy to drink. Another good one from New Glarus."
"Folks this is about perfect for a warm summer day. A tasty thirst quencher."
"This is a drinkable APA; quite sessionable. I think it's a great introduction to the style as it's not extreme in any way. For the more experience beer drinker, however, it may be a bit simple and even watery."
"What can I say... New Glarus has been my 'go too' brewery for the last several years. Living in Chicago, I only get out there twice a year, and seeing as they will not distribute to Chicago or anywhere besides Wisconsin, I may hype it up in y head throughout the seasons. However this particular brew has all the qualities of a Green Flash and gumballhead without being too heavv or too sweet. Another quality is that it is also similar to the Lagunitas IPA, one of the best beers ever created IMO, without the super-fruitiness that makes the LIPA tiresome after 6 months of loyal sessioning. I know '5's are extra special, but so is this brew. Jason, Todd, get on this one. This is truly one beer that belongs to no coasts yet all coasts can appreciate."
"This is a pretty well put together pale ale. And a hoppy one I might add. Smell is piney and rich with grassy and toasty malt notes to go along with the hoppiness. Taste is very hop forward and bitter with undertones of malt and fruit. Mouthfeel is substantial and full, but a little transient."
"Drink Oh yeah this is an easy drinking beer. I think I'll have another."
"I had this beer on-tap at the New Glarus Brewery. I liked this beer, although it might not be my favorite pale ale that I've had. It is a nice, slightly darker shade of gold. Nice head on this beer. Strong aroma, some of my party was turned off by the smell, but I enjoyed it. The taste is comparable to other pale ales I've had, a very slight bitterness. Moon Man seemed to get better as I kept drinking it though, so if you don't like it at first give it a chance. New Glarus is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinker. If this was regularly available, I'd definitely buy a lot of this."
"That having been said, and not to take anything away from Moon Man (an APA) , I sincerely hope that New Glarus brings a true IPA to the scene in the near future. Hop Hearty was fine, but not up to the brewery's standards."
"4/4.5/5/4/5"
"D - This is not a hop bomb by any means...and I don't believe NG intended it to be one. This is a flavorful Summer brew that you could drink all day long, on the boat, at the beach, at a barbeque. It tastes much bigger than it actually is though. A very good, and very sessionable, beer. Definitely worth a try if you haven't had it."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability -- New Glarus knows how to make a drinkable beer. This one has a bit more going on than most New Glarus brews. Yet another glorious Great Lakes APA!"
"Light bodied with a a lot of effervescent carbonation. Finishes dry, and somewhat bitter. Not a bad beer, but I am not sure I will seek it out again."
"Poured into a drinking glass. Was a very hazy straw yellow, with fairly active carbonation and a fluffy white two finger head. I was actually a bit surprised at how light was the color of the beer. The aroma was extremely floral, not piny like most pale ales....almost like a bouquet of wildflowers, many differnt light flowery aromas mixed together...nice....initial taste was corn and grain followed by grass and a light hoppiness, not bitter or resiny, but very delicate. I was very surprised by the uniqueness of this beer, but it was done exceptionally well."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a lively carbonation and slightly sticky finish."
"D-This is a really easy, drinking solid brew from New Glarus. It reminds me A LOT of Stone Levitation with the low alcohol level and the taste profile."
"Overall a terrific Pale Ale, and one that I would drink non-stop if I could get it where I live."
"M- Creamy feel and extremely easy drinking. An excellent example of an APA. This could be an everyday beer if available here. Thanks to Don H for having the willpower to get this bottle all the way from Wisconsin to Pa."
"Well made but flavor is not quite to our liking, something slightly off it seems..."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy golden color with a frothy white head, good lacing throughout. Aroma is pale malts, bread, grass, and a bunch of hops (citrus, earthy, grass). Flavor is caramel malts, lemon zest, citrus, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium, fair amount of carbonation, a little chalky, bitter at the end. Great beer, well balanced, drinkable, I want another one."
"A big step up from Spotted Cow for a Summer sipper as its complexity is beneficially broader and tastier."
"The body is a little thin and the carbonation is high, but besides that this is a really nice beer that screams summer drinker and really shows how a hop forward beer can come in at 5%"
"Pours a beautiful clear-ish golden color with a nice amount of white foamy head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is very pleasant with some mildly fruity hoppy qualities. Flavor matches in large part but there is a slight bitterness in the finish. Very tasty brew and something I could drink all day. Already looking forward to the next one..."
"D: The bottle notes this is a session beer, and that is exactly what this beer is. It's light, it's simple, it's incredibly easy to drink, and it's nothing special. If this one were to have been brewed by someone other than NG, people would be shitting all over it."
"Drinkability is likewise spectacular. Perfect summer beer for sitting on the porch and soaking in the sun. I've said it before - I would give up 3/4 of the beer available in TN to get New Glarus, because it's just that good."
"Overall, this is a nicely done American Pale Ale. About up to what I'd expect from New Glarus. Drinkable."
"Feels a bit thin, though the flavors carry it a long way. Easy to session without thinking about it much. Recommended."
"Overall, a very enjoyable brew that's worth seeking out."
"A respectable pale ale. Not my favorite, but I'd drink this again."
"Pours a nice deep blonde color with a good head and good lace. The aroma is nice sticky pine sap and some citrus, basically a bunch of fresh fruity hops. The flavor follows with that tropical fruit hoppiness featuring the mango and the citrus and the like. The bitterness is well controlled but certainly noticeable (thankfully). This is a very simple but masterfully well done APA."
"D: High. I'm not a hophead, and this is at about the extent of my comfort level. Nice..."
"Pours a deep golden not quite amber color. Nice white head and generous lacing. Smell is spicy and fruity with lots of grapefruit and pine notes. Bready toasted biscuits are in the back ground too. Great tasting beer. This is what you want from a Pale Ale. Nice substantial malty body with a fair amount of sweetness. Perfectly balanced with a huge dose of spicy herbal hop bitterness. I was pleasantly surprised with the level of hoppiness in this beer. Crisp and bitter, but still very well balanced. You don't have to be a raging hop-head to enjoy this. Insanely drinkable. This is the best product I've had from New Glarus. I will be drinking plenty of Moon Man in the future."
"This beer is great, easily one of my favorite NG's. A super tasty and easy to drink pale ale."
"Despite Organic Revolution and Hop Hearty, which didn't float my boat, it seems that NG can do hops. A unique and flavorful APA, my new fave. The six-pack just disappeared."
"Drinkability- No mistaking what this beer is - a lightly hoppy, beautifully drinkable Pale Ale. I don't like malt getting in the way of my hoppy goodness and Moon Man fits that bill perfectly. I will be grabbing a sixer of this my next trip to Wisconsin, great beer."
"Drinkability - I'm not a hop-head, so I have no problem with a pale ale that takes a moderate approach to hopping. A good tasting beer from a company with a fine track record."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some very nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, slightly malty, with some citrus and pine notes. The taste is hoppy, some malt notes, good dose of citrus and pine notes thrown it. Medium body. Very Drinkable, this would pass as an IPA for some. Love the NG brew's."
"edit: now that I have had most of the bottle, I must say that it reminds me of a lighter version of Abrasive ale."
"If you live in the midwest, you need to find some new glarus. They're not all great, but none are bad, and some are rad."
"Edit: 8/1/11 -- I still love this beer."
"D: All around good effort."
"This brew pours a nice clear dark golden/light amber color with a medium white head. The aroma is medium-high citrus hops with a bit of sweet malt in the background. The flavor is hops upfront-citrus, pine and a bit grassy followed by a hint of malt and a prickly hop bitterness lingers at the finish. The carbonation is medium-high with a medium body and a dry finish. Overall this is a well made beer and quite drinkable. I'd recommend it for drinking a 6er in a night."
"Picked up a 6 pack at Woodman's Market in Madison. Poured into a pint glass to give a nice clear golden ting witha 1/2 inch of white head thatlingered for a while but eventually dissipated to a thin film atop the beer. Very lemon smell with some grapefruit and grassy notes. Tastes fairly balanced with malts and hops for about 1/2 second and then a hop bomb is dropped on your tongue. Lots of citrus and some grassy/piney flavors and a nice bitter finish. Excellent hop profile on this APA. Mouthfeel is very smooth. With an IPA profile and an pale ale ABV, I could drink this all night long. If only I lived in Wisconsin."
"Golden yellow body with light carbonation speckled throughout the body. The wispy white head leaves sporadic patches of lace. Really nice zesty fresh citrusy aroma. Lemon and orange are big. This APA is very bright and citrusy. Unique flavor, which is hard to come by in APAs. Leather and lemon. Quite dry, but refreshing. Light-medium body. Cool apa."
"Very unusual for a pale ale. Unusually clean and very drinkable, almost lager like in some ways. Poured with a nice off white fine foamy head that settles to a light cover and good lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is fresh hop malt and beery. Flavor is like aroma plus some sweetness. Great body and carbonation. Finish is like flavor with a bit of the sweetness holding out as it all tapers off. Session beer for sure."
"Thanks Cheezdawg!"
"D: A fantastically refreshing APA. Nothing more I need to say about that!"
"D Very drinkable and may well become my session beer of choice this summer. Well balanced and hoppy without being bitter."
"Sierra Nevada Pale ale and Southern Star's Pine Belt Pale Ale were my top 2 PAs until today... Now they found a new brew to fun in their wolfpack. Moon man, welcome!"
"Poured into a glass this brew has a nice clear yellow/orange color with a thick white head that left nice lacing. The brew was nice an full of citrus and hops aroma. The taste was a little heavy on the clove and citrus and not as much hops as I expected. The mouth-feel was a little light but the carbonation was nice. This was a decent pale ale, but not the best. Worth a try for sure."
"This is a crisp, refreshing, tasty, simple summertime beer. I'm done analyzing & will continue drinking. Carry on."
"It has that taste and texture of a beer that you look for just after cutting the grass on a hot summer day... then lay in the hammock with a six pack on ice at your side!"
"Aside from some of the unplugged offerings this has to be the my favorite NG beer I've had to date. This has to be the quintessential session beer for me. The nose packed with fresh floral hop aroma with just enough citrus. This beer has the nose and hop presence of an IPA but still manages to drink like a very well balanced APA. Good carbonation with a light-medium mouthfeel. I am glad its only 5%abv cause I could drink a lot of these especially on some of those long summer days, believe I have found my new summer session beer."
"Easy drinking decently flavored beer from New Glarus, had high expectations after being greeted with a pretty good aroma, but felt the taste and body were a bit lacking..."
" ~ Overall this is a very drinkable and satisfying pale ale. Certainly a sessionable brew and another notch in the winner category for the folks at New Glarus."
"Testimonial: I'd had a 16oz. cup of gnarly gas station coffee right before this, and the taste of the beer came through true and clear after only a few sips---that's a powerful brew! Really nice all around."
"D: I wish I had access to this all the time. What a great beer."
"this one kinda goes down like ""alpha king light""...and i mean that in the best possible way. it's refreshing, it's tasty and assertive, and it just goes to show you that Dan Carrey knows what he's doing. I hope this example of quality is what we can continue to expect from New Glarus. No more Honey Bock please...!"
"A solid offering - no doubt. Always pleased with what a technically accurate brewery like NG can do."
"D - It's nice to see Dan make a beer with a variety of hops that doesn't have a ton of bitterness. This beer is easy drinking and a great replacement for Hop Hearty if you ask me. This is a great session beer that will be hard to put down once the summer hits.. Nicely brewed Dan."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's a very good tasting and lighter beer. I really enjoyed this one as I sit outside and enjoy the warm spring weather."
"Very good on drinkability, despite this one being fairly unexciting. It's definitely a good summer IPA."
"Pours a rich clear golden color, with a nice big foamy white head. Aroma is all big hops--pine, resin, citrus. On the palate, more hops. A nice malty backbone, balanced beautifully with the hops (pine, lemon, maybe pineapple). A nice crisp mouthfeel makes this one very easy to drink. Truly reminiscent of a west coast hop bomb. A great beer."
"This is an excellent pale ale and seriously drinkable. I could (and probably would if I had access) drink this all day."
"This is nearly a five in the drinkability department. This beer makes the perfect session beer. A must try beer!"
"The hop bill stands out more in this than last time. Maybe it's because I have laid of the hop bombs and my palette isn't dead from the regular consumption of west coasties. I have to elevate the scores. For the ABV this is full of flavor."
"pours a slight hazy golden yellow color with a fluffy white head that recedes to a nice fresh ring..its a little light in color.the smell was not overwhelming but i could smell hops and grapefruit/citrus malt and bready smells ..the taste was better it has a hop/citrus hit for sure then some malts in the background its nicely balanced and flavorful..its a straight APA for sure and at 5% it packs a lot of flavor the moth feel is medium not overwhelming but you know you are drinking a crafted brew..i really liked this one and picture drinking this on a regular basis for spring/summer...reccomended"
"EDIT: Had this one on tap and enjoyed it much more than I had originally remembered. Nice hop flavor and balance. So I am boosting my original score."
"But, hell, this ain't an IPA. It's an APA. And that fact is all the more remarkable in its flavor, which goes above and beyond what you should get out of a 5% ABV."
"D: This is a perfect session beer for someone who drinks full flavored beer and a great beer to introduce Bud/Miller/Coors drinkers to beers with a little more flavor. It goes great with pizza, steak, cheese, whatever. (5/5)"
"D: this beer is incredibly drinkable, it has a perfect balance and a nice bright hop profile that doesn't come close to being bitter. All around very nice, I could drink a lot of this!"
"drinkability: the pinnacle of drinkability"
"Drinkability: This is going to be a good Summer."
"If you like spotted cow on hops, this is your beer."
"D. Off the chart drinkability. I pounded a 6-pack of this stuff two nights ago and never tired of it. It's a good thing I ran out - I would have probably drank another 6-er before passing out. This is going to be a great addition to NG's summer beer line-up - a killer warm weather session beer for sure. Nicely done and highly recommended."
"Overall it is a bit of an oddity but for the most part it is typical low-flavor APA."
"It's one of the best pure sessioners I've had in a bit."
"D - This is going to make for a great summer beer and maybe forget how much I am missing Cracked Wheat. The lemon type hop flavor really fits in nice."
"D/O- My claim to fame is to be the man to carry the second 6 pack out of the brewery. Doesn't that win me something like another 6 pack? This is a great session brew and may need to buy in bulk to make my 2010 summer session staple beer."
"D- A great hop nose and good flavor make for a good session beer and Dan hit it on the head with this one. No palate fatigue to speak of after a few of these and light enough in the body as to not fill you up. I cannot wait to crack a few of these open on a hot summer day."
"A very nice pale ale that nails the style and proves that New Glarus can do hops"
"Overall if I was to think of a session ale this will be my new definition. NG nailed this one for sure. I will have no problem putting back a handful of these anytime."
"I gotta say, I'm pretty happy with Moon Man. I had pretty low expectations, so it certainly surpassed those. That said, the aroma is knockout delicious, the flavor is a clean and hoppy backed up admirably by a sweet honey-like character of the pale malts, with a somewhat underwhelming finish, but a pale ale this is and for what it is, I think NG did a fantastic job."
"I'm decently impressed. Not by any means a beer to be blown away by, but absolutely true to the style and solid beer at that. Just as they suggest, this is one to be consumed at its absolute freshest, and I'd say I've had the privilege of doing just that."
