"Really good beer.  Little lighter Han an IPA but one of tropical flavor. Good warm weather beer for sure."
""

"Pours a hazy deep yellow color with a finger and a half of rocky foam. Smell is of hops, buscuits, and pine. Maybe some hints of lemon and grapefruit. Taste is very hoppy, closer to a IPA style. Not bad, just not what I was expecting. Pronounced pine and hop notes at the beginning, fading to a very watery lemon taste. Mouth feel is very little carbonation with a very oily feeling. Not very good. Overall, a little disappointed based on the BA Score."

"There a lot better pale ales out there"
"Final Thoughts: This is a hopped up IPA that's pretending it is a regular pale ale. It's like Hopitcal Illusion gone horribly wrong. I probably would have been a bit more charitable to this one if it was labelled an IPA, but not largely so. It is a beer that hits the wrong buttons for me."

"Poor's out hazy golden orange with a white rocky head. The aroma is strong pine, some orange, a little sweet caramel malt, slight grass, a little dankness and orange pungent in the end.  Taste is strong orange, then pine, sweet caramel, little spicy, medium bitterness, dry almost watery finish, and a lemon pith finished flavor. Real easy drinker and highly recommended for a pale ale with a slightly different taste then others I have had.  For some reason it is a hard beer to put down and it goes down really easy."
"This doesn’t rival isn’t quite People are People or Hungry Like the Wolf, but what invasion ever reaches that level? This is more like Save a Prayer, and hey, who wouldn’t want that? A very nice pale ale."
""
""
"Cloudy orange body with some hints of amber. Huge, fluffy off-white head sits on top. Really abnormally large head on a normal pour. Aroma is very tropical, lots of pineapple, mango and some toasted malt aromas. Flavor is much of the same, tropical fruity hop flavors with a solid toasty malt backbone. Carbonation is a bit off, as noticed by the huge head. Somewhat fizzy and just slightly off. Doesn't take much away from the overall impression, but is a little strange."

"Can poured into shaker pint at the condo in Cocoa Beach. Cloudy orange body with off white head that leaves modest lacing. Caramel and bread malt aromas with tropical fruit hop notes. Mild tropical fruit sweetness up front, citrus bitterness and earthy overtones later. Medium body, barely resiny, lively carbonation, bitter dry finish."
"Overall- A strong IPA, it is enjoyable and I will drink this again.."
"Found this in a cruise and thought it was the best beer on the boat.  Great for warm weather and very citrus and smooth."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from can into tapered pint glass.  Cloudy yellow color with 3in of head slowly dissipating to 1 in.  Malty smooth at the beginning with a nice crisp orange aftertaste.  It's incredibly smooth, with a perfect mouthfeel of light carbonation to give the tongue a tingle."
""
""
""
"Spicy, resinous hop nose with citrus and some other fruit. Pours copper amber with a slight chill haze under a 2” off-white foam cap that descends to about a quarter its original size. It’s very lacy. It enters with big fruit sweetened with light caramel over graham cracker leading to a very pleasant hop bitter accent on the finish. Medium body and carbonation - very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer with one of the biggest orange twangs of any beer I've had."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is smooth with very mild carbonation, a slick almost watery feel across the tongue, a medium body and a slightly bitter sweet malty aftertaste that is similar to the finish of orange juice but with some toasted wheat bread in it. Overall a good, slightly above average pale ale that I’d like to try fresher since this one was 3 months old. I was hoping for more hops from Cigar City, but this was a good beer and in line with the style."
""
""
"Pours a nice golden amber with nice lasting head lacing. Nose is light citrus with mild hops.  Taste is very clean, citrusy, with hints of honey biscuit. Has a very pleasant, sweet, after taste that lingers throughout. A very drinkable, straight forward pale ale. A solid offering by Cigar City"
""
"Gold pour into pint glass with tight white head; good lacing; strong grapefruit notes up front; lite mouthfeel and  good carbonation;grapefruit and grass hop favors; citrus and pine finish; flavorful pale ale and at 5% one of my favorite ""session"" beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Plenty-o-nice tropical and outdoorsy woodsy hops, good malt presence, great flavors for a 5% pale and super drinkable. I feel some are underwhelmed by this one simply because pale ales of this par are standard now, all I can say is keep em comin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yet another APA that comes across as an IPA, but retaining enough body to set it apart (think Dale's, vice SNPA). Definitely not a ""session"" IPA, but definitely a beer that knows that hops are the strong point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"one of my favorite pale ales ever.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I wasn't really impressed with this apa, especially coming from cigar city  (which BTW is my first beer from cigar city.) I think some of it was that it was canned in 0ctober and I am drinking it in January but I didn't realize the canned on date until I was back to Texas. Maybe I'll be able to try this fresh at a later date and write a new review."
""
""
""
""
"To sum up, it's a basic, well-made American pale ale with a heftier malt side than you might normally find (think Sierra Nevada)."
""
""
""
""
"My rating: 4.25"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really good pale ale.  The piney hops were right on target for my taste.  I could use a little more malty balance but none the less a good beer."
"T: Light caramel and sweet bread. Lime peel, papaya, cling peaches; roselle and persimmon."
"O. Very nice beer.  Definitely 1 dimensional but what it does it does very well."

"12 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 10/9/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright golden color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some light steaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon/orange zest, light pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is an excellent pale ale. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

""
""
""

"Excellent Pale Ale!"
"Crisp and refreshingly hoppy with a tropical citrusy going on. That is the type of APA I usually fall in love. I could session this the whole day. It does remind of Jai Alai, but easier."
""
""
"O - A great session beer. Different from many pale ales out there due to the vivaciousness of the hops and dryness of the malt. Worth checking out!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This will have a regular rotation in my fridge."
""
""
""

""

"Rock solid pale ale.  Low bitterness, very fruity hop character, like lots of Centennial or NZ hops without the funkiness, pretty bready finish.  Wish it were drier, but all told really great ""throw it back"" pale ale.  Can't imagine this beer selling badly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pleasing hopped up pale. Resins and pine early then some soft tropical fruit in the finish.  Nice."
""
""
""
""
"O – A very good session beer.  I’d lean it more towards an IPA considering the high hop bitterness, but the moderate alcohol level helps it fit in the pale ale category."

"Reminiscent of my favorite year round Cigar City brew Jai Alai, the citrus especially grapefruit notes in the hops for notable for both the nose and taste.  Very fresh flavor, and a beer for that would be well suited for those who are not hopheads.  Certainly a good option for a session beer for those interested in that sort of thing."
"This is a very good APA.  Ranks right up there with the best.  At 5% this is a good day drinking beer.  Good job.  4"

"This smells great, but it doesn't taste as good as it smells, which is disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great ""every day"" kind of beer.  It's been my go-to beer if I'm at the BBQ or out of a boat.  It's almost like a ""Jai Alai Lite", if there was such a thing.  Very refreshing during the summer heat."

"Saw a lineup of Cigar City cans in the cooler at TW a guy grabbed a sixes of Invasion and a light bulb went of, I haven't even tried this one yet! As CC never disappoints I secured a sixer myself and headed towards the door. Now back at the ranch, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top on the can I get a nice piney-citrus hop waft. Pouring into a chalice I get a translucent orange with a multi-sized bubble off-white head that stands well. On the taste this brew is a well balanced PA that hits up front with some bitterness, fades to sweet maltiness then finishes with a dry and bitter aftertaste. Very refreshing and a wide range of flavors for a PA, complex if I may say so. This is yet another keeper from CC"
"Overall, this is a very good pale ale from Cigar City using a fair amount of malt to back the hops. A well balanced offering."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very light copper color with almost two fingers of head that lingers nicely and leaves some decent lacing behind. The nose is hoppy. The body is very light for the style. The flavor profile is also quite light – perhaps a bit too light. The finish is mildly but pleasantly bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"OVERALL: Another wonderful beer from a wonderful Micro Brewery. Invasion has quickly become one of my favorite Pale Ale's."

"Invasion is a really nice, smooth and drinkable beer.   It is very hop forward, and finishes clean with a touch of malt.  A very good beer to give to your friends who aren't big into craft beer, as the taste is just familiar enough to them that they won't be scared away."
""
""
""
""
"O: Everything I've found online points to the date being a canned on date and not a best before date. Howevr, this beer tastes like it's after a best before date. Thanks for sending the tick, Paul, but I think I got a bad can. There's no way drinking a beer that was canned just over a month ago should taste this bad."
"Mellow and easy drinking. Flavorful and satisfying."

"Pour is golden orange with a bubbly white head and a good bit of lacing. Nose is overly sweet, heavy caramel malt, sweet hop and resin. Taste has a bit more depth. Grains are present but a bit stale and overly green. Malt isn't as sweet as the nose, hops also add some orange citrus with notes of grassy hops. Strong carbonation and lighter body with a sweet finish."

"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a generous amount white head which retains nicely and leaves heavy lacing. The nose has some odd aromas going on. The hops are piney and give off a hint of burnt plastic aroma. Light malt backbone is present. The taste is a bit sweet with some caramel and lemon with a ton of bitterness to follow. The finish is neutral with no real bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy for style with high carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, not real impressed with this one."

""

""
""
"O: nice pale ale, good citrus fruit flavors"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, earth, citrus zest, and slight tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, earth, and slight tropical fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I am getting more earthy aspects than tropical ones like the label describes."
"Poured into a cheap hotel-room glass. Still has a nice thick head though. Pale yellow in color, transparent. Smells of grass, lemon zest, and grain. The taste is light and crisp. A good amount of hop bitterness for a pale ale. The hop flavor is earthy with a slight citrus aftertaste. Grassy finish. Light-bodied and refreshing and but not too thin; good consistency. I tried hard not to compare this to Jai Alai. It's definitely not Jai Alai light. It stands on its own as a solid, drinkable pale ale."

"O - A pretty good, sessionable beer that I could see drinking outside in the warmer months. Not great enough to spend a lot of effort seeking out, but decent nonetheless."

"O: This is a good beer. Will buy again."
""

"o - Overall a nice beer. Not a hop bomb by any means, but very easy to drink and light fruits and hops to it. Worth the price and checking out, though I'd most likely get a Jai Alai 6er again before this."

"O) Good drinkability.... At 5% ABV you could pound down a few of these easily. Glad to try it, but wouldn't really go out of my way to acquire more."
""
""
""
""
""
"a really tasty pale ale, exactly what i expect a florida pale to taste like, with all kinds of tropical fruit aromas and flavors wafting through a lighter bodied and well carbonated can of beach beer for the craft drinker. it takes me on vacation, and includes aromas of pineapple and guava in its fruit punch profile. the hops have such little bitterness, a nice welcome summery thing here in colorado, where winter keeps hanging on. hazy light orange beer, heady and fizzy, looks nice in a globe glass. lighter pale malt base stays out of the way, while keeping an otherwise very light beer from coming across watery or too fine. great carbonation fills my mouth with all this tropical hop goodness, yet the finish is extremely clean, almost like a lager, an impressive feat in this style. nothing earth shattering here, but a nice summery breeze blowing through your typical pale ale. im always up for that."
""
""
""
"o: A very tasty and beautifully balanced pale ale, one of the best I have had, and one I would definitely enjoy in warm weather or anytime if only it were available near me. This has definitely invaded my list of top pale ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz can ~$1.49. Yellow-orange color, slightly hazed, good head. Aroma is like mild citrus and grains, not great. Flavor is sort of grainy too, not much hoppiness, not a good pale ale. The label is also offensively tacky, spend some money on designers because all their cans look like shit. Then again they have a pretty shitty logo too."
""
"Overall - Good, but nothing I'd go out of my way to get again. If the taste matched the smell, it'd be pretty remarkable. Unfortunately, it doesn't."
"Can: Poured alight golden color ale with a super large white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus and grapefruit hops with some tropical fruit is quiet enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by huge citrus, grapefruit and tropical fruit notes. Body is light with great carbonation. Very refreshing pale ale with great balance and avoids too much bitterness."
""
"O: A very respectable beer. Drinkable and approachable, but still flavorful."
"Solid pale session ale. Beautiful gold pour from can into snifter. Lightly hazy with a thick white head. Smells of pineapple, lemon and mown grass. Crisp hop flavor and light malt. Dry, refreshing. No off flavors. Great example of style. High recommendation. Thanks to miamichael2 for the trade."
""
"Great solid hop forward pale ale from these guys."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Excellent Pale Ale that is very hoppy and flavorful. I may even like this better than Jai Alai. Very impressed."
"Invasion proves APA's can still be flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0): Invasion is, in the end, a really nice, approachable, but still rich in character American Pale. Considering it comes around at about $9/sixer and is relatively easy to find (in Florida), this is a very solid buy if you can find it fresh. Definitely worth seeking out, especially if you want a legit session brew with a good hop character and an actual malt base that still doesn’t distract from the big picture. Excellent stuff."
""
""
""
""
"High B"
""
""
"Overall a nice pale ale. I feel I don't like it as much as others. But this is a nice hop bomb with a bit less alcohol than an IPA."
"This is a really solid pale ale. It is not overly aromatic, but does have a subtle hop aroma. The beer has a great flavor with a mild to moderate level of bitterness, and a balance level of malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is pleasant, with a good level of carbonation. The beer also has a nice appearance that is slightly cloudy with good color and head level."

"The invasion ipa is a good beer.  It poured a slightly hazy orangish with white head that is leaving a spotty lace.  The scent carries pine with citrus notes.  The taste is balanced quite nice....just enough bitterness to let you know that you're drinking a pale ale.  The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer."

"The feel ultimately ends up being on the dryer side almost all the way through. The body sits at about medium, though the brightness and crispness makes it seem a little lighter. It's pretty smooth, but the slightest hint of astringency pulls through at the back of the throat just toward the end."

"O- My second favorite APA behind ZD. Cigar City crushes everything. Well done"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, pale, golden coloring with some suspended proteins and a frothy, chunky, fluffy, off-white head that slowly settles out into a sparse surface coating. Aromas of citrus and melon hops forward, with a pungent bitterness and some subtle spicing. Smells big. Flavors are spice forward, with pepper and pine tassel blending well with the quickly following citrus and tropical fruit notes. Remains light throughout, despite the heavier characteristics, and you start to get a heavier roast quality towards the end of the palate, which highlights the tropical notes. Light, effervesced body keeps the beer moving all over your taste buds. A sweet and spiced blend of pineapple and melon in the aftertaste, with a quick, roasted lingering finish. Easy drinker, and this would be a great hot summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Very good beer. Smells much stronger then you would think but the flavors really come through. Not your typical session beer but it would do you for a good night putting these away. I can see fishing in the Keys with a 6 pack of these bad boys."
""
"Just an easy drinking IPA from Cigar City. It does not try to blow your socks off, but it is a good beer I would have again if I was looking to take it easy. Plus, have to love the buccaneer on the can, yar!"
""
""
"O/D - Not a bad pale ale. The weed/hop pellet element isn't the best, but it's light and easy drinking with a good enough hop flavour. Went down easy."
""
""
"Another exceptional cigar city beer! I want more. Please continue to ship to florida's east coast!"
""
""
"12 oz can. Pours hazy golden with a long lasting, foamy, white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops, orange marmalade and caramel malt. Body is full and tangy. Taste is of citrusy hops, pumpkin seeds, caramel and bready malt, ripe fruit. Finish is long, grapefruity. I expected more of this brew."
""
""
"Like with all sessionable hoppy brews, you sacrifice the full flavor of the hops for lower alcohol."

"Overall: this is similar to Moon Man Pale ale made by New Glarus. Both Invasion and Moon Man are outstanding pale ales. Received this as an extra and very happy to have another. In fact, just opened the second can. Very sessionable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Loads of tropical fruit hints lead the way from the hops here but without the huge bitterness of IPAs. A super hoppy flavored pale ale but one I would gladly buy a six pack of cans from time to time."

"My favorite pale ale that I have had. Cannot wait until this one is canned. Hops come through great but don't kill it, and malt is nicely balanced. Sometimes prefer drinking this over Jai Alai if I don't want the hop bomb. Don't short yourself and make sure to give this a try if you make it to the brewery."

"Poured into a snifter from growler. Clear body, golden in color, thin head, low retention, I'm sure because of the growler. Clear, sticky lacing. Aroma includes citrusy, piney, grapefruity hop punch. Taste follows suit with crisp hops, mild sweetness in the background, very light in body. More like a light, more approachable IPA, but packed with flavor."

"Pours a clear light amber, two fingers thick soapy white head, settles to a thin but dense cap, a few rings of lace down the glass. Smell: mango, rindy, passion fruit note, honey-ish. Taste: mango, soft fruit... more papaya than melon, citrus rind. Light-medium body, dries out a bit at the end of the sip, finishing a bit sticky. Extremely sessionable tropical fruit bomb, excellent! Canned 12/23/13."

"Poured out as a clear golden color with a white head on top. The lacing is pretty good, the retention is thin. The smell of the beer is malty and hoppy, decent balance. The taste is ok, nothing really jumps out at me on this one. The mouthfeel is smooth, nice drinkability. Overall it's a decent pale ale. Nothing too special."

"Single finger head with minimal retention and nice lacing on a clear deep golden with burnt orange hue body. Aroma has a lot of citrus, mostly orange peel and tangerine, very nice degree of sweetness. Flavor has more of a sour citrus flavor, is very bready with the finish very earthy with hint if pine resin. Medium body and moderate carbonation. A nice beer. It's a little dry and the degree of sourness hurts drinkability. A little unidimensional but still good to try."

"Draft at Gainesville Brass Tap. Waitress pouring all beers in a pint glass when I asked for something else. Pours very light golden with almost no head. Floral grassy hops in the aroma, nice and vegetal in a good way, some floral citrus . Flavor is floral, very strong citrus, finishes with some grass and incredibly crisp and clean. Light and really drinkable. Definite summer Florida beer and one of my favorite APA's."

"Overall - My favorite overall beer of the night. I could drink a lot of this."
"Overall – Strikes me as more of a IPA taste wise. This is a really good beer that I would gladly revisit. It was quite hoppy and very drinkable."
""
"On tap at the CC Tasting Room. Very conventional spot on IPA. Light orange coloured, lace dots. Watered down mouthfeel. More or less conventional American IPA, at sessionable ABV level. More hops and bodyfeel would make it more memorable as a CC beer."

"A bit thin, coming up to almost medium bodied, lighter effervescence. Decently smooth for the style but leaves a solid film to coat the palate and tongue. Pretty sticky. Somewhat drying in the middle. A good beer that needs some body to it."
""
"O: Not bad, but nothing outstanding in a crowded class. The grainy aspect to the flavor was my biggest complaint here. That said, if they canned this, it would be perfect for the golf course."
""
"O- Very good stuff. Easy to drink, very hoppy without being obnoxiously so, and a cheap shelf beer that can be found in cans nowadays. Can't go wrong with a sixer of this for a weekend."
""
"O: Great job again by CCB and I really hope this becomes one of their staple beers it's that good. I have never been a big APA guy, but I will drink this one whenever I get a chance."
"O: The freshness of this APA was remarkable. I downed two glasses of this with such ease and was really itching for more. I'll be going back for this one."
"Golden-orange pour, hazy, with a solid white head that receded to a thin layer, and left a bit of lacing on the glass. Nice hoppy aroma, almost more indicative of an IPA than an APA, citrusy and floral. Taste was very fruity and woody, orange peel and orange blossom, grapefruit pith, wildflowers, crackery pale malts, dry woody finish. Body was about medium, quite appropriate for the style, carbonation moderate, drinkability high. Overall a very tasty brew from Cigar City."
