"Looking forward to any Great Lakes beer as I am a huge Edmund Fitzgerald fan. But this one left me a little disappointed. Decent flavor, easy drinking but just not the pop I was expecting.  Too average for what I was hoping for, just wanted more flavor and bite."

"Fantastic brew.. Faint fruit flavor but not overwhelming still keeping the hops"
"Excellent Pale ale. My always on hand."
"The best beer I've ever had!"

"One of my favorite ""everyday"" beers. Can drink this all year round."

"Overall: Excellent brew! Great flavors and very enjoyable."

"Average at best in comparison to similar ales"
""
""
"Overall- A simple and right to the point PA that demonstrates what a pale ale should be quality-wise. Well done. Good blend of malt and hops. Awesome."

"Overly bitter for an APA no real malt presence overrated pale ale"

"Its was okay for me."
"Little overrated imo. Good, but finishes kind of malty. Not my favorite apa"

"Not impressed, rough feel with a bitter aftertaste"
"Not a big pale ale fan, but this one was definitely a little too sweet for my taste."
"I'm not overly fond of pale ales and this beer was ok, but not great."
""
"O: [3.00] I love Great Lakes - but not enough for me to recommend this beer.  It is just lacking any character or flavor.  I will definitely leave this out of the lineup."
"I just didn't care for this beer."

"O: Would have it again, wouldn't mind for a session beer. But wouldn't be my first choice."

"Deep gold with fine persistent lacing. Not much aroma, mild floral. Taste of citrus and floral mild malt backbone. Medium mouthfeel Sessionable."
""
""
""
""
"Medium amber, little bit of white head, good carbonation in pint glass (12oz bottle). Mild nose, hint of pine and light floral notes. Slight taste of piney hops, bit muddled tasting overall, light on hops (enjoy by still has 5-6 weeks...), not too wild about the flavors (even a bit of wet cardboard in there). Maybe fresher, or on a summer day? Clean mouthfeel in general, gently lingering flavors (unfortunately some bit off), easy drinking. Overall ok, but FL can do a lot better! I'll have to try a fresher one sometime, maybe in a mixed 12 pack..."

"Holy Cascade! This beer is great for hopheads. It looks fine, smells better than it tastes for a small time hop guy like me. This beer is pallet scorching, so be careful if you're not used to powerful alphas. Overall is is decent for Great Lakes."

"The beer pours a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly but leaves quite a bit of lacing on the sides of the glass. The beer itself is a dark copper color that borders on dark orange. The beer smell has floral hop notes, malt sweetness, and a little bit of earthy notes as well. The malt sweetness and the floral notes mix very well together and very difficult to separate but compliment each other such as that it gives off  a nice sweet floral smell. The smell also has a slight yeasty note that comes off as a sweet and bready note. The taste is a bit different from the smell. The taste has a much stronger hop flavor which is earthy and herbal instead of floral and the malt is barely noticeable while the yeast note is stronger. The mouthfeel is fairly medium bodied but on the heavier side. The beer finishes fairly smooth with a bit of carbonation. Overall, a pretty good pale ale worth getting."

"Poured on tap into a plastic pint glass at a Williamsport Crosscutters game. Pours orange red with a small white head. Smells of citrus. Tastes of citrus and earthy hops, light malt, good bite. Beer is light bodied good carbonation, smooth finish with bite. Overall a very good beer."

"Overall: A very serviceable APA that should be admired by most beer drinkers, craft lovers and those new to craft alike. The hopping levels are perfect for an APA, leaving a nice lighter beer with considerable flavor and body without being cumbersome or abrasive. Would recommend, especially as a cookout beer."

"I absolutely love this beer. If you are ever in Cleveland stop in at the Brewery. Food is great and so is the beer. This beer is naturally carbonated. Makes all the difference. Everything is brewery does, is great to perfect. I think Im in love... lol"

"Somewhat balanced in extremes, with good hop flavoring character, albeit perhaps a bit one-note. Great malt presence, which was somewhat unexpected. Fairly rich. Not as bitter as some, but just a little more bitterness than I prefer. The balance is tipped slightly to the hoppy side."

"Overall: For me, this is one of those beers that I enjoyed more when I was first getting into crafts. Now it's too malty and not enough hops for my liking. More like an EPA. However, it's still tasty and easy to go down. If there were to be a pale ale version of Victory's Hop Devil, this would be it. Great Lakes is very reasonably priced in my area so that's what keeps me coming back to this beer."

"This was the first beer I had at my first beerfest and it scared me – all that hop flavor! Now, in the age of IPAs, DIPAs, triple IPAs, etc. it seems kind of weak. But it’s still a good pale ale that I pick up occasionally."
""
""
""
"This ale is a beautiful light amber color with a puffy, but solid, white head. Nice lace. The smell is spicy with hops, but has a soft undercurrent of pale malt. Nice. The taste is clean and slightly sweet from malt. A little biscuit and a little fruit.... then the hops kick in, flavorful, juicy, bitter hops. They give a nice backbone to the beer. Full in body, with medium carbonation. This one is a treat...a solid, clean, and very drinkable east coast pale ale."
"Taste: Not cloying, but a lot of malt, which I don't care for. I want hops and this one is weak on that. Its just worthy of the high praise, but this is my opinion. And once again, I may have gotten a bad batch. But after drinking a lot of APA's and IPA's this one is just okay."
""
""
""
""
"A deep orange pour with a long lasting two finger head. The noise is mostly citrus with subtle grass and malt characters. Taste is well mixed with tropical, citrus and malt notes. It near a medium body with a crisp bitter finish. An overall solid pale ale that is always a good choice."

"First this review is caviated with the fact that the best by date (that I noticed after I began to drink it), was 6 months old. With that said the beer had a stale hop profile. Really can't say too much more except I hope to grab a fresh bottle sometime while in VA or PA, and re-review as other Great Lakes beers I've sampled have been outstanding so far. Not the brewers fault I'm guessing."

"overall i love this beer. i have had this brew probably more than any other craft brew. it was the 2nd craft brew i ever drank. gold medal winner for a reason. great american pale ale that leans more towards the english side in my opinion. add some more hops and abv and you got an IPA. solid brew."

"O- I had high expectations going in. Also, it seems to be a really beloved beer, and I seriously doubt that this many people are wrong. I just chalk it up to a difference in opinion. Personally, just not my thing. I recommend this based solely on how much love it gets from most people. However, I probably won't be picking this up again."

"O: Like I previously stated, not a hop-bomb, to my preference. Flavorful, enjoyable, but I'm still looking for a pale ale that will knock my socks off."
""
""
""
"OTOH, this beer takes me back in time to those first days of micro-brewing when no one was trying to out-do each other for palate-burning hop craziness. However, a couple in a row builds up the resin-burn a little more than I like and becomes palate-fatiguing. This beer hides its ABV and quenches a hop-craving quite well."
""
""
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is an ok offering but I really dont think I would revisit this."

"Pours out a nice amber in color with a half finger white head with retention of about 15 seconds. Smell is quite malt forward with caramel and a slight bit of hops in the nose but it is very slight. Taste is also pretty malt forward with not much hops at first but they come through as it goes down the throat. This as actually a pretty well balanced APA as far as taste. Mouthfeel is thicker than I would have expected with nice carbonation. Overall I'm pretty surprised that I liked this beer so much. It really is very balanced."
""
"Overall: This is an interesting and complex Pale Ale."
""
""

"I'd put this one right next to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale as the two classic APAs that still shine but that unfortunately seem to be forgotten more and more."

"Burning River is a pale ale that has a one finger head with average carbonation following the pour. It has a bronze color, slightly deeper than the Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold. This beer has a strong citrus and hoppy smell that is consistent with the taste. As you taste, the crisp bitterness of the hops will stick around. Recommended to anyone who enjoys pale ales."

" The flavor is a very good mix of malts with more of a German toasted perhaps vienna flavor with mild herbal and pine hop flavors following with some mild orange rind accents. The flavor of malt is pretty well balanced with the hops with a generally clean yeast taste very nice dry finish with no alcohol in the taste to speak of. Overall this is a different take on the pale style, with more german type munich toastiness and more herbal/noble type flavor than straight citrus, but it is very drinkable and well worth repeat tastes"

"Overall, what we found to be most enjoyable about this brew was its simplicity through the taste and aroma, and its ease of drinkability. While we’ve had this beer many times in the past, and enjoyed it, today it seems to be striking our palates at a funny angle. The aroma and taste both seem to be wrought with a curious plastic component. This actually faded quite a bit with warmth, but it did simultaneously reveal a heavy malt base, which tended to overwhelm the hop components. These were also a bit more bittering and puckering than we remember, as well, but in the end it didn’t stop of from enjoying this drink and leaving it with fond thoughts yet again."

"My wife asked me to buy some of this Great Lakes beer. I did not realize it won some medals and now I see why. A great lower alcohol beer; very smooth and everything a pale ale should be. I usually like heavier beers, but this one is very good for summer drinking and lower percentage."

"Pours a deep gold with an orange hue. Mostly clear and effervescing. Good retention and sticky white lace. Nose is not what I expected. Weed like with lots of bread and nutty malt character. Caramel. Citrus is there but faint, a little floral and herbal, a hint of tropical fruit but doesn’t quite stretch out. Taste is grassy, very nutty , herbal, with lots of malt rolling sweetly over the hay like palate. Cracker, biscuit, and a little bit of sweet orange. Finishes crisp and dry with just enough bitter hop oil and sweet honey on a cracker. This is a very big malt Pale Ale that drinks lovely and smooth."

"Overall - Meh, this one didn't thrill me, there are far better. That is not to say that it was bad, because it wasn't at all, it just wasn't amazing."

"I really like this Pale Ale. It's such a good balance of sweetness and hops. The smell is very distinctly flowery and biscuity with a touch of honey. The taste reflects this but adds that excellent bitterness. This is what I want out of an APA. I would definitely get this again."
""
""
"Poured into becker pint glass. Golden orange, the color of honey, crystal clear with a medium-thick white head that dissipates pretty quickly leaving some delicate lacing. Smells of clean malts with slight bitter hops in the background. Taste follows nose; clean and smooth malts with a crisp bitter hop finish that rounds off a great-tasting beer. A great drinkable beer, I could easily put away a 6-pack of these."

""
""

"Overall: This is probably my favorite pale ale not to use rye or toasted malts. the fruitiness from the yeast reminds me of english style yeasts, and it works out nicely here. definitely worth a try if you can spot some fresh stuff on the shelves."
""
""
"Middle of the road pale ale. Maybe the hops have faded with time."
" Smooth mouth feel. moderate carbonation Floral taste and mild hop finish"
"Super orange hop flavor up front with underlying grapefruit notes. Hop flavor rolls over the tongue and stays consistent through out the sip. Medium bodied with a touch of malt sweetness. Sweetness lingers but bitterness builds with each sip make for quite a balanced beer. Goes down almost too easy."
""
""
"A solid pale ale, but there are better ones around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is an exceptional pale ale with a pleasant tantalizing fruitiness that doesn't overwhelm. The fruitiness complements the bready and malty flavors very well. Drink this one as fresh as possible to experience all the fruity goodness it has to offer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured hard with only about a finger of head. Pours rich amber with. Standard. I'm not really impressed with the smell. The beer's nose is a little stale. I almost get some lagered notes. There are additionally some bready qualities in the scent, followed by a mellow earthy (and somewhat mossy) background. The flavor was not at all what I was expecting. The lagered scent follows through in the taste, but is followed by very rich (medium darkness) malt flavor. There is medium sweetness and a crisp dry finish. The hops are interesting in this beer. Not a large profile, but most present in flavor (as opposed to bitterness or smell). I mostly taste earthiness (fresh cut grass and moss). There is a bit of fruit here too, but not a typical citrus hop bomb. The fruity qualities are subtle, smooth, and complex. The mouth feel is typical and well-executed for an APA: a smooth texture, medium carbonation, and medium body. Overall this is a fine brew. It's not my favorite APA, but it turned out being quite drinkable and interesting."
"O - Easy drinking pale ale, well balanced. Crisp, clean flavors. The touch of diacetyl doesn't really take anything away from the drink."
""
""
""
""
"O- An excellent APA. Good aroma, taste and mouthfeel. I will have to grab this one again."
""
""
""

""
"12oz bottle, pours deep golden with a frothy, white head that fades into a foam leaving some sticky lacing. Citric aroma with biscuity malt & a touch of caramel and yeast. Tastes are a nice meld of toasted grain, caramel, grassy herbal hops, grapefruit pith, a bit fruity, and some hoppy spiciness on the finish. Medium mouth-feel with ample carbonation. Overall, a very solid go-to APA that fits the style perfectly."

"O: This is an easy drinking beer that pairs up well with the food served in the brewpub at Great Lakes - I think this beer would go with just about anything. Easy to drink and refreshing, enough hops to be interesting but still enjoyable and not overly bitter. This is just about sessionable (just a touch high on the ABV to really be a session beer)."

"Big malt start, then funk, followed by a hint of pineapple and grapefruit, then floral, with a wet-biscuit finish. A little malty for me, but is balanced very nicely. Medium body for a Pale Ale with medium-high carbonation. Not my favorite, but a solid beer."

"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium intensity. The result is never fizzy, just managing to effervesce slightly and gently foam the beer upon the palate. The mouthfeel is therefore somewhat foamy, slightly creamy, and generally smooth. Closes out dry, bitter, and slightly sticky."

"Overall: Even though this pale is malt dominated, the hops still make a nice present. There is actually a nice balance between the two. This is a good malt forward pale ale."
""
"This is a nice little APA. A tad too sweet, but contrasted well with some building bitterness."

"Given the ABV and how easy this drinks I feel like I could session this though, so that's kind of cool. That figures into the higher overall."

"Pours a dark copper brown, with white, moderate head and moderate lacing. Light and muted floral hop notes, not much malt, and breadiness (stuffy nose partly, so not sure). Taste nice, semi-dry, with nice carbonation and flavor. A nicely balanced Ale. Not too hoppy, but still there too! I'd buy a six too."

"12oz bottle courtesy of Mike67. A crystal clear orange amber with a medium beige lasting head on the pour. Aroma of caramel malt, yeast, bready with some mild citrus fruity notes. Taste same as aroma with good citrus floral hops bitter notes. Palate is a good medium body, crisp mouth feel and good carbonation. Finish is a combination of caramel malt citrus fruity notes, yeast with some good citrus floral hops for balance. Overall a very good, crisp refreshing and all-round solid brew. Nice"
"I got a lovely two fingers of eggshell-white head with good retention off of my pour. Color was a classic shade of deep-amber with NE-quality clarity and should be the standard for Lovibond in the style. Nose reminded me of just how fresh this was, courtesy of Sunday's visit to The Fridge. The grapefruit scent cut right through my burgeoning sinus headache and made my eyes pop. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was about as perfectly balanced between hops and malt as I have experienced for a while. You listening, Lazy Magnolia, with your overly hopped Deep South P.A.? Finish was semi-dry as compared to AIPAs which are my go-to, but perhaps dry when compared to others in the style. I am not a style maven, but I know what I like. I like this beer. My name is Woody Chandler and I approve this message."

"While I am not a fan of overly hoppy beers, this is one of the most flavorful pale ales I have had. Usually this style feels a bit watered down and very subtle, this one is much more in your face, it actually has a lot of flavor and a solid feel. If you are looking for a pale ale that stands out from the crowd, give this one a try."

"I have had the opportunity to purchase this pale ale a number of times in the last few years. I really enjoyed a couple of pints last weekend at Yardhouse in Glenview, IL . Give it a try if you like an easily drinkable but flavorful ale. I was a Bass Ale guy for my take-home brand but the new product they make in New York does not taste like the original pale ale from England. I'm looking for a replacement...any recommendations?"

"Overall: very one dimensional flavour, if strong and vibrant"
""
""

"Hops mostly in the smell and at the beginning of each sip, but then the carbonation tingles your tongue and you get the bready flavors at the end. A great example of the style -- definitely recommended."

"Overall: An OK APA that I was a bit disappointed with. The bitter spike in the middle muted a lot of the other flavors. I like Great Lakes beers, but this one did not sit as well with me as others have."
"Pine and grapefruit hit in the back of the mouth, then chewy malt bread notes gather to the front. Finishes dry with bitter orange notes. Nice carbonation levels keep the flavors lively."

"Cheers"

""

"The taste throws me for a loop when it is aggressively hopped with west coast strains and features the lemon and pine more broadly than many beers labeled as IPAs. Some respectable malt balance, with round biscuit and yeast flavors. Oily in texture but pretty tight overall. For a session pale, this is about as flavorful and hop dense as you can reasonably ask for."
""
"O - Nice balance of bitter and floral hops. I found the grapefruit pleasant, but I have a feeling that it might ruin it for some. I would drink again."

"Bottle into a pint glass. This is a great pale ale. Pours an amber color with a little bit of lacing and foam head. The beer is not very hoppy, but it still somehow satisfies my hop head. Probably because it is a well-balanced beer. The hops are floral and piney. Probably one of the best pale ales I have had."
""
""
"It is very light and highly carbonated. On the stronger side of most APAs but very easy to drink and refreshing."
""
""
"Amber-orange pour with fine half inch head. Scent of grass, citrus, and a touch of peat. Taste is much the same, a somewhat herbal tasting ale with notes of tangy citrus, hops and pine. Mouthfeel is thick for a pale ale, which is fantastic. Overall a well balanced and solid pale ale."
""
""
""
"On tap at Oxford, OH. Pours orange with a long lasting white and creamy head. Nose is of caramel, orange, and citrusy hops. Body is full, crisp and creamy. Taste is a lot of citrusy hops, caramel malt, and orange fruit. Finish is long, bitter and citrusy. Amazing taste, amazing balance of amazing PA."
"A nice pale ale, and i'll drink it again, but (perhaps because i've been drinking a lot of IPAs)while the hops provide bitterness to the taste and balance the malts, they provide little complexity beyond that."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color, with a thin but sticky cream-colored head. The aroma is certainly hop-forward, with notes of grassy hops and sweet citrus. The flavor is not bright and fresh, but it isn't tame either, with a dull orange rind and herbal bitterness being contrasted against a bready malt sweetness. The fine carbonation works well with the solidly resinous (but not overdone) body. Overall, this beer has substantial body and flavor, but it is also nicely drinkable."

"Clear gold under a solid off-white head of soapy looking cream. Aroma is a blend of citrusy and floral Cascades and more earthy, leafy hops along with some toasty malts. Straightforward, tasty, zesty citrus hop flavor over some cracker malts and a bit of caramel. The finish is lightly sweet and bitter. Medium bodied and crisp - goes down very easily. A nice, well-made, refreshing pale ale that (as always) is best when you can find a fresh bottle."

""

"The beer poured golden with an off white head. The aroma was light malt with some fruitiness, and hops. The taste is a little bit of malt up front, a small rush of fruit, and then a big hit of hops leaving a bitter aftertaste. The feel is light and dry. A bit over hopped for my taste, I could do with more of the malt and fruit. A pretty typical hoppy pale ale."
"O - This is going to be a clutch pale ale for me in WV were we don't distribution from many great breweries. Reminds me a lot of Dale's Pale ale with less alcohol warming. Great spring and summer beer."

"O: Overall, nothing crazy here but a very good example of the style.  My personal preference is APAs that are hop heavy, but no complaints here.  This is a well balanced and tasty sessionable pale ale that I could easily see becoming a go to for me  if it were readily available where I live.  Definitely worth a try.  "

" Although Clevelands last championship in sports was in the 60's, Great Lakes Brewery remains a winner every year, with its fantastic freshness and terrific beer."
"Poured a gently amber color with a slight haze, and a half inch or so of foamy white head. Aroma is grassy, floral, biscuity. Surprisingly drying hop profile in the taste right off the bat, citrus pith, grape skins, bready malts, with a bitter and intensely drying finish. Not necessarily a palate wrecker, but I wouldn't follow this one with a stout. Light-medium body, crisp and clean, and quite good overall for the style."

"O - A very well balanced pale ale. A very nice mix of hops citrusness and malt backbone. I dig it! Reminds me of the 420 I drink here in Atlanta, maybe only better"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by 5/20/2012. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a fairly dense 1 finger off white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange, caramel, apricot, pine, herbal, biscuit, honey, floral, and grass. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, biscuit, pine, floral, honey, orange, caramel, and herbal spiciness. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange, pine, biscuit, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great malt flavor balance with bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent and balanced pale ale that is highly enjoyable and flavorful."
""

"O- much more toned down than some other pale ales you'll see around, but this isn't bad at all."

"A well balanced brew, but no thrills."

"O - Very pleasing beer, overall. It's easy drinking and quite flavorful. Being on par with other APA's at $9.99/6 will have me reaching for this one on a regular basis."
""
""
""
""
"I am more of an IPA/Stout fan, but if I was to chose only a pale, so far this is one of my faves! (Although, I only think this is my 3rd pale so far...)"
""
""
""
"O - Another winner from Great Lakes. This is an excellent example of a pale ale, it is simple yet refreshing and tasty. Well done."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this APA is a prime example of a near perfect APA. Beautiful use of the hops and not even an IPA!!! All I can say is ""can I have another please"" Easy drinking."
"O-very refreshing and not too filling."
"This is a solid beer. It's balanced, flavorful, and refreshing. It's easy to drink though a little too carbonated for my liking. I would definitely have this again."
"O: The drinkability really sets this one apart. My glass was gone before I knew it, certainly could have gotten a couple pints and not thought twice about it."

"Really enjoyed the Burning River APA, but I could have gone for more hops. The smell was nice and not overpowering and really set you up for what you were about to taste. The appearance was nice, looked like an Amber Ale but a little lighter and didn't leave a whole lot of residual head."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel of Burning River is just like I would expect out of a pale ale, not so thick that it makes it hard to drink but thick enough that the flavors sticks to your tongue and you can enjoy what you are drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: A spicier take for a pale ale but interesting and very drinkable. This one is inviting to look at and easy going down. Could partake in a few easily."
"Pours a clear amber color with a frothy white head that lingers long enough to appreciate it. Aroma is mild and citrusy on account of the cascade hops. Flavor is crisp and hoppy, but not overbearing. Citrus notes are present, along with lively carbonation, followed by a clean finish. Quite a palatable pale ale, which is a style I'm not especially fond of, so take my numeric rating with a grain of salt."
""
""
""
"O - I'm standing by my ""yummy"" comment. This is one of the better PA's that I've ever had, and may be a regular addition to my fridge."
""
"Great Lakes with another win."
""
"Edit: After a re-rate, I’m not as high on this one, though it’s still good. I suspect I got a bad bottle. Strangely, it tasted and smelled just like the wort I boiled a few weeks ago in my first home brew batch. Almost as if the yeast did not get all the way through this most recent batch. Essentially tasted like slightly bitter malt extract. Not what I remember from my previous experiences with this living in Michigan, as it was one of my favorites. So I downgraded to 4.1 for now (was one of my top beers before). Would like to try one more time to get things straight. Tastes change, but something was off with the most recent bottle."
""
""
"The appearance is a nice clear orange color with a great head that lingers for a long, long time. The aroma is clean smelling with a nice citrus hoppiness to it. The taste is a wonderful mixture of malty roasted flavors with a slight overshadowing of wonderful floral and citrus hops. The flavor is extremely rich and well balanced. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean and light bodied. This is a wonderful pale ale that would be great at anytime of year, but especially to welcome spring and summer in. This might be my new favorite American pale ale."

"Good for a few of these."

"O: A great pale ale, one that has both complexity, and the restraint to enjoy all night."
""

""

"Light to medium bodied with great carbonation, this beer is a Cleveland staple when it comes to easy drinking Pale Ales. The body is refreshing and easy-drinking while allowing the flavors to really come out. The carbonation is a bit on the fizzy side but definitely help to make this beer very drinkable. Overall, the mouthfeel is on par for the style and makes this beer a real thirst-quencher."
""
""
""
"O - Very drinkable, will have to investigate that aftertaste, but this is recommended. Nothing too overpowering in the taste department, and the hops are restrained."

"O-The malt is noticeable and blends well with the hops. It is nice to see a beer focus on the malt and the hops and blend them together well."

"O - Good pale ale. Doesn't really stand out among other pale ales, but it is well made."
"This beer poured out as a yellowish gold color with a decent head on top. The smell of the beer was a little hoppy with some a good portion of grainy malts on the nose too. The taste of the beer was clean a crisp with a good bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer was on the lighter side and was drinkable. Overall this beer was pretty good, It's a nice beer to have when socializing and stuff. Worth trying for sure."

"definitely more of an english style pale ale, with the dusty like malts and just light fruity cascade hops in the taste. pours a tiny bit amber in color, with a receding white head and inch tall. smells like a bass ale, and tastes similar, just a bit bigger hop flavor. mouthfeel brings it way down for me, weakly carbonated fading to nearly flat as it warms, not a quick finish at all, even a little brassy at the end. definitely not my favorite pale ale and definitely not my favorite great lakes brew, but a decent amalgamation of the english and american syles..."

"Been a while since I have had something from Great Lakes. It has an appearance of a light amber tone with a one finger had. The nose has pine and citrus hops. While the taste has quite a bit of malt, more hops, orange and other citrus fruit. MF is medium with a nice, crisp, dry fisish. A pretty good pale ale, but nothing special."

"Great Lakes Burning River pours a crystal clear golden-orange color with a large white head. Smells sweet and citrusy thanks to the cascades. Hop taste through and through.. Similar to the nose (sweet and citrusy) with a bit more of a punch and a decent hoppy bitterness on the end. Hoppy sweetness and bitterness lingers in the aftertaste begging for another sip. This is one of my top 5 APA's if you haven't had it. Get it!"
"Another knockout style by Great Lakes. They very rarely wow, but are spot on on style. Good, but not overwhelming bitterness and a very pleasant brew."
"Overall, another fine contribution from GL."
"Overall: This is an average beer with nothing special about it. Reminds me more of a pilsner than a pale ale. A decent beer."
"O: Obviously, I'm a big fan of this beer. Burning River has a lot of complexity for an APA. It's versitile enough to slow sip on a cool Autumn evening or enjoy at a ballgame in the middle of summer. I would recommend this to anyone."
"Burning River is a BIG APA that is hoppier than some IPA’s. Not being a hop lover I scored the overall rating lower than a true hop head would. If you like hoppy brews this is a must try."
"O: Solid pale ale. Would like to try one from a bottle."
"Overall: It's a decent beer that manages to get the job done, although I've had better APAs. I would recommend this beer as a ""gateway"" beer to anyone whose looking into getting into any type of Pale Ale."
"overall - decent beverage that i'm glad to have the opportunity to try"
"That being said I know there is a market for this type of beer and maybe I'll change my mind once I aggitate it a little to get some carbonation out"
"O- I really, really wish I could get this in Eastern PA, as this would be my go-to Pale. Fantastic."
"My least favorite from the GL taster's pack. Not a bad APA, just not my favorite."
"O: Above average, but not monumentally so. A decent pale ale, but nothing that sticks out. I wouldn't spend money on a six pack."
"Overall: Definitely a good pale ale, balanced enough, but also hoppy enough to please my inner hophead."
"Best Pale Ale I've had."
"There is just something here that is bothering me and I think the age on this is a factor. It is right at the best buy date so I’m thinking that a month fresher could really help here. That said this is still much better than the vast majority of pales. Well worth seeking out and at 8 bucks a sixer you just can’t go wrong!"
"O: Since I love IPAs, and this is what it takes like, this American pale ale was right up my alley. I’ve tasted some IPAs that weren’t this hoppy! Well done."
" Overall a nice tasting and refreshing APA. In my opinion Great lakes always comes through with solid beers. Easy drinker here."
"This is a good pale ale. I like that its not just focused on the hops and has a malty character to it."
"My first Great Lakes offering. Grabbed a sixer at Whole Foods this afternoon. I missed the chance to have this on tap at TJ's recently, so I'm glad to have a chance to enjoy this. Beer pours a gorgeous transparent amber color. The nose is a bit muted, but there's a very pleasant light citrus nose followed by some malt. The taste in this is definitely on the malty side, although the initial taste showcases some nice hops. The finish is way sweet. The mouthfeel is very light and creamy, with the maltiness mentioned previously hanging around. Overall this is a nice beer. I'd like more hops, but, this is an APA and not an IPA, and it' in line with the style. A good beer bye and bye."
"Overall Drinkability - Decent if completely forgettable middle-of-the-road pale ale."
"Yet another winner from the great folks at Great Lakes."
"A pretty well balanced pale ale for the most part. Would have preferred a little bit more of a citrus hop flavor in the taste, but an otherwise excellent APA. Will drink again for sure."
"Mouthfeel and overall - Light to medium bodied. A pleasant and easy burn. Citrusy and appropriately carbonated."
"Pours a clear deep copper/amber color with a bubbly beige head that impales itself to the glass all the way down. Smells of citrus, light sweet fruit, slight mineral. Taste is smooth citrus with a fruity burnt sugar malt sweetness. Good balance! Twinge of hops, bit of malt leaves a hop bite at the end of every sip. Crisp carbonation, sticky, resinous mouthfeel, medium body with a semi dry finish. Good session ale here."
"Overall a great balanced hop forward pale ale."
"Poured a copper amber with slight turbidity and a head that quickly dissipates. Moderate hop aroma, floral and citrus balanced with malt aroma. Clean malt profile, citrus and grapefruit lingering in the background, with a crisp finish on the palate. Overall a very good and very drinkable beer, but I did not personally find anything that stands out about this beer."
"This brew pours the standard pale amber color with two fingers of head that quickly drops down. The aroma has some nice hops over some pale malts, but it's a little weak compared to what I'd prefer. The taste is upfront hoppy, with plenty of bitter grapefruit rind to go along with it. The mouthfeel is nice, it's bubbly on the way down the throat, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, a solid brew, and one that I'd keep in rotation if it were local."
"Drinkability – This went down extremely well but it is a rather big beer so be prepared for that. This is not a light-drinker APA, it is a heavy, thick beer that is best consumed on an empty stomach. If you can take it, or if you are just a big fan of smooth, hoppy ales then you’ll love this beer."
"O: Definitely something to add to the rotation. Picked this up at a Sheetz driving through the Buckeye State and would definitely buy again for the same price ($7.99/6)."
"O-I was overall, a little dissapointed by this beer, being a gold medalist of the World Beer Championships, and has over 800 reviews and an A average. Maybe I'll try it again fresher I hope."
"This beer has a golden body with a 1""foamy, creamy white head on top of it. The smell is earthy and hops. The taste is very balanced. first the hops comes, them a little spiciness and then a nice bitter after taste. Very nice mouth feel, smooth off the tongue. Overall a good, well balanced beer."
"Really a damn fine APA, worth checking out."
"O: Despite being over a month expired, this beer held up well. I would guess the smell would improve if more proximal to bottle date, but hey, not in my market. Solid beer nonetheless."
"Taste - Biscuity with caramel and citrus flavours. Finishes slightly bitter with a lingering biscuity aftertaste. Like good APAs, it is hoppy without being aggressively bitter."
"O: While this is a drinkable beer, it isn't up there with the better pale ales that I've had."
"Overall: This is what I've been missing being in China for a year. Pale ales, IPAs, DIPAs, anything with significant hops character has not yet made an impression in China. What a welcome home! Supremely drinkable."
"The Great Lakes Burning River Pale Ale is another great offering by the Cleveland Brewery. The appearance is a rich clear copper color. The carbonation is very good that led to at least a finger think head....which laced thoughout the draw. The smell is dominated by pine, but there is a touch of smoke or roast. The taste is very good. There is a good balance of hop and malt that keep the beer from being too bitter. The taste is slightly down graded because I did taste some Alcohol which I though was interesting cuz its not a high ABV. The mouth feel is fine...certainly could session without question. Overall is is a very good beer."
"Though not as mind-explodingly good as Edmund Fitzgerald or Dortmunder, this is nevertheless a great tasting pale, that is light and crisp enough to quench a thirst on a humid afternoon, yet tasty enough to sit and ponder over."
"Pours a clear copper color with stark white head and some decent lace. The aroma is of a caramel malt backbone with a big piney and citrus hop characteristic to it. The taste follows suit with a caramel malt backbone and a bitterness due to citrus and piney hops throughout. The beer is bitter thoughout but does have balance with the malt. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated with a dry finish. Overall a very soild pale ale. The tatse is balanced and consistent throughout. Very good beer."
"I would buy this again for sure. It fits great with the time of year, very refreshing and just a tad fruity. I could see myself drinking a few of these outside on a hot day. I just wish my apartment had a terrace."
"O - I really enjoyed this brew. I have become to enjoy Pale ales as I age. I didnt pay much attention to them when I first started drinking quality brews. GLBC have a lot of great tasting brews coming out of Cleveland,Ohio. They always leave me satisfied and I always find myself buying more. Burning River is another one of my favorites and is a true quality Pale ale and brew experience thanks to GLBC."
"M - Very well carbonated. Thin, in a pleasing way that makes this Pale Ale very drinkable, especially on a hot summer evening."
"O: A very classic tasting pale ale. There weren't any other flavors thrown in there and other flavors weren't dominating. Pretty simple and well balanced."
"O:Very good APA. Definitely shows its Pale Ale characteristics. Has a balanced mix of hops and malts."
"Pours clear amber with visible bubbles rising from the bottom. Head fades fairly quickly but initially it forms a delightful poofy layer. Aroma is nice and refreshing. Hop amount is just where I like it. Solid bready malts as well. I like the taste a lot too. Great balance going on here. Again, very refreshing. Mouthfeel is right where it should be. Smooth with good medium body. I'll certainly pick this up again. It has joined my list of favorite pale ales."
"D - Great beer; even better out of the tap; I've had this plenty of times before while visiting Ohio and if available, I'll grab it; strong, but not too strong hop flavor and perfect for session of beer drinking"
"O - Very nice summer beer - or anytime beer really - that is simple to enjoy. It's not one that you need to sit down and really chew over all the flavors. Yet it still gives enough to make this very enjoyable."
"Pours clar with a golden/amber hue. Thick head and takes a few seconds longer then usual to settle. Has a rather light hop aroma with a lingering hint of caramel and hidden sweetness that is hard to place. If this was a blind tasting you wouldn't know it was a Pale ale till you took your first taste. The hops makes its presents know but then leaves and you are left you the hops coating the tounge, littl more bitter then your usual pale ale."
"If you don't get Great Lakes you should definitely do a trade to get this. It's an American Pale Ale at its best, and tastes totally unique at the same time."
"O-> This looked and smelled a lot more like an Amber upon first inspection. Only the taste really indicates otherwise. That being said, I really enjoyed my first GL brew. It was a solid American Pale Ale that was very well balanced and refreshing. Perhaps the American Pale Wheat Ale kick I've been on lately threw me off on the smell and appearance on this one at first but that is beside the point. I could quaff the shit out of this brew even on the hottest of days. Cheers!"
"Medium bodied and very hop forward with a dry, bitter character up front that lingers over the sweet malt into a spicy, dry finish. Slightly resinous with an earthy pine presence that is balanced by sweet citrus fruit. Hints of grapefruit and orange peel balanced by a sweet caramel malt backbone that gives off notes of toast and biscuit."
"Seriously, it looks good and tastes great. My neighbor really enjoyed it and I was very impressed as well. Pale Ales are very obscure to me but this had a nice flavor, mouthfeel and everything else to make it a really good beer. My second ever offering from Great Lakes....now I can't wait to try that Edmond Fitz, but alas, I only have 1 so it must be saved for something special..."
"A good APA. I enjoyed it, but probably wouldn't buy it again (unless it was on sale). I tend to lean towards APAs with a bit more maltiness. When I want hops, I'll get an IPA."
"O – Good solid APA. Very drinkable. Nothing to make it stand above other APA’s but this makes a great cold brew on a hot summer day."
"O- Great pale ale, mildly bitter and a nice malt balance."
"Serving type: bottle poured into a pint glass"
"Overall, a solid pleasing example of the style - hop forward (probably more so when it's fresh?) with a zesty malty back."
"O: It's a very good offering from what is considered a very good brewery. Is it the best pale ale that I have ever had? Of course not.. but it's not bad by any stretch. It's a very well balanced beer that I wouldn't reject if it were offered to me."
"O: I like the tap iteration better than the bottle. I wish I could get this on draft out in CA..."
"The taste was similar to a Sierra Nevada. However, the flavor was a little more distinct and pronounced. This had a nice smoothness. Basically, it was just an all around good pale ale. For the money it can't be beat. Full of flavor, but not overwhelming...an all purpose pale ale."
"O - This is a very well balanced beer. Probably my favorite pale ale, and an easy go to beer as it's local. I've yet to have a GLBC beer that I don't enjoy."
"Had this a million times, yet I had not rated it yet....hmmmm. I just had the 11 beer sampler at GLB, so I can get caught up on some of these. Nice ruby-golden color with a white head. Very hoppy aroma, some light grass and fruits from the malt as well. Medium body, almost an IPA, But since I drank the Commodore Perry....I clearly see(taste) the Difference. Better on tap. Good Stuff."
"Pours a nice dark copper with a a tight 1 finger head that smears and laces around the glass. Big sweet hops hit the nose, very fruity mix of cherries and berries with a bold malt and bitter hops. So good on the tongue, the malts give almost a woody, and chocoatly taste blended well with distinct hop presence but not overwhelming, bready and sweet. Light to medium on the feel, low carbonation. Overall, this is awesome, its a little bigger than your average APA, with a little more breadiness and a solid hop balance."
"Pours a deep yellow orange with a big pale tan head that falls to a thigh blanket. Great lacing. Smells of citrus hops and sweet malt. The taste is not overly complex like the nose. It's mild citrus hops with a sweet malt backbone. Nice lingering fruit with slightly dry aftertaste. Sweetness makes it's appearance after half a glass. Really pretty refreshing on a whole. Body is light/medium with average carbonation level. Overall a nice brew a little on the sweet side if you're drinking several."
"what is most impressive to me is that they managed to mask a 6%abv so damn well. one could easily approach this as a session beer only to realize five beers late they can barely get off the couch"
"O: A good offering from my favorite brewery, but alas, not quite my favorite from their lineup. Fairly pedestrian, but well balanced and highly drinkable. Recommended, but I'd prefer a more complex brew like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"O: A good beer all-around but not in the great category for the style. Needs more malt depth or hops uniqueness to really bump up to the next tier."
"Overall: A very good American Pale Ale."
"A solid and representative American pale ale. Recommended."
"Overall, its a good beer. If GL was available to me, I'd pick it up again for sure."
"Really solid pale ale, different than most west coast pale ales. Really liked this interpretation."
"drinkability: while refreshing and mellow, the nose indicated a more tangy character than what manisfested in the taste, which ended up being more piney, but nevertheless very drinkable, and abv is adequate for a pale ale."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O- This is a nice solid pale ale that is enjoyable throughout the year, easy to obtain (here) and I wouldn't mind having a few more of."
"Overall, I prefer the dogfish head 90 IPA - that is my go to IPA. this seems still to have too much bite. But, I am not an IPA fan generally. This is a solid middle of the road for me."
"This is what I'm talking about. Highly recommended."
"O-This was the first beer I could not finish when I started getting into craft beer a couple years ago and I can't believe I thought this beer was too bitter but it was at the time. This is my first time having it since and this time around I thought it a had a very strong fruitiness, that seemed strange for the style. My least favorite of the Great Lakes year-round offerings."
"o - Really quite good. Even past its prime this is one of the better Pale Ales you can get. Goes down easy, and still has a nice hop character."
"D- 4.5 I could enjoy plenty of these. Very well balanced taste and smooth. It isn't heavy. Great session brew."
"Overall a solid choice if you see it. Good subtle flavors that are interesting sip after sip. You could drink a few and the beer would still seem fresh and new. I wish the flavors were stronger but it is Just a pale ale so I understand."
"Clear, pale amber color, with a moderate off white head that dissipated quickly. Aromas of toast, malt and grains are fresh and not overpowering. There are broad, well-balanced and bracing citrus hop flavors, which are complemented by some roasted malt on the mid-palate. Very nice and drinkable ale; it would be easy to enjoy several of these without it being taxing or overly hoppy."
"D: Drinkability is fair. I wouldn't go with more than two at a time, but that's just me."
"One of the best examples of an American Pale Ale...this is the reason I think American beers are on their way to surpassing the British Style pale. Well crafted balance of malt and bitter hops, a great bite at the end, deep reddish color and a creamy head with good retention. I love this brewery and this is one of their best"
"Overall: A perfectly simple and tasty APA. A good beer to frequent during the summer and warmer months. Goes well will lots of hearty, full meals."
"This very drinkable. Slightly above average in ABV, with a cleansing quality to the palate. This beer can keep you company all night."
"Very good brew, worth enjoying."
"Best by 4/25/11."
"Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated and finished full yet deliciously bone dry. Bitterness lingers so so so minimally which is perfect for the style. Overall, this and Deschutes Mirror Pond are the best 2 Pale Ales I have ever had."
"Overall, I was quite impressed with this offering from Great Lakes."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. A bit hoppier than your average PA bujt still nice balance. A lingering sweetness finishes nicely. Good job of balancing the components here."
"Drinkability - Decent amount of hops in this pale ale,made me double check the label to make sure it wasn't an Ipa, Very drinkable .well balanced brew."
"All in all I'd definetely drink it again but it is not as tasty as some of the other beers from Great Lakes."
"D: I was able to finish it, but the residual hop presence in the mouth along with the bitter aftertaste would keep me from ordering another one. This would probably be good with some strong dishes, heat or spice. I laughed, as it almost tasted like a decadent burning river.."
"This is my second beer on tap from obryckis in the cleveland, oh airport. And this one is also lacking carbonation. The beer is very good however. Hippy floral and woody notes that blend well together. Gives the beer a very nice bitterness that doesn't really overpower the taste buds. That makes this a very enjoyable pale ale. Simple its good."
"A good beer, but in the end I have to compare to the gold standard. Is this American Pale as good as SNPA? not quite. It's good, one I would purchase if I wads in the region, but nothing I would go above and beyond for."
"D -- Nice offering, approachable yet interesting. Solid brew."
"Great IPA, very tasty and refreshing and easy to session. Would recommend."
"D: Goes down pretty easily, but the residual bitterness keeps me from wanting many more. Overall not a very impressive pale ale."
"D - very session-worthy"
"Great APA - to me, not overdone in terms of hops - very sessionable. No brainer here..."
"D - Drank my glass with no problem. A nice APA, but I've certainly had better."
"Pours a clear golden color with a large white head that has very good retention, good carbonation and excellent lacing. It has a floral hops, sweet malts and earth tones in the aroma. When taking a sip of this beer I get some floral hops at first followed by some caramel and than a citrus orange taste follows. There also seems to be an alcohol and yeast taste in the background while some hops are in the forefront of the taste. The aftertaste is floral hops and an orange citrus taste that is not too over powering. This is a nice and creamy mouthfeel that is pleasing on the palate and even though I'm pretty new to this style, I'll admit it is one of the best APA's I've tried."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet/skunky malt and wheat. The flavor was of skunky malt, wheat, and sweet malt. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this wasn't a bad brew, but it also wasn't that great either. The skunky aspect on this one hurt this brew overall. I would have loved for it to have a little hop character to help overcome some of the skunkiness going on here. Get rid of the skunk aspect and I would be willing to try again. Until then, not so much..."
"Drinkabilty - A fantastic beer, smooth, mild, lower alcohol and great taste. One of the best pale ales you can buy. Very easy to drink a 6-pack in a sitting, so be carefull! A must try pale ale."
"D - I have been impressed by every Great Lakes beer I ever had and this one is no exception. Full of hoppy goodness, solid malt base sweetening the deal, and affordable cost (cases starting at a mere 28 bucks) its pretty much a go to beer. A world class Pale ale!"
"D: Great drinkability has sessionable potential."
"D - Pretty good, the beer itself is fairly tasty, but I don't know that I would have more than one or two. Still, glad I got a chance to try it, and if I'm ever in an area that sells it again, I may grab another sixer."
"Many beer drinkers, when they first move beyond terrible adjunct lagers, look down their nose on pale ales and lagers because they feel it is closer to what they now detest and can barely stand the taste of (industrial plant beer) and espouse a preference for more severely malted or hopped varieties, or bigger beers, but great beers are great beers, plain and simple."
"Poured from a bottle to a beer mug. Strikingly gorgeous clear orange color. Smallish head that disappears rather quickly, leaving half moon lacing. It has a citrusy scent that mixes with grainy hops. Flavor follows the smell. Strong hop presence. Not the easiest to drink, but a great flavor, citrus beginning, quickly dominated by hop bitterness. Full flavor mouthfeel, how a beer should feel. A little dry on the finish. Good brew"
"D/M: slight carbonation tingle, very smooth on the pallet, a very easy drinking brew, one of the best pale ales I've ever had"
"Pours a pretty clear orange yellow color with a huge tan head that doesn't go away quickly and a ton of lacing. Smells of piney hops, and a little citrus. Tastes of hops, citrus, and some hidden malts. Mouthfeel is medium and has a little carbonation. Drinkability is moderate."
"I'm gonna go ahead and say it: this is my favorite beer. I think I've gotten a bit spoiled living in Cleveland, where every bar (even the lame-ass ones) carries this on tap. It is hoppy as hell, but drinkability is still totally exceptional. The rare beer that's perfect for every season -- warming enough for a cold winter day like today, and still gets the job done in the middle of the dog days of summer."
"Drinkability - This would make for an unreal session beer, why can we not stock this at the LCBO?! Major props to Spinrsx for finding this beer and sharing it with me, i am blessed and honoured to have you in my beer life :)"
"Like I said, this is hoppy. Maybe hoppier than alot of IPAs. In the end, it works and GL doesn't go overboard. Super flavorful; easily one of the best pale ales out there!"
"decent taste. a good mix of hop and malt (as indicated by the smell). a good balance of flavors. good mouthfeel - nice crisp flavor with good carbonation leaving a pleasant bitter aftertaste."
"Overall another fantastic beer by GLBC. Not necessarily a head turner but a superbly crafted brew."
"The carbonation id upfront on the tongue it builds and lingers on the tongue. The taste starts malty pale and a slight butter crystal malt finish"
"This isn't hard to drink at all, and nothing here tastes bad. But I stopped to pick some Great Lakes up while out of town because they don't distribute where I live, and I was expecting a hoppy beer here. The other stuff I got from them (namely Edmund Fitzgerald) was great. But this doesn't taste like what it's billed as, and it's relatively fresh. I plan on heading to the Midwest next summer, where I will likely have this again. I hope my opinion changes once I have this from the source at GL."
"Would have another...as a matter of fact, excuse me while I indulge.;)"
"Poured a nice deep amber color from a 12 oz bottle with ABV and ""best-by"" date on the label. Two finger head which dissipates slowly. Aroma is a blend of hops, pine, citrus with a hint of sweetness. Taste upfront is malty with a nice hoppy finish. Solid carbonation with very nice lacing. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is very high. This is definitely a beer for any occasion. Another solid beer from Great Lakes, highly recommended."
"This is a very good beer for the style. Fresher, it is usually a little hoppier than this, but even in this bottle it is still good. Got 2 more bottles of it to go. Should be a good night."
"D: This one went down very easily. Once again, I'm impressed with Great Lakes. They just seem to make very nicely flavored, easy-drinking beers. Put this one up there with SNPA and Anchor's Liberty Ale as showcases of the style."
"Drinkability is just flat out high."
"Pours a clear, dulled gold color with moderate cap of white head, minimal lacing. Scent is a balanced mix of bready, lightly roasted malts and grassy and citrus (grapefruit) hops. Taste brings the same balance, but quite bitter notes coming from the grain and hops, somewhat earthy and grassy. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, lingers on tongue. A good pale ale, definitely more balanced than many west coast style APAs that are more common."
"This beer tastes so good it's hard to put down. Full of smoky maltiness, and balanced by exactly the right amount of hoppy bitterness. It's an award-winning brew, and it certainly deserves them. Pale Ales of all types are my favorite styles, and this is one of the best examples of the style I've ever tasted, and flavor is the name of the game."
"D: Light and easy to drink. Sessionable for sure. I have definitely sessioned this in the past without any issues."
"A very enjoyable beer with delicious malt and hop characteristics. By far one of my favorite brews from Great Lakes. Wouldnt mind having another."
"Burning River is super drinkable and well made. I just keep coming back to the world ""clean."" This is sort of like a pale ale that was brewed to be like a easy drinking German lager. This is a quality beer and a great one to enjoy if you want the conversation of your company to speak louder than the flavors in your pale ale."
"Drink - Just a fantastic pale ale, I'd rank this one up there with Sierra Nevada. It is extremely sessionable and it is a must try for pale ale fans."
"D: Pretty easy to drink but a little bitter in the finish."
"Pours pale orange topped by large white bubbly head. Smells of citrus notes, slight floral, and lemon zest. Tastes citrus notes, floral, lemon zest, some rind but mostly fruit sweetness without the bitter, hops but not too bitter, dry finish. Light in body with medium carbonation. A good representation of the APA. Light, citrus, dry."
"Tastes is imeadiatley thick of hop with a touch of bready malt and a nice citrus finish. Laced ncley down the glass as I went along"
"Poured into a tulip. The color is a light copper with a white head. Decent enough retention but as it falls there's no real lacing. Nose brings some nice citrus and grassy hops with a moderate pale malt base. The taste really focuses in on some grassy hops, which I always seem to get from Great Lakes hoppy offerings and I can't say that I'm really a fan. Feel is slightly bitter with a bit of lightly-sweet malt backing. Drinks well in the end, but the flavor just isn't quite for me."
"Lots of malt in the flavor. Surprisingly thick bodied. Faint, faint hint of hops in the finish. Sweet, too. Starts out fairly creamy and grows very rich. Substantial roast barley in the middle. Beer definitely getting better as it warms, with more herbal hops coming out in the finish. Pretty nice."
"D - Pretty drinkable brew, for some reason I wasn't sure if I would like this one. It turned out I did. Got this one in the Great Lakes sampler. I recommend trying it!"
"Medium body that has a clean fresh taste and is nicely balanced."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure I would want more than two or three of these in a night of heavy drinking but one hits the spot. Very interesting for a APA."
"This is not your average pale ale. It's orange with decent lacing, but the nose has a surprising smoky/earthy note along with the apricot hops, and the taste picks up on that--oaky toasted malt, bright apricot and peach taste, a hoppy but sweet end, a very creamy mouthfeel all add up to one drinkable beer. I loved it."
"Very Drinkable. One of my favorite pale ales!"
"(sheds a bitter tear)"
"D- what a bitter brew! A bouquet of hops and delicious malt. Great brew from great lakes"
"It pours an golden to amber color that is completely clear with a little bit of white head on top. The smell is not over powering but give hints of citrus and some piney-ness. From the first sip those citrus and pine flavors kick right in. The carbonation adds a good amount of fix to it and makes this beer extremely drinkable. Great Lakes Brewing Co. makes some amazing beers and this one is tied with Eddie Fitz for my favorite right now."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp thanks to tight carbonation. This beer would easily cut through thick cream sauces or gravy. Drinkability is good."
"d- good, goes down easily, not the best pale ale ever, but it's solid and drinkable."
"D - This has become my go-to pale ale in the last several weeks and a favorite among my almost craft-drinking friends. The lack of bitterness in the hops and the malt forwardness make this a crowd favorite."
"M/D: All of the flavors match well together, with none seeming to overdue the others, which let's the beer shine pretty well. This was a good first beer from Great Lakes, can't wait to get into the rest of them."
"Best before date of 10/10/10 which I will take into account. Pours a clear golden color with a frothy white head that retains well and leaves nice lacing. The aroma has some nice citrus and floral hops upfront, along with some caramel and fruity esters, biscuit and some alcohol, not outstanding but I'm sure it was more impressive when it was fresher. The flavor also has floral and citric hops initially, along with some caramel and biscuit, fruity esters, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is light and drinkability is really good. Pretty damn solid pale ale, I wish I could have tried a fresher example but it was good nonetheless."
"Deep yellow color with an amber hue and excellent clarity. Thin white head that reduces to a similarly thin white cap. Floral hoppy aroma with citrus notes. Buttery smooth with refreshing, lively carbonation. Citrus and pine hop flavors along with a bit of malty flavored goodness in there as well. Good balance of hop and malt flavor until the end when the pine flavors take over and leave a dry, mild bitter pine aftertaste."
"D - Good, but not overly impressive. Glad to try it...would definitely give it another shot."
"End Beer Musings: though my rating may say differently I did enjoy the flavor aspect of this drink, the most important. When not scrutinizing such factors such as appearance and aroma, you will find this to be a good pale with a moderate strong hopping per style and worthy of a try and to put down in repeats."
"Notes: Good to have this in a bottle after enjoying it on tap at the brewery so long ago. I will be sure to find a fresh one and report back here with any changes."
"DB- A smooth, easy drinking beer. Hop forward but they are definitely balanced by a strong malt finish and backbone. Not too much of anything, balanced and refreshing."
"This is a beer I've had many times, and have always found it highly drinkable. Perhaps my favorite of the regularly-offered beers, I highly recommend it."
"D: Very drinkable. Nothing offensive, well balanced, tasty, can't ask for much more."
"Without a doubt, this beer displays its American Pale Ale traits; it's balanced, yet with the hops, always up front. Surpassing the benchmark is our conclusion. Proof that a Mid-American brewery can well hop a Pale Ale like the rest of them. Good use of Cascade hops!"
"I gave this a pretty hard pour because last time I had it was from draft and I'm curious what it'll do. A heavy pour into the center of the glass gives a big 3"" of frothy bubbly beige head that lingers pretty well. The head leaves a bunch of spotty chunky lace on the glass. Smell is some soft orangey citrus hop and milky smoothness, like a semi-bitter orange creamcicle. Taste is mild and subdued, much like the nose but dialed back a few big notches, plus a little diacetyl and maybe vanilla. Orange creamcicle indeed. A little sharp pine hop also tries to fight through and, although it is very minor, it stands out quite easily and I wonder if the beer would be better off without it. Mouthfeel is even and smooth, smooth and appropriate carbonation. Finish is smooth and creamy but dry on the tongue. Tasty."
"drinkability: very drinkable. strong flavor of hops but well balanced with malt, with nothing being too intense or intrusive. At 6% with good flavor while not being too intense it makes it very east to drink a few. However it may be too bitter and strong tasting for some as compared to the lighter or milder tasting pale ales."
"O: This one will please the masses, but doesn't really stick out in my mind."
"Medium bodied and highly carbonated. Overall a good beer that drinks easily."
"D: good drinkability"
"this is a pretty damn good beer. goes down easy and represents the style well. puts a lot of other pale ales i've had to shame."
"As far as APA's are concerned, I'd rate this high for drinkability. The balance is there, the hops aren't overbearing, and it's easy drinking."
"D: This is a fantastic pale ale. I could probably drink this all night. I would love to try this on tap. If I were to guess, I'd say this was about 4% but it is 6%."
"Pretty good APA overall, and another solid beer from GLBC. Well worth trying if you see it on the shelf."
"(D)- A solid to great pale ale. A good refresher with a solid balance and taste."
"Not a bad beer, but not the best I have had from great lakes."
"D - Good hot day sipping beer but a bit light on the flavor for my tastes."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of hops. Taste is also of hops, lightly malted, a good balance, slightly bitter at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a quality brew."
"This is a great example of the type. It will be one of my goto brews. It is very drinkable."
"D: I could drink this all day long, this is in my top 5 favorite APAs."
"This beer is very balanced and tame with not too much hop domination (not that it would necessarily be a bad thing). Some pale ales are borderline IPAs, but Burning River finds a good balance."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking, but satisfying. A little strong for a session beer."
"Picked this up at a great beer store, Save-On Tobacco & Beverage in Mentor, Ohio. Clear orange-yellow pour with a nice head and decent lacing. Very odd nose for a pale ale. Kind of earthy and salty with none of the typical perfumy, floral pale smell I love. Really had to strain to get anything remotely hoppy. The taste was much better than the smell. Lots of caramel malt with a touch of fruitiness and just enough bitterness to balance it out. Great, slightly chewy mouthfeel and highly drinkable if you can get past the nose."
"I had this on tap at a local bar. The color was a clear amber with very little foam. There was a mild hops aroma, with no malt in the smell. The taste was of rich malt, but not too sweet, and a bitter finish, mildly spicy and floral. There was nothing special in terms of mouth feel. A typical pale ale, very drinkable."
"Another great offering from a great brewery that just came to the Twin Cities Market. This pale is toasty and rich, slightly honey-sweet. The hops appropriate and harmonious with the big hit of hops at the tail end of this treat. Clean copper color, Nice white head. Great Lakes really has a handle on every style I have tried from them. Thanks for remembering that we are on the Great Lakes, Great Lakes Brewing Company!"
"D - This is a drinkable, but pretty standard IPA. It has a nice hop flavor, though the aroma is a bit weak. It is a very drinkable and that is probably the most important factor for a beer like this."
"D: this is a serious ale, and could be great with food, too."
"O - It's not bad by any means, it just doesn't seem remarkable in any way to me for the most part. It's possible that I got an old bottle, since there was no date."
"Enjoy - T"
"So enough of my BS, for anybody reading this who is considering buying some, do it. You can't go wrong. It's a beautiful, tastey brew. Get a 12 or a case! Off to my yard work and another Burning River. Reach for a river! (Oh, that was the Crooked River folks, but they are gone now)."
"D - It's alright, but for the low ABV, the 12 oz was not the easiest thing to finish and I don't really want another one."
"D - Easy drinker, real smooth. Would drink again but won't seek out."
"Aroma is strong and malty with a spicy, salty and slightly hoppy undertone. It pours a nice clear golden amber with a thick creamy off-white head that dissipates slowly. Flavor is malty and crisp, with fruity and hoppy tones and just a hint of herbs. Texture is silky smooth yet leaves a nice tingle behind."
"This is one easy drinkin' brew! Nothing jumps out and wows you...flavor or complexity wise, but overall a very nice offering."
"Good overall. Nit-picking, I'd want the sweetness to be a little more subdued, the hops more pronounced, & the ABV a little lower, but that's nit-picking. Still very smooth, tasty, & drinkable."
"A great example of a pale, though I might classify it more as the English style rather than APA. I haven't been too into pale ales lately so it's good to have one that reminds me of the potential."
"I pair it with some Pasta with a marinara sauce. Nice match."
"Drinkability: Very good Pale Ale. It's not my favorite, but it could definitely be a regular in my refrigerator."
"D: A wonderfully well balanced pale ale that should be enjoyed sip by sip."
"Overall: Probably the best gateway Great Lakes."
"D: A great example for the style and one that I love. Very aromatic with great flavor."
"Pours a mildly clouds lighter orange color with a nice fluffy white head. Nose is nice pine and resin with some sugary sweetness, quite pleasant. Taste is pine up from, second act is the sweeter candy malts, and the finish is mild bitter hops. Mouthfeel is fine but not noteable. I want more."
"A very good beer that I wish was distributed in FL."
"D - A very good pale ale. Not a single complaint about this one. Another great GL beer."
"Back during my Boilermaker years, my boyz and I believed that if the Wabash ever had a cigarette thrown it, it would explode into an inferno that would make Lucifer consider relocating. This has no real importance, but this beer tends to bring that memory bubbling to the surface. (Seriously, don't swim in the Wabash.) It pours a clear copper topped by a tall bit of thick, light ecru froth, which leaves some decent lacing behind as it subsides. The nose is pretty unspectacular, with notes of caramel, maple syrup, and a light touch of hops (not citrus, not floral, just hops in general). The taste comprises a slight bit o' citrus, some bitterness, and a solidly bready caramel backbone. The body is a light medium, with light carbonation and a crisp finish. Not bad, though I wish the smell were a little better."
"This could pass for some brewery's IPA. The color has something to do with that. Could see 3 of these being the proper dosage in one sitting. Well-balanced and enjoyable enough to have around."
"medium to light body. goes down very easy and smooth. really good drinkability, great session beer. one of the better pale ales out there."
"D- Nicely balanced beer with enough hop kick that makes this a great alternative to an I.P.A."
"Buy Again? No."
"Relatively clean mouthfeel except for that slight chalkiness in the finish, typical of an over-hopped brew. Carbonation felt just right. As a fan of big and bold flavors, I usually don't pick up many Pale Ales -- but this one was a nice surprise! Recommended."
"D- Very drinkable, the 6% is nicely situated in this one, almost big enough to be an IPA but drinkable enough to be a daily pale ale, nice balance, refreshing, clean, bitter and hoppy, fantastic beer."
"D: Good APA. Smooth and drinkable. Representative of the style."
"The taste also features oranges and grapefruit. There is also a caramel malt backbone which I did not initially pick up from the aroma. Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, and an easy beer to drink. I will seek this out again."
"Tasty and hard to sip. I'd drink this anytime, and often with food."
"Overall, this beer is very good. I will be drinking more of it in the future."
"Great Lakes Burning River pale ale pours a couple fingers of loose foam over a gorgeous clear orange tea-colored brew. A steady stream of carbonation bring up a citrusy nose of Pacific Northwestern hops. Flavor is typical APA- slightly sweet, bready light malts up front, grapefruit rind citrusy hops off the back. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a long hop aftertaste. Pretty typical American Pale Ale here- just about every brewery makes one, and honestly, you oughta be drinking the one your local makes- it's fresher that way. If I lived in Cleveland, I'd definitely be rockin' with this one."
"Pours a clear, pale amber color with a large head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Plenty of hop aroma with hints of citrus and pine. The caramel aroma of the malt starts to make an appearance as it warms. The flavor is too one dimensional to warrant a higher score. As it is, it features the hops but lacks suitable malt balance. A good body for a hoppy pale ale. Nice carbonation and texture. A good hoppy drinker. A little more malt would be nice."
"A good pale ale that is not sessionable due to the high hop bitterness. Sure to satisfy a hop craving, but in my opinion needs more of a malt backbone."
"D: I like this beer a lot but when you're judging it to style it seems to big. Its a very sweet beer that they pack a bunch of IBUs into in order to balance it out. It definitely has balance but the final impression is that its very bitter for a pale ale. But thats only according to style! I still like it"
"Drinkability is good. A pretty easy drinking pale ale , maybe even a good for a session beer. I've had more flavorful brews from the style but this is still a pretty solid example. Certainly worth a try."
"D- A decent beer that is drinkable, but just a bit forgettable. There is nothing wrong with this by any means, it will just get lost in the shuffle."
"Liked beer #2 of the 3 Great Lakes that I purchased. Burning River is a solid pale ale, nice blend of malty and hoppy, just like an APA should be."
"D= This beer is excellent. Wow I'm impressed with the balance of this APA. Most APAs I think border the IPA category a little too much but this one is nice and balanced with a light hop character that lets the malts do it's own thing. Really nice. I'll be buying more."
"Drinkability: Pretty solid example of the APA style. Worth having, but I prefer others, especially ones with a drier finish."
"All in all, I could easily see going through a six pack of this in a day, which says it's better than most pale ales."
"D: Even at 6%, this beer is one of the most drinkable of any style I have had. Could it be a new everyday sipper? Perhaps. Exceptional stuff!"
"D- Though not technically a session beer, this is a very easy drinking beer with good flavor that I would have no problem putting a few back in a sitting."
"I'm not overly impressed by this one. Flavor is there though, color and appearance are good. I think it stems to aroma and innability to taste much without the help of aroma. Still a good contender for the style, follows it well."
"Straightforward, no nuances or unique aspect throughout the bottle, a good price for a good almost if not great beer."
"pours a clear light amber color with a nice white head and ring with loads of lacing on side of glass..the smell has nice citrus and grass and a great hop aroma i smell malt and bread too..the taste is great big citrus taste with other fruits its crisp with pine and hops then its all smoothed out in the end with tasty malt..this is one solid pale ale it has great hops/citrus and malt with a nice medium mouth feel..it is highly drinkable..a solid/top APA"
"Notes- This has become my favorite beer. It is from Great Lakes Brewing Company which is out of Cleveland Ohio. I live in Toledo, Ohio so Great Lakes Beers are abundant. They have yet to dissapoint me. Any that can't get to them let me know and i can help you out."
"D: Not a bad pale ale, but plenty of better APAs out there."
"Another winner from Great Lakes. 'Nuff said."
"this is an excellent american pale ale!if you havent had anything from great lakes let me tell you you are missimg out,they put out great stuff!it pours a brownish,dark red,nice head to it.smells almost like an ipa.taste is some bitterness,hoppy,and drinks incredibly well!it is even better on tap! careful cause this one may make you want to drink them all night."
"It has a beautiful floral, bitter taste. Very hoppy. Crisp. There's a vegetable taste to it. This is about as perfect a Pale Ale as I've had. Love it."
"I'm usually an avid IPA guy, but this one impressed me. This brew is far better than Great Lakes IPA. Pours nice, hoppy nose great head and all that good stuff. A fantastic hoppy brew without the slamming bitterness, Flowery, aromatic without being sweet, not one bit of sweet. This is one really great brew, right there with the best PA's on the market, and nicely drinkable."
"D - Very good beer. Will have to pick up a few more when I'm in the area."
"The brewery itself is very impressive. Very environmentally conscience, gorgeous building on a brick street in downtown Cleveland. Food much better than average in a 200 year old building that Elliot Ness got shot in. (That's what you get for trying to stop me from my daily intake)."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this. I usually like hoppier pale ales, but this was incredibly balanced and full flavored. Definitely wouldn't mind having a couple of these. Another excellent brew from Great Lakes."
"D- still drinking good, even if past the date"
"Pours a medium amber color with one finger of head that fades slowly with nice lacing. Smells nicely of citrus and flowery hops and a faint background metallic note. Nice body up front with lots of sharp bitterness. The body thins out towards the end and the bitterness becomes more pronounced with a mild metallic taste. The finish is slightly harsh and lingering. Drinkability is good despite the slightly unbalanced hop profile. This beer has a west-coast style vibe going on to me, but I have to say that I like it."
"Taste-Citrus notes,bitter hops and a biscuity, malt backbone that provides a nice balance. Hoppy edge with a fruity, biscuit quality that makes for a tasty refreshing pale ale. Very nice and full of character."
"Overall, this is a decent beer that is easy to drink but does not stand out as some of the other IPAs."
"Very good drinkability. I've long been a fan of Burning River. One bad thing about being comfortably within the Great lakes distribution area is that I often take their beers for granted & pass them up in favor of something shinier, so to speak. In any case, this is very good beer. Recommended."
"Carbonation is a little low, which I like here. Dry finish makes each sip as good as the last- I wish I had more than one bottle left."
"Pours a mix of light amber / straw gold, with a minimal egg shell head; lots of good lacing, though - the bottom third of my glass is one nice, snowy sheet! Aroma is dominated by caramel malt sweetness; there are hints of pine and citrus with a little earthiness, too. The hops become more apparent in the taste - nice citrus / tropical fruit with a touch of woodsy bitterness; bready and sweet malts are there. Mouthfeel is light to medium-bodied and carbonation is fairly high, but not overly zingy. A very drinkable brew - I think this may become one of my go-to pale ales (too bad I have to drive about 3 hours to get some) - great stuff!"
"Nice session beer. Tasty and easy drinking."
"D - I've had this before and can't say the age has been bad to it but I will say I'd love to give a fresh bottle a review. Not one of my favorite pale ales. Not a favorite Great Lakes for that matter."
"F: Semi bitter, it gets a little more bitter on the finish. Also pretty dry. The lingering grassy and earthy hop flavors seem to really come out at the end when the other flavors are gone. More of that bitter English real ale character, but lighter on the ale and spicier on the hop. A nice light pale ale overall, drinkable, has a nice hop character. A solid APA. I could see drinking quite a few of these if I could get them around here. If I could complain about anything, it would be the slight yeasty aroma and flavor."
"All in all, this is a hoppy / grapefruit bitterness type brew. Not for me. If you like hops and dry flavor, then try this one. Otherwise, not worth your time."
"A great example of the style, another solid Great Lakes Brew."
"Drinkability is fantastic, not so hoppy you want to stop but enough flavor and aftertaste to make drinking an enticing and interesting brew."
"This is a very drinkable brew; may not be a hopped up brew for hop heads, but there is enough there to keep a hop head happy. This brew is very sessionable, and is more approachable for some non hop heads. A good party brew - or any time for that matter. Very good."
"The thing I like most about Burning River is the fact that it knows what it is. It excels at it, and doesn't try to be anything else. This is one helluva pale ale, and I might make this a go-to."
"From a bottle this pours with little head but a fragrant aroma. Light amber color. Hops, citrus and pine (maybe from the Cascadian hops) are the dominate flavors, in that order. It also doesn't seem to impart the dry mouth feel that many pale ales do. Overall, one of my favorite pale ales."
"Notes: Second brew I have from Great Lakes as they reach the DC area and sure enough their brews are good quality so far. This pale ale can be had with the best of them in the style, glad to include in the rotating selection of PAs. This is not my favorite style but it is one that is always iconic and important to have around to offer as a quality and quaffable entry point to craft brews, and a reliable option to have have in any case. Burning River sure is great on that front."
"D - 6% ABV for an APA is reasonable - I think it only takes one to appreciate this fine work though. So much going on here. One hell of a brew."
"D-the nose was awesome, the taste fell a little short of that but still extremely good pale ale. I really enjoy Great Lakes and this is definitely a solid offering for the style!"
"A beautiful clear copper color with lively carbonation, a decent head and great lacing. The aroma suggests lots of deep grainy malt and pleasing piney hops. Really edible smelling, very nice. The flavor is pretty much in sync with the aroma. A nice mid-bodied brew with fair woodsy pine hop over biscuit and bready malt. Sweet grass and mellow pine. Almost a seaweed quality but very nice. Highly drinkable. Very nice for some hops and tasty refreshment."
"Overall- i was expecting alil more on the hop end from this beer but not to bad. a great pale ale to get people into the pale category."
"O: I really enjoy this beer as an alternative to the sometimes boring IPA's that seem to creep their way into my sessions far too often. At 6% ABV, a pretty easy drinker and a great session beer. A very good example of the style."
"Overall another quality beer from Great Lakes. This pale ale is real hoppy but crisp and drinkable as well."
"Had this beer at some beer bar in downtown Columbus, Ohio. This beer is amber coloured and it is hoppy as hell, with some biscuity malts balancing it out. In fact, I think it may borderline on IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. I couldn't drink a whole sixpack, but I'd like this when I'm in the mood for an IPA/APA hybrid."
"D- Clean, crisp, sharp, easy on the palate. This is one of my favorite beers by one of my favorite breweries. One of my go to beers for sure."
"Another great beer from Great Lakes, just wish they had East Coast distribution."
"D - Tasty malt background pairs well with the fruity/herbal hops. Easy drinking with enough complexity to leave me wanting a refill."
"enjoyed with a spicy texas chili the paring was great. the hops cut through the spice in the chili like a hot knife through butter."
"Thanks Mark!"
"Got this in a trade from Intimidtor. Thanks! Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Smells hoppy as I pour it, this is a good sign. Looks great in the glass, coppery, orange in color. This is probably the clearest pale ale I have ever seen. Small, abundant bubbles make an inch of white head that dissipates leaving no noticeable lacing. Tastes of bittering hops, dry and spicy. Faint citrus, but mostly clean, dry bitterness. Feel is good, if a bit thin. Excellent carbonation gives way to a dry finish. This is a very drinkable Pale Ale. I find it very refreshing, and the 6% ABV means I could enjoy a bunch of them without ending up face down on the floor. If this was available in my area I would have it on a regular basis."
"Would drink again."
"Mild hop flavor and a slight bitterness at the back. High malt character and a slight aftertaste, nothing too bad. This is an OK APA, not great just OK."
"D - Nice and balanced APA here. Nothing mindblowing, just a good go-to option. Even at 6%, this isn't completely out of the question as a session brew."
"Drinkability: Supremely easy to drink, but just missed the perfect rating because of the burnt flavour, while interesting, doesnt quite lend itself to great drinkability"
"D - Quite quaffable... Solid and enjoyable... I would gladly drink again... Not my favorite Great Lakes offering, but still a very good one..."
"Pours light orange with a white head. The aroma is very malty, possibly Vienna malt. You also get some piney hops. The flavor is piney hops with a strong caramel malt backbone. Not too complex but a good APA. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation."
"Overall a pretty straightforward, but really good, assertively bitter pale ale."
"This is simply an excellent beer. Another score from Great Lakes easily drinkable and easily sessionable."
"Solid finger's worth of creamy white foam, a few islands of very large bubbles, average stickiness to the lacing, moderate retention. Clear amber brown with a swift lightening into orange hues, close to yellow at the outer rims, squeaky clean and transparent. Open and gregarious nose of mandarin orange, toffee, brownies and a counter-balance of rye, grains and witch hazel, suggestion of yellow apple, apricot, peach fruit, not crafted for complexity, rather for consistent harmony. Medium-bodied, solid and barrel-chested, moves with deliberation through the mouth. Fairly active carbonation, however, doesn't break up much of the density. Much hoppier here with grassy notes, grapefruit along with the orange zest, grainy even in texture. The cocoa, mocha powder back into the chorus, more regular ""white bread"" here than rye. The apricot, peach, apple fruit more pronounced. Touch more bitter at the end, but surely intended. Leaves you thirsty for more."
"D: This beer has balanced written all over it. I have seen in on tons of best of lists especially by cooks and foodies and now I know why. This beer can pair with anything. Hopefully NY will see more Great Lakes."
"Many beer drinkers do not enjoy the highly hopped IPAs and DIPA. This beer strikes a good balance between styles. This is something all should strive for."
"D- This is a drinkable APA for sure. My only problem is I don't think it is as good as everyone makes it out to be. There are many other APA's that I would rather drink. I would recommend this though to someone who wants to try to step into the world of hops."
"Close to perfect drinkability. More please :)"
"D: Well balanced, very tasty and goes down easily. I really wish this brewery distributed this way as I could drink this one all night!"
"D - This was a solid pale ale...I could not wrap my head around the apple taste...but it really added a little extra to the beer...this one is pretty sessionable"
"Thoughts: Another solid beer from the men and women at Great Lakes. They are a solid brewery with great pricing."
"This is a very nicely put together pale ale."
"I love to drink this beer simply for the taste of it. It has a great appearance, smell, mouthfeel, and is very is to drink but it all comes down to the taste. I haven't tried a beer from here that wasn't of good quality. I have had a beer or two that wasn't suited to my taste but that was a style differenc not a production flaw."
"Impression: Good brew, will get this again."
"A good beer, something that is good to sit down, drink, relax and enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. I like my pales a bit hoppier but this is still damn nice and almost perfectly balanced."
"Aroma shows notes of some nice citrus from the Cascade hops and a sweet fruitiness from the malts. Taste is hoppy with some sweet fruity flavors that are very good. Nice mouthfeel and drinkability."
"D: Haven't had all that many Pale Ales of late, but this one ranked among the best for enjoyability. A big flavor profile and wonderful balance, intriguing aroma and beauty to the eye. None garnered a score better than a '4' from me, but all were close enough to more, such that the whole does equal more than the individual parts. A very nice, highly-recommendable ale."
"Overall very easy drinking. A sessionable beer for sure."
"Not too thin of a mouthfeel like some pale ales suffer from. This is substantial and still has great drinkability. I would definitely love to session this if it were my local. I haven't had a Great Lakes that I don't like yet!"
"Simple but fundamentally good. Many other bottles of this that I've consumed did not have the touch of funk that I experienced here. Sessionable."
"Overall impression: Top notch, lively and enjoyable APA. Would love to have access to this all the time."
"D- Exactly what I expect from an APA. Easy to drink, lots of flavor, good session beer. If you can find this (pretty easy to do) try it out."
"Drinkability is good. I could drink a few of these. Overall i would say this is an average to slightly above average pale ale. nothing thats too special but not bad."
"Overall another quality beer from Great Lakes. This pale ale is real hoppy but crisp and drinkable. This is a beer you can sit and drink and really enjoy in an evening. Great stuff."
"D: Not as bitter as some pale ales, absences of such highlights the caramel aftertaste which gives the beer that unfermented sugary feel that is very delicious."
"Light gold colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is pine.Taste is grapefruit,pine and hops.This is just another one of those beers that have Pinesol written all over it.I was always under the impression that pine was a scent not a flavor.This is not good to drink but I'm sure it does a hell of a job cleaning floors."
"Great example of the APA style."
"D - This is a very good easy to drink pale it reminds me of Pine Belt Pale Ale from Southern Star worth trying sometime if you can get it"
"D: a nice APA. I enjoyed this offering from Great Lakes. I found it to be a solid representation of the style and it certainly holds its own against some of the best in the category."
"Drinkability: Very good. You can drink this all night."
"Great Lakes have yet to let me down, and this streak continues. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that they may well be my favourite brewery at this moment in time. To be so consistently excellent over such a diverse array of styles is simply staggering. Burning River Pale Ale is probably one of the best, if not the best, beers I've had in this category. Its drinkability is through the roof, and this is the sort of brew that I'd love to have a permanent supply of should I ever have the fortune to be stranded on a desert island and not be stuck in cold and snowy Toronto."
"[Thanks to kels for this freebie!]"
"Drinkability: another great session ale from Great Lakes. This beer is refreshing and well balanced."
"If anyone is looking for a tasty, easily quaffed and highly rewarding pale ale then I might just point them in the direction of Cleveland, Ohio. There are pale ales out there just as good (even better) but there aren't many breweries who turn up as high a number of quality beers as Great Lakes. They either make good beer or they make great beer."
"D - Superbly sessionable pale ale that I come back to time after time."
"D - Quite good. Interesting enough to warrant extended sipping, and light enough to make that possible."
"Overall - I'm very glad I decided to grab this beer from the local Kroger here in the Cincinnati area. I've heard some good things about the Great Lakes Brewing company, and this certainly didn't disappoint. This is a great example of an APA, and should be on everyone's list if you havn't tried it."
"Drinkability is high.It's easy to sit back and enjoy a few of these.This is what pale ale should taste like!"
"A tasty hophead brew, smells fantastic"
"Notes: Great Lakes continues to impress me with each beer I drink. While not as good as Eliot Ness, in my opinion, it is a tasty hoppy brew."
"Definitely a good example. Not the best but still quite drinkable. Worth a shot."
"D - Interesting beer...smooth and easy drinking. Nice APA. Not overly hoppy, but quite flavorful and balanced. Not the best APA I've ever had, but a really good one. Glad to have the chance to try this, and would happily have another."
"A carbonated mouthfeel and very drinkable, possibly one of the best Pale Ale's I've had, I'll have to try this again for sure."
"This is the American Pale Ale that is my measuring stick for all other beers of this style. The pour is a copper amber with an off white head that always sticks to the glass. Big floral hops with some pine and hints of vanilla and grapefruit for me. Hops are boss when it comes to taste. Not overpowering like a DIPA or even an IPA, but this is the focal point. You get some caramel breadiness mixed in, but this has a great dry finish. I could go on and on about this beer, but in my opinion, it's the best I've had of the style."
"It's thick and creamy in the mouth. Lightly bitter aftertate. Good drinkability."
"Pours gold with a moderate, downy head and no veil to speak of. The smell is classic cascade floral and pine, with just a hint of light vanilla underneath. The mouthfeel is crisp and light with lively carbonation. The taste is very hop forward for the style, venturing toward, if not crossing, the border between APA and IPA. The floral and pine flavors take the lead and fade while the strong bitter flavors come to the fore. The malt backbone suggested by the vanilla smell makes only a cameo appearance. A very nice APA, but, given the lack of balance, only hop lovers need apply."
"Drinkablity is high. With only 6% abv, lightly hoppy, and a nice mouthfeel you can easily enjoy one or five of these in a night."
"3.5 D: This is the first GL brew that didn't floor me. It's a quality beer and would never be pissed about drinking it, but there are so many better APAs out there that I'll give this one a pass most of the time."
"One of my favorite by GL!"
"Drinkable? Very.. Sessionable, definately. Sure does go down easy hard to have just one."
"Pours a clear deep copper/amber color with a bubbly beige head that impales itself to the glass all the way down. Smells of citrus, light sweet fruit, slight mineral. Taste is smooth citrus with a fruity burnt sugar malt sweetness. Great balance! Twinge of hops, bit of malt leaves a hop bite at the end of every sip. Crisp carbonation, sticky, resinous mouthfeel, medium body with a semi dry finish. Great session ale here."
"Light golden color with a nice finger of head that recedes quickly. Smell is weak, mainly caramel malt and straw. Taste is slightly better, although that just brings it up to average. Overall, I don't think this beer really has anything going for it. Not much in the way of hops, and the malt profile is nothing special to make up for it."
"D - Overall not a bad pale ale at all. Very refreshing. Nice full flavor thats not overpowering and sessionable ABV."
"D: I don't know...this beer threw me off. I had certain expectations, I guess. I did enjoy it. I actually cracked open another one as soon as I finished the first. But it's not what I'd reach for when I want a hoppy pale ale."
"A 12 ounce bottle picked up at Abe's in Bethlehem for under $2. Freshest by 9/21/09. Poured into my Imperial nonic pint glass. The pale ale appears a crystal clear golden yellow color with about two fingers of off white head. Nose and flavors consist of citrus, mainly grapefruit with hints of orange peel, a good amount of caramelized malts, medium toasted bready grains, slightly per-fumy and floral hops. Wonderful balance overall. The ale is just about medium bodied and amply carbonated with a bitter-sweet, crisp finish. A great everyday pale ale. Glad that they finally made it to eastern PA."
"D: Easy to session. A nice pale ale indeed. Could of had a tad bit more in the way of body."
"D: A solid brew to be sure, but I was a bit disappointed considering my usual high expectations for GL. Unfortunately, this beer committed the great beer sin in my eyes, lack of balance (way more hops than the malt can support). This is a pretty classic style Pale Ale, I can see how it would definitely be a staple brew in it's home area. Good offering from GL, but not one to go too far out of your way to obtain."
"Overall - This beer is very well balanced and is quite sessionable. A relatively mild beer that maintains both complexity and flavor."
"Pours amber with a respectable head that fades quickly. The aroma is citrusy, but not strong. The taste too, is mild citrus, sweet with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouth feel is only average with a little carbonation. Very drinkable because it is fairly mild. Overall there are too many ""slight, mild, light, average"" used to describe Burning River. It is what it is: an average, bland, APA light. OK, but nothing to write home about."
"Pours a light peach color with an initial three fingers of head that fades slowly. Scent is mostly hops, earthy, floral, and citrusy. Wow, what a delicious pale ale. Where a lot of other bottled pale ales end up toward the amber style, this is leaning heavily in the IPA direction. Plenty of satisfying bitterness from the cascade hops with balancing malts providing a touch of caramel sweetness. Medium body and carbonation is right on--yet another brew from Great Lakes that would surely be a staple if it were more available to me. Get this one if you can."
"Notes: Nice, smooth, and mellow. One of those examples of keeping it simple!"
"This is my first attempt at reviewing a beer, I drafted this review before reading any other reviews or the lable. Let me know your opinion or sugguestions!"
"D: I am not a hop head. But man this is tasty. Just the right amount of hops when you are craving something a little bitter. Nice beer."
"M&D- The feel is light to medium with a good amount of carb livining things up a bit. Very impressive. I get hops than some sweetness than some bitterness, nothing over the hill. Hmmm, only 6%, sign me up."
"this is a beer i would come back to. classic apa in appearance decent head with some lacing. smell is a perfect harmony between malt and hops. taste is also a good balance. not overly complex. i dont typically prefer strong malt but the malt i was picking up in this brew was very attractive to me, posibly a malt strain i have never tried? mouthfeel is an average apa. med body and med carbonation. goes down more than easy and youll be looking for a second one. at 6% its a perfect blend of flavor/ drinkability/ price (IMO). so if you can get a hold of this brew i highly recomend it."
"This is a drinkable APA that will surprise you with its malt character."
"Have no idea how this beer won a Gold Medal or so many rave reviews - maybe I hit a ""bad batch"""
"D: Ok, if you like IPAs, but still not great. If not, then not even OK"
"D: Very drinkable, this is what a pale ale should taste like, I absolutely loved it."
"This is less citrus- and pine- centric than most pale ales I enjoy, but it's well balanced, and easy to drink. Great Lakes has really been impressing me with their well-balanced beers in some of the less typically flavorful styles."
"D- At 6% it's no session beer, but it is damn drinkable."
"As for drinkability, I finished this off fairly quickly with dinner and definitely wouldn't mind another one, but, it's not what I was expecting in a pale ale. I guess I was looking for something a little bit more on the crisp and refreshing side, not something with so much flavor and smell. Mind you, I'm not complaining, but I'm surprised that this is called a pale ale due to the color and robust flavors."
"D: Could drink 10 of these in a row... Certainly a good APA, just shy of upper echelon brews."
"still ok, but seems to be way past its prime, even though it was technically consumed before the ""best by"" date."
"D- Not my style but not sorry I had it."
"Drinability: Pretty high - a nice refreshing beer that was drank outside with some typical bar food fare and it really cut through all of the flavors."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability- Though hoppy for a Pale Ale, this is another greatly versatile beer by Great Lakes, as it goes well with a wide variety of foods, and is refreshing anytime."
"This one was drinkable and somewhat enjoyable, but didn't knock my socks off. I still hold to the opinion that this brewery is somewhat overrated. Each of their beers that I have tried are decent, but there's always a little something lacking that I can't quite put my finger on that keeps them from being really good."
"drinkability is great. just what an APA should be: mildly hoppy with a solid caramel malt presence. another solid brew at the Great Lakes Brewpub. cheers!"
"D - very good but wasn't mind blowing for me."
"A slightly cloudy golden orange with a one finger white head,lively carbonation. Aroma is of nice floral,pine and citrus hops. Flavor is crisp,fresh piny hops,citrus,grapefruit and a hint of orange zest,just enough pale malt to add some balance,not overly bitter just nice and crisp,Medium bodied with a nice, pleasing mouthfeel , fresh hoppy finish is slightly dry, very drinkable. One of the better APA I have had."
"D: Good, a tasty, floral, APA."
"Drinkability is awesome. This is a tastey APA, that is refreshing and borderline sessionable. Excellent flavor and aroma it makes me want more after each quaff."
"Drinkability: I found this beer to be exceptional. So far this might be my favorite APA. It also is so easy to drink that splitting a sixer with a friend while watching some golf sounds like the perfect thing to do."
"D- Very drinkable pale with more balance and character than most pales."
"Drinkibility is good. This is one that'll please hopheads, and one that I could drink all day."
"D: could drink this all day. for 8.99$ you get your money's worth."
"This is an overall great brew and is easily a bigger, bolder one than some IPAs."
"Overall it was a good beer, but I was a little disappointed, because the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is one of my favorites, and this beer did not quite live up to the Porter."
"D - very much the quintessential APA, very understated which is a nice change from some of the over done examples out there, could certainly enjoy a few of these"
"D. Very easy drinking - putting two or three of these babies away would not be a problem. This is a well made beer that does its job without jumping up and down saying ""look at me - look at me""."
"Pretty drinkable. Light body with moderate carbonation."
"D - This is a very nice APA. I'd like to try more."
"pour is off amber. a bit golden brown. surprisingly small head. white. smell is almond, protein, nutmeg, a mild apple caramel and very mild lemon. palate is earthy. protein yeast, nutty, nutmeg, and orange blossom bitter note. earthy style with a perfume kicking edge."
"Picked this up at Galeville Grocery in Syracuse, NY on a trip back to my hometown for a bachelor party. It's great to see such a cool brewery getting more distribution and I would love to see alot more of their work in Philadelphia."
"Very easy to drink, super APA or AIPA, well done Great lakes!"
"D- Really surprised to like this APA so much. Has all the hop kick that I could ask for without feeling to overpowering. Easily drinkable, great brew."
"D: For a pale ale, I would say this is highly partakable. Enjoy this as an introduction to the style and beyond."
"D: This is my go to beer. As many people sit with a 6 of some BMC, I will sit with a 6 of Burning River. Easy drinking and a pleasant taste. Also a good buy! Just because this beer isn't hyped, don't turn down a chance to try this. Solid brew right here guys!"
"A little over the top in astringent hops, but a very nice American APA."
"My bottle says to enjoy the beer before 05/21/09. That's about seven weeks from now so I'm good. It's got a nice deep orange/gold color. Good foamy head retention. Fruity hop aroma. Similar to raspberries, pine, and a touch of citrus as well as malt. Very nice. Flavor is perfectly bittered to the level that a pale ale ought to be with sweet fruity/malty overtones. Reflects the aroma tremendously and in a great way. Nice medium body with perfect carbonation and easy to drink. Great beer for the $8.99 six pack price."
"D- Very drinkable."
"Why did I take so long to come back to this beer, one of my original favorites from the state of Ohio? I'm going to make this my summer beer this year, along with Alpha King."
"D - Very drinkable. Well-balanced and shows off the hops nicely, but with enough malt behind it to give it some meat on its bones. Definitely straddling the IPA/pale ale line, but it's got a bit more backbone and less bitterness than I find in most IPAs."
"D- I might like this even more than SN though it's a close race."
"Thanks to drgonzo3705 for this extra! Pours a crystal clear amber orange color with a nice, two finger off-white head that fell slowly and kept good retention. The aroma is nice and floral, slightly grassy with some hints of citrus and pine and sweet, caramel malt. There's a very nice bitterness to the flavor, it's slightly sweet at first, some toasty, biscuit-like malts make up the backbone, becomes slightly medicinal and dry on the finish. Nice use of bitter hops on this one, but missing some hop citrus flavor that I love out of APAs. Medium bodied, nice crisp carbonation. This is very drinkable, reminds me a lot of SNPA. Another delicious brew from Great Lakes. They haven't let me down yet!"
"Highly drinkable and quite enjoyable. They aren't reinventing the wheel here, but who asked them to? GLBC strikes again."
"This APA is a bit different from others that I have tried. It has a bit added complexity in the flavor that I was expecting, but was not bad by any means."
"Drinkability - I'm not sure how many I would be able to drink of these in a sitting."
"D: Pretty good easy drinking session beer."
" All and all this is a pretty solid Pale Ale."
"Hops hit the back of the mouth in a pleasant way. Very easy to drink, very highly recommended."
"Notes: another great job by GLBC. it seems everything they do is upper-middle class"
"This beer pours a dark cloudy amber with a 1 fingered white head and some lacing. The smell is of sweet malts and nuts. The flavor is nice, some nutty tones to it, a nice malt base and a decent hop aftertaste, some citrus and some pine in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is ok with a low carbonation level and a slight dry aftertaste. A nicely drinkable brew."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" beige head above the slightly cloudy orangey amber brew. Head lasts and lasts, with goodly amounts of chunky lacing. Aroma is balanced, leaning slightly towards piney hops. Taste is slight vegetal upfront, citrus hops in the middle, and then combination through the close. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is about the same. Things just don't come together quite as well as I would hope."
"Poured from the bottle into a glass raising about 1 1/2"" creamy white head over a coppery gold (amber?) body, light carbonation. The scent is lemony with some light caramel malt and light bread notes. Very understated but pleasant as is the taste, an initial caramel bread then a light burst of lemony and grassy hops. The feel is full and the aftertaste lingers with the hops at the fore. There's also a little bit of tannin-like feel to the finish. Good stuff...and for what it's worth I got this in Great Lakes Sampler and this is the least favorite of the beers it contains and it's nice to find a sampler without the ubiquitous IPA and Belgian-styled-inspired-copied ale in the mix."
"Future outlook: Great Lakes seems to make consistently solid products, and are readily available for me, so I anticipate getting this again."
"D: A well brewed APA all around. Recommended."
"A little ashy feel; more fizzy than expected. A decent but underwhelming bitter pale."
"M/D - Light bodied with an oily texture to it. Nice drinking and a nice round of hops with a zesty finish. Definitely could be a drinker"
"poured from a bottled obtained in a trade. pours bright copper. i catch an orange citrus scent. def some dry hopping here. piny hop bitterness up front that is quickly muted with malts. malty finish. medium carbonation. this is very sessionable and great beer for anyone that wants something low key and easy going."
"Very drinkable. Only got one bottle.. That's too bad. I'm impressed with Great Lakes Brewing... Well done."
"Mouthfeel light bodied and slightly oily with some carbonation."
"I love this beer. Great hoppy taste and a decent foamy head as well. Just a wonderful flavor and aroma combo. Had this beer with a meat and cheese sandwich and it was pretty much heaven. My uncle turned me on to this one as an employee of Great Lakes for quite some time. You can't go wrong with this one. Definitely worth a try for someone who hasn't had this one before."
"D: A very enjoyable beer. One of the better APA's I have had. I would drink another if I had one but sadly I don't. I have yet to have a bad beer from Great Lakes - gotta love that!"
"Poured into a dogfish head snifter. Small half a fingers worth of off white head with small amount of carbonation and body looked a golden amber. At first I got whiffs of grassy hops aromas and then noticed a little citrus zest smell maybe of grapefruit or oranges. Got a little of the grapefruit zest in the first sip as well as the bitterness of the hops. It left my mouth coated after the first sip and had a lingering aftertaste. Seemed like the ending was missing a little something and I can quite describe the after taste. I picked this one up on my way thru Ohio and I would do it again as it's something worth drinking."
"This beer is not at all what I expected. The nice and strong hop character really took me by surprise after the sweetness of the smell. Very complex of a pale ale and probably one of the best that I have had."
"How can you resist an ale commemorating the Cuyahoga River fire? Well, Great Lakes Brewery can't & grants a better-than average pale ale that I eagerly enjoyed. A medium-shade of honey pour with light tan lacey head and sweet honey aroma already proved its appearance well. A smooth hoppy lemon malt flavor, where nothing overwhelmed definitely sat nicely & left me wanting more."
" This would be a good session beer in warmer weather, even though the ABV is 6.00%. I could easily see this going well with some mildly spicy food since this won't burn your mouth or require an accompanying glass of water. The faint metallic hint in the aftertaste is enough to make me want more and realize that a solid pale ale is always a good thing, even during a cold snap like the one we're getting this week!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: The beer has a medium body that is well served by its active carbonation. This is a beer to sit back and just suck on down. This is a very nice pale ale."
"(D) A GREAT pale ale. Would be even more fantastic on a summer / warmer day instead of the middle of winter."
"date consumed: 27 Oct 2008"
"D- Easily drinkable. Drank 3 of them in an hour and a half at Ashley's. No sense of the alcohol... Delicious and easily sessionable."
"(rated Aug 17, 2008)"
"This one pours a light orange with a dense white head that fades somewhat slowly and leaves tons of lacing. The smell is of fresh hops that have piney and citrus notes with some sweet aromas. The taste starts hoppy, with hints of the pine flavors, moves toward the citrus and finishes with just a hint of bitterness. The bitter notes come on a bit stronger in the aftertaste, but still are very light compared to other hoppy beers. The mouthfeel is very smooth and somewhat light, great carbonation, nice flavor all through the beer. This one is an easy drinker, a very well crafted beer with great flavors. Definitely worth trying."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, a great pale ale, well balanced and great tasting. At 6% ABV this would not be my first choice for a session beer, but two or three in a night would be a great treat, deffinetly try it if you get the chance."
"Enjoying a GLBC Burning River is like visiting an old friend (cheesey, I know) in that I use to drink it so much. The fact that you can get it at any mini-mart in Columbus shows you how far craft beer has come. A fantastic APA and a must for any BA."
"This APA pours a slightly hazed amberish orange with a big fat pillow of creamy head that slowly recedes leaving tons of sticky lacing as evidence of its presence. This smells sweet with a hoppy profile of pine and some buiscuty malts. This could give my old stand by Sierra Nevada PA a run for its money. SN is very one dimensional in the hop profile and lack of malt,while Burning river is very balanced,with hops conquering the weaker malt in the end. This has a fruity/citrusy middle that adds that third dimension that really puts this one into a league of its own. Creamy and medium bodied with just the right texture and carbonation. High drinkability for such a hoppy brew."
"D - This is eminently drinkable due to its balanced flavor and nice hop profile. The malty spine and the additional fruity complexity keep this one interesting sip after sip (or gulp after gulp more like it). This has session written all over it. Seriously good beer here."
"D: This is definitely close to an IPA in style, and it's very well done and extremely well balanced despite the bold flavor. I remember drinking this early in my beer career and finding it horribly unbalanced. But now that I've expanded my palate a bit, this one really hits the spot."
"Another great brew received from Auslander. Pours a nice deep copper with minimal head, but with excellent lacing/webbing. This beer smells like grassy hops and pineapple. Nice smell. Smooth and crisp. Comes across more like an IPA than an APA, but I love it. Nice bitter hop prescence right up front, but balanced perfectly by the sweet malt that makes this ever-so drinkable. Some citrus also pulls through slightly. I was excited to try this and it did not disappoint."
"Easy to drink, left me wanting more."
"I wish this beer were more readily available here in Texas. I might have to make some trades to get more of this in the future."
"Great beer, one of the few I keep on hand with some regularity."
"Very easy drinking and tasty."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a light copper color with a thin white head. The smell is extremely floral with strong hints of lively hops. The taste is very flavorful showcasing a wonderful bouquet of spicy hops that also has a smooth balance. The taste is not overpowering, but very balanced. The bitterness is lacking, but made up for with spice. I enjoy this brew, but as far as a pale ale it is a little off. Solid brew for the price!"
"This is very drinkable. I could have a couple with dinner, but by itself it may fall a bit flat. A great surprise from a brewery close by the new in-laws."
"D - goes down easy and it's mighty tasty."
"Pours a middle of the road amber with good clarity. Not much in the head or froth department. OK bubbling though. The aroma has a strong hop with some orange spice and a little white pepper. The taste is about 70% hops and 40% malt. Mild toast flaked grain, but plenty of juicey orange peel hops. Starts sicey, and finishes lemon/lime juicy. Palate is a light juice to thick water, if that makes sense. This beer is great on tap. And very drinkable."
"this ranks right up there for me as one of the most drinkable APAs out there. easily sessionable. If i could get this all the time it would be a stable in my fridge in the summer."
"Drinkability: A simple and very easy drinking beer, this one went famously with some extra sharp cheddar. It's superbly balanced, of an eminently reasonable alcohol level, and I think it's a damn fine beer. My first experience with Great Lakes and a good one - recommended."
"This is one of those beers that proves simple can be just as amazing as complex. There's not much going on here, just some great flavors melding perfectly in one hell of a pale ale."
"Taste: Once again, it's mostly hops. Some malts in the background."
"d - a very easy to drink pale ale, flavorful yet very smooth"
"Pours deep gold with a nice slightly frothy layer of head with very nice looking carbonation rising to the top. This is what I would like to see poured for me draft at any restaurant.. it's very appealing. Aroma has an interesting mixture of sweet grains and citrus sort of like wine grapes.They've created an interesting beer here. The flavors seem to transcend what you'd normally expect in beer.. I mean.. maybe it's because I'm a little sick but I think I pick up on some peanut butter in the taste. Interesting how that works. The bittering presence is right for the style but decreases the drinkability a little bit for me.. it doesnt seem to fit with the rest of the nice medium/heavy mouthfeel and otherwise it's like the beer is yelling out at you to drink it. Unfortunately it's that bittering presence that sort of ruins it for me.. I think I'm going into the beer thinking that it's going to be more like an Oktoberfest or something, but as far as APAs go it's right up there."
"D- a classic. light enough to be sessionable and delicious enough as well. everyone should check this one out."
"D: A beer I could drink everyday, but I'm partial to pale ales. Really nice offering from Great Lakes."
"Drinkability: A sold pale ale, with just the right bite from the hops. Another solid beer from GLBC."
"Drinkability: Great session beer. Good taste and mouthfeel with a finish that doesn't kill your palate."
"D- 6% isn't the most drinkable, but this is a nice malty, but still hoppy APA. Definitely would have again given the chance."
"I know this beer must be way better when fresh, but it is still a damn good beer."
"This one was alright but it's just not nearly as good as SNPA or Alpha King, my two benchmarks for pale ales."
"Pours a clear copper color with an average white head that dissipates into a light cap. The aroma is of juicy citrus hops and a light honey malt, very nice. The hops stand forefront in the taste, a nice mellow citrus hop. There is a light malt presence to keep the hops honest. Really this is what an APA should taste like. Nice noticable American hops that don't smash you over the head. Nice moderate feel with semi-soft carbonation giving the brew a creamy texture. A near perfect APA, not overly hoppy and has a great balance"
"Prosit, MK"
"D: Overall, a very good brew, but not outstanding. Easily drinkable."
"D: I find myself wanting to love this beer, but it just is missing something. I can't decide if it just isn't bitter enough or if i would rather it be a little less bitter. still, a very good beer and considering the strong hops i almost expect more ABV."
"A very good american pale ale."
"T: Lighter body with very strong carbonation and hop bitterness results in a creamy, full mouthfeel. Finish is dry and hoppy. Body is well balanced between strong malty, biscuit like flavor, but most surprising for this APA is this very strong citrus hop bite. This is my favorite glbc beer and also one the biggest, most flavorful apa's I've had."
"One of the bigger Pale Ales I've ever had, but also one of the tastiest. Borders on an IPA, if you ask me, and if they changed the label I probably wouldn't flinch. I wish I had access to this one more often."
"Wonderful beer yet again from Great Lakes."
"Drinkability is outstanding. I have to remind myself to pace myself. Excellent as an one-of or as a session beer. This is a permanent part of my rotation and I try to have it at least every other week at a minimum."
"Pours a golden/squash color with a thin head. Lacing is surprisingly persistent. The smell is well balanced between the sweet malty notes and the punch of hops. The taste is silky smooth, especially for a pale ale. The slightly bitter, hop heavy, finish remains in your mouth for quite a while. The finish is a great counter to the exceptionally well balanced taste of the beer as you first drink it. The hops are never overpowering and, instead, work well with the malt and yeast notes to make an exceptionally drinkable beer. Very smooth, I could easily drink a lot of these in the course of a night. Great beer."
"This beer has a beautiful color and just enough carbonation to keep the bubbles rising. The color is a brilliant orangish amber in the late afternoon sunshine. For a pale ale, the aroma is subtle, but betrays the brew's hoppy character, which really bursts on the palate as a floral blossoming of flavor. A lovely smooth silky texture makes it slide languidly down the back of the tongue, leaving a wonderful bitter accent at the finish. The bitter aftertaste leaves a clean lasting freshness in your mouth. A truly lovely beer."
"I can't say enough about this wonderful brew from Great Lakes, they continue to make wonderful craft beers and this is their flagship. Enjoy!"
"One of the better American Pale Ales that I have had. Being in North East Ohio, the beers from Great Lakes Brewing are always readily available and for that I am extremely thankful. Burning River is amber and copper in color, pours with ample head and leaves a nice trail of lacing as I empty my pint glass. The aroma is bursting with hop flavors comparable with most IPA's. Pine and citrus notes are further detected. The flavor is everything a pale ale should be, well hopped with abundant malts. This beer is always an enjoyable experience. Well crafted to say the least."
"Very drinkable; it disappeared pretty quickly from my pint glass."
""
"D: Not a bad beer in any respect, has a decent taste and mouthfeel but looks rather average and the mild off flavor just rubs me the wrong way . I would try this fresh and rerate but as its stands still a pretty decent beer. Could probably drink this all night if I felt like it."
"M&D- swirls around the mouth to create a slight wooden flavor. A beer you could stick to all night. also a great beer to convert the bud crowd, as it is a very easy drink but still has some flavor."
"HV"
"On tap at Jimmys. Golden colored beer with a creamy head. Aroma is bready malts with grapefruit and pine in the background. Subtle bitterness with more of the bready malts. This beer is easy to drink. I actually get more pine and citrus towards the end than I did in the beginning."
"Pours a dark amber in color with a nice, really big rocky head that stays around for awhile. Smell is nice. Some nice, citrusy, juicy hops. Taste is even better. Plenty of citrusy hops in the flavor. Crisp and bittering , but not over the top. Decent amount of carbonation as well. Very smooth IPA. Another fine beer from GL."
"Flavor is a straight blend of sweet malt (possibly specialty?) and robust hops that is very pleasant, and a great transition into a smooth, even midpalate that opens up into a citrusy, crisp, cleansing finish. The carbonation level is on the higher side of moderate, and affords the perfect complement to the light-to-medium body. This is an excellent summer brew, and I prefer it on the colder side."
"D - The odd cider flavor makes this one hard for me to drink a lot of. I like it, but probably wouldn't order another one."
"A very drinkable session beer. I will have this again. Only wish it were on tap around here."
"A solid APA; good hop flavor on the back of the pallet, which is not too overpowering, though strong enough to fool you into thinking it might be an IPA. Has a multitude of spices for smell and taste, as well as a hint of caramel. It has a decent mouth feel, and is certainly not light or watery. It reminds me a bit of Stone's Ruination, though certainly milder. This beer is fantastic on its own but do not drink with pasta!"
"D - This is one of the best APA's I've had and is one of my favorite brews. Enough hop presence to make it nice and crisp without assaulting the taste buds. I could easily drink a few of these in an evening. Definitely worth every penny of the $8.50 six. Highly recommended. Hope to find in half cases :)"
"D- I wasn't thrilled with this one, maybe a fresher bottle would change my mind"
"Pours a clear golden amber with a small dense head that dissipates to almost nothing leaving almost no lacing. Smell is mostly the moderate citrus hops with a significant caramel malt background in the smell. The taste starts with a slight hop bit before giving way to the caramel malts. There was also a definite spice presence in there as well and the finish had the slightest pine hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was light to medium with decent carbonation and the finish was actually on the crisp side of things with less hop bitterness than I'm used to. The drinkability is very high on this one as the hop profile is pretty tame and the mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Though not the most daring or complex APA I've had, it'd be pretty darn nice on a summer afternoon."
"Poured a nice copper/amber color with generous white head that stayed a while. Aroma was of citrusy hops. Flavor was a blend of floral, citrusy, piney hops. Pleasant bitterness to it. Mouthfeel is smooth. Decent lacing on glass. I enjoyed. I would definitely have again."
"Notes: Hop flavor is alive and strong in this Pale Ale."
"I plan to keep lots of Ohio friends who can send me GL beer until I see this in Texas."
"D= Excellently drinkable! Will make a great warm weather beer or one to enjoy with fried foods."
"D : It's easy to drink and worth picking up"
"Dark amber color with thick head . Poured in to a pint glass. Head over 1"" thick. Leaves good rings on glass. very average, one dimensional flavor. burnt malty nose, weak on the hops. My first sampling of Great Lakes. Very average beer. Harsh bitter aftertaste."
"This beer pours a slightly hazed orange color with a decent cap of bright white head on it. The scent is really nice for an APA. Loads of fresh citrus, floral notes, and sweet malt in the nose. It is assertive, but it also doesn't cross the lines into other bigger beers like an IPA, and I think it is really nice and refreshing. The flavor profile is a good balance of bitter hops and sweet malt. I get more citrus than pine in the flavor profile that is balanced quite well with the almost bready malt. The mouthfeel is very smooth with maybe slightly above medium carbonation. The drinkability is really nice, and as I said before I would give this beer a permanent home in my fridge if it were available locally."
"A little thicker in the mouth than most pal'e, leaves the mouth with a slight dryness."
"Overall Impression: Good APA, skirts the line with an English Pale. In the ocean of Pale Ales, it's bound to get lost."
"Mouthfeel is full and the aftertaste is amazing. I really wish this stuff was available out here on the west coast."
"D = Good drinkability, a very refreshing APA."
"Notes: Big thanks to fiver29 for the awesome Great Lakes extras."
"D- A very solid brew and easy to drink."
"A solid Pale should be a staple in any breweries lineup, but many fall short, or omit it entirely. Kudos to Great Lakes for a wonderful brew!"
"D- in the right mood, I'll gladly sit down and have a few more of these."
"M/D - Clean medium body. Very easy drinking and would make for an excellent session beer."
"D: A nicely made pale ale. Very easy to drink and quite enjoyable."
"D: This is one of my favorite APAs. Highly drinkable, I always want another one. Another great beer from Great Lakes (which has to be one of the most consistent breweries there is)."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice, sessionably brew. Not a big, extreme beer, but flavourful very well balanced."
"Pours a great light copper/amber color with good head and nice lacing. It has an excellent hoppy aroma, very floral with citrus hints. Great taste, too, an excellent beer with great hoppy/bitter tastes, without going overboard; it has a nice citrus/bitter taset with a great bitter aftertaste. A nice smooth beer that is well worth drinking."
"Drinkability is good. I could easily drink several of these."
"At 6% ABV, it may prove too heavy for a true session beer."
"Nice, there's a touch of cocoa in the malt that really sets this pale ale apart nicely. Otherwise, the hops provide a great, piney hops bite. Overall this is a nice change of pace from SNPA wannabe's with the slightly dark grains and more rounded yet more harsh hops in use. It may not be crisp, but it's mighty tasty."
"At the end of the bottle, overall my feeling was ""no thanks, not interested""."
"My second brew from Great Lakes and yet another tasty and interesting brew. My hat's off to them, for sure, for making an APA that kept my interest from first pour to last swallow. I really do like well made APAs. :^)"
"I was let down with this one. Not that it was bad by any means, but I was expecting much more. All the same, I'm looking forward to more from Great Lakes."
"D: Very drinkable, nicely hopped. Quite sessionable."
"Purchased as 6 pack in local beer/wine distributor for 8.99 retail. Best by date 5/7/8. Have had on tap before out east but forgot about until I saw these bottles. Appearance is a golden amber with medium bubble lacy head that adheres well to glass. Smell is citrus, burnt-sugar hops. Taste is citrus-bitter hops but surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. Deserves the overall A-rating for Pale Ales. Not the best but a darn good one."
"Clear light orange colored pour. looks kind of thin, but holds a huge white head. Smell opf the hops are nice, but a bit mild for an IPA, I thought, and there was a slight mustiness about it too. Taste was mildly hopped initially too, but picked up a bit after a few sips. Light sweetness, and light bodied as well. Hops come through for a nice flavor and strength, but this still feels too thin and a bit lacking somehow. Good, but not great, I thought."
"Pours a clear light copper with a 1 finger off-white head that leaves a small bit of lacing. The nose is great, with some nice sweet caramel notes and grapefruity hops. The taste starts with a brief bit of sweetness that is quickly taken over by bitterness all over the middle and back of the tongue. The bitter aftertaste really sticks around, and the slightly high amount of carbonation is felt strongly on the tongue. This is a pretty good APA."
"I had this last night in Madison, WI on tap and I was very pleased. Evrything about this beer was great, smelled of a well hopped beer. The taste was well-rounded and not harsh at any point. I could've stayed and had 5 or 6 of these pretty easily!!!"
"Morey's Bottom Line: Without a doubt the best APA that I've had. This would make for a great session beer. However, if you don't like hops, you may want to work your way up to this one."
"Very drinkable, as it provides enough hops for purists as well as going down nice & easy for the average beer drinker. One of the better APA's I've been served."
"D: Not too complex but delicious nonetheless. I probably won't be buying this one again unless its on sale (I prefer SN Pale Ale to this any day) but I'll gladly finish the sixer."
"D: Probably won't buy and/or trade for this beer again. But I am glad I had the opportunity to at least give it a go."
"Pours a very, very slightly fogged copper amber. Nose is mildly perfume toned, but exhibits a much more stronger citrus tone. Flavor has quite a zing to it at first but calms down enough to show some nice hop character. Feel is smooth and it has a fairly full carbonation that stays on the tongue. This is very easy to drink and I consider this a good example of an APA."
"This would make an excellent session ale even with the 6.0 % ABV. With the freshness date, you will always know if your drinking this ale at its peak."
"I would consider this a fairly good american pale ale. Good auroma, good flavors, and the hops are not too overpowering."
"Overall, a fresh and taste smell, and I like its edginess. I would have like a little more balance and/or complexity. Definitely will drink more. I'd like to be armed with these during Cinco de Mayo."
"This is one of the best APA's I've had. Great Lakes never ceases to impress me. While they don't really have much in the line of beers leaning towards the extreme side of the spectrum, they will always rank in my top 5 breweries by ceaselessly producing great tasting beer that has amazing clarity, balance, and mouthfeel. Another one well done."
"D- A very nice pale ale to just sit back and enjoy the hops. Yet you can enjoy the hops without being destroyed. Would definitely consider this a good beer to drink while eating some pizza and watching the game. Another great and well balance beer from Gl. I swear this brewery just has the ability to make me want to continue to reach for their beer. They all have a ton of drinkability and all are tasty!"
"Not a lot of complexity here, just a very drinkable beer with plenty of hop flavor and enough malt to allow the hops to shine. It is an extremely well crafted example of the style and another top of the line brew from Great Lakes Brewing. This is an excellent APA for those who love the taste of citrusy hops. I'll be having many more."
"And yes for those of you who are wondering, the Cuyahoga river did catch on fire and this beer was thus named."
"This is a pretty nice APA. It poured up a light bronze orange colour with a one finger thick layer of froth. Smell was rather well balanced with an equal presence of hops and sweet malt. Taste, too seemed balanced nicely with sweet malts up front a lovely hop biterness on the finish. Everything about this seemed well proportioned, making this very drinkable."
"D - This is a good solid effort from Great Lakes. I think the brew could be closer to an IPA than APA but still a pretty stellar beverage in the drinkability category."
"Overall this was a pretty damn fine ale. Stayong up here in Ohio for a few days I am getting to try all these nice Midwest brews and this is one I would be glad to try again. A quality ale I will be sure to pick up more of the next time I am around."
"D- well balanced, flavor comes out much better at warmer temps, though hops feel aggressive the flavor is mellow, enjoyable pale ale, not a bad choice"
"Good drinkability. Very nice beer."
"Clear red amber color with a thin layer of foam that quickly dissipates to a ring. Not a lot of lacing. Might as well put this one in a mug since there is nothing to see. But if you dont look at it, this is a great everyday beer. Aroma is of citrus hops and floral undertones. Nice balance between malt and hops. Good mouthfeel and nice carbonation. A very drinkable beer. A great beer to drink with snacks while watching football."
"D - Decent pale ale with a pretty long-lasting bitterness for the style. Just a bit watery on the palate, possibly due to the date being two months past its prime. Not overly complex - mostly caramel and bready malts with citrus hops. Still, it's tasty and drinkable."
"Overall- A very solid beer that goes nicely with food. It can be a real ""go to"" beer."
"Thanks to whoever sent me this beer in whatever BIF it was sent in. Served chilled in my new Sam Adams pint glass, from a twelve ounce brown bottle. Poured a beautiful clear, rusty copper color. Noticed tons of carbonation bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass. Beer was topped off by a solid inch and a half head that was super white. Head had great retention and left huge amounts of sticky white lace behind. Smell was of floral hops, minor citrus notes, and tons of sweet malt and bread. Taste was quite good as well. A nice mild hoppiness balanced almost perfectly with plenty of sweet malt. Also noticed slight hints of yeast, orange peel. Seemed a bit grainy. Finished rather smooth with a bit of bitterness. Mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side and prickly. A very good drinkable beer."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color with a white head. Aromas of a small dryness and a small citrus/ grapefruty hop. In the taste, a dry maltiness, small hops, and somewhat earthy. A smooth, small bitterness in the mouthfeel, with a dry, small hop aftertaste. Not huge in aroma, and decent taste. Somewhat refreshing and and easy drinking."
"Pours a super clear burnt sunset gold with a one finger head that dies down to a thin layer of almost nothing. Stickiness is decent, a bit of webbing on the sides. Smell is a creamy almost peanut butter odor with a nice subtle citrus tingle in the nose. Caramel malt with a hint of bread in the nose. Taste is much of the same. The peanut butter flavor emerges again on the tongue with a bit of a hop bite, but is quickly taken over by some caramel malt. Aftertaste is actually pretty dry with a bit of a grassy flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good carbonation feel, but the bubbles are non-existant to the eye. Much more of a malty pale ale than a hoppy pale ale. Great Lakes makes amazing stuff. This one doesn't disappoint."
"All in all a nicely done pale ale, just not my preferred style."
"Easy to drink and a really delicious ale. I brought some back to NC with me from Ohio. Can't wait to get back so I can drink some more. Another quality offering from a brewer that needs to expand their distribution so we can get some in NC."
"D: Tastes great, readily available and very sessionable. I'll be getting more."
"Taste consisted of caramel malts with floral hops, though not too strong. A nice balance. Definitely easy to drink. Another great contribution from Great Lakes. I have yet to have a sub-par drink from them."
"Overall-this is more like an IPA in bitterness and strength but I really like it. Another quality brew from Great Lakes. I am really starting to like this brewery"
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a well balanced aroma of pale malts and floral hops. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth breadlike malt taste that boasts of pale and bisquit malts along with a nice selection of floral hops. The bisquit malts blend well with the hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a solid APA. I'm always a fan of the bisquit malts. The hop selection also adds a nice balanced flavor."
"D: Not bad, but not great. There's nothing all that offensive while drinking this brew, except the alcohol-tinged finish, but nothing about it made me want to grab another one right away, either."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice creamy one-finger head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is hoppy, malty, slight piny, and lots of caramel. The taste is a good balance of hops and malts, with lots of caramel. The finish is very dry and bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice Pale Ale, glad to have a chance to try it."
"Served from the tap, pours a copper, dark orange color with a creamy white head. Smell is sweet malt along with some floral, hoppy notes. Taste is very hoppy for an APA with a floral hop presence. Some sweet malt is also there. The mouthfeel on this one is highly carbonated as well. This is another great offering from Great Lakes. I like this APA a lot. Its a big beer for a Pale Ale."
"D: Very high."
"D: Great for the summer, although I wouldnt go out of my way to pursue this one."
"""Keep drinkin Southern Tier. Everything will be alright."""
"A great drinking beer. I cant believe it is so big almost an IPA. I love it."
"This is a very drinkable pale ale and my first Great Lakes product."
"The flavor is near-mild, but it pulls through with a large hop presence on the finish. Some light, wheaty notes coat the sides of the palate while the hops get more aggressive as the beer warms. Some citrus fruit and an almost metallic copper note peek through as well. Mouthfeel is above average for a pale: medium body, well-carbonated and crisp, with a nice little bite to remember the swig by. Overall, this is an extremely drinkable beer. It's tasty, refreshing, and leaves you wanting another, which one can easily manage with the 6% ABV. Nice job, Cleveland."
"Drinkability - No complaints about the beer in general. Appears to be a well-made APA, by a company that makes good beer with fantastic names and imagery. A touch too hoppy for my tastes, though."
"D- totally sessionable. easy to drink, great flavor, tastes great with lots of different food. anything from great lakes is bound to be a winnner."
"Very drinkable, quenching, could use a touch more dryness, but that's just me trying to find something to be picky about with this beer."
"Drinkability is good pale ale like so many others, wouldn't be a fav but nothing wrong here either. Want to thank wcudwight for this sample."
"D - Very drinkable, very sessionable APA."
"100% session able, great taste. Thanks dan for this sample."
"Drinkability: This is a good one, very drinkable."
"D- forms a really good pale ale which can be easily be drank over and over"
"This has to be one of my favorite Pale ales... ever. Do yourself a favor and pick up a six pack, scratch that, make it a case."
"Light to medium bodied, carbonation is not over done, I could drink more than a few of these (and have at this very pub) in one sitting."
"Picked this up in West Virginia while I was on vacation there. A great session beer that I wish I could find locally, It pours dark golden with a thin head that sticks around and creates some decent lacing. The smellis lovely, with beautifully balanced earthy hops and a light malt background. Some cherry fruitiness at the finish. The taste is a beautiful example of a pale ale. Relativeley lightbodied, but with a nice fruity and bitter flavor throughout. Cherries and orange zest and earthy hops make this a delightful quaffer. Nicely balanced and crisp but full mouthfeel make this one great to have in the fridge often."
"Pours pretty, light amber and clear with a white head of foam. This is a golden ale with a wonderful, cedar-pine aroma....but the taste...oh, my....crisp toasted malts mix wonderfully with cedar hops that pave the way to a dry, bitter finish. So simple, but so good. The mouthfeel trends towards light from medium and the carbonation is ample enough. I think this is my new favorite pale ale. A little strong for the style, but oh well...I'll just try not to drink too many."
"D - It fills up the mouth but goes down very smoothly. A fantastic pale ale."
"Perfect mouthfeel very delicious very drinkable"
"Drinkability: Perfect session beer. Not too filling or bloating. This sis a good beer to have when having 3 or 4."
"D: A very well crated pale ale and one of the finest I have had. There will always be room in my fridge for this one. Two thumbs up."
"A friend brought this back from Ohio. Wish it were available around here. A hoppy, yet sufficiently balanced deliciously smooth pale ale."
"Burning River definitely is a great well rounded PA and very crisp and clean with it being medium bodied."
"D- This is a very drinkable pale ale that is good for any season. Definately worth a try."
"Bottle courtesy of Jdoolin: Poured a deep copper color ale with a medium white bubbly head with good retention. Aroma of citrusy hops is quite dominant and quite enjoyable. Taste is quite hoppy with some real citrusy flavour is well backed by some generous caramel malt. Body is quite full with some great carbonation. Overall, I thought this was a well balance amp version of an APA."
"Pours to a dark gold color with medium off-white head that lingers well and leaves good lacing. Nice, hoppy aroma and flavor. Mouthfeel was tingly and bitter, with the bitterness carrying over perfectly into the nice, long finish. This is one of the best offerings I've had from Great Lakes."
"Medium bodied in the mouth, with a crisp dry finish. I'd say it's a pretty drinkable beer, nothing too offensive and the hops are a bit subdued. Worth a try."
"D: Very good."
"Pours a clear copper color with a nice one finger head that sticks around for a few minutes and leaves some lacing behind. Aroma is excellent citrus hops and really jumps out at you. Taste is citrus hops with some resiny pine. Surprisingly bitter for an APA, has more characteristics of an IPA. A little too bitter for me especially for an APA. Good beer, but not great."
"Poured out a golden color with a thin off white head, minimal lacing. The nose was fairly sweet, accompanied by lemon and melon. The taste was slightly hoppy, sweet, with grapefruit pith and melon. Had a medium body and crisp carbonation. Was a nice, very drinkable brew."
"Pours a slightly amber copper color, lots of visible bubbles, lots of nice foam that disappears after a couple minutes. Nose is fruity and floral hops with some sweetness. Taste is solid; first fairly hoppy, floral. Some mild caramel malt. Overall mild, but tasty."
"All in all, an average beverage from GL, prefer the Holy Moses or the darker beers."
"D: A real nice Pale Ale that borders on the IPA catagory. Incredible balance and drinkability. Refeshing and clean. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, which really adds to the drinkability. Goes down very smooth, I could session this easily"
"Drinkability: My old stand by from GLBC, usually enjoyed from the pub on draft, but represented nicely in the bottle. This one goes down quickly do to the sweetness from the malt but nicely balaced by a slight hop kick. At 6% ABV serveral can be enjoyed without feeling the effects the next day, especially if enjoyed at 3:00 in the afternoon."
"Not a super-star here but certainly an above average APA."
"Overall, a good beer, but I've had many APAs better. I think the reason is the earthiness in the flavor. I've noticed this in several other GL offerings, and its not really my favorite characteristic in a beer."
"overall this is a very enjoyable beer not very sessionable but very very refreshing"
"This is definitely a bit ""bigger"" than most pale ales - higher abv, more hop bitterness - but still a great pale ale. If you are wary of IPAs, however, this may not be a pale ale for you as it's sort of halfway between a pale ale and an IPA."
"light amber, almost blond in the glass with suprising clarity for the style, some creamy head and lacing. aroma was more subtle that i expected, some light/moderate pine notes along with light bready qualities and a touch of caramel mixed in. taste was initially a very light sweetness on the front of the palate followed by a moderate (for the style) hop bitterness, finish was clean and of average duration. mouthfeel was light/medium, dry in overall texture, and somewhat astringent."
"Pours a clean amber with nice carbonation trails and a dense craggy head. Intense lacing. Smell is faint floral hops, maybe some sweet citrus. Taste is crisp hops tendered somewhat by malt. A nice blend. The bitterness lingers and keeps my mouth crisp. Another fine Great Lakes brew."
"Smells of slight citrus. Nice florally hop presence. Taste is well balanced. Grapefruity hops, but not overly pronounced. A good balance of maltyiness as well. Highly drinkable! Well worth the experience."
"This is the typical apa (a sort of dumbed down ipa)"
"Not thick at all and almost slick as it goes down. Still no trouble actually drinking this as it is one of the smoothest beers I have had yet. Being exeptionally tasting, great looking, and smelling amazing this is a highly drinkable beer. I have bought 6-12 packs of this beverage on a regular basis. Another great brew from Great Lakes."
"Pours a transparent copper color with a foamy, eggshell white head that settles to a thin cap. Aroma consists mainly of floral hops, and a sweet malt note. Taste begins with a sweet, buttery malt foundation, that slowly gives way to a floral hop flavor, providing very nice balance. Mouthfeel....this beer is somewhat oily on the palate (but that's how I like 'em), going down the hatch with very little trouble. Awesome!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This one leans in the light bodied direction. It goes down really easy. This is a very drinkable beer, especially during the summer. Overall, one of my favorite Great Lakes beers. It's a regular in my fridge. Try it."
"Overall, a classic tasting pale ale with little to no flaws."
"This is your patio sipper. It's well-versed, but still knows it's place..."
"The bottom line: As I said in the intro, it's a classic style, and Great Lakes has brought their own twist to it. Good summer style brew."
"Much of what I remember from drinking from the bottle. However, on tap, the beer comes across smoother, softer, and much more bready / biscuity than I remember. Moderately malty and yeasty with the anticipated perfumy, citrus, piney hop aromas and flavors. Delicate, nearly Wit-like, textures: creamy, silky, and smooth. Overall, not as in-your-face as Sierra Nevada or Flying Dog, but perhaps better balanced. And to think, I nearly forgot how well this beer tasted. Silly me."
"Pours a clear, light amber color with a short, quickly falling head and a bit of lacing. It has a nice, clean, citrusy smell with a little sweet, malt backing. The taste is dry with a slightly bitter citrus flavor. Mouthfeel is medium & dry. It's a very drinkable, good APA."
"Pours a shade darker than golden and a fair white head. The nose displays a big fruity bouquet, honey, and bitter esters. The mouth is a little hard but smoothes out as the carbonation weaken towards the end. The hop profile here is dry, slightly chalky, perfumy florals, and a nice spice level that is a little acidic. Bready grain sweetness from the pale malts. The finish is dry and spicy with some alcohol flavor. A descent offering from Great Lakes and highly drinkable."
"D: One of the better pale ales I've had. Excellent balance of malt and hops. Clean and crisp--all the makings of a nice session brew in the summer. Definitely worth checking this one out."
"This is classified as an American Pale Ale, but it could easily pass as an English Pale Ale as well. This Ale begins and ends dry. While the bittering and flavor hops dominate, there is enough of a body to smooth the taste out. The carbonation allows for a complex blend of hops, and pale/crystal malts to come through. This has got to be one of the best commerical Pale Ales I've had. Great Lakes put a lot of effort into this style, and it shows."
"A very enjoyable beer. Nice balance and good example of the style."
"Very refreshing beverage with a nice complexity to it. Didn't think that it tasted like a 6%. Recommended."
"I had to pour the beer very hard to get any head and the head left in no time leaving every little behind. The color is absolutely clear and light. You can see right through it very easily. The smell is very nice and hoppy. The taste is a bit off, like it's a little old, but the bottle says best before 2/26/07. It's an ok taste, but it is just off. The mouthfeel is a bit watery and hard. I don't think I would try this again."
"Clear orange/red with a small white head. Nose is pretty hoppy, with a malt backbone. Taste is a decent hop flavor, slight malts, and some sour citrus. Nice. Mouthfeel is great, super smooth and well carbonated. Drinkability is good. Nice brew from GLBC."
"Cheers!"
"The body is good with a good a sweeter finish and a nice hidden ABV. Although 6 isn't exactly big, it has a nice flavor overall and a crisp and light wispy finish that helps accentuate the bitterness. I would never pollute a river with this gem."
"Pours a deep golden yellow and the thick head clings to the glass. Pine comes through in the aroma. Very hoppy, and quite bitter, in a good way. Just a perfect amount of citrus comes through the bitterness and cuts it quite well. Finishes very sweet and smooth. A fantastic tasting beer that I would highly recommend."
"pours a crystal clear gold color, with a nice white head that disipates fairly quickly. Nice carbonation. Aroma is hops and spice. Taste is malt, some hop bitterness, nice aftertaste. This is a very good example of a pale ale. This could be a good session beer"
"Prost!"
"Overall, a pretty good beer. seemed to get more bitter the more I drank it....weird. Maybe it was the bufallo chicken I had an hour ago."
"Perfect body/carbonation balance with oiliness well under control. This is easily one of my top-5 session brews."
"A friend brought me back from Cleveland a mixed six-pack of the Burning River, Nosferatu, and Eliot Ness. I decided to try the Burning River first, largely because of its [appropriate] name. This pours a diamond-clear amber and is topped off by a modest and fleeting beige head. To the nose there was not much bouquet, a soft malty base and some slight citrus. The taste was fuller and smokier at the outset than I would have expected from the smell (maybe they really did want to capture something of the old burning river), and there was definitely a hint of lime in the aftertaste. I rather liked the balance. The mouthfeel was thin, but not at all unusual for an American Pale Ale. A worthy brew!"
"All in all, I really enjoyed this beer and would recommend it."
"Drinkablity is very high, and this would be a hit for BA's and bud drinkers alike. This is my 1st beer from this brewery and I'm very happy to have tried it. Cheers!"
"D: Tasty and easy-to-drink, not too filling, decent kick, this is a good beer to stick with for an evening, unless you're looking for something heavier."
"Drinkability - could have one or two at a time.. not many..."
"D: The ale has a nice malty grain flavor that makes it easy to drink."
"Why this is an APA defies me, definitely tastes and smells IPA all the way. A good bridge beer if you don't want something pure hops and don't want something real malty. Enjoyable experience."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-y"
"Most definitely drinkable. A fine product."
"Got this with the Great Lakes sampler pack, which I highly recommend. Poured from the 12oz bottle into pint glass, maintained a copper tone, with acceptable lacing and head. The aroma was strong with hints of pine and pepper. Strong flavors in this one, I feel that if you like an IPA you'll be more pleased with this than the average APA drinker. Overall very drinkable and enjoyed this one."
"Overall a very good APA experience. This beer has more kick than your average APA. Highlt recommended"
"Gotta love the name too. Great Lakes takes a dark moment in Cleveland history and turns it into a great beer. That a way GLB, doing your best to boost the Cleveland image!"
"Clean, tasty, lowish ABV. A very good beer in many respects whether it be party application or dinner with the lady."
"Also, whenever I have this much grapefruit and pine in a beer, it's usually labeled an IPA."
"so far this is my favorite from Greatlakes besides there blackout stout. This beer makes me proud to be born in Ohio."
"Taste strikes a really nice balance -- juicy without being too sweet, mild carbonation, and a light mixture of piney/floral hops that stay well within sane APA bounds. Very light hints of pepper towards the finish. Stands out in the crowd of ""just another"" pales for its almost perfect equilibrium."
" Another tasty and highly drinkable pale ale, as they all should be."
"D: I must say, not an aptly named beer. Not usually a big fan of pale ale's but I like this one. Actually has some character to it."
"The pour into my Spaten becker raises a fast-falling one finger white head with some large bubbles, over a bright golden-copper body. Lacing is sticky but thin. The smell is midly caramelly and sweet, but dominated by the piney, grapefruity, resinous hops. Actually, there seems to be a balance here. The taste is actually quite mild, not as sweet as expected, but not as hoppy either. GL's beers are certainly showing a lot of balance in today's triple tasting. THe mouth is medium, with again, some very fine, smooth carbonation. The hoppiness does build, perhaps hurting drinkability a bit. They know how to build good drinkers in Cleveland!"
"Crisp and refreshing PA, Im looking forward to a few more six packs next spring. This is a good warm weather drinker. Crap, Im getting thirsty just remembering the brew."
"D- It was fun to try, but not really my taste."
"Copper amber body with a dense, light sandy flecked head that sticks around. Caramel and fruit malts prominent. Light buttered bread. Citrusy and spicy hops. Toasted caramel sweet maltiness up front. Citrusy hops come in and provide solid balance. Fruity malt in an otherwise bitter finish. Well-balanced and very drinkable. Medium body with a slightly creamy feel."
"Eric"
"Overall, this is a good example of an American Pale Ale, strong on the hops, but not over-the-top, trying to be an IPA. I think it's a great session beer, albeit a bit strong alcohol-wise."
"Very drinkable, very flavorful. A damn fine Pale Ale."
"On the whole, this is probably better classed as an IPA, and I had to score it down a notch for being (IMHO) mislabeled. If IPAs are your thing, though, it's one of the better ones in its class."
"I have yet to have a GLBC beer that I didn't like. This could just as easily be considered an IPA though."
"Pours with white creamy head. Golden amber color very clear for the color.Piney citrisy aroma.sweet malty taste piney citusy aftertaste just like the aroma. Really makes you mouth water for more.I have this beer on my home draught system several times a year everybody really enjoys this beer."
"drinkability is good. not too big or heavy. if i was in ohio i could easily see this being a regular purchase."
"Beer pours a nice clear golden brown. It gives an excellent head that is nice and creamy, with excellent retention and lacing. Smell has nice floral and hoppy auromas, which is the same with the taste, which has a good hoppy bitter ending. Mouthfeel is somewhat flat, medium bodied. Overall a nice pale ale."
"mf/d: This is a tad dry but overall pretty slick. This is very drinkable and i do agree that it gets better as it warms."
" It's a mostly clear, rich amber with a nice dry, stiff head almost like beaten egg white. The aroma is rich and complex-- warm malt scent, fresh hops and a hint of spice and earthiness. It's perhaps a little more full bodied than most APAs with relatively low carbonation but just enough to tingle in the mouth. The taste is excellent, full and well balanced. You taste sweet malts, tart hops a bare spark of alcohol and a perfect yeasty bite in the aftertaste, but none steps on the others. It's extremely well-crafted and as with all GL products it's a great value."
"Pours a pretty golden-orange color with a pretty, creamy white head that takes its time sauntering down to a thin layer. Beautiful aroma of crisp floral hops, light sweet malt, and notes of caramel, pine, and grapefruit. Palate is a tasty blend of crisp, floral hops and light sweet caramel malt. A tangy, piney finish comes through with a hint of zesty citrus. Body is light, yet creamy, with a clean finish. Good lord, I wish I had purchased more than one of these. Hopefully they'll expand distribution to the west coast soon."
"Overall, this is just a fantastic pale ale. One of the best I have had in a long time, if not the best. Fairly priced, so don't hesitate to pick this one up when you see it."
"This is right up there with Stone Pale Ale. Fantastic beer."
"Drinkabitly is great. A very good session beer except for maybe the 6%. Overall a great APA."
"D - Overall, this is an excellent beer that is very drinkable. Refreshing on a hot summer day, this is one that I will definitley go back to."
"A good, but not great brew. Certainly recommended, but I would prefer a little more complexity. The hop bite is slightly harsh and one dimentional, lacking the full flavor I would prefer."
"Another good solid beer from great lakes, while I prefer the Commodore Perry to this, its pretty tasty."
"A very good drinkable pale ale. Great summertime brew."
"That's my impression of Burning River Pale. It's good, but not fantastic, in every category. This would make for a good 'safe beer' to bring to a party. Good - not great - , but not controversial, and can be easily forgotten about. It's the Kent Hrbek of beers."
"Medium bodied, with an evident hoppy prickly texture. Very nice and very drinkable."
"This was just another beer by my standards. The appearnce was nothing unique with a golden color and a moderate head. The smell was hoppy and almost bitter. The taste was mild at first with a powerful bitter finish. Dominant hop flavors overpower the other notes. The mouthfeel is caulky and thin, but is someone expected from the smell and color so not a bad trait. Over all drinkability isnt fantastic but good for a tasting with friends."
"Pours a golden amber with a medium head that fades quickly. Smells strong of hops and grassy notes are present. Tastes like your slightly above average pale ale but isn't remarkable. Overall a solid beer to drink if you are in the mood for an affordable lighter fare."
"Pours clear and bright amber, with a nice head that fades to lacing on the edges. Earthy hops and grainy malt dominate the nose. On the tongue, the hops come out first, but then the grains take over, with some intensely cereal-like flavors. It's a bit too grainy for my taste -- the end of the palate and the finish are pure vienna malts. Nonetheless, it goes down smooth and it's interesting enough. Decent."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beer is a transparent amber color with a small head that disipates down to nothing fairly quickly. Smell of grassy hops. Some pine in there too covering a subdued malt profile. Tastes much like the smell, but not as strong as I was expecting. The same notes are there, but every flavor is toned down a bit in comparison to what I found on the nose. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Drinkability is very high because of it's smooth texture and low abv. I would have no problem hammering back a few of these."
"definitely one GLBC's weaker offerings"
"Drinkability: The clean finish and non-heavy body helps this go down smooth."
"Bottom line, it's neck-and-neck with SNPA. I still give the APA edge to Sierra Nevada, with Great Lakes' Edmund Fitzgerald a slight favorite over SN Porter. You will not go wrong with this beer."
"Drinkability - this goes down very easy, and I can have several of these in a session. A really good brew, one for the hop cultists, yet mild mannered enough to possibly help your non-BA friends get that old time hop religion."
"This is a temendous brew. High quality to say the least. Some malt on the front, terrific hoppy bitterness on the back. The water, well, it's great lakes!! Almost has a toasted almond flavor in the malt. Great citrusy love down the middle. An awesome brew, an awesome session brew. Very highly recommended!"
"Man, I'm gonna miss these guys."
"Pretty good pale ale, though somewhat overrated IMO. The aroma is its best quality; could use a bit more body and malt. Still worth trying, though."
"6% alcohol, and can't tell at all. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel begs you to take sip after sip. Woah this is going down fast. Great beer from Great Lakes."
"Another fine product form Great Lakes. This is a good pale ale. I mean it when I say good, it didn't captivate me like a great beer would have. It had a nice copper color to it and a nice citrus/hoppy aroma as well. As all APA should it had a nice hop taste to it."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Amber in color. Flowery in smell with the usual hops overtones in an IPA. Good mouthfeel and incredibly drinkable, as I had 4 in my sitting. One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Incredibly balanced. Nice aftertaste of hops and not over-hopped, which can be a tendency in this IPA climate. I highly reccommend this beer."
"D: This beer is near pefection for an APA. I can't believe it took me this long to try it. I'm stupid."
"A lite copper color, with an off white head that disappates very quickly. A slight scent of roasted barley, with a string citrus hop aroma at the end. The taste starts with the sweetness of the malt and then the hop flavor begins to dominate the taste. In the mouth it feels watery with a slight tingle from the carbonation. Even with the lite look and faint scents, the flavor was fairly good. The mouthfeel was surprisingly disappointing, but overal this is at best an average beer."
"O--Probably would pair this with some food for future drinks, great ""Big"" APA. Go for it if you are hop head looking for a lighter fix than a barleywine or DIPA."
"Fairly smooth, it would be a bit smoother if it weren't quite this hoppy. Not over-the-top hoppy, but a bit high for the style IMO. A medium-bodied offering. Fairly clean finish, would like more aftertaste from such a good tasting brew. It comes across as kind of a weak brother to an IPA in regards to the hop level and the flavor. All over, a good beer, wish it was available in FL."
"Drinkability: Dry mouthfeel leads me to believe this brew is lighter than it is. Very easy drinker (doesn't make you full too quickly), with ample alcohol to give you a slight buzz if you imbibe too quickly or too much."
"Drinkability is among the best. A damn tasty beer that isn't extreme in any respect. What makes this beer is a lot of great qualities extremely well executed. A malty spicy and smoky pale ale that doesn't get tiresome at all in your mouth. A superior APA in all respects."
"Notes: A very solid beer and onme of the best APA's out there if you like them this hoppy. This beer is growing on me and will pick some up in the future."
"Served cool from 12 oz bottle in pint glass on 1/24/06. Clear, copper color with small white head that quickly dissipates, leaving only a slight amount of lacing. Tiny bubbles of carbonation lasting forever. Smell was citrusy and floral hops and not much else. Dominant is floral hops with some citrus; malt is evident more than other APAs I have tried although hops still prevail. Pleasant bitterness. Moderate carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Easy to drink although right now I am not a big fan of hops. No doubt that will change with time and my score of this beer will improve."
"12oz. bottle, had straight from bottle. Couldn't say much about appearance for this reason, my guess is a typical IPA yellow/ orange that isn't transparent b/c of the strong smell. I could smell the strong hop element, most apparent of anything else. Has a good body to it, a certain crispness that is associated to pale ales, but this was a little too harsh for me. The strength of the hops and the 6.00 abv took me off guard. Leaves a bitterness from these two elements that I didn't find very pleasant, so an average score for drinkability. I'm definitely not dissing this beer, you just have to know what to expect from it."
"Flavor is hoppy per the style, with some grapefruit flavors coming through with some orange citric notes, but the malt is a little stronger than what I'm used to. Biscuity, almost like pretzels on the first sips. Strong and nice, really well-balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style, I think, but it is refreshing."
"Unfortunately for some reason, I can't drink too much Burning River in one sitting. I enjoy it, but it tends to upset my stomach (much the same way grapefruit juice does) and I feel sick. I love the beer and I love to start the night with a pint of it, but it's not something I can continue drinking. It took awhile for me to come around, but this is a nice beer."
"Best by date of Dec. 02, 2005. Had this single bottle from some local shop during my last night in Madison. I'd like to try a fresher bottle, as it seems that some of the other reviewers found more floral hops in their samples."
"Excellent example of an American Pale Ale. This beer has an excellent nose to go along with it great hoppy characteristics. Burning River is very true to style. A good beer to serve when introducing novices to different styles of beer. Stands well against its big brother, Nosforatu, another of Great Lakes offerings."
"After popping the top, my first thought was I was smelling a porter. There is a hint of chocolate and citrus, mostly orange. It has a good blast of hops. The color is dark amber. The head was small and didn't last long. I bought this on sale. The normal price is a little high. It is good, but not $8 per six pack good."
"Drinkability: This is one that I never get tired of. A great session brew from the north coast."
"Clear amber-orange with nice fluffy head and moderate carbonation. Floral, pine, and citrus zest in the nose. Bicuity malt, too. The first sip is quite sturdy in hop content, biscuit dough malt in the middle, and a wonderfully bitter citrus hop finish. Bergamot and grapefruit pith. The flavors are superbly balanced in this one. A not unpleasant mineral taste lingers for just a second. The mouthfeel is doughy and medium bodied. Quite nice. More than adequate lacing down the sides of the glass, too. Drinkability: very high. If the price were comparable, Id pick this one over SNPA (the extra hoppiness of this pale ale gives it a slight edge over that champ in my book). This would make an excellent session beer for hopheads."
"Short, dense, off-white head with plenty of clumpy lacing. Clear golden amber colour. Citrus hop aroma, slight floral character with sweet, biscuity malt. Good balance between hop bitterness and malt sweetness to start, citrusy flavour with a bit of floral hop and pine resin fill out the middle. Bitterness grows and lingers in the finish, but never overwhelms the rest of the flavour. Medium/light body, moderate carbonation. This is a solid pale ale."
"overall: this is a great apa. ipa quality hoppiness and bitterness, but not quite as much as alpha king. actually, this brew is only just a small step down from the alpha king. balancing malts with easy to drink characteristics make this a helluva session brew. i prefer the alpha king, but i know i could drink this one all night."
"Very good beer all around. Full flavor that sticks it dead-on all the way from the start to the finish. Great lakes is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. Kudos to the brewer on this."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is pertty good. I am in favor of the amount of carbonation that this beer has. Overall this beer feels quite good on the palate. I will definitely be buying this beer in the future. I am quite amazed at how much I like it."
"overall, a great APA from my favorite brewery, these people really know what they're doing. excellent beer!"
"Overall, a nice Pale Ale. Bitter and hoppy, but not in any sense unpalatable. Substantial enough to make its presence known, but would be a good session beer, nonetheless."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a golden light amber with a tight snow white head and a hint of spotty lacing. Nose is full with floral/fruity hops and a solid malt body. Taste continues with the mellow, but complex floral/herbal hops, some tropical fruit, grapefruit, and caramel malt. Mouthfeel is thinnish, with thin, fine carbonation that tickles the tongue. This is a damn tasty APA here. I'm not exactly a hophead yet, so I really enjoyed the subtle but complex and present floral hops. Probably my favorite pale ale of any type to date. Great Lakes has another winner here."
"This beer is a tough one to judge. I think it could be hitting my palate the wrong way and I might like it better the next time I try it. Probably better on draught too. Worth trying."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer that I will surely offer to my PA drinking friends."
"Pours a beautfiul clear dark copper with about a finger of white head. Smells very good- citrusy hops some sweet fruit character. taste is mostly nice citrusy hops but there are some complexities here as well. Finishes with a lingering bitterness. Body is medium to full and rather dry. Easy to drink and a very nice pale ale overall."
"Bad river, good beer."
"A great offering from GLBC. Very unique APA, which I find to be the single greatest attrbiute of an APA because theres SO DAMN MANY OF THEM!!! This oe sticks out in my mind though becuase of the slight sweetness and that rotten bread smell. Good beer, but not a session APA IMO. Not as drinkable as an APA should be IMO."
"This is my second beer from Great Lakes, I have have to say, these guys are about two steps off from becoming a major contender in the Micro brewing world. Poured out to a nice orange yellow color with a very short lived head. Low carbonation. No lace in the glass. Aromas of orange and clove are very present, as are notes of pine and earth. Flavor was a bit on the flat side, as this beer could have benefited from higher carbonation to liven up the taste. Flavors of hops and malt, with traces of citrus, and a tea like finish. Not bad, but like I said, the addition of more carbonation would really kick this brew up a notch. Decent mouthfeel. I'd have another, but not before trying something else. I really feel Great Lakes is on to something with their beers, but somewhere it's just not connecting... Still, this beer is worthy of a try."
"another solid offering from Great Lakes that I am just getting around to rating."
"D- This is a very smooth drink with a great juicy hop flavor. A well-built, easy-drinking beer."
"An excellent pale ale, with more hops and bitterness than many so called IPAs out there. The body is a rich red-amber color, with a sticky, fine head of off white. Smell is of juicy hops with a sweet noble air to them (don't quote me on that). Medium body with a nice sugary caramel flavor, though clean and dry. Perfect balance with the sweet and citrusy hops; orange, lemon and pine tar. Outstanding, and deserving of its many accolades. Great Lakes turns out some awesome beers."
"- Overall, this beer is drinkable, but I doubt I'll have another in the near future."
"Thanks, vwcraig, for the opportunity to re-visit"
"A clear dark copper colour in the glass with a thin head that disipated quickly. Very faint aroma. It starts with a slighly sweet malt flavour but finishes very, very dry with slight bitter and grassy flavours. It seems to lean more towards being an IPA then just a Pale. A very good drinkable beer, but the very dry finish left me wanting to follow it with something a little more refreshing."
"Pours a clear golden color with reddish hues. A huge white head caps it off. The aroma is big, and of citrusy hops. The taste is hoppy, yet balanced. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a very good APA. It is nice and hoppy without being so hoppy that it verges into IPA territory."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours deep amber with an off-white two finger head. Decent head retention followed by mild lacing. Aroma is of floral hops and sweet malt esters. Rich malt taste upfront, followed by pronounced hops and residual sweetness. Fairly well balanced for an american pale ale. Light to medium bodied, the low carbonation and strong aftertaste make this less smooth but more robust."
"12oz bottle with ""best by"" date of 3/30/05, I tasted on 7/29/05. Pours a clear copper color with acceptable head. Aroma is citrous and very nice. Bitterness is low, but fits very well with the malt profile. Althought this bottle may have degraded somewhat by age, I'm guessing fresh from the keg this would really be something special."
"A clean copper colored beer. Has a big foamy beige head with some lace. There is a sweet malty cereal aroma with a creamed corn note in the background. A start of malty sweetness on the tongue followed a a light dry peppery hop finish. Easy drinking but I was put of by the corn note in the aroma."
"This is the brew I would use to intoduce friends and family to the craft brew scene...looking foward to trying their others."
"The beer poured a clear copper color with a thin tan head. Despite the lack of head, there did appear to be a nice level of carbonation. The aroma has a pleasant mix of grapefruit rind from the hops, and toffee/caramel and dates from the malt. The taste has more citrus than the nose suggested. It really comes on strong up front. The caramel malt comes mid-way through the flavor and the finish has a nice sharp bite. The mouth feel is very smooth with a nice richness for a pale ale. All together this presents a nice drinakbility."
"Nice golden color-a slight touch of coppery hue to it. Low aroma. More yeast then anything. Very nice hop flavor and a soft malty sweetness to tie it all together. Too many pale ales are ""cascadeish"" like Sierra Nevada (which is great mind you) or so bitter they just dont ""gel"". This has a very nice balance of the 2 flavors. Good body as well. A very drinkable beer and a great pale ale example."
"Taste is very bitter and bitingly so. No subtle citrus nuance, no floral complexity, just a cutting, sharp hoppy bitterness...and I like it. After awhile you can pick out some fruity malt but this is a vehicle for delivering hops to the bloodstream. A lingering hoppy bitterness. Very long. Not so hoppy to be an IPA but really close. A hops showcase. Pretty good."
"A nice pale ale, almost bordering on IPA, but not quite there. Nicely done Great Lakes."
"Drinkability: A highly drinkable pale ale, if you are a lover of pale ales. Another good one from Great Lakes."
"Overall: A very good pale ale, and yet another excellent brew from Great Lakes."
"I was pleased with this beer and it's overall flavor. Reminds me of Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA."
"Great well rounded, highly drinkable, Pale Ale. As others have noted, it is almost in between a Pale Ale and an IPA."
"The beer pours an ambered golden color with a 2 finger head that falls to a quarter inch of foam over top. Very pretty color. The nose is very clean. Good crisp citrusy hop and a well blended caramel. One of the better APA's I've smelled in a while. The flavor is good as well. A slight bitter on the start, moving to a spicey and peppery hop. The caramel malt dances lightly in the background. The hop carries through as a light bitter in the background. Very nice flavor as well. The feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation. Very drinkable beer. The flavor and nose work very well together. Definately a session beer. I give it an A+."
"I can't believe something so tasty is named in honor of a river that was so polluted it caught on fire!"
"I need something special for a Pale Ale to stand out. This one was good but not great. Hoppy but with average mouthfeel for the style. Great name and label (nice sense of humor). No real head or lacing, aokay carbonation. Could have been better but nothing to complain about either."
"Yup, hops on the tongue. Crisp, enjoyable, some malts occassionaly break through, but this beer is about hops. After the mild break on the pallete and the whisper of some spice, more unique hops rise on the throat, with a bitter finish. This is as good a Pale Ale as you'll find, and it goes excellent with a variety of strong, spicy foods. I couldn't drink these one after the other, but one is very nice and worth trying."
"The appearance was dominated by a nice light golden color, with a fair amount of noticeable carbonation. Nice thin head, good retention, but nothing extraordinary to the eye. A subtle fruity hop aroma was detected, but I expected to find a little more in this department. The taste was mildly bitter but with a nice all-around balance. Again, nothing too fancy or remarkable, but not disappointing, either. The mouthfeel of the beer was a little fuller than I expected from the initial appearance, but the added body rounded out the brew farily well. Nice session drink."
"Drinkablity?? Yes, I'd love another, and another, and another."
"Overall, a good choice in the pale ale/IPA category. Not the greatest brew from GLBC but a very good representation of the style."
"Notes: Smooth drinking Pale Ale. Almost session style. The body is full, but it doesn't seem to be the body of a 6% beer. Easy drinking Pale. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for this one."
"The mouthfeel is bracing and slightly astringent. Nice carbonation levels. Very easy drinker, would be a nice session beer. Well done!"
"Apricot colored liquid with fine columns of bubbles rising from bottom to top. A half inch cap of beige foam sits atop, slowly receding, but leaving no lace. Faint aroma of biscuity malts and sweet fruits, some fine hops coming through. Flavor is understated, very subtle. Malt profile is very low and decidely lacking. Hops are all in the finish, very citrusy, mostly orange peel. A light malt and pine flavor lingers in the mouth, and a piney tingle hangs in the back of the throat."
"Intertwines flavor nicesly. medium mouhtyfell, and drinkable even on a summer day. Nice pale ale here, it's a keeper"
"from a (rather large) taster.. this beer is a orangey concoction with yellow outline around the edge, like a cloud of flavor immersed in a lager. creamy foam rides on top with the slightest hint of lacing in the glass. nutty in the nose and bitter with hops and a citrusey orange body with some cinnamon in the finish. roasted malts come out big time in the flavor as well as the smoky-flavored hops. this beer was medium-bodied, which added to the enjoyability and savour but allowed the drinkability to remain high as a kite. a surprisingly good pale ale here packed with flavor, and benefitting from it. breaking the style mold here pays off in spades, and leaves me with the memory of one of the best apa i've ever encountered. would have ordered another if the grand cru wasn't such the bomb sh*t."
"Drinkability: Good. No problems here."
"Pours a nice copper with a touch of pink hue and is a bit darker than most pale ales, probably closer to some IPA's I've had. Head and lacing are decent. Smells like citrus fruit, (lemon?), with some sort of earthiness that is hard to put a finger on. Taste has a definite citrus twang, and some toasty malts. A bit hoppier than most pale ales but it's actually quite balanced. Mouthfeel is fine. Drinkable. Overall this beer is good but a little middle of the road."
"Another great beer from one of my favorite breweries. It is a nice change from the malty beers I tend to favor. When you're craving something a bit more refreshing that will go down easy this brew will be just fine."
"Pours a dark golden color with a generous frothy light tan head. Smell is cascades all the way, very appealing. Some caramel malts can be detected in the nose as well. Taste is initially bitter. The malt backbone is there, definitely caramel flavors, maybe some toffee. The hops are the standout of this brew however. For being hopped soley by cascades this one has a nice flavor. Citrusy, mainly grapefruit and lemon, but not overpowering. The sweet malts balance this brew well. Mouthfeel is great for a pale ale, medium body, but not too thick as to limit the drinkability. A very nice pale ale, definitely in my top tier."
"Tasted: 03/29/05"
"This beer has a nice, clear amber appearance with a creamy head. The aroma seems a little off, like a cheap lager, but with hops that cover up most of the bad smell. There's also another aroma that's like fruitloops cereal. Pine hop flavor, but balanced. This beer is on the big side for a pale ale. Pretty good, but most of GLBC's beers are more than pretty good."
"An exceptionally drinkable beer resulting in a beer that's greater than the sum of its parts."
"Mouthfeel is medium, drinkability is high. Establishes a very good balance, very much ignored in many of the pale ale style, me likey. Much thanks to AKSmokedPorter for sharing."
"Amber with a decent sized light tan head. Some scattered lacing around the glass as the head stays afloat. A bit of citric hops jump out first with the smell before the sweetness of the malt comes in. Nice balanced smell but nothing too spectacular. Citric hop bitterness combines with a caramel sweetness in the flavor. Notes of biscuit, pine and earthy hop under tones could be noticed. Slightly bitter after taste with a touch of grapefruit. Mouthfeel is medium and a tad rough on the tongue with its hops. Solidly drinkable as it is good and flavorfull. I could have a few."
"Hazy amber color, with fizzy head that contains lots of small bubbles. Heavy flora hop aroma, even from a distance, the sent of cascade hop shines through. Medium body, which is full of hop. Starts very floral, then moves to a nice bitterness and then the bitterness slowly fades away. A very well overall hopped session beer."
"Reddish copper, thin eggshell colored head. Smells of citrus hops and sweet toffee malts. Taste is initially citric hops, followed by a candy like sweetness, regressing to a lingering, bitter resinous finish. Medium body and slightly slick finish. Great session beer."
"This ale cascades from the bottle a hazy reddish orange with a healthy white head. The aroma is a beautiful hoppy blend of citrous, fruits, and flowers, married to a clean maltiness. Up front, the hops bite sharply. The initial kick is smoothed by well blended malts, leading to a finish of lemon-like bitterness and the slightlest presence of alcohol. A nice medium mouthfeel is about perfect for this style. Good carbonation adds to the sharp and refreshing hops flavor. Chalk up another solid brew for GLBC."
"Named after one of the USA's most embarrasing environmental events, when the Cuyahoga River caught on fire in 1969. This is one of the more drinkable APAs I've sampled. It pours a hazy, honey amber body with a small offwhite head that retains well and leaves some curtains of lace. Aroma is very enticing, with citrusy grapefruit and orangepeel, some pine cone, and a solid caramel malt background. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Very smooth. Taste is well balanced, with lots of citrusy hops and bready caramel malt sweetness. Very smooth, with a slightly bitter citrusrind finish and aftertaste. This is more drinkable than my go-to American Pale Ale, SNPA. Smoother and better balanced. Very nice!"
"I am a body freek and like this medium full body. This beer taste is great (from 45° F to Room temp) in inspite of being old. Worth the trip across Missouri to locate this Champ APA this being said after trying about half of the Other APA rated 4.0+ overall. Burning River is most worthy of being in these good brew's company"
"It's funny how how you can't always match your memoires and expectations, though."
"This is a great pale ale that doesn't go over the top. It's the kind of beer that makes me thirst for more. Great Lakes is a brewer that never disappoints."
"Starts off with a bit of a bready flavor which I believe may come from the beer being slightly old. The hops and lively carbonation wash away this notion before it even becomes a concern. Quite hoppy for an APA. This is superbly drinkable stuff. An ""ahhh...hits the spot"" type of beer. Bubbly and refreshing on the tongue without ever getting dumbed down. Just plain solid."
"This brew has a slightly hazy copper body, with a cream foam head that leaves behind a nice lace trail. It has a bitter hop aroma, with citrus tones along for the ride. Light sweet malts up front, punctuated by nice bitter hop tones. Bits of fruit as well. Full bodied. This here is a damn good PA."
"In Pittsburgh visiting the parents for the holidays I was glad to be able to pick up some Great Lakes, which I can't get in Massachussetts. I haven't had these since maybe high school, and I am rediscovering their greatness. Appears a light and clear orange color, very pale and bubbly with little head to speak of. Smell is a real treat; strong citrus hop scent followed by any fruit you care to conjure up while you're taking your whiff. Pears, apircots, apples, grapefruit... the whole damn fruit basket. Nice fruity malt flavor for sure. Enough already. The taste is also strong citrussy bitter hops, but that's not the entire picture, as in some beers. The point of this beer wasn't to make is overly hoppy, but to balance that flavor with a ripe sweetness of fruity malts. Grassy too. Great complex flavors, all over the place. Mouthfeel is excellent. Almost feels/tastes like a less intense barleywine in terms of thickness and syrupiness. Great smooth and sticky juicy feeling. A real treat to drink. I'm gonna miss this beer when I head back east."
"Drinkability: A fine IPA for some serious session drinking."
"This beer pours a very cloudy amber color with a medium head that doesn't stay around too long, but leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is wheaty and yeasty and has some citrus in there too. This one is moderately hoppy up front but has a nice caramel malt back to it. Has a floral hop flavor. Finish is dry, but nice. Well made."
"12 ounce bottle. If anything the hop flavor and hop aroma could be more prominent to make this beer truly shine."
"This is a highly companionable beer you could drink any day or any time of year. Special thanks to cmaruschak."
"When I'm in the mood for a pale ale, this is usually the one I crave. It's very good."
"Drinkability and overall: Thumbs up! What a great beer. I'm a stout/porter guy and I could drink this forever. Good stuff."
"A judiciously balanced pale ale, I'm just not fond of the finish though the rest is wonderful session material."
"It has dropped SNPA from its personal place as best 'all around' Pale. I want this put on at my house."
"The taste is hoppy and dry on the palate. A bit of almond or walnut skin with a very smooth ending. An excellent example of the style and a great 2 row flavor sits in the mouth."
"Medium bodied and worth having a few. Very fruity malty flavor (peach and oranges) with some caramel and biscuits. Big hopness here tames those sweet flavors very nicely. This is a lot larger than several of the other APAs Ive had recently and is very tasty."
"I enjoyed this."
"This beer pours a nice golden copper color with a sweet 1 inch head. A nice floral / citrusy hops aroma fills my nose and beckons me to take that first sip. Taste has a wonderful hops presence couple with a great biterness...a damn fine example of a APA. Some floral / piney notes come through as well. This is a awesome brew that has great drinkability. It's up there with SNPA in my book. Two thumbs up to Great Lakes Brewing for this ale. I look forward to trying some of their other offerings as well."
"Pours a cloudy copper color, nice thick head of small white bubbles, not much lacing. Sweet pine grapefruit cascade, hoppy aroma. Medium body, soft and creamy mouthfeel, great hoppy citrus and caramel flavors, a great session beer, very easy to down a few, another great one from this brewery."
"An excellent American Pale Ale...this one is solid and satisfying through and through. Great Lakes hasn't disappointed me...how they manage to brew such consistently excellent brews are beyond me. Many of their brews are just stupendous and leaders in the style, and this is no exception. Recommended."
"This ale is very well balenced, perfect amout of hops, one of the better pale ales ive had, I commend GLBC on a fantastic job."
"Pours a slightly clouded golden orange color with a good, thick light beige head. Lots of tea-like malt tannins and hops in the aroma as well as flowery esters in the nose. Sweetened tea is most dominant in the malt, and the hops take the background, but not too far back. Carbonation is good, which keeps it light and drinkable. Pretty much what I'm looking for in an APA, quaffable, yet having some character in the sense that the citrusiness of the hops meld nicely with the malt."
"ng"
"Wyll-"
"Clear copper-amber color with gold highlights. Disappointingly little head even after an aggressive pour. A rather assertive nose highlighted by citrus hops and biscuity sweetness. Taste is complex and balanced, with a nicel, citrusy crush of hops that endures. Malty sweetness shows up it the middle and fades to a smooth finish. Nice mouthfeel in this one, with a pleasant combination of smoothness and just enough clingy hopes to keep things interesting."
"This fine ale pours a nice clear golden brown with a rather small head. The smell is sweet and hoppy, but nothing too spectacular. It tastes of hops and leaves a refreshing bitterness. All in all, a very solid pale ale - definitely the best I have sampled from the great state of Ohio."
"Someday I'm gonna' have to admit to myself that this is probably my favorite style. It's always so satisfying. This one works for me."
"Thanks to oldcrustacean for the bottle!"
"A solid and drinkable beer. A mainstay type."
"Sampled on tap at the brewery. This one was a light golden/orangish with minimal head as it was filled to the brim. Having just walked to the brewery, I was hoping for a somewhat easy-drinking thirst-quencher to start off the evening. I got that & more as this one was not only perfectly crafted & supremely drinkable, but also very well hopped. Aroma of floral, woody hops with a hint of citrus & toasty malts. Flavor follows the nose as this one is a tremendously well balanced mix of toasted malts & muted, but delectable floral, mildly citrusy hops. Medium bodied, very clean, well rounded brew that departs with a lasting dry bitterness. As drinkable as it gets, just an expertly crafted pale ale."
"another great brew from great lakes. pours a medium amber with a nice fluffy head. lacing is immense leaving a ring with every drink. smell is hoppy and floral with a slight citrus tinge. taste is good. a decent amount of hops in front with a slight malt backround. mouthfeel is sticky. alittle too much but, still a great drinkin' ale. the more i drank the more i liked this apa. pretty damn good."
"Final Thought: This is a great APA and can't wait to buy a keg of this stuff in the long-run. Great everyday beer!"
"I really enjoy this beer. It is a nice pale ale that is very smooth and well balanced. The ale is amber in color and has a nice foamy white head. The nose is sweet and slightly hoppy with a biscuit aroma. The taste is amazing. I really enjoy the matching of the hops with the malts. This is a very complex pale ale. The mouthfeel is great but I would love to have this on cask with a little less carbonation. Drinkablility is exceptional."
"Taste is well-balanced and smooth. Hops are the backbone but not all that bitter. A very likeable brew that is extremely drinkable. A great session beer that I'd love to be able to get down here in NC."
"pours with a large golden tinted head, 3 fingers tall. Light copper color. Lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma is very noticable; fruity and floral. The taste is what an APA should taste like. Citrusy but not overpouring. Bitter but not ""blegh"" bitter. Crisp. Just a touch of the hop aftertaste left behind. The mouthfeel is not thick, not thin like water. Leaves a thin film in the mouth. This beer goes down fast. I had two down very fast."
"Pours an amber color with nice white head and great lacing seen. Smells of citrusy hops and nice grassy notes too. Taste is very smooth. Starts kinda slow, but works into a nice bitterness and citrus hops flavors. Malts are well represented in this brew however as the beer is very nicely rounded out flavorwise. Nice lingering bitterness that works very well for this brew. Medium bodied with moderate ammount of carbonation. Very drinkable brew, solid all around offering again from Great Lakes. Definitly worth a try or two."
"A superior pale ale!"
"A nice Pale Ale with a floral and fruity hop aroma. The appearance was a nice amber gold with a good head on it. The taste was a good floral and fruity hoppy to match the aroma. This seemed like a particularly heavy pale and gave it a sticky mouthfeel that took away from the drinkability. Overall I'd recommend this pale to anybody who likes a good pale."
"This beer was a golden amber color. A heavy pour generated a frothy white head. The nose was subtle of hops with some fruit notes as well. Liek the aroma, the flavor was subtle with hops and had a smooth mouthfeel. Not much of an after taste and was a nice beer. I appreciated the label very much."
"The body is a metallic amber with a nice yellowish-white head that builds easily and lingers for a bit. The aroma is moderately hoppy and the flavor has a nice bit of caramel to supposed the bitterness. Theres just something about it that strikes me wrong. Its not bad, but Ive had APAs that I much prefer to this one. One of the few beers by Great Lakes that I dont like for the style."
"Really tasty, drinkable APA. And at $4.99 a six pack at my local beer store, really can't be beat!! I think it might be a mistake, but I'm going to tell them. Nice hoppy nose that is probably cascades. A fairly smooth taste with nice malt undertones. The beer's quite bitter, but flavorful as well. Nice cascade hop flavor. Very drinkable...I like it."
"Drinkability: Couldn't drink more than one of these. I like hops, but I also like other characteristics as well."
"This beer is superb. It's elegant and graceful enough to be paired with the fanciest foods, or a trusty sidekick while playing cards with pretzels and peanuts. One of the top 5 Pale Ale's brewed in the US, period. Had the pleasure last October to enjoy this and several other Great Lakes offerings - splendid craft brews. These guys really know what theyr'e doing."
"Nice golden color with a good head and nice chunky lacing. Hoppy with a trace of an orange scent. Pleasingly hoppy with a touch of citrus. Malts have the a say in the matter, but the hops definatly get the last word. Slightly sharp mouthfeel, with a little bit of a pucker to it. But this one is very easy to drink, a good beer after a lazy Saturday afternoon in front of the baseball game."
"Nice amber color with a dense foamy head. There was a very fine sediment throughout the entire glass but it did not settle to the bottom, it just hung motionless. The taste is very smooth with a wonderful, crisp hop flavor. This is, bar none, a wonderful pale ale, but I still have my top ten pales, and this one would probably be edged out."
"A 6%ABV, this one could be ahad in fairly quick succession, and if I'd only had more than one ..."
"And seperate cheers to tavernjef for sneaking it across the WI border for me!"
"D&N: Another awesome offering from Great Lakes Brewing Co. Tasty, easy to drink. Definitely a beer to try out."
"To make this perfect, a bit more citrus than fruitiness would be nice but I wouldn't change this too much."
"Coppery-honey gold hue with a slight haziness, the vaguely off-white head reached almost two fingers in height, the retention was very good; it slowly faded to a long lasting cap. However the lacing was a little spotty but still this is a lovely looking beer. Juicy citrus aromas charge ahead of the toasty-biscuit maltiness, there is also an occasional hint of floral, as a whole the bouquet is very inviting; it smells like a Pale Ale should. Good potency as well. The palate is tremendously tasty with a big bite of hoppy bitterness, juicy as well; I am impressed with the potency of the hops, why can more breweries make IPAs this good! It is true the hops steal the show and it is unbalanced in a blissful way but it must be noted that the maltiness is detectable, a little bit of toasty crackers and a hint of a caramel too. But seriously, this is a nicely hoppy Pale Ale. Yummy! It would be a stretch to say this is a complex beer but how many of this style are? The slight burn of the alcohol at the back of the tongue is charming. The mouthfeel is very sturdy, this might be the most impressive attribute of all the GLBC beers Ive had, medium/medium-full in body, natural modest carbonation. Appetizing aftertaste, it is making me yearn for a good cookout. Burning River is tremendously drinkable, this is a top-notch Pale Ale, easily one of the best APAs Ive had. I wish I had more. Thank you PhantomVodoo!"
"Taste is soft and well rounded, yet solid in body and feel to keep that charge of character going strong. And this is characterized in a gratifying presence of both a super nice toasty warm malt profile and pleasantly soft and milding hop balance that brings in refined and subtle layers of wood and dulled floral citrus; quite yummy...scratch that, very yummy! Feel is dead on for a pale, clean, soft, full, well rounded, yielding toasty malt warmth, smooth bite of bitterness and quaffable to the fullest. One hell of a pale!"
"IMHO: Better than many other American pale ales, but still a little over the top with the hops. A decent balance of flavors."
"Nice light-copper color, with a white head. Smells of sweet toasted malt, bread and citrus hops. Great taste of citrus, combined with a sweet malt. Preety good mouthfeel, not to thin. This is a great Pale Ale, that is very, very drinkable. Great session beer. Lucky for me, this is usually available in the area, so this is a good ""old reliable"". This is one beer that has never let me down."
"A 21 Gun Salute to BigHuge for this Battleship of a Pale Ale!!"
"This clear golden ale wears a medium sized off-whtie head, fully diminishing unfortunately. Aroma is not so pronounced, I expected a big cascade predominance. We rather face a complex hop blend that I'd describe as earthy, oily, spicy and bold. As it enters the mouth, it's a delight of ever evolving character. A good chunk of malt is always there literally dancing with the complex hops blend as described above in a perfect balance and harmony. The medium body never fails to support those intense sweet toasty cerealic citrus flavors. Medium carbonation. Overall, there's just something about this american pale ale that makes me feel like it's the best I've ever taken, I know you've had that feeling about some beers too:) Big props to ciderguy for this unique opportunity!"
"Comments - Thanks are in order to chilidog for sending this great brew my way during this years holiday exchange. If I could only get more of this great tasting beer around my area all would be right with the world."
"What an extrordinary brew. Wish this was available here in NJ as it would have a permanent spot in my fridge."
"A couple of thoughts. GLBC seems to be incapable of brewing anything but outstanding beer across a wide range of styles. After sampling three of their offerings, I'm convinced that they have absolutely nailed down head/lace and carbonation/mouthfeel. Lastly, this bottle had a 'best by' date of Sept. 18, '03, a full 3 months before I purchased it and 3+ months before this review. I detected no problems whatsoever."
"This bottle has an expiration date of Jan. 20, just 18 days away, maybe that accounts for some of the off-flavor notes."
"My compliments to Great Lakes."
"Pours light amber, with a large creamy off-white head that slowly diminishes, leaves great lacing. Aroma is of pale/bready malts, with a strong amount of cascade pine hoppiness. Flavor starts with some pale malts, a bit of woodiness, and finishes with a strong cascade hop presence. Medium-full body, dry, fairly bitter, very enjoyable."
"Copper hue with a slight haze. Lofty, pitted, persistent ivory white head leaves frothy, sparse lace. Balmy citrus dominated hop nose comprised of pink grapefruit and sweet lemon, with floral, nectar like tones secondary. Understated light lovibond caramel malt presence. Well rounded and appetizing aromawise. A transient, well baked biscuit note upfront in flavor fades quickly, yielding to a combination of mild toffee and candied lemon zest. Hop bitterness of a gentle nature leaps in mid palate, quickly drying the flavor profile. Leafy, lemon tea like hop flavors surface late, adding subtle earthy hints. Moderate in body, with the well calculated dextrin content lending a soft, lightly viscous mouthfeel. Finishes slightly sweet, with fleeting hints of sweet marmalade and grainy cracker. A tasty, fairly complex pale that remains light on the palate. Not as assertive in hop character as I remember, but very enjoyable and drinkable, regardless. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for reuniting me with this upper midwest staple."
"overwhelmingly citrusy, lots of carbonation bubbles, under a small head. Understated bitter finish to the citrus, and citrus in aroma. bit overcarbonated and lighter mouthfeel.A great summer beer.I have never had a bad brew from this brewery. This is the rerating after not having for 2.5 years."
"Initial taste of carbonation with hop surge. Subtle malt presence, but hops dominates the palate. Crisp finish to a extremely drinkable brew. One is simply not enough!"
"Some nice sweet caramel up front, followed by big orangey hop flavours. Straight forward & well done. Soft on the palate, with a somewhat creamy texture."
"Great Lakes puts out some great beers and this is no exception. I can't believe I've had this treasure in my mini-fridge for so long and just now got around to sampling it. I'll have to see how it tastes after 3 or 4..."
"Strong floral hop presence dominated by Cascades but I am sure their are other hop varieties present. Wonderful biscuit malt background highlights this excellently constructed beer. Great for a session. Truly the premier example of the style of the American Pale Ale."
"Color is a copper orange with a medium frothy head, nice lace. Ever so slight haze. Smell is citrus hop with a good malt presence. Very good taste. Hoppy as a pale ale should be. This one has some citrus - cascade perhaps. Nice malt and hop finish. Good mouthfeel - not to thick. Clean and crisp. Drinkability is better than average, not one that can be glugged on a hot day, but one to drink while playing cards or watching football on the tube. A very good beer for the style."
"This one poured a nice copper color with a frothy head that lasted a long time. The flavor shows a lot of strong hoppiness to this beer. It's upfront flavor is a citrusy hoppiness that has a bite to it. But it soon gets a little restrained by the biscuity malt base that keeps this one from being an IPA and also gives it that added dimension that makes this such a good beer. The hops show throughout the body and finish of the beer. Finish also has some yeasty spicyness that combines well with the hops. A very good beer."
"Has a big grapefruity smell and taste, almost like a wheat beer. The hoppy taste sublty changes as my cup warms up, to a more bitter aspect like an IPA. Excellent appearance and head for this style. I sampled this at a homebrew party among a sea of Oktoberfest beers, so this is a refreshing and welcome change of pace."
"2. I SWEAR this used to be labeled ""IPA," and not simply ""Pale Ale."" Did this change about the time Commodore Perry IPA was introduced? Just wondering. I wonder if that peculiarly American phenomenon of ""hop infaltion"" is at work."
"The Burning River is as good a pale ale as I've had, and every bit as good as Sierra Nevada. It pains a Pittsburgher to say this, but the Pale Ale is simply classic."
"Huge thanks to AKSmokedPorter for hauling this from Ohio to me."
" A great session beer for hopheads."
"I know this is a good beer, yet for me another overhopped, pine resin smelling beer, (very redolent of the sticky ""bud"" I've seen at local police anti-drug demonstrations) that wows then becomes boring. I don't find this sticky,cloying, almost sweet yet bitter, style of pale ale too overly amazing. To me this is more of an IPA tasting beer, and when I'm in the mood for a Pale Ale I don't want a darned IPA. Sorry Hop Heads-I don't mean to come off so bitter. Nice, yet not my favorite in the drinkability category."
"Orange hue, thin, soapy head, decent lacing. Citrus and floral hops on the nose, some maltiness also. A definitive hops dominated body, crisp, fresh fruit flavoring, mainly grapefruit and orange peel, some malty backbone. Medium bodied, clean, tasty, world class as to be expected from the Great Lakes team."
"Pours clear copper in color with a foamy white head. Aroma consists of grapefruit/citrusy hops. Medium to full-bodied. Mouthfeel has a nice creaminess to it that sharpens on the edges of the tongue. Burning River seems to reveal its flavor in two stages. The first has a nice malty and light fruitiness to it on the front. Then the beer takes an interesting twist. As indicative of the nose, the Cascade hops take over in the finish. Caramel and a piney bitterness conclude things. Flavor pushes the style of pale ale more towards that of an IPA. Intriguing beer for those who are fond of hops."
" A solid, hearty Pale Ale that I bet is even better on tap."
"Many thanks to 'Realale' for lugging this brew back from Michigan for me!"
"Medium weight in the mouth with a firm base of malt. Perfectly integrated hop flavor leads to a long, lingering well-balanced finish. Could be carbonated at a slightly lower rate to give an even silkier mouthfeel, but this is darn near perfect. Easily one of the best balanced, yet complex, beers I've had the pleasure of drinking. Outstanding."
"Originally sampled 10 November 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. Burning River is a nice example of an American Pale Ale. The upfront flavors are hoppy. This brew finishes with a slightly flavor. The color of the beer is golden/amber. This is a good session beer."
"This beer features a bubbly, concentrated off-white head which sits atop a clear bronze liquid. Nice lacing down the glass. Nose is a balanced mix of hops and malt, with more emphasis on the hops. This pale ale's taste is quite solid and fresh -- it's well-balanced with a strong hop presence followed up with what must be caramel malt holding everything into place. Feel is quite smooth overall, with just a touch of carbonation peeking through the surface. This is a very flavorful pale ale and is easy to drink. A very good effort from Great Lakes overall."
"This is what an American pale ale should be! Pours out a nice tawny yellow brown, followed by a bouquet of a aromatic hops in the off white head. At 65 IBU, this is a hop heads delight. The hops hammer you over the head at first taste, as the malt comes through ever so slightly in the finish. I was impressed with the aroma and taste particularly, as they were very closely connected. I could drink this all night, and if it weren't for the availability in my area, I would more often! A highly enjoyable summertime (or any other for that matter) brew that will appease any pale ale fan. Another victory for the GLBC!"
"I had this fine brew in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It comes out a light copper color that is only slightly hazy. There is 2 fingers of head that has pretty good retention and a slight bit of lacing. The smell is a rich hop aroma with some citrus. The taste surprised me because it tastes like an IPA, but is listed as a pale. Of course this isn't as hoppy as a ruination or a two-hearted, but ranks up there in IBUs. There are hints of citrus and pine with a good hops bite. This is super refreshing. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy and the drinkability is very nice. I would recommend this to a friend that thinks IPAs are a little too bitter."
"This beer pushes the pale ale envelope into the realm of an IPA. This is one great pale ale. When we were at the brewpub, they told us that their IPA had just ran out and was a big success. I would of loved to have tried it. This beer poured a deep golden color and was topped with a small cream-like head. Strong citrusy hop aroma with lemons leading the way. Taste was somewhat malty, dry grassy and bitter. Alcohol presence. A very flavorful and well hopped pale ale and overall an excellent beer."
"It's a deep copper color with a solid half inch head. The aroma allows for the conclusion that this is a pretty damn hoppy beer. Caramel malt pleasantly balances the assertive hops that provide a solid bitterness throughout and floral/crisp feelings. It's definitely more bitter than many other of the style I have tried. It's also very dry and crisp, great stuff here."
"Head is prodigious in size, creamy in structure, and a beauteous tan in color, as it erodes; the obviation by the lace is complete. The nose a mixture of sweet malt and some hop floral tones, crisp and fresh, a treat to this old schnozzle. Start is sweet and malt laden, the top I feel is middling, the finish smacking in its hop spiciness, moderately acidic, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste, and a fine drinking beer from a fine brewery."
"A quality beer that is worth seeking out. Another fine Great Lakes brew."
"GLBC rules - never a bad beer. This is an IPA look-alike in sheep's clothing. Kick-butt hopping, great look, and a fair nose. Lacing that sticks like glue all over the glass. I'm glad this one is shipped down state in bottles because is a real winner and Cleveland's too far away. Clear amber and off-white head. The taste is citrus at the start and finishes dry due to the great hopping. Super!"
"You have to love Great Lakes, when they make a beer this well balanced and drinkable. I raise one to them. It pours a copper amber with a slightly tan head very nice head retention. The aroma is chalk full of hops that create varying aromas such as citrus tones and pine cones. The flavor brings a lot of hop bitterness to the back of the tongue, very crisp clean finish. The malt just kind of surrounds the palate with warmth and of course the alcohol brings a nice tingling sensation. Awesome brew that I would partake in at any given opportunity. Us West Virginians are thankful to have access to such a fine brewer. Amazingly drinkable, could be one of my favorite pale ales of all time."
"Burning River: Very tasty beer, prominent malts and crisp tang o’ the hops. Reddish amber beer, thick head that lasted and lasted. Left some thick lace on the side of the glass. The aroma, unfortunately, not so much, kind of a dampish malt sack aroma. The taste, as previously noted, is extremely well balanced, and a very nice beer. Get out there, find this beer and buy it."
"Body is a deep copper with a slight red tint. Head is small and bright white. Aroma is attractive--floral with a citrus bite and tickle of pine. Flavor is much the same with a slight bite of grapefruit flavor. Very very drinkable. Medium-light body and light carbonation does not fill the stomach while flavor keeps the drinker yearning for another, and another, and quite possibily another."
"Overall, a great pale ale in a great line of beers from Great Lakes Brewery."
"I'll definetly have this beer again. Goes great with F&C!"
"Nice appearance with a slightly hazy orange-tinted amber that's capped by a foamy bone-white head. The head holds well and leaves some nice lace. The bouquet displays soflty sweet, caramelized malt over a mildly floral and gently citrusy hoppiness. A medium/full body and smoothly creamy mouthfeel accentuate the lightly toasted/caramelized malt while floral and citrus hop flavor and bitterness balance it out perfectly. Very well done. Although there's alot of malt going on in the mouth, it thins and dries in the finish, and yet still retains a light touch of malty sweetness at the tip of the tongue... really, really nice! This APA exhibits a slightly fuller malt than many examples, and maybe a touch less hop flavor and aroma, but it's all still there and balances exceptionally well. It offers a great amount of drinkability while still retaining a good amount of character! Very well done and well worth trying."
"Very clear amber, refuge head of an 1/8 of an inch of yellow skim. Cascadey-hop aroma. Nice and very solid grapefruit pith flavors early and to the finish, but with an excellent honey and caramel counterbalance. Some sense of light fruit as well. ""Out there"" but excellent flavor for an APA. This brew is first rate in balance, boldness, and drinkability. Would be my ""house"" beer if I lived in Cleveland -- a chewy and close match to Summit Extra Pale Ale on tap."
"Found on draught at the Old Bag of Nails pub here in Columbus. Pours a beautiful dark amber color with a medium thick foamy off-white head. Aroma is all hops baby. I was expecting the hops flavor to snap my head around even more than the bottled version but that was not the case. The flavor here was actually slightly more subdued, although it was served very cold. Either way this is still a killer beer."
"Another solid brew from Great Lakes. It pours a deep orange amber with an off-white head that maintains 1/2 inch throughout and leaves plenty of lace. Smell is predominantly hops...citrus, pineapple, and a bit floral. The taste is, again, mostly spicy hops with lots of grapefruit flavor but there is plenty of sweet malt for balance. Perhaps not as aggressively hopped as some west coast interpretations, but, unless you're a 'dyed in the wool' hop-head that's probably a good thing."
"This tasty pale ale pours with a deep copper color and thick foamy head wafting a HUGE spicy grapefruit aroma with a malty punch.  The initial bready sweet malt flavor is supported with a grapefruit citrus hop profile and an aggressive, but pleasant bitterness.  Very powerful and tasty.  The sharp bitterness flows through to the finish."
"I get into Cleveland on business frequently and I always stop in at Great Lakes. Their brews are consistently exceptional and the Burning River is among their best offerings. Nicely hopped but with enough toasty malt to keep it well balanced. Citrus aromas. Pretty copper color. Nice head. Nice lace. This beer ranks right up there with my other favorite Pale Ales (Hopdevil, Stone, Bell's, Hop Ottin, Barrel House, Three Floyds, Sierra Nevada). The convivial atmosphere of the brewpub doesn't hurt. One of the top five beer spots in America."
"This is a wonderful ale.  It has a deep copper color with a nice full head that dissipates slowly.  A very well balanced hop flavor with a touch of maltiness to round it out and a nosefull of flower aroma.  This is second only to Hop Devil in my opinion as far as ales are concerned.  Can't imagine ever passing on one of these.  Great Lakes Brewing creates some of the finest beers I've ever experienced."
"Now on with the rest of the review. This beer tastes _exactly_ like one would imagine a tea made from this wet snuff would taste like. I'm not talking subtle over or under tones here... smack bang exactly like the snuff. Both in smell and taste. I do recognize the quality of the beer, and I would generally enjoy a highly hopped beer like this. If I'd never tried the snuff it would've been fine I think. I tried to persist through the bottle, but it was just too much. The more I drank, the more it reminded me of the tobacco. The aftertase of the beer is exactly like when you accidentally swallow some of the snuff. Too bad... I had high hopes for this beer as I love other Great Lakes brews."
"A favorite among APAs.  I love this one."
"Rich copper color, fluffy tan head, lasted quite a while. Resiny, yummy hop bubbles bust through. Tough, nearly skunky smell, then yields to a heavy cascade hop nose. Taste was right in line with the style. Rich hoppy cascade bite. Sublte malt flavors balance nicely. Slightly watery feel near the end of the glass, other than that, no complaints. A very good American Pale Ale. Cheers to tjw5877 for sneaking this into the 6 pack of edmund fitzgerald porter he traded me."
"Gotta give my sis some credit for hauling this back for me on her trip to Pennsylvania."
"Tastes like a west coast pale ale to me..copper in color with a nice little creamy head...nose is citrusy...maybe a little pine needles on the nose too....the mouthfeel is nicely balanced....good maltiness supports the citrus hoppiness....very enjoyable and well above average..."
"Pours a nice copper color with classic notes. A good three-quarter inch head and nice lace. A bit of a bite to this hopped-up brew but still very smooth.Goes with anything on the grill."
"This beer poured out a nice light copper color.  Formed a nice off white head that left some nice lace.  Quite a bubbly beer, with an aroma of hops and some citrus.  Nice hoppy flavor that gives it a bit of bite in its finish."
"I picked this up when I took my daughter to Oberlin College for a weekend visit. It was the highpoint of the weekend since I was stuck in the motel on my own the whole time. It has that great hoppy bite that I love, but just a touch too bubbly for me. Brought another 6 pack back home to NY and dolled it out to myself over a couple of months. Haven't found it since. Bummer"
"Bubbly with small bleached head. Golden in color. Smelled vaguely like chaimpagne. A bit of orange along with the hoppiness."
"Tasty Pale Ale with a mild hop aftertaste.  Wonderful palate and flavor.  Definitely an ale drinkers ale."
"Pours an amber orange color with a white head. Plenty of hops and more hops, What can I say, I love it. This is a great example of a great style of beer, enough malt to balance things, but alot of hops. Another great beer from Great Lakes Brewing Company."
"Notes: Its funny, some breweries don't even brew their IPA this hoppy and/or strong. A BIG Pale Ale here with a great finish ... very impressive, one of the top pale ales I have tasted in a while."
"Nice hoppy flavor,not enough head though.But a well made APA,most of their beers are well made micros."
"An excellent pale. Highly hopped but balanced."
"You gotta love micro-brews. a nice pale ale."
