"Best session you can buy"

""
""
""
"One of the best sessions brews out there. . . Will be picking up several cases this summer at the brewery!!!"
""
""
"Nice easy drinking summer beer.  It is exactly what it claims to be,  a great beer for out on a boat on a hot day.  Good flavor, still ""sessionable."""

" This one isnt quite up there amongst the Zombie Dusts, Alpha Kings, Red Chairs, or Dale's of the world as a straight up Pale Ale, but at 1.5-2% lower abv or more than every other, it is in a league of it's own. I rated it straight up to style.  I would say 4.5+ if there were a sub 5%/ session category. After having this and  077XX, believe the Carton hype!"
"Would buy again and again if it weren't only available in NJ."

"Light and flavorful pale ale. A well done beer from Carton Brewing..."

"Had it on tap and I am not sure if the tap line was dirty or something was missing. Tasted crisp but lacked something other sessions I have had did not."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really citrus-y. Probably too much fo regular consumption. Personally, if I want a low ABV beer for summer, I'd rather go Wit or Weis"
""
""
""
"An incredible session beer. Love this stuff!"
"Overall a fine session IPA"
""
""
"Good lol"
""
"Bottom of the barrell, even for session beers. No-brainer drain-pour."
""
""
"Overall: I love this beer I wish I could have it every day in the summer. Clean flavors and very sessionable and lots of flavor. I think this is THE best session IPA I have ever had. If you can get this one, don't even think about it get it. Also, it comes in a tallboy can!"
""
"Thanks for the awesome extra Bob!  This one tastes like a full bodied IPA but could see myself easily drinking a few of these.  Hoppy and flavorful citrus.  This is the ideal session IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A true session IPA that doesn't trade flavor for lower ABV.  Intense grapefruit and citrus."
""
"Pale straw, fluffy white top. Lite hay, fresh grown grass, tangelo and mango. Great bitterness and clean finish. This really is a great fishing/boat beer."

"O: Great beer. The balance between the malt and hop character was spot on for my preference, the use of Munich made it interesting and the firm bitterness is something I don’t usually find in the session-IPA category."
""
""
"A well-hopped citric delight!"
""
""
"Packs a ton of flavor for a low ABV beer. A really nice surprise. I really enjoyed it."
""
"Founders All Day used to be my ""session"" beer, but Boat kills it in every way imaginable.   It has the crisp bite of All Day, but while AD kind of falls off after the initial flavor- Boat finishes so clean, you'll swear you're drinking a much higher ABV brew.    Simply outstanding offering from Carton."
""
" The taste iis tangy with lemony hop element and subtle acicidty in the taste with mild citrus golden grapefruit-like punch with somewhat herbal hop quality and grassy aspect with a light astringency level and dry finish. Overall this is better than most beers of this style but I would not want to drink more than 1 in a sitting a bit too assertive bitterness wise for the abv -pushed to the extreme in a way I am not fond of especially."
""
"Dank hops with a balance of citrus and bitter pine. Piney and grassy nose. Huge flavor. Thinness and ABV are welcome here. Great flavor at drinkable level."
""
"O:  Very good beer.  This one's a keep.  Bought a four-pack at the brewery after tasting it."
""
"Growler - pours cloudy pale golden yellow with a foamy white head.  The odor is strong, IPA, grapefruit, lemon, citrus, pineapple, passion fruit, floral, grassy, bread like.  The taste mild, bread like, herbal, grapefruit, passion fruit, honey, light bitterness throughout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just great, clean, crisp, juicy, and crushable.  Get it, drink it, and then drink more.  Another great offering from Carton!"

"Nice session APA. Not bursting with nose or taste, but you can only expect so much from this style. Very drinkable, good carbonation, refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nice session.  I'm not a boat person, but I could drink a few of these on dry land too."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good stuff. Kind of straddles the line between a pale ale and session IPA, so if that sounds like you're thing, then you should check this one out."

"Along with New Glarus spotted cow, a go-to for a sessionable beer. Definite bonus for the pounder cans."
""
"Doesn't smell like much, doesn't taste like much.  I guess it's okay if you want something sort of watery on a hot day, but there's much more flavorful beers to be had in the ""session beer"" arena."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was just a bit on the light side of medium, which would be a good thing for an all-day drinker of a beer. Drinkability was excellent, the beer was gone far too quickly, leaving me wanting more. Overall, a very fine beer. A must try, and one worthy of repeated drinks."

""

""
""
"O: Overall this is a great brew from Carton, this is a local brewery for me and proud that it comes from NJ, very well balanced beer and enjoyed it thoroughly. Great Flavors."
""
"Overall: this beer is total genius. Light, but hoppy, but not overpowering. Extremely refreshing and would pair well with a ton of foods. Fantastic anytime, but especially in the warm weather."
"Aroma was great, but in the end, the beer drinks a bit unbalanced with the heavy bitterness and lack of malt backbone, though I don’t dislike it. A very firm session ale. (3.25)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O -Fantastic, powerful flavor profile relative to the body.  This is a great session if you want something with big flavor! 4.25"
"Overall: Glad that I got to try this! I like boating and I can now confirm that I like Carton's boat beer. Next, I gotta drink this beer out on the fishing boat on a hot day! Love that this beer is canned. Carlton makes a good beer. Its a little hoppier than I would have expected a session beer to be, but its not overly bitter. No complaints here with a beer that has 35 IBU's."

""
""
""
"An outstanding session that drank even better on the Cape May beach."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's very refreshing. The beer reminds me a lot of Southern Tier Live or Bitter American. A very light malt pale ale with tons of citrus hops."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the most well-crafted beers I've ever had. It's the perfect combination of powerful flavor with a low ABV. I could drink this all day."
""
"Carton Brewing nailed this one; perfect summer session ale. Prefer it to Monkey Chased the Weasel cans, but both are delicious. Can't wait to try Carton's 077XX DIPA."
""
""
""
"Overall: Another well done session brew that fits summertime. I could have used a touch of brighter hops on the taste but everything else was top notch. A really well executed beer."

"O - A nice example of a session IPA; emphasizing the aroma and bitterness more than the malt. I like it. I had it the next day (while writing this review) side-by-side with a Fat Head's Sunshine Daydream, which I liked more, but it is 4.9% ABV and this is 4.2% ABV so it's not a head-to-head comparison. I'd say in this ABV range and session IPA style; it competes well with the best of them."
""
""
""
"Can from trade as an extra. Thanks! Pours hazy yellow with a tiny fizzy head that disappears quickly. Fresh lemon peel and onion hop aroma and very light pale malts. Flavor is light pale malts with a nice sweet citrusy hop character, some hay. Some juiciness. Pretty flavorful. Ther German influence is definitely there and it is almost like a super ultra hopped up pils, but finishes extremely clean. Light plus bodied with medium plus carbonation. Lost a couple points on appearance but this is good stuff."
""
""
""
"Pour is a haze pale golden yellow with a tight white head. Nose is extremely hoppy, tons of citra hops with a grapefruit and tropical punch and light pale notes. Taste is a clean blast of citra with a stronger grain presence. This has quite a strong hop punch, lots of grapefruit and pineapple, Well carbonated and fairly dry with a moderate bitterness through the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Picked up a 4-pack at Collier's in Cape May. The 16oz can poured pale with a slight haze and a short white head, it looks like witbier without the yeast mixed in. The aroma is spicy with big juicy hops The body is dry with a biting cracked pepper finish—so very drinkable and satisfying to a hop head. There are mild floral and fruit notes that slip into citrus rind. Overall, a great session beer, but be ready for dry hoppy goodness on par with an extra bitter saison."

""
""

""

"O- It's different from a session IPA, it has unique flavors, a slight German influence, lots of bitterness and a tart note. Drinkability is very good."

"O - I love this beer. This is a summer go to for me. The malt bill, mouthfeel and bright hop character come together perfectly to create an amazing session brew, well done!"
""
""
""
"Overall: a very tasty and drinkable beer. pushed the boundaries of a pale ale just a little bit and in a good way. some grassiness which i often find to be bad works for this beer."
""
""
"First brew I've tried from Carton and I'm impressed. Hope to see cans available in my area."
""
"Very well done brew. Easy to drink but still robust in flavor and aroma."
""
""
"As far as session IPAs go, this is tip-tops! On par with Stone Go To. I was sad when it was gone."
""

""
""
"Poured half the tall boy in a nonic pint and drank the other half from the can... Before cracking this open I had been drinking a couple of Mo's and was thinking this session ale wouldn't stand up.... Oh my Buddha was I wrong. This is the most flavorful and aromatic table brew I've ever had. I'm so taken back by how flavorful this is I can't write a proper review. Sorry Founders All Day...your spot in my fridge is reserved for this jersey girl."

"Overall a tasty, über hoppy session IPA."
"O - Excellent session ale, I was so stoked when I seen this was on the board at Ho1kB. Legit stuff."
""
"Boat. Simple as it gets. Let's give it a whirl. Popping the tall boy, I get a grapefruit hop waft, almost West Coast-like. But wait this is East coast. Pours to a bright slightly cloudy yellow with a bright white head. On the taste this brew has a good semi bitter hoppiness right off the bat. Very similar in taste to an ESB. Taste continues with a balanced middle then a semi bitter aftertaste. Not a bad brew. Simple as the name states, potentially a session brew as well as it packs good flavor for a 4.2% AC. For what it is it is decent and not at all offensive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. At times it feels a little watery but its to be expected I suppose. Overall easy drinking and something I could effortlessly put down as it gets warmer out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-I have wanted to try this one for a while. It did not disappoint. I wish it was distributed in my area because I would buy these all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a crazy amount of aroma, flavor hops, and malt depth for a 4.2%abv beer that only claims 35ibus, which drinks light years beyond. The alcohol feels alot bigger in perception, the hops are potent, american citrus flowery hops. Advertised as a session ipa, labeld a apa, this brings a ton of respect for the session <5%abv then most beers much bigger. The bitterness and flavor aspect is very strong and good, seemingly getting stronger as the drink goes on. Keg/case worthy, a session that drinks like a strongly hopped ipa. If this is a session, then im sold."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Small bubbly head fades rather quickly. Body is very hazy pale straw. Aroma is very dry hoppiness with accents of lemon skin, bitter dry greens, and mostly dry grapefruit. Flavor is a strong bitter grapefruit with a long bitter and dry finish. Malts are cracker and white bread. Perfectly in the background. The beer is super light and so easy to drink. The bitter aftertaste gives heft to the beer. Its really nice, just so easy to put down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-interesting beer, good flavors that have some suggestion of a Kolsch, enjoyable and easy drinking"
"Really, the only thing i didn't like is the can. I would have never bought it without Trish's recommendation. I'd be interested to see how other folks feel about this particular brew."

"Poured a little into a glass just to see the bod. Pours a clear bright yellow with a white film of head. Smells of moss, grapefruit, mild sweet honey. Tastes of grapefruit, wet grass, hop bitterness jumps in and beats up the palate, and the beer finished mostly clean with light sweetness lingering. Light bodied with medium carbonation. A great, easy-drinking beer. A go-to for all occasions."
""
""
"Overall: This is a fantastic brew. I love it, and I think most who try it would. I, however, am unsure if it supports the price. I will have to evaluate further, and compare to similar brews. This is by far the hoppiest APA I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"16oz. can courtesy of Ineedabeerhere (thanks Joe!). Served in my Harpoon IPA glass. Pours a translucent straw gold with a loose, half-inch bright white head that dissipates into a soapy froth. Tropical fruits and grapefruit notes are evident off the pop. Once in the glass, there's a hint of pine, followed by a slight yeast presence and some cereal grains; however, the fruit character drops off a bit. Taste is not as bright as the nose - citrus, noble hops and light, toasted malts, with some residual bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light with a lively, almost prickly carbonation and mild acidity. Overall, a great session APA, although I have to say that I enjoyed this on draft a little bit more."
""
""
""
""
""
"First impression is that themuthfeel is a bit fizzy approaching seltzer. Taste begins with a bready sweetness and turns bitter with a nice floral and citrus flavor. Finishes with a bitter hop bite. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Good for a hot summer day and enjoying a few. I like the move by some breweries to offer lower alcohol beers that are full on flavor, but they can be difficult to make with less to hide behind."
""
""
""
"Hazy golden-yellow pour with a small bubbly head that fizzled down to a ringlet, leaving a few specks of lacing on the glass. Pretty surprising blast of hops in the nose, citrusy, piney, crisp. For a 4.2% brew, this really had a lot of flavor, and the hop profile almost pushed it into IPA territory IMO. Citrus pith, lemon and orange, pine needles, floral notes, crisp bitterness that didn't turn foul in the aftertaste. Body was light-medium, mouthfeel was snappy and dry, carbonation was moderate. Simple and flavorful. I could see this being an everyday beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium body wih tight carbonation and a crisp, spicy hop bite that lingers over the pale malts into a dry finish.  Bitter and spicy with grassy hops and pine needle along with pepper and corianders.  This is countered by a pale malt backbone with hints of bread yeast, biscuit and light fruit.  Kind of tame and flavors seem a bit off to me.  Feels more like a Belgian golden/pale ale with zesty spice and bland hop character.  A lot of people who's palates I trust really like this beer so I'd like to give it another try at some point but my first impression isn't a very good one.  "
""
""
"It has a hoppy, grapefruit aroma. It has a clean mouthfeel with a blast of hops going down your throat. Just a great overall beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fantastic pale ale in its own right, especially if you like your pale ales on the juicy, citrusy side. When you factor in that it's only 4.2% abv, it becomes even better--""boat beer"" is a fitting name because this seems like the perfect beer to bring out on the boat to relax."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: if this were more readily available it would be my go to session ale. I much prefer this to the popular all day ipa from founders. With the cult following Kane has in nj Carton deserves almost as much love as they are not too far behind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Incredible beer. I've always been one for the american pale ale, and now their is a suitable replacement to my lifetime love of sierra nevada pale ale. At first it looks like a cloudy, golden, bluemoonish swill, but my mind is completely switched away from the look of the beer centimeters before i press the glass against my lips. The aroma punches your nostrils with pine and citrus. The taste... completely refreshing and hoppy. I'm just happy to have this at my local watering hole"
"Re-rated, this beer is amazing period!"
""
"This past month they made that Happen with their boat beer. I always enjoyed boat beer but it was never my first pick I would always go home with a Sally of something else. Never the less I was really excited to purchase my two case limit and get to drinking. So glad I did, Boat out of a can is simply amazing, it has become my favorite beer hands down. I wouldn't just be saying that I have a steady supply of heady topper, but this takes the cake. BOAT IS KING, the cans themselves are really awesome as well... When they are available don't hesitate head over and grab them, but expect to be standing in line right behind me."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have had many session beers and one that blows me away every time is Boat. It gives you strong IPA flavor that keeps you coming back pint after pint or in my case, can after can. A must try and rivals some of the best like Day Time from Lagunitas and All Day from founders."

""
""

""
""

"A super tasty beer for being such a low ABV. Still has great hoppyness and it is super crisp. One of my new favorite summer session beers. The smell is great! It has this, very aromatic quality to it. Carton has made another masterpiece. Good work boys! One of my top APA's. A great beer."
""
""
""
"Pours clear golden color, see through ring of white foam topper. Strong citrus rind nose. Hints of rye in the mix. Lingering bitter at the conclusion. Light flavor jabs, and then hop hits hard at the end. Unbalanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"medium bodied, medium carbonation, big hops all over the palate, grassy, bitter bite all the way down. super drinkable @ 4.3."

"Overall: A nice session IPA; very refreshing"
""
""
"O: Overall the flavors and smells of this beer intensify as it warms up, there is a really pleasant hop profile to this beer that I find really enjoyable. This one is quite easy to drink and I will be gladly having it again the next time I come across it."
"This one was served in a chilled Dos Equis pint glass at the Firewaters in the basement of the Tropicana on the AC Boardwalk. Not exactly the most optimal verssel in which to present this beer, but despite this, I really enjoyed the beer.it is lighter in complexion than most IPA's, but it comes off with a most agreeable, citrusy mouthfeel. A solid white head maintains throughout sippery. An exceptional hop profile lingers after every sip. A very good beer. Nice to find in such a beer wasteland asAtlantic City."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This might be my new favorite session beer. Nicely hopped without hitting you over the head. Just plain smooth and easy to put back while delivering that hop punch you seek."
""
""
""
""
"This is a unique and refreshing beer, and my first from Carton Brewing. Thumbs up for creativity and following through in executing a full-bodied, sessionable beer. Eager to try more from them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the low abv makes this the most poundable beer I've ever had in my life. Close to Kane OverHead in that regard"
"M- Mouth puckering hoppy goodness with you wanting nothing more than another sip...and with a modest ABV of 4.4%, go ahead and have some more! This is, without question, my favorite session beer...aroma and flavor is will make anyone a fan of hoppy, citrus-forward beers seek this one out...very well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is extremely flavorful for such a light-bodied beer. If you like lots of hop flavors, it could be sessionable given the low alcohol content."
""
""
"First sip surprisingly choppy. Thought it was an ipa before I read sstyle here. Citrus flavor dominates and this finishes extremely dry. A very nice surprise but don't think it matches apartment style. Good beer nonetheless."
""
""
"A tasty, easy drinking sessionable pale ale. Grab a growler for a hot summer day."
"Cheers!"
"O - I love this stuff. Easily the best Session IPA, Session Pale, or whatever you want to call it that I've ever had. Go To is pretty damn good too, but I think the sweetness of it almost gets in the way of things. Boat is simple. Not too hoppy where you get worn out but hoppy enough to keep things interesting over a session. Great beer."
"Appearance is yellow, slightly orange with a bright white head. Its` nose is pine, hops and citrus. The taste of the boat ale is easy, sweet, a good dose of citrus hops. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp, a bit dry in the finish. First time trying anything from Carton, a pretty good beer."
""
"o - Overall my second beer from Carton and another winner. A very hoppy, but easy to drink APA bordering IPA, and lots of nice citrus hops and orange. While I think I prefer 077XX to this, this might be a little easier to have a few of, and I look forward to having it again."
"O. Very good session beer. Nice and relaxing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably my favorite NJ beer and definitely my favorite NJ beer under 5% abv. Kudos to Carton Brewing!"
""
"They have this beer on tap at Trinity restaurant in Keyport, NJ. It pours a fizzy yellow color with minimal head, leaving behind faint lacing on the glass, its arromatics are comprised of a yeast and citrus undertones, its mouthfeel is somewhat carbonated but it does not hurt the complex subtle flavors of this excellent session beer."
""
""
"Overall, worthy of a try due to its uniqueness."
""
""
"Updated review for their canned version (first batch). Have had it on tap, growler, at the brewery, and now in can form. Love this beer."
"Finish is dry and thin with a fittingly low carbonation. This beer is extremely drinkable and well made. Besides this beer and some pale ales I've homebrewed, there isn't much else like it. I'd like to see more."
""
"It could be a touch drier and crisper in the finish, but overall this is a great addition to the growing Monmouth/Ocean County beer scene. I look forward to getting growlers of this to bring to the beach in the summer."
""
"**thanks Joe!"
""
""
"O-what a great beer. I will buying more and more of this."
"Carton Boat pours a very hazy lemon yellow, with about a finger and a half of white foam sitting atop the beer. The head lazily makes its way down the glass, leaving plenty of nice lacing left behind. The nose is a wonderfully fruity citrus bomb. It's redolent of Amarillo hops, and surprisingly pungent. It actually took a little bit of effort for me to pull my nose out of the glass and get down to drinking. There's a bit of cracker malt sweetness leading things off, before all those hops from the nose come barreling through. All the grapefruit and mango promised by the nose is delivered, but the bit of bitterness that floats through mid-palate is just a touch oversized to me. The mouthfeel is nice, light bodied with a subtly bubbly carbonation. Carton's Boat is a very welcome addition to the local scene (especially at $5 a pint), as this mashup of a Kolsch and APA is a mostly successful one."

"This is certainly a beer that will convince you that you can brew a complex beer without all of the extra alcohol."
"Overall: An incredible beer. I wish that they would bottle or can this. I would drink a lot of this in the summer."
"My biggest issue with beer was the cloudiness, until I realized that this beer had been inappropriately categorized by whoever added it as a kolsch. That's been changed and i guess an APA is closer. The color is nice and light and the head is pretty high and frothy."
"Looking forward to seeing Boat on tap at the Atlantic Highlands Yacht Club."
