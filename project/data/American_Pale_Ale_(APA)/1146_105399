3.8,5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 10/22/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, apple, light pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/earthy hops and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, apple, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Good amount of pine and earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange peel, apple, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity, balance, and robustness of citrus/earthy hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and a light lingering bitter astringency after the finish; but not too bad. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good pale ale style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of citrus/earthy hops and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

What I got in return was a beauty of APA. From it's near perfect lacing and deep copper to the floral yet a dash citrusy nose, this was setting up to be a nice treat. Taste followed the nose in that the floral nature came shining through with just a hint of spice. Maybe a tiny blast of tart trying to peak through the otherwise very well balanced malt profile. Finally, no cloying sweetness or lingering "off" bitterness in an amazingly dry finish. Excuse me now while I plan my trip back to TW to get more of these. Seriously, nice unexpected awesomeness from GI","gopens44","Jan 07, 2015"

Could barely finish Goose Island's Ten Hills Pale Ale, with every sip becoming harsher and harsher in terms of flavoring. Perhaps I'm just not one for these kinds of beers, however, I can at least appreciate that more time, effort, and labor goes into these than your average macrobrew. As usual, I'm stuck at the corner of admiration and recognition rather than actual appreciation.","SteveJeremy","Jul 12, 2014"

The taste brings in more of the same, the pine kinda blunt, but still mild enough to the point that it doesn't matter. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a decent little pale ale, nothing to write home about at all, but it's drinkable.","TMoney2591","Beers"

My guess is what little were there to begin with were drown out by the over powering herbal hop notes. Personally when I go for a APA (which I like very much) I wish to have quite a bit of citrus hop flavor in it. Secondly I am extremely disapointed to see this beer was bottled in Baaldwinsville NY, when named for a classic Chicago neighborhood (I live a couple hours outside the city, I would expect a local brewery to brew a local beer? )","Rosstheboss","Feb 05, 2014"

You can chug like a lighter color/pale beer, or sip like brown/darker brews. The taste was the highlight of the beer. Packs enough pine and citrus to be labeled a full on IPA rather than pale ale. The addition of caramel, brown sugar and bready tastes make this a unique, multi-layered beer. I can see Ten Hills Pale Ale becoming a year-round offering.","shacawgo24","Jan 26, 2014"

Some grapefruit and citrus rind sweetness cutting through the bitterness along with caramel, toffee, light fruit, bread and biscuit. Only 6.2% but there's noticeable boozy heat in the finish slightly taking away from the hop flavors.

This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, clean, crisp, not filling, but the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention and I could see myself getting bored with it so I think one would be my limit. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both pretty nice and true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the kind of generic hop flavor and the high amount of sweetness in the aroma, I think those were the two weakest points of this beer. I don't think I would buy this beer again, I might order a pint to go with food, but I don't think I'll be stocking up on this Limited Release and I can't say I would recommend it as Good American Pale Ale, but it's not a bad beer. All in all I thought this this beer fell right in the middle of the style, it wasn't bad and there wasn't anything offensive about it, but it wasn't memorable to me and it didn't have anything that made it stand out.

Whenever I purchase a Goose Island product I feel like I am really indulging in a craft brew, yet they technically are a macro brewery in lieu of ownership. Nonetheless, this beer, like most Goose Island products, really pulls it off. The appearance is a dark orange that leaves decent lacing, and the aroma is malty and bitter, just like the taste. It tastes like a standard I.P.A.(Stone, Alaskan ect) with extra malt and bitterness. The carbonation is electric, and yet it finishes smooth. This beer is not up to par with Honker's or Sofie, but if you are craving a pale ale with some pronounced bitterness, this is a great choice, as the price is definitely fair.","Isrealite","0"

Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and slight nail polish remover aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and slight herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Pours a deep copper amber hue with a big khaki light tan head, forms fine intricate lacing with more than ample head retention going on. Aroma has citrus notes, with a hint of sourdough bread...dig deeper and I get some earthy pine hop notes as well. Flavors hit middle of the road mainly muddled malts with an earthy, pine, slightly citric hop accent. Not quite an orchestra of hops like I was hoping more of another muddled hard to pick out hop character, by the way this batch was brewed in Baldwinsville, NY versus in Chicago. At least the labels are honest, I've found Oktoberfests and Harvests brewed and bottled at both locations. It's a hoppy beer yet it's hard to distinguish the cohesiveness of these darker caramel malts and these hops from Elk Mountain Farms, definitely solid and sessionable and will be shared at the party we are hosting tomorrow night. However, I want more expressive hops in my pale ales, especially when the label is as green and littered with as many hops as this label expresses. Mouthfeel has a slight resinous feel with ample carbonation, yet something is off...I'm having a hard time expressing what it is I don't care for but it's lacking something.","WVbeergeek","Dec 07, 2013"

The pine comes on fairly strong on the flavor and has a strong bitterness by midpalate. The finish leaves some malty notes with caramel coming through. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with light body.
