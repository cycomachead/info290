"Strong citrus smell, a cloudy orange colored delicious beer, now bring on king sue"
"Probably the best American pale ale I have ever had. Full, rich, smooth, and clean. Moar!!!"

"Great complex brew. One of my favorites. Smooth delivery. The hops and citrus are an excellent blend!"

"Had fresh, out of the bottle. The sweetness from the tropical fruits come through and a larger note from the grapefruit, the citra really shines here. Great beer!"

"Enjoyed at Hunahpu's Day 2015 at Cigar City Brewery in Tampa"

"Have you had a beer with citra hops?  well this is a good example.  Generally cloudy which warrants a demerit but flavor and aroma are strong."
""
"Lives up to the hype. Thanks to Justin for sending this. Pours a hazy, cloudy yellow with a two finger head. Aroma bursts with pineapple, mango, apricot, and especially grapefruit. Taste is an explosion of the same. Carries a bitter bite all the way through. Amazing beer considering the low ABV."

"Poured from 22oz bottle, pale orange, largely clear. Foam settles to nice film. Smell is amazing: grapefruit, piney, bit of apricot and mango. Taste follows suit with citrus and mango. Mild malt on back end fading crisp and clean. Feel / carbonation is spot on. Lives up to the hype-my clear standout from a pale ale tasting that included other TG offerings and those from other breweries. Wish I could drink this much more often!"

"Solid and flavorful but nothing particularly remarkable. For a light and tasty pale ale, it's hard to top this."
""
""
""
""
"Lots of similarities to Kern River Brewing Citra double ipa"
"Chase this one and get as many as you can."
"This is a pretty good beer."
""
""
"Wish the aroma was more like the taste"
"Hopefully the beer I drank was from a bad batch. I'm a fan of a citrus beer but this was horrible! I've only poured two beers down the drain because I couldn't finish them and this was one of them. The other beer I poured down the drain was a strong German Eisbock. The first drink of this beer wasn't horrible, grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit and some more grapefruit. There was some hop bitterness on the aftertaste on the first drink but nothing crazy. As I continued drinking this beer the grapefruit was becoming so intense and obnoxious it wasn't enjoyable at all. The aftertaste was very funky and long lasting. I have no idea how this beer is ranked 100!! I bought two bottles to share with two of my friends and neither of them could finish it as well. I was so excited to try this beer and it was a total failure in my book. It's hard to say because this is a loved beer by many but this is one of the worst beers I've drank. I'm going to give it another shot, maybe in the brewery."
""
"Tastes of wet grass, guava, and almost too ripe cantaloupe. Not bad"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one lives up to the hype.  A big grapefruity, citrusy APA.  The beer this one reminded me most of is Sculpin.  If you want a pale ale that tastes like a Sculpin, get this.  Perhaps the best apa/ pale ale I have ever had."
""
"Pours a cloudy orange with a finger of white head. Huge aroma of citrus, tropical fruit and resin. Tastes of grapefruit, oranges, mango and evergreen. This is super juicy. Medium light mouth with good carbonation. It's not your typical pale ale, but it's great."
"My general impression is that this beer is either older, or may have some sort of issue because my experience isn't jiving with any of the other reviews I have read after typing most of this. It reminds me of a Zombie Dust that is 3 or 4 months old. Just kind of flat. Someone else even noted that it pours clear. Mine looks like a hefe. Very good, but my gut feeling is something isn't right."
""
""
""
"Leaves that I've never been able to place, but it's fkn great. I digress. Bottom line.... ""Drink it. It's good """
"This is one of the best Citra beers around."

"O-I would love for this beer to be available to everyone all the time. but for now, ill take it any time i can get it."
""
""
"Hazy golden orange, Smell busting of mango, pineapple. Taste cantaloupe, citrus, banana, very little ""dankness"" or bitterness, but it does have that ""grassy"" after taste that I've noticed in other Toppling Goliath beer. Top notch beer"
""
"Such a balanced APA...never a let down"
""
""

""

"O: A fantastic take on the American Pale Ale that, nevertheless, I found a bit on the thin and ""session ale"" side for my liking."
"An excellent example in a class full of excellent examples...my meager ( but growing ) knowledge of proper beer tasting limits me...It's amazing..."
""

"Lives up to the hype for sure. Wow"

"Better than ZD in my opinion.  Absolutely loved the mango/citrus on this one.  Will be trading for this again soon!"
""
""
""
""
"One of my all time favorites.."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"O:  Great Beer.  Maybe even reason enough to go to Iowa."
""
""
""
""

"Just not understanding the hype, this is very average."
""
""
""
""
"This is probably the best APA I've ever had."
"Shared this last night during superbowl party and it was great.  After couple drinks of this really got the mango flavor, hope to enjoy again soon."
""

"Overall, we are ecstatic to finally be able to report the findings from our expedition to observe this whale…errr…dinosaur in its natural habitat.  What an experience!!  In all seriousness, this is a phenomenal beer that deserves all the hype it gets.  For us it doesn’t quite dethrone the likes of Zombie Dust in the area of the American Pale Ale, but it comes damn close.  From the first whiff through that first sip you are wrapped up in a world of insanely juicy, dripping wet citric hoppiness that offers just the right amount of sweetness and bitterness to the last drop.  If anything, the mild lightness of feel held the beer back from being the best, most invigoratingly flavorful experience it could have been, but here we’re just talking about why it isn’t “perfect fives” across the board.  Nit picking, if you will.   We obviously had to pick up a growler of this gal, and savored it, as incredibly hard as that was, over the next couple of days on our journey across the frozen Midwest.  PseudoSue is the best we’ve tasted from Toppling Goliath, and an absolute must-try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, Sue is a great beer. Worth the hype? I'm not sure. Delicious but very simple. Minimal malt backbone for an APA. TG's  Light Speed is better in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like a delicious fresh adult grapefruit Juice. Light and refreshing."
""
"M - Reminiscent of standing in line at Hill Farmstead with a few tasters, you could throw this right in the middle of the taster and be none the wiser. Perfect, resinous without being sticky and bitter. Lingers with sweet floral hops."
""
"A good beer no doubt, but not sure if it's worth the current rep it has, or if this is really worthy of even being a bomber beer.  Would love this in 12oz for fishing or pool.  Poured from a bottle at a beer share."
""
""
"Clear golden color, not one bit of haze.  Aroma, is wheat, straw, lemon zest.  THe hops were not as apparent, but this is a well balance pale ale.  It has a crisp taste to it, with some sweetness.  Reminiscent of honey and melon.  Overall, this was an enjoyable pale ale.  Not quite the hop bomb like I have had in the past, it was something different for me."
""
""
"Beer is really balanced but i think it mutes the hop flavors a tad too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden with a nice half finger frothy white head. Lemon zest, pineapple, wet hops, and a good dose of dank in the nose. The flavors bring in very similar qualities of Three Floyds Zombe Dust , perhaps a hybrid of, once again, Three Floyds Alpha King and Alpine Nelson based on their underlying effects. Burst of dank hops, orange, melon and some honey sweetness from the malts to balances this beer out. There is a slight bitterness in the back finish which brings this a bit more closer to an IPA rather than a pale ale. In addition to the creaminess, there is a medium body to this. Overall, a very fine pale ale - if not the best I've had in a while."
""
"More balanced than a straight Citra monster.  Crisp floral beginning followed by mango, passion fruit, and orange.  Opened up as it warmed as, in my opinion, the tap room serves everything a bit too cold."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite beers and available right here in Eastern Iowa. Great with the single hop, Citra. Delicious and always hits the spot. I prefer it on a clean tap, but the the 22oz bombers are just as good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Incredible. Amazing how much flavor is packed into this relatively light bodied (and low ABV) beer. Super luscious in the mouth. A mango, Citra dream. Instant top 3 pale ale, along with Trillium Galaxy Dry Hopped Ft Point and Tree House Julius!!!"
"Did a side-by-side blind tasting against ZD... -  this is the Zombie killer!"
""

"This is my go to APA!  Great beer at a reasonable price...if you can find it :)"
""
"O: Oh, how I've waited to drink this APA.  I'll stop short of saying it's the best (blindfold me and I'm pretty sure Born Yesterday will triumph), but this beer warrants the accolades it gets.  This is easy drinking tastiness that shows a deft hand in the fermentor.  Not bitter by any regard, but booming with hop character."
""
""
""
""
"I love citra hops but I just didn't really get them in this beer, it was mostly wheat flavor throughout. Great citra smell, just didnt come through to the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an excellent brew. A lot of flavors crammed in there!"
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with light orange tint. Smells of grapefruit, sweet malts. Tastes of grapefruit, bready, sweet malts, honey, and floral. Medium/full body and med carbonation. For a pale ale there was no shortage of flavor. Excellent beer an I will trade for it again."

"This is a winner, just like the Blackhawks 4 -0 over the Maple Leafs.  Well done on both counts!"
""
""

""
""
""
"This was an outstanding beer.  The Mango and Citra hops come thru so incredibly well and they work together in this way I'd never imagine.  Truly incredible/interesting taste."
""
""
""

"Smells like papaya & tangerine. Bitterness is low to moderate with layered tropical fruit and citrus. Super juicy. Would bang again."

"Overall: This is a world class beer and is worth the ratings it has received. I think i liked the ZD just a bit more, but barely. Had I not drank them one after another they would probably have blown my mind, and truly my mind is blow, to have the opportunity to try these beers one after another and both be fresh. I have to give a big thank you to my trader friend from Iowa who got these to me. Cheers man! Top notch beer, no doubt, if you can find it get it!"

"O- This was definitely a treat.  I had high expectations and the beer certainly delivered what I wanted.  This was the most enjoyable single hopped beer I've had to date.  Highly recommended and you won't be diasappointed.  Citra is one hell of a hop and TG blended it smoothly with their malt choice."

"Beautiful beer, aroma is full of Tropical fruit and citrus, taste is very smooth, lots Fruit, citrus, and some earthy hop notes, with slight hints of malt backing it all up, no bitterness at all. this is a beer that is sure to please Newbs to hoppy beers and seasoned beer drinkers. if i had access to it i'd by it all the time."

"Bright, golden color. Very little head. Bright tropical fruit aroma. If they made a car air- freshener based on the aroma, I'd buy it. Taste is fantastic. Mango and similar tropical fruits, a little pineapple, not bitter at all. Very clean and smooth. Extremely drinkable. This is the type of beer you judge others of the same style by. You go out o of your way for a beer like this."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Simply one of the best beers out there."
""
""
""
"EDIT: As this beer warms it is getting more vegetal on both the nose and palate. Not sure if this is normal or if I have a bad bottle. Not undrinkable but not great either. 3.75 Rating"

"I really liked this beer.  I was expecting something over the top but found a really well balanced mellow beer with just the right amount of acidity from the hops being mellowed by the malt additions."
""
""

"An outstanding beer, obvoiusly, though it's hard to think of this as an APA.  Whatever, this is terrific stuff.  Very, very impressive."

"Just FYI... My first 5/5 beer"
""
""
""

"O:  A fantastic Pale Ale balanced like one in the bitterness department but with way more aroma and flavor from the hops. The vegetal character I was getting is the only thing I didn’t care for in the beer. I would have liked to have known the bottling date on this thing too! It was from a cooler and I drank it the same day I got it.. not sure I could have drank it fresher. Hopefully that vegetal flavor isn’t the norm."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It is a great pale ale. It drinks more like an IPA. A big thank you to Fargrow for the opportunity to try this one."

"Bottle. Cloudy burnt orange pour with a white head. Grapefruit hop aromas. Crisp, clean, and dry with pleasant hoppy bitterness. Grapefruit notes dominate with just enough of a malt backbone to keep the ale honest. Citrus and dank pine undercurrents. A nice easy drinking pale ale. Another solid beer from TG."

"There is no question that this is not only my favorite beer of the year alongside many others, but this one has just been an incredible staple all year long. It has all of the beer components nailed. The citra hop really shines in this beer. The wonderful marriage of subtle sweetness, and a citrusy punch gives this beer great balance. Notes of citrus and cantaloupe just make this beer sing. This is World Class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This time I bought a bomber that was freshly delivered today. Night and day. Awesome fresh hop smell. The taste is so much better too. When I had it on tap the first time at BBQ Brickhouse, it had a lemon pledge taste. Now its just nice citrusy greatness."
""
"My biggest 'want' finally goes down the ol' gullet! Pours a slightly hazed yellowy-orange color with a tight, white head. Soft lacing. Aroma is very unique. I got a big whiff of garlic and green onion along with some mossy aromas and a bit of cattiness. Melon and mango as well. I know this is Citra but in the nose, the hop comes off differently and I love it. The flavor legit blew me away. Each sip made me say ""wow"" even louder. The green onion and garlic and cat and hemp is more subdued than the nose. Instead, I get a huge rush of tropical fruit. I've had plenty of Citra brews but this one is very distinguished. It has lots of tropical fruit but the flavor of honeydew melon is so damn rich. Very grassy. I also got a minty flavor that put this one over the top for me. Unlike any other Citra brew I have tried. The body is just hovering around medium. The carbonation is lively. The bitterness isn't too bold but it pricks up quickly. I have had a few from Toppling Goliath and all I have tasted have been phenomenal. This one exceeded my ridiculously lofty expectations. One of the best beers I have had. Enjoyed via bottle."

"T: Yeah, it's over. This beer is ridiculous. Tons of mango and pineapple upfront with some insanely smooth malts blanketing everything. Pink grapefruit flesh, a flash of pine and resin and then a smooth finish with pine and mango. The finish lingers forever, but never leaves you with any kind of bitterness. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
""

"The beer is transparent and golden with a quarter inch of off-white head. Big aroma of pine trees, resin, citrus, grapefruit, melon. Lovely. Super smooth on the palate with an elegant silky bitter finish. Tropical fruit and pine resin. Really fresh and delicious. Super easy to drink with very little alcohol presence. Delicious."

"RATING: 4.8/5 Zombie Heads!"
""
"Pours a clear light amber color with a small white head. Strong Citra hop smell. Very fruity and citrusy on the nose. Mouthfeel is weak and somewhat watery. I have to say I expected more after the hype and this beer's 100 rating. It's not bad for a 5.8% abv beer but I really thought this would be on par with Zombie Dust. Not even close."
""
""
""
""
"A cloudy honey pour with an attractive sudsy head. Great lacing on this one. A citrus hops nose, but also a little bread/yeast. The nose is repeated at first taste, and there seems to be heavy malt notes. Low bitterness. This was tasted head-to-head with Zombie dust, which I still prefer. Sue did not seem as we'll balanced. Still a great beer however."

I wouldn't put this on the same level as Hoppy Birthday, ZD, or Daisy Cutter, but would put it on that second tier of great hoppy pale ales with some stuff I've had from Trillium, HF, and Tired Hands. A great beer with nice citrusa nd tropical fruits, and crazy easy to drink. A top 10 pale ale for sure, highly recommended."

"Bomber from trade. Huge thanks! Pours clear golden with a hint of orange and a beautiful creamy fluffy white head. Aroma of big Citra hops, pineapple mango grapefruit, grass and piney notes, sweet honey. Oh yes. The flavor. Oh my god. Lightly sweet maltiness with massive pineapple mango hop presence, very light bitter. Some super raw hop vegetal notes. Juicy and resinous, easy going, medium plus carbonation , lightly dry finish. Oh my lord. I got goosebumps when this first hit my lips. Expected this to be very good but maybe not quite live up to the hype. I was wrong--this is essentially perfect. I don't know where to knock any points off at all."

"Lives up to its reputation and to me is better than the other hugely heralded Citra hopped Pale Ale. Mango and minty dank herbs compliment each other so well and this drinks way to easily. I could kick a keg of this."

"Overall: Yeah, this guy is the real deal. I didn't think I'd enjoy anything in this style more than Heady, but this is it. Just absolutely incredible. I tend to rate my beers a little higher, but a perfect score in all sections still isn't something I would normally give out. The hype is real."

"O - This is my first TG brew and I am already a huge fan. One of the best APAs I've had, with only Zombie Dust coming close. I think this beer has better flavor than Zombie Dust, but not quite as good of an aroma. I can only hope that Toppling Goliath will distribute to Omaha, NE sometime soon."
""
"Overall I have some in my fridge to share with friends who have yet to try this but it's just so good that I might have a few to myself. This is a beer everyone should try. Citra hops are my favorite and this is my favorite citra beer so far."

""

""
""
"Overall, just an outstanding beer. It reminds me of ZD in the way the fruit is so aggressive without kicking into that level of pungency and bitterness that you get from an IPA. It's one of those beers for which the taste is so refreshing that it's easy to take big draws out of the glass because it almost gives the impression that it's quenching your thirst. I'm halfway tempted to sit on my second bottle for a month or so to see if the opacity, nose and taste change significantly, as it's not often that I've gotten a hop-forward ale that was this fresh. I say halfway tempted because it's so good that I doubt I'm going to have that kind of willpower."

TG did an amazing job with this, and I can't wait to see production increase. The only drawback is the availability."

"O - A killer APA - my favorite to date. Definitely deserving of the hype."
""
"This beer is knock your socks off tropical hops. Mango,citrus and all things tropical jump out of the glass. The pour is a gorgeous golden hue. Nice lacing lingers on the surface. Taste follows smell to a T. Tropical hop bomb and I love it. TG absolutely kills it with Pseudo Sue. Only regret is I am out and have no access to it."
"One of the best American pale ales that I've tried. Certainly among the upper crust of Citra single hopped brews out there. Very worthy. This is one of the two or three truly special APAs that I'd actually drink regularly if I had access to it."
""

"Drink- I will say the debate will rage. I still like ZD better, but this is pretty good for coming out of Iowa."

"Bottom Line: Pure Awesome! this is the best APA I have ever had, it's that good."
""
"Looks gorgeous in the glass. A completely hazy body, color is banana-orange. Frothy head, major lacing with chunks, excellent retention, hits all the notes. Aroma is of strong citrus, lemon, floral and mangoes. Flavor is outstanding! Real lush mango, lemon rind, plump citurs fruit, juicy, refreshing, creamy. So very good, tastes like real hop fruit. Near perfect, think if the aroma was a bit more powerful, i would have a 5 on my hands"

"An extremely clean drinking beer and holds even more fruits than Zombie Dust (an also Citra single hopped pale ale)."

"Bottle: Poured a hazy orange color ale with a large foamy head with excellent retention and some great lacing. Aroma consists of tropical fruits with light citrus notes with great floral notes. Taste is also dominated by huge fresh tropical fruits notes with light citrus notes and some very limited bitterness. Some residual sugar is perceptible with light malt presence. Body is full for style with good carbonation. This is a world-class pale ale for sure."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great beer. Well done toppling goliath. The hop malt balance is great. I don't believe that this should be considered an IPA. At 7% and the decently sized body to the beer this is not a pale ale."
"O: This is very good, but the drinkability is surprisingly low due to the relatively high sweetness and the muddled flavors that emerge as this warms."
""
""
""
""
"Holy smokes this was an unreal apa. This beer proves that not everything needs to be double or imperial to be outstanding. Easily the best APA I've had. The pour is inviting with a deep golden body and foamy head. The smell jumps out of the glass as sweet citrus, orange juice, and five alive. The best way to describe the taste is like Squirt with TANG added to it. It's just that juicy and sweet. The only critique I'd have is that the sweetness would hold me to 2 glasses or the 22 oz bomber. Nothing wrong with that at all, but I just couldn't throw these back all day."

"Bottle at Toppling Goliath tent at Hunahpu's Day 2014. Pours an orangey gold with a fair amount of white head. Head held pretty well, and there was a medium collar, not much lacing. Aroma and taste were citrusy and lightly tropical. I honestly drank this so quick I couldn't get a fair assessment. By the time I went back for another pour, it was already out. Surprisingly light and refreshing mouthfeel, slight bitter bite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The best thing since sliced bread. If toppling goliath considers this a pale ale then I don’t want to know what an ipa is. Some of the best use of citra in a beer I’ve had to date. This really blew me away. Thanks again Paul!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty as hell. Drinkable as hell. A superb pale ale. It’s a legit pale ale… it’s not an IPA labeled a pale ale. It is a real deal hoppy pale ale. Really complex and a showcase of the Citra hops. Worth seeking out."

""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma on this beer is outstanding, and the first thing I noticed. Very strong and smells of tropical fruits and citrus. The taste follows the nose. I didn't pick up much bitterness if any at all. Very smooth and delicious my favorite pale ale I've every had. I could drink this all day every day."
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best APA's I've ever had. I love the mix of citrus and melon aromas and flavors. Lots of complex hop notes without being overly bitter or a palate-wrecker."

"PseudoSue is a flat out showcase of what the Citra hop can achieve. It's tropical, piney, and dank, the best of most varietals in one. The mild malt base allows that character to shine. A competitor to Zombie Dust? I suppose. All I know is that they both FUCKING rule!"
""
"Overall I may have found my favorite Pale Ale. Though for every moment there can be a different beer to bring you to that bliss always seeked by the hardcore beer geek. This will go in the books as one of the best Pales I've had along with Zombie Dust, Row 2 Hill 56, and Hoppy Birthday."
"O- A very good APA; up there with ZD."

"I NEED more Toppling Goliath in my life. This is the first one by them I've tried, and I'm hungry for more."
""
""
""
"O - amazing beer. We'll balanced and incredibly enjoyable to drink. Drinks like the most flavorful session beer ever. It's this wonderful middle of the road IPA, that excels at balance. Like if Pliny the Elder and Zombie Dust had a citra hops love child. I will admit that I am very partial to Citra hops and this is one of the best beers to showcase why."
""
""
""
"O-A bit off on the appearance, but overall exemplary for the style."
"pseudoSue pours a light orange color with a good amount of white foamy head. Nose is tropical and has some notes of earthy, piney hops. The nose is actually lighter than I expected. But this is a pale ale, not an IPA, so I guess that makes sense. However, the taste is definitely hops galore! Super tropical fruity goodness. I personally love the Citra hop as is, and Toppling Goliath has done something truly wonderful with it here. This one has a very nice soft, carbonated mouthfeel. This is my first beer from TG, and if the others are anywhere near as good as Sue, I look forward to trying more."
"O: The best pale ale I've had, immensely drinkable! Well balanced with excellent hop flavor. I look forward to trying other offerings in the TG lineup."
""
""
""
"overall one of my favorite beers and i would recommend anyone who can get this to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is hazy peach with thin white head. Nose is huge, extremely hop forward. Faint malt base with tons of citrus, peach, and grapefruit. Taste is insanely hoppy, malt base just holds balance with a touch of slightly doughy grain. The hops are the focus, huge citrus and grapefruit with notes of fuzzy peach skin and faint bitterness through the well carbonated finish on a light airy body. Great stuff, reminds of brighter heady."
""
""
""
"O: Delectable. Not many words are necessary to describe how great this beer is. Well done Toppling Goliath. They are a small brewery now but they are absolutely well on their way to topple Goliath... Or at least MillerCoors and Anheuser Busch"
""
"O - This beer should be a serious contender for best in category. I can't wait to see what else T.G. has to offer. I will try to get my hands on this whenever possible. Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really great take on a APA. More like a West Coast IPA with a huge tropical fruit presence."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a little light orange, very translucent, with a one finger, white head with little retention and some lacing. Sure there will be some nice lacing as the beer goes down. Smell is really fruity, definitely some grapefruit, guava, orange, and a tiny bit of sweetness from the malts. Taste is better than I remember the last time I had it on tap. Seems to have all I found in the nose in the mouth with a little more quava and sweet fruit. The mouthfeel is quite thick for the style to be sure which is nice, Overall I think I got a bad pour before from the tap or had too high expectations because I really love this beer this time around."

"a brilliant pale ale, showing the delicacy and also the versatility of the citra hop. mostly clear bright sunny color here, inch of white head with great lacing. the nose is citra hops all the way, citrusy and a little acidic, with pineapple and passion fruit esters happening all over the place. what this beer shows me in one sip, is that the citra hop can be used successfully for bittering as well as all its normal floral and tropical aromatic and flavoring attributes. there is some solid bitterness here in pseudosue, which works awesome with the late kettle flavors of this hop. its really good, easy drinking beer with a lot of flavor, but honestly came in a little less impressive than the zeelander from toppling goliath, which is the single hop nelson sauvin ipa. this has more bitterness and heft to it, but still sings with unique hop flavor, i just adore it. fuller bodied than zeelander, but rather easy drinking still, carbonated softly but its plenty here. this is an art form, and toppling goliath now has to be in the conversation about best users of hops in the country. this is superior beer."
"Clean golden color allowed a brilliant bright white foam to sit atop. Nose and tongue perceive the same elements of perfumes, flowers, musky cannabis leaf, earthy floral tones and whole hop cone. This is very dry, very crisp and super easy to drink. My palate seems to have found this differently than so many others but I see why there is a buzz as it's big, bold and daring."

"Poured into a Sam Adams pint glass light gold orange, with a short head. The nose of this beer smells so juicy it will make you salivate when you sniff, citrus and mango are slapping you in the face. The taste is mostly to me floral and fruity with a bite at the finish, all-in-all one of my new favorites in hoppy beers, I think I have fallen in love with the citra hop because of this"

"Overall, a really enjoyable Pale Ale. It's nice to see brewers take this style seriously, even though they must realize that many beer geeks would pass this by without a second thought while reaching for an IPA or IIPA, never realizing what they're missing. Kind of makes me wonder if I should be exploring more pale ales myself."

"A weird APA. Very fruity yet hoppy. Lots of mango. Some other citrus smells and flavors in there as well. It seems fairly watery (that may seem like sacrelige for those who love this beer) and not as much head. Smooth, but not as smooth as other APA's like the sierra nevada torpedo Overall, a great APA, just not my cup of tea."
"Overall fantastic. Up there with zombie dust or almost gumball head."
"O - Overall this is a delicious beer, great hop profile. Wonderful."

"One of the better APAs out there. A regular growler rotation staple for me. Single hop really lets you experience Citra. Very clean brew that has citrus and dankness on the nose and tongue. Foam is bright white with some lacing and moderate retention. An all day drinker."

"I'm gonna make this easy, it's really damn good. It reminds me of super fresh Zombie Dust. Worth the hype. Glad I had a brother in law who picked me up a growler of this great beer on his trip through Iowa. Seak it out for sure. I'm assuming like most APA/IPAs, drink it fresh!"

"overall fruity with a slight bitterness, great aroma, very drinkable. defiantly one of my all time favorites."
"Overall this is a good beer, but I wont go out of my way to get more.

This was my first TG beer and Ill still seek out others though."

Amazing aroma - tropical, grapefruit, dank hops, herbal, faint pepper spice, peach, some sweet malt notes, lots going on in the nose! Palate is as complex as the nose - slight resin bitterness followed by subtle malt in the middle. Finishes bitter and dry. Light bodied with great carbonation. Very drinkable. Overall, this is a well balanced, extremely well crafted pale, an outstanding display of the Citra hop!"
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best pale ales I have ever had. I figured it would be comparable to Zombie Dust, but somehow it's a completely different beast. It reminds me of peach tea in the best possible way. The fruit flavors are somehow unique from all the other citra hopped beers. Track this one down and enjoy."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"O- Overall this is the best APA I've had to date, and it contends w/ the top DIPAs out there!"
"O: Hell of an APA. One of the very best I've ever had. I think the only competition for this brew is Zombie Dust but I'm honestly unsure if this can overcome the zombie king. I think this has a better aroma than zombie dust but the drinkability and smoothness suffers in comparison. Razor close but I don't want to take anything away from this brew. It is top notch and highlights citra wonderfully. Great dry crackery malt backs it up just right. Excellent craftsmanship."
"Medium body lightly creamy with a nice level of carbonation complementing the delicate tropical flavors. Finish is one if the best I've had in a pale ale or otherwise. Very mild bitterness and mangos all the way. Delicious from start to finish. Now I just wish it were regularly available."

"Poured into tulip glass. I think I smelled it for at least 5 minutes before tasting...just an amazing combination of grapefruit, lemon & pineapple. Pours a hazy orange, almost looked like orange juice. Half inch of creamy head with incredible lacing. Taste was a sweet hoppy combo with a nice malty finish. It's obvious why this is such a highly sought after brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this is an excellent beer, leaning more towards an ipa than a pale ale in hoppiness, but as refreshing and sessionable as any pale ale could hope to be."
"Thanks to omensetter for sending me this! Pours an unclear orange with a fine white head; nice lacing that lasted and lasted. Aroma is so completely floral and citrus hops. Very lovely. Taste has sweet pine, bitter citrus and a lot of sweet caramel malt back. Very well balanced, much more so than the aroma would lead to believe. Finished medium long and heavier to the sweet side than the bitter, but with some of each."
""
"M - Light bodied, too light. Its fantastic, but I had a few sips. Paused, went back to resume the review and its seriously almost watery. On the bright side, ridiculously easy to put down, still leaves behind a thick feel on the tongue, oddly enough. Ideal carbonation. Overall a fast/easy drinker."

"This poured out as a murky looking orange color with some yellow highlight. Zero clarity on this beer. The head is white and leaves a nice thin retention with plenty of sticky clumps of lacing. The smell is incredible, fruity and slightly floral, Citrus and Melon aromas fill the air just from pouring out of the bottle, no need to even smell it from the glass. The taste is about as amazing as the smell. Beautifully balanced sweetness mixed with some piney hop resin with juicy fruits filling in the gaps. The mouthfeel is about as smooth and drinkable as I've ever had. This beer is dangerously drinkable. Overall it's fantastic, I am thrilled to have drank this beer. In my honest opinion this could be a Zombie killer if you know what I mean... Definitely worth seeking out, I will probably try to get more of this one in the future. It's outstanding."

"Overall, awesome APA that really pushes the envelope of what an APA can be. This dogs Zombie Dust, but IMO is just shy of Sosus. However, slightly different style and I am more of a DIPA kinda guy."

"O - Holy tropical fruit! Very tasty and fruity IPA."

""

"O: I've had ZD as a 6'er. It's great. This happens to carry across the palate even better. It's so good that a non-craft drinker would love this and not realize that they just drank one of the best beers in world. Thanks TG!"
"This is a enjoyable beer that is a true hop bomb without being a DIPA."
"Overall, a superb pale. Reminds me a lot of Russian River's Row 2. That one was more bitter, this was a bit more sweet. But that's a hell of a comparison for a newcomer from Iowa. In fact, this might be better, top notch and legit stuff."

"This stuff is very good. Damn good. And drinkable to the nth degree. While I've definitely had a fair share of slightly more enjoyable pale ales, this one is valiant enough to join the best of the best club. I enjoyed this only slightly less than What is Enlightenment, and they are reasonably similar beers. When your brew gets compared to something from Hill Farmstead, well... that in itself is a damn good testament to how good your beer is."

"Decanted into a TG black logo goblet (also thanks to Dan). Pristine clarity, nice orange-amber color, with a firm cap of foamy white head; good retention and lacing. The aroma on this was truly out of this world, I got a blast of fresh tropical fruits from across the room...didn't even have to hold it to my nose. I'm actually kind of skeptical that this was exclusively Citra, as I've never gotten quite an intense nose from that hop by itself. But yeah, pineapple, mango, orange, grass, twinge of ammonia. Whatever the case, excellent. The taste wasn't quite as blasting or intense, but pretty much more on line for a good APA. More citrusy, orange blossom, caramel malt sweetness, good balance, low bitterness, with a more low-key tropical fruit profile. Medium body, crisp, clean mouthfeel. I prefer a little acidic twist in my APA, but this didn't really have that, with the malt profile coming out more and providing more of a balance and toning down the hop profile a bit. Very nice overall. Not really uber-extraordinary for the style, but still quite good."

"Thanks to duffman929 for going out of his way to grab this one! Appearance is clear gold with white head and decent retention. Aroma is citrilicious with bright tropical fruit, mango, and a bit of grain in the back. Taste is bright and fruity with light bitterness and mild gain. All of the aromatic hops are there and provide nice juicy flavors. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Overall, delicious brew, well worth the seeking!"

"I can safely say this is my favorite single IPA/APA. There are some double IPAs that I am rather fond of (including TG's Sosus) but for an easy drinking ""sessionable"" beer, this might be as good as it gets."

"Appearance was golden in color but got much hazier towards the bottom of the bottle. Taste was clean, tropical, nectarine, refreshing. Not much piney taste at all, just on the nose barely. No bitterness either. Just a tropical nectarine explosion in your mouth. Not a ton of carbonation, but I wouldn't say that was a negative thing. Very good pale ale. Glad to try something by TG. A nice change up from the west coast style APA. Thanks SocalKicks."

"Overall. One of the top pale ale's I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Thanks again Steasy66, you the man."

""
""
"First of all, I have to thank my new BA friend mnbuffalo for sending me this beer. This is one of those beers that disappears right in front of my eyes. It's so good that I'll take a sip here, another sip there, and before I knew it, the bottle was emptied out. Would I drink it again? Oh yeah!! More! More!"
""
""
""
""
"O: one of the better apa's I've had. TG is doing some sick stuff in Iowa. Got to get back home for these guys!"
"O - Really nice Citra hop pale ale. As one would expect, full of citrusy grapefruit flavors and a big hit of pine. Flavors are dense with hops. Very enjoyable pale ale."

""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O- This was a fantastic APA and is definitely one of the better one's I've had and easily stands up against some of the top APAs out there. I wouldn't say it's my favorite APA since I'm not a huge fan of one of the hop varietals used in it, I'm guessing it might have been Simcoe. That being said it was a great APA and if you loved Sosus you will love this."
"Cheers!"

"O: All foolin around aside, this is one of the best pale ales I've ever had. Clark and Toppling Goliath are doing some really great things in the middle of nowhere. This one is very easy to handle by yourself. Big citrus punch that hits the spot on a warm summer day. Nice clean finish that doesn't leave the taste buds burnt out. Scrumtrulescent really is the only word to describe this beer."
""
"D - Good stuff on the whole, but actually a bit understated for my tastes. The Zeelander, which I preferred, had more crackle and intensity. Still, I'd happily order a pint or two of this if it was locally available. Not an A+, but a solid A in my book."
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a very delicious and hoppy with a lot of drinkability."
""
"Overall, this felt like a good hefe more than an APA. But, I enjoyed it. I cannot say it was great, but' it was worth going out of the way to try. I can't say I won't stop exploring this brewery though."
"WOW. I think Citra hop has finally been showcased in all its beauty and potential. Zombie dust is very good but has way too much batch variation. This beer has been consistently a remarkable brew and I salute Toppling Goliath for that. Brew On Brothers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A tremendous APA from Toppling Goliath, the flavors are balanced so well, the bitterness is kept in check and really lets the beer shine. This really is one of the premier Citra hopped beers out there and any and all comparisons to Zombie Dust are well warranted."
""
""
""
""
""
"As a side note: This beer is a fantastic value as well. A $6 bomber at the brewery with no bottle limits! Unheard of, especially the night before a big release(Kentucky Brunch release)! This beer also edges out Sosus as the best hoppy beer that TG brews!"
"This is one of my favorite pale ales. For a long time, I thought it was an IPA. I recently had it at the TG taproom in Decorah and fresh, it's even better. Hazy pale in color. Huge citra flavor. Lots of hops. Cirtus, pine. It is a great beer. I have it listed as one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yep. Better than Zombie Dust."
"I am lucky enough to live less than 20 miles from the tap room. Drinking this beer fresh, mixed with their Golden Nugget (affectionately known as Sue's Nuggets), is alcohol bliss."
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This beer is representative of Toppling Goliath's talent for channeling aggressive dry-hopped qualities, while also looking like one of their pale ales (unfortunately). A bit edgier than Three Floyds Zombie Dust, Citra hops border on bold here which is saying a lot for the delicious but docile cultivar. It is also true to the form of the brewer in that is shows no yeast character, which seems to be one of the most unifying features across the Toppling Goliath portfolio."
""
"Overall this is a fantastic pale ale. Not the best, but still high on my favorite list. IMO, this is pretty apples and oranges when compared with ZD. The nose is the only thing that really reminds me of it. The malt bill is clearly different though, and not as refined. I also think the citra character, whill amazing, is a little muted."
""
""
"O: I was really pleased with Naughty Temple and PseudoSue only served to raise my expectations for Toppling Goliath. This is an amazing beer, no doubts about it. You see it, you buy it."
""
""
""
""
""
"very likely the best straight pale ale i've had"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really nice, tropical pale ale. Extremely fruity and sweet. Perfectly suited for a warm summer day/night. Really drinkable too. Could easily have several of these."
"Overall: probably my new favorite pale ale. This is astonishingly delicious, and a perfect representation of Citra hops"
""
"M - Light body, nice carbonation. Very drinkable and refreshing"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is one of the more truly enjoyable pale ales I've had in a long time. I find Zombie Dust to be a better showcase of the citra hops, but unlike Zombie Dust, pseudoSue has quite a bit more balance that makes it simultaneously sweet and bitter, as well as making it quite quaffable because I'm not mouthpuckering after each swallow. So basically its a bit less intense, but is more balanced and drinkable. If TG starts regularly producing this in six packs, I may have to make this a regular session beer!"
"O - Very glad I was able to buy some bottles of this because of how much I enjoyed it. I look forward to buying more as it becomes available. Nice work TG; a little brewery in Iowa that is making a big splash with the beer they are producing!"
"Overall: I wonder if I have a bad bottle/batch of this based on looking at other reviews praising how closely the taste followed the nose. If it had done so, this would be a beer to have on hand at all times. As it is, it is a good APA, but certainly not among the best out there. Many people seem to want to compare this to Zombie Dust (both being pale ales that focus on Citra hops), and while there are similarities, Zombie Dust this is not. Still, for $5 a bomber, one cannot go wrong with giving this beer a shot. 16.5/20"
""
"Jesus, what a stunner of a beer. Poured from a 22oz bomber from the first bottling run. Hazy gold and orange, a dash of white foam and good lacing. Juicy, stanky aromas float from the glass. Cattiness, mints and mangoes jump out. The taste follows the nose, with lots of spearmint, citrus, tropicalia, and herbs. The mouthfeel is slick, wet and full. Overall, an absolute winner from the new school of American Pale Ale."
""
""
"This is a really top-notch, heavily dry-hopped pale ale. Big citra hops in the nose, but there's more to it than that. The rest of the beer forms a perfect stage for those hops, with a lightly dry feel and a mildly sweet base. Reminds me a lot of Zombie Dust, and that's a big compliment. An incredibly tasty, sessionable pale ale."
""
""
""
"Still, this is one of my favorite APA's going. Highly recommend it."
""
""
"This beer pours a cloudy orange-gold color. The head isb half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is very fruity with lots of passion fruit, tangerine, and a hint of grapefruit. The taste is similar to the aroma. It even has a pleasant impression of fruity acidity. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a fine beer that I would highly recommend."
""
"Light and hazy, looks hoppy alright. Hoppy, somewhat herbal nose. Fruit blast on the palate, with all sorts of tropical notes there. Light and crisp without being watery. Excellent drinkability and loads of character. A good f-in beer... make that great."
"The citra hop is responsible for turning a non hop head into a guy who can really appreciate the great aroma and taste of non-bittering hops. Heard great things about the brews from Toppling Goliath so jumped on the chance to pick up a growler of this single hop citra APA. The first pour from the growler into a pint glass is colored golden with an orange hue with a slight haze present. Tiny bubbles merge into a finger of white head that quickly recedes into a skim layer while sticking to the glass nicely. Aromas of the citra pop out of this brew. Grapefruit, pineapple and mango on top of a clean crisp malt bill. Taste is big time citra-especially the tropical fruit character hits me upfront with a hint of evergreen, than followed up with a bit of malt and sweetness ending with a crisp slight bitterness that quickly cleans up inviting the next drink. Medium bodied and carbonated with 0 alcohol bite. Super drinkable...this is like candy. Yep-I love citra hops. A super brew. This would likely be a regular in my fridge if I could easily get it."
""
""
""
"My recommendation: You don’t necessarily have to wait for the bottles to arrive, (hopefully 2 months?), bars and restaurants around Cedar Rapids and Iowa City continually have TG brews on tap, or make the trip to Decorah and get it as fresh as you can. These guys are the real deal!"
""
""
""

"Fairly easy drinking. Very good beer. If this is any indication of how good Toppling G is like, I need to try more from them."
""
""
""
"An excellent example of the style."

"O- A very nice pale ale. This really highlights the citra hop profile. I'll definitely enjoy this again."

"Served with a huge, fluffy, foamy, frothy, off-white head that lasts a while and plenty of lace. Color is a slightly hazy & dark amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is a startlingly fresh hop, reminiscent of weed plus some sweet malt, citrus, resin. Flavor's much like nose, bitterness stands out; just enough malt and carbonic tang to balance for a kick butt IPA. Body and carbbonation are faultless. Finiish is like flavor, long, and drrikable. V nicely done."
""

""
""
""

""
""
"Toppling Goliath got the best qualities out of the Citra hop. All the great flavor without the harshness that I object to in this hop variety. Just wish they used a little sweeter malt bill to give a little balance."
""
"O - I love this APA! The floral hops, tropical flavor, and richness make it one of the best beers I've had, and another spot-on offering from Toppling Goliath. I'm very excited about this brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A stupendous APA - one of the best I've tried really..."
""
"Tastes, excellently, like it smells, only bending more toward the fruity end than the bitter. The result is a very sweet IPA that's very interesting and refreshing but could have been just a bit more balanced."
""
""
"Overall, I didn't care for, many other patrons had pints after the tasting. Just can't get over the ammonia I taste/smell in the beer."
""
""
""
"O. This is an awesome pale ale. I've had nothing like this before. This is very easy drinking and refreshing. I could easily drink this with a brunch, or would be lovely on the porch in the summer. Toppling Goliath has a real winner here."
"Tropical, citrusy, pungent but not too aggressive. Mango, grapefruit, dank green hops mesh with lush fresh fruit notes in the aroma. Some light resiny bitterness is balanced with a subtle pale malt presence in the middle. Big on citrus and tropical mango notes. Light bodied, quenching, and very tasty. I could have sat there and drank this all day. Pretty much the epitome of a hophead's summer session beer. Second favorite after Golden Nugget. Please put this in six-packs guys!"
