"A nice ""anytime"" pale ale."
""
""
"Mild, refreshing, and not too hoppy.  Great pale ale!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, I think this is a nice beer for any day of the year, but if you want a strong hoppy beer, then move on to their Torpedo Extra IPA. The Pale Ales are good, but should be reserved for those days when you want to switch it up."

"Fruity Taste - a real session ale"
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into a shaker. The beer is a clear orange gold with a decent amount of sediment floating around in it and is topped by a floating, soapy white head that has a light retention and a light lace. The aroma is a bright tropical and citrus note with a touch of pine and a subtle bread toast undertone. The taste is a balanced, medium bittersweet. The texture is oily with a foamy carbonation to help it go down smooth. The medium body is flavored much like the aroma - citrus, pineapple, mango, and pine. It finishes with a waxy, bitter grapefruit and pine that turns lightly cloying and astringent, but mostly clean, with an aftertaste of bread toast."

"The first thing I did on my 21st birthday was skateboard down to the store and buy a 12 pack of these. Sipped on them the whole day, these beers taste great. You have to try them!"

"Excellent full flavored beer Very easy to drink"

"Strangely... I was disappointed... Reviews are so positive but alas not one I would try again..."

"This is one of my favorite session beers, and was one of the beers that got me into the craft scene. There's not much to say about this one that hasn't been said a million times since it's creation in 1980. If, for some reason, you haven't tried this staple beer, do yourself a favor and pick up a 6 pack."
""
""
"Pretty solid and tasty beer. Better a bit colder and became less enjoyable as it warmed."
""
"It was ok, but honestly a tad bit disappointing after reading all the reviews and having other Sierra Nevada beers. Don't see myself trying again"
""
"Nice smooth pale ale drink.. Enjoyed it very much with some Italian food, wasn't too overpowering, but yet refreshing, definitely try it agian."
"Overall: It's easy to see why this beer is the best selling pale ale in the country. It's very clean, drinkable, and friendly to those who are new to hops. If you like this, try it's big brother Torpedo Extra IPA."
""
""
""

"When I let the funk out, it always includes George Clinton. As far as beer is concerned, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is right there with GC!  Right after the piney-ester grapefruit-citrus forward taste and feel of this brew, you'll be looking up ""Flashlight"" on YouTube. Drank my first in the 80's and appreciate it more now. Readily available - Get you some of that...soon."
""

"There is yeast in the bottle.  Look hard at the bottom and you will find it.  Impressive that they can bottle condition and leave eight yeast cells at the bottom of the bottle.  This beer transcends time.  Get ye some."

"A great hopped up copper beer.  Fruity floral and flavourful.  When I'm in the US I really enjoy this beverage. Perhaps my favourite pale ale of all time. (or at this time!)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious brew here, looking forward to throwing a couple of these back come summertime!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours two fingers of light tan fluffy head with good retention and some spotty lacing. Clear, light amber and orange. Some small particles floating around. Zesty, spicy smell of pine. Floral background with citrus notes from Cascade hops. Semi-sour citrus flavors, like lemon, with pine lingering more on finish. Bitterness is right about what I would expect in a pale. Straightforward and not too complex, but quite refreshing. Good carbonation, and stays on front and middle of tongue for half a minute or so. Acidity seems slightly off balance compared to lighter side of a medium body feel, but thats not a bad thing. Foam expands and dances around mouth, even with a small sip. Overall, a great example of a pale ale, perhaps not the pinnacle, but a highly recommended go-to. Easy drinking and easy to find at a good price (about $1 per beer, even in a six pack)."
"Overall, I think this beer is refreshing. However, for me personally, this is NOT the beer I'd want to consume everyday OR in large quantities. The taste really subtracts from the drinkability and I really do enjoy DRINKING my beer."
""
""
""
"Whenever I think of Pale Ale I think of this. Great beer for any occasion."
"The Gold Standard for APA..."
""
"Overall super refreshing beer. One of the best sessionable beers I have tried. However, it's obviously not as flavorful of a beer as an ipa and feels a bit watery on the palate. This is expected for the style. I would pair this with a nice juicy slice of watermelon on a hot summer day. It gets a 92.5/100."
"Overall... this is a really nice beer.  There's basically nothing below-average here, or even anything *average* for that matter--with the exception of the sometimes-funky smell, I have nothing but good things to say about this one.  Even the smell isn't that much of a downside, which is saying a lot considering just how sensitive I am to bad smells (as in ""if something smells really bad to me, I can't bring myself to eat it."")  I can see how this was so many people's ""wow, beer can taste like THIS?"" beer way back in the day when craft beer was a much smaller chunk of the market than it is today.  I'm glad I decided to pick up a fresher six-pack of this one after trying an old one in a restaurant once... although I don't mind the old version either, it is definitely better with only 2 or 3 months of age on it rather than 10 or 11! XD"
""
"Excellent, balanced pale ale. Not too this, not too that. Just right.  My favorite pale ale."
""
"Pours a perfect amber colour with a white head and a little lacing. Smell is not overly strong. Hops with a pine aroma, maybe a hint of citrus. Taste is above average for a west coast American pale ale, not over powering hops and maybe a little citrus spiciness to go with it. Great malt balance. Aftertaste may be a little grassy. Great mouthfeel. If you want to introduce someone for the first time to a great APA, this would be a great beer to start."

"An old classic.  Always happy to have this beer."

""

"A classic.  Pine taste.  A go-to beer that isn't boring."
"One of my favorite Pale Ales ! Goes with just about everything !"
""
""
"On draught at the Bier Markt.  I remember drinking this *many* years ago (pre-BA) and thinking how agressive the hops were.  It was definitely one of the beers that turned me 'towards the light.'  I think it is a true testiment to the craft beer world in general that now SNPA is just a standard, highly drinkable pale ale with a nice hop profile...dangerously sessionable."
""
""
"Beautiful, pale appearance. Looks very clean and clear. Small, non foamy head, quickly fades. Relative to how  great of an ale this is, the smell isn't too huge. Pretty standard piney scent. Taste is up front with hint of roasty malt but dominated by cascade hoppiness. Refreshing bready/cracker and maybe slight skunk finish but hardly detectable. Oil and resin mouthfeel. Very spritzy and carbonated, which really really works for this beer. I could drink this all the live long day."
""
"Bottle of pale ale drank."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear orange copper small white head, smells of biscuit cracker malts slight spicy hops, tastes malty on front with warming hop bitterness, incredibly smooth mouthfeel with a fantastic finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Obviously I have had many SNPAs in the past, and in fact I would say Sierra Nevada was my gateway into craft beer, but I'm just now getting around to reviewing it myself.  Sierra Nevada really fits the bill, setting the bar for other APAs with a beautiful, lustrous amber hue and two-finger, bubbly white head.  The lacing sustains throughout.  The aroma is floral and citrus with the hops coming through nicely, and the taste is not harsh at all, just enough bitterness to tease the tongue, and a nice hoppy finish (not overpowering).  I've always admired the balance in this beer, and the carbonation is moderate but present.  Overall, this is a standard for APAs, a really solid brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drank this right after the SA Rebel and loved this even more, looked and smelled amazing, had even more citrusy flavors than the previously mentioned rebel.  I think these end up my gateway beer to loving all sorts of IPA's"
""
""
"Pours a clear light amber with a thick cap of foamy off-white head. Amazing retention. The aroma is light, with mild pine hops notes and hints of yeast and malt sweetness. The taste is also mild, but not lacking in flavor, with pine, spice, and floral notes and a nice bready quality from the malt bill. There is a solid carbonation to it and a bitter bite on the finish."
""
""
""
"As far as ""big craft beers"" go, this is definitely not as good as Sam Adams. But it's fine, and I'll order one in a bar or restaurant if there's nothing better."
""
""
"Overall-> Truly perfect, brewed to a perfection! Love Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have been enjoying this classic for over 20 years and I think it is still one of the best pale ales...one everyone should try!"
"It tastes kinda watery. I didn't care for it."
""
""
""
""
"not bad, but nothing special. too plain."
""
""
"Great everyday drinking beer. Smell is really floral but the taste is very crisp with a touch of bitterness"
""
"This beer will turn an average drinker onto stronger, hoppier craft brews.  It's an accesible, staple APA."
"Wow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A new American classic. If your on here and have not had one- I find it hard to believe."
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours a clear golden amber color with one finger of thin lacing. Ample carbonation and streaky, clinging lacing. Mild pungent hop scent with a grainy, earthy undertone. Don't sense much of a citrus aroma. Medium bodied feel; carbonation gives it some bite. Some hop bitterness but also an earthy taste and an occasional sweet undertone. A very balanced beer.  This is the true embodiment of an American Pale Ale. I would choose it over many average IPAs but not over the better ones. (8.5)"
""
"Looks pretty, with an amber-copper color with a thick, bubbly head and carbonation bubbles continuously rising from the bottom of the glass. Unfortunately, not much in the way of an aroma, mostly just yeastiness. Smells like a lager. The taste makes up for it though, with nice piney and citrusy flavors for a cheap, canned pale ale. It's always been one of the most accessible and cheap beers that actually tastes good. The feel is crisp and smooth. Overall, a nice solid beer for anytime drinking. Not much fanfare or excitement, but a solid drink."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Nice head with almost no lacing. First thing I noticed was the light copper color. She looks beautiful as the slight carbonation bubbles to the top. As with some of the lighter pale ales it's a little difficult to pick up a smell at first. Eventually you can pick up the citrusy yeast smell though its rather light. It's got great drinkability and at 7.99 is a great value."
""
""
""
""
"Sierra Nevada and IPAs go hand in hand. Right up there with Torpedo as a fine ale."

""

""
""
""
"Good for sure. Good taste"
"A standard pale ale for craft beer, Sierra Nevada's pale ale is hoppy, yet with a juicy, citrusy sweetness that doesn't leave your mouth dry. Piney refreshing taste makes this classic a must have for hop heads."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good starter beer for a PA beginning drinker."
"Meh. Another middle of the road pale"
"I would picking this one up if you haven't already.  Sierra Nevada is pretty much the original microbrew, and the Pale Ale has earned itself as a staple in their lineup.  It makes a great session beer for hop lovers, as it has enough hops to satisfy IPA fans but with a lower alcohol content so you can drink these all day."
""
""
""
""
""
"World Class....Well, not in my world. LOOK: Honey colored with 1inch of bubble bath-like foam, and there was decent lacing. Smell: very mellow aroma of hops and piney. Taste: A malt presence up front, followed by a very mild hops and mellow bitterness. Feel: Mild carbonation and smooth...very drinkable. Overall,  it was ok."
""
""
""
""
"The standard by which all others are judged. I try and seek this one out in the SN variety packs to ensure I get it fresh."
"Excellent example of what an American pale ale should be. Crisp, ,flavorful, ,, drinkable, ,,, great beer"
"Smooth.  I enjoy the mild hoppy flavor and crisp flavor."
"Great pale ale with a middle of the road bitterness and high drinkability."
""
""
""
""
"Will absolutely seek out and purchase again."

"Pours in to an IPA tulip with a honey-golden hue and a hint of amber. The bottle-conditioned brew leaves large pieces of sediment gently drifting to the bottom, while the finer particles stay suspended. The otherwise translucent appearance of the beer really highlights the unfiltered nature of this one. Adorning the liquid is a massive, fluffy head that mounds over the top. In time it settles to a rocky layer of white foam, with impressive staying power. In its wake, mottled lacing clings to the glass. A sweet Hawaiian roll aroma beckons, with some tropical fruit in the nose. Faint caramel malt flavors dance with some pale malt varieties and a complimentary orange citrus hop bitterness. There's a little toasted grain and dryness in the finish. After a few sips, a pleasant bready yeast flavor lingers on the tongue. Nice juicy body with adequate carbonation. Perfectly balanced. Everything is apparent, but in moderation. This is an artful example of how the sum of a beer's parts can be much greater than the whole (or in this case, the whole cone hops!). This one is easy to quaff and entices you to take the next sip. They don't call it a stylistic standard because it's ordinary. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale sets the bar pretty high."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  What a great, fantastic, awesome, American Pale Ale!  So beautifully balanced and so delicious!"
"Definitely my go to pale ale when a wider selection of craft beers is limited. The quintessential American Pale Ale. Perfect balance of citrus fruits, pine and  earthy flavor with just the right bite."
""
""
"Probably one of the best Pale ales I've had. Great taste, nice bite to it and smoother than other pale ales I've had. This is the type of beer other pale ales should strive to be."
""
""
""
"So I'm definitely not a Apa aficionado but as far as they go this pioneer of the style is good"
"Slightly cloudy, caramel color.  Almost no head.  There's a hint of a smoky aroma.  Like most pale ales, starts with a citrusy flavor which gives way to the bitterness of the hops.  This one is nicely balanced.  Kind of a woody aftertaste.  One of the best pale ales I've ever had.  Great beer!"
""
"Not sure how else to rate my favorite beer."
""
""
"My go to beer in a pinch.  Balanced, with nice hop aroma."
""
"balanced crisp brew solid taste"
""
""
"Clean, crisp delicious pale ale. There are some better but for price, complexity, and pure deliciousness this is a great go to ale. It's moderate abv makes it fairly sessionable so this is great at parties and other gatherings."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice, very clean beer. No off flavors, nice and simple without any bling. Hop flavor slightly more than other pale ales ive had. Very smooth."
""
"Overall- A sweet/bitter pale ale with great balance. A benchmark for the style. Clear and right to the point."
"A nicely done pale ale...just bitter enough and trends more toward the traditional IPA profile.  Great drink-ability and a California standard. Balanced...tasty..."
"O: [3.50] This is a beer you could transition someone from BMC to craft with.  It has a mild taste but is slightly more complex with a little more bitter bite than a standard AAL.  Most of the Sierra Nevada stuff I try I really love.  This I only like.  I just feel the beer is too neutral - no risks.  No malty backbone.  Barely above BMC."
"Average beer. Ok taste. Wouldn't buy again"
""
""
"Need to buy more often. great beer"
""
""
"O: Would definitely drink again. This may be my new go to IPA."
""
"On tap at a local spot. I usually really like pale ales but this one just didn't seem to hit the mark with me. Had great smell, but the taste seemed to fall short. Maybe it's just an old keg? Maybe It was too cold I'm not sure. I just wasn't a huge fan of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not much to say about this that hasn't been said, this is a timeless classic. Super well rounded, clean finish, and the Sierra Nevada hoppy twist that is to be expected from them. Always has a place in my fridge."
""
"I have been drinking this for tears. It always satisfies."
""
""
""
""
""
"Still one of the best pale ales I've ever had."
""
"The most consistent (and consistently available) Pale Ale around."
""
""
""
"A solid brew I've been going to for a long time. Light, clear golden amber. Substantial lace. Aromas of malt and biscuit and a wee hint of citrus. Citrusy hops are the first flavor out of the gate, followed by a medium-bodied biscuity, malty foundation mixed with well-placed hoppy bitterness, which gets handed the reins holds them for a remarkably long time after the swallow."
""
"O: I totally understand the hype. It's a solid, refreshing brew. There are some that turn their noses up, but I think it's grand. Very drinkable, which is a good thing sometimes!"
"O- One of the best Pale Ales that I've had. Extremely tasty and fragrant. I am fortunate to have had this one on tap. Unfortunately, Sierra Nevada doesn't distribute to New Brunswick :'(. I recommend this to anyone who can access it!"
""
""
"light hoppy taste...smooth and good flavor. I'd drink it again."

"Golden pour with white clingy head. Smells of fruit and slight pine. Crisp and slight bite initiallly with a smooth, semi-sweet (amazing) middle, and clean finish. Drinkable in quantity!"
"Poured from bottle, hazy pale amber with medium head. Aroma with notes of caramel, hay, citrus and some pine. Taste is mildly bitter, well balanced with a medium malt body and some bitterness in the rather long after taste."

"This is possibly one of my favorite craft beers.  It has a great amber color for the pale ale style of brewing, an inviting floral citrus aroma, and an upfront hoppiness that fades at just the right time to a malty backbone, leaving a great balanced aftertaste in the mouth, with a moderately creamy mouth feel, all in all a great beer, one that I would buy again anytime, not to mention that this beer is a classic in the craft beer industry and certainly brought more awareness to craft brewing in the nineties."

"O - If I had to describe this beer in one word, it would be ""inoffensive."" Which makes it, I suppose, a good example of a Pale Ale, not as hop forward as an IPA, which is the point. I always say ""This is my least favorite Sierra Nevada beer," but despite that, this is not a bad beer. It would make an excellent ""Gateway to Craft Beer"" beer."

"O - An American classic and the gold standard pale ale. Just as good as ever."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 9/10/2014. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit, caramel, bread, light honey, floral, grass, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit, caramel, bread, light honey, floral, grass, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit, caramel, bread, light honey, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and fairly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent pale ale. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Poured a clear deep golden/yellow with a nice two fingers of thick white foam that lasted for quite a long time before fading away, with some nice lacing down the entire glass. Aroma is of citrus and floral hops, with just a touch of bready malt. Taste has a lot of floral hops with a bit of orange notes and just a touch sweetness from the malt, very well balanced. Mouthfeel is somewhat light and crisp, with a nice dry finish. I can see why this beer has kinda been somewhat of a standard to which all other Pale Ales are measured."

"A hoppy freshness in it, grassy and lime undertones. Floral hop aromas of orange, lime and grapefruits, followed by a decent, slightly underwhelming bitterness. Malt character is present but gently hiding behind the hops, adding a necessary body to the beer. Watery ending with only small hints of hops, which lingers long on the tongue. Carbonation adding a freshness to the beer, without being too present, well balanced. This ale does deliver as being an every-day IPA, without trying to offend in any way, by being to extreme on any of its ingredients."

"I do not remember this as it has been a while and would review it again at a later time. From memory. Orange color half finger head. Piney hops.  Taste is same as smell. Lower carbonation. I liked it more than other IPAs but can't give it a correct review just off memory and will re do this at a later time"

"I struggle to rate this beer. If you go purely by taste.. then you basically have a showcase for cascade hops, which craft drinkers are familiar with and by now may find dull. But I can't drink it and not appreciate the contribution to craft beer history and the rise of good beer in America. This beer is a classic. I also give it points for being so highly available."

"Poured into a pint glass, orange and clear with an attractive thin head. The thin head lingered and there was some lacing. Smells OK, but honestly not much on the nose. A light feeling beer with a little to offer everyone. Light hop presence, a little bready malt, a touch of fruit and a subdued bitterness. I get a spicy, peppery finish more than bitter. An overall well crafted, balanced ale with not much in the way of wow factor. Solid, but nothing special, so I can't approach the 4.0 it is currently getting. To me a 4 is a beer I will seek out again, and this I probably won't."

"Hops are not too overpowering for a pale ale. High alc content and very refreshing."

"This has changed my outlook on this beer. I drank a 12 pack of cans of this and was not impressed. It's either the freshness or the bottles that make this beer really shine. It is excellent, and it is a testament to how prevalent craft beer is becoming that I can buy this at my local grocery store for nearly the same price I would spend to buy Miller Lite."

"What a Gr8 Pale Ale...Just Amazing fresh flavors of Citrus,and nice Piney Notes,a stellar well crafted APA ,and @ a fantastic price point, 17 bucks a 12 pack! [eastern shore of Md] ,it is also a gr8 choice for those who perhaps want to venture into stronger APA's and IPA's down the road a bit...a gr8 stepping stone indeed~cheers!"

"A classic? Maybe. If you revere a beer for its history to the craft movement then, sure. Flavor-wise, I'm underwhelmed and not likely to crave this any time soon--though, it's worth another try if nothing more interesting is on tap.I can see how in an earlier age if might have made waves; nice, but it's not rocking my boat."

"Overall:  This is the prototypical American style Pale Ale and what I judge all pale ales to.  This is the best beer to introduce the flavor of hops with your friends unfamiliar with craft beer.  There is plenty of pine and citrus hop flavor but not too much and the bitterness is restrained, especially compared to most modern pale ales.  This is a great hop forward ale that is consistent in quality and easy to obtain."
""
"O- Really, one iconic craft beer. This one is fantastic, and one I go to when I want to stock my fridge with a single beer. It just doesn't get old. This is the one I point to when my macro friends want to try something craft."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is definitely a softer APA in terms of hops than others, but that is an unfair comparison since it is from an earlier time than more current hop-heavy APAs. It is a very well balanced, easy drinking beer. This is a classic, a standard, and a piece of craft beer history that you can drink today. Amazing!"

"Wow.  I went on a Pale Ale pilgrimage and think I found it.  This had a very nice taste to open matching the initial smell.  I bottle drank this and it was crisp with good hop taste mellowed by some slight piny taste.  This won the pale ale competition hands down.  Sad that I only drank two.  Recommend this to anyone."

"Poured a one finger head slightly browned egg shell white head. The beer was a copper orange color with elegant clarity. The smell is peppery and lemony with a backbone of dried mandarins.  The flavor starts with a bright Bitterness that gives way to the sweet malt before fizzing into a piney dry finish. Very nice.  Very classy."

"The greatest thing about Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is that you can find it in so many places. It's distributed wide and far and, unless you've wandered very far off the beaten path, it's usually one of the few worthy brews you'll find almost everywhere. It's a pretty amber and it's hoppy, that's apparent right away. The Cascade hops throw a strong shadow over the malted barley. A nice, mellow head adds a smoothness to the mouthfeel but the sharpness of the aroma, to me, throws the floral notes and malty finish out of balance. One is usually enough before my palate asks to move on. Unless of course there is nothing else at which point you'll see me order another and complain not! It will always be a solid, go-to APA for if/when you can't find an alternative to try at your local brewpub."
""
""
""
"O) Why review this brew? What else can be said? Hmm... Not a helluva a lot, but it is a classic. I always like to pretend to remember my first Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. The year was 1995. Teenage me was at a Grateful Dead show at Soldier Field in Chicago, IL. I can still hear the call of the gentle hippies, as they pushed coolers of it around on skateboards. "" Ice cold Sierra Nevada!"" I thought it was the nectar of the gods. I also later thought I was in an Ewok village. Not sure where I'm going with this anymore, but in any case this is a great beer."

"This is the King of pale ales! One of the beers that started me off into craft beer.. And I still drink them today. I've never had a bad one.. 5/5 all day"
"Overall (3.23) : This is a refreshing beer, if a little too hoppy for its style. As I said I am not a fan of bitters and this pushes the envelope just a little too far for me, but it has a decent fresh, grassy flavor. I would not buy this again, ever...as it is too bitter for me. That's not to say it's a bad beer. I can review a beer on its good merits even if I don't agree with them. This is a good beer if you don't mind a little buttery bitterness in your brew."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and great example of a classic American Pale, even though this beer seems a little mild compare to most American Pale Ales that are on the market now it is still exactly how the style was intended to be and it had that great balance that a lot of Pale Ales seem to overlook.  This beer has great drinkability, it's very smooth, crisp, clean, not filling at all and the taste does a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these especially on a warm summer day and I like to think of this beer as the original craft session beer.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance and they drinkability, to me those were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I would change or that I dislike, it's really nice just the way it is.  I would buy this beer again, it's usually a good option when at a bar that doesn't have a good selection, it an old reliable.  I would recommend this to anyone who is getting in to craft beer or American Pale Ales, it's a must try for any craft beer lover.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it's always the same and it always delivered when I want a nice and easy drinking beer.  It's one of my favorite American Pale Ales in the sense that it's exactly what the style is all about and I think it's one of the better beers from Sierra Nevada, especially for their year round beers.  Good job guys, I've been enjoying this beer for a while and I hope to continue to for many years to come, keep up the hard work."

"The driving range and par 3 that I frequent used to have Newcastle in cans. It had been a while and I had since become a hop fan, so when I got back into golf, I was thinking ""ok, it's better than ****-light"". But oh, what the devil?!? They now have Sierra Nevada in cans! I took it as a good omen. (I think this beer has actually helped me with my fade.)"
""
""
""
"A great drinking beer. The appearance is a light orange with a nice white head. The smell is full of hops but does have some more earthy smells in it as well. The taste is great with a burst of hop flavor in the beginning that fades into a toasty malt flavor that finishes the beer well. I can definitely see how this one is a popular beer today."

"Overall: Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a well established benchmark for the American Pale Ale, and for good reasons. Everything is well-balanced, and you can kick back a few of them without hop overload. Someone with an IPA-warped palate will barely be able to notice the bitterness, but that makes it more approachable for non-BA's just starting out in craft beer. It's a solid, everyday pale ale at an affordable price."

"Slightly hoppy and Easy drinking IPA. Smell the hops.  First taste is slight hops and bitterness. Finishes to sweet and dry. Probably first IPA I ever had 20 years ago and still is a great intro to bolder flavor beers."

""
""
""

"Still thought this was great. The appearance was beautiful - poured a deep golden amber but did not have a very thick head, thin and white with no lacing at all. Would have rated Appearance at least 4 if it had more persistent head/more lacing. We'll see if the next bottle is any different. Smelled kind of. piney in a way. Smells hoppy. Spice-y. Smells good. The taste is one of my favorites for a pale ale. Absolutely perfect blend of hops and malt. Got a hoppy flavor which transitions into a bready spiced barley kind of flavor. Finishes a bit dry. Light-medium bodied, closer to the light side. Slightly above average carbonation. Overall I'd say a 3.75. High drinkability, might purchase again if I'm ever in an ale mood."

The taste is very strong, really bitter but fresh, fruity, there is ginger everywhere, smells acid, mouthtaste stays for few seconds. It took me long to finish the glass, not very used to this kind of flavor but was ok."

"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale reminds me of a less hoppy Dales Pale Ale (I compare every canned pale to this beer) or a can of Budweiser that actually tastes good and has flavor.

"I have had this beer quite a few times, but never reviewed it. The beer pours a copper color with a finger-width head--little to no lacing. It has a distinct piney hop aroma. The taste follows the nose, but with a more prominent malt backbone. This being said, the piney hop taste is featured most prominent. A pleasant resinous hop bitterness, along with a hint of breadiness, lingers on the tongue for a bit. An exceptional example of the style."
""
"Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is a wonder to consume. There are beers as good, but when I think of a perfect beer, Sierra Nevada is always near the top. Multi-level hoppy flavor, not weak but not so strong you can't have another (our three). The best (and possibly only) good thing to come out of California since Ronald Reagan. (Anchor beers accepted)."
""

"My sixth Sierra Nevada review, which seems strange given that this one is obviously the classic and what put SN on the map for most beer drinkers. Poured out of the bottle into a pint glass. Dull copperish brown appearance. Floral notes from the cascade hops abound in the aroma and the taste. Great mouthfeel, not too intense given how flavorful it is. Excellent as always."

"I don't know if there is a perfect beer but this one is my favorite. I've tried many a beer to unseat the king! Color, aroma, taste - this one has it all. Great hoppy flavors that go with any foods that I want to pair with it. Of course my palette has refined from a Western Pennsylvania guy that grew up on Iron City, Rolling Rock, Schmidt's, Miller High LIfe, and Stroh's through college. Can't go wrong with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale!"

"First time i drank this brew I was put off a little by the spike in carbonation from the aftertaste. Had the opportunity to drink this on tap in San Luis Obispo. Had a much better experience with it there, much smoother. But, I have the bottle again and reviewing from that. This beer is really great due to the bottle conditioning. The carbonation spike is probably due to the conditioning of the brew, which I've come to like. It does offer a different flavor profile from it. The carbonation being one. The second, being a thicker flavor profile. Citrus and pine flavors persist. On the nose and mouth it feels like I'm getting the raw form of all the ingredients put into this brew. Although I do prefer the Torpedo IPA, i would have no problem purchasing this beer again, if on tap. But as long as the Torpedo exists, i will not purchase the bottle version again. Lacing is sticky and has a nice hue to the head. Flavors get more intense as it warms. 5.6% alcohol keeps you stable for the long haul. Overall a awesome brew!"

"This beer would be better named Centennial IPA light. Not as heavy, piney, florally, oily, or fruity as Founders Centennial IPA, therefore making it an excellent everyday drinker. This beer was available years before most other crafts available today yet still one of the best. Kinda like the Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin of beers, it's old, it's stinky but will hold with the new stuff and whoop your butt!"

"It's a citrus smell along with a citrus taste except the hops are absolutely top notch perfected. Have drank in a glass and bottle and their both to die for. I'm from los Angeles so this is a beer that is placed in a lot of stores around me, and for good reasons it should. Love this beer and love the Sierra nevada brewery. Perfect beer"

"What else can be said about this great staple beer. An extra nice pale ale that wants to be an IPA. A little more hops and it would be there. The flavor seems a bit much until you get into it and it balances well, hop bitterness yet a nice citrusy flavor that brings it all together!!!"

"O-pleasure to drink, well rounded, above average beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"So reliably delicious, glad it's almost ubiquitous. Not much more to add other than it's just a very well balanced floral beer. Not quite hoppy enough to be an IPA but pretty darn close. Just a legit amazing beer. Can't believe I have to do 250 characters just to say how good this beer is."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the first crafts I recall consuming along with Torpedo and Boston Lager. I dont drink this nearly as much since my palate has developed towards heavier beers, but its still quite balanced and has just about everything you could ask for in an APA. Considering price and availability, you will be hard pressed to find a better pale ale without treading into IPA territory. A classic and rightfully so!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My go to session beer. I like to have one of these with dinner. Great pale ale. Must try for the new craft beer drinker, this is one of the first craft beers I ever drank about 20 years ago."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The American Pale Ale standard by which all others are judged by. The very first APA I ever had, the beer which opened the hop flood gates... but which I still enjoy every single time."
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a half finger of off-white head with good retention and lacing. Nice aroma of light tropical fruit, citrus, pine, sweet malt. Flavor of mild sweet malt, tropical fruit, citrus, piney and citrus hops, finishing with piney, citrus and grassy hop bitterness. Awesome creamy medium body for a pale ale, great mouth feel. Seems slightly subdued after getting used to the abundant NW IPAs, but quickly won me over with a nicely balanced array of hop flavors and the creamy body augments the incredible balance of malt and hop in this ale. I understand why this is so highly regarded. A bit old fashioned in its flavors, but absolutely holding its own. A great pale ale from one of the world's great breweries."
""
"Overall: Good mild IPA, especially if you don't tolerate much bitterness. Not my beer of choice (I prefer stronger), but a solid choice at open bars when my only other options are the standard lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This has been my favourite in my young craft beer life. Has enough of hops, pine flavour, but not enough to be off putting. If I could get this regularly in Canada it would always be in my fridge"

"Wonderful light golden in appearance, modest head floats atop. Smell is its lesser attribute in my opinion, but what are you gonna do, good ale all in all.. Anyhow this brew tastes like a genuine American pale ale- light but a striking bold flavor. I love the hops ;) mouthfeel is excellent, very lush and full. Now this is one of those beers that is fantastic chilled and still pretty darn delicious at room temp or warmer. So take one to the river and enjoy"
""
""
""

""

"This ubiquitous pale ale pours a handsome golden copper color with a small white head and very nice lacing. The aroma is spicy, piney, and citrusy with a pleasant maltiness that balances out the hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is a tad too heavy for the style. It is very nice and coating but given the abv and style, I'd prefer it just s smidgen lighter on the tongue. The flavor is a refreshing blend of subtler west coast hops and light caramel malts. It is very well balanced and almost as distinctive as the nose. There is a reason that this has been one of the most popular and benchmark ales in the realm of craft beers. Its a good and consistent apa worth trying and respecting."
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer. So crisp, clean, and refreshing. Citrus aromas and flavors, perfectly balanced with a moderately bitter and dry hop element. Pairs spectacularly with Mexican food. Also taste great after a day out in the woods. A true American classic."

"Golden amber color. Very little head. Aroma brings out pine needles and caramel. Heavy hops makes for a bitter flavor and biting after taste. Sierra Nevada Pale ale has long been one of America's favorite pale ales. As someone who does not like IPA's, this one is bearable."
"Fruity and refreshing smell. Slightly piney hints. Very bitter hoppy beer but has a great mouth feel that is very refreshing. The bitter taste gives a slight bite that makes it enjoyable and leaves you wanting more. The slight fruitiness and bitter bite make it a great beer."
"Dark caramel in appearance almost orangish red. Very light carbonation with a minimal yeasty aftertaste. Definitely has nice aromatics, very thick head. Minimal lacing on this beer. Head had a little bit of clumping. Found this beer to be surprisingly mellow."
""
""
"This is my favorite beer. SO much zing and flavor. Just the right amount of pop. If you want to start loving beers with more flavor then this is the St. Peter of beers, ushering you into a vast pasture of amazing taste. This beer gives you that ah-ha moment when you realize what people are talking about when they reference a drink as having hints of this and that."

"O-Most likely the best pale ale around. Has been for decades. A pale ale explosion should occur in craft brewing so we can have super-multitudes to choose from like IPAs. But if not, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale will continue to do just fine."
""
""
""
""
""
"A refreshing and fruity beer; an APA which ventures towards IPA territory being hop-rich. Full of flavour with a pleasant albeit slightly weak aroma, and plenty of complexity to enjoy. The bitter, grassy after-taste can linger and be a touch overpowering at times; it's best to let this one warm a bit to balance the flavours a bit more. One that's definitely worth a try."

"O- its a very very good beer especially for one that is available across the county, its pretty loud"
""
""

"This is a great sessionable, all times of day beer. It goes with almost any meal, but has enough to be an after dinner Ale as well. One of my goto beers and usually at a great price."

""
""
"I poured my first one into a standard pint glass and proceeded to enjoy every sip. So much has already been said about the beer itself, so I'll just sum it up with this: do yourself a favor and pick up a canned 12-pack of this stuff if you're looking for one of the best combinations of flavor and affordability available."

"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is an amazing beer at a pretty cheap price ($10/6 at my local BD). The beer pours a hazy amber with a thin white head. The smell is overwhelming with citrus (mostly clementine). The taste is primarilly grapefruit, with a balanced amount of hop bitterness (this is hoppy for a pale ale, but not bitter enough for an IPA, this beer sits somewhere in between). The mouthfeel is nice and clean. Perfect beer if you're not looking for something too intense, but still want a great tasting beer."
""
"Serving type: bottle"
"The color is a dark, golden bronze-ish brown. It has a very light smell, not over powering at all. There are some fruit notes coming through. The citrus tones are definitely apparent. Definitely can taste the hops, and I'm surprised it doesn't smell a little more hoppy. Still isn't overbearing hop in the taste. It has a very clean finish. Easy to drink, and crisp. Very good!!"

"O - I remember this being sweeter, more citrusy, floral and better. The bottle is fresh this just didn't grab me like I remember it once did a few months ago. Straight forward pale ale, a solid go to in the right setting, but not something I see myself seeking out over other options."

"Overall: The hop potency is more akin to an American IPA, which is what I'd call this by traditional standards. No denying this is a great brew. There are finer, but for the money, this is a well crafted IPA that doesn't disappoint. A solid go-to for hop heads everywhere."

"Bought a six pack at a local store. Beer poured with an orange-gold appearance with a fluffy head that dissipated with a creamy lacing on the sides. A very rich aroma of spicy malts and and orange citrus gave me a good punch. Very tasty; citrus mixed with a caramel, bready flavoring and a malty aftertaste. Crisp carbonation with a subtle creaminess; really helps to make the drink refreshing and makes you want to go back for more. Overall, a fantastic pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A classic for a reason. Poured into a pint glass from a six pack purchased at PW Mart in Poway CA. Smells spicy, hoppy, with some citrus. Pours a honey yellow with a big white fluffy head. Tastes delicious. Remarkabely smooth and refreshing with a hoppy bite to it. This is one of my favorite beers ever. It can be enjoyed straight out of the bottle. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall - A great beer, that lived up to the hype I had built up in mind. Deliciously drinkable and just a great pale ale."
"O- This is a fine example of a pale ale. Personally I prefer a brew with an emphasis on the hop bitterness, but this beer is balanced nicely. Very easy to drink, and I will be enjoying this addition to Sierra Nevada again."

""
""
"Overall: Very drinkable, balanced, and delicious. One of my favorite beers. Can't go wrong with a six pack of this. The best Sierra Nevada beer that I have tried up to this point in my opinion the others I have tried have been good, but really lacked balance."
"O: This is one to buy by the case on sale. This is the go-to beer of all go-to beers. For example, I have found it for 12.99 a 24 vs 18.99 for 24 Dales. 4.25 for value."

"O - This beer is a legendary grandfather craft for all generations of craft beer drinkers to enjoy, balanced and flavorful, light enough to session, and available all year. I have easily gravitated to selecting SNPA over many other lame crafts because of its consistent quality."
""

"This is the only beer at the gas station next to where I work that is not a two year old, forty ounce, malt liquor. Despite a purchase made out of complete desperation, this turned out to be a great American pale ale due to it's absolute simplicity. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is like a good burger. It would not be prudent to add too many other toppings and over complicate things. The aroma is amazing, the taste of hops is perfectly balanced, and this beer goes down really smooth. The price is fair, and this one is about as easy to get as my women. There are only 175 calories in a 12oz. bottle, and since its loaded with hops, it's also loaded with healthy polythenols, that will hopefully balance out the damage my liver takes whenever I buy this beer and end up drinking too much! This A.P.A. should be enjoyed straight out of the bottle, in my opinion. A solid brew for sure."

"Overall, I picked this up because I had always skipped it over for something else, and I figured I should try SN's flagship, but I regret doing so with such an old 6-pack. I am loathe to associate myself with those who whip themselves into a righteous rage over the thought of a store that lets IPAs sit on shelves longer than a week, but it's nothing so ridiculous to acknowledge that 4 months is too old for this beer."
"I am writing this review because I am concerned about Sierra Nevada. I am a huge supporter of craft beer especially Sierra Nevada, but today I noticed something... Earlier today I enjoyed a pale ale in the can and it tasted great just as I would expect. Hoppy, balanced, a typical SN pale ale. Later in the day I had a pale ale in the bottle (bottling code 319311014) which was totally different. It was malt forward and sweet. The hop character was subdued. It almost tasted like fat tire or Sam Adams. What's going on Sierra Nevada? I have heard that Sierra Nevada was adjusting some of its recipes... I hope this is not the future of the beer I love."

"This is the original, quintessential American PAle Ale, absolutely my go to beer, it's fucking delicious, entirely sessionable and widely distributed! This brew is a golden copper color with a nice white head some thin lacing left on the glass. The aroma is sweet and hoppy as is the flavour. The flavour is very well balanced. The malt is sweet like honey and contrasts the bitterness of the American hops perfectly. I don't see this as a world class beer to be sipped out of snifters or a beer to impress anyone. To me, its just a great beer that goes perfect with any occasion any time of year. As i said this is my go to beer i drink it all the time. Perhaps you should too."

"Just a great overall beer. For 3 bucks for a 24 OZ it is such a solid session beer to enjoy after a long day. Great flavor, balance, just does what you would think an APA would. Something that I enjoy over and over, and definitely a beer that could introduce craft beer to someone else."
"Purchased a 12 pack of cans from Wegmans in Liverpool, NY. Great price point. I use this beer as a session beer. Great flavor and easy drinking. One of the best pale ale's I have had. I was introduced to this beer several years ago as one of my first craft beers. Great craft beer for beginners"

"Surprisingly full bodied for the style with a blast of dank, sticky hops giving off strong dry bitterness that lingers over the yeast and sweet malt notes into a dry finish.  Hop flavor is a bit one dimensional with bitter earthy character.  Lots of grass, pine needle and spruce tip with very little of the citrus/tropical fruit notes found in the nose.  It's there providing subtle sweetness but is overpowered by bitterness and strong malt flavors.  Hop bitterness is countered by bready yeast and malt sweetness.  Lots of caramel, bread, toffee and nut.  Well balanced with some nice hop flavor but it's not really light or easy drinking and doesn't really feel like a pale ale."

"O - I am pleasantly surprised by this beer. It is my first brew by Sierra Nevada and definitely not my last. At 5.6% ABV I could drink this beer all day. Easy beer to drink, but really delivers in the taste department. This is probably my favorite pale ale that I've tried. I definitely recommend picking this one up if you have the opportunity, no regrets on this one."

"I was looking at the recent reviews for this beer, and I was surprised that it isn't rated as the exceptional beer that I perceive it to be and as the beer that it used to be. Is it because the quality has gone down? I think not. I think right now--the age of the double IPA and the triple IPA--there is the desire for more and more--more hops and a higher ABV. This APA isn't about quantity, it's about quality, and the hops are nicely composed but they are also balanced. A pour of this beer reveals a great head with sticky lacing, and the beer has a smell and taste of hops that offer citrus, floral, and pine flavors. The mouthfeel is spot on for a hoppy session beer--perfect thickness and carbonation, giving it a nice crispness. Maybe this beer is too easy to find (much like how Sam Adams Boston Lager has become so taken for granted and too ""weak"" to be appreciated), but I think this is much better than many of the amped up double IPAs with their 10% ABV."

"Pours a strong copper color, with a good head. Head goes away quickly, but there is great lacing. The smell is wonderful, with notes of pine, citrus, and cascade hops. Very well balanced, pine and hops flavor, a sessionable go-to for any craft drinker."

"I don't know what the hell you all expect in a beer but this little mofo just rocked me! This beer is my new favorite! I just had one bottle from a sample case of many that I received for my birthday and DAMN! I just found my new favorite! My old favorite was Newcastle but now I think I found my true love! I haven't checked the price of this beer yet, but I hope I can afford it! The head stayed moderate throughout the enjoyment of this beer. It smelled a little piney and woodsy and I didn't want to drink the last damn drop knowing that this is the only bottle I had of it. What a teaser! It's kinda like the first good piece of a@@ you ever got. You feel like you want to savor the flavor but get greedy and say screw it, I'm going all the way....It's like that! Dudes, if you haven't tried SN, try it! You won't regret it! My fridge will forever be stocked with Sierra Nev. until my next love comes along..."

"I have a love hate with this beer, as I do with Sierra Nevada as a company. They make some of my all time favorite top 3 beers (Ovila Golden Ale, and the other 2 Ovila's). This a great pale ale, hoppy, slight bitter, but I don't like the lingering bitterness. I have toured Sierra Nevada's Chico plant, and they put every other brewery I have been to to shame when it comes to facilities, and tours. Part of that is the lack of corporate bureaucracy, since it is still a private brewery, and hopefully will remain so forever. If anyone goes through Chico,CA I would highly recommend this tour. At the end of ours, we tried 10 beers in their tasting room, it was awesome. They have a great pubhouse to great food."
""
""
""
"Any brewery can try as hard as they want.  But this is THE pale ale. Unique and perfect. Perfect showcase of the classic American cascade hop as well."
""
""
""
"This is my first review and will most likely be edited later."

"O: A good drinkable beer. It would not be unsuitable to drink two or three of these at a BBQ or get together or any other social occasion but not really something I would be satisfied with during a massive hop craving. It was good and balanced as it should be."

"Pours a dark golden color with small foamy head. Head retention and lacing is very minimal. Aroma is not very strong. Slightly hoppy but more of a yeasty, apple-like aroma. Malty, bready taste up front with a strong hop bitterness that follows. Soapy, bitter aftertaste that persists very well. Good session beer. I prefer a less soapy aftertaste but there is still a good hoppy bite."
""
""
""
"This was one of the first couple of beers I tried after jumping on the Pale Ale/IPA bandwagon, and now I'm a big fan of Sierra Nevada. I like this one for its smooth drinkability combined with that tangy pale ale taste - not to mention the fact that at many restaurants that have not yet embraced the craft beer revolution, this remains the best available choice on the menu, so I still drink it fairly often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my ""go to"" beers- it's refreshing and epitomizes a west coast pale ale without going overboard on the hops. The 24 ounce bombers can often be had in my town for around $2.99 on special (cheap!), and the larger size bottles are also great for filling with homebrew."
""
"Overall: A solid example of an APA. Sessionable and balanced, but at the same time, diversified enough to keep things interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall this is solid and very easy drinking. It is a well made brew that sometimes I have admittedly overlooked in lieu of less familiar faces and/or seasonal offerings that are not always available. This is a very good standby."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Highly drinkable, remarkably accessible and affordable. Combine this with consistent taste and quality balance and you have my go-to beer whenever I get in a tight spot requiring a stop at a grocery/non-craft beer shop. An amazing gateway beer for those trying to move into the craft world and one I have yet to hear anyone refute. This all said, it is not the best APA (nor is it a top 5 APA), although the sum of its attributes makes this a hell a brew."

"Overall: A classical american pale ale. The trick which works good with this one is relatively simple but fine balance of aroma and taste. I have it once in a while, brings back some good memories."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This will always be my favorite Pale Ale. Absolutely lovely citrus and floral aroma, with one of the most perfectly balanced flavors. A biscuity undertone is countered by the flavor of magnum and cascade hops, giving it its piney, citrusy flavor. Not too overpowering of a hop aroma. As I said before, it is perfectly balanced. It is JUST RIGHT. Truly a classic. This will always be my go to when I'm in the liquor store and not quite sure what to get."
""
""
""
"o: A different Pale Ale due to the unusually smooth mouthfeel. On the low side of hoppiness for modern American pale ales. A good one."
""
"Overall, one of the best examples of the style out there. An extremely quaffable beer with tons of flavor. An American standard."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is one of the best and most common examples of an American Pale Ale, and while it is certainly not the end-all-be-all APA, it is an immensely satisfying beer in every respect. It's a good entry beer for those wanting to get their hop on, and a highly-available standby for visitations to establishments with limited selection. It's very hard to go wrong with one of these."
""
""
""
""
"bottle. pours dark yellow with a solid white head. grassy and slight citrus aroma. taste is very bitter lots of fresh cut grass and some sweet sugar malt. had this on tap at the clarkston union and cant believe i have not rated it yet as it is a very true to style beer. it may not have the hop wallop that zombie dust has but the malt that is there plays a very nice roll in balancing out the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as the taste there is a quick biscuit and grainy maltiness but then the hops explode but simmer down to a moderate dry finish. By today's standards this is a pretty basic pale ale but one cannot neglect Sierra Nevada's role in the history of the craft beer movement. I bet this was wonderful in the 1970's to early 1980's."

"I really like this beer. It is reasonably priced and has a really great taste. It poured dark yellow with a thick white head. The smell of this beer was great. It has a nice smooth taste and the taste hangs on for a while. I think this is one of those beers that has a great taste from a big brewer."

"Tastes much like the flavor. Nice cohumulone grassy edginess gives girth to the flavor profile. This is very hoppy for a pale ale. Apricot and pear esters, mild biscuity malt base. Flavorful, but not a complex monster that would turn this easy drinker into something disjointed or ponderous. Hop flavors are really well integrated. Oranges, mild baby aspirin, grapefruit pithy. Ptihy is drying in the finish and helps clean the tongue in the aftertaste. Heavy carbonation stings in the aftertaste, but is somehow fine-bubbled and creamy when liquid is in the mouth. Md-light viscosity is somehow a bit creamy, too. Well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a ""starter beer"" for anyone introducing themselves to the craft industry. Great flavor with the whole cone hops. You will taste a earthy piney, and grapefruit flavor from the hop combination. Pale Ale to me is great anytime of year."

"Overall 4.0: Outstanding and a great brew. Smooth and balanced with a little more hoppiness than some may like. I, however, am a hop-head and love it. This beer is slightly sweeter than you might expect from a bottle-conditioned beer, but it makes up for it in its sessionability. I could quaff this bad momma all night. And probably will... . ;) Recommended."

"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its drinkability. This guy is a staple for the style, as well as for the craft beer revolution as we know it. The hops are robust and biting, while the aroma is decently fresh, mildly warming, and inviting. The flavor retains its strength with each sip, and invigorates the palate with its blend. This is a classic sipping beer, and something every beer enthusiast should be familiar with."

"This is a great all-around beer. It's sweet malty taste combined with the floral and citrus hop character makes this an easily drinkable beer for even those unacquainted with craft beer. While lacking the bitterness and complexity of an IPA, this is an easy-going, yet delicious brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nothing about this beer really pops out and makes me go ""wow", but by no means is that a bad thing. What I love about this beer is that everything is very balanced. It's a very easy to drink beer, but still has plenty going on to make for an enjoyable experience whether out with friends or just sitting down to a well prepared meal."

"O: such a great middle of the road pale ale -- neither the super hop-bomb American IPA/DIPA nor the malt-shake English pale ale. it's really the best of both worlds, achieving a balance I wish more American pale ales went for. it's in my Top 10 of go-to beers: when in doubt, this one is guaranteed to hit the spot everytime."
"And that in itself deserves a 5 across the board, and yes it is that damn good!"

"Overall- This is my first review here. Overall it's a great beer. Has a nice bite. I personally like maltier brews and had to give this a few tries before really appreciating it. Right now, I'm thinking of having a second one. Plan on having some other pale ales, so I can compare."
"O - There are others out there with more craftsmanship, and more interesting offerings too. For a beer than can be had so readily its still a great one."

"Surpassed only by Deschutes Mirror Pond pale ale, Sierra Nevada's offering is still the benchmark of what a great pale ale is. The epitome of balance and nuance, drastically simple and overwhelmingly pure, Sierra Nevada's use of whole hop leaf allows all of the flavors and aroma to shine through, highlighting the best part of a good beer: the sublime hop flavor, which this beer has plenty of! Delicious, and a great ""anytime"" beer."

"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, developed a nice off white head which dissipated surprisingly quickly and had only some lacing. Appearance was a light amber with a slight haze. Aroma was light and of malt and grain. Taste had hints of caramel, grain and a sweetness on the finish. Mouthfeel was very full and nice with a clean, slightly sweet aftertaste."
""
"Absolutely one of my favorite beers!! honestly can go good with anything, but you are better off enjoying this beer by itself. it has so much too offer, such great combination between the yeast and malt's making this an outstanding brew. you can put this on my list of top beers."
"Overall-for a beer that everyone can get just about anywhere this is a no brainer. One of the first craft beers I ever had still lives up to what it was 10 years ago. Price is among the cheapest for any craft offering. If you have few options in beer this is the one to get. 4.25"

"I'm not usually a pale ale fan, but this was sone of the better pale ales I've ever had. Very floral aroma and light, citrusy appearance. The smell was floral and citrusy. There was a strong lemon flavor at first, but the finish is earthy and reminiscent of a freshly laid bed of pine straw. It has a very crisp mouthfeel and goes down smooth. I'd like to try it again sometime with some spicy Indian food."

"This is my go to beer. One of my favorite pale ales. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Had about two fingers worth on head on it. Has a great hop and floral smell to it. Pours a nice amber color with nice lacing. Taste of hops, citrus, and floral notes. Has a nice dry finish to it. All in all just a great beer."

""
""
""
"Pours a golden honey with a white head. Aroma is nice and bready paired with some nice citric and just a touch of some floral. Flavor followed suit, with a moderate bitterness in the finish. A medium body, active. Overall, a solid brew. Not ever a beer I seek, but a beer that is perfectly enjoyable when I do drink."

"Hot damn, now that's an American pale ale! Thanks to my buddy Colin for presenting this awesome beer on a craft beer tasting night at his house. Normally, we cannot get this beer in Alberta, but due to the fact that Vancouver hosted the Olympics in 2010 and Sierra Nevada was a sponsor of their alpine ski team, he was able to pick up a bottle from a liquor store in BC. It poured a nice ruby with immediate hop aroma, but underlying and very pleasant caramel malt. The lacing could not have been better and it just tasted awesome! I immediately understood why Sierra Nevada is considered one of the world's best beer producers and at the forefront of the craft beer movement. If beers like this could catch on to the mainstream, we would never see Budweiser in another bar, unless it was the original Czech pilsner!"
""
""
"O-This is a good bear no matter how many times I try it. The hops are aggressive, but balanced enough to keep this from becoming one-dimensional. In terms of taste per availability unit (if there is such a thing) or taste per dollar, there are not many beers out there that top this one. Faults are minor and include a slightly off appearance and underwhelming mouthfeel."

"This may be the best non BMC beer that is just about universally available. It pours up a slightly hazy gold with a nice two finger white head, not much retention, and lots of sticky delicate lacing. The nose is mostly pine, resin, and citrus. Taste follows the nose. There is a nice grapefruitiness follwed by a spicy finish. Mouthfeel is nice with a decent amount of carbonation. Love this stuff!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A great go-to beer that I drink occasionally. It's available everywhere, and I use it to woo BMC drinkers into the craft world sometimes. I haven't found a Sierra Nevada product I wasn't fond of yet, and this is their bread and butter beer. If you have not tried it, get some!"

"This beer is a very slightly hazed orange color with a a large off white head. The beer itself is quite hop forward for a pale ale. It has a very light malt character of breaddy notes and sugar. The hops are the main attraction. Fresh citrus fruits, pineapple, mango, oranges. There is also a nice bit of pine, a very sharp and crisp hop character. The amount of hop flavor considering the bitterness is impressive. A medium bodied beer. A world class pale ale. Considering the price and availability of this beer, noting really comes close."

"This is certainly a ""go-to"" APA when you're looking for something to sit back, relax, and drink a bunch of. You can certainly toss these back all day - great drinkability, tons of flavor. Also a great beer for introducing people to the world of craft beer, namely hop-forward beers, as it has a large hop presence but is relatively mild and far from overpowering, especially to a new palate. This is APA done simple, and done right."

"It pours a hazy orange with decent head and light lacing. The nose carries citrus and resinous pine. It has a medium/light mouthfeel. The palate is first hit by citrus and sweet malt with a slightly bitter finish and that bottle conditioned yeastiness that I have come to love from sierra nevada. As you drink it the flavors develop more and more. It didn't blow me away, but I was far from dissapointed."

"Would rate this as a very well brewed ""transition beer"" that would be suitable for those overwhelmed by other craft APAs."
"Medium body and carbonation; good smoothness in the draft version. An excellent choice on a night trapped in a shit-kickin' BMC bar, thankful for this option. Doesn't fire up the imagination and palate the way it did 20 odd years ago but still a reliable and satisfying drinker."

"Superb - this pale ale well deserves the praise that it receives. Plenty of flavour yet so drinkable.

Add this to your must-try list."

"Wow! Decent beer in a can! Price goes down, value goes up, takes up less space and is lighter to carry. I thought I would hate good beer in a can but since pale ale has always been a ""go to"" decent beer for any occasion, it's fitting that it's now available in a can. And yes, I'm drinking it straight from the can. There is something about the hole in a can that aerates the beer and gives it a novel texture and taste which I must admit I enjoy. As long as these stay a good bit cheaper than the bottled Pale Ale I think I will buy these many times over. No need reviewing the flavor of one of america's most common ""craft"" ales."
"O: Basically and excellent light pale ale for those who aren't really into hardcore overbearing IPAs that dominate the top beers lists on this site. Grab one, or 6."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's hard to be objective at this point, having had it so many times, and having tasted this exact same flavor profile in every Sierra Nevada brew. That being said, there's a reason that it's a classic. It brings big flavors, but keeps them balanced. The hops are tasty, and it goes down smooth."

"I love the mouthfeel. I love how English malt feels, honestly. Its so slick and drinkable, yet still hoppy enough to fill a hop fix on a budget."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is an orange-copper coloring with a thin, filmy, sparse white coating on the surface. Aromas of citrus sweet and herbal spicing on a roasty, caramel backbone. The beer is smooth and crisp in mouth, thanks to the carbonation and the hops bitterness. Flavors are roasted caramel and a touch of smoke in the backbone, supporting a resiny, bitter hops profile that highlights alongside a citrus blend of lemon and grapefruit. Very well balanced, with a bitter, slightly drying aftertaste that again showcases some of the herbal highlights. Smooth, drying finish with some of the bitter and spice left to linger until the next sip. As I said of the former Draught Style, this brew is a staple of the APA style. Very tasty, and very sessionable."

"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale - The bottle says: ""Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a completely natural ale. There are no additives, only the finest malted barley, whole hops, brewer's yeast, and crystal-clear water. The fine layer of yeast in each bottle is a result of the traditional bottle-conditioning process that produces carbonation naturally."""

"A classic American pale ale and one of my standards. Still better than many of the new to market American pale ales. Solid in appearance, nose and taste. One of the best ""gateway"" beers for those trying to get off of bland and boring adjunct beers..."
"This is one of my favorite brews, a trusted outstanding ale that I can find nearly anywhere in the country and never leaves me wishing I had chosen something else. Paired today with a sharp cheddar and more muted farmers cheese, you just can't go wrong with the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
""
""
"Overall, this is undoubtedly worth every bit of praise it gets. If I had the choice between this and their Torpedo though, I'd probably go with the Torpedo. This is probably the best pale ale I have ever had. Be warned though, if you're used to your pale ales being ""meh"" and uninteresting, you'll be surprised when you take a sip of this."

"Pours copper in color with a half finger of head that dissipates quickly. Nose is pleasantly hoppy. Malt and hops are well-balanced in this offering. The finish is dry and mildly bitter. The quintessential West Coast Pale Ale - a classic that is always a solid, if not extraordinary, choice."
""

"I first tried this beer a few years ago, but it was skunked, in fact I had a string of skunked SN brews. Last week I bought it again, deciding to give it another chance. Saturday, I drank 3 of them, and though it wasn't skunked, I wasn't impressed. An off bitterness, and not much else. Perhaps my taste was off, because tonight, I finally see what everyone is talking about. A well-rounded, full-flavored brew. A greatt summer ale. I'll definitely buy this again."

"Just the Crack seemed to release a lot of hops aroma into the room. The inverted Glug really made it seem as though I had sprayed hops air freshener and I would be lying if I said that my mouth was not watering. I was looking at a massive two-plus fingers of dense, French Vanilla-colored head with excellent retention when I was done with my pour. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was full of pine hops and now I was starting to drool. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, slightly viscous and the hops were soft, not overpowering as in some (many?) AIPAs. The melding of the hops with the malt was very pleasant and caused me to think back to the mid-1980's when I had this for the first time. I remember thinking that it was too bitter, but now it is just what the doctor ordered for this Jonesin' hophead. Finish was semi-dry and both pleasant and refreshing. I am so excited to see it being CANned and I would recommend it for anyone's cooler under any circumstances. Believe the hype!"

"Poured from 22oz bottle golden color with finger of off white head and lots of tiny bubbles. Smell is sweet malt and citrus and grass hop aroma. Taste is sweet grapefruit at first, slightly thin and watery feel then turns a bit dry and bitter lemon peel flavor. Overall a very easy to drink tasty pale ale."

"You could make the argument that this is a borderline IPA in terms of stylistic components. It's not quite a simple pale ale pounder, and not quite an IPA sipper. But it's a little of both."
"O: The beer that started it all. I got away from it for many years and this reminds me why. Good beer but it just doesn't have the flavor I'm looking for. To each their own. A great gateway brew for any novice craft beer drinker."
""
"I can see why so many people point to this as an intro craft beer. It has lots of the elements of more extreme beers, but all in moderation and gently executed. A very restrained beer, and that's what makes it so good. I was prepared to be underwhelmed, but I wasn't."

"Draft: Poured a medium amber color ale with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of citrus and piney hops is well balanced against some lightly sweet caramel malt base. Taste is also a wonderfully mix of floral hops notes from West Coast hops with nice line and citrus notes though they are never overwhelming. Malt base is not too sweet and well balanced against the hops. Body is about average with good carbonation. This si one staple that I will never get tired of."

"I have always thought the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale was quite good from the bottle, but then I tried it from the can and found the flavor far superior. This is one of the best beers on the market for its price, and it is easy to find. Very hoppy for a pale ale, with grapefruit, lemon, and piney notes and lots of small bubbles. Just enough malt to counter any slight bitterness from the hops, but this is a hop-forward, crisp, refreshing beer."

"There is a reason why this beer has risen to dominance in the APA field. Sierra Nevada is known for its hops and this pale ale has a really wonderful hoppy aroma. The amber body and frothy head are quite appealing as well. Taste-wise, it's a blast of hops and a touch of pine follwed by an extremely mellowing dose of malts. In many regards, it tastes like the label: Green. This is not a bad thing, but I've found that it is not an everytime beer as a result."

"Poured a nice clear amber with a one finger white head that receded to a white ring leaving ample lacing. Pretty nice, very true to style. Scents of pine, citrus-zest, slight orange, biscuit-like malt, and floral hop notes. A nice balanced aroma profile of hops and malt, neither overwhelming the other. Very well executed and pleasant. Flavors of sweet malt, including caramel and toffee and some bready, nutty flavors, a moderate level of hop bitterness, with floral, pine resin and citrus zest hop flavors. The citrus zest comes through more on the finish. The finish is dry, with an almost woody flavor mingled with citrus zest and pine. Aftertaste it woody and modestly bitter. A very good, balanced flavor profiling combining hops and malt, with neither outshining the other. Very good. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate-light carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Very easy to drink with the right body for a good session ale. Overall this is a classic craft beer. Its balanced in aroma and flavor, both of which are very well executed in their constituent elements. The nice, smooth mouthfeel contributes to the beers drinkability and combines with the flavor and aroma to make a classic session ale. One of the best easily available craft beers out there."

"Overall: This is one of americas great originals, and it is still top class today. As someone that appreciates originality, it is hard not to mention this as one of americas greatest beers.

"This is an exceptional beer! It features a fantastic amber colour, a somewhat grassy aroma, and complemented with a ’bitter but sweet’ taste. It feels like this has a lot going on in terms of its taste, body and aroma. In terms of drinking, this beer has sipping qualities; a very easy to drink yet rewarding and complex beer! I would absolutely suggest you pick this up if you get a chance, I know its quite well established in the USA but it seems to be picking up over in the UK today, if you spot it, give it a shot!"

"Pours a clear gold color with a thick, foamy white head, good retention and decent lacing. Aroma is mostly of piney, citrusy hops with a bit of caramel malt undertone. Taste is initially faintly sweet, biscuit-like maltiness upfront; crisp, piney, grapefruit-like hop bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied with a somehwat chewy mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation."

"The pale ale that is the standard to which many are judged. Sierra Nevada really puts out a good, consistent product.

"Overall this beer had a lot of pop to it. It was kinda fizzy to me but it had a good hoppiness to it and it was a little less pale than other ""pale"" ales. I'm not sure if I could drink a lot of these but I think it's damn good beer. Maybe if the taste wasn't as strong on the hops I'd like it better."
"O: This is solid. Nothing that you'd go far out of your way to seek out...but a sixer of cans watching the water for dolphins...can't be beat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Above average pale ale from Sierra Nevada. It seems like it is lacking in the smell department. The crisp finish and great mouthfeel of this beer make it a decent beer and coupled with relatively low ABV, it is a good session-able craft brew."
"O: One of the early craft beers that I was introduced to and enjoyed, this beer is a classic introductory craft beer. This beer is easy to drink and very sessionable. I have had this beer many times over the last 15+ years and likely will continue to get it as an everyday kind of beer."

""

""
"It's hard to beat a SNPA on a warm spring day, especially a really fresh one. Bursting with grapefruit, flower pollen, and spicy white pepper notes. Clean, dry, and drinkable with just a hint of caramel sugar to balance out the IBUs. I can see a 12 pack of cans being a spring/summer staple in my fridge. Kudos to Sierra Nevada for jumping on the can trend."
""
""
""
""
"I've had this on tap a bunch of times, and I always felt that the bottles felt... off. I am probably crazy, but I think the can format improves this beer. It's a classic."
""
"Pours slightly hazy and golden with an abundant, lingering off-white head. As the head dissipates, plenty of sticking lacing is left on the glass. The smell is sweet from the malt and also has aromas of citrus and pine from the hops. The flavors up front are pine and citrus. There's also some malt sweetness in the flavor. The flavors are very well-balanced. The body is medium and there is plenty of carbonation. This beer is crisp and refreshing. Overall, this is an excellent beer. This pale ale is perfect for any occasion and is a great way to introduce someone to the pale ale style."
"Overall - Probably my favourite beer to session. The taste is perfectly balanced and the beer is highly drinkable. My go to pale ale that I was happy to finally try on tap."

"Pours a cloudy golden color with a thick, head that lingers around a bit and forms a nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is fruity and citrus consistent with Cascade hops. The taste is an excellent balance of citrusy hops and sweet malts. Mouthfeel is medium with good amount of carbonation. Easy drinking PA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great introduction to the style for me. My focus would be on Hefeweizens and Belgian Strong ales but this has definitely got me wanting more PAs and IPAs, as well as more Sierra Nevada in general. Highly recommended and would make a great summer relaxation beer. Great taste and complexity but highly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For what its worth, it has a pretty nice grassy taste and smell. If you're a real hophead, this won't do the trick, but I personally like it when I'm looking for a lower alcohol beer without stepping all the way down to something like, God forbid, a light lager."

I could drink this in the middle of winter in front of the fire, at a summertime BBQ, tailgating at Arrowhead, whatever. Very sessionable, an excellent representation of the style. I could drink this beer anytime."
"O - A classic. A really simple and clean pale ale that is highly approachable. In the future this will probably be my go to canned beer."

"Wow, I love this in canned form, as I swear this is the freshest tasting that I’ve ever had this beer and that includes on draft as well. Just crisp, well balanced, and easy drinking as can be and now super portable as well! I’ll be drinking plenty this summer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Never been a huge SN PA guy, and truth be told I thought I was going to give it a lower rating than I have. Just not a big fan of the flavor profile. Too much pine hop in the mix, and the balance is skewed toward hop, for sure."
"Light hop bitterness, with hoppy flavors of pine and spice, complimented by a touch of malt = what i want in a pale ale. I think the end result adds up to more than the individual aspects, hence my overall rating being higher than the other ratings."
""

""
""
"Overall: A"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall: It's a classic and something you can always rely on."
""
"Pours a nice deep honey color with very thick and lasting head. High carbonation is present at first but dissipates fairly quickly. Nice smooth taste with a light hint of apple. Ends with slightly bitter taste on tongue and back of throat. Very good and high drinkability."
"Overall - A time tested recipe that's hard to dismiss. Great all around flavor profile with the right amount of hops and malts to appeal to the masses. One of several gateway craft beers that has led many folks down the road to hopheadness. We love that it's in cans and we'll certainly be pulling a lot of these out of the cooler in the months ahead!"
""
"This is about as fresh as I've ever had SNPA, and yet I remember the bottles I've had in the past having a more robust hop flavor. Will have to do a side by side comparison, bottle vs. can."
""
""
""
""
""
"DRINKABILITY: Probably the best mass market APA that I've seen (don't get me wrong -- Zombie Dust is the best APA I've ever tasted, but it's not exactly mass market). Well balanced, but quite hop-forward. An excellent session beer that I'll drink and serve again and again. It has an excellent price point and it's easy to drink -- what's not to like?"

"Classic american pale ale. Huge cascade aroma and flavoring hops of cascade and perle blended perfectly to make this citrusy/flowery beer melt wonderfully with slighly more hop bitternes than usually found in similar type ales. Overall a very solid pale ale and easy drinkability."

"Ov: While far from the greatest beer, it invites itself as a sexy destination for novice beer drinkers converting to the wonderful world of craft. The combination of a beautiful bitter flavor, fulfillment and economic price point makes the beer a great full time option.

"Being a hop head, you wouldn't think this would be up my alley, but I do concede to perfect flavor when it warrants it. And this one does just that."

"Pours a golden amber with a thin white head. The smell is subtle notes of sweet caramel malts and sweet piney hops. The taste is the golden standard of American pale ales, crisp and drinkable yet full bodied and bold. Drinkablility is great and the aftertaste leaves you wanting another sip."

It is always quite possible my taste buds are burnt out."

"Very solid Pale Ale."
""
"Pours a beautiful golden with an off-white head. Aroma of citrus, floral hops and fresh malt. Flavor has notes of sweet pale malt, grapefruit/floral and fruity hops with great malt balance. A slight touch of pine. Pleasant aftertaste of fresh, sweet wort. Mouthfeel is very full and round."
""
""
""
"3. Sometimes, you just want a beer that doesn't require a high-maintenance analysis of its flavor profile, but doesn't taste like a shitty macro. Sierra Pale is your answer. Tasty enough to be appreciated; humble enough to have three or four in a row."

"This is basically a tamed version of SN Torpedo. I personally feel this beer sets that standards for all Pale Ales."

"O-This is a great beer to bridge into the world of craft beer. Extremely drinkable and readily available. This beer is decently priced as well."

"The classic APA. Pours a nice light copper color with a big fluffy white head that goes on and on. Aroma of pine, grapefruits, lemon peel, grass, more pine. Flavor follows with big pine bitter, a beautiful sweet caramel malt backbone, and a lemon peel finish. Lingering grass on the palate. Bubbly carbonation and easy drinking, slightly dry. Good stuff, of course."
""
""
""
""
"On tap. Pours a clear golden copper with a small off white head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is floral hops, some light citrus, caramel, a light mineral note, and some light pine. The initial taste is sweet with caramel, and a bit of sugar cookie. Then comes some tangerine and floral hops. The finish has a light bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""

""

""

""
"Pale copper golden colour, one finger of white head with some lace along the glass. Smell is hoppy, citrus, malty and lightly sweet, pineapple and grapefruit throughout, some grainy biscuity notes. Taste is lightly sweet, malty, citrusy hop, mild bitterness present throughout, lots of pineapple flavour in the finish. Medium high prickly carbonation, medium body, light oily and creamy feel, pretty good feel throughout. Nice and easy drinking also dirt cheap and flavourful, I can't think of a reason to not come back to this as often as possible."
""
""
""
""
"I would recommend this to any BMC drinker as a gateway beer. Good without blowing your face off."
""
""
""
"I tried this beer in Athens georgia because I had heard good things about it. The overall look was great and the smell and mouthfeel was good but it's just the taste of pale ales I can't get past. I'm more into dark roast or cream tasting beers. Not knocking this beer at all it's just more for pale ale drinkers."
""

""
""
""
"A craft classic. Always good to revisit. If you've never had, shame on you."
""
""
""
"O- I have been on an imperial beer kick, so this was a big switchup for me. It doesnt have the big aromatics and robust flavor of the IPAs that I like, but it is a solid Pale Ale with a fresh, clean flavor. I tried my best to judge it by the style and not so much my preference. It wasnt a mind-blowing experience, but it didnt suck. I would drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"Light, refreshing, but featuring lots of taste and hops. I really like this beer; one of the first non macro beers I encountered with wide distribution and near cheap pricing. Incredible quality given the amount they ship! The gateway beer as far as I am concerned. Fairly high drinkability but a bit too bitter to be prime, if only the hops came through a bit stronger."
"O: I've had this many times previously without thinking much about it. It does hold up well during evaluation and deserves its place in the pantheon of craft beer. It's refreshing, clean-tasting, crisp, etc. -- all the things the BMC offerings have promised, but has so much more substance and flavor. It's a dependable, solid, go-to beer that is ubiquitous and a terrific value, to boot. It delivers a great deal for its modest 5.6 % ABV. I can understand how it has earned a reputation as a ""gateway"" craft brew, like NG Spotted Cow has become more recently for so many in WI. One could be perfectly content drinking nothing else."
""
""
""
"O - Solid IPA, I'd drink this anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - This is an incredibly crafted Pale Ale with great drinkability - it's one of the superior examples of the style available and a classic. Bottom line, it should be tried by all."

"I'll make no claim that I am currently an acolyte of Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. I'll tell you a secret, though: I hated it when I first had it in college. I was into nutty, watery beers (read: Newcastle), and this tasted like soap to me. I didn't always get along with hoppy flavors, it seems. Now I can't imagine a better stand by, go to beer in a jam. Thank you, Sierra Nevada, for making such a palatable, robust ale that is available nearly anywhere that a boring tasteless InBev product is served. Cheers!"
""
"O: the quintessential pale ale, the one I bring to all the parties and enjoy quietly at home. The almost light body keeps it very drinkable and the malt qualities keep the palate fresh to taste the next one."
"Smells like beer - Nothing overpowering. The taste is clean and balanced with Med to higher carbonation and good mouth-feel with a bit of a bitter hop lingering. This beer is easy to find and a solid option for any occasion. I will continue buy and enjoy this offering as you can't go wrong with this one!"

"To date I have consumed more of this beer than any other craft beer by a long shot. It's a simple go to beer that has stood the test of time. This beer is what really got me into craft beer. Still one of my favorite beers."

"My go to beer when a local craft IPA or Pale Ale is not on tap. Hoppy without being overly so. Smooth with just a hint of an aftertaste. The aroma is just like I always thought a proper beer would smell like. Certainly the best mass marketed Pale Ale this side of 30 West."

"Similar to PtE, still argued the best of it's respective style even though created years and years back. (SNPA WAYYYY back further than PtE but you get the picture) There has been plenty of time to improve upon the style but hard to improve upon the benchmark."

"O: the quintessential west coast brew. One of the very original. This is my go to in bars that don't have a great selection of beer."

"The taste follows very nicely. The hops aren't over powering at all. Overall I really like this beer. Definitely worth the price. Sierra Nevada always gets it right."

"It's a classic. Still worth returning to. Very drinkable too."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is what a beer should be. I could easily see myself drinking two of these a day for the next month and not getting a bit tired of it. Moderation is difficult with beer this good! Midwest Supplies sells a clone homebrew kit for this and I'm very tempted to buy it and see how that goes."
""

"Very drinkable, the hoppy but fairly sweet taste and classic ale mouthfeel bring the bottom of the glass all too quickly, this beer was exceedingly good for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably among the very best American beers ever produced and maybe the best APA period. Seems like I taste something different each time which is a testament to their recipe, the ingredients, and their QC procedures. Taste is complex, a basket of hops, and it hits the pale ale spot every time. One of a kind and worth its cost."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a orange yellow, with a 1 inch fluffy white head, with beautiful lace. Smell is pine, tangerine, biscuit, and grass. Taste is all of that, a little pucker of grapefruit in the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect, plenty of carbonation, not overly dry, and easy to drink. This is a legend, really another one of the beers that was a step in our quest to beer snobbery. This beer is over a 100 days old and still drinking well."

"O: I am a fan boy of this beer. Before I became a beer geek this beer was so bitter I couldn’t drink it. Now it’s probably the beer I’ve drank the most over the years (despite never reviewing it until now). This is the archetype of the style, and an amazing beer at that. Cheers."

"This was my introduction to Sierra Nevada, and I have to say despite the overall lackluster taste I have been introduced to a brewery that has much better beers. I just wish I had bought Torpedo first, as this to me is far too similar to the standard macro-brews available. Perhaps if I ever have friends who need a beer to drink while over at my house this will be my choice brew, but otherwise this one won't be gracing my fridge again."

"I saw on Beer advocate that this was an A- so I was pretty excited, after tasting it I really couldn't see why. I also judge beers quite a bit on the balance of alcohol. I want it to be there but not so obvious, this beer did not mask its alcohol very mask it alcohol very well making it less enjoyable for me personally, especially considering it was only 5.6%. I think there is plenty of better stuff out there, but its not a bad beer."

"Medium bodied with a somewhat sharp effervescence in the front. Dry finish, astringent. Hops mellow in the aftertaste but remain the main ingredient. Warming didn't improve this one, quite the opposite. Sadly, this is a pale ale more in name than in the glass. Drinks like a good lager should. Too bad it isn't labeled as one."

"Nice bright orange, lots of fizz and foam. Even before I got it into the glass I could smell something fruity and wonderful. Tastes of sweet tangerine and pineapple. Mild-moderate bitter hop flavour. It tastes like dogfish 60 minute but a little different.. soft, easy drinking. It is close to an IPA style beer, but not quite so bitter."

"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: Got my hands on one. Usually I like to have a few before I do a review, but one will have to do. The Sierra Nevada has a deep copper color with aggressive carbonation. The slightly off-white head is thick, even and lasts to the end without a lot of lasing of the glass. Flowery hops are big in the aroma and in the flavor. Under the hop flavor there a subtle undertones of malt, and the finish has a bitter aftertaste, but in a good way. The Sierra Nevada is a solid offering that a beer drinker or any style will appreciate."

"Taste was more pine, some grapefruit. But while this may imply a more IPA-style flavor profile, SN Pale Ale's bountiful malts give this hops character a superb sense of balance. Exceptional for the style, and a superior beer."

""

" Highly recommended."

"O: Ive had this beer hundreds of times and have never gotten around to reviewing it so i figured that now that i have a 12 pack in my fridge now would be the best opportunity, love this brew, not the best ive ever had but highly sessionable and just overall delicious, just too damn good and such high quality, sierra Nevada never stop making beer please"

"Its about time I reviewed this brew. I cant even count how many times I have had this beer. It has been my go-to beer all through college and even today. It consistantly tastes great...never disapointed that I bought it. I dont think I need to go into all the characteristics here...we have all had it. If you haven't ever had this before, do yourself a favor and go get one. For me, it was probably the beer that got me into the world of ""hoppy"" style beers and craft brewing. Would love to visit Chico one day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is my go to session beer and is good with anything. I love pairing it with food, hanging with friends or just when I am bored."
"O: It's a craft beer classic for a reason, people. All the refreshment you'd expect from a pale lager, but far more satisfying to drink. Insane drinkability, well priced, very easy to find, and a fantastic gateway beer for newbs. What's not to like?"
"the sierra nevada flagship brew, more of an ipa than a straight pale ale, but a delicious beer nonetheless. a complex and robust hop nose is enticing, and the balanced flavor, medium body and effervescent carbonation make this a staple in most good bars. this is much hoppier than other american pale ales, but is not heavy as some can be. it is highly drinkable with a slightly bitter finish and an extraordinary crispness. the colder the better"
"350ml bottle. Poured into peroni glass. Foamy head but I couldn't quite gauge it because of the glass. Pale copper colour, clear. English hops aroma, possibly cascade. Tasted hints of bananas and gummi bears. Very nice balanced bitterness. Goes down so well, great mouthfull, lots of character. Top beer."
"This is the base that all other pale ales get judged to."
"O - A modern classic. Very tasty and easy drinking."
"Overall, this beer has a stunning appearance and a tempting scent, with a pleasant initial taste and mouthfeel. My only complaint would be the bitterness in the aftertaste, but nonetheless this is a great example of an APA."
"I usually only drink this beer if I'm in a bar with no other craft on tap. I used to be a big fan of this beer but I think they changed their formula several years ago. It is still a good beer but not what it once was. It obviously didn't hurt their sales but if you are looking for great beers, check out some of their limited releases and seasonals."
"Appearance is a great copper tone with two fingers of head. smells like west coast hops all the way. have always loved this beer in bottles but i think on tap is a new fav. lots of pine and grapefruit noted. mouth is dry and a easy drinker. slick and wet on the palate. Overall top five Pales in the american market IMO. if you have not hade this on tap i say try it to tell the difference between the bottle and the tap! Just fantastic cheers"
"Overall this is the classic example of what an American pale ale should be. Balanced and full of hop flavor. Superb"
"From what I remember of the pale ales that I tried before I began reviewing on BA, this one is special. It is very drinkable, as I could easily have several of these in a row. Also, if the hoppy beers are not your thing, this would be a good beer to start yourself acquiring that taste. You can slowly work your way up to trying more hoppy beers."
"Mouthfeel is rich, crisp and provides a good hops bite within an overall balanced APA. Overall a great beer and one that is available everywhere to be enjoyed. Like Old Rasputin, the wide distribution should have no bearing on how good these beers are."
"Overall, this is an absolute staple to the craft beer world & was one of my first true craft beers. It holds a sentimental place in my heart & on my palate."
"Excellent Pale Ale! Sorry Sweetwater must say they have you beat in this department. This is a smooth beer with a bite of hops in the finish. It has a great flavor with a orange rind punch. I really like this Pale Ale It is very light bodied mouthfeel and a very nice and refreshing clean finish. Very good brew would recommend anyone try it."
"Overall this is everything a Pale Ale should be. Kept within it's limits, but loaded with character."
"O- SNPA is the quintessential American pale ale, the forerunner of the style. Is the absolute best? No. But after years of challengers coming forward, SNPA still stands its ground, refusing to budge an inch. That this is so affordable and so easily attainable makes it easy to forget how good of a beer this really is."
"Not bad at all."
"O: It's very hard to argue the quality of this with the price point. When people ask about the first craft beer they should try, I usually steer them towards this. It's not extreme by any means, yet is solid. It's a well constructed ale."
"O- great beer, also easy to find. could drink this regularly."
"O - Would be an amazing session beer."
"Overall this is a wonderful session beer. It is refreshing and not to radical in any one direction."
"Overall: A very drinkable, well executed pale ale. Everything is well balanced for the style. Just damn good."
"O - literally the best session beer for a hop head."
"Overall - The flavor, the price, the avaibilty, you cant beat this beer. Its a simple beer, theres nothing special about the flavors, its just a straight up pale ale made very well."
"not a bad way to get a hop fix without getting smashed, this is about the best thing I could find on the Vegas Strip pretty solid stuff though"
""
"Not the end all and be all pale ale, like everyone claims."
"Poured this beer from the bottle to a mug right now. The head started out thick but quickly faded. Nice color. Has a mild citrus/hoppy smell. There is very little carbonation. I am not really into having sediment on the bottom but I will manage. Has a mild bitterness for taste. Overall this is a great beer for a gathering or as some would say, a kick back."
"overall: Good beer, more on the bitter side, I probably wouldn't buy it for myself but wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me."
"O- there is a reason this is one of the top selling beers in the US. It was the first American Pale Ale in the world and is still a fantastic beer, I don't drink this as often as a should and it is so good out of the bottle (Kegs are CO2 conditioned). Best pale hands down."
"I honestly don't know if there is a better beer that gets the distribution this one sees. Next time you have a buddy reaching for a BMC, hand him one of these instead, I doubt he'll ever go back, Cheers!"
"Six Pack Pier LQ"
"Overall, an impressive 4.5/5. Highly recommended, and a fine beer to enjoy year round."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"For me, this beer was becoming mythical.... so much good written about it, but I couldn't find it in Australia. Finally, I came across it, at the excellent Leura Cellars. One of the best Pale Ales I've ever had."
"Overall: Great example of what a APA should be in my opinion. It's so well balanced and rich and you can't really expect vast creative intrepretations of an APA so i really cant fault it for not having a unique over the top gimmick tecnique, ingridient or flavour. It's an APA, and it's a darn good example. Thank you Sierra Nevada Brewing co."
"o: darn good beer to enjoy while doing darn near anything."
"This pours a nice clear golden color with a foamy white head which leaves behind a little lacing. The smell is of pine and citrus hops, a little caramel. The feel is medium to light. The taste is initially of piney hop flavors, a hint of grapefruit and some caramel, there is some bitter afterflavors but this is very crisp and not as fatiguing as a super hopped IPA (which I love). Overall this is a great beer, easy to drink but full of bitterness and flavor, its also one of the cheapest craft beers to buy so what's not to love?"
"The beer's viscosity is slightly on the light side, which means it is very easy to drink and does not make much of it self while in the mouth. There is enough support to make me feel I am drinking a high quality product."
"If I were to make a variant, I would try perhaps a saison yeast at lower temperatures if the hops are not to be touched."
"Overall: If there's a pale ale out there better than this I'd like to know."
"O: A good pale, with just enough bitterness and dryness but still very refreshing.  Very easy to drink."
"O: The highlight for me was the floral and grassy hops. They smell and taste great. This beer also looks very nice in the glass. I thought it was a little less smooth than Anchor Liberty Ale."
"(Overall) One of the finest offerings from Sierra Nevada (I have a hard time finding something that tops Torpedo and Celebration, but this ranks up there), this is a great beer and a must try for even casual beer drinkers. Highly drinkable and thoroughly enjoyable, it will not disappoint even the most mainstream beer lover. 4"
"can't believe for how many times I had this I never reviewed. amber hue, nice foamy off white head, nose is full of cascade and caramel, balance a tad to the bitter side, tasteful citrus and caramel meld well. sure there are better apas, but none of them are the benchmark that Sierra nevada's is."
"Cost at $20 is a little more than your usual six-pack is one small factor detracting from it's appeal."
"O- For my first review of an APA (or IPA for that matter) it was a good experience. Not too much on the hop side to scare me away from more bitter beers, but enough to give me a taste. Makes me excited to try more Sierra Nevada brews."
"Pours a light copper color with fairly decent head and good lacing around the glass. Smells of floral hops, citrus, and pine. Good hop bitterness.. maybe a bit much for just a pale ale... to me it's almost borderline IPA. This is an all around good beer"
"D - Highly drinkable, making this an extremely sessionable ale. Bold, robust flavors for a pale ale. Everything seems to work well together. An all around great beer."
"O: A great and refreshing beer. Not over the top an anyway. One of the beers that got me into craft beer. I would call it a gateway beer. A must try for any beer lover."
"There was one offensive smell in the beer. Within the malt, I smelled mildew."
"O: What's not to like about drinking fruity flowery beer? A delicious beer that is somehow available to me locally (in the UK) which I will be buying regularly. Love it."
"Overall, a classic, top-notch American Pale Ale. Really defines the style. Readily available just about everywhere and a safe haven for craft beer fans when out and about. Love the interplay of bready and mildly sweet malt and piney hops."
"O - a very tasty and sessionable pale, but I do have to say that the Torpedo blows this out of the water"
"Was amazed to see that I'd never reviewed this beer despite having consumed it for the last 15 years or so. Still holds up as a great, hop forward beer. Everything is perfectly in balance, and oh so drinkable."
"Overall a fantastic drink, great on a scorching summers day like today."
"O: This is my first review, and I'm still acquiring a nose and palate for these beers. I've always drank more flavorful beer than your average consumer and always leaned toward the darker, smokier brews. But this may be my current favorite, how well balanced it is and again the mouthfeel puts it over the top. Here's to America's Pale Ale."
"Notes: So many American Pale Ales aim for this. Sierra Nevada gets there. Well balanced, enough malt to anchor the hops, enough hops to refresh and delight. Like the other Sierra Nevada beers I have tried this one says quality."
"Overall Drinkability - Good, balanced beer. Balanced but not boring."
"Drink this one on a fairly regular basis - mostly on tap but sometimes bottled. Good thing that it is widely available. The color is always consistent. Aroma could almost be trademarked. Taste of the hops is well balanced by any residual maltiness. Very approachable. Good anytime"
"O: A very nice and stable APA - an easily drinkable session beer. I suspect that it would be a great choice paired with lots of different tasty types of food, as well."
"Excellent session brew, this is the brew that started my love for craft beer. So I have to give a big thank you for opening up my beer virginity and thrusting me into a world of delicious brews."
"I picked up a 12 pack and popped open a bottle. My initial reaction was that it had no nose and tasted like a watered down IPA. The second bottle I let sit in the glass and warm up a bit. What a difference. Nice understated citric nose. Inviting amber gold color with a nice head and lace. Taste is grapefruit and pine. Not too ""in your face"" but that was expected with an ABV of 5.6%. The only thing I didn't like was the carbonation. I thought it was a bit harsh and over bubbly. That said I still would enjoy this again and again."
"I've had a few in the past and will no doubt have a few more in the future."
"O: A very good American Pale Ale that is extremely well balanced, drinkable and would be a good pairing for many foods."
"O: The classic example of the American Pale Ale. This is just a damn good beer. It is not trying to be anything that its not and it is simple and up front. I have been drinking this beer for years and years, and finally got around to actually adding my two cents here, and it will stand the test of time and always be a classic."
"12oz. bottle served at 53 degrees in a standard pint glass. Pours a bright, translucent copper with a half inch, loose, creamy, bone white head. Head disperses into a broken slick. Nose is very subdued but expresses a light caramel malt character as well as an earthy hops presence. Taste follows nose with that addition of a mild citrus character that intersperses itself through the flavor profile. Moutfeel is light in body with an assertive carbonation that lightly burns the back of the throat. This is my go to beer when I'm out and the beer list is limited. Solid and quite drinkable; definitely a classic."
"Served on tap at a local restaurant. The beer I received had no head and neither I nor my wife could detect any aroma. The taste was more on the hops side with a hint of malt. Overall, it was a crisp light beer with no after taste that goes well with a burger. Except for the lack of any aroma, this was a pretty good Pale Ale with good golden color and a refreshing taste."
"O- Great APA. One of the best of the style, and one of the staples of craft beer. Definitely worth all of the love and hype."
"Pours an orangish golden color with a half in head. Smells very earthy. Has a bit of old sock smell about it. Hops are very noticeable as well as a bit of citrus. Taste is hoppy with a lot of earthiness. A tad bit of bitterness on the back end. Not a very complex brew, but good. This is a bit over carbonated for me, but very satisfying. Overall, this is a good everyday beer, or good session beer."
"Overall: An American classic. Enough said. This is always be one of the go to beers for me. This is the poster child for American Pale Ales. The poster child may not always be the absolute best, but it is definitely the one that gives an accessible entry into the subtleties of craft beer appreciation."
"Overall: Not bad. Definitely on the dry/bitter side of the style. Very crisp and refreshing. Could have done without the diacetyl. The citrus flavor really is the highlight in this one."
"I know this is the classic example of an American pale ale ,but.... in the midwest it becomes oxidized on the retail shelves and doesn't hold up well. I've had one six pack I really enjoyed (nice piney floral aroma, dry finish, bitter spicey taste). I usually won't buy unless I know it's fresh because I get a cardboard/oxidized taste that I can't overcome and usually throw the rest out."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a golden color body with a big foamy white head on top. The smell comes as pine and lemon. The taste first off is malt, then the bitterness of the hops comes through. Neither flavor is overpowering. The mouth feel is nice and smooth, easy drinking. Overall a good beer."
"I think I prefer the Anchor offerings for flavour, but this is even more drinkable."
"Overall, this is an excellent pale ale. The flavors are complex and well balanced. Neither malts nor hops dominate the flavor profile, as all of the flavors meld nicely to create a refreshing beer."
"This is a good example of a pale. You could refer to it as ""old reliable."""
"O - overall, this is a solid beer. Deserves respects as one of the originals. I had it some years ago before my palate really developed and I didn't care for it, but it really sits well now."
"Drinkability- This is a very good pale ale. It is Sierra Nevada's flagship beer and probably the beer I drink the most because I buy it in bulk. I always have a case of it at my house. Highly recommended"
"this is one of my favorite, drinkable pale ales.."
"It has a nice tan-orange coloring, but a mild (and pleasant) taste and smell. You really cannot go wrong drinking this beer and I loved it years ago when it was more difficult to find better alternatives. It is better than most of the competition, but ale lovers will want to explore other offerings if available."
"O: Mmm, this stuff really doesn't wow me in the slightest. LCPA beats it at its own game IMO, and I've had several better local examples like Pacific Ale and Hart's House Pale Ale. Very average on the whole."
"means, just a solid one. We all started w/ this."
"I poured a twelve oz. bottle into a pint glass, backed by natural light, revealed a light copper color, with a white head. A floral nose, well balanced malt to bitterness on the tongue. Good carbonation, and lacing. Very delicious, I would drink this beer anytime, with anyone."
"All in all, a classic pale ale from Sierra Nevada and is definitely worth a try."
"One note the first bottle I had I drank pretty quickly on a hot day and wasn't impressed at all, the next one was allowed to warm up a tad and the aroma and flavors were dramatically improved. Don't drink your pale ales straight out of the fridge or you wont taste anything."
"O: This was my first beer ever and because of that I will always appreciate it. I rarely order when out at beer bars, but the nice thing is, it is usually on tap at most dive bars so this is my go to."
"Overall a pretty good beer that's generally easy to acquire. It could be hoppier in my opinion."
"I had a case of this in my fridge at all times for months after I tried it for the first time. Opened my eyes to the joys of drinking pale ales and IPAs. Still me go to at sports bars that are riddled with BMCs"
"One of my favorite beers. Great balance throughout and hardly any weaknesses."
"O: This is THEE American Pale Ale with good reason. Easy drinking, juicy and refreshing. Hop forward yet incredibly balanced. This has always been a great go-to-beer. This is the best example of what an APA SHOULD taste like."
"D-Very easy drinking, and a great summer beer for when you don't necessarily want a beer that's gonna blow your socks off. I wish they had a more discernible dating system so I could know if this is two or eight months old."
"Deep golden bronze, with a 2 finger head and a solid retention. Strong floral hops fill the nose a nice smooth malt back bone, tons of lemon citrus, piny, very sticky and resin smelling. The taste is just about the same, extreme floral flavors, so appetizing. Big hops, big citrus, big bitter zest. Light on the feel, crisp, refreshing perfect for anytime of the year. Overall i love this beer, its the perfect APA."
"M: had good effervescence but knew when to quit aka had good level of carbonation. I can appreciate the bottle conditioned style. Impressive for a bigger microbrewery."
"A great beer. One of my favorite pale ales."
"O: The standard-bearer for the APA, and for good reason. Great looking and smelling, with above average characteristics all around."
"Overall: While I prefer the more hoppier varieties that Sierra Nevada has to offer, this beer is nevertheless a classic in craft brewing that deserves all the praise it's received. It may be gentle on the mouth, yet is flavorful on the taste buds. A great pick!"
"O: somehow I always seem to overlook how good this beer actually is. The leader of the craft beer movement for a reason this should be in every craft lover's fridge."
"Truly a beer that is standing the test of time. It's only been downgraded here because of so many new amazing beers that have no doubt spawned from what is SNPA IMO. Never dissapoints. Would definitely never turn one down. Again just can't say enough!"
"Kind of funny that I have not reviewed this one yet, I guess when you are always trying to seek out new beers you forget about the everyday beers out there. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a two finger off white head. After it dissipates it leaves a bit of lacing and a thin froth on the top. Slight pine and dried hop leaf aromas with a bit of estery fruit in the malt. Nicely balanced malt and hops with a medium body good carbonation due to the bottle conditioning. A nice lingering hop bitterness that makes its presence known but is not overpowering. Funny how tastes can change, when I was younger and new to beer this beer seemed so bitter to me now after years of drinking what seems to be hoppier and hoppier beers this one barely registers. To me this beer is important in the same way that beers like Sam Adams Boston Lager are important. They were pioneers in the craft beer scene, they are good benchmarks for the style and maybe more importantly, they turn new beer drinkers on to craft beer. A great American Pale Ale."
"O- I haven't had one of these in years... but damn I missed it!!! A seriously fine APA!!!"
"O: Overall this is a really solid beer and one that you could drink as a session if not for the 5.6% ABV. A good bet if you are in the mood for a pale ale. Good quality to price ratio too!"
"Inevitable, inescapable, all but perfect."
"O - Not an overly exceptional pale ale, but they are on to something at the Sierra Nevada brewery! Recommended."
"So easy to take for granted, and at this point it shouldn't wow anybody, but there's a reason why this was the keg beer at my wedding celebration. For balance, taste, and accessibility, a classic."
"Not a WOW beer, but one you could drink all night. Not many pales you can say that about I suspect, most are too heavily hopped."
"Notes: Yeast in bottle a top fermenter and is pretty active and can be cultured pretty easily."
"Overall I love this beer and for $12.99 a twelve it is a no brainer. If you are nervous about trying pales this one will win you over and get you started."
"O - Not a bad beer. Lots of good flavors and the mouth feel was great. Went down very smooth."
"Overall: I find it hard to knock this beer. It may not be the most interesting beer ever AKA the next best thing but it is a great introduction to high quality craft beer. I will definitely be using Pale Ale to introduce my friends to craft brew. Everyone had had this beer which validates it's reputation. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is one if the best APA's."
"This is such a well balanced, easy drinking beer. I could have a pint every day of the week and not get tired of it."
"O- Solid go to beer. Light and hoppy plus available year round. Not my favorite pale ale, but good."
"O - Impressed by the ending of the product, glad I gave it a second round."
"O-The hop lovers gateway drug."
"O: A great all around beer, one that I could drink at any time."
"A good pale ale."
"Had to have something to drink while playing pool, so I figured I'd revisit this old classic (and finally review the damn thing). It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises grass, flowers, lemon peel, orange rind, and very light toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, with the more citrus-y hops gaining in potency a bit, balancing out the earthier ones pretty nicely; all while the toffee doesn't give much ground. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a very nice pale ale, one that deserves the status it holds."
"Overall this beer is a staply amongst BA's for a reason. Buy it by the case."
"Pours a brilliant amber (not very ""pale"" for the classic APA). Incredibly balanced taste and highly drinkable. The citrusy sweetness and bitter hops seem to balance each other perfectly. So much going on, flavor-wise, yet nothing overpowers."
"This is one of the beers that turned me on to craft beer, and while it's no longer a ridiculously flavorful beer to me compared to some, it's still a really good one and a great example of its style."
"Pours a nice copper color with a two finger white head that slowly fades to some good lacing. Smells hoppy and of citrus, lemon mostly. Taste follows smell, hints of lemon and hearty hops, finishes mildly bitter. Mouthfeel is good, not a heavy beer really but somewhat strong from the hops. A nice pale ale that cycles with Dale's in my fridge when I want one."
"O: A great tasting session pale ale. I don't know why it took me so long to come back and try this again, but I'm glad I did."
"Pours a copper orange color with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a thin cap. Nice thick rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt and citrus zest. Taste is of sweet malt and citrus zest hops. There is a slightly soapy taste I am getting as well. This beer has good carbonation and is crisp and clean in the mouth. Slight hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. Overall, this is a good pale ale and pretty much available everywhere in a pinch when there are no other good beers on the menu."
"O: great beer, a definite regular in the lineup"
"O- This knocked out Yuengling as my go-to beer, an instant favorite."
"Overall this isn't bad. Nothing I would be excited to drink again but definitely not something i would ever turn down. Nothing great but pretty good."
"Food match: Hearty food would suit this brew well, roast game birds and salad with a celeriac puree and vinaigrette... Mmmm."
"For me, Sierra Nevada has yet to brew a bad beer. Cant wait till they open their Asheville brewery. Closer to home!!"
"i have heard this beer referred to as the benchmark american pale ale. i think it deserves that title. this is a good beer. it IS simple, but not to a fault, instead its simplicity sort of makes it more lovable. its just a good beer. good night america"
"T: medium body, balanced flavour, good bitternes on the aftertaste, long lasting end"
"This beer pours a dark yellow color with an orange tinge to it. the smell is pine and citrus hops with a subtle malt backbone. the flavor is floral and slightly hoppy with the malts coming through mid sip. the beer is not to bitter and has a fairly light mouthfeel. this is a very drinkable pale ale."
"I know many of us are beer ""fanatics"" but something is to be said of beers that can both please the Bud Light drinkers and the Beer snobs. This beer is not the best in its category but it is a staple amongst beer drinkers and is as good bottled as on draft which is not always the case. It has an initial sharp flavor that fades quickly so as too not be overly offensive. A solid overall beer."
"Overall: Great American Pale Ale, highly recommended. Unfortunately Ì'll have to travel abroad to try it again"
"O: This is an example of a solid American Pale Ale that has everything nicely balanced. One can't go wrong buying this truly excellent beer."
"Overall: It’s a good beer. It’s affordable, available, and tasty. This is my go too beer if we’re having people over for a party because I can grab a bunch for guest and myself. It’s also often the only craft beer at a BMC bar besides SA and I don’t always want a lager."
"Bottle poured into a traditional nonic pint glass. Two fingers of foam on the pour, lacing as I drink it. Great aromas of grapefruit and other floral hops. Very smooth taste, the malt and the bitterness blend very well together. The finish is quick and clean that makes you seem more thirsty as you drink. Very balanced, great beer."
"M: It is medium complex, almost not sweetness at the beginning and then fast turns into bitter and hard bitter with long ending that leaves a medium nice sensation."
"Pours a slightly hazed (depending on temperature) copper color with anywhere between 1/2 and 3 fingers of frothy white head. Grainy aroma with a certain caramel smoothness underlain. Smooth malts in the taste, grains, balanced by crisp, non-threatening hoppiness, and just a implication of citrus. Light-medium mouthfeel, and easily drinkable."
"The classic Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I remember sitting at the Keystone Pub when I ordered my first one back in 2007. It was probably one of my first pale ales. I can't recall having one prior to it. Anyway, it pours out as a lightly hazed yellowish gold color. The head is strong and leaves a good lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer has a really nice hop aroms on it mixed with some malts on the nose. The taste of the beer has a good bitterness to it with a dry hoppy aftertaste. When it comes to the mouthfeel it's a highly drinkable beer. It's got a good body to it and it's not overly heavy. Overall this beer is worth checking out if you haven't already, It's a pioneer pale ale, it really holds it's own again many competitors."
"O - How can you go wrong with a SNPA. It is perfect for a hot summer day at the beach like today. I can, and plan on, drinking this all day."
"O: One of my favorite, if not THE favorite ""commercial"" (larger brewery) pale ales, keep up the great work SN!!"
"Overall - great beer. My 2nd time out of the bottle, however had many on tap (strongly suggest you seek that experience out if you have access). I whole heartedly recommend this beer. To me, it is to Pale Ale as Sam Adams is to American Lager. Something combining just enough originality with tradition, and just enough mass market appeal with craft street cred. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"Cower in shame Budweiser, this is America's REAL king of beers."
"Overall: A solid beer and the gold standard of rating pale ale."
"This is a ok crafted Pale Ale although its got quite a dry, bitter hop bite to it that makes it hard on the pallet and not easy to repeat samplings. Not nearly as well crafted/balanced as the SN Torpedo IPA, this APA could be smoother and a little more refreshing. It has some positive flavoring notes, but seems a little off balanced with bitter hops and takes some effort to get down the full 12 oz. I go to this a few times a year because its so common but its usually a 1 and done sampling."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Pale Ale."
"This beer actually took away my craft beer virginity almost 10 years ago. Finally got around to writing a review. Thank you to Bierkraft for getting me a six before I deploy. Difinitely one of my favorite Pale Ales. Appearance is a rich dark golden with mild head and mild lacing. Smell is the SN hop presences I have grown to love, nice and floral and piney. Taste is fairly complex for a Pale Ale. Floral, citrusy, a little spicey or peppery finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat medium bodied with low carbonation. Overall a wonderful example of West Coast or American pale Ale and what makes me proud to be an American."
"O-The best intro beer to newbies, the safest bet to get at a bar when there isn't a craft option (a better choice than Boston Lager). A solid beer that everyone should try at least once."
"O - The best American Pale that is readily available both at home and in bars/restaurants."
"O - This is my favorite beer. Great anytime of the year."
"O- A refreshing classic and one of my summertime ""go-to"" brews."
"On tap at my watering hole, Old Chicago Westminster as part of their Craft Beer Week mini-tour. Poured a nice golden-amber color with a faint white head. Lacing was wonderful as it hung to the glass during the entire pint. Aroma of some citrus, malt, with some floral tones mixed in. Taste was very nice: malt, bread/biscuit, a touch of honey, with just the right amount of hop bitterness at the end. This is one of the brews that got me hooked on craft; I'll revisit this one again and again."
"SN Pale Ale is one of the classic of American craft brewing. These days, it's probably overshadowed by bigger, bolder beers. But, if you're looking for a well-made craft beer that has withstood the test of time, this is one to seek out."
"Overall would definitly drink this again as it is allways welcome in my glass, never have I seen this in 24 oz bottles in PA. Bought all they had in stock in a small lakeside store in Ohio Its like drinking a good beer and ...bonus... heres another !"
"O: The beer is very easy to drink, refreshing and is quite sessionable. I would have no problem drinking more than one of these at a time."
"DELICIOUS, TRY IT!"
"Overall - I must say that I really couldn't find anything wrong with this brew. It was tasty, looked really good, and had me coming back for more. I was really happy to find this at the gas station next to my place too. I really can;t think of a better pale ale off the top of my head. Get it...."
"Overall - A very good pale ale."
"This has been my favorite beer since 1994, and is the reason I started exploring craft beers. A very high recommendation, as this beer is consistently good and always enjoyable."
"overall: This is an excellent pale ale with a good balance of hops and malts. It's a very smooth beer that would make for a great session beer. In fact, I think I'll have one right now."
"This is the true American Pale Ale. Sure there may be better American Pale's out there but this is the stepping stone for all others. This is the grandfather and the one they are all compared to. Just a very clean refreshing ale that looks undisturbed and clings to the palate in the smoothest fashion that makes you question were another one is. I love this brew and look for it everytime I am at dinner."
"D - this was one of my first beers that I had after getting into beer in general and has only gotten better for me over time. there is no food this doesn't go with either. Thumbs up!"
"If you like their signature malt, you'll be pleased, otherwise there isn't a lot here to hold your interest compared to the dozens of superior examples of the style. Like Fat Tire, it's a good alternative to BMC at bars with poor selections or beer-geek-free parties..."
"O - This is a great tasting Pale Ale, one of my favorites. Not too hoppy and with a nice blend of malts. A great 'go to' beer if Ale's are your thing."
"Overall: good beer. No wonder it has stood the test of time. Drinks light a light IPA rather than an APA and thats definitely a good thing, since APAs typically leave me wanting more. If you haven't gotten around to this beer yet, what are you waiting for?! Cheers!"
"O: I can’t believe this beer only cost me ~$16 for a 12-pack. You can hardly find Buds for that cheap! Certainly a great deal. Like I mentioned before, though, I did have high standards for this beer. Now, I’m not going to say I was disappointed (because I wasn’t). In fact, after having this beer, I find myself wishing we had more breweries like Sierra Nevada! All in all, this is a clear example of SN’s willingness to create the best beer from whatever ingredients they have, and then putting it in the same price range as many highly-commercial counterparts. I can certainly respect a brand like that. In the future, though, I’ll pay the extra couple bucks and get their Torpedo Extra India Pale Ale if I’m looking for a PA with a great price tag."
"Cheers."
"O: A true classic. No aftertaste to speak of, the palate is left completely cleansed after each sip and ready for another. The hops dominate with just enough yeasty goodness to balance it out. Everyone should try this at least once in their beerdrinking career."
"As it warms I'm getting some more tastes from the hops other than just the orange fruitiness. I can taste some tea and herbal flavors as well which tastes excellent. Perfect craft session beer. This beer is a classic and you can definitely tell why just by the first sip of this incredible pale ale."
"O: This has always been a fantastic and historic beer, dunno why, but this one is a little off. Will admit to inflating the scores a hare based on my previous experiences with the beer."
"O: This isn't the most drinkable pale ale you'll come across due to the dry bitterness, but it's still excellent. One of the seminal American Craft beers, Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale doesn't disappoint."
"Pours from the bottle a nice amber color with a thick frothy head. The smell is pine and resin. The taste is great, a really wonderful session beer with just the right amount of hops. The mouthfeel is spot on. My introduction to great craft beer. Still a winner."
"O: This being one of my first reviews I had to do one of my old standbys you really cant go wrong with this beer."
"O- A very good go to beer and just short of exemplary for the style. You really can't go wrong with this when you're looking for something to session, on the other hand, this is not going to not your socks off in any way; just good stuff all around"
"Obviously, this beer is a classic. It is widely available and worth returning to every so often. Even though I worship the hop, I usually like my ``unimperial'' pale ales a bit more balanced than this one. Still, it tastes darn good."
"Overall, great. Very drinkable, refreshing, flavorful, exactly what I want from a sessionable pale ale. This, along with Anchor Steam, is a no-brainer as far as quality, widely accessible brews that exemplifies American craft brewing. Beautiful."
"Overall-I can see myself 50 years from now still enjoying this beer. It goes great with food too. I do my grading to style and this is definitely one of the best, if not the best Pale Ale. I would drink this next to a buddy drinking a Pliny and I would be completely satisfied."
"O: Great craft beer that is readily available. Highly Recommended."
"D/O- Drinkability on this is awesome...right up there with the best flavor&drinkability ratio there is. A gateway drug is there ever was one."
"The color, smell and taste don't disappoint. This an American West Coast pale ale and it is wonderful. It is very bitter yet quite drinkable. It goes well with appetizers, a meal or as a session beer. It is perfect on a hot day to quench a big thirst. It has so much flavor, body and smoothness for a pale ale. It’s still one of the all time great craft beers!"
"Summary: Reasonably priced with smooth and stimulating flavor and texture."
"O - Great beer for spring summer or fall, not as hoppy as an IPA, but has good flavor and is very enjoyable."
"I would suggest this beer to anyone as a stepping stone into pale ales."
"O - pretty straightforward brew, but definitley above average for the syle. A good one to always have on hand"
"The only craft beer at the restaurant that is closest to my home...I usually go for the martinis at this place, but my resurrected love of beer caused me to ask what was available. Tender reaches into the recesses of the fridge and pulls this one out; buried behind the dismal and prolific adjuncts of the world. In all the years I've been drinking beer, I've never had this one before. And now I'm wondering what the hell took me so long. This is a damn fine beer. Highly drinkable and just tasty overall."
"Nice light and crisp body on this one. The carbonation is a bit sharp on this one though. Overall a solid brew that I've had countless times. Really a good brew that I'll continue to buy."
"Easy to forget how good this beer actually is. Superbly balanced, but hopped enough to shame some lesser IPAs. Glad this is in all 50 states and around the world."
"O: Sierra Nevada is one of my go to beers when I'm not looking to spend too much. This beer doesn't try to be something it isn't... make sure to look at the date if you're buying a 12 or 24 pack; the fresher the better"
"One of the best all-around beers out there and one that I will always accept willingly when offered. One that apparently got a lot of people into craft beers, me included. Always have a soft spot in my heart for this one."
"O: one of the best pale ales ive ever had. This is perfectly done and very well balanced. Might be too hoppy for some, but for me, this is a staple in my fridge and a perfect session beer."
"Among my non-craft drinking friends, this seems to be a favorite just the same, so the beer is really offering something for everyone."
"Solid Beer."
"Drunkability: solid american pale ale. it is a good stand by because it is pretty easy to get ahold of nation wide. However, i endorse drinkin local beer, so i must say that this would taste even better if i were sippin it fresh in Chico, Cali."
"D - The beer is very drinkable and enjoyable. It holds up well despite being such an early example of craft brewing. My only complaint is a lack of complexity with the hops so dominant."
"O (D) - This is a good tasting beer that is not mind blowing in any way, but it's very good and very drinkable, and I find it to be rather sessionable. A great beer year round for sure."
"O: Just a great beer IMO. Perfect example of the APA style. I keep coming back to this beer and am impressed by how enjoyable and interesting it is. Made better because I can find it anywhere."
"I can't believe it has taken me this long to review this beer, I've only been drinking it forever. Decent pour honey amber with a white head that actually creates lacing, surprising as I usually drink this out of the bottle. Aroma is kinda hoppy I guess, more bitter and grassy and vegitile. The flavor is of pale malt, and grassy whole leaf hops, some herbacious taste and a mite of floral woody hops. Regular body, nothing special, overall it is sierra nevada pale ale. Period."
"O: Pretty standard pale ale, the carbonation and hop bitterness that first greet your mouth hide the nice malt and hop flavors that come through towards the end of each sip. Decent pale ale, won't be grabbing six packs of this any time soon, but wouldn't turn one down either, especially on a hot summer day."
"Mouthfeel is fuller than a lot of other pale ales and the finish is a good dry as mentioned earlier. Carbonation is at the right level as well. Drinkability is phenomenal, as the flavors aren't too strong, but aren't pushovers either, and the finish is easy and dry. Readily available and really good is an awesome combination."
"Overall: A very tasty ale with a very good balance between sweetness and bitterness."
"O: A great pale ale. Pretty dry and straightforward, this is definitely a favorite APA."
"Overall - Very hoppy pale but as a hophead I like it. I give this a thumbs up go grab one for yourself and give it a go."
"Overall- This is one of my all time go to beers. Is it mind blowing no but is it delicious absolutly. It is a good beer at a good price."
"The mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation. Slight stickiness on the lips. Overall it's good but not what I would consider the be all and end all for APAs. I prefer Great Lakes Burning River and Deschutes Mirror Pond."
"This is one of my ""go-to"" beers. I can enjoy this beer all year long. The appearance is on par with most other pale ales. However, the taste is, in my opinion, much better. This beer is always seems fresh with a great mouthfeel and a bold taste. If you are someone that like sweeter beers, this may not be the one for you. If you are looking to try a good pale ale to get introduced to the style, then this is a great place to start. You'll be hooked."
"Pours an appealing amber/orange with a fluffy white head. Not alot of hop on the nose but a nice malty ale with a slightly bitter finish. The bitter level on the mouthfeel is good and makes this beer. The hops were used as a bittering agent here and I dont offer much on the nose or taste. Good balance between sweetness and bitterness making this a nice beer for the style and good for a couple cold ones."
"This is a great drink for a hot, sunny Summer day."
"Overall -- While not my start, this beer was the beer that launched a thousand beer nerds, probably in the hundreds of thousands by now. Crisp, clean, and very much an antithesis to other fizzy, yellowish water that, for most craft lovers, came before SNPA. Not my favorite APA, but after having so many in the style Sierra Nevada still holds its own after so many years."
"This is probably my new favorite beer I can no longer go to the package store without picking up some sierra."
"D- Extremely easy to drink, nothing too strong but enough going on to bring me back for a few more. Nicely complex without overpowering."
"Overall, much more refreshing than I was expecting. This beer seems like it would be best outside on a hot day or after a long day of work. A solid offering that I would buy again."
"Hey, even after all this time, you still got the goods. Love ya."
"I really like the flavors in this. Uncomplicated, but still compelling. Will surely buy it again."
"D: a very common, very well made APA. i would imagine just about every user on this site has had this one at one point. not my all time favorite APA, but definitely an american classic."
"Found a bottle in the back of my fridge about 2 months after I bought the twelver. Same great taste as that day, slightly bitter with the right amount of hops. Not a beer to have more than 3 or four at a time, but a nice change of pace when I'm relaxing with some friends. Definitely a go to."
"This beer is a classic and has always been a go to beer and I dont ever see that changing."
"Overall: Probably one of the most sessionable craft beers I have yet to come across. I could drink this all day. Again, a classic."
"It's a consistent, wellmade pale. Hoppy enough and very satisfying. I didn't have many choices today but I had this one good old friend available."
"T: Citrus hops and a lot of biscuity malt. A little lemon and grapefruit in there. This is a good pale ale, just not my favorite."
"One of my go to beers as it's readily available, very affordable, and very balanced."
"To me a stronger presence than Traditional English Pale Ales, so as a representation of the style I like it. The body fits, but the flavor leaves me wanting more depth, drinkable, but not overly enthused about the next mouthful."
"the feel is very carbonated...and tingly...not bad overall"
"A nice golden color with good head retention and lots of lacing down the glass. Scent is earthy and citrusy. Taste is a nice balance of malt and hops, with a lean toward light grapefruit. Bitterness is noticeable but not overpowering. Very nice to drink and refreshing. Amazing that a beer this good can be found at the local Wal-Mart."
"O) This is my first rating since ""drinkability"" has been switched to ""overall."" This is a welcome change in my opinion. This is an excellent APA and I always enjoy it. It is a great ""benchmark-beer."""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a hazy clear golden color and produces a thick white creamy head. Head retention is above average with outstanding lacing. Smells of earthy malt, grapefruit, and hop. The mouth feel is somewhat watery , light in body but has a nice medium amount of malt flavor. Hints of citrus come through and nice amount of piny hop bitterness serves as the perfect balance for this beer. One of the best APA's that I have had. This is a classic American beer that helped save beer here in America. You can not go wrong by falling back to this American Classic!"
"D: From reading other reviews I was expecting a bit more of a hop profile with this beer. So I was a little dissapointed in that aspect. But that's not to say I didn't enjoy this beer. If this was available in Canada I would probably keep this stocked in my fridge all the time."
"Absolutely a worthy beer and not terribly hard to find either. Sierra Nevada's staple beer and great for those that love the moderately bitter pale ales."
"M&D not the best but not the worst. Low dextrin. Could use more body to finish a bit stronger. A bit watery. Very drinkable and could be a staple drinkin' beer."
"Drinkability: Really disappointed here. Had hopes of making this a go-to APA due to price & availablity. I've had much better. Just too many floaters and not enough flavor for a PA. I'll pass next time."
"The original American Pale Ale does not fail to please. This is a great beer with incredible drinkability, while still packing a fair amount of flavor and nuance into what can be a relatively boring style. Love it."
"A nice hop infused pale ale. Golden Amber poured with a huge head from my 24 oz. bottle. Nice tones of malt with a hop twist. Very easy to drink. I think it taste better right from the bottle. Light and crisp all the way through. I can see why this is their flagship beer. I love it."
"If I had to pick one beer to drink for the rest of my life, this might possibly be it."
"Cheers!!!"
"Crisp flavor and fresh smell work well with the carbonation and lower serving temperature. Sure, it's a little stronger than your typical english ale, but I keep coming back to this beer, Summer or Winter, whether I am in the mood for a refresher or a warmer, SNPA always works!!!"
"EDIT - Having this again and had to knock it down a bit on aroma and overall, since overall is no longer drinkability."
"Not for the faint of heart or those who don't who drink mostly pilsners and light beers."
"D- This is such an easy drinker. Love the flavor and drinkability. will get this on a hot summer day for sure"
"Notes: On 2011-06-17 I had this side-by-side with an Orval. It was fun to compare and contrast these two fine beers. For a day-to-day brew, I'd prefer the SNPA."
"Overall this is mine and most people who like good beers go to beer when we can't find anything else at a bar. You can almost guarantee they will have SNPA. Even when their are other beers I'll get this one. It's also the beer you can buy a case of year round and relax to at home after a hard day at work. Thank you SNPA"
"I also owe a lot to Sierra Nevada and this beer in particular to introducing me to the world of high quality craft beer. As a student in Chico, I was introduced to this beer very early and it became my most loyal study partner shortly after. Cheers!"
"Cheers!"
"D: This is definitely an easy drinker, goes down nice and easy and won't get you too messed up too fast. Good all-around beer that is widely available and well priced"
"Notes: Highly Recommended. I have come back to the Pale Ale after it was a staple in my fridge a few years ago. I love this beer and will drink many times in the future."
"The CPJ"
"Go get some! i bet you will thank me.."
"Poured a nice copper color with a little bit of head on it. Smelled like hops, not a lot else. Taste was very good. Nice balance of malt and hops with a slightly bitter finish. Good light mouthfeel. Very drainable beer. This is my first time trying it but I'll definitely buy it again."
"Light in body and very crisp, the medium carbonation helps out in the mouth feel. The alcohol isn't to high and the flavor is just right to make this a damn drinkable brew"
"This is one of the best all-around beers I've had. It is the perfect representation of a pale ale: perfect malt/hop balance and an overall fantastic flavor. Not a weak ale, but not too strong either. This flagship of Sierra Nevada is everything an American craft brew should be. A go-to beer in my house."
"D: I'm not sure you can get much more drinkable than this. This is THE quintessential American pale ale. It's delicious, smooth and highly drinkable. Perfect session ale."
"Always a solid beer. However many more interesting beers are out there for the finding."
"Drinkability: Usually excellent, although occasionally I'm in the mood for something else."
"The granddaddy of craft beers, my first what-is-this beer moment when I had some in the late 80s. It is no longer a pioneer or a wow by craft beer standards, but it has held up remarkably well as a mild, versatile, enjoyable pale ale. Pours a sunny reddish gold with a slight, quick-falling head and lively carbonation from the bottom. The aroma is pleasantly malty, with a little bread and caramel and a whiff of citrusy hops. The flavor seems almost quaint in this day of punishing citrus hops, but it is clean, crisp, slightly malty with a restrained dose of citrus hops and a mellow bitterness on the finish, with a hint of lemon. The mouthfeel is clean and a little prickly."
"Pours a golden yellow/orange with a large 3 finger head. Lacing is ok, but honestly this looks like almost any beer similar to this. No really stong smells but what is there is a bready malt with a little bit of pine. The taste is more bready malt at first, but after a while it just overbears your taste buds and it becomes a very bland malt beer. The mouthfeel is too prickly for more liking, and really brings down the drinkability after a while. It is ok for what it is, but not a great craft beer in my opinion."
"This beer is my go to. It has a great taste and is easy to get anywhere for the reasonable price. I have had this on draught as well and its even better. If you are an ale fan this is one to try or retry. I would like to try and make my own personal brew similar to this one."
"I find this beer to be close to an IPA. It's fairly hoppy, but also rather sweet and buttery (more apparent as the beer warms). I suppose that interpretation of this is subject to the taster's palate, but this is still a very good beer. I'll close with what others before me have stated - it's a very good APA. It's also definately worth trying if you haven't done so before."
"SNPA is medium body and oh so easy to drink. It is smooth and creamy on the palate with an abv slightly too high to justify it as a session beer. Sierra Nevada Pale is one of the quintessential beers that got me into craft brews."
"d - A very nice, easy drinking APA. Can definitely drink a few of these and would want to. Have had many times and will have many times again."
"Before having this I was aware of its reputation and had previously tried the wonderful Spring, Summer and Winter seasonals. Even though I had some expieriance under my belt it still shocked me. Super well balanced, perfect light use of hops and malts, really refreshing. I really wish I had tried this earlier. I gave the appearance and smell a 4.5, I wanted to give it a 4, because theres nothing spectacular about it unlike the taste and what have you. It doesn't matter what it looks or tastes like everything else makes up for it. Go out and buy you a Case. can't wait to try Torpedo."
"I'm afraid I may have done irreversible damage to my taste buds by a constant thrashing of west coast IPAs, so I must admit this won't be a regular in my rotation. It lacks what I personally look for in a beer which is a lot of flavor, every time I take a drink. The first few sips were good, and then it started to get a little bland on me. BUT WITH ALL THAT SAID, this is a terrific APA. Hard pressed to find a better representation of the style."
"Despite the uncertainty of truly liking the taste of the beer and the okay mouth feel, this is a very drinkable beer. It's crisp, light, refreshing and easy to go down. 4.5"
"D - an excellent hop-centric pale ale"
"A hopped up pale ale. Through and through. Nothing remarkable on any front except that it borders at least in taste on the mild side of IPA. I get very limited malts from this. If I'm in the mood for hops and need something light, this is a no brainer. More often than not when I look to a pale ale however, I want something a little more balanced."
"I got a six pack and had four without even realizing. SNPA is the beer!"
"An amazing pale ale. One of it's greatest characters is how smooth and well balanced the ingredients are. It does lack real bite that I'm looking for, even as pales are considered. Great beer and will be buying this one again."
"I'd be seriously afraid to be left alone with a keg of this beer."
"D: This is as drinkable as any pale ale I've ever had. Really a first-rate beer. I will keep this in my fridge."
"Verdict - Defintely a tasty and delicious beer. When I'm just in the mood to have a beer in general, this is what I reach for. I have had it several times; bottled and on tap."
"Having drank this out of the bottle I can't say much for appearance but the beer did give a nice scent. The taste was great, it was you average high quality hoppy taste however it went down and finished incredibly smooth. I watched a Youtube review from the Real Ale Guide and I have to agree with his almost warning to watch out because you can easily drink these down fast. It's that good of a beer, it has its bitterness but wonderful finishing flavor. I'd highly recommend this to anyone."
"Pours a beautiful golden amber with just a bit of sediment that sinks to the bottom of the glass. Generous 3 finger head with lots of sticky white lacing. The smell consists of malty sweetness and hoppy bitterness. Very balanced! Some biscuit and grassy floral notes. The taste is very smooth with the hops flavor topping the malt (as it should). Grassy and floral taste without having too much bitterness. This brew is the perfect example of a balanced pale ale. Medium mouthfeel with just a touch of chewiness. Very drinkable, good session beer."
"D - Highly drinkable. This is what an American Pale Ale should be!"
"D - It's my ""go to"" beer, always a 12pk available in the fridge. Good for spring and summer, or anytime really. Balanced and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: This is a classic pale ale and an excellent session brew."
"I don't know how many times I've had this, but finally time to review it. Had this at a Mexican bar somewhere in Napa at happy hour. Pours a golden orange colour with a finger of white head. Some lacing on the glass. Smells of citrus hops with some sweet caramel. Flavour has a pleasant bitterness to it. Obviously a classic pale ale."
"Overall I like this beer. I'd say if you're looking for a standard pale ale, or beer in general, this would be a go to. For me however, I feel like it's lacking in complexity. Maybe i'm just used to other styles."
"Very solid APA that is now a staple in my beer diet as it is a great value and easily available."
"D-Good drinking beer and sold company."
"D: Decent APA. Frankly, some are better, but some are worse. Where choices might be limited, this would be a solid choice."
"The beer that started it all for me... Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, and pine hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, pine hops, and nutmeg on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall as I said before, this was my gateway drug. My palate is a lot different now than it was. This brew wasn't overly great, but I can see why I started out drinking this. The flavor on this one was quite nice, it is just that the nutmeg I got on the followthrough is in no-way-shape-or-form one of my favorites. Still one of the easiest to find and better tasting Pale Ales out there in my opinion."
"D - highly drinkable; easy and enjoyable"
"D - Good drinkability; this is an excellent session beer. This is overall the best pale ale I've had by far. I'll definitely be drinking it again."
"Appearance: When poured in a glass nice head after pouring.Had a golden brown color. Smell: Had a nice aroma that was a bold fragrance of hopps. Taste: Bold taste something with a high hint of hopps. Mouthfeel: The first taste this beer started on the bold side of a strong beer. But the follow up taste mellow out. Making it very enjoyable. Drinkability: A very great beer for this last comment.It's refreshing and mellows out the more you drink."
"Drinkability: This is really one of those all-day everyday kind of beers with the nice flavors that don't wreck your palate and a pretty doable ABV that clocks in below 6%."
"this beer drinks great for a relativly affordable and accessable beverage. at %5.6 abv. it is perfect for me to drink a few anytime, and goes great with most meals."
"This was may first american pale ale of of its style and i was not disappointed. i had heard good things about this brew before and it defiantly lived up to what ive heard."
"Drinkability: Despite the poor appearance, which I chalk up to the serving glass and not the beer, this beer is an all-around good one. Went very well with the meal (Angus burger sliders and garlic green beans and I could see this going very well with many others. Very tasty beer which I could have another and another of with little complaint."
"A classic and pioneer in craft beer! Usually poured out of 12oz bottle into pint glass or on tap. Pours a nice deep golden color with a little bit of cloudiness. Aroma has the cascade hops up front bringing out that nice floral undertone. There also seems to be a little orange present in this also. The flavor is what I would consider to be probably the true American Pale Ale. The malts are present up front along with their counterpart, hops. Nice and refreshing. Following behind these two ingredients would have to be that orange I smelled earlier. There is also a little pepper and floral in the back end. Leaves a bitter and refreshing taste in the end. Good classic beer again."
"Overall a solid pale ale. Never a let down."
"Pours a clear, crisp orange amber with huge foamy off white head. Leaves plenty of lacing. Lots of tiny bubbles rising, good carbonation. Nose is light bready malts, barley, faint light citrus of hops. Smells light a creamy pale. Taste is wonderful, never have I tasted so much flavour in a plae ale! Big on a malt backbone but balanced well from the barley. Medium to light mouthfeel. Tasty and drinkable, several easily downed in a session. A standout classic American staple."
"350ml bottle (5.6% ABV) served in a pint glass"
"Drinkability is decent, but not being a fan of bitter, I may get sick of it after a few."
"A beer I do not shy from buying frequently. One of my top 10 pale ales."
"D - An extremely drinkable classic APA, would work extremely well as a session beer."
"Pours with a pretty big head into a mug. Color is dark yellow with an orange tint. Lacing left as head recedes. Plenty of hops in the nose along with a grassy smell. Taste is very intricate. Citrus notes dominate but pine and maltiness are also present. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Everything is so well balanced. I could drink several more if I wanted to."
"330 ml bottle, copper-amber colour with a thin head with not much retention and not much lace. Smell of hops, something like cheese rind and pine. Medium boyd, it holds well in the mouth, where I feel hops, citrus, spices (pepper?) and caramel. It's the first Sierra Nevada I have a chance to taste and I can say I'm not dissappointed at all, I wouldn't mind to drink some of them any day."
"Im have always lov ed this beer but hadn't had one in ages. Just picked up a sixer and am remembering why I am so fond of sierra nevada. Nice orange/tan body with a decent head. The aroma and taste are a wondeful balance of gentle hops and solid malts. This is still the best APA for me."
"It's not too viscous and not too thin and the taste lingers just long enough. I could drink this all night and I have many times. It's a classic for a reason."
"This is a solid all-around all-American pale ale. Pours a subdued, light orange and had some decent lacing. Smelled of some hops, but pretty silent in the smell department. Tasted of a nice balance between the hops and malt, a great mouthfeel makes this a great, unpretentious and drinkable APA."
"Overall: Great beer, I feel bad drinking this with 5 inches of snow on the ground, but I wouldn't turn down another."
"(Also spotted on draught at All-Bar-One in Canary Wharf, London)"
"D - Incredibly drinkable. Goes down easy and refreshing. Very tasty. Perhaps the best widely available beer around."
"D- The quintessential APA. Refreshing and easily drinkable."
"Many others rate this beer very highly, and I quite agree this is a great pale ale, or simply a great beverage of any type. It has plenty of flavor to savor, but not so much it needs to be chewed. I could sip this and luxuriate in each sip, or quaff this to quench my thirst from heat or exertion or both. I highly recommend this brew, and if you have never tried it, you gotta get your hands on one, soon."
"D - I can have one and be happy, or down a couple and savour the flavour. A great session brew"
"D: Extremely drinkable and affordable. Why drink Bud or Miller when this is around. Great brew, very serviceable and available."
"D - More please."
"Can drink these every day and is quite sessionable, is affordable and can be drank in any kind of climate at any time of the year--kinda my miller-LOL!"
"This is one of my go to beers that I normally always have in the fridge. For the price you can't really beat it."
"Pretty drinkable and worth having again."
"Drinkabilty: Very drinkable. The 5.6% ABV makes it just low enough in alcohol to drink for longer periods of time. A classic go to pale ale."
"D: This is a decent go-to brew but it isn't great in quantity because it really seems to dry the palate quite a bit."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. The beer that started it all for me, craft-wise. I feel like there should be a sixth rating category for this beer: Nostalgia. If I could, I'd certainly give it a 5 here."
"i see this beer often in various beer stores, so i figured it has to be ok,no way it can be bad for that price right?i just bought a sixer just in case it backfired...and im glad i did. appearance looked good to me,smelled of casual ale ,now being that is was out of a green bottle i figured it might taste a little tarty,skunky,little did i know my first gulp i was shocked i thought it may have gone bad or a bad batch dude this stuff tasted rotton, didnt get better as drinking went on neither every gulp was a bad experiance,i was confused why it is so highly reviewed i was sure it was a bad batch,so some time later im at this bar and had it on tap i figured id give it a second chance ,bad move even worse second time cause i paid 4 bucks for one anyway long story short drinkability a @#$%&@ zero"
"D: Distinctive, American, refreshing, and complex enough to spark your interest."
"Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is an old stand by. It's on-tap everywhere, so the ""ace in the hole"" factor is a plus. I like that it is well rounded, medium bodied, and easy to have a few of. This time around I poured it into a pint glass with two fingers of head. The retention isn't as good as Celebration, but still pretty good. The color is orange/copper. I smell hops, malt and citrus. The taste is a little on the sweet side, but there is a good amount of hop presence for a Pale Ale."
"Great body to this beer and the balance of hops and malts makes this is a great beer to enjoy all night paired with some great music."
"D - would create some mighty fine beer goggles.."
"D - Very drinkable pale. I like that a beer like this is so incredibly popular."
"My go to beer when the pickings are not right. You can't go wrong with Sierra Nevada, they just don't make bad beers. Will find in most stores or bars, even places that typically just sell Bud or Coors. In my opinion, it's what all pale ales are judged against."
"poured into a english pint sized bass glass. nice looking ale, honey gold in color with a creamy textured tan collar. head retained well. floral hop bouquet with an earthy mustiness on the nose. tastes floral and herbal up front. not too hoppy, some graininess balances it out with a nice malt presense. not shy with hops, but not too hoppy especially if you are looking for them. feels oily slick going down (resiny, hoppy oil) and has a fullish, creamy medium body. just a little ""bite"" from carbonation but for the most part quite smooth. drinkability spot on. one of the better examples of an american pale."
"All credit is due for this old soldier who helped lead the initial charge, but in comparison to current competition, somewhat uninspiring."
"D-it doesn't get any worse than the initial taste but it doesn't get any better. i've heard a lot of good things about this beer but i was really let down. this is nothing special and doesn't beat the other commonly found beers."
"Pale Ales are not my preference, but from an objective point of view, I can say this is one of the better pale ales. It is not overly hoppy or bitter as many others tend to be. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I'd certainly have another!"
"Could drink this most of the night till I needed for flav."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Great beer."
"SNPA is classic, I used to drink it all of the time, but there are still a number of Pale Ales I perfer. Still, this is a beer that EVERYONE must try at least once."
"To all my Nor Cal friends, be thankful for this amazingly cheap, satisfying beer! To everyone who has to stretch to find it, do it and enjoy."
"It's a good go-to pale ale, but isn't my favorite. However, quality wise it's right up there and quite worthy."
"12oz bottle. Pours a slightly cloudy medium orange color with a thin head. Good amount of lacing. Aromas of hops, malt, cereal and a slight citrus. Taste is a crisp hop taste with a nice amount of grains to it. Good amount of malt flavor as well. Orange peel finish. This is one of the most flavorful drinkable beers around."
"Decided to order an old reliable and try this one for the first time in a long time. Pours a beautiful, super-clear, deep gold, with a thick, very sticky off-white head. Smells like hoppy and malty goodness. Excellent malt on this one, tight and sweet. Suitable for the moderate and excellent hop bitterness. Very good balance. Easy to drink, and one of the important & best American beers."
"Drinkability: Too bitter for me, not balanced. Will not try again, might not even finish the whole bottle."
"This is comparable to the other exceptional pale ales out there. Highly recommended if you are a fan of these ales."
"Pours a crystal clear deep yellow with a hint of orange. Big foamy white head that takes until the last few mouthfuls to disappear. Lots of sticky lacings. Taste and aroma is a perfect balance of sweet malt and citrus hops. Creamy smooth with perfect carbonation. This 5 gallon keg is not gonna last long. Thanks Sierra Nevada!"
"Never bothered to review this beer considering every place everywhere has it, so I always just tell myself I'll do it next time...Well it's finally ""next time."" Pours a hazy golden-orange color with medium-large white head that slowly gets smaller, but hangs around for a while. Smell is a mellow, well-balanced citrus hop scent with a tad bit of yeast and sweet malt. Taste is just as well balanced with a nice balancing of the hops and malts. This beer is definitely my go-to beer at restaurants, simply because every place has it. One tasty brew! Mouthfeel is crisp with a nice bitter bite to it, but nothing even close to the bite an IPA should have. Good representation of an american pale ale. Drinkability is VERY high!"
"D: Really, really easy drinker. Definitely a good to staple beer here!"
"In my opinion, one of the best pale ales out there and it is easy to find."
"Taste though is much improved with a very good bread finish that is subtle. Really good finish on this beer giving just enough hops and malt/bread/biscuity chew to feel decent. Easily drinkable, with a good mouthfeel that isn't too wet and is considerably better on tap than from the bottle."
"Pours into a golden colored brew that has a white head with excellent retention, decent carbonation and very very good lacing that clings nicely to the side of my beer mug. The smell is of citrus, yeast and hops. The taste is a citrus taste at first followed by some malts and hops. It has a citrus after taste to it. the mouthfeel is a nice creamy smooth medium bodied beer with a nice crisp clean finish. This crisp clean finish also makes the beer a nice drinkable beer. I'm not a huge fan of the taste of this beer, but it does have a nice hoppy finish to it and it is worth trying for those that like this style of beer. However, a better beer to try in this style is Michigan Brewing's Mackinac Pale Ale."
"12 Oz bottle. Pours a nice golden amber hue with a nice, foamy, long lasting, white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops with some sweet malt. Flavor is grapefruit, spicy hops with a long dry pleasant finish. Medium, crisp body. Just great, everywhere available Pale Ale."
"My default choice for a refreshing bitter ale when I'm not inclined to experiment."
"D- very drinkable on any occasion."
"D-Easily a session beer that goes well with every situation. Most certainly will buy again."
"Drinkability is fairly high. This beer tastes better than your average macrobrew, but it's not a knock-out punch. Overall, a definite session beer, but one that might not be worth sessioning due to the general lack of character."
"What can I say? This is the classic APA. It doesn't get much better than this."
"Easily one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had."
"Smells and tastes like the classic brew that it is. Loads of pine and grapefruit with a dry malt profile that threatens to run away and hide altogether before returning with some light sweetness mid-swallow. A hefty bitterness that really makes this a borderline IPA (and the hoppy superior of many brews labeled as such). Finishes a little juicy, a little sticky, and with a distinct longing for another sip. Great beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"In my book this is one of the classic American Craft beers. Simple enough to be enjoyed by the masses, yet creative enough to stay interesting. This was one of my early craft beers, and still one of my favorites."
"D- Very drinkable. This is a favorite for hoppy beer lovers and still drinkable for those that are malt fans. Very well balance makes this beer top notch."
"5.6% ABV make this a bit high to be sessionable but the whole package is so darned smooth that I'd be tempted to put these away one after another. Its relative low-cost and high-availability for a craft brew only sweetens the deal. It might be the most well-balanced brew I've had the pleasure of drinking. Fours across the board."
"Cheers..."
"Drinkability - very drinkable ale. I would recommend this to anyone whether they are hop heads or not."
"Overall: A classic brew and a mainstay for any refrigerator. Its not the most memorable beer, but it is definitely not forgettable. In my opinion, SNPA is and always will be the beer that defines this genre."
"A clean drinking brew, nice hop kick and malt backbone. good one to open, drink, and repeat!"
"A very nice ale that compares to Anchors Liberty Ale. Not over powering but goes down nice and smooth. Has a soft smooth amber color and a slightly spicy taste. A nice ale that goes down nice. Has a nice amber color with an average head. I like this one very much."
"D: very easy to drink and a quality example of the style."
"Highly recommended for just about everyone. Don't dismiss this just because it's been around forever and so many great beers have been produced since its release. To me it's amazing it's remained so consistently great with such a wide distribution. Long live Sierra Nevada!"
"Drinkability: I'm not a fan of this pale ale. The review for this beer has been done with the last beer from my six pack. Typically a six pack in my frige barely lasts four days but this beer has been in my fridge for over two weeks. The off flavor of the pickle is a huge turn off. This beer is also trying to be too much for a pale ale."
"M and D- very drinkable, good all around mouthfeel, carbonation. Hoppy aftertaste and slightly bitter aftertaste. Excellent all around beer for any occasion. Relatively inexpensive, good, easy to find."
"Solid mouthfeel. Appropriate carbonation and very easy to drink. Great to have this so regularly as an option in most all areas I travel."
"Pours golden amber with a nice white creamy long lasting head. Aroma of floral hops, citrus.Taste is hops, some citrus and spice. Mouthfeel is med body, with good carbonation. Nicely balanced, goes down easy and smooth. Overall a very enjoyable and drinkable Pale Ale."
"Went great with the burger...."
"D- Nice beer to have. It's a very clean, crisp beer, I'd even call it ""refreshing."" It's nice to see a good craft beer that is widely available."
"Had in bottle, and maybe it's just me, but it was much more bitter than I expected. The bite didn't seem to be as balanced as others here have mentioned. I tried three to be sure but on my palate it was less than satisfactory. Pours great, looks great, but reminds me too much of Heineken. Maybe I got a bad batch? Would try again or maybe I can find it on draft to be sure."
"Drinkability- having another."
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with yellow hints and a light tan head. In the aroma, mellow pine hops and a gingerbread sweet malt. In the taste, same as the aroma, a bit more abrasive on the hops, but backed nicely with sweet malt. A small bite and medium to light bodied mouthfel, with a small dry, hoppy aftertaste. A bigger hop for a pale, but basic and good."
"A legendary beer in my book. If someone wants to know what US beer really tastes like (aka the Brits, Aussies, Belgians, Koreans, whoever) give them a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"I was very impressed with the draft version of Sierra Nevada. I tried the bottle version a year ago and I wasnt very impressed, I thought it was too bitter and almost tasteless...This, however, was the perfect balance of bitterness and hoppiness in my opinion. I would happily drink this again."
"An overall B+"
"Drinkability - Major props to @spinrsx for his selection and giving me this beer. He was right, this is a tremendous session beer, offers everything you'd expect in a APA and more."
"Pretty much this beer is Classy. Please try it if you haven't yet. you might finish it quicker then you think. I could drink this nonstop."
"This is just a tremendous American pale ale. The beer world has changed a lot since it was introduced back in the early '80s, and I suppose I can understand it if some people feel that SNPA has been surpassed by hoppier, more sensationalistic brews. But damn... this tastes amazing. Sierra Nevada changed the brewing world, and this is the beer that did it. If you can't dig it, it's your loss."
"Time to review one of the great-great grand-daddies of craft brewage. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Zatec fluted glass. 4 glorious fingers of spongy white head that recedes pretty quickly. Niiice lacing though. Nice golden amber color. Smells so familiar. Cascade in the house. Floral. Citrus. Classic. Full bodied, floral and medium bitterness. A little bit of citrus and skunk. Dry finish, good carbonation. One of the most drinkable beers on the planet."
"D- Something about this beer makes me want another. 12 oz. just isn't enough of this goodness."
"An easily drinkable beer in any situation, all of the flavors are very up front, making for a beer that can be truly enjoyed without lots of thought."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a beer that I consistently buy. It is affordable, easily available and tasty. This beer is chocked full of grapefruity Cascade hops in the aroma and taste. I also smell some caramel and toasted grain in the nose. The malt contribution is pretty limited though, there is a little doughy sweetness, but the beer finishes pretty clean and dry. The beer has a refreshing amount of carbonation and has enough mouthfeel carry the flavor and make for a good drink."
"This beer holds up to the best of them and actually is in the winner's circle of the best of them"
"Pours a maple, extremely clear brown with a nice thick head. smells like it tastes, fresh cascade hops, and lots of them. mouthfeel is a bit thicker than appearance suggests, still on the light side. nice carbonation. This beer is how Sierra Nevada took over"
"Pours a nice light copper color with a good white head and some pretty sticky lacing on the way down. The nose is all about the American C hops with some excellent citrus notes throughout. The taste is slightly-bitter citrus hops with a very mild malt presence in the background. Not excessively bitter, but does the job right. Drinkability is really high, as this is perhaps the most classic of all the craft beers."
"Drink- Could have had more than 1 I tell you that. Too bad for the 1hr half drive home and the fact there was none left. May have to run to the store to pick one up."
"medium-body/medium carbed mouthfeel... high drinkability score, easily a ""session"" type of brew."
"This is one of my favorite beers, and its not too much money. Great stuff. Havent had it in months, I think I need to get some more."
"D - Could definitely knock back more than a few of these in a sitting"
"Overall a very solid, tasty beer, wish I had tried this beer sooner. Seems like it would go very well with a nice chicken or fish dinner."
"I could drink this all night. It is a fantastic, high-quality brew."
"D - Infinitely drinkable, absolutely delicious."
"For my first pale ale, I'm very impressed. Not only is this an American classic, but it's a good way to get into craft brews. Definitely going to go for it again."
"Pours a dark golden hue into a pint glass with a bit of head. The smell is of sweet hops, with just a hint of malt. The taste is a mellow, slightly hoppy deliciousness. It's body is on the light side, and it's drinkability has been proven time and again. Not the best pale ale I've ever had, but one of the best, and at it's price and availability, it really can't be beat."
"An American classic. Poured into a standard ale glass, this time it was the twenty four ounce version, quite good for an extended sitting. The inimitable resiny pine character of this ale also serves to remind me that it tastes as good as its aroma. The yeast strain works magic, and I have heard the legend that this strain originally came from Ballantine. Who knows? All I know is this remains the year-round flagship brand of Sierra Nevada, and rightfully so."
"even though is pretty cold out and is in mid OCT. its still a good choice if your looking for a light tasting pale ale, not bad at all."
"D: This has and always will be one of my favorite beers. It is both the quintessential American Pale Ale and Californian beer, as well as Sierra's best beer (obviously all my opinions). I love the simplicity of it, the straight forwardness, and that it has a similar taste to all the other Sierra beers, but is the one that really stands out among the rest. Also I love that it's nearly everywhere--it's my go to beer when I'm at a bar or restaurant with a limited selection, a great alternative to the macro tripe these places often have to offer."
"Pretty good beer, I've had this many times before but just decided to rate it while enjoying a 6-pack during a football game. Definitely a good beer for any sort of occasion."
"This is probably the best widely available pale ale. A great introduction to the style that can be found just about anywhere. Highly recommended."
"Poured it in a pint glass and it cast a golden orange brew with a full beige crown. Full body, nice carbonation. Hops, citrus fruits, pine and caramel. On the palate is fairly the same as on the aroma. Crisp refreshing starts up a little dryish but then the hops and malts are loose and they linger on until the aftertaste in which the malts subside and they get replaced by a hoopy fruity aftertatse. Nice drinkability and superb balance."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability were fairly average."
"D- Easy to drink, and good all around beer. Has everything I expect for a beer, but not much more. Still, for the price and availability, this beer is more or less the craft beer drinker's lifeboat."
"I'd have to say that all things considered, this is my favorite beer. No matter what else is in my fridge, there is always at least a few Sierra Nevada Pale Ales lurking in amongst them."
"Drinkability- Very good. I wouldn't drink more than a couple pints (24 oz. is perfect), but doesn't that often define a well crafted beverage? Very good pale ale."
"A nice solid little brew to have with a meal..."
"Drink well my friends"
"D= This is a very drinkable beer basically always in stock fairly cheap perfect if you don't want to drop a lot of cash. It goes down easy and is easy to drink."
"Overall, my favorite beer hand down...i try to drink this beer as much as possible...absolutely love it"
"This beer is perfect."
"An insanely drinkable beer, and a staple in my regular line up. I get the impression that this is a slightly older bottle as there is usually more of a hop presence. Will need to be reviewed again when I know I'm drinking a fresher bottle."
"Pours a bright amber color with a two finger, sturdy cream colored cap. Small streams of bubbles and good retention. Head eventually recedes in a rain drop type of pattern to form a thin layer of foam. Aroma is of grapefruit, peaches and apricots with a sturdy caramel malt backbone. The flavor is almost identical to the aroma. Grapefruit up front with soft peach and apricot as the caramel malt comes through in the middle before a moderately bitter finish. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot on. This is highly drinkable. A nice balance with just the right amount of hops winning out to not overly assault the palate. A staple in the beer landscape."
"The appearance is clear and pale gold. When poured it has a nice creamy, long lasting head. The aroma is citrusy and piney. It also has some lingering herbal notes that add to the complexity. The mouthfeel is full, creamy and smooth. Hss great taste and easy drinkability."
"This is a very solid pale ale, pretty much sets the standard."
"Pours darker than I expected for a pale ale, its a transparent light copper color with a nice white head that sticks around for a while and leaves a little lacing. Smells of citrus and pine hops, very crisp and fresh smelling. Taste is great, starts with citrus and pine hops followed by understated sweet malts. I know its bitter, but it doesn't taste that bitter, quite refreshing. Mouthfeel is perfect, carbonation is just right too. I usually buy 12oz bottles when I try beers, today I got the large bottle (I think it was 24oz) and it was gone before I knew it."
"Overall one of the best beers on the market and the reason Sierra Nevada has been around 30 years."
"- A very approachable pale ale for newbies, I like cascade hops and their floral/citrus notes. Top of my list for a very accessible APA's. Easy to find, always very much enjoyed. Affordable @ $8 per sixer, EXCELLENT APA and a steal at the always consistent affordable pric"
"In time, you may develop a palate for extra bitter beers like SNPA. However, let me reiterate that this beer should be avoided when you're starting to try out different varieties of beer. Happy Drinking!"
"I have had Sierra Nevada before, and they continue to impress me. Definitely a brewery that I am glad to find is popular."
"Theres nothing like a good pale ale. And i would consider this beer to be the original american pale ale. It has a deep golden amber color with great head retention and a very balanced hoppy kick. Also the malt comes through quite nicely and isnt overrun by the hops. a great session brew."
"D. I like this beer and its widely stocked so its easy to get so you don't have to settle for one of the big boys"
"Over all a very drinkable beer"
"D- oh hell yeah. Not a hop bomb. Perfect gateway beer for a non-craft drinker. Super easy drinking. Great beer"
"D-the most drinkable in my opinion, their other brews never disappoint either but this one just seems to be an american classic, I love going to the brewery in Chico too, always great surprises on tap"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Slightly-heavier-than-light body with nice carbonation. Drinkable beer that has more flavor than a lot of the crap you will find. This beer is a classic and one of the founding American craft beers."
"Very flavorful and balanced beer. A really good APA."
"A solid, go-to beer. Hard to go wrong with this one, although it's not particularly exciting."
"In many ways this was one of the beers that turned me on to craft beer, and I always seem to have some in my beer fridge. Just a terrific go to beer. I pulled some out today to watch the Colts game and figured that I would check out how I reviewed it to see how my opinion of it had changed; and to my surprise I had never taken the time to review this great beer. Can't go wrong with SNPA"
"This beer is one of my go-to beers, and I often use it to introduce ""beer"" drinkers to real craft beers, usually with great results! This beer rightfully deserves its status as one of America's craft beer ""ambassadors""."
"I used to be a great fan of Bass Pale Ale, but now I have a new favorite Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"Really good apa"
"M: Oily mouthfeel with a lack of carbonation."
"6 pack for $6.99 at the local gas station. A golden amber color with a thick foamy head. smells of hops and some citrus. Very nice lacing throughout the glass. aste is very complex with some bittering, but not extremly hoppy. You don't realize how strong this beer is until you've had 2-3. I've been drinking this beer for years, but finally decided to review it. SN Pale Ale is usually the go to beer when I go to said gas station. The only other good beer they offer is Bridgeport Hop Czar."
"O: It all started here for me, and it will always have a soft spot in my heart. Not perfect, but so inviting to a wide range of palates. There is a reason they are so highly regarded."
"The predominant taste is, not surprisingly, citrus/floral hoppiness. However, they are not among the strongest I've tasted in this style of beer. They're at a pretty medium level of bitterness. Throughout the swallow, there's a creamy malt presence that sits under the hoppiness. The taste of this beer doesn't really change for me from initial taste to after the swallow. Citrus hops with an undercurrent of malt, and that's it. But it certainly works, it's drinkable, and that's part of why this beer is considered one of the best examples of APA's on the market."
"Taste-Sugared ruby red grapefruit, leafy hop bite, creamy, buttered biscuit and a pleasant hop bitterness that lingers to the finish. Very flavorful and well balanced pale that drinks like an IPA. The definitive American Pale Ale. A must for all craft beer lovers. A classic."
"Has to be one of my favoret pale ale's I have ever drank. The taste is great you could really taste the hopps and taste so good nice and cold. This makes me want to go to 7/11 and buy a 6 pack lol. There's nothing like drinking a Sierra Nevada in a open glass just go pick on up you'll end up really liking them."
"Bright, floral notes, extremely drinkable and among micros, probably the ""Cadillac"" of its type. The taste and mouth are beyond compare. The folks at Sierra Nevada have this as their flagship brew for a reason. For anyone who has not experienced this, it is absolutely highly recommended...."
"Overall - A classic go-to American pale ale, often considered the archetype of APA's. While it's definitely not the only good APA out there, it's still one of the better ones, and one of many great offerings from SN. If you like this one, try SN Torpedo too!"
"Sierra Nevada appears transparent yellowish orange with a thick white head that completely coats the glass in lacing. A well balanced brew, with hop flavors in the forefront. Really drinkable, this is a refreshing beer. The carbonation level is spot on. The flavor is simple, but well done. I have has this beer all over the country, and found it to be very consistent. This is a great beer to have around when you want something light and don't want to pillage your cellar."
"Drinkability is fairly high -- feel this is a pretty nicely balanced brew. The further down the glass it gets, the better I think this beer tastes!"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp bubbly orange with a thin barely there head. Aroma was the same crisp citrus hops I expect in a Sierra Nevada brew along with some crisp sweet malts. The taste is a nice balance of citrus hops and sweet caramel malts. The beer is medium bodied with decent carbonation, smooth and refreshing. This one certainly lives up to its status as a textbook American pale ale."
"Forgot how awesome this guy was. A PA/IPA hybrid in my book. Haven't had one of these in a while but am very glad I went back for some more. Absolutely one of the most important beers period. Never a bad choice, never reluctant to drink it either."
"This is the pale ale that all other pale ales are graded against. I have yet to find one better."
"Also good when I don't want to break the bank, but want something consistently tasty."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, not a heavy brew, refreshing. I could imagine drinking this around a campfire or while watching a football game."
"Good example of an American unfiltered pale ale. Very drinkable."
"D - I'd buy 6-ers of this stuff every weekend if it were available. I'll be sure to keep an eye out for it, because I found it to be very enjoyable. Nicely balanced hop / malt combination, and very smooth."
"D- Very nice. Could drink these all day."
"Good body with good medium carbonation, and a relatively drinkable beer. At places without great selection of brews, this and Blue Moon are the standouts of the widely available beers."
"Very drinkable beer. Perfect for a hot summer day when you just want a nice flavorful beer."
"Drinks: like a standby. To this long-time drinker, first-time reviewer, SNPA is a classic that's dependable when craft beer is scarce."
"Drinkability - a very easy drinking beer that i can drink many off."
"Poured from 12 Oz bottle with a nice foamy rocky thick white head, that slowly receded and left nice lacing the length of the beer. The color is a nice clean light amber with small trace of yeasty sediment. Smellis of toasty biscuity malt with a strong citrusy grass like hop ovetone. Taste is sweet biscuit malt up front with clean citrus hop and fuit with a nice clean dry finish of hops. The mouthfeel is light and clean and very smooth. Drinikability is very high on this beer. This is my go to beer during the summer months, great APA very nicely balanced beer."
"Very drinkable. Good example of an American Pale Ale."
"I've been drinking this for years and have always marvelled at how such a widely available beer can be so consistently tasty. But it is the mouthfeel and taste which really capture me. That citrus chewy oily hoppy quality once the beer hits the tongue never fails to activate even the most stubborn taste buds. Sure it isn't a 240 hour IPA but the balanced lingering bitterness and reasonable alcohol gives the brewer no where to hide faults. Just as well that I've never found any worth mentioning apart from the fact that it is hard to have just one. So easy to find and enjoy and so rewarding. The consensus is growing but I still don't think it gets the respect it deserves."
"Drinkability - This beer is an excellent example of an American Pale Ale, it's easy to drink, tastes great, feels great, and it's just a fantastic standard. I love this beer. When I go to the beer store to buy beer, and I can't make a decision, I always pick this. It does what I want in the right amounts."
"Kind of a fighter, this baby. So drinkable yet so direct. A statement neither overdone nor cheap. God bless Sierra Nevada, perhaps the most solid brewery in all the world. Unstoppable, beautiful ale."
"Will definitively get it again."
"D. Quite a nice interpretation of a pale ale from the boys at Chico. A BIG improvement on their Porter I just had. Also, I appreciate this beer more than when I first tried it about 5 years ago. Like their Porter it is still lacking somewhat in the aroma/palate departments but would take this offering over the Porter."
"Bottle - Nice golden, slightly orange color with white head. Citrus, particularly grapefruit and orange peel aroma. Loaded with fresh hops flavor, spicey, that good bitter smack finish. I used to prefer darker beers to American pale ales, but this beer is the one that changed my mind. This beer goes great with crawfish and pizza."
"I'd buy this baby over and over again as an everyday drinker, no doubt about it!"
"This beer is pretty damn tasty. While I'm not usually a fan of highly hopped beers, I enjoyed this one. It does have a fairly high bitterness, but its not unpleasant, and the hops give a nice pine, woody flavor, but doesn't become overpowering. I could see this beer being perfect for a camping or canoe trip."
"Golden amber colour is inviting with some really interesting citrus aromas. Very well balanced, the hops aren't overdone which makes it easily drinkable but still interesting enough to savour. Fair amount of carbonation gives a zesty feel. A renowned American IPA for good reason."
"I found this beer to be super bitter. I do like beers with a slight bitterness, but this definitely seemed overpowering. It wasn't as crisp as i expected and the aftertaste was bitter in combination with the beer. I traded it for something new and couldn't finish the first one"
"Golden amber with thin off-white head. Crystal clear, leaving lots of lacing. Nose of earthy woods-y skunky deliciousness. Palate is crisp and bitter right off the bat. Woody hops, piney but not a lot of citrus. Some pink grapefruit or grapefruit zest anyway. Bitter bitter, bitter, but somehow insanely drinkable. Can drink this all night. I think it's because it's so clear."
"Sure it's not a hard to find or hopped up monster but anyone looking into geeting into craft beer or just chilling having a nice regular craft brew can do no wrong here."
"Poured into a pint glass with a nice big sticky yeasty head. Has strong citrus and floral hop smells with yeasty smells too, mmm. Strong hop-forward ale, with sweet notes. Strong carbonation in this moderate bodied beer. I drink tons of this poop, it's great."
"Finger and a half white head, medium dissipation with above average lacing. Clear amber body, multiple streams of carbonation. Pretty big hop presence in the nose, floral, a a bit of citrus and resin, significant hop bill balanced by caramel/crystal malts. Taste mirrors nose, this is certainly one of the more hoppy APAs you'll find, bordering the IPA category. Smooth clean mouthfeel with good effervescence, a hint of stickiness. Tres drinkable. My buddy called this beer ubiquitous and for good reason. A standby whenever you travel, you know this is gonna taste good. Recommended."
"12 ounce bottle. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Maybe the one beer that got me into craft beer 10 years ago or so. Pours a light golden amber with a nice fizzy white head. Looks beautiful in the glass. Aroma is light citrus and grassy hops with some nice caramel malts in the background. First taste is both familiar yet arresting at the same time. Just a brilliant brew. There's this great oily and piney hop character in the body and in the finish that's played out perfectly by the sweetness in the malt body. Wonderful semi-sweet finish. I've been getting back into Pale Ales recently, and this beer is probably the perfect example of what I'm looking for in the style. I really like this beer a lot, and tasting it again for the first time I've fallen back in love with it all over again."
"Everything in this brew is fine-tuned to perfection. There is definitely a reason it's so widely seen as the standard-bearer for pale ales."
"drinkability: Very drinkable and a great session brew."
"Moderate carbonation and a light mouthfeel. Sweet caramel malt flavor followed quickly by a mild grapefruit bitterness. Nothing too assertive, but well-balanced, light, and easy-drinking. The hop profile wasn't quite as lemony as Sierra's Summerfest, but this one was equally suited to a summer evening."
"The body is medium with decent carbonation. I'd actually prefer a little more carbonation, but this is certainly respectable."
"Prost!!"
"There's a reason this beer is the benchmark for the style. Totally smashes the Old World definition of pale ale."
"a surprisingly good beer when it sits. i've had this before and it wasn't so promising. this has been sitting around for about six month and spread the hop range. nice citrus... not astringent but a nice mild apple and grape along with the floral clean palate in the finish. although the carbonation is sufficent... the malt is too lean for the yeast quality and it has a fingernail yeast flavor. although its extremely easy to find."
"I would drink this beer again and feel it has incredible potential for food pairings. I would pair this with seafood and some chicken dishes."
"Summary: This is the one beer that really got me into American craft beer. Absolutely one of my favorite ales. This beer provides really fine balance between the malts and ends with great hop bitterness. Everything one would want in an ale. Excellent!"
"Drinkability - This is a fantastic American pale ale. An extrememly drinkable well-balanced beer."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Crystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Citrus hop nose. Flavor is citrusy, no sweetness, light bitter hop finish. $1.60 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Drinkability: The beautiful golden color with an intimidating head, and the complex flavors presented in the taste, create an absolutely excellent pale ale. This will be kept in my fridge as often as it is sold."
"D: With or w/o food, this is the classic American you can't go wrong with because of it's versatility with different cuisines and crisp refreshing drinkability."
"I am reviewing this at a party. This has a a nice cascade hop smell with a nice pale malt back end. Citrusy and spicy. Orange peels and corriander. Good solid amber colr decent heas. Great on a summer day. Its a good beer with good drinkability. All around solid."
"The quintessential example of an APA, SNPA is simple yet brilliant, and one of the beers that got me into craft beer in general. The perfect pale ale for a hophead as well as a great stepping stone to the world of hoppy beers."
"Overall, this is a very good, very balanced pale ale, and one that I enjoy drinking in a number of situations. A classic of American craft brewing."
"I highly recommend this beer!"
"A great example of the style. Would be a terrific go-to beer (if we would ever get this in Ontario, that is...) Great pick up."
"Drinkability is okay for me. Maybe I was spoiled by having Nugget Nectar first, but the bitterness was just a bit unbalanced, at least in my admittedly inexperienced opinion. It was by no means overpowering, just a little too... present in the taste without much else complexity. One is all I'd think I'd have in a given night."
"All in all, this is a solid brew. A nice light summer drinker. I love big beers, but if I had to drink a light style, this one might be a way to go. Good to try if you can."
"Bought a fresh 12-pack at the grocer store so felt was a fair time to finally review this ale. Definitely a classic beer which for me defines the pale ale style. The beer looks like a pale golden color, pours out with a lot of carbonation and effervescence. Nice thick head and clinging lace from the abundance of American hops. There is always some residual yeast in the bottom of the bottle from the bottle fermentation; I like this, and I try to swirl it into my glass. Smells like, well, hops and some biscuity maltiness, and despite the strong presence of hops I feel this beer is well balanced and very drinkable. This is a great beer to introduce the beer neophytes to the greatness of hops, and fortunately is widely available everywhere. God bless America."
"Just new to the beer market. My brother in-law bought me a six pack of the Pale Ale to try out. By far, some of the best beer i've tried. I've tried a few Pale Ales, but none quitt as good as this brew. Would like to try more of the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. beer. Would highly reccomand this beer."
"An all-around winner pale ale!"
"D - I didn't have enough to really tell on drinkability, but I do know that it didnt fill me at all. That combined with 5.6% ABV and I would imagine this is a great session beer if you're used to the hops."
"D-This is a great alternative for fans of IPA's who are also looking to lower their alcohol intake, carbohydrates, and calories while holding onto some of the attributes that make IPA's such flavorful beers. It's becoming increasingly easy to find across the country which makes it a beer staple for those living in fringe areas with limited choice or traveling by vehicle. I purchase a lot of different quality beers over the course of the year, but this has become in a sense my house beer. I would not only buy it again but have been doing so for some time."
"D: One of the most drinkable APAs and great for being available anywhere."
"D - Want hops, but don't feel like dropping a ten-spot on a bomber of some tongue-walloping, ultra-limited imperial? This is your fix. Always a classic and available in the average grocery stores of just about every town of any significance nowadays."
"for me this beer was bearable for about half a glass and after that i had to struggle to drink it."
"Easy drinking, thirst quenching classic beer. Always enjoyed."
"D- It's definately a very drinkable beer. It would be one of my choices for a session. I would recommend this to someone who isn't familiar with pale ales or is used to American macros but it's also enjoyable for a seasoned pale ale vet."
"Highly drinkable pale ale with a great bottle conditioned carbonation. Good hop presence for a pale ale but not overdone."
"This is the beer I would recommend to anyone who wanted to try a pale ale for the first time. The hops is a little mild for my taste, however, the smoothness and quality keeps me going back. This is just a well put together beer."
"D- Very drinkable, a midpoint between a session and an IPA. I'd reccomend it to timid macro-drinkers and Pale Ale enthusiastes alike."
"D: A decent choice for a session beer; and a good choice for a keg during a summer cookout. I know I'll recommend this, to any casual beer drinker. Not something that amazes me by any means, but a solid pale ale, to be sure."
"The mouthfeel is fairly thick, but not overly heavy. It is very smooth with a slightly below average amount of carbonation. This beer is very drinkable, goes down so easily, and is something I'll go back to again and again. Always a good buy, and so refreshing after a hot day."
"Overall I like this beer and if I find it in the midst of the other normal in-restaurant-beers I will drink it gladly."
"Enjoy. -T"
"D: It's a great standard for Pale Ale and a bar for new breweries to try and reach."
"Drinkability- This is supposedly a classic example of the American Pale Ale, but it's a tad too acidic compared to others I've had. It's good, but it's not something I would drink on a regular basis."
"D: The quality of this beer is undeniable. Sierra Nevada has done a great job of finding the best and freshest ingredients, and it shows. It's approaching on too bitter for my taste, but I imagine fans of hop-forward beers love it. In any case, it's completely easy to drink and very refreshing for any occasion."
"Overall: Overall I thought the beer was pretty good. Nothing spectacular... there are definitely better IPAs out there. But a pretty good beer overall."
"D- A very solid brew and super easy to drink. I don't think there is really anything I can say about this one that hasn't alredy been said."
"D: such a smooth malty beverage, you can pound these all night long"
"One of my favourite American Pale Ales. Highly recommended."
"If I could improve this beer, and I wouldn't really try, I would like the head to last longer and lace better. I would prefer a more robust color. But, aren't those incredibly minor wishes? Taste, Aroma, Mouthfeel, that's where the action's at, and that's where this beer excels."
"Faint citrus hop taste upfront followed by a sweet, refreshing malt and the hops come back around for the finish to complete the cycle. The malts are top notch and makes the beer. Incredibly well balanced, drinkable and well done. A classic American Pale Ale"
"This is Sierra Nevada's flagship beer for a reason. It can be a session beer or an accompaniment to a gourmet meal (or pizza or burgers)."
"Overall: This is my go to beer when I'm at a bar/restaurant when they don't have more intriguing options available. This is probably the best widely available beer in America. Sierra Nevada never disappoints."
"D- Very drinkable, especially in the summer. It always seems to leave me feeling refreshed but then reels me back in for a sip seconds later."
"D- this is a very drinkable beer. It's so crisp and flavorful that it goes down easily. However, the primary properties of the brew (citrus/pine notes) make it so it can't be dunked all at once. This is a great example of the American Pale Ale... scratch that, it's the primary APA out there. In my opinion, this is a great brew to share with others dazzling in entering the craft beer world. I'm not the first to say that of course"
"Carbonation level is good, refreshing and very drinkable. Not much I can say that already hasn't been said. A classic, pleasantly hopped pale ale that is easily among the best of it's kind. One of the best, most legendary session beers."
"I'm not worthy to pass judgment on this ale which has long stood as a symbol of uniquely American craft brewing. Let me just add my note of appreciation for this fine and delicious drink."
"D - Nicely balanced, highly drinkable pale ale."
"Drinkability is fairly decent, IPA is probably my least liked beer style (Gasp!), however, the not-overly bitter nature of SN Pale Alr made it fairly drinkable for me, especially in these hot summer days. This is a staple of the IPA style, nothing bland, but nothing over the top. I most likely won't buy it again (Due to my style preferences) but I won't turn one down."
"O: I highly enjoy this beer. It was actually the first beer I ever had (wont say what age). But now that I actually know what I am looking for in a beer, I can appreciate everything that is going on with it. Only suggestions for improving this beer based upon style guidelines would be more in the mouthfeel. Possibly more malt character/presence."
"Good example of an American Pale Ale."
"Obviously an American classic. Ironically not my favorite Sierra Nevada beer, but a very respectable brew."
"d- Can drink this all night. Thirst quenching, except it makes you thirsty for another one!"
"RIP"
"enjoy."
"D: This is a classic pale ale that's still quite good. It has lots of hops but is also decently balanced with malt. It has nice body too and is easy to drink. Not super exciting, but solid in every facet."
"Drinkability. This is a very easily drinkable beer. I really like it. This brew is perfect for spring and summer. The smell is the prominent aspect of this beer in my opinion. I will definitely pick this up again."
"I found that this ale is very upfront with the hops and keep them kicking throughout the entire beer and well after each draught. However the medium body and crisp finish make this a very enjoyable beer on a summer day. Quite delicious."
"D - Superb. Expertly crafted, balanced brew."
"Drinkability: This is a great beer. Lots of flavour, not too heavy or bitter."
"Without this beer, the craft beer worldwide might not be where it is today. To many of us beer geeks this may not bring the excitement of an Imperial IPA, but it is a damn solid beer. Even though it isn't technically sessionable this would make a good all nighter."
"D- Very drinkable one of my favorite pale ales, actually one of the first micro brews I have ever drank about a year ago, and oh what a journey it has been."
"D-still a great beer after 9 months or so on the shelf; I'm sure its better fresh, but it was still very enjoyable; a staple beer in anybody's beer fridge"
"SNPA is a great accomplishment. Plus, it was one of the first beers that I ever drank, years before I would drink another craft beer, and it's shaped my view of beer. I have no idea how to rate it because it's essentially my yardstick for every APA, IPA and DIPA that I've ever tried. Anyway, it's a darkened amber color with a wonderfully foamy head. The aroma is a wonderful combination of piney hops and caramel malt. The flavor starts sweet and finishes dry and hoppy. Mostly clean mouthfeel with a touch of slickness in the aftertaste. The finish has a healthy dose of hop bitterness for an APA. This beer is an absolute classic."
"D: 6 of these will not make it through the night in my fridge!"
"Drinkability: An American classic that I could session. A nice and light beer that is perfect for outdoorsy activities."
"Its availability is a great upside."
"It's my go to beer if all my other choices are BMC's..."
"drinkability - very smooth and enjoyable, good flavor, not overly complex but well crafted"
"d - Again, great, smooth beer that's readily available on tap and in the bottle."
"Drinkability: This is definitely a sit around and drink a sixer beer. This is my go to when looking for a relatively cheap beer that I can drink all day. While the ABV is not technically in the ""session beer"" category, it's one beer I tend to session on a hot summer day."
"D- This is the quintessential american pale ale. In my opinion the best widely available beer on the market"
"D - Not something I'll have every day, but the not bad for a pale ale. Wanted to try this since it got such a high average review on here, but not a beer I'll keep stocked in the beer fridge."
"It had been awhile since I've had one of these, and my memory was better than the bottle I just tasted. Maybe I got an old bottle (trying to give them the benefit of doubt.) I doubt anything has changed at the brewery. Beer looked golden-copper colored with a white head and nice lacework on the glass. It had a resiny, pine-like aroma. The hop bitterness was lacking and it tasted more sweet than usual. Not as dry as I remember. This beer was balanced - in a bad way. It normally finishes more dry. Maybe the bottle-conditioning never took off on this batch or this bottle. I'll try again soon."
"tons of flavor, easy to drink, always enjoyable."
"O- This was a pleasant beer to drink. They don't lie on the label when it says ""purest ingredients"" and ""finest quality"". A truly enjoyable beer to drink!"
"Overall, a great beer that I picked up on a whim and really enjoyed. I would definitely pick up another sixer in the future."
"I'm finishing this review so I can start on my second Sierra Nevada. Cheers!"
"Notes- From growing up in CA, Sierra Nevada has always been near the top of my list as far as breweries. It's impressive to see how much they've grown and good on them for continuing to make great beer on such a large scale. Overall an outstanding beer that you would not want to miss."
"A great, considerably bitter, beer that I have a hard time imagining you'd get tired of."
"I poured into a pint glass to two fingers of off white head. I noticed to yeast in the bottom of the bottle after I read that it was bottle conditioned on the label. It has a nice golden hue. It has a nice hoppy aroma. The malt comes through as I drink. The taste doesn't quite match the aroma. There is the malt backbone with some hops. I guess I'm just so used to IPA's and DIPA's. This is a really drinkable beer. I put it right up there behind Burning River as far as APA's go."
"This is my favorite style of beer, and although not my favorite of this type, I can see why it is so popular. Nice balance of hops, ABV, aroma, mouthfeel, etc. Overall a great beer and definitely something I would not turn down if given the chance."
"d: the balanced body sets this one up for great drinkability - a classic pale"
"D - An excellent pale ale. This is pretty close to being a session beer IMO. I could easily slug back a sixer in a night. A great all round example of this style."
"Beer pours a clear copper color with a full head and good carbonation. The aroma seems to hint of herbal with citrus. The taste is crisp and bitter up front with a trace of citrus. The feel is creamy, quite smooth and refreshing and finishes dry. This is a nice drinkable brew and one of my default brews when I want something comfortable, not overpowering."
"D - Very frequently this is the best option in the 'house'; restaurants, ballgames, non-beer festivals, concerts, etc. For that reason alone, if you don't like this beer, you should learn to."
"Pours a golden yellow color with one finger of fluffy head that lingers a long time. Great hoppy aroma with some sweet malt notes in the background. The hop aroma is crisp and piney. Taste starts out right up front with a nice, medium body and a touch of sweetness before the hops just blow everything else away. While bitter, it is in no way harsh or unpleasant, helped out by good carbonation and a nice crispness that really brings the flavor out and intensifies the aroma. Finish is lingering with a earthy bitterness. One of my favorite Pales."
"Pale copper in color with lots of carbonation and a bit of head which is retained nicely, leaving good lacing. Smells of hops, for sure - plenty of citrus and pine notes, which a touch of caramel maltiness in the background. Tastes about the same - great hop profile with mostly pine notes. Caramel and bready malts come through nicely making for a balanced, easy to drink ale."
"D=This Pale Ale is delicious from a beautiful pour to a great finish. Easy drinking and flavorful. I didn't try this for a long time and now regret that. At $2.99 a bomber I'm gonna be drinking alot more of this."
"D- I could drink this in a pinch or out of convince, purely out of convince, this is a large supply in my basement."
"Pours a light amber color with a small head that leaves a good bit of lacing. The smell is very hoppy, with citrus notes and also a noticeable caramel presence from the malt. The taste is very hoppy but balanced out with some malt sweetness. A little bit of citrus is there too, but not as much as there is in the nose. Lots of carbonation too. Very clean crisp finish and very drinkable."
"D- well its my go to regular bar beer, its so available, easy to enjoy, its got tons of flavor, and cheap. What's not to like."
"This is a great pale ale and despite being a top tier brew, I can find this in amongst even the crappiest of bars and I go to town!"
"D: As always, one of my favorite beers, and a great choice for most any occasion, a great pale ale, and deserves great recognition. Pick a case up."
"Overall: Arguably, this beer is (in my opinion) one of the ""Big Three"" beers that facilitates the conversion of great number of Bud/Miller/Coors drinkers into craft drinkers (the other two being Sam Adams Boston Lager and Guinness Draught). I wonder how many hoppy APAs and IPAs exist today because of the success of this beer. Regardless, it is a reliable, widespread, well-crafted pale ale that can be used as a benchmark to rate others against. This beer promotes beer advocacy, and on that note... it is a great beer!"
"Overall: I know this craft beer has gained a followig. While I would not rave about it, if you find it cheap, try it. Thumbs up."
"D- A great ""go to"" west coast style APA, done as right as you can get, crisp, refreshing, but with enough kick, and caramel malt to balance it all out. Every time I have one...I want another one, that certainly defines drinkability...Between this and Anchor Liberty...they really IMO set the standard for what an APA should be..."
"This is my favorite session beer. Not too heavy and it's crisp and refreshing properties makes this a dangerous beer to have around in cases. They just keep going down and down."
"Old Standby. Very reasonably priced and great taste. Will always have a spot in my fridge."
"This is an easy beer to fall in love with. It's medium bodied nature lends itself to great sessions, as does it's low ABV of 5.6%, as compared to other hoppy pale ales and IPA's. A great beer overall and I highly recommend picking up a six or twelve to enjoy during the coming summer months."
"Great drinkability on this one. Another good beer to ""session."""
"D: This is an easy to drink APA. This is a beer I use as a 'gateway' beer for non-micro drinking friends to get them into craft beers."
"Clear and copper pour with a fluffy white head. Hops are certainly apparent, but pretty tame. Scent mostly dominated by citrus, specifically orange peel. You also get some sweet caramel malt aromas. It's pretty refreshing. A nice session beer for sure. The citrus hops are most noticeable just as in the scent. Caramel, bready malts come in toward the back. Finish is crisp and clean."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is my favorite beer. It took me a long time to realize this, and the reasons for this statement are long and boring. I say this is my favorite beer on the basis of aesthetic, economic and contextual terms."
"I'm not a huge fan of pale ales, but this one really works for me. I went with this for the first of my 5 gallon shell series, and I was happy I did. Sierra Nevada has a wide appeal to people. I won't order this at every bar I go to, but I'll drink it again."
"The first time I drank this beer (UC Davis keg party in '93) I was a senior in high school, and I hated it. I asked the party host if he washed his cups because the beer tasted like it had soap in it. What a noob. . ."
"Very eazy and likeable."
"Drinkability - Overall very good. Drinks a bit below its abv. Its simply a very solid beer with some slight additional bitterness and citrus overtones."
"This beer is hard not to like unless there's a component of it that you're allergic to. Goes great with all sorts of summer food fare, but has enough backbone to justify just drinking it because you like it. Quintessential APA, and a great brew."
"overall its a really well crafted beer and one of the best APA's I have ever had perfectly drinkable for all year round but I like to drink this spring and summer and maybe some fall but not as much during the fall."
"This is an APA I really like, to be better it could possibly have a little more maltiness. But good for both drinking and to (spicy) food."
"D: Exceptional indeed. A great beer for drinking, sharing, and enjoying. Especially nice in warm weather or after a long day. Highly recommended."
"D - Very enjoyable, refreshing and drinkable beer."
"D - A beer to savor, a six pack would do me just fine"
"The perfect sessionable APA."
"SN's flagship is just that for a reason, it's a great one to keep in the fridge when you need a ""comfort beer"" after trying out double/triple IPAs, etc. Great stuff."
"Orange colored with a slight head when poured into my glass. I like the smell of citrus and obvious hop action. the taste is just alright to me though, I like pales and ipa's for that matter but this one just didn't hit it home for me on taste. I feel like there was something off or just something in it that I didn't like. Anyways a good beer that I will drink again someday down the road."
"Good looking beer. Hazy copper tone with orange hues. Big fluffy head. Decent retention and lacing. Smells good. Floral, citric and a little soapy. Has a strong hop bite with a mild grapefruit flavor. Nice clean, dry bitterness. Good mouthfeel from the medium body and soft carbonation. Very drinkable to say the least. Lovely beer and is usually a go-to beer at alot of chain joints."
"Very solid beer that I haven't had in a long time. This is definitely gonna be in my top 5 when I'm looking for a six pack."
"Pours a clear, light copper with a big foamy head that quickly recedes and leaves spotty touches of lace all over the glass. Aroma is slightly bready and is dominated by floral / citrus hops. There's a light touch of caramel malt in the taste, but this is quickly overtaken by the citrus hop / lasting grapefruit rind bitterness. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side; its a fairly drinkable and refreshing ale. Here's to the brew that is the ""gateway"" for many of us craft beer geeks -"
"Pours a clear orange color with a white head. The aroma is citrus hops with a lot of orange notes. The flavor is orange and other citrus with a medium amount of bitterness. High carbonation and a medium mouthfeel. An American classic that never disappoints."
"D - I could drink a bunch of them and I will considering it was on sale for $12 for a 12 pack."
"Deliciously refreshing Pale Ale, perfect beer for warming weather. You really can't go wrong with one of these."
"A standard-bearer for the American craft beer industry, and always a reliable go-to beer for pretty much any situation. Helps bridge the gap for all types of beer drinkers. Bottom line is, if you want a quality Pale Ale, this is your 'man'. The craft scene is flooded with PAs now, and I fear this one is often taken for granted, but I still use this beer as a benchmark when judging other Pale Ales, including the ones that I brew myself."
"D - Very easy to drink and could drink a lot of it. I enjoy this brew very much. It's always a good stand-by. I like that they put it in a bomber for a cheaper price...more incentive to buy (even tho i'm really paying more for less)"
"Solid brew from S.N."
"Finger plus of white foam, medium sized bubbles pop here and there, slight retention, settles into a thin layer across the surface, not much stickiness in the lacing. Coppery orange to yellow in hue, hazy, lighter and more transparent around the rims. The herbal hops get out in front of the pack in the nose, the white grapefruit, orange pith follows behind, grainy with a spicy edge, more lactose than florality or maltiness, sheer activity seems to be its strongest aspect. Medium-bodied plus, here its relative lack of movement gives it more gravitas. Sweet touch to the orange, grapefruit citrus, floral dimension a bit stunted. Malts undistinguished, smooth things texturally but don't add much flavor, light brown sugar. Peach, apricot fruit demure. The bitter residue left behind through the finish actually gets you thirsting for more. Never as good as when you remembered it as a kid but not bad either."
"(D)- A superb example of the style. An easy drinker for sure. Not overly bitter, malty, or dry, but just right. Always a great summer APA in my opinion."
"D= very drinkable if you enjoy strong hops-bitter ales. I tend to prefer Lagunitas Pale Ale in this category, however."
"Great beer, another hit from Sierra Nevada."
"A bright, brownish-gold color with a small pure-white head. Retention is lacking with only the finest amount of lace. It takes a pretty aggressive pour to get some head. Aromas are faint but pleasant nonetheless. Ditto that on the flavor. You get what you'd expect basically but in small amounts with a good balance between fruit bitterness and pine with some herbal hop notes and just enough malt to hold everything together. The body is mediumish and the feel is slightly undercarbonated. The thing that this beer has going for it is that it's balanced exceptionally well, but it isn't going to knock anyone's socks off. I really wanted more out of it particularly from the hops. This is definitely brewed with the larger market in mind. That being said, it's not bad, there's nothing offensive about this beer at all and I think it's a good training wheel pale ale but fans of more flavorful styles of pales will be well suited to look elsewhere."
"Poured into a pint glass, orangy golden color with a white bubbly head. Light mango smell, not much in the way of lacing. Taste is crisp and refreshing, fairly light body. Citrusy with a light piney hop. Awesome example of an ultra-drinkable pale ale."
"Good carbonated mouthfeel, very drinkable. Probably falls within your definition of session beer (if not, don't nag), and is easy to drink."
"D - A solid pale ale that is very drikable. Great session beer."
"Solid, very drinkable beer, especially sitting at 5.6%, this makes it almost a poor man's IPA."
"D: A lovely beer that went down very well. Had I had a second bottle I would probably save it for another night."
"I enjoy the simplicity of this brew. It is a true pale ale and tries to be no more. Well-crafted and just what I hoped it would taste like."
"This is, as i'm sure it was for many others, a beer that starter my path to quality beer. It is a good example of a west coast apa and is probably one of the most widely distributed micro's on the planet. This is the beer you turn to when you are at a bar looking for what they have on tap. budlight, miller light, mgd, schiltz (really?). I'd rather hook up with the larger, one-eyed, one and half sized, woman-beasts at the other end of the bar. SN pale ale! thank god, my savior! WHen you say micro or craft beer to the general person this is what they think of and that's not a bad thing. This is a good front runner for craft beer. It has a good hop profile, a decent body, and overall it's a respectable beer. I will not turn it down at a party and I will not frown on a guy who brings a 6er to a party. good beer, great brew co!"
"Mouthfeel - Smooth, crisp with a medium body."
"Notes: Really nice hoppy beer with lots of flavors but not overly hopped. Great widely available hoppy beer. Great beer to have for everyday drinking."
"had my fifth SN pale ale tonight thought id have another for reviewing purposes and same as always it goes down very smooth very clean light hops aroma with a piney finish taste. even though i love this beer i do think its an extremely drinkable all around beer just a bit hyped maybe?"
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, looked like a traditional pale ale, with not a very large head. It had a hoppy smell, that was pleasent. It had a very ""dry"" and hoppy taste, exactly what you would want out of a pale ale. It didnt leave much of an aftertaste and was easy to drink. Overall it was a great beer, deffently worth trying, and enjoying more then once."
"Drinkability - I want an other one!"
"Value: Considering you can get this beer at most fern bars and lots of gas stations, this widely available brew is hard to deny as being a serious bargain at under ten bucks a six pack."
"Sierra Nevada APA is pretty drinkable, and overall is a classic beer that will never get old."
"D: Top flight here. I can drink 4-5 of these in a sitting without batting an eye."
"pours a deep golden yellow with a pretty white head. mmm. can't beat northern cali. hops. dank. nose is dominated by sweet and citrusy pine hops. tastes is mildly tart/sweet with a slight bitterness bite finish that is very welcomed with the sweet. high carbonation, medium body. the perfect pale ale in my opinion because it is practically an IPA."
"Taste is very creamy, crisp and smooth. Very hopy for a ale ale. But it's really an amazing beer and one of my all time favorites."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a glass mug. Developed a nice white head that went down to a creamy lace that sticks around. It has a clear honey like color. Smell is slightly citrusy with a little spice. Initial taste is citrus with good hops, turns into a nutty biscuity taste. The after taste is a bit of malt. Very well balanced. This one has high drinkability. Its February now, but I think this would make a great summer beer."
"Notes: I had one of these with some asiago, jack, and cheddar on sweetish, bready biscuits. The combo was fantastic."
"D: At 5.6%, there is very little alcohol burn as it goes down."
"Notes: For some reason, I remember that this same exact beer tasted a lot less hoppy and bitter when I had it this past weekend. One big difference is that I did not pour it into a glass last time, but this time I did. It is amazing how much the drinking receptacle can change the experience of the beer. I much preferred this beer IN the bottle. The bitter hops were more balanced by the malts."
"D - It's been a while since I've had this beer, and I wanted to review it to make sure it was as good as I remember it. It definitely is. This is an excellently crafted, well balanced beer that still deserves high recognition."
"RJT"
"Notes: A very good pale ale, that definitely finds its place under an IPA. It doesn't try to be an IPA like some do. It looks amazing and tastes good. Just a solid beer."
"D-well done pale ale, this was the beer that got me started into craft brews. it goes down smooth and easy and brings a nice balance of pale malts and citrusy hops."
"Notes - There's not much I can say about this beer that hasn't been said already. This is a classic pale ale, and if you like hops, or are trying to get into the hoppier stuff, this one should be on your list."
"Classic in every way."
"I had this on tap and I'm looking forward to trying this again fresh from a bottle."
"Mouthfeel is spot on, as is drinkability."
"D - Refreshing and very very drinkable."
"All this is relative, however. SNPA is SO far ahead of the light yellow upbiquitous mainstream American beers, and in fact, way ahead of the top European imported Lagers. And it's American and available. So, go for it."
"I'll continue to find this beer underrated, but look forward to trying some other SN to see what all the hubbub is about."
"D: Very good. I could drink a case of this."
"Common as water stateside, but very difficult to come by on this side of the border. Tastes pretty much like my favorite local hopped-up Pale Ale (Full Moon), so I can't help but like it a lot."
"I think they did it perfectly, any more or less could have taken this down a notch or two."
"Probably one of the most underrated beers simply because it is so readily available, but definitely a top-notch APA"
"D- a great session beer, easily drinkable, this was one of my favorite go-to beers for quite a long time and is still high on the list, as it's readily available."
"Drinkability: this is the most sessionable and consistant pale ale out there. its one on its own and every other pale ale should strive to compete with this one because its setting the bar very high."
"Body: Light-Medium on the palate, lighter on the finish."
"Notes: While I´m not too big a fan of the style or of this particular brew it is a very welcome and reliable presence in otherwise mediocre menus out there. Years ago I used to go quite a bit to it in run of the mill corner stores that would offer something to stay away from the macros, and in a way this is one of a handful of beers that really got me initiated in the US craft offerings. Although lately it is barely ever in my fridge, it remains solid and pleasing."
"quite a nice beer, a good solid all night drinker."
"D- very sessionable. Bitterness stands out as almost being offensive. The APA style is not something I'm accustomed to which may have put me off a bit. I can see why this is a classic."
"(d)- I typically reserve pale ales for mid-flight, but this one might be the exception. Goes great with normal foods and isn't as heavy as it seems. For a pale ale I can see myself drinking a fair amount without the palet going crazy. Around 40 IBUs so its just in that range where its not too much to notice on a busy night! (4.5/5)"
"as I'm sure it would be refreshing in the heat."
"SNPA is a great beer, maybe even exceptional. Bet these reviews were a lot better before it became so popular."
"Drinkability: pretty drinkable. Tried this out at band practice last week and it seemed to go down pretty well. It is probably even better with a burger outdoors in the summer."
"Drinkability: One of the most refreshing beers ever. Keep coming back for more! I'm not a hop-head and this beer has just the right amount. It's bitter without being bitter. This is one I'll be coming back to. All I can say is, ""Very nice!"""
"D: Very drinkable, due to the dry clean finish. As everyone on here seems to say, this beer is on tap at many bars, and is a great choice when you don't have the wide craft beer selection."
"A very sessionable brew. This beers light body, and creamy finish have me looking for more."
"This is only my second brew from SN and I was a bit gun-shy (so shy in fact that not until a neighbor gave me this one did I venture forth...). The first was Bigfoot, which was not a welcome brew as it was more like biting into a grapefruit rind then getting punched in the back of the head. This beer is much more reasonable and I'm now willing to try more from SN."
"There is almost always at least a few bottles of SNPA in my fridge."
"Drinkability: very easy to drink I can drink these all night long I love them."
"Tasted at Caesar's Palace in Vegas, couldn't see the appearance because i drink from the bottle, but the logo had some hops and a landscape; Smell: Perfumed with hops and some apple, honey and toffee; Tasted: Floral and pine hops together with pineapple and peach scents; Mouthfeel: Dry, bittersweet with a bitter finish, medium body and low carbonation; Drinkability: Very good, i drank while playing slots."
"This is a versatile, enjoyable brew that's not a challenge to drink nor too heavy on the stomach. Only thing keeping this beer from a perfect 5 is the sticky bitter finish that lingers just a bit long - I feel like I need to wash my mouth out with something less ...sticky and lingering? Sure, we'll phrase it that way. Otherwise, very good."
"D- Very enjoyable. My friend says its bitter but I dont think so at all. A great starting point for American craft beesr. A great anytime beer."
"Worthy of its place in the American craft beer pantheon."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer in many ways. Not only would I like another, I have enjoyed this beer in the past and I'm sure I'll be having it again. It goes nicely as a counterpoint to lightly spiced foods and is a nice, all-around beer. While there are other APAs out there I'd not turn this one down if offered."
"A nice drinkable pale ale to have on any occasion."
"A quintessential APA. While it is maltier than expected it ticks all the boxes even if it isn't spectacular. It could have more hop aroma and flavour to help carry the beer to greater heights."
"D: Easy to drink, and a great pale ale."
"Very drinkable beer. Great choice since it is a pretty popular. This is usually my go to beer at a place with not the best selection. I used to overlook this beer, but I give it my respect!"
" D - One of my favorite PAs now that I've been able to try it, not too hard hitting and but wonderfully flavorful."
"D - A very easy to drink and sessionable beer. This should be the standard when it comes to bottles at parties."
"A cloudy golden color with a thick foamy white head and nice streams of carbonation. It has a citrusy and hoppy nose. The flavor is pretty similar, and stays consistent, with a light bitter citrus & pine hop note,with some malty almost bready notes. The mouth feel is an average medium body. In a very pleasant way, it is a nice standard pale ale that makes itself very drinkable and enjoyable with its classic simplicity."
"A very drinkable, classic tasting American pale ale a wonderful staple session beer. One of the first craft beers i ever had years ago and Its still a very nice brew"
"This is my all time favorite session beer. It has a nice punch of Cascade hops that give it a nice floral bouquet and clean almost grassy taste without being overbearing. The moderate alcohol content and light malt flavor makes this a beer that is easy to drink and doesn't wear on the palate like heavier or hoppier beers. Also this beer pairs well with almost any food, but beef or spicy barbecue seem the most appropriate."
"SNPA smells of citric hops. Taste is pretty hop-forward with citrus and pine. Not much detected from the malts. Bitter on the end. Mouthfeel is medium for the style and ABV, pretty highly carbonated. Drinkability is good. Not too bitter or having any other characteristic(s) that would prevent more consumption."
"Pours a clear, light copper/blonde color with a light and lacy white head. Through the glass you can see the high carbonation levels as bubbles float to the surface and send out a noseful of citrus hops aroma. The drink is very smooth and well balanced. A generous helping of citrus hops overpower the slight hints of complementing malt. The body is very light, crisp, and refreshing. It finishes with a smooth reminder of the citrus bitterness and fades out slowly."
"Drinkability: The mouthfeel knocks this down for me a bit, I think, but the taste is light and nice. I remember not liking this beer before I got into craft beers, and I'm glad I gave it another try."
"D: This is the definition of a session beer for me. SN Pale Ale and Brooklyn Lager are the two beers that you can always find in my fridge."
"D: Drinkable because of the light bodied and enjoyable because of the simplicity. However, nothing to really think about here and therefore, not as enjoyable as it could be for me."
"Overall there may be better American Pale Ales out there, but I haven't had one. Thanks to Sierra Nevada along with Samuel Adams I never have the fear of not being able to find good beer. You can pick this stuff up at just about any place that sells alcohol. It's a good feeling."
"Darkish orange with some yeast from bottle-conditioning. Nicely balanced--just enough hops to notice them but leaves plenty of room for a nice fruity/citrusy background. A solid, enjoyable beer that is very sessionable and should appeal to most beer drinkers."
"I'm impressed with this beer. Great flavor but not too much for the palate to handle. I could definetly enjoy six of these and never lose interest. Bravo!"
"On of my favorite Pale Ales. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into chilled pint glass. Pours a dark yellow color with ample off-white head. Malt, citrus notes. Super refreshing beer. Robust grassy hop taste with hints of citrus. A solid malt backbone evens things out and gives this a medium body. A classic."
"D: It bears repeating: very nicely balanced. This is a standard in so many bars in the US, and there's a reason why... almost anyone could drink this and enjoy it. And enjoy five of them in one sitting."
"This is definately one of those beers that we see most of the time in australia but for some reason i havnt seen it on our shelves for the last few months or even longer so was stoked to see it again,it pours a very nice bright orange with some amber highlights and it has the perfect amount of carbonation that leaves a frothy two finger head with lacing everywhere a very impressive looking beer,and it doesnt stop there the aroma is piney sweet malty coated hops and very inviting indeed,it has a nice creamy full mouthfeel with a taste of the perfect same balance that is one on the nose with caramel malts firstly followed by the finish which is nice and light with a subtle touch of fruity,piney hops and no hint of its ABV on my palette,this is definately a beer that i always enjoy everytime i drink it and to be honest is probably better than the last time i tasted and will be buying again without a doubt."
"D: Finish sticks around for quite a while, could be good or bad depending on tastes. But probably my favorite go to beer."
"THE quintessential pale ale in the United States, and as with so many other American beer drinkers, my introduction to ""good beer"" back in the early 1990s. Many have been brewed since, with varying strengths and weaknesses, but the original SNPA has not lost its shine."
"I particularly like this beer not just because it is my favorite style, but because of its exceptional drinkability. The bitterness of the overall hop character is not too overpowering for the light, citrusy taste, yet it still lets you know that it is a pale ale. And as far as citrusy character goes, I feel this beer is one of the best utilizers of the Cascade hop. The aroma is one of the traits I love best about this brew. But enough writing, I need to drink more of this beer and I can't do that while typing."
"d - highly drinkable, pretty easy on the palate for a fairly hoppy beer, alcohol is well-hidden"
"D - Always a great drink--the APA that sets the bar for all others. Sessions!"
"A very drinkable beer, and a great session beer."
"This beer is alright, it tastes like a textbook definition of an american pale ale, personallly I think it is so boring I could die, well brewed, I guess this just isn't my style. I love the hop and malt forward brews by sierra nevada, but their flagship puts me to sleep. Nothing against balanced beers, I'm just not crazy about this one, its just so boring. Smooth creamy mouthfeel is the best part of this beer."
"Pours a clean cut golden amber dark rosy color that is very inviting and crispy. Head is off white and sticks and laces and emits aromas of sticky hops, roasty and clean malts, pine trees, nectarines, and ripe plums. Taste is balanced and fair, honest and fairly bitter. Mouthfeel and drinkability are alright as well."
"Drinkability- Easily a session beer. A 6 pack on any evening would be an absolute treat. In my opinion, this is a perfect example of an APA, along with being a classic!"
"D: A pleasantly drinkable pale ale, one that doesn't skimp on the hops. SNPA is an ale best served fresh on-tap."
"D: One of the most drinkable, reliable, accesible beers out there; this is the definition of a session beer."
"D - Goes down very easy... Not being a hop head, this is a brew I could enjoy quite a few of without feeling like my palette has been violated... Always my first choice when in BMC country as it is available almost everywhere, but it's a lot more than just a ""fall back"" beer..."
"D - Very easy-drinking. This beer is not the most complex APA, but it's very drinker-friendly (I downed the 24oz bottle in no time, provided I'm nowhere near being a guzzle-lover), so it definitely deserves a round of applause."
"D -- Goes down smooth and easy, quenches the thirst as a good Pale Ale ought to. King of the style and it keeps its chops."
"D: A go-to beer. And very available. You shouldn't have to travel too far to find a SNPA six pack. If you do, someone's not doing their job."
"D: I really enjoy this beer. Not something I would want to drink a half a case of in a night, but it's definitely a solid beer I would buy time and time again."
"From notes, on tap in California. Very clear, golden/copper, fluffy white head, good retention, some lacing. Not very active. SMELL pleasantly hoppy aroma up front, dissipates. Not expecially complex. Grassy hop notes return with a swirl and as it warms. TASTE nicely balanced meium bitterness, substantial but not overdone hop flavors & perceptible malt backing. FEEL tingly/fizzy, medium body, dry & a bit bitter in the finish. OVERALL it is a classic, or course. Plenty of flavor, easy drinking. Old reliable, and thankful to find it when it's the only craft beer available in a particular location."
"Notes: A full flavored session beer. The quintessential American Pale Ale."
"Definitely one of the best APAs out there in terms of availability. Pretty common, so you'll find this relatively easily. Pours a nice golden color. Aroma is of hops and wheat with some light citrus. Taste matches aroma, also has a slightly stronger carbonation mouthfeel. Great beer to start someone off with."
"Not many APA's really stand up to this American classic. And yes I do believe it has earned the title American classic as it is actually starting to stand out against the macros. Price, availability, taste and drinkability are the reasons why this is APA around. Great gateway beer."
"Not really an APA guy, but this is one of the better I have had. Nice change from the RIP's and porters I usually drink. Nice beer overall. Nothing really special though."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the best widely-available beer I've had. It's a pleasure to find it on the menu at a restaurant with a poor selection. It also would serve very well as an every-day beer."
"D - very very drinkable. too drinkable"
"D- Easy to drink...The hoppiness might offend the palates of some people, but those who appreciate the taste will love this beer."
"A bit disappointing at first in smell and appearance, but taste, feel, and drinkability make this an all around decent beer."
"It had a light crisp medium bitterness with a light feel on the tongue. Nice drinkable beer, this one could carry you through the evening easily."
"This was a whole different experience on tap. My review of the bottle came out to a B-, however it may have been an old bottle because on tap this was MUCH more like the classic APA it claims to be. Very hoppy, piney and citrusy in the nose, nice sheets of lace left on the pint glass but disappear after a few minutes. Great color to the beer and the taste is very refreshing and hoppy with crisp fruit and pine showing their muscles. Very drinkable and very nicely done. I must say it was a totally different experience on tap."
"Overall it's too bitter and sour, and not enough malt to balance. Hop aroma and flavor are a bit lacking. The flavors it does have taste stale. As it warms it releases more of a malty-sweet aroma, but there still isn't much more than bitterness on the palate. If someone offered me another, I'd take it, but I wouldn't order it."
"Beer has a medium body, and there is a lot of bitterness in the back of the mouth from the hops. There isn't much to speak of in the front or perhaps I am just distracted by the hop bitterness. Drinkability high. One of my favorite stand by beers that is readily available nearly everywhere."
"Poured into a beer glass which produced a nice foamy nice head and a nice nutty brown colour. It had a nice hoppy aroma about it, which did not disappoint as I drank it. A balanced hoppyness lingers nicely on the palate. A beer I could drink over and over, and makes me wish I could get a beer this good, this cheap in Canada. Sigh."
"Overall, this beer's reputation as the Old Faithful of APAs is warranted. Hop-forward beers such as APAs and IPAs aren't exactly my thing, but if I'm craving an APA, this comes to mind. I remember having this beer once before I was really into craft beer. At that time, it was quite a bit too hoppy for me to enjoy it. Now, I clearly see why it's a benchmark for APAs."
"Excellent beer, but not my style."
"D: A good beer and still a special one to me. At the time it was the most ""unique"" beer in the conference center that I stayed."
"As for drinkability, I wouldn't have more than one."
"anytime i go a few weeks without having one, the next time i am reminded what a quality beer this is."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the American standard that all other APA's will be judged by in my book. Very tasty."
"Overall: A decent brew. Not more not less, will not refuse one in the future."
"Pours a golden into a standard pint glass. Some head, which dissipates with time. Nothing remarkable or unique about this smell, perhaps a bit floral. Taste is somewhat piney, with a sweet aftertaste...perhaps citrus. Some hops, not overwhelming though. Mouthfeel is very nice, some moderate carbonation, very smooth. The best part about this beer is it's drinkability. While perhaps not a session beer, this one begs for you to drink more and pairs very nicely with food (I recently had a bottle with a bleu cheese encrusted steak sandwich which was absolutely divine). I could see myself buying a six pack and making it vanish within a single night."
"Edit, 12/14: After multiple experiences with this I'm upping the drinkability on this to a 5 (from 4). It is definitely one of the best session beers I've ever had and one of the few brews I'm willing to buy 6 packs of."
"Drinkability - This is a great beer. Nice to gulp down when you are hot & sweaty. Perfect with a variety of foods as it compliments but does not over power your food. Crisp, flavorful, then a wonderful faint bitterness on the finish - Cheers!"
"Poured into a twelve ounce mug it has a deep clear copper/amber color with a big three finger head. The head is still there after the beer is long gone. Great smell. I love that herbal pine and grapefruit west cost smell. This beer is a true masterpiece. I'm not going to waste time describing the taste other than to say it's as close to perfect beer flavor as humanly possible. All the flavors are absolutlely right on, balanced in exactly the right way. The mouthfeel is creamy enough to be satisfying, but not too heavy to fill you up. It is scary how drinkable this beer is. I could go on and on. To sum it up it's a once in a lifetime creation that actually surpasses the hype. I love it."
"In my opinion, this is one of the most drinkable beers ever, period. Yes, the 5.6% ABV technically disqualifies it from the session beer category, but I find myself making a session out of SNPA way too often. The flavors are just solid without being overpowering, making this a great beer to have a few of. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale pretty much has a permanent spot in my fridge, and likely always will."
"Was a very nice golden amber with an almost 2 inch foamy head. Head stayed for most of the glass and stuck to it nicely. Was a very well-balanced brew. Very hoppy aroma as well as taste, but not too overwhelming where I couldn't drink this regularly. Probably the best APA I've had to date."
"Drinkability: Not like what I remember; no cigarette butts this time. A very good brew for a meal in the Sierra Nevada's. It's true to a style which is not my favorite."
"One of the few beers I actually buy often!"
"This is the gold standard for American Pale Ales - a classic. Drinking the beer out of an american pint glass, the slightly cloudy, off-golden, bottle conditioned beer forms a nice off white head. The head eventually gives way and leaves a nice lace on the glass while the small carbonation bubbles jet to the top of the beer. The aroma gives you a tease of hops but mostly the malty sweetness comes through in the nose. The first sip gives way to that sweet initial taste then it's quickly balanced by the floral hops finishing with a faint bitterness. The mouthfeel is right on target which is on the lighter side of medium bodied. This beer is perfect for complimenting bar food: pizza, wings, poppers, & burgers. It's also a great everyday beer which should occupy any american pale ale lovers beer fridge or beer meister. A great beer for anyone who loves a nice flavorful but not over the top american pale ale."
"Overall a great Pale Ale. A classic, enjoyable beer."
"drinkability: yes! Could stay with this all night."
"M/D: Very drinkable with nice smooth mouthfeel. For a beer that you can get pretty much anywhere this was pleasant."
"Overall, this is definitely classic brew that I haven't had in at least a year, but I'm glad I picked up a bottle. There's definitely a reason that so many people drink this when they are starting to get into craft brews. Great beer, for just that reason"
"Gave it a 5 on drinkability. Could and have made this beer a all night session beer. Love it!!"
"M/D - very easy to drink, totally approachable for a newcomer to craft beers but still enjoyable for seasoned tasters."
"As close as an APA can come to IPA in hop smell, flavor and bitterness. Overall, the draft version exceededs the bottle by a mile."
"An extremely drinkable APA that I will continue coming back to."
"Pours a nice orange color with not a whole lot of head - dissipates almost immediately. Smell is of citrusy hops. Taste is similar. The citrus and cascade hops are really noticeable, but it's not really bitter. There's a slight hint of spice here. Quite drinkable, especially if you're a fan of the style."
"Overall a great drinking beer with some extraordinary drinkability. One of those beers that you can drink mowing the lawn or out on the town. Nothing complex or mysterious, just a good honest pale ale."
"Cheers!"
"Can and will drink anytime. Always in my fridge."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice amber/orange color, with a very good carbonation presence, a nice off-white head, and good lacing. The aroma is dominated by pine and citrus from the getgo, but you can also detect some biscuit and malt in there as well. The taste reveals why so few people have been able to duplicate this pale ale's success; citrus and pine hop flavor gives way to maltiness, which then gives way to a dry finish. Nice medium-bodied and carbonated mouthfeel, with a great dry finish. This beer defines 'session pale ale'."
"D-Very, very drinkable. A great session brew to be sure!"
"this beer is a very clear golden orange color. the smell consists of fruit with a bit of a pine twist. the taste is great. it starts off very fruity with a hint of malts but mostly hops hops hops. i love it! the mouthfeel is smooth, lightly carbonated and a bit buttery. since it has a light alcohol rating a could drink a good amout of these before i get too buzzed"
"Between this ale and Boulavard Pale Ale, they're the beers I can always count on for a great hop taste/smell. When there is nothing else good in stock, these two are my 'fallback' beere. Between the great taste and smooth hoppy finish, this one is a winner, which is why it's one of the industry standards when it comes to American Pale Ales."
"By the time I got the glass, the head was very thin, which was a disappointment. The body was brownish orange with a lot of playful bubbliness. Nice nose - a lot of grape and citrus notes, with a little bit of grain and yeast. ah, the taste was multi dimensional, with a sharp zesty bite, sweet fruitiness and a robust hop bitterness, more than average for a pale ale. A lot of carbonation there with a light palate. A very drinkable session beer."
"Overall this is a very drinkable, yet flavorful beer. It didn't blow me away, but it may just make my top 15 or so. Only time will tell."
"Drinkability - This is a great session beer. This is the beer me and my buddies ""go to beer"" if nothing else is available. Very nice beer to have while working on the cars or relaxing on a sunday afternoon watching football."
"D- I could have a few of these but I think after that my taste buds would be a little worn out."
"D: One of the more drinkable mass-produced beers out there. Goes down easy and has a decent taste."
"The classic American pale ale, as great as its always been."
"The mouthfeel is too dry and very flat so hmmm, the fruity esters are not too penetrant but there are no earwax hops in it."
"This is truly a classic American ale by a classic American brewery, and as I said straightaway, in my opinion, THE classic American Pale Ale."
"d- wonderful, sessionable, one of the best apas i've had, when people talk about apa balance, this is what their talking about, this is my go to case of pale ale, so tasty."
"Drinkability: I was pretty let down by this one. I was hoping that this cask conditioned SNPA would showcase the beer's malt profile; and while it did bring the malt side into the spotlight, I feel like this beer's shortcomings were just exposed. I didn't have a problem drinking this, but given my time constraints that night this felt like a waste. Oh well, now I know."
"Nice beer to drink on labor day while im relaxing. Its all preaty close to the same as the torpedo but not as strong of a taste but not weak very well balanced. I can see myself easly drinking alot of these in one sitting. I would buy this agian for sure."
"This has quickly become one of my favorite beers. It's very available too. My local Safeway carries it :-) . Pours a golden amber, and you can immediately smell the citrus/grapefruit scent. Tastes like grapefruit too. A little sweetness, but not too much. A litle carbonation, but not too much. A little malt, but not too much. Overall, it would be really hard to improve the taste and mouthfeel of this beer, and very drinkable. When I want a lighter flavored beer, this is the one I go for."
"D: Extremely drinkable with perfect balance and surprising depth. One of the most flavorful American pale ales I've had."
"In the mouth it feels clean and filling and crisp. I could drink a couple of these...but I have work to do."
"Overall: One of the better pale ales i've had, has a tinge more hops which is a-ok in my book and the citrus really brings it all together."
"Pale ales are not my thing but this thing definitely does what its supposed to do, its a nice switch up from the malt bombs which dominate my life, a good gateway craftbeer"
"D- This beer is my go to Pale and well my go to beer if nothing else is around. I always come back to this beer even after I drink myself to death on hopbombs or extreme maltbombs. This beer is refreshing and always does the trick. would recommend to everyone. Great gateway beer into the craft world."
"Finally got around to reviewing SNPA. I don't drink it much since we have a good local APA in Summit but the 6er was on sale so I picked up some. Nicely balanced, nothing too exciting these days, but would have been amazing 20+ years ago."
"D- Very drinkable. The right mix of hops and malt, allowing many of these to be put away in a single sitting."
"this goes down so easy, I regret not drinking lots more of this. I'll have to work on that."
"Drinkability: Well, at 5.6%, it's drinkable, but also kind of dull and not too great and the alcohol is actually more present than I've had in a few beers almost double its ABV. I've had it better in the past, but the flavors are just a little too mild for my mood and wanted just a tad more from it."
"The nose is a balance of subtle grapefruit and apple slice with gentle biscuit malt, and a slight hoppy resin. Flavor is well-balanced, with bitterness offset by gentle malt which is boosted by the smooth mouthfeel. As this pale ale warms, the bitterness subsides leaving the smooth, relatively thick mouthfeel (for a pale ale) in memory. Very balanced, drinkable pale ale, which has become a staple to keep in stock for myself and to share with visitors who may or may not be craft brew drinkers."
"This beer goes great with everything from mowing the lawn, to drinking at the beach, to camping, to partying with. Best session beer."
"Taste: A slight malt sweetness that is complimented nicely with a pleasant bitterness that isn't overpowering in anyway."
"It is a beer I would recommend to those who have not tried anything from the dark side. I also had this beer over Seafood Provencal, and it went well together."
"+ classic SNPA. what can i say about this beer that hasn't already been said? it's a solid staple beer. great example of a pale ale, and a perfect (and likely) crossover beer."
"5:i enjoy it and im god"
"Overall this is a great lawnmower or party beer, its got a nice kicky abv but not too much to ruin a good session. Not on par with say Alpha King though."
"D) Very high. At 5.6% ABV I could have several of these and enjoy them."
"D - A nice beer, and very drinkable. Light and refreshing enough to be a solid summer beer."
"Edit: I've had this at various bars on tap and it doesn't come close to the experiences I've had with the bottled version, so take what you want from that."
"The beer pours a nice but small head. It is a nice clear yellow color with a medium amount of carbonation. It smells slightly of citrus like hops and like quality malt. The taste is pleasantly hoppy there is a bit of good malt to balance out the hops which taste citrusy. Over all this is still one of the best pale ales on the market."
"T/ M/ D - high hop flavor with low malt character to allow the hop flavor to come through. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth finish with complex hop citrus and flowery notes. Very drinkable, and perfect for any occasion, one of the only 2 beers that I allowed at my wedding."
"Drinkability: Fantastic. Something I could definitely drink on a regular basis."
"D- good beer. unfair to compare with an ipa if you are expecting more hops. actually got better as the beer warmed a bit."
"Finally got a hold of one of these. A little hard to come by round these parts. Happy to say it lived up to the hype. Soft grapefruity, citrus nose with lovely itching bitterness that fills the mouth. A sturdy caramel malt backbone as well in perfect balance with the hop flavours. Carbonation, malt, hops, bitterness all in line. Wish it was more available(and cheaper)."
"Overall, a classic beer...very tasty and drinkable."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a pretty clear and pretty lively golden ale with a thin white film that leaves good lacing. It has a simple and assertive hoppy aroma, like grapefruit peel. It's medium-light bodied, smooth and lively with a crisp finish. It has a classic flavor with a prominent Cascade taste. It's perfectly balanced with the malt, which has a hint of caramel. This is the definitive American pale ale, against which all others are compared."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by hops. Taste is hops, some bitterness, a bit of malts at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall I tried this before and was unimpressed but now I found it to be a pretty good beer."
"It's a light carbonation that gives room, in a complimentary way. The feel is off, it's just that this Pale Ale is not about texture."
"a classic beer one of the best pale ale out there on the beer market.if you haven't had sierra nevada pale ale yet ,go get one! if this was unfiltered it would bring this up to a new level in my book."
"Poured from a tap into a pint glass its a nice evenly colored beer with a good head. The smell is of citrus and slight pine, the taste is flowery with a finish of minor hops. A beer that goes down well and also is a nice spacer in between some big IPAs."
"D- Overall this is a very good Pale Ale. Made for drinking more than one."
"The beer is very drinkable. I have had this beer many times and I seem to always go back to it when I am out, due to its wide availability and overall good quality."
"Pours a golden amber color. The aroma is of a malt backbone, smells of bread, and a citrus and floral hop over the top. The taste is of a good floral and citrus hop top coat, however, not overly bitter, with a malt bread backbone. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation. Overall it is a good pale ale, the hop taste isn't as bitter as other pale ale's making it more drinkable than most."
"D - I could drink this all night (and have). A great sessionable pale ale that is always a solid choice!"
"My favorite standby Pale Ale. A great west coast hoppy pale ale. Love them cascade hops. One of my gateway craft beers, and still one of my favorites."
"This pale ale is the ultimate for its style and can be best appreciated after laying off hoppier beers for a while. The aroma is perfect and the look, taste and drinkability is great any time of year or in any situation. Good copper color, amazing aroma of hops. Try after drinking a lot of lighter beers."
"Very drinkable beer, that turns into a six pack really quick. It has a medium body, and doesn't offend the palete."
"D-A good APA, somewhat overrated in my opinion. Very easy drinking. Definitely improves as it warms, but I like to drink APAs cold and in large gulps to quench thirst on a hot summer day. Doesn't quite do it for me."
"Overall - A nice hoppy brew with a workhorse feel. Definitely destined to be a regular in my fridge."
"A solid pale ale, definitely a thirst quencher on a hot humid day like today."
"D: This is a great beer and if you havn't had it get - get yourself to the nearst store that sells it and buy it!"
"Overall this is a great beer, would defintely purchase again."
"HV"
"Poured as a dark amber with a one inch off-white head that hung around for a while. The smell was citrusy. The taste was grapefruit with a small amount of hops, like an IPA light, but without being bitter. Feel was light bodied with a little carbonation for the tongue to play with. Very drinkable, the number one asset of this beer. Overall, I liked the taste and I will enjoy again and again. Reminded me of a lager, not in taste, but its ability to quench a thirst."
"In reflection, this may be my new standby brand for times when I don't have a great selection to choose from (displacing Sam Adams Boston Lager). I despise hoppy beers and this was a pale ale that won me over. A very well-balanced, drinkable and flavorful brew, and a pioneer brand in American microbrewing to top it all off."
"This is a real easy drinker and with its wide distribution it is a go to for when the options are this and BMC. If this is what defines and APA, I'm ok with it."
"Overall, This is the top American Pale ale in my book. It represents the style to a tee and is unmatched by most APAs."
"The taste is very easy to drink. There are definite leafy hops, nothing too resinous or too oily or too nouvelle here, just solid and honest leafy hop. There is enough bready malts and a biscuity backbone to balance out the hop to make it very complementary. There are some drying notes, some sharper citrusy spice flavors in the beer too, maybe a slight touch of clove. The beer is drier than I remember, the mouthfeel is quite mild, there is a lingering hoppy dryness in the aftertaste. This is medium bodied, not too thick, not cloying, very refreshing, very solid. There may be a touch of orange rind lurking underneath as well. This is a very nice Pale Ale, very enjoyable. L'Chaim."
"The Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a session beer for craft brew lovers. It's one of the hoppiest commercially available beers on the market, and that's what distinguishes it in my mind. If you are a Pale Ale lover, it's just a matter of time before you're tipping back on thicker IPA's and porters."
"Overall, a great beer to use to introduce your macro friends to craft and a solid staple to fall back on if you need a relatively cheap and sessionable craft brew. Unlikely I'll keep this a staple in the fridge, but certainly wouldn't pass it up if offered."
"Easy drinking and leaves me wanting more. CLean and crisp mouthfeel with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Its a hoppy devil of a pale ale."
"This taste like your typical pale ale, light, hops and citrus with a bitter end."
"O- This is a good go to beer where faced with a limited selection. This is a perfect beer for Friday night pizza."
"Pours a pretty shade of amber, with a 1 finger head. Aroma of hops and some citrus. Light fruity flavor with a decent hop kick that finishes slightly bitter but not overwhelmingly. Crisp and well balanced with a good mouth feel. My tastes tend to lean more to Stouts, but this beer is going to make me spend more time exploring PA's and IPA's I think. I really enjoyed this beer."
"D: Very easy to throw back a bunch of these and very refreshing. Good pairing with food or separate."
"Like I said, a standard. Nothing mega-spectacular but a worthy option anytime."
"D - I love this beer. Great price, great flavor, I can drink this all night an be happy."
"M/D: A nice medium-full body to this one. Very clean and smooth as I've noted and very drinkable. A great summertime beer, no doubt."
"This beer is the money maker, with good reason."
"Definite session beer right here! Widely available and consistent."
"D very drinkable-could have serveral in a session"
"Drinkability: Hell, yeah. This may be the prototypical APA, but it is also one of the best, maybe because it straddles the APA/IPA line closer than most."
"D- Give me a twelve pack of this and a hot summer day and I will be happy long after the sun sets. One of the most drinkable craft beers I've had."
"D - Very drinkable. Refreshing, tastey, and good amount of alcohol. Would definitely go for a session of this."
"Anyway, it poured a nice reddish amber into a pint glass with only a slight head. The hops kick is nice, but not wuite enough for me. There is the regular citrus notes and the biting aftertaste associated with the style. I could (and have) drink a dozen. Basically, thank you Sierra Nevada for showing me the light."
"D - So easy to drink. A perfect summer beer."
"Notes: great beer overall, im a big fan of pale ales so my review might be a little one sided. would recommend this beer and would buy again. wish i had more then one of these guys laying around"
"Great beer. Must try."
"Very drinkable. Very balanced. A classic, that is a staple in any beer lovers fridge. I havent drank this enough over the years. Drinks well year round - any occasion."
"if you spent much time here at all you already know as i learned, this is a great beer for those who want to try something good but might not be able to handle an IPA or imperial stout."
"Pours a cloudy peach body with a big white head. Fruity hops with notes of grapefruit and orange. Caramel malt and spicy, citrus hops meet seamlessly in THE classic APA. Good hop flavor, moderate bitterness, excellent balance. SNPA is creamy on the finish with high carbonation. SNPA is the beer that defines Sierra Nevada and is one of the most historic and influential beers in craft beers meteoric rise. As the number of quality American breweries has exploded, this beer may not be as greatly superior or unique as it once was, but it is still an excellent beer that serves as the model against which all APAs can be judged."
"Despite all of the challenges imposed by the serving I enjoyed SN PA and will look for it again - and uodate my review."
"D: The beer that launced a thousand hopped-up West Coast pale ales. Nonetheless, its position as the best beer available at the average bar is pretty much unassailable."
"I always pass the 24 ounce bootle when I grocery shop and today I finally decided to buy one and see what it was like. I have become a huge fan of the Torpedo and I wanted to branch out and see what else they offered. I am not a huge fan of Pale Ales but this is a good tasting beer. For better or worse I have become a huge hop fan, therefore the hoppier the beer the better, but this is just as good as any of those hop bombs. I see this beer alot when I go out to chain restaurants and I am excited to now have another beverage option when I eat at those places. This will make it into my regular rotation when I need a break from the stronger presence beers."
"D: My fist craft beer and always a standby when out at a bar or restaurant. You can almost never go wrong with SNPA."
"This is a very earthy beer that is very refreshing to drink. I haven't tried many Sierra Nevada beers but I'm looking forward to more. Makes for a wonderful summer beer."
"i used to love this beer but boy do times change - it is still a solid beer but if this is the gateway beer i think the craft party might lose some after trying this"
"Sierra Nevada is one of the beers that turned me onto beer. It has such well-defined characteristics - it nearly defines (or possibly ACTUALLY defines) the style of American Pale Ale. The refreshing drinkability (and not in the Miller Lite sense, either) meshes so well with the malt and hop to yield something that has become a classic."
"It seems that with Sierra Nevada, you really can not go wrong. The same can be said for their Pale Ale. Clear, no sedament (not that I mind that) and good taste. This is definatley one of my fall back beers on Sunday night at 11 pm when I need to travel to Balto. County to get beer. In MD we call the ""Blue Laws", the county I live in just allowed stores to be open until 4 or 6 pm, but there are times when living on a county line has its benifits."
"D: I'm almost embarrassed to say I haven't ever sat down to enjoy one of these beers before. Odd for something so widely respected and distributed. A very drinkable pale ale that achieves an American character while still giving a nice shout to its British roots."
"D: I'd say it's pretty good, very well balanced, I would consider this to be a shining example of the style."
"Been a while since I've had this one. Looks good, clear golden amber pour. Smells of some sweet pale malts and some citrusy American hops. Tastes sweet and bready at first, with some grapefruit like hops in the middle and a fair amount of bitterness at the end. It's a really well balanced beer by my standards -better than Dale's or other hop-forward versions of the style in my opinion."
"I've had this pale ale on tap and out of a bottle and must say it's a little bit better on tap."
"Overall, this beer is great. Great aroma, head retention, and taste."
"Liked this beer, reminded me of a mild IPA"
"Overall, a decent pale ale and one that I think everyone has had already. A recommend. Prosit."
"Poured into my pint glass from a 12 oz. bottle. SNPA is a deep gold, almost orange with a very slight haze. The head is off-white and quickly settles, with nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is very hoppy, with cedar and citrusy notes. Upon sipping, it's very balanced. Hoppy, yet evened out with a good amount of toasty malt. The beer is medium-bodied and very smooth. Extremely easy to drink, Sierra Nevada Pale is my standard session ale."
"SN Pale pours a golden straw color, with a hint of orange; it's a nice shade. There is a good amount of white head that is leaving some lace as it settles. The beer is extremely clear and you can see bubbles of carbonation rising in it. The aroma is full of strong hops; very inviting. There is some malt in the flavor, along with grass and hops. There is a full hop aftertaste that is very pleasant. This is a very hoppy pale ale. The body is moderately light and there is some sharp carbonation in the mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable beer; pretty, tasty, complex and reliable. It is always a safe choice."
"D: This baby is lacking in the flavor I know and love. The bottle just doesn't do this brew justice. Get it on tap...many of them!"
"A very well done ale that isn't overly bitter, nor is it overly complex. A great beer to enjoy casually and often."
"D- This has become one of my favorite summertime beers. Not quite as refreshing as some hefewiezens that I've had, gut it's definitely high on the list of thirst quenchers (gatorade is for pussies!). Probably the best pale ale I've had... and they sell cases of it at Trader Joes!"
"Great aroma, great taste... great!"
"On tap this beer presents a nice head without a long wait for settling. Important when you are really in need of a cold brew! The copper-gold coloring represents this beer well. The flavor, texture, and overall drinkability of this beer makes it the perfect go-to beer for any beer lover."
"D- Drinkablity is great. Perfect for turning a boring atmosphere into a flavor blasting apa experience. Refering to boring beer of course!"
"A good, basic go-to beer."
"This golden-amber ale pours with a lacy white head and smells of grain, flowers, and citrus. The beer is smooth bordering on creamy with sweet bready malt flavor that finishes with citric hop backbone being revealed. Light body, easy to drink, pleasantly dry on the finish."
"Great beer, no wonder Jugs magazine voted this Pale Ale of the year."
"Wow, I'm glad I've tasted it. Next time I have to bring a 6-pack to Quebec. This pale ale is more hoppy than some IPA from down here. A saying on the west coast love for hops!!"
"A classic American Pale Ale."
"a session beer for certain. dangerously easy to drink, and flavorful enough that you'd want more without thinking it's too 'heavy' or 'filling'."
"D- Wow. You can really put a couple of these down no problem. A good staple American Pale Ale. There's a reason you see this everywhere."
"Overall this is a pretty darn good beer for general purpose drinking or with a meal. They suggest spicy dishes but I think it would hold up to a burger or a pizza or some other greasy food quite well also."
"mouthfeel/drinkability/overall: this is a crisp beer for sure, definitely well carbonated. no sense of oily-ness. pretty filling. overall a solid beer."
"Crisp is the one term that really defines this beer. When you combine the flavor with a medium-to-light body and almost ticklish carbonation you get a very sharp and dry beer. Not a filling beer in any sense. I enjoyed this beer; I am glad to have found a beer with character that I can easily find in the supermarket."
"The taste is a just right balance of sweet malts, fruit and bitter hops. It's really well done and very refreshing! It goes down quickly and has a very solid ""beery"" aftertaste. Drinkability is about as good as it gets in my opinion."
"D - great drinkable allround american pale ale"
"The ratings don't lie, excellent beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours an orange orange/yellow color with a decent sized white head. The head slowly retracts down but stays around for a while which leaves some nice rings of lacing. Aroma is good for whats there, I don't get a whole lot but for whats there it's hops, citrus, kind of grassy, overall not bad. Taste is pretty good. Citrus hops, not to over the top bitter just kind of right. A little sweet, theres a little caramel going on. A great beer for sure. Like most Sierra Nevada beers it's pretty solid, and overall just a great pale ale."
"Drinkability: smooth great tasting beer, that Is well suited to all tastes, the price is good. The flavor notes may not blow you away if you're looking for something intense but for the style of beer a great example."
"D: Very drinkable, goes down easy, good year round beer."
" Thank Bacchus (Even if it's not wine) for SNPA!! All hail!"
"I'd have to rate the drinkability high on this ale, there is nothing too outstanding about it, but it is very nicely rounded. Moderate alcohol content makes it a cakewalk to have a few in a row."
"D- Really great session beer; goes down smooth and crisp. Would recommend this one for sure."
"D - Great drinkability...spot on...a real nice pale ale...I have not been disappointed by Sierra Nevada yet"
"pours a nice light copper color with a good head and lacing ,,just right for a pale ale ..the smell is a hop/malt battle with malts at a slight edge..but ok/ good.. the taste is floral.citrus spice, grass .and hops,with sweet malt its all there but at a minimal level not a wow! pale ale just a quality brew not an over the top pale ale..the mouthfell is good its easy to drink and tasty..it tends to lean on the sweet malts to much and could use a tad more hops... but still a great macro cant go wrong pale ale and recommended"
"This is an excellent PA, I would probably get this again if 6ers were available in my area."
"D: Very refreshing and not at all offensive."
"Pours luminous amber with hint of gold and thick white head. Nose is fresh with citrus hops, and some pine. Palate offers a nice balance of malt with hop bitterness that yields an amazingly drinkable ale that leans to the hoppy side of things. Medium bodied."
"D: Very drinkable, tastes great, ABV is pretty good and not too filling... I'm not the biggest Pale Ale fan, but this one kind of won me over.... Balance is the key, bitter and sweet and refreshing."
"Killer beer...one of my favorites!"
"Drinkability: classic american pale ale. very drinkable."
"Unfortunately this beer doesn't do it for me anymore. The fact that is available almost everywhere is a plus, but I tend to avoid it now...though I love some of the other SN products."
"Drinkability: A very good pale ale. Very simple without one real defining quality, but a true standard of the type. Very easy to drink and goes with anything. Might be the beer that started my on my craft beer journey."
"Took a few tries to get into this beer to be honest. Clear, light colored beer when poured out. Little head retention. Very citrusy in flavor. I am normally a fan of the grapefruit flavor in a beer but this beer was a bit too sour for my tastes. Aftertaste is a bit too unpleasant. I really liked the bottle condition aspect here. It really helps this beer stick out and be unique. Had very high expectations for this one but it didn't impress me much."
"D: A lot of bright citrus flavors. It's an American classic, and usually the beer I order when I'm at a bar with limited craft beer selection."
"This has been a bar standard for me for a while, bottle or tap it's a great go-to beer."
"I will definitely purchase this beer again in the near future."
"A very drinkable APA that is accessible even to those not yet initiated to the wonderful world of hops. Overall flavor is mild but crisp enough to keep things interesting. A great session beer."
"Drink is very good. Easy to put down a few. I usually don't like hoppy beers but this is very smooth and not a dry and bitter as others."
"This pale ale has a medium-bodied mouthfeel with adequate amount of carbonation in the mouth. And as aforementioned, a crisp and dry aftertaste remains on the tongue and inner linings of the cheeks, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Drinkability is very high. You won't notice how fast you'll be drinking it. It is remarkably sessionable, tasty and reliable. SNPA will always be one of my go-to beers."
"Ah, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. A staple for me at gas stations, crappy bars and restaurants. Pours a transparent golden color. Completely see-through. Smell is slightly grassy and hoppy. Taste is initial bitterness followed by malty backbone and ends again with the bitterness of the hops. Some bready characteristics. Overall, this is a great stand-by brew for any occasion."
"This is my second Sierra Nevada beer (had a so-so first impression of Torpedo IPA). Appearance and drinkability are the best things about this beer, I found. Definitely, a nice refreshing brew out of California. Smell is somewhat lacking for an american pale ale, but I guess I was spoiled by Three Floyds Alpha King (my go-to american pale ale). I had heard and read great things about this Sierra Nevada offering, but I don't find it lives up to the hype, though still a very good beer."
"This is one of my favorites. I always come back to this for a regualr drinking ale!"
"D - Very drinkable. The price is great and the taste is very good making this THE session beer."
"D: Average"
"D: I'm always happy to see Sierra on the tap line (I'll always go for the crafty one I've never heard of before of course...), but when all around me are BudMillerCoors'ing it - Sierra is a might fine choice."
"D: Very drinkable. Definitely will keep this one in the fridge on a regular basis."
"Drinkability: Its light-medium body gives it a lot of drinkability and its none massive abv makes a session beer in my book. It is not a special beer, due to it being so common, but I it is one of my go to beers and is typically in my fridge."
"It's not a beer I get too often, because of the maltiness and lack of refreshment I get from it. But I do enjoy the taste and prefer the local stuff when I'm out drinking with the boys."
"Very smooth mouthfeel. I have close to no problems with it whatsoever. Carbonation is prickly and pleasant. I can see why this beer has been around for so long and enjoyed by so many people. A staple and a damn good one."
"This beer poured a light copper color with a big beige head and lots of visible carbonation. The smell is mostly floral and citrusy hops, very pleasant. The taste starts off with some sweet bready malt that gives way to some floral spicy hops and some malt comes back for the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some moderate carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, and probably one of the most popular beers in the style for a reason."
"Rich roasted gold color with light head and some prickle. Mildly hoppy nose. Hops forward flavor and almost a hoppy attack. I am guessing the nose affects the initial attack as the smells from the glass impact the flavor. It stays hoppy through the finish but in a mild way. The aftertaste allows the hops to fade with a bubbly mouthfeel that dries and vanishes. My wife offered the comment that the aftertaste made her feel as if she had just licked an envelope. This beer is certainly one to throw in the cooler for a backyard BBQ, but it isn't likely one that I will keep on hand in my beer fridge. I think that I find myself lumping into the ""old standards"" by which everything else is judged and would have to call it average for that very purpose. There are going to be better beers and far worse beers. If you have nothing else to choose from you won't be disappointed, but if there is something else on the menu you haven't tried its probably worth trying the new beer."
"4.5 D: Really tasty and goes down extremely well. This would be a great beer to cap a night off with."
"I cant say anything better than everyone else hasnt already said. This beer is a very good beer, widely available, and the brewery from which it is birthed has never once disappointed me. It has a very nice craft feel, and is particularly well balanced for a beer this readily available. A point not a lot of people touched on is the bottle fermentation... and this adds a depth of carbonation that a lot of other mass produced beers dont have. A very nice example of the style. A great pale ale, and very nice to find in 24 oz bottles."
"This beer is definitely a classic and something I will always buy. It is by far one of the better tasting pale ales around. I highly recommend this beer if you haven't tried it yet. Great started beer for getting into hops."
"D- Drinkable, reasonably priced, and an all around nice brew. Definitely one that I will keep around often."
"This brew pours in good and has a thick head on it. Great smell and even better taste. I didn't know what to expect when I first tried this one, but I'm glad I dove in. It gave me my love of American Pale Ale's. I'm never tired of this brew and it is still one that is on my top 10 list."
"Overall, a great mainstay that cna be found anywhere. A great option for a session brew."
"-It was the brew that got me into any and all craft brews. A great, great beer that deserves all of the acclaim it has received. If you want to try to get a friend off of Coors, Bud, or Miller serve one of these quaffable beauties."
"This beer is great. It's one of my favorites and I plan on drinking many of them."
"D: Like i said i like something a bit more hoppy, but I could see myself drinking quite a few of these on a nice hot summer day."
"D - Easy to drink many of these."
"[Personal Recomendation]: Give it a try it's kind of an acquired taste for me, but others could enjoy greatly."
"M/D- A wonderful beer to sip on with dinner. Has a nice silky texture with bright carbonation. I love the price and it goes great with most any meal."
"D- Good stuff, drinkable plus affordable, this one is a good package. Better off of the tap but fresh bottles are good as well. Low alcohol too which is also a plus. The balance is what sets this one off."
"A very nice drinkable beer."
"Mputhfeel is thin to medium and crisp. Refreshing beer for a hot day in the yard."
"Very drinkable beer, goes down smooth. Very sessionable."
"D: very drinkable. A very good/excellent beer, for the style at least. I don't tend to be blown away by pale ales, but I do like to drink this one."
"This is very drinkable. No wonder this is the flagship brew for Sierra Nevada."
"D- good. Very good. Great with almost any food type, or almost any occasion. All around a drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel is moderate in all respects - just feels right. Very nicely done."
"I'm told that when Americans taste Little Creatures they say it's like Sierra Nevada but not as good. I have to say that cuts both ways. This is a very pleasant drop, but I do think Little Creatures has a bit more character and more complex flavours. If I were born across the Pacific though I'd be perfectly prepared to say the opposite :)"
"Final Thoughts - Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a popular brew. If you haven't tried it, do it! Its an easy drinking American Pale Ale with a good amount of hops, and the ability to session."
"D - Very sessionable beer."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A very gentle pour left a minimal fizzy head that left a small ring behind. A beautiful hazy, cloudy orange color. Darker than other pale ales I've had. The aroma is mildly hoppy and sweet with some citrus in there as well. Not an overpowering aroma but nicely balanced. The taste is well balanced and follows the nose: Mildly hoppy and citrusy. I taste orange and pine, but it's a gentle taste. A little bitterness comes through after swallowing. Mouthfeel is somewhat dry and light/medium bodied. This could be my favorite session beer. Very drinkable and I could drink them all day. So, so good."
"Overall, I don't find it very compelling, but by no means is it bad, and I definitely wouldn't turn one down."
"Overall, very nicely balanced. Hoppy, but malty... delicious. SN makes great stuff."
"Simply a GREAT Pale Ale!!!!"
"From bottle to tulip 03/21/2009. First taste of a legendary micro brew. Pours a slightly hazy orang/golden color. Moderate off-white head with decent lacing through finish. Aroma of cascade hops, citrus, and malts. Well-balanced beer with a good dry finish. Good representation of an APA. I kind of like a beer closer to home a bit better - Schlafly's APA. To me either one is good for a six-pack session with friends. Cheers!"
"Bottom line: SNPA is the cadillac standard of Pales Ales in America."
"D- Super drinkable."
"The slight aroma leaves me wanting a little more. Feel is good and has a little tangy taste to it. I believe this is a good beer to have stocked in the home bar. I would defiantly buy again."
"Pours a reddish, golden body. Whitish head, good lacing but not very lasting, and small. Hoppy malty aromaj some gaapefruit. Somewhat bitter on the front, malty on the aftertaste. Not very nutty Flattish. Okay, not as tasty or hoppy as the bottle."
"Gold with orange highlights, a touch hazy. Thin off-white head left a ring and a wispy centre with cloudy trails and some lacing. Lazy carbonation. Hoppy nose with light orange zest, a clean and inviting aroma. Citrus hops taste with wonderful bitter / malt balance and substantial body for the style. This beer simply tastes great. Among the finer pale ales that I've tried, tasty with a nicely blended barley malt finish and an aftertaste that pleases and lingers for quite a long while. I'm sure I've had this and other Sierra Nevada products a few years ago, before I became a BA, and this one is just as I remember all the Sierra Nevada products - far above the norm for quality, taste and cost. Keep up the good work, SN."
"Crisp with a medium level of carbonation. Very easy to drink. Still a classic although I think the Torpedo may have ruined this one a bit for me since I basically see that as an amped up SNPA."
"D- easy to finish and sessionable. something nice to find on just about every shelf in town."
"Drinkability: Excellent. A great American beer and a great session beer."
"This sure is one of my favourite session-beers!"
"If for some reason you are reading this review and have not enjoyed a SNPA, get out there and try this yourself. It perfectly represents the style and craft beer in general. Awesome beer."
"I could drink this beer all the time, it is definitely worth the nametag that it carries, tugging along the burden of the brewer...excellent drinkability and a testament to the return of our barley messiah."
"Beer is a copper color with plenty of fluffy white head. Excellent lacing and clarity. Smells of earthy, piney hops, a bit of a malt background but not much. Taste is again hoppy, some light citrus taste too it with a bit of a grainy finish. Beer is very smooth and pretty light-bodied with not a ton of carbonation. A very tasty brew and one that I could drink for awhile."
"Heard a lot about this one so I finally decided to give it a try. Has a very nice, clear copper color with fluffy white head and some sediment at the bottom of the bottle. This one has a nice eartly hop aroma with not much malt. A really tastey pale, has a nice body and fruity/earthy hop notes. Overall a really good beer and one I wouldn't mind drinking a few of. I'll be sure to give this one a try next time I see it!"
"Purs a clear amber/cider with nice big 2 finger white foamy head. Smells of earthy hops with a caramel sweetness. Picked up a citrus and evergreen scent as well. Love this taste, crisp citrus mixed with a great hoppy taste. Maltiness flows through at end with nice aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Very crisp and light bodied. This is very drinkable. I can't believe I have waited this long to try SN PA, I will be drinking this a lot more."
"This is a standard-setter far pale ales, and anyone interested in the style should consider this one a mainstay."
"Conclusion: Outstanding all-round APA with great aroma and flavor hops. Maltier taste at first, but hoppier citrusy, grapefruitish in the finish. Very drinkable and excellent CO2. Highly recommended!"
"Pours a mostly clear amber with two finger white head leaving dense lacing. Smell: pale malt, piney, earthy hops, touch of caramel. Taste: pale malt, earthiness, grapefruit, pine, tangerine, and again, a little bit of caramel. Revisited this one after trying torpedo recently, still tasty and ultimately sessionable. Pretty sure SN can do no wrong with an apa or ipa."
"Cheers!"
"this simply blows the quite admirable SN ESB 2009 out of the water. and yes, that itself is a fine brew."
"Poured from a bottle a nice golden amber type color. Head was small but the lacing clung to the glass all the way down. Fairly attractive beer. Aroma is very spicy, high on citrus and hops. Notice some grains in the aroma as well. Taste is dominated by citrus with a nice hop bitterness and malt balance. I taste grapefruit. It is good grapefruit though, not the pucker your mouth grapefruit. Mothfeel is medium bodied, slightly bitter, somewhat refreshing and actually very smooth and easy. Very drinkable. I found myself thinking this beer was ok at the beginning to thinking it was really, really good by the time I finished the bottle. I really enjoyed this. Time for another..."
"A nice darker yellow with a head that retained nicely. The smell was just typical beer type smell nothing outstanding, nothing bad either, a pefect 3. Fortunately the taste was better then the smell. Piney hops, not overwhelming like a hop bomb, but certainly present. Pretty complex flavor profile for a pale ale, it wasn't a one-note hit as you could sense the malts and a fruityness of some sorts. Seemed like it was a little overcarbonated to me, maybe it was just the tap it poured from. Despite the extra bubbles, this was extremely drinkable and went extremely well with my wings."
"Golden Yellow pour. 1 finger head that left quickly. smelled of clean hops, and citrus. Taste is - wow - i really suprised at how much i like this brew. I tried this beer early on in my craft beer drinking, and thought it was not good, and was even turned off on other APA's , because of my memory of this one. But i thought i would give it another shot, as i know i didnt have quite the appreciation i do know for really good beers. Even though im still new to this, I think i have ""matured"" a little in my drinking experience/appreciation. ALL that being said, this is truly a great beer! nice, clean taste, with just a bit of hop bitterness to finish it off, and when i say in the finish, i mean way down in the back of my tounge, almost down into my throat [i may actually prefer just a touch less]. nicely done, and one i will definitely get again. this would be a great beer for drinking several of, for instance during a football game, or after mowing the lawn. pretty refreshing.This one has me excited about trying other APA's..."
"On tap (at Pub 71, Atlanta, GA) - It had a very nice clear yellow/golden color to it with a pretty big white head, that was pretty light or not dense. It was well retained. For a pale ale, I thought that the aroma was really good, light malt and hops aroma with a very light hint of sweetness. Taste was hoppy with some pine, malt and that light hint of sweetness. The flavor was really good, way better than expected. The body was light and the beer was very refreshing. Maybe slightly over carbonated, but not really to the determent to the beer. This one is a keeper. Highly enjoyed it. This one will be a staple once summer rolls around."
" After about a year of drinking better beers and appreciating flavors better, I can safely say that this is the definition of sessionable, and is probably the most solid beer that is readily available to me (like even at the corner gas station). Thus, I've bumped the ranking up from a B+ to an A-. I love this beer."
"Always a classic and have yet to meet somebody who loves beer and doesnt enjoy a snpa. Light amber/copper small amount of carbonation and head. Nice, lighter aroma and taste with a hoppy bitter finish to it. Cant taste the grapefruit like some people have. A great go to beer since its found almost anywhere and is relatively cheap. Wish i had another sitting in my fridge..."
"drinkability is good this is a great alternative compared to BMC"
"D - What can I say, this is one of the greatest session beers ever created, although some people tire of it, I never do. One of the most wonderful American Pale Ales crafted, hats off to Sierra Nevada"
"D: The drinkability of this beer is very high for me. This was the first time I had this and it was a very nice surprise. I wish I coud get it in Mexico in a near future."
"D.Very nice beer with any type of food or company good for a new beer drinker for ales"
"Very smooth and extremely easy drinking, without a doubt a great session beer. I have drank more of these than I care to count...still serves me well, almost like a safety blanket regardless of the occassion."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale poured clear and golden from the bottle. The head was dense with lots of lacing on the glass. Crisp flavor similar to a lager with some citrus. Nice carbonation helps to assert itself in ways that its mild recipe might not without it."
"With its clean, crisp, (look at me I'm stood on top of a mountain and it's so) refreshing taste it really is a beer I could drink until the cows come home. Pure Class."
"D: overall this is a really good APA, definitely put a few of these away... tasty beverage."
"I love this beer. It is always consistent. You know you're going to get a good head and it's always fresh. Good value and easy to find (even in rural Indiana). This beer is solid and so is the brewery. Thanks."
"A home brew kit I have says SN uses hop pellets to make this one... I don't think it's true.. maybe in the start!"
"Sorry about that lack of technical terms, this is my first ever review."
"D - Great drinkability. A good summer beer, I enjoy all year round. One of my favorite brews, as well as anything from SN."
"D- Very drinkable, wish the alcohol content were slightly higher, but this is definitely one of my favorite beers."
"This is definitely a drink that can be enjoyed in multiples due to its building flavors on top of itself, so I look forward to my next trip to the store."
"D: The beer's greatest quality is its drinkability. It maintains enough of a malt base to be well balanced while showcasing classic American hops. A great example of an American Pale Ale, it's an easy beer to drink and appreciate every day."
"Poured to a nice head. Head had a slight orange color to it. Also had some nice lacing. Ale was golden orange in color. Very pretty. Left some sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Had that citrus hoppy pine smell to it. Smelled good. Tasted of citrus, hoppy pine, malt, with a slight bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was good. Very drinkable. Would love to try a session with this ale. This is another one of those brews that you would have to be carefull with. They go down very smooth."
"Pours a clear orange with yellow tinted edges. There is a large soapy head that results in a thin layer, a thick ring and copious amounts of lacing all over the glass. The smell is clean and not overpowering. There is some fresh cut grass and lemon zest with a slight fruit and flower lingering in the back. The taste is not overly hoppy like too many APAs nowadays. Its clean and refreshing with a very balanced malt and hop mixture. Its a little bland for someone who is used to a lot of hops but perfect for the style. This one is great as a good old standby that can be drank all day long."
"Drinkability - I only had one with lunch, but many times before I have worked my way well into a purchased six pack. This is an easy beer to double up on."
"This beer has a nice light feel to it. Has little carbonation and is easy drinking."
"Not especially hoppy relative to what's availble today but certainly tasty. I'm sure when it was introduced it was on the leading edge of hop-forward beers. This is probably one of the better beers that's easy to find no matter where you are. It's a tribute to SN to have gotten this beer so far that it sits side-by-side with all the mass produced American macros in most bars and restaurants."
"d: a great session beer, some flavor but not enough to deter from downing a sixer in one night"
"Very great!"
"If you haven't tried it go try it a great beer."
"Very drinkable, very tasty, well balanced. Very nice."
"* This is my first review hope its ok."
"Taste had a small hoppy bite to it, but was much milder than their Celebration ale. There was also a mild sweetness that balanced it. I found it to be clean and refreshing, and paired well with pizza. I could drink more than one of these and be happy."
"D- A very drinkable beer, I could drink this beer all night."
"This is a nice example of the style, and it remains a staple in my refrigerator. It's not the best, but it is consistent and hard to beat for the price."
"Verdict: Simply brilliant and perfectly balanced, there's no wonder why this has become the classic American Pale Ale. Like Anchor Steam, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is one of the great forefathers of the American craft-brew world that still holds up to anything brewed today."
"D - Given my choice I'll take the Celebration Ale over the Pale Ale when it's available but Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a quality beer. Easily sessionable."
"Veryyy drinkable, probably the best popularity to greatness ratio in a beer."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass, about an inch of of nice creamy foam, amber red color, earthy hop smell to it. Very nice bitter sweet contrast in favor. This is nice beer because is has a lot of flavor but the abv is low enough to where you can drink a fare amount and not get too buzzed."
"This is definitely one of my favorite APAs. It is balanced nicely with the hops still maintaining the front seat. Having this on tap even makes it that much better."
"Finally reviewing this beer after having it for years. Light amber color with some yeast particles sitting on the bottom. Patchy white head that settles to a decent thin collar of foam leaving fine lace down the glass. Smells like fresh hops with mild citrus notes and doughy yeast. Tastes mild and hoppy with a solid caramel malt backbone that smoothes it out nicely. Medium smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable. This is go to beer when at normal bars and restaurant."
"im not all that into APAs, but, aside from deschutes' ""hop trip", this is my favorite pale ale. it is delicious and comes highly recommended if only for its drinkability."
"Rich golden color, with a frothy white head that laces nicely. Great citrusy/ hoppy aroma. Taste is extremely well balanced. Good bite of hops, with a pine-like component, but not overpowering. The malt also makes an appearance in this beer. Very drinkable with a clean aftertaste; a great session beer."
"Served with a glass... nice touch. Poured golden, small bubbles throughout. Smelled slightly ""off"" but this could be environment. Flavor was not as intense as I recall but carried a nice, pleasant hop bitterness... otherwise balanced. Drank cleanly & easily; nice compliment for turkey sandwich."
"it just tasted lightweight."
"Poured into chalice. Pours a clear caramel color with almost no head and no lacing. Smell is of citrus hops. Taste is a quick burst of citrus hops followed by biscuitlike malts. Mouthfeel is fairly light but dry. Definitely a sessionable beer as it's very drinkable. Surprisingly hoppy for an APA. More like an IPA in my opinion. A quality beer nonetheless."
"Poured into straight pint glass. Poured 1/2 inch of bright, white head that left a medium amount of lacing. Bright, light orange/deep yellow color. Not much malt in the nose, but solid hop presence. Flavor matches aroma closely. The lack of body is noticed right away. Very drinkable, but the flavors becomes unnoticeable quickly. This is a solid go-to beer that never lets you down, but rarely thrills the drinker. I have long maintained that, due to the prominence of hops and lack of malt body, this should be called an IPA, not a pale ale. I seem to be in a very small minority in this view."
"A straw colored yellow. thick pillowy head with lacing streaming up and down the sides of the glass. smell is malty with a hint of hops. a less hoppy smell than i remember in past tastings. taste is quite crisp with a strong malt profile to balance the hops. The hops really give a good clean bitterness towards the end., but not overwhelming."
"Light, clear orange pouring from the bottle and in the glass. Fizzy appearance with a light head. No haze at all. Piney hops in the nose. Crisp, clean mouthfeel with just a bit of a sticky finish. This is just what a pale ale should be. Definitely the standard by which pale ales should be judged."
"Liked everything about this beer except the flavor. And it goes without saying, I wouldn't, or couldn't attempt this ever again."
"It definitely isn't as exciting and hoppy as some other pale ales, but it is always consistent and that counts for something."
"Overall, as far as APAs go, this is one I could sit down with more so than the others I've had. Not too bitter but represents the style well."
"D - A refreshing brew that is delightfully simple. As stated earlier the bitterness is initially pleasant, however it seemed to wear on me after awhile. Nonetheless the taste was still pleasing. Very drinkable and would definitely have another to refresh."
"Would have liked something a bit more interesting, but overall very drinkable."
"D: I loved this beer and I cant believe I only have one. I am drinking it at a fairly warm temperate of 55 and it is going down way to fast. Still maybe a little too light. This beer would still be incredible to drink for taste as well as quenching my thirst after a strenuous activity. Like I said before this beer could be stronger. I feel as though I could drink it in 3 sips and not be satisfied after just one. That being said I wish I could drink 3 more right now. I love this beer!"
"Overall it's quite drinkable and goes down easy. It's worth trying out if you don't have any craft beer."
"mouthfeel- high carbonation. light body. no warmth. no creaminess. slight carbonic bite due to high carbonation with little malt."
"Drinkability, why not. This is my beer of choice when the taps have no other macros available, or micros for that matter. It's also the goto beer when all other stores are out of the loop. By all means, an overall a good beer."
"This is a beer that never disappoints. i often look over this beer at the store while searching for something else. but then once i get home a pour this beautiful concoction into a welcoming glass i realize the reliable snpa will always be inviting when i call her name!"
"Really solid pale ale. Decent atmosphere, not a very complex flavor but good for hopheads. Does have a bit of a metallic feel, but good drinkability."
"Highly Drinkable. Refreshing. Tasty."
"Overall: Why have I not picked this up before? I guess because of its widespread availability, I didn't take it to be a good craft brew. At a price that's only slightly higher than BMCs for a sixer, this is one deal that's hard to give up."
"Very solid beer."
"I love this beer. It was my gateway beer to craft beer and I regard it as a quintessesntial example of an American pale ale. It absolutely sets the standard."
"Drinkability: A tad on the bitter side for me, not sure why as it doesn't seem to be the hops."
"Nikki"
"Very drinkable. But not my favorites, not exactly what I call fuul flavored, kinda mild for me. But decent none the less."
"Light honey amber with some suspended yeast particles. Patchy white head that settles to a decent thin collar of foam leaving fine lace down the glass. Smells like fresh, leafy cascade hops with mild citrus notes and doughy yeast. Tastes mild and hoppy with a solid caramel malt backbone that smoothes it out nicely. Medium smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable, and the old standby for a reason..it's really good."
"Great/classic beer."
"I have had this pale ale many times and just getting around to reviewing it. It pours a nice golden amber with a head that dissipates rather quickly. The immediate aroma that I detect is a floral/piney smell. The taste is pretty smooth with acceptable bitterness and subtle malt characteristics. It has a nice mouthfeel with a semi dry finish. I could drink these through out the evening and be very satisfied. Not an overly hopped or sweet APA."
"This is a great beer. A - dark orange pour with a nice 1/2"" head, S - hoppy citrus, T - distinctly sierra taste... hoppy bite, with a citrus-y flavor, very crisp, and that sierra bite. M - just the right amount of carbonation, good mouthfeel... just the right blend of hops and citrus. D - I could easily sit through a sixer in a night, or steadily drink them at the bar."
"Overall: Enjoyable, One I won't hesitate to pick up from time to time for sure. Good Drinking!"
"Crisp and balanced hops and malt in that livey, fresh style that I find typical of Californian beers. Highly carbonated but not innapropriate. Makes me want to mow a lawn."
"Great for introducing people to the style. I am going to introduce my father to APAs with a bottle of Sierra Nevada tonight!"
"D: By style one of the best. Crisp, refreshing with a great malting and true to style. Case worthy by all means a go to for that summer picnic to quench the thirst with a citrusy blast."
"This is a great session beer, and a fine example of an APA. Obviously, no one needs me to tell them that. A fine Rock Band beer, too. I would never, ever feel bad about this being in my fridge."
"Drinkability. Overall an excellent beer. Kind of the staple for its kind. Probably one of the most available craft beers out there."
"D: The crispness ultimately wins out over what I'm perceiving as thinness. This is a pretty drinkable brew. Just slightly high on the ABV to be a session beer, I suppose, but still one of which I'd have a few in a row. Given its availability, this ought to be a staple for any beer drinker to keep on hand...or at least an excellent fallback option."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: A good beer that is eaasy to find. Could be a daily drinker."
"This is a fine Pale Ale. I usually prefer highly bitter IPAs. But if I wanted something with bitterness that was easy to drink, this would be one of my top choices."
"D: This one is a classic and with is relatively easy to find at most bars and some restaurants (even in Mississippi). I always have a few of these either in the cabinet or in the fridge."
"A go-to pale ale. Always good, always available. Pours clear copper with a short white head. Clean, fresh floral hop aroma with shrap, crystal malt. Taste is representative of the aroma, citrus hops taking a back seat to the tangier malt. Would rather drink an AleSmith brew, but I'm not going to whine if this is my only option."
"Overall a solid beer and definitely a go-to choice when at a restaurant with otherwise only crappy macros."
"A classic of the style. Sometimes I forget how good these old reliables really are."
"D- I really like this beer. Hoppy with a nice full body."
"Pours a nice clear copper with a good off white head that does not last very long. very fine bubbles throughout.The smell is floral and citrusy. Fantastic bitter hop taste but not too overpowering. Dry finish with hoppy aftertaste. Very drinkable ale."
"Pours a bit darker than expected, looks wonderful. Smells hoppy with hints of citrus fruit. Taste is malty, very citrusy, crisp, incredibly easy to drink. This gets me excited for Sierra Nevada's IPA. Really complete, excellent tasting beer that's unbelievably easy to drink. A-level beer. Didn't notice too much of a difference from the bottle, to be honest."
"Ah SN pale ale. What can you say? Aroma is nicely balanced between hops and caramel. Appearance is light copper with a white head. Flavor is hoppy and balanced. Mouthfeel is bright and hoppy, finishing clean. Overall, this beer is the epitome of the American Pale Ale style. I drink this beer every chance I get."
"D: It's hard to have this much flavor at 5.6%. This is one you can enjoy beer after beer.."
"So remember, next time your at Noodles, choose a Sierra Nevada!"
"good beer"
"drinkability- it's a no brainer. it's easy to drink and the dry feel to it leaves you wanting more."
"D - gets a 5 for me. I can find this anywhere and I can drink this anytime."
"Drinkability: Very Very Drinkable beer that is clean and refreshing."
"The pour is amber hue, with carbonation. The nose is citrus, yeast and hints of malt. Taste is citrus and floral, with hints of yeast and malt. Finish is bitter and dry. Overall very good pale ale... Although I will have to say that is pale ale has an assault on your palate."
"Drinkability: A good, drinkable beer all-around. Definitely something I'll go for in the future, might be something I'll have around for parties. Can't believe I passed on this beer for so long."
"Drinkability: A solid pale ale by Sierra Nevada. Highly recommended for fans of the style, beer noobs, or beer advocates in general. Peace out..."
"D - Very drinkable ale not too hoppy and a rather smooth brew."
"My first advice to myself if and when I start homebrewing is to break into Sierra Nevada after hours and steal all their ingredients. I'm positive my beer will be stunning if I do, even if I end up microwaving it and stirring the wort in an unwashed kettle in which I cooked beef stew three days ago."
"Drinkability: An excellent beer from SN that will continue to get praise. Behind Celebration Ale, this is the best dose of good hops I've had in a while. A creeper beer that is highly recommended in my book."
"Pours a clear golden/yellow color. Decent head with little retention and little lacing. Smells strongly of hops. Fits the pale ale style quite nicely. Strong bitterness of hops with average carbonation. Could have a little more flavor, but overall very good beer."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer pours a clear copper color with a pretty head-and leaves nice lacing. It has a pleasant hoppy aroma- like walking the smell of a christmas tree. The beer is crisp with mild pine accents. The finish is dry with a mild piney aftertaste. A medium bodied beer that I could drink all day. This is the APA all others should be compared to. Overall a very well rounded beer, and one of the ones that got me interested in craft brews."
"D - I do not think of myself as a hophead, and read that this is a good introduction to IPA's. I certainly get the bitter flavor, but enjoyed the fruitiness. I assume the bitter aftertaste is what the hopheads enjoy. This was a an enjoyable beer, and certainly can be followed by a few more. I can see this one catching up to you after a few."
"D: Great beer all around. We just finished off a keg of this and we might need to get another."
"Not really an aftertaste with perfect carbonation."
"Reviewed on 4/5/08. Bottle. Pours amber with a small white head. Smells of flowery soap (not that it smells like soap, just the flowery notes of some soaps). Taste of flowery hops, some spices. An excellent pale ale, hoppier than some. 7/4/6/4/13 (3.4/5)"
"The best beer on tap at lots of places that otherwise offer very little."
"Overall this is a great beer and has to be the top american ale to start off on if your getting into craft beer. I won't leave this behind either."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I could find myself enjoying 3-5 of these on any occasion. I can't get over those dry citrus/pine notes, and that dominate hop bitterness! Nice and rich, the flavors marry so well together. Very decently priced, I absolutely love this beer. Everyone must try this, even if you must seek to find. Believe me, its worth it. Cheers!"
"On tap, the taste is really rather bland, with just some hops, mostly grapefruit and other citrus, plus a light grain quality that mostly takes over in the end."
"The brew pours with about a finger of good persistent head which leaves a bit of lacing. Color is a rich golden hue which is a bit pale due to the unfiltered suspended particles. Taste is clean crisp and fresh with a definite hop character. Malts are subdued but lend some balance to the flavor. Taste does finish with touch of dryness. Mouthfeel is light which equates with a high drinkability and the carbonation is just about right. Overall this is a highly drinkable beer that really good."
"Mouthfeel: not overcarbonated, which is often the biggest turn off for me in a pale ale"
"The drinkability of this beer is good because it's a rather solid brew with an unashamed hop presence. Another great beer from SNBC, and one of my stand-by APAs."
"Clear bronze color, with a nice two finger white head that lasts a bit. A little lacing. A nice floral,citrus hop aroma,a little spice. Flavor is citrus hops,pine and a caramel malt backbone . Nice mouthfeel. This is a big hop pale ale,very drinkable and enjoyable"
"Medium bodied, smooth feel, nicely carbonated. Quite frankly this is an eminently drinkable APA. I usually pass it up in the store in search of anything new or different, but I'm glad I snagged a sixer tonight."
"D: Super high! My go-to beer, and breakfest drink of choice!"
"I had this while eating Mexican food. It really went well with the spice hot nachos. I enjoyed the beer this time, so much so that I had two El Gordo glasses (22-ounce) and got to take home to Sierra Nevada logo glasses."
"One to always have in the fridge. Also the perfect beer with which to turn macro drinkers on the the good stuff."
"Citrusy aroma, with some slight hop bitterness. Taste is similar. Crisp and refreshing, with slightly sweet citrus notes, ending with alcohol warmth and hop bitterness. Nicely balanced between malt and hops, as it should be. A wonderful APA, however I don't if it is the best, although it may be considered a classic."
"D - This beer has some serious drinkability. It has a really good flavor that is not overpowering, but is smooth and refreshing."
"Great beer. First time trying it, but will definitely buy this one again sometime. Should be on everyones list of a beer to try at least once."
"Sierra Nevada is rightfully regarded as the grandfather of the American craft beer revolution. Their pale ale was particularly inspirational for a generation of craft brewers that were now re-inventing old world styles and hopping at levels previously unheard of - All hail it !"
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale pours a nice light copper/bronze color with a one finger head. It has a pleasing citrus hoppy aroma that I really like. This beer has a nice mouthfeel. Am I tasting orange in this beer? Finishes dry with just the right amount of hops. Wow, I'm impressed with this beer's nice flavor. May be the perfect ""better"" beer for newbies due to the decent amount of hops and easy drinkability. A fine APA which seems to be available in many Wal-Marts and Winn- Dixie's across Alabama."
"Pours golden amber with a tight beige head that falls to a nice lace. Nose is pine with biscuty malt then follows to a slight citrus. Hops are spicy, fruity, and floral while the Cascade bitterness lasts throughout the tasting to the back of the throat with easy carbonation. So many flavors in this brew and is so drinkable."
"The grand-daddy of PA's never fails. This one is especially fresh and ""bright"" tasting. Likely due to the foot-traffic Hog Island receives - keep rolling those kegs!"
"Overall, I would drink it if it was there, or in the absence of one of my favorites, but I am not going to seek it out. I suppose I am not quite as impressed as I should be, given its reputation."
"This beer is an excellent example of this style. Easily sessionable, refreshing, very nice carbonation and a very nice piney aftertaste. Due to the overall availability of this beer, it has become my session beer of choice as of late. I can get it at any liquor/grocery store and a good majority of bars around here carry it as well."
"D= Awesome, great for watching a game and relaxing after a long kayaking trip."
"the classic pale ale. I have had this may times before but I just had one last night and it reminded me how much I really like it. I had it on tap and it pours with a beautiful head. Nice deep golden color with nice fulffy white head. The scent is very strong with the hops but the taste is balanced when you drink it. It's a great hot day beer or for tailgating. It can be used in alot of diffrent recipes and goes great with a wide variety of food. This isnt the best beer on the market but proably the best american pale ale. I love the drinkablity and I will continue to drnk this when I have the chance to."
"Overall a solid standby beer, one I don't mind having around at all times."
"One good Pale ..Poured a orange color with a finger-width, creamy white head that leaves lots of lacing as you drink. Scent is surprisingly not as hoppy as I would have thought. Lots of fruit and a woody/grassy aroma I couldn't place. Palate is crisp, clean and very dry. Not as hoppy as a lot of Pales and IPAs. You get a slight hop burn on the tongue, but it's balanced enough to let the grapefruit and spices come through."
"Perhaps the definition of sessionable in my opinion. Refreshing even more so when thinking about having a few of these after a warm summer day."
"This is one of the beers that made me realize that I love hops, I remember being 13 and going to my yuppie aunt and uncle's house for holidays and they would always have this in the fridge, needless to say it was love at first sip."
"piney hops on the tongue too, bit of malt in the back, goes down well, classic beer, the be all and end all of session beers IMO"
"D= A classic ale and it had been way too long since I had one on tap. Easily drinkable and full of flavor, this is an excellent session beer."
"Drinkability: Not too heavy, relatively low ABV, and tastes fine. Could go through a few with ease"
"Highly drinkable and very well balanced. The quintessential American Pale Ale is a perfect session beer and would make a superb entry into the world of craft brew for any of the uninitiated."
"It has a really nice balance. I could drink these all day long. In fact, I was recently talking with a friend of mine about what beer we would choose if we could have an unlimited supply of only one beer for consumption while trapped on a desert island. This was my choice."
"D-Sessionable and refreshing."
"Love this beer because it is everywhere!"
"D: Never really cared for their stuff. This is overated but drinkable. I just associate it with the 90s when you would ask people if they were into good beer and they would say they loved sierra Nevada. Decent but better stuff out there for half the price."
"i have had this beer many times before but never reviewed it...now that its been a while since i last had it i figured i'd get to reviewing...now i remember why i used to buy it all the time...time to get more...another great job from sierra nevada...i have never had a bad beer by these guys...all are solid...get some if you never had it.."
"Overall, this will continue to sit near the top of my favorite beers. A good beer for a lovely sunny fall day."
"This is a great APA. I usually go to IPA's, but this ale is good enough to stand up to some of the best. Pours nice, decent head, nice nose. Lots of hop character not usually found in this style of ale., very nicely bitter finish. There is no way not to like this ale, it tastes great, is very drinkable, and is very friendly on the wallet when you compare it to IPA's and DIPA's. Every product I've tried from this family of beer and ales has been superb."
"I'd say this beer is quite drinkable, this being my second one tonight actually. It goes down smooth and tasty. Friends of mine all found it to their liking when I let them taste it as well."
"Over the last month I have chosen mainly imported beers that get great grades on this very site, & this Pale Ale did not disappoint...my goodness I have tasted way harsher Pale Ales."
"D. A nice pale ale. Pretty much the definition of the style. Solid and a worthy of a staple."
"Very drinkable, and a good ale all around. I wouldn't mind keeping a 12 pack in the fridge pretty regularly."
"What else am I supposed to say to fill up 250 characters? The beer's great. Go try it!"
"Took me a while to finally try this one but I did it and found a great, drinkable beer. Has a unique, characteristic taste to it that must be from different types of hops no usually used on the east coast. It's crisp, refreshing, very well balanced.. if aint broke dont fix it."
"This is an exceedingly drinkable beer. In fact I plan on finishing my six pack in the next few hours as I enjoy the afternoon."
"D - One of the most drinkable craft beers out there. Full of flavor and pretty unoffensive. A great stand-by."
"D- Nice interplay of hop bite and sweetness. Flavours not overpowering and this makes for a sessionable yet interesting ale. A Winner!"
"This is probably many BA's gateway beer. This wasn't my first craft brew, but it was about my favorite. Great beer that should be shared with as many people as possible."
"D-This one has given me many a headache which earns it a 5 in Drinkability"
"D - Very high. All day with any food."
"D - this makes for a perfect go-to beer. It is also a hoppier version of a pale ale, but the increased hops works well in this beer. This is one of my staples when I am out at bars without much variety. Always a good choice."
"This is the Pale Ale most breweries try to replicate."
"Poured into a pint glass pours a copper color with a foamy one finger head that leaves some nice thick heavy lace. Smell is pretty malty, I was expecting a bit more hop smell in the nose but the malt was overwhelming. THis beer is so smooth and goes down very well a nice balance with the hop and the malt not overpowering but a nice solid flavor of earth and citrus. I have had this beer alot and have never reviewed it, this is a classic that should be in everyones beer refrig truly an amazing product from an amzing brewer."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. A session beer if I have ever had one, what with the generally low abv (comparatively) and the tastiness. I am looking forward to making the original recipe that you can find in Papazian's book."
"This light amber brew throws out dense white head that creates a nice lacing throughout the entire beer. There is a wonderful blast of hops in the aroma. The flavor follows this same trend. Great hop character with a fantastic understated bitterness. Underlying malt is sufficient. Pretty clean tasting for an ale. This is one that is good to go all night. One of my favorite Pale Ales."
"It has the requisite bite, pale color, low ABV, but it's a bit more obvious & less refined that the class of the APA field. But a good beer to go & sip around a bonfire on a warm fall night, which is what I will be doing in roughly five minutes."
"I do enjoy this beer, I just think it is over rated a bit. Lots of bitter grapefruit and not much malt balance. If that is your thing, then its all good. Its not mine. Though I would not hesitate to drink this as a fall back when nothing else good was around."
"I was eating various cheese cubes and mashed potatoes - but this would have been good on it's own I think - good beer."
"This was one of my first beers and still one of my favorites. GREAT pale ale."
"M/D - Medium bodied. Easily drinkable. Hops are a little strong for an APA, but I consider that a good thing."
"Poured to my pint glass from 12oz bottle. Cloudy amber color with good carbonation and nice head. Smells of nuts,citrus hops, alittle sweet malts. Tastes of pine and hops and malts top it off. Light/medium body. This has a good drinkability beer that is readily available. Id get this again"
"Overall this is very nice example of an American Pale Ale."
"Very drinkable overall; thanks to the lowish ABV, something I could actually drink all night."
"The taste is hoppy and floral, with a nice malty sweetness, grapefruit, and a slight sourness. The aftertaste is nicely sour and bitter. A good brew."
"3.5	D a bit one-dimensional, but can be worth having two during a session. the wide availability means it can on occassion save you from having something very bad at a bar or restaurant."
"Drinkability- Very high. An easy drinking pale ale. My go to at bars with a dubious beer menu."
"What a great, solid beer. Clean and refreshing for any season. A real drinker here, which is scary. Classic APA all the way."
"It isn't the best Pale Ale on the planet but it is timeless and tasty. I would gladly shell out my money for this brew anytime. Good stuff."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a medium yellow-orange color with a small creamy off-white head. Aroma is almost all hops with some pine and citrus. Flavor is of sweet caramel malts and bitter spicy hops. Very well balanced, good pale ale. Finishes astringent and dry on tongue. An easy 'go-to' beer when the best beer you can get within an hour drive is SN or Rogue."
"drinkability for me is decent,however a bit hoppier than I prefer, but a very good example of the style."
"D: for a relatively higher hopped beer, this beer does alright as far as drinkability goes, i really like to drink a few when i choose to drink them. a great standby beer when i can't decide on anything."
"D: This is pretty refreshing beer, good for hot afternoons. I would excitedly have it again."
"This is the standard for American pale ales and what they all should try to live up to. A great thirst quencher and summer beer. This one is going on regular rotation in my fridge."
"Pours a clear golden amber with a small white fluffy head that dissipates quickly to a ring leaving only a little lacing. The aroma is big on citrus hops with grapefruit up front and a hint of pine in the background. The taste starts with a big citrus hop bite up front before giving way to the malt backbone. There is a little pine bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is fresh and clean with good carbonation but a tad light for my liking. This is certainly one of the best mainstream beers out there and one that I order frequently when there's not a lot else available. Good stuff."
"On tap, out of the bottle, I always enjoy this beer. Copper color with moderate off-white head and some lacing. A bit floral, nicely hopped, with grapefruit, moderate bitterness and some sweet malt for a nicely balanced beer. This is a solid beer and probably easy to find for most people."
"Strong hoppy aroma with a floral hint. Copper color. Pours with a nice thick head that shows great retention. Delicate bubbles leave good lacing too. Medium bodied and bitter with a crisp, dry finish. Smooth and refreshing. The light carbonation makes you want to savor it and swish it around in your mouth. This is a good beer (you can see why it's their flagship) and you could easily drink it all night."
"Pretty amazing how SN can brew so much of this and keep the quality this high. Prost!"
"D: It had been a while since I had had one of these. A great pale ale, but not as great as I remembered. I think that this is a perfect beer for a 4th of July picnic or a baseball game. Highly drinkable, well worth seeking out."
"I find this to be a good session beer as I could easily enjoy a six-pack in a sitting. There is a slight hint of alcohol (at 5.6% ABV), but definitely not overwhelming."
"very strong hop flavor. a great ale. i got a six pack of this from my dad for my 21st birthday. up there with samuel adam's as one of the best american brewed beers. i usually like the european imports myself but this beer can give them competition."
"D- i bought a 12 pack for the DMB concert and they went down smooth and very easy. Flavorful and easy to put down as a summer beer."
"Very good brew, can drink plenty of these."
"Quite the find this one was,recommended by the waiter at the Sheraton restaraunt just outside Disneyland,a medium amber color,with a bubbly creamy off white head that left some sticky lacing,a great scent of citrus,some pine,nice hoppy aroma to it.Taste was a great blend of hops and malts, also hinted of citrus some grapefruit and very nice spicy touch to it.Medium mouthfeel to this one all going down rather nicely,can't get this one in my area,will try this one again next time i come across it,very enjoyable and highly recommended."
"Probably my favorite casual drinker. I can always finish off the night with one of these. I love the taste - not extreme but there is definitely something going on with every sip. Excellent taste and drinkability - I'm not blown away by the smell or appearance so much, but then again, for me, its a casual drinker, and I always recommend it. And honestly, I want just as much out of a casual drink than anything else - it has to taste good, and this Pale Ale definitely does."
"D - Pretty decent. Personally I found several other pales more drinkable but this is a good stand by and usually readily available."
"Overall: good stuff."
"D: It doesn't get much more drinkable then this. Hop heads appreciate it and even those just starting to get into hops can find it flavorful. Good to introduce to friends thta don't regularly get good beer."
"I have been drinking this for 20 years. I have tried so many other beers all over the spectrum all over the world. I always can't wait to get back to my home in N. California to have a couple. Contrary to the beer tasting advice I like them iced. Since I met my wife ten years ago, there has only been a couple of times we have been without."
"Overall if you haven't tried this, try it, but really who hasn't? It's a little better on tap than what I've had from the bottle - looks prettier and the flavors are a little more subdued and crisper. Definitely worth a try on tap if you've only had it from a bottle. If you've never tried it then definitely try it, be it from a tap or from a bottle."
"Recommended."
"Definitely a nice surprise, I had a feeling this ale would be good but not this good! Pours a nice copper color with decent creamy head and an abundance of lacing. The aroma is highly hopped with a nice malt scent. Mouthfeel is thick and filling with an unbelievably smooth crisp finish. The flavor is the perfect balance of bittering hops and malts for a pale ale. This is a great standard for the pale ale style and an exceptional example."
"Golden in colour, great clarity for a bottle conditioned beer and an ample white head. Big hop aroma up front, tangerines and rockmelons with the malt peeking through as the beer warmed up. A firm hop slap up front with all the fruitiness of the aroma which gives way to a wonderfully round, bready malt flavour. The bitterness is well balanced and gives a crisp end to the maltiness. The mouthfeel is middle to thin with the carbonation just a bit high for my liking. This combines with the relatively high abv to inhibit the drinkability for me. This beer comes with quite a reputation and I'm happy to say it lives up to it. A great example of an APA, able to showcase the hops whilst allowing the malt to shine through too."
"Maybe I'm become too much of a snob, but I can't say that this is a beer to seek out. Clearly it's everywhere so nobody really needs to put any effort into it. If this is on tap and not much else is, then enjoy. If you're at a place with 500+ beers, you might want to try something a bit more ""interesting."""
"This beer pours a nice semi cloudy amber with beautiful carbonation in it with atleast two fingers of head. The smell is mild of nuts and hops. The taste is very smoothe of a nice well balanced Pale Ale, you can not compare this beer to Alpha King Pale Ale but it is a very nice Pale ale. I was worried about the mouthfeel since the carbonation looked high but you barely notice it when you drink it and its an incredibly smoothe beer. An incredibly drinkable beer, nothing about it would slow you down. Well done and I look forward to more!"
"D: Really good brew for a majorly produced micro. It really does deliver and really impressed me for the amount of beer they pump out. Sierra Nevada is about 10 bucks a sixer here and I tend to stay away from it because I can get some good brews for about 2 bucks less around here. Sill this is a good beer and my opinions are changing."
"This was actually one of my first beers in the craft brew realm some 15 years ago. I saw it on tap a local hangout and decided to give it a shot. I've been drinking it ever since, so I figured I might as well put in my two cents. It's a great looking beer with a good sized head that laces down the glass, as the beer is finished. What I love most is the smell of this pale ale with its piny/citrusy hop aroma balanced with malt goodness. This taste is usually great though there are times where I noticed pronounced differences in the beer from batch to batch. I've found that this beer can be quite variable in aroma and taste. Usually, it hits the spot perfectly. I had it with sliced BBQ beef brisket at Joey's in Pomona and it complimented and held up quite nicely the smokiness and tangy sweetness of the BBQ sauce."
"Overall it's a very good beer that I would drink again."
"Notes: The drinkability deserves the tag that Bud light uses ""superior drinkability"". Session beer for sure and a beer more than worthy of stocking up on for the summer months. Good brew."
"A nice copper colored body with a small, short lived head that leaves some spotty lacing. Has a nice citrus hop aroma with some bready malt. The taste is nicely balanced between the hops and a malt profile that supports the flavors nicely. Has a lively carbonation that leaves a crisp finish. A APA that can found at most places and a worthy go-to beer."
"D--Though not a knockout in flavor, the clean finish makes it easy to keep sipping. The brew blended well with my meal, and I had no problems downing 24oz in a sitting."
"D: Highly drinkable, this is a beer that could definitely be sessioned. I continue to be impressed by Sierra Nevada."
"Drinkability: Well balanced but the hops make it just a few before I'm ready for a change."
"Pours a very nice copper color with nice head and good lacing. It has a nice scent, slightly floral and hoppy, but it's not as strong as I would have expected. Nice taste, it had excellent American and English virtues, with a nice hoppiness (both citrus and slightly beef jerkyish) with a mellow bitter aftertaste. Goes down fine, a good pale ale."
"All in All this is a great beer, as well as a legend in the craft category. I can remember trying this beer for the first time about 11 yrs ago, And although at the time I found it to be extremely hoppy (TIMES HAVE CHANGED!!) but I also found it to be a tremendous all around beer."
"D- Not as great of an APA as others I have had, but definitely a respectable APA that can be enjoyed almost anytime. Would make a great session beer."
"Unless they water down this beer it will always be one of my default beers-- a welcome beer I'll always come back to."
"Overall, a good example of a traditional APA."
"-D- The classic APA this is solid in every aspect of the style. I've been drinking this one for years and will continue to do so. Cheers!"
"A true American classic. The American craft beer movement owes this beer a debt of gratitude, one I'm more than happy to repay now and again by draining a glass."
"Damn! That's a good beer. The initial hop-attack wipes all other tastes from the palate clearing its way like an invading army. The fresh, crisp taste that follows is one welcomed aftershock. This beer also features a characteristic that is hard to find in most others, its highly drinkable over a period of time. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale never loses its allure throughout a day or for that matter, day after day. This is a great ""go to"" beer whether you're entertaining others on a holiday or just want something to sip on during the NBA Finals. Every swig leaves you wanting more of the bitter yet fresh and satisfying taste of this beer. It's very consistent and the alcoholic punch isn't a bad repercussion either. So sit back and enjoy a great brew, possibly the best American Pale Ale there is."
"I can't help but to feel patriotic when I enjoy this craft classic. I would join a local militia and defend this country solely for its heroic efforts devoted when brewing this precedent for American Pale Ales. Light on the malt, perfectly overflexed with hop bitterness, this beer boasts balance. Touch of dessert bread met by clean, citrus bitterness. Pure perfection when following the criteria for what an American Pale should be. I would present this hop cake at any close friend's birthday. Definitely a recomendation for any beer drinker making the transition from tastless, mass-produced, heartless, garbage drinker to craft brew enthusiast. America, once again a shining beacon of light...in the world of beer at best."
"this is a beautifal song to the hop, i cracked the top and the hops jumped from the bottel to my nose, i poured into a glass and was happy to see the purfict hue for a pale, ther was a great start to the beer, kind of sweet and lightley carobanated, then the hops overpower the grain, thay hit hard and after you swallo, the bitterness fades to a fregrant spring day flavor. start to finish, the purfict after work take into the shower with you beer"
"Overall: A well rounded pale ale. To be honest, I expected a more powerful West Coast hop presence, but they've saved that craft for other brews. I believe this to be an excellent introductory beer to those just learning to appreciate hops."
"Nice APA, not overly hoppy, balanced with taste of some pine, some citrus. Flavor is not overpowering like some in this class. Cascade hops add some ""distinction"" to the taste. Am waiting to go to my local watering hole to try this on tap, as they just started serving this beer! Overall, very drinkable indeed."
"Just a great classic pale ale. If there weren't so many thousands of other beers to try I would be picking these up all the freaking time."
"Drinkability is outstanding. I often find myself drinking more Sierra Nevadas just so that I can go out and buy more Sierra Nevadas."
"All in all, a very good APA!"
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a classic American Pale Ale. It may not be the best pale ale in America, but it's still very good and it stands as a benchmark to the American Pale Ale style. The citrus hop profile and the malty backbone make this a beer worth seeking out."
"I just had this beer on tap and I was very impressed with the hop flavor as opposed to the bottled beer. Absolutly no harshness to the hops at all. The caramel malts were well balanced to the hops. Very Very good beer when served draft. Highly recommended."
"Grabbed a bottle of this when we stopped into TC's Lounge late night this past Friday. Poured into a pint glass, with a large white head forming. Pumpkin orange color. Smell was a bit tingly, with lots of hops present. Taste is awesome, as this beer is the definition of a pale ale. Hoppy, smooth, crisp, with a bite, you can't go wrong if this is all they have for decent beer. You'll find this stuff everywhere. It's a treat, or it's a last resort, oddly enough. Even dive bars carry it. That said, it's a bit too hoppy for my liking, so I never really order more that one of these."
"Extremely drinkable and refreshing, this is a yardstick in the craft beer world with good reason."
"D: Very drinkable session beer. Taste and smell don't blow me out of the water, so I'm ranking this lower than if they were really exciting."
"Solid yellow in color, with white head, it smells moderately of hops and a hint of spice. Tastes moderately of hops and citrus, a teeny bit of malt, and has a strong amount of carbonation. Just a damn solid American Pale Ale that I tend to take for granted until I find myself in a jam, and I learn to appreciate it all over again."
"Although heavy on the hops and citrus, this beer is quite simply excellent for many different foods, climates, and occasions, and quite possibly is the reference beer for the American Pale Ale style. Love it."
"Drinkability: One of those perfect chill-out, highly drinkable beers. Nothing you have to think about, but with plenty of taste and substance."
"T: Smooth, medium bodied. Malty, biscuit body with a earthy flavor, grain, and floral hops, citrus rind finish. Amazingly refreshing and drinkable."
"Nice clean sharp hop bitterness at first, then a malt smoothness takes over, and then it goes dry and sharp hop bitterness for the finish. An exceptional APA, in fact I think it to be the quintesential APA in every respect. For a big-quasi-regional-semi-craft brewery, I love the consisitance in the quality, fair pricing/value, and good flavors!"
"I think this is a benchmark beer. When I think APA, I think Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. There may be some better out there, but not many, and never as widely available. This is craft beer at it's finest...well, Sam Adams is not bad either."
"12 oz bottle from a 12 pack case in to an imp pint glass. Pours a golden orange color with an off white head. Light, sweet citrusy smell with pine in the background. Slightly hoppy balance taste with the smells in the background. Some orange taste. Nice easy to drink pale ale. Renowned for its quality, and rightly so. Of beers recognized by non beer people- it is the best."
"This is one of my regular brews along with sweetgrass, so maybe I under rate it. It's a great ale. I like it because it's somewhat hoppy/piney. Buy some and drink it. GREAT pour! The thing that I like the best about this particular brew is that it's a good drink, but available nearly everywhere out here. I got this one at Hooligan's in Pocatello, Idaho;)"
"Drinkability: One of the most drinkable beers out there. Nice flavor and nice balanced complexity. This is a great beer for any type of drinker and does not disappoint. Highly recommended."
"This is the staple of the frisbee cricut, always availabe. Once I showed up to a tournament this weekend my friend had one right away for me. I would always take a 6 pack of Sierra Nevada when I would go on the road to a tournament. Anyways the look of the beer has a dark amber color, little foam that disappears quickly. Smells of hops and some fruit good smell overall. The taste is very hoppy and fruity, excellent taste. The feel is smooth with carbonation, good wetness. The drinkability is very good, with an extra sweetness at the end."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and snappy, this is a great hot weather beer, not to heavy in the stomach, I can and have drunk way to many of these in one sitting, very easy drinker - an exceptional world classic!"
"The mouthfeel is very carbonated but still smooth. This is a great session beer and a very refreshing pale ale."
"Very smooth, light, refreshing. Medium bodied with an exceptionally drinkability. One the quintessential American style Pale Ales and a wonderful beer."
"Quaffing beer that reminds you of when you first discovered good beer could be had. This beer reminds me of some other brewer's IPA's..."
"A very drinkable pale ale. Really nicely balanced and very refreshing. Folks from the states come to Australia and often compare Little Creatures Pale Ale to SNPA, and I'm glad I can now do the same. It would be great to drink SNPA all the time, but I don't think I'm really missing out given I have Critters here in Australia to fill the gap."
"I think this beer has it all; taste, drinkability, and it's affordable. A perennial favorite."
"I'd prefer more malt balance. This brew's one note short of a chord: A little more hop-to-malt harmony, and I'd be dancing."
"D - One of my favorite beers. Goes down so well. Very easy to drink."
"One of my favorite session beers."
"Well gotta say, I still have a soft spot for this guy. Definitely the one that got me into craft beer, and still a win over most of the stuff out there. Pours a delicious deep amber color with a colossal head that leaves outstanding lacing. Seriously, this beer looks amazing. Nose is solid - maltier than I remembered, but lots of swirling citrus and light floral hops as well. Taste is likewise. Strong and delicious, lots of caramel malt balanced nicely with the mildly spicy grapefruit hops. Feel is good, medium body with solid carbonation. Really, an excellent beer. Might have to switch to these more often if prices keep going up like they are."
"D: I can't stop. Give me a case."
"A light hoppy aroma with notable floral and citrus segues to a great taste and a very pleasant finish. This is one of the most consistent brews I've experienced, be it in the bottle or on tap. No more twist-offs though, as they went to pry off tops a year or so back. So don't forget the opener."
"Light orange appearance with a white head. Good amount of lacing. Smells of flowery hops, citrus, and yeast. Taste is bitter at first, then rather sweet, and again, citrusy--much like grapefruit. Mouthfeel is crisp, rather carbonated at first taste. This is a very drinkable APA. I've been drinking it for years and it's consistently great. This is just about the best APA out there in my estimation."
"Drinkability is outstanding. Two or three or these is a great night. Along with Bell's Two Hearted this beer defines the gold standard for Pale Ales."
"D: Despite its strong floral hops and relatively high bitterness, it's a great beer anytime (and thankfully available nearly everywhere). A go-to beer anytime."
"Taste is perhaps a little insipid, but with lots of bitterness. Aftertaste is very smooth bitter and the mouthfheel is excellent. Goes down very easily."
"D - Definitely a solid session beer here. Nice hop flavors, light bodied, low ABV...easy drinking, for sure"
"D: Great session beer. Pairs well with Tex-Mex food."
"Overall - A very good American Pale Ale, but I still prefer Little Creatures Pale Ale."
"Have had this numerous times, and I was at a bar and got a draft and had a pen on me, so I wrote a review. A rich, copper hue with a one-finger mountain head that dies so slowly, leaving a lace ring down the entire glass. A hop smell is prevelant, floral and citrus, with some malts in there and a light alcohol smell. Full-bodied and creamy - delicious - with a coffee/bread malt taste on the back, blended with some hops for a semi-dry backbite. Has a citric taste going down before the, like orange and maybe lemon (MAYBE) and some sweetness in it like there's caramel or honey in it. A quintessential microbrew to be enjoyed by everyone."
"pours up good looking golden brown, nice white head. definite hop spicyness in the nose. also some subtle malt. there's a little bit of citrusy hop smell too. also taste of hop bitterness for sure. pretty light bodied, medium carbo, easy drinking, great session pale."
"D - easy drinking brew."
"Now if I can just find Lagunitas IPA down here I'll be such a happy camper !!"
"D: ""This beer drank pretty good, don't it?"" It's refreshing, well-balanced, and light--this is a great session APA. It's got a nice balance of hop bitterness/tang with malt sweetness, and is a safe choice. I could definitely kick a few of these back."
"The mouthfeel is medium with a bit of creaminess to finish. The beer is highly refreshing and has fair amount of carbonation. The beer is dangerously drinkable and would pair nicely with a sweet dessert. My personal favorite pairing is New York style cheesecake."
"D-Very easy to drink i could easily see myself having them on a regular basis"
"D: This is very drinkable, but on a happy stomach, this could cause problems if you haven't eaten."
"Drinkability - hops are a bit much for a session beer, but two will do you just fine."
"Throwing horseshoes over at my neighbors' I was able to sample three beers one right after the other. Good opportunity for comparison, as horseshoes is always a multiple beer event. Anyway, the three included my old stand by, Sweetwater 420, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, and Sweetwater IPA. In my estimation, the Sweetwater IPA was the far superior of the three. Better flavor and drinkability. I was struck by how similar the 420 and the Sierra Nevada tasted. However, I think I would slightly give the nod to the Sierra Nevada. Its taste is better than average, with hoppiness and sweet malt balanced. Some cloying straw taste that is also in the 420, but not so much. Interesting that before I started sampling widely from other beers recently, I didn't notice the straw flavor in 420. It was my favorite beer. Now, I would be pretty loathe to go back to it. Luckily, Sweetwater's IPA is so good that I can still give my business to that local brewery."
"Highly recommended."
"I could sit here and drink this beer all day long. Gold color, medium-size white head, little bit of lacing. Mostly malt aroma, a little bit of citrus. The citrus comes through more in the taste, and I think it intensifies in your mouth. A little bit of malt in the taste also."
"Classic APA i remember this being the first true real beer ever tasting. Appearence is golden copper with champange like carbonation rising to a thin bubbley head. smell is of citrus hops, grapefruit, with grass malt like undertones, alchole soaked all wheat bread is present as well. Taste is crisp dry citrus, flowers, grapefruit and bready. Great beer will never pass it up."
"D- Drinks good but the grapefruit is too much for me to pound this beer down"
"M&D: A rather light and dry brew. Carbonation is fine but brisk and the brew has a smooth disposition. A fantastic beverage but I might have considered it an IPA. Especially if you like hops, grab one of these!"
"A very nice beer that is balanced and full of flavor. A great beer to have with burgers and steaks. This is my go-to when available and there is nothing new for me to try."
"Readily available in most of my local grocery stores, I have no good excuse not to keep this fine brew in my fridge."
"though my rating scale might not specifically reflect my love for this beer i have to say it is one of my favorites. It is kind of pricey, depending where you're at. but if you haven't tried it and you're into pale ales pick it up you will not be disappointed."
"The aroma is mostly hop which is reflected in the flavor as well. Astringent and dry with a below average body. Highly carbonated. Good aftertaste of strong hop bitterness."
"d: This is one of those classic beers that cant be duplicated and will forever mesmerize drinkers because of its great nature and pleasing taste"
"D - Quite drinkable. The malt character is a bit weak, but it is more than made up for by the excellent hop character, especially in the aroma."
"This beer is so much fucking better out of the bottle. The fruity flavours come out where the CO_2 hinders it out of the tap."
"The mouth on this is one of hoppy goodness. The backend is a bit bitter but not overdone. I hear the fresh pale ale from the tap at the brewery is phenomenal."
"this will be my go-to beer for quite some time i imagine!"
"This beer was the one that opened the door to the craft brewing scene for me. Being an Irishman, I was raised on certain beers, and this opened my eyes, and I still go back to it every now and again. In the heat of summer, this is a staple in my fridge, and as much as I'll get crucified for suggesting it, an ex girlfriend of mine used to love it with a lemon wedge, and it adds a great extra level of refreshment."
"Drinkability: A classic pale ale, very drinkable. Nothing to complain about here."
"Overall - This is a solid pale ale, probably the most solid of the ""mainstream"" offerings you can get."
""
"This stuff is very drinkable, and I frequently pick this stuff up."
"Ok, I drink this beer more than i drink any other so yeah, i could be considered a fan, but whatever. This beer is a staple in my fridge. and to me... this is the perfect beer for solidarity in a pale ale. Pours a light amber. Smell is citrus and floral...with pine. Man, does this beer taste good! It's perfect for a pale ale. the taste is a sweet-but not too sweet malt, but then the hops have their say. awesome hop bitter..The lacing is awesome.. it's like drooping rings.ABV is 5.6% so it's easy to slam a 6 pack. pretty much perfect for a pale ale on drinkability. i mean this beer is perfect for a pale ale in my opinion and it's really easy to find! they did some serious work on this recipe. An extremely awesome solid beer. In my opinion, if you don't like this pale ale...then you just don't like pale ale."
"I like it with extra sharp cheddar cheese"
"Overall, if I had to choose 3 beers to drink for the rest of my life, this could very well be one of them."
"Flavor is dry and bitter. It's sporting some citrus, mild spice, and has decent medium malt body. Dominant hop-bitter rather than sweet. It's not a thick chewy beer but there is plenty of meat to separate it from imposters. There's a little grain on the finish. Aftertaste is grainy, dry and pleasant. I could drink these all day long."
"Pours a clear ambery orange with nice white frothy head. Smell is west coast hoppage with some spice. Taste is quite good with wonderful west coast hoppiness. I have some sorry ass IPAs (alaskan) with less hop flavor and bitterness than SNPA. Some good spice in the taste as well. Certainly a staple pale ale round these parts, and IMO one of the best in the country. This is always a go to, when you have to run in and run out of the store. Great beer."
"Had never had anything from Sierra Nevada before although I've seen it often. This great pale makes me want to definitely check out some of their other styles."
"Notes: this is my default beer if I find it on tap and the other choices are not satisfactory. It is very consistent and interesting."
"Moderate mouth feel and bready maltiness taste adding balance and enjoyment."
"In the glass, it is a very pretty, clear golden/copper color with a fluffy white head. Lots of lacing is left on the glass. The nose is very bright and floral with hops. Some citrus in there too with a bit of caramel underneath. The taste starts off with sweet caramel up with and them the grapefruity hop flavor and bitterness shows up and is fantastic! There are also some bready flavors in there and, while the beer warmed up, I think I tasted a bit of the alcohol underneath. There is a nice, medium mouthfeel with a medium/high carbonation. As for drinkability, I could drink this beer all day long. Never get between me and a SNPA. Do you hear me? NEVER!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Well carbonated but slick and smooth enough to really enjoy. The texture complements the bright hops and subtle malts, letting the flavors emerge fully. One of the most accessible, yet thoroughly satisfying beers with that beautiful West Coast hop kick."
"A great offering."
"This was one of the first craft brews I ever had. I remember thinking how strong it was at the time. Let's see how it treats me now. Pours a clear copper with an off white two-finger head that sticks around a bit. Smells of hops with a tinge of citrus and pine in the background. Doesn't taste as strong as I remember, which is not surprising. In fact, it's not strong at all, but very drinkable. The citrusy hops are mellowed out with the malts and a bit of biscuity goodness. There's a fruity essence apparent as well, and a subtle sweetness comes forth after a while. Very smooth with not much carbonation going on. Great balance of taste and drinkability. There's a reason this one is so popular."
"D: A great Pale and a great session beer. Nothing betther than having a case of this stuff while you are tending to the BBQ. You can easily drink quite a few."
"So easy to drink I could have this all day long. Love it. The original. I don't think I appreciate the hop character and bitterness as much as I used to when I was just a ""virgin"". But for some reason this is not as distinctive as it used to be, but still a very good brew. Like classic rock. You can do it over and over again and it is still great."
"Incredibly smooth, with low carbonation. Almost creamy. It's a fantastic drinking beer, and could easily become a great session beer here in Oz if the price was a bit cheaper."
"What else can one say but almost true perfection? Not too much carbonation, excellent aroma, color threw me off at first but love is blind. The citrusy notes finishes clean off the palate. Beer not quite the same in the bottle. I would strongly urge everyone to try this at least once, or twice, oh why stop there, comes in kegs too!"
"D: Excellent example of a Pale Ale."
"Poured a slightly darker Amber color. Had a perfect head and a good level of carbonation. The smell was great with a lot of hops and citrus. I was expecting a little more hops but I have been on quite an IPA binge recently so maybe I was affected by this. That said the general taste was pleasant and the beer was very drinkable."
"I really liked this Pale Ale, it poured a brownish-orange color with a medium-sized white head. Descent lacing down the glass. Its nose was full of esters, a flowery citrus scent with grassy undertones. Its taste was mild, which made for a very drinkable Pale Ale. Taste is much like its nose, primarily floral up front with some spicy and citrus flavors in back. Hops were definitely present, but not overpowering, very crisp and drinkable. I will definitely have this beer in my fridge on a regular basis."
"Pours a copper in color with a thick white head. Smells of hops and standard grains. A familiar flavor. The hops come to the forefront of this really balanced beer. Has a sweet finish. This was one of my first micros. Early 90's when I found Guinness. First introduction to hops. Definately gets a bump in review from nostalgia. A highly drinkable beer."
"D = This was my standby beer for at least a couple years running, but it's been a year or so since I've had it and I remember why I liked it. Just an excellent American Pale Ale. Definitely recommend it."
"Overall, an absolute staple in my fridge. Beer the way beer should be, easy and flavorful. Highly recommended."
"D: Not too shabby. I think with a bit less carbonation, the smoothness would temp me to quaff down a couple more of these things. I have really enjoyed the SN Pale Ale for a while now and have finally had the chance to rate it. Nice job. A great beer to try and clone as far as homebrewing goes."
"The color of this brew is a beautiful merger of gold and orange. The exuded scents are an aromatic bouquet of floral hops, lime, orange and pine needles. Carbonated and nimble on the palate, the presence of hops is noticeable throughout. A slight sweet and bready character provides a nice balance to the hops. The beer finishes with dry bitterness. This is a very drinkable, pleasing and enjoyable beer, one for any occasion."
"Nice fluffy white head is strong and laces very nicely. Pours golden. Yeasty odor but the hops are present. Very mild and no bitterness -- fruity. Very dry beer -- not a complicated taste at all, basic but boring. Goes easy and has a malty aftertaste. Recommended, would be great on a hot summer day when you want that pale ale taste without the extra hops of an IPA."
"Beautiful amber/red color and nice thick white head. Impressive retention and lacing. Appearance was my favorite characteristic. Drinkable; not a bad stand-by APA."
"MF/D - Clean and refreshing taste. Lots of bubbles and pleanty of dry flavor. A classic American Pale Ale. One of the best out there. If you haven't tried this classic, get out there and find one."
"This is a good beer if pale ale is your thing. It has a heck of a white foamy head on top of a knox blocks colored liquid. It smells heavily of hops. It's taste is of malt with a hint of grapefruit. The feel is a bit oily and a medium bodied beer. I'm not big on pale ales but this isn't bad and I would drink it again."
"This is the classic american pale ale, and I respect it and dig it. A pleasure to consume anytime."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium bodied in the mouth with appropriate levels of carbonation, just as it should be. This is a very drinkable beer, I could, and have, just sat around and drank this all day and night. This is a classic staple of this style of beer and I'll always be coming back to it."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"It may be my new ""lawnmower"" beer this summer!"
"D: This guy was very drinkable and I would love to get this guy again."
"D - Fantastic with a nice steak or pasta dinner, easily could be a daily favorite."
"This one is easily consumed and is nice and crisp. I drank it on it's own but will try again with Mexican food maybe."
"Highly recommended for the style..."
"Drinkability - The kind of beer you can drink one after the other."
"D - This may be the epitome of the APA...and is a great example for the style"
"I poured one 12 fl. Oz. bottle into my trusty tasting snifter and almost immediately smelled the aroma of hops. This is definitely a more aggressively hopped A.P.A. There was a short head, only about a quarter of an inch, which eventually subsided. The color was a beautiful amber gold. As mentioned before the nose was sharp with hops and also a yeasty malt aroma. The taste was bold for an American Pale Ale. You can tell that the good brewers at Sierra Nevada take their time crafting this offering. I'll have to remember to pick up a case of this next time I'm out at the beer distributor."
"I was very happy with this beer, its been around for a good while and ive enjoyed it for a long time, but not untill recently have i actually savored every aspect of beer. Ive just recently started ""tasting"" beer for what it really is, delicious. I'd rank Sierra Nevada as a very drinkable beer but not for the ""casual"" drinker. Anyone whom enjoys a nice hoppy flavor with a slight bite(bitterness) will enjoy this beer. It delivers a nice pour with a head that dissipates to generous lacing, Golden brown in apperance, with an aroma of floral, the taste is slightly bitter with a hint of pine, and finishes clean."
"Ordering a second of these to wash down a lousy fish sandwich for lunch today was not only necessary, but quite enjoyable. Far from the boldest pale ale, but solid and quite tasty."
"i think this beer is very drinkable. i think it is perfect for the style. i always try and keep a few of these around."
"D: Drinkability is pretty good. I tend to go a little slower on hoppy styles of beer, but this one had me reaching for another."
"This ale has good drinkability and could go well with seafood or other light tasting dishes."
"Aroma is moderate pine hops with light molasses malts. Pour yields a small frothy barely off-white head with fair lacing. The color is a golden honey. Taste is fruity at first followed by moderate bitterness. Not watery at all. Light to medium body, slightly over carbonated. Quite possibly the king of common beers."
"Overall, very solid."
"This is a very good flagship beer for Sierra Nevada and I should try more of their offerings. I look forward to trying the Celebration Ale."
"Overall - A crisp and hoppy pale ale. Good hop mix for aroma - complex and intriguing. It draws you into a sip. Alcohol is completely hidden. A well crafted ale."
"Drinkability is superb - this is a definite go to beer for me, and it's good that perhaps the most easily-available American Pale Ale is such a classic. A good introduction to the style, and a good dinner party beer. Cheers!"
"D:Very easy to drink. Overall it's a great beer that is very well balanced. Also hops isn't too strong so most of my friends will drink it."
"Poured into a pint glass, It poured an amber color with a white foamy head that left decent lacing on the glass. the smell was of hops and malt. the taste was the same,with a bitter after taste. overall this beer met my expectations. I look forward to drinking more of this beer."
"On Draft at UFC 73 in Sacramento. Lovely amberish color with just a little white head. Smell is a great fruity, fresh, hoppy scent. Taste is medium hoppy up front followed by a malty sweet aftertaste with a very nice finish. Great beer overall, with lots of flavor and a nice finish, and much better than I expected. I really liked this one."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Excellent and smooth in the mouth with no tart or sour aftertaste. I always try to have at least a sixer of these in the fridge at a time."
"Oveall, this is a great beer. One I consider the measuring stick for American Pale Ales. Highly flavorful and highly drinkable."
"One of those beers where after you have had two, you just have to finish the whole six pack. As many have already said, it's a benchmark for the APA style."
"This is a very drinkable beer if you are in the mood for an APA or IPA. People who do not like massive doses of hop goodness should beware, but you probably knew that already."
"pours a really nice light amber color, with a small head and has some average lacing. smell is good, hoppy with a nice malty undertoe. taste is good, has a stronger alcohol flavor than one would expect, the hop flavor is piney and citrusy, aftertaste is kinda malty good beer all around"
"I really like this beer. It's been my standard for several years now. My wife also loves it. It's one of the few bottled beers that really retain it's hop flavor and aroma. And if that's not enough, I can get it at my local Target for $11.99 / 12 pack. It's cheaper than most of the crap beers they sell. Go figure."
"i haven't had a Sierra Nevada brew in a while ; pours a hazy golden color w/ a decent head which dissipated a bit quick leaving a decent lacing in my pint glass ; a hoppy smell, mostly a piney citrus w/ some malt and slight fruitiness in the nose ; a nice, crisp hop flavor initially, with some bready malts in the mix, great malt/hop balance ; a light, semi-dry mouthfeel w/ a decent amount of co2, lets the flavor stay around just long enough ; an excellent beer, in fact, i think it was the ""original"" APA and set the style example, and at 5.6 ABV i could drink this all day long..."
"Drinkability: If you have too many of these, it sits like a rock in your digestive tract. However, it's dry profile lets it go well with many foods and it's always fun to enjoy one or two during a ballgame."
"Hopheads can mellow a bit with this sturdy, but never overbearing ale, while some may just relish the bitterness they rarely get with other shoddily crafted pales. Sierra Nevada and Dogfish Head really turned me on to hops, but you just don;t see DFH on-tap too many places around here. Thank goodness for Sierra Nevada!"
"Had on tap in a pint glass. Deep copper color with slight cloudiness and nice one finger head. Smells of slight hop presence, but soft. First sip is smooth. Decent hop presence, but balanced well with the malts. I would say a nicely balanced beer with nothing overdone. More kick than most pale ales, though. Good finish, a very drinkable beer."
"It had a good feel. Like some people say, good with food as it's pretty damn crisp. But it leaves me with too much of a fruit peel aftertaste to enjoy. Reminds me a lot of gin in that way. Finished a bit harsh too."
"D: More please. Cold, warm, out of the glassware or out of the bottle, I like this one a lot."
"D: Very drinkable and compliments a meal very nicely. Perhaps not completely sessionable, but it's tempting!"
"D - Definitely a winner. This is the beer that turned me on to micro brewing."
"Drinkability is quite good, it goes well with most foods and is one of my standard everyday beers. Might be a bit more bitter than batches I've had in the past, still very good and easy to drink."
"My favorite Pale Ale at this time. If I were only allowed one beer for all time I guess this would be it. For an everyday craft beer it is at the top of the pedestal of APAs."
"Drinkability> Once I conquered my fears of Cascade Hops, it became a standard, though I still prefer Stone's. Only just."
"This beer makes me feel nostalgic. It was one of the two or three brews that really got me hooked on ""better"" beer. I remember back then being impressed by the hoppiness of it, but now, after being exposed to a whole new world of beers, I am struck by the balance in the ingredients. It is a supremely drinkable classic of an American craft beer. If Sierra Nevada would only put some kind of freshness dating on their bottles, I would keep this one around much more often."
"Pours out with a golden brown hue, some head (not a hard pour) and pretty continuous bubbling. The aroma is dominated by pine and hops. It's somewhat floral, too, with a slight fruity sweetness. The taste starts bitter and ends bitter, with a little sweetness in between. After a while it makes me think of apples a little bit. It feels fresh and clean, with a mild lingering aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine; nothing offensive. In the end, this is a ""good"" pale ale, although every time I've had it I've never been as excited as some be are about it. I'm not yearning for more when I'm done."
"D - One of the most drinkable beers I have yet encountered that actually has a really great taste. With the ABV toward the lower end and the excellent representation of an American Pale Ale, this is one to grab for longer sessions."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. It was a bronze color with a ton of yeast floaters. Decent carb, no lacing. It had a small beige head that settled into a partial film. The aroma was floral and hoppy with a grassy malt smell as well. Something in there didn't sit right though. It also appeared in the taste. It was a weird bitter aftertaste that I usually don't find in PA/IPA's. I love a good bitter PA/IPA bite but that weird aftertaste really hurt this one. I got as a single so possible that it's a bad sample so will try again. But for now I can't really recommend (One and done)"
"D - One of the great pale ale's a true American craft ale."
"A classic APA. A brilliant golden/amber hue flows from the bottle to create a snappy finger's width head that fizzles out a bit quick. Not much lacing or stickage either. Wafts of clean malt hang out behind a citrusy and slightly piny hop aroma. Clean hop bitterness with a slight sweetness are followed up by a dry finish. A well balanced session beer that is quite drinkable. The mouthfeel has a little too much CO2 and pops without much of a creamy or lucious texture."
"I'd been worried for sometime that Sierra Nevada was becoming to mainstream, but it appears that even though more mass markets are carrying their beer, they are still able to produce a quality product."
"I liked this one, of course beer always tastes better when you finish skiing, I did have this beer with rocklette when I was in Utah, it happens to be my 3rd favorite beer behind the Heffe and the Bass that I drank. But I always have enjoyed SN beers in the past so I could not go wrong."
"D: Not much new to say about this one. An American brew classic and probably the most popular micro in the country. Also a good option for a beer on draft since it's widely available on tap."
"Drinkability - This is a beer you can drink the hell out of. It tastes pretty good, it is available pretty much everywhere, which is great because I will reach for this over any BMC, any day. It is an easy drinking brew. It is also one of the quintessential ""training wheel beers"" for most people that I know."
"D-Good, I could have several at which point I wold have to switch to something with more hops"
"Poured orange amber with a half inch head. Decent lacing and plenty of visible carbonation. Aroma was hoppy but not overly so, just right for a pale ale. Nice balance between malt and hops with a clean dry finish. Good mouthfeel, carbonation was bright and sparkling. Very drinkable, a good pairing with bar food."
"Overall I think this beer company gets way too much attention for something that doesn't taste very good by beer standards."
"Another great, classic brew from a company that I've really taken a liking too... A copper colored beer poured with an impressive head that receded after a bit... smell is very dry and biscuity... The taste is solid.. a good example of the style, with caramel and bready overtones... mouthfeel is equally good and with an easy drinkability, this is a classic American brew... their Celebration Ale was great, and this somewhat reminds me of it, with a lower alcohol percentage... a good, clean, crisp taste... Definitely recommended..."
"A little high in the ABV department, but I have no trouble drinking 6 of these."
"D: Very high. Definitely one to always have in the fridge alongside the others."
"The first thing you get when opening a bottle of SN pale ale is a huge dose of cirtusy hoppy goodness. This is probably one of my favorite session beers. Has a nice pale amber color with a small whiteish head. Again, the smell is dominated by citrus. Taste is very refreshing and crisp with a strong hop dominance, but a nice malt backbone. Moth feel is slightly watery. Very drinkable. All in all, it is a great beer that you can find almost anywhere in my experience."
"Drinkability- A nice dinner or stay home and chill beer."
"D- Sessionable as anything"
"Really not anything somebody can say bad about Sierra Nevada pale... I really don't buy it much anymore unless I am at a gas station and this is the only micro they have.... but writing a review makes me think about just how quintessential this brew is.... a classic if there ever was one."
"Drinkability: Overall, a solid pale ale that's readily available and generally easy on the wallet."
"Drinkability: Classic American ale. Great session choice. Very refreshing and goes with everything."
" I would recommend this beer and seeing that it is one of my fave's, I drink this beer all the time. So bottoms up!"
"D: This is one of my standards because, as I mentioned, it's so easy to get just about anywhere. A great summer beer because it's light and not too dry. Certainly not my favorite beer, but it sure beats the usual restaurant selection."
"D - This one is more hoppy than other pale ales but if you like hops this is a good beer or if your moving into IPAs."
"Nice clear pale golden brew with a big head as a result of an aggressive pour. Thin head remains on top and lots of sticky lacing clings to the glass. Wonderful smell of spicy hops and malt. Starts out strong and bitter from the hops and then smooths out with some maltiness and finishes very dry and hoppy. What a wonderful brew. Hard to say american pale ale and not think of this beer."
"nice crisp hoppy smell. taste nice and bitter but with a woody hint . very drinkable and very bubbly the whole time. head retention is not the best, legs stream long for awhile though. taste very smooth, bitter, and woody eceptional beer, would be able to drink all day long and have"
"I could drink this beer all day. Poured from a bottle, it's orange with a finger-width, creamy white head that leaves lots of lacing as you drink. Scent is surprisingly not as hoppy as I would have thought. Lots of fruit and a woody/grassy aroma I couldn't place. Palate is crisp, clean and very dry. Not as hoppy as a lot of Pales and IPAs. You get a slight hop burn on the tongue, but it's balanced enough to let the grapefruit and spices come through. This is a laid back Pale - smooth, mild and highly drinkable."
"Different and good. Light and dry version of a pale ale."
"D- I think one of the most drinkable, readily available beers on the market as of right now."
"The mouthfeel is medium as is the carbonation and it finishes dry and has a nice bitter aftertaste that lingers on for some time. *Still* one of my favourites of the style and one I frequent often. It is that good."
"A good beer from a company that I look forward to trying more of."
"D- I could easily drink two or there before starting to feel full although this is a very filling beer."
"D - Excellent session beer. That has a perfect balance beer after beer. This beer is positioned between a lighter hopped pale ale and a hoppier IPA in my opinion. I typically shy away from Pale Ales as many are bland and not hoppy enough. This is an exception for sure."
"D-very drinkable at all times really but especially when out a eatery,bar,ect. and nothing else is avalible,a great stand-by!"
"A classic. Good drinkability with a shot of bitterness."
"I recommend this beer"
"I'm not a hop head by any means whatsoever, but I found this drink really enjoyable and look forward to my next encounter. Hopefully, on a warm day just after I've mowed the lawn."
"nice light amber color with a thick golden white head that doesn't dissolve too quickly; very smooth; a good IPA rone that has the bitter taste that usually is associated with the IPA without leaving a bad aftertaste in the mouth; actually a little bit of a tart taste too which i almost want to say is a hint of lemon or at least taste's like it; actually has a lot of citrusy undertones in general; a pretty good beer that i would definitely recommend especially if you enjoy IPAs"
"The quintessential American Pale Ale, with all the great characteristics that have made this craft beer a staple of good beers for as lons as it has been around."
"This is one excellent pale ale. A very nice amber pour with an amber colored head. The head has a nice thickness that goes down slowly and sticks to the sides of the glass nice a nice American Pale Ale. The aroma is really nice with a good mesh of hops and malt that prove to make a nice smelling beer. The taste is exceptional! Nice amount of hops that give it a bitter but light flavor. The malt is blended exceptionally with the hops and a nice fruity undetone finishes nice and clean. The aftertaste is beautiful and the carbonation blends the whole beer very well. Very drinkable if you like Pale Ales. Try this beer. Very good."
"Overall, this beer is the reason why I am now an aspiring beer geek. It made me cross-over from the mass-produced garbage I used to drink so much in college. Now, as I try a multitude of other great craft brews, this beer is still there. I compare it to the original 3 episodes of Star Wars. I can experience it over and over again and never be let down. In the end, it will always bring me happiness."
"all i can say is wow! i've been drinkin many different beers for the past few years, i havn't settled on one yet, but then i come across this masterpiece. starting with the first popping of the cap the smell overwhelmes my senses, then i pour slowly into a pint glass, the color is an off-balanced orange and the carbonation going straight to the top, i'm watching as i'm typing and the head still seems to be growing. one sip, two sip. it's a wonderful brew. my top 3 for sure. one i'll be running to for years to come. excellent!"
"Good taste, color, smell and I could and have drank these all day long."
"I liked this beer when I first started exploring more exotic beers, and I'm never disappointed when I return to it. The price, availability, and complexity (almost perfumy) aspects are a win-win combination and help to explain why it has steadily been growing in marketshare. It is the quintissential citrucy APA that all must be compared to. My overall favorite every day beer, although Dale's is starting to give it some competition."
"Overall this beer dissapoints in most categorys although if I had to I could make this a session beer."
"Finally reviewing after several tastings, both in bottle and on tap. Pours a nice golden amber with thick, almost rocky head. Nice smell of hops and a hint of pine. Taste is good, not great though. A good balance of malt and hops leaning towards the hop side. Moderate carbonation leaves a crisp and light feeling in the mouth with a dry and bitter aftertaste. Easily drinkable and has a good flavor do to the hop presence. Overall this is a very good beer, not an amazing one. Due to its availability definitely worth drinking over most other beers commonly found on tap."
"Very easy to drink. Not too thin, but has lots of flavor. When a place has very few taps, this is usually the best they have to offer."
"Out of your everyday beers of high quality, this is the one that I would buy most often."
"D - A very drinkable beer, great west coast pale example. Well worth each sip. This went great w/ my roast duckling entree."
"This is my go to brew. Being from AL where the beer selection is ass, I can usually muster up a six pack of good ole Sierra Nevada Pale Ale almost everywhere. I love everything about this beer. From its amber pour, hoppy aroma and taste, to its crip finish this beer never disappoints. I am reviewing it from a 12oz. bottle serving but I will say that it is even more glorious on draft."
"D - Although it doesn't pack nearly as much punch as I had expected, it is still very tasty. I may not go out of my way to get another, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down if offered."
"Had on tap at a local Texas Roadhouse. Nice 1/2 inch head which stayed most of the glass. Couldn't tell much from the aroma since I just fired down half a rack o' ribs. Golden dark color also looked nice. Definite hops bitterness but not as strong as some. All in all, a nice alternative to the typical BMC offering."
"D - A very drinkable beer, great west coast pale example. Well worth each sip. This went great w/ my roast duckling entree."
"Mouthfeel is very good, carbonation hits just right, and among pale ales its extremely drinkable. This is one of the beers that got me into craft ales, and its still a terrific standby. One of America's classics."
"I can remember buying a case of this stuff a year and some change ago and being very overwhelmed by the bitterness.Now it is a shadow of its self in my eyes.See what time does?This is a beer that I would drink if there wasnt any other type of craft beer there.Not because it sucks but just because its not moving me anymore.There are plenty of hoppier beers out there that overpower this.I dont know how to say that without dogging the beer."
"Looks decent enough. Smells like rind. The malt, instead of light and crisp, tastes bready and doesn't serve to balance the hops. The beer is way overhopped, tasting of acrid pine needles. The bitterness is obnoxious and the beer isn't refreshing or balanced. HORRIBLY overrated, just like everything else from Sierra Nevada."
"The aroma is floral fresh and is very inviting with a touch of hops. The first sip is a little bitter for an APA, but it finished crisp and very smooth almost creamy. The mouth feel is very light with medium carbination and the finish goes down very easily. I could get in trouble with this easy drinking pale ale. Great representation of the style and just a good beer."
"Pours a (not surprisingly) pale yellowish amber with a nice head. Floral and pine scent, which blends into ... floral, hop, and pine taste overtones. This is one of the benchmark pale ales, and it stands up well on a price per taste ratio. Certainly not my favorite beer, but does have a nice blend of party affordability and taste."
"The prototypical pale ale that everyone should have in their fridge."
"Is it beer thirty yet?"
"D - Gone already. Need I say more?"
"Good beer for the summer time at packs more a punch than a lot of the widely distributed microbrews"
"Second tasting, and I although many of the other characteristics are still relevant here, the taste was much different. I'm not sure if it was the batch or what, but this brew was much more flavorful than my first tasting. The most notable difference is the powerful grapefruit and citrus taste. My original review stated that I could not taste the hints of those flavors, but perhaps it was too cold the first time around. To add to my initial review, amazing flavor of grapefruits and citrus and a bit wild for an American Pale Ale, but very delicious nonetheless."
"Pours a beautifully clear, deep amber with a two finger, tightly packed head. Lacing is always left all over the glass. Aroma is piney and hoppy, with the cascade hops overpowering the aroma with its citrusey notes. Taste is very hoppy, but balanced well with toasted malts. Hints of caramel and toffe are noted, but mostly an herbal hoppy presence and a strong orange/grapefruit flavor. Exceptionally mouth filling, but easy drinking. Despite the slightly higher than average ABV, it is remarkably easy drinking. Perhaps the most well-crafted pale ale made in the USA. I strongly recommend this beer to everyone."
"Overall- I consider this a good representation of the style. With the availability as it is, it isn't something I need to seek out, but it's a good ""go-to"" beer especially when options may run thin."
"D- uh yeah, i could drink this all the time and it's definitely my go to beer when i'm lookin for a bullseye, right up there with old speckled hen and sam adams boston lager."
"Nice drink after a dinner, not a really beer for a lot, i would soon for this one."
"Have really come to enjoy this style of beer in recent months. One of the best I have access to."
"D) Pretty good overall. I had this in a blind tasting with Liberty Ale and Hopalicious (Ale Asylum), it came in third. Not bad, but not life altering."
"crisp and light, goes down pretty smooth."
"Pale copper to dark gold in color. Appearance of the head shows a well crafted brew as it's fluffy and creamy. Looks classic. Many bubbles of different sizes. Carbonation streams from the bottom of the glass in an absolutely clear liquid. Aromas of sweet malted barley and citrusy fresh dry-hopping. Label states bottle conditioning and it shows with perfect ale cabonation that's smooth and tingly on the tongue. Tastes of citrusy cascade floral hops with a sweetish caramel malt background. Malt becomes more aromatic and an apricot fruitiness comes through as beer warms. Here is the template for many an APA. Still tastes great after all these years. If it's not broke.... Goes great with spicey foods, BBQ, burgers, pizza, indian and seafood dishes also pair well. One of many fine Sierra Nevada beers and a brewery that's a source of pride for American brewing."
"D: An excellent APA that I will definitely buy again."
"Highly drinkable and could easily be a session beer even at the 5.6 % ABV."
"The taste starts of with some citrus, malt, and has a great dry bitter finish. I would have this in my fridge often if only it were more readily available to me."
"If you're not a fan of strong hops, avoid this beer. I do agree with the comment about this being Budweiser with hops. If you want a great microbrew pale ale without huge amounts of hops, I recommend Dogfish Head amber ale or Fat Tire."
"I have always enjoyed this beer and always will."
"Pours a golden orange, with a great, white head. Smells of citrus hops. Taste is very well balanced, sweet malt, with a good use of bittering and aroma hops. One of the best interpretations of the American Pale Ale out there. The version on tap isn't quite as good, likely due to this version being bottle conditioned."
"Light amber in color, with little head and mild tracing. This a delectable brew for sure. Has a solid, but not overpowering, hop smell. Starts bitter, but the bitterness doesn't linger, it becomes sweet and finishes smooth. This is an extremely drinkable beer, especially good on a warm summer day."
"For every great beer in America there are 1000 poor excuses for beer. SN Pale Ale is the perfect beer at the perfect price available everywhere. We all look at the lists of great beers and hope we can run across a few when we're lucky. SN Pale Ale is easy to find, easy to share and easy to enjoy. Kudos to Sierra Nevada for providing us with this America Classic."
"I don't think I've ever sessioned this beer, but it is quite drinkable. The carbonation sneaks up and I tend to feel full after a couple."
"A very nice choice in the style. Great beer to go with a sandwich. A solid choice to always keep on hand. If you like your taste buds, treat them to one of these."
"Overall, a very good,easily found brew. I've tried to be kind because I'm just not used to drinking ""hoppy"" beer but am trying to expand my horizons. I can see where the hopheads would like this one!"
"Mouthfeel is fine and drinkability is quite high due to the nearly perfect balance. What can I say? Simply a classic and my first beer experience period and one that has converted countless. Not my favorite pale, but it will always have a soft spot with me because of the memories."
"D: Very drinkable. This was the first pale ale I ever really started drinking frequently, which led to my love of the IPA and DIPA style. Highly recommended."
"D: I could drink this all day."
"On all subsequent tastings, I don't think SNPA is as good as LCPA. It is the benchmark beer of its style and very drinkable with pleasant bitterness and a dry finish. However, it lacks the fresh hoppy character of the best beers American Pale Ales."
"Drank this from a 12 oz. bottle with no bottling date. On a hard pour it has a nice white head. Clear golden-yellow color. Great retention. Soft aromas and tastes of lightly toasted malt and honey. Finishes cleanly with a brush of the hops. Tastes travel well. Light-bodied mouthfeel. Continuous carbonation adds to the head, although it doesn't bite the tongue. Not the most powerful flavors, but a well-balanced session beer. Great example of a Pale Ale!"
"Drinkability: decent beer, best I could find at Game Day... nothing special. I'm sure that I'll have more... wouldn't turn one down...."
"Pours a nice copper color with generous fluffy white head that hangs around for a while. Aroma is dominated by the cascade hoppiness. Flavor is citrusy, but is ultimately nicely balanced between the hops and malt. This is a very fine beer that has become available everywhere. Drinkability is very high."
"Was pleasantly surprised to see this on-tap at Union Hall in Brooklyn. The appearance is a dark amber with a foamy, off-white head. Fair amount of lacing on the glass. Not really much to the smell besides the hint of hops; the taste was slighly malty and a bit bitter. Pale ales are not my favorite, but this one was enjoyable. Not sure if I'd want to drink more than one or two of these at one time, but it is an enjoyable brew if you are a fan of the bitter ones."
"overall this is the best pale ale ive had, very hoppy and very good, i enjoyed every drop of it"
"I was really looking forward to this beer after seeing the ratings and that it was readily available at a good price in my area. I am sorry to say I was disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high. It was a good beer. Crisp and clean but there was nothing special about it. I smelled some hops but not what I would have expected, and I tasted hops but nothing like I would expect from something with the words pale and ale in the name. I would but it again only for a social gathering. The Budweiser crowd would not be put off but the beer drinkers would find something drinkable in the refrigerator."
"Drinkability- A very drinkable beer, not only delicious in every way but balanced, non-filling, and crisp. A delightful brew to enjoy."
"D: Very tasty & not harsh in any way, so it disappears very quickly. Too often this is the only really good beer in OKC sports bars - so it's gotten me quite a few PSU losses. Of course it's even better in celebration. Always a good choice, even when the bar has a decent selection."
"D: A very nice beer and something you could start someone down the path to good beer with. Not all that expensive either. Me however, I would rather be drinking Great Lakes burning river if I'm looking for a well priced pale ale."
"A fairly thin looking golden brew with a thin head and a solid white lace. A yeasty lemon aroma with evidence of hops. My first taste reveals an aqueous grapefruit and hops combination. Somewhat tangy but smooth and a little creamy. Mildly complex and a very nice choice despite its relative accessibility. Always enjoyable."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale pours a clear light gold with a thick sticky head. Aroma is mostly citrusy hops with some pale malt in the background. Flavor is certainly focused on hops, but remains fairly balanced. More citrusy grapefruit flavor with a rounded bitterness that complements the slightly sweet maltiness. I've had less hoppy IPA's but style is much less important than deliciousness."
"D- I find it very drinkable, but if you're not a fan of those NW cascade hops you'll hate it, so I'll have to give it a slightly marginal rating, but as I said, I love it."
"This is a great summer and fall beer and cheap enough to have on a regular basis if you're on a budget. I've also heard it mentioned that this beer brought the pale ale style to America and shows off the Cascade hop variety beautifully."
"Drinkability- Definately my session beer at the bar. with 5.6 alcohol cont, it's rather high for a beer you can easily find in a grocery store. For a college party, get something cheaper, at 7-9 dollars around here it can be pricey for those of us in a pinch, but when i want something good and can't get my ass to the bev cent. This is my choice. Can't go wrong with Sierra Nevada!"
"Pours hazy copper with a large, foamy off-white head that dies down quickly to a thin but solid, chunky layer. Light lacing. Aroma is pale malts  dough, cookie, biscuit  and spicy, piney hops. A touch of honey and lemon. Mouthfeel is fizzy / tangy with a light to medium body. Flavor is a nice balance of buttery malts and spicy resin hops with a distant grapefruit bitterness; rich, nutty malts in the finish. Bittersweet, leafy aftertaste."
"This is a great beer...it is good on draft or in the bottle. It is better cold. It loses some of its kick when it gets warmer. I can really taste the hoppy flavor come through in the draft. It has a citrus flavor that blends to a barky/nutty taste. Try it on draft!"
"The wholesome, balanced taste is well complimented by the smooth, medium body. Again, balance comes to mind. It's a pleasure to drink, I'm wishing I had another. Very refreshing, very versatile. I could see this beer pairing well with a lot of different kinds of foods."
"Pretty much the quintessential American pale ale. There's hardly any denying that. There may be better examples out there, but no beer that I've had so far embodies the characteristics of a classic APA like this one. Always a great fallback beer to boot, as many places with so-so beer selections will have this. If you haven't tried it yet, you obviously need to do so."
"Drinkability: A solid ale, could have this again."
"This is one of the few beers where the bottle is much better than the tap. The layer of brewer's yeast from the bottle really adds to the appearance. The aroma between draft and bottle are about the same, but the taste and mouthfeel from the bottle version tops the draft. The hop-flavor comes through much better in the bottle."
"It's hard not to praisethis beer. I have enjoyed it for years yet have never written a review. When I need a break from IPAs, Imperial and double IPAs there is nothing like a Sierra Nevada. It's one of the original micro's and incredibly convenient since its sold almost everywhere. A session beer she be."
"D-As a beer lover this is one you are always happy with. The brewery may have gotten bigger but it has done the trick for me for years. Plus you get many non beer lovers to go over the line with this."
"In the past this beer has been one of my favorites. Very good looking beer. Great for the summer although a little strong for any kind of a session beer. Orange rhine comes to mind in the aroma and taste as well. But floral and earthy scents are predominate. Bitter in the finish but not overpowering. Bready, buiscuty malts show up first on the palate then the hop flavor and bitterness, later. Great drinking beer anytime of the year. Mild enough but too many will knock you on your ass, so be careful. Just a great beer."
"Pours a golden/copper color, thick head that reduces to lace.Smell is light to me, some piney hops and grass is all I detect. I taste citrus first, followed by malt sweetness then piney hops and a bit of bitterness in the finish. Nice oil to the mouthfeel. Nice and highly drinkable. A classic from a great brewery."
"D: Very good, low in alcohol, excellent taste makes for a great drinkability. The beer that introduced me to American hops, it is inexpensive and available almost anywhere, so I often pick it up and know I will have an enjoyable experience."
"I cant help thinking it was better when I had it on tap in the united states. But it is still a good beer from the bottle - if a little too strong for a session beer."
"Nice clear golden color just a hint of haze. Nice hints of citrus, maybe lemon. Somewhat light taste. Hoppiness is subtle, not alot of carbonation, just like I like it. It's a really good pale ale. I thought it was pretty smooth. Not much of a aftertaste."
"It may just be the familiar nature of the beer but it seems better than the scores I've given its components would suggest."
"Appearance has a light orange brown with a thin head that dissapates quickly. Aroma is a light hop and malt. Taste is biscuty with light citrus tones with a good hop bite that leaves a lingering bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light - medium, a well done beer, but I also wouldn't consider it a session."
"Overall, this is a solid and well-rounded beer. It smells and tastes as expected, but not more than expected (which is why I rated it straight 4s). Since it meets all my expectations I feel that it is probably one of the more established APAs available, as it is not trying to be anything it shouldn't be. Great beer."
"Notes: This beer is a staple of craft brewing, probably the single most common craft beer you'll find on the west coast. It's a solid pale ale, nothing incredible and a bit overrated in my opinioin, but nonetheless a good representation of the style and a decent gateway into craft beer."
"Sierra Nevada Pale ale was a nice orange-amber color with good clarity. It had a white head with good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was cirtus hops and some light malt. The taste was more hops than malt with a little bitterness and hoppy dry finish. It was medium-light in body with good carbonation. Drinkabilty was very good. It's a good tasting, easy to find APA that I keep coming back to."
"poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, it poured a nice amber color with a decent off white head. has a strong floral hoppy smell to it, it smells how i expect an apa so smell. the taste starts off with a piney taste and ends slightly bitter. mouthfeel is light compared to other pale ales that ive tried. this is a very drinkable beer, i could drink this all day long if i was back home in cali, but its pretty expensive out here in Guam."
"D: I held this beer up against Alpha King because I wanted to know the differences, and boy are they evident. That being said this is still a very solid beer and one that I will always come back to."
"Poured a sparkling clear orange color with a white head that faded a bit too quickly. Not much hops in the nose but smells of apricot, peach, and cereal which matches the sweet, malty taste. Oooo, an assertive hoppy bitterness in the finish that lingers and prickles the tongue. This is an awesome American Pale Ale that paved the way for the rest. Thanks, Sierra Nevada, for showing us the light."
"D - This is a very good APA. It almost has the hop power of an IPA. Great malt flavor, too."
"Thank goodness that Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is so readily available in bottles and on tap! It is often the only beer that interests me in places where most patrons want the 'usual suspects' (i.e. Bud, Bud Light, Miller Lite, etc etc). Thanks to Sierra Nevada for making an excellent and accessible beer!"
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. This pale ale poured a clear golden/orange color with a 1/2 inch thick foamy beige head that slowy fades away, leaving some good lace behind. The aroma is full of orange and citrus hops, along with some light caramel notes. The flavor is a very crisp gragefruit and orange that bites your tounge on impact. The bitterness is very quick and agreeable. Excellent balance between the bitterness and flavor. The body is light to medium with a light dose of carbonation. This is a very well done pale ale that is widely available in most restaurants and bars. If the beer list is limited, you cant go wrong choosing this one."
"D: A session beer all the way. Nothing over the top crazy and that is what makes it good. Worth a try."
"This is a great every-day beer. Always worth the price to grab a half rack of Sierra Nevada for the weekend. Consistant and clean, nice and hoppy with good flavor balence and highly drinkable. Can't go wrong with this beer for a sessions beer. As close to a marco/micro beer as you'd wanna go."
"Bottle-poured one-finger head on a copper orange, opaque body...soft hoppy sensations...the mouthfeel is comfortable, the ale ""bite"" welcoming and crisp. In a controlled environment, this beer's taste explains the ""American classic"" reverence I have heard other beer drinkers offer. Although I don't like piling ales on top of each other in one sitting, a six of this beer will do for a spring evening gathering..."
" Bottom line is that it's overall a very acceptable ale, I reccomend this to anyone just to try, it's worth it"
"very drinkable."
"The Sierra Nevada beers are extremely good. I like this one as far as ales go but I prefer lagers/porter. Typical of Sierra Nevada is good lacing nice standing head and a damn good beer. Sierra Nevada is right up there with Sam Adams. Definately shouldn't be overlooked in a sea of beers at a huge liqour store."
"This is a pale ale done just right."
"This is a beer ive had a bunch of times but never reviewed, but i w had it last night and wanted to put it up. I love it because its so readily available relatively cheap, and comes from what isnt really a micro brew beer but stands up really well. It has a great hop burst of flavor with some grapefruit in it, a solid body of malt, and a great smoothness that does a great job of showing a great smooth hoppy beer"
"What can I say that hasn't already been said? While not one of the best beers I've ever had, it is nonetheless one of my favorites. Why? Very good taste, especially considering its wide availability and (relatively) low price. For what it is, and especially coming from what is essentially a macro-brewer, its damn good. It has a permanent space in my fridge."
"Well, this was the first beer I ever tried, and seeing as how I graduated college on friday (5/25/07) and I celebated with a few of these, I might as well review it here. This is without a doubt the best Macro produced beer available. And it is macro-produced. Cheers to SN for making such a quality product so available and drinkable for the masses. SNPA is like a delicious Budweiser. It is available everywhere, just about everyone can enjoy this, and even beer geeks like us have nothing but good things to say. I can sit and sip, or drink to get drunk, and sierra Nevada Pale Ale will always be in my fridge. Good stuff"
"Smooth pale ale, that can be enjoyed over the evening in several bottles."
"D: A very drinkable beer, could be consumed multiple times throughout the night."
"In the end I consider this one to be a totally refreshing, totally sessionable, and totally American brew."
"12oz bottle of a classic beer which I poured into a standard pint glass. The color is a light orange yellow and clear. The head is a frothy white cloud. The smell is hoppy and I also detect a perfume quality. The taste is crisp and also has elements of perfume. Very balanced and the drink ability is awesome. I could easily put down a sixer."
"I can drink this beer all day. Sometimes, I do drink this beer all day. Session. Session. Session."
"A nice pale. Very well hopped. May have to start keeping this in the fridge!"
"D - good beer, but not great for session and not interesting enough for repeat tasting. Really good for"
"D: Very drinkable, understandable why this has the reputation it does and is a staple in so many beer fridges. I really enjoyed rediscovering it and will make it a point to drink more often. Recommended as a solid, flavorful & sessionable 'everyday' beer. Thanks, Elizabeth, for picking it up..."
"I still remember the first time I encountered this beer (many, many years ago in California). I knew right then that my days of drinking miller, coors and AB products were over forever. For that I will always be grateful. Just an excellent beer. Cheers!"
"This beer pours a light amber color. There's a faint aroma of hops and not much else. The beer tastes kind of hoppy at first but then fades into a sweet malty backbone. From what I gather about pale ales, they should never be too hoppy or too malty.This one is well balanced but I would think that it would taste better straight from a tap."
"Drinkability - Drinkable. Would not turn down if offered for free. I needed food to fight off the bitterness. Not too happy with this one."
"the now widely available classic and one of my first pale ales. this helped start me on my road to better beers. i managed to talk the manager of my local dive bar into getting this on tap so now i have something to drink when i'm at that shithole playing golden tee. pours a light amber with a small creamy head. light caramel malts and citric, floral hops in the nose. all of which are subtle aromas to me now, but they were huge some time ago. light caramel malt sweetness at the start well balanced out by a decent hop bitterness. slightly sour and crisp finish. light/medium in body and very sesionable. i'm glad this is now widely available but selling to the evil empire of retailers (walmart) scares me for some reason."
"D- This is really drinkable and I'm glad I had it. I will have it again."
"SNPA is a true American classic. This brew is crisp, refreshing, and damn tasty. I don't really buy this beer much and every time I do I wonder why."
"A nice offering when on tap."
"For a night of drinking I'd take Blue Moon. The aftertaste is less pronounced."
"nice example of the apa style. the hops are a little out front. very drinkale beer. actually have had many sessions with this beer. have not had this in awhile. wonderful beer!"
"Very easy to drink and not heavy at all. Great session brew. Not sure why I always looked over this one when I saw it on-tap, but that won't happen as often now."
"Poured a beautiful clear rich golden color with a 1/4 inch off white head and frothy lacing down the glass as you drink. It has a real nice scent of grapefruit and floral hops. Tastes good. You get a real nice citrus flavor with barley malt and a floral hop finish. This beer is really light, smooth and very refreshing. This is a great beer for those beginning their hop journey. I think it would be great on a nice summer day."
"Drinkability - I have to say this brew just impresses me the more and more Pale Ales I drink. I find the catagory to not be overly impressive but this one of the originals still stands out as one of the elite and makes for an excellent brew with a spicey meal."
"I especially like the aftertaste, and the bitterness gives it a nice kick. The grapefruit flavor I can deal with, but it's a bit strong. I'm fine with just one."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and very easy to drink. The 5.6% abv really propels this to a session beer. Overall, this is one of my favorite all-around beers. Especially for a session. I expect that most here have tried this. If you haven't, you must."
"D- A good everyday beer, a perfect example of the American Pale Ale style."
"Very solid APA. Definitely a paragon of the style. Recommended, it goes well with many dishes and is welcome for many different events."
"Final Statement: Wow, this is different from the pale ales i've tried, and certainly one of the best. Very impressed with this West Coast Pale Ale. Highly recommend."
"What's to say that hasn't been said? It's a west-coast classic with it's own unique beat. Typical of American styles, it leans towards the hoppy profile, with a grapefruit/citrus aroma. From draft, it has a creamy feel that's good to the last drop. I'm glad to hear from casual beer drinkers that this is on thier list for thier favorite beers, so it has appeal for everyone."
"A decent APA if you like the grapefruit thing."
"12oz bottle of a classic beer which I poured into a standard pint glass. The color is a light orange yellow and clear. The head is a frothy white cloud. The smell is hoppy and I also detect a perfume quality. The taste is crisp and also has elements of perfume. Very balanced and the drinkability is awesome. I could easily put down a sixer."
"Pours a copper color into pint glass with off white head which dissipates quickly. Aroma is floral hops and malts. Taste is an intricate blend of citrus and floral hops with some carmel malts and a biscuit taste. Mouthfeel is smooth. Every sip begs for another. Excellent beer to drink a few of."
"I believe this is the standard to judge all APAs against. It is a very good, but not spectacular, APA that is readily available. Goes well with pizza or barbeque and doesn't taste as strong as it is (5.6%). I would love to see more of the Sierra Nevada products available in bottles."
"Not too sure what I was expecting from this beer, something smoother perhaps, certainly not the young, dry, tinny flavours which I found. I will try another in the summer maybe, to see if the warmer weather helps me see it's characteristics in a better light."
"M: good carbonation; refreshing. Not too thin, but probably less than medium."
"Yes this really is a classic pale ale and worthy of its reputation."
"this is a great beer, its very smooth, and goes down smooth. there is a definate taste of hops with a finish of hop/bitterness. However the bitter finish is by no means overpowering. There is a semi complex flavor profile, but still simple enough for someone new to pale ales. A great first pale ale, but one that you will come back to. Great pale ale and great beer. Must try."
"Overall: This beer is one that I often overlook. It is not anything special, but I think I should give it the attention it deserves in the future. It is a good beer for the style."
"Pours a clear copper with a nice, sticky, foam head. Aroma is sweet citrus, with a little grapefruit, and something that comes across as bready. The taste is a little different than I would expect from the aroma - light, biscuity malt with hints of the citrus hops followed by a pleasant, but neutral flavored bittering. It has a clean finish and very good drinkability - I have sessioned this brew quite a few times. This is a great example of an APA and is always reliable and tasty."
"Not hard to see why this one is a classic."
"This is a very good pale ale. Lots of character in this one."
"I have not had this on tap in a long time. Very good brew that is without a doubt a classic pale ale. Pretty much all hops, awesome hop bitterness that finishes off the complex citrusy hop flavors. Be sure to try this one on a clean palatte to give it full justice."
"A very pleasant beer. Color is an absolutely gorgeous golden amber that promises an excellent brew. Aroma is hoppy and pleasant. Flavor is hoppy with some bitterness, not much on complexity but nice. Smooth and tingly, it works by itself or as an accompaniment to a meal. Recommended."
"Overall, this is the beer that really introduced the Pale Ale to America, and there's no wonder why it is held in such high regards. SNPA is an ale everyone should experience; both as a great brew, and as a vanguard of the American micro-brew revolution."
"Overall, this is my favorite American Pale Ale, mostly for its balance. I do enjoy IPA's from time to time too (especially Bridgeport and other Pacific NW beers) but for APA's, this beer is something else."
"Taste has some hops, wheaty bread notes, and a bit of sour mash and metal. Not amazingly good by any means, but a cut above most grocery store beers. Feels a bit too dry, but leaves a good bubbly bite along with a decent, lingering aftertaste of hops. It drinks well enough, but doesn't have enough hops or depth for me."
"This beer is simply one of the best in its class. It is a delicious American pale ale. It is highly drinkable and tastes very good. The hop taste really stands out in this beer. One could drink this beer all night with no regrets. Another thing that is good about this beer is the price. It is very affordable for its style. Cheers!"
"Always an enjoyable beer for me and I always reach for this one when I want an APA. Darn tasty!"
"nice gold orange color off white one inch head held fairly well with a moderate lacing. smell is apple, peach, lemon, citrus, i catch a bit of each. taste bready malt with hint of caramel up front and lemongrass citrus finish but without that bitter rind taste. light to medium mouthfeel and carbonation is ok. easy drinker, good session beer."
"Taste is like, what? That sip went down so fast and easy that I have to have another, then maybe another... It strikes a good balance between malt and hops, that's forsure. There's nothing outlandish here, just a very clean citric flavour and lots of earthy bittering hop character. The nutty malt is just enough to balance things out, there's a very mild caramel-like sweetness in the background, but nothing cloying to be sure. This is a very well-balanced and pleasing session beer. Mouthfeel is well carbonated, but not obnoxious, and the body is just perfect for the style. Aftertaste is bitter and finish is dry. Drinkability? This is almost the definition of drinkable, perfect for any time of the year and if I could buy it in Canada it just might be a constant in my fridge. Doesn't disappoint."
"Pours clear and golden with foamy head about 1/2"" which quickly dissipates leaving lacing on the glass. Smells of citrusy hops and toasty malt. Medium body with good mouthfeel and carbonation. This is one of my favorite beers-easy to drink with good balance of hops and malt and available at most all bars/distributors in the area."
" I remember years back when I first tried SNPA, thinking how great it was and it would make me pucker. Then; being introduced to IPA's and doubles, I kind of forgot about Sierra. Probally the beer responsible for my never-ending hop quest. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale= Old Faithful."
"If Im ever stranded on a desert island and am given the opportunity to choose one and only one beer to live with for the rest of my days, SN Pale Ale has to be on the candidate list. Is it the best beer Ive ever had ... well, no. But it is perhaps the best EVERY DAY beer Ive ever had. I could drink gallons of this, like a fish-tank full, and never get tired of it. It has the pentultimate balance of malt and hops with an awesome bouquet of ... well, everything. If some day I ever have the guts it takes to start my own brewery, I only hope my flagship brew is as good as this. Or, if I start my dream tavern some day, there will ALWAYS be a tap reserved for SN Pale Ale."
"Overall, a very good session beer. A good standard beer to have in the fridge. Very enjoyable. Great beer for burgers or munchies."
"Poured a clear golden honey color with a small white head that dissipated into a nice cap, left some nice lacing as I drank it. The smell is of citrus hops and caramel malts, a bit metallic. A bit of grapefruit in the taste, hops are not too pronounced but provide a lovely flavor, a nice malt backbone to balance the ale. Perhaps the best balance of flavorful hops and solid malt presence. It is well carbonated as apparent by the numerous bubbles rising to the top, smooth, and finishes with a flavorful hoppy sweetness if that makes sense. This is an extremly drinkable and flavorful APA."
"Pours a light amber color with a foamy white head. Leaves some nice lacing too. Aromas of fresh hops, citrus, some malt. Flavor has a nice malt presence which I enjoyed, along with the refreshing citric hop bite. Some hints of caramel as well. Good carbonation and mouthfeel. A great classic, SNPA is just a solid APA."
"A classic American pale ale. My bottle was a bit old, so I think some of the hop character faded with time."
"The measuring stick. Period."
"Considering this beer is distibuted more widely than many other beers rated on this site, I'd say it's pretty darn consistent. This being said, I still gave it a strict review. I have always respected this beer and would drink it over many others of its style. It's one you can come back to and one that you can find more easily than the rest."
"Nice American Pale Ale."
"Good good stuff"
"this is truly a fantastic brew...we are lucky to see this across the country at selected grocers. The nose is grassy of hops and sweet of semi-sweet chocolate. The beer pours a amber color with lots of small bubbles...but the beer is carbonated perfectly....the taste starts with the grapefruit and then graduates to some beautiful malted goodness with some roastedness to it. This is where the sweetness and richness(chocolatyness) and some other palate cleaning bitterness of late hops balance things out. Exceptional...especially for its' availability...for quality/availability/price...this is HARD to beat. At 7.49 a six i'd say it blows away most nearly ALL the imports on the shelf. SUPPORT WELL MADE DOMESTIC BREWS LIKE THIS!!!"
"I'll keep coming back to this one."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into my favorite mug. As expected from the style, pour produced small head which left behind little lacing. Dark golden color seemed just a bit hazy but still appealing. Got a nice aroma of piney hops but not overpowering. Smooth enjoyable flavor. I liked this beer even though I prefer a darker beer with a more prounced malt flavor. Mouthfeel is not overly carbonated. A nice balanced beer and a fine example of the style. Very drinkable"
"The flavor is very solid. The hops don't overpower the balance (as is the case with some APAs) but are noticeable and distinguished. It is balanced by a malt backbone for a smooth, enjoyable flavor. Mouthfeel is medium, not too carbonated, and smooth. Very drinkable. One of the better APAs out there for my money."
"D- Highly drinkable. Good beer to have if you're in the mood for something a little hoppy, but nothing to overwhelm you. Something I always have around."
" A very easily drinkable pale ale. Reliable stand-by to have at any bar."
"Wow the hefty malt backbone with the tangy citrus notes went down perfect. The head was a good two fingers and had some lacing down the whole glass.The flowery and musty earthtones from the hops really cool down the spicy salsa. Thanks to Garrett Oliver for that suggestion.Who needs a bad beer with a lime?"
"I really do need to try this stuff on tap one of these days."
"This is what a good pale ale should be! Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a light orange, with no head, and no lacing. The aroma is all hops with slight citrus. The taste is mostly hops, creating a very nice citrus flavor, with very little malt. The mouthfeel is medium. Overall, this is just a great pale ale. Very easy to drink, and a great session beer. Definitely try this one."
"D - One of my favorite everyday beers, easy drinking, high sessionability."
"Overall, this is a good APA. It defined the style way back when and is still an enjoyable beer."
"This is clearly one of America's finest beers. Everyone should be able to find it and should drink it. In this category I also enjoy Goose Islands Honkers Ale which is slightly more popular in the midwest."
"D - I can drink it, but there are many, many better beers out there. The best thing I can say about this beer is that it's the best thing Wal-Mart carries in the beer aisle."
"by volume- 5.6%. Decent."
"One of my favorite standby beers. A hoppy taste with a clean, clear finish, not to mention being everywhere in California, has made me sample this beer a great many times. Both in the bottle and on tap Sierra Nevada delivers with their Pale Ale. While not a ""special"" beer, nor one to be saved for that ""special occasion," it is a great brew to drink with friends in any situation. Receives a strong recommendation from me!"
"Average scores for appearance and smell may have to do with the fact that it was served on tap into a pilsner glass and the head did not properly form. Bad pour by the barkeep. Deep amber with minimal head. Good lacing along the sides of the glass. Very clear and bright. Smells of oatmeal and bananas. Taste has notes of coffee, earthy tones and finishs with a very slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with low carbonation. Pour me another."
"This is an excellent pale ale. It pours an nice copper-amber with good head retention. The smell is full of malts and a nice earthy hoppiness. The taste is excellent and quite balanced, a pit floral and grassy too. The mouthfeel is balanced and just right. Even though it's a bit more potent on the ABV, it drinks well and I can do a number of these."
"I have also found it to be inconsistant at times, although because of no dating on its label, it is hard to tell where the fault in that is...the retailer or the brewer."
"I've chosen Sierra Nevada Pale Ale for my first review because it's my favorite all-around beer. This one never fails to satisfy; I just love the strong and distinct taste of this beer. It pours a nice copper color with a thin head which doesn't hang around long. Both aroma and taste have hints of citrus. Finishes with a nice, slightly bitter aftertaste. This is the pale ale by which I judge all others; I've yet to find a better one among the dozen or so I've tasted. If you live in the Southeast US, try this beer with the chicken fingers and Zax sauce from Zaxby's. It's one of my favorite food/beer combinations."
"It pours an amber hue with a decent-sized off-white head the lasts quite a long time. The aroma has pine and malts. This is crisp and clean, but it's got more flavor than it get credit for having and the hop bitterness, which takes on a citrus character in the taste, is huge compared to the beers at most of the bar that serve it. It's medium-bodied and lively. A true benchmark."
"Overall, a great APA and one you can find anywhere, even in Prohibition south. A great beer for just having a beer."
"Poured a deep golden, with an admirable head. Hoppy aroma with hints of citrus, but too faint to stand out in any real way. The initial taste had major overtones of orange, quickly replaced by bitterness. The hops here seem less about flavor and more about bitterness, yet it never really felt like it got in the way, and the bitter flavor subsided to a much more sweet taste that finished very clean. The end result is a very good beer that is very enjoyable, and being readily available at many places that otherwise only serve macrobrews, it becomes a great choice during a night out at the bar."
"Overall a Superior Pale Ale - Slightly above average ABV make this one a great tasty session brew..."
"Drinkability is quite high. With the lightness on each flavor and a light body, everything was able to balance well with each other. This is doing MORE with LESS, and its no wonder its a winner throughout the nation. Its great for those who want to bridge the gap from tasteless BMC, and its great for someone like me who likes bold flavors but only when theyre his favorite flavors. Pine & Grapefruit hops are not my favorite, and this beer toned it down to a level that was very enjoyable for me."
"D - Definitely one of the top APA's I've ever had and a great brew to keep on hand for an everyday selection."
"Well I've been drinking this beer since the early 90's and it tastes the same today as it did back then. You can never go wrong with this American classic. SNPA has never let me down. it's been a staple in my fridge for more than 15 years. If it were not for this beer and this brewery blazing a path, we would most likely be stuck with a lot less choice when it comes to craft beer. Drink it now and drink it often."
"Had this tonight at the business get together. Wasn't sure if it was an English pale ale or an APA when I was there, so I figured it was an English pale ale because it tasted very malty. It had a good look to it: dark amber color with a decent, white head that retained throughout the beer. Smelled very malty; did not notice any kind of hops at all. Tasted malty as well; once again, no hoppy traces even noticed in the aftertaste which led be to believe that it was an English pale ale. A pretty nice mouthfeel; pretty thick, similiar to a Sam Adams in regards to mouthfeel. A good, drinkable beer, but did not taste like a good APA; I would have expected at least a little bit of a hoppy taste, at least to balance the malt, if I knew it was an APA when I was drinking it."
"This beer is highly drinkable; I could drink these all night."
"Pale Ale is probably my favorite style, second only to English Brown Ale, and this beer in particular is my favorite of Pale Ales. As silly as it may sound, I like the serene green color of the label and artwork. Now, as far as the beer itself, well it is just spectacular. It is very refreshing and not overly heavy. I simply love the spicy taste and the pleasantly bitter aftertaste always leaves me wanting another after I've finished a bottle or pint. Needless to say, this is a very drinkable beer by my standards and what I consider the bench mark when comparing other American pale ales."
"Overall, this beer was a disappointment, as it lacked the flavors and aromas needed to make up for its intense bitterness."
"Just drink & appreciate. :)"
"D: A good, drinkable beer, and a great example of an American Pale Ale. Not a beer I would ever turn down, and something I really see as a good bridge into the craft beer world from the macros."
"I really can't find any flaws -- the perfect session beer and the perfect beer to keep around to go with absolutely anything. I love this beer. A true classic."
"If one would like to split hairs, I would give it somewhat less than a 5 in every category except taste and drinkability but, as a man in love, I say to you - ""I don't care, she's perfect!"""
"Eric"
"It's a nice brew, but nothing special. A decent choice when the other choices are mostly macros. This is an easy-drinking APA."
"I got this on tap at Kildare's Irish Pub in King of Prussia. It came in a 12 ounze glass. There wasn't much head, but I think that was more a factor of the pour since the lace was more than apparent. Since there was no head, there was no retention either. The smell was rather good, but a bit to subtle. The taste was a typical pale ale, but I thought it was wonderful none the less. The was extremely smooth and the mouthfeel was nice. Very drinkable. Don't drink and review."
"Pours a decent amber, with no head, and a bit of lacing, very clear. Smell is citrus hoppy, but not overly so. Slight spiceyness as well. Taste is very crisp, with a dry hop finish. Very citrus flavored, and a bit of grassy, piney flavor as well. This has always been one of my favs, always easy to get, and always drinkable. Pretty much my standard at restaurants that don't have much. Its no IPA, and is by no means the Celebration, But I have never turned one down."
"The mouthfeel is addictive, partially due to the sticky hop finish which leaves you thirsty for another gulp. There is no more drinkable beer on the face of the Earth, and I'm enjoying my visit with an old friend."
"I found this to be very easy to drink, next time I organise a BBQ I will purchase a number of these. Very nice, but a drink for a hot summers day."
"Golden/amber in color and a slim head that fades to a small pool of fine bubbles and a thin laced ring. Honey and toffee sweetness and some floral notes in the nose. Hops offers some grassy, yeasty characters followed by peppery dryness. Malt characters are simple notes of honey, toffee, a touch of oak, and really just enough to balance the brew nicely allowing the hops to take the main stage. Thin to medium body and a smooth mouthfeel with a touch of fizz at the end. Moderately carbonated. Woody, bisquity, and slight malt sweetness in the finish."
"this beer is my definition of an everyday craft brew. great flavor, dry finsh. very refreshing. nice hop balance, not too bitter. all in all, exactly what i look for in an APA. don't get me wrong, there is nothing outstanding about this beer. unless of course you find that there is absolutely nothing offensive what so ever outstanding. there just isn't anything out of the ordinary. although i'm partial to east coast beers, sierra has definitly opened my mind to other west coast beers."
"Extremely drinkable. As said, very smooth and extra crisp. Great summer day beer."
"Pours a clear amber color with a small white head which diminishes quickly. A pleasant, somewhat sweet smell. Taste is crisp with a slightly sweet malt flavor and hops bitterness throughout. Aftertaste disappears very quickly. Mouthfeel is dry and light to medium bodied. Drinkability is very good. No problem downing several of these. Overall, this is not an exciting beer but a good one to have when you want to have a few."
"Poured a bottle into a certified british tulip pint glass. The cream colored head was two fingers high and slowly dissipated, leaving a significant amount of lace on the glass. The beer is quite clear and a dark amber in color. The aroma is strong hops and sweet malt. The flavor starts with floral notes, which fade to a medium bitterness. The bitterness is not so overwhelming, it's well balanced. The mouthfeel seems on the light side. A good beer all in all, more hops than many Pale Ales, but not as agressive as IPAs."
"Pours a clean orange almost clear straw color. Nice white head that dissipated pretty quickly. Mild lacing with some head retention. Smells floral and of a mix citrus fruits. Mild hint of lemon or a grapefruit like tone. Very strong hop citrus scent with a hint of some pale malt in the background. No freshness date to be found. Has a very soothing hop scent. Good bottle conditioned carbonation and a minimal amount of yeast sediment. Nice hop flavor in the initial taste followed by a rather interesting smooth mix of flavors. Hop bite mixed with a subtle touch of malt and grain. Has a rather citrus fruit, hop after taste. Very enjoyable and easy to drink. I have had this beer many times before and have never reviewed it. I am glad to have the chance to finally enjoy this beer for what it is worth. Good overall characteristics of a pale ale. Fine construction from start to finish. Good all around drinking brew. Has a good feeling in the mouth and leaves a nice hop bitterness in the back of the mouth. I forgot how much I enjoyed this brew."
"Perfectly clear golden color. Decent white head that laces a bit. Not that much going on with the smell. Taste is pretty good, lovely hops! At first glance you wouldnt suspect this brew to pack such a bitter punch but it does. I love how this beer is hopped. This is definitley a go to beer. I could have rather one too many of these!"
"Drinkablity: East to drink good for most occasions. Over all a very decent beer."
"Bolder than English pale ale counterparts like Bass, Boddingtons or Old Speckled Hen. Served in a pint glass, the ale displays a golden amber color with a foamy white head. The aroma is of multi-grain bread and biscuit-like pale malts, with a sharp citrus and floral aroma. A dry, slightly tart caramel taste opens the flavor, followed by hops. Derived from Sierra Nevada's generous but balanced use of Cascade hops, the pale ale also brings tastes of lemon zest and grapefruit with a sweet, spicy finish."
"Straw pale color, nice forthy white head. Has an herbal, yeasty nose, some slight hop bitterness. Tastes herbal and yeasty, bellied by a nice hop bitterness. Has an overall earthy flavor with some nice malt flavor as well. The finish is mainly fresh ops bitterness. Has a dry, refreshing crisp mouth feel. Totally drinkable, and is, for better or worse, what I think of when I think IPA."
"A nice refreshing and light mouthfeel which is a bit prickly at first (from the bottle conditioning, presumably), settles down to smooth-out the mouthfeel. Decanting into another vessel would help lessen the initial gassiness. A solid, session American-Pale which I'm glad to see hasn't changed over the years and is widely available."
"A very solid APA and a good session beer."
"I've had this so many times, it's bizarre I've never rated it yet. Tonight I had it on tap with dinner in Mountain View, CA. Nice clear orange color with 2-3 finger thick white foam. Good light aroma of hops, nice APA aroma. Flavor is also light, on the hoppy side. Excellent drinkability, a very nice session beer."
"You could enjoy anwhere from 1 to several. The best part is this very available and a great go-to beer when choices are otherwise limited."
"D: An ideal--maybe THE ideal--session beer. Drinks well, with an ABV that is present, but not prohibitive to drinking a sixer during the ball game."
"I poured this 12 ounce bottle in to a glass beer mug to see its straw yellow color and slight head. It is citrusy with a bit of bitterness to chase it. It has a nice hoppy flavor that is not overpowering. The mouthfeel is solid, making it a pretty drinkable beer. This is a solid choice."
"D - delicious, I drink this beer the most and it never lets me down. I am so amazed at how consistent Sierra Nevada can make this brew. Definitly a personal favourite."
"D- This beer had a light but good malt flavor with a interesting twist to the hops that gave it some good character."
"this is the best beer that i can remember ever drinking.got my first pint on tap at b j pizza in corpus christi,texas. has a slight haze.the first taste fills your mouth with flavor,has a citrus bitterness to it.this beer is so good even my light beer drinking daughters didnt think it was bad.i highly recomend this to anybody who wants to get out of their rut."
"Golden amber coloring with a creamy white head. A strong sharp hop aroma and sharp hop flavour. Smooth and full bodied. Very drinkable ale, especially for those who apreciate hops. Not to complex, just a well hopped beer. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is an excellent example of the style."
"Bottom line: This APA is a trendsetter, a one-of a kind craft-brew taste from a commercial brewery."
"all and all, a well rounded beer."
"Not a bad beer but I need to try some more of Sierra Nevada's brews."
"Pours a murky coppery amber color with a white lace that clings well onto the glass. Aroma is dominated by citrusy hops that give way to a slight maltiness and a bit of a metallic smell in the nose as well. Smooth bodied and a pretty simple straight forward beer (which is not a bad thing). Not overly hopped but a good amount. Overall, this is a good classic beer that is slightly better on-tap."
"This was my original crossover beer and I still think it's one of the best pale ales."
"This is a very quaffable version of a very quaffable style. I know the Americans can get it practically everywhere, hopefully it is just a matter of time for it to come to Canada."
"DA: this one is an all-time classic for myself and many others...I've brought this one to many music festival over the years and it has kept everyone very happy for the weekend. now, that's drinkability."
"Drinkability- the dinkability of this beer was to say one could drink it over a nice dinner and understand its flavor."
"An average beer that doesn't exactly excite me, but it's solid and consistant with an enjoyable gentle boldness. The best part about SNPA is that's it's available at every bar and beer store in the ENTIRE WORLD; even if it's the best beer there you're still not too bad off."
"D - excellent drinkability."
"This beer is perrenial. Enjoy!"
"Get my buzz on- y"
"Not the hoppiest pale ale out there, but a good example of the style"
"Very nice copper color-very clear beer I dont remember it being this clear but it has to be 5 or 6 years since I have had one. Decent aroma-mellow grassy smell to it with a slight bitter bite. Good flavor-nice level of bitterness with a grassy/citrus taste to it. Just malty enough to balance the whole thing. Good body. Very drinkable and enjoyable. I had forgotten what a classic beer this is. I need to come back here more often."
"Taste is hoppy with distinct citrus notes and exotic fruits, a little sharp. Bitterness is a little much at first but I get used to it. A good malt backbone is supporting the bitterness, which do not balance the beer, but make a good effort. Carbonation is sizzling on my tongue. Mouthfeel is OK and drinkability is assured."
"M&D - smooth and highly palatable, easy down, a great session beer, a classic, what more can i say?"
"Used to be a go to Pale ale, but now there are just too many other solid Pale ales and IPAs out there for this one to stand out like it did in the past. Still a solid pale ale."
"Drinkability: A good example of the American Pael Ale. Nice level of bitterness withou being a hop bomb. Seems to be on the acidic side, which may detract from its drinkability a little."
"This is an enjoyable pale ale to drink. It would easily make a great session or crossover brew, for someone looking to start appreciating hoppier beers. This is something i will drink again. Its nice summer refreshment with just enough body to enjoy the whole year."
"Poured at cellar temperature into pint glass. Pours a deep, rich golden orange. Thick, light beige head topped things off. Aroma was a complex of floral and citrus hints with a slight malty background. This ale begins with a rich, lightly sweet taste profile that quickly blends with a citrus bitterness. The middle throuh the finish is a smooth competition between the malty sweetness and hops. Very well balanced and satisfying ale. One of the best examples of an American Pale Ale out there."
" Success does breed contempt and. also, once it became commonplace it lost the ""cool factor"" so important to folks, but this remains one of the very best beers in America. some of SN's other varieties may not be that great but this is."
"This ale has a good feel to it and is a nice way to start a dreary evening. It's not the greatest, but its not bad in anyway. More of just lacking the ""wow"" quality."
"M&D: nicely carbonated, though it's slightly sharp upfront; the medium body holds the smooth and well-blended flavour elegantly. Overall, much better than the tap-version that I tried a month ago. An extremely quaffable pale ale to be enjoyed in quantity with friends!"
"The beer pours an amber brown color with a light lacing. It has a spicy hops smell that tickles the nose. There is also a fruity floral smell to this beer. The taste is hops and more hops. Its blended well with a malty fruit and finishes with a nice spicy bite. The feel is smooth with a tingly bite. It finishes with a hard bite but clears quickly and leaves little bitter after taste. Over all this is a fine pale ale."
"This ale is light and crisp, and I would certainly be able to sink a few in a sitting. It lacks the sickly sweet taste I feared it would have, and is overall a nicely rounded drink. This would go down just chipper on a warm, dry day, which we seldom have here:(. All in all, I was very pleased with this beer as an introduction to American pale ales, and I hope I continue to have good fortune with them in the future."
"This is one of the first craft beers I tried about 5 years ago and somehow never got around to reviewing this beer. Appearance is a clear amber color with a head that as white as fresh snow. Smell is typical of a pale ale a mix of hops and malts neither out weighing the other. Taste is crisp , clean with some bitterness. Mouthfeel is not light but malty and smooth. I could easily drink a six pack of these on a nice summer day and be as content as could be."
"Poured a copper color with an 1/2"" off-white head that faded to just a thin layer of foam. Smells faintly of hops with some hints of citrus, nothing overpowering. Taste is great: clean, crisp and balanced. Some bitterness at the beginning followed by hops with a clean finish. Nice mouthfeel, not too thick not too thin. Great drinkability. My favorite American Pale Ale. Deserves its reputation as one of the best. Bottom line this is another excellent beer. Sierra Nevada does it again."
"Medium, almost to the low watery side, mouth feel."
"A solid pale ale, more bitter than its English counterpart. Solid APA in my book."
"This beer poured a clear gold with a small head that dissipated quickly. The smell is very hoppy and slightly sweet. The taste is hoppy and bitter. The mouthfeel is thin and crisp. The carbonation has a noticeable bite. This is an excellent example of a pale ale."
"Enjoyable and very easy to drink, a go to beer for myself and trillions of others."
"This beer pours a beautiful golden color with a creamy white head that will last a while, with good lacing. The smell is amazing it is very full and rich once I had the bottle open I could smell this beer. The taste is nice and complex without being overwhelming. I notice a slight bitter taste that will linger for a little while. This beer has good carbonation so it feels really good in your mouth. The drinkability is really good too, I could easily finish a few of these in a sitting."
"Pours a golden-copper color, with a small amount of head and lacing. Immidiate taste is of a citrisy hops (which dominate almost to the point of an IPA) followed by a smooth light malt flavor that leaves a enjoyable slight aftertaste. The body is relativly light and combined with the flavor, makes for a very drinkable beer. An excellent example of an APA. Must try."
"Thank You Sierra Nevada!"
"This beer/brewery gets accolades around here. They're deserved. Really nice beer."
"Very drinkable, but best when really fresh. My scores are for draft at an average place. They would be higher at the brewery or in bottles."
"Beer poured from the tap, a nice copper color, with excellend head, retention, and lacing. Gave a mild hop aroma and taste, but felt it lacked a little in the bitterness category compared to other pales. Gave a nice crisp mouthfeel, good drinkability. All in all an very good beer."
"All in all, I have this in my fridge at all times. No matter how much my friends make fun of me. This is a good beer."
"Overall, this is a great brew. It's main strengths are it's crisp and clean character, along with its excellent hop flavor and aroma. This brew is high-quality...a must have."
"First words that come to mind are: well built, sturdy, balanced, and delicious. A fine, soft white head sits for a short time above a clear butterscotch amber. The smells are fresh, citric and piney hops and bakery. The taste has a wonderful smooth bitter start, a sweet malt follows, chewy and slightly nutty. Great balance. The finish is dry and long. The mouthfeel is buttery and full. Everything works. It's a hit. So, so drinkable and doesn't fade."
"Sierra Nevada is the standard upon which all APA's should be measured. It pours hazy amber with off white head. The smell is citrusy (grapefruit) hops. Taste is malty sweetness, fruitiness, citrusy hop flavor and hop bitterness, all in a perfect balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. I could have several of these easily. I would certainly reccomend this."
"Overall a very solid brew. The perfect model for what an APA should be. I will have to make a permanent spot in my fridge for this as it starts to become available nation wide."
"This is arguably the mother of American pale ales, a status it wears well and deserves to keep. When one compares pales, the standard to which they're compared is Sierra Nevada. Everyone should try this at least once."
"drinkability is good as expected for this classic american pale ale"
"Overall, a very good pale ale that would be great in the summer. Complex enough to be enjoyable, but light enough to drink several....this beer could be quite dangerous. Awesome."
"This is one of those beers that you really have to fight yourself on as far as when to stop. I could easily kill a sixer of this without much thought. Pours a nice light brownish/red color with just a small bit of foam. The smell is very nice indeed, one of the best smelling beers I've ever had I think. It's got a very nice blend of hops and citrus, with the hops maybe taking a slight edge. Taste is also good, a bit citrusy at first and then very hoppy with a pretty smooth feel to it."
"The beer has a bright, perky high note of maltiness and orange tastes and has a hint of hoppiness, the hoppiness is not over the top by any means."
"Overall, a classic American pale ale that sets a standard, but gives room for improvement."
"Presents itself as a nice light amber with a thick white head. Sporadic lacing in the pint glass. Nose is lively with hops, citrus, floral notes, and candy. Palate is definitely hoppy up front, with a good malty backbone giving it a touch of sweetness. Good flavor. Mouthfeel is light, with a good hop bite. Adequate carbonation. A very refreshing pale ale with strong hop presence. Something short of an IPA, of course, but isn't shy with the hops. Finishes quite well balanced. This is another one I can get on-tap locally and am thankful for it. A nice alternative to the macro crap that rules this region. A good solid American Pale."
"Ah, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, the ravest of beer these days besides Corona and all that Mexican stuff. Pours a copper-ish red color with robust head. The smell is very strong, noble hops again? I swear Redhook ESB and this beer have the exact same bitterness characteristics...Taste is strong and bitter, what a beer with balls should taste like. Not anything like the European Pale Ales! I'll say that much! The drinkability is low because of its bitterness, but it is damn tasty with many different elements slapping your tongue from all angles. Maybe I'm not old enough to fully appreciate the taste of this beer yet, but its something I'd definitely get to have fun with some friends with. And the ABV will promise that!"
"D-This is a great beer to sit around with and have a few. Alcohol content is higher than normal but not overly so which means the evening won't have to end too soon. One of the better APA's out there that really has become the standard for other breweries to follow. A great step to work your way up the hop-ladder to the big IPA's out there."
"D=Not a bad overall beer, but lacks any outstanding qualities."
"Fishbine, we meet again. I've said this before with the Bell's Two Hearted Ale and I reiterate it here: I simply don't get the appeal of pale ales with their citrusy rind taste. It's an intentional thing but comes through like a tragic mistake. Why muddle an otherwise smooth and creamy beer with a brunt anvil of flavor? It warms a lot better than the Two Hearted Ale but the sugar-sucked lemon-orange squeeze of bitterness gives me no joy. Stan Heironymus, send in the Trappist Monks, the abbey has been overriden by a bitter toucan named Sam."
"What a classic American brew. SNPA pours a golden honey colour with a fluffy white head that sticks to the side of the glass. The nose is sweet but citrusy and spicy with hops. The taste is bigger than most any widely available brew. Plenty of bittering hops, plenty of aroma hops, and plenty of malt to balance it all out."
"A standard. When you say ""Pale Ale"" in the USA, this is usually what you mean. I think you can't really go wrong with this one... this is always a good choice at a bar or a pub. It isn't my favorite all time brew, but certainly a stand by. I have also found that this is one of the few beers I have tried that doesn't seem to lose much when drank from a bottle. An excellent session beer."
"A classic example of the APA style. A must try."
"4.0/4.0/4.0/4.0/4.0"
"so yeah i eally enjoy seeing the little ""floaters"" hanging out in the bottom of this fine bottle conditioned ale. now i am not all that great about identifying the flavors i taste, so i will be simple here. it has this nice color about it when poured. looks like a penny to me. not a shiny penny but one thats been in your pocket a few times. and it has a nice white head that leaves a decent lacing. smells piney, citrusy and sweet, and it tastes just like it smells. not alot of carbonation that i can see, or taste, but what a fine beer. this beer is the one i would reccomend all people try who want to better there beer taste. simply put not too complex, but not simple at the same time. i love SNPA"
"Taste is exactly what I love in a pale ale: plenty of hops and yet a good malt body. Mouthfeel is lighter than the eastcoast (dogfish) stuff that I'm used to, but I still love this beer. Drinkability is great due to the lighter mouthfeel. This beer is the trademark entry into craft brewed beer. Sierra Nevada has yet to upset me."
"When I first had this beer (well over a year ago), I didn't like it. I found it much too citrusy. Either that bottle was from a bad batch, or I've grown to appreciate this a lot more; I'm not sure... This is definitely a top-notch American pale ale that is widely available. Everyone should try this beer -- it looks and tastes great, and you really can't go wrong with it."
"Drinkability: very quaffable, perfect for sessions with friends, one of my go-to beers."
"This is a reliable fall back beer for most bars. It's good on-tap and in bottles."
"I really like this beer. Right now, if I was craving hops, but didn't want my mouth destroyed, this is what I'd turn to."
"Have had this both on tap and in bopttle....rating this based on last mnights draft. Poured to a rich amber with a foamy head, which did not stay long. Spicy with a hint of fruit. Drank this with a rack of ribs, a perfect complement and a good finish"
""
"Pale Ale is a nice contrast to other styles in that I don't feel like I need to hang around and let it warm up in order to release hidden attributes. Like revenge, Sierra Nevada is sweet and best served cold. I drink it pretty fast and love every second of it. I cannot think of a more welcome Summer drink."
""
"I hadn't read all the other reviews when I first tried this recently. Bad reviews wouldn't have changed how much I liked this one but it did feel good anyway to see everyone else seemed to think highly of it too. I like the darker stuff too. Good extra stouts , the seasonal 'Stone' , Anchor Porter etc.. But this Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has got to be my 'desert island' beer!"
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has recently grown to be my favorite all-around beer. It is well-priced, available most anywhere across the states, has highly drinkable session-like qualities, and it just plain tastes good."
"SN Pale Ale is a classic. I can easily session these all day, which I had the pleasure of doing over a weekend camping trip. In fact, through a casual survey, SN Pale Ale seems to be the top camping beer on BA right now."
"SNPA is proof that beer can be mass produced and still very flavorful."
"D: Drinkability is great. Bitterness may get to be too much after a few, but overall this is a great drinking beer with great flavors."
"It's nicely carbonated. If you ask me, this is the quintessential session beer. It's obvious why this beer has had such success"
"This beer is almost perfect. I didn't like it in my younger years, but I adapted quickly to the strong taste of hops. This beer pours a slightly dark yellow, witha nice amount of head which remains quite nicely. Smells of hops, very mild smell, but in a good way, not empty, just mild. Tastes almost perfect, quite mild, but also very hoppy at the same time, a very very good balance. The only reason I took drinkability to 4.5 is because at 5.6% and how good this beer tastes, it's hard to keep yourself from getting drunk. Really premier beer, I like this one a lot... a lot. Great beer at a reasonable price (for a premium brew). Check it out."
"SNPA is medium-bodied, and I believe a bit oily from the hops used. Also, it goes pretty well with the pizza I just had. This is a great brew to introduce people to the world of better beer."
"Drinkability: Yum. So very good. I've had this beer with many foods and it is quite versatile, but I have never been so pleased as when I matched it with liguini with clams in a simple white wine sauce."
"abv isn't too high, tastes great, super-session brew and classic in my catalogue of legends at this point."
"Can't ask for much more than that from this legend."
"i live SNPA it is a baseline standard for other american pales to be judged by. clean refreshing perfectly hopped."
"Drinkability: Clearly a great pale ale. Not especially complex or flavorful, which is nice, very drinkable. I can drink many of them without my mouth getting saturated with flavors."
"Drinkabaility: A great beer that's a must try and it wouldn't be hard to find it, it's almost everywhere in the US and at a good price too. Something that I will have again!"
"D  Easy to drink and an all-round good beer."
"one of the most drinkable beers i've had. this is my ""go to"" beer all year long."
"D = Very drinkable. Great session beer."
"You can drink and enjoy Sierra forever. It's a wonderful, everyday brew."
"Although not as over the top as some American pales, this one is textbook."
"D: An American standard. A classic."
"drinkablility: very good...this one goes with a lot of food and make you want another."
"A very strong hop aroma, very pale to golden hue (rust?), moderate in carbonation and body. Somewhat bubbly with a large white head. Very clean in apparance. Very high in hop flavor. Smooth going down, a slight hop bitterness noted with a slight aftertaste, but good. A very refreshing beer, just tastes good a beer you can drink for all occaisions."
"The beer is great for summer and spring. Amazing bbq beer as it matches most food. Excellent beer to make a very excellent day...now where's my lawnchair?"
"I like this beer a lot, though I have to say that it's not one of my all-time favorites. Whether you love it or merely like it, I think we all owe a debt of gratitude for the role this beer played in the growth of craft beer in the US."
"Sometimes, after drinking all kinds of fancy porters, stouts, wits, hefes, IPA's, belgians and germans, you just have to go back to where it all began. Every so often, I have to buy this beer, it's in my blood. Classic looking APA, straw colored with an outstanding smell. This beer is like potato chips, can't just have one. Washes down with a smooth, hoppy goodness. Extremely smooth and crisp, with slight grapefruit flavoring. Nice head leaves some lacing down the glass. Hey, it can't get much better than a Sierra Nevada APA on a hot day!"
"Nice looking beer.. for a pale this as close as it gets. This has very citric hops and some warm/dry malts in the smell. Taste is extremely close to the smell, but with a stickier body. Mouthfeel has the right amount of carbonation with hop/malt balance. I remember this was one of the first craft beers I had and I likened the hop taste to something like mosquito repellent. I'm glad some things change."
"Is it fair to call this beer the granddaddy of Pale Ale's in the US? I'm not sure but I will anyway. I get a massive 2 inch head from my gentle pour (2 inches is too much in my oh so humble opinion) and a scant bit of lacing. Body is a shade below amber. Nose is pretty faint but brings to mind sweet caramel and grapefruit hops. Taste is at first sweet, then bitter then full of caramel and grapefruit. Very nice balance. Neither the malt nor the hops outshine the other. Mouth is rich and full. If you want to session a pale ale this is the one for you."
"The beer poured nice with a decent but thin head that lingered a bit and finally stayed as a nice ring throughout the entire drink. Was a brown-orange color that was very nice to look at. unfortunately it smelt somewhat skunky, not very pleasing. The taste however made up for the smell. it had a full taste with a hint of bitter and rich aftertaste common in ales. The drink is heavily carbonated but feels nice overall. this beer is clean and crisp enough to drink several in a row but tasty enough to enjoy while doing it."
"A damn good fall-back session beer when it's fresh. Classic APA top to bottom."
"Bob says go get some."
"Notes: One of my breakthrough beers for getting into craft beers and still one I pick up before barbecues and concerts or to have around the house."
"This brew pours a brillant clear red color with a touch of bronze to it. The head is massive for a pale ale, creamy yet fluffy. The aroma is full of pine resin with a hint of orange underneath. The taste is more than I have grown to expect from a pale ale, and is more than the aroma lets on. It is full of pine, and has a nice lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, I have been a BA living in America for almost a year now, and have to say that my biggest mistake in that year is not having tried this sooner. It might not be the best pale ale out there, but it is close to it. I will certainly buy this beer again."
"A really solid beer and a great American Pale Ale. By far the best beer that I can find in my local super market."
"Very easy drinking. It would be easy to down a few of these without any problem."
"Taste is citrusy hops followed by a hint of sourness. Malt just barely balances out the hoppiness. One of the hoppier pale ales on the market, and a decent session brew. Nothing really special about it, just a good, solidly brewed beer."
"Appearance is still fine, deep golden color, respectable head with fair lacing. Smell of hops is much fainter than I remember, with no discernable direction. Taste is nothing special. Malty, but not too much & not too fresh tasting. Hops have no cajones. This is SN's #1 brand & it is simply average. Now, I don't know if the offerings from DogfishHead & Bell's have raised the bar beyond the reach of SN Pale Ale, or if SN changed it on us, but it does not seem nearly as special as it once did. I still love the Celebration Ale from SN."
"Overall: A decent hopsy ale, recommended."
"Finishing this beer as I type this. It poured into my glass a golden orangish color, with considerable head and a decent lace. I've seen this beer hyped up on this website and finally bought a six pack. This first beer I really enjoyed, but maybe it was all mental due to the hype. After finishing the 6 pack, I'm really not all that impressed. This plenty other beers I would buy over this. Although, I am interested in the other offerings Sierra Nevada has to offer."
"Golden orange color with a beautiful frothy head leaving a nice lacing. Nice combination of floral and citrus hops in the aroma. Pine, orange, and biscuit flavors make up the majority of the taste, nicely balanced. Lightly carbonated and medium bodied. Pretty good beer and consistent as well. It's great having this beer easily available."
"End notes: I've heard a lot of people talking about how great this beer was. I guess I had my hopes up to high because it really didn't bring to me what I was hoping for. It's not bad by any means but more of it's not my favorite. I would never think of trying to talk somebody out of buying this."
"In my opinion, a staple. I use this beer as a standard from which I measure every American Pale Ale I try. While few have exceeded this one in flavor and aroma, most fall short. Another plus is that it is readily available in most areas of the country I have visited."
"Overall = Probably the best ubiquitous beer you can find. I default to this every time i'm at a pub which doesn't cater to beer advocates."
"The color is amber golden and it pours with a finger of nice, thick foam. The smell is strong of grass, citrus, and a little roasted just like a PA should. The taste is an excellent balance between sweetness and bitterness with the latter taking over in the end. There's a tinge of chocolate in there too. Carbonation is just right. A friend to trust."
"Musings: I am not a huge SN fan in general - but this is onebrew I almost always have around. It is a perfect summer brew - refreshing and brisk but still maintaining the depth."
"Overall a very pleasant beer that can be sessioned well and is perfect for drinking with peanuts, hot dogs, and popcorn at a summer's baseball game."
"It's a beautiful copper colour, with a great head and the hops are very fragrant and well balanced. I love this beer."
"Great, great beer for hop lovers, and beer lovers of all kinds need to try this one."
"I do enjoy this beer more than others."
"-SS"
"Very dependable especially at the price."
"Very good beer, and in fact the beer that got me into micro to begin with. This beer has it all, great smell, great hoppy taste, and can be found anywhere. Always a safe bet while beer shopping. It suprises me that Sierra Nevada can produce so much of this beer while having such a fresh hop flavor and incredible smell."
"If I had to choose one beer to drink for the rest of my life, I would flat out go crazy. But if I could put together a short list of them, this would be my first entry. When I want to enjoy a beer on a hot summer day, this is the first that comes to mind. It has been there for me so many times when I am blind drunk at 1:30am at the bar. Its exquisite pale/mildly-hoppy flavor makes for a truly tasty beer that can be enjoyed in one at a time, or many at a time."
"12oz brown bottle with no apparant freshness date. Pours a medium gold/slight amber with a 1 finger head that faded rather quickly and just OK lace. Nice grassy hop aromas mixed with a good amount of malt smells as well. Not as hoppy as I thought. Again a good hoppy grassy flavor, a bit citric but not as prominant as I had thought. Perhaps a bit watery. Nicely balanced. A good solid pale ale - nothing special, but solid."
"I liked this beer, but I prefer the SN India Pale Ale, and that's just more of a style preference on my part than it is a criticism of this beer."
"Poured from 12 oz.'er rendering nice head that recedes to surface skim. Hazy yellow amber. Slight amount of lacing. Aroma - Citrusy and some pine. Hint of bready malt. Taste - pretty much as promised by aroma; much citrus and bready malt very evenly balanced. Not especially as bitter as nose would have. Very clean finish. Mouthfeel - full, more carbonation than expected, slight hop slickness coating. Drinkabilty - could pound one after another, or just chill and sip. A good stand-by for hopheads when other things are scarce (owing to its wide availability), and a good gateway to hoppiness west-coast-style to the uninitiated; in short: an American classic and standard."
"Smelled strongly of hops. A little citrusy and piney. A little more unbalanced toward the hops than what I think a pale ale should be. Almost into the IPA range. Nice full mouthfeel and fairly drinkable. All around a good beer."
"Easy drinking, dangerous...can drink several without thinking of it."
"An interesting note: I recently discovered that, when enjoyed out of a glazed clay mug, one gets an even better taste out of this beer. It seems the clay and/or the shape of the mug (slightly bulbous at the bottom with a narrower neck, in this case) brings out more flavor. Either that, or I just got an exceptionally good bottling. Give it a try."
"Cheers2Beers"
"All in all a good beer and it seems to be available more and more places on draft, so that is good for every one. Give it a try if you have a chance and for most of you try it again and again, it's always a good standard to have."
"Pours a light caramel color. Super bubbly and topped off with a fluffy white head. Aromas of that nice grapefruity Cascades, so distinct with SN. Also a bit of a biscuity malty background. This is perhaps one of the most balanced beers I've had. Hops are assertive, yet not overpowering. That bready malty character gives it great body and complimentary flavors. This is a perfect everyday beer as it doesn't get in the way of foods nor is it boring. However, I feel it's a bit too syrupy on the tongue, a little out of character for this style. Would also like to see some more dry hopping for additional aromas. Overall, a rather average beer, not my favorite of SN."
"Amber color with a large covering cream. Stinky, doughy and sweaty yeast aroma, which hints of medicine and vitamins, unsuccessfully attempts to disguise itself with a lightly aromatic, herbaceous and floral hop scent. Light caramel in the nose as well, but pretty much just stinky yeast and dulled hops. I still find the yeast character to be obtrusive upon tasting, though not as bad as the aroma. The malt flavor is very light and grainy and to me, doesnt blend well at all with the mildly aggresive hop flavor and bitterness. The hops which shift from herbaceous, to floral to piney (on the finish) are moderately pleasing, but overall, this is just a poorly balanced beer, plus the yeast stinks or something."
"Nice, light orange color with an short white head. Smell of lots of hops, and a hint of pine - perfect for the style. It tastes of a lot of hops, some lemony citrus, some pine, some floral, but all well balanced. This is a hop-lovers delight. This feels great in the mouth. The carbonation is not overdone, the brew has a creamy consistancy. Its complex with lots of flavors, but not over the top, making a very drinkable American Pale Ale. The benchmark for the style."
"Drinkability - my palate tends to tire of IPA after a while but this is one I could drink several of. 4.0"
"This is a beer that you can find almost anywhere. The color is a light amber. There was little head. The smell is like a fresh cut pine tree. The taste is fairly bitter. The mouthfeel is filled with lingering bitterness. I could session these but this is not my favorite from the style. All in all, an average beer."
"Cheers!"
"One of my favorite ""standard"" ales. I try to keep some on hand at all times. If i go to a bar or restaurant, this is my fall-back if they have nothing else special. Fortunatly it is often at most places weve gone to. Just a little hoppier than most pale ales, but still nicely balanced. Great color, aroma, and lingering taste!"
"D - Well, this went from my favorite to a fairly regular beer. Too many craft brews have destroyed my pallete. Easy drinking APA but no longer as hoppy as I'd prefer in my APA's."
"Revisiting an old classic. This beer and Anchor Steam are what started me down the road to good beer many years ago. Pours a pale copper color with an off white head from a brown twist off bottle. Aroma is excellent, nice and hoppy. Hops dominate the taste as well. This is really a standard of American craft brewing, it's consistently good, easily available and quite drinkable."
"this is a nice beer for 'session' drinking. picked some up when going to the beach last week, didnt know what to expect...i was impressed. smell is light citrus...taste is like a mild IPA, light hops are prominent and theres not much in the way of malts or dark flavors at all. drinkability is very good for this type of beer, you could easily knock back a few without it losing appeal or getting you trashed. my friend quit drinking his miller and kept grabbing my sierra nevada pale ales."
"Sierra Nevada Pale will always be my first beer love, but I am anxious to find out what else is out there."
"it had a slight hoppy aroma. upon drinking, it had a nice sweet bite and not much of an aftertaste in my opinion. overall pretty pleasant with a nice light body."
"D- I would very much enjoy drinking a sixer of this stuff. Awesome taste, beginning and end. Definetly as good as its hype. Freakin good pale ale."
"Exceptionally fine beer - has become a staple in my fridge. A bit filling at 200 calories / bottle, but there's nothing like one after work."
"Pours a nice copper color with a 1 1/2 finger head that settles into a nice lacing. Mild carbonation, a few bubbles rising to the top. Aroma is subdued, grapefruity hops. Taste is just about perfectly balanced, the malt and hops (pine & grapefruit come to mind) complement each other, not fight each other for dominance. There's a lingering hoppy aftertaste, but again, not overpowering. Mouthefeel is smooth, not heavy or watery, and it would be oh so easy to down one after another as a session brew, as I have many a time during football season. A nice, solid, dependable brew for all...just enought oomph for craft brew lovers, but wouldn't overpower a macro drinker that you're trying to win over."
"The Sierra Nevada Pale Ale I would have to say is a classic. One of my favorite beers that never let's me down. Bought many kegs of this , it is great on tap(and also in the bottle) poured a beautiful copper with a nice frothy head. Nice sweet aroma of hops. Great full bodied taste of hops that ends nice and bitter. This brew is very drinkable. Great on a hot summer day!!"
"Whether this brew is in a botte or on tap, it makes very little difference to me. This brew is a nice copper hue with a large foamy head. The aroma is of juicy hops and slight bubblegum. The flavor is pure heaven. There is a lot of hop oil and then full malty body, followed by a stiff bitter finish! The body is full. The drinkability is exceptional; I use this as my #1 session brew so it can be drank almost everyday without fail. There is a relaxing quality to three of these...."
"A classic American Pale Ale."
"Overall I really enjoy this beer. I find it a good purchase since it is so widely available in my area at every grocery store. There is no other grocery store beer here that I would like to have, a very good APA."
"Overall: A nice APA. Clean and doesn't have too much of an overbearance of hops even though hops is the dominant presence in this beer."
"24oz Bomber. In a beer mug. The beer poured a beautiful deep amber with about a 1/2 inch of off white foam that slowly disappears, but leaves a lacing around the sides of the glass. It has a clean, refreshing smell of hopps. Taste is also refreshing. A little fruit maybe at the beginning of the sip...then the hopps give it a nice crisp finish. This is a fairly carbonated beer that makes your tongue tingle. Drinkability: This is a beer that I tried a long time ago and did not really care for. I decided to give it another try and I purchased a bomber. I still was not so sure of it, but my the end of the 24oz I began to appreciate the hopps(for this reason it got a 4.5 on taste). This beer opened me up to many others, and I feel that it is now my standard for american pale ales. Since that first bomber and the fond memory of it I seem to only buy this beer in 22oz format(or on tap). Although I did not like this beer at first I now find it really enjoyable, and extremely drinkable. Its a great intro to hopps."
"ed note- I have found an inconsistancy in this beers hop profile. Some bottles are really hopped up and out of balance with the other flavors and this effects the taste. However when this beer is on it is one of the standards of the style."
"This is definitely a benchmark American Pale Ale, although not quite as good as Great Lakes burning river, this one is a winner."
"That's exactly what happened last night when I visited one of the many boring sports bars in Charlotte where the number of TV's outnumbers the selection of beers. The beer pours a slightly hazy, dark golden color with a pillowy one inch head. Aroma is hoppy and fruity with plenty of citrusy smells too. The taste is that wonderful flavor of Cascade hops, grapefruity and lemony, with a nice thirstquenching bitterness backed up with the solid sweetness of malt. This beer has never disappointed me and I have never had a bad bottle or a bad pint of this stuff. I'll take this any day over most macros."
"Overall, Sierra Nevada lives up to its long accepted status as a moderate classic brew. Nothing terribly complex here, but all of the basics of the style are well done. Classic session beer if there ever was one."
"Drinkability: The go-to beer at so many bars; always a good choice but I'll need to take another look from time to time as this bottle wasn't tasting fresh"
"to tell the truth. ten years ago, before i started liking craft beer, i thought this beer was down right vile. but i kept drinking it, and the more i drank it , the more i liked micro brews. i know this is not your typical ba review (taste, appearance, smell, etc), but it is more of a testamonial of how this beer made a macro swilling college boy to micro sippin fool. thanks sierra nevada. you may not be the best ipa i have ever had, but....wait a minute i am getting to sappy here...anyway, this beer is an awesome gateway beer for those on the edge between crap and micro brews....cheers sierra nevada"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. A clear golden body with a slight orange tint. A solid white foam cap leaves nice lace. The usual northwest hops gives off the citrus, fruity aroma with a trace of grainy malt. Medium bodied. The fruity sharp hops last till the end and finishes crisp. The carbonation gives off a bit of metalic taste."
"It isnt difficult to see why this beers does so well. A good body and overall good flavor."
"This beer is one of my mainstays, I like to keep a sixer around at all times. I just finally got around to reviewing it. If for some reason you haven't tried this yet, go out and grab a sixer."
"Edit: I'm having another one of these at considerably lower temperature. This allows a lot more pale malt and caramel malt flavors to come through. Also, I'm now noting the hops to be somewhat spicy."
"Pours a pale shade of bronze, clouded by the yeast pour. Three-finger head is dense, and slowly settles to a thin but hardy cap and leaves spotty lace. The nose has a good american barley scent, the hops are floral, and the faintest fruit ester appears in the background. Earthy malt flavor, almost green and not sweet in the least. Afteratste is dry, with a healthy dose of citrusy hops that provide a good balance of bitter and sweet. The mouthfeel is the perfect combination of low carbonation and a solid medium body. Session level drinkability; even the hint of diacetyl that shows up in the finish is appropriate for the style. This is the benchmark APA to judge all others against."
"This beer pours an amber gold with a frothy white head that dissipates in to a thick film that lasts and laces the whole way down the beer. The smell hits you initially with the aroma of the hops. First of all the distict floral and citrus flavors that are so common. There is also a hint of some lightly toasted pale malts. The taste is also fantastic. The hops are obviously the focus of the beer but this does not prevent the beer from preventing some delightful sweet and toasted malts. Again the normal floral/citrus hops are most prevalent but once the beer is tasted the citrus flavor seems to dominate. The mouthfeel is carbonated well with some nice thickness. There is also a welcome dimension of bitterness associated with this beer. Overall I really enjoy this one and have to give it a 5 on drinkability. This is one I will come back to again and again."
"This beer pours an apricot honey color with a thin white head that left a nice frosting of lace. Smells of muddy oats, wheat, green grass and pine along with some musky lager-like tones. The malt base of this tastes like doughy wheat crackers of some sort, or perhaps rye crisps with a bit of straw. The hops bring out a definite grapefruit dryness but also lets in a little green grape and blueberries. The finish awkwardly transitions to a sterile dryness that almost mandates another sip. The mouth feel is light to medium bodied with lots of light carbonation that I found to be a bit distracting. This is a nice mellow blend of flavors that is a bit to dry in the end for my liking."
"D - highly, highly drinkable beer. Easy to pound a few of these and still have a long evening ahead. Very tasty brew. The definitive American Pale Ale."
"This has become my ""go to "" brew for all occasions. Tough to beat it pricewise as well as for flavor. It is spicy and hoppy and has enough of a malt backbone to make it interesting. The luscious copper color and off-white head make this a nice beer to look at and the citrus aroma from the west coast hops stir the appetite and make this a nice aperitif. I always keep this baby in the house."
"In my opinion, its one of the best beers out there, for a variety of reasons: its infinitely drinkable, its tasty enough for the even the most serious craft beer purist to enjoy but approachable enough that even the most committed swill drinker can appreciate it and, to top it all off, its widely available on draft and in bottles (six-packs, 12-packs, and even bombers!). For all these reasons, its one of the best beers to recommend when turning macro drinkers onto better beer. Highly, highly recommended."
"While I'd be fine with, say, a Dogfish Head 60 Minute for session purposes, SNPA is still thoroughly enjoyable as a crisp, easy-drinking APA with enough flavor to satisfy the discriminating beer drinker."
"Overall this is an excellent beer. It’s very straight-forward and doesn’t try to blow you away or try to hide anything. This beer is a great “next step” for those trying to break away from the Miller/Bud/Coors/Heineken/Corona rut."
"i haven't tasted the stuff out of the bottle recently so i can't compare the two"
"An amber/copper color, with a nice white susatining head. A wonderful aroma of flowers and citrus comes through on the first scent. Feels slightly watery in the mouth, the hop flavor comes through from start to finish, with hints of malt and barley. The hops dominate the palate. This is the standard for all other pale ales, intense hop flavor, but not to overwhelming. This is a beer I can never get enough of, truely an excellent beer."
"Overall, I think this would be a great beer to drink as an all around refreshing beer. Pleanty of taste to keep you drinking, with a good amount of carbonation and a crisp taste to the finish. A wonderful pale ale."
"KM."
"A fine beer, but drinkability isn't exceptional. Maybe a stylistic choice."
"This beer pours a nice dark amber, with a nice white lace that sticks to the side of the glass. The smell is citrus, hops, and lemons and flavored with a sweetness of honey and the faintest hint of vanilla. The taste is great, it has a nice bitter kick from the hops as well as some great lemon flavor that is brought out by the honey. The mouthfeel on the palate is very clean."
"DA great pale ale with classic pale ale flavors and mild bitterness. Could drink many in one sitting."
"pours with fine wite head and golden amber hue. This is a beautiful everyday drinker. I love pale ales and this is a standard of mine. Spicy malt gives way to a nice cascade hop bite. I highly recommend this for anyone who has not had it. Just grap a clean pint glass and enjoy"
"A good pour results in a soapy head atop a beautiful amber/copper body. Sometimes I just love to look at this one. The smell is unremarkable, only very faint hops present, citrus too faint (considering the orange-y hint in the flavor), but once past the lips this hoppy ale has a satisfying flavor, citrus-y, a pleasing and slightly bitter pinch on the back of the tongue. Refreshing in the mouth (an excellent summer beer) but if it stays too long it gets a bit tart. I drink this as a ""daily beer"" since lots of my favorite stuff is usually too precious to bust out every single day, which is why I've rated the drinkability high. Never gets old. Considering the local choices, I'll take this over mega-brewery headache-beer anyday. (I have to travel at least an hour to get anything beyond the usual Sierra Nevada/Newcastle choices.)"
"Could drink this beer all day and all night.... Sierra Nevada is consistently one of the least appreciated brewers for what they do in my opinion. I feel that people consistently overlook them when comparing them to other great craft brewers simply because of their size. But with brews like this, Celebration, and Bigfoot, they can play ball with anyone."
"Mouth feel is good, rich robust flavors, none of which are overpowering. But the taste and the beer in general is a little heavy. Im not sure Id want to drink more than a couple of these at a session, but for full flavored pale ale, this one is a good choice."
"Very well balanced and drinkable."
"Excellent and will purchase again and again."
"Taste is dry, light-bodied, dry, resinous piney hopswith a crisp finish. Nothing fancy about this beer, just a nice fresh session pale."
"Poured a rich orange-hued amber into a pint glass. Short fizzy head fell quickly to light lacing. Smells of fresh, fruity hops, somewhat citrusy. Taste is slightly masked by heavy carbonation at the start, opens quickly to the hops and sweetly marked of citrus, tastes very fresh, crisp and clean. Mouthfeel is sharp, light, bubbly, finished clean and dry, somewhat like champagne will. Nice and complex blend of citrus and hops, excellent brew, would purchase again, drinkability high, nice introduction to someone new to APA's."
"This is apparently the flavor of the month beer in this area, as I've seen it pop up all the sudden in at least three locations on their rotating taps. Can't say I'm disapointed about this."
"Pours a golden orange color with absolutely no head. Smells of hops, cascade, I think. Strong hop flavor with some munich malt flavor. Somewhat citrusy with a bitter back end. I really taste almost nothing but hops. There's a little tongue scraping from the carbonation/hops. It's drinkable, but I wouldn't drink it every day."
"Drink up!"
"Mouthfeel is a little thin but bolstered by an immediate burst of carbonation. It would be quite quaffable if not for the desire to savour every flavour. A complex and delightful drink."
"Overall a great beer and, IMHO, one of the best session beers. Certainly one you can always fall back on to have a great beer for the night. i can find it almost anywhere, which is a huge plus for when i am at school and these stores pretty much only sell swill. this is a fine american ale."
"One of the classic pale ales in my mind. Its almost a text book example of what a pale should be. The body is great with a good pale and amber malt. The citrus is right in the middle but not over powering. The hops take over in the end to give it an over all great fresh taste to it. The beer taste very fresh and is great in the summer time."
"Overall - An excellent beer.... recommended..."
"Appears golden in colour with a white medium sized head, good head retention and some lacing. Fresh piney, citrusy, leafy, honeyish, nectary and vanilla aroma. Not such an aggressive aroma as anticipated but greater as it warmed a bit. Tastes fresh and hoppy. Some citrusy fruitiness but more tangy, piney and leafy. A hint of caramel like malt underneath, and a long bitter finish. Light to moderate body with low carbonation. Overall this is an excellent refreshing pale ale."
"Conclusion- This is not for me. I think its rather overrated. Though well and carefully made, I think they could have hopped it with something better. I think McSorley's Ale, which is much cheaper, is much better hopped with all sorts of subtle flavors coming through (though its really not that much less bitter, the bitter didn't crowd out the other subtle flavors, so I enjoyed that one anyway). I think the thickness is also kind of excessive. Bear in mind, this isn't billed as an India Pale Ale, or an Extra Bitter, or anything like that. Just a regular Pale Ale. Compare it to Bass, the standard of that type. It's just too thick, dark, and bitter for the type of beer its supposed to be in my opinion. Even though American Pale Ales here are described as ""bitter"" vs British Pale Ales which are ""more balanced"" I think this is too much. That said if you want something that's really powerful, really thick, really bitter, and really well made (notwithstanding my own complaints about style and hops) then by all means check this out. It's a manly brew for sure that will put hair on your chest. Me, I think McSorely's Ale is the best American Ale I've tried. Also, be wary of the price if you're not sure whether you like it. It does run you like $7.50 for a sixpack. If you're skeptical, you might want to split it up with some friends (or if you know a good beer bar you can try it there, me I don't recall any place near me that carries this, even in the bottle)"
"Has a very dark yellow pour with a very obvious piney hop smell. Tastes sweet and fruity but is tempered by the very high quality hops. Great retention of pure white densely bubbled foam. makes for a smooth beer to eat with meal for me because the hops make food taste better. I prefer to eat with a tuna-egg salad sandwich, or any fish."
"**Edit** Had another bottle of this today (1-4-06) and it was hazy with clearly visible yeast that even settled a little at the bottom of the glass. It was more yellow-gold colored too. Very strange. Tasted about the same though."
"Drinkability: Very consumable; not filling, well-balanced, and a good taste. Tends to leave a sticky, stale aftertaste that is not altogether pleasant though. Could pass for a decent session beer."
"Plain and simply a true american classic, and one of my favorites. If you havent tried it yet, I dont know what the hell you're waiting for!"
" It is a good beer that I will be coming back to, that is if my Dad hasn't already drank it all."
"Technically this is a good pale ale and I could enjoy a few in a row but I have not yet acquired the taste for pale ales as a session beer and feel that ending a night on one, including a Sierra Nevada, is like ending a song off key and leaving the audience unsatisfied."
"This is one of the best beers of its style and any time that I try an American Pale Ale, I always compare it to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Whenever I do this I notice that none of them are as good as this drink here."
"Overall: Celebration is head over heels better. I can't really drink this brew anymore."
"This beer pours a golden/orange amber color has a two finger frothy white head, OK retention and moderate lacing. The aroma is of citrusy hops and baked bread. The taste is just what you would want from a Pale Ale citrus/floral hops and pale malt perfectly balanced. This is one of the most drinkable beers out today."
"It's hard to go wrong with this one, folks. Not perfect, by any stretch, but good for having just one or several, and a good balance of flavours."
"Notes: One of the first craft beers I ever had, and while that night I was turned away, I've grown to love this beer, a great introduction to a great style."
"D- Extremely drinkable!"
"A light brown color with a golden hue that has an off-white colored head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of grapefruit, pine, and hops seem to come out. The taste is typical for this style with a mildly astringent mouthfeel due to the hop bitterness. Nothing about this beer is overpowering which makes for a very good session beer or a relaxing beer. Good example of the style; perhaps a bit too sweet in the finish. A solid beer that is readily available in many areas."
"It is also good for introducing people to what ""pale ale"" is about."
"Notes: I heard a lot of good things about this beer so I went and picked up a 12 pack. Boy am I glad I did."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is refreshing, vibrant, alive. Extremely recommended and fortunately available in almost as many places as Samuel Adams."
"D: This is a pretty easy to drink brew. Could definitely fit this into the regular rotation when not drinking Belgians."
"A great value. They sell twelve packs of this stuff for the same price as Corona or Amstel which aren't even in the same category as Sierra's Pale Ale. Enjoy."
"drinkability: webster defines session beer as SNPA"
"¡Salud!"
"Golden amber with a creamy white head, lacing is somewhat sticky. Upfront hop aroma, floral, citric, etc. Great cascade hop wave at first with nice biscuity malt finish. Medium-bodied and satisfying mouthfeel. Absolutely incredible drinkability. I avoided this one for a while due to it's ubiquity. However, I would now advocate this beer any day of the week. Excellent pale ale."
"mouthfeel is light and the hop bite is very pleasant. extremely drinkable brew, i just love this one. i'm a big fan of good pales or india pales with a strong hop presence and this is one of the old stand-bys."
"Pours a dark, orangy straw colour with a nice foamy slightly offwhite head. Sharp hops in nose also with some grainy aspects as well. Smooth taste rolls down the throat with some nice hop bitterness on back of the palatte. Slighlty metallic aftertastes linger long after you swallow. Overall an excellent APA. Not a huge beer by any means, but definately worthwhile."
"Very smooth mouthfeel, almost buttery with just a touch of lemon. The right amount of hops counterbalances a wonderful base almost perfectly. Slight amount of haze even a few minutes after the pour from the yeast that was on the bottom of the bottle. Very simple, and yet very complex at the same time. Smooth, hoppy, and a flagship for pale ales. Simply amazing!"
"Sierra Nevada is one of my favorite micro brews. They have obviously become the standard to which a lot of people / brewers compare themselves. I think the S-N I get here is not as good as 5 years ago. Still a great beer, just does not have the hop aroma and flavor it used to and seems a bit thinner."
"Hops? Sierra Nevada has them. Granted this and the bigfoot ale are the only two from these guys I ever drank, but they are hoppy. But not overly hoppy to being undrinkable. Very nice flavor and mouthfeel, nice finish, and a real enjoyable beer. My local grocer had it on sale for $6.99 a sixer and it's been a while since I had it. Very nice!!"
"D-Although not overly complex, this is nicely balanced. A great all-purpose, highly quaffable ale."
"Overall this is a great stand-by beer. If you can find it in the wasteland of beer that exists below the Mason-Dixon line, I advise you drink it."
"This is not a bad beer, but for the price and the brewer's reputation I'd like to see a more individual taste. I hate to to mention it but I wonder if Sierra Nevada is still at the top of their game.."
"This is very drinkable but a few will do for a night."
"Pours a lovely burnished copper, pushing up a modest dense white head, that leaves moderate lacing. Nice fruity hops, think grapefruit, in the nose and some slight roasty malt as well. Nice and hoppy in the mouth, grapefruit and other citrus in the finish, with touches of malt. This is a wonderful beer and well representative for the style. Thoroughly enjoyable and a good session beer."
"Pours dark copper. This one had a nice meak one-finger head. Sandy but everlasting lacing. Lemony citrus up front with some balanced carbonation and hops. Taste wasn't stunning but still good. Mouthfeel is comfortable and I have a feeling this one is quaffable, though I savored mine. Won't go out of my way for this one, but definitely won't turn it down."
"The taste is very strong of hops and a mild alchohol aftertaste. Not a beer I could personally session, your mileage may vary, especially if you like a very hopped beer."
"D: Suitable for a wide range of beer drinkers."
"."
"There is something restrained about this beer,the expectation of a more varied finish is not there , but I think this makes this very drinkableand would be a fantastic beer to sit down and get right into a whole lot of it."
"Drinkability: great session beer."
"Pours a nice copper color with a thin head that dissipates quickly. Not lacing to speak of. Smell of piney hop oils with a hint of malty sweetness. Taste has just enough piney hops to give it a little bite but is not overpowering. Nice malt balance with a bitter aftertaste that is enjoyable. Just a very nice smooth pale ale that goes down incredible easy. Don't know why i haven't had this one in so long but i will be sure to not let that happen again."
"A classic for it's kind, and what I call the ""gateway beer."" It's a one of the few microbews available in most bars on-tap, usually sandwitched between two major macros. If you can get your BCM friends to try it, they will probably like it. And if they do like it, they may enter the gates of micro-heaven and never go back!"
"This is a must try, no matter what your tastes are! (This is as much because of the taste as it is because of the noteriety)."
"Drinkability: Certainly a widely available beer on tap around the U.S., I think at least. Worth a shot, since some say this is one of the best pale ales made. Though I'm slightly inclined to disagree, I do think it's a widely available beer that I'm thankful is widely available."
"Delicious."
"notes: i honestly would just skip this and go straight to Anchor Liberty Ale. it's much better."
"D - Many things factor in its high drinkability, being ABV, ease of drinking and frankly cost. At maybe $6 a six pack that is a great beer when you want to watch a game with the guys, but still drink a good beer."
"I would definitely recommend this beer and in my opinion it takes second place in the APA category only to Four Peaks Hopknot Pale Ale."
"My absolute standard. Best price flavor and consistant quality. This beer is great on tap or in the bottle everytime. This beer is the baseline I use to compare all other pale ales. I would put Dogfish higher on my list but the price makes a big difference."
"I am very happy this beer is readily available and moderately priced in the NE area. Its always a good 'I don't know what I want beer," especially in spring and summer."
"A full coppery color,but the head was a little small and disapears a little too fast.The taste is a little weak at first,but once the spices,hops,and barley hit all of your tongue you will enjoy this ale.This is a good ale for parties and tailgating,not too dark or light.This isn't the best ale I ever tried,but it's pretty good."
"350 ml bottle, bought in Denmark. Deep golden / amber colour, slightly hazy, large head. Pleasant hoppy aroma with strong fruity notes (citrus, raisins, prunes). Hoppy flavour on a decent malty base, notes of fruits (grapefruit, raisins) and spices. Its easy to understand why this beer has become part of the staple diet of many American beer afficionados"
"Medium bodied, very nice yeasty malt flavor dominated by the grapefruit/pine hops. Very definite and very pleasant hops finish and aftertaste. Should go well with most food."
"I love this beer; excellent both in both in bottles and on-tap."
"APA lovers - It just don't get much better than this folks. Beautiful golden amber color with a nice fluffy head. Wonderful piney, citrusy grapefruit aroma. Taste is much lighter than you would expect from a dark beer. Well balanced between the biscuity malts and the sharp hop bite. A true American classic."
"D - Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is easy to drink, pairs well with most foods and works fabulously as a session beer."
"Drinkability: at 5.6%, it is not exactly a session beer, but it goes down very easy."
"Drinkability: This would be an excellent session beer; I could drink it all day, even with all the hop flavor I'm picking up, due to the fact that the hops enhance the experience, rather than pummelling the tastebuds."
"A great all around drinkable beer. Great with food or by itself."
"Very drinkable -- an all-around great beer. I see why this is such a staple of the beer drinking world. APAs may not be my favorite, but within the style this is hard to beat."
"A refreshing brew with light body and light carbonation. Very drinkable, not outstanding for any reason, but good."
"Opinion: This beer is a staple of any American beer aficionados diet. It is pretty readily available, and tastes good. This makes it common at beer gatherings. The beer overall is really drinkable, even if you aren't a hophead like myself. Here in Houston, it goes great with some BBQ at the local park."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer."
"What a great beer. This is a perfect example of what a Pale Ale should be. It does not have all the characteristics that I truly enjoy, but its balance is so good its incredible. The perfect amount of hops, followed by a fruity, but not over powering body, finished by a slight pine ending. Tops in its class."
"Next time fishing with the old man, i'm taking some of these along. He'll appreciate it after the last outing with a halfer of Pabst."
"Nose is malty and a bit yeasty with some nice floral hops coming through. Pours a wonderful amber with a medium white foamy head. Aroma and appearance combine to make this a most enticing libation. First sip starts with some pleasant sweet maltiness and finishes with enough lingering hop spicy bitterness to balance it out. Medium to full bodied for a pale ale and coats the mouth nicely. This is a very enjoyable beer and I'm glad it's becoming so widely available."
"I tend to like hoppy beers as opposed to less hoppy beers so this is a great example of what a pale ale should be. It is pale; actually a light to medium amber color. It has a perfect hop aroma and taste balance. One can definitely feel the small bite of the hop bitterness which i absolutely love. A very drinkable beer anytime of the year and on any occasion. I personally prefer drinking this beer with a bacon chesse chicken sandwich and fries while watching any kind of sporting event, preferable college football. A great beer to keep in the fridge all the time (which is what I do)."
"One of my favorite beers of all time, it is so versatile, and pairs well with a wide variety of foods. Can be enjoyed by itself, either in a pub with a large crowd of people, or as an after work relaxant. The amount of hop bitterness turns off some people though."
"Pours a slightly hazed amber with a modest head that recedes to leave a nice lacing that lasts through the glass. Mild but slightly raw hop aroma. Flavor is highly hopped, floral with citric overtones. Hop bitterness is definitely up there, but a nice doughy malt backbone keeps it all together. Super smooth mouthfeel, and easily drinkable. Being one of the very few truly well known craft beers, it commands respect from American BAs."
"This is what run of the mill pale ales should be imitating. Good stuff!"
" Again, a good drinkable stand-by micro. Kinda like seeing a friendly face in a crowd of macro strangers."
"Poured a bright golden orange haze with a little white head that tended to cling to the glass. Smelled of very strong hops, some floral notes, and some citric scents aswell. Tasted nice creamy and smooth with a very mild malty crispness. I found it a little on the bitter hop side but in an enjoyable way. I really enjoyed this beer and ended up buy another round of it. So i would definatly reccomend this beer."
"I do recall now having the Sierra Nevada comped on my stay at Bally's in Vegas, which was a plus."
"Kind of like the drunken irishman that will beat the hell out of the frat boy that gets out of line."
"The beer was medium-bodied and drinkable, and altogether, an American classic."
"This beer is all over the place today. Creamy but grainy, flavorful but plain, smooth but cloying. Maybe this is a bad one, but there's some saving grace due to it being a style that can handle adversity--it does."
"I do find it better on-tap, though. I had one at Ted's Buffalo Grill in Nashville, and found the quality much-improved over the bottled variety. Unfortunately I've never found a place in Alabama that serves it on-tap, so I am unable to test this hypothesis in a reasonable manner."
"Hops very apparent at first with bitter taste. As beer began to warm a malty taste kicked in that balanced out the beer nicely. Medium body that goes down smooth. This is a very drinkable APA and one of my favorites that is readily available."
"Pours yellow golden from a 24 fluid ounce bottle. Aroma is of piney hops with with some sweetness. Head develops into 1 head and then goes away within a minute or two. Sip reveals a piney hops flavor with some bitterness if held in the mouth for a while. Hops seems to dominate here. A very solid beer that you can find in many run of the mill places. Not citrusy hops flavor. Still a pale ale without running into the IPA category. Some slight sweetness too."
"Appearance is a cloudy orange with white foam and clinging lace. Aroma is floral hops, green leaves and lemon blossoms. There are some barley and malt notes, too. Initial taste caresses the tongue with silky smooth crackers and malt, balanced by dry hoppiness. Ethanol fumes work through the sweet grapefruit hops and brown sugar. Good beer!"
"Taste is the best part of this beer, can get a bit musky, cardboard in the nose but the hops eventually kick its ass. I find this beer highly drinkable at 5.9%abv and a taste that doesnt make you want to switch beers..."
"Drinkability: I love drinking this beer. It has never failed me. A great standard for the American Pale Ale. It is a wonderful everyday beer for myself."
"wow. it's been a while since i had one of these and i forgot how much i liked them. a healthy 2 finger head that retains well. best i can describe the color is a hazy orangey gold. good lacing too. at first, the smell is primarily of hops and citrus, but as this delight warms a little, i pick up a toasted grain smell. the taste hits the tounge bitter and hoppy but finishes with a nice and balanced sweet malt flavor. this is the kind of beer to buy by the case. i have yet to meet someone who doesn't like this beer. (except my girlfriend who says all beer tastes the same) some of the other sierra nevada stuff is a little hoppy for my liking, but this one is scrumtrulecently balanced."
"As APA's go, this has to be one of the best out there. Assertive, but not IPA-like, 5.6% ABV, a great representation of the style."
"Golden with a tinge of amber. Hoppy aromas of grass and mild citrus. Some grainy malt flavors combine with notes of citrus hops and white grape skin. Assertive, but not overpowering black peppery bitterness. Not watery, but surprisingly muted. This would probably make a good session beer, but I've had a few more interesting APAs than this one."
"Great taste, HIGH drinkability, decent ABV, widespread availability and reasonable sticker price make this one a winner on all fronts."
"Nice copper to amber color, very clear with a thick off-white head. It had an aroma of grapefruit rind (very pronounced), and a more subtle hop flower and grass aroma backed by mild caramel on the finish. The taste has the citrus/hop up front with the hop flower coming across subtly. The caramel is very light on the finish. Very smooth, and light mouth feel, very drinkable. This is another beer that began the journey for me to advocacy. It will always be a standard I measure other APAs against."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and easy to drink. I can't wait to have a few of these on my porch on a nice day."
"Drinkability: Fantastic session beer here. I like to factor cost into the drinkability equation sometimes, and SNPA comes out a winner for that reason alone."
"I love Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It was the first craft brew I ever had, at the tender age of 16. At the time it was a bit much, but I liked it. It took me a few years before I really discovered the style. Its still good, fortunately (8 years later), and more readily available. This is my benchmark for American Pale Ales, and I'm sure I'm not alone."
"THE session beer to end all session beers. You can find it anywhere, it tastes great, and it goes down like water."
"I really like SNBC's beers, but this one didn't do anything for me. Poured out to a golden color with decent carbonation. Odors of spices were most present, and were slightly overpowering. Taste was complex, as i'm sure that's what they were going for. Flavors of bitterness, floral notes and hops were present. Finished with a smooth, yet strong bitter aftertaste. In no way a bad beer, but i've had better APA's. Still worth a try."
"Overall: I was left feeling cheated when I poured it with no head. Although it is much stronger tasteing to me, I am beginning to realize what everyone wants in a beer. The beer is of exceptional quality."
"Overall: the American Pale Ale. I find myself really enjoying this beer's balance after getting tired of the extreme IPAs."
"Well decided to buy some again, got introduce to it back around 97 in CA, one of the first micro's I've had. I've always liked the Pale Ale over the Stout and Porter. The color is golden brown and a mild taste. Goes down very easy with a great after taste. This has always been one of my favorites (Pale Ale). Highly recommended."
"I can see why this beer is so popular. An obvious choice for a sessional brew, this beer goes back nice and smooth. Basically the standard by which a good Pale Ale should be compared, this is a good, but not great, beer."
"Sierra Pale Ale is what I consider a great beer for those lazy afternoons lounging around the house. The pleasant aroma with hints of yeast and hops are pleasing. The quality of the beer is very apparent and it is obvious the care is put into this drink. That has always been the lasting characteristic of this beer is freshness and quality. It is a beer that I know I can reach for at anytime and throughly enjoy."
"Impression: Absolutely refreshing, a bold and exciting beer. One that can be drank from sun-up to sun-down and any time of the year. One to stock the fridge with."
"edit: trying to calibrate my scores, having trouble keeping it all internally consistent"
"NOTE: If you have tried this beer and didn't like it, give it another chance already! Sierra Nevada distributes aggressively and is botttle conditioned, and some unworthy distributers and retailers(gas stations, supermarkets, etc.) sometimes store it warm for long periods of time. I've gotten a couple of brews that were quite...well....lets just say they had seen better days. So pick it up at a reputable retailer or try it on tap, I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
" This is a standard among American Pale Ales and I always enjoy it. In fact I have not had a bad Sierra Nevada brew. If you haven't had it , have it. If you haven't had it in a while, go get some. Good session stuff!"
"Pours a pale amber color with a small white head that dissapates quickly. Smell is floral, piney hops with a grainy malt background. Taste is very similar to the smell with a floral and resiny hops taste that gives way to a grainy, bready malt flavor and ends in a dry, slightly bitter finish. Overall a pretty standard pale ale, but nonetheless an original as it was one of the first craft beers to become widely available."
"Sierra Nevada is a nice old familiar beer that is thankfully found at many a restaurant serving mainstream swill. Pours a lovely amber with a thick finger and a half of head and good lacing. Smells of citric and piney hops with a definite malt presence behind. Flavor is close to the nose, with grapefruit and lemons coming through and a strong malt backbone. Simple, but good. The mouthfeel is on the ligght medium side and the medium carbonation is just right on the tongue. Overall this is a solid pale ale that is widely available and I always drink when there are no better micros present."
"all i can say is its a pity you cant just head down your local in australia and pick this up whenever you like, coz its a pearler of a brew"
"Pours a clear golden hue, with a fine bead of carbonation and a fantastic, assertive, citric aroma that comes with a hint of grassiness. A carbonic bite, then smooth smooth bready malt flavors accented by grapefruity hops, followed by a clean bitterness that has me wanting more of the stuff. This is a classic, quenching pale ale with just the right amount of bitterness. The wonderfully hoppy character of this beer come out more when just slightly chilled. The bottle I'm having now is probably just a bit too chilly, but the previous bottle was just perfect. This is an old favorite and possibly my #1 summer beer."
"Would I buy it again? Heck yeah!"
"A classic of the style and one that is a much welcomed fallback when the only other choices are macros or skunky imports."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is appropriate for all seasons as it is heavily hopped and malty enough to stand up to a hearty meal, though fresh and crisp enough to accompany your picnic or ballgame. Medium carmel color and a tamed head make this pale ale a charming pint, indeed."
" I remember there was a time when the sight of the green SNPA tap handle at a pub was enough to excite me, I guess those days are long past. I'll choose to remember this beer from past experiences, which were always good. This is one of the beers that has lead us ALL down the path of beer rightiousness. Although our palates have grown, we should all give this beer it's due and proper."
"Served on tap. Medium amber color, head quickly disappeared. No lacing on the glass. Smelled slightly malty to me. Taste was very good. I liked the bite on the tip on my tongue, and very nice bitterness on the back. Kinda like grapefruit. Very ful feeling in my mouth. Great drinkability! I'll buy again."
"This was one of my favorite beers years ago, but it has been a long time, The beer is darker than I remember with a copper amber color and lots of carbonation. Hop aroma is strong with a faint smell of fresh lettuce? Taste is of that typical Sierra Nevada malted barley, a strong hop flavor for an APA and orange rind which I don't remember from the past. Taste is good with a little bit of bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and easily drinkable. A true classic APA in my opinion."
"A very respectable APA."
"Red gold body with a 1"" white head. Honeyish malt with very mild spice in the nose. The flavor has smooth malt at the start followed by an excellent balance of hops towards the end. The hops come across better with more sips. Gotta love the balance, nothing is overstated. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, very carbonated and it has a refreshing effect. I wonder about the drinkability.. while it would be great to have one or two, and they would be a very drinkable one or two.. having much more than that would be over doing it for me."
"poured a bright orange color with robust head that reduced to minimal white lacing. Has a nice hoppy smell without being overpowering. The taste has a pleasant hoppiness that fells great in the mouth. leaves a nice dryness that makes me want more. A very drinkable pale ale that would be a good session beer"
"I was very happy when I first seen this beer make it to my store shelves. This beer IMO sets the the standard for all other pale ales. You can review my complete and detailed review of this beer at: http://pilgrims-pub.blogspot.com/2007/12/tasting-notes.html"
"It's just that easy to drink. Simple, yet elegant. It's nice to know there will always beer a beer like this to fall back on."
"light bodied, crisp and refreshing"
"A very drinkable beer. I had a couple with dinner and I think a couple more are on deck for the evening at least."
"Drinkability: I believe this is the first 5 I have ever given. Just a perfect beer to drink. I was wrong in a previous review. This is the APA by which to judge all other APA's. Helping this beer out is that it is available practically all over (I have seen it in gas stations) . Purchased a six for $5.99, practically a steal."
"This is the standard Pale Ale I suppose"
"One of my favorites. w00t!"
"SNPA pours a copper color with a light white head and has a nice, faint citrus aroma. Tipping back the bottle and taking a sip, I find a nice, crisp bite, and while the flavor is good, it's not remarkable. I've had better, I've had worse... good, not great. It's a tasty brew and I'd certainly be willing to buy more, but this just isn't a standout in my book."
"A decent pale ale, nothing too special here. Pours a dark golden translucence with a large head. Very hoppy smelling, with notes of pine and citrus. Taste is actually quite bitter, much like an I.P.A. All in all, a good session brew and an one of my favorite choices when I have to shop at the grocery store and can't make it to my local bottle shop."
"So what up-makes this APA? The answer seems obvious; all them west coast hops. That's the flavor, primarily, and the malt could only get in the way if it were to present itself any more strongly. We don't want any of those stinky esthery sweet flavors coming through to ruin our nice green, resiny American hop experience."
"Drinkability: Great I drank three pints and it did not leave me bloated like other ""filling"" beers. Bring another!"
"It goes down smooth, both when drank slowly and quickly. Highly recommended, and Im looking forward to trying other Sierra Nevada beers."
"My choice of beer when at a bar with mostly a commercial beer selection, perfect session beer."
"This pale ale poured a clear, amber color with white foam that clung to the glass. The smell was a very nice, floral hops aroma with some maltiness poking through the hops. The taste was malty but with a very large dose of flowery, floral hops and bitter hops especially in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and very pleasing to the palate. The body was medium with moderate carbonation feel. The fruity and floral hops lingered in the finish. This is a very, very nice pale ale, and one can see why it is considered a classic in the American Pale Ale style. I can't believe it took me this long to get around to reviewing it. I am going to have to remember to drink this one more often, or at least whenever I see it on tap."
"On tap at a local wing joint. Almost as tasty as from the bottle, but I feel like the hops don't show up quite as well on tap. Still very drinkable, quite crisp and refreshing, and leaps and bounds better than most of the taps at typical bars in SoCal"
"A very drinkable brew that ,IMHO, sets the bar for west coast PAs. If you like Liberty Ale or Two Hearted, give this one a try."
"Very clear amber colour topped by a thin lace of white head. Moderate retention and stickage. The aroma consists of floral, citrus and spicy hops with a bit of biscuit and grain. The flavour is balanced on the hoppy, bitter side. Mild sweetness with some maltiness, but mostly citrus and spicy hops with a dominating bitterness. Dry finish with a firm bitterness. Medium body and carbonation. Slightly crisp and acidic from the carbonation, but without having a coarse texture. This is a great session beer -- clean and full of flavour."
"Nothing shabby about this beer, a great example of an APA, and one I look forward to having again, regardless of the time of year."
"Not as interesting or shocking a beer as it was 15 years ago, back when many of us had never had an American beer that was decent tasting, but it's still an emminently drinkable beer and an excellent session PA."
"Nose is delicate; having a lot of hoparome that's mostly citrussy, some maltnotes and a nice yeastesterpallet mixed beautifully together. Taste is very smotth but still fresh; malts( pils and munich), litle sweetish before going into that citrussytaste and aftertaste again. Mouthfeel is great; probably as good as it was fresh but cause of the age( exp date 31-01-05) is freed from any edges( if there ever were...). Drinkability is good, only negatively influenced by the enormous price of 4 eur for a 350 ml botle."
"Keep these around for session they are a sure hit!"
"Nice APA, but honestly, this is a pretty standard brew within the constraints of the style, very drinkable however."
"This ale is a light amber color with a white, dense, mostly diminishing head with little lacing early. The aroma is more malty than I remembered, but still very nice. Its also a bit piney and citrusy. The taste is marvelous! A wonderful balance of bready maltiness and bittering hops. The hops are noticeable right off the bat but still rather mellow, but the bitterness picks up a bit toward the finish. And theres a slightly grapey taste in there. The finish is crisp, medium in length, but just so damned easy-drinking! I think its sweeter on tap than from bottle. One of the most refreshing beers out there. I highly recommend it!"
"Drinkability: Tough on the senses. The hops are too much for me. I had to rate it a little above average because it has a respectable power and bite."
"Had this before, of course, but never *rated* it. Read a lot of other reviews, kinda surprised by my appraisal of it: Perfect amber orange pour, head and lacing somewhat poor (old beer?). Many people wrote of the hop intensity, but I didnt notice that much  my notes say a lite hop tang with nice dry aftertaste. Lite & spicy thoughout. Very good overall taste  will have to find it on tap and have another glass (or two)."
"The hops are stinging when you first drink the brew, almost as if the beer is too cold and it is chilling your tongue. There is a very smooth, creamy, and bread laden malt undertone that holds up well. The hops tip the balance scale on the back end of the flavor profile. Citric floral hops finish, giving a slightly acidic and dry feeling. Very well crafted and worth a few. This beer is the standard of all other APA brews that have followed."
"Had this many times, but never reviewed it. Here goes. It pours an orange/amber color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is filled with American hops - citrus and grass. Not much else. The flavor has a nice caramel backing and then follows with the citrus hops. This is a solid APA. Nothing wrong at all. Drinkability is good."
"I've enjoyed this beer from the bottle many a time in the past, but I finally decided to order it on tap at my favorite bar earlier tonight. This is a stunning APA out of the bottle, but out of the tap it's frickin' exceptional. It pours to a clear amber color with a medium frothy white head that stays for most of the pint. The smell seemed somewhat subdued, though I have somewhat of a nasal cold. This didn't kill my judgement, however, as I could still smell the wonderfull citrusy/hop smell. Also, the retro-olfaction was actually improved somewhat, as the odors seemed to get caught up in all the mucuous from the cold. I will definately be revisiting this from the tap wherever available, particularly if there is nothing new to try (though the bar I had this at, the Sanctuary, still has quite an enourmous selection of beers that I haven't tried.) And like always, I could drink SNPA all night, from tap OR bottle."
"12 oz., bottle conditioned with no freshness date. Pours a golden orange into the imperial pint glass with a 3 finger head that leaves some lacing and a thin blanket of foam. Couldn't resist pouring the yeast into the glass. Has a floral/metallic/grassy/citrus smell. Flavors are a hop spiciness up front with a lasting bitterness. Some floral/citrus notes (lemon?) and grains with the malts getting more pronounced as it warms, along with a bit of yeast. The carbonation is crisp at first but becomes smooth. Easy to drink. Overall a good pale ale with a wide enough distribution that you can always rely on it to satisfy your hop craving."
"Ugghhh. Sierra Nevada makes some damn fine beers (Bigfoot is still my all time favorite beer), but I'll pass on this one from now on."
"This pours pale (as expected), with a thin head if you're light on the pour. The taste is a bit over-citrusy for my tastes, and I much prefer the SN porter and stout to this, but it still holds its own. The smell is rather nondescript, although it hints to the taste. This is a better compliment to lighter foods than the porter or stout are, and it's the only SN available at the Albertson's which is close to me (the closest liquor store is 45 minutes away, but I still catch it on the way back from university), so I keep coming back to it. A sometimes thin, sometimes thick (depending on age I suspect) layer of sediment dwells on the bottom due to bottle conditioning, which encourages a light pour. Enjoyable, but certainly not the best SN offering."
"Ahh, the classic pale ale. The taste of this brings back good memories. This beer goes so well with any meal, especially pizza. Mmm. Anything by Sierra Nevada is always welcome in my pint glass."
"I must say this is one of my favorite beers. Has a very hazy orange color to it. You can see the particals of yeast from the bottle conditioning. The head is fairly large and settles to a sticky lace around the glass. Smells hoppy with a little grain. Bitter spice, citrus,malts, and pine dominate the flavor. A very drinkable pale ale! I think it is the perfect session beer! In my opinion, Sierra Nevada Pale ale is truely a classic American beer!"
"Sierra Nevada's flagship...and a good one at that. This should be the standard by which other APA's are judged. This is the lay of the land. Someone order the pizza."
"Nice golden brew which while it has a dissapointing head, the lacing is quite nice. The smell is strong and carries through the classic ale aromas, hops dominating them all. On tasting the first impression is sharply that of the hops, which slowly blends to a vanilla creamy sweetness with a very even mouth feel. The after taste is a twang of sharp hops tempered by smooth cream. All over a very drinkable ale. The level of hops may put off some people but it is very well rounded and masterfully crafted. A good beer drinkers beer, great for sharing with your friends, and a good introduction to master crafted ales."
"Clear, color is a light reddish-golden (on tap it seems darker to me though). The head is white and dissipates a bit rapidly. The aroma is clean with a bit of maltiness and a nice citrusy hop smell. The flavor is crisp, clean, with a slightly sweet malty base followed by a piney, resinous hop note and a solid bitterness. Several years ago this was the hoppiest beer I had regularly; since then its hoppiness has been surpassed by others, but I don't think any beer is as well balanced and compliemented as this one. This is a great beer and delicious."
"Half of my homebrews are APA style because I liked it so much. SN APA is one of the reasons why. I love the floral cascade hops (and plenty of them)."
" Tasty and quaffable, Classic, if not The Origional, American Pale Ale. I seem to remember liking this more 5+ years ago tho...have I changed...? ....or the beer? Possibly both."
"Bitter and sweet blend perfectly and then comes the somewhat prickly alcohol and a large bitterness in the aftetaste together with spicy traces."
"Goddamn. I'm damned impressed with SNPA this time around. For about the past two years I've only had it as my ""fallback beer"" when at restaurants, and it's usually been served way too cold, usually in one of those frosted tulip-pilsner glasses. Drinking it now, at the proper temperature (so that I can actually *taste* it) it's way more nuanced than I'd thought. When ice cold, all that I was able to taste were prominent, citrus hops. Now that it's warmed up, I can taste the depth of bready malt, and the hops seem to be in perfect, complimenting balance. This beer must've blow people's minds when it hit the market back in the 80s..."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a classic APA that stands the taste of time. Simple and solid. Nothing unique but still a great session brew."
"I love Chico, a fun school and a awesome beer. This beer can be found almost anywhere, and it never fails to come correct. It is much better on tap, on tap I would have given it all 5s. Lets get to the beer, pours a nice amber color, the nose is complex, pretty hoppy. The mouthfeel is great hoppy and spicy taste. Cannot go wrong with this beer. This beer will be around for a long time. I really like it with spicy food and pizza."
"The taste was great, very well balanced with a good bitterness that hits you and then slowly fades into some maltiness, with a possible hint of citrus. The smoothness and body of this beer is incredible, and it has a very light carbonation, all making for a beer that could be enjoyed for hours."
"This beer poured a dark gold amber into the glass, leaving a decent-sized head. It smelled hoppy, but it wasn't totally overpowering. The taste was smooth and crisp, leaving a slight aftertaste that disappeared quickly. After the initial hop hit on the tongue, subsequent sips proved pretty refreshing. It felt somewhat bitter on my tongue, but the bitterness contributed to the compexity of the flavors I was tasting. I don't know if I would drink many of these in succession, but this was a good dinner beer. I had it with somewhat spicy food, and it went pretty well. It would be interesting to try it with salads, or other types of entrees."
"Very fresh tasting, but with a disappointingly one-dimensional flavor profile. Lots of tasty grapefruit hop flavor, but no malts or additional complexity in sight. This sample just didn't measure up to the bottled versions I've had."
"Big white head with good retention. Leaves me with strong lace. The light with a mix of grain and hops. Mmmm... balance, I like balance in my pale ales. Expecially in something I will be drinking alot of. Which this one is good for. Easy on the carbonation and about as drinkable as it gets."
"Final Thought: It's been over two years since I drank a SNPA but I am glad I refounded this relationship that will continue for quite some time."
"This nice beer pours a copper colour, with a not so big head. The head reduces slowly leaving just a ring of foam. It has a fruity and hoppy smell with some hints of malt. Quite strong in carbonation, but it is balanced. The taste is malty and smooth and you can feel lots of fruity hops in the aftertaste. You also get alot of bitterness in the after taste. A really nice pale ale that i also have tasted on tap."
"This is the gold standard for American Pale Ales and a very drinkable beer. It's one of the best mass-market beers out there and can please beer geeks and beer newbies."
"Drinkability: Fairly cheap and widely available. A staple of the APA style and one of my favorite beers to have on-tap in the area, since most of them have it. You could drink this all night long if you wanted to...and you'd enjoy it."
"A nice micro pale ale from a not-so-micro American brewer. On the whole, one may call this a nice beer."
"Notes: What can I say about this beer? It's the beer that brought me into the realm of Beer Advocacy. This is the gateway drug of good beer. Furthermore, it's an incredible fall-back beer. If you're at a a moderate to nice bar in California, chances are they have this beer in bottles, so even if they fail to have anything incredible, you can usually get this beer. It's akin to having to drive your Cadillac while your Mercedes is in the shop."
"This is a great fallback here where I live. It can be found no matter where you are. This beer was my first introduction to hops."
"Drinkability- For some reason I get worn out on this beer when I drink it too often. For me it's maybe a 12 pack a year. A great pale ale, but one to be consumed only on occasion for me. A good pick though."
"While it doesn't live up to expectations, this beer will always hold a special place with me and warrant the occasional purchase. It's decently balanced and a good transition to the wonderful world of American Pale Ales. Although I don't live there now, when I first started drinking this beer, I lived in Northern California. I have to wonder if freshness has a lot to do with the perceived drop-off in quality in this review."
"Beer pours a light amber that is something slightly less than brillantly clear. White head sits on top. Smell is of citrusy hops. Taste of beer is of Cascade hops with a slight malt background, finish is all hops. Slight hint of mineraly water. Very drinkable and smooth beer with a nice body. Definatley a session beer."
"Great beer, although I have to admit I expected a little more when I heard this was the prototypical APA. I guess I was expected the best APA ever, but I've had a few I liked better. Taste is nicely hopped, very full and complete. Citric hop tastes finish the sip appropriately. This is a perfect beer for slow sipping at a bar or at home, thankfully this is available almost everywhere. I have nothing more to add that hasn't been said numerous times already."
"It has a pleasant, hoppy/fruity/malty aroma that screams drink me. It's flavor is very much balanced between a hoppy bite and a malty sweetness, if a bit thin for a pale ale. It has a smooth creamy finish that makes this beer extremely drinkable. Not a bad beer at all and it makes for a nice session beer."
"A highly drinkable Pale at 5.6% abv. A safety beer you can find everywhere and drink all night. Never a let down."
"Drinkability is nice, but I've never gone totally nuts for it, quenches thirst very well and takes the edge off if I need a good hop fix though. Overall a nice beer that is a good fallback for me if I can't find anything else."
"Sampled at the Sophisticated Otter in Johnson City, TN, my SNPA came out a clear slightly reddish gold under a very thin white head that lingered well and left very good lace. Subdued flowery hops greet the nose, while the mouth is met by a very pricky medium-bodied sensation. Smooth malt contends with distinctive flowery hoppiness right from the start, with the hops winning out in the end. There's a very nice bite in the finish, followed by a good lingering bitterness. There's a reason why this is a solid stand-by brew. Can't go wrong here."
" Very nicely done. Tastes just as good today as it did some twenty plus years ago."
"Think about it -- you hopheads are spoiled and your tastebuds are burned out. SNPA is the king of pale ales. If you want to convert a macro drinker, start here."
"Taste is very nice, Crisp and Clean with a mix of some fruity maltiness followed by a very nice classic hoppiness, Goes down smooth and has a nice creamy mouthfeel and has excellent drinkability. A classic that still taste as good now as the first time I ever had it. Overall a great Pale Ale."
"This is a solid beer. Actually it seems to serve sometimes as a crossover beer; it's widely available, a lot of people know about it, but yet it's very good, unlike a lot of popular brews. Appears a vibrant orangy amber color with a typical head and lacing for a pale ale. Fruity hops abound in the nose. Taste is of course hoppy, which is good. A bit citrusy and tangy, but what makes this beer great is that there's an excellent balance of sweet malts in there as well. Feels smooth and creamy, a super-easy beer to drink. Bueno."
"Taste was citrus, tangy and reminiscent of mangos. Very sweet but balanced with a good amount of hop bitterness. Left an astringent feel on the palate in a good way. Very tasty. A classic APA. Finishes dry. Smooth, moderate mouthfeel. Quaffable as hell."
"Edit: I'm downgrading this one to all 4s, not because it's not a good beer, but because there's a specific taste in there that I don't quite like. Perhaps it's metallic, but it detracts a bit from the overall drinkability."
"The color is a nice amber, with a medium, off-white head that stays for awhile and leaves good lacing down the glass. Light hop smell, bitter, yet offset well by the malts, a smooth citrusy taste that's well balanced and refreshing. Yeah, it doesn't pack a lot of punch, but it's not supposed to. You could certainly argue that ""it's not as good as it used to be"" but it's still a really good, really drinkable beer, especially since you can find one just about anywhere these days - considering that the 'default tap' at many bars is Budweiser or Coors, thank God."
"Much different than I remember, and different than what I had on-tap at Sierra Nevada Brewery. This is the 3rd bottle that has tasted this way. I'll chalk it up to a more refined palate, but this just doesn't do much for me anymore. Considered a ""classic"" American Pale Ale in many circles. Way to bready and cheesy. I would pick nearly any pale ale over this. Boston Ale is a MUCH better mass-produced alternative. If you have to drink this, drink it ice-cold. It get's nasty warm."
"One of My favorite pale ales. This beer is very smooth with an excellent smell. I drank one with a Steak on Saturday night and the combination was awsome. A must try for any beer drinker. Well worth the money. Some of my other recomendations for ales, try Redhook's IPA or Summit EPA"
"Clear Orange amber with beautiful, lucious, foamy, yellow-tan head. Sweet aroma of caramel and bready malt. Very nice array of interchanging flavors of sweet malt, caramel and citrusy hops, with a bitter and nutty aftertaste. Wonderful malt backing - a nice quality like other Sierra Nevada beers I've had. Medium carbonation. Extremely drinkable - I had a few of these. Very nice brew."
"This was a great pale ale as far as I'm concerned. I had it straight off the tap in a pint glass. Had a little bit of an amberish color to it. Although I thought it was a great beer, it tastes very similar to the Rock Bottom Brewery's Potomac Pale Ale (my last review). Sierra Nevada however is definitely in my top five of favorite pale ales."
"Poured a light amber, clear color with a continuous stream of bubbles, seemingly feeding a tiny, creamy, white head. Nose is citrus and cascase with a sour, grainy thing happening. Taste is citrus up front, tangy and slightly fruity in the middle, bitter and dry for the finish... very balanced. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and medium to light. Great stuff from a big producer. The classic American Pale Ale."
"The flavor has a mild sweet malt profile with touches of cascade hops. A soft nuttiness is also present, but not in an overpowering or oily fashion. The beer is smooth and certainly suitable as a daily drinker."
"Served at InField's, Chicago Loop. Good to see this style-setting beer at more places in my neck of the woods. Pours an appealing amber body under a thin pale ale head. Originally had a mild taste, but I felt that I was ""tasting"" the glass more (maybe it wasn't rinsed correctly), but the fine balance of hop and malt came through. Definite northwestern hop profile with spice, bitterness and a light fruity touch. A good, toasty malt blend that's just a little sticky on the palate. Leaves a nice aftertaste and a little alcohol warmth to enjoy afterward. Not ""extreme"" by any means, but an excellent session beer."
"Well I finally got around to this American classic. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, above par in every category, but I couldn't drink more than a few of these. Can't really say anything about this that hasn't been said before, good for the style, but nothing to write home about. A must try for any connoisseur of the cold ones."
"It poured clear gold with a white head. It smelled of hops and malt. It's taste was clean and sharp with a malt start and a hop finish. It was light and dry in the mouth. A decent beer, but not one I'll be searching for."
"This is a standard nowadays, a true American beer and style to boot. This baby is dangerously drinkable, make sure you pick up enough to satisfy your thirst."
"What can I say that hasn't already been said?? This is the best APA around and quite honestly my favorite domestic beer. Pours out of the bottle with a small head that doesn't stick around long. Smells of those wonderful Cascade hops...how I love them. The taste is smooth and hoppy. Great on a hot summer day, or any day for that matter. This is what beer should be."
"One of the first non-macro American beers I ever had back years ago. Its been over a year since I last had this one, so lets see where this takes us. The beer pours a light golden color with about one finger of head that falls quickly. The nose is hops and more hops. Just what I want in a good APA. Theres some floral and some citrus in the hop character...it just comes together and smells good. I guess I have come along since I last sampled this beer. The hop character is nicely balanced with sweet malts. Just a good beer. I would like to see a bit more hop carry through in the flavor, but it doesn't detract from the beer. The beer is not too thick or too thin in my mouth. Nice all around. This is an easy session beer. I'm glad I revisited it after taking some time off from it. Just a good offering."
"The mouthfeel is exceptional with subtle carbonation (thanks to the bottle conditioning I suppose). This beer is excessively drinkable and as good as I imagined. Thank god they sell it in western Canada."
"This one came served to me from the bar in...a Mason jar? Yep, ah well, it's a treat to find some halfway decent draught offerings in my little town.Filled to the brim of a 16oz Mason jar so not much head to speak of, although there is a sturdy layer of foam on top of the ruby-hued amber body.The scent was a bit of caramel malt, with a hefty dollop of Cascade hops, piney and grapefruit. The taste was really nice, seemed to be really fresh, resinous hops with enough malt presence to back it adequately. Mouthfeel was about medium-light, and makes the beer really refreshing. This beer had more hop presence than a local IPA I was having afterwards, so I ended up returning to it. When I had it this time it just really seemed to be pushing Pale Ale into IPA territory. Delicious, and as ever a real go-to beer."
"This is the beer that got me started on my quest for better beer and still one of my favorites. It's only fitting that it would be my first one to review."
"I just bought a sixer of this. Poured a yellow-orange color with a thick light-tan head with alot of rising bubbles. Malts and hops with some lemon are very noticable in the smell. The taste is malty at first, with strong hops at the finish. The mouthfeel is strong and malty, coating the tongue with its hoppy aftertaste. I will definately buy this beer again when I am in the mood for a nice pale ale."
"Other than that, it's really nothing special. Nice hops, but not fantastic. Not something to go for if you're looking for the unique brew. It's good, but nothing spectacular."
"Pours a golden amber colored with a thin off-white head. Cascade hop aroma and some muted caramelly malt notes, too. Not particularly bad in any sense, but nothing to email home about, either. I feel this brew shines in its drinkability. It's been a while since I had this beer, and maybe I'm being a little sentimental, but it's good. It's good so revisit some old stand-bys every now and then. Good carbonation. Lacking a bit in malt complexity, and thin in the middle, but Cascades are good..."
"16oz pint glass presentation. Hardly a head, but what was present was a white film over a dark amber brew, with no lacing. Light pale malt aroma coupled with a bit of hops, with the flavor carrying on where the nose left off, and an overall acceptable feel. Mouthfeel and drinkability excellent."
"Drinkability: Well-balanced means easy to drink frequently."
"Slightly hazed orange with a off white to beige head capping off the top.Malt, crisp citrus and hops bleed aroma into the nose with refreshing ease.Malt hits the tastebuds first but are doomed to a quick end by the tidal of hops. Caramel soon joins and smooths out the rest of the drink. Very nicely balanced. The entire drink shalaqs the mouth with great malt and hops. I'll have this again."
"Overall, I'm not too impressed. I was expecting more fruity notes to balance the bitterness. I can respect what this beer has done for the microbrewery business, but I've never been able to get into it."
"Pours out a amber/copper color with a pretty decent off-white head. Strong lacing down the side of the glass, and much better than average head retention put this beer among the top. Smell is a category I always struggle with. Having said that, I do detect some hops and citrus notes... possibly some malt in there as well. Overall a pleasant smell. Taste is well above average. Strong hop bitterness balanced by a sweet maltiness and some citrus flavors. Though not overly complex, I feel this is still a very delicate balance that makes it a very good beer. True to the style, it finishes with strong hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is excellent as well. Light and crisp without being over carbonated or too thin. I consider this a very strong offering worthy of a special occasion or everyday consumption alike. Definitely a beer that any craft beer lover should try. Maybe a good beer for someone who was recently converted from macros, but I wouldn't make this one part of such a program too early due to the bitterness!"
"Very drinkable, nice balanced, hoppy Pale Ale."
"The beer disembogues the stubby brown 12-ounce bottle a slightly hazy amber color, the head portly and off white in color with the left over lace a fine velum like sheet, that obscures the glass. Oh what a wonderful nose, malt, citrus crisp, hop floral, and just plain sniffable, with the start rich in malt and somewhat sweet, top is middling in its feel. Finish has a determined acidity, the hops wonderfully spicy and the aftertaste desert bone dry. Sorry ""Old Friend"" if I have ignored you lately, it was not intentional."
"Overall: Definitely solid beer. This one has long been one of my mainstay beers, I can find it almost anywhere I go, and pretty cheaply at that. Furthermore it's a great session brew, I can and have had many of these throughout the night, and I often feel like i just can't get enough of it."
"This was truly the brew that got me started on good craft beer, and to this day its still a favorite. Pours a beautiful amber with a nice white head about an inch thick. Aromas are of citrus and bitter hops, with a bit of doughy bread malt. For flavor this beer has it all. Initially this beer shows off a barrage of hops, some citrusy, some piney, a just a little that provide some nice bitterness. Somewhere in between all of it some bread and dough like malts sneak their way in to provide a perfect balance. But just as the malts appear, the hops come back into the picture to finish this beer in perfect pale ale fashion, leaving just a bit of spiciness to make you crave another sip. The body of this beer is nice and light with a crisp carbonation. Very well balanced."
"I really enjoyed this one! One of the best I have ever had. Tried several other Sierra Nevada products this day and this by far the best one! Not heavy, but not light - just right! I bought a six pack to acquire a taste and ended up forking out $120 to put on a half! Highly recommended!"
"Pours a deep, but clear and consistent golden brown. Aroma is pleasant with slight flowery undertones. Taste is clean but not without flavor and the hops are generous but not overpowering. Hits the back of the tongue producing a round mouthfeel. Very drinkable. A clear example of a classic Pale Ale without overreaching in complexity."
"After a break I have been drinking this beer quite a bit lately and must say that I am impressed with it all over again. It's a classic in the light caramel/ citrusy hops vein but what I am struck with is just how elegant this beer has become. Residual sweetness, bitterness, malt and hops in the nose- it's all in perfect proportion. This is a real quality APA."
"This is a definite beer to pick up again. Wonderful Pale Ale."
"I highly recommend this one."
"I wasn't surprised when Consumer Reports rated it the best overall beer based on taste and cost. Of course, since they couldn't review every beer out there, people might not agree. But they aren't way off base."
"I could drink this all night long. It is a solid pale ale with strong hop flavor, but none of the disagreeable bitterness and over-pined flavor of some pale ales."
"Drinkability: Excessively so. The Quintessential American Pale Ale."
"This is known as the epitome of an American Pale Ale, as well it should. It has a nice appearance in the glass, with a slightly cloudy orange color. The lace sticks around until I finish the beer. The smell is citrusy, and so is the taste. The taste is also dominated by hopiness and a little bit of sweetness from the citrus flavor. This is overall a very versatile beer. It is great in the summer and the winter. It is great with or without food. It is, without a doubt, a pleasure to drink."
"There is a real nice crisp and clean character to this beer. One of my favorite Pale Ales."
"I expected more from this Pale Ale, perhaps it was the batch that was the problem. Pours light amber. Smells a lot of hops and alcohol, kinda skunky. Tastes rather bitter with a generous portion of hops, alcohol, and skunk that stays with your tongue until your next sip. I was not impressed at all."
"This is a wonder beer that is available all over, frequently quite cheaply (I got my current 12pk for $7.99)"
"Came in a pint glass. A nice golden color blend in with some amber tones, with a decent amount of carbonation. I wished there was more carbonation in this beer but it had to do. Smell was quite hoppy for a pale ale. Some citrus undertones with some grain in the background were there as well. Taste was mostly hops as well. Some undertones of malts can be tasted as well in the middle and into the aftertaste. Finally I know what the fuss is about for this beer. One of the better pale ale's out there, espeically on-tap."
"I can't believe I have not reviewed this beer yet as I have had it many times. What makes this a touchstone among so many beerlovers. It is the blend between easy drinking and hoppy complexity. This beer has lots of interesting nuances for the sipper but goes well with food and mowing the grass. Along with Liberty Ale by Anchor Steam this beer helped define the American Pale Ale. What also is a bonus is the availibility of this beer even in gas stations and supermarkets."
"Considering how often I keep coming back to this beer, I've upgraded the 'drinkability' score significantly as well as the 'mouthfeel' (those fine bubbles are very lager-like and do a good job of refreshing the palate.)"
"The mouthfeel was nice and it is easy to drink."
"Pours an amber orange color with a nice white head and good lacings throughout. Smells light, fresh, and a little hoppy. A hint of alcohol of you really get your schnozz in there and sniff. Pretty bland tasting I think but it has a nice mix of hops and a touch of citrusy sweetness. It's definitely a drinkable brew. Great for a cookout and a good representation of the style. A good session beer but I'm just not a big fan of pale ales unless they punch me in the face (which I guess is NOT the definition of pale ales). I would definitely recommend this brew to all."
"As the nose indicated, this is mostly hops. Nice and fresh, strong floral/herbal quality, but malts are there. Very well balanced, and thoroughly enjoyable. Easy to see why this is considered by many to be the gateway beer into craft beverages."
"I gave Sierra Nevada pale ale a 4.0 because lets face it, this is the staple of craft beers, chances are this is where you started when it all began.The beer pours a bright golden amber, the head is a sight to see, ivory white and the lacing is impecable.The smell is that of a nice spring air, fresh cascade hops with slight caramel hints, a citrus/floral that brings character. The taste is a orchestrated mix of malt sweetness and fruit aftertones. The hop bitterness is just enough to appreciate the sweetness. Hints of lemon/orange zest and fresh rasberries linger in the buds. The roasted malt will show its power in the end.This is a medium bodied pale ale and has that nice crisp but smooth refreshing flavor you need in a nice pale. As far as drinkability goes, you can have a 12 pack a day of these, yes they are that good. SNPA is like the Don Corleone of beers. It is the Godfather. Alot of people are starting to put down SN because they are becoming ""too big", hogwash this will always be one of the best pale ale's available."
"Wyll-"
"The standard for american pale ale. The best thing about this beer is that it's widely available, and you can find it at a chain restaurant or run-of-the-mill liquor store anywhere. It's a solid brew, not really stetching the boundaries. The amazing thing is that it establishes the boundaries, and it's a tried and true piece of american brewing, even after all these years."
"Pours a clear copper color with a white foamy head. The head stayed on this beer for a long time. There was a great amount of lace on the glass at the end. Smells like a grapefruit, with hints of slightly toasted malt. The taste was sweet up front, with a big hit of Cascade hops. Even though this is a well-hopped beer, it had great balance. Medium body, with modest carbonation. Overall, this is the textbook APA. It goes down great. I would have this again and again."
"There is already hundreds of reviews for this beer so I will keep it brief and to the point. Pours a nice golden amber color with a slight white head that left some nice lacing. Hops are definatly present in the smell with citrus notes. The flavor is very similar to the smell with the hops being upfront but not too much so and a bit of malt and spice is present too. It also has a slight bitter after taste and the mouthfeel is good. The best thing about this beer is its availability, this can be found either on tap or atleast in the bottle and a wide variety of establishments. A good beer to covert macro drinkers over with in my experience, a good taste but not too aggresive."
"Its a slightly above average APA."
"This is one refreshing beer, that is one of my standbys and which I almost always seem to have around. This is truely the beer that sets the standard for american pale ales."
"The quality of this ale matched with its relatively wide availability makes it a godsend when stores/pubs see fit to serve only this, Bud, and Budlight."
"Oh, boy, where to start... This is a very good hoppy beer for someone who is not partial to hoppy beers- that's how good it is. Pours a nice dark golden color with a small off-white head. Aroma is floral, slight citrus, and nice hops. The flavor is its best aspect (that's a good thing) and very enjoyable. The smooth flavors follow through with pine and herbal-oily notes. The hops are present throughout the taste, but end very nicely. Moderate clean mouthfeel with some creaminess, but not as much as some others I have had. Leaves a bitter aftertaste that just begs to be covered up by some more SNPA. This is my first 5.0 on drinkability"
"It has been a long time since I have tried this pale ale. I had forgotten what a well made beer it really is. The beer poured a deep golden with a firm tan head. The head faded fast and is probably the least impressive aspect of this beer. The aroma of hops comes through but with each sip the smell of the malt gets stronger. What a joy. The hops on the tongue are not overpowering and the chocolaty, malty taste comes through very strong. The mouthfeel is medium with a tingle of carbonation that lasts throughout the beer. This is a delightful beer that is a joy to drink. No aspect of it rules which makes it a pleasure to sip with a meal or while typing a review. I will most certainly be buying more of these for the fridge."
"this beer is packed full of mouthwatering flavor. but i couldnt honestly call it a session beer, if only because my pallate isnt quite trained up to handling it long term in one sitting. seriously hop accented but enough malt to back it all up."
"Clear and golden in color. Thick white lace persists for awhile, leaving a splash of lace on the glass. Aromas are crisp, with citrus and floral notes dominating. Flavor starts with a malty sweetness that is quickly usurped by the cascade of hoppy bitterness. Quite well-balanced and a brisk and short finish that satisfies and keeps you wanting more. A beer that I have no reservations about ordering, as I know this will always please."
"A very pleasant pale ale. Pours a very nice amber color. A nice white foamy head arises at initial pouring, though this decreases to about a quarter of an inch rather quickly. The smell is pleasant, which hints of the hops and malt contained within. The taste is nice on both the palate and tongue: both bitter and sweet. A nice crisp finish. Seek this one out and enjoy!"
"A great and refreshing session ale, very drinkable, fresh tasting even over here in ireland"
"Definitely recommended as an introduction to the American Pale Ales. Another widely available brew to fall back on as well."
"There just isn't much to say about this American staple that hasen't been said already...."
"Taste is moderately spicy, but smooth. I think that pale ales are my preference in beer."
"After a few years of drinking this beer, and trying many others, the ""specialness"" of this beer is sort of lost for me. Still a good beer, but it just doesn't ""wow"" me anymore."
"Overall: This is the classic American pale ale. It's one of those beers that is good any time of the year. I always have a case of this stuff on hand. This is also a very good beer for those just breaking through into the world of craft beers. It is a very accessible, drinkable beer."
"What a great beer. It pours a nice clear golden color with a good head. The smell is very strong of hops. Very floral and powerful. The taste it really dominated by hops and the bitterness at the end is quite nice. Its not too rough but does have a nice bite to it. Its a very smooth beer that is a joy to drink."
"The quintessential APA."
"There are many beers I used to enjoy that no longer taste that good to me. In contrast, every time I grab a six-pack of SNPA, I am pleasantly surprised all over again at what a great beer it is. Yummy."
"Drinkability: Yes please. This beer has such a wide distribution, I find myself getting it a lot at restaurants and bars that whose selections are only American macros and this. I could drink these for awhile, but if I had other more exotic beers to choose from this would easily be passed over. The classic American micro to whom we are all indebted."
"Comments - This is one of my all time favorites. One that I am constantly going back to at least once a month for a revisit. Very accessable in my next of the woods as it is with most palces now and I take full advantage of it."
"s.d."
"This one just does the right thing."
"24 ounce bomber bottle, ( a nice touch) no freshness dating to be found. Not much I can add to the other 400 or so reviews. This is the classic pale ale, so good it defines the style. One of the first micros to be had back in the day. If you havent sampled this tasty quaffer, you are missing alot. Goes great with spicy BBQ. Cheers!"
"A+ with a smiley face!"
"I've raised my review score, since I've either started loving the hop, my tastes have changed or the fact that this is one of the few decent beers you can get around here on a night out and I've become more accoustomed to it."
"Overall it's a good beer, but there's at least a couple of local pales that are at least just as good (and possibly better) and I usually go local when I have a choice."
"This was on of my first microbrews so i decided to revisit it for the purpose of this review. It pours a nice golden orange color with a smooth white head. A standard looking pale ale i might say. Smell is big on hops and citrus as is the taste. Big hoppy notes are present, I wish there was a little more malt flavor in this as the citrus and hops aren't balanced that perfectly to my palate. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both decent. This isn't my favorite pale ale but it'll always do in a pinch."
"This beer poured a rich golden color with nice creamy head from a 12oz bottle. The aroma was a bit much from the hops. I have had this on tap previously as well and the odor is generally much more pleasant. The taste was extremely pleasant with a wheat-like malt flavor that is offset by citrus hops. The carbonation is moderate and the drinkability is very good. Overall, this beer goes down nice and smooth and has quickly become my favorite ""normal bar"" beer. It is definitely one of the best American Pale Ales that I have had to-date."
"--Joey"
"A classic, was my very first intoduction to American pale ales back in the day, and a pleasure to revisit. Straight four's on the board for this one, thanks to northyorksammy for sending one my way to sample. It's been a very long while since I had one of these, and it brings back fond memories indeed."
"i could see myself drinking a 6pack of this easily. the taste is really refreshing and unique."
"As much as some like to complain that this stuff is overhyped or too commercialized, this is still very much a good beer."
"Had this 3 years later on-tap and this review is based on that, at Pizza Port Solena Beach Lace, a serviceable pale. AFter so many good pales, Sierra finds its way among the pack, but was sure a revalation when I first had it."
"SN represents the best in product quality and integrity- I like this stuff."
"4.5 out of 5 swills, and that's not being generous."
"This is a very drinkable beer that I want to have again. Perhaps my bottle had been on the shelf a little longer than it should have been."
"I polished off a six-pack of this before a Yankees World Series game last October, but I have to admit it was a bit of a struggle near the end of the pack. I usually prefer a much mellower beer, but this is indeed a nice change every once in a while. A decent beer, but a little overrated."
"Exactly what I expect from a pale ale. Definitely a beer to try when discovering ""good beer"" and one I will continue to buy."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale was served from a 12 oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a brilliant copper-orange hue hazed by a suspension of fine particulates, and topped with a scattered white head that left nice lacing. The nose was mouthwatering, exuding a soft sweetish maltiness and a very lively zingy citric hop bouquet. The taste was firm and crisp, with a dry malt base that presented a limey zip transition into the clean bitter citric finish. The body was richly full. All of this made for an extremely refreshing and very tasty brew that makes for great drinking. A solid effort, worth having some on hand at all times."
"After having one of my favorite local beers, Millstream Schild Brau (Amber Ale), I decided I wanted something with some hoppy kick to it and saw the SNPA on tap. Boy, I got what I asked for and more! You can't ask for more hop flavor out of a ""all year"" beer, I mean there was not too much subtley to describe, just knock you on your ass hop clean and fresh hop flavor.1 This beer goes down easy and has a nice head for the style, great lacing. I have no idea why people would drink something like Bud (which laughably touts its high quality hops in their commercials) when stuff like this is available nationally. This will definitely be my ""go to"" beer when I want something hoppy, though usually I like something a little mellower in this area. Great beer though."
"This is becomming an American Classic. This beer is solidly enjoyable, complex in flavor but clean enough to go well with a variety of foods and be refreshing. Also makes a good session brew. The hops in this beer are flowery and bright. The flavor is crisp and citrusy. There is just enough malt to balance the hop flavor and ease into the finish. A solid APA and probably the best made mass produced beer."
"I liked this a lot. It will probably be one of my regulars!"
"Taste is just above average. Grassy and creamy pale malt. A nice hop profile and crsip. A bit fruity with a nice hoppy finish. Nicely balanced. A bit creamy and very very drinkable. Refreshing. The ultimate fallback beer and an old favorite of mine."
"This was the beer that opened my eyes to the potential of American microbrews over 20 years ago. I have a lot of respect for it, but also realize we've come a long way since then. While not the best one out there now, it's good to see it still holds up so well. Kudos to Sierra Nevada for this classic brew!"
"Finally  I come full circle and back to one of the early names from the beer revolution. Its good to slow down and focus on a classic like this. Slightly hazy and golden orange in color. A lively and well carbonated beer with a large frothy head. The aroma gives off sweet fruity hops with cherry, apricot and some floral notes. The bitterness is pleasant and just perfect in this beer. Very natural tasting. Matches with a medium body of fruity and sweet malts. Still is the benchmark for the west coast pale style. A beautiful beer."
"This beer is sort of like a great bicycle; you don’t think much about it because it always does exactly what it’s supposed to do. It’s easy to understand how this beer help launch the micro revolution—it never lets you down."
"pours gold/amber with a very nice looking medium-sized white head with great lacing. smell is simple citric hops. taste is simple but solid - smooth bready malt taste surrounded by citric hops. there is no hidden treasure - but there is no letdown either. I can see why this is considered by some to be the standard american pale ale. a good beer."
"Pours a shade darker than amber with a whispy little head. Aroma is of Hops, nice citrus piney floral hops. Once you smell it you know what you are in for. Taste starts off with a little prickly hops on the tongue , melds into a bit of nice malt in the middle, then drys off strong with the Cascade hops. Mouthfeel is nice with great carbonation keeping the beer from being astringent on the tongue. Drinkability-- I could drink this all day no matter the season. One of the benchmarks for American Pale Ale. For a lot of people i know this is the when all else fails- beer , as it is widely available and often the only craft beer on tap.. This is not a knock because this is a very tasty beer"
"Poured into a pint glass, this is a beautiful beer. The perfect white head floats atop a beautiful amber brew that is brimming with hoppy goodness. As I come back to the beer, I'm always impressed by the malty nose that so pleasantly contrasts the intense hop finish. It is a wonderful beer, but it requires a true appreciation of cascade hops to enjoy."
"I expected very good things from Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and was just a little let down in the end. It's not that it's bad beer, not by a long shot, but there are better versions out there. I'm sure I'll come back to it again since it's so widely available (and since my local hoppy options are so limited)."
"Built for Summertime enjoyment (IMO). Not hard to drink this throughout the day I imagine."
"taste was very crisp and clean. the hops were not as strong as i remember but they were there. i found it to be very drinkable and good. i'll buy it again."
"Pours a true gold color, with lots of sediment and average head. Smell is crisp and hoppy but not overpowering. Taste sets a very good standard, hoppy and sweet and just enough bitter flavor. A very drinkable brew. Overall recommended."
"Beef Notes: I like this beer more and more every time I drink it. It's quickly becoming a favorite as I develop a taste for hops. I will be buying more."
"Pours a cloudy, amber color (due to the yeast used in the natural carbonation). The color ""seeps"" a bit into the plentiful head, giving it a not quite white color. The hoppiness is present in the nose, and the taste. I originally didn't like this beer, but after drinking it nearly everyday when I was California, it turned me into a hophead. The bitter-sweet balance is nearly perfect here. I can easily drink a six-pack of this, although the flavor can get harsh towards the end."
"Somewhat hazy, more orange than yellow, with a smallish off-white head. Light, pleasant, sorta' floral aroma. The mouthfeel was full and consistent. The taste begins very smooth and almost sweet, then blends into a nice mellow hoppy finish for a drinking experience that was far more enjoyable than the appearance promised. I would enjoy this for a session."
"A true modern classic and one that started me on the path to better beer. Others have improved on the original, IMHO, but as the trend has been ""bigger is better"" in craft brewing, SNPA retains high marks for drinkability; simply one of the finest session pale ales around. Once I began stockpiling Celebration every year I stopped buying this beer, so this is a homecoming of sorts. It pours a light orange amber with a frothy white head that leaves rings. The aroma is light but dominated by citric hops. The taste is mostly citrus with some pine and is pleasantly bitter. A simple sugar, candy-like sweetness makes a brief appearance on the palate but the malt doesn't develop like some of the bigger PAs. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and slightly creamy but not heavy, an excellent lunchtime brew."
"A classic. I simply have nothing bad to say about this beer. Deep amber color with some yeasty clouding. Skunky hops aroma with a grainy malt backbone. Assertive hops flavor that balances well with a substantial maltiness. A syrupy bitterness lingers. Mouthfeel is great...tremendously refreshing yet chewy. Drinkability is legend. My ""go to"" beer."
"Drinkability is good, but I prefer a Fuller's to this."
"Mouthfeel is extremely smooth. Has a great light carbonation that gives it a nice crisp and smooth finish."
"I was really impressed by this beer from the start, my wife purchased it for me as a Christmas present. When I read the label and saw it was bottle conditioned, being a homebrewer, I was excited. The color, a nice copper, was very impressive. The fruity aroma was the next hint I was in for a great drink. The only fault I find is the head retension, there was none. But overall I was greatly impressed with this pour."
"An incredibly drinkable beer."
"A beer that I must say I really love. Pale Ales are one of my favorites and this one does not disappoint! Pours to a nice golden color with a small bubbly head. Small amount of lacing diminishes quite quickly and leaves you an excellent tasting brew! The smell is a somewhat strong hint of citrus and hops making you want to dive right in! The taste is dry and hoppy with a good deal of carbonation. One of my favorite beers of all time, one that I can drink regardless of the season!"
"Char"
"The beer pours a pure gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is great. It has all the right stuff; hops, pale and carapils malts, and a floral nose. The taste is great. Again, it has a nice malt palate with a floral hop flavor that really makes this beer. The mouthfeel is good. This is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a beautiful beer that drinks very well; an excellent pale ale."
"A damn fine beer."
"This beer certainly did not seem as bitter or dry as when I first tried it back when I was 17, but it did have a good, slightly strong hoppiness to it that really makes this beer one of a kind. Adding the yeast sediment contributes some cloudiness to the beer, but I didn't recognize any immediate changes in the flavor. This would be good with some bbq ribs. A good beer if you're trying to slowly convert someone into a hophead, and it is so very easy to quaff a few of these down."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice ale, I look forward to my next one. Goes down very well, not too demanding on the taster. Kudos."
"Very nice rusty color with a decent head and beautiful laces left on the glass after each sip. A good amount of hops are present for a sweet smell. An outstanding taste that is not overally hopped up but still gives you that nice flavor of hops and fruitiness in your mouth. This beer really hits your tastebuds and can be appreciated by those who are still new to this style of beer. I recommend this to anyone who is still trying to get a feel for hops. A very nice beer for anytime you want to kick back and enjoy life."
"This is a fine beer."
"Light to medium feel, smoothness balance by the hop bitterness, easy drinking session beer"
"A very refreshing and tasty brew, a great every day drinking beer and transition beer"
"A great beer in my opinion, worth a try if you haven't already. You'll find it to be one you come back to again."
"The pale ale which others are judged by, or so it seems. Nice golden beer with a touch of amber. White foamy head eventually dies to a wring of white bubbles following there way down the glass. Aroma is of hops citrus and flowery with hint of malt. Taste is crisp light hops with light malt coming threw. Mouthfeel is light as it should be great beer for killing thirst after hot day at work. Very drinkable and avaliability everywhere makes it a good choice over the usual macro swill."
"Pours a pale amber with a nice biggie white head which laces the sides of the glass. A nice 24oz bottle fits so perfectly into a 25oz glass. Nice hop flavor with a nice malt balance. I'm supprised I've gone so long without sampling this ""classic"" brew. Certainly a good one that should have been drinking. Now I know why this beer is often the only decent beer on tap. It really is decent."
"This has go to be my favorite pale ale I always go back to this beer. A beer for all tastes if ever there was one. It poured a medium amber, not very pale, with a steady white head. The hoppy aroma was strong but not overpowering. Wish I had more of this right now..."
"Overall Impression: It’s all about the hops baby. Enough malt to keep it all civilized, but by no means brings it to balance. If you’re a hophead, this is a refreshing brew, but a bit one-dimensional. Maybe I’ve just gotten use to the Celebration Ale. This “Pale”s in comparison but it’s an unfair association. It’s pretty high on my list of Pale Ales; give it a try."
"I had this out of a keg, if you can believe that. I didn't know what I had until I asked the host. Deep golden brown color. Smell was strong of hops and a little florals. Tastes very hops heavy as it finished, very refreshing. This was a good all-around beer, that I would get again, probably bottled, though."
"This beer is one of the classics - It pours a lovely dark golden with a stiff, rocky head that does't quit until the penultimate mouthful. This beer raps you on the nose with lime and bitter hops smell to let you know this is no sissy beverage. The taste backs up the nose with a crispness that hits your throat and all up in your sinsues letting you know this beer is not all about a hop assault on the sense. Qaulity ingrediants and a mild estery flavor from the yeast from bottle conditioning. Yet, after the beer is in your gullet, you are then reminded of where you started, with a dry, citrusy back end from the hops. I could (and have) enjoyed several of these in a setting and welcome each opportunity to do so."
"I challenge anyone to drink just one of these. The aforementioned hop/malt balance make this beer go down about as smooth as a beer should, with the carbonation and distinguished sweetness performing a olfactory pas de deux with the pine-scented hops. It's a classic, as it should be, and happens to be the first micro-brew to truly wow me, in Winter, CA, roundabout 1992 or so. It was a year or so before I could get it on the east coast, but since that time, I've never hesitated to fall back on SNPA's stylistic excellence and wonderful flavor."
"A very fine (as well as a defining) example of American Pale Ale. Just the right amount of hoppiness and just enough malt presence to balance it out. It has become one of my favorite table beers... I would consider Sierra Nevada Pale to be a ""standby."" When I play gigs in a bar and I am greeted by a sea of ""lite beers"" on tap, it is very comforting to see the green tap handle there in between the typical brands.. The bottled version is just a notch below the on-tap version, but it stands up well -- probably because it is bottle conditioned... The color suits a beer of this style. It is suitably pale, but has an orangish-red glow that make it very appealing. A comfortable evening lies ahead of me as I sip a few more of these..."
"Fortunately, this brew IS widely available, even out in the boondocks of the central Appalachian mountain coalfields, in my case at a beer store near Pound, Va, near the Ky/Va line. Pours a a just off-clear amber, with no real head. Minimal lacing. Nose is powerful, lemon rind and hops. Mouthfeel fizzles the tongue with carbonation and initial bitterness of citrus and hops. Feels pretty nice. Taste is excellent for a pale ale. Pine and some spice are in the background somewhere. Alcohol is well disguised, but definitely lets its presence be known after a couple of these. Some excellent malt flavor balances the hops toward the end of the glass. I've always felt a bitter aftertaste from this brew, but that's not a major issue, especially if you're having it with pizza. Looks like this is an ale that will be a regular in my fridge."
"Notes: This has to be the ultimate fall-back beer, since it tastes good and is extremely widely available. Makes for a wonderful session beer also, with enough hops to break through even a saturated palate."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is, hands down, 1 of the best overall beers out there!! and that's a bold statement!!"
"I used to think that this beer was very hoppy, now really all I can taste is malt. I've been ""ruined"" one too many times. But still, a fabulous everyday session brew that never fails to please."
"Overall: tough to critique probably the most popular pale ale going. I'm a lager guy and I enjoyed this brew, it might get me sipping a few more ales in the future."
"The beer is a slightly orangeish color. It is just a hint cloudy. Fairly good nose of hops. Possibly a bit of pineyness on the aroma also. There is a well balanced taste here. Medium to full body, with a good balance of sweetness to the hops. Still the standard of all American Pale Ales."
"A good beer-yes. A cult beer-I can see that, as most of us in the US don't dare reach out much beyond this anyway. It's at whole foods-yipee-I'm a cool, way-out kind of beer drinker--too cool dude. Hey, is this organic?Good, fresh brew, with malty richness and a nice bitter hop balance. Perhaps the coolest beer on the planet for those just stepping up from butt-wiper. An above ""good"" pale ale that gets way to much hooplah for what it is. Sorry frat boys and girls who think they have found the holy ""pale."""
"The appearance was a clear and light amber color. The smell was hoppy with a hint of fruit. The taste was clean and crisp with a bitter twinge that carried throughout until the end. The after taste was sharp but pleasant at the same time. The mouthfeel was dry and strong and this was a very drinkable beer. I could see this fitting many occassions and I'm glad this is a very accessible beer. I'd have no problems using this as my safe bet in a pinch."
"Probably the best readily available beer on the market."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite ""go-to"" beers. A classic American Pale Ale."
"This is the standard by which all American Pale Ales are judged. Some may be better, but this is the best seller, the one that has penetrated markets and contends for the title of King of Beers. The slight chill haze is easily excusable since SNPA is bottle conditioned. The aroma provided by generous amounts of Cascade hops is a quite evident spicy-flowery-citrusy, that pleases throughout the lace coated glass. A hint of sweet malt covered by some underlying bitterness provides excellent balance. Each swallow finishes with a crisp hoppiness that begs for more.This is a great session beer, not that I'm inclined for excess, you understand, that works for picnics, parties, and for those of you who understand, crab feasts."
"Pours a golden orange, with a decent sized white head that somewhat lasts, and laces quite well on the descent. Aroma is all about the cascades - floral, piney, citric...maybe a tiny hint of bready malt in the back. Flavor starts with a small bit of malt, and then come the beautiful flavors of the cascade hops, rolling all over the tongue. Medium bodied, extremely easy to drink - one of the best of the style."
"The tap version of this is superior to the bottle, which led me to comment. It has a nice amber appearance in the glass with little aroma to speak of (Of course, I was drinking it in a place that was using a lot of fried onions.) I loved the taste. It has a very earthy taste to it. Lots of grain appeal. It gets better as you let it warm. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean, and you can drink a few of these without even realizing it. Genuinely, drinkable American mass-produced beer. It is not Sierra's best but it's hard here in the East to find any of their other beers on tap."
"Finally had this beer on tap the other night at a great pool hall in the neighborhood and wow! This was much smoother on tap and the beer had a much more pronounced malt character than it does in the bottle. The floral hoppyness was still there, but in a much more balanced way. I had about 5 of these on tap and they went down so good I could have had 5 more!"
"Golden copper in color rocky head. Aromas of sweet malts and spicy hops. Taste is fresh and piney, but perfect balanced between a mellow sweet malt backbone and cascading sapy hops. One of the most drinkable beers in existence and a fantastic gateway to good beer."
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 19JUN03, this post is based on notes from that review. -"
"Pours a nice light bronze color with a thick head. The aroma is extremely satisfying, huge floral and citrus tones excite the nose. The taste is big - hoppy, sweet, fruity, and smooth. The hops and citrus last long into the aftertaste. This is a perfect example of the ultimate drinkable beer. Continues to be a staple in the refridgerator for me. All american pale ales should try to emulate this."
"This was an interesting beer. I found it to be rather meaty, if that is a word to describe beer. But I was sort of overwelmed. This is not normally like me. I can drink the hoppy brews with the best of them. I did like pale ale. It is something I will drink again, but I can't make this a daily drink. I'm a wierdo and a hippy."
"M"
"Drinkability: Easy to enjoy, a simple good beer. It doesn't impose itself and it isn't bland or boring, a perfect middle."
"This was one of the first beers I tasted that switched me into the realm of quality beers. ( I was a big Yuengling fan, I still think it's great for the price). It pours into a true golden color with a head that settles fast. It smells of hops but not overwhelming. It tastes oh so good. Bitter at first but it leaves me wanting more. Very high drinkability. My favorite brew, I can always fall back on this when I can't decide what to buy. Quality through and through."
"This beer is one of the reasons I got into expanding my horizons as far as new brews are concerned. What a treat. Full rich fruit hop aroma, lucious hop heavy fruit taste with a honey accent. Slightly sweet aftertaste lingered in your mouth like the aftermath of a sweet kiss, seductively calling you to indulge again. The blending here is pure art. This beauty will always have a place in my fridge"
"Finally decided to reviewing this after many samples. Seems better in a bottle than on tap. Appearance is golden, with a small head and no lacing to speak of. Smells detected are the hops. Taste is excellent, nice smooth malt start with a big hop bite and a citrus finish. Very smooth yet full mouth feel. This is one of my old standbys. Had this coming of the golf course today-it was heaven!"
"Medium gold color, medium head. Mild malts and hops. A hoppy, slightly malty pale ale. Full flavor. Good balance of hops to malts. Mouthfeel is smooth. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is bitter. The classic Pale ale. This is an excellent beer to drink ICE COLD on a hot summer day."
"One of my all time favorite beers, and probably the beer that sent me in search of other better beers. Deep deep yellow in colore, white pillowy head, and an aroma that is simply the perfect balance of hops and malt. The taste, just like the smell hops, malt, perfection. while not as complex as some other beers, SN pale ale is quite possibly the best session brew out there."
"quite simply a great american brew. when i lived in boston this was always my fall-back beer as you could seemingly get it everywhere. now that i'm back home in nj, it's a little harder to come by but appears to be more and more available at bars as time goes by. pours an awesome amber colour with a moderate head that is not very long lasting but leaves you with a nice lacing. smells of hops and wheat and adds hints of fruit and earthiness, all of which can be found in the flavour. quite along going on here for a standard pale ale. carbonation is just right. this is a perfect session beer and is quite often just that for me. a classic."
"The mouthfeel is pretty rich and creamy. The apperance of the head was nice and creamy and it reflects the mouthfeel."
"This was a very nice beer! It had a light orange color to it with golden highlights and a nice sized white colored head. Smell is mainly of citric hops. Taste first shows me the bready malt that provides the base of the beer. The hops come next and they dominate but are never too much. There seem to be different hops there including floral hops, bitter hops, but the main taste I get is citrus hops with orange seeming to dominate. A very good beer that I will buy more often."
"It is available just about everwhere now, even at Rite Aid, which makes it even better. The perfect beer available just about everywhere."
"A classic American beer."
"An OK beer, made too much of it before trying it, but it's worth having more than once."
"I am having a hard time stopping to type and start this review because I can't put this beer down. SN Pale Ale pours a nice deep hazy copper-gold with a nice thick, clumpy head. The aromas are clean and pure, a nice floral and hoppy (Cascade?) nose. The taste is what makes this beer stand out for me--an absolute redefinition of quaffable. The taste reflects the nose with a nice dose of hops, sweet malty middle, and some more hops in the slightly bitter finish. I wish I was more adept and describing my perception of this beer, but alas I will let it speak for itself. This is definitely my new 'session beer' and has a permanent home in my fridge (until I drink it and have to buy more of course). Much respect to the folks at Sierra Nevada!"
"Despite the hoppiness the finish is not overpowering but it does go better with stronger food. Once in a while this style will leave a bit of a soapy aftertaste and SNPA is not immune."
"Tastes like an overhopped macro. If your only complaint about Bud is the lack of hops, try this beer. If you like a full bodied beer with a strong malty backbone skip it. Very floral aroma, strong hop flavor, but not much else to it. American Pale Ales like this seem to much like a 1 trick pony. Try to back up that hop with some malt."
"Clear amber colored, light flavor (by beer geek standards), this beer is a good stepping stone for people trying to get out of the BMC rut. In my opinion, SNPA will go down in annals of beer history as one of the leaders of the micro movement. These days, it is overshadowed by 'big beers', but every serious beer aficionado needs to try this one. It's still a very good example of an APA."
"Overall, a good APA. It's relatively wide availability often makes it a welcome sight in an otherwise boring beer establishment."
"Update  I had a few bottles of 2006 and thought it was grainier since I last remember. It is a terrific beer but just seemed so ordinary this time around. Its a definite 4.0 across the board at this point."
"Medium full in the mouth, with the malt slightly outweighing the good hop flavor on the palate. Great length from the hop bitterness, and the bottle-conditioned carbonation level is just right, lightening the body a bit, and scrubbing the hops from the palate in preparation for the next sip. Easy to down several of these. An old favorite, a classic of its style, and always a joy to see on an otherwise dismal beer list."
" In summary, a good, solid ale. Easy to get, so you can drink it without worries, and better than the vast majority of everything out there. If only everything you got at the local grocery store was this good...."
"As long as they have Sierra I can get by."
"Notes: Stellar session APA."
"ng"
"This is a very good pale ale. The color is a straw-like orange with a white head that was dissapointingly short-lived. The layer of yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle assures you that this is indeed a bottle conditioned ale - a definite plus in my scorebook. A strong hop aroma is dominated by the classic citrusy scents of american hop varieties. The floral-citrus flavors in the beer are more subtle, but the hop bitterness is unmistakable. A thin mouthfeel is appropriate in this beer, and makes it more drinkable. A great summer thirst quencher."
"Maybe in another few years I'll be able to appreciate the Sierra Nevada over-the-top approach to hops, but right now? Nope..."
"12oz. bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada pint glass. It pours a light copper color with two fingers of head. There is awesome head retention and good lacing. The smell fills the nose with pine and citrus. A very nice aroma. The taste has some fruity esters and a tiny bit of sweetness. This beer has a very good balance, perfect amount of hops for a pale. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth, but just a little light. The drinkability is awesome, and this is a great session pale."
"rich amber with a dicipating white head. sweet smelling, slightly citrusy, and sweetwith a little spice, a little grassy hops in there too. excelent taste with plenty of hops bitterness and flavor, some sweet spicy caramel malts seem to be present at the end, i don't pick up much more than that. great balance of carbonation and body."
"It had been awhile since I had drank this beer so I had a pint the other night,pours a hazy deep orange with a pretty nice sticky head.The aroma is definently zesty hoppy and a little piney.Taste to me might be a little over the top hopwise very citruisy and dry,pretty good beer but would like a little more balance to this beer.It is a hop head classic though."
"I am really pleased to get this - from what I understand this is the original American Pale Ale, a style which is making something of an impression over here in the UK, it's path having been laid by the popularity of the Golden Summer Ales which have a similar hop profile, though are softer and cleaner in the palate. The aroma is quite heavenly - delicate, floral and spicily citric, though that does die down after a while into something more grassy and rain like, even a touch metallic. When worked slightly the pale malt aroma does rise, but doesn't last long against the hops. The taste is surprisingly clean up front, but the sweet malt soon makes an appearance, slightly sticky but with a rounded body - a satisfying base from which the citric hops do their work, gradually taking over from the sweetness to emerge dark and tangy in the finish. A very pleasant beer."
"I think this is, if nothing else, a standard to measure if Pale ales are poor, or, if they are elite. Drink When it's Hot, Drink it when it's cold. Drink the damn thing if it's 20 years old. It is a delight. Hoppy, but not overpowering. Sweet enough to make it that year round treat. Dry aftertaste indeed. But it has that pale ale citrus flavor that everyone loves. So drinkable, it is a shame more people do not love it. If it takes you more then a day to finish (given that you are one to finish a 6er in a day, extenouating circumstance not standing) you got some problems, cause even the ""Bud-Light Boys"" are down with this delight. Go, buy this and run to the hills and sign it's praises. You are dismissed"
"Notes: This is quite enjoyable. The hop levels are subdued for a pale ale, but perhaps this is closer to the intended style. It is apparently quite a popular beer, and I can see why – It can be equally embraced by the masses looking for a change, and beer geeks alike. Definitely piques my interest in American beers."
"Drinkability: This is a very easy-drinking beer, thanks to the nice balance of flavors and smooth, almost creamy feel. Perfect refresher after 3+ hours of softball on a warm summer evening. This one (and its pack-mate) disappeared quite quickly."
"Basically this is the beer by which all other American Pale Ales are judged. It's a work of art and holds up no matter how sophisticated you think your beer palate is."
"Clear golden in color with wa thin white head that leaves a nice lace. Ah, the aroma. We all know that wonderful cascade aroma from sierra nevada. The taste is not bitter at all, but rather well balanced with a malty sweetness and the citrusy hops. This is a standard for anybody who truly loves beer."
"This is a great summer beer. Nice amber body with decent head and retention. Cascade hops all the way. This is the ale that gave me the ability to detect Cascade hops in beer. I've drank so many it's kind of programmed in my senses. Light enough flavor and body for the hot Summer weather.Perfect session beer as well and one of the most consistent brews I know of."
"I love this beer. This was my gateway beer to the world of hoppy beers. Pours a beautiful copper color with a fragrant white head. Sweet malts and refreshing, spicy hops flow from the top. Ahhhh! Taste starts with nice toffee malt sweetness that gracefully gives into perfectly matched hops. Nice oily, sprucey-bitter finish. Amazing balance leads to perfect drinkability. I'd buy it by the case if there weren't so many other great beers to try!"
"The balance of the brew was almost perfect. The mouthfeel was a little thin but a very drinkable brew."
"Bottle from a six-pack purchased for $5.99 (I think it was on sale)at the local Rosauer's. Poured a nice golden amber, with a decent amount of white head. Gave off a nice scent of floral hops with a sweet malt smell in the background. Starts off sweetly like some English bitters I've had, and then the hops kick in. Whoa! Big hop zap! The hops definitely win out over the malt in a big way, finishing off with a big, crisp citrusy note. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but compared to a macro pale, its like a stout. Definitely hits the spot on a warm day (like, say...today!), so long as you are not afraid of a little hoppiness - then again, who in their right mind gets a SN and DOESN'T expect hoppiness. What perplexes me is that my brother, who dislikes hoppiness (he won't even touch an IPA) loves this, and cites it as his favorite beer."
"Thick white head subsides at a medium pace. Nice amber color with adequate carbonation. The hops are very prevalent and this is refreshing for a pale ale. Aroma of citrussy hops with a hint of sweet malt. Mouthfeel is a bit light but good for a pale ale. the carbonation bits enough to let the hops ring through the maltiness. Overall a brew i would be happy to drink again."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a golden amber color with a good head, that stuck around, leaving some lacing on the glass. Aroma is all hops, with maybe a hint of malt. The taste is malty and hoppy. Very smooth mouthfeel, and well balanced. I tried this beer once before quite a while ago, and didn't care for it. But after all this sampling, and being educated on good beers, I find that this is very enjoyable."
"this is the staple pale ale. pours a nice golden amber with a nice head, nice smell of hops and flowers. the taste is light and crisp, pleasant hop bite and floral notes. light and drying in the mouth. etremely refreshing light brew that is easily available and fits any situation."
"Maybe its the years of practice, but when in doubt, pick up a sixer and you'll be set."
"Extremely easy to drink. Hey, where did it go?"
"While I'll always have a soft spot for this beer and will continue to drink it from time to time, I've since had better examples of the style. Still a classic.... though no longer world class imho."
"Nice floral aroma. Dark orange color with a creamy white head. Slightly cloudy. Taste is all hops, very citric, with grapefruit. Medium high carbonation. Good hops. Lots of hops. Cascade hops. An extremely enjoyable and refreshing pale ale. Availability of this one makes it the uber-session brew."
"Pours a nice dark golden color with a tight off white head on top. Great head retention turning to a nice lace until the bottom of my glass. The aroma is all hops with hints of malt in the back round, very nice. The taste is all out hops with a hint of citrus and a nice mix with the malt. This is a crisp, refreshing beer. Very enjoyable and easy to drink. Now I understand all the hype of Sierra Nevada brews, cant wait to try the others!"
"Poured a pale gold that was strongly orange-hued. Also had a huge frothy head, very little carbonation, and a lil' bit o' lace. Smelled of fresh hops and clean malt, but mostly hops oil. Also had some clean and easy scents of grapefruit, all faint and moderate though. Did I mention the hops. Taste is a pleasant refreshing bitter with a soft golden malt underneath. The yeast imparted an earthiness and combines with bitterness; the flipside is that the yeast creates not the best finish. With a smooth watery mouthfeel a touch viscuous from all those hops, this beer has great drinkability. In all a simple quality pale, in fact, the classic."
"Medium body. Excellent malt character along with raw grain flavors. A dry hop infested finish follows. Some people would say this an IPA. I just call it good."
"One of the best session beers around. You can't go wrong here. Grade A drink!"
"This beer pours amber with a fair bit of head. The smell is hoppy with a bit of flower to it. On tasting, it has a fair bit of hoppy taste without overwhelming the rest of the beer. At 5.6% ABV, the alcohol is low enough to be able to have quite a few in a session! This is a classic beer, and with SN's fair bit of distribution should be available just about anywhere."
"This is a rock-solid beer. Consistent, smooth, and full of character without hitting the senses too hard. It's a great ""old faithful"" beer for me. Many bars that don't serve great beer or have vast selections will offer this, so I know that my chances are good that I will be happy at most places. It also goes great with most foods. It pours from the bottle a dark amber with a white head that hangs out for a while and produces fine lacing around the glass. The smell is hoppy and yeasty. The flavor also is hoppy, with some yeast and fruit undertones. Not a strong malt flavor, but there is a lingering bitter hop aftertaste. Very smooth, very drinkable."
"I've reviewed this before in the bottle. Had this on tap at Orleans in Davis Square. This beer is much better on tap. The citrusy (especially grapefruit) aroma is far more accessible, and the same thing goes for the taste. Only problem was that this gave me a great deal of heartburn."
"One of my most frequently consumed beers, in part due to its broad distribution and availability, but also because it is just good. It pours golden amber in color with a nice full white head. The head diminishes rather quickly leaving lacing behind on the glass. A thin layer of fine bubbles linger throughout. An overall very nice looking beer in a glass. In tipping back a glass you are met by a nice aroma of hops with floral undertones. This beer has a great taste, dominated by hops, although a light citrus flavor comes through. This medium bodied beer feels very smooth in the mouth, which in addition to its taste contributes to its high drinkability."
"Had this on tap at a hole in the wall bar in Goshen NY which was a shocker.....Pours out a pale gold color with a thick white head hat slenders down to a thin lace. Aroma was straight up hops and IMO freshly mowed grass. Taste was fresh floral hops, some citrus hops and a balance of malt. Mouth feel was smooth with a slight twist and some carbonation and made this a smooth and easily drinkable beer. I got no bitterness from this beer which made it very enjoyable. Good beer all in all."
"Ultimately, I think that the SN Pale Ale is not delicious but it can be refreshing...if you were very thirsty."
"Nice floral hop aroma with a very subtle earthiness. Some sweetness comes across as well. Pours a deep gold in color with a light tan head. Citrus grapefruit are most evident in the mouth but the beer still has a nice malt backbone. Dry finish with a good hop bite. Medium-light carbonation is very evident. A finely crafted brew."
"A nice clear, tan color with a white head that lingers in parts for most of the pint. Aroma reminds me of walking down the aisle with all the herbs and spices without actually smelling any one single spice; it's subtle and fresh, but it's not terribly powerful. The definition of balanced use of hops, it finishes with a nice crisp and clean hop bite after a malty-to-citrus flavor. The bitterness lingers just for a while. Really easy to drink, this brew isn't spectacular, but it's quite good. And because it's so easy to find even in restaurants that aren't known for beer, it's something of an important brew."
"Clear amber and orange hued color....with an enormous head that ends up one heluva lacer. As far as hops and malt goes, the hops dominate, but the malts are there just enough for an awesome balance. The crispness makes it very drinkable and refreshing. This is definitely one of the best American Pale Ales out there."
"THE fallback beer when i can't get anything else. i consider SNPA to be responsible for helping make me into the beer lover i am today. pours a crystal clear tan with an creamy white head. the taste is a lesson in balance....sweet carmel malts are in perfect balance with PNW hops. a sheer pleasure to quaff that gets even better as it warms. it may seem run of the mill, but is still the best all around semi-mass produced beer."
"This beer came to me a crystal clear golden yellow color that was teaming with tons of dancing bubbles of carbonation. The head that was produces was exactly 1 inch thick, pure white in color and was thick and creamy in nature. The head seemed to last a good way down the glass and produced a sheet like lace at the top and delicately designed lace as it traveled down the inside of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of citrus hops, bitter hops, citrus fruit (lemons, grapefruit), and some sweet malts. The tastes that were produced were creamy in nature, good carbonation and the flavors that came out were of sweet malts, citrus hops, floral hops, fresh fruit (grapefruit), grass, and more hops. The combination of the sweet malt and the hops seemed to keep each other in good balance. It was crisp the whole way through and ended with slight hop dryness. It is a good beer and is a good choice if it is available and a good get when there is nothing good on tap at the local bar."
"Great looking crystal clear gold color with a smallish white head. Slight retention, but very little lace. Full nose citrus hops against an underlying malt base. Very citrus bitter taste that portrays grapefruit and rind. Warming to the innards. This is a very crisp, clean brew with many strong attributes. I am very impressed with Sierra Nevada beers so far and happy that appear easy to find in this part of the country."
"Mouthfeel is good and the beer is extremely drinkable. Always a good choice and I'm glad it is widely available."
"This honey colored brew looked picturesque with it's off white foamy head floating perfectly in my pint glass. Hops! You definitely smell some quality hops with some floral undertones. A nicely hopped beer but is not overpowered by the bite. It's a smooth ale that I have drank plenty of in the past and will continue to drink more of it in the future. A good brew."
"I really like this beer. It pours out with a nice white head, and lacing down the sides. The taste of hops is pretty apparent. I think as far as good beers go, this is a standard that everyone should have at some point. A nice session beer, maybe not the best pale ale in the world, but definately worth getting a 12er of if you havent had it."
"The nose is Cascade all the way, baby! Hints of caramel, too. The front is grapefruit hoppy. There's a little caramel in the middle and just a touch of sweetness at warmer temps. The feel is foamy, then creamy. The finish is hoptastic. Hops linger in the aftertaste, but allow room for some grains. Frak! This is an awesome beer."
"The ol' standby, SN Pale Ale poured a clear, copper color with a decent fluffy head and visually pleasing carbonation. The Cascade hops are very apparent, with a luxurious,strong fruity scent. A mellow sweetness is noticed first, then the powerful hop presence dominates. Definitely a hop-head's beer. A bitter, full taste follows the swallow...very yummy. The medium body leaves a nice fizzle on the tongue. Sharp and very satisfying. This is a wonderful session beer, and its wide distribution allows it to compete with the macros. A model pale ale on the big market today...great beer overall."
"This is yet another exceptional beer from the Sierra Nevada brewery. Pours a clear copper color with a medium sized rocky head that retains itself for the duration, leaving a light lace on the glass. The aroma is full of cascade hops and citrus peel. Taste is extremely hoppy, I cant really describe it much more than that, tons of hops! There was a little bit of a pungent, sour aftertaste. This is definitely a great session beer that can be enjoyed any day of the year."
"All in all, a good (but not great) pale ale that is a good standby."
"Nothing makes me happier to see this beer on tap next to Bud, Guinness and the like at a bar. I consider it the finest mass produced pale ale in the United States. Consistently crisp and refreshingly hopped, with great big lingering head. When I need to stock my refrigerator, in the event that I'm having company or that I just need a reasonably priced drinkin' beer on hand, this is the stuff... that is, unless Celebration Ale is in season."
"This is a fine american ale, and I was surprised, but delighted, to find a six-pack at my local Foodtown (alongside the SN Porter). The pour revealed a dark golden color, and the thin head disappeared slowly and deliberately. The smell was fruity and hoppy, and the taste was likewise, with a lemony overtone and a strong sense of hops in the after taste. Good, clear, and light mouthfeel. A winner!"
"This a standard pale that gets alot of praise and comparison. I was impressed with it, but I have to go with a paler pale for this style. This was a little to hoppy, but overall this is a great taster. Good balanced fresh hops with a bit of citrus and finishes dry and piney. This was actually hard to pin down as far as taste for me due to the finish happened to fast and I was feeling and wanting more. I still thought it was good but something was missing for me on the overall taste. Malt was present. Color was fine for a pale, kinda coppery yellow, with a nice floral aroma with good strong hop presence. I almost liked the smell more then the taste by just a bit. Solid pale, I can see why alot of folks like this stuff. This is a drinkable pale, very good, but needed something for me to really enjoy it fully. I kept a puzzled look on my face after every sip. Why? I'm not sure. Good to great, but not awesome."
"Heckuva nice hop-head's pale ale. A classic."
"Snuck a bottle of this into a sixpack. (How criminal). Nice golden color with good carbonation, hence a great head. Crisp and clean, with a good mix of hops and malts. The pale ""dry"" taste comes through with each sip. Definitely a good beer."
"Notes: The typical American Pale Ale ... The classic American Pale Ale basically as far as what people know. A good and solid ale for what I think."
"This beer is available all over the place, so that shows progress as a culture. It has a nice golden/orange color. The nose is a nice balance of hops and malts. Very clean smelling. There is little to no head, but I think the bartender poured it incorrectly. The beer has good carbonation. The hops selection gives the beer a good overall bitterness that combines well with the plentiful malts. This beer is quite consistent throughout and is quite refreshing. Finishes clean and smooth."
"Slight citrus note to the mainly hoppy aroma. Excellent balance between the hops and malt with a subtle but present caramel flavor. Hazy, golden color, short-lasting head. Lighter color and greater hoppiness distinguish this from English-style pale ales"
"The hops really grab you right away. The hop smell, and the taste. I believe they use Pearle and Cascade hops, a nice combination. If you like hops, it can't be beat, if you like to taste malt, get another brew, or really think of malt and you can find it in there somewhere. The second glass is better, as you begin to get used to, and like the hops. Bottled version not quite so hoppy. Great Beer, these folks know how to brew!"
"I believe that a good Pale Ale matches well with everything -- from cheescake to fajitas, not to mention by itself. Sierra Nevada definitely fits the bill."
"In past years, I'd given this staple micro less credit than it deserves. I thought all pale ales were alike, and this one wasn't extraordinary to warrant the attention it receives. Just buy the local brew, and keep them in business, I thought. I still believe in that , of course, but I must accept that the flavor and quality in SN PA are really special and unique."
"This is a great, highly drinkable pale. You fill your glass and the next thing you know . . . POOF! It's gone. One of my favorites in the style."
"After just finishing a McEwan's IPA, I just found myself in heaven. An magnificant orangish tint, with a nice white frothing head. A very thin lace, but right now it doesn't matter I am too busy enjoying the aroma to worry about how it looks. I could be blind right now and it wouldn't matter. A great citrusy full sharp delivery of wonderful cascade hops fiil me with joy. The staple of American pale ales, and this one is bottle conditioned which adds to the aroma to form a balanced full aroma with the blend of hops, yeast, and malt. The sweetness mixed with the decent amount of bittering hops does wonders for the soul, if the brewery in Chico had a church I might become a cult member. The hops are grapefruit citrusy flavored that tickle the back of the throat and at the same time the warming feeling of acohol crashes upon the palate just right. It is full of flavor and it is just the right texture to deliver the flavors, and it with the medium body this beer is one to be enjoyed all night. A wonderful part of Beer in America has this BAs approval."
"golden-to-amber color, foamy head, good retention. Nice lace throughout. Wonderfully fruity, hoppy aroma and taste. Not overly dry, despite the obvious hop presence. At 5.6% ABV, packs a decent little punch (the hops are noticeable, also) but quite drinkable. I have nothing negative to say about this beer at all."
"The bonus: Available virtually everywhere !!"
"Don't expect, a watered down, fusal alcohol fiasco. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale pours amber with light carbonation welling up from the sides of the glass. Uneventful head comes and goes, with whisper of yeast and balenced hop in the nose. Not too sweet, not too dry. Enough said, this stuff is like buttered sourdough bread."
"Although not my favorite APA (a little too harsh, without enough balancing maltiness, just a little too prickly in the mouth and with a touch of sourness) I still drink quite a bit and will continue to do so for as long as SN remains such a great producer of quality beer."
"Pours pretty nicelly, but doesnt hold a head to well, the smell is good. Has a nice after taste to it , thiough the feel in the mouth is pretty average. I was drinking this with a hang over already so maybe i found the drinkabilty less than i would have in top condition LOL"
"This beer pours a nice amber with about 2 fingers of head. A nice lace covers the side of the glass all the way to the bottem. The head doesn't go down very fast. A nice floral hops smells great on the nose. The taste is hoppy with a floral overtones. This is a very good Pale Ale that is not very full-bodied."
"This is definitely one of the classic american ales on the market, and I was glad to find a six-pack hidden on the shelf of my local supermarket. The pour revealed a nice amber/dark golden color. There was a thin head that disappeared after about a minute, but a nice lace remained until the last sip. The smell was a crisp, sharp one with some nice fruity(citrus??) hops. The first taste revealed more of those hops and a pleasant bitter taste that receded quickly and left a nice dry aftertaste. Overall a very good brew that I would recommend to anyone!"
"F"
"Pours well, keeps a white foamy head throughout, which is impressive. Has a yellow-orange appearance, and smells great. Has an earthy, fruity, all around awesome taste, extremely smooth. The slight bitterness is proven in the aftertaste, but this beer goes good with anything, or any scenario. Sad I didn't try this one this sooner. Awesome brew!"
"Pours a beautiful deep golden hue with a thick off-white head. Head dissapates to a thin layer after a minute or so and leaves a fine white lace. Aroma is nicely balanced with a slight floral odor which is very pleasing. Really clean balanced taste as well with a slight spicy/sweet hop bitterness. Well carbonated and refreshing. A fine example of American pale ale."
"It's hard to believe that I'm just now getting around to reviewing this beer. This was the first American Pale Ale I ever tried and it was an epiphany. I still consider it one of the best and the benchmark for the style. Nice golden color and a decent head and lacing. That wonderful citric hop aroma and the crisp grapefruity taste. Just tart enough and with a nice supple mouthfeel. I could drink this stuff all day. There are hoppier pale ales and there are more complex ones but there are none that are consistently better."
"Being my first time trying this brew or anything from Sierra Nevada I didnt know what to expect.The appearence didnt do much but the smell and flavor is what got me.A great hop and citrus taste accompanied this clear light yellowish orange Ale.It has a high drinkability percent ,but i'd wish it was ust a bit more maltier."
"It has been a while since I have had a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. My loss! This is a good example of what an American Pale Ale should be. Well balanced with all of the ingredients evident in the aroma and taste without one or the other over powering each other. I think I will have another!"
"This ale pours a beautiful honey-gold color with a rocky, off-white head and medium head-retention. The nose is a beautiful bouquet of grass, hops, and citrus with some later notes of yeast and wheat. At palate entry, spicy bitter hoppiness and leafy, floral notes. At mid-palate, yeasty, caramel malt notes appear. As it warms, notes of bread dough and cracker. The mouthfeel suffers from too much ""spritzy-ness"" and the overall flavor is too bright and citrusy. A very good APA, but would benefit from some more depth and earthy, malt balance. The Finish is crisp, clean and dry."
"Great googily moogily!!! This is a very good beer out of the bottle. It is ranked in the Top 5 of best bottled beers I've ever had. I'm usually not this big of a fan of American brews persay, but this is up there with my favorite European beers. I know it may sound crazy, but it's true. I saw that Consumer Reports gave it a good review, so I thought I would try it, and I must say that they know what they are talking about. The taste is ""wheaty"" and has a smooth delivery. It doesn't have a harsh aftertaste and leaves light on the palate. This is a must for anyone who is into wheat ales."
"This brew is a class act! The golden hue of this offering is very deep and mid dark. The body is medium plus, but, it is the taste that gets you and holds on...the taste is of a slight bitterness from the hops which fails to leave, but is more somehow, mellow, crisp. Very rewarding."
"Man, I can drink this beer all day! Nice citrusy taste, moderate carbonation and nice apperance coming out. Dry finish, very refreshing. I must say, if you want a good session beer this is pretty hard to beat."
"This was my first pale ale to try and it wasn't too bad. Had a good light copper color with a decent head. Taste and smell was a hint of spiciness, but mostly sweet. Went down pretty easily. I don't think it belongs in the Top 50, but it is worth have a 6 pack on hand for pale ale drinkers."
"This Pale Ale is a favorite of mine. It truely defines the American Pale Ale style. It pours to a beautiful copper color, with an off-white head that lasts. It forms a nice lace-work as it is sipped down. It has a bit of chill haze as well. The aroma is mainly of a citric, spicey hop nose. On first taste, one first noticies to floral, citrus hop flavors. The hop flavors are balanced out though by a biscuity malt flavor. This beer is light-medium bodied, and finishes with a dry hop bitterness that lingers. Overall, this is one tasty brew, with a exceptional hop and malt flavor."
"Light amber color, lively carbonation, citrus hoppy aroma, balanced medium body west coast pale, gotta love them cascade hops, an enjoyable brew when you can't find anything else."
"Pours a clear medium amber color with a thin white head that quickly dissipates into a nice lace. Nose is composed of hay, grains, and bitter hops. Flavor is a malty bread-like sweetness with fruity notes of grapefruit and lemon and a pleasant bitter aftertaste. It feels crisp and creamy in the mouth and leaves you wanting another. A great pale ale!"
"Good stuff!!! Floral hoppyness on the nose, lots of fruit-lychees, passionfruit, grapefruit, with some tea like qualities. Quite bitter, nice round palate, with a very nice bitter hop finish, a great little quaffer, extreeeemley tasty, lots of hops, light to medium body, easy to get int to."
"Not too shabby. Nice smooth piney flavor. Not quite as smooth as other pale ales I've tried but that's how it's unique and I like that. It's definitely got a very cool, raw edge to it out of the bottle that I don't encounter on draft. Everybody likes this."
"Note: This beer could realistically be rated with straight 5s."
"Had the draught version at California Pizza Kitchen. Considering how widely available this beer is I'm surprised it took me this long to try it. Not the best APA I have had but still better than average. Good bitter hops flavor and somewhat dry. It is nice to know there are actually decent beers at the grocery store."
"Hmm. Those remaining 3 bottles look really lonely......."
"Good, vigorous head. Simple yello-brown color. A big, sticky nose of broad, meaty herbs, like beet tops. The palate displays a mild, well tempoed segue of toasted malt to hop bitterness. There is an overall steamy quality to this beer, reminiscent of a hot tub in a pine forest. Rich, creamy and velvety, easily bearing elements of grain and flower. Alcohol driven but not out of balance."
"Pale copper color and a large, impressive white head with great retention.  Leaves a huge amount of beautiful lace.  Refreshing hoppy aroma of citrus and a bit of pine.  Characteristic pale ale malt aroma behind that, which I assume is from pale grain.  Crisp citrus and pine-like hop character hits first.  Specifically, the initial wave of hop bitterness reminds me of a Christmas tree.  Not far behind is a grain-like maltiness, also very crisp.  Just above medium-bodied, but good and complex.  Hoppy, but still very well balanced.  High drinkability, very refreshing.  Wonderful pale ale that is worthy of being considered one of the nation's top microbrews."
"Pours a light orange color with a 2 finger head that hangs in through half of my SNPA trip and leaves a lace all the way down.  Smells of hops and a light woody smell that gets your mouth watering.  The taste is initially crisp with a taste of bread and tons of hops that is characteristic of S.N.  It has a light bodied mouthfeel and this is a beer that I could drink a few of these bad boys.  Cheers!"
"Bright, clear golden amber in color with a 3/4"" head that holds well, eventually dropping, but leaves a complete surface covering. Very nice.The aroma offers bright, fresh, floral & citrusy hops over a light maltiness. The body is medium-light with a fine, crisp carbonation. The flavor is a combination of tangy, fruity, citrusy hop flavors and a very lightly caramel & biscuit maltiness well backed by bitterness. It finishes dry with a short lingering hoppy bitterness and a bready/biscuity maltiness. Extremely well balanced. Very refined. Crisp & refreshing. Highly drinkable."
"My favorite trait of this beer is the wonderful head atop the beautiful dark amber body when you pour it into a pint glass.  I wish every beer could look this good.  The aroma is a bit of a floral perfume aroma.  You know this one is high on the aroma hops.  Take a sip and you taste just a slight hint of sweetness, and then get more of a grapefruit and lime citrus sensation.  The beer finishes very well.  Bitterness is more prevalent on the finish as the beer warms, but it's not overpowering.  This is a very well balanced beer that even some of my Silver Bullet and Corona drinking friends will finish.  Possibly the best American Pale Ale (Great Lakes Burning River is close).  Get some soon."
"The beer that essentially led me here. SNPA is perhaps my all-time favorite old standby, and for good reason... I just don't know why it's taken me so long to review it. The pour is a light copper with a nice sized bubbly off-white head. The smell is great and features lots of hops, citrus and some yeasty notes. The taste is huge on the hops at first, especially for an APA. This beer is fairly carbonated for the style, and it shows in the mouthfeel, which is rather prickly. To me, this is a very easy drinker and is the trendsetter in the APA style."
"Very appetizing and drinkable. If you're planning to have more than one, be prepared to have food ready because your taste-buds and stomach will be turned on by this beer."
"Light golden amber color with a thick and dense head that a pint glass will barely contain.  The substantial remnants of the head linger to the bootom of the glass; lots of stickly lace, good carbonation.  Strong aroma of grapefruit rind as well as hints of sweet malt.  Begins with sweet malty flavors which are soon overlaid by sharp grapefruit flavors from the hops, finishes with slightly oily hop bitterness, excellent mouthfeel.  A superb pale ale, nothing less."
"I'd never had this until recently, when a six pack was given to me as a gift.  I wil forever be greatfull to Tess, as her present turned me on to a top quality brew.  The hops jump in from the get go and don't leave until the bottle is empty.  There is less sweetness than you expect, but there are hints of it which help to balance out the bitterness of the hops, which is definately present from the beginning of the sip until the beer is swalowed.  The hops aren't overpowering, just up front and even.  It's beer the way it was meant to be.   Absolutely fantastic stuff."
"One of the quintessential American Pale Ales. Simply a classic among American beers."
"This is the beer I drink most consistently and that is due to its own consistency.  Sierra is always good - never had a bad bottle.  The appearance in amber and clear, the smell is good but doesn't really hit me with anything.  The taste is great, with the right amount of hoppiness, doesn't blow you out with hops. Nice head and lacing."
"So much better than ""on-tap"". Not as bitter in the aftertaste and while drinking it. Although the flavor is not as intense as ""on-tap"". With the bottle, it has a balance flavor without the big bite!"
"Although I'll remain a Saranac Pale Ale customer due to significantly lower price, this beer was exceedingly good for the style."
"The beer that created the APA style. Hazy peach color with a persistant lace, slightly sweet cascade hop aroma, and a crisp sweet / bitter balance. I love that I can find this beer just about anywhere... a wonderful, refreshing ale, and a true classic!"
"Everyone's ""benchmark"" American pale ale is well deserving of its reputation. The pale, hazy complexion, the clean malt and Cascades hop flavors and aromas and the tangy finish is always welcome. A very well-crafted brew. If you can make a beer this good, then you are doing just fine."
"Deep clear amber color, large light beige head, and wonerful lace down the entire glass. Malts and hop floral scents dominate. Start is malt sweet, the middle moderate as with the carbonation, just the right amount of bite leading to a spectacular finish which is clean, crisp, dry. An excellent brew."
"A good standby, as it is available almost everywhere.  But there are much better APAs out there."
"I expected this to be extremely hoppy from some of the reviews I read, but found it to be less hoppy than many other brews. The hop flavor is definitely present, but certainly not overpowering. Very smooth and flavorful. Golden amber color with lots of bubbles. A quality beer, and for some odd reason I like the bottle."
"This beer poured a golden amber color and formed a small white head that didn't hold and left little lace. Some carbonation present. If had an aroma of hops with a slight bit of citrus. The flavor was of hops with some malt. A bit of citrus aspect. The finish was slightly sweet/citrus with a bit of a bite. A good beer, but I find the local pale ales on tap to be better as well as some others I had."
"WARNING: This beer may cause they eyebrows of malt lovers to blow off like firecrackers upon the first sip!"
"Aromatics abound from Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, and you will be bound to try this marvelous brew again."
"What else can I say about The Sierra Nevada...hre are a few... The most idealistic golden brown/orange colour.  A fantastic, sticky, chunky, creamy head that keeps full coverage the whole way through while leaving rings in its wake.  Scents have heavy hops and fruits, a pleaseantly soft mixture.  My palate held a perfectly balanced malt base with a less bitter, more complex hop profile.  A fantastic, velvety smooth, medium body.  This brew drinks the best so far!  This beer nearly shoots through my ratings roof, held back only by my imagination's ideal of unrealized brews to come (or, sadly, never).  My best so far.  Cheers!"
"Nice, lacy head and effervescence that remains to the bitter (and fruity) end.  Pleasant and well-integrated mix of flavors and good mouthfeel make this a versatile, very drinkable beer."
"drank a few at work on a hot summer day with the wind at my back and the sun in my face. it was a special day, and this was not quite a special beer. i am not a huge fan of pale ales, but it was pretty good. i won't be a return customer, but it was good for a day"
"This is a real staple when it comes to pale ales.  This brew is crisp and clean, with a mild hop aroma.  This was the first pale ale I got into when I started drinking beer.  From the initial sip to the bottom of the glass, it is clean and refreshing with a very balanced amount of hoppy flavor and aroma.  A solid brew for any HopHead starting out."
"This beer is one of the better Pale Ales I have tried.  The color is very pleasing and pairs well with almost any food or alone.  Not much aroma here but very easy to drink and would recommend it highly...........CHEERS"
"I'm sorry to all the fans of this brew but I find it overated.  I just don't buy it Prefer the smoother british beers. As for American Ales, I'll take Anderson Valley and North Coast. I realize I had underated this brew quite seriously.  While I have upped it's numbers I still feel it is a vastly overated beer.  I'll jump over this beer to get at Bear Republic, North Coast, and English ale without hesitation."
"I found it hoppy enough to be just barely this side of an IPA, although still nicely balanced by a pleasant malt flavor. I realize now what all the fuss about Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is about."
"One of the original micro-American Pale Ales, I remember scoring a sixer of this way back in 1984 (I'm on the East Coast) Seems to me to have become a little sweeter, a little more tame since I first discovered it. Pours nicely into the glass with a tight white head, with a golden color after things settle down. Nose is a bit yeast/fruity, with mellow hoppiness detected. Taste is sweetly malty, fruity with oh-so-sublte Cascade hops leaving their mark. Smooth, medium-bodied, and a pleasure to drink."
"Rocky, white head that rises above the glass. Golden orange body revealing nice carbonation. Yeast particles floating down against the bubbles. Excellent lacing. Bracing floral and citric hop nose. Plenty of malt backbone to hang the hops on. This beer has balance, though it definitely leans to the hop side. Some grapefruit, but not enough for puckering. A beer I could (and have) drank all night. Not an example of an American Pale Ale, but the beer which defined the style. We must be careful not to take a craft brew cornerstone like this for granted. I am a grateful man that my favorite restaurant has this on tap."
"This light amber brew throws out dense white head that clings nicely to the glass as I drink. Wonderful blast of hops on the nose. Tasting this is a treat. Great hop character. And great understated bitterness. Underlying malt is sufficient. Pretty clean tasting for an ale. A very quaffable brew. One of my favorite Pale Ales."
"Crisp and hoppy with a light amber color. Not much of a head to start with but still very refreshing.  Kind of jumps in your mouth.  There is a slight floral and fruity smell that isn't over powering.  Great on a hot day."
"My new favorite pale ale. The perfect balance of hops, sweetness and citrus.  The rust colored brew seemed a little weak on the nose... but it's Texas in Spring so it could be my nose that's the problem. The beer itself was pleasantly herbal and peppery.  For me the finish on the beer seemed to mimic a big slice of grapefruit, it was really wonderful."
"Another one of my favorites, revisited it recently. I think it is the standard for American Pale Ales. Looks very inviting with orange/yellow color and off white head. Perfect hoppy smell matched with the fruit and florals. The taste is maybe on the hop side for some, but I find it perfectly balanced, flavorful, and refreshing. SN always produces a quality product, and this one is readily available. This matches well with all foods, and I recommend it to newbies like me."
"Light golden orance in color with a hint of cloudiness.  Smells like orange blossoms and somewhat fruity.  Slightly hoppy with a nice malt sweetness, kinda has a fruit taste to it.  Very refreshing."
"This is a resolutely enjoyable beer.  Appears as a very pale, clear, burnt-golden color with small wisps of yeast swirling beneath the head.  Crisp hops aroma and bitterness.  This beer deserves praise as an example of rock-solid craft brewing consistency."
"Sierra Pale Ale:  Good looking beer, cloudy caramel, had a big white head that disappeared in a few minutes.  Wonderful aroma, sweet, with a little hoppiness.  Hits the tongue with a little sweetness, and then a nice bitter hop bite.  Several sips later, it seems the hops dominate.  I can tell this is a fine beer, but the bitterness is a touch to much for me."
"Beautiful gold color, fresh hop taste, malt tries a bit in the middle but gives up to the hops for the finish.  Very refreshing and unique.  As the beer warms the malt does come out a bit more to make the beer balanced.  A take-no-prisioner pale ale!"
"I grabbed this with huge expectations. I heard all this wonderful stuff but I was sorely dissapointed. It doesn't have a lot of character. It's rather run-of-the-mill. The exception being it didn't leave any aftertaste so it was readily drinkable with a meal. I feel like I should be at a farm when I have any pale."
"Pours a nice amber color with a decent head,  hops are in your face.  This is the beer that got me into hoppy pale ales, I love it, and it is readily available in my area.  What else can I say...  A real good beer to convert your macro friends."
"SN Pale Ale is an American classic: full of hops and topped with a beautiful white head. Out here on the west coast, it can be found in just about any drinking establishment, even those that stock primarily macrobrewed lagers. I've never had a bad one."
"I can drink it all day and all night and sometimes do."
"This has to be one of the best examples of an American Pale Ale out there.  Pours a nice orangey-gold with a nice creamy head.  Smell is nice citrusy/floral hops from the cascades.  Huge cascade hop flavor that is nicely balanced by some malt.  The malt is not strong enough to really be perceptable but it prevents the beer from getting out of balance.  A nice crisp and clean mouthfeel and the beer is highly drinkable.  As I said before, almost a perfect example of an APA.  Highly recommended to all."
"12 Fl Oz Bottle.  Golden color with a slight tint of amber.  Not huge head retention but, a constantly laced glass.  The smell of hop mflowers fill your head.  Thick malty mouth feel and taste followed by hoppy bitterness.  The finish mellows into a grassy/flowery/malty feeling of taste bud satisfaction.  I can't think of a better mass produced American macro-brew product."
"The thick, almost rocky, ivory -  white head is well retained.  It sits atop a very clear darker golden bubbly brew.  Although the (ubiquitous in APAs) citrusy Cascade nose dominates the aroma, it is actually quite soft and pleasant.  Not at all grapefruity, the Cascade hop nose is very appealing and clean. I've noticed dry hopping with Cascades leaves that ""grapefruity"" flavor/ aroma; Sierra Nevada uses a lot of late addition hops for aroma in their PA and doesn't dry hop.   This brew is clean and well balanced all around.  The assertive and clean hop bitterness dominates, but a firm maltiness manages to provide an adequate foundation for the hops.  Yes.  This is is the defining example for the style, although it's much better on tap."
"It's a beer. Typical smell, bitter hop flavor. Not bad for the style. Unfortunately, I'm just not a big fan of the style."
"This beer has established itself as a 'staple beer' of those in America who take their beers at least a little bit seriously.  It's right up there with Anchor Steam, although they taste quite different.  Definitely a bitter hoppy beer.  When I started moving past Bud Light, this was the beer that tempted me away."
"cloudy orange/golden color with little yeasties floating around. pours a thin head which sticks to the glass the whole way down. smells of those cascade hops....citrusy and moderately pungent.  mouthfeel is fuller than expected and tastes wonderful.  bitter hops and slightly bready with a bitter aftertaste.  more depth than i was expecting too.  very tasty!"
"This is a super-solid beer, plenty of complexity, easy to drink.  Doesn't make the mistake that too many American Pales do by relying way too much on hops and hops only."
"The color is a pale gold with a frothy white head that diminishes rather quickly. Very hoppy ( not as much as Hopdevil which I also had ) , citrus, light sweetness, yeasty aroma. Flavor is citrus up front as well as bitterness, very hoppy, and moderately acidic.Finishes dry and bitter.  Not as smooth as I would have liked but still a great brew!"
"Revolutionary.  Second to Sam Adams in availablity, second to none in quality.  The definition of fall-back beer.  Went perfectly with the slice of pizza I just had for lunch."
"Pale golden color, frothy white head that diminishes fairly quick.  Hoppy, citrus, slightly sweet, some floral tones, yeasty, aroma.  Flavor is citrus, bitter, hoppy, slightly yeasty and moderately acidic. Finish is bitter and slightly dry.  Could have been balanced better.  I would have like to have experienced more malt. Overall this is a good beer however it is not my style of beer.  Too hoppy for my taste but I enjoyed it all the same."
"golden beer that foams to a thin lacy white head, no chill haze. Smells like citrus with a leaning towards grapefruit and faint elements of yeast. Clean crisp malt character and an aggressive floral hop taste upfront, with the malt dying down and the hops prevailing on the palate afterward. Slightly lacking in malt character in my opinion, which makes this beer slightly unbalanced with the hop bitterness and strong hop aroma."
"To my tastes, over rated...amber color, nice floral scent and a floral hop finish...an expiration date would be nice, since I'm never sure how much yeast I should expect in the bottle and unless you really know the demographics of your liquor store, you don't know how fast it sells...OK, Sierra Nevada Pale is good and complete (doesn't lack in taste or complex mouthfeel) and many people's idea of a Pale, I just like ones that ends on a chewy, fruity note..."
"42"
"And by the way, this is one beer I recommend in a bottle rather than on tap."
"My steady bitter companion.  Very consistent and reasonably priced for such a classic.  I love the yeast sediment and floral hoppiness!"
"The gold standard for widely available American brews. This is the beer, after Sam Adams, that get many people to explore ""better beers"" and to educate the beer drinker as to what a hop is acutally supposed to be used for. Pours out to a nice, amber color in the glass with a decent head. Aroma is that of slight spice, malt and light hops. The malt to hop balance is incredible for a beer of this style and makes for a very tasty beer that isn't overhopped as many of the style are. Starts somewhat malty and finishes with a wondeful taste of hops. Sierra Nevada is an excellent brewer. The Pale Ale is a champ and a staple of my 'fridge."
"What is to say?!? The more I write the more I want to run to fridge to get another (just to make sure I am reviewing it properly).  If you like ales, this is a fine one."
"Excellent brew."
"One of my favorite beers.  I don't think it has lost anything years ago."
"This is the beer that I keep on hand for those who aren't in to the more exotic.  Clean, consistent and flavorful, with a significant hop bite to boot.  And $12 per 12-pack won't break the bank."
"An American classic. Good fall back beer, or one to enjoy when a less complex brew is desired."
"Great hops in the ""API"" style."
"Maybe the best beer I've ever had out of a keg.  no slouch from a bottle either, though.  very nice."
