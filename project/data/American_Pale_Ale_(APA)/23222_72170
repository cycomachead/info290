Taste follows suit with citrus and mango. Mild malt on back end fading crisp and clean. Feel / carbonation is spot on. Lives up to the hype-my clear standout from a pale ale tasting that included other TG offerings and those from other breweries. Wish I could drink this much more often!","AppaZappa","Mar 21, 2015"

I've only poured two beers down the drain because I couldn't finish them and this was one of them. The other beer I poured down the drain was a strong German Eisbock. The first drink of this beer wasn't horrible, grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit and some more grapefruit. There was some hop bitterness on the aftertaste on the first drink but nothing crazy. As I continued drinking this beer the grapefruit was becoming so intense and obnoxious it wasn't enjoyable at all. The aftertaste was very funky and long lasting. I have no idea how this beer is ranked 100!! I bought two bottles to share with two of my friends and neither of them could finish it as well. I was so excited to try this beer and it was a total failure in my book. It's hard to say because this is a loved beer by many but this is one of the worst beers I've drank. I'm going to give it another shot, maybe in the brewery.","thetravelguy01","Mar 05, 2015"

In all seriousness, this is a phenomenal beer that deserves all the hype it gets.  For us it doesn’t quite dethrone the likes of Zombie Dust in the area of the American Pale Ale, but it comes damn close.  From the first whiff through that first sip you are wrapped up in a world of insanely juicy, dripping wet citric hoppiness that offers just the right amount of sweetness and bitterness to the last drop.  If anything, the mild lightness of feel held the beer back from being the best, most invigoratingly flavorful experience it could have been, but here we’re just talking about why it isn’t “perfect fives” across the board.  Nit picking, if you will.   We obviously had to pick up a growler of this gal, and savored it, as incredibly hard as that was, over the next couple of days on our journey across the frozen Midwest.  PseudoSue is the best we’ve tasted from Toppling Goliath, and an absolute must-try.","TheBrewo","Jan 30, 2015"

The flavors bring in very similar qualities of Three Floyds Zombe Dust , perhaps a hybrid of, once again, Three Floyds Alpha King and Alpine Nelson based on their underlying effects. Burst of dank hops, orange, melon and some honey sweetness from the malts to balances this beer out. There is a slight bitterness in the back finish which brings this a bit more closer to an IPA rather than a pale ale. In addition to the creaminess, there is a medium body to this. Overall, a very fine pale ale - if not the best I've had in a while.","CuriousMonk","Jan 17, 2015"

Had I not drank them one after another they would probably have blown my mind, and truly my mind is blow, to have the opportunity to try these beers one after another and both be fresh. I have to give a big thank you to my trader friend from Iowa who got these to me. Cheers man! Top notch beer, no doubt, if you can find it get it!","humuloner22","Dec 01, 2014"

It has all of the beer components nailed. The citra hop really shines in this beer. The wonderful marriage of subtle sweetness, and a citrusy punch gives this beer great balance. Notes of citrus and cantaloupe just make this beer sing. This is World Class.","WynnDavis","Sep 05, 2014"

4.97,8.3,,,,,,"My biggest 'want' finally goes down the ol' gullet! Pours a slightly hazed yellowy-orange color with a tight, white head. Soft lacing. Aroma is very unique. I got a big whiff of garlic and green onion along with some mossy aromas and a bit of cattiness. Melon and mango as well. I know this is Citra but in the nose, the hop comes off differently and I love it. The flavor legit blew me away. Each sip made me say ""wow"" even louder. The green onion and garlic and cat and hemp is more subdued than the nose. Instead, I get a huge rush of tropical fruit. I've had plenty of Citra brews but this one is very distinguished. It has lots of tropical fruit but the flavor of honeydew melon is so damn rich. Very grassy. I also got a minty flavor that put this one over the top for me. Unlike any other Citra brew I have tried. The body is just hovering around medium. The carbonation is lively. The bitterness isn't too bold but it pricks up quickly. I have had a few from Toppling Goliath and all I have tasted have been phenomenal. This one exceeded my ridiculously lofty expectations. One of the best beers I have had. Enjoyed via bottle.","VelvetExtract","Sep 01, 2014"

Pink grapefruit flesh, a flash of pine and resin and then a smooth finish with pine and mango. The finish lingers forever, but never leaves you with any kind of bitterness. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had.","notchucknorris","Jul 11, 2014"

Aroma of big Citra hops, pineapple mango grapefruit, grass and piney notes, sweet honey. Oh yes. The flavor. Oh my god. Lightly sweet maltiness with massive pineapple mango hop presence, very light bitter. Some super raw hop vegetal notes. Juicy and resinous, easy going, medium plus carbonation , lightly dry finish. Oh my lord. I got goosebumps when this first hit my lips. Expected this to be very good but maybe not quite live up to the hype. I was wrong--this is essentially perfect.

It reminds me of ZD in the way the fruit is so aggressive without kicking into that level of pungency and bitterness that you get from an IPA. It's one of those beers for which the taste is so refreshing that it's easy to take big draws out of the glass because it almost gives the impression that it's quenching your thirst. I'm halfway tempted to sit on my second bottle for a month or so to see if the opacity, nose and taste change significantly, as it's not often that I've gotten a hop-forward ale that was this fresh. I say halfway tempted because it's so good that I doubt I'm going to have that kind of willpower.","LambicPentameter","Beers"

Aroma is of strong citrus, lemon, floral and mangoes. Flavor is outstanding! Real lush mango, lemon rind, plump citurs fruit, juicy, refreshing, creamy. So very good, tastes like real hop fruit.

The pour is inviting with a deep golden body and foamy head. The smell jumps out of the glass as sweet citrus, orange juice, and five alive. The best way to describe the taste is like Squirt with TANG added to it. It's just that juicy and sweet. The only critique I'd have is that the sweetness would hold me to 2 glasses or the 22 oz bomber. Nothing wrong with that at all, but I just couldn't throw these back all day.","PHBoiler","Mar 23, 2014"

I personally love the Citra hop as is, and Toppling Goliath has done something truly wonderful with it here. This one has a very nice soft, carbonated mouthfeel.

Sure there will be some nice lacing as the beer goes down. Smell is really fruity, definitely some grapefruit, guava, orange, and a tiny bit of sweetness from the malts. Taste is better than I remember the last time I had it on tap. Seems to have all I found in the nose in the mouth with a little more quava and sweet fruit. The mouthfeel is quite thick for the style to be sure which is nice, Overall I think I got a bad pour before from the tap or had too high expectations because I really love this beer this time around.","NeedBeerHere","Jan 22, 2014"

The smell is incredible, fruity and slightly floral, Citrus and Melon aromas fill the air just from pouring out of the bottle, no need to even smell it from the glass. The taste is about as amazing as the smell. Beautifully balanced sweetness mixed with some piney hop resin with juicy fruits filling in the gaps. The mouthfeel is about as smooth and drinkable as I've ever had. This beer is dangerously drinkable. Overall it's fantastic, I am thrilled to have drank this beer.

The aroma on this was truly out of this world, I got a blast of fresh tropical fruits from across the room...didn't even have to hold it to my nose. I'm actually kind of skeptical that this was exclusively Citra, as I've never gotten quite an intense nose from that hop by itself. But yeah, pineapple, mango, orange, grass, twinge of ammonia. Whatever the case, excellent. The taste wasn't quite as blasting or intense, but pretty much more on line for a good APA. More citrusy, orange blossom, caramel malt sweetness, good balance, low bitterness, with a more low-key tropical fruit profile. Medium body, crisp, clean mouthfeel. I prefer a little acidic twist in my APA, but this didn't really have that, with the malt profile coming out more and providing more of a balance and toning down the hop profile a bit. Very nice overall. Not really uber-extraordinary for the style, but still quite good.","Rifugium","Aug 18, 2013"

I find Zombie Dust to be a better showcase of the citra hops, but unlike Zombie Dust, pseudoSue has quite a bit more balance that makes it simultaneously sweet and bitter, as well as making it quite quaffable because I'm not mouthpuckering after each swallow. So basically its a bit less intense, but is more balanced and drinkable.

If it had done so, this would be a beer to have on hand at all times. As it is, it is a good APA, but certainly not among the best out there. Many people seem to want to compare this to Zombie Dust (both being pale ales that focus on Citra hops), and while there are similarities, Zombie Dust this is not. Still, for $5 a bomber, one cannot go wrong with giving this beer a shot. 16.5/20","THANAT0PSIS","Apr 23, 2013"

4.74,3.3,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Jesus, what a stunner of a beer. Poured from a 22oz bomber from the first bottling run. Hazy gold and orange, a dash of white foam and good lacing. Juicy, stanky aromas float from the glass. Cattiness, mints and mangoes jump out. The taste follows the nose, with lots of spearmint, citrus, tropicalia, and herbs. The mouthfeel is slick, wet and full. Overall, an absolute winner from the new school of American Pale Ale.","sacrelicio","Apr 20, 2013"

The rest of the beer forms a perfect stage for those hops, with a lightly dry feel and a mildly sweet base. Reminds me a lot of Zombie Dust, and that's a big compliment. An incredibly tasty, sessionable pale ale.","zeledonia","Apr 14, 2013"

The aroma is very fruity with lots of passion fruit, tangerine, and a hint of grapefruit. The taste is similar to the aroma. It even has a pleasant impression of fruity acidity. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a fine beer that I would highly recommend.","KarlHungus","Apr 01, 2013"

4.49,-2.2,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The citra hop is responsible for turning a non hop head into a guy who can really appreciate the great aroma and taste of non-bittering hops. Heard great things about the brews from Toppling Goliath so jumped on the chance to pick up a growler of this single hop citra APA. The first pour from the growler into a pint glass is colored golden with an orange hue with a slight haze present. Tiny bubbles merge into a finger of white head that quickly recedes into a skim layer while sticking to the glass nicely. Aromas of the citra pop out of this brew. Grapefruit, pineapple and mango on top of a clean crisp malt bill. Taste is big time citra-especially the tropical fruit character hits me upfront with a hint of evergreen, than followed up with a bit of malt and sweetness ending with a crisp slight bitterness that quickly cleans up inviting the next drink. Medium bodied and carbonated with 0 alcohol bite. Super drinkable...this is like candy. Yep-I love citra hops. A super brew. This would likely be a regular in my fridge if I could easily get it.","deebo","Mar 30, 2013"

Aroma is a startlingly fresh hop, reminiscent of weed plus some sweet malt, citrus, resin. Flavor's much like nose, bitterness stands out; just enough malt and carbonic tang to balance for a kick butt IPA. Body and carbbonation are faultless. Finiish is like flavor, long, and drrikable.
