Fruity aroma with grainy, bready malt similar to a Munich Helles. Hops come through with citric notes of lime and earthy tones underneath. there are additional notes of cinnamon slight clove golden raisins and Moscato grape sweetness. The body comes off as light and dry with lively carbonation. Flavor profile is balanced, not overly sweet but with a pleasant hop bitterness lingering on the palate.","Forzabrew","Jan 11, 2015"

Not very bitter at all, but just enough for the overall lightness of the malt.  Grassy and lemony, with a bit of a peppery herbal tint.  The malt is pretty unremarkable, very clean and unobtrusive, clearly intended to showcase hops without getting in the way.  The more I drink it, the more peppery flavor I'm getting.  It really shares a lot of characteristics of a witbier, in terms of mouthfeel and a strangely peppery tingle in the finish.  It's a really well-made beer, and something I'd want to drink while relaxing on the beach in the middle of summer.  Not the cheapest beer at $6 a bottle, but it is good.  Artistry is usually expensive.","UnionMade","Oct 14, 2014"

3.96,-3.6,4,4.25,3.75,4,4,"My love affair with this brewery continues with this light hazy yellow offering, poured into a standard pint glass and topped with a copious amount of creamy white head that may have left some of the most intricate lacing I've seen on a beer glass, extending all the way from top to bottom. Aroma is sublime, very hop-forward with a hint of cracker-like malt, lemon, lime, grapefruit, and a little tropical guava perhaps along with a rock candy-like sweet undercurrent. Was hoping the taste would match this assertive aroma, but alas this is one of those times where the aroma drives much of the pleasurable experience that is drinking this beer. Not that the taste is poor, far from it. Quite dry and crisp, though, with little of the caramel malt flavor prominent in this brewery's IPAs, this being replaced by dry crackers, sourdough crust, and a whiff of grainy tannins. Hop flavor translates (to me) as unsweetened lemon-lime soda, an effect heightened by the intense carbonation. Still struck by how dry this is, with some minerals apparent in the green, near-leafy finish. Lovely aroma and crisp mouthfeel would bring me back.","CalgaryFMC","Jul 12, 2014"

The nose is very subdued and lacking in aroma. Taste is dry hops with some light, crisp malt profiles. The malt disappears and becomes more dry wheat and hops. Very simple...not very complex. Mouthfeel is light and dry. Drinkability is high. Overall, this beer is ridiculously drinkable...just not a very memorable pale ale. I would take a Daisy Cutter over this ANY DAY.

A little more bitterness upfront than expected, but the following hoppiness is very nice. Again, super oily and zesty lemon, light grapefruit, melon, perfume-y floral notes, and grass. Light, slick, and crisp with a long bitterness. A good, textbook APA that while full of hop flavor, doesn't try to be an IPA. Too bad I only had the one small bottle and it was as bit pricy because this is a very drinkable beer.","wedge","Oct 13, 2013"

The malt balances against the hops with a feeling more dry than I was expecting. Some spots where must and yeast contrast against the citrus. I want to say I sense a bit of spice. Something in here feels a bit Belgian in that way. Can't pin it down. My palate might be giving me a false positive here but I keep getting that taste of light spice. Anyway...this dries out a little on the aftertaste. It seems to feel both light and then not in the same moment. Intriguing, and it keeps me sipping to see what's next. The citrus hits and then pulls back. Perhaps a bit of green apple. This is a beer that does a lot without seeming to work at it. It's put together well and very solid all around. Several pale ales want to play like IPA and hit you hard but not this one. It's a really nice and I'd be happy to have it again. The price being 1 or 2 dollars less than other MBC bottles gives better odds for a return engagement.","jujigatame","Sep 20, 2013"

4.44,8,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"this is what American pale ale should be. another absolute gem from Vermont, this time a bottle shop, and actually a beer from maine, not Vermont itself, but man I wish I could get these ales out west. Vermonters don't know how good they have it with distro and the like, or maybe they do... in any event, this is a real special beer, spring seasonal im guessing by the name. it pours a light frothy honey color with sexy lace along my goblet sides. the nose and taste are both really fresh, big bright hops ranging from vegetative to grassy to floral to citric and finally brisk and bitter. its almost the full spectrum, and its a joy to drink a beer this easy down and packed with flavor. malt is in supporting roles only, crackery backbone, nothing more. the hops are light, but pungent at the same time, loosely acidic, with some springtime thawing sort of quality. this is a major refresher with a very light body, a creamy but well carbonated feel, and a cruisy 5.5% abv. there is very little to critique about this beer, easily one of the best pale ales ive had in years. the east coasters are onto something here with the mighty hop flower.","StonedTrippin","Jul 01, 2013"

Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and floral aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice bright citrus aroma and flavor.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 13, 2013"

We all get so used to the flavor bombs like Zombie Dust and come to expect everything else to stylistically match that type of take. Here we are taken in a bit of a different direction. Things are kept close to home and earthy, with the malts bold and dark enough to hold against the bittering bite and grit of the hops through both the aroma and the taste. Fruit and yeast help to smooth things out around the edges, making for a highly drinkable, highly approachable, American pale.","TheBrewo","Jun 08, 2013"

A fine choice for warmer weather. Fresh hops and a healthy bitterness gain strength in the finish. A very tasty brew. I can't understand why the individual bottles of this are so expensive. While this is certainly tasty, I simply don't understand the $8 price tag I've seen in the DC metro area. That's more expensive than a bottle of Bourbon County Brand Stout.

This is the kind of thing you want to drink out of tallboy cans all summer long without getting trashed. Amazing. So refreshing and awesome. Definitely worth seeking out, if you’re a fan of pale, hoppy beers, light and bright session-ish beers (I know it’s over 5% ABV, relax), crisp American ales, or just life in general.","fmccormi","Feb 17, 2013"

Nose smelled like fresh-baked lemon bread. Yeasty, zesty, bready, all of the above. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a lemon zest flavor immediate on the tongue. It really did taste like lemon bread, something that I have not baked in many years. I used to have aspirations of becoming a chef, but my Navy recruiter talked me out of the kitchen and while I know how to cook, I rarely do so. Finish was semi-dry with the lemony flavor allowing the malt a chance to bring some sweetness to the whole affair.

Crisp hops hit you first with a clean finish. An excellent pale ale that is quite drinkable! No bad aftertaste. Wish I could taste it fresher, I'd imagine it'd naturally be hoppier.

Served from bottle into a COAST Willi. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a two finger white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, pine hop, spice, spicy hop, grass, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, pine, pine hop. Fruit hop, earth, earth hop, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. While this one had a lot going on in it, it really managed to stay pretty well balanced in both the aroma and flavor. The flavor was fairly light and crisp which made it really easy to drink and rather refreshing. Really glad I got the opportunity to give this one a try and I hope to try more from this brewery in the future as well.","thagr81us","Nov 27, 2012"

4.03,-1.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Incredible structure to the white head on this. It leaves shelves of lacing behind as it chases the clear amber beer down to the bottom of the glass. And right away you get the hops in the nose. Very juicy with ripe citrus with an underpinning of pine and some cracker for substance. The hop profile in the taste is a little different, starting off with fresh pine with the citrus backed off a bunch and then a tropical essence coming through in the wash. The malts don't come off as sweet in the taste but are more forceful in their biscuity flavor. The body is on the lighter side of medium, giving it a crisp snap on the first sip and I'd call this beer refreshing if not for the long, bitter aftertaste. Excellent effort from Down East, but what do you expect from a brewery out of Portland?","Naugros","May 25, 2012"

Aroma of floral and citrus hops is quite amazing with light sweet cereal notes also detectable. Taste is a superb mix between some floral hops notes mix in with some notes of light cereal. Mix of citrus and floral hoppy notes is just about perfect. Body is about average with good carbonation. I really liked this beer and I guess the East coast breweries are not catching up on West coast brewery about adding hops into beer being more then just about bitterness.","Phyl21ca","May 23, 2012"

The taste was similar and although the beer thoroughly bathed your palate in bitter hoppiness, it wasn't unpleasant...it was highly drinkable.

Finishes dry and clean, but doesn't leave your mouth dry... even so, you absolutely need to take another sip.

Nose is pure grapefruit and pine with a passing sweet malt. A beautiful snow cap of head remains after 5 minutes. Malts more pronounced as it warms. Taste is bitter hops, some citrus. Not getting any malt in the mouth. Mouthfeel is medium so the malts must be at work but the flavor is carefully concealed by the delicious hops.

The aroma is very citrus forward with oranges and grapefruit at the forefront. There is also a bit of caramel sweetness in the nose. The flavors are well balanced, maybe swinging a bit farther to the sweet, malty side than I would usually prefer. There is a mild bitterness, and lots of grapefruit citrus hops along with a big malty caramel backbone. Mouthfeel is medium with very nice carbonation. Very pleasant.

There's a very dry hoppiness and again, a bit of biscuit malt. Theres a bit of graininess. The hop flavor is a bit odd. Leaves a substantial amount of dry bitterness on the tongue, some of which is unpleasant. Good carbonation. Certainly this has more impact than a normal pale ale, but it doesn't really work for me.

3.97,-3.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy orange with a brownish tint. Lots of foamy white head. Really not a pretty beer at all. Smells hoppy but in a really enjoyable way. lemon and fresh grass on the nose. Tastes bitter and lemony. I'm not sure if there is actual lemon zest or something in this but the bitterness seems to be from something other than the hops. Maybe I'm wrong. Feels strong for 5.5 percent. The carbonation is great though and there is a nice sweetness that balances the bitter. Overall, decent. It grows on me as I drink it but not something that stands out to me as a favourite","Urbancaver","Oct 13, 2011"

For my first Maine Beer Co. beer, this was exceptional. I really can't wait to give more of their beers a swirl, as I would rank this among the best pale ales I've had.

4.18,1.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a lovely, hazy orangish-gold with a very generous three finger crown that clings to every single bit of glass it can as it recedes down the depths of the glass. The smell is very subtle. Light hops with some real nice and balanced citrus notes. Unlike some other APA's I've had, this doesn't try to pose as an IPA. The taste mirrors the nose with some light hops, and a nice upfront citrus profile. This is so smooth. The mouthfeel is awesome. It leaves the tongue with a tinge of creaminess and some lingering citrus. It's not at all bitter. Overall this is a very nice beer.

4.2,2.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This brew pours a slightly hazy, deep gold color with a huge, meringue like white head of small, bubbles. The head retained all the way down to the bottom of the glass and nice lacing was left behind. The nose is delightfully citric with bits of orange, tangerine, lime, yeast, and dust. The taste is pleasantly mild and bitter with soft floral notes, citrus peel, and Orval-esque yeast notes. Light to medium in body with very high, aggressive carbonation. So aggressive in fact it takes away some of the subtleties of this beer. it is a very nice brew that I certainly recommend and wish I had greater access too.","cosmo4u","Aug 28, 2011"

4.03,-1.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Mmmm. It's a bright, crisp pale ale with a herbal pine and lemon and then a clean, juicy grapefruit finish. The bitterness approaches an IPA (and probably surpasses a few lesser one), but the body still on the more drinkable side of the style. It's certainly lighter than SNPA, for example. I'd love to take care of a few bottles of this.","tempest","Aug 20, 2011"
4.23,2.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"So it goes with the taste. It's a great flavor, but not quite APA style...I'm being picky. Some floral and overripe apple, citrus, green pine. Nice bite to it, crisp and clean. Easily quaffable at 5.5%.","Mebuzzard","Aug 19, 2011"
4.3,4.6,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall: This is definitely a beer I could have as a regular drink. It's a ""mowing the lawn"" beer. After a hard day of work, I would pop this brew open to refresh myself and relax while I watch an Arsenal game, which is an oxymoron because if you watch Arsenal play, it's hardly relaxing at all. But, I digress. This beer is great, it has a respectable ""drinkability"" that would put commercial beers to shame.","nmbr0ne","Aug 19, 2011"
4.15,1,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a clearish straw color with a dirty white head. Started off with about 2 finger head that faded to a thin layer. It clung fairly well. Aroma was a fruity sweet with a delicate hop undertone. Reminded me of a fresh melon. Taste was smooth and fairly clean. Slightly flowery, once again seemed to finish as a clean melon flavor. Nice and delicate. Felt ok in the mouth. Seemed a tad over carbonated for the rest of the beer. Coated nicely for the style. Overall a pretty awesome beer. Not my style of choice, but a very nice well balanced palette pleaser.","mountdew1","Aug 19, 2011"

I've come to love beer through the company of my brother so I was charmed by the story of their brewery too.

Sheeting along the side of the glass I sip from. The aroma is of malts married with slightly citrusy hops, a bit of grassy hops too. The flavor is more pale ale then many pale ales I've head, that is to say balance. Balance of bitter and malty biscuit like quality. A bit of citrus and grass makes an apperance in the flavor. Clean plan yeast flavor, a bitter and clean finish. What more is there to say. Well carbed, round mouthfeel a good pale ale period. Nothing about this beer is average or above average, its good, period.","pmlondrigan","Aug 16, 2011"

This pale ale is hop-forward with a sturdy malt backbone which leaves the finish slightly sweet (with a balancing bitterness). Notes of mint and black tea linger in the finish. It's fairly full-bodied with a great creaminess. Carbonation is spot-on. Overall a beefed-up pale ale.","turnstile","Aug 10, 2011"

Head eventually recedes into a solid quarter inch cap with thick, textured waves of lacing adhering to the shoulders of the glass. Nose expresses pale malts, citrus and earthy hops. Taste follows nose - a trace of caramel malt manages to peak through the characteristics revealed in the nose. Finishes with a light, lingering earthy/herbal hops finish and a kiss of citric acid. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with a lively carbonation. The citrus nicely stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks before culminating in a pleasant, crisp finish. What can I say, this is just an all around solid APA with lots of flavor.","Jwale73","Apr 21, 2011"

Grass and lemon come through immediately in the nose, along with a bit of chamomile, very herbal smelling overall. Extremely interesting flavor profile in that there isn't any one taste that is jumping out at you. Yeast, sourdough bread, grass, pepper, and lemon rind all come to mind. All of these are in the background, almost ghostly tasting if that makes any sense. Mouthfeel is stellar, coming off light, yet full of complexities. Drinkability is great, though I recommend taking your time with this one to see how it changes as it warms. This is by far one of the most interesting brews to hit shelves here in a long time.

Reminded me a lot of Cisco Whale's Tale: nice hoppy aroma up front but with some mild creaminess in the taste and mouthfeel. Swirled up the sediment for the last little pour, and it went down easy. Not sure if I'd go grab another one of these right away because it's not off-the-charts, but it's worth trying. Very nice American pale ale. I dig their eco-friendly approach to brewing too.","ElGallo","Sep 03, 2010"

The malt backbone is rather light - I do get a touch of caramel from this. Taste is similar to the aroma though I like the smell a bit better. Very refreshing. The body is Light/medium. The carbonation structure is a bit course and a touch scratchy going down the throat. Not bad but I would prefer a bit more smoothness.

4.43,7.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Picked up a bottle a few weeks back in Portland ME at Downeast Beverage Co. in the Old Port area. Poured tonight into a Deschutes stemmed glass. Pretty and bright golden yellow color, with just a touch of haze to it. Immense pillow-like head forms. Tons of lacing rims down the whole glass. A proper looking beer. Smell was pleasant, with notes of lemon, hay, and pepper noticed. Taste was killer. Nice hop note, but a great counterpunch of malt. An almost perfect balance of the two ingredients. Also, this beer tasted so fresh, almost like it was right out of a growler. Mouthfeel had a subtle hop intensity to it, but it was extremely smooth with a perfect body to it. I seriously wish I had another to drink, and also wish I had a few more in the cellar. One of the best new beers and breweries I have been introduced to lately. Love to see this sometime in MA.","morebeergood","Jun 13, 2010"

But they've got some kinks to work out, as evidenced by the overfoam out of the bottle (not gushing, just a slow foam). I also appreciate the aggressive hopping, as I've had IPA's with much less hop profile. I feel it could use a bolder malt bill, which would help to balance the hops, and decrease the dominating dryness in the flavor and feel. That said, this is plenty easy drinking and tasty. I get a good vibe from the brewery, and I'm confident good things will come from it. I encourage all y'all to give 'em a try.","sprucetip","Jan 08, 2010"

4.55,10.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Picked one of these up while in Portland the other day, after hearing something or other about it. Always like to support new breweries, and scope out the new product. Fortunately for everybody, this is a really good one. Pours a hazy clouded yellow and orange, with a nice white head sticking around for a while. There is a lot of sediment - but I did have it on it's side in the fridge for a while because there is not much room for beer with all the Thanksgiving leftovers! But anyway, the yeast is good for you and doesn't negatively impact the beer, unless you are looking for exceptional clarity of appearance. Ok moving on to more important things... Great nose on this one. It just screams fresh. Grassy and hoppy with plenty of earthy flavors and a touch of citrus. Nearly perfect balance of light bready malt. Both dry and quenching at the same time. Nice and lively on the palate but substantial with a bit of prickle. Uber drinkable. I hope I can find this locally in time for spring/summer weather.

4.77,16.1,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"16oz brown bottle, batch #3, purchased at Whole Foods in Portland, Maine. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a good two inches of off-white rocky head that slowly dissipates. Citrussy American hops (C-hops?) come through strong on the aroma, with notes of orange, lemon, grapefruit, and pine. Tastes very hoppy too, but not in an unbalanced way. There's just enough biscuit and caramel to balance this very hop forward beer. Orange, grapefruit, lemon jump out immediately, with strong pithy, grassy, and piney notes, as well as a touch of cattiness in the finish and aftertaste. Medium bodied with a smooth creamy carbonation. Leaves a fair bit of lacing as the beer is drank. Very well done - definitely one of the finest APAs I have ever had, up there with Dale's and others. Dangerously drinkable, super tasty, but not overwhelming on any count. I am impressed and I can't wait to see what this brewery does next. Thanks guys for having ""decided... to share""!","MrHurmateeowish","Oct 05, 2009"
4.29,4.4,4,5,4,3.5,4.5,"Final thoughts: All in all its a pretty good beer that is very refreshing and tasty. It has an amazing hop nose, that doesn't really follow through on the palate. There is some nice bitterness on the finish but it doesn't make up what I was expecting for the hops in the center of the taste. It does finish pretty well with a good bitterness and clean finish. The hops that do come through taste pretty good with grapefruit, citrus, lemongrass, some interesting tropical fruit and candy tastes, enough to remind me of Gumballhead. The bottle conditioning is a double edged sword, it adds some interesting great flavors and adds the live yeast component, but also makes it inconsistent in carbonation which is very obvious in this one. Overall, Great springtime beer!","jlindros","Sep 29, 2009"

3.77,-8.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured from a chilled bottle into a pair of pint glasses. It's a translucent golden straw color, with a thick white head of bubbles of many sizes. There is some patchy lacing as the head recedes. The aroma is quite strong and enjoyable; lots of floral hops, some earthy yeast a hint of sweetness. There is a light malty sweetness up front in the taste, but nothing too strong or off-putting. This is followed by a pleasant hop flavor--very floral, like the aroma. This lingers after you swallow. The beer has a light body and is quite crisp. My refrigerator may be a bit colder than ideal, but the serving temperature I used works well with this beer. There is a medium amount of carbonation. I could drink a few of these in one night. There are plenty of hops, but it never gets to be too much. If you see a bottle around town, it would be worth picking up and supporting this brand new brewery.","ToasterChef","Jul 30, 2009"
