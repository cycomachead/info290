"More sweet malt as a flavour, with a little spicy and piny hops behind."

"one of the best apa  i have had"

"This is the best part of the Hop Trip...This is the Hop Trip...The best part...I really like...What did he say?  ...  Sorry.  Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear tawny amber topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises grapefruit zest, orange zest, pine resin, light grass, and a healthy amount of caramel.  The taste brings in more of the same, though the resin takes a stronger position here.  Luckily, the caramel balances things out rather well.  The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.  Overall, a very nice, well-balanced, hoppy pale ale.  Not bad at all."

" The taste is great with very juicy hop flavor which has  a slight mango and grapefruit combo with tangerine type taste with mild malt that has a toasted quality and subtle pine in the hop profile as it finishes with mild caramel however the finish is mostly dry. Overall I was pleasantly surprised...even though Deschutes is a favorite brewery of mine since I first tried them decades ago. I expected it to be good and this is great very highly recommend this great pale ale"

"Best by date 12/28/14. Would like to have a fresher bottle to compare with."
"Just not enough intense hop presence for me on this on. Earthy and muddled. Certainly more bready than bitter. Pretty average overall."
""
"Unfortunately, the best before date on my particular bottle was a couple of days before consumption date, and I think this affected the rating."
""
""
""
"Had on tap. Medium carbonation. I love most offering from Deschutes, this one was a miss for me. Came in underpowered on flavor. Perhaps true fans of the APA style will have more appreciation for this than I did. Still an above average beer, just not one I will seek out again."

"Fresh orange/tangerine, slight caramel, lemon, fresh pine. Mild biscuit-y malt and earthiness. Smell is very close to the taste. Just a touch bitter, nice foamy mouthfeel, not a high ABV beer (5.9) but still that being said the ABV is beautifully hidden. Highly drinkable. If you find it in sixers (which I imagine is how its sold) and want a good sessionable IPA or APA pick this one up. I'm having a hard time analyzing it as it is going fast. A worthy beer of being called unique."

"Great brew had it on tap Charlie Hoopers Kansas City mo"

"O-A Good beer, but I'd imagine super fresh it would be even better."

"notes to self mainly… tasty, easy drinking ""session"" type ipa. Lawnmower beer for a guy who likes big beers."
"O - very good fresh hop beer.  The dankness of the hops really sets this apart from other wet hopped IPA's."
""
""
""
"Quite enjoyable."
""
""
"Pours amber with a thick white head. Smells is pretty faint. Some orange and a little earthiness. 12/29/14 best by date which is 120 days out from bottling. Not very fresh so I don't expect much. Taste is very citrusy and orange up front. The low bitterness allows the hop flavor to really shine. A little spice in there too along with some earthiness. Finishes off with a nice malt backbone. Mouthfeel is good, if a little thick. I really prefer my hoppy beers to be lighter, especially when they're "

"The feel is crisp in a medium body with a nice fresh brightness.  It has some smoothness in the middle and finishing well even as it goes semi-dry, not losing the creaminess it obtains after the nibble up front."
""
""
"Looking at some of the positive reviews, it's hard to believe I'm tasting the same beer. This is so focused on the caramel malt aroma and flavor that the hops just don't play much of a role. I know this is billed as a APA instead of a IPA, but with a name like ""Hop Trip", I expected much more complexity from the hops. Instead, the malt dominates and is just too sweet in my opinion to let the rest of the flavors play a role. Mouthfeel is fair, and appearance is quite nice actually, but again, I leave disappointed."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a thin off-white head that still left good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, piney hops, tropical and light citrus fruit. Flavor is rich caramel malt, resiny pine and citrus hops, light orange citrus and mixed fruit. Medium bodied, nice for a pale ale. One of the ales that straddles the border between pale ales and IPAs. Not as intensely hoppy as many current IPAs, but well and freshly hopped with a substantial malt body. Great balance and flavor. I'm not a regular pale ale drinker and so I've missed this in the past. I will definitely pick this up again. A stellar APA."
""
""
"Overall - One of the best APAs I've ever had. It reminds me a lot Fresh Squeezed IPA, but just a little lighter: so balanced and smooth. The big hop punch comes with very restrained bitterness - this one is very easy to knock back. I'll be buying multiple sixers of this for sure."
""
"I really like this well balanced beer.  The color was nice copper with white head that laced all down my glass.  There was enough hops to balance the slightly sweet malt.  This is a great session ale.  Nice job."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Delicious.  Mosaic is fantastic when brewed this way, and this hop would go well in a dark Belgian.  As a pale ale, it doesn't get much better than this."

"Final score: 4.00"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: there is a lot of good taste to this one but I can't quite get over all the sticky and resiny mouthfeel. I think it needs a serious boost in bitterness and crispness to clean up the mouthfeel a bit."
""
""
"Overall, this is a flowing, easy going beverage.  The nose starts you a little strangely, with a curious tartness, but offers up fresh hoppiness alongside a toasty, gentle malt bill to see you through.  This six-pack was purchased as our “sippin beers” for the night, for an easy, hoppy beverage.  Being in St. Louis for the next couple days, we were looking for a local IPA to keep the background noise at bay.  We settled on this, however, with Deschutes having a proven track record, and a shiny façade.  While we’re happy with the decision and are still excited for the remaining four bottles, this, too, did not blow us away.  I suppose expectations got the better of us here, as we were hoping for an even more hoppy showing, but this remained nicely fresh and approachable."

""
""
"An extra hoppy pale ale. Some tropical fruit, bready, more flavor then most pale ales. Most pale ales leave me wanting more.."

"O - Had this side by side with FFF Broo Doo and Founders Harvest.  I would have ranked them FFF, Deschutes, then Founders, but given that FFF was $12 for a 22oz, and Founders was $13 for a 4 pack, I will be skipping them both and just getting Deschutes next year!  $9 for a 6 pack is a bargain and this is absolutely as good as the harder to find big guns."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice brew. They definitely stay true to style. This is a real pale ale. The aromas and flavors aren't flashy, but the craftsmanship is extremely impressive. Extremely sharp, clean, and crisp. It's reminiscent of their Red Chair NWPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  As one would expect from Deschutes, this is solid; I might choose a few others over this one, but I'll definitely have this again and again.   Ideally, I want a little more bite from wet hops.  The juiciness made me want to do a side-by-side with Fresh Squeezed.  Made me miss Red Chair, which I'll drink until the cows come home in the spring, though with that one the malt shines more."
""
""
""
"O: A very balanced pale ale with a unique hop flavor, yet with the classic APA characteristics making it familiar to all. Very sessionable and you can’t beat the price"
""
""
""
"Overall impression:  A bitter, well crafted fresh hop APA."

"2014. CASCADE. PINEY. CITRUSY. DANK. Hop head delight."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is fairly subtle, with hints of tangerine and caramel malt. Toasted bread emerges. Flavor reveals floral hop character throughout, with a base of caramel malt and a fairly bitter, piney finish. Muddled citrus adds complexity. Toasted malt lingers in the aftertaste. Not the hoppiest beer, which I appreciate. Good malt presence for balance. After it warmed, mango and lime came to the forefront."
""
"Grapefruit/citrus flavors with a mild bitter hoppiness. Drinks easy and tastes great. Good IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very tasty and juicy beer.  I really enjoyed this."

"Overall, a very good beer, but one I'll have to make a point to get my hands on a little sooner next season. I've really gotten heavy into wet hop ales and while this is a solid offering, I was left a bit wanting. That being said, the promise is that of a fantastic beer when in its prime."

"Overall: A solid pale ale. I could see myself picking up a sixer for a game or bbq. Would recommend this to those new to the pale ale style."
"O - 4.25 - Outstanding beer for sure. Definitely one to put Dale's Pale to the test. I think a pale ale taste test is in order."

"Overall: Since this was in a 6 pack instead of a bomber I decided to give it a try. Not a tongue bruiser, actually quite balanced. The hops do make their presence felt, just not as much as expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very easy drinking, hoppy beer. Amazing hoppy nose and taste. Very strong citurs and fruit notes from the fresh hops. I made the mistake of only picking up a single. I should have picked up a six pack. Highly recommend. I could easily drink several of these in a night."
"Pours out a hazy orange body with a frothy head. Smells like some funky hops. Oniony, citrusy, piney. I get some caramel and toasted bread from the malts and a touch of fruitiness from the yeast. Taste is way bigger on citrus rind than I would have imagined. I don't get as much funkiness in the flavor as I do in the nose, but those huge orange, tangerine, and grapefruit notes and delicious. Malt is certainly there, providing a sweet background with some caramel and toasted malts. Toast doesn't go overboard. My only complaint in the taste is that the sweetness can get to be a bit too much. Very minimal bitterness. Mouthfeel is about perfect for what the flavors bring. Creamy and a little fluffy, but, when left in the mouth, the carbonation picks up and strips the tongue of the hop resins. This is a great beer. It's hard to put down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well balanced and quite the easy drinker. A nicely put together Fresh Hop Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"This range of flavors does not mesh well: green onion, tea-like, pine, caramel malt. It does not flow. I am sure others may find this beer refreshing, just not for me."

"Another insanely drinkable pale ale from Deschutes. In the perfect world where I drink cases of Mirror Pond this would be a nice break."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome pale ale, the aroma is fantastic, complex and fruity, I wish it were stronger. Flavor is crisp and clean. So glad that this is now available in 12 oz. highly recommended."
"Yeah buddy!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a lightly foamy (1/3) and otherwise smooth (2/3) mouthfeel that's quite good for the style and this beer in particular. Closes dry, with moderate to moderate-high levels of stickiness on the lips and palate."
""
""
""
""
"O- An awesome fresh hop ale. Arguably one of the best of the style. I'm lucky to have been able to land some as Deschutes is yet to arrive in KY. Definetely worthy of getting, especially for the price tag."
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: Fantastic beer, and extremely sessionable. Reminds me quite a bit of fresh squeezed. Really glad I was able to score a sixer of this."
""
"Solid effort from Deschutes, especially if you enjoy a balanced ale that is neither too malty or too hoppy.Worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Best before 12/24 I don't know when it was bottled but this one was a really really, really good beer."
""
""
"O: This is awesome. One of the best APA's Ive ever had."
""
"I was extremely disappointed by this beer from Deschutes. Not sure if I might have gotten an older bottle due to the higher grades it receives, but it did nothing for me and I had to pour it out."
""
""
"O - definitely a fantastically drinkable, superiorly balanced pale!"
""
"B"
"O - This is a very balanced and easy drinking fresh hopped APA."
""
""
""
""
"Light fruits -- ripe peach, banana and pear -- dominate the nose and tongue. Deep honeyed amber color, off-white head with good retention. Creamy mouthfeel. Very mellow pop of bitterness at the front. Orange juice and more peach in the middle. Big sweet finish. Juicy and delicious. Drink soon!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"WOW WOW WOW, that is all I have to say about that. This is by far the best fresh hop beer I have ever had, I will not even need to look for Founders Harvest this year, this is cheaper and better IMO. I may go back for a case! I can not believe how impressive this beer it! BUY IT!"
""
""
"O - excellent fresh hop APA. No complaints here. Glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Too bad this is just a seasonal, I'd drink it all year round. This is the beer that made me grow fresh hops in my garden."
"Um, I mean, don't drink this. It's horrible. More for me, mwah hahaha!!!"
""
"Overall: Very good beer. Give it a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful copper color. Subtle but great hop smell. Very smooth and fresh taste. This is one of those beers that I just wish was year round. I am not very good at accurately using words like juicy and chewy and over-precocious (???), but just try this fucking beer man. Its great."
""
""
""
"yes! love wet hop stuff, and this is only my second of the year, but a real gem, much anticipated and does not disappoint. it has a perfectly clear pour, radiant, glowing red, caramel in color, over an inch of off white head, but it fades rather quickly. the nose is just lovely, really hoppy, clean, and well supported by a slightly richer malt profile than I expected. pine on the hops, toffee sweetness on the grains. the flavor agrees, but I am surprised how well the bitterness of the fresh hops cuts through what would otherwise be a rather sweet grain bill I assume. its great balance, still hop forward, refreshing, and unique. not sure what varietals are used, but I don't remember wet hop beer being quite so bitter an pungent, I always thought more sweet, floral, and understated, but not this one. similar citrus and drinkability to founders all day, and I really would drink this all day everyday if it were available, its that good, so fresh! very drinkable with a light feel despite the color. a little still, it could use just a tad more carbonation, but I like the way it sits in my mouth. its the essence of the fall season for me, and yet another highly refined and expertly done brew from Deschutes."
""
""
"O. This is solid. Good smooth PA with some hop bite and a solid backbone. Refreshing."
"Pours a dark, amberish orange color with a finger of an off white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a thick ring of lacing. Nice carbonation. Smells of resinous, dank, and grassy fresh hops. Get some herbal characteristics, along with pine, sugary grapefruit, tiny bit of tangerine, and plenty of floral. A very nice, clean carmel malt is detected as well. Taste immediately starts with a resinous, grassy hop flavor, but is quickly balanced out by a sugary grapefruit flavor. The middle continues the sweetness, this time bringing a carmel sweetness. This is balanced with more resinous, herbal hop qualities, along with some grapefruit and tangerine. The finish is really good and makes this beer. Get more resinous qualities, but are more of the bitter variety. This bitterness is tame, however, and is accompanied with more intense notes of grapefruit, grass, and tropical fruits. It seems to start off with more fresh hop qualities and finishes with more juicy, fruity hop qualities. All the while balanced with a sweet, clean, and bready malt backbone. Very clean, crisp, and surprisingly full mouthfeel for a pale ale. Although it has a fuller body, it still drinks likes a session ale and leaves you wanting more. A very well-crafted fresh hop pale ale. I wish the hop harvest was year round because this is awesome."
""
""
"Get some soon."
""
""
"YUM; SEEK IT OUT!"
""
""
"- Overall drinkable and pleasant. Full flavored with a clean finish, but not super complex. Another solid offering from deschutes, perfect for the fall."

"Overall: Great American pale ale, or even extra pale ale"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a great American Pale Ale. Another delicious brew from Deschutes."
""
""
""
"O: Maybe it's my preconceived notions, but I was definitely expecting more of a punch with this. I mean, it's got a truck full of hops on the label. Regardless, this is a damn fine APA and a testament that more does not always mean merrier."
"O - A light, sessionable APA with a surprisingly fruity hop profile."
""
""
"Hop forward, but not to hoppy. Clean fresh hops, piney, resin, just a touch of floral. Nice malt structure, sweet bread, caramel. Crisp finish. Body is medium, refreshing, a little tangy and dry, nice carbonation."
"Decent beer. Smell is the definite highlight. Wish the flavor had more to it than the bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Surprise surprise! Another excellent APA by Deschutes. Basically, take Mirror Pond but give it fresh hops. It is smooth, pleasantly bitter and it has a nice citric character. When it's in season it's nice to grab a pint of this to mix it up. Perfectly sessionable, noticeably fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Eh, this brew is slightly above average. Nothing stands out. It would be nice to drink from a can, but not remarkable from a glass. I really wanted more from Deschutes."
"O: Very light and easy drinking. I could drink several in one sitting and not get tired of it."
""
""
""
""
"Great abv and flavor, this has been my go to as long as its on shelves."
""
"O-Great beer, perfectly balanced, tons of fresh hop flavor that stands out from beers like it with the slightly toasted heavy malt bill. At this point I should just keep loading up on every Deschutes brew they make. Extremely well made and they all seem to hit my preferences perfectly."
"This poured an amber gold color with tight foam. It has a light aroma of tangerine & orange marmalade. The flavor has a pleasant bitterness, a subdued but emerging biscuity malt & more citrusy preserves. This brew is enjoyable without being assertive."
""
"A pretty good tasting beer, but with the name Hop Trip I was expecting more hops. Although, I do wish this beer would have had a bigger hops bite I am in no way unsatisfied with it. It has a pretty good feel and taste to it, but seems like it tastes more like a bock or even an Oktoberfest than a beer that has the word HOP in the name of it."
""
"Overall - This is a really good fresh hop Pale Ale. Superb drinkability is only undercut by a flavor that, while excellently balanced, doesn't quite deliver an assertive character, falling off a bit before the finish. Still, this could be a hell of a session beer, and it's one I wouldn't mind drinking again."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass, best before 12/25/12. This pours a clear brownish mahogany color with a mid sized tan head. The smells are of citrus and pine along with caramel malts. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty great, a nice amount of hops up front along with the sweet backbone."
""
"O: One of the best pale ales out there in my opinion. Really fresh hop flavor. The bitterness and the malts do not overpower the hop flavor. A really easy drinker with a lot of hop character similar to an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very flavorful and well-rounder APA. The fresh hops really give it character, almost bordering on an IPA."
""
""
""
"O- Really unique and complex fresh hop ale with big malt and hop profiles."
"O: An absolutely steller Pale Ale. Something to look forward to every year. What Deschutes does with this beer in incredible. The aroma and taste just out of the glass and leave you wanting more."
""
"O: Good fresh hop APA, especially for the price and accessibility this time of year. Smoothness is the main draw and drinkability is high."
""
""
"Pours an amber tinted copper with a nice effervescent head. Wow, what a glorious aroma. Bright, fresh, sharp. Strong sweet grapefruit and tangerine absolutely dominate the olfactory senses, ontop a nice caremel malt base. Taste is sweet and fruity; a supportive caramel malt underbelly letting the hops steal the show -- the tangerine hits first, it transitions gracefully into the grapefruit and a little grass bitterness closes things out. A crisp, active moutfheel. Overall, Deschutes with another great beer. So glad I have 5 more bottles of this in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer, but could use more punch. I guess I've spoiled myself and ruined it for so many other beers at this point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability is fairly low since i'm not a fan. Hate to be the downer here but i really don't get it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep copper with an antique white head. Impressive head retention. Mown grass and citrus nose. Pleasant mouthfeel with an enjoyable, but peculiar mix of caramel malt and tangerine gummy worms. It finishes as smooth as it begins. This beer is an excellent example of a fresh hopped ale while managing to be pleasantly different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a 2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a small cap. Super thing rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruits, citrus zest, and tropical fruits. Taste is of tropical fruit, sweet grapefruit, and citrus zest. There is a very fleeting hint of bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a somewhat flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pale ale with some nice fruity aromas and flavors but the mouthfeel brings this one down a bunch for me."

""
""

""

"D - Very drinkable. Really showcases the fresh hops well. Not a huge beer, but the hops eally shine regardless."
"A very well balanced, resiny IPA."
""
""
""
"Overall it's a real nice beer with high drinkability, yet still able to satisfy the resin-heads. A great sixer-style beer."
"O: I rather enjoyed Deschutes Hop Trip. A quality session brew that's packing a ton of flavor is a rare thing indeed. Easily recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - I like this beer. Its really cool to me that they are focusing on a fresh hop pale ale - seems like that is usually reserved for IPA's. Also, I read somewhere that the hops they use are from a farm about 20 minutes from where I grew up in Oregon, so that has some value to me. This probably isn't a ""must have world class beer"" but I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a nice pale ale with hoppy aromatics. It's good. And it's a good trend to support. Worth trying for sure. Also, on a side note, I was very excited to see this in a six pack in the bay area. A 22 oz bottle of pale ale just doesn't make as much sense to me. 12 oz at a time is the way to go for this beer, in my opinion. Cheers."

"O: A decent APA in an old-school way with hefty raw bitterness in a grassy hoppy way."
"O- I've really enjoyed this seasonal from Deschutes. Really wish it was a year-rounder. One of the better fresh hops this season."
"An easy session ale for me, I could see drinking this all of the time ... why can't hops be a year round crop. Its just not fair. Hop trip is an excellent example of what a fresh hop beer is all about."
"Overall, I've had quite a few of these this fall, and it's a fine, fine brew. This is right up there with the best APAs I've had."
"overall: solid APA - could see purchasing a sixer in the future"
"Deschutes does it again."
"I don't know whether it is just the time and the place in which I am having this beer, but I really, really enjoy it. I think it surpasses Founders Harvest Ale as the best fresh hop ale that I've had, and it's right up there with Alpha King as the best Pale Ale I've had. As the first Deschutes beer that I've tried, it exceeded my expectations and really makes me excited to try more of their craft. Truly a great beer."
"This is a fantastic, smooth, sessionable pale ale that hits a distinct citrus, stone fruit note with a hint of hop sweetness. I can't turn this one down."
"Wow, a really different tasting beer. Starts out with a toffee, brown sugar flavor followed by tons of melon, mellow citrus, and a bit of pine. It somehow pulls of the sweetish malt character and late-hop additions surprisingly well considering their is low bitterness. Really nice flavor profile that i've never experienced before. What an awesome beer to look forward to each fall."
"Enjoyable APA. Sessionable at 5.5%. Recommended."
"O: This is a beer I would keep in the fridge year round if it was available. It really is a shame that hops are only harvested once a year. I highly recommend picking some up if can."
"Overall: I feel so rewarded to be able to buy a sixer of this right after I get my paycheck. It makes all that hard work in long October seem worth it. This is a great American pale ale. All fresh ingredients. Buy this while you can. It’s only available for a couple months each fall."
"O: A damn good pale! Very enjoyable."
"This tasted like a clean hippy's armpit. The fresh hops were way funky, but FRESH! I like fresh hopped beers and this one was resiny fresh! I had to floss after, which is a good thing. I really enjoyed it because that frrrresh funk kept bringing me back for more. I have dreams every night of this beer."
"Really great beer. Nice and light refreshing and full of flavor at the same time. There's something that doesn't hit me just 100% about the carbonation, but aside from that this is a phenomenal beer. This would be without a doubt my go to beer if only it were available year round... damned harvest ales, so good."
"Appearance is amber with a white head. Aroma is that of a grassy hops, almost like a wet field of grass on a sunny day. Taste is exactly that: a grassy hop-bomb. It exploded my face with hops. No... seriously, i have no face. Ten minutes later I still taste hops even as I drink my water. Mouthfeel is that of sticky, resinous hops. Overall this beer is unbalanced, but sometimes that can be a good thing. I can see this beer pairing with certain foods very well as a slow sipper. Hop Trip and a blackened steak would be heaven. I don't think I could drink a lot of this one, but it is unique and tasty."
"A real nice fresh-hop beer. I look forward to comparing to my Sierra Nevada Northern Hemisphere."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle dated best by 12/25/11. Christmas came early with this one. More of a darker amber hue than some pale ales. A finger and a half of fluffy white head. Good retention. Better than good lacing. The smell. Well, maybe the best nose on a hop bomb I've had. Tropical out the yin-yang. Pineapple, lemon, orange, some grapefruit. A little pine. Sculpin, you have met your master. On the tongue, very bright. Citrus. Spice. A little bit of that pilsnerish spice going on. Nice sticky bitterness. Dry. Little creamy bubbles. Probably the best Pale ale I've had. WOW!"
"I really didn’t like this beer. Just way too buttery and creamy for me. Looking at the other reviews, maybe I got a wrong beer? Either way, this one was not good."
"O: Well executed. Good floral and fruit notes that make this stand out among other pine-forward pale ales and IPAs. A nice change, with a very complimentary malt bill."
"Overall: A very good brew. One of the better American Pale Ales I've had."
"O: Overall an amazing pale ale. The fresh hops make this beer! Gets some great hop aromas from them. I would definitely buy this one again for the price."
"O/D - Wish I would have had this one fresh. Even now 8 months too late it has a nice flavor. I don't think I can attribute too much of its mellow notes to age however since i don't think I get much hop oxidation."
"O: yummy! Good beer. The heirloom hops are different and delicious."
"O: Amazing beer from Deschutes. Then again when isn't their beers amazing?"
"O: Very good, smooth, fresh and easy to drink"
"O - Love this one, better on tap than from the bottle, but they are close when fresh."
"Taste is bitter hops layered on top of biscuity pale malt. Really nice, clean flavor. This would be a regular go-to pale ale if it were available year-round. Great beer."
"Overall: What a nice beer, nothing is over the top here, which is quite unique for an American (hop) brew. I can drink this on every warm summer day"
"Deschutes at their finest."
"It tastes a bit off, I'm assuming, it does have that old hoppiness to it, oh well. The beer is medium in body and still pretty bitter. Nice finish in general, quite malty throughout though. Sweetness up front, malty body in the middle. Not my favorite. I'd love to try this again but really fresh."
"Narrative: Clint knew that quad-majoring was a stupid idea from its inception. Sure, San Diego State didn't offer a BioPoliticalHerbalosophy Major, so he tailored his own. But the strains of keeping his phylum straight with his Kantian dialectic, just seemed to earn him solid C's. It didn't help with the ladies either that he mixed up the Concordat of Worms with grassroots activism and his peet moss lectures. It was a jumbled mess without direction, his life seemed to be. He would be entertaining for a few moments, that old Clint, tell ya about Keynsian economics and make it relative to paleoethnobotany to boot, but, who really wants to talk to Clint? He is tiresome and wears forgettable solid shirts. Even his presence feels like a Spin Doctors song that you entirely forget the moment the tune starts to fade. Wait, who were we talking about again?"
"O-very nice beer. Very relaxing and not overpowering"
"D - flavourful with a decent balance, but I was expecting more hop dominance based on the name, still enjoyable though"
"the CPJ"
"M/D: On the lighter side of medium with nice carbonation. Overall extremely enjoyable, could drink this one all day. The fresh flavor really made it nice."
"D: Super enjoyable beer, with very round and dynamic character. worth a try."
"D - A tasty offering from Deschutes, and a unique concept ale. Could have had a bit more hops, but I noticed that it had passed its 'Best Consumed By' date by a couple weeks, contributing to this weaker presence. Strikes a nice balance nonetheless, with a tasty sweetness and easily drinkable. Definitely worthy of a try."
"I expected a lot more out of this beer. Perhaps it is beyond the best by date but the one I had earlier this year wasn't exactly as much of a wet hop craft as I thought it was going to be. I will try it again next year fresh and most likely will amend."
"Very easy to down this bomber."
"D: I can only imagine when this is fresh how great this is! A very sold, easy drinker."
"I am blessed to live in the pacific northwest with access to so much great beer! According to deschutes the hops for this beer go from vine to the brewery in 6 hours. That is fresh! This pours a transparent amber color with a light, but tall head that leaves a little lacing on the way down. Smells divine, fresh citrus and pine hops. The first taste to register is that wonderful citrus hop, followed by a little of the pine hop. Some of the malt cones through toward the end, but it still finishes with a hop bitterness. Mourlthfeel is medium, with average carbonation. Drinkability is high! What a great beer! Not something to start your friends out on, but a great seasonal fresh hop beer."
"D - So incredibly quaffable. Very tasty and enjoyable. Mine was gone in minutes. Must be exceptional when fresh."
"As an additional note, the best by date is 1/19/11, so yesterday..."
"Thin beer, very easy to drink, and very light on the palate. Very good beer, even if I don't know which style it should fall into."
"D- This is a fantastic APA overall-I'd argue that it has a lot mroe components of an IPA than APA- but its still awesome and very good overal. I lke a good fresh hop harvest ale."
"Enjoyed this as a light and refined fresh hop ale. Not quite as good as Surly or Great Divide in my opinion, but one of the best."
"Big, bold malt presence. Has some honey sweetness and an orange marmalade tinge, but it's mostly that malt tasting malt. I love that stuff. Way exceeds my perception of a 5.5% beer. Some marijuana hop stank with a snappy, spicy bitter. Vibrant carbonation plays up hop spice."
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hops. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. Definitely a well balanced easy drinker. Also had a good aroma to keep you coming back for more with an excellent flavor. This one is a definite must try without doubt."
"An approachable APA, but the weakest of the otherwise stellar Bond Street Series..."
"First of all i love the front label and it pours a light copper hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head that quickly forms to more of a bubbly film across the top and a rim of lacing,the smell is quite subdued and has feint aromas of caramel,orange zest and pine,the mouthfeel is very smooth and light-medium bodied and has tastes of caramel,toffee,orange rind,grapefruit and finishes with a hoppy pine bitterness and to be honest i could drink it all day its one of those drops that even though it really doesnt have too many distinguishing factors about it,it is very easy to knock back while still being rather enjoyable."
"D: This is a well presented pale ale of which I will have no problem finishing a bomber of."
"Drinkability- I thought this was very good. Definitely a very drinkable beer"
"Pours a translucent copper/orange with a thin head. Nose is pretty light, not exactly a hop bomb, some floral and citrus, light fresh hop aroma. Sweet tart candied citrus hits the palate and powers through with some nice rounded sweet malty flavors. There's an austere/hard water/mineral quality to this in the Deschutes style. A fine pint but not really blowing me away."
"D: Great citrus and hops in this pale ale. Very drinkable."
"Overall, an easy drinker. Had this during the winter, and it says it is good to about mid January. Curious how it would be fresh on a hot summer day though."
"Got this from the Deschutes brewpub in Portland. Actually got it for free. I wanted to buy a bottle after having many pints (and dinner), the bartender just handed me the bomber and told me to enjoy. Split this bottle back in Toronto with Sammy. Pours a pale orange colour with big white head. Citrus hops really shine through with an understated caramel malt backbone. Nice carbonation level. One of my favourite APA's I've had, close to level of Daisy Cutter and Alpha King."
"Reviewed on 1/18/2010. Bottle thanks to Sparky27. Pours a slightly cloudy orange with a small white head. Aroma of toasted malt, fruity hops, caramel malt. Flavor of similar floral hops, toasted/biscuity malt, with a caramel malt finish. Very drinkable and pleasant. Good pale ale!"
"Overall, another nice beer from Deschutes and I continue to wish that I could get these beers out in New York. It was a nice APA, true to the style, and an enjoyable beer to drink. I would recommend picking one up. Cheers!"
"D - Fantastic pale, could have a few before and/or after a sitting."
"D-Yes please, may I have another? Great APA, if only I lived on the West coast, this brew would be a standard for me. At 5.5% the ABV isn't terribly high and would allow me to indulge."
"D - very easy to drink."
"Loving the fresh hopped beers. Can't wait until next harvest to get a few more examples."
"Drinkability is fantastic. The flavor meld so well, and dose not become a chore to put this beer away. Suffice to say, I will definitely be buying this beer again and again."
"Pours a golden/red with a frothy head with some nice residual lacing. Smells like fresh hops with a hint of carmel toast. The flavor is really surprising. Grassy, citrusy, minty hops balance sublimely with the malt character here. It just keeps calling you back for another sip. The mouthfeel really adds to this. Thick and foamy, almost chewy. Needless to say I could drink many of these. This beer is in perfect balance with all of its' parts. An exceptional take on a fresh hop brew."
"Mouthfeel: Fairly light bodied with fine carbonation make for a smooth mouthfeel, overall. This is a very tasty fresh hop pale ale. Wouldn't hurt to see a bit more flavor and a little heavier feel, but still very solid."
"All of the good raters from BA have had this, now me from a fresh bottle from the brewery, thanks Ken. Big bubbly head on an orangey body. Fragance of orange hips. Chewy orange mouthfeel, its a plus. There is a little musty funk at the end. Hits the mark as an APA. Carbonation is right there. Extraordinary drinkable."
"Drinkability: a highly quaffable and refreshing pale ale. This makes a decent session beer."
"A little to smooth, and undercarbonated. Feels a bit thick. Otherwise, not bad."
"The body is actually quite heavy for a pale ale. The carbonation is sharp at first, but seems fitting, lightening up the beefier thickness. The finish is very clean, a little more dryness may have made it even more drinkable. But it certainly excelled in that category."
"Pours a clear, dark copper color with an average sized head. Head is off white and leaves some nice lacing in its wake. Looks great but unfortunately things kinda go downhill from there. Scent is a little on the faint side but has that distinct fresh hop smell. Taste was also a bit underwhelming. As expected hops are front and center. Minty, citrusy hops up front with a nice malt background. I don't know if my new found passion for fresh hops and high expectations for Deschutes swayed my opinion here but I just wasn't all that impressed with this one. It wasn't bad, in fact I'd drink it again, I just felt a bit let down."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability is very good, it's an extremely easy drinking beer. It has a nice bright fresh hop flavor to it without much bitterness at all. Very good beer overall and one of the best fresh hop beers I've had."
"D - Smooth and very fresh tasting, an easy one to drink and enjoy!"
"One of the best APAs I have ever tried."
"Surprised by this one, not a wild, bitter bomb, but a fresh, delicious, easy to drink IPA. Nice one, Deschutes."
"D: Very enjoyable in 22 oz format. Would happily have again if I saw it on tap."
"Overall it's Hops up front, malts, citrus, sweet fruit esters are mildly present. If you like hops buy this it's quite hoppy for an APA."
"D: very drinkable based on strong malt backbone"
"Overall, a really good APA but was hoping for more of a hop bite in it. Still highly recommend. Got another one in the fridge to try soon myself. Avail here in TX. Rotation - worth a couple per season at least [O;Y]"
"Verdict: Hop Trip is a fantastic little Pale Ale. Tasty, well balanced, and easily drinkable, this is one of the best fresh hop beers I've come across. It just goes to show you, it doesn't take a big IPA or a DIPA to properly showcase hops."
"Juicy and resinous hops blur the line from flavoring to bittering, more like one long, continual spectrum. I get bubblegum, pineapple, guava and grapefruit flavors. Malts are mild, at least compared to the hops, but shows a fairly sweet, toasty side. Goes down really easy, medium bodied and carbonation is low. Very good, but I think I'll take a fresh Mirror Pond by a slight margin."
"An excellent pale ale. I love it, and highly recommended. Well done Deschutes."
"Only 5.5% abv and 38 ibus are proof that a great hoppy beer doesn't have to be a big beer. Deschutes does more with Hop Trip than most brewers accomplish with a double ipa. Terrific stuff."
"Sidenote - I went into this one on a recommendation from another fellow perusing the beer aisle. I only heard from the guy that it was a fresh hopped ale and very reasonably priced. He did not mention nor did I catch that is was a pale ale. I assumed it was an IPA style as most fresh/wet hopped ales tend to lean. It most definately leans the other way. Closer to a lager or pils than an IPA."
"D: its quite easy to drink just wish the flavor was more appealing."
"D: such a refreshing beer, I usually don't like a super fruity beers, but this one has made me a believer. Near perfect balance between the sweet aroma hops and malt and the bittering hops. I could drink 100 of these."
"Clear amber color with two fingers of head that had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Smells of grapefruit, pine, hay, and some slight sweetness from the malt. This is a really nice tasting green hop beer. Not overly bitter but with plenty of hop flavor and balance from the malt. Hints of citrus and a raw, green tea from the hops. Some biscuit and musty notes from the malt. Just slightly dry overall. For a lower ABV beer, it has a medium body and very good carbonation. Great texture. A great drinking beer with plenty of hop goodness without the bitter blitz to the palate. I also like the relatively low ABV."
"drinkability - flavorful and sweet, easy to drink"
"D: Very easy drinking. Good balance, fresh hops."
"Overall: The best fresh hop ale I have tried this year. Very enjoyable beer."
"2010--5.50% ABV. 38 IBU's. (4.75 / 5.0) Harvest Ale--Fresh Hop. Dense lacy head. Clear rich deep amber red bright color. Delicate sweet hop fresh floral front. Mellow sweet doughy creamy subtle fresh hop resin lightly toasted caramel fruit malty Pale Ale body. Smooth balanced hop spice smooth creamy end. Nice! Sampled 10/22/2010 from 22 oz. Bottle purchased for $5.59 @ Seattle Fred Meyer--Ballard on 10/22/2010."
"Notes: Hop Trip is medium bodied, yet oily hop resins seem to coat the palate, making for a long, complex finish. Tasty indeed, and very drinkable."
"Will be coming back for more of this stuff."
"D: Delicious, in a somewhat uninteresting way when served on draft. The sensory qualities, particularly those delivered by the hops, were sadly under-represented at the tap (but appearance did count for something extra in that case). The bottled beer added much of what seemed to be missing from the draft experience, with a mostly floral hop presence. This beer changes every year, which is fine in an ephemeral and artisanal product such as a wet hop ale, but here the variance encountered in the different forms of packaging seemed noteworthy for their distinctness. I likely would have scored the bottled Hop Trip higher, but I feel that in this case the style should be at its best when served fresh, on draft."
"Ultra smooth, easy-drinking, and very flavorful!"
"Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability: This is a very fresh beer that I really could continuously drink all day - too bad I only have the single bomber. Other Wet Hop Ales I have had have been more IPA-like, but since this is more akin to an APA, this is probably the best APA I have ever had. Just fantastic."
"from a bomber it poured a clear red chestnut color..with a nice 1 finger beige head that stayed awhile lots of lacing on this one..smell is pine ,grapefruit.abundant hops,malt and some toffee..taste is nice citrus hops very abundant with pine and caramel malts..this is very tasty and well balanced,,mouth feel is smooth and creamy with pine/citrus hops balanced with just the right amount of malts and biscuit tastes..medium carbonation makes for a well made FRESH APA..highly drinkable very enjoyable"
"Smooth, nicely carbonated, light to medium bodied, and finishes dry. A very nice beer which I would buy again."
"This is an extremely drinkable and well done fresh hop beer. I definitely recommend drinking fresh, as I remember having this a few months after the release last year and it doesn't compare to the fresh version this year."
"D= A great brew to sure. Happy this is finally in MN. I been looking forward to this and I love it. Awesome beer worth seeking out though it's less ""green"" in flavor than most wet hop beers."
"Looks cloudier than I described before. Bigger head. This would be a great session beer for me. It's very relaxing."
"Overall this is an easy to drink and very enjoyable wet hop beer. I did have one of these from last years batch in July and it was a shell of this beer before me now. Drink while they're fresh!"
"Edit: Just saw the reviewer below me gave nearly the same review, except he got lacing. Coinkidink."
"D - Wow, when its nice a fresh this beer is awesome; 5.5% a 22 oz goes down easy, i need more"
"D: it drank good but the hop profile and overall flavor of the beer was quite dissapointing. Id rather do hop henge or red chair as far as the bond series beers go."
"I could easily drink 2 or 3 of these bombers- not bad at all, but I like my Pale ales a little lighter in color and malt presence. As an IPA, this would have scored a little worse- 3.5/4.0/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"Easy to drink. Doesn't taste horrible, but there is enough flavor to make it palatable. I think I just got this beer past its prime. I'd love to try it fresh, maybe this year..."
"F: Some bitterness, a little spicy hop flavor, more juicy flavors lingering. Mostly dry but a touch of sweet malt lingering. SOme lingering bitterness too. A little tangerine and touch of pine coming through on the finish. I would love to try this again fresh."
"D: Very enjoyable. Sessionable beer that I'd buy again and order another of."
"D: Having not had the fresh version, I can't really say how I might appreciate the hop addition in this beer. However, the faded, maltier version is very very good and highly drinkable. Super smooth for its style with great flavor and extremely refreshing, a bomber is finished waaaay to quickly in this case."
"D: This one doesn't work for me. I'm thinking I got a bad bottle, but as this beer isn't sold in IL, I'm lucky to have procured this one and I have nothing to compare it to. Unfortunately, this beer was flawed in more ways than one."
"This has a high drinkability and is a great example of a sessionable pale ale."
"Pours slightly hazed amber with light tan head, although it is a very thick head - dense and laces well as the pint goes down. Nose is very fresh fruit-like with some less common fruits like tangerine, peach, and the usual grapefruit. On the palate this is a tropical fruit ale all the way. Modest hop bitterness, modest malt, but very tropical overall."
"M/D: Smooth and slick. No etoh presence. Almost mouth coating like a good amber ale. Very drinkable."
"NOTE: The bottle I found had ""best by 1/09/10"" printed so it was a little past its prime. I think that had something to do with the smell just not really being there for me. The taste of this beer was still quite enjoyable."
"Orangish amber clear body, one finger white head, quick dissipation with above average lacing. The nose is sweet malts, subtle floral hops. The taste is too sweet for me, the hops maintain their floral quality, not much bitterness on the backend. I wonder whether this was a bad keg, the taste is off a bit, wet cardboard. Mouthfeel is pretty good, not too heavy, though a bit sticky, and it's probably drinkable, but in retrospect I'd rather go either way, up with Red Chair or down with Mirror Pond than have this APA again."
"D- A great beer to sample around hop harvest. A well executed unique beer."
"Served out of a 22oz bottle, poured very smooth with very little head which dissipated quickly. the coloring is solid orange, looks unfiltered so it's pretty cloudy and it honestly has a darker coloring than some lower quality amber's I've had. The smell is some serious freshness, reminds me of springtime with the floral hop aroma. No trees here, all flowers! The taste is smooth as hell, it has little carbonation so it goes down easily. I get some fruity flavors in there but not the bitter ones it's all sweet like super ripe oranges and spring flowers. A bit of spice comes in there too which I appreciate. This beer is about as drinkable as they come I pretty much equate it to the sierra nevada pale but a tad bit better!"
"very drinkable as a result"
"Very quaffable."
"2010 edit: Tried this again while it was super fresh this time, bumped the score a little. Overall it is a well balanced beer, I think it would be nice if it came in six packs, but I understand why it doesn't."
"Color is a deep orange, carbonation is good, smell and taste unremarkable."
"Drinkability - Very quaffable. I am sitting here snacking on some chips with this beer and have to watch myself from drinking it all within a few minutes. A very good session beer - lower ABV but great and robust flavors burst through."
"Very drinkable and damn tasty. The only problem is that the name of the beer is Hop Trip and it's supposed to be a fresh hop APA and there is only a small amount of hops present. Good beer, deceiving name."
"Overall a good ale. Not deserving of the hop name though."
"D- This is a good drinking beer. I was expecting a little more with a name like that but still good never the less. Would enjoy to try it on tap."
"T: Despite the the fact that this beer is, overall, somewhat disappointing, it's still a decent ""session"" beer. It's not really a session beer though, due to its cost."
"Very drinkable, with its emphasis towards balance, light body, and reasonable ABV. Sessionable in the American sense of the term. I would gladly drink this on a very regular basis. Recommended."
"a solid pale ale with a fantastic nose. very refreshing apple, lemon zest that come across as a nice english esb but much brighter. the fruit qualities work well as a nice blend inbetween a nice fresh hop and good malt quality. citrus, apple juice, and pear. some mild herbal. the finish is mediocre at first but once it breathes the protein hair finish fades and goes out mild and clean."
"D- goes down easily, and made Thanksgiving dinner kick that much more ass."
"D - Drinkability is above average. The relatively low alcohol level and mild aroma and flavor make this beer quite easy to put away. I could see drinking this for an entire session with no problem. The only real issue here is the mouthfeel. It's really just too thin. Other than that, it's a pretty decent brew. Glad I got to try it out."
"Conclusion: Not quite the hop explosion I was expecting, but a well-crafted, tasty APA (which is a style I'm usually not too fond of). If this was available in my area, I could definitely see picking this up when it's released every year. I bet this would go great with a good old American Cheese grilled cheese or a cheeseburger and fries."
"Taste begins with the perfumey, floral notes from the nose and carries on to a very feint bitterness and finishes with caramel. I am kind of surprised by the taste. It's billed as ""Hop Trip"" and a Fresh Hop Ale, however it seems the malt plays just as much of a role as the hops. It's a terrific, clean, very balanced taste, but being a Fresh Hop Ale, the hops just don't shine. This is one of the smoothest APA's I've had, a very, probably dangerously sessionable beer. In fact, I'd love to see this beer as a replacemet to Mirror Pond, or see it as it's own, sadly, I don't believe dry hops could produce the awesome, albeit small, hop flavors it does have."
"From vine to kettle in less than four hours. I am blessed to live in the Willamette Valley. I frequently ride my bicycle past acres and acres of hops around Salem, eagerly awaiting the aromas surrounding the fields during harvest. Great stuff all."
"I actually think this is one of the most sessionable brews I've had in a while... Superbly balanced and tasty without being over the top.."
"D=great taste not overly sweet or bitter, great drinkability."
"The rumors of early hop harvest may be true, as this beer did not live up to its reputation. Hoping it's just an off year. May revisit next year after confirmation this year was a fluke."
"D: I was a little disappointed with this brew, perusing other reviews it looks like this years' version is not up to the par of previous vintages. Don't think I'll be seeking this years' version again but will be trying again in future years."
"This is the standard by which I judge the local Oregon fresh hop brews. Apparently we have a major surplus of Willamette hops and so many of the local breweries are making good quantities of this style (Rogue, Bridgeport, etc...) I really enjoy these beers and I hope they will continue to produce this style. =)"
"D: Ok- nothing special which is disappointing since the last year's version was very enjoyable. I'd drink it, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"D = A sessionable beer but lacking a hop wallop. ""What in the world does that mean, sessionable?"""
"If I wanted to brew a beer to showcase the freshness of hops, I would have tilted the balance to the hop. Hop Trip's malt character, although nicely clean, dominates the palate."
"Pours a golden honey color in the glass with a creamy, white froth. The nose of this particular beer is subtle with light citrus, pine, spices, and wet leaf with a caramel, honey, grainy malt. The mouthfeel of this beer is fantastic & the 5.5%abv allows for this to be a very drinkable beer. Overall, this beer is the definition of balance, but I was really looking for something more....just didn't happen."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated astringent, and crisp. The body of the beer is thick and the finish is medium. The head left some lacing on the mug. This is a really good APA from Deschutes. I am glad that I got to try it."
"Poured into a pint glass amber with a thin white head. Minimal lacing. Smell isn't very strong but the green hops are evident. The taste isn't a very strong hop presence, and it really has sometihng missing on the back end of the palette. This fresh hop has something missing, definatly not something I expected from a great brewery."
"Pours a nice golden orange with a big bubbly head. The head lingers and lingers leaving behind sheets of thick foamy lace. Nice oily hops, tons of pine with a hint of citric acid. Nice smelling APA. The pine blasts you from go and only dies down to make may for some citrus which bites right at the tip of your tounge. There is enough malt in the background to support this one. Medium bodied and oh so smooth. Nice drinkable, sessionable APA. A nice drinking beer, where the freshness of the hops can really be noticed. There is a nice fresh quality to the beer that can be noted in the nose and the taste."
"Top notch, unique pale ale well worth trying..probably would rate as one of the better APA's I've had...only mild complaint is the body is a little thin...thinner than I'd expect for a 5.6%...not horrible but not elite in that regard...the rest is close to elite..."
"A subtle beer with multiple layers of fresh flavors. Soft, decently complex, and easy drinking. Still, it lacks real depth and could use a little horsepower in the hops department."
"Pours a copper color with a small, white head. Smell is a mix of caramel malt and piney hops. Taste is much more malty than I would have imagined from a beer named Hop Trip. There are definitely hops in the taste, but they are nicely balanced with the strong malt backbone. This is one of the most drinkable beers I have had in a long time and I would recommend it to anyone."
"D: Maybe some off flavors in there. Tasty but I don't know."
"A good beer, but nothing great. Certainly worth picking up, but not pining for the rest of the year."
"D- If only Deschutes distributed this far east... I would work this into my regular line-up."
"D: A fairly balanced brew that doesn't scream pacific northwest... I expected more of a ""hop trip""."
"A nice, hoppy pale ale. Hop Trip pours a bright red-gold with a nice off-white head. There's some lacing. The aroma is bright and floral with the smell of fresh hops. The malt sweetness has a pleasant caramel aroma. The flavor is similar, fresh, floral hops blended with pleasant caramel malt. It's a very pleasant pale ale. However, I've felt somehow disappointed in both this year's and last year's version. I like my fresh hop ales big and bright and Hop Trip is just a bit restrained and balanced for my tastes."
"Drinkability follows suit with the balance of hop and malt flavors not overly aggressive just plain good drinking pale ale. The fresh hops makes this beer something special and I'm glad I had the opportunity to catch 22 ounces, thanks Geof my package should be shipping within the next week or two. This beer is the least of my favorite and of the three Bond Street Series, but it's still damn good if that says anything about the quality of Deschutes beers."
"edit: I've been getting beermails... I would love to bump up my taste rating if I am able to get anymore of this."
"D - Overall, a very well done and drinkable brew. I'm glad I got to try a really fresh bottle, because the hops in this one are quite tasty. Hoppier than the average APA, but I like it."
"Definitely worth trying but nothing that I have seen/smelled/tasted that made me love this beer. I would go get a bottle or two to try it."
"Poured out of a 22oz bomber and compared with 5 others blind. This scored almost top marks albeit compared against different styles (hops). Nice body and head, with a fresh clean flavor profile that many enjoyed. This is good and will seek out more. Hop Henge got slightly higher marks as did Avery Maharaja."
"whoops, looks like this one is way past its peak, assuming that the date code means ""266th day of 2008"". still nice and drinkable, but i've apparently missed out on that wet hop goodness. drink fresh, folks..."
"Pours slightly hazed amber with light tan head, although it is a very thick head - dense and laces well as the pint goes down. Nose is very fresh fruit-like with some less common fruits like tangerine, peach, and the usual grapefruit. On the palate this is a tropical fruit ale all the way. Modest hop bitterness, modest malt, but very tropical overall."
"Spicy to close, the beer's growing bitterness edges out those nearly cakey malt sweetnesses but only marginally. Somewhat ginger and pine-like the beer strives for an even-keel taste from front to back while celebrating what's best about fresh-picked hops."
"Beer poured a tootsie roll orange with an OK off white head. Unfortunately i missed the boat on the fresh hop aroma but nonetheless it is still quite pungent, northwest floral hops abound with a pleasant malt background. Taste is very good, a nice light toffee malt backbone is pleasantly balanced by a orange apricot hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slow carbonation that results in a pleasant roll across the palate. Drinkability is near perfect. The 5.5% abv makes this brew quite sessionable. I would love to truly try this fresh!"
"An extremely easy drinking enjoyable beer. When I had this for the first time I thought it was the BEST pale ale I have ever had. I bought a case and finally got around to ""officially"" reviewing this beer. Unfortunately, I don't think this beer stores well at all. Every time I have one, it tastes a little worse than the last one."
"Overall this is a solid APA - I'm especially impressed how much I enjoyed it even while it didn't taste terribly fresh. Certainly worth a shot."
"D - Good drinkability, this could be a good summer evening session beer for the front porch."
"Pours a fairly clear gold color with a frothy slowly receding mostly white head. Smells of sticky citrus hops with a twinge of juicy fruit gum. First sip is surprisingly balanced with tons of malts to support the massive grapefruit hops. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth."
"D: Such an easy brew to drink. So well-balanced! I look forward to having an even fresher batch this upcoming Fall."
"Drinkability is high. Great warm weather brew. Although the name is a bit deceiving(not real hoppy), I did enjoy it."
"Overall, a very easy to drink pale ale. Nice and mellow, while still providing great flavor, but light enough to drink quite a few of these."
"Because of the heavier carbonation it is not the easiest beer to drink. But it certainly has a nice enough flavor that one would want to drink plenty of it. I would also say that because of the low alcohol content one would expect this to be easier to drink than it is but I attribute that to its complex flavor."
"Pours a dark amber in color with a nice quarter inch head. Smell is mostly malts with some piney hops to go with it. Taste is much the same with a nice hop kick in finish. This strikes me more as a subtly hopped red than anything else. Different, but I like it. Decent mouthfeel. I still think there are not enough hops to balance all the malt that was used. Good beer overall."
"Very drinkable ale the great part of this is smelling the hop esters while drinking."
"Taste is quite nice on the palate. The earthy, fresh-hop flavors come through nice, but are well balanced with the caramel and malt flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium to light and with a fair carbonation. I like this brew and will be going back for seconds."
"Not sure if this was a stale or bad bottle, code is 266 08 0815 M, presumably bottled on 23 Sep 2008?"
"Very delightful smooth and creamyness at first sip nice balance with strong carmell malt and pine flavors upfront a citrusy grapefuit flavor comes through nicely at mid taste with a touch of pine finishes with a nice grapefruity full mouthwatering feel. Very enjoyable beer goes down very easy. Just a very nice beer all around.Was just a bit past its prime might get all 5's totally fresh.I'll be getting more of this beer when it comes out again."
"Drinkability: Wow. This is probably the best fresh hop ale out there. It the hops carried from the aroma to the taste, equivocally, this could be a perfect beer. Very fresh and extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability is very good. A tremendous amount of flavor in a 5.5% abv beer. Very good !!!"
"Get this while you can! MMMmmm, yummy."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very crisp. Excellent carbonation. Very easy drinking pale ale with an almost IPA hoppiness to it."
"This is a great hoppy, but balanced, brew! This is a winner, for sure!"
"A nice beer, didn't really have that ""fresh hop"" pow i was looking for. could be i had an older bottle, not sure. Regardless, a great session beer that i could drink many of."
"D: my only quaff is that the hops seem just a bit timid, timid on a high level of timidity (make sense). Otherwise this boy is spot on and aims to please with much confidence. This thing should be made year round or at least a longer availability. But then again if you had it all the time you might drink it out of style...but that would be hard to do with this thunderous effort from Deschutes"
"Good stuff here from Deschutes. This isn't overly bitter for a Fresh Hop Ale but instead puts the more floral and herbal aspects of the hops on display, that when mixed with some great balance and a smooth drinkibility, makes for a most pleasant drinking experience."
"Poured a nice copper color with about and inch or head that slowly faded and left some nice lacing on the glass. Smell of the hops, a bit of a grassy smell along with a hint of citrus. Fresh hop and citrus taste up front i then get some of the grassy flavor and a hint of caramel malts to balance it out. It's a nice medium bodied beer with the right amount of carbonation. I could sit and drink a few of these it goes down so easy."
"Pours a solid copper color with a huge stiff off white collar that resists fading...decomposing like an ice cream float and leaving a good amount of Belgian lacing behind. Smells true to style, which IMO doesn't have all that much going for it...roasted malts with a nicely balanced hoppy character. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied and creamy...a really good combination. Full malt flavor with an excellent hop sidekick. At 5.5% ABV this one is a real nice drinker. Probably a good thing that i can't get these locally."
"Really tasty beer, to bad I can't get it around here. Just about a perfect pale ale for a hophead."
"I recommend you take this trip."
"It's fine, and easy to drink, but it didn't bowl me over with waves of complex hop flavors. In a blind taste test I don't think I'd be particularly excited to keep drinking it... that said, it's a fine beer, and certainly worth the shot if you like fresh/wet hop beers. I guess I just didn't get to this one in time?"
"D - Easy to drink and very enjoyable. This is a very well balanced beer."
"Drinkability?.. yes. Let's give up water and drink hop trip!"
"Drinkability: This is a very fine pale ale, that I would not mind having a few of. Taste is pretty complex, especially for an APA, and it only gets better as the beer warms. If the flavor were a bit milder, this would be a 5, but really no complaints here. Will buy again."
"J"
"Really nice to sip with some sharp cheddar cheese and dates."
"I wish I stuck a 2nd bottle in my suit case!! I will have to have this again next year when released. Excellent!"
"Compared to many other beers this beer seems to go further on delivering fresh hops that are not bitter. I look forward to having another soon."
"Pours a clear dark amber orange color with 2 fingers of foamy slightly off-white head. Nice retention and good lacing stick. Smells of citrus fruits, primarily oranges along with some caramel malts and pine. Tastes of caramel and biscuit up front followed by oranges and rind, light pine, floral hops and fruits, and a touch of earth and spice in the finish. Medium in body with OK carbonation. Smooth and very well balanced, not overly bitter but has a plethora of hop flavors making for an excellent medley that is very enjoyable and quite sessionable."
"D - Real good, very smooth. Definitely a sessionable beer in my mind."
"The bomber poured nice amber with abundant fluffy off white head, settling gradually into a crema-like sheet of lacing. The is aroma is citrusy, oranges, with prevalent anesthetic, piney high notes; a bit earthy as it warms. Sweetness carries the bitter dry finish nicely, flavors of caramel with aspirin bitterness. It may be a bit thin but the flavor is right on."
"D: Very quaffable, reminds me of blind pig in some ways, but they really need to work on the mouthfeel."
"Nicely done."
"Another great addition to the Bond St Series from Deschutes!!"
"Heavenly aroma of fresh cut pine, squeezed grapefruit, and biscuits. Expected auburn pour with a short white head that quickly turns to an oily surface. Clean taste, as if there were a mountain stream that poured APA. Pine, oranges, grapefruit fill the mouth, but are subdued by the malty, bready back. A light, refreshing beer that should be released in the summer, but has to wait until the autumn harvest."
"A good pale ale, although it seemed rushed to brew. I'm still looking more forward to Bridgeports Hop Harvest Ale which I think I will like better. A good pale should sit around 7% Alc.. this one is a bit mild for my taste."
"Drinkability: I could drink this fresh hop ale all day!"
"Very fresh hoppy citrus greets the nose with a nice malt backing. Tangelo, mandarin, tea, light tobacco and a touch of pine to floral sweetness. The taste mimics the nose with a perfect sweetness and balance that finishes crisp and clean. Doughy malt carries through some black tea and fresh hop floral notes. Decent bit of body, nice carbonation, alcohol well hidden and super flavor. I could drink gallons of this stuff and will certainly be buying more. Really nicely done wet-hopper."
"Pours a slightly cloudy terracotta brown with a really nice looking short creamy head. Laces uniformly. Aroma is hoppy, a bit catty and grassy, sweet and reasonably fresh-smelling. Flavor is nicely subdued, which surprised me considering how people go wild for the massive bitter beers these days. Creamy caramelized malt with a soft tasty apple and orange hop flavor. Bitterness is present but non-agsressive. Smooth and wildly easy to drink. A real treat."
"A highly tasty fresh hop ale. Look forward to having more. Seek this one out."
"D - This one goes down nice and easy. Tastes like I would imagine a fresh/wet hopped Mirror Pond. Definitely was better at cellar temperatures on the 2nd half of the bottles."
"A: 4.0, S: 4.5, T: 4.5, M: 4.0, D: 4.5"
"Notes: Deschutes brews another winner. What do they want? a cookie? Take my money instead and give me a case of this. Enjoy this at cellar temp to get the most out of this"
"Pours a very nice crystal clear gold into my Sam Adams glass. Frothy off-white head barely breaks one finger even with a somewhat vigorous pour and lacing is there but not overly thick. Surprisingly sweet malt aroma with clean floral hops and and blood orange coming through. Taste is not what I typically expect from a fresh hop but I have to say I'm impressed. The resin sticks to the teeth in a way that lets you know there really are some wet hops in there. The malts are just sweet enough to create a nice balance for the hops. Speaking of the hops, they start mellow and floral and increase their bitterness as the taste slowly works it's way towards the finish making it's way through sweet blood orange to stop briefly at grapefruit to end with some full-on rind. If there's a ""flaw"" in this beer it's in the feel, and it's a minor one. The carbonation is a little light and the overall presentation is a little on the thin and watery side. Seriously a small price to pay. All in all an excellent fresh hop pale ale that I wish was more readily available on the east coast."
"D: goes down very easily, nice drinkability. it is pretty similar to the mirror pond pale ale, only fresher, with a little more of a hoppy characteristic. Pretty nice beer, but I almost want even more of the fresh hop flavor."
"Pours a hazed amber/orange/honey color, with a sturdy two-finger foamy tan head, fades slowly into a film on top of the beer and a nice collar around the inside of the glass, sticky sheets of lacing all over the glass. Lots of juicy tangerine aroma, soft floral hops, grapefruit, and a sweet caramel malt backbone. Taste is right there with all the aromas, some bitter grapefruit, and a really nice bready malt presence. Perfectly carbonated, lively and refreshing, and couldn't be any more drinkable. An absolute treat, definitely one of the finest beers I've ever had."
"D - Fantastic, easy to drink brew that I keep my eye out for during harvest season."
"D: Very high!! I could do a keg of this stuff a week. One of the better pale ales out there imo."
"Lively mouthfeel, just a great beer."
"Hazed deep copper body. Very thin beige coating. Bubbly islands appear and then separate on the surface. Lace comes in moderate amounts of patchy artwork. This aroma is very fragrant, with minty tones coming through. There's some nice hop resin aroma as well, but it all comes back to this minty aroma. Interesting to say the least. I notice a nice firm body when I begin to taste this elixir. The carbonation is appropriately moderate. The flavor hits me with hops and a little malt all at once. This isn't overly hoppy (and I believe it is only 35 IBUS to my surprise), but it's a nice tasting beer nonetheless. The fragrant minty aromas are translated right over to the palate. The malt base is heavy on the caramel malts. The bitterness level is quite low. This is a nice tasting nicely balanced beer. However, for a ""wet hopped"" beer, I usually expect a little more hoppiness and bitterness. Solid APA nonetheless."
"Honestly this beer seemed to me like a poor man's (somewhat watered down) Sierra Nevada. I'm glad I tried it, now I'll move on to other brews. I was hoping for better."
"Three months go by too fast: Hop Trip comes out in October and goes back into hibernation at the end of December. Get yours as early after its release as possible: this beer's hop freshness is its outstanding characteristic. I've picked up bottles late in the season and been far less impressed."
"D: great flavor and great mouthfeel. great fresh hopped brew and highly recommended. I enjoyed it greatly."
"Mouthfeel is good; the carbonation is nice and high, keeping the hops from sitting around and clogging up taste buds. As mentioned, a slight malt twang in the finish, and I would say overall the beer's just a little too sweet. But damn good. Get it while it's fresh."
"for a beer with this name you'd expect a much stronger hop punch! smells of nice floral hops and tastes like a somewhat above average pale. not a ton of hops and goes down real easy. you could get real drunk on this beer, real drunk. it went pretty good with buffalo wings."
"T - Good mild taste of malt with an aftertaste of hops and citrus."
"D: Great APA, very drinkable, and highly recommended for the start of the week or the end."
"i wish i could be more specific about all the varied levels of mouthfeel and qaulity, but for my 2 cents, if you can try this beer...do"
"d. Not even a question here. I could drink this all night. I generally favor IPAs and DIPAs, but this Pale just blows me away and reminds me how great a good pale can be. Definitely heavy on the hop notes, but with an ale called Hop Trip, what else would you expect?"
"The drinkability is very good, a must try and drink it fresh for the most flavor. Prosit, MK"
"Super fat three fingers of thick light tan head has excellent retintion. Body is a honey amber in color. Leaves tons of scattered lace. Big crispy ops are sappy and nicely citrus baseds. A sweet hint of minerally malt is there also. Enters the mouth very smooth with a huge dose of green tea based hops. It really is like you droped a green tea bag into your beer and let it set there for a while before you take a sip. Minerals are consistant but even and pleasant tthrought. Mouthfeel is oddly kind of thick but nice. Super drinkable and it would go with a ton of foods. Well malt balanced also."
"Edit: A generous birthday gift from the future bro-in-law, fresh from Oregon. Nice golden color with great clarity and a sheet of lacing left behind. Fresh hoppy aroma and taste. Great smooth mouthfeel and drinkability very good. Overall a great example of the style."
"I poured it into a hurricane glass. Yeah, it's not the right glass, but this is what I had on hand. I got a 2 inch head on this thing and am looking at a cloudy burnt orange beer. Smells all sweet and spicy. Not a lot of hop nose, but it's there. This beer is well-balanced. Not a hop monster and not a malty mess. Just right. Buy this if you see it. Goes down smooth and makes for a nice drinking beer."
"Drinkability is good, it goes down easy. Not an outstanding beer in a highly competitive category."
"the beer pours an orangish color with tons of creamy tan head. the smell is very sweet and hoppy. i also detect a floral character to it as well as banana. the hop bitterness of this beer is not overwhealming and the malty sweetness is much more than i expected in a fresh hop beer. the taste is citrusy and i also detect honey maybe? the mouthfeel is medium but fluffy. this is an awesome beer i could easily drink several of and would seek out."
"This beer is one of the better pale ales I've ever had, up there with the sierra nevada pale ale and the widmer 07 pale."
"D- An excellent and highly recommended beer, esp. for warm days and with company."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer that I could drink for a long time."
"Thanks again tayner!!"
"Drinkability/Overall Impression: I'm very much enjoying this beer, and could easily drink several bottles in a session. At only 5.5% ABV, this isn't nearly as strong as many highly hopped offerings. For the amount of fresh hops that are in this beer, they are really balanced out well. I wish this was available in our area, as I would certainly drink it more often. I hope it is still available next autumn."
"D: A nice departure from your everyday pale ale. I could enjoy a couple of these on occasion."
"Thank you Lothore for the sample :)"
"I'll hunt down some other bottles around town and see how they compare. Why is this beer so expensive? $5.75 at Liquor Collection; $9 at Bar 35. :'( I guess the laws of supply and are at work..."
"Pours hazy / cloudy orange to copper with gold and amber inflections. Large, honey-gold head. Bubbly and quick with a bit of cream on top; leaves a couple of thin arcs in the way of lacing. Aroma is rich, full, and heavily citrus-floral with a mellow and cool undertone of honey; mild alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is amazingly juicy and slick, carbonation is fizzy and minimal. Flavor is a nice array of hop varieties on top of bread and cookie malts - fresh and bold but not overwhelming or unbalanced. Orange and tangerine are followed by mellow grapefruit. Finish brings a touch of pine; aftertaste is sweet, mild, and a touch oily."
"THis is a borderline IPA in my book, but just barely lacks the resin-stickiness. One of my top session beers of all time. Planning to grab up a case of this and hold onto until the summer. I would really enjoy this on a camping trip or a hot summer day."
"All in all, a great beer. The whole bomber went down very smooth and pleasing. If it was a bit cheaper, it would definitely qualify as a session beer for me. I hope it comes out again next year."
"D: This beer was really easy to drink, if I could get it on the east coast, it'd be a regular purchase of mine."
"Pours a beautiful orange/red copper color (if that makes sense) from a bomber. Nice white beige/white head that retains itself nicely with a small amount of lacing on the glass. Smell is everything one could want in a fresh hop pale ale. Citrus and floral hop aromas attack my nostrils with the fury of 1,000 dinosaurs. The taste is very good and walks a fine line between IPA and Pale ale. Slightly sweet with a full mouth feel and a nice bitter finish. I'm going to drink this now."
"Easy after work beer. Better with food then without. I don't think it's worth the effort, but the freshness is noticeable. :)"
"D- ridiculously drinkable, fantastic mouthfeel, great straightforward & simple flavor, this is a must every year, a definite treat"
"The taste delivers a hoppy presence all around, very big on the citrus and pine. A bitter, hoppy-warmth laces the finish. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a decent carbonation level. Overall, Hop Trip doesn't quite live up to its hype, but for a Pale Ale, it's right behind GD's Fresh Hop."
"Overall this was excellent. I had this on my wants list forever as I really wanted to try it and see how good it was, and it really did not disappoint in the slightest. I was thoroughly impressed with the well balanced approach as well as the freshness that was still obvious, even a few months later. I would look forward to trying this one out again next year for sure."
"A pitcher would be gone in no-time with a good pizza."
"This is just a really good beer. Almost like a mini Alpha King to me as far as flavor goes."
"Now I wish I hadnt waited so long to try one of these. Definitely one of the best tasting pale ales Ive had thus far. Ill certainly be picking up a few of these next time around."
"Thanks to mmmmBEEEER for sharing a bottle. This brew is a hazy orange-amber color with a medium off-white head that has decent retention. Stringy lacing. Hops and fruit in the nose, with a touch of pine. Medium-bodied with a soft hops character. Floral and grassy notes as well, plus malt and spice in the background. The finish is moderately hoppy and lingering. Overall this is a tasty and refreshing APA."
"Drinkability: It tasted good and definitely had great mouthfeel, but with all the other apa's out there, this one didn't stand out to make me want to have more. I'm glad I tried it, but it still is rather average. And because my favorite styles are maltier and darker, this had the regular apa effect of becoming a little boring by the last few sips."
"This may be my favorite beer from this company. Hop trip pours a light amber that is fairly transparent. The nose is very floral and mild hoppy, very hoppy but not as sharp as and IPA hoppiness. The first taste shocked me at the freshness of the hop flavors without bitterness, and even a sweet finish. This is no hippie staple like black butte, it is a good harvest ale. Calling it a pale ale does not do it justice. This makes up for the hairspray that is obsidian."
"Pours a light honey color with just a slight bit of haze, thick and creamy cream colored head last extremely long. Big piney hoppy nose, but not to the DIPA level. Tho hops seem to be a bit more subdued in the taste department, making it alot more balanced than i would've expected from the aroma. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Very Light and drinkable APA, low abv make this easily a great sessionable brew."
"Big thanks to tayner for the bomber!"
"D- Probably the best fresh hopped beer I have had. Just one great beer and shame they can't make this year round. I might have to go pick up a few more bottles before I can't find it anymore."
"This is a really tasty showcase of fresh hops. I liked it a lot."
"D: An excellent beer, tasty as hell and very easy to drink."
"D- Interesting pale malt that is definitely carried by the fresh tangy hops, lingering bubbly sweetness is pleasant, alcohol is well-masked, this is one unique APA, check it out if you have the chance!"
"Had on tap at the Concordia Ale House. Poured a dark amber/light brown with a tight head that fades to a cap and sticks around. Great lacing. There is an aroma of lightly floral hops, orange, and melon. The taste is fresh, clean, floral, and grassy. You can really taste the fresh hops. Quite fruity as well with brigght citrus and cherry. There is a grainy/malty finish ate the end. The mouthfeel is a little grainy and thick, especially for the style. Nevertheless, it's quite a delicious beer."
"thanks to tayner for this one"
"Poured to pint glass from bottle. Pours a mostly clear deep orange color with thick, one finger head. Good retention and lacing as well. Smell is of fresh hops and a slight citric note. Taste is good, nice balance of malt and hops but heavier on the hop side as expected. Has an oily hop taste and feel too it and slightly bitter aftertaste. I like the lower ABV on this as it makes it highly sessionable. Overall a good beer, solid 4's for me. The hops were great and tasted ""fresher"" than other wet hopped beer's this year."
"Pours a nice hazy orange. Great hops aroma. A foamy head that slowly dissipates after a few sips. The hops obviously dominates this beauty but the sweet malt is not lost. Really cleanses the palette too. Reminds me an IPA but the freshness of the hops makes this different then a strong IPA. Highly recommended if you find it. I paid around $4 for my bottle."
"Drinkability: Interesting style. I am going to seek out more fresh hop beers after this experience."
"This is a notes review."
"Excellent mouthfeel, hop juiciness. Extremely drinkable."
"Much better than from the bottle, the tapped version of this beer ranks near my absolute favorite APA of all time: Alesmith X."
"Thanks JohnGalt1 for this one. Poured a nice clear, amber into my SA glass. I found the aroma to be quite flowery, with a little spice, and the obvious hop smell. Taste was very pleasant, with a very distinct ""flowery"" taste. Reminds me of the jasmine taste in the Avatar IPA. Pretty creamy mouthfeel and finishes very nicely. To me, this is a very drinkable pale ale, with that ""fresh hop", flowery taste."
"Pours a clear burned orange with a big thick off white head that dies rather slow leaving big lacing on the glass. Nose is big ol hops but non abtrusive. Malt peeks out as well. Very tasty. A clean a crisp grapefruity hop that is well balanced and not bittering at all. Refreshing, crisp and smooth in the mouth with a very clean finish. Definition of a session beer."
"Newer vintages have been less impressive, though still good. Rating adjusted."
"D: This is a great fresh hop pale ale. Very tasty, and very balanced."
"another excellent beer from deschutes!"
"Pours a somewhat foggy light amber hue with a generous two finger fluffy off-white head that seems to stick around forever. Good stickiness, nice webbing on all sides of the glass. Smell is a clean and slick citrus hop of mostly fresh pink grapefruit. A hint of caramel malt appears in the nose as well. Not an overpowering scent at all, very pleasant and enjoyable to sniff. Big oily citrus hops up front with a tiny hint of dry grassy hops midway through. Aftertaste is extremely clean with a lemongrass like flavor that lasts. Mouthfeel is amazing. That's the one thing I've noticed with all these ""Fresh Hop"" style ales. They all have a fluffy light mouthfeel with a nice mild carbonation. Probably second in line to Great Divide's Fresh Hop Pale Ale. I'm really enjoying these ""Fresh Hop"" ales, l hope more breweries begin to brew this style."
"Overall, recommended. I enjoyed the SN Harvest Ale more than this, but this is still tasty."
"This is nice. Citrusy hops first, grapefruit and lemon zest, but not overpowering. Then a little toffee and caramel malt. Sweet and yet bitter. Big mouthfeel and very drinkable. Very nicely done."
"Thanks Younger I enjoyed this one!"
"Drinks too easy. I could happily session on this"
"This is not the greatest tasting beer in the world, but it's very nicely done, and it's lightness in body, flavor and alcohol make it highly drinkable."
"Drinkability- Sitting at 5.5% with superb balance, this is one hell of a good beer. Great hop presence for the Hop Heads but not enough to scare the rest of us away. Its a shame they can only make this beer once a year but well worth the wait. Its a fantastic treat!"
"Highly recommended, one of the best fresh hop beers I have had, but overly excited about its taste, everything else in on par, grab one of these before they are gone, if from my area, Hi-Time Wine Cellar in Costa Mesa still has several bottles of this for about the same price I paid for it"
"D: Probably the best overall wet-hop beer I have had to date, even better than Sierra Nevada Fresh Hop Harvest Ale. Definitely a treat if you can find it in your area."
"D: Heck yeah."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy off-white head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, hoppy, and lots of caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, slightly bitter, and some caramel. Slightly dry/bitter finish. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little APA from Deschutes, recommended."
"Pours a somewhat hazy rusted gold color with an adequate off-white head that diminishes quickly while leaving a few rings of lacing. The aroma is nice and hoppy. Floral, with both tropical and citrus fruit character. Like mangoes and oranges with a little jasmine or something. The taste is similar. Not much bitterness to this one. There is a light, honey-like sweetness that is actually quite pleasant. Not cloying at all. The mouthfeel is soft and somewhat oily with light carbonation that is just enough to tickle the tongue a bit and provide a small jab to the throat with each sip. Overall, a quality beer that would be easy for anybody to drink and enjoy."
"Above average American Pale Ale and crammed with fresh hop flavor. Very tasty and sessionable."
"Nice. A relatively mild ABV, with a strong hop taste. Not overdone, and very easy to drink. I became less impressed as I drank it, as the hop character seemed to fade. It could be past it's prime, as I assume the hop harvest was in the fall, so that is at least 7 months ago."
"Drinkability: Even though this beer has outlasted its prime tasting season, it is still a very nice brew; I've got to try it sometimes right after its made as that must just be incredible"
"For drinkability it's hard to beat this one. It's a smooth good tasting easy drinking brew that would be good anytime. As pales go this one is very very good. I'll look for more."
"This is a wonderful summer brew."
"Cheers."
"D: Session brew at it's finest. Low abv and quite easy drinking. Smooth and subtle fruit notes don't scorch the palate. A nice summer brew if you ask me."
"Has the taste of an AIPA; citrus and pine dominate. The caramel fades into herbal notes. Alcohol isn't very strong. The pine settles a bit and some persimmon takes over. Finishes a bit oily, a little crisp. 22oz is about enough, time to move on to something else."
"This is definitely an enjoyable beer, but I really do feel that this would have better been cast as an IPA, with a bit more malt thrown in the mash tun; it would help to balance the ample hops that seemed to have been used here. On the other hand this beer would not be quite so quaffable at an IPA's alcohol level."
"Overall, a very impressive, supremely rounded, soft-hop ale. Lots of flavor, but not knock-you-down or kick-you-in-the-nuts bitterness. Kind of like a sleepy, lazy summer day in the hammock. Very nice. Worth seeking out!"
"Poured this beer from a 22oz. bomber, this would be an excellent session beer if it was a little cheaper and/or I could find it in a six pack form. It pours a hazy orange with a nice creamy head topping it off. It does not have much aroma, a slight citrus smell is all I picked up. The initial flavor is a tingling hop sensation that coats my tongue, but not at all overpowering. This beer is very easy to drink while still having a substantial flavor and mouthfeel. I don't know if the fresh hops are what makes the beer so smooth, but this is a beer definitely worth trying. Great pale ale."
"Aroma is of soft floral and citrus hops- the dominant aromas, but not overpowering. Slight sweetness too. Flavor is of grapefruit, orange rind, some (slight, gentle) pine, and a light bready malt counterpoint. I like this beer. Easy to frink, it has a nice creaminess, but is interesting without being so complex that it requires a lot of thought. One of the better APAs I have had. I would love to get a chance to try it fresh."
"All in all a solid, and very drinkable beer. It didn't blow me away, but I'd have no problem having another."
"Since my review, Hop Trip has become a brew available locally and I've been buying it on a regular basis. As I'm sipping on a bottle right now, the first thing that strikes me is how wonderful the fresh hop flavour is in this brew. I've adjusted my rating accordingly..."
"Their website has some cool pictures of the fresh Crystal hops being shoveled into the hopback."
"D: One of the tastiest beers I have had in a while, would for sure buy this again."
"D: A welcome addition to Deschutes' line-up. This is one I'd definitely have again and will recommend. Nice flavor, a balanced APA and readily available (as of November 2006)...what's not to like?"
"D - The unique hop flavor alone is worth the purchase of Hop Trip. Low bitterness and intense flavor make for a rewarding and very drinkable treat. I look forward to getting my hands on some more fresh hopped brews this time of year."
"D: The fresh hops are really shine in this ale, adding a fresh zip that does not overpower the malt body. A well made beer."
"Tons of citrus and pine in the aroma, and umm, a subtle soapy hint. Its in the quaff too, darn it. Still, the floral kicks in and covers the soap by mid-bomber. Sharp, crisp and dry. I like it, just not overwhelmed or even impressed by it. Would not work hard to get another bomber of it."
"Purchased this bomber and finishing a Great Divide Fresh Hop Ale. I was surpisingly disappointed. It poured a light caramel color with moderate carbonation. Nice mouthfeel and light lacing down my glass. Smell was decently citrusy and hoppy, but nothing like what I was expecting. The taste reminded me of a average pale ale with slight bitterness. I hate to say it, but I was let down by this beer. I was expecting a lot more from it."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle this beer had a slightly hazy, amber-red color with a 2+ finger, off-white head of densely packed bubbles. The smell was excellent, much like a strong IPA - very fruity and inviting. The taste began moderately fruity and bitter, followed by much carbonation and a quick finish....starts like an IPA but ends like a Pale Ale. Mouthfeel was dominated by high carbonation and a mild - medium, not too lingering, dryness. Overall, I think the drinkability was exceptional. The lower ABV combined with the lively mouthfeel and taste make me rate this a 5-. Good stuff!"
"When I opened this bottle I was surprised that I got such a beautiful smell of fresh hops. Nice lacing and a nice orange-amber color. The first taste reminds me of hops, grass and peaches. The mouthfeel is thick and pleasant. I preferred this over Great Divide Fresh Hop by far. The low ABV adds to the drinkability.My first thought was to go back to the store and buy the remaining bottles, so I did. This is one of the best Pale Ales I've had in a long time. At 3.49 for a 220z. it was a really good deal. If you get the chance, try this one!"
"With the low ABV, I could have easily had another, but only bought one. DAMN!"
"Overall impression: Very nice - incredibly balanced and drinkable. A bit different than some of the other fresh hop beers I've tried, but I will certainly be looking for this every year. If only there were enough fresh hops to make six packs!"
"Good drinkability, tasty and easy to drink, hop character is not overly assertive, nicely balanced."
"For the most part the flavors are those of a standard pale ale--strong hop presence with extra fresh hints of pine oil, and it has a nice body through the finish that offsets some of the hops. What really makes this beer shine is it's mouthfeel. Perhaps this is where it's 'youth' comes out, as it has a softness across the palate that adds a just-right light touch to the overall character of the brew. I easily finished a bomber of this and would jump at the chance to grab another one."
"Very creamy mouthfeel, neither thin nor cloying. An excellent Pale Ale."
" Pours a pretty orange-amber color topped by an inch of creamy, off-white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. Inviting aroma of piney, lightly fruity hops, light caramel malt, and a whiff of grapefruit and pineapple. Palate is well-balanced, with the lightly sweet caramel malt complementing the tasty, assertive hops. Notes of pine and grapefruit are detectable, as is a little bit of maple(?). Body is a bit lacking in carbonation, but is nevertheless sturdy enough to convey the ample flavor quite well. If this were available fresh year-round, I'd drink it fairly often. Alas, it's a once-a-year treat that appears to lose its punch pretty fast. Grab it while you can, and make sure it's fresh."
"Tastes like oranges drizzled with caramel and good mint sauce. Stick aftertaste, but a nice lemongrass and ginger flavor helps keep the mouthfeel interesting. Free flowing carbonation also break up the honey cake aftertaste."
"Herbal, grassy and very medicinal hop aroma, with mild tropical fruits. Red/orange brick color. Intiially solely hop accented, in a nice way, until the beer warms and butter toffee and caramel-like malt flavor develop underneath. Grass, resin throughout with pine on the finish. Cool, fun beer. Thanks Deschutes. More creative beers like this, please."
"This is one heck of an APA. Very lovely. I would highly recommend trying this if you can. Very easy to drink, too."
"Overall: Tasty stuff. Deschutes is getting a nice coverage down the West Coast these days, and I pick them up when I see them. But having the pleasure of being further north over New Years than usual meant that I came across this rather rare brew. Glad I picked it up. Value for Money too at less than $3."
"Definitely worth checking out...especially if you like your pale ales with that little bit extra to offer the pallet."
"Oh these fresh hop ales gotta love em, I do thats for sure.Pours a rich auburn color with a creamy like white head that settles slowly leaving a sheet of lace behind,aromas are fresh and oh so piney it just jumps out at ya the citrus is there as well beneath the pine making the mouth water.This beer slides down way to easy if this was on tap somewhere near me I would camp out there I could drink all night and be satisfied.Fresh piney,citrusy hop over top of lightly sweet malt but just really damn fresh tasting thats what this beer and other fresh hop ales are about.I would say Great Divide Fresh Hop has a slight edge but this is a winner no doubt.Hoppedup and garagekegger will be happy when I present them each with a bottle for sure."
"Amber in colour with medium carbonation. Very hoppy aroma, but not in the expected c-hop APA kind of way. Theres some citrus quality to the aroma, but there are other fruits in there too (apple-pear maybe?), along with some gentle herbal notes. The flavors are of mild fruit (orange, tangerine, peach, MacIntosh apple), medium caramel malt, and the smallest touch of pine resin. Low to medium bitterness, which again, is unlike most of the beers of this style that Ive tried. A welcome change of pace. Very well made and very complex."
"Remember kids, this isn't an IPA. Yes, the label says ""Hop Trip", but this isn't an all-out hop-orgasm to destroy your palate. This is an extremely smooth, balanced APA with a very unique and tasty hop thang going on. Certainly worth a try, and quite sessionable."
"Drinkability: It should have been bigger, but fresh hops, if you love hops, are just the way to go. I'd like more flavor, but the flavor and aroma you do get are hard to beat. Loved it."
"Pours a one finger dark tan head over a cloudy copper liquid. Smells citrusy hops during the pour. To the nose, it's butterscotch, caramel, apricot, grapefruit pith, and some orange oil. Tastes malty, but dry. Like oodles of munich malt was used. Flat grassy, but I think not from the hops, I think it's the malt. Woody dry hops with a hint of oranges. No grapefruit or pith to be detected and hop bitter is mild at best. Huh, that description matches how Goldings taste to me and I don't see how Goldings would be used as the hops in an APA. No fruity esters. Instead I taste pot-roast beef, deep and flat, late in the taste. I'm not impressed. Nice body for an APA, it's md-thick with a chewy quality. Moderate carbonation that forms bubbles on the flat of the tongue, but that do not detract from the flavors. Towards the end, the hops do become apparent as a mild, but persistant chalky dryiness. Overall, I'm not fond of the taste of this beer, but the other qualities are quite good."
"Found this fine beer at a market near my parents house where I grew up, they have a fine selection of beers. This poured a medium amber and the head lasted all the way down and left plenty of lacing on the way. Nice piney fresh hop taste and that is the point right? This beer is made with fresh or wet hops. The ""fresh"" taste was there but not quite as up front as I had hoped, I'm sure on tap this is a killer. Good though with a nice malt backbone as well. Just a bit teasing. Mouthfeel, didn't know how to rate it because this is the most full bodied pale I have ever had. Mixed feelings but had to rate it high as it was not only thickish but had a very creamy feel as well. Drinkable, yes of course. Fine beer and glad I stumbled across it."
"It's really too bad they only make this in the early fall. I would love to have this year round, especially in the summer. Deschutes really nailed this one."
"Loving hops as I do, it's no wonder that I love a fresh, hoppy ale brewed by a great Pacific NW brewery. Prior to cracking the crown, I would have bet a considerable amount that a Crystal-exclusive APA couldn't possibly have impressed me this much. I don't mind being proven wrong though. Not if it means that I get to drink another outstanding beer from the good folks at Deschutes. Hop Trip begs to be made year-round."
"This is rather dark for a pale ale, on the darker side of copper. It has a good clean fresh herbal hop smell with hint of brown sugar. It smells more like many of the superior NW IPA's than a pale ale. Unusually this tastes justs as the nose suggests. It has a very full flavour for a pale ale and decent carbonation. Normally I tend to give pale ales a miss in favour of IPA's, but this one is definitely worth a try. Good stuff!"
"Notes: It tasted like a well brewed pale with a bit more raw hop flavor. My first brew from Deschutes and they are off to a good start."
"22-oz. bomber purchased from Bottleworks in Seattle. Poured into a large pint glass, this has a nice light copper color with a thin but persistent head. Smell- and taste-wise this is like the beer equivalent of a Sauvignon Blanc, what with it's fresh green grass, melon, pineapple, herbaceous, woodsy, and slightly mineral-tinged profile. The raw green leafiness of the hops is especially prevalent in the nose, and the pineapple/melon flavors are more noticable in the taste, probably because of the sugars from the sturdy malt backbone kicking in. Finishes fairly sweet, would prefer a bit more dryness, but this is a unique beer and a good one."
"I expected this beer to be much different. more like a strong IPA. It has a wonderful amber color, and retains it thick head nicely. At first I was disapointed. I thought, ""Kinda weak for a beer named Hop Trip."" But then I realized that this is supposed to be a hoppy pale ale. It has a nice hoppy bouquet, not over powering, just perfect. The hops and malt are balanced perfectly, leaning twords hops. A little is left to be desired at the end, but another swallow cures that. The beer has a slight carbonation and an excellent mouthfeel, not to watery and not to thick. I think this beer is perfect for many meals when you feel like smething a little lighter. Although, this beer is not a light beer, and it is hoppy."
"If you like hops, you'll love this beer. It may be a bit of a one trick pony to be an everyday beer but it's highly enjoyable and I'm already looking forward to having another one."
"Pours a gorgeous deep mahogany with a very big head. Smell is of hops - yep, there are hops in this brew. Taste...well, I'm disappointed. There's just no bottom end to this brew. The taste disappears as soon as it hits the back of my tongue. Easy to drink, but I'll continue my pursuit of world-class hoppy beers elsewhere..."
"Drinkability  I think this is a superbly drinkable beer and I didnt want to put it down. This is probably more geared toward hops fans, but should be restrained enough to be enjoyed by anyone who loves American Pale Ales and fresh craft beers."
"Great drinkability I am hapy to see Deschutes hasnt ""lost it""..excellent Fall ale."
"Drinkability- I like this one. Kinda like a Sierra Neavda, but maybe with a touch more hops. Very well rounded. Session worthy IMO. Getting more next time."
"A decent beer that I'm glad I tried but wouldn't be in any huge rush to try again. If you're looking for a hop fix, look elsewhere. If you want to explore hop taste a bit, then try it. Not a bad beer, but maybe a different name would be better suited to those of us longing for hoppiness!"
