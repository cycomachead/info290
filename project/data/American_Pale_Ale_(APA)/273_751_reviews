"Overall, while aroma and flavor are light, the creamy smoothness of the mouthfeel keeps this interesting and going back for another sip."
""
""
"Surprisingly bland. I bought into the blanket the market hype. Should have read up first. In a blind taste test it could be a domestic lager almost. Semi sweet, very little hop bite."
""
"SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale -----4/5."
"I really want to love Sweetwater because it's easy for me to find here in VA. But it just isn't in the cards. I will happily drink their beers when offered, but there are many better options available."

"Great beer paired with pizza"

"Nothing to write home about. Not pleasant on the nose and lacks any real hoppy taste that I enjoy regarding IPA. Taste is average. I've bought it a few times when building a 6-pack, but likely won't venture to it again. It's just okay."
"There are better extra pale ales out there but this will do if you are in the Atlanta area. Not a bad beer, decent taste for sure. The marketing is highly amusing too!"

"Only ok. Not great on nose and hops just didn't do it for me."
""
""
""
"Sierra Nevada pale ale is 3x better... and I usually trash SN"
""
""
""
""
"Clean and crisp, refreshing not overly hoppy. Above average for me, thus a 4."
""
""
"Nothing special but not terrible."
""
"Pours a golden/amber. Slightly sweet herbal/pine flavor. Fairly mild and smooth."
""
"an in depth review is not nesc. (refer to rating) I wasn't a big fan of this beer, but it wasn't bad by any means. That coming from a guy who isn't really in to hoppy beers. love the label. love the look"
""
"    Overall, I'll give Sweetwater 420 Extra Pale Ale - SweetWater Brewing Company a 4.25. This is a quenching brew that I'll probably grab again."
"Sweetwater 420 is a filtered brew, you can see right though it.  The smell is rich with hops and grains. You also pick up on some malts in the smell of this brew. Now for the taste, it is bold with flavor. There is a lot going on in this brew. Hops is the first thing you pick up on, but it is not over powering to brew. The mouthfeel is, bitter, but smooth.  Sweetwater 420 Extra Pale Ale has a nice balance to it there is nothing overpowering in this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.25 out of 5."
""
""
""
"One of my favorites. The extra pale makes it very mild in terms of bitter hoppiness"
"Refreshing pale ale. Very safe and enjoyable."
""
""
"A go-to summer beer. No Pale Ale has ever blown me away."
""
"It was OK. Nothing outstanding here but a good warm weather beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden with lots of sediment white head well retained, smells of yeasts bready malts and hops, tastes of cool malts and then spicy citrusy floral hops smooth mouthfeel lasting finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly average pale ale.  Look, smell and feel are on point, in line with what you'd expect from a straight-forward pale ale, though nothing really noteworthy that stands out.  But the taste is very single-note, sharply bitter in an unpleasant way, not pleasantly hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am really surprised to see this one rated as low as it is. I mean, a nice crisp citrusy low alcohol American pale that's balanced without being heavy, distinct on the hops, and about as refreshing as one could imagine. Deliciously fresh, bursting with lemony hop aromatics and a hint of orange zest to the taste, great hot weather session beer, and I think easily my favorite beer I have had from these guys. No caramel malts getting in the way, it stays nice and light. Pale, like a pale ale should be but so few really are anymore, not trying to do too much, while simultaneously doing it all. Love it!"

""
""
""
""
"Boring, that's all I have to say."
""
""
"First SweetWater beer- I'm intrigued and want to try more."
""
"This is decent offering for the style. It is very good on a hot summer day. No significant aroma, slightly hazy, with a foam that sticks around. A little extra hoppy with some florally taste, it's got a bite as it settles in the mouth. Almost sessionable if you need to pick up a 12 or case."
""
""
""
"Wonderfully sweet but not oversweet pale ale with a hop bite that almost anyone can enjoy."
""
"Unique and great tasting Pale Ale. Lighter and more hoppy than some other Pale Ales. Love to see the unfiltered sediment. Gets me excited to get to the bottom of the bottle. I would recommend letting the beer warm up if it was in the fridge. Much better at around 45-50 degrees."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Working off old notes.  Will update with more details if/when I have another."
""
""
" Deffintly worth trying if you have not yet done so."
""
"Overall, this was a nice beer to have with lunch, something different than the beers I usually drink that went very nicely with the food (no clashing of flavors noticed, despite how drastically different they were--piney/minty pale ale vs. salty fries and spicy chicken.)  I'm glad I ordered it.  It's easy to find in stores around here, so it's nice to know if I ever feel like drinking something more hoppy than  the usual (and don't want to worry about the high bitterness that tends to come with stronger beers like IPAs) I won't have to go far to find a pint (or a six-pack) of this one."
""
"Taste-Tropical fruit, piney hops, bitter edge throughout. Overall nice flavor and character"
""
""
"This is a very common beer in Florida.  I finally picked one up.  Most stores sale 6-packs, but I finally found one that sells them loose.  It's similar to Sierra Pale Ale, but a bit more dry.  Pretty solid beer.  Mine was pretty close to it's expiration date.  Had it been fresh and on draught, it could have scored even higher in my book.  As it was, not a bad option."
""
""
"L: Poured a 1inch of fluffy white head, with a honey colored body, and as you drink, there is a good amount of lacing around the glass.  S: Nice hoppy aroma.MF: Smooth with medium carbonation. T: A great bitter taste throughout the drink, with a very mellow sweet grains-like balance, and with each sip there is a wonderful clean finish. Overall,  a great IPA!"
""

"Reasonable taste For an APA"

"A hazy dark straw gold. Lots of good stuff on top that leaves good lacing and stays quite a while. Aromas of caramel and citrus. Some roasted grains. Taste is a bready front with a fast transition to a tight bitterness. Finish is short and clean with a light linger of bread. Crisp medium feel perfect carbonation. A hold solid brew. You can keep this one on hand for whatever."
"It was an ok one"

"Hops, hops, and more hops! It's a bit of a single-note beer but it's played well. A bit of a citrus aftertaste, grapefruit particularly."

"As far as pale ales go, this is a good one.  I live in Michigan, but lived in Georgia for 3 years so got my first taste of this from draft and it was great.  Any time I visit GA or have anyone from GA coming to MI, I request 2-3 cases to come with them for a visit."
"It definitely has a fruity side but its an overall great summer beer. If you're planning to drink out of the bottle, give this one a consideration!"

"12 oz bottle. best by 12/01. hazy golden color. about a finger of head dissipated quickly. medium bodied, smooth-very quaffable(word?). bold citrusy hops, a little floral. biscuity/bready malt balances nicely. a few of these would be great by the grill in the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"True to the name of an extra pale ale,  nice strong hoppy flavor a must try for those who love IPAs."
""
"This beer is well crafted, but the aromas and flavors don't get me overly excited. Yes, they stay true to style. It's not bad, but it's not memorable and there are many other examples of the style that I personally enjoy more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A bit simple compared to many of the bold ales out there these days but at the same time it's nice to be able to relax with a beer that's tasty and not over the top"
""
""
""
""
"Remarks:  not bad overall; I got it while camping and was happy with it."

"very nice easy drinking IPA,nice aftertaste smooth"
"subtle is the operative descriptor with this one. easy drinking with a perfect bitterness. definitely fits the easy going image of the brewery. perfect 420 beer to quench ones thirst. as to the negative reviews, maybe you just need to step back and chill on this one, youre definitely not getting it."

"The color of this beer has a haze of orange color to it. I could taste the hops in this beer. It has a malty taste to it as well. It was not that bad of a beer. It was not my favorite beer from Sweetwater but it was not that bad. It had a bitter finish to it as well. It also finished on the dry side as well."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours slightly cloudy orange with a small white head that leaves some lacing. Smells of citrus and piney his, orange jumps out.tastes of slight piney and earthy hops with some citrus, but kind of opposite of the aroma. Beer is nicely carbonated very smooth, light body. Overall a very good beer."

"Poured this gift into a pint glass. Nice light amber color and a pretty sticky two-finger white head that produces a little lace. Get an aroma of rising bread dough and some floral hops. Sweet smelling too. Flavors are white yeast sweet bread, with a tinge of caramel/vanilla, and a very pleasant mild, but slightly peppery and grassy hop nip. Nice feel and carbonation. I like this one a lot. Could drink several of these."
""
"It tasted a little like an IPA but not as IPA-ish. Much better colder than when it warmed up sitting on the table. I could see drinking this beer in the summer or the winter and I could probably drink more than one."

"Over all I would say this is a good Pale Ale. Nice golden color. I poured mine from a bottle into a glass and it actually had pretty consistent lacing on the glass. It has a mild bite of hops to it (not overpowering) and leaves a good taste in your mouth after you take a sip. I would say this one shoots right down the middle for me as a good pale ale."
""
""
""
"Probable the ""palest"" pale ale I've ever had... it wasn't kidding about being ""extra pale."" Extremely crisp and drinkable with just a tiny hops edge, along with some pine undertones. Pours clear amber. Hit the spot on a summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer. Not as hoppy as an IPA but still a nice hopiness that gives this beer some real flavor. Most certainly will have again."

""
""
"O-delicious extra pale ale. Drank it for lunch in savannah, ga"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a clear medium amber with a creamy white head. The head has moderate retention but leaves some nice lacing, aided with moderate carbonation. The aroma is mild, with mostly caramel sweetness dominating. The taste is also pretty mild, with some fruit and stronger, if less defined bitterness. There's a pretty good weight to the body and a little bite from the carbonation. A good pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An acceptable pale ale but this one just seems like your typical well made pale ale from the craft scene 10-20 years ago. There are just too many better made and flavorful pales on the market today making this one very forgettable. Still an easy drinker but forgettable."

"o: A lightweight summer refresher. The lack of body helps it be so but does not encourage a particularly positive overall impression."
""
"O: Every beer has its place to me: this fulfills a role similar to Fat Tire or Boston Lager, in that it's a rock-solid everyday beer (frankly, it's a bit better than Fat Tire, but that's neither here nor there...) This isn't a beer that bowls you over with flavor or complexity, this is something you kill by the 6 pack while barbecuing or fishing. Because of this, it gets 3.5's across the board from me."

"Overall: My dad recommended this to me as possibly the best beer in America. In the old-world style of good, real ale, this beer is hard to beat. The balance between biscuit, fruit, and bitterness is just too good to miss. A hair less sweetness for more bitterness and you'd have me cramming perfect 5.00's all the way down."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite beers. This beer is so unique. There is no other like it. I'm more of an IPA guy myself and while this is not an IPA, it is close. Very hoppy (for a non IPA). I live in atl and this beer is everywhere here. I feel sorry for those who cannot get your hands on this. It is truly a treat."

"Medium gold with lots each of both brightness and clarity, it's certainly pale but edging toward amber. The head is compact, very close to pure white and almost one finger tall. Lace consists of both patching and spotting. The aroma takes some time before the hops come out. It starts grainy, but that backs down as it breathes. When it does, it displays a simple balance of floral bitterness and biscuit while a ghost of buttery, sweet grains flashes in vaguely and briefly. The hops take time on the tongue as well, floral with a little rawness. Biscuit is still there in the malts, though the butter vanishes entirely. It takes on some dryness as hops bitterness shows a leafy aspect. Breadiness in the malts adds texture to the body while it bites on the tongue. The body eases toward light."

"This is the first offering I've tried from Sweetwater, had on tap at Taco Mac. It's a decent pale ale, but not my favorite. Decent hop and malt mix, but not quote as robust of a flavor as I'd like. Good looking beer dark golden-brown color. Not a huge fan overall."

"The dense, two fingers of French Vanilla-colored head looked like the top of an ice cream cone. Color was a deep gold with NE-quality clarity and the Three Stooges, King Midas, Croesus and Mammon began fighting for a taste. SRM = 5. This is going to seem odd, but the nose reminded me of golden raisins! And/or honey plus a breadiness. Wild. Mouthfeel was pretty full for the style and I swear that it tasted more like honey than the mead I had on Wednesday. It would not be sustaining for a hophead, but it was a nice diversion. Finish was so honey-like that I began to question whether I might not be drinking a lager. It was very sweet, especially for the style. What were they smoking when they developed this recipe?!?"
""
""
""
""
"Golden finish, very clear. Beer had a nice floral aroma but finished much more malty than I expected from a pale ale. Though it was a nice surprise. Was served in a tulip glass. Not much of a head to speak of, but that could have been the keg. I would order this again. Good beer."

"This beer was purchased at Ingles' market in Athens, TN. In a 6 pack of bottles consumed one a night for 6 days. Appearance is a brownish copper. Has notes of citrus, caramel, and flowery overtones. Very strong hop notes. Extremely carbonated. Very light malt notes. Very drinkable but the carbonation level needs to be backed off. Nice fruity caramel taste which has heavy hop notes. Needs more malt to balance the palate. Very excellent overall for it's class. Easily a 3.8-4 out of 5 the same. Easily available in my area as are most all Sweetwater beers are. Would have this beer again. Enjoy this a lot."

"A mediocre ""extra pale ale"". I'd pass on it next time."

"I poured it into my glass, it gave me a nice golden color with a small foamy head. The smell has a citrus and some malt to it. The taste has a crisp malt backbone with a good cittus hop flavor to follow. Well balanced, mouthfeel is smooth and overall a good ale."

"This was solid good beer. Nice golden creamy color and a lace that lingers. Smelled malty and crisp, a little citric, but not very strong. Taste was bready and malty, really nice dry hop finish though. Drinkable and good, perhaps nothing out of this world, but definitely worth a try."

"Has always and will always be my go-to beer for the summer. This one has a much more citrus kick than any IPA I have had and almost has a rush of grapefruit on the initial sip until the hops come into play. I don't mind the stronger carbonation but I can see where this may be a turn off to some. The citrus notes really take the edge off the ABV so be careful (or not) lest you start feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. If you're anywhere in the southeast, look for the rainbow trout on the tap. You won't be disappointed."

"The taste is grassy, malty and grainy but very light. Light hops end the taste. Super smooth on the tongue and the carbonation has no bite, this tastes and feels watery. The watery feel makes it very easy but the watery taste detracts from what could be a relatively well done beer."
""
"Flavor has some toasty malt as well, with a nice little touch of sweetness. Hops are there, but have a rindy bitterness. It's not overly citrussy, again much more rindy, pithy and bitter than anything else. Not bad... Better fresh? Well, if offered one I would try another, but I won' t seek it out. Prosit!"

"Wow if I could get Sweetwater here this would be a regular pick up for me. Really well done stuff. I guess this goes to show that BA ratings are all subjective... This gets a 83???? I enjoyed this a lot more then some of the top APAs I have had. My hat is off to you Sweetwater!"

"OVERALL: A quite drinkable pale ale with good hop dankness or frankness rather. Drinkable and enjoyable. Worth swigging on a hot summer night, that's for damn sure. Doing GA proud on this one."

"Overall 3.50: Good, standard beer. Flavor balance is well-tuned and refreshing. Those of us who are not hop-obsessed (not me!) will appreciated the focus on malt and grain balance present in this brew. It is slightly sweet and the sweetness is cloying, which interferes with certain foods (such as salty pizza, salty cheeses, etc.). Overall, however, this is a solid beer. Get past the foolishness of their marketing and there is a rock-solid center. Who'da thunk it?"

"Well I guess I won't fight the tide here. A fine beer, and one that I can definitely see myself ordering again. Maybe I'm a little new to the game when it comes to finer beers, but I still can't quite see how this is classified as a ""pale"" ale. It's got way more bite than other pale ales I've drank in the past. But, that's not dragging this beer's name in the mud or anything: It's top stuff!"
""
""
""
"Have had a ton of this beer! Highly recommend. As most of all sweetwater beers are amazing. It's starting to get more and more popular in bars and restaurants as far as the taps go. You can find it in just about any beer store in the southeast. If you see it try it."

"I just really love this beer. Like an old friend, 420 never fails to please. An excellent example of a well rounded, well balanced pale ale. Great year round, just enough hops to make it different with a great balance. Wonderful color, great pairing with burgers or ribs."

Leaves a small pale ale taste in your mouth. The smell isn't strong but has a good flavor over all. Overall one of my favorite beers around."

"O: After having a couple of these in a bar in southern Georgia I had to look up the style. I was certain it was a pisner or a czech pilz, a lager of some kind. Clearly i was wrong. if you like GI honkers ale or SA Boston Lager this has a very similar vibe, but with a bit more hop bitterness."
""
""
""
"This is a great drinking IPA. It is not a super hoppy monster, but that is not what it is supposed to be. i think it fills the niche of a very drinkable Pale Ale very well. its got a good level of citrus and carbonation, its not too heavy on the palate, and you can just keep on drinking it. overall a good beer, perfect for anything from tailgating to a night out."

"Light grainy gold with a solid quilt of fine white foam. Smells faint - grain, sweet malts, some corn and a little grassy (dried grass). Taste is corn, resin, a little bitterness, really tastes cheap; almost reminds me of corn pops cereal. Medium bodied with moderate carb and a semi dry finish. Meh."
""
""
"Ap: The pour is clear and burnt orange in color with a small fluffy white head. S: The nose is somewhat floral with a light citrus component. Very light. T: The hop profile is almost all floral. Medium long finish that may be the most satisfying component of each sip. M: The body is on the light end of medium with a crisp and plentiful carbonation. O: This is one of my least favorite styles. However, the floral hops and the lightly sweet taste provide a refreshing brew."

"O. A light, crisp, pale with dry bitterness. This in no way resembles the hop forward pale ales that have emerged in recent years such as Zombie Dust and Perpetual. An adjunct-like malt bill and one dimensional hop presence make this a classic pale. Which doesnt make it bad. Just not particularly impressive. I would say this is the least enjoyable of the Sweetwater year rounds for me."

"Pours a slightly hazy light orange, big thick head, tons of carbonation. Very pretty pale ale. Smells great, juicy pine hops, not overwhelmingly piney, just the right amount for a pale ale. Herbal and flowery as well. Goes down smooth and crisp, nice light mouthfeel. However, I'm picking up a slightly metallicy taste, which I don't expect out of any craft beer. Overall it's a good beer to compliment any meal or occasion, but there are better APA's out there."

"On tap while on a trip with the wife to Amelia Island. Pours a clear golden copper color with a slight white head. Nice sweet citrus and floral aroma. Flavor is a nice citrus bite with sweet light malts balancing. Could use a bit more flavor, but overall a decent pale. Finishes a little dirty. Easy drinking for a day outside overlooking the water."

"Sweetwater 420 pours a hazy golden color with an excellent head. The aroma is a muted grain and citrus affair. 420 fairs much better on the tongue, with a mellow citrus hop over grainy malts. Very refreshing and flavorful. The mouthfeel is a bit fuller than expected, and the drinkability is great. 420 is just an excellent beer to kick back and relax with. It's tasty and easy to drink."

Bright flavors on this: orange peel and rind, tangerine, a little grassy and earthy too in the mid palate, fresh bread holds this beer up well. Moderate carbonation and a light body make this pretty easy to drink beer. Its smooth, refreshing, and well balanced."

"It looks nice, but if I were trying this blind, the nose would certainly not lead me to believe it was an APA. Very muted with a mild malt and sweet tone there that is just odd. Flavor is not too bad. Hearty, but not brash. I consider this an ""old school"" APA. You know, old school as in 6 years ago. Before we went for palate obliteration and all.It's easy to drink and nice. I'd be interested in trying it on cask as it strikes me as more English than American in style."

"Who could resist a beer named 420? It's always 420 somewhere. Honestly this beer is born to be mild. Nothing about it just jumps out and grabs you. It pours up a clear pale gold with a beautiful off white 3 finger head. Elaborate and lasting rings of lacing can be observed as the glass empties. The smell is so subtle that my non-sensitive nose could barely pick anything up. Taste is sort of grapefruity and sweet with not much hoppiness on the finish. Still this would make a good session beer as it is very drinkable, if lacking distinction."

"M - Light body. Somewhat creamy. Moderate carbonation."

"Mediocre at best. Is better suited as a college aged hipster beer. That's the market for this beer and the brewery and they found it. They're afraid if they change it, they will lose the hipster crowd that consumes this. It's not horrible, but it could be better. Spend the extra money and get some Dale's Pale."

"I really do not know what to think of the 420. Its not bad...but its not one my top fav list either. The beer poured golden yellow with thin white head that is lacing mildly. The smell is more english hop than the pine/fruit west coast hops. The taste has a slight sweetness to it was a slight balance of bitterness. The body is medium with good carbonation. Overall it is drinkable and worth a shot."

" The taste is tangy, slightly lemony with subtle malt tinge which is slightly toasted with some floral hop tastes which verge on tea-like with light astringency and nice creamy element from the yeast in the background. I was happy to try this as it is a drinkable pale, I would not be opposed to having this again."

Not much to recommend here. Disappointed."

"A hook up from Colby, thanks man. Bottled dated best by 3/28/12 poured to pint glass. The beer pours a translucent pale straw color with a small 1/2 finger white head with virtually no retention and minimal lacing. The nose is rather mild, more of a sweet crystal malt presence than hops, which is odd considering the name of the beer. Hints of earthy hops but mostly malty nose. The flavor is more inviting than the nose lets on, a gentle blend of crystal malt with a light earthy bitter together with a fruity sweetness. Nothing is all that pronounced rather well balanced. A mild bitterness and lingering fruity character remain on the tongue. Light bodied and decently carbonated. Overall, a treat to try. I've been wanting to try this on name and label alone. I know it's won some awards so it was nice to try. Not earth shattering but solid."

"A solid enough beer, if not my favorite in the Sweetwater stable. Essentially, this is a transition beer, and in that sense it provides a nice entry into the world of craft beer for many a drinker. It serves as a better alternative than many another possibility for this role. Fairly light all around, with a modicum of bitterness, especially at the finish. Crisp, pleasant, good lawnmower beer with a bit more hops and character than the usual for the task. Fairly dry, and with a snappy finish. Serves its purpose."

"O- I don't know if people outside of Georgia know the impact this beer has had in our state. It is one of the most widely drank beers here and has played a huge role in pulling people away from Bud/Miller/Coors. I'm not saying its the best there is, but its pretty damn good and has to be the most common gateway beer here. It was definitely one of mine."

"Overall you can't go wrong with this brew. I'll never forget my first run in with SweetWater 420. I was at a outdoor summer concert in Hotlanta. The temperature was high enough to melt steel, the opening bands sucked and the only beer I could find was Coors Light in 24oz cans. Shameful I know. I wouldn't wash my feet in that shit now. But then later while the main band was playing (Slayer) I found a beer kiosk that was in the process of closing and they only had SweetWater 420. The guy poured me the beer--on the freaking house because he had already closed the register or something--and I thought I was the luckiest man on earth. I was blown away after the first sip. This is great stuff but imagine what it tasted like after a hot day, drinking nothing but Coors Light."

It would make a nice addition to any tailgating session since it won't destroy your tastebuds for a wide variety of foods. However, if you want a really flavorful, more assertive pale ale to drink and enjoy, I'd suggest a Sierra Nevada. It is superior, possibly cheaper, and more easily found."

"Pours a clear golden brown with one finger of white head. Head has good retention and leaves rings of lacing down the glass. Smells and tastes of biscuit malt, a bit of pine and citrus. Slightly bitter on the aftertaste, but not that intense. Overall a good pale ale, but doesn't really stand out."

"I've had 420 many times. It is one of my staple beers. It is one of those beers that is perpetually inviting, excellent for warm summer days and the beach. It is an excellent Extra Pale Ale with an above average flavor and aroma. The mouthfeel is crisp, perfect for the thirsty soul. Enjoy!"

"Would I buy again...sure...not a bad beer with food. Would I plunk down 8 bucks for a 6...maybe. Overall not bad. I would like to see a little more boom..but we can live with that."

"Overall a solid pale."
"D: Goes down pretty easily, but it's not completely pleasant.  Pretty watered down and very subdued in flavor.  Definitely not comparable to a west coast IPA and definitely a little disappointing.  A Sweetwater beer for ya, though."
"Medium to light mouthfeel that has a nice finish that contributes to a very good drinkability. Overall, an enjoyable brew that would hold up well in session."
"Not a standout, but more than drinkable, and an enjoyable brew well-done."
"O- An okay APA, but nothing particularly special. Not on par with their IPA."
"Overall, it's not bad, but the flavor profile is very light. For an APA it's inoffensive and drinkable, but hardly pushing the envelope for the style."
"Overall, a solid, drinkable, sessionable Pale Ale with a little extra oomph. Very enjoyable."
"12 ounce bottle, best by 9/12/11, so just after the best by date. Pours cloudy golden amber color with 1-2 fingers of a fairly dense white head with good retention that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap. Small bits of lacing cling to the glass as well. Aromas of sweet caramel malt, orange, citrus, and grapefruit; with a bit of pine and spices. Decent aromas, but they are fairly weak. Taste of caramel, spices, citrus, pine, and a bit of grapefruit and other light fruitiness. Small amount of bitterness on the finish with lingering notes of spice, pine, and citrus. The initial flavors seem a bit subdued, but they are well balanced. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nice and smooth mouthfeel, with great drinkability. No alcohol in the taste or finish noticed. Overall a nice pale ale that is very sessionable and quite tasty."
"Crisp, medium-bodied. Nice enough beer to get me ready for my flight."
"Overall: Really not that great of APA there was not one category that I was actually impressed with"
"Beer was served in a pint glass. Nice golden amber color with a small half-inch head that rapidly dissipated. A slight amount of lacing but plenty of carbonation. More hops than a regular Pale Ale but not as much as an IPA. Overall a great summertime beer."
"Bottle into shaker. Pours a nice amber color with a nice white head that fell very fast. Nose was of citrus and flowers with a undernote of some pine as well. It was a little lighter in body than I expected and a bit sweet at first, with a little bite at the end to make it crisp. Overall this was a very refreshing brew and very well balanced."
"The beer is a little thin, but very easy drinking. Very well balanced"
"Drinkability: A good but not great pale ale. This has everything one could ask for in a beer of its style, but doesn't offer much to truly set it apart. This is a versatile beer that can go with a good variety of foods, though, and is common here in Pensacola and makes for a good go-to beer."
"O: Solid beer. I'd much rather prefer the Sweetwater IPA, but this is a nice APA. I picked up a sixer of this while in Savannah and enjoyed it very much. I've yet to have a bad beer from Sweetwater, I'd love to be able to pick their offerings on a regular basis."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden straw color with a thinnish bubbly white head that quickly dissipates to a ring. Smells of sweet grainy malt, orange and citrus round out a fairly mediocre nose. Taste is sweet grainy malt with lots of orange zest type flavors. Earthy with hints of lemon, different but not bad. Medium body, light to medium carbonation with a sweet almost watery mouthfeel. Nothing objectionable here but certainly nothing I would seek out again. If it were a hundred degrees out this might make a decent lawnmower beer."
"O: Delicious and refreshing. Great flavor and very enjoyable."
"delicious, flavorful, potent, but not overhopped or too malty. it's really well balanced, light, and flavorful. hits all the right notes. I've been fortunate enough to try this a few times, and I love it every time."
"Damn good."
"Pours a transluscent, golden straw color with about a half inch of foamy white head. Head dissipates quickly, but does leave a bit of lacing on its way out. Smells of grains, a bit of lemon, some faint hops, and perhaps a bit of orange. Beyond that, smell is a bit ""watery"" though still inviting for a pale. Tastes similar, but is very balanced. A bit more hop character is noticeable in the middle, and there is a faint alcohol presence near the end, which seems odd. Still, the rest of the flavors are balanced phenomenally and lend some additional refreshment to the drink. Mouthfeel is smooth, and pretty typical of a pale. Overall, a solid offering that I'm sure I would revisit were I in the area."
"Dark gold pour with a thin white head and no lacing. Aroma is lots of bready malts, accented by a nice amount of citrus hops. Flavor is sort of doughy, and a little sweet. Just a very slight bitterness, but there is a lot of citrus flavor in there. Palate is smooth and bigger-bodied than the ABV would indicate. I wasnt expecting much based on others’ ratings, but this one impressed me. Probably not as bitter as a traditional pale ale, but very drinkable. Good session-type beer."
"Overall: I feel that the 420 and the Blue though the flagship beers are overall mediocre. This is a nice halfway between an IPA and APA but the flavor is a bit off."
"Overall: I would have liked this beer to be a little more balanced and the finish was way too slick. Don't really feel the need to have another."
"Overall - In general, a nice interpretation of the style. However, definitely not my favorite APA. With that said, would I have more of this again? Absolutely. Judging from the best by date, it wasn't exactly very fresh, but it was still good. Definitely worth a try, especially if you like hoppier pale ales. 3.5s across the board."
"O- a great beer for a warm day or night. This would be an excellent summer session beer that I would definitely have regularly if easily available to me."
"The flavor is citrusy and floral, with a nice balance of sweet, grainy malts. This is a light bodied, well balanced beer that is moderately carbonated. The beer finishes dry and slightly bitter. Very drinkable, a nice beer for a hot summer day."
"O: Disappointed and will not try again."
"O: This is an easy drinking pale ale. Not too high in the hops, but it is rather dangerous as it is a good session beer. I've had hundreds of these and honestly this particular review is strange since it tastes a bit different than it usually does. I'll have to update this next time I crack open another."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a bright orange-gold coloring with no head. The beer almost glows in the glass. The nose is a muddled fruit sweetness, with a slight citrus note, also, but more cloying characteristics than anything. Slight hopping helps to balance everything. The beer is very sharp and crisp in mouth. Flavors are slightly smoked, but very tart and bitter citrus, also, with an overpowered hops presence. A little too lopsided for me. The aftertaste is very watery, with slight peppery-hops hints throughout. The finish is dry, but lingers a bit."
"Overall this is a beer I can certainly kick back and enjoy without having to think too much about it. Pretty good."
"This beer pours a hazy orange amber color with a finger of foamy white head that retains and laced well. The aroma has hints of bread/caramel malt and hops, but they were fairly weak. The taste starts malty sweet, with the typical hints of bread and caramel, and then finishes with some complex hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced and finishes clean. Overall a good pale ale."
"Overall: WOW Very drinkable. Very flavorful. This was a great beer for a lazy afternoon chillin & grillin poolside at the tiki bar. Wish I could get around here."
"Overall a great beer. I really like it. Wood definitely look for it if they distributed here."
"O- I thought this was a very easy drinking pale ale that gave a little extra to the flavor. The ABV is lighter which means you can drink this in the summertime while grilling...and we all love to grill!"
"D - Very good extra pale ale. I see a lot of the reviews here saying it was dull, don't believe them. This brew packs a ton of flavor."
"O: I liked this brew. Great summer drinking beer. Nothing really special about it, but still a decent brew."
"O: Overall this one is a winner in my book. I like it, and on a hot Atlanta day this beer is an excellent choice. Smooth and clean flavors that work well with each other. I will gladly take another!"
"O - Not bad, not impressive either.. pretty good. One of those beers I enjoy enough to drink and the gf likes em too"
"Overall, this is a very drinkable APA and I could easily lose track of how many I've had."
"Taste of more hops than what I got in the aroma. Citrus, grassy notes, sweet caramel malt in the middle and finishes with some light hoppy notes. Mouthfeel was heavier than expecting from an extra pale ale, but i'm not complaining. Overall, very drinkable and I enjoyed this APA and wish I could get this locally."
"Overall-I wish I had access to this beer because when in the mood for a creamy, smooth, refreshing brew this would be perfect. Didn't knock my socks off by any means but really enjoyed it."
"NOTE: This bottle had a best by date of 4/14/11, but due to circumstances I was not able to try it until now. I may try to get another bottle, and if my opinion changes I'll update my review."
"O: An excellent APA, a prime example of the style."
"O-One of my favorite beers of the style. Good paired with almost any food, flavorful but still refreshing."
"Taste is crisp and hoppy, a bit grassy like their IPA but obviously to much lesser extent. Mouthfeel is light and creamy with some sharp carbonation on the finish."
"Overall: much improved fresh and on tap than in the bottle that had travelled a ways to get to my glass. Its a decent pale ale that lingers somewhere between IPA and APA. It might be better served to make up its mind. Worth a try. Cheers!"
"April 11th 2012 EDIT- I got a fresher bottle that had a best buy date June 30th 2012. This is much better fresher, since the hops are more vibrant and haven't faded, but I did find the carbonation to a be a little fizzy so I am going to adjust the scores accordingly. I liked this beer, it's a really solid American Pale Ale."
"D: Very drinkable but somewhat lacking in interesting characteristics."
"Overall an outstanding session brew. One of my go-to beers in the summertime."
"D: Very drinkable. Flavorful, smooth and balanced."
"This is one of my go-to pale ales when I can't find anything else to drink. Nice looking pale. Perfect color for a XPA. The smell is nice and hoppy. The taste follows the smell. Citrus hop pale with and very nice finish. Good carbonation and mouthfeel. Overall, this is a standard to drink when there is nothing else exciting on tap. It's a well-done execution on a well=known beer style."
"A light, crisp pale ale. Not super hoppy, fairly sweet. Better as it warms."
"O - Mehhh at best."
"D - A classic. Very high drinkability. Tasty, and very smooth. Pour me another!"
"D- 4 Despite not being crazy good in any one area I feel I could drink several of these. It goes down easily and has a good enough aroma and taste. It is balanced. I'd imagine it would be even better fresh off the line or on draft. A refreshing, easy-to-drink brew that's worth a shot."
"Still, like I said, this is a damn fine standby."
"o: not too bad. I'd like to try more sweetwater, though for a pale ale (extra pale) this isn't too shabby. I don't need to seek this out again actively, though I could grab it at a bar once in a while if something else doesn't spark my interest."
"Beer is light to medium in body, easy drinking overall, mild hoppiness, mild bitterness, mild overall. It's a little sweet and a little dry at the end. Decent."
"Overall I got this as a single for around 3 bucks and as a single not worth it. As for local pales of better quality being around 32 a case (with tax) this beer will most likely not be purchased in the near future. Still a great beer overall that the locals can appreciate."
"The CPJ"
"A good x pale ale"
"O/D - Easy drinking, flavors are not overwhelming. ABV is very manageable. Somewhat filling."
"Very nice taste. A crowded style, but very drinkable. A hint of astringency takes away points but over all nice Pale. I could have another. Citrus comes through as to style. mellow malt character and subtle hops. Clean pour. It was lighter in body than expected, so that made it drinkable. Thanks to Flying Saucer Raleigh NC"
"Overall- Not a bad ale, just not true to its style. I finished this beer quickly, while most APA's in the past are Fuller Bodied and have more hop to them. I'm not going to bash this beer, but is sure isn't my favorite."
"It has a crisp front end and good carbonation."
"O: I don't ever see myself getting this again. It taste sort of ammature. The nose & flavor is weak and the mouthfeel is too watery. If it was a little more hop forward then maybe I would get it, but for now, I'll pass."
"I feel like maybe this would be better if it were fresh out the tank or just on tap. it needs something to it. its an average beer."
"On a recent trip to Atlanta, I thought I should try some of the local brew. I found Sweetwater to be quite easy to find around town with a good variety of beers, so I picked up a few 6-packs including this one. I think of all the Sweetwater brews I tried this was the best. It had a nice hoppy flavor with a well rounded, crisp finish. A nice fruity aroma also carried through in flavor. Overall this is a good local beer and if you find yourself near Atlanta I would get this one before others from this company."
"Opinion: This is an OK beer, but I don't really like the hop balance that much because it is quite bitter for the gravity and the grassy hops are too dominant. I have a bottle of their regular IPA, so I have higher hopes for that one since it is a little bigger. This hopping schedule may be OK for a ~7% beer, but it is a bit much for a 5.4% beer."
"Great name though."
"O: drinkable American pale ale. Wouldn't go out of my way to get it, but would order it again."
"D- Good beer, i will defiantly be getting this again."
"D - Super easy to drink. I'd grab this again if I could find it."
"Notes: This Pale Ale screams summer time cookouts and picnics."
"M= crisp; medium body and carbonation."
"D - Very delicious and for me a session beer as the ABV is low."
"D: This is a very easy drinking APA. Light enough to drink a few, yet satisfying if you only have time for one. I like this and would not hesitate to drink another one, although I probably won't stock it in my fridge."
"This was actually an old bottle, but it was still pretty good, I would like to try it fresh."
"D - this is a pretty good little APA. Nothing flashy, but very well crafted. I really enjoyed this beer. I finally got to try it after the couple times I have been down south and have passed it up."
"M&D- Honestly i could drink this beer all summer long. It would be a great brew for a nice hot day.Its light and goes down smooth. Quenches the thirst. I actually had this brew originally at Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival 2010. It was an amazing brew to have in the middle of hot June. It is not distributed here in Kansas so it would be a little hard to come by frequently. Overall Sweetwater Brewing has a great beer an the table."
"D: Sweetwater calculated this one perfectly: A cross between a pilsener and a hoppy IPA = something the masses will enjoy. I guess it's tough to argue with that!"
"D. Ok. Not a big fan."
"D-not bad, bit not the greatest"
"D - ehh...it's ok. Tastes ok and not too heavy. But it's not something I really truly enjoy."
"Pours a very clear light yellow. Lots of white head. Smells... hoppy and hempy?? A very unusual smell.. Reminds me of weed. Tastes very mellow and hoppy. Not really anything impressive. Good mouthfeel and solid drinkability but overall not an impressive beer just a solid IPA"
"Good beer."
"Overall, a solid APA here that I would drink again."
"All in all, don't worry about this one. It's decent, but not much above that at all. I need an Alpha King now."
"I have to say that I am a fan of this particular rendition of an APA. I can appreciate good balance and not going all out with the hop bitterness....so this is one I'd recommend, especially to those who aren't extreme hopheads."
"D: I can put a sixer of this back in no time, particularly on a hot summer afternoon. This is the beer that really got me started in the craft beer direction so I admit I'm slightly biased. However, if you're looking for a great tasting pale ale, this is your beer."
"This poured light orange and had one finger of head that didn't last. This was very refreshing and easy to drink. Hops and floral come out in the smell and taste. I noticed that it was a little more malty than other pale ales that I've testy, which is nice for a change. It relatively light bodied, making it easy to have several of these in a sitting without making yourself feel like a sausage."
"The mouth feel is light and has slightly higher carbonation which makes it a very refreshing beer. I could drink these all day; I can't think of a more sessionable ale."
"Sweetwater 420 Extra Pale Ale from Sweetwater Brewing Company pours light golden in my pint glass. Perfect carbonation is present. The smell is of citrus and malts. The taste is of hops, malt, and citrus. This beer won't slap you in the face with harshness. It's a pale ale and it does it's job well. Very high drinkability makes me come back for more. Leaves lacing in my glass. I like to think of this pale ale as a Sweetwater IPA Light."
"Pours a pretty light clear golden yellow color with a thick white head and a fair amount of lacing. Smells of piney hops, caramel malts, and a little citrus. Tastes of mild hop bitterness, caramel, yeast bread, and maybe some hints of orange. Mouthfeel is medium with a mild carbonation. Drinkability is high. I really like this one."
"D: The beer is easy to drink and is also quite refreshing. I could easily have a few of these in a sitting."
"D: Very drinkable but somewhat lacking in interesting characteristics."
"Drinkability- fairly refreshing."
"D- Overall, Sweetwater 420 is a solid pale ale that is worth a try."
"D- Refreshing summer beer. Easy to drink. Watery and average. Slightly over-carbonated."
"Nice bright golden color with decent head and retention throughout. Smells of pine, citrus, stale, grass, lemons. Tastes mainly of citrusy, bitter hops with a very light malt presence and a hint of alcohol with a slight sweetness after each sip. Carbonation is a bit extreme on this bottle, could be toned down a notch, slick, oily and fairly light mouthfeel as well. Overall, drinkability is about average, nothing really stood out to me in this beer."
"How is it that Sierra Nevada and Boulevard have 20+ year old pale ale recipes that completely outclass this offering from Sweetwater? 420 is not terrible beer, but it is boring. At least with some bad beers, you can say ""Well, they tried for something big and they happened to fail."" With 420, all one can say is ""they tried to play it as safe as possible and still failed."" Slightly below average beer, but still an embarrassment."
"D - Solid beer. Good everyday, sessionable pale ale. Perhaps a bit too much malty sweetness for the long haul (at least to my tastes), but definitely a beer that you can settle in with for an afternoon and have a few."
"Best before 1/11/10: pours a nice golden color with a thick and frothy white head that leaves impressive lacing. The aroma has grassy and citrusy hops upfront, along with biscuit, caramel, fruity esters, candied orange and some alcohol. The flavor has a piney and citrusy blast initially, along with some biscuit and caramel malt notes, orange peel, fruity esters and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is appropriately light, and drinkability is very good. This one is a pretty tasty (yet simple) APA when fresh, but thoroughly mediocre when the hops fade."
"OVERALL: No born on date, but it did have an expiration date of 12/26/10. Very unusual flavor that sets it apart and makes it unique. A great beer to enjoy if you're ever forced to be in the state of Georgia."
"I'm sure this beer would have been even better without the ice cold beer mug. Why do restaurants serve everything like it is Coors light?"
"d - A decent APA that goes down pretty easy. Not a lot stands out in the smell or taste, but not bad at all. Would try again and have no problem drinking the 3 that came to me, but wouldn't seek it out."
"D - Nice and drinkable, but not too complex and flavorful. A good grilling/lawnmower beer."
"Compared to, say, Mission St. Pale Ale, available locally for 5.99 (and sometimes less) a six pack at Trader Joe's... this pales (pun intended) by comparison."
"D-Goes down easily enough, it just doesn't entice me to have another."
"Pours a fairly clear golden color with a white head and a touch of lacing. The nose brings some pretty strong pine, floral, and citrus hops that work well together in tandem. The taste lays off a bit with some mild hop flavors and a bit of pale malt below. Light feel with good carbonation. This is an extremely drinkable pale ale with some nice characteristics all around."
"This ale pours a hazy-gold with a white head. There is not a real big aroma, mild hops with maltiness, hint of some citrus- lemon?. The taste is clean with a mild malt, and a bitter hoppiness kind of bready. Decent beer, worth trying it out and drinking a couple."
"D: This is very sessionable and refreshing."
"The head on this beer was not very impressive, about a finger of soap suds looking bubbles. The color rates a 6 on the SRM chart, impressive for a APA. Smell of lemon, lime, grapefruit, baked wheat, and spices. Well balanced flavor of citrus fruit, malt, and grains. Nice bite on my tongue and upper palate, sort of a velvet smooth feeling as it slides down my throat. This beer goes well with fish and fries, as well as with snacks. Good price, I will have some more of this in the future."
"Aftertaste has a nice sharp finish with some pine, citrus, and light fruity esters left on the palate. Splendid."
"A little disappointing but very quaffable in quantity and likeable in its own way."
"This one is light in body with fairly low carbonation for a pale ale and the finish is rather watery. This is an inoffensive example of a pale ale that I could drink all day if it was on hand, but it's certainly not what I would reach for if I wanted something interesting and exciting."
"My new go to APA and excited they come to Jax this week!"
"D: Very drinkable but somewhat lacking in interesting characteristics."
"Moderate hop aroma, little to no malt aroma. Pleasant floral aroma. Nice golden color, nice clear appearance. Thin, white lace around edge of glass. Mild carbonation. Balanced hop flavor, no malt flavor. Smooth, low dry finish, slightly sweet mouthfeel. Very drinkable beer, well balanced, but very tame for an extra ipa."
"Loved Sweetwater's IPA so I'm hoping this one will be just as good. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear golden sunrise color with a crackling, soapy white head. The nose is rather unremarkable but this may not be the beer's fault, it does have a best by date of 4-19-10 and its September now. Pale malts, a touch of fruitiness and just a hint of lightly toasted malt are all present. Tastes like it smells, rather unremarkable. The aforementioned smells are accurately translated into corresponding flavors with some hop bitterness for balance but not much flavor (again this is probably not the beer's fault). Mouthfeel is a full-medium bodied beer with a creamy carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Overall, a decently drinkable beer but not impressive. I would like to try this one again within its freshness range. If it is anything like their IPA I'm sure it's great."
"D - Not outstanding but enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Very citrusy hop flavors abound in this beer. It seems rather hoppy and unbalanced for an APA (I suppose this is the ""extra"" in the title). It has a certain sweetness to it that meshes really well with the hop character but doesn't really temper the hop flavors with a malty balance. Certainly an interesting take on the APA as well as a very crisp and sessionable beer. Certainly worth trying if you find yourself in the southern states that Sweetwater distributes to."
"Drinkability: wonderful beer for summertime sipping."
"D: This was the perfect companion for exploring the Savannah Historic District during July. Whenever you fell parched, you can walk into pretty much any bar and pick up a pint to go. It doesn't have quite as much character as SNPA to me, but it's still very good."
"A great example of the style."
"D: Very easy drinking! A bit hoppy for some, mayhap, but good overall."
"The citrus characteristics are prominant but not overwhelming.  This is a good pale ale selection APA."
"D - This is a good beer. I'm glad I finally found a 420 Extra Pale Ale."
"Really enjoyed this beer, quite possible will become my pale ale of choice when travelling in the South, where it seems to be widely available."
"420's the flagship and pretty representative of Sweetwater's approach to their market."
"Sweetwater seems to have brewed 420 with safety in mind. Safety in that the average person could easily handle the beer without being overwhelmed; nothing wrong with that, of course. Not bad, but 420 hasn't swayed me from their excellent IPA."
"D: Kind of a letdown, but maybe those were my expectations at work. I thought it would be a really solid pale ale like Terrapin's Rye PA, but this seems like a lager targeted toward the macro crowd. Skip."
"Notes: I slightly prefer this on-tap, but otherwise pretty even. I personally think that this beer deserves better numbers."
"D- Overall this a good pale ale. Positive recommendation."
"D: Very drinkable beer, all the flavors blend well and make for a great summer sipping beer."
"A nice beer, with a good long bitterness."
"Super easy drinking. This is a quality session beer. I just hope Tampa gets distrobution soon. I don't like having to drive."
"M Medium body, no warming on the aftertaste. "
""
"Very drinkable beer. We used to drink this stuff in college all the time. Go Dawgs! And it's nice to try it again. I'll have no trouble finishing this 6-pack and will stock up next time I head to the deep South."
"It's a decent pale ale but nothing surprising here but a nice drinkability."
"The 420 pale ale pours an orange color with good clarity and a nice pillowy white head and some retention. A nice malt backbone to the nose with very subtle hop characteristics. Citrus fruits are faint, but present. Taste is water downed and some hints of malts and pines. Smell is much more dominating than the quaff. Mouthfeel is watery and thin. Not the best pale ale out there. Not much complexity or taste to it."
"This has failed to impress me again. Stay away from it if it isn't fresh as it tends to skunk pretty easily. I must say their IPA is killer though."
"The flavor is a present but mellow hop profile which is a nice blend of the smell. Bitter herbal hops flow into a sweeter more citrus rind like taste towards the end of the profile. The malt really rounds out the flavor by creating a tasty, mild and sweet base. In the end this is a better APA than I remember it being and kind of makes me feel bad for always going for the AIPA, but o well, a well made and tasty brew. Mouth feel leaves me satisfied."
"very drinkable beer. I could session this beer on a hot summer evening. nice drink"
"Overall: I really liked it at first and then i kind of got bored with it. The taste is good but it is a quite average beer. Nothing bad really. Might have been a B if that harsh earthen finish would have been toned down."
"The beer pours a clear yellow-light orange color with a white head. The aroma is citrus and resiny hops. The flavor is grain and bready malts with lots of hop flavor including resiny and grassy hops. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - This is solid tasting, not bad, could session this without any problems at all."
"I've been running into alot of beers lately that I would prefer in really hot weather and this is one of them. Being it's late April, 'tis the season for these types of brews."
"This might not be the hoppiest or best APA, but it is still a solid beer and is very enjoyable. I think it would be a good beer to introduce a friend to the craft beer world. I would like to thank Sweetwater Brewing Company for having their 420 pint glass giveaway. I went to First Street Draught House to enjoy a pint and get my free glass and thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope to drink some more Sweetwater in the future."
"I could drink this all night long."
"Drinkability is still top-notch. Triple T's doesn't have the best beer selection in town, but I'm completely satisfied as long as they continue to have this on tap. I had a few the other night and never got tired of it at all. A very solid beer from Sweetwater, maybe the best they offer??? This is a mystery I'll have to get to the bottom of soon."
"D: This seems to be one of the quintessential beers in the south, and I can see why. Not my favorite pale ale, but a real easy drinker."
"D: The standard bearer for Southern craft brews has made a fan out of me. This isn't a go crazy hop bomb like many of the new pales are trying to be. Just good, classic American Pale Ale."
"Nice body, nice feel, this is a well balanced beer that is very drinkable. Not hop-forward like many APA's I drink, a good bridge beer for any BMC drinker I would say. Bring a sixpack the next time you are throwing some shoes with your buddies."
"The taste sticks giving it a decent mouthfeel. I'd have another."
"Medium bodied brew with a medium effervescence. Warming in the throat. Pretty good stuff but no standout."
"D- light and refreshing with a good amount of hops to satisfy my palette. a good late afternoon beer."
"I am not horribly disappointed but still, this seems to be a very average Extra Pale Ale. I'm questioning what's extra about it? This beer seems to be a little too malty and not balanced well in the hop factor. Not a horrible beer but still not what I expected. Good entry level Pale Ale."
"Very good ale!! I had it tonight on the wonderful saint pattys day at a bar. Appearance was nice with a foam that didn't go away through the whole the whole thing. Smell was great it smelled strong of hops. The taste was very good with a true taste of hops. The mouthfeel is great very expectable with a extra pale ale. It has a great drinkability that you will surely enjoy. Yet again the ATL Georgia is on the map. Well world I say try this beer!!!"
"The taste is reasonably complex. The beer begins on the cracked grain dryish side, with a nice bready mid section, fairly light bodied and carbonated. Somewhere along the way the sweeter malts emerge and the beer finishes up a bit saltene, herbal, maybe a touch of cracked graininess. The beer has some floral tones, and gives you some drying, salty notes with more sweet herbal malts. The beer has some complexity to it, it is interesting, and worthy of a try. The aftertaste lingers a bit longer than I normally like."
"Wonderfully drinkable and overall an excellent APA. A staple here in the South, and that's just fine by me."
"Clean, crisp medium body that is more hop forward than the nose leads on to. Well balanced with a decent amount of dry earthy pine hops that linger throughout over the slight tropical/citrus fruit notes and a sweet caramel/biscuit malt backbone into a dry finish."
"Drinkability: I really liked this beer. I would purchase it again no doubt."
"Taste was a bit more complex (but not complex by any means). Both some malt, bitterness, and hop flavor. A simple, fairly ordinary but drinkable APA."
"I got this as part of my BOTMC. It is light clear gold in color with a 2 finger white head. The aroma has sweet flowery citrus. The flavor folows the nose. It is pretty well balanced and has a nice, sweet finish. It is highly carbonated and is medium in body. A solid all around APA."
"Drinkability - Nicely not overfilling. Light, yet satisfying. Would have another."
"Overall, decent sessional but nothing I would actively search out again."
"Overall I think I like this beer better on-tap. The thickness isn't enough to support such low carbonation."
"D: Non-filling and good taste make this a decent beer to drink. However I would probably want something else after about my 2nd one."
"The BOMC description was on the mark and pointed out the pepper and citrus hop taste that leads to the sweet malty ending. A very drinkable beer that went down very easy. I recommend this beer."
"D - This is a beer I think would appeal to a lot of people and can be refreshing and quaffed with ease. Good session beer for sure."
"Brought this bottle back to Cincinnati after a long weekend in Gatlinburg. Poured a yellow clear enough that I can read BA through the side of the glass. Plenty of head that dissapates quickly without much lacing. The aroma is mainly sweet and malty with only a hint of hops. The moderately hopped taste is backed up with a sweet malty backbone that gives the beer a realtively thick body. Not very hoppy at all for being an APA, seems like it's more mellow taste would lend itself to being classofied as a different style. IMO there are many better Pale Ales in the world and a good bit of them are less expensive."
"Drinkability: Solid, actually. I could probably drink this all day during the warm and humid summer months as it doesn't weigh heavily on the stomach at all and the body is crisp and refreshing. I dont' think I'd necessarily go out of my way to get it, but if I came across it I may pick up a sixer here or there."
"Aroma 3, Appearance 3, Taste 3, Palate 3, Drinkability 3, Score 3/5"
"mouthfeel is on the lighter side and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, pretty easy drinking beer. It's light, not overpowering in any flavor and low on bitterness."
"D-light taste but goes down easily, not a whole lot of flavor but it isn't bad"
"Drinkability: A good sessionable pale ale that leaves a hoppy taste in my mouth. I could have four in a sitting. A solid beer."
"Note: I later tried this brew from the bottle and everything above stays mostly the same but the flavor and aroma were simply turned down a notch. It's amazing what a difference on-tap makes."
"Notes: My favorite session beer and I only can get it some of the time...such is the fate of a BA."
"Drinkability is pretty good, smooth but refreshing. Probably great for cotton mouth."
"If I was not on a mission of trying as many bars as possible I would have had another."
"I think If I had this at a beer bar with a better pour, it may be better. However, I did not and it did not impress me at all. I will try this again, I think the restaurant may have poorly represented this beer."
"Notes: I'd rather just have their IPA. That pretty much sums it up."
"D= A solid but not ""outstanding"" pale ale. Paired well with a plate of mildly spiced nachos."
"Complex, yet sessionable. This is one worth keeping your eyes peeled for."
"Not a bad beer but guess I'm hooked on the big beers. Nice food beer."
"drinkability: a nice beer and if they sold it in Jackaonville I would make it a regular session beer"
"I definitely like this one for a session beer."
"A pretty drinkable brew, and a good stepping stone to their excellent IPA."
"Pours a golden color with a finger thick white head. Pretty much lacing, but not great head retention. Nose is unsurprising - hops, citrus. Taste goes hand in hand with the nose. Hops, citrus, decent bitterness. Not overwhelmingly so, but definitely there. Probably borderline for a BMC drinker. Mouthfeel was medium, and I didn't pick up on the wateriness that I got from this brew in the bottle. Drinkability was good. All in all, an enjoyable experience - it won't go down as one of my favorites, but it's good enough to order at a restaurant if your alternatives are BMC."
"Mouthfeel was medium in density and carbonation."
"d- good drinkability, i could have a few of these easily, not a beer i would have tried, but i recieved as an extra in a trade, glad i had the chance to try this."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight earthy malt, hops (oil), and slight citrus. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight roasted malt, earthy malt, hops, and very slight water. Overall, a decent extra pale ale, but lack in good strong hop flavor."
"drinkability is good,only because it is so easy. i feel like this is an english pale ale,honestly. still good though."
"D- Decent. I could go for a session with this beer, I feel like its an IPA that a few of my ""bud light"" drinking friends could warm up to"
"A bright amber appearance with minimal head retention and lacing. Not much on the nose, a little bit of citrus hop aromas. The flavor is citrus, leaning a little more to the sweeter orange-like flavors. There seems to be a less-acidic fruit flavor in there somewhere that I can't quite peg. Maybe a raspberry or cranberry or apple or all three. It's pleasant at any rate. A light mouthfeel with not a whole lot of carbonation, kind of watery to be honest. I'd heard a great deal about this beer so I expected more. It's definitely a decent session beer. It's got some flavor, not too offensive, but just didn't wow me."
"D - Pretty damn high. I have to give it that. Blows ""the one with drinkability," Bud Light, out of the water, sort of like the hook does to that fish on the bottle label (well it doesn't really ""blow," but you know what I mean)."
"Overall its a little different than most APAs I've tried. It is an ""extra"" pale ale but it still seems pretty mild and tamable. Not an outstanding brew in this category, but nothing not worth sessioning can be found in a bottle of Sweetwater 420. I'd put it slightly above average, am easy to put down APA."
"It is a creamy brew with medium carbonation that could be a session beer. Not remarkable but enjoyable."
"Overall, another solid beer Ben sent me. I'm definitely starting to like this whole southern-east coast beer scene. Tasty things coming from that part of the country for sure!"
"M/D - An excellent pale ale, this would be a standby if I could regularly get it!"
"The taste is fairly grainy two-row malts. There is a nice creamy malt backbone, and a light hop kick on the end. A nice citrus lemon hop flavor. Not as balanced as some of the better extra pale ales I have had in my day. I like more hops, so this one kind of let me down. Still a decent offering from the boys dawn soth at Sweetwater."
"D: An extremely soild brew that exceeded my expectations, I can see how this would be a local favorite and staple. This was very refreshing and enjoyable, I would definitely try more Sweetwater if I see it again on a trip to Georgia. Give this brew a shot if you're bumming around the peach state, you won't be disappointed."
"D- Definitely, very good beer to enjoy on a hot day, refreshing, well balanced...very drinkable."
"This is a good beer, but not a great beer. It could use a little more malt, or a little more hops, a little more of both or just a little more of somthing. It lacks a strong flavor profile and isn't very complex. OK drinkability, a decent exampple of the style."
"D: Very drinkable. Not to heavy but still very flavorful."
"D- Nice flavor and balance. Easily sessionable."
"420 is the classic for me, cut my teeth on it when it comes to craft beer and it will always have a spot in the fridge, not the best from my hometown brewery but a damn good beer"
"Not outstanding but pretty good. in an airport full of macros, it's a welcome alternative. I won't go out of my way to find this but I'll definitely drink it when it's available."
"This is a solid, very drinkable pale ale. Doesn't stand out in any way but it's an easy drinker and a solid option when other options are few. I've had this on tap and in bottles while in Atlanta, and I have no complaints."
"Slight hops aroma, definately more pronounced in the taste. Balanced decent session beer. No alcohol presense detected. Good bitter finish. Decent beer, would drink more if available in VA."
"I have a friend who thinks sweetwater makes the best beer on earth and after hearing him go on and on about it i decided i would give this a try. i'm going to recommend him try sierra nevada pale ale. This is a decent beer, but for the style i feel like there are better choices. That said if you like american pale ales, this is worth checking out, maybe you'll like the flavors more than i did."
"Picked up a sixer the other day... Pours a crystal clear gold / light copper with a slightly off-white head that dissipates rather quickly. Aroma is of floral and light citrus hops. Taste... nothing really stands out - there is a light touch of hops, a little peppery, and a faint bit of maltiness - finish is pretty light with no real lasting flavors on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a little oiliness - again finish is pretty uneventful. Drinkability is up there - a good beer to have a few of. This is on tap at Charleston's minor league baseball park. I could definitely throw back a few of these at a game!"
"I enjoyed this. A subtle and enjoyable beer. Something I would recommend."
"Very drinkable and nicely balanced. I like this beer. It is not overbearing or out of control like some."
"This is my session beer. If I had to pick an everyday beer, this would be it. It pours with a nice off white head that thins out while leaving nice lace on the glass. The nose is not very overpowering, just a faint hint of citrus. The beer is straw gold with great clarity. The mouthfeel is medium with a balanced bitterness that doesn't overpower the malt. Finishes with a slight aftertaste. Very easy beer to drink and come back for seconds."
"Can't rate this one too high on drinkability with that aftertaste."
"It's a pretty good beer that is better because of it's drinkability. I had this outdoors when it was 85 and sunny and it was very refreshing. I could have easily had a few."
"I could drink a few of these, not bad at all."
"Drinkability was great---it was easy to drown in these. Had a lot of mass appeal, as even my girlfriend loves it."
"Went down real easy."
"Mouthfeel is light and easy to drink while still having enough oomph to make you know it's there. Goes down easy and is quite enjoyable and refreshing. Overall, a solid APA here that I would drink again. Wish it was distributed out here."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is sticky and carbonated. The body of the beer is light as is the finish. This beer doesn't showcase the APA very well. It is just and average typical beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Body feels light and watery. The beer is smooth, but low drinkability due to taste. This beer is less than stellar. It seems to be a big hit in Atlanta and other places in the southeast, but have yet to really figure out why. Overall, to date, I am very unimpressed with the brewery after trying 5 or so of there beers."
"Poured a cloudy apricot color with a minimal white head. It had a very fruity sweet apricot smell. The taste was sweet fruits and malts up front with a hint of mild hop bitterness. Had a clean mouthfeel and is a very drinkable brew. I was a bit disapointed in the end, expecting something a bit stronger, hoppier, or just different since it had the 420 tag on it. It has the makings of something special if only it had more of everything. I guess that is just the way they have decided to go, naming the beer after a weed reference and slacking off on the final product."
"Overall a good session beer for the spring time."
"Pretty good APA. Once you've had it a bit, it isn't fantastic enough to get exicted about but it always makes for a good choice."
"Poured a bit too cold into pint glass producing a nice creamy head that clings a bit to the glass and stays for quite some time. Nose is floral, light hops and grain. Taste is roughly the same though more grain and slightest bitterness on the finish. Quenching and not too high on the ABV to make this a sessionable/drinkable beer."
"HV"
"Definitely a beer that I could drink on for an afternoon in the sun."
"The alcohol smells are pretty strong during each drink...but all in all, this is a delightful brew...will buy again, and you should enjoy sweetwater's flagship beer...glad its in NC..."
"M/D: Light body, medium carbonation, rather smooth. Drinkability is decent. This beer isn't anything special, but you can tell the building blocks are there. I could drink a few of these at a time, but that doesn't means it's anything worth writing home about."
"Medium body. Appropriate carbonation. Very easy drinker."
"On draft on 4:20 day at the Saucer. Pours a murky golden color with a 1 finger head. Aroma consists of citrus, floral hops and malts. The taste is dominated by the malt profile but there are some risidual hop taste. This is a great light beer that can be enjoyed without having to think too hard."
"D= Great. A very well balanced beer that doesn't focus too much on either malt or hops. Well rounded and I will be more than happy to finish as many as I can."
"Pours a clear amber with 2 finger white head, ok retention, spotty lacing. Smell: like smelling a citrus tree, leafy with tangerine/orange, faint grapefruit and grassy noble hops. Taste: lightly bready, leafy, orange, tangy lemon, nectarine?, nice sweetness to balance the leafy and citric hops. The mouthfeel is ok, the carbonation level is nice but understated... otherwise it's a bit thin. There's a nice sweetness to go with a sensible hoppiness, but slightly more malt or carbonation would be nice. Tasty...but not their IPA!"
"D - Despite the flaws, 420 is fairly drinkable. It's blandness is also a testament to it's inoffensiveness making it easy to quaff. There's nothing exciting about this brew and there are better choices for the style. Much more impressed with Sweetwater's other offerings."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer, served in a standard Pint glass a nice crisp orange with a thin off-white head that leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight citrus hops and sweet malts. The taste is a decent balance of citrus hops and sweet pale malts, but a bit on the bland side, even for a Pale. The beer is crisp and very light, almost watery. I have to guess that the only reason this beer is popular is the marijuana reference in the name, because there are many better Pale Ales out there."
"M + D: Not a bad beer, but this particular one comes across like it may have been a little old. I don't suspect it is, but it had flavours like those I sometimes find with a 'slightly expired' brew. I rechecked, though, and it is labeled as being best before June 28, '09. Carbonation is decent, with an assertive sharpness and a lighter body to make for a refreshing feel. Slightly dry, adding a little more character to it. I'd try it again, but don't know what more I'd expect. Fairly accessible, if nothing else."
"Drinkability: OK APA. I've had this bottle for a few months, so maybe it's my fault it doesn't taste as good as it could. Would try again."
"Pours a clear, translucent amber in color with only a soapy ring of froth developing on the pour. Smell is malts and some old, still holding on hops. The best by date is still another 3 months away! Taste is old and not good for a supposed to still be good beer. Very thin on the mouthfeel and easy drinking. Not something I would revisit again."
"3.5/3.5/4/4/4"
"Drinkability: Definitely very high. Probably even nicer on a warm summer night."
"Sweetwater's 420 Extra Pale Ale is a fine pale that has a wonderful golden color with a sweet, flowery aroma. It presented a subtle hoppy sweetness and a smooth light mouthfeel. I really like this one and drink it on a regular occasion!"
"A very easy drinking, well done APA. The balance is great and the crisp finish leaves me wanting more."
"D: Easy drinker, a good mellow pale ale. I hope to find it again. Really tasty beer."
"I would take this over a Bud, Coors, even a Yuengling. But, not much over that."
"This is a really easy drinker. Very smooth, yet with enough crispness to not be watery in any way. Mellow flavoring. Light to medium hop bitterness. Not much there at all. All in all, I could see this becoming a great summer sessioner, whenever it arrives in bottles. Recommend."
"This is a good thirst quencher, and I'd like to try this on tap, if I ever make it south. I'd be interested to see if this bottle is somewhat skunked, or if it was just my imagination."
"Pours hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy off-white head, some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is mostly malty, not much hops, caramel. The taste is sweet, slightly bitter, malty, slightly hoppy. Medium body. Drinkable, I wish this would have been fresher."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable beer for Atlanta trips."
"On tap served in a pint glass. Light and thin head. Golden to light copper in color. Hoppy aroma. Very thin mouth feel. Taste of hops as soon as it hits the palate which gives way to a light (very light) malt character. Very drinkable beer. Light to mid levels of carbonation. Very good as a session beer due to the 5.4% AVB."
"One of only a few extra pales I've had, do like the style though."
"M/D: the feel is light almost watery and lacking bitterness from significant amounts of hops. The drinkabilility is good in that it is light and thirst quenching. A decent starting beer for the night."
"D - Clean, crisp flavor makes this a very sessionable beer."
"This beer is pretty much my standard beer if I'm going someplace with limited selection. Luckily, probably 95% of bars/restaurants in Atlanta sell this, so I can always get a great brew."
"I had this several times on recent trips to the Atlanta area. It is a crisp/clean APA with balanced hop smell and flavor. It is very drinkable and as sessionable a beer can get. It is not a ""must try", but it is widely available in the Atlanta area and a few steps above the macro beers beside it on the menu."
"Very drinkable brew. This has become my ""go to"" beer in most cases. Just a great tasting and easy to drink brew."
"Pretty good pale ale overall. Could easily be a session beer."
"420 Extra Pale Ale is an enjoyable beer. Yellow orange appearance, very nice flavor with a hint of fruit, but not overpowering. I was disappointed that there was not much of a head to this beer, but other than that it was a smooth and very drinkable pale ale. I have liked both beers (Georgia Brown Ale) that I have tried from Sweetwater, and hope to find more."
"An interesting extra pale ale that borders on the line of average to good. It has a unique taste that is a hoppy version of a macro lager."
"This is a good session brew, perfect for relaxing watching sports on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Thanks again khiasmus this was a nice change from all the big beers I have been drinking lately and a good one at that"
"Solid drinkable breer."
"D - Still a decent session beer"
"Poured a clean yellowish golden color. Decnet head with some mild lacing in th glass. I had it on tap at the Greenville airport in SC. Taste is grassy with a citrus hop note in the finish. Slight biscuit scent. Sweetness of a pale malt mixed with the slight bitterness of hops. Smell is rather sharp. Citrus tones mixed with the malt tones make for a nice nose. Very easy drinking and enjoyable. Certainly can have a few of these. Decent brew and it would be a winner if it made it up the coast. Easy session brew with a nice dry hop finish. I would certainly drink another."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and not very carbonated. Drinkability is good, but this one's not the greatest pale ale out there."
" results prevail."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, good representation of style, I could drink quite a few of these over the course of an evening."
"D - A nice, drinkable beer. Nothing extraordinary, the malt character is kind of muddy, but the hop character is nice, even if it is somewhat subdued."
"D: This is a fairly well done pale ale. While it didn't blow me away by any means, it was a well made beer."
"D - If this is Sweetwater's front man, I suggest they switch. It's not bad, but I've had better Sweetwater offerings. Average beer, average drinkability"
"I had this on tap at Vortex in Atlanta. The beer was light orange / rich yellow color, clear, with a thin white crown. The smell is light and citrusy, not strong with hops but there's some grapefruit. The taste is muted but sweet, crisp and inoffensive. Very easy drinking, a good pale ale but not exactly stand-out."
"overall, i really enjoyed this wish i could get it around here"
"Pours a clear golden amber with a small bubbly off-white head that recedes quickly to a ring and leaves little laving. The aroma is a balance of floral hops and caramel malts. There is also a definite grainy aroma in the smell as well. The taste follows the aroma with a heavy caramel malt backbone. The citrus and floral hops are present but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with lots of carbonation. This is an extremely sessionable beer that I've enjoyed for years and one that is a great fall-back beer in most bars in Atlanta."
"This is an excellent session beer. The malts and hops are in perfect balance, and the body is on the thin side. 420 starts with grapefruit hops and dry biscuit malts in the aroma. Both flavors carry over onto your palate with the addition of very lightly roasted caramel. Very clean flavor profile and of the self-proclaimed extra pale ales, this reminds me more of Steelhead's EPA than Summit's."
"better try this on tap again--maybe i was just in too good a mood..."
"This beer has potential but never gives up the goods completely. Lightly carbonated but not a clean crisp brew. The flavors and scents aren't well balanced. Despite its short comings this beer is ambiguous enough to go with most any dish."
"Sampled on tap via a busty bar girl (thank you!) at the Juke Joint in the Atlanta, GA airport. Poured off the tap a light amber with orange hues and a fizzy, eggshell-white head that faded quickly. No lacing to speak of. Aromas were also faint , floral hops and...? The flavors were more impressive, floral and citrus hops up front, then a semi-sweet malt flavor suggestive of fruit followed by a bitter hop finish. Surprisingly more complex than the weak aroma implied. Lively carbonation on the tongue and a smooth mouthfeel. Light to medium body and very drinkable. If only the appearance and aromas were improved this would be a great American Pale Ale."
"this is awesome, it smelled great and was a three sip and its gone beer, their was a nice malt and just the right amount of hop bitterness in the end, just a tuch to much carobanation but if this beer was avalable in new york i would always have this one in my fridge, i only had the one so i gess that i will be in serch of more of theese.` damm good beer"
"I tried this at Manuel's Tavern in ATL. Appearance is bright copper with a light beige head. Some lacing. Smell is OK, some bitter malts, yeast. The taste is good, citrusy & bitter with prevalent malts and very little on the hops. Mouthfeel is crisp. Overall a very drinkable beer. Easy to drink several on a hot day."
"This had a nice mix of flavor with the sweetness being the most prominent. I could go for some more hop flavor but overall a quality beer that I would drink again."
"This beer looks nice, even in the plastic cup from which I last drank it for this review. It pours a nice orangish golden color, with a rather slight head that manages to have a good retention and lacing (again, even in a plastic cup). The slightly hoppy floral aroma is pleasant, and the flavor is a classic pale ale with a lovely hop-bitter finish. Nicely carbonated; overall very drinkable and refreshing."
"Overall a very nice beer from Sweetwater, I look forward to trying some of their other offerings in the future."
"Generally this is what's available in most places that serve beer other than the usual. Although you're generally locked into this choice, you're still making a good choice. Refreshing and recommended."
"D: Drinks easy but i doubt i'd want another anytime soon"
"D - Pretty high, great with burgers and fries."
"Taste was very, very sweet...a bit cloying with an intermingling of hops with a very sweet finish"
"A light bodied Pale Ale with a nice crispness. A good summer beer and a pleasure to drink down here on vacation (Hilton Head)."
"Reminds me of a mix between a US and UK version of a pale ale."
"Nice regional beer that smells good, but is a little light feeling and not too special."
"It pours a light-bending caramel with bright gold highlights. No substantial head formed, but there was a decent lacing of white bubbles around the perimeter. Aromas of a floral character dominate the nose, while piney hops and a touch of sweet malt lurk in the background. The flavor is quite refreshing; the tongue first notices a mild sweet flavor of lightly roasted malts, which is soon followed by that familiar, bitter aftertaste of hops. It's medium-bodied with about the right amount of carbonation. It's a solid pale ale, but not extraordinary by any means."
"this was an easy to drink APA. i've been enjoying them this summer. too bad i'm about to run out for a coupe months until i can get more."
"The drinkability is good, not a brew I will seek out but nice clean good drinking. Prosit, MK"
"Pours a clear orangish amber with a light whitish head. Smell is more whole grain unmalted barley than anything, along with some mild hops. Interesting. Taste is unusual again with raw barley flavor and somewhat faint hop flavor and mild bitterness. Slightly fruity flavor, but very raw grain like. Not bad, just very unusual and unexpected. Somewhat full mouthfeel and slightly rich. Interesting beer."
"Extremely easy-drinking, but the flavor doesn't really stick, sip to sip. A pale ale ought to beckon you to drink it with gusto; this doesn't. But other than the weak aroma, there's nothing glaringly wrong with it--it's enjoyable enough, and I'll have no problem sitting with the other bottles in this 6-pack over time. Will I buy it again? Probably not, considering the much better offerings in this field."
"A west coast homage, and although they hit all the key points, there's not much else that they hit. There's pale malt, and there's west-coast hops, sure, but this isn't the best application of that combo I've seen. Not a bad beer, just very average."
"Aftertaste is fairly clean considering how much sugar I can taste...still leaves the mouth dry but with a reminder of the sweet orange and fruit characters."
"A nice beer, give it a try."
"I could drink these again if I found them but I wouldn't go out of my way."
"Drinkability is moderately high. Low alcohol makes beer sessionable, but flavor is uninspiring."
"D- Very high. Definitely a good session beer. Smooth, balanced, and refreshing."
"d: Thanks to cashew70 for this tasty extra."
"Limited review I typed into my cell phone while at Tim and Terry's in Gainesville, FL. I think the only place other than salty dog that they have it on tap here. Copper color with an off white tan head. A Good slighty toasted/bready malt flavor matched the bitterness of the hops. The hop flavor in this on tap brew was much better than the bottled version I remember trying because the hops were more floral, citrusy, and complex. From the bottle the hops seemed to provide only bitterness and lacked any floral or exotic flavor. Has the level of bitterness you would expect from an american pale ale. Decent."
"This is nice light refreshing extra pale ale. I had this in Atlanta , GA, at a bar in the Lowes' Hotel off of the airport, ""Martini's"". I had the first pour out of the draft. This beer had good look, but great drinkability. Smooth and tasty. They kept me coming back for the duration on my trip.."
"Thank you everetends for the bottle"
"D: Though the flavor isn't as robust or special as one would like, 420 is quite drinkable. It sits well in the stomach, goes down smooth, and has a dry enough finish to keep you coming back for more. Though I've had better (and more quaffable) APAs, this one is still solid and will make it into my rotation occasionally. The best Sweetwater offering I've had."
"pours a pale orange with a little white head. aroma is so faint. not impressed. light citrus hops. taste is citrus hops, mellow floral hops, light malt. light leaning a little medium bodied, low, crispy carbo. dry finish. great session pale. i dig it"
"Medium in body, crisp and smooth. Would have like a little less carbonation. Goes down easy with a nice hop bite. Stands up well to powerfully seasoned food. A solid APA - not spectacular but a good beer nonetheless."
"This beer definitely improves after it warms, but overall I find it to be fairly generic. Again, my taste buds may have been overworked by drinking the IPA beforehand, but I'm fairly confident I would have felt the same way if I had drank this first."
"Bready taste with a slight hop finish. Nothing too extreme.. Very drinkable!! This would be a regular in the fridge if I didn't have to drive a couple hours one way to get it. Very good.."
"D- Excellent. Especially when its the only micro available at an NASCAR-themed airport bar. Would make an great summer session."
"D: Definitely drinkable. We usually go through a couple pitchers between the three of us and no problems. Love this beer, but it has been a love of labor to open myself up to it."
"Drinkability - super stuff, a great session brew."
"This beer is hit or miss. I've had this on numerous occasions, and more often than not, it tastes like it's gone skunk even though it hasn't expired, according to the best by date. Pours a light amber color. Smell is pretty sweet with citrus overtones. Oddly, this is the Sweetwater flagship brew. Taste is pretty damn average. It's pretty watered down without alot of personality. Pretty drinkable though, due to the relatively low ABV."
"D: Nothing wrong with this beer and would be a great session beer due to its solid but not overwhelming flavor."
"Thanks to paulthebeerguru for the opportunity. Pours a light copper color with a good little head that settles to a nice layer, great carbonation. Smells of bready/biscuity malts mingled with a nice citrus/pine hoppiness. Light in the mouth. Hops on the tongue that tingles throughout, still very citrusy and piney. Discernable malt backbone. Finishes clean. A really good sessionable, hoppy APA."
"Is it five o'clock yet?"
"After experiencing the boldness of the Sweetwater's IPA, I expected this beer to be much more bold. I was refreshingly surprised by the smooth mellow taste to this beer. There wasn't too much of an after taste. It poured well with a copperish color. Since it was on-tap, by the time it was served there wasn't much head to be able to distinguish."
"Thanks to Maria for picking this up for me during her travels."
"D- Very easy beer that will not overwhem you."
"They aimed for west coast style and they did a good job at it."
"D: OK. That metallic flavor slowed me down, kept it from being quaffable."
"12 oz bottle: This one pours a fairly clear , amber color. There was some white head and lacing to it. The aroma is quite good. Mainly citrus hops, with a few floral notes tossed in there also. The taste is quite good. Just enough bitterness with a good malt body. Very smooth drinking. A very well balanced Pale Ale, and a fine example of the style."
"All in all an easy drinking ale, blanced and a good standby but lacks something to me. I will however drink it when available and it's also on tap at a number of local restaurants so I'd like to try it again as a draft. I feel it would pair well with food."
"Light amber, white head. Light toast aroma and similar flavor with a hint of added biscuit. Light to medium body with a faint hop balance. Drinkability is pretty high, and I do declare it must have been their intention. This here's a session beer, which is exactly what this devil did when he went down to Georgia."
"On-tap at the brewpub in Atlanta. Creamy soapy head on a light grapefruit colour. Hoppy and cramy maltiness, and good lace. Freshness.Suitable carbonation. I probably had it at the right place, and on-tap. Well malted bitterness makes it decent drinkable."
"Ingredients: Label calls out Pacific NW hops. Must have all gone in as dry-hopping."
"A very easy drinking brew that's careful not to offend, but is very drinkable. One of the more sessionable pale ales in this age of DIPAs."
"D - well when you are stuck in the Delta Crown Room and you have a choice of Bud, Molson, Coors, Miller Lite and Sweetwater 420, it is VERY drinkable...lol. But to be completely frank, it is average."
"D - I could drink a few of these and they're usually available for under $12 a 12 pack."
"D. This is a very good starter craft beer to introduce to the general beer crowd. I could drink them all day if it were a choice between this and Bud (They sell both at Wal-Mart in Atlanta). However if you are more than ankle deep into craft beer, try a Sweetwater IPA instead."
"Sweetwater 420 Extra Pale Ale pours a light copper color with a thin off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is floral hops, I was expecting something a little skunkier from the name. There is a strong hop flavor, once again primarily floral in nature with just a touch of bite. There is a good malt backbone. Fairly enjoyable. Worth a try."
"D - This is a pretty good beer overall its worth a try not as hoppy as I expected but still good"
"12 oz bottle. Pours a copper/gold with a 1 cm off white head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma is citrus mostly, but hints of hops and pine are present. Citrus initial taste with some maltness, aftertaste is hoppy. Light to medium body, almost no carbonation. Light and drinkable, standard beer when I'm in the south, but it doesn't beat out the high end hoppy beers."
"Hazy pale color. Thin head that leaves thin sticky lacing. Big hoppy nose with light pale malt smell. Very spicy hops taste with good pale malt. Nice hoppy finish that's dry. A good pale ale. I like sitting down with this brew after having a couple of strong brews."
"If I am in the South and want a local brew. I would drink this for the night."
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass. I feel like I say this in every post, but I love a crystal clear beer. This one has a amber body with a slightly reddish hue. The head fell almost instantly. Aroma is pretty malty with a bunch of caramel and a slight hop presence. The flavor matches the aroma nicely. Good and caramely with only a slight citrusy hop presence. This beer might be a bit older than I thought because the hops aren't as strong as I thought they would be. Medium bodied with decent drinkability."
"Nothing offensive to report here but it's just not very exciting either. Still a pretty quaffable, if simple, take on an APA."
"Just not much going on here. Lightly sweet cereal grain and toffee malts with light fruit aromas. Mouth is light....well I would have to say this is just too light. A very boring beer."
"Pours a clean pale orange-ish color with an off white head. Aromas of sweet malt and a hint of hops. In the taste, mellow sweet malt and just a hint of hops. A smooth, very small bitter mouthfeel and a sweet to small dry aftertaste. Light and refreshing, small amount of hops, but all round a easy-drinking, good beer."
"D: I certainly wouldn't turn one down, but it doesn't push any boundaries for me."
"This is one of my favorite new beers and a fine APA. I enjoyed this beer while on vacation in Florida and am saddened that I won't find it here in the midwest."
"Very nice...a great session beer. Too bad its not available in the Triangle (yet)."
"Tasty GA brew, Id have more in a heartbeat."
"Had this on draft at Emerald Coast Brew Fest in Pensacola, FL and also in bottle prior to the event. Poured a nice orange-gold with decent head that didnt last very long. Aroma and flavor is hoppy. Has a bit of citrusy taste with a crisp finish. Mouthfeel is good as is the drinkability. Good beer."
"A decent pale ale. Pours out clear orange/gold with lots of bubbles and an OK fluffy head. Nose is nice hops with spice and a bit of malts. Taste is mild, but hoppy and yeasty with a bit of alcohol. Lingering sticky west coast hops on the end. Hint of biscuit. Mouthfeel is average, drinkability is slightly above that."
"Drinkability - I really hadn't intended to review this beer, but I was caught off-guard by having beer available in what amounted to a food court! That being said, I think with would be an excellent thirst-quenching beer for a post-lawnmower weekend event."
"D - This was a very good beer and I could see sitting down and having several on an evening out. This went well with the appetizers we had selected and complitmented the food. The beer was surely fresh and tasted wonderful"
"Pours a fairly clear orange color with a good 1/2 inch of eggshell head, spotty lacing. Smells of citrus, floral hops, oranges, and some malt. Taste is floral and grassy hops, oranges, and a biscuity finish, not bitter at all. Medium/light in body with good carbonation and a sweet finish. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
"Overall, seems like a good representation of the style. I was impressed by the freshness, so I'm leaning towards buying an average brew that hasn't had to take a long trip over a great one that has had to come halfway around the world! Support your local breweries!"
"First thing I noticed was a citrus like taste, which is a perfect taste in the heat. It is crisp and has a good feel. You can taste the hops and it does have a good flavor for an American ale. If you prefer a heavy taste you may want to choose another option. I would say that considering it is a southern brewed beer, it is perfect for the lazy summers in the heat."
"Drinkability- This was a nice beer. I enjoyed it. Too bad we can't get this brand in Louisiana. I picked this one up on a trip to Florida."
"If you're in Asheville, NC, this beer is everywhere, and it's not a bad choice, but there are too many more interesting choices out there for me."
"A standard a fairly high-quality APA. Hops-a-plenty."
"On-tap it pours a beautiful honey-golden color with a thin but persistent head. Aroma is not strong but is malty and inviting, with a hint of citrus. Flavor is nice and malty, with fruity tones and no bitterness. This is not a complex ale, but a pleasing and laid-back one good for sipping on a hot summer day, or as an accompaniment to lunch."
"I bought this on a trip to Chattanooga and it was dated best before august, 2007. It had a very clean golden yellow color with a flimsy white head. The head was seriously pathetic and makes me wonder if it wasnt the glass that was the problem. The smell was lemony and reminded me of iced tea. It is uncanny how much this smells like iced tea, different than most pale ales. The taste is a little herbal hops up front with a macro lager-like finish. There are some bready malts hanging around but the lemony, herbal hops are front and center. The mouthfeel is sort of thick and full. Carbonation seems just right. This would be a very good barbeque/picnic/keg party beer and I would probably purchase this if it were available in Denver."
"Drinkability: as usual a fresh beer makes a happy customer. This was easy to quaff and a few can be had in a session especially with the lower alcohol content."
"Drinkability: Great tasting beer. Proud to have this in the Southern micro-brew arena. Easy-drinking that makes for a great session beer. And, I'll get to recycle the bottles for my homebrew. Cheers,"
"Taste is underwhelming. Some hops pull through, but weakly so. All fruit from the aroma is lost, whilst a metallic tinge underlies the flavor. A decent carbonation level and a light body fill out the mouthfeel, as a detectable bitterness finishes on the back of the palate. Overall, this beer is too simple and just not tasty. It drinks easily, but is definately undeserving of the ""420"" label or the $8.99 per six pack price tag. I definitely will not buy this again."
"D: Regardless, I can see myself drinking a few of these over the course of a hot summer afternoon. I won't seek this one out again, but I'll never complain if it's on hand."
"D-this one is alright. When faced with other options I would not choose this. However this is better than macro swill. A typical american take on the pale ale and not as good as the seminal pale ale Sierra Nevada."
"d - very refreshing and a nice summer sipper."
"Feels thin and slick. I guess it's drinkable after a hot lawn mowing expedition."
"Relatively tasty but not as good as Summit or the best Pale Ale in Minnesota...Itasca Pale Ale at Rock Bottom"
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, good representation of style, I could drink quite a few of these over the course of an evening."
"DRINKABILITY- Very. You might even use this beer to try others of the same style, as this one will not scorch your palate."
"Drinkability: A good session beer, I wish this was distributed in Florida, I'd make it a regular."
"This beer pours out a light golden color with a 3 finger head that disappeared a little to quickly. The aroma after pour was great, very hoppy with a citrus tang. While the taste was not very complex with the extreme hops I enjoyed it, not my first choice in a pale ale but a very good one."
"D: Unimpressive. Perhaps a good BBQ or lawnmower beer, but that's it."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a decent head that quickly fell. The smell is of fresh hops  quite inviting. The taste is bitter from hops and slightly sour. The mouthfeel is full and matches the beer nicely. I think this is a very nice beer and would consider it quite drinkable."
"D: Well, it's a very easy to drink beer, and would be great for BBQs, tailgating, etc. I wouldn't sit around & session with it though when there are so many other better beers available. Decent for what it is though."
"Pours a pretty weak orange colour, consistent all the way through and glowing clear body. Not much head, mostly bubbles that part along the outside. Good head would assemble on swirl and stay. A bready green aroma, hop bouquet. Not my favourite, actually a little too bready. Hops comes through much more clean in the mouthfeel. They don't seem to lend much bitterness but do impart a nice bit of flavour. A little too green. Light malt, not quite crisp or present enough. As good as many run of the mill American pale ales, but not to be placed with the better known names. Thanks Harry!"
"this is decent. Some citrus up front followed by alot of earthy sweetness...a little too grassy and dry late....even for the style. Nice sweetness and light on the mouthfeel...very drinkable until the next morning if you know what I mean.. .5""head left after about a minute....sweeter than most pale ale's...and fruitier....but lacks the hops and the bite to make it a serious craft contender. Just a little backwards....I want my Pale's taste to linger for a while.... needs more hops and a little more bite! Like Hummer it is a little oversweet and watered down for its' style. However, this is MUCH preferred over hummer."
"Pours to produce a light tan head, but doesn't stick around too long. Gives off aromas of bitter spicyness, but balances out quite nicely. The taste is also well balanced. There is a good hop presence, which has a unique bite to the tip of my tounge. There seems to be a slight spruce characteristic too. Feels kind of dry and course at first, but within seconds my palate is refreshed."
"Poured a crystal clear pale amber with a white head that cleared quickly leaving just a tad of lace. Smell was slight earthy, grass malts, with a hop hint. The taste was light and highly carbonated, but this is to be expected from an Extra Pale. This would make a good summer beer as it essentially goes down like water. No realy over bearing flavor profile anywhere, overall will give it another shot when its warm out."
"12oz brown bottle with a experation date of 12/31/06. Pours a deep gold with slight amber hues. has omly a one finger head, OK longevity and OK lace. Lots of caramel malt smells mixed with a hoppy citrus aroma. Again lots of caramel malt up front followed by a citrus hop flavor - mainly grapefruit - and a subdued hop bitterness. Spritzy and well balanced as Pale Ales go. Easy drinking. A decent Pale Ale."
"I loved this beer. It was the only of their line that I was yet to try. I was highly impressed with all of their others as well. The only one I liked better was the Blue. But this beer was a slight amber color. It had a very crisp hop flavor, which I loved. The smell was a very hoppy with some slight citrus in there."
"23 ounce draft at Mellow Mushroom in Boone."
"Bottle courtesy of Mr_Kimchee: Poured a deep amber color ale with a medium slightly off-white foamy head with average retention. Aroma of hops is well balance with some caramel malt. Taste of caramel malt with a slightly bitter and citrus finish. Well done for the style but nothing extraordinary either."
"Thanks to SilentSabre for sending me a few of these (had two, traded other with a friend.)"
"Another pretty good beer from Sweetwater. Enjoyed durring a recent visit to Nashville. Begins with a promising display of pale straw and modest copper coloring, withstanding head retention and adequate co2 with lacing later. Smells typical of pale ales with distinguishable citrus crispness and lightened malt character. Tastes similar to most good pale ales, but with lighter malt additions without becomming thin or grainy. Citrus dominant in the nose and flavors with an efforvescent livelyness. Nicely bittered with American hops and beefed up with a light biscuity flavor and texture. Feels light and airy with a co2 prickle. Finishes very clean and crisp with a light lemony zest in the end."
"D - pretty good beer. Wasn't sure what it was when I ordered it but wasw pleasantly surprised."
"Sampled in a half pint at the Knoxville Brewer's Jam. This is a very tasty pale ale that blends flavor and drinkability. A: Light to medium golden color with good head and carb. S: Hoppiness abounds in the nose with crisp clean smell that mimics the taste. T: Very much like the aroma, but milder than anticipated with hops balanced by just enough malted grain. M: Good, smooth with just enough viscosity to coat the palate and allow the flavors to linger. D: Very drinkable as I returned several times for refills at the Sweetwater tent. Hope to see this in the local market soon."
"Middle of the road take on the style with some nice flavor enhancements, this went down like mothers milk on a warm summers day! Liked this better than the bottled version"
"Body is just below medium, with a crisp texture and smooth mouthfeel. A very drinkable ale. It's always 4:20 where I'm from."
"Overall a great beer! I think i could have this over and over agian and never get tired! I love the hop characteristic and i think the mouthfeel being so creamy and full is top-notch! I love this beer!"
"This is by far one of my favorite beers, and its hard not to be biased. But it is nice to have some great microbrews in the Atlanta area, and Sweetwater's Beer Tour is one of the most fun local beer events I have ever been to. This beer is great to drink, and I will have a lot more."
"Thanks to potsie for the bopple!!"
"Sweetwater's 420 Extra Pale Ale pours a hazy orange-amber body with golden highlights beneath a frothy 3/4"" head of off-white foam. The head holds well and eventually drops but leaves a complete surface covering and some nice lace about the glass. Very nice.The aroma offers bright, fresh, floral & citrusy hops over a sweet, doughy maltiness. The body is medium with a delicate, fine, natural carbonation. The flavor delivers a combination of lightly tangy, citrusy and floral hop flavors and a bready, caramel & biscuit maltiness backed by a firm bitterness. It finishes dry with a short lingering hoppy bitterness and a residual bready/biscuity maltiness. Very well balanced. Nicely malty and hoppy. Highly drinkable."
"Very vibrant effervescant look. Lots of bubbles, good lacing. Solid two-finger head and a stout foam throughout the entire 12 ounces. Great amber hue to accompany all the other fireworks. Bitter bread aroma greets the nose. More hops than the more traditional English pale ale. A slightly above bar tase. Good resiny hops. Give the bready flavors a more specific rye tone. A tit bitter, American bitter I should say. Went well with my spicy jerk shrimp."
"Not a bad APA, but not one that i would seek out regularly."
"This beer had medium gold appearance with a half inch head that left some sticky lacing behind. Aroma was malty, fruity and quite hoppy. Taste was a good balance between sweet, sugary malts and piney, grapefruity hop flavors. The finish had a nice mouth puckering bitterness. The beer had a medium body and was quite refreshing on a hot afternoon. Not a bad beer at all considering my other choices were Bud, Miller and Rolling Rock."
"Pours a rich medium gold color with a thin white head, sans much retention or lacing. Nose is slightly sweet, with lots of malt aromas together with decent hop notes. Slightly floral. Palate is likewise -- malty with good hop backup. A light/medium body and a slightly hoppy finish. A good APA, really. This isn't one of my favorite styles, but for what it is I enjoy it. Worth a shot, especially if you're into the APA-style beers."
"D - very, very light and delicately flavored pale ale. Highly, highly drinkable with a couple of slices of pizza on a warm evening. Could use a little more ""oomph," but a light, tasty treat."
"Overall, I found this to be a solid pale ale. I liked the citric undertones and dryness of the taste. I drank quite a few of these both from the tap and from the bottle and really enjoyed them."
"This one was really easy to drink with some prominent flavors that werent to aggressive."
"Pours to an nice yellowish orange color with a white head that dissipates quickly...but nice lacing that stays on long. Fruity, hoppy aroma of bananas and citrus. Taste is slightly bitter, but has a good mouthfeel and finish. Would be good for the golf course, beach or other activities calling for several beers."
""
"D: Not a bad beer. Certainly drinkable but nothing mind blowing about this one."
"Overall: A good but unremarkable APA worth a try."
"I had this on vacation in Georgia a few years ago. My parents just brought back a six pack from there last trip that I couldn't go with. Pours a nice deep golden with a nice white head that laces some. Smells nice like like 60 minute I just had, citrus and grapefruit with a sweet soft malt balance. Nice flavor the bitterness is just deep enough but not overwhelming the sweet malts drive it through to the bloom of hops, citrus and pith nice and juicy IPA. Good stuff here I would drink it with a mouse, I would drink it in house."
"Courtesy of Bonhoeffer and the Brews 'n' Tunes BIF. Poured into a matching 420 Weizen glass, also courtesy of Bonhoeffer. Color is a nice golden honey with a white head. Head was about a finger width leaving some lacing. The Smell is very pleasant and just a bit sweet. I can smell the aromatic hops, it's like honey with a bit of lemon. The taste was like honey, but not cloying. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly syrupy. Balanced carbonation. This is a pretty well balanced beer, and I wouldnt mind having more."
"Great Beer. Period."
"This beer poured a golden color with a nice white head that dissipates with little lacing and eventually leaves no film. The smell is a nice citrusy hop aroma with some well balanced biscuity malts. The taste is quite similar to the aroma with the hops hitting you first and the malts coming later. It has a good mouthfeel, could be a tad thicker. Overall highly drinkable good regional pale ale."
"Mouth: Not nearly as sweet as it smells (it's not juice, afterall). Actualy, the beer is kind of sour with citrus overtones and a strong, bitter swallow that mellows out upon exhaling and pleasantly lasts for minutes in the back of the mouth."
"floral hops in the taste as well, with a slight balancing malt sweetness. fairly light mouthfeel, and very drinkable. comes off as a decent ipa with some caramel malt backing."
"Drinkability was distinctly average, not offensive just mundane."
"This could be a decent session beer, though I can't belive the 5.4% ABV. Seems like it should be lower."
"D - Very good drinkability. Thirst quenching. Would be an excellent choice for a session."
"I think I'd prefer a slightly dryer, more bitter pale ale, but this is nonetheless a well done beer and worth a pint or two."
"Beer pours a golden orange that has a well sustained white head. Nose is of malts and floral hops. Taste is nice balance between the malts and the floral hops. Mouthfeel is creamy, full, and well carbonated for the style. Overall drinkabilty is good. This is a well crafted pale that is worth a try."
"Beer was served in a pint mason jar. The beer had a small head and was typically colored for a pale ale. There was a slightly higher hop smell than usual. The taste was fairly bitter. There was a good bit of bitterness left in the aftertaste. The drinkability is good but this is not my favorite of the style. An average beer."
"Da fine EPA, but not as bold as some others, which is hitting me very well right now. I wish I had more than the three that came in the pack. A great session brew. Note: yes, a little bit of sentimentalness in the review, but who cares? Its my opinion, right?"
"Ugh."
"Aroma carries floral, orange blossom laden hops that are only slightly piney. Almost nutty caramel malt aromas as well. Color is an orange/yellow an the large head diminshes slowly. Fore is fruity and fat with bready/sweet malts. Finish is slightly hoppy, but mostly smooth malts. Very tasty brew."
"Poured a yellow-orange color with modest white head. Smekll is strong on hops, with strong notes of pine, grasses, and citrus. Taste has much less of a malt presence, with the hops being very restrained and malt being more in the foreground. Even though the hops were not very strong, the taste was very pleasing. Finish is more malty sweetness, with a light underlying hop dryness. A very pleasant drinking beer that was different from other beers in this glass."
"Pretty good Pale Ale from Sweetwater. I have had two of their brews and have liked them both. Kudos to the Beer of the Month Club!"
"Tried from a bottle at Chops in Atlanta. The beer was served in a large wine glass which really changed the aroma and appearance from my last review. The smell was of a really citrusy floral hops. The appearance was a great brownish orange color with a white larger bubbled head that laced for about the first half of the beer. The taste was also improved becaus of the improved aroma. Highly recomend trying in this manner. Also was great with the prime rib and horseradish sauce that I ordered."
"Overall, this is a winner. The hoppiness gives you the APA flavor you crave, but the balance will keep it going strong for as many as you care to consume. For those who like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, give this one a shot. They are similar yet unique beers, and they both have alot going for them."
"Perfect with pizza and friends."
"Overall: Not a mind-boggling pale ale, but a very good local brew that one should try when in Georgia."
"An OK brew for the closet hophead. Not that bad a beer but it is on the verge of harsh on the bitterness level for the style. If I was the brewer I would cut the boil time in half and dry hop this more. Worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is really a bit thin for a good pale ale, but works for what I generally pick this beer up for. As noted in the appearance, lots of carbonation. It finishes fairly clean, but has some lingering bitterness. Overall a really drinkable beer, not so much due to the flavor, but because of how light it is, while still being a decent beer."
"A nice, drinkable APA. Easily sessionable."
"This is definitely an example of a beer that tastes better than it looks. i know I've had the 420 in my past at one point, but apparently never reviewed it. Pours a nice head, but I see really no carbonation. Light golden color. Not really hoppy for a Pale Ale but well balanced nonetheless. Easy to drink, a nice starter for this style for those not as familiar. Could be a session beer, especially in the summer."
"This beer is a slight copperish color with tints of light orange. It has good carbonation and is pretty clear. The smell is light malt, nice fruity hops, and yeast. The flavor is a touch metallic which quickly fades to a nice bitterness. There is no lack of body and this beer is dangerously drinkable. There is no trace of alcohol in the taste yet it's listed at 5.4%. Very good overall APA."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. The only Pale Ale I really find myself yearning for. I only wish someone in Huntsville would carry it."
"This would be a fantastic brew to drink down after a hard day's work. Looks like Alabama's got something going for it in this brew."
"D: Very nice session beer."
"Comments  I liked this better in the bottle than I did when I had it on-tap in Atlanta last year. A big heartfelt thanks to UncleFlip for including this in the WTF BIF."
"Thanks, anyways, to rajendra82 for the bottle"
"Drinkability: Highly quaffable. A really enjoyable pale ale. I think this would be a good crossover beer for most. Recommended."
"It pours very well to a golden/honey color. When fully poured there is a moderate head which dies down to a continuous lite head. There is a sweet aroma with a hint of a hops behind it. The taste is nearly the same. A pleasant taste is left behind. Not too bitter. This is the best Pale Ale out there."
"Bottle provided by UncleFlip, thanks for the opportunity! Freshness marks are month 9 and week 5. Pours a half finger quickly settled head over a crystal clear light gold orange liquid. Smells piney, oranges, pine sol, and grapefruit pith (which is gentle). Tastes hoppy floral. Mild hop bitter that's nearly clean...some co-humulone. Malt sweet is buried under the hops. Hops border on pine sol favored. Definitely pine, some orange, and mild grapfruit pith. Carbonation is a bit too much, the acrid on my tongue augments the hops, so I will swirl to release some carbonation. Now it's sour tang with sweet malt and unpleasant bitter. Not good. I know some people like this pine sol hop flavor, but I find it unpleasant. Sorry for the low marks, but I gotta go with my preferences. Md-light body and over carbonated."
"This is a pleasant, easy-to-drink beer. Non-descript but satisfying."
" Overall a very drinkable brew for its crispness as well as its smoothness. A good brew with a spiced food or on its own on a hot summers day. Worth the Atlanta seek, worth a try."
"A solid APA...big thanks to Ding for this one."
"It's body is so light as to be nearly breakable, but as a pool/beachside/summer quaffer, this fill in nicely. A hop-forward American mild ale. Very decent."
"Crispy in the mouth. Persistent bitterness surrounded by a crisp grassy malt. Straightforward beer, that's about all it's got. Tasty though. Crisp mouth and refreshing. A decent pale ale."
"Notes: This is a simple and rather tasty all around beer. A brew for any season. Cheers!"
"Pours a golden color with a slight head that lasts the whole way down. Slightly grassy aroma-somewhat citrusy. Low hop bitterness with a touch of malt sweetness. Nicely balanced. Good mouthfeel. Very smooth with a pleasant ""silkiness"". A very enjoyable beer. One of the better APAs I have had. Would definately get this again."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: this is a good session beer, i try to pick up everytime i make it to see family in asheville. would be probably a popular bar choice for me if they'd distribute in the triangle"
"Had this ale at the Charlotte Street Grill in Asheville NC. Deep gold color with a snow white head. Hoppy flavor with a substantial body for balance. Long bitter aftertaste. Above average pale ale and this went very well with food. Wish I could find this in Tennessee."
"Cheers to Southernbrew!"
"Gold to Amber, this pale ale is definitely sweet. The head is thin, but leaves an impressive lacing on the glass. The nose is hoppy and malty. Taste is quite sweet, altough there is definitely a hop character. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Drinkability is good with a fairly low alcohol. This one is pretty good for a pale ale."
"All in all, the guys that make it are awesome, and while there are probably bolder APAs on the market, 420 will always be a personal favorite."
"Sweetwater 420 Extra Pale Ale is an okay version that fails to impress in any one area, but still manages to be drinkable. A heavier hand with the ingredients would have resulted in a better beer. If I lived in Georgia, I'd probably stick with Sweetwater IPA. Bottle courtesy of au1sec."
"Gold in hue with some tawny influences, the color is lighter than most APAs but that is not an issue. The liquid is largely clear with speckles of suspended yeast sediment. White head, about two fingers in height at its apex. Head retention was good; it faded quickly to a half finger cap. I was impressed that a cap of this size had such good staying power, a small cap lasted the entire consumption. Subsequent lacing was spotty and it clung poorly. Overall, the appearance is good. The nose is softly malty with hints of spicy hops. Bready throughout with a good yeasty aura, it has that fresh baked scent. The potency is low though. Clean. The nose is interesting, in the sense that this Pale Ale fails to be hoppy. Hell, it fails to say much of anything. The bouquet is not inviting because there is nothing there! What a bummer. The palate is much improved over the nose. I can taste the hops! Yeah! Now, dont fool yourself the hoppy influences are minimal but they are, at least, perceptible. Hops do offer some grassy-spice, some citrus, and some wood. Malt is soft and kind of bready, dry at times like a cracker. Orange zest, flowers, and some distant peaches can be found at the back. Modestly yeasty. The palate is very average but friendly, it reminds me of Boulevard Pale Ale (420 is not as bitter or as citrusy). The aftertaste is malty and dry with just a flash of hops. The palate is good. Medium in body, low but natural carbonation helps produce a pleasant, creamy mouthfeel that works well with this beer. Nice mouthfeel. This beer is plenty drinkable but it is nothing special. I am sure if this beer were a local Id quaff this Pale Ale with burgers or on a poker night. Its a solid beer but forgettable. Thanks to au1sec for the bottle."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with minimal white head which rapidly dissolves into thin lace. Smells of slightly sweet malts and citrus hops. Flavor is all citrus hops, with a little bit of malt sweetness and a subdues hop bite. Medium-light body with moderate carbonation. This is a thoroughly average pale ale. Nothing distinct or extra about it. Quite the mediocre Sierra Nevada Pale Ale imitation IMHO."
"Pours a golden color very light amber hints with a white head that fall to half inch cap that lasts. Aroma is overly sweet with floral earthy hops dominating with some orangey citrus in the background. Taste is like aroma sweet malt, almost syrupy like, then floral hops take over leaving light bitterness that lingers on the tounge. Nice clean after taste nice mouthfeel just to sweet. Drinkability in the bottle form just plain average. I have had this on tap several times any always enjoyed it do not understand why the bottle version seems so different. Meant to actually review this on draft today but the Mellow Mushroom in Blowing Rock was out and I had to have Cottonwoods Pumpkin on draft instead but thats a good thing. Thought I would by a sixer and review them I don't really see why it is so diffrent heck on draft it is even more amber in color then golden. If you can have it on draft try it, if not I would pass."
"Acquired via trade. This beer is a dark gold color with a very thin off-white head. Thin and quick lacing. The aroma has a decent amount of hops, along with some malt and spice. Medium-bodied and crisp with a moderate hops presence, along with a touch of sweet malt. The finish is lightly bitter. This is a straightforward APA that I would try again."
"I have seen a staggering amount of this stuff sell and was curious as to why in bloody hell this stuff is so popular. Well, why it is so popular is an absolute mystery to me. I tried it tonight and thought it was very close to being total crap. It poured an orange copper colour with a white fluffy head. Decent head retention with sticky lacing. The smell was extremely hoppy. Floral hoppy. Like a nice, cool pint of aftershave. The taste only amplified this. Is this taste and aroma what people really want? Apparently so, because a lot of places have a hard time keeping it on the shelves. ""Perhaps this just isn't for me", is the most polite, non-offensive thing I can muster to say about this stuff. I finished it, but certainly didn't ask for another. The one positive thing I have to say about it, was that it was quite smooth. The taste and smell, however, were way too hoppy for me."
"Dry and crisp in the finish, leaving the quaffer just ready to have another go around."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" of white head over the straw/light amber brew. Resilient head, with reasonable amounts of lacing. Aroma is pale malts and slightly citrusy hops. Taste is follows the nose, with the citrus even more pronounced, adding a nice crisp bite. Mouthfeel is good and smooth, and drinkabilty is excellent. A hot summer day would be where this brew would excel..."
"Pours a light hazy amber with a thin wispy head,aromas of biscuity malt and somewhat floral.Taste is well balanced some lightly sweet bicuit malt and a touch of grassy hop in the finish.A pretty easy quaffer nothing spectacular but a solid well rounded ale,nice toasted malt and a decent hop bittering."
"I love this beer. There is nothing of this quality available in Oklahoma (in the blonde ale category, where this really belongs). Pours to a generous white head and deep golden-amber color. Aroma is predominately sweet malt backed up with floral American hops. Flavor is malty with just enough hop bitterness and flavor to balance it and make it a remarkable drink. Feels good in the mouth and finishes malty, dry with lingering hop flavor. This is an extremely well made beer. Obviously the folks at Sweetwater are competent and conscientous brewers."
"A dark golden colored clear liquid with a thin white foamy head. Lots of bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass, lots of them. There was a little bit of lace on the sides of the glass. Smells faintly floral, and a bit skunky. Taste was sweet in the beginning with a hint of toasted malt. There was just some slight hop bitterness, along with a dry slightly floral finish. Thin body with lots of carbonation. Overall, not bads. This may be a good pale for beginners. I would like more hop emphasis, however that is just my taste. Still, this may do in a pinch, and it was refreshing and went down rather quickly."
"This beer poured a golden amber color with a moderate light head which left a nice lacing along the glass. The smell was high on the hops with the aroma consisting of citris fruits, as well as a slight caramel undertone. The taste is fairly well balanced with hops and malts and is fairly sweet overall. The sweet taste holds throughout the tasting as there is amazingly little to no bitterness at all. The mouthfeel is a little thin but the drinkability is very high as this beer goes down incredibly smooth. Overall, this is a very drinkable APA and I could easily lose track of how many I've had."
"Pours a nice gold-copper color with a 1-2 finger head that dissapated quickly. Nice strong hops aroma with a slight citrus note also, possibly grapefruit. Fulfilling mouthfeel, not watery but not overly thick. Obvious strong hops presence but not overpowering, nice citrus also. Being a local beer i'm a little biased but this really is an enjoyable brew, definitely easy to put a few back."
"Pale golden brew with low to minimal carbonation and a non existent head. Taste is balanced between the spicy aromatic hops and pale malt. Medium body with a grainy and dry mouthfeel that is dead on for the style. Very tasty and drinkable, but lacks any memorable qualities. I'd order it again and again, as the freshness and drinkability put it head and shoulders above most large imports like Bass and Newcastle. Easy to find around Atlanta."
"Clear tangerine honey amber pour with a short lived white head. Attractive island lacing. Aroma is an interesting array of fresh baked white bread with Cascade hops. Mouthfeel is good, mild carbonation without any serious hops bite. There is a taste of grain in evidence(very pleasant here). Taste is excellent. Very well balanced. Perfect blend of hops and malts. Hard to believe this was brewed in Atlanta, Ga. Can't believe I passed this one up during my many trips there. Not hoppy enough to be an IPA, but certainly bittered enough against some quality malts to be world class drinkable."
"Light golden-honey color with a light, lingering head. Very sweet, floral nose. Exceptionally sweet on the palate, again with the honey and a tinge of hops. Fairly thin, but overall it's more than acceptable. A good session beer for hot days, which is I'm sure why it's popular with the folks in Atlanta and Athens."
"Honey colored with a white frothy head - wish it stuck around a bit longer. Smell is pale malts, very sweet, and a crisp hop aroma. The taste is fantastic. I admit, I'm partial to this brew - it's my favorite local beer and has been for years. It just hits me right. A crisp bitterness hits first, followed by a good depth of malt character, and then a fruity dry finish. I love it. This is my definition of a great session beer - it's interesting enough to drink for hours, but not overwhelming, filling, or overly intoxicating."
"Overall an average ale. No off flavors or bad taste, just nothing special about this beer that would make it remember it a hour after drinking it."
"I like the taste of this beer. The hops & malts seem to be in balance. I would like a little more hops in my pale ale, so that is the only fault I can really find with it. Stays almost sweet instead of bitter throughout. Mouthfeel is decent, but a little thin. I think you could drink a lot of this beer. The beer went very good with the shrimp and crab claws I had for an appetizer."
"The beer pours a pleasant to the eye golden yellow, and is topped by a modest white frothy head, that as it evanesces leaves a fine sheet of lace to hide the glass. A slight Georgia peach sweetness hits you up front, malt, fresh and clean, quite pleasant with the start ambrosial and the top slender in feel. Finish is sparsely carbonated with pleasant hop spiciness and the aftertaste lightly sweet and very dry, quite quaffable."
"Golden yellow in color with a white head. Aroma is somewhat malty for a pale ale. This beer is an easy drinker with a good, but very mild flavor. Not aggressivley hopped. More balanced than I expect an APA to be. Finishes crisp and clean. Very drinkable. Probably the best Atlanta beer I had while there. Solid, but not very exciting."
"Great session brew. Amber/Gold with a white head (thin) and very little lacing. The smell is off citrus, some spice and malt - I did not get much of a hoppy smell. The flavor is malty, citrusy, with a bit of hops at the end. It has a bit of a sweet taste in it that I cannot pin down. The beer is refeshing and easy to drink. With a shortage of options in GA, this was always a good choice, and I still enjoy it (A friend from GA brought up a bunch on Thanksgiving)."
"Tasted: 11/15/02"
"Sweetwater 420 is an amazing beer from an amazing brewery. Smack dab in the middle of industrial Atlanta this brewery wows the southeast with its delightful brews. Sweetwater 420 is a rich and tasty pale ale that will cause you to ask that time honored question: ""Did I drink all those already??"""
"The flavors playing in this pale are interesting.  Up front, it starts fairly sweet and astringent, almost like a wheat.  Suddenly, the astringency fades and the hops take over, and almost as suddenly the hops vanish, and the finish is rather tart and clean, with little residual hops bitterness.  Sort of a hops Houdini act."
"This is one of the best beers I have ever had, to me it leaned more to the IPA side than the pale but I'm not complaining. Excellent hoppy aroma deep golden color and a taste to die for. This is for sure in my top 10.............CHEERS"
"I'm not really sure this should be called an APA. There's not enough hop presence and it's low in bitterness for the style. It does have a strong malt backbone, however, unfortunately there's little else to the taste. Solid, easy-drinking beer, but nothing spectacular."
"Enjoyed at Hartsfield International Airport, Atlanta."
