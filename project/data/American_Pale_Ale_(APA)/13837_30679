Citrusy, with a bit of astringency. In a sip or two, I am accustomed to hops and the malt begins to shine. There is some sweetness and toastiness, and as I drain the glass, toasty recedes and something like chocolate takes its place.

The scent carried fresh hops that leans towards pine and citrus. The taste follows the nose quite well. It does have a more bitter than balance. The mouthfeel is medium with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a great beer and could be sessioned.","WoodBrew","Jul 08, 2014"

3.53,-10.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D/O: This beer appears to have originated from what was a great plan on paper, but it shows either timidity or a low-grade inability in its execution. Its principal sensory qualities are well positioned but muted, allowing minor features such as carbonic acid and peanut butter to compete for attention and even interrupt at times. No failing derails it, instead just adding up to a list of misdemeanors that pile on to the forget-ability factor.","beagle75","Oct 20, 2011"

Some suspended micro floaties make me worry that this bottle might be past it's prime. Hopalicious is a good name for the aroma, I love the smell of Cascade hops even if everyone says it has too harsh a bitterness and is an ""outdated"" hop flavor. The nose is pure, fresh Cascade hops and smells like sticking your nose in a bag of fresh hops, candied grapefruit and pine sap with light malt. I love this beer for it's simplicity, the glory of Cascade and a pretty light malt base to let it shine without being really bitter. Medium bodied and slightly chalky. I dig this brew.","biggred1","Aug 23, 2011"

Almost no bitterness. I guess my only wish would be for a little more hop flavor; right now, it's tending toward thin. Medium body and medium-high carbonation. The carbonation seems a bit harsh? Overall, this is a good, easy drinking, floral pale ale.","pmarlowe","Aug 16, 2011"

Pretty lacking for something with the word hop in the name. Taste is the same as the nose, not hoppy enough, but overall very enjoyable though not even as bitter as the Sierra Nevada Pale that was in my glass before it. I'd buy it on occasion if it were available around here.","iwantmorehops","Aug 03, 2011"
4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a hazy golden color with a medium white head and a good lace. The aroma is nice & fruity with some mango and citrus with just a mild caramel hint. The flavor follows with some nice melon and citrus. There is some distinct bitterness in there as well, more bitterness than say your average citrusy fruity pale ale/IPA. There is a mild biscuit maltiness in there as well and not really any sweetness. This is very tasty and one I'd gladly have again from Wisconsin!","CuriousMonk","Jul 20, 2011"
4.45,13.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a semi-clear amber color with a rather thick head of off-white foam. Scent is heavy with hops, a scent of crisp apple, and bitter malts. Taste is smooth, clean, and crisp. Hops are well blended with some spice for a good taste and I'm getting a hint of apples as well. Ends with a dry after taste. Hits the taste buds well with flavor but is still light enough to be enjoyed at a cook-out etc. One of Ale Asylum's most popular brews!","Lemke10","Jul 11, 2011"

3.35,-14.8,4,4,3,2.5,3.5,"Maybe. The most offensive thing about it is not intense, over the top, American-style IPA bitterness. No, the alpha acid levels are actually quite bitterness. But the beer has been gassed to all hell, and on top of that, there's relatively little grain to be found in this bottle (maybe that's how it can get away with being unfiltered), resulting in a way too light malt backbone and a thin body. That said, there's nothing else wrong with it. Still way more drinkable than many American IPAs. Hopalicious is a fine, if one-dimensional, profile of what cascade hops can do.","hreb","Jun 07, 2011"
3.64,-7.4,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Hopalicious is a decent beer overall but not really impressive in any aspect. The flavor is relatively mild and too laid-back to be much above average. Hopalicious is misleading","zachary80","May 27, 2011"
4.33,10.2,4,3.5,5,3.5,4.5,"The beer is a golden orange with just a wisp of pale foam that decorates the snifter with a thin ring. The beer smells very fruity like tangerines and of fresh toasty malts. The beer is delicious with just sweet citrus flavors, well rounded malts and just enough bitterness for balance. This is probably the best tasting APA I've every had. Often I feel like APA's are too bitter without the fresh hop flavors, but this beer hits all the notes and is just so juicy and sweet. Delicious.","Soonami","May 17, 2011"
3.77,-4.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"O: This beer shouldn't be named Hopalicous. I started with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and then moved on to this beer in hopes that the hoppiness would exceed the Sierra Nevada. If you take a closer look, you will see the description of this beer claims that its cascade hops give it a ""bold hop flavor without crazy bitterness."" I didn't expect this APA to be ridiculously hoppy, but the very subtle hop flavor in this was a real let down.","jerskine","Apr 27, 2011"

Taste falls short of what i expected but still nice and balanced. has some sweet pineapple like sugary aftertaste that is appealing but throws me off from the lack of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice as its carbonated well and has a great lasting head.

A hint of carmel might be there too. Pleasant bittrness is light enough to let the lighter malt sweetness to come through. Taste is citrusy with a little grassyness. Very appropriate carbonation level and good finish, maybe a bit of residual sweetness and lots of residual hops. A nice and hoppy pale APA but lacking a bit in the malt backing.

2.96,-24.7,4,3,3,2,3,"A light straw color, very clear, moving towards copper in the very center and thanks to a moderate haze on this one. A 1-2 cm head forms on top, leaving some sticky lacing. This one looks nice at the start. The smell is kind of normal, just a moderate citrus hop presence comes to the nose, mixed in with a light powdery maltiness. The taste comes out first with a light lemon-lime flavor. There's also sort of a hop tea flavor, kind of herbal, leafy, floral - but actually hop tea light might be better. The idea sort of comes because of the lack of malt presence here (but to be honest, the hop presence isn't impressive or overwhelming either). This one is very, very dry - which may also detract from the maltiness I desire, at best I can taste a bit of milled/crushed barley, but without the sweetness. No bread, no caramel. This one really tastes like the average American Pale Ale if I had to say so. The mouthfeel was really thin, very watery. The hoppiness is really the only thing in the body that would help me distinguish this from water - in terms of body alone. This one is very easy to drink - thanks to the wateriness. But it really is not that enjoyable I guess. Actually, the best way to describe it is that it is stuck somewhere bteween what I expect. If you have time, I have a little side note I'd like to go into: with APAs, there seem to be two schools of thought: (i) make the beer malty, kind of bready - a bit more body, but still light in color compared to other styles, add some hops, enough that you notice the flavor and aroma, not a lot of bitterness, but a good citrus presence - not too resinous though, (ii) make it light in color and light in body and light in alcohol, pump it up with hops, especially dry hops, to really show off one particular variety, you let the hoppy flavors carry the mouthfeel and the flavor and everything. Now back to the beer - this one is stuck between the two of these, it had the hop profile of type i but the body of type ii, which is not exactly the best combination to my taste buds.","taylorhamrick","Jul 05, 2009"

Similar tones to the taste - pretty single-mindedly Cascade dominated. Sweet pineapple, a bit of orange rind, flowery herbaceousness, and resinous pine-sap - all very mild and muted. A slightly soapy flavor as the sweetness recedes. In addition to the gentle but dominant hop flavors, a biscuity malt backbone shows itself in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and slightly creamy. As with a simcoe-only IPA i just brewed, I get a bit tired of the soap and sap as the hops fade off the tongue, knocking the drinkability down just a touch.

The head itself is creamy and rocky and exhibits excellent retention with good lacing as well. The nose is very good, being one part orange-citrus, another part lemon rind, with an English ale yeast topping it off. Best of all is the rush of Cascade hops as this beer is cracked and poured. Semi-sweet and lightly tart on the first sip, this one leans well-toward the dry end of the spectrum. Light biscuity malt notes linger along with a mild and comforting bitterness.

3.96,0.8,4,3,4.5,3,4.5,"My introduction to microbrewed beers back in the late 80's started with the pale ale style with beers like Sierra Nevada PA and Anchor Liberty. I liked them back then, but through the years, they seem to have become milder and milder tasting to my palate. Heck, with all the aggressive IPAs as well as DIPAs on the market now, no wonder a ""simple"" pale ale seems so mild now. With that being said, Hopalicious is certainly one of the better American-style pale ales I've had in a while. The bitterness is decent, but not too strong, and there's plentiful hop aroma and flavor. It's a clean-tasting brew which goes down easily. It's probably not a a true session-beer in the ""English sense", but it's about as sessionable a beer as you'll find in most pubs in the States. Given the choice, I would pick this brew over almost any other standard American pale ale on the market. This beer has such great hop character without being high in alcohol. I could go for more micros which are modest in alcohol, yet are bursting with an extremely fresh dry-hopped flavor/aroma character found in this very clean-tasting brew.","ohmybock","Apr 20, 2008"

There is a nice hoppyness to this beer but it fades a bit too quickly. The body is somewhat light and the finish is dry. Mouthfeel is less than average and drinkability is also average.

There is absolutely no mistaking what is in the beer, an in your face citrusy Cascade bonanza. Any malt aroma is very low, maybe a hint of sweetness. The flavor is through the roof with hop flavor. Very fresh, grapefruit-like citrus hop flavor, but the hop bitterness is nicely done at a moderately to moderately-high bitterness. The bitterness is rather clean and as advertised strikingly less than what the smell would lead on. The finish leaves just enough hop flavor on the palate, but not to the point where it is overwhelming. The carbonation is medium, as is the body, and the drinkability, despite the intensity of the hop flavor and aroma is rather high. Overall I enjoyed this beer very much. I think the aroma and flavor of the hops are in your face without lingering to the point where it is over done.

The Cascade hops continue into the flavor with resinous notes of citrus (grapefruit, lemon, pineapple) and pine over a lightly caramelish and just slighty biscuity malt base. The bitterness is well balanced, and it finishes dry and subtly acidic with some lingering notes of piney and grassy hops. Quite nice!

Hop flavor in the finish is a tad stale, but plenty bitter. Light bodied APA with a lightly creamy feel. Puckeringly dry finish. Decent.","alexgash","Dec 23, 2006"
4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability/Overall: a less robust version of their Ambergeddon with less aggressive hops and less malt complexity and more grassy lightness. Remains quite tasty and thoroughly drinkable.","Golden2wenty1","Sep 04, 2006"
3.71,-5.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A Hazy copper/brown brew with a thin tan head. Lacing is excellent, leaving a nice trail as you drink. Looks very nice. Nose is hops and maybe a little pine. Taste is strong cascade hops, some balancing malts in the middle, and a bit of sour fruit. Like grapefruit and lemon, but not sweet at all. Mouthfeel is nice, it's not too thin and goes down smoothly, with some tingly carbonation. Drinkability is decent as well.","shivtim","Aug 16, 2006"
4.42,12.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D- This beer has big juicy hops and the ginger is a perfect amount to give the hops a twist but not being a ginger dominated beer. Whenever I am in Madtown again this will be the first beer I seek out.","rhoadsrage","Jun 29, 2006"

3.63,-7.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"A rather interesting and unique brew that suffers from one deep flaw  a complete lack of finish. Otherwise, Hopalisious stands on its own. Bright orange amber with a thin creamy white head, this brew looks just great. The aroma is strongly citric and obviously Cascade. Flavor is uniquely nectarine skins, subtlety bitter without any of the pine or juniper that sometimes comes with oodles of Cascade hops. This beer is nearly perfectly balanced. It has immense citric flavor without more than a slight bitterness and yet I am not entirely happy. This is because the front offers a perfect medley of citrus while the finish offers nil. This beer dies after the each sip and that is simply unforgivable in an APA. Strong potential and otherwise magnificent, but still lacking any finish.","DaPeculierDane","May 23, 2006"
