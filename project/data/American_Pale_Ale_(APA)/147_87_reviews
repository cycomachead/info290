"Oh stone 1.0 how things have changed."
"O: This was a good beer.  It was expensive, but it was obvious they really took their time.  You want to impress somebody with a good pale ale, this is a top contender, IMO.  Cheers."
"I haven't drank this in years but its impending cancellation spurred me to revisit. Amber color, good head. Aroma is pretty nice, a bready maltiness that almost seems English until you taste it. More malt in the flavor and a crisp slight hop touch."
""
"This is my go to beer. Very flavorful and crisp. Perfect beer for a hot day, or anytime in matter of fact. If you want a good beer look no further."
""
"Maybe I just wasn't expecting these flavors in a pale ale but I did not enjoy this beer.  It is the first I have had in a while that I know I won't buy again.  I might try the ""2.0"" version when it comes out to see how stone changes this brew."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 2/16/2015. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus hops and dark/bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, pine, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale ale. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of citrus/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Really amazing Pale Ale. I could drink this all day. Took me a few sips to really get into the taste because I'm more of a hop head but I really like it."

"Almost no smell at all"
"great steady everyday pale ale"

"Overall:  I am impressed by how malt forward this is especially compared to the rest of Stone's offerings.  Anyone who is fond of malt-forward amber ales will love this."

"Balanced Pale Ale, not like an APA that is more like an IPA but with less body. It is maltier, but still bitter and spicer. They kept their original recipe, almost 20 years ago, and those were different times. That said it is not that tamed compared to old school."

"An odd beer for Stone. You think they'd want to make the hoppiest pale ale of all time, but instead they made what might be the maltiest. Those tricksters."

"This is a nice, mellow, sessionable Pale Ale.  Much more in the English style than in the super hoppy American style, which was a surprise considering Stone's other stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, mmmm...good APA by a stellar company what more could one ask for."

"Dark amber, tan head. Not a fan of the mild body mixed with cough syrup taste. Not the worst beer I've ever had, it's a stone... But wouldn't order it again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor: follows smell.  More medium malt, and perhaps more hops, than the average APA."

"Poured a gorgeous cloudy amber body with a half finger of off-white head, golden highlights when held to light and a nice trickle of bubbles. A very good looking pale ale. Scents of pine resin, wet, earthy herbal hops, floral, jasmine-like hops, a hint of tangerine, a bit of pale malt and a touch of caramel in the background. A nice, hop forward aroma that leans less towards citrus and more to resiny, floral and earthy aromas with a nice balancing malt. Flavor begins with notes of pine resin and earthy herbal hops with moderate bitterness and a low level of malt sweetness. This moves into a more bitter middle with notes of pine resin, earthy herbal hops, floral hops, hints of grapefruit peel and a touch of pale malt sweetness faintly in the background. Finish is medium-dry with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel, light herbal hop character and a touch of biscuit-like malt. Aftertaste is dry with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel and biscuit-like malt. A good hop forward flavor profile that uses its light malt presence to keep the flavor from becoming too bitter. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with low carbonation and a smooth feel. Very nice and quite easy to drink. Overall this is a nice pale ale. It's hoppy, yet not overly so, aromatic, flavor and smooth. It's a nice, simple drinking experience and quite good."

"O: Easy to drink and refreshing with well hidden alcohol. It is flavorful and must have been pretty intense when it was initially released though there are a lot of very flavorful beers in the APA style now available and this one is not quite as intense as some of the newer entrants."

"there are better American pales, but this is just good enough that I'll likely try it again. I like the grain notes -- it almost has an Anchor Steam feel with the toasted grain taste."

"O - Balanced feel and taste. Not over powering in any way but still packs a good amount of flavor and character. Something to drink when I'm tired of IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pale ales, in all honesty, are not my style. I prefer much brasher flavors that favor one side rather than being perfectly balanced. Even with that being said, Stone, with their Pale Ale, delivers a wonderful drinking experience that proves that not all of their beers will send the faint of heart cowering away with their tail between their legs. A wonderfully balanced brew that drinks extremely easily as has become a top-contender for my summertime session choice. I look forward to spending many nights with friends on my couch, a bottle of this in my glass, and the Phillies on my tube."

"Far more malty than anticipated, and the hop character lacks typical west coast flavoring. The bitterness is spot-on for stone, which doesn't jive with my palate. Love the malt character and flavoring hops were decent, but too bitter for me."

"I was expecting more hops from the folks over at Stone. That being said, this brew is delecious. Outstanding color, a deep copper/amberish with a big fluffy white head. The head on this beer is outstanding, very much like that on Sierra Nevadas Celebration Ale. I prefer this to Stones IPA, it seems to me to be a bit more complex and balanced with the malts coming through and not so hop dominated. Very nice."

"Overall - this hit the spot and delivered on expectations."
""
""
""

"Overall: A very good beer, the sediment adds to the appearance and flavor. Similar to IPA, but not there yet, as it should be. I would definitely have again."
""
""
"Home tasting, 12oz bottle into Tulip Glass. 2/4/14"
"nice pour into pint glass. fairly dark in color, amber brown. lots of floating sediment, unfiltered look. fluffy head, nice sticky lacing. good malt backbone on this, some juicy citrus and grapefruity hops. good bite in the finish, well rounded. good texture, light but full, juicy, pretty delicious"
""
"O: Have not had this since I started drinking craft over two years ago. Its a very solid, sessionable pale ale offering, and one I would revisit in the future."
"A wonder. Must try. A favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
"This apa from Stone pours a rich copper amber hue with a frothy white head that lasts for a few minutes and resolves to a gentle white film and lacing. The aroma is very well balanced between malty sweet and hoppy bitter. The body is light to medium and very very drinkable. This is definitely a sessionable beer. The flavor follows the nose. Very smooth and well balanced. No particular notes sticking out. Just smooth enjoyable well crafted beer. This is not like the in your face beers I have come to love and expect from Stone but it us an incredibly well made and crafted ale. One of the best apas iI've had."

""
"O: I'll try it again within the freshness window and re-review. As is, far from a bad beer just a bit light for Stone. Easy to drink, I could see this as a good intro to Stone but for those not as fond of bold hops"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - a decent Pale Ale, but I expected something hoppier from Stone. I would how far out they date this beer, if it started any hoppier."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Realized this one was past the date after the tasting. Still drinkable, although not at all what it was supposed to be. Also, a worthwhile experience to blindly compare fresh and not so fresh pale ales to hone one's palate. I'm a lot better about checking dates now."

"Overall: Pretty standard pale ala. Was expecting more hops from these guys, but wondering where they went when compared with beers in their portfolio."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not maybe the best purchase, now I have seen the date, and has not kept as well as it's higher ABV brothers I have tried. Solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A subtle pale ale that has a good balance of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a really good Pale Ale. Nothing really blows you away, but it's just good all around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I will probably buy this one again. It really surprised me though because I wasn't expecting the hops to come through like they do. I didn't enjoy the beer much at first, but the more I drink it, its quite good. Not as balanced as it probably could be, but I think thats the style that stone was going for with this one. For a pale ale with a little bite, I recommend. Oh, and the bottles are pretty sweet too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is unbalanced, and I would not drink it unless it was the last beer in the planet."
""
"Overall – this is a delicious pale ale that has substance, nuance and flavorful hoppiness. While I like that it is comfortable being a pale ale, better examples of the style are more creative."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Here we have another west coast Pale that doesn't have enough balance to make it a truly enjoyable beer. Much better examples of the style exist, Bell's Two-Hearted and Three Floyd's Zombie Dust to name a few."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A very solid and drinkable beer. Full flavored and loaded with good aroma, I could drink another one easily if I had one. Went great with food (mexican bean & salsa + polenta casserole) and I know it would be good all by itself. I agree with the back of the bottle, probably exceedingly bold for its day, but not mega hoppy by today's standards. That being said, really well done and still a very good beer that accentuates the hops, but isn't excessively bitter. Well done."
""
"o: A classic modern American style pale ale, in that it is on the whole more hop than malt dominated. Some balance but it is the hops which stand out. Extremely sessionable: you do want more after it's gone. Wondering if the low marks and references to maltiness in some reviews here are the result of aged bottles. Not my experience at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer, nothing unpleasant, but not necessarily anything exciting either."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a decent beer, but nothing to write home about and a bit of a disappointment. It's not hard to drink, just doesn't look or taste like a pale ale from California."
""
"O- Not necessarily spectacular in my opinion, but about as solid as an APA gets. Not as bold as I am accustomed to with Stone, but a sure fire go to brew when you want something for any occasion without breaking the bank. The balance and consistency of this one should not be overlooked. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall; definitely a solid beer, good for beginners in the hoppy ale world, unfortunately, and this is my opinion, it does not stand out among lots of other similar pale ales, bordering forgettable."
"O- I can see why this is Stones best selling brand look foward to getting a 6 pack"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: this is not a beer I would buy again. For a pale ale it was far too malty and the hops were metallic tasting, in an unpleasant way."
""
""
""
""
"Check it out: http://youtu.be/DHis2L_OBdg"
""
""
""
""
"Pours an amber tinged brown with an off white head. Tons of caramel on the nose backed up with spicy hops, a hint of citrus zest. Tastes exactly like it smells. Tons of. Caramel malty goodness with overtones of earthy hops and a citrus zest bitterness softly bringing it all together. Pretty thick mouthfeel for an APA in part because of the sweetness. Overall I enjoy this beer. Easy drinking and probably my favorite stone offering so far."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great APA, by far one of my favorites. It has a very rich, yet complex taste. This is an excellent session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like it."
""
""
"Overall- Solid APA. Must try. It will be more amenable to those who like a stronger malt bill but it is not without its hop charm."

"Overall 4.0: As far as grades go, this is an excellent, i.e. ""4.0"" pale ale. It is not, I assume, an ""Indian"" pale ale. This means the level of hops is not equal to that which British brewers introduced to keep beer fresh on the way to the Indian colonies. Interestingly, I take this as a less hopped IPA, which is -obviously-- just a PA. Regardless, this brew is a workhorse. It is fabulous with food but is a sessionable beer that will keep you coming back for another. Highly recommended and relatively cheap: $9 for a six."
"Overall a solid APA from Stone. Less in-your-face than many of their beers, which I appreciate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Isn't this the standard by which all other American Pale Ale's should be measured? They've been making this recipe since July 1996, according to wording on the bottle, which is to say, for eons, considering the fast changing American craft beer market. Nice caramel malt flavors are the sweet to the bitter of this hop heavy ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Another excellent Stone brew. As Double Bastard is Arrogant Bastard's big brother, I'd be inclined to consider this it's little brother. Has a lot of the same flavors, just on a lower level. A damn good tasting beer, highly recommended to anyone who appreciates an ale with lot's going on."

"overall: I would say this may be a benchmark for the pale ale category, alongside Sierra Nevada's classic green label. Never had a bad beer from Stone; think of this as their ""light"" IPA, all the flavor and awesomeness, but in a more session-able variety."
""
"As usual Stone uses quality ingredients in terms of both malt and hops to make one of their most balanced beers. While Stone IPA is distributed across the country Stone Pale Ale continues to have more of a niche following which is fine by me."

"NIce pale ale. Solid flavor and good balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one is a clear and copper colored brew. The head is white and leaves a nice lace. The smell is clean and balanced with both malt and hop qualities. Herbal and earthy in aroma...some underlying stone fruit.m the taste is more assertive....bitter ans strong. On the dry side, but lots of malt flavor. Hop resin and flavor is prominent throughout. Full body and satisfying."
""
""
"Overall: Excellent example of the style. This brew always makes me happy, as I don't have it as often as other pale ales."

"Clear burning orange in body with off-white fluffy head that lasts. Aroma of citrus, dry grass, bready, caramel notes. Tastes of biscuits, dry grass, evolves into citrus notes, mild bitterness finishes it up. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Thick and chewy. A Stone offering that has history, mild flavor profile for modern times but still a good easy drinkin' brew."

"This offering pours up a deep gold/medium amber with a small half finger head, no real retention, and bits of lacing. The nose is kind of pine, bread, and citrus. Taste is a very sweet almost apple juice flavor on the initial sip giving way to a grapefruitiness and finally a spicy hop finish. Mouthfeel is pleasant. This is a good one, maybe not the best ever, but solid."
"A nicely hopped APA. A bit restrained for Stone, but it's appreciated here. Drinkable and still carries that distinct Stone finish. I need to remember to drink this as a go to APA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great American pale ale. This is by all means a ""go to."" While not as outrageous as some of Stone's other beers, this shows that they can indeed make a very good ""standard"" ale."
"O – Just average, may be due to the date of the bottle, but the major notes on this one are malts and more malts. Its not bad, but not sure I'd seek out a freshie."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a simple, malty pale ale. Big simplicity makes this one a go-to when you want something simple and clean with refinement."
""
""
"O: One of the best examples of Californian APA there is. A good session or pairing beer. It is a bit on the sweet caramel side with a darker color than other APAs. I think it's wonderful and has unique character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a nice pale ale which is well balanced and easy to drink. One of my first California microbrews which will always have a soft spot in my refrigerator. A brew that pairs well with almost any food and is also a great session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is leaning more amber than expected. Finger thick head on a 10 oz pour - eggshell colored. Good mouthfeel. The aroma is closer to an Arrogant Bastard - bitter. Taste is milder than expected given the profile to this point - don't get me wrong it is bolder than many and still solid."
""
""
""
"O: Not the most exciting beer or even the most exciting pale ale. Easily drinkable and moderately tasty, but nothing too special."

"I bought this beer because I realized I hadn't had it in a while. I didn't realize that I had failed to ever review it on BA. It's actually pretty odd pale ale for Stone, in the sense that it is balanced and not particularly hoppy. It is absurdly drinkable, greater than the sum of its parts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good brew. I would have this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Solid pale ale. Something easy to drink when you want to drink a lot of beer. Might even be safe to call this a session beer at only 5.4% ABV. I know I've done it before."
""
""
""
""
"O: Leaning toward the side of an IPA, this pale ale is one of the more common Stones that you can find. Regardless, it is a good start point for getting into the Stone variety and a very good pale ale!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, I got this beer on clearance for $5 a six pack. I'd say it's one of the best $5 I've ever spent. It's a delicious offering from Stone, that I would definitely buy again."
""
""
""
""

"Overall Drinkability: I like this best because of the cedar notes."

"If you haven't had Stone's Pale Ale you are really missing something special! This beer is not your typical Pale Ale...it is more malty than most Pale Ale's that I have had. Great brown color, lasting head, and a nice malty, yet very well balanced flavor, makes this beer stand out from the rest! If you don't like bitter/hoppy beer and stay away from Pale Ale's, do not ignore this beer. It is not hoppy by any means and yet at the same time it is not overly sweet or malty either. Stone's Pale Ale is a well balanced beer that you will enjoy over and over again!"

"I really enjoyed this American Pale Ale. It had a medium hop fruit flavor that was not over powering. Light amber in color with a clean crisp pour. A nice mild pale ale from stone. This is one of my favorite breweries. Have not tasted a beer i didn't like come out of this north county San Diego brewery. All around great brew."
""

""
""
"Overall - Smooth and easy to drink. Not as hoppy as other pales, and really, its pricy, between 11-14.99$ ive seen this for a 6-pack. Its worth a drink but there are better pales out there, and cheaper also."
""
"O Overall it is a good beer that I can drink again but there are others out there that are better I think."
"Overall - I wanna like this beer... but I can't. The soapy character present is just too much to overlook. Outside the soapiness there are real positive qualities, but not enough to save it from mediocrity. It's drinkable, but not something I'd prefer to drink.... candidate for a re-review. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood."

"For a pale it's average but I was expecting much more from stone. Chalky and dry but otherwise very easy to drink with adequate malt and bitterness. The price tag will keep me from buying more."

"Taste is a lot of bubblegum for some reason. Initial citric sweetness, dry herbal hoppiness and coarse dry mouthfeel. Soapy and bubblegum flavors linger. Not digging this one bit. Off-flavors seem to settle out with a couple more sips, but the flavors dont meld together any better. Whats up with this one? tough to finish."

"Appearance is a dark copper (darker than most pale ales), with a big billowy head with great retention and lacing. Scents are a very nice blend of citrus and bread. The taste is more malt-forward than the the scent implies, and more so than many other pale ales - bready and earthy, with a slight floral hops bitterness to provide balance. Good mouthfeel for the style. Not the best product offered by Stone, nor the best pale ale available, but still enjoyable."

""

"The beer is a dark amber color with a very heavy cap of white foam. The aroma fits the bill for the style and invites you in. The beer lays down easy with a caramel malt backbone and a heavy hand of bitter, citrus hops. Highly drinkable, very tasty, and well balanced."

"On tap at the brewery. The beer arrives a crystal clear golden amber color with a nice 1.5 finger white head, good retention, and decent lacing. The nose is mild but approachable with earthy hop character along with a gentle pale 2-row malt base. According to the tour guide only 2 malts used (2-row and crystal 60? Not sure he wouldn't confirm). The flavor is nice and easy drinking. The hops again are a little earhty in character with the malt base providing a pleasant flavor. Mildly bitter, very approachable. Lighter bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is an easy drinking Pale. Amazing that when it was introduced it was a hop bomb of sorts and now that seems to be the norm, a trendsetter."

"Overall, a nice pale ale but it could some more hops."

"Pours copper with one finger white head. Aroma is nicely floral, with a nice citrus and strong malt backbone. Bittersweet finish with the hops follows an up front sweetness, toffee, biscuits, fruits, hint of citrus and mango. Easy drinking, medium carbonation, slightly resiny. Good example of the style. Nice beer."
""
"Good balance, good craft!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours an dark orange color with a medium sized white head and above avearge lacing. Smell is heavy grapefruit citrus and biscuit. Taste is not very complex but pleasent with malt sweetness and fruitiness, backed by a grapefruit bitternss. Mouthfeel is medium with good drinkability."

"This meets my expectations of a pale ale rather well. While a bit on the bitter side, it is still a balanced beer. I'm looking forward to trying more of the beers from Stone when i can get my hands on them."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper with a big fluffy head that forms into a thin ring around the glass. Spotty lacing throughout. Floral hop aroma with some pale bready malts in the background. Taste is similar with full malt flavor up front with a nice hopped finish. Seems pretty balanced. Medium bodied."
"At first a very nice looking beer with a nice creamy looking head. The smell was not one I'd come to expect from a pale ale, somewhat off smelling to me but clean and fresh. When the beer actually hit my tongue for the first time I was a little disappointed by the result. It's not the actual taste that put me off but rather the strange, lingering bitterness that felt bland and unpleasant. It just worked to mask all the other flavors of the beer, which if I could taste, I'm sure it would be great! I love Stone brewery and will always continue to buy from them, but this is one you will not find me buying again any time soon."
"O-this is a very nice beer. Nothing exceptional, nothing stands out, except the awesome smell, but one I could never turn down, and could enjoy anytime of the year."
""
""
"O - Very nice. An easy drinker with full flavor and a tasteful hop level. I'd even pull the hops back a bit in the aftertaste if possible and then call it super."
""
""
""
""
"O- A very nice straightforward pale ale."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice copper ale with a sheet of white foam and excellent clarity leaving some decent lace. A somewhat spicy smell with an unusually english malt profile from this brewery. There some aromas of prune and citrus. Flavor is malty with again spicy hops and a good english (almost high end ESB) malt character. Really nice flavor, just not what I expected from this brewery. Medium bodied with moderate carb and an off-dry finish. Nice pale ale, really dig the take. Not all flashy like some of todays offerings."
""
"O: Wow, this was the first time I've had Stone's pale ale and I was expecting a beer that barely qualifies as a pale. But they were surprisingly even in creating this beer. There's no harshness to it at all. It'd be perfect with practically any meal. The finish is clean and delicious. This beer is a beauty"

"Poured into a glass tumbler. Pours a medium red-orange amber. A half finger fine slightly off-white head that slowly dissipates to a light film. Aroma of herbal hops, sweet malt and a hint of citrus. Flavor of bready and caramel malts and hops. Finishes with malt and herbal hops. Light to medium bodied. Not as hop forward as other Stone brews, but appropriate for the style. A nice pale ale."
""
"O: A very solid, balanced and easily drinkable pale ale. Not much else to say."

"O - About as good as a Pale Ale can get in my opinion. Well balanced, hoppy, smooth."
""
""
""
"O - I'll admit I am not a hop fan. This is one of Stone's year around beers."
"this beer is good. it pours a darker than most pale ales amber brown color with a thick creamy head that leaves near perfect lacing. the smell has a very sweet butterscotch and fruity smell it reminds me of fermenting apples. the taste is similar to the smell at fist and flows into a small bite of hops with some faint bitterness that lasts briefly. the feel in the mouth is more creamy than crisp but that's not to say it is lacking any carbonation. i will definatly be picking this one up in my next mixed six pack i grab. Cheers."
""
"When reviewing this one has to dismiss any other Stone beers they have had before, especially of they are lovers of the hop as I am. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my trusty affligem chalice. I love the appearance a bit darker than a ""pale"" ale but a beautiful two finger head and a deep orange. Nose is nice malts and slight grassy piney. No definitely not a ruination but I can enjoy a beer afterwards without having to bump up the IBU. Nice mix of British PA and California PA. Malty with a eccentric piney aftertaste. Light to medium bodied with the enduring oily hops. Overall an excellent Pale Ale. Definitely great for a sunny afternoon session without killing you for the evening. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Copper pour with a nice head. Sweet smell of fruit and pine. Nice hoppy, piney bitterness that is balanced nicely with the malt flavor. A very drinkable pale ale but I wasn't as blown away with it as I thought I would be. I made the mistake of trying their IPA before having their pale ale. Will definitely try again."
""
"Love the burnt red orange appearance and hoppy caramel nose it gives off. This beer is refinely refreshing while at the same time tasting like caramel hops together all the way through. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth which makes each sip easy to drink despite the bitter character. Gotta be inthe mood for some hops when you drink this because after each drink I can taste the bitterness (not a bad thing). I've been impressed with the Stone brewing company thus far, and look forward to having more of their stable of beers."

"a cool pale ale, i view this one as sort of a hybrid between the english and the american pales. pours rather red for a pale ale, big fluffy head too. smells like english malts and caramel, but also a very robust oily hop vibe. flavor is hops prominently, in the american vein, but dusty english malts in the body. love this mix. almost an ipa, but more going on here. highly rated for a reason. mouthfeel is good, a little heavy than most pale ales. a sixpack might be a stretch, but i like a good challenge. pricey but a nice example of what a pale ale can still offer. thanks for this one stone"
""
""
"The best part of this beer, in my opinion, was the smell. The hard work that the people at Stone brewing company put into this beer's creation is most evident in the complexity of the smell of this ale from when it is freshly poured till the final sip."
""
""
""
"Sampled from a standard pint glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, but imperfect. The malt and hops are quite well balanced, with plenty of fruity aroma. However, the hop flavour seems attenuated, possibly by age. Also, the harsh background bitterness detracts from the overall character. A decent American pale ale, but not outstanding."
""
""
""
"O - Wow, great nose and perfectly balanced. Add its drinkability. Excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange-amber with a nice head. Smells hoppy with earthiness and florals. The hops assert their presence in the flavor with a distinct mild level of bitterness, piney. Some sweetness from the malt is there. Balanced but this has always felt, to me as a non-hophead, to be a hop forward pale ale. But I like it, it's assertive but not too strong. This was one of my first american pale ales and remains one of my favorites for the style. This isn't a beer I go to all that often, but usually once a year I do have to go out of my way to pick up a 6'er of this and always enjoy it."

"Overall smooth and flavorful. A great example of an APA. Easy to drink with a lot of subtle flavor that I look for in lower gravity beers. Hops are apologetically west coast in character without being overpowering."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Might not be my favorite offering of Stone, and definitely not what I would personally consider to be a representative example of the West coast APA style - although that doesn't matter, as they've pulled off the beer they intended to make here. It is a good quality product that is sure to be a crowd pleaser to those that couldn't stand Arrogant Bastard, as well as other intense products by Stone. Not sure why they consider this to be one of their flagship beers when they're so renowned for their hops and crazy recipes, but it still stands as a good beer that I would recommend a try."

"O-The classic. Good beer, not great in my opinion. A bit too watery for my taste."

""

"Gotta say, I was expecting more hops in Stone's pale ale. Sierra Nevada has more hop character in their PA than Stone, which kinda made sense when I compare SN's Torpedo to Stone's IPA. I think they like to make the hop presence a little more subtle than most in Escondido. The hops really come out in the mouthfeel and bitter aftertaste. The prominent malt presence makes this a well balanced brew that is easy to drink. A solid beer, I'll pick this up when I'm looking for a bit more malt in my pale ale."
""

""

"O- love stone and their brews, another A in my book. Not too much going in the beer but plenty to be a great brew."
""
"Pours a copper color w/ a one finger off white head. Massive lacing on my snifter glass. Somewhat hazy in appearance. The nose is caramel, hops, malt, and some floral notes. A little on the weak side, but improves with warming. The taste is fairly pleasant, with the hops really coming out to balance the malt. Not bitter at all, w/ a smooth aftertaste. I can see putting several of these down after mowing the grass, or any other summer activity. Overall, not a bad beer for the style. Cheers."

"This drinks kinda like an English pale, nice to see an American pale ale that's not a hop bomb now and then. Easy drinking but a little bland to me."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy auburn color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by piney hops. Taste is a hop bomb. Significant bitterness throughout, no balance to speak of. Feels medium bodied and very bitter in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."
"Taste is great, malt with subtle hops and a mild bitterness. Medium body with minimum carbonation."
"O- a good pale ale with ecent flavor and balance. Good with many foods."
"O-I like this one a lot, Stone sure knows how to make a good brewski. totally seeing myself indulging myself with more Stone in the future"
"Had this recently and was a bit surprised. Not that it was bad, just that I wasn't surprised by it on the upside. It had a darker pale ale appearance with decent head and poured into a pint glass. There wasn't that much nose to it. Certainly not a overally hoppy pale ale. It tasted good. Fine in the mouthfeel area and overall good."
"Stone Pale Ale is...quite good...lots going on with this one. The beer pours a slightly hazy copper color with nice off-white head that is lacing like a Vicky Secret model. The smell includes fresh hops and pine. The taste is a brilliant combo of hops and malt. The hops keep the beer crisp....the malt enought to balance the hops and kept the beer creamy. The mouthfell is good...not over powering with the nice 5.4% ABV....Session....definite possibility. Overall a very good beer. Try it!"
"Excellent beer, I would recommend it to anyone"
"O- A really nice pale ale that has a nice balance of hop flavors and malt. I have this on tap a few times and this was not quite as good as I remember it being on tap, but still a really solid pale ale."
"O- A quite good pale ale. Verges on being a hoppy amber ale. Worth a shot all in all."
"It is good beer and I expect stone not to be shy about the hops as it is their trade mark but honestly this is so close to an IPA just slightly smoother and sweeter, I would actually call it an IPA light rather than an APA. Or maybe it is a hoppy Amber?"
"A really nice, well balanced Pale Ale with great hop character. A solid beer from Stone."
"Stone's pale ale sticks to the style with accuracy, though is a bit unchallenging. The potency of their Arrogant Bastard does not seem to imply that they mean to follow this with every release. Still, a more-than-adequate APA, though I will probably stick to others in the future."
"Overall: A very nice pale ale from Stone. Full flavored and well balanced."
"D - A nice APA. Clean and is quite bitter. That being said, I think it could benefit from more malt character."
"m-slight cream very hearty yet goes done really smooth."
"The taste starts with a light pale malt front, light and fruity, with some citrus and grapefruit notes from the hops. Finishes bitter but nothing too intense."
"O: A little too bitter on the finish for my taste, but still pretty good. I liked the Hazed & Infused slightly better."
"Overrall: Not a bad choice by any means, just not one of my favorite APA's.. and certainly not worth raving about. That said, it's still probably better than the majority of APA's on the shelf.."
"O - Pretty unremarkable, but easy to get down, and can make a session of it if you want. Nothing I'd ever seak out."
"A pretty good beer overall, but not as good as I thought from before. Rating a lot of good beers since will do that."
"O: Too bitter for me per the style, but perhaps this is due to me being three weeks past the ""best by"" date. I'd be willing to give this one another go with a fresher bottle. Picked up in a ""mix 'n match"" sixer, obviously it was available due to age."
"O: Not an overly aggressive pale, but a good, solid pale ale."
"O: minimalistic pale ale from a complex brewery, most simple and toned down of their brews I've had yet, should be a great introduction for a transition into ""craft brewery""."
"Bright red copper, quite clear with a huge frothy head and lots of lacing. The smell is citrus and floral hops with a bit of a metallic or yeasty character in there as well. The taste follows the smell with the main players being the hops, maybe more floral flavors than what is found in other west coast pale ales and IPAs but regardless the focus of the beer is clear. The malt is in there as well but only for support of the hops and seems to be mainly comprised of just typical caramel malts. I would have liked it to be a bit more well rounded. This beer has a moderate body and carbonation the finish is quite dry and puckering. Overall this is a good beer, but to me the APA style should yield beers that are good for a session and this one doesn't seem to fit that bill. It appears that other reviewers are finding more malt than I do, could have something to do with the age of the beers I have, they are getting close to the best by date."
"Overall a nice specimen."
"A very drinkable beer like most things Stone makes."
"This was one of the last widely-available brews from Stone that I tried. Nothing mind-blowing, but a solid pale ale nonetheless."
"O: Very flavorful. Very good Pale Ale. As per usual with Stone, good but not something I could have often."
"D/O- Besides the look, I found it mostly dull and uninteresting as a whole. Easy drinking though? Yes. Made me burp a lot and I like that."
"Like all Stone beers this is very good but this one is sort of heavy and lacking the sophistication I would expect from the style."
"Drink- One of the 1st pales and 1st craft beers I had before venturing out. Great balance and hop note. Right where it should be as a small pale with some nice flavors."
"Overall, nicely done."
"Draught @ Cambridge House: This one poured a slightly orangish-amber color. There was a decent off-white head on it that left some lacing. Decent, but slightly lighter aroma. Mainly malty with a fair amount of piney hops. The taste is good also. Nice malt body, with no sweetness. A bit of piney hops, with maybe a bit of grapefruit. Not overly bitter. Just a real nice APA."
"O: Very please with Stone's APA. Was most surprised by the character of the hops."
"Medium amber with a thick, clingy head. Smell is subdued. Malt and mild hop aroma. Taste is much more aggressive. Nice and malty on the front with a quick punch of fruity hops. Pleasant bitterness on the back end. Lots of bright hops. Mouthfeel is slick and sticky with medium carbonation. Delicious. Stone is just brilliant at making these great hoppy ales and IPAs. I could down several of these."
"O- Great beer, I would highly recommend it. One of my current all time favorites. Not an overly complex beer, but close to perfect for the style."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer and a nice break from the American style. Probably won’t be a new go-to beer, but I’d be happy to have it again."
"O - Stone Brewing co. knows what they are and how to appeal to peoples taste. Good beer to keep around here"
"M - Seems to improve as the beer warms a little but overall pretty smooth medium bodied with moderate carbonation"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, it pours a copper color slight haze, nice off white thick head which has good retention and leaves a nice lace. The smell is slightly sweet caramel malt, slight hop smell, seems odd to me to have a stone without the in your face hops. Medium light feel. The taste is pretty good tasty caramel malty goodness, some hop bite on the way down, this is a very good Pale Ale, I could see me putting a few of these back in a session."
"O: A solid drinker and a hoppy Pale Ale. Fairly sessionable for hop heads. I'll have it again."
"The most relaxed easy drinking Stone Brew out there. Good beer when you would like to drink more than one or two. I'd call this a gateway beer, a must drink!"
"I will try not to use ‘relatively’ three times in the next review."
"Bottle. Poured into a Surly nonic glass a nice caramel copper color with a 2 finger off whtie head. The aroma is rather light but I get ntoes of toast and tropical fruit, maybe pineapple or mango, also caramel. Medium mouthfeel. Sweet caramel and light brown sugar upfront with a nice hop bitter kick in the middle. Head leaves some lace as it settles. Overall, pretty easy drinking. No notice of the ABV. Some bitterness lingers."
"(Draught at our hotel in San Diego). Pours clear copper color with tan head. Moderate carbonation. Aroma is heavy malts, citrus, and resin. Taste is semi-sweet with some moderate bittering hops. Thin and a bit watery, its has an oily texture. Ok beer."
"O: An awesome pale ale. Great drinkability and balance. Might be my new go to beer, wish it was a bit cheaper though."
"I put this exceptional beer right there with ""Victory Prima Pils"" I just love the quality comming from America these days! This beer has a burnt dark chocolate hop flavor that will make your tongue twist and curl around every drop. It is intuitively obvious to the beer loving taste bud that this is one fine quality beer. The fermentation and aroma are superior to other beers. The after taste runs away too quickly... making one chase after that perfect flavor. YUM! Publix mix a 6 pack purchase is how I stumbled upon this beauty. 4 were throw aways, one was good, and this one was life changing!"
"This beer pours out as a golden color with a strong looking head on it. The lacing is pretty good. The smell of the beer has a nice hop aroma and a light malt aroma in there too. The taste was a little disappointing for a stone brew in my opinion. The mouthfeel isn't too bad, but still overall this is probably my least favorite Stone brew."
"""Stone"" is all you have to say on this one. I've never had a stone beer that I didn't like, or wouldn't be happy to drink anytime, anywhere."
"It was ok. Good promise with initial bitterness and balance of malts. But it wares off and falls a little flat. It fits the style of a pale but I think some of Stones other offerings are far superior"
"A very good beer - if it were available fresh in Australia at American prices this would be a regular purchase for me. Not a session beer, it's too flavoursome for that, but I would happily drink a couple in a sitting."
"D-Overall i was very pleased with this APA. Had enough going on that made me want more. I loved the hop profile and how well everything was balanced. a nice APA"
"O: The beer is very easy to drink, quite refreshing and has a lot of flavor compared to other beers in the style. I could easily have more than one of these in a sitting."
"It is a decent lawn-mowing beer, but most other Stone beers are much better. Only pick this up if it is on sale."
"O - Really good beer, unusually constructed for a West Coast APA."
"On the take home scale I would take home a six pack."
"Reviewed on: 5/12/2011"
"Taste is skillfully balanced, with some bitter qualities -- maybe some sour grapefruit, alongside darker malts that add a sweet quality. Very drinkable and enjoyable!"
"Drunkability: Definitely a malt forward pale ale. I like it. Could go with food or by itself."
"O - This has really good drinkability. I could easily drink 6-pack of these in a night. It has great flavor and goes down very easy. This is a great APA, and I recommend trying it. I will continue to purchase these. Cheers."
"Not my personal favorite take on the style but very well crafted and balanced none the less. Very appealing to both malt and hop lovers. Has almost a hoppy brown ale characteristic. Closer to a little Arrogant Bastard rather than the IPA in my opinion. Very sessionable. I just dont get the price point here. I mean I am a local to Stonebrew yet I can get a 6er of Lagunitas IPA or NB Ranger IPA for cheaper than their Pale? Explain that logic."
"D: Definitely would go back to this pale ale as it has all the qualities i like in the style. Great color, great lacing and hops to write home about."
"Not as good as it is on draft. Wouldn't really spend 10 bucks on a sixer."
"Taste is excellent example of a classic West Coast style APA, with excellent body, character, depth, balance, and complexity. It has spicy-peppery grapefruit-pine bitterness with caramel and toasty sweetness, juicy yeastiness."
"Not bad, but something in the flavor is contributing a vegetal note which just rubs me the wrong way. Might be the hops, might be a yeast byproduct (DMS maybe?), but I don't really like it. Not my favorite, but still, not a bad beer."
"Finish: Bitter hops with heavy malt"
"O: If I were looking for an IPA, I would have been WOWed. As a pale ale, not so much. A great brew in the wrong classification."
"Overall - awesome beer, loved it! Was a well balanced tasting beer that went down vey easy."
"O: I knew Stone could do it! Actually, no I didn't. I honestly thought this was going to be another Cascade tongue bruiser, but in this case, it was good to be wrong...."
"A very solid session beer in the mold of Brooklyn Lager and Sierra Nevada Pale; I’d drink this again and again at the Zoo! (And elsewhere!)"
"overall this is a solid pale but nothing mind blowing - it is rather pricey at $11 a sixer"
"Acceptable out of the bottle as it is on the tap, sort of the smaller younger brother though."
"O: easy drinking pale ale, almost too easy as I got it to have with my food, but the beer is half gone but no food."
"D: Something of an anomaly from Stone-a malt-centric beer in the English style. I'm not in love with it, but it was OK for what it was."
"O - Great pale ale that is american but still brings honor to the good maltcentric english styles."
" This is an autumn ale, leafy and woody. It's not hard to drink this ale, make sure you are a malt head as this beer was much more of a barley based drink than I expected. The hops could be brought up a notch. It's a good session beer, but not as finely balanced as the California classic Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"Overall - I like it would still rather have an IPA over an APA any day but I would never complain about it. Lovely brew here go grab one for yourself and check it out."
"Overall: One of the best APAs I have had. Complex, yet very drinkable. Slightly bitter but the sweet core keeps it well balanced. This beer actually improves my opinion of Stone more than all the extreme beers. Making a mouth-wrenching IPA or Strong Ale is easier than the subtle balance needed for this APA."
"it was relatively thin and ""silky," and it left a pleasant oily texture in my mouth."
"A very hop forward pale that is also very drinkable. It has a hop profile like some IPA's, but enough malt to keep the hops in check. I would call this a really good beer."
"Pretty good example of the style. Handily washed down a polish sausage with cheese."
"D: An above average beer. I would not turn this one down, but finish is too dry to have more than one."
"M- Creamy and smooth. Malts linger on the tongue with slight hop bitterness in the background. Not my personal feel but great beer."
"Drinkability - A nice all around brew. Good to very good in all aspects. Good balance of flavors and low ABV make this one to remember."
"Poured from the tap a soft amberish orange with a tight white head that was fed by a nice amount of carbonation. Smell is mostly citrus and some grass and pine hops with a hint of some briess malt. Taste is similar to the nose a soft citrus and pine hop forefront with a very gentle malt body with a dry hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was light and smooth. Drinkability was good. Very nice pale ale from stone but I will have to say SA still is my go to pale ale."
"DELICIOUS PALE ALE, TRY THIS!"
"Drinkability: An admirable brew, adept example of an APA."
"Definitely wouldn't mind having this again, maybe fresher and in a 6-pack. One of my new favorites!"
"D- Not a huge Pale Ale fan but this one was way better than most. Definitely recommend this one."
"D: This beer was much sweeter than I prefer, but the more I sipped, some sweet pine notes came through that were pleasing."
"Available, affordable, and easy-drinking. A great staple to have in any fridge."
"D: One of the 3 Stone beers that I find easily sessionable (along with the Levitation and IPA). Nice flavor and goes down nice and easy"
"Poured into a pint glass. Was a deep copper color with a thick white head, which dissipated pretty quickly leaving just enough foam for some nice lacing to coat the glass. Overall look is great. Aroma is somewhat restrained, a slight touch of hops but mostly the malt coming through here, a little caramel or maybe toffee. Taste starts just a tad sweet but quickly taken over by the bitterness of the hops. A bit too much for my taste as I don't even get a lot of flavor from the hops here, just the bitterness. Finishes very dry with lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is fairly light bodied with somewhat heavy carbonation. Drinkability takes a hit for me as even the lingering bitterness is enough to make it a little rough."
"Atmosphere is great. Nice amber color with a really great, thick, creamy head, and lots of dry sticky lacing. Nose is grainy, hoppy, and sweet all mixed up in a nice package. Flavor follows suit. Baked bread, sharp hops, and sweetness. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"D - Meh I guess I was expecting this beer to be more hop forward like their IPA's but found it aggressively grainy and bitter. Really wouldn't consider getting it again."
"Mouthfeel is light, while being lively thanks to the strong carbonation. May be a bit too light at times though, and could have benefited from an increased body, as this is more and more like an English Bitter the more I drink it. Unfortunately, rating to the style, this falls short a bit, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't have this again."
"Overall - A pretty decent APA - nothing groundbreaking just a good, clean well made APA... recommended..."
"A very good APA."
"Overall: A quality Pale Ale that leans ever so slightly in the direction of the hops."
"D - What can I say...a wonderful pale ale that I enjoyed until the end. It's not quite what I was expecting, and I like being pleasantly surprised."
"The beer is a nice copper/ burnt orange color with a lofty, foamy, off-white head. It smells of pine, grapefruit, sugar and caramel malt. Piney bitterness dominates the flavor profile, there are also hints of lemon, and buttered biscuits with a bready aftertaste. It has a light-medium body, there is bubbly carbonation and a dry finish. I think this might be my new favorite pale ale, it has a lingering bitterness that makes you yearn for more. I would drink this over and over again."
"D-drinkable, if I would want to drink it..."
"Notes: It's an all-around solid Pale Ale."
"D: A good beer, but it isn't one that I would particularly seek out- either as a pale ale or as one of Stone's offerings. Worth a try though, and I certainly wouldn't turn another down."
"Foggy caramel body, thin white head. Very herbal, tobacco, nutty nose. Heavy tobacco taste that resonates on the back of the tongue, medium-long aftertaste of the same characteristics. Hoppy and spicey mouthfeel. Not a fan of Pale Ales, but this beer would go well after catching a buzz. Has a nice kick that might be overpowering when completely dry, but after a few drinks it works pretty well. Great for 3/4 the way through the night."
"Overall an very solid APA and one that I can only imagine would be a winner when fresh."
"D-Fantastically drinkable, a bit on the bland side, nothing too fancy, a pretty decent beer."
"From a 6 pack shared with a couple non-BAs. Poured into a pint glass, the appearance is amber with a one finger head. Its smell had a medium level of hops, some citrus and grain too. The taste of this pale ale is caramel malt, hops, brown sugar. MF is medium, with a good carbonation to it and bitter finish. Drinkability is OK and it went well with some turkey sandwiches that we were eating. For me, I thought it was a good pale ale, not a great one."
"This beer was not what I expected. A nice amber color. Smells grapefruity/hoppy with kind of a funky skunky smell. The taste really threw me. It has an unexpected harshly bitter/musky taste that I didn't particularly like. It's different...I'll give it that. It seems rather harsh for a pale ale...more like an IPA. Kind of funky even for an IPA. Honestly, I don't think I would buy it again..."
"Drink - I enjoyed this beer more as it neared room temperature. It is an easy drinking version of Stones IPA, very sessionable. Good.. not great."
"D - I was expecting a little more out of a Stone beer, but it was certainly drinkable."
"Pours a very slightly hazy amber-orange. A sticky-icky tannish head. Slow carb trailers.. a fine-looking brew. Smell is big-time apricot and a bit of mango. Taste is fresh and leafy, grapefruit-citrus. The twang of ripe, exotic fruits at the end, along with a pretty powerful bitter hops feeling for a pale ale. Drinks good. Feels tight and spicy, and is carbonated well. I could definitely use more malts, but this one has some other nice complexity, even though the overriding character is of hops. I can't believe it took so long for this to arrive in my area!"
"Drinkability - What a great all around brew. Good to very good in all aspects. This would make a superb session beer in that it's easily quaffable, relatively low in ABV and really just fun to drink. A very, very nice beer."
"D: A pretty solid pale ale. It's got good body, good taste, and it is very smooth. It's a very solid standard from Stone."
"Good drinkability."
"Drinkability: fairly drinkable, I'd have no problems finishing Stone Pale Ales all day long/"
"Last time I had one, I drank it side-by-side with their IPA. I kept asking my friend who poured them, ""are you sure this is the pale? Are you SURE?"" The pale is darker and, in my opinion, has a less-balanced hop profile than the IPA. It's just not what I want from a pale ale."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a dimpled mug. Pours a clear amber color with a thick and frothy two finger off-white head that settles slowly and heavily laces the glass. Aroma is malty and sweet with notes of honey, caramel, citrus, grapefruit, spice and floral hops. Flavor is also sweet and malty with notes of floral hops, honey and caramel, bread, yeast, slight citrus and hop overtones. Generally light to medium body with a pleasing malty finish. One of my favorite Pale Ales!"
"D- it's just a bit more than average, for where I live price and other options will leave me looking past this one again."
"I know a lot of people dig Stone but I just don't like their hoppy stuff. I went at this one with an open mind but it turned out much like their other ones. Just doesn't do it for me."
"Good beer, I'm a fan."
"Excellent pale ale, crisp, refreshing, good body but not too heavy, great balance of sweet/bitter."
"Good looking red color with just over 2 fingers of head that retains well, nice lacing. Has a fairly mild citrus smell. Mouthfeel is relatively light with the degree of carbonation I expected. Very drinkable with good hoppy character that doesn't blow your doors off, a good session beer I think. I'm not normally a big pale ale fan but enjoyed this one and will buy again."
"The mouthfeel is on the more medium-bodied side, but fairly carbonated. It's also a decently drinkable pale, just a little sweeter than I like. This is a decent pale ale, it doesn't quite stack up to Sierra Nevada's flagship, but it's worth drinking. Freshness codes would probably help a lot, I have no idea how old this beer is."
"Everything about this Pale Ale is just right. Nothing is overdone or over the top. The balance of components is superb. It complements any meal. I would recommend this to anyone just beginning to explore the wide world of beer as an example of what is good beer."
"Poured on-tap at the Stone Brewery. The beer has a golden-brownish color with a light, airy head. There is a malt nose, and that is followed by a heavy malt flavor with bits of hop undertones. The low alcohol and lack of body make this a watery beer in mouth. There is a distinct and heavy hoppy aftertaste, with a bitter finish. The beer is fairly easy to drink because there isn't a whole lot of substance to it."
"No hop bomb, but definitely a potential session beer. Would like to find it on keg or cask, to see if the flavour profile expands... but in the meantime, would purchase another bottle!"
"Its a different pale ale than most pales that I've had and that is a good thing. Great session beer if I do say so myself."
"There is quite a bit going on here in what Stone provides as there otherwise simple American Pale Ale. This is delicious and I wish it was offered in more locations."
"D: Great beer, but nothing way over the top or to get excited about."
"A refreshing beer, and very drinkable if you enjoy hops."
"12oz bottle. Pours a semi-translucent amber color with a medium sized head. Lots of sticky lacing. Aromas of citrus, predominantly orange, grain and some caramel. Flavors of orange, breadiness and some bitterness. Not too hoppy. Decent Pale Ale. Drinkable but doesn't have those usual characteristics that you will find in most Stone brews."
"Pours a copper color with 3 fingers of tan, fluffy head that fades slowly with chunky lacing. Big floral and citrus hops dominate the aroma with some breadyness in the background. The taste is smooth and almost creamy with a nice, medium body. Slightly sweet up front, then giving way to resinous hop bitterness on the back end leading to a slightly lingering finish. Good balance and drinkability make this a great PA."
"Drinkability -- Yet another ale that blurs the line between APA and IPA. It's actually reminiscent of a well-faded Stone IPA, not to say that this is a bad thing. Certainly one of the better APA's I've had, but I wouldn't put it up against the likes of Daisy Cutter, Alpha King, or even Moon Man."
"Pours a cloudy orange amber with a nice white head. Aroma of earthy citrusy hops, some sweet malt, caramel. Taste is citrusy bitter hops, some sweet bready malt. Palate is medium body, nice carbonation, smooth texture. Finish is citrusy earthy bitterness with some sweet bready caramel maltiness. Overall a very nice, smooth, easy drinking Pale Ale"
"D: Good."
"Poured from bottle - wonderful head that stayed for a while - smells of brown sugar and caramel - taste similar - not at all bitter - good balance - left me wanting more - color was a great dark amber. Too bad the brewery is across the country from where I live - I'd love to visit it someday."
"Notes: Not as bold as the other stone brews which is nice. Good to see that not every brew needs to push the limits."
"D-A good APA. Very easy drinking. I would readily drink this again. This would make a good introduction to craft beer for the BMC crowd. Well done Stone."
"A pretty drinkable pale ale here. I expected perhaps a bit more of an extreme hoppy pale ale and came away with a beer that was a bit more restrained with decent balance. I'll take this one."
"Overall: Very tasty, Good APA. Would buy again."
"This is a drinkable beer. It doesn't have an overwhelming flavor profile that will knock you out, and it goes down smooth enough to put a few back pleasantly."
"There's some lacing down the glass."
"This is a very good beer. It has the perfect balance between flavor and smoothness. I really like this one."
"A bit of carbonation but very much a sessionable Pale Ale. More enjoyable that SN, no doubt."
"overall, i'd buy this beer again, i have no complaints about it..a solid choice for any night of the week"
"Pours a cloudy brownish oranage with cap of white head, good retention and lacing. Scent is of west coast hops (grapefruit and citrus) and a somewhat unexpectedly large whiff of carmel malts. Taste is forward of the sweet carmel matls with the muted hop profile bringing up he rear. Makes me wonder how fresh this bottle is. Medium bodied, lighter than normal carbonation. A good beer, but not as light, crisp and refreshing as other West Coast Pale Ales, definitely more malt forward."
"Drinks: not how I expected. A good alternative when all other choices are BMC, but I need mo' bitter!"
"Mild aroma of yeast and slight malt, pleasant but mellow. Pours a beautiful amber orange with modest off white head that settles to a thin ring. minor lacing. Taste is semi sweet malt with raisin, hops in the background. Finish is dry with a nice little hop bite. A pretty laid back beer for Stone, but I enjoy that about it. One of the better Pale ales out there."
"I'm bias for stone beers. LOVE them. I'm bias for hops, and this doesn't do it. Sorry stone, you missed on this beer. It's a darn good beer, but for an APA and for Stone...this is unacceptable!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. This brew pours a deep amber hue with a centimeter-thick off-white head that settles to a thin film on the surface. Lacing is very sticky and quite attractive. Nose is slightly grainy, with hints of caramel and honey. Hops linger in the backround with floral, fruity character. Flavor of the beer is much like the smell, yet more balanced. Caramel and cereal grains meld with grassy, floral notes. A medium bodied pale with above average flavor and finish. It's certainly sessionable and an excellent example of the style."
"This brew pours a nice light copper hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger cream couloured head and sporadic lacing here and there,the first smell i get is toffee,caramel malts followed up by some spicy,herbal hops,the mouthfeel is just above average and has tastes of toffee malts,maple syrup,marzipan,passionfruit and finishes with a hint of medicinal,herbal hops but the bitterness is nicely counteracted to really leave you with a hop hit without the bitterness,overall a nice drop that really doesnt push any boundaries but would drink again."
"Not something I will reach for in too many situations-- but goes well with standing at the grill!"
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is a great mix of hops and malt. I get a lot of orange and pine along with some caramel malt. The flavor is not as hoppy as the aroma. I get some toffee, earthy hops and orange citrus hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall: Excellent beer. Not what I typically expect from a Pale Ale, or Stone for that matter, but it is a tasty brew. I will be buying more of these in the future. I suggest you do the same."
"It has a very easy drinkability to it but I have to say that when I am looking for another Pale Ale I will probably skip this one and go for something with a little more flavor to it."
"Sure you could drink 'em often, but the taste is a bit too bland to make each sip desirable, and at 5.4 abv there's no reason to stay with this one."
"this is pretty drinkable beer, but there are much better more available pale ales out there. i wouldnt really try hard to seek this out again. ive had this before and it is much better when it is super fresh."
"D: Solid release from Stone. Very drinkable. I think I could have a few of these. Good ale, but Stone has better offerings."
"this is a really great beer!"
"D_Best characteristic of this beer. Good session beer."
"Not overly drinkable for me, surprisingly. I expected this to be just as flavorful as it is but a little easier going down."
"Wonderfully balanced yet complex pale ale. This one picks up where the SNPA classic left off. Possibly the best of the ""regular"" pale ales brewed in the US."
"D: not a bad a bad brew, but this one isn't as good as Stone's other offerings. There is nothing that stands out about this beer."
"D- Very sessionable Pale Ale, nice drinkability with decent balance leaning toward hops on taste and malt on scent."
"D: pretty decent pale ale that was above average on the hop bit which drank very good and was tasty paired with cajun shrimp."
"Drinkability - This is a good beer. A bit on the heavy side for me, but I love the carbonation/head as compared to other Pale Ales. Great flavor that turns bitter at the end."
"This is decent. Though uneventful. This just seems a little thin for the most part. There is nothing wrong here, just did not do it for me. Worth a try, but I have had better pale ales that are locally made at that."
"Overall this is more malt-forward than I remember the bottle being. It's easily the least-hoppy Stone beer I've had and I could see this being a good entry into craft beer. Worth a shot if you're looking for an easy-drinking beer."
"Really nice example of the style. It would be one of my fallbacks if I could get it at home."
"DB- This is a refreshing, flavorful pale ale. The price is pretty good and so is the balance between hops and malt. If the bitterness was toned down ever so slightly this would be in the ranks of SNPA. A great summer six pack or just something to get out of the cooler on the fly."
"D - A good drinkable Pale Ale. Goes down nicely."
"Drinkability: Not Stone's best brew, but a very good one nonetheless. I doubt I would buy this normally ust because of Stone's other great beers, but I certainly could see myself doing so on occasion. This beer also has a character similar to many on-tap beers, so it is probably superb on-tap."
"O: Perfect impression as far as American Pale Ales go ;)"
"D: Easy to drink pale ale, nothing outstanding going on here, but a consistent beer that is easy to drink."
"D - This is a quality Pale, good flavor, nice appearance and very drinkable. Pretty surprised I like this as much as I do."
"Definitely a good tasting beer but not exactly what I look for in a pale ale. Pretty hoppy and certainly a fairly dark color, it tastes good but I'd rather just go for an IPA if I want hops. I did enjoy the aromas and spiciness quite a bit and it was very easy to drink."
"pours a very cloudy copper orangish color with good fluffy white head, good lacing and lively carbonation. fruity piney like hints in the smell, taste is much the same with some bread malt, and lemon hints. pretty dry flavor but very thirst quenching. thin slick texture and a light body. light bitter crisp finish that goes down quick and easy. could probably polish off a case of this without blinking an eye."
"fairly drinkable but nothing impressive jumps out in any area. in all fairness, I did just drink a couple of DIPA's that definitely drown out the subtleties of an APA."
"D- an easy drinking pale ale that can give sierra nevada pale ale a run for its money. this is something that everyone should check out."
"D - I'm a little skeptical of this bottle's freshness. I expect much more from Stone but it's hard when there is no date present. Either way, it still drinks ok for what it is now."
"D - the clean dry taste and slight bitter finish made for an easily downable pint. good just not that special for me."
"Sweet orange and citrus taste with a good amount of light malt and amber flavor. Nice kick of floral/citrus hops come next and lead to a very dry finish. Very well balanced, drinkable and light American Pale Ale despite the perhaps little too dry finish."
"The body is heavy enough to provide a base for the complex flavors but still light enough that it feels easy to drink. Overall, the mouthfeel is very smooth. I really like Stone's beers for their intense bitter hop tastes and complex flavors, but this one in particular is exceptional. It's probably a perfect beer to initiate someone into Stone's other beers because the complexity is packaged in a way that just about anyone could enjoy."
"Drinkability is also good. Stone APA has got drinkability written all over it. Delightful to enjoy anytime of year, whether by the bomber or the case."
"Clear copper-ruby in color, with an off-white head. Aroma is mild hops and sweet malt. Flavor brings bready malt sweetness coupled with a dry, slightly pine & resin bitterness. Quite good - highly sessionable."
"Stone's classic, time-tested Pale Ale is as much a treat as it could be an everyday session beer. Well-chilled, its sparkly carbonation combines with the toasty malt body -- and is the case with most of Stone's products, adds a nice boost of hoppiness to make a smooth drinkable pale ale."
"Nothing too special about this, a standard APA, but worth buying"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy though sufficiently carbonated for a dryish finish. For a fan of balanced, but still very hoppy APAs, this is an excellent session or quaffing beer."
"This brew also has a great malt mixed with superb hop bite, this has great carbonation and may be the perfect session brew."
"Drinkability - A very good Pale Ale."
"D - It's a solid pale ale, for sure. I could drink plenty of this, but I like beers with just a bit more bold flavors."
"D- Almost everything was outstanding to me, except for the most important part; taste. I just don't like the taste sensation of overpowering hops with too little malt counterbalance. Other than that, a great beer."
"D - This is a very nice beer and part of a long line of quality beers I had had from Stone. Right up there with Dale's pale ale as the best American pale ale I have had."
"D- not quite as high as many of their beers, but still decent enough- not the typical pale ale, but then again, Stone wouldn't be the craft juggernauts they are if they brewed simply normal beers"
"Beer pours an amber color with a nice 3 finger head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is a mild blend of malts and floral hops. Taste is well balanced, bready malts greet the palate balanced nicely by a mild grapefruit hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, and very satisfying in the finish. Drinkability is quite good, sessionable at 5.4 abv, tasty yet not overwhelming on the palate. I was shocked when i recently discovered i had not officially reviewed this beer. It has been a favorite PA over the years!"
"12oz brown bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Salem. Pours a crystal-clear amber-red body with a good inch of persistent off-white head. Smells amazing - American C-hops (definitely Cascades) rule, but a good portion of caramel and toffee notes put forth by the malt to balance. Hops hit at first in the flavor, with grapefruit, lemongrass, pith, as malt hits toward the middle in a less obvious way with just enough caramel and toffee to balance, then going back to the hops at the finish with a slightly dry bitterness. Loud and in your face, but balanced and not overwhelming. One of the best APAs I have ever had, though if it were a bit cheaper I'd get it more often. Still good for a treat!"
"It's a pretty tame beer this one. In comparison to most ""American"" style pale ales made in Australia, it's certainly lacking in hop character - it's also lacking in character compared to some of the other American examples I've had. Little Creatures tastes more like an IPA in comparison, for example. But it's drinkable enough. Just not particularly exciting."
"D: Very sessionable APA. No one aspect out of balance, but not what I'd call full flavored."
"Drinkability - Highly drinkable beer. Very balanced full flavor American pale ale. A great anytime beer. I'm really impressed with this because I approached it expecting a hoppy pale ale and instead was met by a balanced, expertly crafted, and quaffable pale ale."
"Finishes thick and fades to dry."
"Poured an attractive amber/copper color with small white head that vanished rather quickly. Not much of an aroma, not very malty and just a bit of hops. Flavor is a bit weak as well. Not much of a malt background and just a little hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is good and beer is very smooth which makes it easy to drink, but I was expecting much more from this beer. Decent."
"Straightforward copper color with a white head. Nice lace on the glass. Smelled malty and slightly fruity, but not much hop aroma at all. Tasted somewhat bland - a bland, non-variety specific sort of bitterness, no perceived caramel background or malt nuttiness. Finished dry and felt medium-bodied. Drinkability was just sort of average. Not a bad beer, but nothing to write home about either."
"Drinkability: Even though it is a bit hoppy, there is still a great balance here, which is a bit of a conundrum. Part of the appeal with Stone's beers is that they are unbalanced monsters daring you to taste them. This is pleasant, but I cannot consider it among their top offerings."
"May not be the most stellar offering, but its still very good, and smooth. Over and over is no problem with this brew regardless."
" I thought I wanted more hops, but I feel like I got exactly what I needed. A very nice beer."
"D: Goes down easily, relatively tasty, an ok representation of the style, though a the malt flavoring outweighed any hop flavoring."
"D - This is a good beer that I think would be better suited to go with some sort of meal than by itself."
"Overall= Nice overall balance of maltiness, a good beer for any time of day!"
"ive had this many times but always eluded to review this. easy drinking, light, but not my favorite Stone offering. I usually go for a few of the others in the main line up."
"Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a thin head. Caramel and orange aromas. A rush of malt and hop flavor when tasted that quickly dissipated. Spicy, peppery, light clove undertones in the flavor. Nice refreshing carbonation that ushers in the pale ale hoppy flavor. Would make a nice session beer."
"Overall I was expecting much more from this beer, especially at $11 per 6 pack. I'd stick to the Stone IPA for that price."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable APA and although it didn't beat out my favorite California Pale Ale, with a few adjustments here and there, it might take the crown. Still, this is damn good beer, which is what I've come to expect from the folks at Stone."
"Cheers!"
"mouthfeel is good, no complaints. this is a drinkable beer that is smooth. can definitely drink a few of these."
"D: This is one fine brew, perfectly balanced. This brew is so good I'm gonna have to add it to my list of usual pick ups."
"Another great brew from Stone... Next Stone step for me is Ruination... and I'm looking forward to it."
"Taste-Subtle citrus, biscuit and caramel malt with a strong hop backbone and underlying hop bitterness throughout. Nicely balanced and drinkable, a more ""subtle, entry-level"" offering from Stone. Good to try before taking the plunge into their more adventurous, and aggressive lineup of brews."
"Taste, a mild pale, not the trademark Stone aggressive hopping. A little thicker than your average pale, more roasted malt I guess. Mouthfeel, remains sessionable, no discernable shifts throughout. Kinda pricey for what you get."
"My last thoughts on this are, if Stone can make a Pale Ale with this much going on, what on earth must Arrogant Bastard taste like?"
"Drinkability - Definitely a session able beer, smooth and no harsh tastes."
"Pours a dark orange amber. Head was light tan, thin, dwindled to a ring relatively quickly. Aroma was rather weak. Picked up light traces of buttery malts. Taste was great though. A mix of hoppy bitterness and biscuit tasting sweet malts. Good body and carbonation. Although the aroma left much to be desired, great taste."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"Nothing special here."
"Flavor follow the aroma pretty close, with a light citrus hop flavor, light sweet malt and biscuit tucked in behind the hops, pretty mild bitterness to the whole beer. Leaves a nice citrus bitterness in the mouth."
"D: Pretty good beer overall. I'd drink it again"
"The feel of this beer is pretty light and goes down well. This was not the best Stone beer I have ever had by any means and it may be one of the lesser beers that Stone makes but overall not bad."
"This has to be my favorite beer of all time! I just love the Stone brewing co. The make great tasting beers. Every Friday I go down to the brewery(wich is 2 miles away from my house lol) and get a fresh brewed 6 pack. The taste is so rich and smooth, the smell is great the color is beautyful. I would recomend anyone that love great tasting pale ales go pick this beer up."
"D - Drinkable though a little heavier than most pales; they're sugary and kind of rich. Don't know if I'd get this again."
"Good golden/amber color, very good aroma (not too hoppy), great flavor also not too hoppy. I'd love to try this on draft."
"Overall, this is a decent beer and a nice offering from Stone. Doesn't particularly stand out though."
"This is my go to beer for a good day of craft beer drinking."
"The taste is sweet and grainy. Similar to the nose with the caramel and roastiness with delicious fruitiness. It's easy on the hops, medium/light bodied with appropriate carbonation which lend this brew to easy drinkability."
"Taste is rich, sweet and sharp. Not too hoppy, but it's got a nice little bite on the finish. Very tame brew from Stone, but real easy to drink. Interesting to compare this to SNPA, very different takes of the same style from two different west coasters."
"D-easy drinking and extremely smooth. well balanced as the flavors meld together in harmony."
"F.T.- All around a great beer but there are Pale Ales just as good for much less $$$."
"D- Very drinkable. Low ABV yet high flavor and character impress. A good dinner desert and one more beer.... This is my first stone beer, as i had previously avoided the CA products in favor of the PNW's finest. I will certainly try more now."
"After visiting San Diego in 2006 and tasting this beer I was hopful that I would be able to get it here in North Texas. Well 3 years later it finally showed up in 6 packs at my local Kroger Marketplace @ $11.35 per. As far as I'm concerned it is well worth it. I have drank 2 Six packs since and think it's some of the best American Pale Ale produced. It pour perfectly and made a very nice off white head that stayed with the glass. The blend of hops and malt were just right for my taste. On Superbowl Sunday I drank the beer with Chicken wings and Sliders the beer complemented the food and was a perfect match. I think this beer would go well many difference dishes and certainly by it's self. Enjoy. FS."
"Notes: One of the classic sessionable beers out there."
"Yellow orange color with a stream of bubbles buffeting the white head. Sticky for an apa. The nose is full of hops, with citric notes leading the way past pale malts and a hint of tropical fruit as well. The flavor could be a little bolder and still fit nicely in the style. Maybe a hint of overcarbonation. The hops emerge a bit as it warms which is a pleasant development. A well balanced and nicely crafted ale in a drinkable style."
"This is probably my favorite of stone's pales. I could have a couple of these and enjoy them at a sitting. Not a favorite, but i would snub my nose at it."
"I could drink a 6 pack probably, its realtively light for a Stone offering and I could call this one sessionable."
"Pours a moderate orange with good head and lacing. The aroma is of some sweet malt and a bit of hops--by far the least hoppy brew that I've had from Stone. The taste is quite similar. Not that pale ales have to be super hoppy to be wonderful, but this is not quite what I expect from Stone. Nothing really stands out too much, making it fairly sessionable, but if I want sessionable Stone, I'll go for Levitation. Overall, nothing really wrong with this one (aside from my very high expectations of Stone), just nothing too good about it either."
"This is a very drinkable beer. The flavors and scents are subdued, but this is still a pleasant APA. I wish the hops were a bit more prevalent."
"Poured a 16 oz bottle into a pint glass and got a nice 2 finger lacing head. Aroma is not overpowering but a nice clean mild hoppy presence. The beer has a nice medium body to it that like all the other aspects of the beer is well balanced. The malt comes through initally but then finishes equally with the hops to give you a real pleasurable beer. Great session beer."
"Value: Fair price for a good pale ale."
"Overall, a very pleasant and enjoyable beer. This beer falls into the trap a lot of brews in this style fall into, being more of an ""IPA lite", rather than just being happy as itself. Perhaps this is to be expected in a beer by Arrogant brewers."
"Overall/notes: Wow... just wow. This is a great beer! It's a shame I haven't found any Stone in Columbia, but when I get back, I'm scouring the town! A great APA."
"Enjoyed at My Place Restaurant in Newtown, CT this one pours a clear light copper color with a very healthy off-white head and great lacing. The aroma offers a mild pine hop with a vague banana nut malt. Very mild but nice. The flavor is also mild but it brings a light citrus bite and crispy bread with some quiet caramel underpinnings. This not a sweet treat of an APA. It's pretty acidic, sort of spicey, a bit dry. I do pick up some more general fruitiness and banana as I get near the end. It's on the aqueous side, fairly carbonated and easy drinking if the taste suits you. It was a little dissapointing to me considering it's from Stone. Not memorable or compelling but certainly an OK option and worth a try."
"D - Well balanced pale ale. Nice and smooth."
"D- when i think of my ideal pale ale/IPA flavors, it always somehow goes back to stone IPA and barrelhouse cumberland pale ale. the dry crisp hoppy sierra nevada-esque ones have their place and time, but these british influenced toffee sweet versions really do it for me. stone pale ale fits that bill and hopefully, will be making a regular appearance from now on."
"Stone Pale Ale is a slightly hazy, lively, reddish light amber ale with a fluffy, waxy, lumpy, yellowish head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a grassy aroma with some light malt. here are notes of bread and pineapple. It's medium-light bodied and lively on the tongue. he finish is crisp and clean. It's well balanced, not very bitter, but quite hoppy. It's bright and fruity with notes of tropical fruit, pineapple and tangerine. It's a refreshing session ale."
"Poured to a nice head that hung around for a little while. Head was tan in color. Ale itself was light brown in color. Had a slight hop smell along with malt and a slight sweet caramel smell. All and all very light. Tasted verylight also. Nothing really overpowering. Just of malt, hops and maybe bread. Had a slight bitter aftertaste and left that dry feeling in the mouth. Felt thin in the mouth. Carbonation was good. I dont think I would like to make a session beer out of this one. To dry for me."
"Body seems a bit thin. It's smooth in in the mouth, light carbonation, and finishes dry. This one's very drinkable, good flavor, but it lacks a little in some other categories. A bit more well-rounded would have made it excellent."
"Pours a clear copper color with a giant tan frothy head. The head is very large with great lacing that lasts. The smell is pungent with bread yeast and hops. The taste is very hearty for a pale ale with bread yeast,sweet malt,citrus and bitter hops. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing very well. This is a flavor filled pale ale that should be tried by all. Cheers."
"This has mild prickliness, and is wetting to the palate. Overall a pretty well balanced PA, and not overly hoppy but enough to keep every sip interesting."
"D: This is a very good session beer, and if I was going to knock back a few of something light and refreshing, this could be a go to brew."
"Beer has a medium body and drinkability is high. There is an acidic finish, I don't want to say bitter, its relatively mild. There is a hint of some nutty character, overall really mild. The acid in the back makes this beer has somewhat of an odd mouthfeel. Overall its a good APA."
"Great drinkability. The balance, again, makes this beer."
"Medium body somewhat creamy. Easy to drink and good to but ill stick with other stone products."
"Light to medium body with medium carbonation. Overall, feels like it may be lacking in body just a little. This still comes out very good and sessionable, but not one of my favorites from Stone."
"Was looking forward to trying this beer. Overall it is a great beer. Would go very well with a piece of white fish or poultry. Very simple and taste very good. I will for sure buy this again and or order it if ever on tap. I definitely recommend trying it. Could almost pass for a lager."
"The look is much better than the overall taste but still a beer worth trying"
"Mouthfeel is a good medium with plenty of carbonation that has a creamy feel."
"It was a $10 6-pack and as I was pouring that 2nd bottle down the drain it felt as if the mostly naked Hellboy-type character silkscreened onto the bottle was staring at me and saying ""sucker""."
"MF&D - good body, ample carbonation. quite drinkable."
"in my opinion, not Stone's best beer, but much better than most other pale ales i've tried to date."
"Overall, unremarkable compared to other APA's and to other Stone beers. Worth a try and I will probably get it again the next time I am looking to get smashed on craft beer, but will probably not drink another one by itself."
"D: Gotta give Stone some credit for their unique take on the classic Pale Ale, but this really didn't resonate with me. The hop combo created an odd overly resin flavor. I'm surprised I finally found a Stone that I didn't like but don't go out of your way to get this one."
"Caramel suggestions throughout entire beer, hops show up to the party to support the good time. A nice example of an APA, but a bit too pricey IMHO. I would rather drink Sierra any day and save $3 on the six pack."
"I Am pretty new to the world of craft beer. Most of my life I have drank the light yellow, watery, fizzy, canned beers that are made in a vat the size of Rhode Island that get berated on this website. I still like cheap watery beer. All I know is I love beer and this is what I want my beer to taste like. Sweet and herbal citrusy with tons of pine up front, balanced beutifully with just the right smack of bitterness. It's plenty hoppy, but not goofy hoppy. It's just great beer flavor. Fantastic drinkablility. I just wish it was two-for-one at the tavern like my light yellow fizzy watery crap. Oh well."
"The beer is smooth, refreshing, with some caramel flavors, some graininess underneath, a touch of taut and citrusy hop to add some zest on the back end. The beer is creamy, a bit oily on the tongue, it has a nice acerbic linger into the finish and the leafy hop dries things up enough to make this interesting. It is a medium bodied beer, and the citrus acerbicness is actually quite nice the way it plays off the grainy malts underneath. This is a nice beer all the way around. I'm suprised I haven't tried it before, but it is the type of beer you see quite often in the cooler but just assume you've had it before. L'Chaim."
"Full and even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Tasty and drinkable, good pale ale."
"Poured a clear, reddish brown with a one finger head that faded to a skin. The aroma was lightly malt, little more. The taste was on the weak side too. There was some citrus and a little sugary sweet, a slightly bitter aftertaste...barely. The feel was light bodied with mild carbonation. Drinkability was very good, session beer. Not what I expected from Stone, more like the offering from a lower tier brewery."
"This beer pours a hazy light amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is a nice balance of malt and hops. There is some nice caramel notes with ample grapefruit, and a little pine. The taste is just as balanced as the aroma with the same profile. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice APA, but nothing spectacular. I could, however, probably session this, and thoroughly enjoy the session."
"A good beer but a bit hoppier than the style average, more IPA-like."
"Poured not so pale, with a rich amber body and a frothy white head, with some retention and a few spots of lace. Restrained aroma of grapefruit, berries and sweet malt is somewhat reminiscent of a dialled back IPA. Nicely balanced taste, with the hops more toned down than you'd expect from Stone. Some good sweet malt, light floral notes and candied grapefruit. Certainly an easy drinker. Medium body and carb."
"Drinkability: a good beer, but rather sweet for my taste, especially in this style. I'm sure this would be great paired with something unctuous like a steak or bacon."
"Taste: The malt is a kind of biscuity. Hops are rather laid back, which is unusual and refreshing to see from a Californian brewer. Medium hop bitterness."
"This is one you can definitely enjoy with a burger at lunch, without feeling too sluggish after. I'm glad this one was kept under 6% instead of making a beefy pale ale like Dale's. Perfect lunchtime hamburger beer."
"Nice malty pale ale. Definitely a session beer."
"D: A damn fine APA. Not the best in the world, but a good choice. If it were local, I'd buy it again."
"This beer pours an amber color with a small head that falls quickly and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is all about the citrus/grapefruit hops. The flavor is a nice mix of the caramel malts and the citrus hops - not overpowered in either respect. The mouthfeel is medium and the drinkability is good."
"D: Very drinkable pale ale. It would make a great session beer."
"Smell of a fresh spring meadow, wet grassy marsh, citrus tones were subdued, as were the hops when tasted. I found an intense bitter shot with a sharp edge followed by very pronounced malt and a long dry finish. Very refreshing, clean drinking, lightly hopped and lighter in body as well, yet everything a Pale Ale should be. This is a good example of where the sum is greater than the parts: mouthfeel and drinkability both score high as it all comes together quite well, simple and understated, wish I bought more!"
"D - Great example of an American Pale Ale."
"A slight roasted malt taste mixed with hops, sweet caramel and it has a hint of spice as well as a grainy or earthy touch to it. Smooth with medium carbonation and very drinkable. While it might not be a very hoppy pale ale or have the ABV punch of other Stone brews, it's still a very good beer overall and I suggest picking up a six pack."
"Very hop forward for a pale ale. Crisp floral citrus hops with lots of lemon peel, grapefruit and a nice caramel malt backbone. The malt presence is pretty prominent for the style as well. Crisp and quaffable with a slight pine dry hoppy finish."
"Drinkability: A lighter pale ale with avg abv, its not a bad beer, deff worth a try"
"Drinkability: Goes down as easy as most pale ales, but is a surefire step down for stone considering it doesn't pack a big punch."
"IMO this is one of the best pale ales I've ever had was expecting a more hoppy offering from stone, but they nailed this one anyhow."
"Drinkability: While not my all time favorite APA, as the bros stated this is stones pay the bills beer. It really is suited for all tastes. Its not a bad one either. As far as pale ales goes this is very balanced and I don't mean that in a bland way. Its not over hopped or too intense. A great overall beer"
"The beer that showed me the light once again brightens up my day! This is a fantastic session beer."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, earthy malt, hops, and slight grain. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale hops, sweet malt, slight smokey flavor, and slight grain. Overall, not a ""hop bomb"" of a pale ale, but instead a rather good blend. The smokey/grain flavor nicely off-sets the dryness of the hops. Better than average APA - worth a try. P. S. - My first ever Stone brew and I'm rather pleased."
"I think I will have to drink a few more of these before I really have a handle on the drinkability of this beer. It's quite good but a bit richer than other pale ales I'm used to. I have an idea once I'm used to it it will be quite drinkable indeed!"
"I liked it, at least as a session beer. It certainly doesn't have the character of other Stone brews, but shows some admirable restraint, and it would be easy to knock a few of these back on a hot, sunny day."
"This is definitely a session beer with lots of taste."
"D- pretty good. Might buy again, but then again I might not. Nothing to complain about, though. To be honest, spending 11$ for 6 of these is hard, when 6 SNPAs is only 9$, but it wasn't money wasted."
"I drank this along with a Smuttynose Shoals Pale Ale as a comparison. Next let me say this is/was the first Stone brew that didn't live up to my expectations. Next to no head retention, and no lacing. Malt was cloying especially when sampled back to back with the shoals. The stone had a kool-aid sweetness to the malt, and was less hoppy then the smutty and didn't balance out as nicely. The stone was all sweetness with no bitterness, maybe an old bottle? Not a typical stone brew. Doesn't live up to the scores here imho, especially when compared directly to other APA's."
"Excellent light-medium bodied Stone! Qua-fable!"
"D: This is a nice, drinkable beer from Stone. Is it their best? No, but it's a solid brew."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Well it's pretty good if not ever so slightly underwhelming. It had a different earthy flavor characteristic with a nice roasted hop bitterness on the finish, it kind of reminded me of Winter Warmers. The appearance was definitely better than allot of APAs Ive had, and one could probably drink 2-3 pints of this tasty brew. I think I would have appreciated a slightly fuller, more slick of a mouthfeel, but overall this beer is drinkable & sessionable. Very tasty. Cheers!"
"D- This is a well balanced brew. Stone has a reputation for massively hopping their beers but this was less hoppy than expected. The sweet malts provided a strong base and the hops were pleasantly bitter. I would have liked a little more hoppiness, but this is an extremely drinkable beer, one that I would gladly session."
"D: This is a Stone that can be enjoyed over and over again. Drink up!"
"Very mild and very easy drinking. Will have again."
"Got to love Stone's bottle, my gf asked if I was drinking the devil's beer. The appearance is red with a nice frothy head. The smell is oakish and hoppy. The taste is rather bitter for a pale ale, but is very smooth drinking. This is a quality beer, great for the style and relatively cheap"
"Poured from bottle into an ale glass. 2+ fingers of slightly tan foam with pretty lacing. Good clear and definitive amber appearance. Smells like you want beer to smell like, malty with hint of hops and vegatable smells. Taste roasted grain and some chocolate undertone. It fills the mouth with flavor and feels full on the tongue it has a nice long finish that is slightly bitter. I first drank it in SD a while back and buy it whenever I find it available."
"A pleasant sweet, roasted malt taste races across the palate followed quickly by a nice balancing of hops finishing with a slightly bitter hoppiness left in mouth. A very balanced beer, the malt lingers while the hops take over, never losing either flavor. A medium body matched with a fair amount of carbonation make this a very good beer, and is one of my favorite to introduce people to craft beer with."
"Drinkability: This is an exceptionally blended APA. The hops and malt just dance with each other. Very sessionable especially for the style. This is one of Stone's better offerings."
"This one pours an orange copper color that is closer to what you'd expect from a red ale. A half inch of white head. Smells of malt and a hint of citrus. Tastes primarily of malt with a moderate does of citrus in there. Leans closer to a red ale in flavor, but that's not a bad thing, and the flavor gets better as it warms up. Carbonation is just right, and this is very drinkable."
"A solid Pale Ale but nothing extraordinary. Well balanced."
"D - This is a great pale ale, one of the most flavorful brews of this style that I've ever tried."
"single from Westover Market, Arlington, VA"
"D- All in all another good brew by Stone, but nothing too special...still beats the hell out of most of the APA's out there..."
"This is a very drinkable, very balanced pale ale. One of the better ones that I have had."
"Drinkability: I just grabbed this out of the fridge after cutting the lawn and I'm glad I did. I've never bought this before because I've always gone for Stone's ""bigger"" offerings. This is a great beer for what it is, and it doesnt try to be anything else. A real nice APA."
"D: Overall, great beer to drink... and have a lot of."
"Recommended"
"D - Well-balanced with some nice flavors going on. I'm generally not too huge on pale ales, but this is a solid offering, and could definitely make for a nice session beer. Probably the mildest of the Stone brews that I've tried, but another good one nonetheless."
"Drinkability: Easily sessionable as the alcohol is mild and doesn't feel too heavy. Great with a light BBQ or simply having a few, just not something I would open on a special occasion as the hops just aren't strong enough to be my cup of tea."
"D. Overall not my cup of tea, or ale in this case. Not really bad, but was expecting a lot more from this beer. May buy one more down the road to see if this was a old batch, but would much rather have a Dales Pale, SNPA or many other PA's before this one."
"Have had this on many occassions but most recently at the Flying Saucer Houston. Review from notes taken. Poured into a pint glass. Appears a orange-brown color with a thick white head. Very fruity in the aroma with lots of citrus combined with caramel, toffee, and other frutis I cant tell - all mixed together. Starts of with malty sweetnes and ends with a nice hoppy bitter finish. Awesome Pale Ale."
"A recommended simple pale ale that's well constructed and smooth."
"Had this in a bottle at Grech's Millbrook Inn in Pond Eddy, NY. Not too much head. Smell was fairly light with caramel notes. Tasted similar, almost gingery but light and watery. Very lightly hopped. Decent ale, would make a good session beer, not overwhelming."
"easy drinking. a good session beer for those that prefer a dry pale ale."
"Pours coppery with a good, fluffy head and decent lacing. The aroma is, if anything, woody, like the freshly cut branch of a sapling. There's a little pale malt in there with some earthy, grassy hops. The flavor is similar, bready and slightly woody, with floral and earthy hops. The one thing that is unmistakably Stone is the sharp bitter bite at the end that speaks of the brewery's strong touch with the hops. The mouthfeel is robust and thick, though not viscous in the least."
"Could drink it for a while - delicious stuff. This and their IPA are my go to beers!"
"Great Beer Stone!!!"
"An excellent beer. A staple for pale ales for sure."
"D: A very good pale ale indeed. I would definitely buy this beer again, most likely in a six pack instead of a single. Give it a try."
"There's not much to take away from this one's drink ability; it certainly ought to be tried."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours amber with a hint of orange, nice thick head of foam. This beer has a nice nose, and a very interesting taste, a great balance between the sweet and bitter. A lot of Pales make the mistake and have way too much of a malt taste, but not this, just enough. All in all a great, I strongly recommend this beer."
"Overall, a wonderful beer that I'll definately go back to."
"taste is of oats, malt, grain, some caramel, a little bit of cheerios, earth, and roasted nuts, ends a little dry and a little bitter."
"Purchased from Ray's Liquors in Wauwatosa, WI. Poured bright orange with a thin white head. I detected a faint hop aroma. Light-bodied, smooth mouthfeel, with a slightly dry finish. I tasted a very mild sweetness and small hop aftertaste. This is a well balanced beer and I could drink 2 or 3 in a row. Not my favorite pale ale, but one I might buy again."
"Great beer. Servered from a tap into a pint glass. Poured a deep amber color with small head and decent lacing. Strong citrus hops smell. Very well balanced beer, great hop taste, very smooth with medium body. Great overall beer. One of my all time favorites."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Beer Stop for around $2. Poured into a standard shaker glass, the ale appears a clear medium amber color with about a finger of bone white foam. Smells and tastes of grassy and citrusy hops (orange, lemon), followed by lightly toasted grains, and spicy caramel malt. Medium in both body and carbonation with a crisp finish. A decent ""go to"" pale ale."
"D: it is a good meaty American APA. I am so used to a chock full hop brews from Stone Brewing, this is a nice and tasty change"
"Drinkability - Great everyday beer. I'll add it to the rotation."
"The abv is ok for the style, unfortunately the price is more than SNPA and even more than Torpedo in most stores. As a result, I'm going to have to go with Torpedo as the better beer unless I'm in a session drinking sitation."
"-Bye"
"Pumpkin colored. Amazing frothy head. I would have expected more hops out of this beer, but it's really mild and subdued. Empahsis on the malt. Toasted caramel with floral hops. Toffee, brown sugar, and orange all in one. I have a hard time believing this is from California... there's actually malt in this one!"
"Pours a light amber with a dense white head. Good lacing down the glass. A nice grassy hop aroma, also some sweet malt aromas. Mostly hops up front, both grassy and citrus hop flavors. There is also a nice sweet malt flavor that comes through. Not as strong in the hops as an IPA, nicely balanced with the malt. There is a good bitterness to the finish and it lingers for a while. Good drinkability."
"This is a decent beer that accentuates its maltiness rather any significant hop character. Had a pint of this tonight at a local pizza joint, but this isn't my first time. It's pretty OK and not too memorable. I liked its dark amber color and moderately malty and hoppy smell. The taste is mild at most and characterized by its sweet malt profile. As far as pale ales go, I've had better that offer a richer drinking experience: Sierra Nevada comes to mind. Still, an above average beer that doesn't really stand out but will suffice when options are limited."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. It would be a pleasure to have a few of these."
"D - This is all I drink at Padre games, just wanted to see how it was in bottle."
"I like this beer, and I think it's a choice pale ale, but coming from Stone, I'd expect something bolder, hoppier, and/or more ass-kicking. But this came with so much sweetness I'm thinking the gargoyle on the bottle needs a tutu and a training bra."
"Drinkability - Solid in this department for sure. The well-balanced nature lends itself to easy drinking, and the moderate ABV makes it borderline sessionable."
"Poured a nice copper/red with three finger head, nice retention and lacing. Smells of malts mostly with citrus overtones. Same goes for taste. Citrusy with a malty flavor with hops being on the backburner for this one. Very smooth and light for a Stone brew, carbonation is a bit heavy for me, but its not bad. Easily could be a session brew."
"Had this on tap with BBQ. nice look, with a good head, smell was decent. Taste was crisp, with some hops and a hint of fruit, malty. Very good mouth feel, does not leave a cotton mouth feel, not too filling, good with food. This beer is deceptive as it can creep up on you in terms of alcohol, First beer I liked from this brewery, which is good, cause I like to support CA brews."
"This beer poured a cloudy red-tinged copper color with a massive fluffy three-finger head. The smell is some caramel malt with some fragrant floral and leafy hops. The taste starts off with some toffee/caramel malt sweetness that gradually fades into some well-balanced hops with some floral and slightly piney and well as citrusy character. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and oily with some subdued carbonation. This is a surprisingly drinkable beer for the amount of hops it uses, a testament to the ability of a good beer to balance out the hops and the malt. A great example of the style and a must-try for anyone interested in it."
"Good pale, not over hopped and nicely balanced."
"D - This is a big difference from Ruination...I really enjoyed the malt dominance in this pale ale...another great Stone brew"
"D- Overall a nice working man brew from a killer brewing company."
"Beer is very enjoyable, i tuned my brain to 'hops' this trip and hven't been disappointed so far."
"I'm almost tired of giving Stone constant validation for making kick-ass beer; that's just something I've come to expect of them. I think their Pale Ale speaks volumes for the brewery which promotes itself on making big and bold products. The fact that they can still offer something mild and balanced proves the brewer is just as talented as he is arrogant."
"Heavy balanced flavors with nice lightness. Low ABV means I can drink lots of these. Unobtrusive. No ""extreme"" flavors to clash with."
"D - Lots of malts and a tease of hop to make this easy to kick back a few ."
"Pours a reddish brown color. Creamy gray-whitish head, good lacing and seems to last. Very mild aroma, some nuttiness. Maybe some dark grapes. Fizzy, smooth not creamy. Some nutiness, some balance. Some dustiness. Mild. Some kind of fruit in tne taste, but not dark fruit. I guess I was expecting more hoppiness."
"Pours a burnt orange color with a finger of off white head. The aroma was of floral hops, but it was not too strong. The taste started off with a malty sweetness which was in great balance with the hops. Had a slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp. Very easy drinking well balanced pale ale. A great session beer, imo."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a dark amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is OK, lacing is good. The aroma is very nice, it smells like bready malt, citrusy (orange) and grassy hops, and also a bit of caramel. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like citrusy hops (grapefruit and orange peel), bready malt and some piney hops. Good mix of malt and hops in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, I think this would be a good choice as a session beer as I think it's a good overall brew. It has plenty of taste and it's not too high in ABV so you can enjoy a few of these. I'd definitely buy this again, it's a good, quality classic beer."
"Overall - good but I dont think it compares to Sierra Nevada in this category. Fairly drinkable though."
"Hazy Red-Amber color with lots of bubbles, off white head with low retention. Nose smells of fruity- citrus hops with orange and light floral notes. Tastes of citrusy hops with sweet malty background. Light-medium mouthfeel with fairly high carbonation. Another beer I couldn't have more than a few of, given the high carbonation."
"I have a noticably fresher sample. Look and aroma are about the same but I can detect more of a flavorful hop presense. Nothing outrageous but it does blend better with the malt. The feel definitely has more carbonation, perhaps a perfect amount, not too fizzy or soft. Drinks very nice, good balance."
"I was not let down by Stone's version of a Pale Ale. This was excellent and very drinkable. I was expecting it to have too much of one flavor but didn't. Definitely worth the money. This is something I will drink again in the near future."
"D: This is a pretty tasty APA, and it's incredibly well-balanced. Surprisingly so for a Stone offering, in fact. I'm impressed, but not blown away. Still, I'd be happy to drink this anytime."
"Overall is a good, light, highly drinkable APA. Would recommend to people just getting into beers with generous amounts of hops"
"Poured fresh growler into a pint glass. A dark amber color with a nice white head transferred into a smaller form. Killer lacing. Smells of sweet malt are noticed first, followed by some of that W.C. hops. Gulp. Very mild and sweet on the intake, frothy as well. Little thickness makes for some great aftertaste. Drinkability is favorable for a pale ale. The combination of the maltiness and the hops are perfectly portioned, embracing for those who find hoppy beer overwhelming. This is a stellar sunshine beer in my opinion. Stone never disappoints and for that this one comes recommended."
"I'd say this is a pretty solid Pale Ale overall, though there are of course better ones out there. At around the same price for a six pack I'd just as well go with their IPA though."
"Cheers!!!"
"D-	Off the chart. This is a great beer and you could easily drink this all night. I must admit I have a cult-like devotion to the Stone Brewery. I love their beers and this is no exception."
"A little pricey around my way, but a good pale ale."
"Overall, not quite your prototypical pale ale. Dale's Pale Ale is still my favorite, but this is an interesting take on the style that I would not hesitate to drink again."
"Pours a beautiful hazy amber with a small tan head. Smells good, sweeter and more complex than most pale ales: notes of caramel and toasted sweetness, citrusy hops. Taste is very chewy, with multilayered flavors starting with big malts right up front with very vibrant hops kicking in mid-palate and electrifying it, and then a long, oily finish with an evergreen hop profile that makes me think of gin. Very round and balanced. This beer reaffirms Stone's status as one of the best breweries on the West Coast."
"Seems a bit closer to an ESB than a Pale. Nice either way, though."
"Future outlook: Excellent session beer that I would certainly never avoid. Next time heavy, relatively mindless drinking is afoot, this will be a consideration."
"Beer is a beautiful, semitransparent dark amber/copper color with a good finger of off-white head that dissipates slowly, leaving only brief lacing (particularly at the bottom of the glass). I loved the aromas in this beer. Initially sweet malts, balanced out with hops. Taste is similar at first. A long sip featured brief malts at the beginning, ending in bitter, grainy hops. This beer is medium-bodied and smooth on the palate, coating my whole mouth with bitter residues. The only downside for me here was that after the first or second sip, the hops started to take over completely, making the beer more unbalanced and less flavorful towards the end of the glass. Overall, though, this is a strong an ale as I would expect from Stone. I'd easily recommend it."
"This is a very well-crafted and understated beer from Stone and the drinkability is high as there is nothing over-the-top about this one. Nothing groundbreaking but a very good beer."
"D - This is a very easy drinker that won't knock you out with strong flavors or alcohol. Highly recommended as an everyday drinker."
"This is very drinkable for me and makes a good session beer. I'll have another please!"
"D- A nice change of pace beer for me. I've been drinking a lot of SN Celebration and Hopslam, so it was nice to have a beer with less bite."
"Light orange-brown in color, fully transparent, has minimal bubble beads but the average sized head lingers well with a fine lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy but not excessively so, more roast to it than sweet caramel, slips you wheat and grain, not fruity nor spicy, perhaps a trace of lemon peel, relaxed and streamlined rather than aggressive. Light to medium-bodied, same basic profile in the mouth of hops, grains, wheat and bitters. Mild citrus tones. Dry mouth feel with the carbonation equal to the weight of the flavors. Gossamer caramel to coffee hard candy flavors. Succinct finish, doesn't appear short, just ends on a dime."
"D- I could definitely kick back a few of these. Alcohol content isn't too high, a decent brew overall."
"drinkability: not fast, a slow drinking pale ale"
"Not as great as other Stone beers, but not disappointing."
"Drinkability: It was easy to drink, but the flavor wasn't nearly as full as I would have expected. I might try another bottle at some point just to make sure my palate's not off, but my comments seem to be in line with most of the reviews."
"Great drinking APA. One of the better ones that I've had the pleasure of drinking. Due to the balance in the brew and the relatively low ABV, this is a good choice for a session brew."
"Quite a good pale ale, lacked the body I usually think of in a pale ale but still quite drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Pours a clear reddish-copper in color with almost two fingers of creamy, almost pillowy, off-white head with good retention. Good aroma, touch subdued but with a solid citrus hop presence but a fair amount of toasty, bready malt. Taste is fairly good as well. Starts out moderately hoppy with a fair amount of toasty/bready malt and a bit of sweetness. The citrus hop flavor builds and soon overwhelms the malt as a very solid bitterness becomes evident. Clean fermentation character. Lingering hop flavor and bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty good with a light/medium body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. This is a pretty solid APA and would probably go over pretty well with just about anyone."
"Drinkability: Stone knows how to brew beer! Like I said, this is my first Stone and it won't be my last. I've read that their other selections are more kick-in-the-butt hoppy but this one was very nicely balanced and highly drinkable."
"mouthfeel is bitter sweetness, finish is quenching, yum - slick and easy to drink/session"
"Pours a pleasant amber color with a minimal head. Light hop smell with some bread. Taste is much breadier than I thought it would be. Little bit of lemon spice. Minimal malt backbone. Good amount of carbonation in this one as well. Overall, this is a great session beer to sip on, whether at home or at a tailgate."
"a solid beer from stone and quite sessionable"
" Reddish brown pour,with a huge light tan head that slowly went down to a thin ring and stayed till the end. A nice subtle hop aroma,with a hint of roasted malt. The flavor is of hops,malt,and bread dough, with the amount of malt here you would expect it to be sweeter but instead it has just a nice dry hop finish,and I think I detected a slight alcohol taste at the end. Very Good , Will buy again ."
"Not what I was expecting from a Stone Pale Ale. Where's the hops? Definitely slanted towards the malt, and it's easy to see why Sierra Nevada PA is the standard. Decent enough, but it's easy to get lost in the wash of American pale Ale's and this one gets lost in the wash. Not worth the price."
"I have been meaning to try this for some time, but have been prevented by its limited availablility in my area. I understand that this is their ""flagship"" beer, and it is indeed a good one. It exhibits many of the characteristics of their bigger badder siblings in a much more subdued way. This is one that I would recommend to some of my friends new to better beer, or who have not had the opportunity to try a Stone product. I also, would definately buy a case of this to have in the house when not in the mood for Ruination, or a Bastard."
"6/4/6/4/14 (3.4/5)"
"Is it different this time around, or is it the taster? I don't know, but there seems to be a lot more of everything in this beer than I remember. Very nice, and I hope what I taste this evening is what I taste next time."
"Very balanced and light on the palate, I would highly recommend this beer. One of the top APA's that I have tasted."
"D: very drinkable beer, solid pale ale, and very enjoyable. I could put a lot of this back."
"Very drinkable."
"The aroma is malty with caramel, cereal, and citrus hops. The appearance is amber with a foamy head. The flavor is bitter but balanced with caramel. The palate is smooth but not thick. Overall its a good session beer without being a tremendous beer. Still a good solid drinking beer any day."
"D: easy to drink, but the flavors for me aren't preferable, they are just average and interesting so i wouldn't have drank much more than the one i had"
"I like Pale Ale, and I like this beer. Pours clear copper with a medium white head. Cascade hop and crystal malt aroma, with some caramel. Exactly what you would expect from the taste, more hops and malt than the others, with a tart aftertaste. This can be inconsistent; sometimes being a bit tangy and others sweet."
"Very drinkable. Very enjoyable. I would definitely have this again. Might be a very good beer to provide as an intro to the Craft Beer world, and I don't mean that to slight this beer. I really enjoyed it."
"Smells great, lots of light fruity, flowery aroma. Pours a copper/amber with a bubbly head. Taste reminds me a lot of Sierra Nevada's brew. Lots of light fruit, citrus, apricot, some peach. Lots of malt, only a bit of hops. Very good stuff here."
"Weird to come away from a Stone beer and not be blown away, but I've had better pale ales, although there's hardly anything to feel let down about either."
"Crisp, light and smooth mouthfeel. Drinkable enough, though I might not want several. Good beer, all around."
"D: Enjoyable. Perfect for having with a meal in the afternoon as a preamble to some heavier stuff waiting in the wings."
"Overall this is a fine pale ale. However, I don't see myself drinking it a lot, because of its high price here in Florida: $11 a six-pack. I'd rather spend my money on Stone's exceptional beers."
"Stone Pale Ale pours a reddish copper with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is nice if not particularly aggresive, caramel malt and floral hops are evident. There is a toasted malt quality to the flavor which is balanced nicely with the hops."
"First time I've seen this in Oregon. As a big fan of Pale Ales I had to try this one. Pours full amber with a modest off-white head. Minimal lacings. Aroma is quite bold caramel and floral hops. This is a restrained PA from a company best known for their big hop beers. Actually I think the hops seem less bold because of the large amount of tasty malts in this brew. Anyway I appreciate the balance of this beer. Thanks Stone for making a well rounded very drinkable APA. I just wish it's price was closer to Deschutes Mirror Pond. Ah well there is shipping and distance to big added. I live about 120 miles from Bend and more like 1000 mi. to Escondido. The town which was the butt of Fred Sanford's jokes on many occassions."
"D - Very high. The price is the only thing keeping this beer out of the mainstream."
"Very drinkable beer that needs to sit for a few minutes to be appreciated. I would definitely buy this regularly if it were a little cheaper, but at what I paid for it, I'll be sticking to Laughing Dog as my regular go-to pale ale."
"D: Very much. I like the way Stone has interpreted this style, especially since it is so misinterpreted in the United States."
"Appears a ruddy copper colour, with two fingers of pock-marked white head, which disappears fairly quickly, leaving a bit of lacing. The smell is of slightly grainy malt. The taste is cereal grain malt, with a light pine hop essence. There is an above-average amount of carbonation, and a dry, quick finish. This is the mildest product from Stone that I've had, and is very easy to drink. It is still full-bodied, and sessionable, I would imagine."
"What's this, a basic pale ale by Stone? Well knowing this would be good based on never having a mediocre brew from these guys I didn't hesitate on getting this one. Anything but basic this APA excells all of my expectations. Aroma is incredibly malty well backed by some calm hops. Beautiful pour rich color, large head that sticks around, and thick lacing. The huge malt is easily felt, this is thick and full for this style. Fantastic taste still can't believe how malty this one is. The hops are very mellow well received although not expected considering this brewers appetite for extremes. All around great brew, very drinkable could make a wonderful session beer."
"Nice offering from Stone. Not my favorite but still a great beer. It seems clear that they pulled back a bit on the hops for this one, perhaps trying to appeal to larger audience? Overall the balance is still very good with a great hop highlight. Cheers to Stone!"
"Carbonation was good. It was a solid beer, not as special as other stone offerings. Maybe this was lowered a little though due to higher expectations of stone beers. I would drink this one again but there would be a lot more in front of it."
"Pours a beautiful clear amber with a frothy and not too persistent head. Aroma is strong and has a nice balance of malt and hops, leaning towards malt. Flavor is surprisingly hoppy, but not quite like an IPA - malt and hops contribute equally to the flavor, and hop bitterness is minimal. Texture is smooth and delightful."
"Drinkability- Easily one of the best APA's Ive ever had, totally refreshing. I don't often go for APA's but this one is worth a revisit!"
"Stone comes to Maine. In a pint glass, this beer was an amber color, with an off-white head, and a fair amount of lacing. It had a floral aroma. Nice piney taste, with a bit of a malt presence. Assertive without being intrusive. Nice drinkable beer, will buy more of these."
"This would be a great session beer. Also, a pretty good gateway beer because of the more subtle flavors. This will become a regular."
"Golden pale color from the tap. Served in apint glass with a small white frothy head. Tastes of a faint caramel sweetness. Does have some mild hops but not bitter. A bit thin on the backbone. Kind of bland but went very well with pizza. Would be a great choice as a session beer with most any meal."
"Yet another friggin' great beer from Stone. This is a well-balanced, session oriented type brew."
"Very tasty, smells nice, but needs some work in the appearance and mouthfeel arenas."
" ~ This is a very good beer and one that I wish was readily available in Central Wisconsin. It is nice to see this brewery has made it's way into the state even though I need to travel almost three hours to get a six pack. I will certainly recommend this beer to my friends. I'll also make sure they get their own because this sixer is mine!"
"D - Great beer. This is one of the best Pale Ales i've had."
"Pours a nice dark nutty color with very little head. Smells delicious, like a tasty beer. Maybe a hint of cloves. It has a long, strong hoppy finish. I could drink a few of these without complaining."
"Stone makes some good beer and their Pale Ale is no exception. There's an enjoyable toastiness with a bright enough hop presence to keep this beer flowing. Thanks for the sample Justin!"
"D. This is a good session beer, always nice to throw this back and always willing"
"had it again a year later with a bottle i had saved. stored fantastically. the malt really came out. and the nose had hints of pineapple, plum and watermelon even. simple, very low alcohol, but quite broad for the form."
"On the hefty side of medium-bodied with mild carbonation, Stone's Pale Ale is a fine version of the style and extremely drinkable."
"Nice and crisp, but a bit watery. Medium amount of carbonation. This is a good session brew. Very good APA that I will visit again."
"Pours orange amber with a fairly short head that fades quickly to almost nothing. Smells a bit of juicyfruit, light citrus, wax, and some sweet malt. Taste is similar. Quite juicy and with quite a bit of malt. Lack the graininess that is sometimes found in pale ales. Fairly lightly hopped, and the sweet malt more than balances against the light citrusy hops. Smooth and easily drinkable."
"Notes: No let down here. Not at their best here,but simply well done."
"D: This is a good example of a pale ale. Not my favorite style of beer, but this one's worth trying."
"Definitely not Stone's best but it is a drinkable pale ale and among their most sessionable selections."
"Deep copper amber in color with a medium head that fades somewhat quickly, leaving some lacing down the glass. Good smell that is leaning more toward the malt than anything. Not something I expected from a Stone beer. Toasted caramel, toffee, and a subtle fruit lingering in the nose. Some citrusy hops are present but in no way overpower the malt. Upon the first taste, it seems to be the same old story. Toasted caramel, brown sugar, toffee. A light toasted bread and grain. Fruit is still present. The hops come through a little stronger than the nose may have suggested, though not until you get toward the finish. They provide a solid bitterness and good balance to this brew. Mouthfeel is good but and balanced as well. Never too sweet or too bitter, just in between the two. Could have used a touch more carbonation but otherwise a nice feel to it. Just a bit too full textured to consider it a sessionable Pale Ale. Two pints would be my limit. Big on the flavor and on the malt. I enjoyed this one but not enough to return to it often."
"Drinkability: Great, love it."
"The beer had a nice amber appearance with a great cream head. Smell was slightly fruity, but with a distinct hopsy sense to it. Something was a little off for me but not a bad smell. Whatever reservations I had about to smell were put to bed by the taste. The beer has a great taste. Stone Pale Ale is a quality pale ale."
"Man I love Stone! Pours a beautiful amber with a gorgeous creamy head. Nose is fruity and sweet. Tastes like Stone. What can I say? It just tastes great - PERFECT balance. Probably the least aggressive Stone I've had - a little more accessible to multiple bottles in one sitting. I may like more carbonation, but the beer is great either way. This and Sierra Nevada are my favorite Pale Ales, no doubt."
"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy orangey color ale with an average foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of Cascade hops with some caramel malt also discernable. Taste is a mix between some caramel malt with some dominating Cascade hops which provide a citrusy and bitter taste. Full body with some average carbonation. Good but drinkability good have been better - too full too be a session beer and too light in terms of hops to be truly interesting."
"D- Given the 5.4% ABV and the fact that the bitterness isn't over-the-top for the style, this is a highly sessionable beer."
"D - One of the best session beers I can think of. Extremely well balanced. Not too weak, not too intense."
"Served a crisp amber with a nice frothy head that slowly diminished to thin layer and left great lacing. The aroma was some Earthy citrus hops and sweet malts. The taste was a decent balance of sweet malts and crisp citrus hops. The beer was light, crisp, and very refreshing with decent carbonation. This one would certainly make a wonderful session beer."
"D- Drinks good by itself and compliments foods like pizza very well."
"Stone Pale Ale pours a slightly hazy dark amber color with a nice amount of foam that leaving generous lacing. Aroma of biscuity malt backed up by some floral hops. Bitter at first, but not tongue trashingly so, a nice amount of piney hops and thens oem grapefruit-citrus flavor. Caramel malts pop up along with some bready, biscuit like malt and incredibly dry on the finish. Smooth, goes down easy. A definite session pale ale. Top of it's class and right up there with Sierra Nevada for the industry standard APA."
"Poured a nice yellow with a thin white head. Nose was malty, with a mix of English malts and american hops. Taste was a very fresh and floral tasting pale ale. Nice malty presence, English malts were tart,sweet and itter not overwhelming like Dales Pale Ale. A good tasting Pale."
"Not complex or extreme (not its purpose), but extremely drinkable and well balanced, a great session beer. Very well done."
"Stone is fast becoming yet another one of my favourite breweries. They really seem to know what they're doing when it comes to producing the amber nectar. This one is no exception. A fine-looking beer with a good head that gives off plenty of citrus notes plus a hint of bready yeastiness. A nice balance on the tongue which won't scare off those who don't like anything too bitter, but there's a very nice hoppy finish as it slides down the back of the throat. It would be very easy to knock these back all night."
"Medium bodied; the hops give this one a strong ruby-red grapefruit flavor, with a hint of malt to balance it out. Leaves thick, sticky lacing as you drink. Good mouthfeel. Quite balanced and tasty. Not the boldest of beers, but execution is exceptional."
"Poured with a nice frothy, textured head and lots of lace. Nice amber color. Mild hop with some malt nose. Hop flavor is remarkably muted. Not bad, but nothing special. A surprise. Was expecting a lot more from the Stone. Balanced, clean pleasant finish."
"Very drinkable, although it doesn't hold up as it warms. Better than most pale ales I've tried. It's similar to a lot of others, but the execution is a step above."
"Picked this one up at Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, VA. Copper/amber color with an off-white head that sticks around and some really nice lacing. Aroma is citrus and some floral hops, not strong but decent. Caramel malty flavor, a little bit grainy, floral with a citrus hop bite. Very well balanced. A solid beer but I expect nothing less from Stone."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a small beige head. Aroma is very hoppy with grapefruit, floral as well as mild sweetness. Flavor is peach, grapefruit, caramel andlight cocoa. Finishes abruptly and nicely bitter. Medium bodied, chewy texture. A more normally bittered beer from Stone."
"D: Definitely drinkable, not at the absolute top of my pale ale chart but solid nonetheless."
"This kind of reminds me of a homebrew that would benefit from a bit more aging. I love hops, but this interpretation of a pale is arguably has just a bit too much hop bitterness. Still, a very solid pale ale, very rich, and with a reasonable ABV of 5.4%, I could easily have a few of these without being overwhelmed."
"""California, knows how to party"" - Tupac Shakur. From San Diego comes the consistently amazing Stone Brewing Company (makers of Arrogant Bastard Ale). Almost as brown as the bottle, this American Pale Ale is anything but pale. Nice head fades into a delicate lacing. Subtle aroma (hints of citrus) but medium bodied and filling in the mouth. Refreshing, crisp, not overly hopped, smooth with a dry finish. Very well balanced. Novices and sybarites alike will enjoy it."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable - light enough for a hot day, character enough for any casual drinking. Not an especially unique beer, but a very well-made example of a American-styled Pale Ale."
"Overall: You'll be sorry if you buy only one bottle."
"Had a bottle 3 months shy of it's best by date. Strongly bitter flavor in a grapefruit rind kind of way with hints of Arrogant Bastard in the finish. Not balanced enough to be sessionable - quite aggressive! Enjoyable still. Would give it a 4.25 as a ""had""."
"Great hop flavor without encroaching on an IPA in terms of bitterness, like some pale ales do. Great malt profile to boot."
"Until now, I had only had big beers from Stone, so I was surprised at how subdued the hops are in this pale ale. It is pretty simple, but very drinkable."
"Very quaffable."
"Overall, Stone Pale Ale is another solid beer from this outstanding brewery. Recommended."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. Nice balance and body to it, complex without being off the charts. A terrific session beer. It was a little darker and thicker than I expected for a pale ale, but it still worked quite well."
"Standard sessionable Pale ale, very drinkable and will seek out as standard."
"Bold flavor, very malty and bready, dried citrus rind/peels, moderately full-bodied. Spicy hop finish, adds an element of complexity, along with a tea-like quality. Dry, somewhat bitter finish that kept me going back for another sip. Very balanced and integrated flavors. Pretty enjoyable and session worthy."
"The taste: Nice malty mouthfeel then the hops come and spice up the finish. This beer has more malt and mouthfeel than fat tire and they call that a amber ale? Cheers to Stone even if this is there bottom of the line entry level beer this just shows there runt is better than most brews best offering."
"O: Very, very good beer. The hoppiness of the beer gives it a great character and is very enjoyable to drink. Definitely one of my favorite beers."
"This one was even better than I was expecting. Poured a reddish colour with an eggshell coloured head; reminded me of Hopdevil, actually. Smell was nice with a candy sweetness and an equal measure of floral hops. Taste was terrific due to the fact that the hops were turned down quite a bit. They were there and certainly noticeable, but not quite so ""in your face"" over the top as seems to be the way any micro pale ale is these days. This was a very flavourful pale ale with a pleasant smell and easy to drink. What more do you need? Mouthfeel was very smooth and about the weight I would expect considering the style. Dazzlingly drinkable! I can't wait for Stone to be available in Ga. This will be a frequent purchase. Delicious and not quite so assertive. Wonderful!"
"I can do a couple of these and that's it. Tough food match too. A sold, well built beer, but has some oddities. Nothing bad -- strong recommendation, but not the polished product you'd expect."
"Poured a pretty amber orange with a huge frothy tan head. There isn't that much carbonation clinging to the glass. Some nice lacing is beginning to develop. The aroma is slightly sweet, fruity and quite malty. Same goes for the taste. The hops certainly take the back seat in this stone ale. Its certainly not a very complex brew but its nice. I could see it being a good session brew. The feel is slick and moderate. Very drinkable but may get boring after a few."
""
"D. Very good here. The ABV is appropriate for sessions and this is indeed a beer worth seeking out."
"good beer to quaff all night long"
"Drinkability is high-often gets lost for me when presented with a bigger Stone beer-however, a very solid beer."
"overall, an exceptionally enjoyable beer. the arrogant bastard (which i love) is enjoyable in a challenging sense, like climbing up a mountain. the pale ale is enjoyable like spending a day at the beach. delicious."
"d: pretty mild for a west coast pale; real euro in terms of hops and flavor intensity"
"D: Drinks well, but It's almost too sweet to have too much of. The alcohol is a little high, but bearable. I can't see myself drinking too many of these, but it's still pretty good, and I'll buy it again."
"This one is drinkable, despite that metallic taste, and at 5.4 % ABV it qualifies as a session ale. I expected more from Stone as this is the flagship, but it is worth trying."
"Nice malt sweetness, quite balanced given Stone's usual MO when it comes to hops. Might mark the taste down a bit but the drinkability up."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied with excellent carbonation. A drinkable pale ale but not my favorite and definitely the weakest offering I have had from Stone."
"This may be a sin, but I think this one is better at fridge temp than at cellar temp."
"D: Drinkability is damm good and tasty and really enjoyed this one. A great sweet-n-spicy drink that is case worthy by all means and one I could enjoy all night."
"D- Not a great/must have beer, but could be a session beer depending on the occasion."
"I liked it. Not my favorite as I tend more towards IPAs, but this is a good brew for friends who aren't the hop-head I am. I love Stone bottles. I don't know if you'll find it in my fridge all the time, but every so often, I'll grab a sixer when I'm in the mood."
"Recommend, especially when grilling. A bit sweet for a stand alone session brew."
"Notes: not one of my favorite styles, but this is a nice one none the less and pretty drinkable. Stone never lets me down."
"D- Another great brew from Stone. Easy to drink Pale Ale."
"Overall: A wonderful beer. One of my favorite session ales that I can find at most of my local liquor stores. Also a great introductory craft beer for your friends and family."
"D - Drinkable. No more, no less."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a nonic. Pours a deep copper color with some haze. Their is a small head that disappears quickly with some slight lacing. Smells very malty with a heavy does of spice and some hops. The beer starts with a malt taste then quickly goes over to the hops and spice and finishes dry. Their is moderate carbonation in the beer and leaves an oily coating on the tongue. This is nice pale that I could drink all night."
"Stone still doesn't seize to amaze me with their products. This is probably my new favorite pale ale. Everything seems to be moderate and perfected. Love this brew."
"D - A perfect session beer... Kudos to Stone and an exceptionally well crafted Pale Ale..."
"drinkabilty: at 5.4% alc this brew is easily sessionable. would go great with a burger. another great brew from stone that i feel is greatly overlooked."
"D: Very good beer and highly hopped. Love to drink these."
"Clear copper color with a slight head. Pale malt aroma with a trace of hops. Nice balanced malt/hop profile with some nice, juicy hop notes tingeing the taste buds. Nice flavor. A toned down version of their IPA, but retaining the hop flavors in a more nuanced presentation. Highly sessionable. A good beer. Cheers."
"This staple beer poured a hazy light brown with tan head. It smelled like a good mix of mild pine hops and malt. Its flavor was a nice, smooth blend of caramel malt and mild copper hops. It was watery with slight carbonation and a mild, clean bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very mellow, drinkable, and clean drink combining for a great pale ale."
"Overall: well crafted pale ale, great balance of toasted maltiness and fresh hoppiness. I initially thought this beer was going to be a little on the hoppy/bitter side (Stone beers tend to be hop bombs), but alas this pale ale is quite remarkably balanced."
"Smell is of malts and light hoppyness - slight citrus. Taste is hoppy, with again, a light piney/citrus taste. Bubbles are present but not obnoxious. Well balanced and great finish. Very drinkable. This beer is one of my favorites and I was shocked that I had never reviewed it."
"D: A good sessionable pale... nothing too fancy going on here.. just a solid brew.."
"Very strong flavors and mouthfeel. Full and tasty. Lots of drinkability in this one!"
"Pours a light cinnamon brown with an amazing 3 finger light tan head. Smells like like sweet dough and floral hops. Taste is a shock for such a small beer. First tastes like peaches in a caramel glaze with brown sugar mixed in. Follows with nice hops and a grainy finish. Very impressive. Mouthfeel is oh so smoth with a great balance of malt and carbination. Drinkability is a very good. Definately would drink a six of this with NO problem. Stone does it again!!"
"Brilliant orange color with a fluffy tan head. Nice sticky lacing forms rings on the glass as the beer slowly dwindles. Surprisingly un-hoppy for a Stone beer, both in nose and flavor. Malt is toasty, caramely, and well balanced against the citrus hops. Unexpected but welcome restraint. Extremely easy to drink due to its low alcohol, smooth mouthfeel, and balance."
"Definitely drinkable and would recommend."
"My favorite APA, my standby fall back Ale. Great balanced copper colored Pale Ale. This brew pours great with good head retention very drinkable with sweet caramel malts, followed up with a healthy dose of hops and a semi-dry clean finish. Just a great Standard that I use to measure other APA's and always seem to grab for a Stone Pale Ale over most of the other (some times bigger & more flavorful) beers in the fridge."
"Great blue-collar kinda beer. A pretty complex but untamed hop profile makes for an interesting, decidedly west-coast pale ale. Recommended."
"This could easily be my regular drinking beer. There is nothing extreme or special about this, but it is full flavored and complex."
"The Stone Pale Ale poured an amber color with a thin foam head and some occasional lacing. The aromas was a malty caramel which was mmm good. The taste was balanced between the piney hoppiness and the malt finish. In the mouth there was a good bitterness that stayed on the tongue for a good while. Overall a solid pale ale."
"Weak carb, sweet with some citrus character. Weak hop flavor. Caramel is present. Thin in body too. Not really impressed with this one. Can't recommend it. Just an average session ale."
"Pretty good for Stone, not one of their best though."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure if I got an old bottle or what (because it was a single bottle purchase in a mixed 6-pack in a store), but this just isn't good. It doesn't taste bad necessarily, but just very bland, boring, and oddly balanced. I won't be trying this again unless someone else buys it, because I don't want to make the same mistake twice if it's not just the bottle. A disappointment from Stone overall."
"345 reviews as of this tasting. I will say that APAs are not a style I buy often and this was a gift from a friend at a party last week. I expected a hoppier than anything beer based on other Stone offerings but to my surprise this was a wonderfully balanced, nice modest hopped beautiful looking beer."
"Murky deep amber color with medium offwhite semi-lasting head. Smell is fairly mild, lightly hopped, and more heavily scented from the caramel sweetness than anything. Definitely a sweeter pale with light, almost blandish hop notes, and a slight burnt caramel bittersweetness. Somewhat rich for a pale, and reminded me much more of an ESB than any pale I've had before. Could have again, but I wouldn't go out of the way for it. Decent beer."
"Malty, toasty, caramel/butterscotch aroma with some piney hop character. Clear amber with mostly lasting off-white head. Minimal lacing. Malty, fruity, spicy hop flavor with some diacetyl/butterscotch and caramel notes and a mellow bitterness. Effervescent palate, semi-creamy mothfeel with a nicely lingering finish and aftertaste."
"This pale ale poured a light copper hue, with just the slightest trace of haze and a very thin head that is gone after one sip. Smells of hop resin, and pale malt. Taste is awesome. Balanced, crisp, simple. This is the kind of beer I want to drink with lunch, or with dinner in front of the TV. Session beer with good flavor. I don't feel the need to look for complex flavors, although they might be there. Carbonation is right on. Really a shame about the lack of head."
"Smooth and easy drinking, this is a good intro into the Pale Ale style."
"Nice copper-colored beer with a moderate white head. Pleasing malty aroma with a sweet sort of quality to go along with the hopped scent. Very good taste. Nice balance of hops and sweet malt. I detect a slight fruity presence. The beer is very well balanced. A lot of times with pale ales or IPAs there's one overpowering flavor... usually pine tree or hops, but this beer has an excellence proportion of flavors. Very good."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice looking- amber/red color, slightly cloudy. Nice head - cream colored, long lasting. Good aroma- seems to startr out with some piney hops, then smooth out with malt. Nice balanced beer, tastewise also. Decent hop bite, but also very smooth. What a nice lingering flavor. This definitely may be the perfect session beer. Once again not let down by stone at all!"
"It amazes me that even Stone's standard fare is so good. They deserve the reputation they've garnered for themselves."
"this one is easy to drink, and at 5.4% it is relatively sessionable. I could drink a couple bombers in a night if i wasnt driving."
"This is another winner from Stone! Darker gold color, nice frothy head. Smells of malts and hops, but with a stinging alcohol undertone. Tastes heavenly. The malts and hops are well balanced, and unlike other ""pale ales," this one seems to focus more on the malts/hops rather than additional flavors. There are some dark fruits and herbal hints, but not overpowering. Lastly, there is a relatively strong and warming alcohol taste. Overall, I can't say enough good things about Stone. Just another great beer from them."
"d: A fine APA. Great drinkability, good balance. Not as unique as some of stone's other brews, but very solid. Wish I had more than one."
"Easily one of the best APAs I've had. Interesting, cloudy orange/tan in the glass, with some head retention, but a nice lacing the whole glass through. Taste was a fascinating balance of floral/fruity hops, deep malt, and a touch of sweetness that made it extremely drinkable. One could easily blow through a bunch of these in a session and enjoy every swallow. Fantastic."
"D Great beer. I could drink a few of these. Pizza is almost here, maybe I will."
"The beer poured a slightly cloudy gold with tints of amber, it developed a small white head. The aroma has some sweetness over a hop base. The taste is suprisingly malty with a nice hop bitterness that quickly steps up and gives a nice dry finish. The feel is light and dry. A very drinkable APA, and one I will be sampling again."
"D - Pretty decent, but I gave a low score here because the entire time I said to myself, ""why drink this when I could have an IPA?"" perhaps it's just me though. A decent beer, and worth a try, but for practically the same price you could get their IPA which has tons of flavor. Could be perfect as a gateway beer for their bigger brews though."
"Pretty nice color...amber and golden brown. nice head, even from a bottle. The taste was ""yeasty"" however. Maybe it was the bottle I had...but based on other reviews I think this beer has some more potential. I would like to try it again..."
"Served in a standard pint. Pour was copper in color with a 1/2 inch fluffy white head that dissipated into a 1/4 inch froth within 30 seconds, settling into a thin consistent skim. Consistent lacing throughout the tasting. Scent of hops with floral undertones. As soon as it touched my tongue, experienced a slightly acidic bite, not at all unpleasant, followed by more hops (but not overwhelming), slightly bready undertones and a clean tart/slightly acidic finish. Nice mouthfeel - good balance as well as decent amount of carbonation. Very sessionable pale ale."
"Deep reddish amber color with an inch of medium bubbled foam that dissipates to a layer and leaves plenty of lacing. Aroma is biscuit and bready suggesting a sweet malty flavor. Taste is not as sweet as I suspected from the biscuit aroma. Actually a nicely balanced flavor with a dry to bitter finish. Feels moderate in the mouth with refreshing carbonation."
"GO GIANTS!"
"D: A pretty drinkable beer. Easy going down and a decent taste. A more robust malt taste, or maybe even some hints of bittering hops, would have made this brew a much stronger pale ale."
"Tried a couple of beers from Stone brewing company and this is probably one of my favorites. For a pale Ale pours slightly darker than I expected. With a ruby red burgundy color and a modest head. Smell was very light comparable to many of the style. Taste was crisp clear and clean with slight bready flavors and a lingering caramel and maulty finish. Distinct honey sweetness present with no bitter aftertones. Easy drinkability goes down smooth. Def recommended."
"Pours a dark amber with a very light tan head. Nose is of perfumed hops with the expected citrus head. Really a heavy perfume fragrance throughout. Flavor is consistently bitter in a smooth way. On the tail end a sweeter side appears. Feel has a decent carbonation, but overall feels a little bit thin; but still overall is extremely good. Great drink ability. Damn you, Stone."
"M/D: Carbonation is low but the body is on the light side of medium and very smooth and creamy, with some hints of hop oils. Drinkability is excellent as this one goes down smooth and isn't going to floor you too quickly."
"Poured from bomber into pint glass. Pours rusty-orange with nice thick head, good retention and lace, and some particles in suspension as well. Smell initally is of hops, not too strong, but some grains are present as well as a grassy aroma. Taste was a little bland for me. It seemed to be more malty, grassy, and grainy rather than any hops. Hops were there, but very subtle. Moderate carbonation and a thick mouthfeel, leaves behind a plesant aftertaste and oily feeling in the mouth. Overall my least favorite offering from Stone but still a good beer, I think that says a lot about that brewery."
"D = A good beer. I'd be happy with this whether I wanted one good tart beer or several."
"Poured into a Samuel Adam Boston Lager glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the cloudy reddish amber brew. Head lasts, and leaves hearty sticky lacing. Aroma is balanced, with toasty malt and lightly piney hops. Taste is the same biscuity malts sweetness upfront, and citrusy hops in the middle and on through the close. Not as balanced as the nose, more towards the hops here. Mouthfeel is not as smooth as I hoped, with overall drinkability being pretty good. Not my favorite Stone, but not a bad one either."
"One of the best Pale Ales Ive yet tried. Definitely worth a try, it rivals SNPA in deliciousness."
"Stone usually comes up big, but they can come up capably smaller and still damned good. It's the kind of pale ale most pale ales want to be. Everything about it makes it eminently and pleasurably drinkable. I could get into some trouble with this one. Glass houses be damned, I'm throwing back a few more Stones, thank you very much."
"D: There's no doubt that it's a good APA , but compared with some of the others, this makes a better than average drinker, and not much else. For the $$$, there is better/cheaper out there."
"Thanks for the bottle John."
"On tap at Moan and Dove. This pale had a murky, amber-red appearance with a head that quickly laced. It had the typical citrus aromas expected in a pale ale. Once sipped, the taste of bitter-citrus remains the general flavor of the drink. A nice carbonation allows this to be refreshingly drank throughout the night. A great crisp pale ale from Stone."
"Flavor is much darker, fuller, richer, and hoppier than your everyday APA, but what else would you expect from Stone? Much more like a lightly hopped IPA really. Excellently balanced. Hops are spicy. Finish is dry and spicy with a touch of ginger."
"The mouth is sturdy and slightly oily. I like how this beer coats your mouth. Very easy drinking session beer here!"
"Stone Pale Ale pours a nice golden copper with a creamy head that lingers as a thin off white layer leaving a nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is delicious, sweet caramel malts, clean with a nice toasted notes. There is a nice leafy hop aroma and an allusion to bitterness. The flavor is dry with a nice malt character. Hops are dominant but not overpowering. The nice light hop flavor leaves the beer crisp, with hints of toasted malts in the aftertaste. I really wish I could drink this everyday! I hope the rumors of Stone coming to Maine are true."
" This is amoung the finer american Pale ale's your going to find, I rank it right up there with the high-bar standard Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"Medium body, not too carbonated, a real slick mouthfeel. This is a tasty APA on the low end of hop craziness, which I appreciate. It would be my daily drinker if I could buy it in my lame State."
"Another great beer from Stone, this is a beer that I could drink all the time. Especially when I don't want a very strong beer, would buy again."
"Other APAs I have drunk had a more defining hop character. This one does not. Its kind of weird for a company that just packs the hops in a lot of thier beers their APA is kind of a dull affair. If you want something really unoffensive this might fit the bill. Otherwise if you like a hoppy american APA with some character look somewhere else I would say."
"For those who enjoy a hoppy ale, this is very delightful. I could drink a fair amount of these, although the hoppiness may prove too much for some. The balance and flavor give it good marks in my opinion. Definately recommended."
"D - This pretty much defines balance for a pale ale. It's beautiful in the glass, but nothing about the flavors or aromas is extremely unique. Highly quaffable and well-made."
"Pours a clear orange-copper color and is crowed by a short lasting tan head. Hints of caramel, molasses and a candy-like aroma are matched nicely with a touch of citrus and hops. Taste is mild for a Stone product. Still, plenty to keep the mouth entertained with the tameness to make it a good session beer."
"Although there are some APAs that I prefer, this is definitely a solid brew that I am psyched is finally in NH! This will surely be a staple in the beer fridge."
"Pours a transparent copper color with a soft white head. Aroma consists of orange peel and sweet malt. Taste begins with a sweet, biscuity malt undertone, that soon makes room for a bitter citrus hop flavor that lingers in the mouth for some time. Mouthfeel is very light and slippery. Light carbonation and medium body make this beer quite sessionable in my book. APA's are my favorite style, and this is easily in the top 2 or 3 for me. Nice brew here!"
"Final Note: after having had most of what Stone has to offer, I finally tried this delicious beer... what took me so long?"
"D- A great sessionable pale ale. Very tasty but not overwhelming and the alcohol content is well restrained. Try it."
"Drinkability - Extremely drinkable. One of the better APAs I have had the pleasure of having. Yum Yum."
"A good inch-an-a-half of thick, persistent foam covers a reddish-copper liquid. Soft aroma of caramel malts balanced with flowery citrus hops...surprisingly not all that hoppy. The first sip is very smooth and medium-heavy. Malt-forward but quickly balanced by a dry hoppy bitterness. Again, the hops are more subdued than anticipated, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Stone refers to it as a ""southern California interpretation of the classic British pale ale style""...now the beer makes more sense. The hops, although American, are mostly earthy, leafy, and floral and the nutty malt base keeps everything in balance. The mouthfeel is almost cask-like which suits the intended style just fine. I like how Stone didn't try to go way over the top on this one. It's all about balance here."
"Good appearance with a long lasting head that is very thick with an off-white color. The color is a cloudy dark gold. Medium amounts of lacing are seen with each sip. Nice amount of bitterness that is balanced along with the malt. The aroma is a bit weak, but does have a fresh hoppy smell along with a touch of malt. The mouthfeel is great with perfect balance of hops, bitterness, and sweet malt. Carbonation is good, but could be stronger. Nice citrus note on the finish. Overall very good and worth a second try. It is very drinkable, but very expensive. Another gem from Stone!"
"Mellow yet flavorful; a real easy to drink Pale, whose focus is more on balance than on hop intensity."
"This is an exceptional beer from Stone. Everything is well balanced while being complex. Recommended."
"A good first beer for anyone who's never had Stone beers. Very drinkable and I love the dryness of the aftertaste as well."
"This poured a nice dark amber with lots of head, tons of lacing. Smell was very malty, some hops, likely the maltiest beer I've had from Stone so far. This stuff tastes pretty good, really nice balance between hop bitterness and sweet grainy malts. Pretty smooth and refreshing. Of all the Stone brews this one is likely the easiest one to drink, could make for a good gateway beer. I'd recommend this one for sure."
"Not my favorite stone brew, but good."
"Well now, this is a damn fine APA. From a brewery that typically tests the limits of brewing, this beer exhibits great balance in every aspect. Super easy to drink, an ideal session brew."
"Overall a tasty and well balanced APA."
"Overall I wouldn't hesitate to grab a six of this when the mood strikes, however with the Stone IPA and Ruination sitting right beside it, I probably wouldn't. But this is still one of the very best APA's I've had to date."
"12 ounce bottle courtesy of Viggo. Pours a caramel orange with an offwhite head. Faint hiff of hops in the nose. Taste- caramel malts and cascade hops- grassy and citrus. Very nicely balanced and quite tasty. Not overly hoppy, esp. for Stone. Reminds me somewhat of Alpha King with the doughy malts. Drinkability is very good. One of the better pale ale's I've had."
"Go down and check it for yourslef if you get the chance"
"This is a really easy drinking, well balanced pale ale and easily the least hoppy offering from Stone (that I've had at least). Really solid pale ale choice."
"D- This beer has a pretty light flavor with a soft hops flavor. There isn’t much depth to the hops and the malt is pretty light aswell."
"A good hop kick is noticed up front and then it smooths out with the malt taking over. Some elements of caramel and cedar type taste as well. Very drinkable and true to style."
"This could easily convince people to come over to the darkside. Really good."
"Got this one eventually; I've had the Ruination and the IPA and figured I should finish my Stone Pales triumvirate. I've stayed away from the Pale Ales lately because of their generally weaker flavors - not true of this one. Pours a solid amber color with a good finger of white head on top that sticks around. Nose is pretty mild, but mostly fruity hops come through with some caramel malt. Flavor is complex and fantastic: lots of fruity hops throughout the drink (they actually come to dominate more later on in the drink), citrus, pine, and then a nicely balanced amount of toffee malt. Feel is amazingly full-bodied for the style, very filling in the mouth with good carbonation. This one is one of the best APAs I've ever had, perhaps beaten by the fantastic Hoppe from Southern Tier. I'll defintely be picking this one up again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and very dry with a fair amount of carbonation. I call this one a good pale ale and I, one that I enjoyed very much."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. The beer is medium copper in color, with a mild haze, and two fingers of off-white head that leaves nice lacing. Citrus, green hops, and pine in the aroma, all of which become more pungent as I drink. On the palate, it's predominantly citric/piney, and leafy green hops that impart a medium bitterness, but there are also hints of toasted malts and what tastes like noble hops - very tasty. Medium body and carbonation, with a dry, medium to long finish. Overall a nice and bitter, easy to drink pale ale."
"Pours a clean deep copper, with a tan head. Aromas that are sweet and a small amount of grapefruity hops. Smooth, small hop presenceand a dry end. It does have a small dry aftertaste. I enjoy the fact that it is not over the top, yet has a hop presence. A very nice pale."
"Another good beer from the folks at Stone, although I wouldn't call this one great. I like this, and will gladly drink it again in the future, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's the best pale ale I've ever had. Nothing about it really stands out and cries for attention. Still, it's a nice beer. Try it if you haven't yet."
"A very drinkable beer and a nice pale ale, Still, I expected even more knowing it comes from Stone."
"Stone makes some really nice beers, including this one. If I'm in the mood for an easy drinking hoppy beer though, I'd turn to Stone IPA before this one. And if I'm in the mood for a balanced pale ale, I'm turning elsewhere as well."
"Pours a sparse head with little retention. The color is a deep and spicey mahagony and amber, with little bubbling. The aroma is a spicey bread malt with a pronounced hop aroma. The taste has a good mixing of malt and hops. Dry mlats mixing well with flowery and citrusy hops. Easy to drink before, during, or after a meal. To bad we can't get this stuff in IL."
"D: Excellent beer and one I would recommend if your trying to get a buddy into craft brews."
"The mouthfeel is consistent and smooth and the drinkability is fantastic. The carbonation isn't very strong and the flavors linger just enough to leave you wanting another sip. For people who enjoy the big beers from Stone, this is a great beer to relax with and give your taste buds a break. Stone is such a consistent brewer and now that I've tried their Pale Ale, I've realized they can produce on any level of the brewing spectrum."
"Drinkability: Great. I thought stone was the meter stick for style categorizations but maybe I was wrong. I don't see this brew as an APA. Great flavors, ample complexity, and smoothe drinkability make this one a winner."
"Drinkability is probably the best for this brewery. I can drink a good six-pack of these guys."
"Overall, a very well balanced beer, and a perfect pale ale. Not as bitter or hoppy as an IPA, but still very flavorful. Recommended."
"D-pretty darn drinkable"
"overall, this is a nice beer, nothing spectacular, but enough going on to be likeable. poured from the uber-cool stone painted bottle, this was a deep hazy copper with a light tan head and lacing. caramel malts dominate the nose along with some subtle floral and fruity aromas. lightly sweet malts in the taste cleaned up by a moderate resiny hop bitterness. somewhat light mouthfeel and body. finishes clean and crisp. a sessionable offering from stone."
"Bottom line: This a great APA that I can highly recommend. See some grab some."
"D: Very good, it is one of Stone's smaller beers, I was expecting a bit more hop character, but overall, it was a very good session brew."
"Pours a clear copper, small white head forms, lace spots, decent retention, looks pretty standard. Smell is real nice, fresh, very malty, citrus/floral hops, very flowery, top notch pale ale. Taste is nice as well, sweet caramel malts, citrus/floral, sweet grapefruit, bit of grain, perfect balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very refreshing, great pale ale."
"Good but not Great"
"Overall its certainly not the best Stone but its still a good beer."
"This brew pours a dark brown with a reddish hue. Big head which dissaptes into a decent amount of lacing. Smells of hops, hints of sweet flowers, slight bread smell and I could swear I smell a slight bit of banana. The taste seems very balanced. It ends with a small amount of bitterness. The mouthfeel is fairly thick for an APA with ample carbonation. This brew is highly drinkable, definitely my favorite APA."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice creamy smoothness. Good steady carbonation. Great mouthfeel all around for a pale ale. This is an easy drinking pale ale but I prefer a brighter hop character and this one seems a bit too earthy for me. Not a brew I'd turn to myself, I think I'll stick to my other Stone faves from now on."
"D: Average. A solid APA, but nothing out of the ordinary here; I've come to expect a bit more from Stone Brewing. Kind of lacks balance, in my mind. Could be a sessioner for diehard fans of the APA style. Worth a try."
"12oz bottle. Decided to pick this one up instead of trying the Stone IPA since I needed to have some ""calmer"" beers for visitors. Pours a clear copper with medium head and carbonation. Aroma is a bit light and indistinct. And I have to say that the taste is also indistinct. It's difficult to put in words, since there's nothing that particularly stands out with this one. I'm a bit surprised at its relatively high ratings... (well, high overall, but a bit low for Stone.) Perhaps Stone's reputation is responsible for this? I have to say I'm disappointed with this one - and that's the first time I've ever had to say that about a Stone product. I wasn't expecting anything over the top from their APA, but was hoping for more than this."
"-Oelergud"
"Good PA, I still maintain this is more of an EPA and not an APA but in either event this is a quality brew."
"Certainly too pricey to be what it is intended to be."
"""Beer is good, beer is good, beer is good...and stuff"""
"Going by appearance, this looks more like a red ale to me; for a pale it's pretty dark and, well, red. It pours with ample head, eventually settling to a ring around the glass. Very caramelly nose, with just a touch of citric hops. The taste is on the sweeter side, smooth and coating, slightly grainy, with a mellow hop finish. Thankfully not overcarbonated as some pales tend to be. Nothing over the top here, just a nice, sessionable pale, and another good Stone brew."
"Very mild easy drinking Pale Ale. Not going to wow you at all... but still solid, and very session worthy."
"i can grasp the magnum in the aroma, however. this is far from the bullys on stone's roster; it's balanced. the hop flavor is significant but reasonable. the malt doesn't get to feature quite as prominently, but it's there"
"A very crisp, dry ale. A tiny bit bubbly, like ginger ale. Though it isn't quite as remarkable as other Stone brews, it's very good. Maybe I expected more. Dry, pale, very nice."
"pours a ruddy body with a thin, creamy head that sinks relatively quickly into a swirling film and spotted lacing. nose is quite heavy on the toasted caramel mixing well with floral, grassy hops. taste is refreshing, citric, and mildly sweet, but oddly a bit metallic, as if there's a hint of iron in here. mouthfeel is also pretty nice, well rounded, but a little sharp with the carbonation in the finish. very drinkable - a good beer, but a lot more calm and subtle (in terms of hopping) than i expected from stone."
"This is an excellent APA. It's very tasty and drinkable, good beer."
"Happy to have something more a little more low key from Stone. This is something I can buy on a regular basis and enjoy."
"A nice, pleasant, and sessionable offering from Stone. That's the good news. The bad news is it's score won't be enough to overtake Anchor Bock for the early lead."
"This one is not too extreme. I suppose Stone decided they needed a session beer and came out with this one. I actually haven't gotten around to reading the bottle yet. But its fairly smooth and medium to light bodied and I could easily enjoy a session with it."
"This is the first stone beer that I have tried and it is good. I look forward to trying their other offerings."
"Great stuff. This will be a regular of mine when I want a tasty session brew."
"Dark copper color with a nice sized head. This beer has the look of quality that you expect from Stone. Smell is fruity with some citrus zest. Also a strong backbone of caramel and biscuit malt comes through. The taste is perfectly balanced. I love Stone's hop bombs but this is just a solid balanced beer that deserves some props. Finishes with a little bit of a bitter bite, just to let you know it's a stone, and a little dry. If you look at drinkability as being able to down a bunch in a night than this is the most drinkable stone i've had. If you look at drinkablity as being ""boy i could drink this beer for the rest of my life and be happy"" then it's a winner also. The quality I've come to know and expect from stone. Hope this one continues to be available in PA."
"D: Smooth enough to spend an afternoon with."
"The hop masters at Stone manage to keep this in pale ale territory while still supplying a bit of bite. Recommended, of course."
"Stone's Pale Ale is an outstanding beer. It pours a nice semi-dark copper color. The head is descent sized, though somewhat short lasting. The smell is mildly of a fruity nature. The taste is nicely balanced, a little sweet and a little bitter, nothing overwhelming here-just right. This beverage is a highly drinkable beer, definitely worthy of bringing home from the beer store, if you are fortunate enought to locate some."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Drinkable and tasty. I would look for this again."
"Recommended."
"I had this out out in Vegas a while back and, while I enjoyed it, I was a bit underwhelmed. A second sampling did the trick. It's got flavour, it's got balance, and its easy drinking. This is decidedly un-Stone like but that's not a bad thing, yet at the same time this is exactly what I would expect from them in a stab at a simple quaffable pale ale."
"The beer pours a dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid malt scent that is complimented with an equally good hop aroma. It's slightly bitter smelling with some citrus notes. The taste is great! It has a wonderful mix of malts and hops that goes down smooth and finishes bitter with some hop residue. It has enough malts to balance the hops, but they really shine through all the way to finish; very nice. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good American pale ale. It's got it all; a fine drinking beer."
"Overall, this was definitely the least exciting Stone offering I have had to date, yet it was one of the most sessionable."
"D - A wonderfully smooth, yet vibrant american pale that says multitudes in small phrases. Clean and well built, yet dynamic and tongue enlightening."
"the taste is great its much more subtle than other stone beers, and probably so that this beer is more approachable and makes more money than the bigger beers, which allows them to make the bigger beers. anyway this one is a good solid beer that is very easy to drink and enjoy. its a must try as a session beer."
"Amazingley my first try of Sone's pale,poured a clear rich copper with a clingy 1 1/2 finger white head in to a standard pint glass.Leafy hop aromas hit up front with a touch of dry malt,good complexities on the palate very well balanced leafy ""green"" hop intertwined with a lightly sweet malt base with the hops barely taking the lead just highly drinkable for a ""standard""pale ale.Very nice hop profile wich was to be expected from Stone but very drinkable and social,well done."
"Pored this beer from the bottle to a tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer had a red color that was very pretty and a tan fat head. This beer was very clean smelling slightly hoppy. A great lager it had more of a hop taste but not overpowering like a hop bomb beer. Much like a Sam Adams but btter I thought. great lacing and good head retention. I will buy again."
"D: This is not the most drinkable of pale ale's since true to Stone's style, they made it a bit more robust and more hopped than the average brew in this style. I liked it a lot but it might be a little much for someone looking for an easy-drinking pale ale. This is one of the better pale ale's I've had. Another great brew from Stone."
"Poured a very hazy burnt amber orange with a big white frothy head that slowly faded and left behind a multitude of lacey goodness in its wake. Smell is very malty. Slight hint of a citrus hoppiness in the back but main flavors were grain and musty malty bread. Taste followed a similar route, crisp clean, and the finish was very light and orange tinged in flavor. Overall this was a very quality brew and a fine pale ale. My least favorite from stone thus far, but a quality brew fronmm anyone. Could see myself throing down this on a hot summer day, very nice indeed."
"Well I have to say that Stone sure did make a sessionable brew here. A very nice APA. I will drink some locals more often for less but this one is quite good."
" I don't care that the ABV is 5.40% - this would make a great session beer and a good introduction for someone new to this style. The bitterness fades away slowly after each sip, but it's a decrescendo and not an indication of weakness on the crafting of this beer. It may not pack the wallop that other American Pale Ale's do, but this is Stone, and it's extremely enjoyable, nevertheless. This was worth the effort to expand east for!"
"It's a decent ""session"" ale, though I expected something more of a body to it. Doesn't stand out among APA's for me."
"Recommended"
"This is an interesting pale ale from Stone. There's a good amount of bitterness, but a little less crisp hops flavor than I expected - probably just doesn't have the same kind of dry-hopping as similarly respected pale ales. Looking at it, it appears more a red ale by color, but the malt backbone sinks behind the hops just right. Oddly, I'm not getting much aroma out of it. This reminds me more of Lake Placid Frostbite Pale Ale that Hazed and Infused or SNPA."
"Medium bodied mouthfeel kicks off the tamest beer Stone has produced this side of the Mississippi. Very muted malt presence alongside an herbal grassiness that has always turned me off of this style. By far the most ""beerlike"" beer that Stone makes. I was shocked to see this in NJ (Liquor Outlet Wine Cellars in Boonton), but as the bottle states, their new expanded facilities have allowed them to make more beer. This was the first thing they brewed in that new site according to the bottle, and I'm not sure if that was a great decision or not. The hop profile is not one that I care for, and it doesn't allow the malts any room to assert themselves.	Very one sided, with herbal medicinal hops ruling the roost."
"Drinkability: Probably its best trait. This is one highly sessionable beer. Flavors aren't overpowering, and the body isn't too full."
"Before starting this review, I just gotta say thankyou to Stone Brewing for finally bringing this beer to the east coast. I have been waiting patiently for this one for a long long time...time to indulge. Poured a somewhat dark almost honey color, with a small white lacing. In the aroma were toasted grains, honey, a bit of grassy funk, and an overall sweetness. Taste was complex in a few ways. For one, it starts off bitter as all hell, with aggressive hops, then fades into a malty sweetness. Flavors of honey and doughy yeast come to mind. The hops in this beer also have a mild fruity side to them. Mouthfeel was light to medium, and ever so drinkable. Stone never ceases to amaze me. Pretty much all of their beers are all business, they are tough, robust, and delectable. Next time the oppurtunity presents itself, a six pack of this will be bought. Cheers."
"Pours copper with red hues. One finger plus head, with excellent retention,and lacing. Lots of bubbles. This is a good looking glass of beer! Smell is of grassy hops, with a hint of malt sweetness. Body is medium,and carbionated. Taste is a light, yet full a flavored mix of hops and malt, with an edgey slightly bitter finish.Very nice!!"
"Notes: This beer was definitely not what I expected from Stone, but in a way that pleasantly surprised me. I love aggressively hopped pale ales, which is what I was expecting, but this gives a smoother brew. Having this available gives me more slection in picking pale ales out as my favorites have always been hoppier varieties (SNPA, Alpha King, Sly Fox, etc.) This will be a nice alternative to pick up for days when I want a smoother, easy on the palate, pale."
"Newly available up her in Portland and Im glad to see it on the shelves even if it is a bit overpriced at $8.99 a sixer. Amber, sweet and soft and easy as heck to drink. I like it a lot, but with so many other fantastic APAs out here Ill have to wait to find it on sale to pick up some more of this."
"D-Easy drinking brew. Good example of the style and one you could easily session. I could go for a more pronounced hop bite, but this is still good."
"Pours out a hazy copper amber with a thin head and minimal lacing. Head lasts hardly a minute. Over-browned toast is all I could pick up for my first few sniffs of this beer, but then I was able to make out a weak hop presence. Flavor starts off with a lot of bready toastiness (natch), with light citrus, and a solid finishing bitter. Decent enough, but an odd, almost ""homebrew-like"" yeastiness prevails in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is definitely the strong point of this beer. Very smooth with a moderate body. Hardly any stickiness left on the palate. Really disappointed in this pale ale."
"On cask at Bobbique, this offering from Stone poured a hazy light amber color with a nice and soft white head. Good retention with some minor lacing. Not a whole lot going on in the nose surprisingly. Very very faint touch of grassy hops. Taste was clean and light, with mildly citrus hops and some bready malt. Decent mouthfeel. Overall a very drinkable pale ale but nothing extraordinary here. Not Stone's best but its a good beer."
"Drinkability is high here. It's a great beer that won't fill you up so you can drink a few in a row."
"Pours a hazy shade of orange-copper, generating a dense and creamy pale biege head, easily three fingers tall. Outstanding retention keeps a rocky cap for almost half the glass and leaves behind big sticky gobs of lace. Toasted crystal malt and light grassy hop aroma with some citrus/grapefruit just pulling thorugh. First sip has a touch of pale malt sweetness and a husky grain taste. Light caramel and pilsener malt come out slowly just before a snappy and herbal american hop flavor. Not unbalanced, but certainly a west-coast level bitterness for a pale ale. Semi-drying aftertaste shows some grapefruit and tea-like hop character but fleeting and not overly-bold. Light-medium bodied and gently crisp-a very smooth and inviting mouthfeeel. Finishes with a hint of butterscotch, mildly residual caramel and tame ale fruitiness that will vanish before it becomes distracting. This is a damn fine session beer with high drinkability and a flavor profile worthy of the Stone name."
"Drinkability: This is a really easy drinking APA, not big and hoppy, not really sweet, but this makes it really balanced and easy drinking. Mouthfeel is outstanding."
"A friend sent this as a surprise gift to me. I've had Stone's more aggressive offerings but not this one before now. It surprised me in that it reminded me of an ESB or other English ale due to the earthy hop aftertaste. I'm glad to have tried it even though it's not my favorite."
"The taste was leafy and grassy hops up front, with an oily, bitter finish. It's not an overwhelming hop presence, though. Slight hints of citrus and fruits, but they are not really the focus hear. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the finish was clean. This is certainly a drinkable, well-crafted pale ale. Worth a try."
"D: This is Stone's least memorable brew, in my opinion. It seems like they do best when pushing the boundaries rather than fitting in."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Good, smooth beer. I could drink a few of these. Overall, it's definitely not my favorite pale ale. I also think it's one of the weaker Stone offerings. It's definitely a good beer. It just doesn't overwhelm like many of the Stone brews do. But, that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it's one of the few Stones I could session."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good. Coats well and there is just enough crispness from the carbonation. Overall this is a pretty drinkable pale ale and quite toned down compared to most of their other brews. I'd drink this if it was more readily available, although there are more flavorful offerings out there."
"I'm certainly a fan of Stone's hop-centric offerings, but I was equally impressed with this beer, in which Stone demonstrated an abilty to hold back on the hop-horsepower while still producing a flavorful beer with bright malt flavors, tinged with caramel malt and juicy but well-balanced hop bittering. Stone managed to put quite a bit of depth into this beer, no small feat for a pale ale. A work of art."
"D- Great, easy-drinking APA (ESB?). This is a very refreshing beer that I will continue to enjoy. I have also found this is a great 'gateway' craft beer for friends used to the macrobrews. I took some friends to the Stone Brewery and the hoppy IPAs were too much for most of them, but they all enjoyed this beer. One friend even bought a case of Stone Pale Ale the following week (this is a Texan who only drinks Bud!). If that isn't an endorsement, I don't know what is. . ."
"everything tastes natural and fresh, which is nice, but i can't help but feel like i'm drinking a calculation, not a beer. that said, it is a fine brew, and i'm sure a crowd pleaser. i've had a good number of these since stone came to michigan, and i'm sure it will find its way into my rotation now and then, especially in social situations."
"This is not my favorite Stone brew. The beer just seems too bland. Not bad, just average. The smell is creamy and the taste is hoppy bot and it has a slight adjunct taste. The mouthfeel is smooth. Drinkability is good. This beer is not bad. It is, however, plain. Average for the style. Drinkable. No thumbs up or down. Medium."
"Not the big flavors you may have come to expect from Stone, but a very well balanced APA. Very sessionable brew."
"D - Very drinkable. I feel I could drink this everyday and not get sick of it."
"Drinkability: I know it was a nice highly drinkable session beer, but for some reason I just didn't care about this beer. I don't know what it was, but it had to be something in this beer that made not care about this certain Stone brew. I don't see myself anytime in the future buying this beer again."
"D: So unlike other Stone beers, but there's nothing wrong with that. This beer is easy to drink but does get slightly cloying after a while."
"Sturdy, well-balanced pale, perhaps even tilting toward the malty side of the equation. Looks good on the pour, with a big puffy head over a hazy apricot body. Hops provide tartness, but are overpowered by the bready malts to the extant that one cannot identify which buds were used. Smooth, full bodied, and eminentaly repeatable."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, this is an excellent beer to just keep knocking back continuously. Stone proves again how well they can brew. They can take even an ordinary style and make an extra-ordinary beer in it."
"Typical 12oz bottle, no freshness dates. Cool gargoyle, as usual. It poured out into a copper, translucent brew with a fat finger of off-white head that settled, leaving nice lacing. A little foam retained throughout. The aroma was dry, with little bits of banana, flowers, citrus, something herbal or so. Nothing stands out. The taste is well-balanced, with the same flavors as aromas, with some additional bready taste and a bittery finish. Good texture and consistency in the mouth. Pretty easy to put down. Nothing extraordinary here, but a solid, solid brew. I'll gladly grab more of this again."
"Mouthfeel was zesty, crunchy. Medium texture. Nice."
"It's funny how as a beer is poured you can tell it's going to be good. We just started getting Stone in Michigan and from what I've tried so far, the hype is all true. This pale ale is what I would term an all around good beer. Perfect for session drinking, a hot summer day or a cold winter night or anytime really. Poured into a pint glass - rich amber in color with a nice amount of head that slows fades into some decent lacing. Smells sweet and crisp - very inviting. Tastes sweet and malty up front with a refreshing dry finish. Mouthfeel is great for this brew - not too thin, some carbonation is welcomed here. I could see myself drinking this a whole lot in the future. This will become a staple at my household. Highly recommended."
"I love this pale ale. It pours a nice copper-amber with a thick off-white head and excellent retention, yielding some nice lacing. The smell is light, but with a good mix of malts, fruit and hops. The taste is quite full, with complex grains and caramel sweetness, along with the classic Stone citrus notes. It has a good body and light carbonation, finishing dry, but not overly bitter. These won't last if you share then, so stock up on them!"
"A fairly quiet beer, easy to drink and low enough alcohol to do just that. It retains that Stone goodness, though."
"This is a unique beer, and while I was expecting more from Stone, I'll give it another try in a month or so."
"pours rusty amber with marginal head and good lace. floral, oily hops, almost a slight hint of honey suckle it's so sweet smelling. there is a nice hop finish to it, but just like every pale ale it really leaves me wanting a bit more punch to it. this is definately the lightest bodied beer i've had from stone thus far. this would work great for a warm summer night on a porch in rhode island. it also did well a few days after christmas in a barracks in san diego!"
"D - For the style it is spot on. Balanced and smooth. Its the flavor of those hops I cant get past. Horrible. But then that is my own personal taste."
"Mouthfeel is fine, and drinkability is hampered only by too much caramel/toffee for me. Very nice beer in its style, it's certainly not what I was expecting. Best before was sometime in January, 2007, but the exact date is smeared on the last two bottles of my six pack."
"Cheers!"
"Moderate mouth with the right amount of carbonation. A perfectly drinkable PA that blows most of my old standbys out of the water."
"Pours a copper color with little head that went away quickly, it was sticky for the brief period it remained. The smell was compromised mostly of sweet earthy malts, floral hops, and some other sweet fruits. The taste is sweet and slightly spicy in the front, it finishes dry and spicy from the hops. A good overall mouth feel, with medium body, good balance of sweetness to bitterness."
"Thanks to boolshot and Marvz and the incredible Double Trouble BIF!!!"
"Unbelievable that Stone Pale Ale has been in my face for several years now and never once did I consider having one. WOW, and I considered myself a Stonehead. Poured an amber hue with a 2 inch slightly orange head that last the entire drink. The aroma was on point with what I was tasting. Initially, my experience began with a malty sweet caramel/ maple syrup and ended semi dry with a small hint of ruby red grapefruit and lively carbonated. Unlike most Pale Ales that I've had, Stones Pale Ale seems alot tamer than most with a sweet demeanor. This brew is much like at home and will be a regular at home. Enjoy."
"Mouth is solid but again I prefer a beer of this style to be a bit chewier."
"Eric"
"The beer never deviates from the Pale Ale style in order to stand out or get above the competition. Instead, relying on a well formulated recipe and quality brewing techniqes. A delicately blended brew with power and variety. Oh, by the way, one of the best appearances found in any beer, not just pale ales."
"In the mouth this beer is medium bodied and carbonation does not interfere with the flavor profile. I didn't notice it before but it has a full creamy character that feels very nice in the mouth. It goes down very easily and I could drink it all day. However, I know for a fact that there are other APAs out there which I am definitely going to try to get my hands on.. Although I love Stone's beers this one just didn't meet my expectations. I would rather prefer to drink GLBC Burning River or SNPA over this one."
"12 oz. bottle, 5.4 % ABV. Very clear darker copper color. Thick white foamy, rocky head. Looks very robust. Where is the hop aroma I was expecting. Not much more than a hint of floral and citrusy hops. Earthy and bready in the nose. The head held well for a few minutes, then disappeared, leaving just a thin ring. A bit of earthiness at first, slightly toasty malt. Floral hops are restrained, and there are hints of citrusy hops as well. Finishes with a big jolt of bready, almost nutty flavors. Not at all what you would expect from Stone, considering their hoppy lineup. Low carbonation and ABV make this a great session beer. Interesting, unexpected and very nice."
"Authentic pale ale in the style of burton-upon-trent, I have not had one that rang so close before. Along with the alesmith anvil esb, there are apparently a decent set of english-style authentic ales available in south california. Well worth seeking out, and certainly better than any bottled bass you will get on this side of the pond."
"D: This has some potential, but the flavor is just plain bad. This barely passes as drinkable."
"I poured this 12oz bottle into a pint glass. It is a wonderful copper in color with a slightish head a faint tan. Both in smell and taste lots of hops, grassy, and citrusy. The carbonation is a bit more than I expected, but it is very refreshing. It finishes dry. Overall, it is a pretty bold pale ale. It is a bit too hoppy for the style me thinks, but that aside it is a very good beer."
"This beer is orange/amber palish. It has nice head and great retention. It has a nice hop scent. Sort of citrusy. Taste is incredibly well balanced. This beer was sooo perfect to relax with it is highly sessionable. One of the best pale ales I've had. Go try one."
"this is a good pale, easy drinking, i di dnot expect much the guy at the beer store told me it was not very good. He was VERY WRONG."
"Pours an off-red color and almost smells like an Oktoberfest brew. Decent pillowy head and nice lacing down the glass, an excellent session beer. Some hops and what appears to smell like caramel and some type of apple-cherry type fruit. Not Stone's best overall beer but a sure nice one."
"Low to medium body, an OK beer, but fairly small for what I would expect from Stone."
"from the bottle BOUGHT HERE IN MICHIGAN today. poured a nice rich amber copper with a big off white head. aroma, bready, hops, brown sugar, orange, malt. flavor,hops come right out first, a slight sour orange malt, a little nuttieness like almonds, nice bitterness and dryness. not to bad"
"Drinkability: I can & have downed many of these. This is a rare brew whose appeal to me isn't affected by the season. I could drink this anywhere."
"Thanks to bennetj17 for the trade."
"Pours a pretty translucent mahogany with a fluffy head that quickly dissipates. Good carbonation. Smells pretty light, some floral hops and a hint of wheats. Taste is also a bit light, very slight nuttiness almost with a gradually prominent floral hoppiness. Good drinker, i'd have it again, rather punchy for a pale ale."
"Very drinkable. Never have I been a fan of APA's or IPA's, but Stone has done a good job with this one. I'll probably look for this again."
"A solid pale ale. Worth a try, but may be disappointing if you're expecting something like Stone's stronger fare."
"D- I could imagine myself in an english pub drinking this to oblivion and having no imediate regrets. My only concern would be the morning after."
"Drinks very easy, this a nice counter statement to many of the big beers that I love from Stone, just goes to show small & sensible can be beautiful too! Yum"
"I don't regard this as much of a session beer as do some of the other reviewers. I enjoy one at a session but then feel like moving on to something else."
"The drinkability in way high, nothing holding it back. Prosit MK"
"Nice copper-colored beer, darker than most pale ales. A slight bit hazy and with a creamy white head. Has a nice, strong aroma of nice, bitter hops, citrus, and malts as well. The taste is similar -- nicely balanced citrusy hops with lighter malts. A bit of grainyness as well. Medium-bodied with a nice level of carbonation. Although certainly rather strong, it is a very drinkable and enjoyable. It often seems that Stone tries to go over-the-top with their beers, but this is a really solid offering from them that has impressed me."
"Overall, this beer would be given a 5.0 across the board if the brew itself were perfectly clear with a more impressive head, and if the smell was a bit more pronounced. However, these slight weaknesses are far outweighed by the exceptional flavor, mouthfeel, and ease of drinking. This is a must have!"
"Bomber bottle, purchased about 20 miles from the brewery in SoCal., no freshness info to be had. Pours typical almond amber, clear, with an off white puffy loose head that leaves some thick, sticky lacing. This is perhaps the mellowist and most sessionable of the Stone products. Moderate hop package, compared to the hop monsters prevelant in the S.D. area. Pleasant, approachable, balanced ale, layers of malt, British style, nice, Stone with training wheels."
"Poured this awesome looking pale ale out of a 22 oz. bomber into a hefe glass and boy how it looked. Ruby red with a touch of copper and a pure white head, which doesn't last that long albeit compared to Stone's other head retentions. Never gets to a ring though! Wouldn't exactly call it ""pale"". The smell is at first like a watered down version of their IPA, but gets much more pale ale-ish like when you start to scarf it down. The Carmel flavors come out and its very well balanced in the hopping and malt. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy and leaves little carbonation. In fact, I was wondering if I got a dud bottle because of the lack of bubbles, but after you take a swig they appear. Drinkability is damn good and very balanced. One of the best Pale Ale examples I've had yet, and Stone just keeps impressing me. A little bit better than Sierra Nevada because of the balance in flavors."
"D - A good alternative for a mild hop fix w/o the super dry bitterness. Quite drinkable."
"Amber in colour with medium carbonation. Very bready aroma, with some secondary notes of toffee, manderin oranges, and a bit of pepper. Medium bodied, with flavors of caramel malts, cookie dough, mild green hops, and a bit more toffee. Medium bitterness. Much less hop dominant than I had expected. It seems more like an amber ale than a pale ale to me. Good stuff, but I'd stick with the Ruination."
"Drinkabilty- eh at the start and as warmed got a lot better."
"D: I have almost finished the glass while reviewing. A good beer that begs for that next sip. I could see myself haveing quite a few of these before I tire of the style. Impressed by the addictivness of it."
"D - Excellent drinkability. Great pale ale. Would be an outstanding session brew. Bring this one to Texas ASAP!!"
"Poured a dark (for a pale) gold. Slight haze which looked like it was due to carbonation. Aroma was citrus, honey, maybe slightly grassy and a faint metallic note. The taste was an excellent balance between malt and hops -- there was some sort of butter/chocolate/caramel flavor in the middle that was very slight. Not really appropriate for style, but did not hurt it in any way. Mouthfeel was lively and drinkability was excellent. Looking forward to the other Stones in my fridge."
"Interesting that this is a Stone brew; now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Stone, but this brew is so beautifully balanced and is not a monster in any area whatsoever. Brassy golden color with a floral aroma of caramel Granny Smith apples. Begins initially sweeter than expected, mildly sour grape and cherry notes. Chewy malt melds beautifully with an ever-so-subtle herbal hop bitterness. Carbonation tingles from front to back. So drinkable. Somewhat sweet, not insanely hoppy, unbelievably balanced. Nice."
"3.5/3.5/3.5/4/3.5"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tumbler. Pretty standard appearance, dark orange and clear with a nice but thin white head. There wasn't much of a smell really, which might be an asset for a pale ale. Typically I smell a little more hops though... The taste pulls through with some hops but mostly a neutral flavor. This is perfect barbecue beer, which is how I had it."
"For me the IPA is better for a clean taste, but the PA is very good. Good beer from Stone."
"Very refreshing and drinkable. Another outstanding Stone product."
"Pours a nice dark copper with an impressive inch and a half of light tan head that lasts. Smell is a nice blend of malts and hops. Doughy scent comes through first, followed by brown sugar then the flowery, fruity hops. Taste moves along the same path from sweet malts to fruity hops. Nicely balanced. No bitterness from the hops noticed...just goes down smooth. Thin to medium body with nice carbonation. I thought it could have been a bit thicker feeling but a nice brew none the less."
"drinkability: a good sipper or slugger both. a very nice beer from out friends at stone. (now if they would only distrbute it outside of so-cal....you won't have to worry about freshiness issues up here and arizona at least, this could kick fat tire's ass)"
"Notes: Really tasty, not a session beer and not a beer I could sit around and have a few, for me a couple at a time is perfect."
"D: Easy to go sip for sip with any beer. Easy to drink all 22oz in under an hour without regret or drunken stammering."
"Flavor is malts with a mellow wood flavor. Understated hops and surprisingly to style. I was expecting more of an IPA. Creamy flavor too. Full, chewy mouthfeel that had a slight creamy feel too. Way too good and easy to drink."
"This is a very VERY drinkable beer, with appealing aromas and flavors. The flavors are very well balanced. I wouldnt mind having several of these in a session. I would certainly drink Stone Pale Ale again, and I wish I had bought more than a six pack."
"""That's a good fssshhhaaaucking milkshake!"" -- J. Travolta, _Pulp Fiction_"
"D- smooth with great taste, i could spend a lot of time with this one, and enjoy every mintue of it. Very distinct from other pale ales ive tried."
"Drinkability: Very different from what I would have expected from Stone, this pale ale verges on a hoppy amber in style; I'm not all that crazy about the herbacious bitterness of this brew, to be frank"
"easy drinking, probably a very nice beer on tap or cask"
"D - Although I was expecting more of a 'west coast' presence, this is one tasty offering from Stone. I'm not a HOP head but I do personally prefer more of a hop profile in my APAs. An extremely sessionable beer. Solid 4's all around. This might be the beer I use to get my BMC friends to cross over."
"This would be a good stepping-stone to the stronger ales that Stone has to offer, good stuff !"
"This is one you can stick with for the entire day/night. Excellent beer."
"Copper with sheets of active carbonation streaming upwards; massive ecru foam head. Aromas of mellow hops, biscuity malt and fain diacetyl character (?). Wow, the hops in this are way understated for a Stone beer (yes, I know this is a Pale Ale and not an IPA). They're much ""earthier"" than piney/citrusy -- no Cascades in this one, I imagine. Biscuity malt flavor is sturdily present, and yes, I'm picking up a definite butter flavor as well. All of this leads me to think this is a very ""English"" beer. Quite unexpected from such a paradigmatic ""West Coast"" American brewery. Smooth mouthfeel, extremely quaffable. If this were available more regularly back East (and, not to mention for the price they get it in Arizona or CA), I'd stock up on this regularly. Pleasant surprise from a cherished brewery."
"good save the gargoyle."
"I could only ask for a bit more of a carbonated mouthfeel to help give the hop bite that extra zing. Seems a bit light in body, and quite refreshing, though it doesn't seem as crisp as something like SNPA. Either way it is just as tasty and a hell of a drinker. It is obvious that Stone put some quality ingredients into this beer as opposed to some breweries I've tried recently who just throw the cheapest crap they can find together into a brew kettle. Even something as basic as a pale malt has a noticable difference in quality. Kudos to Stone."
"This is a nice one - Stone continues to be my favorite brewery - my favorite Californian brewery, at least. A San Diego staple."
"All in all nice crisp clean and very drinkable. I enjoyed this IPA and will recommend."
"I dig it. Stone's ""pay the bills"" beer and something that can appeal to novices and geeks."
"This pale ale has a bit of size and effervescence in the mouth but it tapers off and finishes very soft. This, along with the crisp hop tail, make it very refreshing. Some brewers might call this an IPA, but it is a nice APA offering form Stone."
"Pours a clear golden/amber color, some carbonation, nice creamy tan head which sticks around, tons of lacing afterwards. Scents of hops, malts, and citrus. Taste of bitter hops, and malts. There is a nice dry sweetness aftertaste. Medium body. Very drinkable. Another strong offering from Stone."
"The staple beer of my trip to San Diego. Pretty much every bar in town has Stone PA on tap. Pours a clear copper colour, with a rich white head. Moderately carbonated, smooth mouthfeel and super drinkable. Hoppy, fruity against malty goodness. Very well balanced, fruity and an all around classic. Good session ale."
"Beer is good. Happy pale ale beering."
"Compared to my prior review, I think I like it a little more than last time. Not something I would drink on a regular basis though."
"Not overly complex, but a good, solid, and highly drinkable pale ale. I think that I enjoyed the Levitation a little more, though."
"Such a nice Pale Ale. Definitely a great effort by Stone, and a great introduction to their quality for an initiate. I could drink it all night."
"I think it's because I drink so much Stone, that when I'm looking for something less assertive then their other brews, I'll go with a different brewery for varity. Maybe that's not the best idea. I'm going to have to try Bear Republic's pale ale now."
"Opinion: I am really impressed with this beer. I didn't think that I would like it much, as I am not a hop-head. Stone notoriously produces seriously hoppy beers, and I popped the top on this one thinking that I was going to get a watered Ruination. Not true. This is a beer that has a substantial malt backbone that is reminiscent of their Arrogant Bastard. I think that this is a really nice beer, and it is one that I would definitely try again."
"12 ounce bottle, sent to me from mentor!!! I have wanted this one for a long time, many, many thanks. Dunno why it never makes it East from the brewery, but it should!"
"Drinkability - Very nice beer. Not too bitter, goes down easy. I can drink this all day long. A good ""go to"" beer for a session."
"Drinkability- This could be a very easy session beer. Not as good as some of my favorites IMO, but still a great example of a truly balanced pale ale."
"I believe this is what every other american pale ale wishes it was."
"Very drinkable after a mid summer morning of picking blueberries as the temp and Rel. Humidity climbs toward the nineties in Mid-Missouri's Dog days."
"Stone Pale Ale, like all Stone beer, is wonderful stuff. I'd tweak it a little here and there, but as is, it's a delicious, perfectly balanced pale ale that is exceedingly drinkable. As I pour the last few ounces into my pint glass, I find myself wishing that I had another bomber waiting in the wings. What better recommendation is there than that?"
"Overall, Stone's pale ale is one of my main beers of choice for a session brew or dinnertime beer. So easily quaffable and easy to pair with a good range of meals. Last night it paired nicely with grilled pork chops and baked potatoes. One of my favorite go-to beers."
"This beer pours a light brown. Maybe a reddish color. The head is tan with a slight orange tint to it. It fades very slowly leaving very thick laces. This is probably the darkest pale ale I have ever seen. It has a floral aroma to it. The presence of malts are also apparent. There is a slight citrus scent to it as well. It tastes less hoppy that I would expect froma pale ale. It is more of an amber really. It had a very good balance of hops and malt flavor. This beer is very well balanced. It leaves a creamy feeling and citrus like taste on the palate. This beer wuld be a great session beer. It has a low alcohol content, so you could drink quite a few. Also, the flavor is not so strong and aggressive that you might get tired of it. I think I could drink this beer all night long. It is definately well worth trying."
"Drinkability: This is simply an outstanding pale ale that would go quite well with food or on its own. It's bolder and more robust than most pale ales, but still is quite good for the masses who have only been exposed to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"Mouthfeel is as rich and full and creamy as you might want. I can see this being too drinkable, and becoming a problem tomorrow if I'm not careful. Another winner from Stone!"
"Another very good Stone brew, very good pale, fresh from California courtesy of Rudolf. Radekfest #8."
"Overall impression: This beer seems to disappear by the six pack from the fridge. I'm not sure where it's going, but I keep buying more!"
"Many months old. Reddish dark amber hue. fine lacing off-white cover. Soft cedar hops unveil a generous maltiness (caramelic) in the nose. Biscuity malts are the main flavor on the palate, but never dominating. Medium body, creamy texture, soft carbonation. Great mouthfeel. Soft floral hops change into a resinous earthiness covers the teeth in the finish, but all remains mellow and diplomatic. Surprisingly well balanced, but perhaps unexciting as well."
"This is a great beer that I could see myself drinking on a regular basis. Lots of flavour and quite refreshing. Too bad it's made so far from home..."
"Medium bodied and drinkable like no other."
"Finished this 22oz bomber wanting more. Smooth and just short of being too interesting, perfect for sessionability."
"Once again, Stone lets quality ingredients do the work for them in this flavorful and very drinkable pale ale."
"Tastes much like it smells. Sweetish fruit and waffle cone malt. Hops come in, seemingly un-intimidated by the big maltiness. Bitter resin and citrus flavors carry into the finish, with lingering butterscotch/fruit. Yum. This is a big-bodied APA, that actually reminds me of some breweries IPAs. Very drinkable, just wish I had more."
"Drinkability: If one were to enjoy this beer, one could surely drink it for a while; however, I only thought the was good, not great, and thus scored it accordingly."
"Wow, I forgot to review this one for a while. So here it goes. A dark amber/copper colour with a thick white head of foam that lasts for a while and leaves very nice lace patterns on my arrogant bastard pint glass. The aroma is definately hop-heavy but the biscuity, bready malts are in there as well. The taste is hoppy up front, but this is a very balanced pale ale, especially for Stone. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is very good! An awesome, balanced, pale from Stone Brewing Co."
"Overall- a basic run-of-the-mill IPA. Nothing to shout about but I would drink again."
"there is just no way i could get tired of drinking this. a very straight forward pale ale with no funny business."
"Stone Pale Ale pours a light amber color and makes a medium white head. Smell has a slightly roasted malt characteristic, but not too exciting. Flavor is interesting.. it opens up spicy and sweet, roasted, nutty and has a nice bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel is a solid medium, has a slightly sticky syrup aspect that sticks to the mouth and throat as it goes down. I like it, its a good session brew, drinkable without a doubt."
"Stone continues to impress..."
"22oz brown bomber with the standard stone silk screen design. I have no idea why this and their levitation ale never make it to out here but all their other brews and seasonals do. So this was ordered online. This one pours a great orange amber color with a good-sized head of off white. As the head disappears it leaves a beautiful lacing around the glass and beer. The aroma is predominantly citrus hops with a trailing sweetness from the malt. The taste of sweet malt briefly starts this one before the hop rush kicks in. The finish is a hop bitterness that counter balances the malts nicely. Mouthfeel is unusually thick for a pale ale but I like it, there is also a good amount of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer as most are from stone and is a great pale ale. It really makes me wonder more why this isnt as abundant in stores as the rest of their line. Oh well its definitely worth a try for anyone that comes across it."
"Drinkability  I really enjoyed drinking this ale, but it wasnt what I was expecting. I know its not an IPA or a dry-hopped SoCal monster hop bomb, but I would have preferred a bit more balance."
"Medium bodied, subtle alcohol, great balance and boldness of flavor. Super pale ale. It would make a great everyday beer, except that it makes most other beers look feeble."
"Drinkability: All day & all night...you name the time and the place!"
"This is a wonderful beer that leaves me wanting more."
"Clear, coppery-bronze in hue, an off-white head reached two fingers in height. This is a very lovely looking beer. It had steadfast head retention, it took a moment before it started to collapse, and a firm cap remained throughout consumption. The subsequent lacing was very webby and quite rampant. The nose says Pale Ale but it doesnt shout at me with hops alone, yes there are the typical hoppy notes of citrus, flowers, and pine. But the caramel malt is more than just a passing fad. The bouquet is well rounded and very inviting with modest potency. Like the nose suggested, the palate confirmed, this is a Pale Ale! Hell yeah! The bitterness is firm but not out of hand, citursy and piney hops flavors start the taste off on the right food, caramel, slightly toasty malts follows, ale fruitiness too, and by the finish the hops and malt blend in perfect harmony. This is quite the flavorful Pale Ale, very balanced and one of the best representations of the style I have ever had. Medium in body. Natural, soft but filling carbonation, the mouthfeel is very encompassing, relaxing. This is an ideal beer to drink on a regular basis. Stone Pale Ale is every bit as tasty as SNPA. When I was in Fort Collins I was smart enough to purchase a six-pack of this nectar, I figured this would make a great beer to chill with in the hotel (it was). I did save one bottle to review. Now I realize I should have bought two six-packs or a case or a one-way plane ticket to San Diego."
"Loved it!"
"Appearance: Amber hue crystal clear with a nicely formed cream head nice and bubbly leaves fine evenly patterned lacing. Aroma: Very floral in nature hops are evident they take a seat in the cockpit, but it's okay the malt backbone is the copilot. Wonderful fruity undertones with a bouqet of whole leaf flowery hops, well done. Taste: Sufficient amount of hops some may say unbalanced however for me this beer is perfect. American style pale ale boasts a fruity slightly caramel tinged malt backbone that also has the support of some juicy hop bite. Mouthfeel: To Stone this is their light beer, in reality it's a medium bodied lucious ale with mild even carbonation. Drinkability: Blessed with high marks across the board making it hellaciously consumable wow this is up there with their IPA for all around goodness."
"Medium bodied with a full round mouthfeel. Seemed at the edge of having a bit to much carbonation. Would make an outstanding session Pale Ale."
"A strong but drinkable brew."
"Thanks goes out to xlperro for the bottles!"
"This was one that I've wanted to try for a long time, and now that I have, I'm glad I did. Stone creates another classic, and a truely great session beer. Simply fantastic, and one I'd certainly have again, and a candidate for a session beer for me."
"I am hooked. Whenever I go to the liquor store now, I HAVE to bring home a six-pack of Stone Pale Ale. Period. It is amazing. I love IPA's so I tried Stone's IPA first, wonderful, but a little too strong for a session beer for most folks, as is Arrogant Bastard. If you like IPA, this is as strong as a NORMAL IPA. Which is why I like it: the slap of grapefruit hops hits your nose like Christmas. Perfect: head, lacing, malt balance, dry finish. And HOPS. You are going to love this beer!"
"Not bad."
"The Stone Pale Ale poured a slightly cloudy, copper-orange with a medium off-white head that quickly went to a lacing that stuck to the glass on the way down. It had a faint grassy, hoppy smell. The initial taste was some bitterness with a touch of citrus. It had a pretty strong bitter finish that mellowed as I drank it (the draft version was also mellower and smoother). Overall, this was a fine specimen of a pale ale, which is not my favorite style."
"A nice, slightly hazy, copper color. Pours with a dense white head. Not as aromatic as I was hoping. There is a nice bitterness up front, as I take my first sip, it is accompanied by some biscuit - malty notes. There seems to be a lot of complexity missing here. A straight forward pale ale with not real defining characteristics. It is not balanced enough to work on a subtle level. It is certainly bitter, fairly clean flavors (light fruit, malt and some hoppy flavor contributions). Seems to be missing that certain Stone 'pizzazz'. Overall a decent beer, but I was hoping for something with a bit more definition. I need to see if I can get a known fresh bottle of this, to see if perhaps this is just past it's prime."
"This is one of the ultimate session beers in my opinion. On tap it is especially smoothe and crisp. It poured a nice light amber color with not much head because the bartender filled up the pint to the brim! Right off the bat I could smell the scent of floral hops and a slight spice that I cannot put my finger on. The taste was very good and reminded me a bit of the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale but with a much more balanced floral hop character and a nice malt flavor as well. Seeing as how most good bars around town have this on tap, this is now the new default beer =)"
"Big-sized doffing of the topper to El Bummerino for providing the bomber!"
"Drinkability: A great introduction of Stone's offerings. Would be my house brew if readily available to me."
"$2.99 a bomber."
"Amber color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is malty, fruity and sweet. A medium bodied pale ale. Very hoppy, medium bitterness. Nice balance of malt and hops, taste is slightly spicy. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Etched beer bottle."
"Notes: Demonic, ass-kicking, little brother of Stone's 7th Anniversary Ale; a stellar APA."
"It drinks with a crisp refreshing quality. I enjoy this ale with meals. A superbly thoughtout ale. It drinks oh so smooth."
"Brilliant orange copper color topped by a lovely thick cream head. Aroma of floral hops and lightly roasted malt sweetness. Taste shows good bitterness, both citrus and somewhat floral/perfume in nature. Well balanced by a smooth malt sweetness that hints a caramel. Mouthfeel is good, not thin but not extremely rich either. Drinakbility is very good. Perhaps a little less bitterness would make this a touch better, but then less bitter wouldn't be much like a Stone brew, would it? Give this not-so-pale ale a try. If you like Stone (and who doesn't?), you'll like this slightly lighter (everything is relative) offering. That said, many IPA's wish they were this hoppy and this good. I'm about ready to give up all beers other than those from my Fab Five breweries. And each beer from Stone puts me a step closer to that day."
" Wow! This is a terribly enjoyable beer. Its gratifying hop level is balanced nicely with the subtle sweetness and the floral notes that float around. Three more words for this beer: Session, session, session!"
"I found this ale to be even better than their IPA. Outstanding slightly hazy deep amber colored with full size head. Excellent retention leaving a fully laced glass. Amazingly fresh aroma of grains and hops could have easily passsed for a draught beer. Full bodied and smooth with a slight crispness, fantastic mouthfeel. Malts are really standing out ahead of the hop aroma. Flavor is a terrific balance between the malt and hops, grainy,rich,slightly bitter and sweet at the same time. It's great to see an ale that is well balanced and can showcase good malt flavor."
"After tasting Ruination and Arrogant Bastard, I expected all Stone brewing ales to be totally dominating and ruthless. This on the other hand was beautiful and poetic, yet strong. Appearance a beautiful white head resting on a rather dark orange body. And what a sexy body. The malt aroma was married with the hop. I have never had a beer with such fragrant malts. The flavor was outstanding, both the malts and the hops were aggressive, but not intrusive and announced themselves with grace. I think dry caramel. It is only on the finish that the hops come out ahead."
"Originally sampled on 8 May 2002. ReRate 23 Feb 2003: This is a great example of an American Pale Ale. It has a hazy amber color w/ a nice, controlled, hoppy taste. This is a great session beer, or it can be used to convert BMC drinkers to real beer."
"Not that there's anything wrong with that!"
"This beer poured a golden yellow with a thin white head. This was a very fresh and floral tasting pale ale. I enjoyed this one a lot and has to be my favorite Pale Ale in recent history. Strong hops and grainy aroma and more fuller bodied than, say Sierra Nevadas Pale. Nicely done, crispy and pleasantly drinkable."
"This is quite a change from the 'over-the-top' character that Stone's brews tend to flaunt."
"Oh yes, I do like Stone's brews. This is another one of their great products. Poured a beautiful dark amber with a nice white head that went to a thin film, but laced throughout. Good nose of malt and grain with a light sense of hopping. This came through in the taste as well, as the hops were there, but did crowd the rest of the flavors out. The mouthfeel was very nice, a good blend of body, creaminess with just a bit of a final crispness. More, please."
"Pours a golden-orange in color with a head that resembles seafoam, both in color and consistency. A spotty lace is left behind. Crisp and clean aroma. Smells well balanced and slightly sweet. Mild floral hop notes. Taste is well balanced. Slight malt sweetness with a hint of a metallic taste. Finishes dry with a nice hop bitterness. Medium body and on the lighter side of carbonation. This is a nice drinkable pale ale, not as assertive as I was expecting. I'm working my way up the Stone line though so I think this was a good place to start. Thanks to Gusler for the sample. Cheers."
"Bottom Line: Don’t get me wrong. This is a very nice beer, but the red-headed stepchild in Stone’s portfolio. As Goldilocks said, “This one is toooo ‘soft’.”"
"Sweet beer"
"As Im such a big fan of Stone Brewery, and always keep a bunch on hand, it seems a bit odd Ive not had one of these fine Pale Ales in almost seven moths, strange. Pours a deep amber to copper color, the head is prodigious in size, frothy in texture and the lace fine sheets to coat the glass. Nose is nice a deep sweet malt, hints of caramel, and the little ""Hop Flowers", I love so much. Front is malt sweet, top is middling in feel and the finish a Hop Heads Dream, spitefully acidic, the aftertaste dry as a desert bone and quite long lasting, ranks in my top 5 all-time favorite Pale Ales."
"Somewhat hazed, copper color with a thinnish but surprisingly persistant head. Leaves a great lace down the glass. Aroma is hoppy and citric, with a caramel sweetness underlying. Malt sweetness hits you up front in the mouth as well, and is noticeable throughout the beer, contributing a nice nutty flavor. The dominate taste, however, is still the slightly acidic, citric flavors of the hops. They also give the beer a pleasant oily smoothness. The beer feels medium-bodied, finishes dry, and leaves you with a nice fruity/sweet aftertaste, with lingering hints of hop bitterness. This is probably more hoppy than the average Pale Ale, but this isn't an IPA or Ruination. There's a good deal going on here besides the hops, and this is a good thing. Extremely drinkable and pleasant."
"It's copper with a big head that sticks to the side of the glass. The smell is noticeably hoppy but not overwhelmingly so, especially compared to other West Coast APAs. The taste is a bit on the bitter side, with the hops beating out the malt by a length or two. I'm starting to think that it's tough to make an APA that really stands apart from the pack. This one is better than most, but it's not a knock-out."
"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. After trying some of Stone's ""bigger"" beers like Ruination, Double Bastard and the Russian Imperial Stout this one seems tame by comparison. I found both the aroma and the flavor to be rather subdued. More malt character than the typical APA but still not a bad brew. A good intro to the Stone line."
"One of, if not the best pale out there.  Yum.  A big thanks to Murph for sending this my way."
"Slightly hazy, very deep reddish amber/copper in color with a creamy bone-white head that holds well and leaves some nice lace. The aroma is limited but offers some light fruit (berries & citrus) and a mild caramel note. The body is medium with a very fine and gentle carbonation that leaves it surprisingly creamy in the mouth. The flavor starts lightly sweet and fruity, reveals some biscuity caramel malt and bright citrusy hops as it warms in the mouth, and finishes dry with a lingering sweet & fruity citrus maltiness. Well balanced. The bitterness is appropriate for the style but not-overdone and the maltiness & tight carbonation are exquisite. This beer caught me off guard. I was expecting something more ""full throttle"" from Stone's. But then it occured to me... of course they have a more straightforward beer! It's their flagship (and they do make the Smoked Porter as well). And, I actually loved it because it wasn't abusively hoppy. If it was, what would be the point of having all of their other, more aggressive beers? This is easily my favorite beer from Stone! Well-rounded, fruity, and highly drinkable."
"Pours lighter than the Levitation, and not the big hop aroma right off the bat. Fair head that fades quickly, but laces through the bottom of the glass. Smooth creamy mouthfeel and a nice malt, hop mix at the end that makes it very drinkable. A good session beer, more hops would have made it a little more thirst quenching. Again a nice offering from Stone."
"The Fourth Stone Beer I have reviewed, the 4 empty Bomber Bottles now take pride of place in my Kitchen. This is Stones best seller apparently  I cant think why"
"Beautiful off-white head that stays, and leaves a good amount of lace when it does go down.  Orange/copper color.  Fruity and citrus aromas take charge of the nose, specifically a tangerine-like aroma.  With a taste comes more fruity hop bitterness that is just a notch above the biscuit-like malt flavors that accompany it.  Fruity in the front and bitter in the back.  Leaves the characteristic rind-like bitterness on the edges of your tongue.  Definitely aimed at the hophead, but still well-balanced and extremely drinkable.  This is becoming one of my favorite pale ales."
"Great tasting beer, full of smooth flavor one would expect from a solid pale ale...Very well balanced between malt and hops (maybe a little more hop, but who cares?). If this were a mass-marketed beer, it would be a top five seller..."
"Soft spicy/husky hop aroma...orangish with a soft creamy lace..nice mellow creamy mouthfeel...some nice fruitiness...very drinkable...thirst quenching...sweet maltiness...one of, if not THE best tasting pale ales I've had...My first stone experience is a GRAND one!!"
"A nice amber with orange highlights.  A nice white head that dissipates fairly quickly.  Very nice herbal and grapefruit tones in the aroma.  Really nice maltiness in this pale ale.  A caramel maltiness I think.  A good bitterness too.  I usually prefer highly hopped pale ales, but this doesn't seem overly hopped and I love it.  This is probably the best balanced pale ale I've had.  Excellent."
"Notes: A richly hopped brew that takes pride in the west coast style ... definite good drinking here for a seasoned hop head, might be a bit too much for someone that wants a balanced pale ale."
"I thought I'd give this a try snce I had heard good things about this brewerys products. On the second sip the taste was empty, almost watery. I think I might have a bad batch although there was decent head retention and lace on my glass? I might take it back and exchange it.  THE ""good"" sip featured a nice hoppy tang though it did taste similar to other west oast ales. All in all nothing special and a bit of a letdown"
