"Auburn with thin white head. Thin biscuit nose and flavor with thin malt base. Lite mouthfeel. Overall ok."
""
"Got it fresh on Oahu - tasted more like a lager than an ale. Would've liked a little more hop flavor to balance the malt."
""
""
""
"O - It is what you want out of a pale ale and it is a very chill beer. If I did this review on the beach, I'd really get into it. Overall, can't complain about it. I would have this again."
""
""
""
""
"Delicious pale. Smooth and crisp with the right amount of flavor"
""
"Pours a deep amber, copper colour.   A very smooth, pleasant pale ale with little hoppiness or bitterness"
""
""
""
""
""
"Might be old but it sucks"
""
""

""
""
"Overall - Never been a fan of Kona mainly because I had found their hoppy offerings underwhelming, and this fits into that category.  But, this was part of a mixed pack I received as party ransom, and actually enjoyed their lighter beers,  Last one to try is Castaway IPA.  3.5 paws."
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
"Very well balanced. Not overpowering on either front."
"like this pale ale not to hoppy"
"The beer is not that great."
""
"12 oz 7 month old bottle.  Pours orange with foamy white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of pale malt, caramel and herbal hops.  Body is medium and slightly crisp.  Herbal, piney hops, caramel and bready malt and some fruit fill the mouth.  Finish is long and dry.  Average brew."
""
""
"This pours a semi-clear color with a slight off-white head. The aroma is slightly malty. The taste is bold with malts yet has quite a bite to it. Fairly easy drinking with a smooth flavor and a toasted finish. Quite nice overall."
""
"A mild hoppy beer, pale ale"
"Finishes a close second to Boulevard's Pale Ale."

"Delicious. Would love some more!"

""
"Really solid pale ale. Nice balance between the hops and sweet maltiness."
"Heavier than normal dark American Pale Ale with a consistent bitterness throughout and even some roast.  Not a favorite."
"Not sure if the bottle I had was old, but I was not impressed."
""
"Too hoppy for my taste."
"My favorite beer from Kona for sure."

"Poured in to an IPA glass, the unique look of this beer immediately catches my eye. Despite the fact that the head disappeared about as quickly as it formed, with scant lacing to be found, I am struck by the appearance. The tangerine-grapefruit color of the beer looks almost electric when its chilled haze meets the light. Interesting. The aroma promises bright tropical fruit, with a subtle essence of pine. A little biscuity malt in the background rounds out the nose. The flavor brings sweet bread, subtle dried fruit, lightly toasted malts, and a balanced hop character. Mild pine and grapefruit. This is a well-rounded brew. The mouthfeel is on point, with just enough body and carbonation to keep this refreshing. I believe the few extra months have mellowed this beer, as I remember it being more vibrant when it was in season. As it stands, this is superbly sessionable, perhaps more so now that time has reigned in the flavors a bit. I have enjoyed it either way. It's nice to see an American Pale Ale that is not trying to masquerade as an IPA and brings it's own unique qualities. I put this near the top of my list when a Pale Ale is in order. Fresh or mellowed, it's always delicious."
""
""
"Like the label! The beer pours a rich orange, very little head and light carbonation. The aroma is malty with fresh hop overtones. Nice balance. The taste is sweet and malty at first then finishes with a light hop bite. Decent mouth feel and overall a nice offering from Kona. 6.0%ABV"
""
"Imbibed from a short beer ( pronounced  sho-aht bee-ah) glass at the Ritz in Orlando.  Nice light head when delivered.  Orange in color with a white head.  Sweet and syrupy with a light consistent hop belt.  Went great with the seared tuna appetizer, tenderest I've ever had filet main course and following cheese plate. ( switched to Cabernet for desert) Not sure if it was as good as it would be fresh on the big island, but tasty none-the-less."
"On tap nice head and lacing, very good session like IPA"

"Different type of pale ale than say a sierra... malty, caramel but with a few stages of hop flavor toward the end . very drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fruit flavors followed by a distinct readiness, caramel, and malts. Good not great pale ale, but perhaps a bit jaded as I live on the islands and can pick this up fairly cheap."

"Pour creates a thick head that hangs around.  Nice lacing.  Not a ton of flavor on the front when cold, but has an ok finish.  As it warms the flavor moves to the front, but not a lot of finish then.  Decent mouthfeel.  Not a bad beer at all, easy to drink, but not a ton of flavor.  Certainly wouldn't avoid it, but wouldn't seek it out either."

"Very close to bright clearness, but there is a little haze to it. Very soft brown color, hints of orange. Nice lace sits on the top where a nice white head used to sit. Somewhat tart in the nose, black currant and cherries, meshed with hops and wet grain feed. Alcohol right in the beginning of the taste, wasn't expecting that. Some cinnamon, and toasted grain in there as well. Really nice aftertaste, hops and crushed pepper. A little watery maybe, but really not a lot of complaints here. I'm enjoying this more than I thought I would..."

"O:  This one is a bit rough around the edges, but I'm not sure if the off flavors are intentional or due to the two and a half months it sat in it's box.  Regardless, this is a surprisingly good pale ale."

"Pours a clear medium amber with a hint of red. Normal head, lacing and retention. Light tropical nose (passion fruit) over caramel. Heavy medium bodied with a nice slick oily texture. Average carbonation level with a bit of effervescence on the finish. The taste profile is balanced between the flavors of the nose. It begins with tropical notes, flows to a bit of spice and ends with a light bitterness over caramel."

"I did as they directed and simply allowed the lava, I mean, liquid flow from the bottle and into my glass. This set up a pseudo-cascade which then settled into three fingers of dense, rocky, tawny head with good retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber (SRM = > 9, < 13) with NE-quality clarity. As the head slowly fell, it left nice lacing in its wake. Nose had a light grapefruit-citrusiness to it along with a caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was intensely citrusy and probably pushes the envelope between an APA and an AIPA. As a self-avowed hophead, this was right in my wheelhouse, but for style mavens, it might be just a tad too hoppy. Finish was semi-dry with a light caramel sweetness kicking in to better align it with its style. I now await its release in CANs."

"This is by far my favorite of the Kona beers. I was surprised that this beer was so flavorful seeing as it is a pale ale. I am not the biggest fan of pale ales but this guy is great. Pours into a glass looking just swell, smells fine tastes fantastic. Good beer I would recommend to a friend."
""
""
""
"I purchased this beer thinking that it would pair well with pizza. While I did thoroughly enjoy the beer overall, it did not pair well. The initial smell and taste were fantastic, but the beer was heavier than I anticipated. I will more than likely purchase this beer again."

"O: This is without a doubt, the worst excuse for a beer I've ever had. It makes Rolling Rock taste good. I'm glad someone gave it to me to try, and that I did not actually spend any money on it. Heat may have gotten to this bottle, but even taking that into consideration, it still has no redeeming qualities. I'd give it an even lower rating if I could. Avoid."
""
""
""
"I had this on draught in Maui, where it was presumably brewed at the Kona brewery, and I remember, while I had pretty low expectations, I was more impressed with the toasted barley flavor and crispness of this APA. In this form it is still totally drinkable, if unremarkable."
"Overall: solid beer. Can drink a few of these. No particular element jumps out and grabs you, but tasty just the same. Worth a try."

"O> This APA's flavor profile was just a bit too malty without enough hop balance for my tastes. I enjoyed this beer but with the ample selection of APA's in Oregon I will probably not be returning to this brew anytime soon."

"o, not a bad beer but seems to be lacking a little something. Cant quite put my finger on it. Good gold color and a nice head that slowly melts away with light lacing. Smell is light. Taste is good with a slightly fruity start and a light bready finish. Some light hop ending. A little more kick would take this beer to the next level. Nice job, though !!!"

"No matter: This one is definitely (at least) average for the style, and probably better than average. Definitely worth a shot if you haven;t tried it yet, and it might even become a go-to for someone who hasn't yet written-off all of the beers brewed by CBA.."

"Nice bottle design. Pours a nice copper color from a bottle into a pint glass. Head thin and doesn't linger. Aroma of lemon, raspberries, caramel, resin and alcohol. Refreshing initial alcohol that smooths into a decent amount of biscuity-malt and hops bitterness, ends with slight alcohol heat. Mild bodied. Easily drinkable and enjoyable. Would appreciate a little more taste depth, but for a simple pale ale this is quite good, and would be happy to have it again."
""
""
"I can't lie...I tend to think many pale ales are boring and lack character...that can not be said of this Kona brew. It's wonderful to look at and even better to drink...full of creamy, sweet in depth flavors...this is a very good PA...probably one of my favorites. Cheers!"

""

"O - easy to drink. This would an excellent introductory beer for someone looking to make the transition from macro lagers into craft."
""
""
"In my opinion, this bear wasn't bad but not super great either. Just OK. I like Pale Ales and there's a nice amount of hops to this beer without being overly bitter. There's definitely a bit a malt too. The Fire Rock Pale Ale is very easy to drink, and would probably be a lovely addition to any summer tiki party."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma-flavor is fairly delicate, with mild citrus and floral hops and a semi-sweet malt backbone. Very clean in the aftertaste, with just a touch of sweet, sour and bitter on the back of the tongue as well as a bit of crispness. Overall, an easy drinking and flavorful beer."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 12/3/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, pear, light caramel, biscuit, honey, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop and malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, pear, biscuit, light caramel, honey, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal earthiness. Light earthy floral/pine bitterness; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange/lemon zest, pear, biscuit, honey, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of citrus hops with malt sweetness; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale ale. All around well balanced citrus hop and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O: I enjoyed the minerally characteristic of this brew. It comes off as a peppery/flintiness that just makes that beers finish fantastic. Great drinkability."
""

"Not a bad beer, just not the approach to the style that I prefer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Edit: After drinking a few more mouthfuls I can get more hops and bitterness than at first. It actually seems true to style or maybe a little more malty than I would like but it seems more true to style after a few gulps."

"Overall, I really liked this beer. I'm a big fan of pale ales and this one hit the spot. Went down smooth and had a great after-taste. I'll be picking up more soon!"
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: When first poured I simply thought this was like so many other APAs I've had. As it warmed up and got more balanced and the Mango flavor came out, I liked it more and more and drank it down fairly quickly. Quite a drinkable brew - I could easily have another one without batting an eye. Went well with dinner (pepper + wine sauce chicken, buttered carrots) and I think it would go well all by itself or with other meals as well. I'll have to pick this one up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was surprised overall by this beer. For a Pale ale i was not expecting it to have such a variety of flavor. Ranging from hop-forward to sweet breadyness. Deffinetly a good brew."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Deep hue, fair head, and some persistent albeit light lacing. Nose is piny with a nutty character. Crisp pine hop with bitter nut shell, and a steely finish. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"Kona Brewing Fire Rock Pale Ale ---3.5/5"
""
""
""

""

"Bottle into pint glass. Nice copper color, very minimal head but leaves good lace. Offers a decent hop flavor. Not much for aroma going on. I thought the mouthfeel was a little better than okay. I'd say overall it is a little better than average. I probably won't go out of my way for it but if someone is offering or the variety 12-pack is on sale next summer, I may pick it up. My wife likes the Wailea that comes in the pack."

""
""
""

""
""
"Not sure what makes this ""Hawaiian-style"" but it is a great APA."
""
"O-good hop taste that made this beer very good"
""
""
"Overall: This is pretty good. I wouldn't see anything wrong with picking up a six pack of these from time to time. Nicely balanced and flavorful. Its almost like a light IPA, especially as it warms; the orangey hop flavors become much more pronounced. I'm sure I'll have this again."

""
""

"This is a somewhat complex but not a ""blow me away"" type of Pale Ale. It is a solid Pale Ale even though it has a low hop content. However, without the 'in your face' hops this brew might make a good ""session"" brew."

"Carmel colored body, almost too dark for a pale ale, quickly dissapating head that left very nice lacing around the glass. Nose was nicely balanced between fruity, citrus hops and toasty sweet malt. Great mouthfeel with medium body and carbonation; the taste follows the nose with sweetness from caramel malts, biscuity nutty flavor, lightly roasted malts, hop flavor is floral forward and floral/fruity back. A tasty and satisfying ale that is a cross between a pale and amber, color and flavor wise."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'm not sure if it is because I'm starved of the good american craft beer scene out here in Japan, but this was much better than I remembered it. Don't drink it too cold, and the flavor is fantastic. And for those reviewing this who say it doesn't have enough IBU's... try an IPA, this nailed my pale ale fetish."

"This particular brew - the Fire Rock Pale Ale - is for the most part good. Looks great in the glass, has a nice white head and staying power. But for a pale ale, which I'm admittedly not a huge fan of pale ales, has the strongest of aftertastes I have ever experienced. If you put that aside, it really has a nice pale ale taste - bold and refreshing - definitely a good summertime brew to share with good friends and during relaxing times."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall. Pretty solid APA. Great bready notes that has some good sweetness. There is a nice herbal and grassy hop note that is also slight piney. Pretty good brew."

"Pours out to a creamy white head and moderate lacing. Color is a brilliant orange copper. Aroma is hop dominant, with citrusy hops and crystal malts to balance. Flavor is supremely balanced between sticky, biscuity malts and citrus/floral hops. Bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky and I am liking this. Overall, a tasty, rich but sessionable APA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Good beer. Very well balanced and moderately complex. My first exposure to Kona left me underwhelmed, but I'm beginning to become a fan. Considering that they are partially owned by Anheuser-Busch, (along with their sister brewery Widmer Brothers) they continue to crank out some pretty good stuff."

"Overall, it's a pretty good beer. Probably misclassified as a pale ale, but whatever. Brown ale might be a better description. Once you get past the look and commonplace smell, it's an easy beer to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a hazy bronze color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes into sparse lacing within seconds. The aroma is of grapefruit, and pine. I feel like I've smelled this same aroma dozens of other times. The taste is similar to the aroma, and leans heavily toward the sweet side of things. In fact, I detect virtually no bitterness whatsoever. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lower than optimal carbonation, and a sticky texture. Overall, this is a pretty mundane pale ale that I will pass on next time."

"O- The fizz and hop bitterness is about all there is making it not very sessionable and a bit one-dimensional. The hops are mostly bitterness and no any flavor or aroma to them."
""
"Fir Rock Pale Ale is more of an amber if you ask me. But I won't judge based on that; it's a good beer. It is interesting and something different - ""Hawaiian-Style"" I suppose. I can appreciate a beer that breaks from the norms and even the definition of such a broad style. Notes that bring to mind sweet oatmeal with raisins are balanced out by just the right amount of hops. This is far less bitter, or refreshing, than your typical SNPA model."

""
""
"Overall - an ok pale ale."
""
""

"Mouthfeel: This is the best part of this IPA. Very round and drinkable. I am having this in a cold Danish march with a foot of snow outside. However, I believe that this IPA will truly prove its worth on a warmer summer day."
""
""

""
""
""

"Overall impression: An immensely drinkable, complex, and refreshing pale ale. Seems a bit heavier handed on the malt than what I'm used to but really enjoyable. Nicely done."

"Aloha!!! Trying the Kona Brew Fire Rock....its decent. The beer pours a nice clear copper with a finger thick white head that is leaving a lace. The smell is mostly caramel type malt....not much hops. The taste is a well balance pale ale, but the malt is more pronounced than the hops. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a tasty beer and would be good to session."
""

"O- A very good fruit forward pale ale with lots of tropical hop flavors, fitting I suppose for a brewery in Hawaii."

""
"Taste-Toasted malt, herbal and floral hop notes, citrus -rind bitterness snakes in and out balanced by caramel and a bit of mineral essence. Very tasty and exceptionally well-balanced. Nothing over-the-top, just classic American pale. Excellent flavor and character. Great with a hunk of aged white cheddar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ted Nugent sets rocks on fire. Get used to it. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper topped by a finger of lightly off-cream foam. The nose comprises mild pine needles, mild caramel, and light orange rind. The taste brings in more of the same, with more orange and a touch of flowers. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a nice, if not altogether distinguished, brew. 'Nuff said."
""
""
"This is a bare bones pale ale for sure, but some of the hoppy characteristics are different here, definitely in ways that I haven't found in the APA style before. While not in-your-face in any way, indeed, its balanced nature is what I enjoy about it. I will try more beers from Kona Brewing Co. in the future."

"Poured a clear amber with a one finger white head that receded to a ring of white lace. It looks like a typical filtered American Pale Ale, not bad, but not really the point of the beer. Scents of citrus pith, grapefruit, pine, light floral aromas and tropical fruit. Not near as intense as in a standard West Coast IPA, but a very similar, more nuanced and subdued version of the scent profile. Quite nice. Taste is mildly bitter, with pine resin, grapefruit pith, some faint grassy and floral hop notes, and a bitter finish. There is a nice, yet subdued caramel malt backbone keeping the flavor balanced. It's not too sweet, nor too bitter, very true to the style. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a semi-drying finish. It's nice and easy to drink, but maybe a bit too light and a little too drying, overall quite nice though. Overall this is a pretty good pale ale. It's not the best in it's style by a long shot, but it's not bad and a good choice when nothing else is around."

"Toasted, biscuit and cracker malts. some what syrupy palate. Malt sweetness is well balanced by the earthy, orange bitterness from the hops. Crisp feeling on the finish. Pretty easy to drink and session."

"Very run of the mill stuff."

"A below average pale ale. No real flavor and the mouthfeel was too fizzy."

"This pale is pretty malty. I also get some unusual/earthy spice... almost like nutmeg or cinnamon. The balance is a little off, but this is a pleasurable flavor on the whole."

"Overall this kind of reminds me of Stone Pale Ale. It's malt-forward, and hoppy, but not overly hoppy. It's not going to get confused for an IPA, which is fine by me in a pale ale. I bought this as a single to try/review but I would certainly be happy to buy a sixer of it."

"Bottle from a six pack. This pours a light copper orange with small white head. Smells fruity, tropical, with some caramel from the malt. Taste of pineapple, not much hop bite, slightly sweet on the palate. Pretty decent goes down easy with medium carbonation and relatively light mouthfeel. Solid summer beer, but not the bite I was hoping for."
""
""
"O-not exactly what I want from my pale ales. It's a bit too fruity. It's not a terrible beer, but this is quite girly for an APA. The flavors are fairly watery as well. Even tastes somewhat adjunct. I like a lot of Kona beers but this was a let down."

"Fire Rock Pale Ale is a beautiful color, somewhere between copper and golden brown. It's head is off-white and frothy. There is a slight haze to it and carbonation is noticeable. It smells great- I am picking up pineapple, grapefruit, as well as some nice malt sugars. The citrus scent is also present, as advertised. Wow, this is a magnificent APA! Great balance of fruity notes, toasted malts, and unique hops. This beer coats the mouth nicely and the sugary taste fades out to a somewhat dry finish. Medium bodied and slightly warming on the way down. When I first tasted this on tap at Firewaters in Atlantic City, I thought it was almost hoppy enough to be like an IPA, but I am not getting that at all this time from the bottle. Overall, a real treat... do not hesitate to buy!"

"Mouthfeel is very nice- medium bodied, full carbonation, sweet finish. This a pretty decent pale ale, but not really hoppy enough for me."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a red color with a small white head that leaves some lacing. Smells of piney and flowery hops and light malt. Tastes of bitter piney hops and slight alcohol, along with some darker malt with slight caramel flavor. Beer is medium body, good carbonation, and finishes nicely. Overall, an above average beer."

"O: A slightly hoppy fairly balanced beer that I could enjoy with a steak or a creamy comfort food meal or all on it's own, pint after delicious pint."
"Malt dominates and hop presence is buried but carbonation is nice. Crisp for what's there... this is a brew I would try again, but because the hops played second fiddle, I wouldnt go out of my way to do so."

"O: This is one of those beers that you cant put your finger on it, but you know its pretty good. Very tropical in texture and flavor, something that is the signature of Kona Brewing."
""
""
""
""
"I found this Pale Ale to be very typical with a slight bit of complexity. I wouldn't put this one above SN Pale Ale, but it was certainly inline."
"O - A very good APA that is a good counterpoint to maltier Pale Ales and is recommended as a session beer, especially if you like hoppier beers. A little more fizz and it would be truly amazing."
""
""

"Overall: Very enjoyable. An excellent session beer and great for warm weather."

"The only ""Hawaiian"" pale ale I have tried before is a decent Ontario concoction brewed with pineapple juice (Spearhead). I expected something similar but this is a true American pale ale and is a much nicer surprise. Definitely a beer I would recommend."
""
""
"Overall- A well executed pale ale. I enjoyed the aromas and taste form this brew. This is my first Kona Brewing offering and was impressed. A definite try while in Hawaii."

"A slightly different take on a traditional pale ale. Kona brewing has been in my rotation recently. I have not been disappointed in the least. A crowd pleaser for sure."

"Rather nice, but falls short of exceptional. Pretty heavy on the malt, while the aromatic hops seem indistinct and lacking in presence (especially in the taste). The body is good, and it has a pleasing spicy quality. Surprisingly dark for a pale ale. Overall, a highly drinkable ale that goes down easily but is unlikely to leave a lasting impression. Worth sampling."
""
""
""
"O: More then decent stuff. I could drink a few of these in a night, no problem. I'm finding myself warming to many of these Kona offerings, as I may have judged this book prematurely by it's CBA cover. Recommended."

"FYI Kona comes from Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, not Hawaii, contrary to popular belief."
""
"Overall: It is an average pale ale. As stated above, flavors could be more pronounced and a little more hops would not hurt either. Overall, it is a decent attempt at the style."
""
""
"O: this is a decent brew despite the smell not having any hops. I didn't mind for my tastes. I would have this again."
""
"Copper colored with a healthy head of white foam. Just a dang solid American pale here. Mild caramel and biscuit with a balancing dose of clean hop bitters. Mint, orange zest, and bit of herb and earth fill out the hop flavor/aroma component. Clean and balanced. Classic, flagship-type pale ale that should pair with all types of food. This bottle washed down some street tacos like a champ."

"EDIT: Well now HOLD on. Roast chicken comes to the rescue of yet another beer. I mentioned that this was a beer to have while you eat, just a generic beery accompaniment that wouldn't distract, so that's what I did. Roast chicken and veg with pan sauce and this beer. Suddenly these other flavors come out. It was actually pretty tasty. Almost tasted like a pale ale. A little floral or fruity something going on. Some slightly sweet caramel. I'll give it an extra half point for that. And interestingly I had another after dinner and it was back to where it was before, nothing wrong but nothing interesting. I feel like trying all beers with roast chicken now. Try it!"

"Overall: under hoped even by an APA standard."
""
"Overall - A really nice pale ale. One of the better ones I've sampled so far."
""
"Cheers!!"
"O: Overall an average drinking pale with nothing that really stands out or grabs your attention. Think they missed the mark here, a light drinking crisp pale with some tropical fruitiness (pineapple, mangos, kiwi) both on the nose and flavor might have been a bit obvious and expected, but would of served much better the locale then this ordinary tale. Some level of hop awareness but the flavor remains mundane and could of better represented."
""
"O- A decent APA. Worth a try, but I don't see this one replacing all the SNPA and Headwaters in my fridge. Cheers."
""
"O - A really good pale ale that I'd have again. Glad to see more Kona in NY."
"Overall, this is a beer you need to try. Me? I'm going to stick to my Back Forty Naked Pig Pale Ale. This isn't my forte, and the taste is just to underwhelming to be a repeat purchase. A solid brew, but not one I'll visit often."
""
""
"Overall - I was not a fan of this beer the first time I tried it a good 5 years ago. I avoided it for the next 4, and then on a whim, I tried it again about a year ago. It was much better than I remember. Not my favorite PA, but it's certainly far from the bottom of the pack, and it does have unique qualities which make it stand out from your average pale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – This is a nice drinking beer. It has a good smoothness with many nice characteristics."
""
""
"Early on in the pint, I briefly considered drain-pouring simply to spare myself the calories. But once I decided not too and set about going through my day, I quickly found the glass near-empty. So obviously it wasn't all that bad, regardless of all-of-the-above."
""

"O- a decent brew from Hawaii. i would def hav one again. It is a good pale ale."

"Fire rock pours a light amber with a nice little head that sticks on top well. Smell is a nice interplay between caramel malts and hops that results in a fruity sort of impression. yeast esters and a slight citrus twang behind it all. the taste is a very nice balance of those rich caramel malts and a firm bitterness, and slight hop flavor. Full flavored for sure, with an emphasis on the malts, but the hops stick around as well. It's medium bodied and has a hearty feel to it. Overall, a well balanced, slightly malt forward, but hoppy enough pale ale. Quite good."
"as i enjoy mostly big beers, this is like drinking a light beer now. could make a decent session beer for some i suppose."
""
"Would recommend it."
""
"Solid and very drinkable beer. Did not scream ""pale ale"" to me as it didn't have the strong hops I've come to expect, which was a pleasant surprise. Smooth to drink and a solid taste, but nothing flashy. I would drink this again, but I don't know that I will crave it. A good intro to Kona's offering and enough to make me willing to try some more of their stuff."
""
""
""
""
"O: Probably wouldn't try this beer again or recommend it to anybody, but I sure didn't mind it for watching basketball."
""
""
"O – Pretty damn good. If you like some malt in your pale, this would be a good choice and I feel it makes this brew stand out a little. Nothing here to make this a “must buy”, but it really doesn’t have any glaring weaknesses either. A solid pale ale."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is creamy and easy-drinking. The body is smooth and drinkable but slightly watery in the finish. The carbonation is well hidden but could use a bit more strength during the swallow."
""
"I found this to be a pretty tasty rendition of an APA. Pretty light on the hops to be honest, but the flavor that it has is pretty delectable and I find that that's what really matters in the end."
""
"O: Quite drinkable, sweet with a nice level of bitterness."
""
""
"Overall - I was impressed with this beer. A solid pale ale that seems to bring a good amount of malt balance. Very good."

"It has a nice amber color body, no head but a little bit of lace around the edge of the glass. The smell is malty and with some slight citrus hops. The taste is of malt first then some bitter hops with a pepper after taaste. The mouth feel is very nice and crisp. Overall this is a good pale ale and i would drink it again."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O: Glad to see Kona with this offering. Will try again"
"Overall Impression- A very refreshing brew from Kona but could have used more hops! More like an English Pale Ale but still enjoyed. Have had before on-tap and wanted to see if it reminded me of the past time. Unfortunately, nothing rang a bell. Enjoyed nevertheless and wouldn't mind starting off the night with one of these!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing, with a slick feel across the tongue, a medium body and very light carbonation that is just above watery. This was easy to drink, but the flavor needs a hop boost."

"No length, light , unchallenging but would make a reasonable starter for the craftbeeroskeptics out there who need to be weened off corn and rice beers."

"I remember drinking this beer by the pool during my honeymoon in Maui... however, I think it tastes a little better in paradise. Not bad by any means - still a very good APA."
"D - not bad, a bit heavy for the style with a darker malt profile than most pale ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"I grabbed this because I'd never had a beer from Hawaii before. Started off pouring a meager 1/8"" off-white head which vanished immediately. Very little smell at first, only some mild malt, and not much more even after warming. Appearance is a slightly hazed copper or apricot color. Taste, although alright, was only marginally more than a BMC to me. Granted it had more body than BMCs. Anyway, it's a plenty drinkable beer, and it's cool it's from Hawaii, but otherwise I don't really see anything exceptional to it."

""
""

"Dr: Quite drinkable, but also forgettable. Even fans of the style won't find this particularly appealing. I'd try it on draught, but Kona needs to step up their game if they want to really make good beer."

"This beer was my 2nd on my vacation. It hit the spot after a long day."
"Even if that does also mean forgettable."
"A good tasty pale ale, even flavor and balanced body, nothing to write home about but certainly wouldn't turn my nose up at it either. A worthwhile brew."
"Kona Fire Rock Pale Ale: Why drink beer brewed in Hawaii when you live in Colorado? Good question with no answer. The Fire Rock, once in the glass has a burnt copper color which is translucent, thin white head that fades and just a whiff of aroma. The flavor is mostly roasted malt, with not much hop or bitter coming through. Hops must be expensive in Hawaii! Anyway, the Fire Rock is an easy drinking ale. My tastes would prefer some more hops and complexity."
"A very good beer."
"O - Eh, nothing special, quite a bit of better apa's to be found easily."
"Overall. Good pale ale. Noting too exciting, but a solid pale for sure."
"Tasty, but far less hoppy than other pale ales, Fire Rock is an easy drinker and pleasing, but not stunning."
"O- A pleasant departure from typical pale ale. Could maybe use a little more bitterness; but it's clean, refreshing and sessionable. I reckon it'd make a good palate cleanser. If I ever am fortunate enough to find my self in Hawaii I know one beer I'll order with dinner."
"Pours a hazy brown with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of bread/biscuit-like malt and some subdued hop aromas. Taste is of citrus zest and floral hops up front with a solid malt backbone. Mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pale ale with a nice balance between the malt and hops in the taste."
"Overall - A pretty decent APA - nothing groundbreaking just a good, clean well made APA... recommended..."
"O: I normally do not associate beer with Hawaii but what the heck, this is good stuff. Looking forward to trying other Kona beers."
"D - Very decent beer. A little sweet, and a little lacking in hops. A very nice malty pale ale."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking golden yellow color. The head was fluffy and white. The lacing is decent but nothing too great. The smell of the beer had a good amount of hops and malts. The taste was nicely balanced. The malts were sweet and the hops were lightly citrusy. The mouthfeel was crisp, clean and refreshing. Overall this beer is pretty good. I enjoyed it."
"O – A solid pale ale."
"The taste is a bit better than many other American Pale Ales I've had, but it still has many of the unpleasant flavours that I don't like in my beer. Namely, apricot, grass, wheat-like flavours, and a bit of yeastiness. The good thing about this beer is that it's got some sweet maltiness to balance it. Many pale ales are light in colour, body and flavour to bring out those nasty hop flavours, allowing them to even further dominate the beer. Luckily, this beer has some balance."
"On tap at Lisa's Pizzeria in Rodanthe, NC. Pours a deep golden color with a minimal head. Aroma is sweet and slightly bready. Flavor is clean but complex with a distinct, almost fruity caramel followed by a dry but not overly bitter hop finish. Unique, tasty and very drinkable."
"Copper-gold pour with a thin white head. Aroma is mostly pale malts, a bit of bready malts and a bit of fruitiness. Tastes pretty much like it smells. Flavor is clean, if not a bit mild. Not a whole lot of hop character. Slight bitterness on the finish. Maybe I’m imagining it, but it does taste sorta ""Hawaiian"". Maybe there’s some pineapple in there? Overall not bad. I wasnt really expecting much from a Hawaiian brewery but this is a pretty good session ale."
"O - very pleasant and easy drinking, especially on a hot day. A fruity but low-hop PA."
"Pours out with hardly any head at all and quickly dissapates into no head at all. Very bright copper color, Shows alot of carbonation at first than dies down rapidly. Smells very sweet which throws you off when you take your first drink and get the overwhelming bitterness of an IPA, not what i normally expect in an APA. This beer is very smooth going down, that was probably my favorite part of this beer. Overall my opinion is biased based on the fact i am not the biggest fan of this bitter of a beer but if thats your cup of tea than i would suggest it to you. I am a fan of Kona's longboard and other beers so just shop around their different selections. overall a great brew just not mine."
"Pleasantly surprised"
"very metallic and too many off flavors here to make this enjoyable. behind all of this, i can taste a decent pale ale. not something i would ever come back to or recommend."
"O: not bad, woulda liked more hop character."
"O: A good APA. Sweeter with more of a malt presence than the average APA."
"I thought there was just a bit more alcohol in this than what it was in actuality. It wasn't so much in the taste, but in the warmth that I could feel it. Like a few others, I was disappointed to find out that Kona's beers are brewed on the U.S. mainland but nevertheless, this is certainly worth a shot since there's nothing quite like it on the shelf at your retailer. Those who like darker and moderately stronger Pale Ales with a good mouthfeel and mild flavors will delight in this beer, just like I did!"
"The mouthfeel adds to the disjointed theme of the beer with a super solid bitterness that doesn't have the flavor to back it up. This could be a great beer but it just comes up a little short. I'm happy to have tried it but wouldn't come back to this APA."
"Orange-amber color with a very small white head. The aroma has some orange and mango notes as well as some bread and biscuit malt. The flavor is orange citrus, as well as some flowery and perfume-like hops, mixed with biscuit malt. Low bitterness. The mouthfeel is about medium and the carbonation is pretty low. Decent."
"Bottle marked Mar2311-15:36 NH. The pour is amber-copper with a quick fizzy head that dissolves almost instantly. Roasted caramel malts and some light hops are noted in the aroma. The body is thin but not watered down. There is a solid malty character in the taste with a slightly dry hopped ending. But there is this faint berry like fruit character in the background."
"Pours out a rich amber color with a finger thick head that takes a good long time to melt, with lingering lacing. The smell says ""HOPS!"" with some hint of malt behind it. The taste doesn't quite deliver the promise of the smell, but is still pretty good for a pale ale. Nice crisp finish with a lingering of hops on the palate that makes you go back for more. Personally, my favorite pale ale is from another brewer, but would this stop me from getting this one again, or recommending it? Definitely not. Glad I bought a sixer so I can have more.."
"Decent, but lacks body, depth. Better than the other regulars."
"O: Overall this is a pretty solid beer. Nothing spectacular, and a little light for my liking, but certainly worth drinking. I wouldn’t run out to buy more but I definitely won’t have a problem finishing this 6 pack."
"The flavor is pleasant and balanced, but tame even for style. I think Kona was going for something light enough for Hawaiian summers. The hops are piney and citric, and there are definitely enough of them - the malts are fairly overwhelmed. Fortunately for drinkability, it's well carbonated and finishes clean enough."
"Very sessionable pale ale, falls nicely in the middle of American and English styles. Ultimately very balanced and satisfying."
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer presents a ruby highlighted copper coloring with a thick, smooth, foamy white head. The beer has caramel sweet and nutty aromas, with a thick, cloying character. Flavors are dark roasted caramel, with coffee tones, as well. No hops whatsoever. This brew is a bit more like an amber to me. The carbonation comes through at the end of the palate. Sharp, toasted aftertaste of roasted caramel. The finish is sweet and smooth. Decent beer stand alone, but within the style, not overly impressive."
"Caramel malt base with a tight finish and some sugary sweetness. Peppery hop finish. Easy drinking, but rather nondescript overall. A middle-of-the-road ale."
"The balance of all these things combines perfectly into this very solid beer."
"Pours a nice amber with white head. Smells very citrusy and a lot of hop in the nose. The tase has the same. Tons of citrus and plenty of hops to go around. This is a very well rounded beer. Its my first kona and I will be back for more for sure. So there you have it."
"Aromatics are good. Each sip starts out promisingly, but I think it's just over-hopped with an unpleasant variety. I wish for a nicer creamy carbonation as well."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a tumbler. Bottled on 4/26/11. Pours a classic pale orange color with two fingers of frothy foam but almost no carbonation visible. Good lacing. Nose is nicely balanced between lightly sweet malt and citrusy hops with a scent of mango. Flat mouthfeel makes it seem heavier than it should. The palate hits the right bases though. A nice, slightly roasted and sweet malt contrasts with clean, fresh hops. Finish is balanced and clean. Overall, balanced the way a pale ale should be but not displaying any qualities that jump out at you."
"MO-A very solid easy drinking beer, just like an APA should be. Definitely one of the better Hawaiin brewed beers that are available in bottles/cans."
"The beer is clear copper in color, with a very small head that disappears very rapidly. Smells floral and citrusy. The taste is like the smell, floral, crisp, with a very pleasant sweetness, and less than expected bitterness for a pale ale, and a metallic aftertaste. Carbonation is on the lively side. Overall, less hoppy than expected, but very pleasant and balanced."
"O: This was a really nice APA. A ballsy take on a somewhat boring style which is exactly what I'd expect from a brew made in Hawaii. Aloha!"
"Overall it was an average beer, I would have liked a touch of bitter hops for some balance."
"In all, a good beer for a hot day (at the beach surfin hawaii or something). Not above many other APAs out there, but not far below the standard. worth a try."
"Fire Rock Pale Ale is the first beer I've had from Kona (I think, certainly the first reviewed). It's a pretty average beer for the style. There is nothing offensive, but not what I'm really looking for in a APA. Maybe I got an older bottle, but this beer is very malt forward without the hop flavor or mouthfeel that I've grown accustomed to in the best APA's--which have bright citrusy hops and toasty biscuity malt. The malt in this beer even tastes a bit oxidized and a bit too sweet/caramelly. The sweetness at the end of the beer is a little too much without the hops."
"O: Decent enough pale ale. 3.5"
"O. The brew was decent, a little sweet, and I thought it could use some more hops. It is a brew that you could enjoy a few of, hanging out with some friends."
"Overall - not a bad brew at all. Not very complex, but there is at least something there to think about."
"Pours a dark copper with a small off white head that didn't stick around. The smell was suble, sweet notes added to the hoppy backdrop. The taste was a bit more subtle, with a bitter hop flavor throughout, with the hoppy and sweet notes. The aftertaste wasn't bitter at all, the hops linger for awhile. This one wasn't very smooth, had a medium body, and good carbonation. An easy drinking pale ale, with a good flavor, worth checking out."
"I was ok with this one. Medium strength of flavor makes this hard to reach for again. It is ok and worth a try."
"Drinkability - Decent drink. Not particularly complex or interesting."
"D - This is a great APA. I highly recommended it."
"Overall this beer was decent but nothing spectacular. A little watered down and easy to drink with a decent balance of sweet and dry bitter flavor."
"D- Great drinking beer. Ive been a fan of all of the Kona beers."
"The beer was a coppery, orange color with a thin bubbly white head. Smells of herbal hops, toasted malt and is a bit lemony. The taste is just slightly bitter, there is some sweet roasted malt flavors and piney, lemony finish. This is a light-medium bodied beer with low carbonation, it has a nice lingering aftertaste. I thought this was a well rounded pale ale, the toasted malt makes it pretty interesting."
"D- nicely drinkable, but there's not much too this, it appears to be steady and well crafted, but there's just nothing too special about it."
"Kona Fire Rock Pale Ale is a cloudly light amber ale topped with a dense, marbled, bubbly off white foam. The aroma is of pine and citrus. It has a smooth, soft, medium body that leaves the mouth dusty. It has a very mellow flavor that's wooden, piny and a touch fruity. It's a nice, solid pale ale."
"D - goes down very easy. would be sessionable with a beach and some more flavor."
"Ending notes: Overall, I wasn't too impressed. It's definitely not a bad brew, but it just doesn't stand out at all."
"Have to realize this is a Pale Ale with mellow hops, not an IPA with a super hoppy character. Well balanced and more of a mellow session beer. Overall solid beer."
"Pours a hazy amber, more on the yellowish side with a small white head. Quickly goes away. Hops in the nose, some citrus and pine notes, nothing really standing out. Starts with a bit oily pine bitterness before a sweet fruity middle. Mosty orange with a hint of grapefruit and lemon zest. A modest caramel sweet malt background before another little kick of pine hops for a semi-bitter finish."
"D- Goes down easy. I could drink a ton of these if it weren't so bland. I bet this is better on tap."
"Overall: This beer is good and I'd drink it again."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"D: This beer is quite easy to drink; I could easily have several of them in one sitting."
"This had some good balance and I enjoyed it alot."
"Very good drinkability. I could sit by the pool and drink this all day. Very nice sessionable beer. Nothing aggressive."
"Pours an orange/amber color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention is decent, lacing is good. Aroma is citrusy hops (orange), caramel malt and a bit of floral hops too. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of a bit of peppery spice. The hops are the strongest flavor in this brew, but they're not overpowering. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good."
"Nice new brew I tried tonight. Not super amazing but has some good qualities for a pale ale."
"Ok beer, certainly not exceptional."
"Drinkability is pretty high. I remember drinking a bunch of these in Hawaii. But, my score is probably based on it having to travel all the way to the East Coast. Probably not all that fresh."
"All in all its nothing terrible nor is it really excited."
"Not much here to the nose, looked better than it smells. Immediately hit with straw, hay....sand? Flat and forgettable...once again not much here...it's decent, not off putting...just average. Dry finish, not much to this beer. Drinkable but forgettable. Definitely an average beer, I wouldn't go looking for this."
"D- This is a quality pale ale. Nice refreshing beer that leaves you craving another."
"D: I enjoyed this beer. Would make for an excellent intro brew for the uninitiated."
"dry feel with not much, if any fruity notes. 2.5"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the fruit throughout. There was a variety through the nose, which only expanded within the taste. Something else that was particularly nice, to note, was the balancing from the hops. In the end, this was a nice pale ale, despite some favorable liberties taken with the addition of other ingredients."
"Verdict: I went in to this expecting another average APA, but breweries like Kona are constantly reminding me that bending the rules in brewing beer can often come up with curious and exciting combinations. I recommend this based on the fact that it was something I found original. Hopheads might be a little repulsed by the beers overall sweet tooth, but I imagine that this will have more takers than givers. You shouldn't regret your purchase. B+ (3.8)"
"Mouthfeel is a bit undercarbonated and a touch thin, but the real problem that I'm having is that it just isn't a great beer. Average, and a good fall back in the case of a shortage of good craft, though I wouldn't seek it out again."
"D- A good, basic, balanced pale ale. this is a beer that is better than the some of its parts (a,s,t,m,d) and quite approachable as well."
"Not much life to the hops on the taste buds either. There's a bit of biscuity malt and some dry bitterness at the end, but otherwise this beer is just a refresher. Nothing more. Nothing less . No complexity at all. If you're at a resort and your other options are from BMC, it is worth taking refuge here. Otherwise, I wouldn't seek this out."
"This beer has a high then usual ABV, it does not hit at first but toward the end there is a bit of a smoother warm presence. It goes down easy with a little effort. A really smooth beer."
"D: A very good go to beer. Nothing too complex or too interesting, but a decent APA. Love to have this while chilling outside or watching football."
"this beer is you pretty average pale ale, it had good body to it. It was a little dry and bitter tasting but overall this was not a bad choice. It had good color to it with about a fingers worth of white head and alright lacing. This is one that im glad i tried but there are other that i would prefer over this beer"
"D- Nothing overly impressive but it has decent flavor and makes for a nice beer to drink on the beach. I sure had my fair share in Honolulu."
"Drinkability: definitely a nice beer to enjoy on the islands. Won't knock your socks off, but doesn't have to....you're in HI man!"
"D: This is an excellent APA. The key to this, as with any APA, is to get it fresh."
"[Somehow this strikes me as being halfway between American and British pale-ale tastes...]"
"Poured into a tulip. The color is a moderate orange-copper with a slight white head and not too much lacing. The nose brings some very, very mild hops along with some pale malt and light caramel. The taste pulls back so that the hops are nearly non-existent, not even to the level of a mild. Fairly light feel without really any bitterness. No off flavors and the malt is fairly nice, but not what I expect from an APA."
"Drinkability: The unfortunately is a one and done for me. I get too much malt in this pale ale with almost a syrupy mouthfeel. Not my favorite pale ale. I recommend this to those seeking a strong malt presence with a medium body."
"Poured a copper color with little to no head. Smell of floral hops and sweet malty goodness. At first sip, I immediately noticed the abundance of hop presence. Pretty hoppy for a pale ale, which I love! The beer is not too heavy and I could easily throw back of a couple of these. Overall, pretty impressed with this beer."
"Aroma is floral, citrusy, sweet. Has a medium-bodied feel to it, modest hop bitterness. Taste is mostly sweet, caramel malt. I do think the carbonation is too much, though. This particular bottle is seven months old, so I will say the hops may be more dull by now. I think this is a decent Pale Ale, but nothing really great or unusual. Drinkability is pretty high, but it is 6% abv, not very heavy but moderate. Would probably go well with pizza or spicy BBQ. I'd prefer it over Bass but Sierra Nevada's pale ale is my preference."
"Reddish color with lacing and a rim of foam. Mild hops and gentle malt hints coming off the nose. The attack is gently hoppy and there are some flavors of the grains swirling around with a malty backdrop. There seems to be some irish moss or peat flavor kicking around there as well, especially in the aftertaste. I must admit this was better than I expected. I have recently been seeing the Kona stuff at various places around the country and I was afraid it was going to be some mass produced swill that was capitalizing on the fact it was from Hawai'i. This wasn't the case and I am glad I finally purchased some to try."
"Final thoghts: Very suprised, and would reccommend to IPA and PA drinkers, and Hopheads in general."
"Yeah, we can dig the whole ""Hawaiian-style."" Complex and drinkable, the hops and malt mesh very well together and show great balance. Great stuff, Kona!"
"From the bottle, the brew looked a pale amber color with a few centimeters of foam above. Not a bad looking brew, really. Some flowery notes in the aroma are offset by a dose of fermented caramel grain. The aroma is played out on the palate with a strong grainy sweetness. Some bitterness from the hops is apparent at the end but more would be appreciated to offset the grains."
"Overall this beer goes down easy and is fairly straight forward in it's flavor profile. It didn't blow me away, but I would have it again."
"D. I could probably kill a six pack of this on a Saturday afternoon."
"This beer has average drinkability. Too much carbonation and an odd aftertaste limit it. I wouldn't purchase this beer in a six pack, but depending on my choices, I may order a pint in a bar."
"Pours a hazy orangish copper color with a two finger head which gives way to some lacing. The aroma has a faint toffee and sweet malt backbone with a some citrus hop notes over the top. The taste has a toffee and bready backbone on the back end there is a citrus hop bite with a slight floral hop. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is a solid apa not the hoppiness of some of the bigger apa's but the drinkability is well blended and very smooth."
"D: This is a very easy-drinking beer... I could have several of these easily. Unfortunately, as APAs go, it's a little on the weak side. I'd like to see some more hop flavor with this beer... that would push it into the very good territory at least."
"Drinkability: This is probably one of the only times I'll grab the lager over the pale. The flavor was kind of all over the place and lacked any real direction. Not hoppy, but not smoothly balanced...so what is it? Not sure but at least it's fairly non offensive."
"D: Easy to drink. great rounded beer. really enjoyed it!"
"D: Flavorful and balanced. Very drinkable."
"Overall: B- Almost too sweet. Not well-balanced. Could benefit from more hops."
"M/D: Moderately thick, very creamy, soft carbonation, no alcohol detected. Highly drinkable , a bit heavy, very enjoyable. Not a typical APA, not by a long shot... too creamy and not enough hops. But very tasty nonetheless. Reminds me of a Yankee Candle my college roommate used to burn, sugar cookie or something like that. I don't think the Fire Rock name fits, unless it refers to lava burning through a warehouse full of vanilla beans."
"I'd recommend this beer on a hot day on the lake. It is pretty darn hot right now. I got this bottle in a pick-6 at the store an I think I'll snag a sixes soon."
"Overall not a mind blowing pale ale but it wasn't half bad. Very smooth but not completely bland and undrinkable."
"Overall - I had my doubts about a beer from Hawaii. However, it was a nice experience. First brew from this brewery and I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: I've gone through quite a few of these since arriving on the Big Island three days ago. While not thrilling or particularly special, this is a solid pale ale. One of my favorites from Kona Brewing. Worth a try."
"Not a bad pale ale overall, more British session ale in style than anything, excepting the 6 points of booze, of course, none of which is at all evident.  And given the mainland partnerships this brewery is involved in, I'm not entirely sure that this was even brewed on the Big Island, let alone the 50th state in the union."
"Not too bad. Fairly easy drinking."
"Definitely could have had another one, thanks to the pleasant taste and easy mouthfeel. A very good experience for my first beer from the Hawaiian islands and looking forward to more from Kona."
"Drinkability is OK, not as good as I recall, although the last time I had it I was on my honeymoon so it was probably more of a situational impression."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer which tastes even better from what I remember of my trip to Hawaii in 1997. Now that this is distributed locally I will be grabbing some more."
"D: I could drink a good number of these I think. The flavor goes well with the sausage pizza that I am eating with it. At 6% alcohol, it's session-able for me."
"D) A delicious Pale Ale. Well done Kona!"
"D: Decent drinkability. I could have a few of these but the taste doesn't exactly have me longing for more. Not bad, but not a great pale ale either."
"Used to just find this in Hawaii visiting the wife's family but now this stuff seems ubiquitous, at least on the West Coast."
"All in all, not bad, plus I get to tick off another state as I attempt to drink around the world and the states of America."
"Clear orange/amber with a smattering of off-white bubbles coating the surface of the beer. Meager collar, a bit of spotty lace. Nice citrusy aroma, oranges, with a bit of malt. Sturdy bitterness, mild malt sweetness, fruity citrus, tangerine and oranges. Nicely balanced. Medium to light bodied, a bit dry, average carbonation, decent texture. Quite enjoyable. Easy drinking and nicely hopped."
"For the price and quality, you can't miss."
"The taste is very malty with some citrus bite, in the apple family. There is plenty of caramel malts in the beer, a nice earthiness to the malts, a bit drying in the finish. The beer is a touch heavier than say your typical lawnmower APA, but very drinkable nevertheless. There is a roasted quality to the malts that is also coming through and that coupled with the earthiness and caramels define this beer. The slight dryness and hop bite in the finish do not necessarily serve the beer as well. There is a combination of hops going on here, that are pulling things in different directions. This is a decent beer, not brilliant, but very drinkable."
"d - Its not bad, but it doesn't really come across as a pale ale. Almost seems closer to an amber."
"Since Kona is not regularly available, I was happy to see it at a bbq, as a friend there is the brother of one the brewers. So, needless to say, I was a bit excited...I had tried a coffee stout that was good a couple years prior. Needless to say, this pale ale under-whelmed on all fronts, sadly enough. The pour was an average coppery brown with decent head & lace, but little aroma other than a malt-hop. The flavor was a basic pale ale a la Bass when I expected more. Simple hops & sweet malts prevailed with nothing else of note...not a bad beer for a bbq, just a let down. The feel while somewhat crisp & bubbly, was dry & scratch almost, reminding me of dry grasses. While I would drink if offered, I would not go out of way to get again...."
"Still within the expected freshness period, but tastes like all the hops are gone, or maybe they were never there..."
"A decent beer. Big malt and beuatiful, but its just slightly off with this weird anise type of bitterness."
"In the end, there's too much candy (but still not sweet) to this beer."
"Label is different that the one shown. Picked up a six pack at the Longs Drugstore in Wakiki. Used a tea glass rather than the hotel glass. Nice appearance and smell. Very fruity nose and nice lacing and approx 1 inch of head which dissipated slowly. The taste is pretty good, somewhat citrus and you can taste the hops, somewhat sweeter than other pale ales. Mouthfeel is fine, not too heavy and very refreshing. Definitely drinkable, could make this a session beer. Paired it with a baby swiss and baguette."
"D: Fairly impressed with this Hawaiian beer. Overall, Kona did a good job."
"All in all, Fire Rock was a solid pale ale, tasty with a solid flavor and body on it. Although it's not the best I've had, I certainly wasn't disappointed with my choice of beer on tap for the evening."
"Poured into a pint glass and comes out a fairly dark coppery-orange. A two finger head develops and is off-white and fairly frothy. The head has decent retention and leaves behind a light coat of lacing. A small coat of white stays atop the beer with a pretty creamy ring. Smell is alright. I get mostly notes of fairly toasty, caramel malt and a bready/wheat/yeasty note. If anything, I get a tiny bit of earthy hops in there too. The aroma has decent strength but not much too it. Taste is pretty much the smell with a bit more complexity and some hops. I get the caramel malts and the bready hints. The hops come through and are a tiny bit bitter with grassy, earthy and a tiny bit of fruit to them. Once again, the malt is the prominent character here but it is a bit too caramel for me. Some citrus peel from the hops comes around once in a while as well. The mouthfeel is probably the best part of this beer. It has a moderate body with a medium level of carbonation. The creaminess is nice and helps make the beer more enjoyable. There is no warmth but a coat of bitterness stays around on the tongue with some malt flavor. Drinkability is good. The beer was one of the cheapest on the shelf, even after being shipped from Hawaii. The taste is decent as well. There really are no bad flavors but they are not exceptional. If the malts were a bit less caramel and the hops were a bit more present I think this beer would be great. I enjoyed this one but wasn't hugely impressed with it. I could session this one and will give it a good drinkability rating."
"I poured this average beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. I also noticed it was out of date. Nobody must drink this stuff as every Kona product I have looked at recently was out of date in every store I have looked. Head was an off white and had good lacing. The amber colored beer was bready smelling and a little hoppy. Nothing to smile about here. I'm not buying again."
"F: Finishes slightly pale bitter, with a little citrus, acidity, and some more of those fruity hops. A slight sweetness that seems to stay but it also seems to dry off a bit with the pale bitterness. Despite all the nice flavor it also seems to have a nagging off flavor bitterness, some hop characteristic that I'm not really digging, or it seems more like a burnt malt bitter flavor that doesn't go well with a pale ale. I think the biggest problem is the trip over here from the brewery, which is quite a long trip, probably harsh on the beer. If I'm ever over there I'll def drop in to try some fresh."
"Not bad, but so many better pale ales out there."
"Poured a copperish color into a pint glass, with about a finger of white head and good lacing. There was a slight citris smell with a touch of caramel . The hoppy citris taste quickly turns into a sweeter malty finish. It was medium bodied and had medium to low carbonation. Overall an average beer, which has decent drinkability."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a small head. Smell is of hops, some malts. Taste is good, well balanced combination of malts and hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Drinks ok-smooth and a silky flavor help this go down well-the hints at hops are nice for flavor but aren't a block in the road for any drinker."
"The aroma was an unremarkable blend of malt and hops, with no particular highs or lows. The flavor was the same, not terrible but not notable either. The body and drinkability were both typical for the style. Overall, this a typical example of this style, you can do better, but it's Ok for a Plan B beer."
"D - Highly drinkable... Simple and straight forward isn't a mad e thing... Quite quaffable sip after sip after sip... Definately an enjoyable session brew... Nothing ""extreme"" about, just an easy drinking offering from our island friends... A job well done by Kona... I would gladly drink again (and again)..."
"Poured a nice copper color into a pint glass, with a finger of white head, little carbonation, and good lacing. The smell had the feintest hint of lemon citrus, and was instead dominated by caramel and maltiness. The taste confirmed this, with the citrus aspect fading instantly to maltiness mid-palate and through to the finish. This beer would certainly benefit from more hop balance. The body was thinner than expected, given the smell and flavor, but after all, this is a pale ale. The thinner body did help this beer's sessionability. I wouldn't mind sitting down and throwing a few back."
"D - Not a bad session beer, I enjoyed it."
"Mouthfeel, this is a very straightforward, lacking complexity beer. Seems a bit much to pay $7 for 6 of these, they are very standard, easy to drink and all. These are something to give to non serious beer drinkers to segue into something better."
"Pours a brownish amber in color with nice fluffy, faintly off-white head. Smell is forward of floral hops and bready malts with a hint of carmel and pine resin. Taste is very malt forward, heavy in the bread and carmel department. Floral hops take a backseat and faint hints of piney hops as well. Medium body, slightly oily feeling. More akin to an English IPA in terms of the malt/hops balance. Decent beer."
"Poured an orangish /amber with good carbonation and a small dirty head. Nose is floral, nutty nose, slightly hoppy and malty. Taste is bready malt profile and predominantly sweet with a little hoppiness in the finish. Easily drinkable but pretty heavy due to bread and caramel."
"D: Good over all, but forgettable. A decent session beer, but I probably would choose other options over this one."
"12 ounce bottle, a buddy brought some island brews back for me on a recent trip to Hawaii. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours an orange/amber color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention is decent, lacing is good. Aroma is citrusy hops (orange), caramel malt and a bit of floral hops too. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of a bit of peppery spice. The hops are the strongest flavor in this brew, but they're not overpowering. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's enjoyable to drink. I think it's a good balanced beer, not a bad choice as an occasional session brew."
"Drinkability: Seems like a cross between an American Pale Ale and Amber Ale due to the malt focus and restrained bitterness. Regardless of what it is, this is my go-to Hawaii beer - refreshing, very drinkable and with a good amount of flavor."
"Mouthfeel is medium, slight carbonation. Drinkability is good, decent pale ale here."
"D - Very good beer and low in abv. Makes you feel warm and cozy like you are in Hawaii."
"In a pint glass, this is a fair match for any hot weather activity. Fire Rock is probably best with hot dogs and coleslaw."
"Hazy copper/orange in color with a finger of slightly off white head that quickly thins to a mere veil over the brew. There's floral hops, oranges, lemons, and roasty malts in the aroma. The taste is much the same as the smell only slightly more pronounced. The lemon was also absent in the taste. This is a good sessionable and refreshing beer. Nothing even remotely offensive about it. Had a nifty bitter tone at the finish. This would be a great gateway beer for folks wanting to get into craft brews."
"Overall, good beer, but when drinking beer in Hawai'i, what can be better? Anyway, Cheers!"
"Try this on tap!!"
"Overall, its ok. I prefer my APAs to have more of a hop kick to them than this one had. Worth a try the next time you're in Hawaii though. Cheers."
"D - Not a bad session. Could have several at a time with enjoyment."
"Note: Born on date was four months before this review."
"This taste like a safe beer / middle ground beer. Could please FYB tastes and tolerable for real beer tasters."
"pour is orange without murk and some sticky white head. nose is mild citrus fruit, apple malt, and yeast. palate is not much else than that. a bit peppery dry and quite yeasty... weak malt character... that give the beer yeasty, bready quality a bit of a fingernail. carbonation is a bit sharp also."
"D: Not bad, not quite mellow enough for a session beer but tasty enough to have a couple."
"Easy to drink, but too light. Been a while since I've had an APA with such weak hops."
"M/D - A medium bodied brew with a pretty heavy malt taste. I didn't notice any real sweet taste sine I thought the citrus smell was on the light side. This was the last of a 4-pack of brew that a buddy brought back for me. I'm glad I had tried it but wouldn't look for it in the future. If you get the chance to try one I would recommend it but this brew wasn't there for me."
"J"
"Pours a slightly hazy, copper color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, slight citrus, and a hint of spice. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy with a low carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, and slight spice. Overall, well-blended, smooth, nice body, and good aroma."
"Good APA. Very satisfied."
"Drinkability: nothing to write home about. pretty much an average APA."
"drinkability: solid pale ale and a good alternative from a macro for beginers"
"Ale? wtf? This tastes like a fancy pbr or something. It's light and fizzy but still ok. eck, as I drink it I see how bland this is, skip it."
"Drinkability: This is an average inoffensive pale ale. I like how the ending gets sweeter, but otherwise, nothing jumps out."
"Drinkability - I have 5 more, and see no problem putting these away. I would have liked more hop bite in this beer, and for some reason dont get that citrus flavor I remember from my first try. After getting through the 6 pack, that citrus flavor appeared more than I thought on my first try. A decent beer"
"All in all, a decent hoppy pale ale, best served ice cold to hide some mild astringencies."
"The mouthfeel is a little heavier without a drier finish, and the carbonation is fine. A tasty, drinkable beer but not quite what I expected from a pale ale. Perfect for an introduction to hoppier beers, in my opinion."
"As a complement to tacos this beer could does not work out so well. Virtually no head, which I will chalk up to the establishment, light amber in color and slightly cloudy. The color was a little misleading since it was much darker than I expected for a pale ale. The smell had strong hints of fruit, berries mostly and would seem more fitting for a amber ale than for a pale. The taste was the same with hints of fruit and a clean and otherwise forgettable finish. Slightly bready with a full mouthfeel but all in all I was expecting a bit more with a name like fire rock. For a breakfast beer this would have gone better with fruit pancakes than tacos. This was my first Kona beer and is not leaving me longing to try the others."
"there's nothing really wrong with it, but it's a pretty average pale ale. nothing really spectacular going on here, but my girlfriend seemed to like it once it warmed up a little, which tells me this would be a good crossover, since she really only likes Miller High Life and Kona Longboard Lager."
"D - Not a bad pale ale. Has some umph to it. I'm feelina Kona so far."
"Drinkability: A surprisingly good pale ale. I honestly picked up this beer just because it was from Hawaii not really expecting much. However, it turned out to be a great brew and one I would highly recommend."
"Picked up a single bottle from the Party Source in Syracuse. The label reads that the beer was brewed in Portsmouth, NH, by Red Hook I'm told. This was just a simple pale ale with fruity crisp hops and a slightly nutty bread crust malt flavor. It's not a bad beer, but the aftertaste is far too weak for the style. Pale ales don't need to knock you over the head with flavor, but they need some staying power on your palate."
"Extremely drinkable. Downed two of these without batting an eye. Will definitely try again."
"D - My favorite beer when I go to the islands. Ive consumed more of this beer than I should probably admit."
"A decent ale for warm weather; this ale lacks complexity and does not have a very distinctive taste. Certainly worth a try."
"The beer pours a dark golden, almost amber color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a solid malt scent that boasts of pale, Carapils, and crystal malts. There are some light bisquit notes as well. Hops are present, but mild in comparison. The taste is decent as well. It has a moderate bitterness along with a solid malt character. I'm not a huge fan of the malts used in this one. It's got a lot going on, but maybe a bit too much for a simple APA. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good beer, but nothing spectacular."
"It is bitter enough for me to feel sustained for a short period and a color that is almost like a red ale. It has a nice floral aroma and the body is pleasant."
"D: Not too bad, I was slightly surprised and could enjoy a few of these."
"D - Medium alcohol and very well rounded flavors make this a pretty drinkable beer. Good session material - more malty than hoppy, gives more of an English pale ale character for me."
"Body is slightly below medium with a slender grittyness to it that's not to off but bothersome in the first bit of the glass. Virtually simple, clean, tender, mildly sweet and toasty, and easy going enough for good drinking and could be sessionable enough to perhaps three or four."
"D- This beer is average at best. I would drink this over BMC product in a heart beat but would pass it up if other choices were present. Maybe I had a bad bottle. If I get again I will review it."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Flavor is citrus hops, little sweetness and a light bitter finish. Reasonable pale. Bottled on May 6, 2009. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a nice dark gold with a large head. Lacing on the surface and sides of the glass. Aroma is mostly grassy hops. Taste has a rounded caramel and slightly toasty malty sweetness. Herbal grassy hops in the finish with a little bitterness. Pretty well balanced. Not as strongly hopped as a lot of APA's. Medium bodied. Easy to drink and pleasant overall."
"Bought this in a beach town in New Jersey. It was the only interesting brand in the bunch so i thought I'd give it a try. I got it along with the pale lager. This was also better than i expected for how far it traveled. A very unique flavor that is both classic pale ale but also an interesting malt flavor. I can drink a lot of these, which is good because I bought a lot."
"Notes: Overall it is a nice pleasant but average Pale Ale."
"D: Not an outstanding beer, but it's an easy drinking beer that you could have a few of."
"overall its a descent beer for chilling with friends, and really adds to the ambiance if your ever in the cool beach situation."
"D - nice drinking pale ale...nothing outstanding, just really good"
"Drinkability: The iced-tea feel to this brew subtracts points, but it's not a bad brew, overall. Drinkable, but there's other APAs out there that are better."
"Good mouthfeel and very drinkable."
"D - I would drink another one of these, but I would also have no regrets with moving on to something else."
"a great light to medium body really compliments the flavor of this brew. it's just light enough to drink at any time. awesome for a hot hot, great for a night out... could be a great session beer. I could drink this for days and days."
"Light to medium bodied beer that is fairly drinkable. It's a good example of a an American Pale Ale."
"D - Quite a drinkable offering. Fairly refreshing and a pretty solid combination of flavors. This could definitely be a solid session beer on a hot day."
"Notes - A pretty representative APA."
"Happened upon this on tap at Maggie McFly's Restaurant in Brookfield, Connecticut, this was a nice golden amber color with a big off-white head and fair lacing. The aroma is subtle piny / herbal hop and caramel malt, somewhat thick and appetizing. The flavor follows suit with a mid-plus body feel, smooth and creamy with a hop blend very similar to the aroma. Add some vanilla and more caramel malt, maybe even some banana nut. Quite tasty. It is politely carbonated and easily a sessionable brew, a fine pale ale and a pleasant surprise."
"Poured dark amber, with little head and lacing. No real hint of hops, seemed more malty than anything. Tasted malty with hints of caramel, with a low hope profile. Tasty, but definitely not what I expected in a pale ale. That being said for what its worth it wasn't bad at all. Not sure if I would go out of my way to pick more up, but not a bad beer for a back yard BBQ."
"On-tap at Woody's City Market served in a Newcastle pint glass a crisp orange with a very nice frothy off-white head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice subtle amount of crisp sweet malts and citrus hops. The taste is a nice amount citrus and pine hops balanced nicely with sweet malts with a hint of caramel. The beer is light, crisp and refreshing, especially for summer. This is a very enjoyable Pale."
"OK beer, but middle of the road. Nothing stands out and makes you say wow."
"Had this for the first time at East Ave Cafe in Pawtucket RI. I was amazed at the overall balance of this beer. I can't mention one particularly good thing about this beer because it was so well balanced. The head was medium sized and lasted for a while. There was a pleasing amount of maltiness with a little caramel and the hops were light but present. Maybe a little under-hopped for some but well within the style guidelines. Overall a very tasty beer."
"New neighbor from across the street brought a six-pack of these over the other night. Poured an amber color with very little head and almost no lacing. Smell had a slightly metallic tint with some...musky bread...? Taste is pretty unremarkable... some bready and malt taste. Almost no hops prominent, which is surprising for a pale ale. Watered down mouthfeel. Not a very good pale ale."
"Drinkability: Okay. This isn't much of a pale ale. It needs a better/bigger hop profile to stand out. A decent New Hampshire brew."
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink."
"This ale from Hawaii is a tasty surprise. I picked it up from a local place just because it was from the West Coast island. Fortunately, it has a nice amber color and a bold hoppy taste. It is lacking in mouthfeel though, it seemed a bit watery. Not much in the way of aroma either."
"Mild recommendation."
"This beer pours a clear copper color with a 2 finger slightly off white head. Head retention is quite good, some thin wispy lacing is left on the glass. Nose is of caramel malts, fruits (apples and possibly pears), very little hoppiness. Taste is sweet, malty caramel that is balanced with hop bitterness, a very easy drinking beer. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, medium bodied though slightly thin with medium carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer - goes down easy, not filling. It's an average pale ale with nice drinkability."
"Big carbonation was a bit much, but still getting the hops, they did not skimp, and a tad of fruitiness. This would be interesting on cask. Fruity colour with moderate off-white head. Drinkable stuff."
"The feel is a thick and fizzy body. Dances on the tongue, then sticks around. It's drinkable enough, but too overly bitter for my tastes, without enough balance."
"The beer is clean and crisp easy to drink. Would be nice on a warm day and I feel that I could drink several of these in a sitting and not get bored or palate fatigue."
"I think this is a good, average pale ale that is drinkable. It won't knock your socks off but I've had worse."
"12 ouncer, bottled on dating etched onto the label, nice. Pours lighter tangarine amber, with a slight haze. Delicate off white head/film/lace. Mild bready nose. On the lighter side of the style flavor and hop wise. Respectable, smooth hop undercoating and a rather thin resiny hit of hops in the background. Decent sessioner, warm weather ale."
"4.0 D: With some more carbonation, this would be a damn fine brew. Good the way it is nonetheless."
"D - Taste just wasn't strong enough for me I'm used to more aggressive APAs with more hops to them I guess but if was one of the better choices at a bar I wouldn't skip over it"
"Pours a golden orange with a thin white head. Good retention,and a very nice lace. Aroma is of sweet fruit and citrus hops. Body is light to medium with some carbonation.Taste is of fruit and piney citrus hops. Hints of bready malts are also there. This is one good beer!!"
"D - this is a pretty darn good beer."
"Fire Rock Pale Ale hit the spot on the 85-degree day I tried it. I imagined having this beer ice-cold, out of a cooler, at a busy, loud beach."
"Overall: next!"
"Pours a clear, dark golden almost copper color with a thinnish off white head that sticks around for a little while. Smells of grainy malt and yeast esters. A bit of citrus pokes through, but is overwhelmed. Taste is mildly fruity with some green apples apparent. Has a crisp hop bite. Citrus and esters dominate. Has a tart finish that feels out of place. Mouthfeel is almost creamy but not quite. Body is medium, carbonation is medium to high. Not bad for a mainstream pale ale, but there are definitely more flavorful choices out there."
"Drinkability is very nice; nice beer all told, a good one to sit back and drink on the porch in summer. There are a number of APA's i'd pick in front of this one though."
"Decent enough pale - easy to see having more than a few. Mahalo!"
"I'd still like to try this from the micro in HI. Someday. Of course if anyone wants to fly me out there, I'm more than willing to travel in the name of beer. ;)"
"Its got a nice pale ale flavor, not too strong of a flavor. Smooth, crisp and refreshing beer, one I still enjoyed after consuming a few. If you are in the mood for an American Pale Ale I recommend this one."
"12oz bottle (brewed in Portsmouth, NH) purchased at Hannaford. Pours a crystal clear golden amber body with a short lived off-white head. Citrussy hops dominate with a fair bit of bready and caramel malts to balance it out. Citrussy, minty, slightly pithy hops share the flavor with some nice caramel malt. Balance is what strikes me about the flavor. Moderate in both mouthfeel and carbonation, and an easy drinker. A solid American Pale Ale, balanced and pleasant."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a while, but overall it's just an average pale ale."
"D - A very worthy session beer. I would order this at a bar."
"Mouthfeel is that of above average tap water, which is a lot better than the ""soda like"" beer you find at a lot of microbrews. Definitely a drinkable beer, just not outrageously good."
"D: Pretty drinkable, I think it would have been less drinkable if it had less hops in it, but then I suppose it wouldn't be called Fire Rock. Overall it was really nice."
"Pours a light amber/copper color with a small head. A touch cloudy. Smells fruity, malty, and slightly hoppy. Actually nice aromas coming off of this beer. Toasted malt and fruity flavors,very nice and smooth. Hop flavors are way in the background, earthy and citrusy. It was hard to taste the hops, but the bitterness does kick in on the finish to leave a nice sweet toasted malt,bitter flavor. Maybe could have used some more hop flavor, but that would make more like every other american pale ale and I actually like the flavor the way it the way it is. This is my 3rd beer from Kona (porter and lager) and I'm really impressed, they are all very well crafted....I could drink these all day."
"Sixer for $7.49."
"Pours a clear pale copper color with a dense off-white head that slowly settles. The aroma is sweet, some caramel malt perhaps, and a spicy/grassy hop. Sweet caramel malt upfront, honey, with some bitter hops in the end. Definitely more of a malty APA, quite balanced. Moderate feel, little bready, prickly carbonation, good balance between sweet and bitter. Decent APA overall, could use some more flowery hop flavor. Drinks easy, could beer to use as a change of pace."
"I also had this on tap and it tastes exactly the same. This must mean the bottling process is doing a good job."
"This could be a decent session-able back up if you're not in the mood for something more exciting."
"Meh...fairly balanced but nothing memorable."
"D: I'll order it again."
"wow, 271 reviews as of this writing. I think I'm late to the beach party! I enjoyed this over a nice stirfry centered around a spicy tropical fruit sauce. I think this comes across as a nice session brew albeit lower hopped than I've come to expect from an APA. That said, if I was in Hawaii or CA I would be happy having ordered this."
"Brew pours a copper color with a slight haze. Head is off white with good retention. Nose is tropical fruits with citrusy hops blended with toasted malts. Taste is caramel malts that are somewhat sweet balanced by a smooth bitterness that is not too overpowering. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation. Finish is refreshing. Overall drinkabiity is good as this seems to be more of an English PA style as it was more balanced to the point Da Boss could quaff it."
"Pours an amber red color, good sized head, slight yellowish. Somewhat hoppy aroma, some sweet malty aroma. Sweet taste, but different sweetness than say a honeybrown or a fat tire. Clean taste, slight sweet aftertaste. But a little watery. Refreshng. Not much taste after a while."
"I usually go for the fuller- bodied pale ale but Kona Fire Rock Pale Ale is a tasty little pale ale. The body of Kona Fire Rock Pale Ale tends toward the medium to light side and the hops offered here are not over the top, nor are they very bitter. The Galena hops contribute to a flavor that reminds me of a fine English Pale Ale and the beer is highly drinkable and very pleasant. Add to that the citrus fruit taste enhancement from the other hop varieties and you have a nice combination of flavors. It's a good pale ale choice when you want some hops but don't want an overwhelming taste of spice and bitterness."
"Drinkability- Enough body and flavor to be interesting, light enough to session."
"Quite tasty overall; a nice fruity example of the style that is well-balanced and easy-drinking. Nothing mind-blowing, but nothing less than solid, either."
"Something about the flavor of this beer is just irresistible. It has more in common with and english pale ale rather than and apa but it works perfectly. Up front are the toasted malts that give it a great slightly sweet and at the same time dry flavor, followed by a slight hop flavor and a perfect mouthfeel that makes you reach for another sip. I am not usually a fan of malt-up-front beers, but the fact that the malt in this one is not super sweet and cloying makes it perfect. Get out and try this one now, you will not be sorry!"
"Pours golden to amber color with bright white head that retains well. Nose is on the light side, with lager-like breadiness, and faint fruitiness - peaches perhaps. Palate is a mixture of bland maltiness and hops with sharpness but not much in the way of positively contributing to flavor. Slight fruit. Mineral taste too. Easy drinking."
"I enjoyed this little Pale Ale. This was also my first beer from Hawaii. Hopefully not the last I have from that state either. I bought a six pack of this beer and found out this beer really isn't that consistent from one bottle to the next. This was one of the better of the bunch. I had one or two that were yeast disasters. When you drink one, I hope you get a good bottle and not a yeast disaster."
"6/4/7/3/13 (3.3/5)"
"This is a pretty good APA. I really like how it is a little bit heavier on the malt than other APAs. This set its a little bit apart from others."
"I guess it's drinkable but I won't have another."
"Other comments: This is a tasty multi-purpose pale ale and it really does bring to mind volcanoes because of the caramelized sweetness. Maybe what happens when wort meets molten lava? That's not to say that this beer smells or tastes like sulphur, though!"
"Clear copper pour with a medium white head. Sweet malt aroma, with a hint of hops. Crisp taste with mild hops, more of the citrus variety. Wanted more of something. Kind of like an APA-lite. Not really much more to say about this beer, curse the 250+ character limit."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability: Good. Maybe a little less bitter and spicy than many American Pale Ales, but still a good representation."
"D- Very drinkable beer. Excellent pale ale. One of my favorites."
"Pours a nice crisp copper color with thin off-white head that lingers a while and leaves okay lacing. Nose is citrus hops, though not real pronounced, and the mouthfeel is slightly tingly. Taste is a nice citrus hop, that slowly evolves into sweet malt, and the finish is slightly bittersweet and smooth."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - This Pale Ale is highly drinkable, hops aren't to strong & don't linger on. So it kind of leaves you wanting more sip by sip. This is a pretty good Pale Ale, I recommend you give it a try. Cheers!"
"D: All in all this is a decent & respectable APA. Sure, there's much better examples available out there, but on the other hand you can do a heck of a lot worse."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff - a definite session beer. But one may become a bit bored with this after a few."
"Better than average IPA that suffers from a watery feel. The beer pours dark for an IPA, almost the color of an amber ale. On the other hand, the head was quite respectable. The nose is a bit weak but nicely balanced for what is there. The taste has some nice, mild hop tones with pleasing bitterness. There's an underlying tinniness to the beer which is a shame. Sometimes, I wonder if the tininess is from my glassware, but I faithfully took a sip straight from the bottle and got the same notes. The feel is really the least positive aspect of the beer. There's some carbonation but it gives way to significant wateriness quickly. I liked Kona's Pipeline Porter better, but it's close. We'll see if that Wailua Wheat can pull out a victory in the trio of Konas that I bought."
"Flavor had a nice light bitterness up front with a moderate roast quality to the sweet malty middle. Light herbal & citrusy hop flavor before the somewhat chewy finish. Moderate carbonation and a somewhat substantial body for the style"
"Had this on tap at the Cocoa Beach Pier in Florida. Poured a nice amber color with an off white head that settled into a nice cap leaving behind some nice lacing. Nice aroma of caramel malts and some fruity hops. Hops flavor is more on the grassy, fruity side rather than piney. Nice balance between the hops and malts. Creamy mouthfeel and an excellent session pale. I was happy to find this one among all the BMC beers at the bar. Good stuff!"
"Medium/full body with light-ish effervescence. Smooth, slightly crisp finish with a hint of dryness. A good beer but not one that announces itself well, too subtle."
"12 fl. oz. / 355 ml bottle, bought at the Great British Beer Festival 2008 for takeaway. ABV is 6.0%. Amber to orange colour, pours very fizzy with a moderate head. The aroma has a dominant malty sweetness, also notes of caramel, honey and moderate fruity hops. The flavour also has a dominant sweetneess (too sweet), then grapefruity hops make their presence known, leading to a distinct hoppy bitterness in the finish and aftertaste."
"The tast was a little tart and bitter but sweet on the initial sip. The taste had a sweet and tart citrus note in it with a mild honey and almost malty mouthfeel. Good drinkability, not anything too rough or light, a decent balance for an IPA."
"Average at best."
"Quite drinkable."
"Recommend."
"Very drinkable and goes well with food. This has been my standby Pale Ale for the past six months or so and I'm so glad it's available locally (and inexpensively) at Publix grocery stores here."
"This beer has a lot of big flavor and is somewhat ""filling," so the drinkability will suffer slightly. But I would drink it all day."
"Solid pale ale, good summer drinker."
"The drinkability of this beer is very good, but since I would not seek it out as a session beer I would not call it great. If I saw this beer and the price was right I might be tempted to buy a six pack, but no more. Enjoy, but don't expect miracles from this one."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly full bodied. Drinkability is good, but I'd probably choose a lot of other pale ales over this one."
"Drinkability: Fairly mediocre APA, but drinkable."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very well carbonated. A great and easy drinking APA."
"D: Very drinkale Pale Ale. Not the best for the style, but definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and a great pale ale. I would enjoy a few of these in a night, but at 6% ABV this would not be my first choice for a session beer."
"All the way from the Big Island of Hawaii comes this offering in a bottle. It poured a slightly hazy, copper/amber color with a one and half fingers of head. Sticky lacing at first but the retention was not very good. The nose was floral hops, biscuity malt and maybe a hint of caramel malt. Balanced and pleasant. The flavors were almost exactly the same, floral hops first, then the malt backbone and some lingering sweetness towards the end. The aftertaste was semi-bitter, reminiscent of orange peel which can probably be attributed to the utilization of some citric hops. Medium body and carbonation, right down the line in every way."
"Overall I was mildly impressed. I was underwhelmed with their Longboard Lager but this was a pretty solid beer."
"D: The ale is nothing too exciting but it gets the job done with a well-balanced flavor."
"Pours slightly hazy copper body. Nice aroma - solid malt with just a little hops and maybe caramel sweetness. This is a very tasty pale ale that is very well balanced between malt and hop bitterness. The aftertaste is a little more on the bitter side but just barely. This is the end of my first sixer (not all today!), and I will definitely buy it again. I don't think I have had many of Kona's offerings, but I will not hesitate to try more. THe moutfeel is right about where it should be - medium bodied with a good carbonation and a crip finish. This will be one of my new favorites for American Pale Ales I think. Not overwhelmingly hoppy and well balanced malt base. Good for just one or as a session. I would highly recommend it if this is your style."
"Aloha."
"This is a quality pale ale. It's flavorful and refreshing, and overall just a solid beer. It perhaps falls just a notch below SNPA (the benchmark for the style), but it's not too far behind. I'd consider getting it again, especially to have on a warm day. Recommended."
"A nice tasting Pale Ale from Kona Brewing that has more hops than some IPAs I've tried. Copper color, medium head with some lacing. Very nice full hoppy citrus flavor with sweet malts. It's not going to blow you away but it's simple, easy to drink, and tasty. I had this several times within the past week. Also note that I had this bottled and on tap in Hawaii... so probably very fresh."
"A decent Pale Ale, goes well on a warmer day. Nothing special but gets the job done."
"Pours very clear and copper colored. Small off-white head faded, but carbonation kept a lace of foam going steady. Aroma's of malt and hops. Hops jump out front in the taste, but this is a fairly malty beer. Nice american pale (more like amber) ale."
"D- Easy to drink."
"I wouldn't buy it again, but I'd get it on tap if it were the best available. Too many other fantastic choices out there for this one to rise to the top."
"D-Despite the toffee taste, this was totally drinkable. But in this heat, I was about to stick my head under the faucet."
"Best things about this were the mouthfeel and drinkability. Nice roundness, and mild enough to drink more than one."
"D: Very good pale ale and refreshing for the summer season. No real faults to this one. If you find it try it."
"A very good beer. Has a decent complexity and is very easy drinking. I would reccomend it."
"This is my first Hawaiian beer and hopefully not my last. It's pretty unique relative to some of the other similarly-styled beers that I've had. Overall, this beer seems to be pretty well balanced. If you haven't tried one, you should at least give it a shot regardless of whether or not you like the style."
"While in Hawaii I tried to get to all the local brews I could. Wasn't very hopeful for Kona for some unknown and completely unjustified reason, and I was pleasantly surprised with what each one tried. Tried This one poured a dark amber with a one-finger tan head that faded fairly quickly. Smelled a bit hoppy and tasted slightly hoppy with a hint of citrus and a good sweet malt base. Very drinkable and tasty brew that I found perfect for a good beach session."
"I am glad for the chance to try this beer, and will actively seek it out again. Looking forward to trying others from this brewery."
"Could drink these all night long."
"Drinkabililty: Total is a little less than the sum of the parts here - this one sort of wore on me after a while, and it's a little too sweet/buttery to be too drinkable, in my opinion."
"Tastes very biscuity malt rounded by hop aromatics. Almost like roast malt. More earthy hops than citrusy, so I'm not sure this is classified properly as an APA. This beer is wet and heavy, which is not to style for an APA. Minimal esters and mild, but stingy carbonation. Mouthfeel is dextrinous, which I think contributes to the perceived wet sweet. Decent beer that I'd certainly have agin. It's certainly not to APA style. I rate to style, so the low score does not indicate an unpalatable beer, instead a beer not to style."
"Pretty respectable beer...I think the first I ever drank from Hawaii."
"Pours a dark, transparent orange-brown with a fine-bubbled off-white head. Aroma is not strong but appetizing, malty with touches of spice and fruit. Flavor is rich, mainly malty with spicy hints and a nice hoppy edge. Mouthfeel is edgy so it seems to dance on the tongue."
"D - This is a good summertime pale ale for when you want a good hop fix, but also something a little lighter and fruitier than a big stinky hop bomb. This is very thirst quenching, and I can imagine that it's well suited for drinking after a day of surfing in Hawaii."
"Cracking another. Aloha!"
"Overall- A nice beer which is easy to drink. I would really love to drink this beer while sitting on the beach in Waikiki. We'll see how much better it gets. I bet a Corona would taste good in Hawaii!!"
"Overall, ho-hum. Nothing too much exciting going on here, but not too many flaws either. It could be worse, but it could be much better too. At only $7.50 for the sixer, it isn't a waste of money, but I won't be rushing back to it..."
"D : Easy to drink. Nothing special about it but nothing bad about it."
"This was my first Kona beer and felt it lived up to it's reputation. Perhaps this beer was more subtle because of the distance it travelled, but I think it was better for it. I will have to try this in CA (closest I will get to HI for a while) next time I'm there to see if there is a difference."
"I don't see myself ever craving this, but I'd happily drink it any time I see it when there's limited options, and I'd certainly consider it at the right price as a staple beer for parties."
"A nice session beer and a good go-to ale."
"I had this at ""Cheeseburger - Las Vegas," which is definitely not Cheeseburger paradise. Beer list was all Anheuser-Busch distributed beers, which includes the Kona beers. Beer was OK, service was OK, food was lousy and overpriced, with some severely unpleasant and detrimental effects later."
"D: Sessionable and good with a good warm grilling night. Easy drinking but not going to blow you away in any aspect."
"Overall Fire Rock Pale Ales was an interesting less hoppy version of an APA. I think it would be more comparable to a British version. I would definitely suggest picking up a 6 pack."
"Pours a medium amber. Decent top. Aroma is low -- ""muted"" used below is a good word. Just a little citrus. It has a decent start -- good representation of the style. The end is what's interesting. It has a lingering earth bitterness to it that's very interesting. Medium-bodied."
"My first brew from Hawaii too! Pours out to a hazy copper, forming a large whipped off-white head of fine bubbles with excellent retention and very good lacing. Carbonation is moderate. The aroma is really nice...and I really like. Taste is almost perfect for me and being new to IPA's I am very happy. I could have a few of these in a row ith no problems, one of the best IPA's I have had."
"Mouthfeel was on the thinner side of medium. Zippy carbonation."
"Drinkability is moderate. Low alcohol and decent flavors make for easy consumption, but this beer becomes boring after a little while."
"Drinkability is good. This is a nice sessionable light tasting and easy drinking pale easy that is easy to drink. It's not going to wow you, or blow you away, but this a beer worth picking up, and having more than one."
"Clear copper color with a thin off-white head. Mild aroma of crystal malt and hops. Seems like a Brit style Pale ale. Flavors are pretty subdued, but in overall good character. A biscuit malt and marmalade flavor is the focus, but very mild. Medium body, and a slightly hoppy, fruity finish. This beer has good drinkability, but does not particularly stand out as either a Brit or Yankee style Pale Ale. Never a beer I would turn down if offered, but not one I would seek out."
"I could easily make a session out of this beer, give it a try."
"A rather smooth and refreshing medium bodied pale ale. Bottle claims 6.0% ABV, which, while not that high, was well cloaked by the light toasted malt structure that carries from start to finish."
"Appears a slightly hazed copper hue forms a vibrant white head with thin streaks of lacing left between each sip. Aromatics offered here are built largely between floral and sharp acidic citrus notes from the hops. A very mild metallic twang with some smooth caramel malt sweetness evident. Flavor brings excellent balance to the palate healthy dose of hops make their presence felt on the palate throughout each sip, but the malts bring out enough nutty caramel biscuit sweet notes to make the barrage of citrus and flowery hop flavors and bitterness manageable. A beer I tried at least five years ago on draft out at the Yardhouse it's always nice to reacquaint with an old friend, this is definitely a solid all around pale ale. Mouthfeel doesn't get to oily but I will call it slightly slick with hop oils moderate even carbonation flows smooth nothing abrasive about this pale. Drinkability it's at the high end of the sessionable abv limit but damn if I had a twelve pack of this I would definitely enjoy a few of these without any problems."
"Overall while not really spectacular, this was definitly a solid offering all around. There is no really I could not put down more then a few and this is not a bad offering for a BBQ or to get someone into craft beer a little bit more. I would go for this one again."
"Taste is not very different from the smell- malty, hoppy, grassy, light light light grapefruit citrus flavor. Mouthfeel is a little thin, a little watery. Fairly drinkable, especially on a hot day. A simple, solid pale ale. Nothing terribly noteworthy, but not bad at all."
"D: A pretty good beer from Kona, easy drinking beer from Hawai'i, even at 6%."
" I thought the beer had a great balance of hops to malt to the citrus flavor and would recommend"
"D: This is kind of average beer when you get down to it. Not the worst thing I've ever had, but certainly not the best."
"A good, surprising even, pale ale that goes down easy and has a good balance and character."
"Moderate carbonation, balanced flavors and medium body make this a highly drinkable ale. Overall a well put-together beer."
"Nevertheless, I'd call it a quality brew in the grand scheme of crafts."
"Carbonation was on the level & made every gulp I took twice as large. The beer felt foamy & frothy sloshing around. The alcohol never made itself known during or after the 70 or so ounces. A little more condensed when cold then warm, it felt just a little too thick. ... Once I got near the end, I left half a pour to sit while I grabbed dinner. When warm, the beer became much more salty & acidic. Don't leave any stragglers. Drink it all up like a good boy. :)"
"Light cappuccino foam coloured head : lacing is pretty good, average for a APA ... light golden colour .. light rust hop pine smell ... taste is nice, maybe a bit muddled .... ""if you find a cheaper lion, you must be in africa"" ... the 6 % is quite well hidden so its worth a try but there are better APA's..."
"I deeply enjoyed this beer, in fact, I wish I was drinking one right now. A surprising flavor and texture for an American pale ale - a style which doesn't usually appeal to me. The color is a deep orange, almost rusty shade, with almost no head. But what I really enjoyed about this beer was the smoothness. The hop and malt flavor is extremely well balanced. The carbonation lends the beer a great mouthfeel that makes this one very drinkable. Although the flavor is a tiny bit thin and mildly fruity, I thought it was worlds better than other pale ales in the American ""canon"" (Sierra Nevada springs to mind). This may become my new default beer."
"This didn't have to be a good beer because it was from Hawaii. The fact that is is pretty decent is just a bonus. I can see this being sweet on a Big Island beach."
"D - I think I may have found a new favorite beer. This is smooth and drinkable. Wow."
"Poured into a nonic. Transparent, light amber color with a a beige 2 finger head. Great retention and lacing. Aroma is of faint tropical citrus hops and not much else. Flavor is mildly hoppy up front, with some grassy twang. The hops then meld into a shortbread cookie-like maltiness. There's also a bit of a lemon curd note in the finish. Mouthfeel is good, drinkability is high. An interesting and clearly tropical take on the APA style."
"This was a great pale ale. Perfectly balanced, perfect hop flavor and bitterness. Slightly watery on the mouthfeel but a nice, lingering hop bite. Fits the style perfectly. What else can I say; a great APA."
"Needed something on the lighter side after the tripel I drank, biggest surprise here was the color because it was one of the darkest pale ales I have ever had, would probably drink again, worth a try"
"Poured into a 22 oz. pint glass. Nice carbonation and inch thick head. The head stays for the sitting. A deep pale color. The aroma is of a solid floral hop. The taste is nice and balanced. There is a slight bite up front and then again at the end. In between the bitterness there is a great bready, whole grain flavor. The body is full for a PA, something I like to match a slightly higher abv. (5.8%). This one I will try again and again."
"The taste is faint caramelly malt with a lot of grapefruit pulp and a bitter finish. It is very alcoholic, which took me aback when I tasted it. It's otherwise characterless and has too little flavour, complexity, or body to carry the light bitterness or alcohol. The latter seems utterly unjustified in this instance."
"I enjoyed Kona's Longboard Lager so I gave the ale a try. Pours a tinged copper, a little too thin looking for my taste but many many ever rising bubbles gives it a decent white head. Smells mildly floral hoppy with pineapple maybe or do I just have Hawii on the brain? Tastes surprising flavorful for its thin appearance with decent hop and malt balance. The tiny bubbles makes it easy on the tongue. Aloha!"
"Drinkability: A good, albeit basic pale ale. I'm sure it'd be 100% better to be enjoying this beer in its home state."
"Well, after letting it warm up, nothing much has changed. I'd call this one a good entry level Pale Ale but, at least for me, it doesn't have the flavours that I look for in the style."
"Pours a clear copper with small head, spotty lacing. Smell: sweet, fruity, floral and spicy hops. Taste: well balanced malt sweetness and floral and citrus hops, pine and lemon flavors. Feel is a little light, but overall this is a very drinkable pale ale."
"Overall: I am glad Kona has come to Florida, it's not the best APA for real hops heads but it is enjoyable nonetheless."
"Moderate-heavy carbonation, but not too stingy. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable."
"""Nalu- Waves"" printed under the cap. The Fire Rock Pale Ale from Kona pours an attractive orange amber color and a small rocky white head. Nose is that of green grapes, cantalope, oranges and peaches with gentle hop notes. The taste is very quick and to the point, it rushes in...hops. fruit, malt...gone! It leaves a celery and pepper like taste on the tongue at the finish. Again, very straight forward, nothing to complex here, but a decent show of the style none the less. I wish my father had brought me back more than one bottle, i could drink a 6 of this...in about an hour!"
"Pours out a slightly hazed orange-honey with a barely-there head that leaves some sticky lace. Smells of sticky, syrupy, sweet, toasted malts with some clementine hops character underneath. Taste is about the same. A bit too sweet for me. The orange comes out well though, and I like that. Toasty and slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is a little sticky and the body is moderate in weight. Bubbles kind of prick the tongue. Average all-around. I wouldn't refuse this, but I don't think I'd be buying it again. There are better pales for the same price or cheaper available to me."
"Into a mug glass, this is a medium-amber colored beer with excellent lacing despite a smallish head. Aroma is hoppy, very citrusy, but with some pleasant malt as well. Flavor is well-balanced, with enough hoppy flavor for a PA, though bitterness is perhaps a tad on the low side. Lightly fruity and nicely malty, with a neutral finish. Body is a tad thin, but otherwise, a very drinkable beer."
"D - Great beer. I can't wait to try this on tap if I can find it. Highly recommended."
"Overall a great session beer. Good flavor and nothing off."
"Pours a hazy yellow/ orange-ish color with a small white head. In the aroma, a small grapefruity, citrusy hop. In the taste, somewhat watery, and a small semi-dry grapefruity hop. A smooth and watery mouthfeel and a semi-dry maltiness in the aftetaste. Kinda watery, good aroma and color. OK pale, but nothing too exciting."
"Drinkablity: A tame ale, but very drinkable."
"Pours a dark amber with a big, big lasting head all the way to the end with nice lacing to boot. Big juicy, caramelly aromatic sweetness with light hops in the smell. Taste consists of a quite nice hop presence along with some good sweetness to go along with it. Quite a flavorful pale, balanced, and one of my favorites for sure. Just what I hoped for. Overall very good, and one I wish I could get here."
"the beer poured a yellowish clear color with little to no head. the smell was mainly hops. not bad, but just average. the taste was good and the mouthfeel was about average for an apa. i found this beer to be very one dimensional, but not hard to drink."
"Very drinkable beer. Though much less hop aroma and taste than from a keg"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy with solid carbonation. I really can't argue with the mouthfeel at all as it flows down easily. However, overall for me this pale ale didn't make the cut. It lacks the hop presence I would normally look for and the malts seem a bit muddled with the buttery aspect in there. I'll pass next time."
"D: It is an easy brew that is very session friendly but quite unremarkable."
"This beer poured a nice amber color with nice head. Head was average thickness, slowly faded away. Smell was kind of fruity . Taste a little like a spiced apple juice. I really enjoyed it. Mouthfeel was creamy, but also had a bite. Nice well rounded beer. Drinkability was enough for me to drink again."
"d - ok beer for the beach, but lacks hop flavor to make this beer a repeat for me. nothing more than average."
"Bottle from Albertsons in Tehachapi, CA. The beer is a clear amber color with a medium off-white head that has decent retention. Stringy lacing. Lightly floral hops aroma with some grass and malt. Medium, smooth body with a moderately hoppy character. Grainy malt, flowers and some citrus flavors are present. The finish is dry and hoppy with a slight citrus aftertaste. Above average overall."
"Flavor is bigger than expected.. toasted and caramel malts.. more grassy hops with a lite pine&citrus finish. Bigger body than expected from a brew from Hawaii. Really pretty good... I've had this beer probably 8-10 times over the last few years, and writing this review makes me think it should probably be part of a bigger rotation."
"D- nice balance but too rich to session, a worthwhile brew"
"Light bronze color topped by a creamy head. It's right there with many of the hooped APA's with it's citrus flavors, but a little lighter in taste, presumably to cope with the warm climate it hails from. The smooth feel is a welcome addition and is wraped up with a dry bready finish."
"To my knowledge this is the first Hawaiian beer I have had,poured into a standard pint glass a clear lighter copper with a tight formed 1/2 white head that settled into a somewhat frothy mass.Very light aromas I did get a little spike of piney hop at bottle opening but it faded quickly to just a hint of tasted malt,very balanced pale here a big toasty cereal-like malt presence up front with a touch of caramel that melds into a piney-citric finish that lingers nicely.A balanced pale ale that is food friendly went well with a pizza with spicy sauce,not over the top flavor wise but very quaffable."
"Highly drinkable session beer from Kona with a bit of a bite. Pours a pillowy head but dissapated quickly. Almost amber in color, flavors of malts and hops come out if warmed slightly. Tastes really nice, with some nice hoppy goodness with a cherry-like malt on the front. A nice beer that I will try to seek out whenever possible."
"D: Very high. A solid Pale Ale thats easy to drink and tastes great."
"12 oz. bottle marked August 2006, brought back from Hawaii September 2006, enjoyed now in a pint glass. Pours a nice, cloudy amber with some copper tones, topped with a rich straw-colored head. Nose is initially hops, which quickly gives way to rich caramel which dominates. Thin but pleasingly smooth and creamy body, flavor profile dominated by caramel malt, a touch of grassiness and biscuit, and snappy grassy finish. Fairly sweet and singleminded, but very refreshing and pleasing."
"Good body and carbonation. Pretty easy to drink, but not overly interesting."
"If you are looking for a very hoppy Ale, this one should not be on your list. However, if you are looking for a refreshing APA with a balance and a distinct malt taste, this is the one for you."
"Different label than picture but bottle says its 6% and according to here its 5.8%, maybe they rounded up. Pours a nice clear amber with some orange tones and a 2 finger head that quickly decipates but leaves some behind for the remainder of the glass. Initial smell I notice is hops, but after another check there is a hint of caramel to it as well. Malty taste, nice mix of toasted grains and hops as well. At first this seemed very hoppy in nose and taste but the more I drank the more malt and caramel came out. Low carbonation leads to an almost creamy mouthfeel that goes down smooth and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Overall a pretty good beer, would love to try it on tap."
"The carmel malts dominate the palate. A little bit of grassy hop. Slight bittering on edges of the tongue. The carmel maltiness really controls thoughout. Never approaches cloying, but a malt oriented pale ale. In the final analysis, the lack of hops prevents me from wanting another."
"D-Very good, two at the bar while waiting for my table and two more with dinner."
"I liked the color of this, reddish with a nice white head. It smelled pretty good, sweet hoppyness to it. Nothing complex but good. Malty sweetness, with a touch of hops, I would guess Cascade? I liked the flavor and it went well with my steak. Nice smooth mouthfeel, crisp carbonation but not over the top, no complaints. I have had this beer a few times before and enjoyed it each time. Since I had a large serving it did warm as I put it down, but even when the temp came up it had a good flavor. I can imagine a better serving device then the straight walled monster mug would bring out more character."
"I can see this beer being my favourite (everyday) beer."
"This beer was a pleasant surprise. It actually tastes better than when I had it on tap in Kona. I was very surprised to find it at Global Foods in St. Louis."
"Copper color with a fair antique head. Smell is typical, hop-forward pale. Taste is maltier than expected with traces of honey and vanilla, unfortunately a bit coppery at the finish, but by no means a deal breaker. This sits nicely on the palate, but is a bit sticky, and is indeed a very drinkable drink."
"There is a pronounced citrus-floral hop aroma comes from the liberal amounts of Galena, Cascade & Mt. Hood hops added to each brew."
"Overall- A good tourist beer or 1 to break you into the APA style. A decent offering worth checking out."
"D - A great tasting pale ale. So well balanced and this version deserves its place among the top American pale ales"
"D= if you're in this kind of mood, you could probably really go on this stuff. If you're not in the mood, at least try it, especially if you find it on-tap."
"Overall impression: Nice drinkable beer, good combination of flavors."
"D - A very nice APA. It is the best of the 3 Kona beers that I have tried."
"Pours a burnt orange color with a creamy white head that doesnt have the best retention and leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Aroma is of sweet caramel and citrusy hops. Not a very strong aroma, but not bad. This beer features a nice malty caramel presence that temporarily gives way to some herbal and citrusy hops, only to finish with more malt. Nicely balanced beer. Those that prefer heavily hopped APA's may be disappointed. Mouthfeel is a little thin for my taste but not bad. Definitely wouldn't mind putting a few of these back on the Hawaiian Islands; a solid beer."
"Thanks to Noxious26 for the bottle!"
"Nice, smooth, and easy going pale ale. A touch hoppy. Perhaps a different variety of hops (herbal or pine) thrown in for half of the pitch would balance it out nicely while maintaining the backbone. Still, the best beer I had on Maui."
"Poured from the bottle into my DFH ""tulip pint"" glass. Appears a cloudy orange-apricot in color with a frothy 2-finger head. Pretty dense looking beer. The foam thins out over time but leaves a nice film on top of the liquid. Not much lace left on the glass though. The aroma is very malty, with some yeastiness and nuttiness as well. Somewhat biscuity. Maybe some hints of dark fruit. No real hop presence, though, in the bouquet at all. The taste echoes the aroma. Rich and malty, this is kind of like an Old Chub junior, but that is a weak, weak comparison, and I know it. Smooth malty taste. Slightly thin, but refreshing. Some woody, nutty flavors, and the faintest hint of strawberries. Slight hop kick right before the finish, which is nice for balance but otherwise unimpressive. I would never have guessed this beer was almost 6% ABV, because the alcohol is masked very nicely. On the whole, this is a very drinkable beer. Much better than the Kona Golden Wave ale I tried before, but not quite as good as the Pipeline Porter. Still, a solid session beer and a pleasure to drink."
"The Kona beers seems to have a unique flavor and I'm not sure what it is, but I like it."
"12 oz. bottle- color of dark golden , with a acceptable whitish head - nose of sweat , mild hops , and sour grapefruit  taste of red grapefruit , hint of dry bitter hops , dough , and malts- body is medium , sharp , and with medium to high carbonation  aftertaste of hops , some sweetness , and medium duration"
"On tap at Delux in Phoenix, AZ. The beer came with a nice amber body and a slight white head leading to solid lacing on the sides. The aroma was a bit of citrus, slightly sweet and touch earthy. The taste is a nice balance of the malty sweetness and a good hop bitterness that leaves a pleasant taste on the tongue. The body is solid and makes for drinkable session beer."
"This lil brew sure traveled a long way for me, and Im glad it did. Try one whenever possible."
"An amber/orange beer with a slight haze. Has a small creamy head with some nice lace. A lot of light hoppy esters get airborn as you pour it into a glass. Notes of spice and grapefruit with a sweet caramel malt backbone. A quick hint of grapefruit bitterness on the tip of your tongue. With a spicey/piney hop presence along the sides. Hints of smokiness along with the sweet caramel note before the nicely balanced peppery hop finish. I found this in a grocery store in Melbourne, FL. I drank the whole sixer during my stay and enjoyed every bottle."
"Very sharp and crisp mouthfeel, though perhaps a little thin. Overall an excellent choice and one of the better APAs I've tried, on tap at least. I'd definitely recommend this one."
"From a bottle poured a slightly cloudy amber wtih an off-white head and moderate lacing. Aroma was of hops, with some fruit and citrus and is very mild. Mouthfeel is light and clean. Flavor is the same as the nose. Slighly bitter finish. Enjoyaable to drink."
"Drinkability: Despite some of the harsh flavors, I rather like this beer and its peculiar complexities"
"Mouth: Strong mouthfeel right off the bat. Lots of good hops touched up w/ more flavors of cinnamon. Bitter hop flavor that's kind of tingly remaining in the mouthfeel. Graham cracker taste w/ banana notes and brown sugar."
"I had on tap and it was a dark amber color that had a creamy head that lingered for a while. Smell was strong and sweet with a touch hops and honey. Taste was good. Not to strong, and not to thin. I drink this ale often as it is priced right and easy to find on the space coast. I also find it in a lot of pubs and restaurants in the area and notice a big movement with it. It's an obvious pleasure. Drink One...."
"(#2, 8/2002) This pours with little head, but maintains an invitingly beautiful copper color. The initial aroma hints of its citrusy hoppiness. Although pretty it has a light texture, the taste is wonderfully tart. Excellent American PA. I like how in Hawaii the pronounce it Pal-ey, Al-ey."
"Prost!"
"An amber color, that fades to a light orange, with very little evidence of a head. Very malty fragrance with a slight bit of bitterness right at the end of each scent. That malt is just as strong in the flavor, a mild bitterness comes in halfway and takes over til the very end. A medium bodied feel, leaving a slght bit of dryness on the palate. I fairly disappointed, I was expecting an APA, instead this is closer to an english style pale ale. It is still fairly drinkable, I'll slip some to my Miller Lite buddy and see what happens."
"It was a nice to find this under the tree with a Kona sampler pack schlepped back from the Islands by the in-laws..."
"This was solid pale ale. I will definetly try it again."
"Rich and sweet. (What my wife wishes I was.) Enjoyed this on tap at the Outback on Oahu. (We went to the Kona Brewing pub in Hawaii Kai but settled on buying t-shirts because it was 11:00 in the morning.) Extremely gorgeous carmel/orange color in the glass--and this was one of those great frosted mugs. Huge head that lasted like suds through the first half of the mug and brought a bite of hops and a rich, malty sweetness to the mouth. I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it, but this was a pleasant surprise and one of those beers that I'll consider (at least on tap) any time, anywhere it's available. The sweetness was not cloying, but rather a welcome balance to the prominent hops flavor. Excellent. Ono Brah!"
"M/D- Medium boded, bitter, light carbonation....I don't know what I was expecting...maybe something a little more exotic being from Hawaii...I feel like the tried to take the notch up one more on the classic american pale, but something did not quite work."
"Mostly clear on the pour with a rather bright orangish-amber color. The head is slightly off-white and somewhere between bubbles and foam. Lacing was present but minimal. Citrus and caramely malts were the main notes to hit my nose, with a sort of balance that carried through to the taste. Pretty hoppy from the start but not at the expense of the malts. The mouthfeel was good, though a bit oilier than I expected. Still, I wouldn't turn down this APA most any time."
"This is a fine interpretation of a classic APA. It is well-balanced between malt sweetness and hop bitterness. The alcohol was well-covered. Nothing particular ""wowed"" me, and I was considering a 3.5 for flavor, but decided, especially after another, that is just makes the higher score because, while the taste is mild, it is nice and has some complexity to it. I recommend this one if you are in the mood for an easy drinking, well-balanced pale ale."
"Hazy copper body is topped by a small beige head. Nice lacing. Subdued aroma features citrusy grapefruit, caramel, and a hint of pine. Medium body with strong carbonation. Taste is well balanced between the citrusy and pine hop bitterness and sweet caramel maltiness. A very drinkable American Pale Ale that, while not outstanding, is quite respectable."
"Head on this one is fairly scant, aroma and taste are both pretty average but very good, smooth caramel malt and hops which aren't too aggressive. Worth a try."
"Quite good, easy session beer. I would happily drink again, especially on a 90 degree plus Phoenix fall day..."
"Overall a very drinkable APA. A nice touch of sweetness made this one unique."
"A solid pale ale offering, with more than enough hopping. A bit more, and this would qualify as an IPA. A very classic hop and malt balance, with a bit of resiny bite to the hops. Smooth finish, wiht a touch of creamyness to the mouthfeel. I bought this for the novelty of adding Hawaii to my list of states sampled, but I would buy this again for the quality."
"Pkgd Jul2406. Pours a clear copper color with creamy off-white head that sticks all over the glass. Fresh citrusy hops dominate the smell with a bit of malt. Taste is a bit more malty than the smell but there still is a good layer of hops in the background making it really nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick and creamy. Good craft beer in Hawaii? I never would have thunk!Overall, this is a very nice brew that I would not mind having again in the future. Definately recommended."
"Overal, quite drinkable. Certainly one of Kona's better offerings."
"I had this beer with some nice fried chicken. It poured a nice amber color with a light lace. It has a light sweet hops smell. The taste is sweet with a little bit of bitterness. It has nice hops spiciness and a sweet finish. The feel is clean and refreshing with a crisp finish. This is a great beer for a hot summer evening. Clean and light with a good flavor."
"D: Quite quaffable, but doesn't really draw me in."
"Had this one directly after a Deschutes. This one had a good initial bite of hops, it demured to a grassy/chalky backbone afterward. Not bad, worth drinking with a pizza and watching WSOP. Finished very clean. Drinkable in a hanging out and talking $hit kind of way."
"The flavor is a fairly nice blend of hops and blended malt. The mouthfeel is slightly tangy. I think this beer is very refreshing and goes down easy."
"Pretty drinkable- could down a couple of these on a hot day- more if it weren't for the residual sweetness after the hop bitterness."
"Finish is very clean and aftertaste is minimal. Alcohol content is relatively high, but since when was that a problem? I guardedly recommend this beer; try it, you just might like it."
"In the bottle, I thought it went a bit 'flat' and thin too quickly. Tried it last night on tap and was quite impressed. The body stood up better throughout the durration of the glass. Creamy, bready, rich and full from start to finish. Caramel, toasted sweetness balances with spicy American hops, a tough of ginger and nutmeg. The head retention and carbonation remained consistently firm. A much better experience with this beer."
"Highly drinkable Pale Ale."
"Mild ABV with a pleasant flavor...probably tastes even better where it's brewed (while on vacation). Definetly worth tasting and reasonably priced in the US (mainland that is). Cheers."
"Had a pint at ""Cheeseburger Oasis"" at the Alladin Hotel in Vegas. Don't know if it was the 105 degree weather or the beer, but I thought this one was a winner. Pours a cloudy copper color. No head (at least not in the frosted beer mug), light lacing, good hops smell. Great taste of bitter hops and spices. This is not a hops bomb, but has enought bite to satisfy a hop head. It reminded me a little of Harpoon. Mouthfeel was fairly rich, not at all watery. Drinkability is good, both with food and as a sessions beer. I had this one with the fish tacos, but I could easily see myself drinking several of these. Would like to try this again in a climate below boiling to see if I went overboard on this one. Maybe I'll have to go to Hawaii."
"Da good pale ale, easy drinking and more are welcomed."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and not at all what I expected. Given its price point and availability, theres a good chance Ill have Kona Fire Rock Pale Ale again. It is a very nice pale ale, especially for the summer season."
"Average feel with some softness of carbonation. About as it should be."
"Overall, a notable pale ale, and with the added novelty of being from Hawaii, I can say that this is an enjoyable brew, even if it doesn't require a whole lot of thought."
"Very drinkable, great session ale. When fresh,I highly reccomend this, a very well put together PA! Or as they'd say on the big island: onolicious!!"
"Had a pitcher of this on tap with some friends tonight. It was a copper color, with a small head. Taste is pretty good, it is a bit sweet as other reviews have mentioned, but I don't find that a bad thing in this brew. The hops were predominant as would be expected, and there was a nice malt backbone. I thought this was a nicely balanced and very drinkable pale ale. I would definitely drink this again, and I would recommend trying it."
"12 ounce bottle, PKGD ON MAY2505. Many thanks to mentor for the wedding present!"
"I would welcome trying this on tap as I think this would even be better. Nice brew and the best I've tried from the Islands."
"Pours a dark golden color with a moderate head. The taste is like no other Pale Ale that I've had. There is something really fruity about it, much like sweetened hops, or almost pinapple...which would work with the hawaiian connection. This puts the beer in a novelty category and away from other serious microbrews, but still it has a lot of character. This goes down really easy, but its still hard to enjoy more than one."
"Color me impressed. I was a little skeptical, as Hawaii obviously hasn't made much of a dent in the brewing industry, if only for financial reasons. This brew proves that Kona BC means to do business, and they do it very well. What a great find! I'd love to try their IPA!"
"Hazy orange color with a large flat white head that tapers off but sticks around. Good bouquet, pine and lemon zest with light notes of honey. The taste is decent, with some bidder citrus tones, a touch of coriander spice and some but it really lacks depth and aggressiveness. Pretty oily in the mouth but not excessively so, crisp and refreshing. Almost like you were chewing wood with tea-tree oil at the very end, thought without the numbing effect. Still not quite bold or interesting enough."
"Pours a medium amber color with a golden orange hue and a creamy off-white head. Nose is biscuity malt with a touch of buttery diacetyl blended with a strong aroma of fresh citrusy hops. The same biscuity malt that was present in the aroma comes across in the taste along with a bit of caramel. Peppery hops with notes of fresh grapefruit follow and leave a bitter aftertaste. A bit heavier on the malt than I was anticipating but certainly enjoyable nonetheless."
"Amazing balance, very tasty hop flavor, this is a stand-out pale ale. Not terrifically complex, but sometimes a simpler, more minimal beer is more to my liking. This would be my regular ""drinkin' beer"" if I lived on Hawai'i."
"Nice hazy copper color with a white head. Aroma of nutty munich sweet caramel malt, followed by a light floral hop. Good malty flavor, with significant hop bitterness, and mild hop flavor and yeast frutiness. The beer has decent body and handles the 6% pretty well. Overall the beer is pretty well made, it could be slightly better balanced and rides a fine line between APA and IPA."
"This is not a bad pale ale. One that being from Hawaii probably sells for a fair amount of the time on that fact alone. A very solid beer though that is pretty drinkable. I'd reach for one again."
"I had a few bottles of this Oregon-brewed ale one night while I was visiting my friend in Honolulu. This is review from my notes. It looks terrific. A 1 1/2-2 finger frothy head sits atop the deep and rich dark copper body. The aroma is largely grapefruit with caramel and sweet malts. The carbonation is fine but, the mouthfeel is thin and watery. For a pale ale, this beer is fruity (not necessarily tropical but a bit more tropical than the normal citrus profile) and earthy malt-sweetness tastes strange. If the malt flavors were bigger the beer would be excellent, well it would be interesting... now if the malts were more pronounced and it had more hop bitterness, then this beer really would be excellent. As it stands, this stuff is a bit bland and too thin. Fire Rock Pale Ale is not a bad pale ale by any means, it's just frustrating since it could taste so much better ."
"I'd recommend it and I'd be happy any time I see it served."
"Appearance is a nicely transparent orange color with ivory foam and little lacing. Aroma is composed of brown sugar, fruit and citrus hops. Initial taste continues the lemon and orange theme, plums are detected midway. The body is medium to thin, with a finish that disappoints. This beer needs some work to improve the overall consistency."
"I like this beer and would encourage those of you who like the flavors of hops to give it a try."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy medium apricot color with two fingers of head. There is a little bit of lacing. The smell is nice and floral, lots of hop presence. There's some underlying malt, but I'm loving the hops. The taste is nice and malty at first, but then there's a nice rush of citrusy hops. Lots of citrus going on here, especially orange. The mouthfeel is decently thick for a pale ale, and the drinkability is great. A nice solid pale ale! Thanks to Kev or Chris (I can't remember which, dammit!) for this fine brew."
"Incidentally, it also goes very nicely with Kua'aina's excellent bacon avocado burger!"
"A drinkable brew, but I won't seek this one out on the West Coast."
"Very easy drinker, but could stand to have a bit more depth."
"Kona's fresh, floral, and citrusy hops are evident in the nose as you admire its dark-gold/amber body and frothy ""vanilla"" head. The flavor is a bit more malty, however, but it's nicely balanced and has just the right amount of hop flavor to keep you interested. The bitterness is solid enough to balance its lightly bready malt, and it lingers a bit in the finish with a smattering of citrusy and floral hop flavors. Quite nice!"
"Goes down clean but not my first choice of pale ale if available."
"Edit:I had this from a bottle, not on-tap."
"Overall Impression: Very refreshing and enjoyable. I get the Hawaiian style bit, it has a slight tropic fruit edge. Enjoyed it greatly."
"My first beer from Hawaii. Didn't get to try any of these when I was actually on the islands, as I was too young then. Pours a light amber color with a small head that doesn't stay around and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a bit of caramel and a nice mellow citrus hop presence. The flavor is nice. Very smooth and easy to drink. Good hop character and nice malt backing. Very nice."
"The beer pours a golden amber color with a half a finger of head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is nice. There is some nice caramel sweetness and a really nice citrus and earthy hop. I have some high hopes for this. The flavor is nice. Very spicey hop profile, almost peppery. The caramel sweetness from the caramel malts is also nice to balance the hops. I like it. The feel is nice and moderate to thick and creamy. Nice again. Overall, this beer is easy drinking and could easily be a nice session APA for me. Good solid beer."
"Drinkability  Its a bit on the malty side, so if you dont like that then stay away, but I really enjoyed this offering from the great state of Hawaii. It is very thick and creamy and went down in gulps."
"Drinkability is good, a typical West Coast Pale with the strong Hop flavor you would expect. The brew get very mellow as you drink it."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, and I have returned to it on several occassions, but is is not top of its class. I've had this both on tap and in bottle on several occasions (a love affair with the Hawaiian Islands, I guess!). There's not a lot of difference between the two; I think the tap version is a little more mellow, the edges not quite so hard."
"Drinkability- A pretty nice pale ale. If you want something with a bit less bite than Sierra Nevada, grap this one for a try. Could be a good session beer."
"Light, fruity malt up front. Hops make a late entry; citrusy, lemon zest, and bitter. Finish is bitter with a lightly toasted caramel cookie taste coating the mouth. Bubbly, light-medium body feel. Akalakaliki, come on you wanna lay me, pass the poy mahalo."
"It's just a travesty that the tap version is so good and the bottles suck."
"Fire Rock Pale Ale is malty, hoppy and just plain good. I'd love to drink it on-tap, as fresh as possible. Of course that would necessitate a trip to the islands, a sacrifice that I'd be willing to make for the good of my vocation."
"Head is small, pale tan, dense foam. It leaves a sticky ring of lacing all around the glass. Color is very clear, pale, amber-gold. Quite nice. Aroma of sugar, roasted grain, burnt caramel. Sweet caramely front leads to fizzy, fullish, sweet caramel middle. Nutty, fruity finish with bitter citrus and a surprising alcohol kick. Not bad at all. Quite sweet and fruity with a bitter, nutty, alcohol finish."
"Pours orangy pale amber with a beige head that dies quickly. Few streamers of carbonation. Floral, nutty nose. Bready malt profile. Tastes predominantly sweet with a little hoppiness in the finish. Easily drinkable. Pretty interesting character for a pale ale. Thanks to a friend for bringing me back beer from Hawaii instead of a dancing hula girl."
"Pours a nice dark orange/copper color with a dissapointing head that dissapates quickly. The smell is dry and full of citrus flavor, hint of nuts as well. Maybe dried apricots as well. The taste a little to bland, not enough kick, mild hop bitterness and a little to sweet for my tongue. The almond aftertaste is present, lemon citrus flavor brings up the rear ever so slightly. A light/medium bodied pale ale, an average beer but plenty of better pale ale's out there, maybe the beer to introduce others to the world of beers. I would rate this the starter beer for new beer advocates."
"Pours a lightly hazy gold color with a tan head that disappears after a bit. There is a hoppy aroma of candid citrus fruit, malt, and a hint of alcohol. Sweetish with a nice toasted biscuits and malt flavor up front. This beer finishes with a solid hop flavor and a nice sharp bitterness. I get notes of toffee, orange, hay, tropical fruit, and herbs. This is a pretty good pale, light bodied, and easy drinking."
"This is a spiced-up version of a cool-down beer."
"The beer as it evacuates the 12 ounce brown bottle pours a slightly hazy golden amber color, the head is portly in size, spumescent in texture and the color a bright white with the lace a satin like curtain to drape the glass. Nose is sweet malt, crisp and clean to the senses with the start sweet, nicely malted and the top middling in its feel. The acidity mild at the finish and the hops personable in their spiciness, quite dry and a nice drinking beer that just fits the 100 degree temperature today."
"Good drinking pale rather in the English style as opposed to the usual NW pale."
"A good drinker, would like a little less sweetness in the finish however."
"This is a well crafted beer that shows moderate hops and a good balance. Nothing huge in the flavour department but instead an easy drinking beer that tastes great in a hot climate. I like the interesting esters in the Mehana Pale Ale but this beer is more true to form."
"Pours more of an amber-orange, with a flaccid, white bubbly head that recedes rapidly. Nice color though. Aroma is tangy/piney hops up front with a thick, bready backbone. The taste is well rounded, with toasty sweet malts dominating before a dry and citrusy hop finish. The mouthfeel is good and chewy with a slight oily texture that makes it a winner with spicy meals. Drinkability is absoutely tops. I could drink this all day...a new fave. This drinks a bit more like an amber than a pale, but I really like the sweet smoothness and balance."
"The beer has a darker look than the average pale. A slight amberish tint to it. The head was ok but quickly went away with no lacing. The smell was very strong of hoppy floralness. The taste was mild with a hint of hops and malt. Not overpowering at all. The mouthfeel was very small not much there. Over all an ok beer."
"I blinked and the head was gone. No lacing. But the beer sure is a perty color. A light orange, slightly red. Pleasant aroma. Tastes bitter, but not too. not very complex. Odd aftertastes.. hard to place. Definitely a decent beer, but there's just not more to it."
"Orange color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and floral. A medium bodied pale ale. Malts are fruity and mild. Hops are grapefruity. Mild flavored pale ale. Refreshing and drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Overall: Pass. This isn't a very good beer. Go find yourself a different brand"
"A little cloudy, hazy... Definitely a flame-colored orange color. Thin white head. Pretty standard pale ale stuff. Great hoppy aroma with a sweet but roasted malt underneath. Very well-balanced flavor -- nothing too original but just a great, drinkable flavor and texture. Solid malt base with light citrus (borderline grapefruity) and decent herbal hops. Nice, clean brew. Hit the damn spot tonight. And hey, it was a present from good friends who just returned from their honeymoon in Hawaii. So it had a solid dose of love and affection to boot. Can't go wrong."
"Thanks to my friend Jason F. for the sample!"
"Overall: It looks like I left the best until last. Out of the three Kona beers that I tried tonight, the Fire Rock Pale Ale is definitely the pick of the bunch. Very nice, and one which I would love to try on draft on the Big Island one day. Aloha!"
"Drinkability: Not without food."
"Every once in a while you just have to grab a brew with a lizard on the label. A hazy golden amber liquid greets the drinker. The quick thin lace gives way to a very slight earthy aroma. An initial sharper bitterness with a hint of floral spice. The malt presence is very limited at first, but grows heavier and becomes quite apparent in the finish."
"I'm curious if this beer is better on tap, but I'd pass on a 2nd offering in the bottle although there seems to be a decent beer lurking underneath."
