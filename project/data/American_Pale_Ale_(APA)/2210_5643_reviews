"Good beer for a hot day! !"
"Slightly hazy on an otherwise pale blond body. Earthy and herbal aroma. Green grass, moss, green tea. Flavor is similar. Not much malt flavor here at all, but not much bitterness either. A light, easy drinking, slightly hoppy pale ale is what I have here. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. Good if your desire for hops is light."

"thin, bland, flavorless, weak, drain pour"
"Sometimes I'm surprised by beer and this is one of those times. I generally don't expect anything much from a pale ale that is available year round, but this beer impressed me. I originally bought this beer because it was on sale and I think firestone puts out some pretty good beers. The beer pours like any number of pale ales but the flavor is exceptional. This beer balances malt and hops in a way that really lets the hops shine through without being overpowering. Some people might find this beer too hoppy but this is where i find that this beer really separates itself from other pale ales. While maintaining similar bitterness characteristics to similar APA's this beer has exquisite subtle floral hop aromas and flavors that really make this beer enjoyable for every single sip. This is a beer you can sip in while working in the yard yet it still has bold flavor profiles that will satisfy your hop-foward palate. Do yourself a favor and pick  this beer up when it's on sale or featured in a mixed 12-pack and you won't be disappointed."
"Very very drinkable. Not bitter and very delicious."

"Overall it is a very refreshing, easy to drink APA. That's a winner here where the weather is usually warm to hot. It's not spectacular but it is quite good and a fine example of the style."

"Pale golden color.  Great bouquet of citrus aromas.  Tastes citrusy over a subtle malt.  A little more bitter than I like in a pale ale.  Good mouthfeel.  Decent APA."

""
"Refreshing beer. Nothing too special."
"An average pale ale, not much to say."
""
""
""
""

"Balanced, mildly light, decent flavor profile.  A very good option for a session beer, at least.  Could also be a nice beer to expose people to what beer can be."

"12oz. bottle served in a tulip nonic.  05/12/14 on the label (shit!).  Pours a translucent honey gold with a loose, 1/8th inch bright white head that quickly dissipates to a frothy slick.  Nose expresses a trace of caramel and wet cardboard.  Taste consistent with nose with the addition of some noble hops.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a crisp carbonation.  Overall, I think this beer is past its prime - slightly off flavors.  I wish I checked the bottle dating before purchasing.  Will need to revisit with a fresher offering."
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is light with a decent drinkability. There is a smoothness that has no bitterness and seems to have some holes. Not what the brewer intended but not a drain pour."
"Overall- A decent APA but could use more balance in malt/citric/bitterness transitions. Drinkable but not special."
""
""
"Overall: I expected balance and so am disappointed in the strong hop forward bitterness of this beer. I am not a fan of bitter beer so I may be a poor judge. Look to the reviews of the drinkers who like IPAs.  I won’t buy again."

"Poured into a pint glass, clear golden yellow, with a nice white fluffy one finger head that lasted quite nicely to the end and provided some nice lacing. Aroma is a bit muted, with some light pineapple, floral and piney notes. Taste is pretty much like the aroma, but a little more robust, and with just a touch of malty sweetness. The mouthfeel was fairly light, with nice carbonation bite. Overall, for a session beer, this was OK, not bad but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very solid Pale Ale, and a very solid session beer and has become one of my go to session beers."
"O: bold, bright, clean-as-hell, and to the point... excellent drinking that packs a punch on the palate, but is deceptively light... another winner from FW"

"Overall: Okay. Not enough malt, not enough hop aroma. It’s like a less balanced version of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I would rather drink one Union Jack than two of these."
""
"Another boring, run of the mill IPA...... The market is becoming oversaturated with pale ales and Firestone is no exception.  There is nothing memorable about this beer and honestly if I hadn't found an old napkin from the bar I wrote this down on, I wouldn't have even remembered it.  It is plain in all senses of the word and there is nothing memorable about this beer except that it is not terrible.  The king of the mediocre category if there ever were...."

"Overall - Excellent APA. They crammed a lot of nicely balanced flavor into just a 4.8% ABV brew, and maybe more impressive is the body, which seems bigger than it really is. Very drinkable and sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer, enjoyable, refreshing good body and nice balance, not strong, not hoppy, light if that makes sense easy to drink"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the strongest of Pale Ales (in terms of flavor) but one that goes down pretty smoothly. Pours a very thin head and it's lighter than expected in color. I would happily drink it again but it will not be given priority over other better APAs that can be purchased in my area."

"O: Decent beer, but nothing too special. Is somewhat drinkable even though it tastes pretty hoppy. There is not that biscuit or bread taste you want with a pale ale, and instead we were given the modern taste of ales with a hoppy body and aftertaste and no balance of malts"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A drink with this much distinction, combined with it's subtlety is rare in my experience. A true showcase for what hops, in the right hands, can do for a brew. Kudos."

"Firestone Walker's ""Pale 31"" pours a rich pale color with an appropriate carbonation. It has the strong aroma of Turkish delights (for those of you who have tried these tasty and gooey little sugar cubes) that also radiates sugar, white rose, and perhaps under-ripe apricots. The first sip comes with a head that wont quit and a particularly artificial flavor that comes with low-end canned beers like PBR, albeit this flavor is light. A larger mouthful reveals a weak body with a mouthfeel like many other light beers. The flavor is the sweet and bitter you would expect from a pale ale that disappears quickly. The aftertaste however, is this beer's saving grace. This lingering flavor is that of light and summer sweetened hops and some malt that brings you to have another, and yet another sip. This beer is nothing to call home about, but certainly not at all bad."

"Very approachable and drinkable pale ale. They're not trying to break the mold and the low ABV is rather obvious in how it tastes. A very easy, if not basic, drinker."

"O: Honestly not a bad APA. The appearance and aroma is pretty meh but the taste is nice. Surprisingly decent hop character with quite a bit of bitterness. Crisp and refreshing, sessionable for sure. Pretty much the very definition of an APA in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Gritty bitterness with a floral touch. Nice citrusy notes of lemon and pith. Faint pine. Kiss of white grape, maybe. Very dry, effervescent finish with seltzery bubbles. Appropriate lighter feel and ease for drinking. Solid and fresh."
""
""
""
"Interestingly the sweet caramel malts make way to a slightly peppery hop note. There is a modest hop bite at the end that reminded me of something like pepper. It was definitely not spicy but there you have it."
""

""

""

""

"Overall: An above average sweeter APA with California style hopping. Above average for a pale ale. If I wanted a pale ale, I would certainly reach for this."
""
""
"Overall: a pleasant pale ale and representative of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear gold body with a frothy head and decent retention. Very grassy hops in both the aroma and flavor but has a vegetal quality that i'm not too fond of. Lemony and soapy as well but not a fan of this one very much."

"Simple but enjoyable APA that provides a nice mix of Cascade citrus with some spicy, floral hops as well. Crisp and refreshing."
""
"O-A bit disappointing. I was able to put down my pint very quickly, though because none of the flavors were actually off putting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - solid solid solid for style. I am wholly unsure of the freshness given the date on the bottle, but it seems to hold its own quite well. Clearly an entry-level beer, with no palate whack but that's ok too."
""
""

"O: not bad, just don't get the ""wow"" factor. Most important test I feel, would I buy it again? Probably not"

"O: This pale is somewhat of a tightrope walk, but a successful one. Great balance, as the hops have plenty of bitter bite, but share the spotlight with a substantial malt body. What's more impressive is that a somewhat larger bodied pale like this can still be so drinkable and refreshing despite that bit of extra heft. Balance really is the key to drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A good solid, if not particularly exciting, pale ale. Would pick Union Jack over this at a similar price point myself, but those who dislike hop bite in their beer would likely prefer this or DBA, which I reviewed yesterday. This is more an American pale than DBA, but I might pick 31 over DBA as a summer refresher, if it were available then."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty much as pale as it going to be. Short, simple, and enjoyable."
"I don't review beers often but when I do it's because they really, really stand out. This is definitely one of those beers."

"Overall pretty nice, nice hops, just enough malts, very drinkable and tasty."

"32oz growler from the Bowery Whole Foods. Pours a clear light orange color with a 1/2 inch of head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is sweet orange with some malts and hints of tropical fruits. The taste is some bitter orange peel, floral hops and malts. Slightly bready. A tad watery. Malt finish with more floral notes as well as some orange peel. Light mouthfeel, but it's expected considering the low ABV. This is a highly drinkable Pale Ale that would be great for summer. Hoping this gets canned one day. Overall, one of the more flavorful, lower ABV Pales I have had in awhile. I'd buy it again."

"There is a lot of potential here for a go-to session ale, west coast style. Unfortunately Pale 31 doesn't really deliver. When I think of how this could be better, I imagine something by Sierra Nevada. I think that beer would combine a better malt balance, more superb mouthfeel, and sharper bitterness. This is decent, but I'm hoping for better luck next time."
""
""
""

""

"Overall – While not a union or double jack in flavor potency, this modest brew packs tons of flavor into a mere 4.9 % abv. Really, this is a very balanced brew at a more modest abv, with a great flavor profile and a wonderful drinkability. Fantastic for the style!"
""

"Poured a light amber with a thin white head that receded to a white ring leaving no lacing. It looks okay, but not as good as some. Scents of citrus-zest, pine resin, grapefruit, and faint hints of floral hops and malt. A bit more hop-forward than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, with more citrus, grapefruit and pine. Very good, but not as balanced as Sierra Nevada's. Flavor begins with a moderate level of hops, with bitter citrus-zest, grapefruit and pine dominating. These flavors stick around throughout the sip. Towards the middle a bit more floral hop flavors come through in the background, but not heavily. Malt is present, though on the breadier, grainer side, not much sweet caramel or toffee like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Finish is dry with citrus-zest, grapefruit and pine resin dominating. Aftertaste is bitter with a grainy malt flavor. Pretty good. More hop forward and less balanced than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but not in a bad way. It certainly doesn't hurt the flavor profile, it just makes it a different take on a pale ale. Mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp and semi-drying. A bit less smooth than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, more of an IPA mouthfeel, but not bad to drink at all. It makes you want to drink another sip right after you finish. Overall this is another good American Pale Ale. While not as balanced as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, it has a good aroma and flavor profile that balance more towards the hop-forward side of things, while still keeping a sessionable ABV and providing a good drinking experience from the mouthfeel. I recommend it."

"O - Good refreshing beer but for me not like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale or Torpedo. I could give it a shot again but under different environment in a warm saturday right after lunch."
""
""
""
""
""
"I prefer the malt flavor of this a bit more, less Munich I believe than SNPA, this is a wonderful beer, great everyday drinker."
"The Verdict: Very good. About as hoppy as a pale ale could get without crossing into IPA category, and much hoppier than a lot of cheap offbrand IPAs without their nasty bitterness. Another winning brew from Firestone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Im not a fan of hops, and this beer is a little hopy, but for a person that does not like hops its actually pretty good. The bitterness is controlled, a little much on the carbonation, but overall another finer from Firestone. This is by know means a light beer, lots of flavor, and lots to enjoy."
""
"Overall, a balanced and highly drinkable take on this great style and it has plenty of flavor for a 4.8% beer. I would gladly order this again with food or to take home to crack open for an easy drinking beer that won't knock me on my ass. Unfortunately, it's not too common in my local market, otherwise I'd likely find myself drinking it quite a bit."
""
""
""
"On draft at Taphouse in Seattle. Worried they have me the wrong beer. Poured cloudy yellow with a bit of head in a pint glass. Aroma of some citrus and yeast funk. Flavor follows with what can only be described as a bad wheat beer or hefe. Dirty wheat finish, bits of citrus and banana, a touch of sweet citrus hops. Light mouthfeel. Whatever this was it was not good, and I can't imagine my favorite brewery FW would try to pass this off as a pale ale. Blegh. Will have to try again when I visit the west coast."
""
""
""
"Overall- Solid beer and a good representation of the style. Definitely worth a try. Something to keep in mind when you want a pale ale with a little more of a malt bill. Certainly won't be confused with an IPA like some pale ales."
""
"Overall this was good, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden colored and clear with a small foamy head that retains a small amount of lacing around the edges of the glass. Strong apple aroma with underlying citrus tones. Mixture of apple and citrus tastes. Nice balanced hops taste that hits you midway through. Bitter taste that retains on your tongue when done. Not too bitter, though. Hops are moderate, perhaps a little stronger than most pale ales but not quite as strong as most IPAs. Overall a very good beer, becoming one of my favorite go to session beers. One of my favorite pale ales for sure."
""
"Aroma is zesty, floral, lemony,herbal and very hoppy. In the taste, grapefruit, orange and nectarine fruityness are apparent from the dry hop/ale yeast combo. A bit of lemon candy and pine are in effect as well. Mellow bitterness on a pale, salt water toffee like malt notes. Medium bodied, well carbonated, semi crisp. Overall this is an interesting pale ale, I'd give it another go easily."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OV: A decent brew, but certainly nothing that is going to 'wow' you. Seems like this was made to be a simple sessionable Pale Ale with a kiss of hops on it, if so then nicely done. However, if someone just shoved a glass in my hand and said 'taste this' without knowing what it was or is supposed to be, I'd probably just say 'it's nice' or 'it's good' and not add anything to it."
""
"O - Better than I was expecting. An interesting hop profile, well hidden alcohol, and very refreshing and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Super easy to drink, but still very flavorful. Nothing very unique, just another well put-together beer. Nothing out of the ordinary for firestone walker."

"Excellent. If I can get this year round, this will be my new standard bearer for the style. I am so glad this is available on draught at the better beer bars, bring on the six packs. Nothing is over barring, and all in perfect balance. Which is something most ""pale ales"" now lack, and I would expect no less from this brewery. Let alone the great sessionable ABV. Very highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is simultaneously a very satisfying and unsatisfying beer. The lighter body, subtle hop flavors and lighter malt character leave the palate constantly wanting just a touch more, but on the other hand you can have more. At 4.9% this is a tasty, flavorful and easy drinking Pale Ale."

"O: Good beer. Not great, but good. I would like this much more if there were either more hop flavor or less hop bitterness, and I feel like they've missed the balance with this one. That said, it doesn't ruin the beer by any stretch of the imagination, and I would be happy to drink this again in the future."

"I think this is a nice summer/pool pale ale. Well balanced with low abv means you can have quite a few in a sitting and maintain. A little pricey, but if you're looking for a tasty sessionable pale aler with a good hop profile...look no further."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/15/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, floral, light grass, light pine, light honey, bread, and floral earthiness. Very nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Light floral pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, light pine, bread, and light honey after the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is damn good session pale ale! Very nice balance of hop and malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. No complaints at all, really enjoyed this one."

"Update: My feelings on this beer have not changed, but my interpretation of the rating scale has. Consequently, I have adjusted my points to what I feel it truly deserves. I think that a little over five times out of ten, I'd grab this over Sierra Nevada if given the choice, all other things being equal. It's that good."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium bubbly golden amber with a nice two finger white head with excellent retention and lacing. Aroma of citrus hops and sweet malt. Flavor is grassy hops, light citrus, biscuit malt, finishes with a grassy hop bitterness. Light bodied as expected from the style. Flavor is light, but well balanced; an enjoyable, refreshing pale ale. After drinking some hefty darker strong ales and stouts the last week, it's nice to sit back and watch active carbonation in a nicely made light golden beer."

"O: A fantastic APA and one of my go to's. I would easily put this up there with 3 Floyds Zombie Dust, and an underrated beer on BA for sure."
""
"D - I'd like to think that I got an old bottle, but It's barely a month old. Just a poor example of the style. It's easy to drink, but there's really nothing going on. Won't be having this again."
""
"O - A flawless, easy drinking, light pale ale with a pleasant flavor."
""
""
""
"Very pale with copper color, and clear. Head retention is great, big rocky head that laces very well for the style. Lemon and grapefruit dominate the nose with floral notes and slight biscuit. Flavor is lemony and bright with a lot of orange flavor to start as well. Fades to overcooked biscuit and slight a tartness, then floral hops, which are not heavy handed. Bitterness comes on gradually, but its definitely noticeable. Feel is middling, finish is slightly dry. This one tasted especially fresh. I could drink this all day."

"An enjoyable and drinkable ale at a low ABV."
"O: I really like this pale ale. It looked phenomenal, and tasted really good too."

"Overall (4/5): Pale 31 has a lot going for it: easy-drinking, refreshing, and very flavorful given its ABV. Not too expensive for a sixer, at least by Chicago standards–$10.99 for a six-pack. I would recommend this beer to anyone looking for a hop-forward beer that they want to ""session"". Can't go wrong with this one for the purpose. Probably even better in the summer."

"All the rest have 31 and seem to be getting drunker by the day... ...Wow, sorry... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger if lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises bright grapefruit zest, light orange zest, light honey, and a bristling of pine needles. The taste brings in more of the same, with the citrus blending together into a tasty little tropical smoothie, the parts indistinguishable from the whole. In a good way. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice pale ale, highly drinkable and even more highly enjoyable. Good times."

"O: Good, not great. Get it if you can but there are better pale ales out there."
""
""
"O- This beer has a nice fresh malt flavor that grows to over take the hop flavor. This beer is very sessionable and it would be nice to try this on cask to see if more nuances come out."
""
"After reviewing this beer I went to FWBC's website. I am very surprised to see the hops are Fuggle, Cascade, Centennial, and Chinook. Some of my favorites. This is why I love beer - so many different ways to accentuate flavors."
"Golden with a loose quilt of light cream foam. Smells of grapefruit, grass, light caramel malts, some sweet malts - a touch of lactose. Flavor is bready, bitter (lightly), hints of grapefruit pith, some pine and a touch of woody malts. Light body with low carb and a semi dry finish. Decent beer, nothing special."

"O - Nice dry hopped pale with a great balance and great feel. The pour and the nose left some to be desired, but a repeat pick pale for sure."

"Overall, seems to be a very light PA, not offensive to someone like me, who rarely enjoys hoppy beer, but likely not enjoyable to someone who does."
"This beer poured out as a hazy yellow color with a white foamy head on top. The retention and lacing were very good on this beer. The smell of the beer gives off a massive fresh citrus hop aroma. The smell of the beer seems very fresh, bright and lively. The taste of the beer is bitter with a good balance of malt and hops. There are fruity notes in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied with a solid carbonation and a clean crisp finish to it. Overall this one is very good, it pushes the boundaries of being an APA and IPA, this beer could go either way I think. It's very good though regardless."
""
""

"Hands down, this is by far one of the best beers I have ever had. Unlike most Pale ales, this beer has the clean, crisp feel and appearance of a lager, the hoppiness of a mild IPA, and the most incredible hoppy aroma you will get from a bottled beer. Along with the intense sweet, floral aroma, the dry hopped finish creates a superbly delicious dry aftertaste. Besides the hops, the beer is low in maltiness, yet has a nice light bready flavor. The low 4.9% alcohol content will allow you to enjoy more than one on a work night."

"Lighter medium body, well carbonated, refreshing and crisp on the palate. Really easy drinking, excellent hop profile - I easily took down 2 pints and could have enjoyed another without trouble. I need to remember to buy some of this for next summer, this would be perfect for backyard barbecues and sunny summer afternoons."

"The taste is really crisp, hoppy, and a little sweetness at the end. The beer has a pleasant medium body with a really nice bitterness. I can really understand why the took gold at the world beer cup these guys know how to brew good beer. Overall really high marks all around i think they nailed it and i will be drinking more of this beer. Cheers."

"O: Very enjoyable with really good flavors and aromas. Easy to drink and sessionable. Well balanced between the sweetness of the malts and bitterness of the hops."

"O - A pretty well put together pale ale, but a but on the hoppy/floral side, whereas I personally prefer a bit more malt forward. But still, a decent beer overall."

"The one I had to sample was icy cold, and it stands up very well to the chill with its fragrance and crisp flavor. It's one beer to chill when you want a cold one. From the 12 oz bottle. I am getting to be a Firestone fan."
"Firestone Walker Pale 31 pours a brilliantly clear goldenrod, darkening towards orange when the beer's less well lit. A light dusting of white foam caps the beer, but doesn't provide much opportunity for either head retention or lacing. The nose has a nice floral aroma, offset by some juicy grapefruit notes. It doesn't quite jump out if the glass as much as it could though. The flavor is fantastic, just about perfectly balanced for a pale ale. There's a solid foundation of caramel sweetness right up front. The bitterness that comes through is enough to let you know it's there, but definitely stays short of IPA level intensity. The hoppy close is that classic floral, citrus grapefruit flavor. If I had to nitpick, I would say that the finish could stand to be a little more intense/vibrant, but it's pretty close. The body is nice, a little bit solid while not becoming too heavy for a sub 5%ABV beer. The carbonation is definitely a touch muted though. Pale 31 is another reminder that I should consider myself lucky to have Firestone Walker readily available locally."

"This is, as other people have mentioned, like a miniature or junior Union Jack. It has the same, or similar hop profile, but with a light body to it; my only knock."
"Bottle poured into glass"
"Overall: An exceptional(ly) hoppy APA. I enjoyed it, but maybe a bit overdone."
""
"O: This Ale is a great thing, impressive hop flavours, the spotlight is on the hops, the dry hopping gives it a flavour that is not present with traditional hop use. Great stuff!"
"O: Truly a session beer for the hop inclined. Not even 5% alcohol and an ass kicking amount of flavor and balance. Goes good with fried chicken, too!"
"Pours a clear, gold/amber color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, slight pale malt, slight sweet malt, and hint of alcohol, and a hint of caramel malt. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, slight hop oil, sweet malt, slight pale malt, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, good appearance, decent aroma, body, blend, and feel."
""
""
"One finger off white head over clear medium amber body. Bready, biscuity malts dominate the nose with floral notes. Taste is certainly malt forward but not in a heavy way, the brown bread taste is complemented by toasted oak notes and floral hops, an interesting taste profile. Mouthfeel is medium, not overly aggressive mouthfeel, decent effervescence. A world-class session ale. Highly recommended."

"Here is an excellent, crisp, tasty pale ale from FW. Golden body with nice clarity. Light hoppy smell and taste, notable carbonation to keep it interesting. It's not as bitter as one may expect from a pale ale, but for me that makes it a refreshing take on the style. It's a simple, but marvelously executed beer. A great anytime pale ale."

"I was initially concerned when I popped the cap and foam began to slowly seep up through the neck, but it stopped shortly thereafter and allowed me to pour it into a glass. I ended up with a finger of French Vanilla-colored head with moderate retention. Color was a deep golden-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very pine-like and my mouth began to water in anticipation. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops were immediate upon making contact with my tongue. Man, this was pretty intense for an APA, but I was not complaining, believe me! Finish was pleasantly dry and the malt even made an appearance. Lots of sticky lacing was in evidence as I finished the glass."

"O: Really nice offering, but nothing special. I probably wouldn't pick it up again. 3.5"
"Here's a nice little easy-going pale ale. I had this while I was waiting for the Funky Buddha Berliner weisses to go on. Served in a shaker, a clear golden color with a delightful puff of white head that sank quite a bit, but left some nice lacing on the way down. Not much in the aroma from what I could perceive anyway; light toasted grains, floral hops, pretty standard stuff. Taste of sweet biscuity malts, nicely balanced by fresh floral hops, slight citrus notes. Light, crisp, basic. Light body and easily drinkable."
""
""
"O- Love the dank, resiny pine and floral notes that are written all over this beer. Made its way up with some of the best, and its readily available. Solid 4 all the way across."
""
"Overall: A well-crafted take on the style. It's no Double Barrel Ale, but it carries the same level of balance as I've come to expect from Firestone Walker."
""
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and some pine aromas. Taste is of malt, herbal/pine hops, and some citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pale ale with a nice balanced malt and hop flavor that is easy drinking."
""
""
"O: Drank this way too fast; overall its a perfect light summer hoppy session ale. Not overwhelming in any category, just plain solid."
""
"I am actually surprised at how much I like this beer. The hops in this beer are unlike anything I've encountered from Firestone Walker, and I approve. I hope this starts to show up on the East Coast because I would drink this often."
"Overall: A highly drinkable balanced Pale Ale. Expertly brewed, but I prefer them a bit hoppier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is nice dryish orange-bread crust with spicy peppery citrusy bitterness, jammy citrus and spicy bitterness. It’s nice, well-made and nicely integrated as Firestone Walker beers seem always to be, but not great, and a bit to utterly “west coast” for my tastes."

"The light body is easy-drinking and certainly refreshing. The carbonation is only slightly fizzy, making this beer crisp and easy-swallowed."

"Fairly light in body, with carbonation high enough to make this foam up gently on the palate. The result is a pillowy mouthfeel, which suits the beer fairly well. Finish is semi-dry."

"O - Overall, I felt it was a good pale ale. Could be better, but definitely not bad."
"O: This is an A pale ale for me. Not up there with Zombie Dust or Headwaters but very good."
"Carbonation was crisp, body pretty light, and the finish was short and dry. Tasty but not exactly exceptional or memorable for me. Perhaps a little unexciting?"
""
""
"I've had this beer many times, both on tap and in the bottle. It has never tasted the same each time. Fortunately, this time (out of the tap), it suited my taste better than any other. It pours a beautiful golden color with a distinct citrus bouquet. No head at all, but this is likely the bar tender's choice in the way she poured to fit as much beer in the pint as possible. An easily discernible citrus up front with an alternating citrus and less present pine at the finish. A well-balanced grain and hop concoction. An excellent example of a pale ale. A competitor for Sierra Nevada as a go to, quintessential American pale ale."
""
""
""
"Well crafted pale, exceptional balance, albeit very simple and mild. Very drinkable, a good craft entry beer."
"Note: My bottle did not have a 31 on it, it just said Pale."
""
"O: A middle-of-the-pack PA."
"O: Very drinkable pale. Light and refreshing. Great citrus and juicy hops. For a low abv pale it has good complexity. I recognize it's very good but I'm not in love with it. I'd always reach for a Dale's instead. Above average though."
""

"decent pale ale, if a bit boring. pours a nice looking honey color crystal clear with a 2 inch white head that lazes around the whole time. smells like a beer, period. flavor is light and citrusy with a crystal and pale malt body. mouthfeel is fine, well carbonated and crisp. good pale ale but nothing special. on the lighter side, very sessionable especially at the low abv"

"This is an excellent pale ale, in fact, its one of the best I have ever had. Its on par with Stone's Pale ale, which is a beer I cant help to compare hoppy pale ales to. This beer is excellent and I wish Firestone was in my area but sadly, I enjoyed this beer in Utah."
""
"Pours a light golden color. There’s a nice, inviting hop aroma to this. It’s sweeter than I remember, with a crisp finish. Not as hoppy as expected—or remembered. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a tasty pale ale. But—I almost hate to say it but I prefer the Mission St. Ale over this."
""
""
"Light to medium body. Great tasting Pale Ale with a crisp clean finish. A great refreshing summer beer and a great example of a pale ale"
""
""
"O - I like this quite a bit. Similar to a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale although with less ABV (and calories), which is pretty impressive. Great session beer."
"Eerily close to the Trader Joes Mission St. Pale Ale???? Dun Dun Dunnn"
"Firestone Pale Ale comes into the glass a whistling golden slight copperish color with a nice amount of white suds up top leaving nice streaks. Smell is very citrusy and biscuit malt forward, a nice breadiness comes up. Taste takes a backseat from the scent. Flavors include biscuits from the pale malt, light pine over citrus from the hops. Feel is light and refreshing though with spot on carb. Finishes clean as can be. I drank this very quick and I hope to god FS sends very fresh stuff by the time summer comes around."
""
""
"12 oz bottle pours a medium amber with sufficient head and lacing. Grapefruit and berry aroma. Taste is subdued tart blackberries, caramel, and grapefruit. Light mouthfeel, rather thin. Overall a decent beer, certainly sessionable but not something I'd typically keep stocked in the fridge."
"This is a California style APA and I couldn't find any info about that style. Maybe a hoppy steam beer. I thought this beer pretty good even with the lighter taste, could be a session or yard beer perhaps."
""
"For me, this beer is a tweener. It tries to be hoppy like an APA but also tries to be smooth and highly drinkable like an English pale ale. It's tasty, but if I wanted something more hop-forward I'd go with SNPA or Liberty Ale, and if I wanted something smoother or more sessionable I'd go with an English-style pale pale."
"Pours yellowish golden with a white head. Aroma is citrus, a touch floral, and light cereal grains Flavor follows suit with the cereal grains giving off a little more sweetness than was found in aroma. A thin, active mouthfeel. overall, solid apa."
""
""
"Overall I like this beer. It's fairly easy to drink, and thought it is 4.8% alcohol, it has a good bite of bitterness to it, and the hop profile is more in vein of an IPA, though probably more drinkable to the average beer drinker. I think beers like this are really important for the craft beer market... a mid priced 6 pack, that is quite drinkable, and could possibly win over some drinkers of more commercial beers. Taste wise I feel like this tastes like a very mild IPA, and because I love IPAs, I think this is a great introduction to stronger and more hopped up beers."

"Bright yellow-orange, very clear, great head. Smells very hoppy for a pale ale, citrus fruits like lemon and orange come to mind. Flavor is more of the same but this is not an IPA, it feels lighter in body and so easy to drink. I think I found my new go to pale ale because this has less alcohol than Sierra Nevada and I might just prefer the hop profile, great stuff."

"T, Hard to drink kind of taste, some people may like it, but not me, not much sweetness. I will say on the bitter side."
""
"I liked this one... even following Union Jack and Double Union Jack, this one was assertive and tasty.."
"This is a very easy drinking beer that is on the dry side. This is a beer that you could really drink a few of as it's lighter in body but full of flavor. They call it a California Pale Ale but I would like to make it my House Pale Ale."
"Overall, a solid west coast pale ale with a fairly assertive hop presence but still an easy drinking pale ale feel."
"Tap handle only read ""Pale Ale," which is apparently the alias for this beer. Bright amber pour with moderate, fluffy head. Nice bittering up front, leaning toward herbal. A touch of fresh hop oil flavor popped in the background. Drank much bigger than the 4.8% abv would suggest. Had I known it was such a session candidate, I probably would have stuck with this for another pint (or two)."
"Still, this is a nice APA, and a cracker for such a rather ubiquitous brew, at least around these parts. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"O - I think this is another great pale ale. Seems as though I can't go wrong with this style."
"A very drinkable brew. If it were available in my area and at a reasonable price it could be a staple at my house."
"Pours a nice golden amber color with a quick disappearing head. Smells like bubblegum.. kind of a sweet aroma. But the taste is not sweet at all.. has a ok mouth feel.. nice hop flavor with out being too bitter.. I don't really like this beer that much... it's not bad or anything... I would just rather drink a Sierra Nevada pale ale."
"O: I really like this beer, a solid pale ale that I know will pretty much always be good."
"I would not hesitate to go back to this in a flash if i was in the US. This bottle was good, have a feeling it was not that fresh, but still was a good overall beer. Do want to get my hands on a bottle or 6 when i eventually head across to California."
"O: Another good offering from Firestone. Not Great, but definitely good. Good summer/session beer."
"Have always loved this beer. Despite finally rating it, I hardly think it changed from my first sip a few years ago. Crisp, clean and refreshing."
"A perfect session-able pale ale. Light in body and alcohol but big in flavor and hops. Dale's Pale Ale was always my go-to in this category but this one might just challenge it in the future."
"Feel: Light body with lots of carbonation. Mouth coating is nice."
"o: i think i found my new favorite APA.. watch out SNPA!"
"Overall a tasty simple ale that is highly quafffable."
"Drink- Pretty average, not that bad, but not that great either. Probably won't come back to this one."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and almost watery, with very light carbonation, a light body and an easy feel. High drinkability, as this is a very smooth and easy to drink; a definite session beer."
"Appears yellowish orange with a short frothy head, plenty of clarity but still a bit of chill haze. Smells citrus forward with a touch of floral hops. Very crisp, tastes like floral hops and grapefruit up front, smooth malty middle and a quick bitter finish. Medium bodied, the carbonation is much more prominent than expected for the serving type. This is flavorful, not too strong in alcohol content, and fits the style well."
"The first impression is that this is very similar to Little Creatures Pale Ale - one of my all-time favourite beers. While the hop character is perhaps not quite as good as in that classic beer, I am seriously impressed by the malt profile of this beer. Beautifully balanced and very drinkable."
"Overall -This beer really stands out. Just spent a week in California drinking dozens and dozens of great beers and this pale ale stands out from it all! Had it on tap and in the bottle. Perfectly balanced flavorful pale ale. I'm inspired to brew a clone!"
"This is my first time enjoying Pale 31 in any format, and the cask suits it well. Good flavor, fine feel. An enjoyable pale from state number 31."
"Bottle. Poured into my favorite DFH tulip glass a clear golden orange color with a 1 finger white head that quickly settles to form a white coaster on top of the beer. Slight floral and a dose of mild citrus greats the nostrils upon the first whiff, rather nice, mild breadiness as well. The flavor is nice with a soft sweetness and light bitterness from the hop additions. Medium mouthfeel. Some watered down mandarin orange type flavors. Overall, a nice, easy drinking beer with some full flavors."
"A really nice pale ale. Just enough hoppiness with a clean and refreshing malty body."
"Overall, a great session beer."
"A pleasant and flavorful, simple, citrus-hop-forward American pale ale."
"Overall this beer is OK. I'm honestly very disappointed with everything I've had form Firestone (minus Velvet Merkin). This is not a bad beer, but a poor representation of the style. It honestly tastes like an average homebrew. I actually take that back, I have had better extract based homebrew pale ales than this."
"Pours a small one finger white head that has already gone down to half a finger, it's clear it doesn't want to give me much head. The head is mostly big bubbles, a few small. The body is pretty standard, medium carbonation, pretty see through, but by no means clear, amber-orange in color. It for sure looks like a legit pale ale, the body looks nice, pretty standard but nice, the head is now gone, and I was not impressed with it. Overall an ok look, but nothing special. Nice northwest hops on the smell, very clean smelling, nice and hoppy with a good malt note as well. Probably some fruit, maybe grapefruit, along with a citrucy smell. It smell very good, pretty excited about the taste! Well, for the taste, the first thing I get is a nice mixture of clean water and quality malt up front, and then it finishes with a nice hop bite. There should be more hops in this, and frankly more flavor, but overall it's pretty dang tasty. For sure and clean and refreshing beer, nice on a hot day. I don't know if the taste deserves a 4 or not, because the taste isn't too big, but it is really tasty and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is really really nice, the carbonation and thickness of the beer are both perfect for a pale ale. Overall a really good beer, not outstanding, but super super easy to drink and very tasty."
"Drinkability: reasonable ($6.99/six) and light enough to drink a full six pack on a summer afternoon on your porch."
"This brew pours a very light see through golden hue with average carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head and some sporadic lacing,the smell is piney hops,apricots and boiled candy,it has a light bodied well carbonated mouthfeel that could be abit less in my mind and has tastes of passionfruit,apricots,mangoes,boiled candy and finished with a light touch of piney hops and to be honest its quite quaffable without being stand outish cheers."
"A crystal clear apricot with a faint white fizzy head. This is a hoppy Pale Ale with pine and grassy notes and good citrus scents in the background. This is the beers strong point in my opinion and I had to give it an extra 1/2 point just now for smelling so damn good. The taste is Pale Ale up front and IPA citrus on the back. A bit of clove spice gives it a Pilsner feel. The mouthfeel is semi dry and light. Definitely a pretty nice beer."
"Very subtle tones. Good flavors, and very sessionable. Won't knock your socks off, but I could drink a bunch of these."
"Bottled 3/18/11, so this guy's less than a month old. One of my favorite go-to pale ales for sure. Pours a clear, pale, golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very lovely with nice, subtle hops and malt. Some citrus and floral notes with a hint of grain. Taste is very well-balanced and complex with malt and hop flavors. Some floral notes in the finish along with a bit of citrus bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Drinkability is very high. Overall, a very solid pale ale when fresh. I've had this beer old, and still a good beer, but nowhere near when it is fresh like this. Very sessionable."
"Overall - While it is a very good pale ale, it seemed to be lacking something. It was highly drinkable, just not very exciting. It would probably work well as a session beer as it isn't too overpowering."
"Drinkability: Drinkable, affordable, and accessible. I will be introducing this pale ale into my rotations."
"Overall out of the cask it's a little different, but it's quite tasty and super sessionable as well. This almost feels like a mix somewhere between an on tap and cask Ale, sort of a middle ground between both worlds."
"do - Overall a very nice pale ale. Not overly strong in any sense, but a lot of nice floral and citrus hops to it. Would have again and a good beer to start a session with."
"I will try another one later to make sure this is representative. This isn't representative of Firestone-Walkers beers, which can be great."
"D: Hardly a little brother to Firestone's Union Jack, this beer is a decent pale with some assertive English qualities on display. It lacks any West Coast hop profile which seems surprising for a beer labeled a 'California pale ale' by its own brewer, yet it generates some interest with more traditional qualities while keeping the abv low and appropriate."
"D: An easily drinkable, nicely balanced pale ale from Firestone Walker. A bit on the thin/light side, but not overly so. There's surely a time and a place for this kind of quaffable brew, even if it's not the most thrilling version of the style."
"Very drinkable, light-ish beer"
"After 14 hours on a flight from Australia and being away for 10 days what a welcome sight find a Californian pale ale. This ale is very good, but not the greatest by any stretch. The color was a nice amber with a sweet scent of hop and citrus! It was a very light ale that can be drunk in mass quantity....inm other words SESSION!!! Stay thirsty my friends!."
"nothing ground breaking, but still drinkable"
"Color is light golden yellow and is hazy. It has a white head that stuck around for most of the drink. Aroma is light, but I got some citrus. Flavor is mostly piney hops, and it's the predominant flavor in the beer. I was surprised to see that it was rated at only 38 IBUs. I expected it to be much higher. It has nice malts in the background. Body is light and it's very drinkable. Pale 31 has a similar creamy mouth feel that I noticed in Solace. I wonder if this is a result of fermenting in oak barrels?"
"D- I love this beer, I think I already made that clear. It might be a hometown pride, but personally I just think its because its that good."
"Definitely a sessionable beer if you like citrus."
"Mouthfeel is straight up thin - again, disappointing after having some other excellent APAs in the last couple days. Great session beer, a bit underwhelming compared to some of firestone walker's other offerings though."
"D- Not a bad pale ale, just maybe a bit too sweet. Easy to drink and I could do this one again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it was a nicely flavored and easy drinking beer. It wasn't overwhelming with flavors but I found it nicely balanced with some very nice but subtler flavors. A very nice APA overall."
"D: A very drinkable and tasty pale ale. Well balanced and the low ABV means you can put down several in one sitting."
"Drinkability- If the intent was to create a very sessionable beer as low ABV would seem to indicate, then this is a great end result. Hot weather or any time really-a winner."
"D: A little on the bready sweet side for my taste buds. Still a decent taste buds. Sill a decent APA though."
"It's orange with decent lacing, lots of bubbles, Smell is mild lemon peel,citrus. Taste is a little butter, some wood and mineral earth, sharp clean finish. Very nice carbonation, medium-bodied. A great pale ale in cask, all add up to one drinkable beer. I loved it."
"Mouthfeel is light and breezy, very easy to drink beer. I like it. I like their Double Jack better, though."
"If you like bitter beers, this could be a new favorite."
"Not flashy, but another well-crafted brew from Firestone Walker. Balanced and refreshing."
"D - Quite drinkable - low ABV, non-offensive beer."
"Pours dark orange, lots of suspended bubbles, no head just a little froth. Smell is mild citrus peel, blossoms, wood. Taste is a little buttery, lots of citrus, some wood and mineral earth, sharp clean finish. Very fine carbonation, medium-bodied, almost rich. Goes down beyond smooth: this one's made for cask."
"Tastes are in balance quite well in my opinion. Starts off hop centric for a pale ale with a prominent dry earthy/lemony combo. The malt backbone is a lot stronger than I expected in a west coast beer, especially one so low in ABV. Hints of caramels and biscuity malts as well. More dry bitter earthy hops and citrus sweetness in the dry finish. Overall this is a good beer I would defintely order again and session but not one I NEED to have again or will go out of my way for."
"Appears a light pale golden hue with a bright white head, fine speckled lacing. Aroma has brilliant citrus/tea leaf/herbal grassy notes. Pale biscuit malt breadiness sneaks out amongst the wave of hops coming at me. Flavors are completely cohesive with malts and hops working together so well. Below 5% this is some excellent hop forward session ale, biscuit malt delicate bready profile with citric, earthy, floral hops. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied sturdy spritzy carbonation goes down smooth. Drinkability was wonderful world class pale ale excellent stuff that deserves all of the accolades that they have gained recognition for."
"The drinkability is good, it's not a chugger but you can definitely session this brew to your hearts content."
"Seeing this one on tap next to Union Jack and Double Jack, I didn't have a whole lot of interest in trying this one. After trying it, I was very pleasantly surprised. Poured a nice light golden color with a big white head. Great citrusy hoppy aromas lead nicely to a perfectly balanced palate. An excellent pale ale."
"D: Very smooth and easily drinkable -- this would make a really nice session beer -- if only it were available in this area."
"D-Tasty, though nothing special, I suppose. Still, quite drinkable. Easy and enjoyable."
"The flavor is mostly of hops. Not a lot of malt sweetness to speak of. I'd call this one a nice choice for someone who wants a hoppy little beer without the high ABV penalty or a lot of sweetness.I only bought a single bottle to sample, wish I bought more."
"Pours a very clear melted butter color with a yellow tinge and a white fluffy soapy head. Massive head retention and beautiful. Aromas are very strong for an apa. I get tangerine, musky grapefruit and some sweet salted caramel on the nose. The flavor is very balanced. Really a nicely crafted brew. You can taste the care and effort put I to this. Love how smooth this is yet it has a very nice mandarin orange finish. Mouthfeel is very smooth, perfect. Has a great crisp finish, balanced malts with fresh tasting hops for balance. Really a near perfect apa. Honestly I love SNPA but this just got on the same level as it. Very smooth. Go out and get your hands on some."
"This is a very drinkable APA. Quite sessionable. It would be my go-to if it were available in Louisiana."
"This is a great drinking pale ale. Not too much hops but enought to keep a nice balance. Great mouthfeel and definitely a no brainer six pack purchase."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel was fair and drinkability excellent. Good beer from a great brewer."
"D: Low ABV and tasty, a good session beer. I'm not a big APA guy, but this one was very APA light.... Great Hops smell, but not overly bitter or over hopped. Nice little brew, good hoppy beer to start someone on."
"Not too complex of a beer, but at 4.8% it would make an excellent session brew. Very quaffable."
"The devil is in the details here. For a pale ale this has amazing taste. It won't kick you in the face but it's a pale so it's not supposed to. This one gets things right on all counts. If this was locally available I'd have to get a kegerator for this specific beer alone."
"D- This is very drinkable. A good lawnmower beer. Not too interesting but very smooth."
"Pours a light orange, thin head. Smells slightly spicy and peppery. Taste has modest underlying notes of sweet malts, honey-like, overlaid by a nice peppery bitterness. Good carbonation gives a full mouthfeel, spiciness and clean taste make this nearly a session beer."
"I could drink this all day long."
"it tastes how it smells basically. the hops stand out but are in no way over powering and there is large fruit characteristic."
"D: Ok, and with improvements could be a great beer."
"This is nice summer beer to gulp at an outside BBQ. The color is a light amber with a strong frothy head that lasts to the very end. The aroma is slightly sweet with notes of citrus and hops. Once this beer hits your palate you feel refreshed but if you are looking for bold ale flavors and complexity you will not find it in this brew. The flavors of lemon zest, malt, and hops are faint, but incredibly smooth and enjoyable in the sun. I like this beer because you have enjoy the true beer flavors and have a few without feeling weighed down. I will drink this again, but only on a hot summer day."
"Taste, a non bitter pale. Ample hopping for style, nuanced sweetness with it. Good session ale. Light in the heft on the palate, mouthfeel doesn't thin out, but doesn't weigh you down (sounds like a macro jingle). a little cost prohibitive for something this simple ($8 a 6r)."
"D - God I don't think Ive had a better Pale Ale since I first tried Sierra Nevada Pale Ale! I loved everything about this beer, especially it's fresh, floral aroma, and it's fresh grapefruit flavor. I could quaff a sixer or more, I'll definitely buy this beer again, recommended. Cheers!"
"The hops seem to be a little more present than what i'm used to tasting and smelling in a pale ale but that's certainly nothing to complain about. This beer is very drinkable and goes down great. For what it is, it has great flavor! Definitely recommend."
"Very good APA overall. FW does a nice job with this and their private label APA, which I actually prefer to Pale 31. Great session beer to have around during the warmer months."
"D: Goes down easily, not too filling, as I mentioned in the taste this is a very hop forward APA but well done in my opinion."
"Very much drinkable as the low abv helps this brew quench your thirst on a hot day."
"D - A nice lighter IPA that doesn't destroy the taste buds. A fairly easy drinking beer. I'm not big on Pale Ales or IPAs but I enjoyed this beer quite a bit."
"Fairly light on the palate, and fairly drinkable, at least for me. I wouldn't mind having another of these right after the first, which is not something I typically say about pale ales."
"All in all this is a decent APA. It would be nice to see a little more flavor and maybe a bit more body. I know it can be done, even with beers under 5% ABV. Getting this fresh from the tap may increase the hop flavor, which would be a bonus for this beer. Worth trying, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"Drinkability: This is a really good beer. What a surprise. Flavorful, refreshing, poundable."
"Overall this is a great alternative to the mass produced crap beers out there. I think it would be a good one to give a friend or relative that only drinks bud light or some similar nastiness."
"Drinkability> Good."
"Overall: The mouth feel is boring, carbonated, and slightly crisp. The body of the beer is light and the finish is medium light. I was hoping more from Firestone Walker but I get this boring interesting poor pale ale."
"D: Perfect abv for the style and the clean crisp flavor and smooth carbonation make it perfectly drinkable! I guess the last bottle I had was old or lightstruck because this is a much better beer than I remember!"
"Pours a very clear, pale yellow color body, big white foamy head, big bubbles, lasting. Very hoppy aroma, citrus and dry. Some sweetness too. Bitter. Pale dry taste, drying citrus. Mostly clean aftertaste. Nice pale ale. Not complex, but good, almost sessionable."
"Overall: Better than I thought. The balance of hops was just right. The sweet aftertaste complimented the initial rush of hops. Good beer, I could drink a couple before the hops flavor would start getting to me."
"As I sat there drinking a few glasses of this beer from tap over the course of a few days I wondered if it was perhaps as good as it gets for a session beer. Perfectly balanced, a nice hop presence without being overly bitter, and extremely drinkable. Very good out of the bottle, fantastic when fresh from a local tap."
"D - Light ABV and not overbearing, easy session."
"one thing i noticed: this beer really needs to be fresh. maybe the lower abv doesn't do as much to keep the hop flavor fresh compared to 7% IPAs, but if you get can't get this on tap, look at the neck carefully and you'll see the bottled-on date. My latest 6 was bottled a month ago, but my prior one was 2.5 months before i drank it, and the younger beer is much hoppier."
"Overall I was a little let down by this Pale Ale. Coming from the same brewery as their amazing IPA, I was hoping for something more but got a rather mellow Pale Ale. Still worthy of a try."
"Low alcohol and balanced flavors make this an excellent choice for a session beer."
"Mouthfeel is a medium with a with a crisp finish."
"D: Low ABV and drinks pretty easy. Nothing too stand out, though."
"This is a really good example of an American pale ale that goes for balance rather than power. Very drinkable. 12 oz bottle to glass. Dark yellow to orange color, soap suds head. Smell is pine and citrus hops. Taste is well balanced between malt and hops, not too bitter, finishes quite dry and refreshing."
"The beer pours bright yellow with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a light pale and malty scent along with mild hop aroma and a light oak barrel presence. The aroma is quite complex and highly enticing. The taste is decent. It has a thin pale and bisquit malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes bitter with a nice hoppy aftertaste. The barrel taste really covers up the simple, yet refreshing pale malt flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine pale ale."
"D- High. Sessionable. This is one of the best pales I've ever had, I'd buy this on the regular if it was in my distribution circle. Very great beer. You can have flavor without going overboard! Amazing beer!"
"D - Very tasty and low in alcohol, I could suck down a bunch of these in a row. Great overall."
"Pretty hop forward for a pale ale with a prominent dry earthy pine presence that's complimented by a sweet citrus lemongrass/grapefruit character. The malt backbone is a lot stronger than I expected in a west coast beer but provides excellent balance. Hints of caramel, butterscotch and biscuit. More dry bitter earthy hops and citrus sweetness in the dry finish."
"At The Blind Tiger, NYC: hopefully I'm reviewing the correct beer, as the beer I had was 'Firestone Walker Nectar Pale Ale', but I don't see anything else on the list that resembles what I had. Anyway, this beer poured orange copper with a very thin white head and spotty lacing. The aroma was dominated by pine, with only feint hints of grass, lemon, and yellow grapefruit. The flavor was a nicely balanced mix of piney hops and malt throughout, with a smooth finish. Nice carbonated mouthfeel makes for a good session pale ale, but if this beer had a more varied flavor profile (e.g. more than just pine), it would be fantastic."
"Drinkability: Goes down like water. Super pale malty and earthy hoppy water. Totally sessionable but the flavor profile isn't to my liking enough to give it a 5.0 in this dept."
"Beer is medium body, so that's good. The flavors are mild and understated, which is fine. The sweetness I smelled is present in the beer, for sure. There isn't a lot of bitterness, no aftertaste, I'm not sure how the different flavors are playing together, they all seem disconnected. Drinkability is fine so is mouthfeel."
"Very thirst quenching, and sessionable - reminds me more of NW pale ales rather than those from NorCal...I like this more than Sierra Nevada, though I'd rather have a Mirror Pond given the option."
"A great example of west coast pale ale."
"A clean yellow beer with a small white head that leaves a nice bit of lace on the glass as you drink. Has a nice light prickly, piney hop aroma with a promising malt note in the background. The flavor starts with a light tea like bitterness. Followed by a smooth biscuit malt note. The finish delivers the piney hop character advertised in the aroma. A nice beer.thanks john"
"This was one of four beers in a flight that I had and the others may have been a bit overpowering to really enjoy this beer but in general I liked it a lot. Great golden color, good aroma, mouthfeel and flavor were very good and the low abv makes it very sessionable."
"D: Very easy to drink with quite a good flavor and excellent appearance... the perfect session APA."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"D - Not a bad pale ale, although I found this to be sweeter than hoppier overall. Decent enough, but nothing to rave about."
"Poured a light golden color with small head that dissapates. Nose of very subtle hops. Tastes is hoppy that's not too overpowering, keeps in balance overall. Some subtle floral and pine notes. Extremely drinkable and tasty, dangerously good! One great Pale! A perfect example of a West Coast Pale!"
"overall, a great pale ale with a great california flavor. i dig this, big time."
"D: Quite good in this department. A nice, low abv beer with plenty of hops--my definition of great session-style drinkability."
"This seemed to be a very fresh keg and it was full of citrus kick. It was consumed on a warm summer's night and it hit the spot."
"D. fantastic refreshing brew, perfect flavor profile"
"D - A great pale ale w/ plenty of hop flavor, citrus and still mostly balanced - perhaps one of the best I've had."
"This beer is plentiful in central Cali. 4.8% abv makes this a very drinkable beer."
"Not necessarily something I'll be drinking again any time soon--far too many better examples of the style for me. I expected a bit more from a company with a ""passion for the pale"". But that's alright, it's a well crafted pale ale nonetheless. Just no my favorite. Cheers."
"D - These are quite poundable for a craft beer. Alcohol is low at 4.8%, flavors are smooth and well rounded, and not at all powerful. Everything is on the reserved side, but blend together well to create a nic, well rounded beer. Great lawnmower beer."
"Overall- Creamy smooth and nicely balanced."
"Though not as common as the Double Barrel Ale, this is often a proper choice in an otherwise bleak grocery store environment. I snag a six pack of this one when I find it on sale. Recommended for an everyday pale."
"overall a very nice pale ale."
"D- They called this a California Pale Ale. It is very drinkable."
"Drinkability- ok might drink it again, had it at a bar in Morro Bay, not tto bad would drink it again"
"I like this beer. nice golden color, mellow hop smell and a somewhat sweet/hop taste with the sweetness lingering just a bit. very easy to drink and it feels good in the mouth with some light carbonation. a solid beer for a hot summer afternoon (or morning here in my case)."
"Firestone Pale 31 looks and feels weak--too pale to be pale."
"I had this on tap during my trip to Monterey, and I think it was the best one I could find on tap. It poured a gold brown, and had a good hoppy nose, that got better as the beer warmed. Taste was nothing spectacular a bit blander than most pale ales I have had, and it was a little thin for a pale ale. Easy drinking though, and more flavorful than the Sierra Nevada. I shall probably have another pint or two this afternoon to confirm my findings."
"D= Overall, I found this to be a really well made and flavorful ale. Drinkability was extremely high...I could session this one all day and enjoy every minute of it!"
"D: I enjoyed this quite a bit. It's everything a pale ale and a session beer should be."
"Truly tasty APA. I love this brew. Another great Firestone brew."
"D: Drinkability is where this beer shines. There's just enough malt, yeast, and hop to give it some character, but not enough of any one - or all - to make it shine. But it's perfectly balanced and clean and fresh and easily quaffable!!! It's almost like 'American Pale Ale Light' to a certain extent - everything's there, but it's not nearly as full as you might expect. It's easy to drink, and there's certainly some flavor to it, and that keeps me wanting more... wanting to find those hops and malt and bitterness! But I never will, so I'll just have to have another. Pretty nice!"
"D: Greatly enjoyed this brew... not quite like the Pale Ale's out here on the east coast. Refreshing and enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel is light, there's some chewiness, and some really nice zing that comes from ?? somewhere. Drinkability? This brew is Super-Sessionable! With a 4.8 ABV, this ale is for sustained enjoyment. What a treat. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: My first beer from Firestone Walker and a good example of the style. Would I have it again? Absolutely. Will I? Unfortunately, due to distribution limitations, no."
"D - This is a high quality APA. I'm glad I was able to find one."
"I can understand why the bottle of this one says it is a ""California Pale ale"" instead of an APA; it is completely dominated by west coast style hops. Lots of bittering and citric hops. Good beer overall, but I like a little more balance in my APAs."
"Overall: this is my new favorite session beer. Beautiful. Good for adventurous newbies, too."
"Very good mouthfeel, moderate carbonation with a clean and semi-dry finish. Easy to drink."
"D. Easy to find, good beer at a moderate price. Nothing blows me out of the water but an all together very good beer across the board. Could see myself bringing to a few BBQ's this summer."
"D: Looks good, smells good, tastes good. Very sessionable APA."
"The appearance is a deep yellow tone with a thin head that quickly becomes a thin ring. The smell is light hops and faint spice. The taste is crisp and perfect for a pale ale, a little bit of that bite too. Mouthfeel is barley, some hops, very clean and well balanced. Drinkability is good on this beer, the first time that I have every drank a Firestone. It is a great pale ale."
"a bright deep gold color with a white head that dissipated rather quickly. Piny citrus aromas of hops are the first major factor of this beer. the hops turn really muddy and bland from the aroma to the taste. They really turn into a middle of the road mild malt flavor and finish with nothing left over. The mouthfeel is light and pseudo dries out, but leaves a slight residual sweetness making me want another sip. I like this beer, great for the summer weather and an easy sessionable ale."
"D - A good session beer that is well balanced and maybe just a touch bland but a 6er would be nice on a hot summer day. It has a refreshing quality that a nice crisp pilsner would have."
"D - A wonderful APA leaning more towards the hoppy side...this is a dangerously drinkable beer"
"Drinkability? Good tasting and very easy drinking. This is a very enjoyable example of the style."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Flavor is of buttery bread, sweet candied malts, and finishes with just a touch of hoppy bitterness. With the low ABV and great flavor profile, this has got to be one of the most drinkable APAs I've ever had. I could drink these one after the other all summer long. Recommend."
"Great session brew. I still want to know if firestone walker is the dude from the bachelor?"
"Pours a golden color with very little white head that quickly leaves little or no lacing at all. Smell is very slight hoppy/citrus, which is pretty much what I am expecting. Taste is much of the same, very slight hoppy/citrus notes, very clean finish. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and clean with a small amount of carbonation. A really good Pale Ale that is perfect during the hot summer months."
"M/D - light bodied and nice carbonation. not bad for the style but nothing too outstanding. Just a nice APA."
"Pours a clear gold with a decent head. Smell is, uh, good! Citrus hops; I'm happy with this. Taste is good clean crisp bitter hops. Very nice. Smooth brew. I like this one. Could easily sit back with a sixer and some Married with Children reruns."
"Pours translucent light amber to orange, with thin white head. Nose is suggesting orange candy to me, with some ripe fresh orange juicy notes - both natural citrus and candied orange. Palate has a nice balance of malt with hops, but it is rather light bodied and weak in flavor. Finish is light as well. Decent drinkability but nothing to be excited about."
"Firestone Walker is new to PA. Picked up a single bottle at The Beer Stop for $2. Poured into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a clear golden yellow color with about half an inch of quickly fading off white foam. Smells lemon, tangerine, biscuits, and pine. Tastes of bitter orange peel, bready malts, maybe a touch of grapefruit pith. Slightly thin bodied with medium carbonation. Dry, bitter finish. Not too shabby for an APA."
"I haven't tried a bad Firestone Walker beer yet. This one's no exception. It's fairly straight forward and really doesn't have any special qualities that grab you, but it's a nice representation of the style. There are a number of better APAs, but Pale 31's probably second tier for the style. A little more body (and hops) would improve it, but I don't have any material criticism for it. It's pretty damn good as it is. Thanks, Todd."
"D - A very sessionable Pale Ale... Terrific nose and above average in all other categories..."
"While Firestone is responsible for making what are arguably the best examples of such beers (Firestone 10, 11) it's good to know they put every bit the same craftsmanship and attention into their normal lineup of pale ales too. Between the Double Barrel, the Union Jack IPA and now the Pale 31, I would say with little hesitation that Firestone is responsible for some of the best simple but solid drinking ales on the entire continent. Thanks BuckeyeNation!"
"Just a decent, solid pale ale, but not dissimilar to so, so, so many others out there in craft and brewpub world. Thanks to msubulldog25 for sending this bottle--a more reliable and downright cool trader you'll not find."
"Drinkability: A decent pale ale, but it doesn't compare to some of the other great ones out there. I would drink it again."
"Mouthfeel thinner than expected. Some slickness."
"D- This is a decent-definitely above average APA that, to me, is pretty typical for the style. It really doesn't have anything unique and it is quite drinkable-but not my favorite APA. I'm all over the place with this style as it is and this example falls somewhere in the middle of the road."
"D: Good session beer, very tasty, I'd love to have this one on tap. All around great beer, I'll have to find out where John got it so I can snag some more of it. Tasty beer!"
"I could have 4 or 5 of these and be happy."
"Overall this is an APA that is actually an APA and doesn't try to do too much. Worth a shot."
"Yes, an ""exceptional"" for drinkability. 31 is now my new favorite number and (ironically) ended-up being #731 on my all-time taste list (an expensive collection with nothing to show for it). In any case, this was good stuff. The photo on the bottle was ""right on," as the beer poured gorgeous gold into the glass with a nice had that quickly dissipated and left very delicate lacing on the glass. Very subtle fruity, piney hops were evident in the smell and that carried into initial taste. Nice balance of sweetness (very light) and the aforementioned hops, with a moderate malty body, punctuated by delicate carbonation. Those are two words I'd use a lot with this beer: delicate and subtle. Nothing ""in your face"" about it. No alcohol taste at all, with a very slight dry bitterness at the end. I never put the glass down--and it tasted great right through to the warmer last few swallows. It's an excellent session beer you'd never grow tired of. Clearly a winner all the way around."
"Taste is good but overall light in flavor."
"Notes from and tasted on: 1/26/09."
"Pours a noticeably light brownish yellow with a big pillowy white head that looks great in the glass. Smells of nice lemony hops and mild clean malt. Flavor is nice and subdued. Clean, easy drinking and sweet with a nice hop bitterness thats just aggressive enough to remind me that I'm drinking a intentionally restrained beer. I love that this isn't an IPA labeled as a pale ale and that its actually true to style, not overly bitter or hopped up beyond belief. Very easy to drink and delicious and an exemplary example of what a ""session"" beer can be when made well. Incidentally, this is my second FW beer (im starting off with their easy-to-find ones) and i've been VERY impressed with both."
"While this one won't go down as my favorite Pale Ale, I like it. I would still take a Sierra Nevada or something over it, but this one is a good choice if you prefer more of the piney/spicy flavors in your pale ale over the citrus."
"Drinkability is very high, this is a tasty but clean pale ale that's not to robust or strong but very satisfying, I can see really sucking down a bunch of this at a party. This immediately became my all time favorite APA, from a style that I granted don't normally much care for."
"3.5 D: Good drinkability in that it's very smooth, but simply too boring."
"Poured into straight pint glass. Poured with less than an inch of head that very quickly dissipated. Left light but sturdy lacing. A dark yellow color. Clarity is very good. Pleasant floral hop aroma with citrus notes. Flavor followed aroma closely, with the citrus flavors leaving a sharp taste. Body is what was expected for the style. Nicely drinkable. I received this as a gift, if this was available locally I would put this in my regular rotation."
"D - I liked this beer quite a bit its easy to drink with a nice citrus hop flavor that I could easily session"
"Very drinkable brew. The only difficult decision on my part is whether I enjoy Firestone 31 or Double Barrel more!"
"D - This a very drinkable APA. They were on sale for 5.99 a six pack and I am glad that I bought two."
"Very drinkable, way tasty session ale. Thank you barleywinefiend."
"Taste follows with a bit of light malts on the tongue and a slightly bitter and lingering close. Decent feel and drink but has a bit of an artificial sense on the nose and close. That aside this is a fairly smooth light pale ale."
"Would recomend this beer to both the beer snob and the beer novice!"
"NOTES: BBCSD-E2"
"A relatively modest abv for an American Pale, yet with strength in aroma and taste and a sturdy body. A great choice for a ""sessioner"" for those who like their pale ales edging on the hoppier aroma side!"
"""It's what we drink around here."""
"B'ham UK November 2008"
"T- A refreshing pale ale with a solid flavor profile."
"Whatever..very nice beer."
"Just bought another bomber. As good as the first. Exceptional APA. Buy some now. Especially at the low 4.8% abv. Great session beer."
"My last review contained a bit of a diatribe about bottle shape and label design, so I think that I'll continue that. This doesn't really have much to do with my enjoyment/review of the beer. I like Firestone's packaging. It's pleasantly understated compared to most beer labeling. The label is interesting but not crazy. The bottle has sort of a classic look. I like that they maintain their design across most of their beers. I don't love Firestone beers, but I like that they don't use each new beer has an opportunity for a new label design. Sometimes, that works, but not many other craft beer companies (admittedly, Firestone is rather large now and probably has a lot more budget for marketing) have such a solid, consistent look. There's something classy about such an understated look."
"D: The dry, crisp mouthfeel mixed with good carbonation makes this very drinkable. If this was readily available in my area, I'd seek it out for a night out at friend's."
"Drinkability: Almost like a ""Lite"" pale ale. Enough flavor and complexity to enjoy it, but your average Coors Light drinker could suck a Pale 31 down without complaining about the bitterness."
"I know many hold this up as one of the great pale ales, and I'm inclined to agree when you consider the whole package. It holds nearly the same depth of hop flavor as Sierra Nevada, but with a lighter body it's much more drinkable. The malts have a light bready malt taste, that's matched first by piney, citrus hops, and then later a spicy, long-lasting aftertaste. How this beer drinks actually reminds me of a good English bitter, for the ability to hold complex flavors in a light and highly sessionable beer."
"The aroma was fairly subdued. I got a little bit of fruitiness in the nose with a peach focus. The taste was clean malty with a slight bitterness on the back end. It was moderate to well carbonated with a tad bit of bite at the end of the drink. Definitely a session beer that would be a good barbeque brew in the summer. Overall not bad but could of used a bit of more hop presence in the beer."
"Good pale ale with complex flavors but not really great. I think I would still take a regular old Sierra Nevada over this or the regular Firestone."
"drinkability is great. great balance. nice malt and hop character both coming through strong. i could easily drink this all the time. good stuff!"
"D: if I lived out west this would be a go to session beer, good bitterness but not so much that I won't be able to taste my next beer not like SNPA which can tend to overload the palate. I wish we could get an APA like this in New England."
"Drinkability is great. And is easily this beers strong suit. This beer is not going to wow you at all. But it's quite tasty, yet light enough to be very sessionable. Seems like a hybrid pale that is part British and part American. Will be a great one to grab during our warm summers here in Northern California. I hope this stays around my local liquor shop for a while, because I'll be sure to grab it again."
"Pours a clear amber/golden, thin white head forms, drops down to a ring and leave some pretty lacing. Smell is real nice, biscuits, caramel, jasmine, citrus, very flowery hopping, just the right balance, very fresh aroma. Taste is great as well, very caramelized, bready, wheat, jasmine, floral, some light fruitiness and a bit grapefruit, very nice balanced finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with medium carbonation. Pretty standard pale ale, but damned fresh and goes down right. Very flavourful for a sub 5% brew, I like!"
"a very crisp and refreshing pale, light bodied yet sturdy enough, I like them hoppier but its tasty for a pale"
"Would go well with pretzels or something as there is a certain body to it, but stand-alone is meh."
"Very nice. One of the better pale ales I've had for sure. If only I could get more FW products here in PA."
"This beer shines in the glass orange/gold with a froathy head on top, very good lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma is mild, a mix of citrus, hops, and fresh-cut pine. Refreshing....yum. By the way, that's the taste I'm talking about. Clean upfront with a mix of bread/citrus/hoppy/floral flavors, the balance being good. This is one beer I'll be coming back to for sure, and it's great on a warm day like today."
"oak and hops are the flavors that jump out at you, this one is not anything special, i would drink this if it were avalable in new york, this one tates better as it warms up, a tuch of toffie and vanilla kick in as it warms. this one is an ok repersentation od a pale ale"
"Solid APA across the board, and definitely has the California vibe to it. Will make a return in my fridge as often as I can find it."
"Got this one on tap on my recent trip to Anaheim,at Tony Roma's,very nice butterscotch color to it with a slight tan head and mild lacing.Nose was of floral with a tinge of fruit and mild hops.Taste was mild fruit,peach tinge to it,very mild bitterness all going down rather easily,kinda watery but enjoyable,very lite and mild mouthfeel,overall,quite a nice brew and worth another shot."
"The color when poured, was of an amber golden yellow with a little foam that clinged to the side of the glass. The smell was of pine, with a hint of floral after notes. The taste was between an IPA and a Pale Ale. Nice balance of bitterness and smoothness on the aftertaste. Also, you can taste, beside the hops, the malts with a slight floral and a touch of spices!"
"This beer pours a light golden color with an almost nonexistent white head. I can taste some citrus flavors. This beer is much lighter than I expected and it goes down like water. Certainly not bad but not much going on here and not what I expected."
"this was a nice golded colored brew with a pleasent hop character. I had this on a very hot day with a barbeque diner. I would recommend this beer for a nice warm weather session beer. low abv and a nice clean hop flavor. yeah, this worked."
"."
"D: For 4.6%, this goes down easy but I'm not sure how many more I'd want"
"12oz bottle. Gold color with a firm white head. Hoppy and bright aroma, with some toasted malts. The flavor is light and drinkable, but with a nice hoppiness and medium bitter finish. I'm still not sure if they actually changed the recipe from the old pale ale, but the samples that I have had do seem hoppier and more flavorful than the old stuff."
"Not as big as a traditional non-traditional west coast APA, which is to say balanced and drinkable. Might be a good gateway beer with which to lure the beer-lover-to-be."
"Drinkability- I really enjoyed this IPA...errr, pale ale. Definitely recommended."
"Very smooth and drinkable. One of the better APAs Ive had. It reminds me a little of Stoudt's APA but I think this one might even be a little better."
"""Pale 31"" is light gold/amber with a thin white lace. Light aromas of citrus zest and a wisp of grain. Squeeky clean pale malt flavors with snappy bittering. A little cereal grain sweetness comes through in the middle, but quickly fades to a quenching dry finish. Thin but vibrant and bubbly on the palate. Fairly long, clean finish with some herbal hops and mineral in the aftertaste. Overall a pleasant and very clean pale ale, good for quaffing but not terribly exciting. Drinkable, but not interesting enough for a long session."
"I agree with overlord on this one. Not my style of pale ale at all. Pours an amber color with offwhite head. The best part was the smell. Nice floral and hop aroma with some biscuit and caramel undertones. Hits the palatte with a one liner hop profile which just happens to be one that I do not enjoy. The malt and biscuit come in last to clean it up but is still unbalanced and doesnt leave me happy. An ok pale ale but much better out there."
"Mouthfeel was okay. Bubbly, appropriate for the pale ale style. A nice little pale ale that's expensive for the style, but good."
"The mouthfeel was smooth and it had a medium body. The finish was relatively short with bitterness and citrus lasting on the tongue. Nicely drinkable, but the sweetness may be a turnoff to some here."
"Flavor is straight pale ale. Malts are bready and finish dry. Hops are floral and a bit piney. Nothing remarkable about this beer but that it is a solid pale ale. Dry finish that makes this beer even more easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel is exemplary, drinkability is high."
"Drinkability: This stuff goes down ridiculously easy; it's gone before you know it. The ideal session beer."
"This poured a clear gold with a little off-white head. It smelled like lemon and pine hops mixed with malt. It tasted like copper hops balanced evenly with malt. It was pretty thick and oily with a little carbonation, and had a very mild bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a good pale ale, but nothing too special."
"Overall I thought this was excellent, really a very nicely down pale, with very little errors at all. Lots of nice flavors with a good balance between bready and cereal like malts and the light floral hops, very nicely balanced. I would have loved to have had a few more of these as well. Definitely, a high quality session ale and something that I do not think I would ever turn down."
"Light clear amber pour with a fading white head. Smell is very sweet hops. Fresh and vibrant at first, followed soon by a bit of metal. A bit thin overall and I get a flavor of tea in this one quite a bit, along with some light honey like malt. Good carbonation, and while not offensive, pretty average, and needs more of a strong malt backing to shine. Decent."
"D: nice balance, easy to drink."
"Big piney hop aroma when first poured. Malt became apparent as hop aroma settled down. Clear golden/amber color with a frothy off-white head and minimal lacing. Very nicely balanced flavor. Malty, slight sweetness and caramel overtones nicely balanced by hop bitterness and a mellow hop flavor. Medium/light carbonation with a medium body and a fairly long finish. A good hybrid of British and American pale ale styles."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a light pale and bisquit malt scent along with mild hop aroma and a light oak barrel presence. The aroma is quite complex and highly enticing. The taste is decent. It has a thin pale and bisquit malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes bitter with a nice hoppy aftertaste. The barrel taste really covers up the simple, yet refreshing pale malt flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine pale ale. It's got an interesting flavor palate, but I could kill a sixer of these easy."
"D: This is a really good pale, up there with Anchor and Alpha King, possibly the best made in CA."
"D: Very drinkable beer, could session this one all night if only given the chance back home. Worth a try by all means."
"Tasty, session beer. Moderately bitter finish. Very enjoyable."
"D: The abv is perfect, as is the flavor. This is a solid APA, great taste and fantastic hop profile."
"Fantastic, and I live directly in the middle of the two breweries. Great stuff. I can't believe my first rating of this."
"Sessionable, serviceable, drinkable pale. Floral and citrus and malty aroma. Light colour with short-lasting foam. Tasty and citrus hops comcommitant with aggressive carbonation. Medium or less body. Slight better than average pale, average beer overall."
"D- It was so good I wish I had two more. Great trade Brad. Thanks, I don't think I could ever get it that fresh on this coast. It makes me want to move to Cali."
"An interesting beer. There are not many like it and that appeals to me. Something I would definitely have in my stock ready to go for the right meal. The site says Asian pan but it seems like it would go good with other things as well."
"Drinkability- It's okay. Not great. Pretty much like all of Firestone's beers."
"All pale should taste this good, worth checking out, but I am sure most of you already have"
"Flavor is grainy malt and husk with a bit of white grape and again floral hops coming through. An easy drinker not very complex but well crafted. The body was a little thin, but it is a pale ale."
"This is a hoppy Pale Ale, but it's not an IPA, which I was pleased to be the case. Too often a brewery will over hop it's standard Pale Ale and it just comes across as an IPA. This one does not and clearly holds it's ground in the Pale Ale category. It is an easy drinker for sure and is loaded with balanced flavour. This was a nice first sampling for me from the Firestone Walker folks."
"A very nice example of a less-aggressive American pale ale, very drinkable and refreshing. Strikes me as a good warm-weather beer, and a nice accompaniment to a cold deli sandwich and potato chips after mowing the lawn or washing the car. This would also be a good ""intro"" beer for converting a BMC drinker to craft beer."
"Pours a clear light copper hue with a white fluffy one finger head that dies down quickly to a thin lacing. Stickiness is very spotty, here and there. Very mild sweet citrus hop odor with a wonderful caramel/toffee malt blend. One of the best smelling beers in general I've experienced, by far the best smelling Pale Ale. Such a unique yet pleasing beer to put your nose up to. Taste is amazing as well. Once again, mild on the hops but clearly there. Citrus hops on the tongue but then the delicious vanilla malt flavor takes combined with a peppery-spice flavor. Aftertaste is very smooth and pleasant, sweet toffee like flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation. This could very possibly be a session ale at 4.6% abv. Get you hands on this if you can."
"Thanks for thinking of me my brother."
"""Two bottoms up"""
"Thanks to Hustlemuscle for sharing."
"The beer does not look like I expected. it is light reddish gold with almost no head. I've never seen a pale pale ale really, but here it is. The smell is dominated by hops. Rose hips, pine resin, and green tea, with a sweet note underlying it all. The taste is refreshing and, again, floral. The hops dominate but not too hoppy. The aftertaste is completely dominated by hops. The beer is refreshing but a bit astringent. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, despite its appearance. The carbonation adds to the crisp taste to make this a very refreshing brew indeed. The drinkability is good. The alcohol content puts this one into the realm of session beer and the crispness reminds me of a dry cider. This is a good beer and a good primer on what aroma hops are. I need to find a beer newby to use this as a lesson."
"Thanks to IntriqKen for this one. Pours a clear golden with a smallish head and decent lacing. Aroma is sweet breads and citrus hops - very nice. Taste is tasty sweet malts up front followed by pleasant citrus and a good hop finish to cleanse the palate. Perfect mouthfeel and drinkability. Excellent APA, very refreshing."
"I'm going to try to make a batch of home brew like this, I hope it's as good???"
"This beer pours a deep golden color, has a decent head, and nice lacing. The aroma is a wonderful bouquet of citrusy hops. The flavor is citrusy as well, and is remarkably pleasant. This is a great example of the American Pale Ale style. There is a little bit of crystal malt flavor that completes this ale. If you like APA style, this is worth going out of your way for. Great beer overall."
"Striking golden color, with a decent head that fizzes out pretty fast. The smell is rich, yet hoppy and crisp. Flavor is simple enough, but as with all Firestone beers incredibly executed. Light sweet malt strikes immediately, followed by a brilliant splash of hops that lingers seductively on the palate. I feel the oakiness in their beers more than taste, and it feels damn good. Drinkability is superb."
"Great drinkability, it's gone before you know it. After the disappointment of the Double Barrel, this is an improvement."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Crisp flavors, finishes smooth with the right amount of bitterness. A very quenching and refreshing beer."
"Drinkability: I think the crisp flavors in the bottled version make this beer more drinkable than the sweet malty draft offering."
"Citrus hop notes coupled with resiny pine flavors. Fruit notes are a bit more pronounced then the pine flavors. Toasted grains and biscuit flavors round out the malt profiles. Light with a slight slickness in the finish. Just an all around easy drinking pale ale. Good example of the style. Perfect for a session brew with an abv lower then 5."
"Drinkability: What a nice APA; superbly balanced and a low abv, to boot"
"A little too much chalkiness on the finish but good body and carbonation otherwise. Not earth-shattering but I rather liked this beer. Exceptional drinkability and not something to overpower food or short-circuit your palate. A really well-made mild ale in my estimation."
"D- enjoyable, dont know about sessionable, paired well with my whole grain portzels, balance is awesome, memorable pale if not one of my faves"
"Smell and taste set this APA apart from others. I crave a hop flower aroma in my pales and this beer delivers big time. I've had 2IPA's with less hop aroma. The taste is very crisp - delivering hop bitterness with a slightly nutty finish. Highly drinkable - definitely Firestone's best widely available offering."
"D - Good drinkability. Smooth pale ale that would be easy to session."
"D: Easily drinkable, nothing bad about this one. A sessionable light-tasting, smooth pale ale. Worthy of a try..."
"Not remotely an extreme or over-the-top beer - the kind of nicely made craft beer that you could spend an afternoon with, especially if you like that hop crispness. My favorite Firestone Walker beer."
"Oh, and P.S. - Jim Cibak, we miss you over here in 3F's land!"
"D- It is a average pale ale. I like the more on the hoppy side but it is not bad. Really don't think I would buy it again. There are a lot better beers for same price out there."
"Bottle courtesy Harry! Thank you! Pale yellow pour with medium white froth fading to a thin white ring. Good malted base aroma with mild pine hops and a boost of sugars. Decent hoppy flavour profile with sugared malt sweetness to balance. Slightly thin and watery finish. But would be very good for sessions. Glad I got to try it. Thanks Harry!"
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, the only drawback I can see with this beer would be that you might look for something with a little bit more of a kick to it. Overall, it’s an excellent representation of style while at the same time keeping the beer lighter than most APA’s."
"Poured this beer into a tasting glass. The head is a nice creamy white lacing, with beautiful tiny bubbles and amber color. The nose is hoppy with subtle citrus notes. The taste is clean, crisp, and hoppy. I really love this style of beer. The drinkabililty of this is off the charts. In college, UCSB, I have many a fuzzy night due to the drinkabililty of this beer. Great beer."
"Oily mouthfeel, but very clean and crisp. Low ABV and excellent balance make this a very drinkable APA that I could easily session. Not a particularly special brew, but nonetheless a solid offering I wouldn't turn down."
"Nice balance with this pale ale and solid hop aroma, but the thing that gets me about this beer is the 4.6% alcohol. For some reason, I actually expected this beer to be at least 5%, but still easy to drink. Not quite a session beer, but close! Nice straw color without that much of a head. Great one to try out, much like another Firestone beer I have enjoyed a year back."
"The taste is great - refreshing, hoppy, and just slightly sweet. You need to like hops to enjoy this, but I'll take this and it's relatively low ABV (4.6%) any day over swill at the local 5 and dime."
"Notes: This is another solid offering from Firestone. Its kind of funny in that their flagship beer the double barrell is the only one I found to be not to my liking. This pale ale is a great beer to pair with Bbq, or even some italian dishes fit nicely. Refreshing and with some depth of character."
"For the style, this beer is great. Highly enjoyable and very drinkable."
"Very good."
"Crisp, clean and refreshing, with nice citrus and herbal notes. Grapefruit flavors are nicely backed up by some mildly sweet malts. Low alcohol presence makes this one a nice candidate for a session beer."
"This may be the ultimate in session beers. Probably one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had."
"Drinkability. Everyone should put this on there want list right now!!! It's that drinkable."
"I will pick up another six pack of this soon and drink it in the shade overlooking the pool."
"Easy too drink and quite enjoyable...better than I was expecting."
"D - Very drinkable, good for a hot summer day. This is my first Firestone brew, will buy other's if the liquor store carries them."
"Overall, probably my favorite pale ale. I'm not too fond of pale ales (or strongly hop-oriented beers in general), but this has a nicely balanced flavor and doesn't overpower. Probably not the best choice for hop-lovers, but everyone else -- take note. I'll have another, please..."
"The West is blessed with many fine American Pale Ale's, and Firestone has got to be one of them. It looks like your classic Pale Ale, with an light orange crystal clear appearance and a smell of fresh pine. Firestone Pale Ale gives you a dose of that West Coast feel primarily with its Cascade hops. It is crisp, has a nice carbonated bite to it, and is refreshing."
"Thanks Len!"
"D: I can drink a few of these at a sitting. Just a relaxing, easy beer that doesn't make my head spin."
"This beer looks nice. Pours a perfectly transparent amber color with a one finger head and a nice amount of lacing for an APA. Smell is nice. Lots of hops on the nose. More than normal for the style. Also a small amount of sweetness there too. Reminds me of a toned down IPA. Taste is also very nice. Hoppy up front, leading the way to a roasted malt flavor. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel and drinkability are also very good. For a low ABV beer, Firestone has done a nice job here."
"Nice, somewhat darker gold color. Im suprised as to how clear it is. Decent hop aroma-very, very fresh citrus. Whoa!!! Great hop flavor. Not a trace of bitterness just straight ahead hop flavor. Malty backbone is balanced very well. Some lingering sweetness. Excellent body for the style and the low abv. Very, very drinkable. With the low abv this could go on all night. Damn I wish I could get this one locally. One of the BEST US pales I have had. Ever."
"Drinkability: Because of it's low ABV and subtle flavors, sessioning and drinking would be very easy Thanks to Zorro for the bottle."
"Firestone's Pale Ale was a surprise for me. I'm not a big pale ale fan to start with, plus I'd see this one EVERYWHERE, in all the liquor stores and even grocery stores! So i figured it was gonna be just another bland ol' pale...yeah, I know I know, it's a terrible way to judge...But boy was I pleasantly surprised! It had a wonderfully smooth feel but quite lively taste. Nice blend of favors. I'm not gonna rush out to buy more when there's so many other beers I prefer over it, but I wouldn't turn one down either! Their other brews have impressed me too. Hooray for Firestone!"
"Smells of florally hops. Tastes is hoppy that's not too overpowering, keeps in balance overall. For this style the hops could have been a bit stronger, however it is still tasty Some strange aftertastes linger, perhaps because of the barrelling, but maybe not. Overall a pleasent brew, worth trying."
"Received from Zorro in BCG BIF. Bottled on date of 10/11/05 is printed on the bottle. Underrated, I think."
"The beer is a gold color and only has a wispy, pale draught head. This beer has an incredible, fresh, hop aroma. I get notes of apricots, some peach, and of course some of the typical citrus notes. The aroma is just quite striking, and I really like the mix of fruit character that the hops evoke here. The taste is pretty light and refreshing and has a light sweetness to it that really helps to accentuate the fruity flavors from the hops. The hop character is definitely dominated by a fresh fruity character that is most evocative of peaches and apricots. This is really quite nice."
"Slightly cloudy, decent white head, light copper-gold in color. The aroma is rather nice, though I get mostly malt - just a trace of a fruity-piney blend, probably hops and esters, it doesn't knock me out but the maltiness is good. The flavor is great - absolutely tremendous, a delicious rich grainy maltiness with some toffee and caramel notes followed by a clean bitterness that compliments the flavor very well. This is clearly a pale ale although its balance seems tilted toward the malt a little more than normal. I think this is awesome."
" drinkability: well i got a single and i'm going slowly and I won't buy this in bottles again. It's just too watery, smell just isn't enough to sell a beer no matter how great the nose is."
"Poured a golden, apple-juice color, slightly hazy with a 1/2"" off-white head. The aroma was exceptional... I could smell it as soon as I opened the bottle, and it just got better when I poured it in my glass... aromas of pine and citrus, a wonderfully fresh and hoppy smell. The taste is relatively mellow and smooth... it may smell like a hop-bomb, but it's actually a very balanced beer... definitely a Pale Ale and not an IPA or a typically overly bitter West Coast Pale Ale (yes, a generalization, but often true in my opinion). While mellow, the taste is actually quite full and rich... it's initially mildly sweet with a grassy flavor, followed by a malty middle with hints of lemon peel. The finish lingers with a mild bitterness, earthy, woody and root-like flavors. A beer that's very drinkable, and can simply be enjoyed... but take some time to notice the subtle complexities of this well-crafted brew."
"Notes: I read this one is fermented in oak barrels, but I didn't really pick up on this characteristic in my samples. It's very subtle, but a nice touch! Likely why this IPA tastes as complex as it does. Worth trying!"
"Overall, this beer was enjoyable, but not something I would seek out again. I was pleasantly surprised by its flavor, but it was simply too thin for my tastes. Still, because of that, makes for a surprisingly good session brew @ 4.6%."
"This is a nice golden color that poured a good two finger head that has sustained quite well. Nose is of citrusy malts. Taste reminds me of an ESB as it has a stronger malt presence than anticipated at the start and finishes with a nice citrusy floral hop with the malts still present. Mouthfeel is OK, decently carbonated and heavy enough for the style. Drinkability is near perfect for a session. This makes for a great tail gate brew!"
"-UF"
"12 oz bottle pours a chill hazed, honey amber body with an offwhite head that rises about one centimeter and stays there. Good patch lacing effect. Aroma is citrusy hops, with inviting esters of orange, tangerine, and grapefruit. Malty caramel is in the background, and there is a hint of vanilla from the oak barrel fermentation. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with crisp moderate carbonation. Taste features juicy citrusy hops, with orange and grapefruit lending a soft bitterness. Caramel and toffee notes serve up a pleasant malt balance. A hint of oaky vanilla adds a nice touch. The finish is clean, with a lingering grapefruit hops bitterness that is soft and mild. Very nicely balanced, and rather tasty. ABV is under 5%, so this one would make an exceptional session ale."
"Very nice beer one that I would recommend for anyone who likes hops or someone who has just gotten into hops and does not want to be blown totally away."
"It's ok, dog."
"Drinkability is above average. I could make this a session beer. The taste is nice and it's not filling... Ok, just noticed I have already reviewed this one."
"Similar to Sierra Nevada, but better. Nice amber color with a decent head. Mouthfeel is the best quality of this beer as the taste will sit nicely on the tongue allowing you to savor the beer. The taste itself is malty with a hint of fruitiness that complements the hops real well."
"poured a deep amber color with a white foamy long-lasting head. Smell is of pine-scented hops. Has a nice dry hops taste that is thoroughly enjoyable. The dry tsate left in my mouth encouraged additional tasting. Very drinkable, but nothing outstanding"
"Firestone Pale Ale is pretty good beer that would benefit from a slightly more assertive nature. Having said that, there's nothing at all wrong with a pale ale that doesn't feel like blurring the distinction between an APA and an IPA. In the end, I like this one more than the final score would indicate and I'm certain that I'd drink a lot of it if it was brewed locally."
"Drinkability: Coming in at 4.60% ABV...I could do this all day, almost everyday!"
"I still find this drinkable and better than the Macro-brew alternatives, but will not be something worth shipping across the country for others to try."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: pretty much a standard American pale ale; felt a little on the watery side, but overall not too bad. I liked the citrus quality in the hops."
"The mouthfeel was smooth and it had a medium body. The finish was relatively short with bitterness and citrus lasting on the tongue. Nicely drinkable, but the sweetness may be a turnoff to some here."
"Sample comes from a 12oz bottle. Pours a light copper color and makes about an inch worth of fine white bubbly head. Smells well hopped, fruity, spicy. Flavor is not too bitter, slightly sweet, hops make a slight tartness come through, its pretty good. Mouthfeel is light to medium body with moderate carbonation. This is quite drinkable stuff, a nice session beer."
"I've now tried all the Firestone beers that I have seen in stores. This pale ale poured a deep gold, head retention was so so, but my glass was thick with lace rings. Sharp aroma of hop and grain, inviting. Smooth on the palate, with a solid malt base, lightly hopped. I did detect a note of sweetness like others have mentioned. It didn't bother me. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but this is a drinkable decent beer. The average ratings for Firestone beers seem to me mostly well under four. I think they're better than that."
"I can't say I'd be eager to reach for another one of these. It just seemed to wander around too much trying to figure out whether it should be hoppy or malty. In the end, Firestone Pale Ale remained indecisive and only a mediocre brew."
"Very drinkable."
"I suspect that this will be an easy and very pleasant session beer if you don't mind a bit of sweetness. I will buy more and test that theory personally."
"The beer as it pours from the bottle presents an unambiguous copper color the head modest in size and the color a beauteous light tan, it vanishes quite quickly leaving a fair sheet of lace behind. A sturdy hop aroma upfront and a candy like sweetness, fresh, crisp and pleasing to the senses this nose, start is overly sweet, the top thin to medium in feel to the palate. Finish is leniently acidic, the hops perky in their spicy bite, dry and long lasting aftertaste. A nice session beer me thinks, but does seem a bit too sweet, but nothing I can't live with."
"Notes: Label reads: ""... this distinctive pale ale boasts a bright, elegant texture with hints of toffee and a medium malt character. Fermantation in individual 60 gallon American Oak barrels imparts soft smoky nuances, a suggestion of vanilla and additional complexity to the flavor profile."" Not sure, a la Bunnyhop, that I experienced all of this, but still found Firestone PA to be a gentle, tasty session pale ale nonetheless. Would happily drink this again."
"Light gold color. Medium white foamy head. Aroma is nutty and slightly fruity. A medium bodied Pale Ale. Medium malty, hoppy ale. Crisp malt flavor, good hop balance. Some subtle fruity overtones. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is delicately bitter."
"This tasty offering pours forth a hazy deep golden color with a thin head giving way to a thinner lace. The aroma is decidedly malty with strong caramel tones and subtle hints of roast and chocolate. The initial flavor is of a quick malt pushed aside by a light floral hop spice. Toffee and mellow chocolate notes flow through and finish everything off nicely."
"12 oz bottle pours a copper-orange. Creamy white, thick head. I think it had some kind of reaction with the prior beer from the glass, because it was the thickest head I had ever seen without dropping the bottle before opening. Anyway, I let it rest and it eventually dissipated to a reasonable level but not completely. I think its a good example of the style. The hops are evident...too bitter for some, but probably not bitter enough for a hophead, because there is a definite malt character. If its side by side with SNPA, I'll take the Firestone every time."
"This beer pours a clear slight reddishh golden color with a rocky off-white head. The mouthfeel is moderate. The smell is sweet citrus and floral. The taste is bitter floral and citrus with sweetish malts. A tasty bitter pale ale with slight malty hints."
"(source: Beers Across America)"
"Hops: Fuggles, Cascade, Centennial, and Chinook"
"A nice beer,  I like the Hops and Bitterness, but it may be a bit one-dimensional for some ""non-hopheads""."
"The beer pours with a nice golden copper color and almost no head.  Not much aroma to wet your appetite, and has what I think is a hint of vanilla, I may well be wrong on that.  Good mouthfeel and IMO could use a little more hops and also alcohol kick.  But overall a good refreshing beer that goes down well...............CHEERS"
