Outstanding aroma, heavy with grapefruit and pine.  Very promising. Mouthfeel and taste slightly underwhelmed.  Probably just because the aroma was so good.

Really enjoyed the drinkablity of it. If I lived in their distribution I would certainly have this in my rotation. I thought maybe there was a touch of Citra in here given I think it smells a bit like Zombie Dust but all info online seems to say it's Warrior, Centennial, Simcoe, Amarillo, and Columbus. Maybe the combo of Centennial and Amarillo and Simcoe is giving me that Juicy Friut hop aroma. Guess I'm not getting any better at the identifying hop thing.","PaulyB83","Dec 28, 2014"

Smell is on the light side, and comes across with hop resin and citrus. Light taste with an amazing balance of hop bitterness, grapefruit rind and light malt. Really well balanced !!!!. Feels great going down with just the right amount of carbonation; refreshing!!. Light hop bitterness aftertatste. Nice job on this one.

Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Bitterness is too prevalent for my preference.

Flavor follows with lots of grassiness and hay, dry, very light malt sweetness, maybe a bit of citrus. Very light bodied, goes down super easy with a dry finish and lots of carbonation. Good stuff.

In the taste, more citrusy tropical notes, solid bitterness and floral touches. Daisy Cutter is an apt name for this bomb of hop flowers. Bitter and resinous, with a dry hop bite and biscuity malt profile. Medium, smoother body with a medium high carbonation. Overall, this is a classic pale ale, better than most IpAs.","Stinkypuss","Jun 10, 2014"

This beer is just fantastic, it's everything I had hoped it would be. Crisp, clean, refreshing, with a touch of fruit notes at the end.

This offering has some fizziness that becomes noticeable as one begins sipping on it. The body is light and the flavor is crisp with a pleasing hop finish. This is a bit lighter in body than the best APAs, but it would certainly be something perfect to knock back in mass quantities on a hot summer day.","57md","Nov 08, 2013"

A whole four pack to be exact it pours a perfect copper slightly hazed glowing orange hue with a bright white head. Aroma has floral citrus hop notes with ample malt fresh sliced bread. As it warms up more orange slices with a bit of crush aspirin and orange zest makes it's way into my nares, a good combo with the ample tame sweetness of the balancing malt character. Flavor wise it hits the palate with enough hops to keep this hop head interested, great citrus zest bitterness floral notes with a sweet honey biscuit malt to bring it home into a balance. Hops shine through to the finish, nice bone dry finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied ample smooth natural carbonation, cans are the way to go for these guys. Overall drinkability is great sessionable crazy good stuff, I can't wait to get more. I shared one can drank two on arrival and saved one for a review it went so fast!!!","WVbeergeek","Oct 24, 2013"

4.1,-1.7,4,4,4,4.5,4.25,"procured at a trader joes north of downtown Chicago near the botanic gardens in a four pack of pint cans. this is a wonderful beer, maybe the best ive had from Chicago. it has a rather large hop nose, English in some ways, more bitter than dank or fruity. there is also a soft floral element, that comes across like the flowers on the can are actually in the can, polleny and springtimey and gloriously grassy. good malt balance, English and American mixed, lighter than it seems, with a fresh cut hay and rising bread complexion. the flavor is the best parts of the nose, more hoppy than I first though, super different from the standard, and expertly made. the quality of this beer is most apparent in the feel though, which is creamy without being heavy, bubbly without being aggressive, and clean without being immaculate. its really fantastic beer, and an exceptional introduction to half acre beer. the floral finish and the bright hops and diverse malt unification make this a beer I wish I could get in upstate new York, where I am spending this summer, or in Denver where I live. this would be an everyday brew for me.","StonedTrippin","Jul 08, 2013"

A lot of floral flavors on the front turn to some semi-sweet malts, and then there's a fair amount of bitterness in the pretty dry finish that I just really enjoy. It's hard to stop sipping this beer, as it's truly outstanding. Worthy of the hype. Glad to have tried this, and looking forward to future beers from Half Acre.","Alextricity","Jul 07, 2013"

On detects a good hop profile in the aroma with notes of grass and citrus fruit. The aroma allows the drinker to know immediately that this is a pale ale. On the initial taste, the smoothness of this beer strikes me the most. The carbonation is less than abrasive, allowing the smoothness to shine. In the initial taste one detects lemon, grass, orange rind, and a hint of biscuit. As the taste hades to the back of the throat, the lemon is most apparent with the other notes fading to the sides. It is a hot day, and I do find this to be an easy drinker. The taste itself does not strike me as being particularly complex. In the big picture, this is a subtle and smooth pale ale.","JohnnyHopps","May 31, 2013"

How a pale ale should look. Smells of tons of floral notes, some resinous, dank qualities, grapefruit, a soapy quality to it, some juicy fruits like pineapple. Do get some bread and grain as well from the malt. Taste starts with some resinous, yet juicy qualities from the hops such as grapefruit, just tons of floral, almost a perfume-like flavor. Then the middle brings some balance with wheat notes, grain, and carmel. Get some qualities here that may suggest some to say it is ""watered down," but I disagree. The finish is more of the prominent floral qualities of the hops, as well as some pine, grass, pineapple, grapefruit, carmel. Crisp, light body with a creamy and thin mouthfeel. This is not on the Alpha King or Zombiedust level for apa’s, but it is definitely a quality, hoppy pale ale that I would gladly have anytime I can get my hands on some.","brewskis","Feb 17, 2013"

A beautiful beer. The aroma is a bright splash of hops. It’s a mix of floral and citric notes, grapefruits, clementines and honeysuckle. There’s very little malt presence. From the color, I assume that a decent amount of crystal malt found its way into the beer, but it barely shows in the aroma. A hint of caramel is all I’m really getting. There might be a touch of butterscotch but it’s definitely not problematic. It tastes dry and hoppy. There’s little bitterness but good citric, grassy hop flavor. A little bit of wateriness creeps in, but at a mere 5.2% abv, it’s forgivable. The finish has a touch of caramel, a lot of grassy/earthy hop flavor and medium bitterness for the style. The mouthfeel is suprisingly smooth. It’s easy to drink and easy to like. This would be a good beer to drink in quantity particularly because it provides hoppiness without wearing out the palate overmuch.","popery","Jan 27, 2013"

Daisy Cutter makes excellent drinking at any time of the year. Its massive amount of hop flavor will certainly attract the hop heads, but its mild strength, price-point, and accessibility will also win plenty of beer drinkers over who aren't necessarily big fans of IPA or more aggressively hoppy beer. Check it out if you're in Chicago. She's a beaut.","hagbergl","Dec 18, 2012"

The beer smells like fresh floral hops with some booze and malt on the nose. The taste of the beer is pretty hoppy from start to finish. The flavors upfront are mostly sweet malt that quickly fades into the earthy and floral bitterness of the hops. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a delicate carbonation to it. Overall this is a very nice beer, I would drink a lot of this one if I could. It gives off the essence of flowers and I find that to be pretty impressive. It's very good.","Knapp85","Nov 10, 2012"

Even though it was quite hoppy, it was drinkable and refreshing out on the golf course.

4.42,6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Beer pours a clear light-orange with a medium white head. The smell is really quite nice - the citrus hop burst is fantastic and there's some bready malt in there as well. The flavor on this is also quite impressive - much better than I remember it being on tap. It reminds me somewhat of a baby Heady Topper with a similar hop and malt profile, but not nearly as big of a flavor. It's very similar to the smell with a big citrus hop hitting you first followed by a nice bready malt character and then a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, I really enjoy this beer a lot. I feel like a lot of people talk about Daisy Cutter being overrated, but perhaps that's gone so far to the point where it's now underrated. I would certainly have another.","starrdogg","Jul 12, 2012"

Head eventually settles into a 1/8th skim with delicate, textured clusters of lacing present during the tasting. Nose expresses citrus rind and pleasant floral notes. Taste consistent with nose - citrus pops a bit more than the floral character - there's also a bit of a biscuity quality that cuts through the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body with an even carbonation and a bit of acidity that just tickles the palate. Overall, a very drinkable and quite enjoyable APA.

Tight carbonation makes for a dry finish. I get lemon peel, grapefruit, orange rind (bigtime). Finish is super dry. If anything, it lacks a sweet malt balance, this is a pretty hop forward APA.

3.9,-6.5,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Half Ace Daisy Cutter pours a fairly hazy orange, with just a dusting of tangerine along the edges when the beer is backlit. There are about three fingers of white foam sitting atop the beer, and after the first third fades away it just floats there; head retention is outstanding. Lacing is solid at the beer's apex, but very spotty underneath. The nose has lots of ripe grapefruit, with a little bit of mango present. It's not too potent/aromatic though. The flavor has a little bit of bready malts up front, along with a nice, mild, pale ale appropriate bitterness. The hoppy finish just screams Centennial hops, which aren't one of my favorites. It's a bitter grapefruit flavor, not entirely pleasant, and there's a little bit of grassiness as well. The body is nice and light, with just a little bit of firmness to it. The carbonation is a little bubbly, though if I was being picky I would say it could stand to be a little more so. Daisy Cutter's a solid pale ale but given that it's not distributed anywhere near me, I wouldn't go out of my way to get some more.","axeman9182","May 03, 2012"

I just can't get over the fact that this is an APA. Feel is medium, with excellent carbonation, bitterness, and a nice dry finish. The malt sees action in the feel too, but in the background.

Taste is more biscuity, pale malt, and some clean, non-bitter orange flavor, with very little bitterness on the finish. Medium-light carbonation and body, pretty smooth.

The beer pours yellowish copper with thin white head that is lacing slightly. The smell includes grapfruit and clove with waffes of pine. The taste is bitter...slight floral notes to start followed by a grapfruity bitterness. The mouthfeel was good...lighter in body....minumal carbonation.

Flavors are spot on. Grapefruit up front, good, clean, piney, bitterness, but not overly bitter. There is a bit of balance from the malt, but really this one is a great hoppy beer.

4.23,1.4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Received this as an extra in a trade from an awesome BA in Illinois. I've already had the Galactic Double Daisy Cutter, so I was curious to see how this one would fare. Daisy Cutter pours a translucent straw hue with a very thin crown. While there's little head to speak of, the beer does leave behind some thin lacing as it recedes. The nose is really muted. There really isn't anything of note that reaches out and punches you in the face, unlike the Galactic variety. The taste, however, is marvelous. This is a really smooth, mellow, mildly hopped beer that you could session the daylights out of. This would definitely be one of my go to beers if I lived anywhere near Half Acre. Overall, this is a marvelous beer. Great tasting, doesn't scorch the taste buds, smooth, and next no zero bitterness on the back end of a sip. Would recommend this to anyone that hasn't had the opportunity to enjoy a Half Acre beer.","Retail1LO","Sep 01, 2011"

I am going to miss this greatly back in NYC where I cannot find a sessionable brew that meets my hops/intensity minimums. I never find myself thinking, ""this is alright, but man I need a real 6.5+ % APV IPA"" This beer is PROOF that a low alcohol beer CAN satisfy a strong IPA loving hophead! Bravo, Half Acre!

4.12,-1.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I was really happy to get to try this! Unexpectedly aromatic and strong flavored for a pale ale. Definitely a sort of burnt-grain and flower petal (daisys actually came to mind, perhaps the power of suggestion) smell in the nose that came off as something earthy and savory with a tad of floral like sweetness. The flavor was much the same, but a lot of concentration on a strong wheatiness with the nose playing a supporting role. Overall this was very potent and very interesting for a pale ale, and made me excited for the prospect of double. Also, big props for making such a good out-of-a-can beer!","Klym","Jul 11, 2011"

3.52,-15.6,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The mouthfeel is satisfyingly medium-bodied. The extra-sweet malt in this beer doesn’t translate to a thick mouthfeel; Half Acre has wisely brewed this beer in such a way that it focuses on balance and refreshment.

Nice mouthfeel, light and carbonated. After being told by numerous people that I ""had to pick this up"" while in Chicago, I just can't see what all the hype was about.

Thick clumps of lacing cover the glass and persist as a cap throughout the beer. Aroma is heavy on pale and bready malts with strong lemon citrus hops in the finish. Bready and biscuit dominate the body before a subtle lemon zest and rind hop flavor blends into the finish. This is quickly subsumed by a dry malt and grain takes over and lingers throughout the remainder. Creamy bodied with soft carbonation. Bottle or can I've never understood the love for this beer. Pleasant and slightly above average but a lot of locals do this just as well and this isn't remotely close to Edward or Hoppy Birthday.","yourefragile","May 15, 2011"

The aroma is of citrusy hops and biscuity malt. Smells great! The taste showcases the hop bill with notes of orange and grapefruit predominating. A pale malt backbone provides the perfect backdrop to the bitter hop forward character of this APA. The feel is light and crisp with a prickly level of carbonation which is perfect for the style.

The hop presence hits you first in the nose. You get a ton of citrus and resin character coming right at you, not much in the way of malts at all. In the taste it reminded me of an IPA so I think if you are looking for a balanced brew this isn’t for you but if you are looking for a hop bomb I highly recommend it. It had a good amount of carbonation so was light and crisp in the mouth. To me this would be a great summer BBQ brew if it was local and available that is","joepais","Apr 15, 2011"

On the nose there is a huge grapefruit note with bits of pine resin underneath it. I'm not getting much in the way of malt backbone except for a little bit of bread. In the mouth the grapefruit and resin are puckeringly and pleasantly bitter, with some dry bread coming in underneath. The body is medium and the finish is pretty long with the pine and citric bitterness sticking around for a while. This is highly drinkable, one of my new favorite beers to bring to parties, and it gets a little extra credit for coming in an awesome form factor, the pint can.

4.05,-2.9,4.5,4.5,4,3,4,"Mouthfeel/Overall: The body is very light, and it has pretty high carbonation. Not the smoothest drinking by any stretch, and I also think the lightness retracts from the taste a bit as well. It drops off the palate pretty quickly. This is the biggest detractor for this beer in my opinion. Overall though, this is a great beer, one of the best of the style I've had.

Taking a drink of this beer I could definitely taste the pine hops and some other floral ingredients and boy did they taste good.

Taste is consistent with the smell, but the smokiness doesn't make an appearance until the aftertaste, creating a very cool effect.

The nose comprises heavy hoppy notes, running the gamut from pine to ruby red grapefruit to even the onions that made Gubna a hardship for some. A slightly syrupy caramel undertow flows beneath the hoppy ice above. The taste is fairly hoppy on its own, but not nearly as much as the smell. Behind this veil o' hops recline some light toffee, light sweet caramel, cotton candy, and some slight florals. The body is fairly light, though bordering on the light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a finish tending toward the dry.

The aroma is hops...possibly Cascade...I don't know if I can say anything else because in all honesty it all that I really smell. The hops do however provide a delicious floral and citrus aroma that is unmistakable. The taste is surprisingly not nearly as bitter as I had anticipated, but there is a bitterness in the aftertaste. Instead there is a quite obvious earthy mineral taste to the beer which can be tasted even more so than the malts. The citrus flavors of the hops are palpable as well. I must be honest, for something that sounded so powerfully destructive as this it's quite light and pleasant on the palate. There is an overall herbal tea style taste to it which is interesting to say the least. There is a lot of carbonation which i suppose enhances the flavor of the hops as well as the aroma. A quite enjoyable pale ale, this is from someone who really doesn't like the flavor of hops. I must say props to the local stuff.","Vdubb86","Sep 08, 2010"

4.43,6.2,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Thanks to bauermj for this awesome extra! 16oz can into a Hopus tulip pours a hazy pale orange with a nice frothy off white head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and a few rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma is some citrus hops and sweet malts. The taste is a very nice balance of sweet malts just slightly overpowering the citrus hop backbone, very nice balance. The beer is very light, smooth and quite refreshing with perfect carbonation. This is an absolutely incredible pale ale, dare I say the best I've ever had. If this were available here in NC, it would be a mainstay in my beer fridge for sure!","atsprings","Aug 19, 2010"
4.35,4.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Can and Tap. Have heard and read good things about this brew and am looking forward to trying it. Bought a 4 pack of it in Chicago only to find it on tap at the hotel I was staying at, total score! Poured a slightly cloudy golden orange/yellow color with a tight little 1 finger head. The aroma that I get is mostly of citrus hops and rind. The taste can easily be described as smooth and balanced with a nice hops presence up front that transitions to the malt backbone. This to me is one of the best Pale Ales I have had in a long time.","kbutler1","Aug 19, 2010"
4.33,3.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Goldenish pour with small head, good retention and great lacing. Excellent nose of citrusy and floral hop character, not super pungent but enough to keep me interested. Good hop flavor, malts in the background to a medium bitterness with a crisp and dry finish. Hoppy for a typical pale ale perhaps, but not too overly hopped such that it's not approachable or too much to pair with everyday food. Supremely drinkable and a great pale ale. Love the pint cans- I would buy this buy the case if I could get it locally.","Ineedabeerhere","Aug 18, 2010"

Smell is very nice: a balanced blend of citrus, pine, and floral hop aromas (with just a little emphasis on grapefruit citrus). At the front end of each sip is a bold hop bitterness, followed by just enough of a little biscuity malt for balance. The finish is crisp and bitter, and leaves a trace of floral flavor behind to invite a second sip. Body is light and thin-- surprising for such a flavorful APA. Daisy Cutter strikes a great balance of flavor and drinkability. I'll be keeping these around for many a summer BBQ.","KBomb","Jul 15, 2010"

The taste is just as amazing. Very strong hop presence with very little malt characteristics. Absolutely breathtaking. Clean and crisp with lovely citrus fruits on the back of the tongue. Lemon, orange, grapefruit, and a tiny bit of melon. This is the most complex and flavorful pale ale I've ever had. Better than a handful of IPAs I've had (and I've had many.) Absolutely amazing beer.

Good! Mouthfeel was medium with a pronounced citrus hops bite. Goddam! The finish was puckeringly dry, like I had just bitten into a grapefruit at breakfast. Man, this was pretty intense for being called an ""AmeriCAN Pale Ale"".

Malt is not typical - not much in the caramelly flavors, way more towards the dry, biscuity malt flavors which serves this beer really well. I would highly recommend this beer...I could drink this all day without any complaints.

Nice and hoppy, bitter, orange and grapefruit come out again, semi-sweet pale malts, dry grassy finish. Medium body. This is a fantastic hopped up pale ale with low ABV that keeps it's incredibly drinkable for the bitterness. Yum. I will be drinking several of these over the weekend!","KeefD","Feb 04, 2010"

4.42,6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It's a very good tasting easy drinking beer that I would gladly have again. it's nice to have something so flavorful and only 5% abv for a change. I could easily have a few of these.","billab914","Jan 30, 2010"
4,-4.1,4,4,4,4,4,"On a side note, I wish Half Acre dated their bottles. The first bottle of Daisy Cutter I tried had an awful stale cardboard taste. The only reason I purchased another was because of the great reviews it received here.","sidetracked","Jan 29, 2010"
4.18,0.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice caramel-amber with a very nice head and plenty of lacing as it goes down. The smell is loads of citrus with plenty of orange and grapefruit. Some pine in there as well. Great bitterness to this one, and just absolutely outstanding flavor for an American Pale Ale--next to Columbus Pale from Town Hall, probably the best that I've ever had. Medium body and good carbonation with absolutely outstanding drinkability. Man, I miss Chicago.","Thorpe429","Jan 27, 2010"
3.77,-9.6,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Conclusion: This APA is very pleasant on the nose, but is slightly less exciting on the palate. It represents the style well with the exception of an overly dry grip on the tongue and a dry finish.","PrinceDarren","Jan 23, 2010"

4.42,6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Conclusion: Awesome! When it comes to beers brimming with hops, usually I'm into DIPAs (Pliny, Hopslam, and Double Crooked Tree are my favs), but this is packed with hop flavor, yet remains drinkable enough to have a few in a setting. What a great beer! I'll have to search out more from this brewery. This is right up there with Southern Tier's Hop Sun.","BedetheVenerable","Jan 12, 2010"
4.42,6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: I'm sure the on-tap version of Daisy Cutter is even better than from the bottle. Drinkable to the point that I'm actually stopping by the brewery after work tomorrow to pick up more of it.","DoppleJock","Jan 11, 2010"
4.57,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"D: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer that is worth drinking for an entire evening.","TheManiacalOne","Jan 10, 2010"

3.62,-13.2,3.5,4,3,3.5,4.5,"Pretty decent looking beer. Vibrant golden color and a inch or so of frothy head with OK retention. Citrus and floral hops hit the nose with very faint malt presence. Strangely the taste doesn't exactly follow the smell - the hops are more herbal and earthy and very little in the way of malt character. I can still pick out some grapefruit but not to the degree I found it in the nose. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side but I don't mind that at all. Drinkability is a strong point as it is 5.2% abv and not at all heave-bodied. This would be a good summer beer and pair well with seafood. Glad I tried this but probably won't be back until summer and I've worn myself out on wheat beers and lighter lagers.","b3barron","Jan 09, 2010"
4.88,17,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Overall I do not how this really could have been improved on. It was just amazing. Straight forward hop bomb in a 5 percent package, just wow.

He went to the beer store and asked the guy for some advice, he recommended this and said that it was one of the best APA's around. I must say that he is absolutley correct. This is a great tasting APA and I am very upset that I can't get this where I live. A very easy drinking beer that I could see myself having in all sorts of places. Thanks Brian!","cbros","Dec 31, 2009"

4,-4.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Yu- ummm. GOOD BEER!! Solid beer. Straightforward pale ale. Poured with a nice white head and lots of lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is malty, a bit earthy, rotting hay, hoppy, and enticing. Flavors the same but lots more. A tiny bit of citrus which, for me, is passable. Very good body and carbonation. Finish is pleasant and super easy to have another swig. Session beer for sure. Job well done.","drpimento","Dec 23, 2009"
4.63,11,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is my favorite pale ale. With Alpha King and this, Chicago has surprisingly emerged as a real destination for this style. Goose Island need not try when there are such options. Now this needs to get into sixers, fast, so that this beer can be enjoyed more widely. I will finish the growler by the end of the night and not be the slightest bit bored. Tremendous beer, and one of my favorites. Top 100 worthy in my mind.","ommegoose","Dec 13, 2009"

4.74,13.7,4,5,5,4,4.5,"The first sip reveals that Half Acre is taking this style as far as it can go before people just start calling your beer an IPA. If you find IPAs too hoppy, this beer will not provide you shelter. Vigorous and complex hop notes dominate. The grass and pine launch the opening salvo on your taste buds, followed by grapefruit and raw hop bitterness. Just when you think that the beer might fall into an inappropriately bitter finish, a light lemon tang, coupled with some biscuity malt notes, restores order and balance. With that slight detour, Daisy Cutter actually manages a refreshing finish. Truly a world-class APA.","chicagobeerriot","Nov 22, 2009"

Nice hops aromas, just the way I like American Pale Ales, some light citrus (more orange than grapefruit) with a light malt sweetness. The taste was light and citrusy, not in-your-face with flavors but an easy drinking hoppy quencher. I'll look for it in bottles next time I'm in Chicago.","TurdFurgison","Jul 05, 2009"

I really wish I could have gotten more detailed with the review, but all I can taste are freshly picked, barely ripe green hop petals with a tangy lemon finish. Pretty damned near perfect. The regional influence is definitely there, as this could easily be the single IPA that Three Floyds never got around to brewing (think Gumballhead with extra IBUs, minus the wheat). Yea, I'm going to be that annoying homer who gives his local beer an A+ after trying it only once. Shoot me.","keithricker","Jun 08, 2009"
