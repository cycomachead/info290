Feel is medium-light, very creamy for how light it is with a touch of breadiness. Higher than average carbonation is what you would expect/want for this style.","JG-90","Oct 04, 2014"

Bites at the end but pleasurable. M - Thick but goes down fast. O - 3 hops instead of 2 with the farmers tan, yet a touch more subtle. Makes up for it with a dry end, it surprised me how good it tasted.","NathanBunn20","Jun 29, 2014"

3.34,-5.4,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Overall I thought this was decent beer and it's fairly close to being an average American Pale Ale, it had some nice balance to it, but I didn't think that the malts and the hops clashed a little and I don't think they blended together as well as they could have. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, crisp and clean, but the taste didn't do the greatest job at holding my attention so I think a one or two would be enough for me since it doesn't really keep me coming back for more. What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and balance, I thought they were both pretty nice and worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the drinkability, it just didn't keep me coming back for more. I might recommend this beer to someone who likes Pale Ales that aren't that bitter, but I don't think that it will really stand out in the style for most people. I don't think I would go out of my way to buy this again, but I might order it at a bar if I saw it on draft. All in all I did't think this beer was that great, but it wasn't that bad either, it was kind of right in the middle and it didn't really have anything about it that made it stand out. Better luck next time Southern Tier, this beer just wasn't that memorable.","StoutHunter","Nov 01, 2013"

Malt is bread and plenty of caramel. Taste is clean and smooth. Malt is cereal, bread, dough & caramel. Hops are light but stay with the nose. Slightly sticky mouthfeel and a lingering sweetness. Semi dry, creamy and very easy to drink. I thought this was a pleasant and easy to drink ale and while it wasn’t really extraordinary, you could drink a few of these.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Aroma is pale malts, caramel, bread, citrus and maybe a hint of pine. Flavor is bread and caramel malts, pine, grass, and a little bit of yeast. Mouthfeel is light-to-medium, a little watery, and a bitter finish. Easy drinking beer, not very complicated.","mtstatebeer","Mar 28, 2013"

Bright yellowish gold color with a touch of zinc or rust to deepen it, crystal clear with only a few random bubbles visible, looks kinda adjuncty. The nose is grainy with a strong pepper component, also offers pizza crusts, cornmeal and some orange to lemon citrus to sweeten it up, same for the vague apricot, peach fruit accents, becomes leafier and greener as it warms. Medium-bodied, has some prickle to it and seemingly intentional bitter bite, on the hoppy side for an APA. Then it has the resinous feel without the pine flavor. More of the pepper, rye to pumpernickel bread, mineral water and with larger presence of savory garden herbs than flowers. The tartness suggests a space reserved for grapefruit citrus and more tropical like pineapple, nectarine, papaya fruit but the chair left empty. Its overall dryness tends to distract, not that it lacks flow but you start getting bitter beer face.","farrago","Mar 18, 2013"

It’s very different than any other APA that I’ve had, and unfortunately not in a great way. It’s not a bad beer by any stretch, but something about the aroma and flavor just seems “off,” and I can’t really put my finger on what it is.

Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, pine, pineapple, bread, grass, herbal, and floral. Pretty nice aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of pineapple, grapefruit, orange zest, floral, grass, pine, bread, and herbal. Light crisp bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, grass, pine, herbal, floral, and bread on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of flavors, with a good hop/malt balance; a bit watery but still tasty; no cloying flavors at all on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very crisp and clean mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale ale.

The body though clear straw yellow was at least darker than the BMCs. Smell seemed like it was going to be good - with IPA strength hops and grapefruit accents. But the taste, that's where it fell down. I found this completely unmatching of the smell, rather watery, and it has a strange bitterness to it which I wouldn't liken to any tasty hop I've had. This is "Extraordinary Ale"? Really? I genuinely like or love many of the bold flavor bomb beers Southern Tier puts out. But I just don't get this ale folks.

Biscuit dominates with a grainy, very mild toffee character. I like the hops used here...little bit of tropical, lot of citrus and a smattering of resin. Freshness seems to be paramount to this one, as I already notice a difference in the 3 weeks it has been since I last cracked one of these. Pretty tasty stuff overall, I could see myself getting a sixer of this at least once a year or so.","twiggamortis420","Oct 08, 2011"

On the bright side, at least it's not offensive at all. It's basically seltzer water that someone dropped a slice of toast in. So far Southern Tier is 0 for 2 on their 'regular ABV' lineup.

As for the taste, its got a candy sweetness, much lighter malts than many PAs you'll see. Not even getting any caramel out of this. Touch of flowery/piney hops, some toasted breadiness.

The smell was rather malty, and earthy, I was expecting and hoping for something hoppeir. The taste was very malty, but the hops arent noticable, ruins anything sweet from the malts, theres almost a harshness. The taste does stay on the paletee and thats almost unforntante, its harsh, a random bittners comes, but you dont get to enjoy a floral hoppy flavor. Overall I wish I could say some better things, I didnt like this one, I would avoid.","vette2006c5r","Jul 24, 2011"
3.38,-4.2,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Smooth and creamy in the mouthfeel and a nice little carbonation kick. The taste has some notes of citrus in the way of lemon and a little hop kick that brings a crispness to that smoothness. The hop kick is a little too brief and doesn't linger very long, leaving one sort of wanting a little more strength out of it. Not much in the way of a malt presence, leading to a bland taste in the end. Truly, its not a bad brew, but the blandness of the flavors is definitely underwhelming. An "eh" kind of a beer but its drinkability is a plus and therefore still worth the try.","chodinheaven","Jul 23, 2011"

3.8,7.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: Nicely balanced, interesting, but not complicated. Nicely drinkable.

3.03,-14.2,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Finally pulled the trigger on a single o' this. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises mild caramel, musty flowers, and light pine. The taste holds notes of even milder caramel, orange peel, light grapefruit rind, and light grass. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a finish that seems to want to be dry. Overall, I was severely underwhelmed by this brew. I can't say it's necessarily bad in any real respect, but it doesn't come anywhere near something I can call "good".","TMoney2591","May 09, 2011"
3.92,11,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The name brings about flashbacks of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure though I'm sure thats just a coincidence. Pours a dead clear golden amber with virtually no head. Smells of hops still hanging on the vine and taste like it too! First sip is instant hops however there is NO lingering bitter aftertaste as with other hoppy brews. As the hops roll off there are definite notes of caramel and malts. This is perfect for the person looking to ease into the flavor of hops or is an excellent choice for a session beer. I could easily drink many of these and not get bored with the instant hop hit. Extraordinary? Maybe not... but it is refreshing and damn delicious none the less.","RashyGrillCook","May 02, 2011"
3.83,8.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall not bad at all here This was a very good little session ale that I would have no issue at all with trying out again some day. I would love to find it on cask to give it a good whirl. Definitly worth another look here.","mikesgroove","May 01, 2011"
4,13.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from the bottle a amber orange clear color with a bright white loose head. Smell is soft citrus and hints of some buscuit and sweet caramel malts. Taste is simply complex, not overpowering in hops or malt but a nice complexity to the flavor ranges with citrus and floral hops to bits of buscuit and caramel malt. Mouthfeel is smooth and light good body and carbonation. Overall very enjoyable beer, not outstanding but balanced and good.","rpardon7","Apr 17, 2011"
3.77,6.8,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"This beer poured out with a gigantic amount of head on it. It was pretty much the entire glass was foam and with the smallest amount of liquid at the bottom. It took several tries to get the entire beer into the glass. Once it settled this beer was a clear yellow color. The aroma was on the hoppy side not too much else really happening there. The taste was a little piney, the after taste had some malts kicking in but not a whole lot. The mouthfeel was ridiculously carbonated, every sip I took the beer just went crazy and foamed up in my mouth. It was kind of a pain because it was hard to get a decent mouthful.","Knapp85","Apr 16, 2011"

Slight hoppy aroma and bit of fruitiness to it. I guess I would call it strawberry. Oddly enough, I also kind of smell sharp cheddar cheese faintly. Grainy flavors with a slight fruity profile and again a weird cheesy flavor. This just seems a bit off for me. The mouthfeel is fair, kind of under carbonated in my opinion but it drinks alright.

Darker citrisy flavor in middle, heavy orange peel at end. Very light mouthfeel. For such a heavy aroma, almost feels a little empty. Would make for a light refreshing summer beer.

The smell is good, mainly citrus hops, with some floral and herbal aromas as well, some slight pale malts. The taste is on par with the smell. Some toasted pale malts. I really like the taste too. Caramel and toasted pale malts. Citrus hops dominate the rest of the flavor, it's very well balanced. The mouthfeel is very good, lighter in body and a good carbonation feel. A little complex because it feels prett clean, but as it warms a bit there is almost a buttery tone to it which makes it seem like a more hopped English Pale Ale, in my opinion.

Flavor is more malty than hoppy - a slightly dry cracker malty I suppose. light-to-medium body - almost like a pilsner (I'm getting a lot of alarming pilsner qualities here from the color, aroma, body, and now even the flavor). The saving grace is the restrained ale fruitiness that pokes its head out on alternate sips (saving grace as in it is saved from suspicion that this really IS a pilsner). The finish is mildly bitter but shares with the dry malt, and dammit here comes that pilsner again. Extraordinary? Well the clear and bright color was nice, and I guess the whole pilsner aspect I detected could be considered extraordinary, but I really don't know what to make of this. There is something missing here though. Maybe the body, finishing hops (not dry hops) and aftertaste could be tooled around with, but I bet this would get better reviews if it came freshly cask-conditioned and people were told it was from England.","dedrinker","Feb 23, 2008"

Mouthfeel/body is light but with way, way too much carbonation. It almost seems like I'm drinking zippy little bubbles and not beer. Drinkability would be better if it wasn't for the high carbonation. I think if the carbonation was cut down a bit (maybe there was something slightly wrong with this batch), I would have enjoyed it a lot more.

Hoppy in the floral and citrus burp sense not overly bitter I'm detecting moderate IBUs possibly around 35 on the hop bitterness. Mild sweetness with pale malts bringing out biscuit and cereal grains with a mineral water harshness in the finish. Texture is pretty light this is pale ale light in a good way really light body with some thinner resinous slickness, and carbonation that's dead on.

Medium carbonation, medium-light body, less-than-lively mouthfeel. "Pales" (no pun intended) in comparison to other offerings from Southern Tier.

Sweet toasted munich malt upfront, followed by floral and citrus hop flavor. Tame acidity in the aftertaste, and a hint of spicy saaz. The malt is indistinct but the hop flavor is showcased to provide a good balance. Light-medium body and even carbonation counteract a mild slickness that would otherwise compliment this style.

3.82,8.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This brew is a golden orange color with a thin white head. Its a little haze too. Its got an intense, grapefruit hop aroma. Floral, resiny, citric hops dominate the nose. Theres a little sweetness up front, and a nice, rounded maltiness throughout. This is a pretty well balanced brew, tipped just slightly on the hoppy side of things. Finishes with a solid hoppinesspine and citrus. Id like this as a session brew.","Suds","Jul 16, 2005"
3.92,11,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"12 oz bottle provided by shippos...thanks much! Pours a one-finger nearly white head over a cloudy tangerine colored liquid. Smells mildly hoppy of oranges and tangerines. Has a malt sweet below this, but I can't place the style. Taste is gently sweet with late rising hop flavor in the form of oranges, a citrusy pine, and woody character. Apricot esters rise in the middle and play with the hop flavor. Hop bitter is low and there is a biscuit malt character. Md body and mildly carbonated. Nice easy drinking APA. Well done to get the hop flavor without an overbearing hop bitter.","mentor","Jul 05, 2005"
3.66,3.7,3,4.5,3.5,4,3,"Though this beer is complex and intriguing, it doesn't leave me in the mood to have another. So this isn't an everday drinking beer, more a quality novelty.","optikon44","Jul 05, 2005"
3.5,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured out a dark lemon color with a thin head which stayed a while. Smell consisted of strong juicy, citrusy hops with little malts in the background. Taste started out with a shot of malts with the hops taking over in the middle and in the end. Very citrusy with grapefruit flavors showing the most strength. Mouthfeel was medium with some good carbonation. Overall it was decent, just nothing mind blowing.","necoadam","Jul 05, 2005"
4.18,18.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"I have to begin by remarking on the head, which was thick, with a lemon-yellow color that reminded me of Weis Markets' Lemon Chiffon ice cream from when I was a kid. There was a zesty hoppiness on the nose. The beer was a crystal-clear golden color. It had a light, pleasant mouthfeel and an overt sweetness both on the palate and at the finish to offset the hoppiness. I found it very refreshing for a muggy summer day while sitting on the second floor back balcony. A definite candidate for a session beer.","woodychandler","Jun 20, 2005"
4.57,29.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"taste is tangerine & grapefruity hops surrounded by more berry and earthy sweetnesses. tea leaves are brought to mind. light overall, super drinkable and puts the IPA to shame, especially when tasted side-to-side. carbonation tingles my mouth and the finish is mildly bitter for some variety against the summer tone. adds substance and aftertaste which quickly dissipates to encourage further sippage. about as close to an A+ for summer as you can get.","goodbyeohio","Jun 18, 2005"
4,13.3,3,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Very good balance of taste between maltiness, hops, and some fruitiness. At the same time, it is not terribly heavy which is unusual for a dark ale but makes drinkability even better. Mouthfeel is good depite this.","Noelito76","May 31, 2005"
4.12,16.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This is one of the only available craft brews around here, as I'm up at Lake Erie (Western New York side) for the summer. There's also the ever-present Sam Adams and Sierra, but I thought this seemed more appealing. Appears a bright and very clear orangy amber color, small head, really nice lacing. The first thing I thought when I smelled it was "Great Lakes Burning River", but it ended up being different, though still really good. Smell is hoppy and very citrus oriented, offering lots of orange peel flavors in the taste as well as some other citrus fruits. A nice malt backing and an awesomely sweet but subtle honey character, with a nice piney bitter finish. I'm definately going to be getting this again, it's a spot on Pale Ale that's especially great for the summer.","twelvsies","May 28, 2005"
4.22,19.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clear golden with a white one finger head that is gone pretty quickly not leaving much lace behind,evergreen pine aromas here and quite heavy at that with an underlying caramel sweetness but the pine is main attraction.If you like a well balanced pale ale then this is your thing,a dose of citric hops hits up front but the firm caramel/biscuit backbone of this beer melds extremely well with the hops just making this beer not only well balanced and flavorful but very quaffable.I really enjoyed this brew I would say its "extraordinary".","oberon","May 27, 2005"
3.7,4.8,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Taste is on the dry side, almost chalky, leafy. Fair amount of bitterness at the end, but turns a bit nondescript. Slightly lacking in body. Would be best with a meal rather than as a stand-alone.","shirfan","May 13, 2005"
4.25,20.4,4,4,4,4.5,5,"This one is much better on tap than from the bottle. Overall a great session brew - I prefer Southern Tier's IPA - It actually is my favorite.","Celt44","Apr 25, 2005"
3.67,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Interesting take on the style; not really what I look for in an American Pale. The typical hop flavor is almost overshadowed by the maltiness. Pleasant for the season, but not on that I'll go back to.","NEhophead","Apr 24, 2005"
4.54,28.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4" white head over the golden brew. Head, what there is, lasts pretty well, and lacing is average to good. Aroma is piney hop leaves. Taste starts with sweet pale malt, then carries through into an unexpectedly well-balanced hops character for the style, with a crisp pine shot at the close. Mouthfeel is excellent, and drinkability is even better. Check this one out, especially for this warm weather we got going on right now.","ppoitras","Apr 19, 2005"
3.97,12.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"12 oz bottle. Gloden, clear, thin white head. Very fresh hop aroma. Flavor is dominated by fresh hop flavor. Not overly bitter. Malt is in the background. Hoppy finish. This seems to be intentioned as a hoppy refreshing and light beer, and is very well done.","vladtheimpaler","Apr 07, 2005"
4.3,21.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The more I consume high-proof, incredibly complex imports, the more I appreciate the simplicity of a good pale ale. This one here is hoppy, smooth, and incredibly drinkable. It looks nice and smells nice as well, but the flavor is incredibly well balanced. Thank good for good APA's like this one. Had this one at Tulune's.","santoslhalper","Apr 04, 2005"
3.82,8.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Hoppy and Malty, and carmel. Dark Golden. A smoother sweeter member of the North American Grapefruit hophead series of beers. Bold fruit but lemon in finish. Medium mouthfeel. Not much head or lace. Altogether a fine refreshing start to Radekfest, and thanks to the Yankee who served it up.Had on tap a year later and enjoyed hoppiness and fruit though dring.","Sammy","Apr 03, 2005"
4.03,14.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"It is not sweet, but it is a tad thin...the carmelized malts are what stay w/ me throughout the pint. The taste is slightly bitter and the finish is quite dry. A fairly drinkable brew...real glad I had the chance to try this beer...Southern Tier keeps impressing me with their offerings.","warriorsoul","Mar 02, 2005"
4.07,15.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4," A surprisingly drinkable lighter shade of Pale Ale.","Shiredave","Mar 01, 2005"

4.1,16.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The tastes was very balanced, but elements still stood out. Since i was orginally thinking this an IPA I first noted is fruity hop character, but then noticed more of a malt background than I was expecting.. I wrote it off as a balanced IPA and gladly ordered another. Very drinkable this stuff!","Onceeven","Feb 07, 2005"

4.22,19.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"A slightly hazy, golden-orange amber body is capped by a full head of frothy bright-white foam that holds fairly well before dropping to a standard collar. Lacing is limited. Bright and citrusy Cascade hops greet you in the nose over a delicate biscuity maltiness. The body is medium; and its slightly restrained carbonation lends just a tingle to the tongue. The malt is much more prevalent in the flavor than the nose suggests, and its dryish, biscuity character works as more than just a backdrop to its hoppiness. It's full-flavored and well-balanced with maltiness up-front; hop flavors across the middle and into the finish; and a bold bitterness that cuts through the biscuity and caramel-drizzled malt to dry it out in the end. Quite a respectable American pale!!!","NeroFiddled","Jan 24, 2005"
4.22,19.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured up with a thick foamy head that lingered before fading. The color a honey amber. It has a nice hop nose. Flovor starts subtle but builds with hops that linger in the after taste. This beer is very drinkable, a good session beer. I would say that this is the best beer fromm Southern Tier but that doesn't take anything away from the others in the line. I would and have suggested this to many people.","BCMan","Jan 22, 2005"
3.88,9.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"slight bit of caramel malt in the taste followed by a balanced hop character and a thick resiny mouthfeel. more restrained in the taste. very very drinkable and sessionable.","shippos","Jan 17, 2005"
4,13.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a burnt gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nicely balanced scent that boasts of pale and carapils malts along with a heavy dose of floral hops. The taste is good also. It has a rich malty flavor that goes down smooth and slow. It finishes bitter and quite hoppy. The grain bill is complex and well balanced. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great American pale ale. It has great aroma and taste; a good drinker.","WesWes","Jan 12, 2005"
4.42,25.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pour is a woody orange sorta color with a rather weak head the leaves abruptly. Carbonation seems a bit weak but not too bad. Smell is really grapefruity, i notice the cascades right away, then there's a yeasty freshly baked bread note in there as well. The body might be a bit on the light side, but overall I'd say it's medium and works really well for the balance of flavors in this beer. Lots of complexity in hop flavors here. There's a good dose of flavoring and bitterness here. Almost borders on IPA levels but the malts come big when they come giving this beer remarkable balance. Sweet fruit mixes with the grapefruit. Estery flavors are there. I'm getting caramel and maybe macademia nuts. There's a really interesting hit of hops midway through that gives me a unique apple bitterness. The bready yeast provides something special underneath. Finish leaves me with oily hop resins, yummy! This is a seriously sessionable beer, one I can see myself going back to many times.","granger10","Jan 01, 2005"
3.42,-3.1,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Nice candied piney hop aroma smells fresh. Small, foamy yellowish cream colored head fades quickly to a film leaves some nice lace. Transparent apricot colored beer with streams of carbonation making a break for the top. Piney hop flavor up front is a bit sweet, but tasty. Mild, lightly sweet malt flavor underneath pops out towards the end, and a pinch of bitterness cuts all the sweetness at the end. Finish is pretty clean. Moderately light body. A stale grain flavor that fades in and out detracts from an otherwise tasty and enjoyable beer.","HappyHourHero","Dec 20, 2004"
4.15,17.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Tongueland: The hop blend is oily/piney Goldings and citrus/fruity. Citrusy up front with oiley (but not overly) piney finish. Stellar.","wailingwench","Oct 29, 2004"
