"Pours nice,  has a distinct smell, not bad bit not great.  Nice head but doesn't last. I like it.  Has its own unique appel."

"so the american mild ale is a new concept. is that basically a more malt driven session beer? logically i would say so, but this isnt that. its hoppy as heck, more of an american pale than anything else, so a little weird to tackle conceptually, although especially easy to drink down. clear in looks, but rather copper or amber or brass colored for a pale mild ale. its not english in any way, and even though they make the distinction, its sort of weird to think about what a mild ale is outside of that context. bright hoppiness, not dissimilar to other beers that these guys make. its bitter and clean too, malty, but light, a bunch of fun contradictions, but at the end of the day, this is average by three floyds standards, and not way off from a light american pale ale with decent balance. cool beer, a slugger from the bottle, but not where some of the others are i dont think in terms of being one of a kind."

"So mild ales should honor their namesake but this one is a little bit TOO mild. Overall bright, crisp, effervescent, and quaffable, but there isn't much flavor to be found in this beer. Completely flat characters with both the malt and hops. Brilliant packaging as always though."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer is aptly described as a mild it's not anything the least of all is impressive not sure why they bothered making it."
"This is a really good easy drinking beer.  Really smooth and refreshing but with a lot of mild complex flavors!"

"First real go at a FFF brew... on tap at our (somewhat) local pourhouse, Vintage Estate. This was bright, crisp, and refreshing. Poured a nice amber hue with some long-lasting white head. Some fruity and floral hops on the nose, and crisp bitterness and just enough sweet malty goodness to balance it all out. Nice choice for a lower ABV pale, especially good when looking after 3 kids on the ride home! Can't wait to try more FFF!"

"Pretty decent mild pale ale.  This is my first review of a Three Floyds beer, had it on tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Bowling Green.  Almost a session beer, reasonably low booziness and some pretty good malt flavor with a bit of hops.  Grassy taste.  Pours a goldish yellow, good color.  Not bad."

"Easy drinker. Taste very similar to Zombie Dust. Very similar! It's just much more mild. For that reason, I love this one.  ""Zombie's lil Bro"" is fitting :) ENJOY"

"Nice caramel color but very light smell that doesn't tell you much. Mild ale is very correct.  Pretty mild flavor that is nothing to write home about. Not sure what the fuss is about. Good beer for a mild ale. A little heavy on the fizziness which stuck around on the mouth for a bit."
""
""

"Well carbonated, with a much more hearty feel and flavour than some sessions."

"A good mix of juicy fruit and citrus zest hops with a moderate yeast and malt base but it mostly comes in as a bright, hoppy session ale."

"O: Not sure what to expect as I cracked the top on this one. But hey, it's 3Floyds, so I needn't worry. Definitely a session beer. Light, summery and citrusy smooth."

"Overall: Really nice bitter mild. Tastes like some earthy American type hop. This is a nice easy drinker."
""
""
""
"Copper to light brown in color. I see a half inch of tightly knit off white head. There's some haziness within the beer and plenty of lacing on my glass. Bready malt aroma with a gentle touch of fairly neutral aroma hops. I definitely taste light bready grains in the front of the palate and I get a floral hop finish with a bready grain aftertaste. The mouth is crisp and yet moderately carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky dark honey orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and dank herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus fruit, citrus zest, and slight herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"This beer can be boring at times, but it is what it is! It's a mild ale, so it's not going to be an overwhelming experience. The craftsmanship is impressive and it's perfect for the warm weather. It makes a nice session ale."

"Overall: Another great beer by FFF, and one that I think is sometimes overlooked. This one is comparable in quality and taste to SNPA, though this one has a slightly thinner body in my opinion, and is just slightly darker. Would recommend, especially for those beginning to explore the hoppier sides of craft beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: glad I chose this over Robert and Alpha; will pick up more when available"
""
""
"More hoppy than expected in flavoring, though a metallic note surfaces late. Bitterness is a bit high for my liking. Very sessionable beer, but the hop flavoring isn't my favorite. Lime overpowers."
""
""
""
""
"Pride and Joy is described as a Mild Ale and it seems quite telling as its good in all areas but is, as described, mild. From the lightly colored body to the mild hop aroma to the balance of malt and floral hops, this is mild in all counts. Probably could call it a Sessionable Pale Ale, but all in all its tasty and easy."
""
"taste is very nice. very well-rounded. how do they make such great brew? why doesn't everybody follow this format? is it just a race to find the next novelty? this isn't as stand out as the Zombie Dust, but it's GOOD. dang good. creamy white head. nice soap on the sides. easy to drink. very enjoyable. perfect! I just tried Three Floyds this week. everything has been great. the beer scene is maturing!"

"A really nice well-balanced session candidate, goes down super-smooth and easy. Very easy to like. That said, it's nothing special, just very good at being what it is which is just an easy-drinking thirst quencher. If that's what you're looking for, though, you could do a lot worse."

"Solid ESB, a bit hoppier than most examples of ESBs out there but this is otherwise a nice, sessionable and drinkable take on the style from Three Floyds."
""
"Overall 3floyds accomplished exactly what they wanted to with this one. Recommended."
""
"O - Immensely drinkable, but mild, I suppose, is a relative thing. It makes for the most subtle beer I've had from Three Floyds, but its hops and citrus make it a far bolder statement than some strong ales I've had."

"A very nice session-able Pale Ale. Some what muted hop flavor but enough to get your attention and accentuate the experience. Nice citrus flavors with a touch of grapefruit. Not overwhelming in any of the flavor characteristics. Perfect Segway into the bigger Pales and IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great session beer. Very attractive appearance and an excellent, full aroma. Refreshing and crisp. The flavor profile and mouthfeel do bring out a bit of thinness to it though."

"Pours amber with a 1-finger off white head. Some real good citrus notes on the nose. Orange and lemon are the main culprits, with a thin sugary malt backbone. Pretty good for such a small brew. The taste is very good as well, lots of citrus and tropical notes. It's also very balanced, the malt picks up right after the hops. Mouthfeel is incredibly light, this could be one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. As far as session beers goes, this one is hard to beat. Except for the price of course and the fact that I have to drive 40 mins away to maybe find it. Other than that, this is one of the best session beers I've had."

"A solid beer but not what I've come to expect from Three Floyds. Its appearance is probably its biggest drawback. Just a murky, unappealing color. I have trouble detecting a distinct smell but the feel and taste are satisfying. Tastes a lot better than it looks. A tame but nicely balanced beer. It's the kind of beer I would have loved 20 years ago when I was transitioning from Rolling Rock to craft beer. It's also the kind of beer I'd serve my friends who think Heineken is classy but are afraid of craft beer."

"O - I was expecting nothing from this beer, and got a highly drinkable, clean, crisp beer. It is very enjoyable. I could drink this for hours."
""
""
"Got to try this because of a friend that I traded with. Definitely a good beer but not great. I've had Zombie Dust and Robert the Bruce and I think this is zombie dust before steroids. I definitely recommend it and will drink whenever get the chance to but I am just rating for the sake of rating and overall would give it two thumbs up. Very nice pour and has good amount of carbonation. Didn't let it get warm so I dont know or care to know if it gets better as it warms but doubt it. Taste good cold point blank."

"O: Nicely balanced with a high drinkability. Not the best FFF beer as I'd much rather take a ZD or Alpha King over this, but it's still a nice, low ABV option."
""
""

"O - Very nice session beer. Body isn't too heavy and a nice relaxing feel. Wish there was more citrus, less malt, liked the low ABV, very nice nose - overall very refreshing - good for any occasion."

"On tap at The Rocking Horse in Logan Square. Appearance Pale golden with a fingers worth of off white head that dissipates quickly. Nose Slight grassy notes with floral teases. Hops present but not hugely noticeable. Taste quite mild with a touch of hop and dry finish. Delivers exactly what's advertised here very mild with a hop punch and surprisingly floral. More like fresh hop water following the lead of concur water with a hint of bitter elderflower. Medium bodied with a dry finish which makes new any more and more. Overall, a great session and first beer at dinner. I am not sure if all of the dipa and iipas I have had are taking a till on my palate but I truly am enjoying these session pales. Cheers."

"This is a very easy to drink, crisp, clean and refreshing beer. It's not overly complex, but you could put down quite a few of these during the summer. Nothing out of the ordinary, but does what it wants to do quite well."

"Copper orange in color with a thick, creamy, off white head that leaves behind good lace and retention. Big floral and fruity hop bouquet. Similar in the taste but there's a nice sweetness reminiscent of raw wildflower honey. A bit of malt shows up in both aroma and flavor to give it a bit of balance. Still hop forward. And let's be honest. This isn't a mild. Its another hoppy APA that happens to have a low %ABV and IBU count. There's an interesting earthy and grassy quality to the finish. In summary, pretty sweet and sugary with lots of fruity hops. Almost too sweet and a bit cloying during certain sips. Otherwise easy drinking and delicious."
""
""
"This is a fantastic APA. It's very easy to drink. It's intricate, enjoyable, complex, hoppy, malty, smooth, refreshing, and definitely worth a try. This was incredible."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was how sessionable it was. Through the aroma, flavoring, and feel, this guy sits very much in the same vein as Three Floyds’ other pale ales, but just a bit more toned down, seemingly for the purpose of easing and enhancing drinkability via lightness. The hops remained very fresh, but the grains cheapened up, giving more adjuncts and corn. The nose, too, is interesting sweaty and plastic, but doesn’t change the fact that this is an easy drinking, refreshing offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Either way it a fantastic brew. Lots of flavor but deff mild so it doesn't overwhelm the palate. Nice brew."

""

"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong hops, hint of floral, hint of grass, slight alcohol, slight sweet malt, hint of pale malt, sugar, and a hint of pine. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, hint of floral, pine, slight sweet malt, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, and blend."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: I wish the complexity came in a different manner. with this hop medley i would like stronger hop taste. glad i got to try it on tap and bought a six pack of something else."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall: A very good mild ale that is more like a pale ale. Solid hop mix with a good malt balance."
""
"O: Well, I guess they mostly nailed the idea of trying to come up with an ""American Mild"". A fairly easygoing ale with slightly lower levels of hop bitterness and slightly higher levels of malt than you'd see in a typical APA - though I'd say it still is rather too forceful to really be a session ale - hop heads sure to disagree. Unfortunately, it didn't really add up to anything too exciting for me. Great brewery, but this is my least favorite brew of theirs so far."
""
"O: An enjoyable beer. I think it could be just a bit more hoppy (especially the citrus character), but this seems to be a personal preference. The wheat flavor seems a bit out of place, but I think it's growing on me. Tasty, but nothing that blows your socks off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste/feel: Doesn't taste so much like the smell, but still very awesome. The taste is malt-dominant, and this truly tastes like an APA (unlike Zombie Dust, which I feel is more like an IPA). It's hard for me to describe how this one tastes, but it's just like a gritty, malty, cereal flavor that keeps making me come back for another sip. The bitterness is there, but it's, like the style claims to be, mild. This may be called a mild ale, but it's really not as mild as one would think... a fantastic hop nose, with a delicious flavor. An underdog from Three Floyds."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, I'd pass on it. Nothing special. Which I love changing up the ABV and IBUs in what I drink, but even still I just personally don't like this and wouldn't seek it out again. There are many other Pale Ales I would grab before this one."
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with medium-low levels of carbonation, gently creating a slightly foamy, very smooth mouthfeel. Closes quite dry, with modest residual stickiness lingering across the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A super easy drinking APA, I love the pine and fruit combination"
""
""
""
""
"honeyed biscuit finish and a warmly rounded flavor. Caps off with a sharp pine bitter note on the end. Definitely one I’d enjoy again as an almost-sessionable (in the 5% ABV range) ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured into tulip. Pours dark orange, thin bubbles. You can smell dark fruits, Tastes very bready, some cinnonom, some apple, some cherry but not in a sweet way, just subtle. a hint of bitterness from the hops, earthy. amazing balance between the malt and hops. This is a very easy drinking beer, not one of their poster child's but worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to admit that as a die hard imperial fan I was skeptical about a ""mild ale"". This was no joke though. They pack a good bit of hop character in such a small package. I don't ""session"" but if I did, I would want a whole lot more of this."
""
""
""
"Overall: In my opinion, Three Floyds Brewery is that their best with their APA's. Alpha King, Zombie Dust, and Pride & Joy are all elite examples of the style. I've been lucky enough to have all three and look forward to getting my hands on much more of these masterpieces. Pride & Joy doesn't quite have the pull the other two but this is still a wonderful brew. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get into craft beer as a nice jumping off point."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating, but was purchased recently. Pours a very hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fluffy white head with excellent retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation as well. Aromas of big orange zest, grapefruit, pineapple, bread, floral, light pine, grass, and light citrus rind. Damn nice aromas with nice hop complexity and balance. Taste of orange zest, pine, grapefruit, caramel, bread, floral, grass, and light citrus rind. Good amount of grassy citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, pine, caramel, bread, grass, floral, and citrus rind on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic hop flavor complexity and balance; with a solid malt backbone; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent pale ale! Great hop flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth to drink as expected. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Surprisingly robust floral, lemon peel, and spice hopping on a palpable cracker malt. The flavor contains all of these elements and also a spoonful of pine resin on the side. Almost the dictionary definition of a good sessionable APA."

"Overall: This is one of my favorite summer beers because its so damn refreshing and easy to drink. This just goes down so very easy and is a beer that I dare say, is session able."

"Overall, it's just an insanely well-balanced beer: a soft-touch that Three Floyds doesn't always exercise, but—when they do—shows that they can with aplomb.  Although I'm sure—having not yet tried it—that Yum Yum will be great, I'll miss one of these 3F soft-touches leaving the regular rotation; and I'll likewise miss one of the very few Milds regularly made in America leaving the market."

"Notes: Best option at a bar I ended up with so I gave it a shot. Wasn't exactly sure what the style would be (drinks like an English Pale Ale more or less). Refreshing and solid with a great biscuity malt backbone. Nice choice for a pale."

"Pours golden orange with a nice sized head. It has a general fruity smell with a slight hoppy hint. Taste is very pleasant, very nice citrus hops on the first sip that lead into a nice deeper orange lemon like aftertaste. Mouthfeel is pretty spot on carbonation slightly high. Overall an amazing session beer I wish we had this year round by me."

"O: Three Floyds has done a very good job of coming up with a light, drinkable ale that still has some heft to it. If you associate Three Floyds exclusively with monstrous brews like Dark Lord, Apocalypse Cow, and Arctic Panzer Wolf, Pride & Joy may really surprise you."

"Fresh bottle poured into a duvel tulip. Pours a murky orange amber with an inch of head that shrinks to coat the top. Lacing is decent. Aroma is intense tropical citrus. Pineapple, grapefruit, lemon. It's very three floyds. There's some pepper there too. Taste is mild citrus, some grapefruit and lemon, a bit of orange and pine too. Somewhat bready and caramel malt backs it up. Thin mouthfeel and pretty carbonated. Very good."
""

"Golden orange, hazy with a thick cap of khaki foam that stayed and stayed. Massive lacing. Smells of mild orange pith, caramel-nutty malt. Taste is moderate orange peel/citric hop bitterness balanced perfectly against a caramel-biscuit-nutty malt body. Medium-light body, crisp carbonation, creamy-tingling mouthfeel. Clean, dry finish. Bright and happy, easy drinking and very, very delicious. I'd suck this down by the case if it were available here."
""
""
""
"poured a hazy copper with an inch of foamy white head. aromas of grassy and piney hops, caramel and brown sugar. tastes very bitter up front with a sweet toffee/caramel like finish. a very light tasting pale ale with lots of sweet malts. light bodied and very fizzy on the palate. honestly, this is a great summer lawn mowing beer!"
""

"our first 3 Floyds, and quite a bit lighter than what we normally drink. but definitely drinkable w/ pizza or after a bike ride. good hop bite followed by a wash of malt, sticks around your tongue for a few minutes, but not all afternoon."

"I really like this beer. Everything about it is bright and crisp, in a way that few beers are. The look, the smell, the taste, the feel - all of it has this luminous lifting quality that I'm really enjoying. It's somewhere between a typical APA and IPA, but for me it hits that lightly-hoppy sweet spot better than other top-rated ""APAs"" (like Alpha King and Daisy Cutter) thanks to a lower bitterness, better balance, and more positive hop characteristics."
"The body is light but deep and never boring; like every other apsect, FFF has proven it can be light without lacking substance. It's even sort of creamy on the tongue with a gentle smoothness building off a crisp nip."
"Primarily malty flavor profile, supported by a mild hop character. A little watery like most English Mild Ales tend to be, but pretty darn good given the style. Light body is somehow creamy. A solid English Mild."
""
""
"I won't lie, with the ""Mild Ale"" label I was expecting it to be more of and English mild and not an APA. Anyways, this beer was a pleasant surprise and incredibly satisfying. Pick a bottle up and give it a try!"

"Pours a clear light straw color. Aromas of sweet grains and a touch of flowery hop. In the flavor, very mild with a crisp grainy flavor, some mild pine and citrus, and a touch of sweet bread. Pretty one note but decent at that. Hop flavor is delicate and leafy, with the faintest touch of fruit, mostly muted. One of the mildest beers I've encountered, Pride and Joy goes down like water. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a crisp carbonation. No offensive flavors at all, this would be suitable for even the most casual beer drinker. Still, tasty enough to be considered a fine beer, just a light one. Light body, solid carbonation. Overall, a decent pale mild and one I was glad to try."
""
"O- This beer is an A grade example of what it claims to be, A mild pale ale. Fantastic stuff. Get some."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, there are much better pales out there, but this is decent enough. Inoffensive & easy to get along with."
""
""
"Light bodied with very little carbonation, this beer is easy drinking but not exactly crisp. The body is just strong enough to allow the flavors to really come out without losing drinkability. The lack of carbonation really does not help this beer but it is still refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Pride and Joy pours an orange/copper color with a one finger off white head. Decent lacing on the side of my snifter. Slightly hazy in appearance. The nose is mainly hops, grapefruit, lemon, and a tiny bit of malt. The hops are definitely the star here though. Taste is more of the same w/ a grass flavor added to the nose profile. Very tasty for the style. Feel is very smooth, with the malt taking over, and good carbonation. Very easy to drink session beer. Overall, I'm starting to realize the amazing ability of FFF to create wonderful beers in 'lighter' styles. This would be a go to session brew if I got it in my area. Cheers."

"Smooth and creamy, Pride & Joy definitely earns its name as a great session beer."
"Pride and Joy Mild Ale pours into the glass very bright orange with some bright copper aspects. A nice looking brew with a off white inch that fades to a cap. Small notches down the side. Smell is very fruity with bubblegum, orange peel, tangerine and a small mild maltiness, that is barely a whimper. Taste is very light yet bold with citrus and small malt droppings. Not sure if there is any English essence/ingredients in here as i read it on the bottle, but from the taste I would say no. Feel is light and refreshing with a rip from the carb, not dead and inviting. A nice bitterness mid palate. Real easy drinking here. The low ABV and the feel make this a no brainer for the summertime. Unfortunatly I wont be seeing it again."

"o - overall, not a bad brew...don't think this is classified right as a pale ale. definitely mild...seems more like a british mild with some spicing to me. pretty good. easy to drink and a great session beer (even though it isn't a true session beer at 5%), so perhaps i should say great beer to have a session with."

"Not a bad session beer and lives up to every FFF I've ever tasted. Smell is slightly hoppy for a mild ale, and almost reminds me of an american pale ale. Appearance is slight orange and hazy with a nice three finger head. Taste is very similar with a nice hop/malt balance. Slightly bitter after taste, but finishes very very smoothly. Overall, a very drinkable beer and reminds me of a light APA."
"This is a great session beer. IMO, more representative of an APA than true mild, largely due to the slighltly hoppy character - more than the relatively low IBU's would have you think. Seems to have Centennial characteristics. A very drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"D/O: A fantastic mild ale. Perhaps the best I've ever had. Highly drinkable, very repeatable, thoroughly enjoyable. Far more flavor than you'd expect from such a light, low-carb, low-alcohol offering."

"Bottle. Purchased at Riley’s in Madison. Poured into a tulip glass a clear, medium colored copper with a light white head that collars around the glass. I would say the aroma is rather mild with some subtle notes of citrus and light biscuit. Maybe a little honey like aroma as well. Light citrus sweet notes up front with some lingering bitterness. Probably could be classified as a pale as well as the hops make up the buld of the flavors. Medium/light mouthfeel. Pretty enjoyable."
""
"O - A very good pale across the board, FFF, as a company and it's employees, has an attitude I don't particularly care for, bit I can certainly get on board with this sessionable, crisp brew."
"I really can't say enough good stuff. It isn't overly flavorful with malt or sugar. It is just extremely tasty for the hop heads (if you don't like hops just avoid) and a nice drinking beer."

"D - An enjoyable beer from Three Floyds that probably deserves more credit than it gets, but is overshadowed by its higher ABV siblings. Drinks a little lighter than Alpha King, and a great option for winning over craft beer n00bs."
"It was my pride and joy to drink this! First beer I have smelled that instantly brought me back to sticking my nose in a bag of fresh hops. The head was good with a lace left on the side of the glass. Because of the smell I anticipated a very bitter taste and was surprised to taste a smooth and slightly fruity. This is a summer session beer that I cannot keep my nose out of the glass. 3 Floyd's was pretty highly recommended to me and I am happy to say this vastly exceeded expectations. Well done"
"Overall, a phenomenal brew that would be a staple in my fridge were it available locally."
"O: This is a great ""lawnmower beer"" for your beer geek. Drinkability is off the chart."
"Overall Impression- Awesome brew again from FFF! The apperance was funny seeing tons of things floating around and HOW the heck does a Hotel Bar in Chicago have FFF on-tap!?! Uh, thats what Rachael does best here! Good brew, Good Time, and would say I will be enjoying this again but may be trying more from FFF first before coming back to this one. Didn't blow me away or anything."
"A session beer for me and one that I’m very glad I was able to try; thanks to my man Justin for shipping these out to me last month. This beer went down very easy and I recommend trying it."
"This is very much an easy drinking beer. I was certainly happy to find it at my local bar."
"Overall a great beer, nice balance of lightness and flavor. Not the best beer these guys make but definitely tasty!"
"Not much to take ""Pride"" or ""Joy"" in about this beer. At least not to me. If you're looking for something easy drinking that won't take your attention away from conversation, this is it. If you're looking for something that will match the hype from the brewery and the wacky label, then it's not."
"O: Pride & Joy is great for what it is: a light, refreshing, standard mild ale. It's got bursts of hop presence that will entertain your inner beer geek but a light enough mouthfeel to keep it easily sessionable. Great job."
"Toasted malt and grain up front with minty, floral hop bitterness following. Fruity malt fills in. Light butterscotch in the finish. Moderate to light body. A nice quaffer."
"Not bad at all, this one."
"O- Drinks very nicely for the style. There is something unique to this I can't really put my finger on. Would make for a great session beer."
"I really enjoy this beer. Very easy drinking, clean, crisp hop flavors and nice balance. Too bad it costs $2-3 more than any other craft six-pack on the shelf."
"o - very drinkable and fits the style. seems like it would go well with a lazy summer afternoon."
"One of my favorites, and I used to avoid hops! A great tasting beer from 3 Floyds that surprised me and will definitely be in my fridge again."
"Very flavorful and hoppy ""Mild"" Ale, comes across more as a Amber Ale/Pale Ale hybrid."
"O: Probably my least favorite offering from FFF, but it's still better than most beers. Very drinkable brew."
"O: Hoppy, grainy, tasty, clean, crisp, and easy drinking. What more could I ask for?"
"Pours a hazy light copper with a fluffy white head that settles to a a nice fat cap. Fresh aromas of lightly toasted sweet malt and pine resin/grapefruit hops make for an easy-sniffing nose. Taste is fairly subdued, with some sweet malt and lightly bitter citrus hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, with a touch-over-thin body and good carbonation. Overall I really appreciate what 3F was doing here, making a sessionable mild ale, but I could use just a hair more flavor. Still, I could easily imagine knocking back a sixer while fishing!"
"O - I enjoyed this brew. Good fresh flavor. Very satisfying session brew."
"Pass."
"I'm not rating this as an APA. I'm rating it as an American take on the English Mild Ale. This one pours a nice orangish gold in color with a one finger, soapy off white head. It smells of honey, bready malt, light citrus, and had a faint amarillo esque tinge to start things off. Maybe I'm just anticipating my next Gumballhead, I don't know. If I had to describe it, I'd call it a hoppy ESB based purely on the aromas. Very interesting to say the least. The flavors consist of smooth, slightly sweet malts and a soft and vibrant piny hop presence. It has really nice flavor and is very well constructed. The flavors work in near perfect unison. It finishes clean and drinks pretty light. It is very, very sessionable. Overall this beer is quite solid. There aren't many beers that I'd buy an entire six pack of but this one would be perfect for a prolonged session outside or with friends."
"It's a nice, easy drinking beer!"
"O: Three Floyd's Pride & Joy is exactly what I figured it would be: an easy drinking, sessionable APA. It's in the upper middle class of the style, and I could easily see myself enjoying a sixer of this stuff on a football Sunday. Not worth denting the cellar for, but certainly worth checking out."
"O-Pretty good Pale Ale that is well balanced"
"A very nice lighter Pale ale style."
"O - Overall this a one of the best session ales I have had! Great balance between hops and smoothness. I like that its only 5% ABV and it taste so great. Its showcase is the hops! Thumbs UP!"
"O: I really wish we had this in Ohio as it would probably be one of my go-to bottles. I really enjoyed it."
"O) The nose on this brew is slightly misleading. I guess what I'm saying is that if this beer was a chick, you'd call it a tease, but that would be completely unfair. This beer looks delicious, has a very pleasing taste, a good mouth feel, and goes down great. I'm glad I picked up this six pack. Well done Three Floyds..."
"I told my wife it was like a ""baby IPA"" - I have several friends that I'm trying to enlighten (read as: getting then to put down their cans of Coors Light) and Pride and Joy would be a great beer to introduce them to. I will be having this again."
"Orange glow to the beer, slight haze. Head was pithy and minimal, small white lacing lingers in the glass. Aromas are awesome, like orange juice and fresh hops. Flavor is a close match, really nice malt base, tropical and a hint of fruit, balanced nicely with a load of citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is a but prickly, carbonation shines on the finish. Great brew, again, I would drink this often if it were available."
"Overall, Pride & Joy is my ideal session beer - loads of hops, robust and nuanced aromas, and a basic yet satisfying flavour profile. Not much more you can ask for here. An excellent brew."
"Aroma is strong and malty with a rich, fruity overtone that is largely apple with hints of pear and banana. It pours an appealing golden amber with a thick and fluffy, it not too persistent, off-white head. Malty flavor has a firm fruity undertone and a hint of hoppy bitterness. Texture is smooth as almond milk, slightly thick and just a little fizzy. Overall, not too shabby and worth at least a try."
"O- While this may not be one of the most hop heavy offerings from FFF, it still is quite flavorful and drinkable. Not as good as Alpha King or Zombie Dust, but one that I can drink plenty of without killing my taste buds."
"Not the most appropriately named beer in their arsenal. Alpha King, Dark Lord and Dreadnaught should be their ""pride and joy"". This beer is good, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't quite reach the bar that their other beers set. Still, the quality shows."
"O- As others have stated, this is a scaled down verison of Alpha King. Light hops and a strong malt presence combined with the high carbonation makes this an easy to down (yet unexciting) drink. While this beer will not blow you away, FFF accomplished what they set out to do with this offering; they created a sessionable, light brew with a nice little kick to it."
"I don't often buy Floyd's beer outside of Dark Lord and this was no exception. A kind soul brought this to a party last night and I summarily cobbled this left behind. I would say it is what it is, but then I'd have to punch myself."
"I like all of the flavors present here, so I really enjoy drinking this beer. I'd rather a beer where all these flavors are magnified, but I know that wasn't the goal here. For an APA this is a bit light, but for a sessionable, delicious beer--which was the intent, according to the label--this is fantastic."
"D- refreshing and very drinkable just not something that is going to bowl you over."
"O: I really like Pride & Joy. Granted I haven't had many mild ales so I may have graded this a bit high, but this really over exceeded my expectations...wish I would've grabbed an entire six pack of this."
"Pours a light shade of orange. The two finger head is foamy and off-white. Only a slight aroma of citrus and floral hops. The hops deliver more with a taste. Nuances of lemon citrus and light pine notes. A bit of malty sweetness provides a nice balance. The body is on the lighter side. Very refreshing and inviting."
"O- a session PA with slight above average tastes if available in sixers i would buy it now and then..its pretty good"
"O- great session beer. Slightly bitter and not too heavy. Delicious."
"I'm guessing this one had been sitting on the shelf for a long time. Not that I would know it when I bought it, as FFF has no freshness info. Even fresh, their beers just don't do it for me, and never knowing how old the beer is that I'm buying seals the deal. I'm done."
"O: Another solid beer from Three Floyds, perfect beer to sip on this hot summer day."
"12 oz bottle into a snifter...I always say this is my least favorite of the 3Fs that go into 6ers, but I'm not sure if that's really the case in my heart because I seem to finish my supply of P&J faster than all of the others except AK. It's sort of like a baby sister to AK, a less hoppy and lighter pale ale. If you judge this as basically being that sort of brew, a light beer version of their flagship, it's a shining success. So drinkable, so good. Classic 3Fs hop profile, understated, with a refreshing and sweet malt backing it. Super clean and refreshing. Great for washing down a cheeseburger or pretty much anything."
"o: A good pale, but sad the high point is the nose as I'd rather drink a pale than sit and smell it...and I'd want to drink lots of them. I could have a few of these here and there, but I'd want something with more pop in the flavor. Perhaps this would be much better sitting next to a pool on a very very very hot day."
"O: very drinkable, flavors are not very complex, kind of tastes like a muted version of Alpha King (tasted these beers side by side)"
"I was excited about this mild ale but was a little bit let down own it. Even though it is flavor foward mild ale, which is a style I only have a few to compare with, it did little for me. Don't get me wrong it was good just not very rememberable. A little fruit and caramel it was enjoyable, and I know it is a session beer and it is well done. I just don't think I'll get another six pack for a few months. Good day."
"This is next to a lake Erie monster is darker, with a nice deep copper penny color. The nose does subtle attacks of citrus and brings thoughts of how good the taste will be. The taste isn't the hoppy bomb I thought I might get but then again it wasn't supposed to be. There is some good citrus hop in the front. The mouthfeel is full of tingly life, lots of carbonation. Overall it's pretty awesome for a hot summer day with a seasonable beer done in 3 Floyd standards. I could drink this all day or night."
"D: The beer is surprisingly not as drinkable as is desired due to the style of the beer."
"Overall this is a really good beer. I enjoyed it and would definitely drink it again."
"Pride & Joy pours out as a dark orange color almost a light brown, The body is a little cloudy cutting down on the clarity of the brew. The head was pretty good looked thick and white and laced the glass nicely. The smell of the beer had a good balance of hops and malts on the nose, it also had a bit of a yeast aroma coming off it too. The taste of the beer was soft and had a good amount of malt in the flavor. The bitterness come though in the end with the aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer was smooth and medium bodied. Overall It's a very nice brew but probably my least favorite of the 3 Floyd's year round releases."
"O: nice, solid, drinkable beer. Would probably drink it regularly if it were distributed here."
"I thought this was a different style, so I was surprised to taste the hoppiness in this. The hops and bitterness wasn't overpowering as I've experienced with other pale ales, but it was definitely noticeable and distracting. Taste was that of grapefruit and pine (?). Very smooth and drinkable beer, but not my style and the hops to my taste buds are just too funky. I recommend this for pale ale lovers and hopheads, but not to people like me who don't care for them."
"M: Medium light body, well carbonated, with a pleasant fine grained texture."
" beeragent ( New Braunfels, Texas )"
" is no doubt, this is a good sessionable pale ale."
"O - overall, I really enjoyed this one."
"Overall: Definitely pleasantly different from what I'd anticipated--even after smelling the aroma. A unique FFF take on the mild style. A very sessionable warm weather ale. Who says that summer beer has to mean golden lager?"
"O: Definitely a great brew. I am happy that BA went with this brew's proper style; and APA. This doesn't come close to any Mild I've had, but is great as an APA. I'm very happy I was able to try this delightful draught."
"O (D) - Really a very interesting beer. It's not great tasting, but it's complex and intriguing which absolutely counts for something."
"Pours light gold with two fingers of pure white foam. Minimal lacing. Fragrant citrus hop nose with very mild malt presence; mango and tropical fruit as it warms. Taste is the same, with a nice crispness and very slight bitterness on the finish. Carbonation is medium-high, appropriate for the style. Overall, really tasty and highly drinkable beer which manages to be light but still flavorful. I can see this as a fantastic palate cleanser for Indian or Thai food. Great stuff."
"Trying most of Three Floyds spread in a shipment I just got. Tasty appetizer to the other FFF brews. Decent, but nothing insane. Good summer brew with a hoppy surprise."
"SOLID PALE ALE, BUT NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"O- As you would expect from an American interpretation of pretty much any style, it might be a little over hopped. Still pretty good though. Light enough to have a couple of them."
"D - This is basically like a ""sessionable"" IPA. A good beer but a bit of a weak sister to most good IPA's and not enough malt balance for a PA."
"Served from a 12 oz bottle. Pours with a smallish head of off-white foam. Beer is a medium to light copper, lighter than I would expect of a true English mild ale. Hoppy, citrusy, spicy aroma, again more hoppy than I would expect of a mild ale, but very pleasant nonetheless. Taste is very good, with a nicely restrained but still appreciable level of hoppiness. Mouthfeel is pleasant and refreshing with an apprpriate level of carbonation. As a more accomplished reviewer has noted earlier, this is not at all a true English mild ale. It is much closer to an American pale ale. Given 3f's penchant for pushing the hops however, it might fairly be described as ""mild"" by their standards. Overall though, I found this to be a quality easy to drink brew."
"O - Not a bad APA, although not the amazing thing that is Alpha King. I'd go with this one if you like your APAs slightly more malt forward, but still with a bit of hops."
"Great session beer, plenty of flavor, easy drinking, low ABV."
"Grade: B+"
"O: Three Floyds really does hoppy beers well and this is no exception. A really nice pale ale."
"O: This is a really good pale ale and well above average. I really dig the hop spice and the well rounded balance at the end. I would definately purchase this if distributed in Missouri. Glad I got the chance to try it."
"This is a nicely-balanced session beer, not going for anything more than a very tasty and drinkable (and complex) profile. Worth drinking again."
"Beer is sweet at first giving way to a floral hoppiness that finishes with a grainy aftertaste. It is an average beer that unfortunately shits on the term ""mild""...I don't hate it, but I expected a flavorful low alcoholic malt and hop experience and what I got was a thin grainy water hop mess. I drank three of them and I doubt I'd go out of my way for more. Worth a try but does not need a repeat."
"I thought this was a Mild Ale and not an American Pale Ale. I never would have purchased it, otherwise. Besides being a bit peeved over the mis-labeling I thought this ale was just another run-of-the-mill American Cascade packed hop beverage. Its appearence was a light amber, plenty of head and a big whiff of cascade hops in the nose. The taste was dominated by the Cascades with a moderate malt background; the body was average. The finish smooth with a touch of sweetness."
"Pours medium amber into my nonic. Somewhat cloudy with just a skimming of white head. Smell is dominated by hops. Taste is quite hoppy as well. Lots of citrus hop flavor with some nice bready malt in the background. Carbonation seems a little low but doesn't detract from the beer at all. Finishes somewhat sweet. Goes down real well. I'm not sure I'd call it a mild ale(American Mild?), but I could certainly see myself drinking a few of these during the warmer months."
"D: ill finish it, but wont seek it out again. kind of boring."
"D - I like IPAs the most but if I could only have one type of beer in my house this could be it. My malty lover friends and I could enjoy this beer after lawn mowing or a bike ride on a hot day."
"D- this is a decent beer and very drinkable, just kinda boring to me. FFF has alot better beers out there. Give this one a try but don't expect to be wowed by this beer"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into tulip glass. Pours a nice dark golden color with some fluffy white head that doesn't stick around for too long, but leaves some very nice lacing on the glass throughout the session. The aroma is overwhelmingly hoppy with some pine, caramel, and citrus notes coming through. Flavor is a bit more mild, but less pleasant when compared with the aroma with some slight bitterness throughout. There are dark particles at the bottom sitting of my glass (the darkest sediments I ever seen). Fizzy light mouthfeel, due to the moderation carbonation. This is a tasty brew, but my not quite as delicious as my favorite APA from Three Floyds - Alpha King."
"Mouthfeel is average for a 5% pale ale, and the carbonation is present but it feels relatively light compared to what I was expecting from that large head. I should have compared this one side by side with Alpha King as the Pride and Joy really nails the pale ale category, but I wouldn't necessarily advertise it as a ""mild"" though at 5%, it is quite sessionable."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty good beer. I would definitely have another one, but it's not my favorite from 3 Floyds."
"So I sitting at the bar enjoying a Gumball Head when I survey the beer selection and see....Three Floyds Pride and Joy....I figure ""why not""! I pour the beer and find a cloudy golden color with thin white head. Wasn't much to smell either. The taste was decent as well as the mouth feel. Drinkability...SESSION!!! All night long baby....just like Lionel! Probably a bad idea to have this after the Great Gumball Head....but hey this is a decent beer!!! Enjoy my friends!!!"
"The taste is very mild. crisp and bitter with little flavor profile. easy to drink, just very boring. like awesome smelling carbonated water or something. I remember at one time really enjoying this beer, but it seems to be lacking a malt profile that I recall. all I get on the flavor is a bit of earth and then it just kind of leaves a bitter taste on the back of the tongue. the feel is nice and I suppose it's easy to drink. I let it warm up significantly and it improved with a bit of beery yeast and spicy flavors that were decent."
"NOTES: This is a great beer, and a great example of an American Pale Ale with a nice balance of hop to malt, and lightly floral and grassy notes. This was super enjoyable, and would be a great sold beer for a hot summer day. A real session beer in my opinion."
"D- This is a nice brew but with other great APAs out there I can;t see revisiting it."
"Thanks Josh!"
"D: Good stuff. Perhaps a bit one dimensional. Overall, very good."
"Opens bold and juicy with flavors of grapefruit and citrus hops coming through loud and proud. Suggestions of pine resin surface, followed by a tang of lime. Crisp mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Hop bitterness dominates, but is held in check by enough pale malt to make this APA imminently sessionable. Well balanced and extremely refreshing."
"D - I could go for another when I'm in the mood for straight hops and didn't what the IPA/DIPA abv."
"I snagged a six pack of this at my local store cause I know it just came in and is fresh. Pours out a copper color, with a half inch head. Not much effervescence, head turns into a thin lacey bit. Smell is a big floral smack of lemony/lime/grapefruit hops and candied malts, like Alpha king but less dank and resinous, easier on the nose is how I'd put it. Taste is citric hop, more lemon, less grapefruit and some balance from a lightly toasty malt, never overly sweet or too rich. This beer is quite balanced, far more than Alpha King, which is great, don't get me wrong, but THIS is the APA, that is definitely an IPA, both not normal! Anyway, mouthfeel is rich and full but never overwhelming and though technically not a session beer, I could definitely learn to like more of these. Pride and Joy is highly drinkable with a refreshingly large dose of citric hops that makes this a great break from all the big bold APA's and IPA out there."
"This is a really tasty beer. Nothing extraordinary, but a really great solid sessionable pale ale. The flavor is impressive for a 5% beer. I will be sure to trade for this one again."
"Overall, an easy going beer but nothing really stands out to me."
"This pours a medium copper with a two finger head to begin with that disappointing rather quickly in my 3/4 pint Three Floyds glass. On the nose the primary notes are grapefruit and a distant pine, but nothing jumps out as very assertive. In the mouth the grapefruit combines with a forward breadiness, with the pine riding on a long wave of carbonation further back. This is a beer one could drink all night long, a very nice mixture of being interesting enough without any one part of it being fatiguing."
"D - I would definitely have a few more round of this beer; easy drink ability and a beer I could use to ease my friends into the craft world. It does lack a lot of bite so don't come to this beer looking for anything remotely close to some of the hop beers FFF make. Like the label says, it's a 'mild ale.'"
"Pride & Joy from Three Floyds is a very drinkable beer that falls victim to being difficult categorize. 3F wants to call it an American Mild, a sessionable ale brewed with American hops. The beer is a solid amber with little head and aroma. There is just a twinge of tangerine aroma, but not much other than that. The malt is restrained as well in the taste with just a little caramel and graininess. Again the hops are just barely there. I wish there was more hops, malt, flavor, aroma, which in some respects, keeps me drinking more. A good sessionable mild, but not a great pale ale."
"Poured into a Great Divide glass burnt orange with a very thick froathy white head. Great head retention and lacing. Looks picture perfect. Despite my allergies, I can actually smell floral hops. The taste has a odd hop presence that actually leads to it's name, rather mild. The bitterness in the aftertaste is rather strong. The aftertaste also leads to a dry mouthfeel, which is also well carbonated."
"Nice to see a guy like this on-cask closer to home. Take that, somewhat long drive to Munster! Anyway, it pours a clear copper-amber topped by a surprising half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises a mountain of cascade hops, some pine needles, and a light undercurrent of caramel. The taste holds notes of greens, flowers, light orange peel, and an even more reserved undertow of caramel. The body is medium, with no really detectable carbonation and a relatively smooth feel. Overall, a very nice pale, one that seems to benefit from cask-conditioning (and I suspect some dry-hopping involved as well)."
"This beer pours a thin head attached to an orange amber body. The smell is definitely of leafy hops, lemon, orange, and coriander. The flavor is smooth on cask. The bitterness of the hops seems rather highly dry hopped. This is balanced by the backing flavor of some sweet bready malts. I also believe I tasted perhaps a hint of nutmeg in the flavor. This has a nice creamy viscosity to it on cask and is rather smooth and pleasant. It's an easy drinking beer, and comes recommended from me."
"Now here's a ""gateway"" beer. Alcohol won't scare anyone off so you can have more than one, there's enough hops to get your fix, enough malt to keep the ""nubes"" from spitting it out, and oh yeah, it doensn't taste too bad either."
"It's very citrusy-hoppy but also soft and sweet--something about the malt profile was making me think ""green tea and puffed rice," which is strange, for a beer, but that's what I was thinking, and oh, it was delicious. It's hoppy but gentle, smooth but exciting, very quaffable all around. I will definitely be coming back to this one."
"D- This is the second time I've had this and the first one did the same thing with fizzing over out of the bottle. If you can get throught all the fizziness it's a good solid beer. I don't think I will buy this for a while the carbonation really ruins this beer for me I have to wait for it to setlle down to really get the taste of it. When I open a beer I want to drink it right now and not wait 20 min."
"D. Drinkability Really?? After tasting this beer you WILL want more. It is deffinetly worth the long drive to get it for me."
"D- The lower ABV on this beer makes it closer to a session beer. This is a gem in the 3 Floyds portfolio that doesn't get too much recognition. A perfect jump into the world of 3 Floyds ""we're not normal"" mentality."
"D - Pretty good. Prettay, prettay...."
"There is little aroma and mild flavor which is not a fault, per se, for a session beer. This beer is refreshing and easy to drink too. However, I am sure that there's a way to do whatever this beer does, and yet, not cross the 4% ABV mark."
"Great session beer. I would be lucky to have access to this everyday."
"It has a pretty good drinkability with light crisp ale flavors, light malty sweetness to balance the hops, the only thing taking away is the lingering hop resins with fresh hop flavors, which taste great but take a bit away from drinkability."
"D: Not half the beer that Alpha King and Gumballhead are. It's always puzzled me why FFF picked this one as part of their standard line-up. why not Black Sun? That's different. Still, 2nd class FFF is better than A game efforts from most breweries!"
"very high. If i'm bringing a 6pack to a party, this might be it. great taste, aroma, mouthfeel. a perfect drink for any occasion."
"D - I don't know how I feel about this. Maybe I was too hard on P&J - it is almost like Alpha King is Pride & Joy's smoking hot older sister: although Pride & Joy is still attractive / tasty, it isn't up to par with Alpha King, making a good beer seem inferior when in fact it is a good beer."
"OVERALL: As mentioned above, on a hot, humid, summer afternoon in downtown Chicago I really couldn't ask for anything more. Especially right before heading back into the office for a few last hours of work for the week. It is a lighter feeling beer, but does not lack in the flavor department at all. Three Floyd's, as usual, does it again."
"The bottle calls this beer a Mild Ale and BA labels it as an APA, I am more inclined to classify it as the latter. This is a well crafted, easy to drink beer that fits right in with the Three Floyds style. Very good, my only complaint is that it is not readily available in my area..."
"Thanks Nate!"
"D: Great session beer, a good one for those prefer to not go hop heavy all night. Classic mild taste for a smooth finish and an all around good experience."
"D. Crisp and refreshing. I plan to pick up a case of this for my next party if I can find it (no Ohio distribution so hopefully I can find it in KY or IN)."
"d - A nice ale. Some nice citrus in the smell and a decent taste. Would try again."
"Cheers!"
"This is the first beer I have ever tried by FFF. Poured from bottle into a 12 oz stein. Pours a hazy caramel colour with a thick white head that lasted forever. Has a nice hoppy, yeasty smell with big hints of citrus. Has a nice bitter taste backed by a strong yeasty bread finish. Drinks great, flavorful all the way through especially towards the end as it warmed. A great introduction to FFF."
"D: Good solid beer. Anytime I get a pick six, would always put one of these in for the price. Anytime you come over I'll have a few in the fridge!"
"D: This is a delicious APA. Very light yet flavorful. I wish there was a little more to the mouth, and it could have had a better head, but this doesn't take away from its drinkability too much. If this beer was local I'd buy it often."
"D: For an APA, this is stands out as full of flavor without destroying your taste buds. Sessionable."
"D- Very drinkable... I would have said ""sessionable"" without advance knowledge of the ABV!!!"
"D: Really nice sessionable almost session strength beer. Milds aren't my thing, but this is good. I'd have one again if no more flavorful beers were available."
"This would be my 2nd beer from Three Floyds I'm trying (got some good ones as extras in a trade). Pours a nice golen/amber color with a small white head. The smell is very appealing with it's lovely hop scent (not as appealing as Alpha King was though, but unique in its own way). Not as malty as alpha king, but more of a west coast style apa. A bit of a piney scent as well. The taste is not what I expected. Possibly some un-American hops used in this one. I get a taste in this beer that I can't really put my finger on...I wish I had more of this so I could figure out what it is. It is pretty delicious though. Not as hoppy as its scent, but definitely got somethin special goin on here. Possibly some sort of herbs and spices. It's gonna bug me for the rest of the night now wondering what that flavor is that I'm getting. Mouthfeel is okayt, and drinkability is very high. I'm very happy with this beer, but frustrated at the same time."
"D: Very easy to drink while still staying full-flavored and bitter- at 6.5% an easy and great Ale"
"Flavor is a lot better. While is starts watery, it follows with a wave of hops and citrus fruit. The hops are very nice, only slightly malty, and a light crisp mouthfeel. Carbonation is high. For the style, it's a nice drinker. Overall, a solid pale ale."
"I could drink this all damn day, it's got a nice balance to it. It's also flavorful but refreshing, and there is no noticable alcohol character contributing here despite it being 6.5% Mild or not, it's a damn fine beer!"
"Overall, this is one of the best beers all around for this category to what I have had to date. Near perfect balance makes me wish I could get FFF in Ohio and also makes me want to take a drive to Indiana right now. Highly recommend this beer to anyone looking for a great APA with no overwhelming bitterness but great flavor."
"Very nicely balanced and very summer-like mild ale."
"D- Perfect! A perfect 5 this is another FFF brew that would be a staple for me all summer long!"
"I couldn't agree more having sampled 6 other 3F's offerings. I'd like to add that I find this to be a great session beer that can accompany most foods. I'll definitely pick up a case the next time I visit the midwest."
"I love Pride & Joy, it is my ""house beer", a staple in my fridge at all times..."
"Libation: Easy drinking and flavorful. Even though this is quite hoppy, it's much less of a hop assault than many other 3F products. As is custom at Three Floyds, this beer is not brewed at all to style, but it is a solid offering which is very enjoyable and milder that most any other 3F beer."
"Served in a pint glass it appeared a clear orange color with a finger of white head. Fair amount of lacing along the glass and decent retension. Nose is lightly malty with citrus hops that have a hint of orange. Taste is mildly bitter with notes of pine, citrus and seemingly fruity hops. Mild bitterness resides in the mouth. Light clean tasting beer with a mild level of carbonation. I could easily throw a few of these back if given an opportunity."
"D: Very drinkable. Could drink this all day long, good on a warm day."
"Overall? Yeah, see above. Probably too hoppy and alcoholic to really satisfy those looking for an English mild, but as an overexaggerated American version of same, it works pretty well. American Pale Ale is probably a style broad enough to contain this beer, but just barely."
"This is a tasty brew, but my not quite as delicious as my favorite from Three Floyds - Alpha King. All inn all though its a good beer and something I drink regularly."
"Another solid brew from FFF. I really like the hop character of this."
"I really think that this gets criminally overlooked when you have to play second fiddle to the likes of Alpha King, Gumballhead, and Dreadnaught but this is one damn tasty and easy drinking APA in it's own right! It's tough to quite call this sessionable while at near 7% but you would never know it from the super easy feel and drinkibility of this. Just another gem of an offering from Three Floyds."
"Drinkability - I could easily drink a few of these, but the lower carbonation doesn't make it real refreshing. The flavors it has with a little more fizz would be quite good."
"D: Easy to drink, light bodied with nice hop presence"
"Drinkability: Without getting too concerned with what style this truly is, I can conclude it is easily drinkable. Having a few of these will make for a solid session."
"It is definately a mild especially for FFF and it is not bad by far but just not spectacular."
"drinkability - could easily tip back 6 of these on a summer afternoon"
"Notes - I was interested in trying this beer because the label said mild. However BA's calling it a APA makes much more sense for what the style of this beer is. I was a little disappointed."
"D-Very easy drinking although there's not that much that interests me here. I didn't have the chance to look this up before buying it and expected a hoppy mild ale, not a pale ale, so it's a little disappointing in that regard as well."
"Drinkability- This stuff goes down like honey, very impressive beer. A beer this drinkable at this ABV is sometimes a rare find. I know it is not a ""session"" beer by definition but I can tell you a six pack of this stuff seems to disappear rather quickly. I will look for this again!"
"Could session these because of low abv and it tastes light enough to not fill you up too quick."
"The mouth feel was thin and pale. Good session beer, but the flavors were confusing and lacked any fruit note that would be typical in an American Pale Ale."
"D: I can't help but be reminded of a bitter when I drink this beer. Tea leaves up front are characteristic and defining. Body is light which helps overall drinkability but I'm not really all that sure what I'm supposed to be getting from this beer. Balanced but confused with odd flavor combinations. Worth a try though."
"Drinkability: A very nice beer that despite being 6.5%, drinks very sessionable. Love to have more of this."
"This is one mild ale! Enough hops to wake you up, but smooth and crisp. This could be one helluva session beer at 6.5%. One of Three Floyds lighter styles, but delicious nontheless."
"D - This one was really enjoyable...I had two of these and could have had two more...I actually enjoyed Pride & Joy a little more than Alpha King...the citrus hops seemed more pronounced...I'll have to try again at a later date...until then Three Floyds are doing a great job!"
"D - Hmm. I could probably chug this, but it's much better to just sit and enjoy on a hot summer day."
"D - So easy to drink - an Americanized mild? - Yeah. I really dig this since it has flavors that are subtle yet still noticeable in all ingredients - very drinkable for 6.5%- Great to be able to try it on tap!"
"Overall a very easy drinking flavorful but milder beer. It's not as good as Alpha King, but I'm sure this beer has a place with a lot of people looking for something lighter and more drinkable."
"D - Pride and Joy drinks almost like Gumballhead or Alpha King light... perhaps it could be called Alpha Queen. Regardless, this is a poundable pale ale with a mild hop character that went down with ease."
"D - A nice Three floyds session beer, but if I had to choose I'd still stick with the GBH"
"3.5 D: Okay brew, but not impressive."
"Taste was pleasant, it was a good restrained hop amount, decent malt backbone, light roasting. Reminded me of a small beer version of the Alpha King. Easy drinking, didn't thin out midway through, enjoyed it."
"Drinkability - great flavors without being overpowering, i've had several introductees to craft brewing try this out and they have all enjoyed it thoroughly. this is a great session beer that has in my experience appealed to broad tastes."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a citrus and grassy hops aroma. Taste is very smooth and a citrus, that is slightly grapefruit in nature, flavor. Up front with citrus in flavor and smell, and off the palate, all citrus and slightly hoppy with a smooth medium feel."
"D-this has a nice hop profile and a superb mouthfeel. at 5% alcohol, why can't I have this as a session ale all the time?"
"I almost feel as though I'm doing this beer an injustice by reviewing it out of the bottle instead of on tap, but whenever I go to 3F there are too many other beers to try! I poured this into a snifter instead of a pint glass, it left a half inch of foamy white head. It smells like freshly cut pine and mango. Very Nice. The taste is hoppy but mild compared to the Alpha King. Very woody, somewhat citrusy. There's some caramel and toffee in there too. The aftertaste has a faint maple and oak flavor to it. Good carbonation, this is a great year-round beer no matter what the temperature is! Very good out of the bottle too. I'll be sure to jot down my impressions of this beer next time I have it on tap. As good as it is out of the bottle, you can expect much more when it's draft."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours a clear gold with a 2 finger white head. Big floral hop aroma, way bigger than I expected with a ""mild"" ale. It has a pleasant sweet citrus flavor, the finish is crisp. The beer is medium bodied, and very smooth. A very good pale ale. Even though FFF considers it a mild, it is bigger than some IPA's I have had."
"This beer drinks quite well and is a very enjoyable beer. It goes down really well and is pretty light on the pallet. A really easy drinking beer."
"Pleasantly suprised with this Pale Ale. Got this one from mystikyle71 as a freebie in trade (thanks buddy). Poured from 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a dark golden color with about 3/4 inch of head. Smell was sweet and very inviting. Let's get down to business the taste. Great sweet taste with mild hop, malt balance, and sweetness that I like. Finsihes smooth with a lingering sweet taste. Tastes somewhat watered down during the finish. High drinkability due to the excellent flavor. Strongly recommended."
"Not my idea of what a mild is, so as far as style is concerned, I'd have to say it doesn't fit the style. But it's still great. Pours a gold body, thin white head accompanies. Aromas are hoppy to the max, with caramel to balance out the aroma. Taste is bitter, sweet caramel, some earth flavours. Finish is bitter and lingering. Medium bodied. A great session brew! 3F does it again!"
"D: All day drinkability. Perfect session beer."
"Overall a real nice beer. A bit on the tame side for FFF but you can't make everything a hop bomb. Great for sessioning."
"Probably the best tasting session beer I've had. Enough flavor to make me want more, but not overbearing and heavy on the alcohol. Really nice beer."
"Drinkability - All things being equal an easy drinking offering that isn't easily classified. To be in the same classification as the FFF Alpha King Pale Ale....I don't know. Totally different style. I'll grab another case at DLD 2010."
"Conclusion: Nice hoppy quaffing beer; a good ""American Session Ale"" if you will"
"A decidedly average brew. Nothing special, but nothing bad about this one. Drinkability is good, and I'd recommend this one a BMC drinker trying to get into craft beer."
"D: Very high. If this one weren't as expensive as Alpha King and the other regulars, I could see this being a go to session beer."
"D - This brew is easy to swallow. Nice and refreshing..not too complex. I wish I had a second."
"D-I would drink this beer regularly, but it takes the back seat to it's brother Alpha King."
"Poured a hazy amber with a moderate head that faded to a skin. The aroma was just a little hoppy. The taste was more pine needles than citrus, not much sweetness. Mouth feel was light to medium bodied with reasonable carbonation. Drinkability was very good. This was like a mild IPA, and not very satisfying. I'm not that familiar with mild ales, so...while P & J wasn't a great beer, it hasn't turned me off to the style. I'll try a mild again now that I have something to compare."
"D - Really easy drinker...with any kind of physical activity, these will disappear really fast. Better keep a bunch on hand, because you will go through them fast. Good and flavorful, light in alcohol, and very smooth."
"Nice beer."
"Overall a great session beer. It borders the line of APA/IPA and does it with some flair. I'm happy to be in the 3 Floyds distribution range, a quality company."
"Pours a golden orange colour with a 1 finger head with good carbonation that bubbles along the glass. Nose consists of citrus hops and hints of doughy bread and sweet malty aromas. Taste, up front is sweet and citrusy with a bitter hoppy aftertaste that lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied. Drinkability is high, not over powering in any of the characteristics and a very enjoyable beer from a reputable brewery. Good work 3F!"
"drinkability is high - this is a beer i would serve to any newbie looking to getting into craft beers"
"Taste is mildly fruity with an IPA like bitter finish. I could drink this all night long. Can anyone say session beer?"
"Tastey beer, try it by the six pack"
"Drinkability: Quite high. The ABV is more than manageable and the flavors are nice and bitter combined with a nice citrusy and malty sweetness that makes for some easy drinking. A great choice for a warm day as it's quite refreshing."
"A clear copper color with a massive dense white head that sticks around and leaves incredible lacing. Looks really nice to me. The smell is just pure resinous hops. Not much of a malty presence at all in the nose...maybe I'll have to wait to smell it once the head dies down a bit, but I expect to be able to detect some sweetness. The first thing I notice in the taste are the moderate to medium esters. It dominates the hops somewhat in the flavor department. Maybe this only had a heavy dose of dry-hopping - maybe move some back to flavor. There's also a spicy herbal flavor, which provides a very dry tartness, next to some chalky, powdery flavors. This is the first time I've actually noticed what is called 'soapiness' in a beer - I can taste it here, like hand soap or something, though it's not incredibly prominent. The malt is toasty and crackery at best, though I kind of expected bready and sweet to back this up. The hop flavors finally return in the finish. The mouthfeel is actually pretty good, but not great. It's a bit light bodied, and dry, but occasionally feels kind of full because of the creamy head. The drink is kind of slow, but good. A nice and enjoyable beer, kind of middle of the range in ABV. This is probably not the best of 3F's work, but still quite better than many beers of the same style (though this kind of defies complete classification - the bottle says mild, here says APA, kind of fits in both)."
"Nice and drinkable, just the way a liquid should be"
"D. Really great sweet, bitter balance. Refreshing and easy to drink. A really nice ale."
"Sweet malt and citrus hop aromas. Pale copper, almost orange appearance. White head with moderate retention. Mild hop bitterness with good malt flavors; well balanced. Medium-light body with good mouthfeel. Very smooth and easy to drink; a good session beer. This is Three Floyds take on the American Mild. 42 IBU 5% ABV."
"Drinkability: An enjoyable beer, and quite a different Pale Ale. I've had a few beers by Three Floyd's, and this one lives up to the reputation of the Alpha King and Dreadnaught. If you see it somewhere, it's worth a shot. However, it's nothing out of the ordinary. I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"I usually pass up Pride And Joy for it's hoppier brother Alpha King, being that I am about to go halves on a keg of this with my non hop head brother in law, I had to convince myself it's worth it. The appearance is something special, cloudy amber/straw with a fluffy white head that lasted for days. The nose has some sour citrus, a bit grassy, reminds me of Orangina. The taste is light, crisp, citrusy, did I detect coriander? This is a summer sipper. I could probably drink about 100 of these if they were ice cold."
"My trip to Chicago came up empty for Gumballhead, so I picked up some of 3F's other session beer. Definitely more of a pale ale than a mild, it's pretty tasty stuff and worth a try."
"A copper brew with a gold tint. The two-finger light tan head recedes slowly, leaving a nice sheet of lace that turns into some small chunks. Aroma involves hints of caramel malts enveloped by the citrusy hops. Nothing over the top here, but its definitely not a mild ale, and the hops actually seem to be a bit more prevalent than a regular APA. Begin soap box. It's no thing though, as people can get a little caught up in that stuff and forget about the beer itself. End soap box. Tastes of more citrus hops (slightly sour grapefruit and orange zest) with some chalkiness going down. The malts hover underneath, and perform their balancing duties well. Mouth-feel is light to medium. Carbonation is active and prolific. Not the tastiest APA I've had, but its a good drinker with just enough of everything to make it interesting."
"pour is light. a golden color with a small head. nose is similar to the alpha king but well... mild. a light grapefruit and lemon. palate is a bit sweeter. a very mild grapefruit bitter. not bad but in the face of alpha king... a bit to simple sweet. let it warm up to see if i can get some different esters out of the glass. smell is quite boozy. actually tasted somewhat stale rotten. doesn't seem to have as good a consistency but markets well for the not alpha king chicago."
"overall a nice offering from FFF...my first but not my last"
"D: With the low ABV, I could have several of these without any problem. Very nice beer"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my shaker glass. My eyes are greeted with a cloudy muted orange colored ale with around an inch of fluffy off white foam. The head leaves a minimal lacing on my glass. A nice looking pour. Smells of sweet biscuits, mild tropical fruit notes, lightly toasted and caramelized grains, and a touch of orange and lemon. This APA is medium bodied and amply carbonated for the style. High drinkability and packed with flavor for such a sessionable ale."
"Nicely drinkable. A nice, fresh example would be a good half point higher in taste, small, and drinkability, I imagine. Maybe mouthfeel as well."
"I have to say this is my favorite session beer. I can drink this all day no problem, except the fact that we cant get it in Texas. I first had this at McNivan's in Indy. They call it a mild but it really is a great pale ale. So lets get to the beer. It pours a nice orange gold. Hops and malt in the aroma. Boy does this beer go down smooth. Citrus flavors in the middle and ends smooth with a light bitter taste. Did I mention I love this beer? My second favorite Three floyds beer after Dreadnaught. Texas needs this now, pronto, among other beers."
"Pours a clear, clean amber with head that persists and laces the glass. Nice hops up front but falls off the back of the tongue leaving a really dry, clean finish. Delicious! Reminiscent of a dry saison or belgian style with the way it's hopped and finished."
"The first in last night's line-up of Three Floyds, thanks to alleykatking for swinging the deal. Very impressed with my first try at FFF, even if it is ""only"" a mild ale. I honestly wish there were more brews like this out there and readily available. Light amber in appearance with a nice head. Just enough hops here to keep you interested while keeping perfect balance. The bitterness from the hops is more dusty, spicy, and earthy rather than the typical American citrus hop flavor, though you can tell there is still a nice state-side influence on what is typically an English beer style. I'm guessing they used some noble hop varieties for this one, Saaz or Hallertauer or something. Very nice beer, very drinkable. Wish it were distributed out here."
"*Keep in mind a true mild should be gentle, sweetish and certainly not intensely bitter."
"From my initial sips, I did not love this beer. However, in the end it grew on me and I really ended up enjoying it. Bet this would be really solid on draft..."
"Fruity aroma, rather intense citrus smells mixed in with hops; pale amber in colour that is slightly hazy; has the right kind of balance between fruity elements (mainly citrus, although I would err on the side of suggesting that it is more in line with berries) and bitterness; fresh aftertaste; smooth."
"D: easy drinker. quite refreshing. For an everyday drinker, this beer offers a lot more in aroma and flavor then the typical beer."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: This beer creates a fantastic balance of bold aroma and flavor with a light, pleasant and clean body. It is amazingly drinkable and an awesome interpretation of the American session beer."
"D - Full flavor and light mouthfeel. I could drink this all night. There is no doubt, this is a highly sessionable ale. I really wish this was available in Texas."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a deep but bright golden color with pillowy off white head that fills the glass to the top. Smell is very citrusy upon pouring the beer but mellows out so you can smell the malts too. Taste is fairly mellow and very balanced. Citrus hops upfront blend seemlessly into a malt backbone with a very slight piney finish. Light mouthfeel with a surprisingly wet body. This would be a great summer session brew. Drinkability is great on this one. I can see myself buying this often as a beer that would pair great with BBQs, golf, and anything else you'd want a good sessionable beer for. Three Floyds has yet to let me down. Simply put another great offering from FFF."
"D - goes down easy and would probably session well in warm weather months."
"overall i love this mild ale. it is the perfect summer beer. who needs macro lagers and pilsners for mowing the grass? ball hard and drink FFF instead."
"A light hazy copper color with a medium foamy white head that stuck around a bit and left some good lacing. Aroma is of juicy spicy citrus hops with a hint at the toasted malt,very nice.Flavor is really interesting,a nice light crisp,bright citrus hoppy falvor that leads to a slightly sweet toasted caramel malt flavor that leads to a bright hoppy finish,with slight floral and spice notes. A crisp lively mouthfeel,every so slightly bitter. A very nice beer,very enjoyable."
"Drinkability is moderate. The beer is not offensive, but certainly uninspired. A decent pale ale, perhaps. A decent mild (as the bottle indicates), not really. I suppose it's alright though, but it just leaves me wanting so much more. I think I'd get frustrated drinking more than one of these."
"D - Smooth and good balance of flavors makes this easy to drink."
"Great brew, this would be awsome on a hot summer day."
"Light amber with a nice white head that quickly settles to a skim of foam. Decent fine lacing all down the glass. Smell is of fresh floral hops and fresh bready yeast. Tastes much like the aroma, beautiful balance between hops and caramel malt. Light mouthfeel, highly drinkable."
"I think if the BJCP added an ""American Mild"" category, this would be a forerunner. Quite sessionable, I could drink these all night, though pausing after almost every sip to reflect upon the balance and goodness. What else can you ask for in a session beer (besides price reduction? lol)"
"The taste is delightful, and very light but not a standout. Good malt backbone, and good citrus hops give off a very nice lemon taste. This beer is simple, yet a good and easy drink."
"This is very ""sessionable"". It says on label ""mild ale", and might reflect in drinkability, but don't think ""English"" more ""mild APA"" - but fits very well for that. A very good easy drink that is well-hopped, for a ""mild""!"
"Will have again at 3 Floyds."
"Really easy to drink, a great session beer in imo."
"Overall an excellent beer with no major flaws."
"Taste is smooth with a light hop and a smooth malt. Definitly a very mild APA. Goes down very smooth and would be great for a session, or a warmer weather beer. Reminds me of a Blvd. PA."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and lively with carbonation."
"Overall a very well done beer, well balanced in almost every way."
"D: Good drinkability and one that is light and mild enough to be enjoyed as a session without being overwhelmed. A clean finish highlights this drink."
"Drinkability is good. Tasty little beer that is really easy to drink. Certainly would be a nice session beer. Just wish this had a better mouthfeel."
"Three Floyds classifies this beer as a mild ale yet it is listed on Beeradvocate as a pale ale. Interesting. As a mild ale, it is quite a hoppy and flavorful rendition, but as a pale ale it is a bit thin on both flavor and mouthfeel. If given a choice, I would unquestionable reach for the ""other"" Three Floyds pale ale."
"This is my favorite American Pale Ale to date. Simply amazing for it's style."
"Maybe more of an American version of an English Mild. The %ABV is a little high as well, but definitely sessionable. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Like a baby Alpha King, this one. A solid and drinkable if not mindblowing beer with a very reasonable abv%, I can see putting away a sixer of this one on the patio on a warm spring day fairly easily, if: a) I had a patio, or; b) I lived anywhere where 3Fs was distributed. As neither of those are true, I'm going to just have to say that this is a very drinkable ale, with a nice array of balanced flavors - nothing over the top about this beer from a brewery known for going over the top. Recommended."
"Good hopped taste, blending well with the malt, with the hops somewhat in control of the flavor-, with a rather sour finish--well done. Good mouthfeel, creamy with a slightly bitter bite from the hops. Yet this is really more smooth. This is just as advertised--a session brew, one easy to down (and I had three after dinner while playing board games with the family). Just an excellent APA. Session the living hell out of this."
"D_An interesting pale ale to say the least. I really have not come across a hop character so lemony. It manages to push across some big flavours without relying on alcohol strength."
"Overal, this is a pretty good drinker: a solid, not-too-complex beer."
"D: What happened to my glass, it was full a minute ago. Too bad this is as big as a Bud heavy. Is bud a session beer, i forget? does a session beer equate to a ""pounding""/ chugfest beer. I mean I suppose any beer could be chugged if you had the will power, but I digress."
"D: A curious beer for sure. Not a mild ale but not quite an APA either. Kinda IPAish but not quite. This isn't my favorite style of beer and fruity is certainly not my favorite taste profile but having said that, I found myself downing 3 of these suckers tonight and enjoyed them. Can I hear someone say session beer? You can't deny that 3F brew a fine beer."
"Drinkability & Mouthfeel: Very good beer overall. Feels light in the mouth and the carbonation is very light."
"D- The sweetness is why I gave it an avg drinkability. This one needs to be nurtured and for me was just a little on the harder side to drink because of the sweetness. Gave it avg because I figured it could just be me"
"D-An English mild turned on it's head by being hop forward! Nothing surprising here since it's made by the hop crazed brewers that reside at FFF. A hoppy, ""low"" ABV ""American"" mild...sure bring it on! Refreshing, flavourful and drinkable session beers ROCK!"
"D--For a beer of substance? Yes. But with the wacky, uncompromising ingredient composition of the 3 Floyds Boys, I could see this giving me a surprise hangover as other of their beers have in the past"
"Your comment length must be between 250 and 5000 characters"
"Drinkability: SO GREAT! I could drink this all day. A session beer for people who like good beer. I couldn't ask for much more (but please start distributing again in Ohio)."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very crisp and clean. A touch too much carbonation but overall a very good feel."
"Pours a amberish orange in color. Decent head forms on the pour. Smell is light malts and just a hint of the FFF hopping. Not a whole lot of the hops coming through in the taste. The malts and a bit of caramel/toffee as well. Decent mild and easy drinking."
"D: Its a decent beer for everyday use, but I prefer Alpha King over this one."
"D: Solid session beer, goes down very easily and the mild kick leaves you safe having several. Unfortunately, I cant get several out here but if I could I surely would. Another FFF winner."
"The body is light to moderate. A good balance with some sweetness. Good carbonation. Overall I think that this is under rated for an APA. A great beer and easy to drink. Yummy"
"Poured to a two fingered offwhite head. Head settled to about 1/8 inch and hung around the rest of the glass. Had some good lacing that lefts its mark with every swallow. Ale was brownish yellow in color. Smelled of pine, citrus, and malt. Tasted of hopped pine and citrus. Had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth. May of had too much carbonation. When opened foam from the ale came out of the bottle. I dont see that happening very often. All and all a very good ale. Glass was trashed at the end of a couple of these. Thats what I want to see. At the end of the glass, there was still some nice foam at the bottom."
"Pours a clean orange-ish copper color with a white head. In the aroma, citrus, grapefruity hops. In the taste, citrus/ grapefruity hops and a small sweet malt. A small hop, but mainly smooth and medium mouthfeel, with a semi dry, grapefruity hop in the aftertaste. Big hops for a session, nice and easy."
"It's the little brother of Alpha King - and just as sessionable. Very solid beer to begin converting someone into a hophead."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It smells great and tastes great. I could very easily drink lots of these."
"An beer that is easy to drip down the hatch. The color is a light tan-orange and looks slightly clear. The aroma has little distinct notes and leaves a little to be desired. This beer's flavor is very subtle and balanced. The light texture makes it easy to drink but does not have a major impact with mouthfeel. Overall, a good beer to have more than one of."
"D- meh, overall i wasnt impressed. it wasnt that i disliked it, i just had higher hopes from a three floyds beer. ill try it again it i can find it on tap, but not until then"
"And then, for just a sec, as I was listening to some bluegrass the folks were playing there... If this is somewhere between the session mild and the hoppy crazy APA, how awesome is that? How easy to drink, yet supremely enjoyable? I approve!"
"Pours a bright, slightly hazy golden orange with a very small bubbly head that subsides quickly to a ring leaving a bit of lacing. The smell is a nice balace of hops, citrus and floral, and a bready malt backbone. The taste is initially a blast of light citrus, mainly lemon zest and oranges. This gives way to some caramel and sweet bready malts before a slight hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is super refreshing with a very crisp, clean finish. This is a supremely drinkable and well-balanced pale ale and would make a good summer staple."
"More sips in and I'm finding this very drinkable and quite tasty. The mouthfeel is a little thin but not too thin, and the carbonation, I think, is on the light side. Nice piney/citric finish that leaves a pleasing aftertaste. Quite good stuff and like I said, easy drinking and the head retention and lacing were more than adequate. Very nice brew overall and 1 that I'll enjoy again because I have 2 more bottles, thanks to Jeff. ;^)"
"Received as a very generous extra from bgramer (thanks Brendan). Poured a translucent copper/amber with a dense, off-white head. Good head retention that eventually settled into a quarter-inch, consistent cap. Bands of sticky, concentric half moon rings of lacing present during the session. Scent of hops and a mild citrus essence. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a light biscuity quality. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a slight burn across the tip of the tongue and some hops bitterness at the back. Nice brew. Actually reminded me of a more subdued version of Roxy Rolles."
"This beer pours a nice cloudy amber. The majority of the smell seems to be citrus. The taste is nice with a mixture of citrus and malts. The ale seems a little over carbonated for my taste, not the most pleasant mouthfeel. Minus the carbonation and this would be an extremely drinkable beer. Overall though a very nice mixture of flavors and something I will certainly drink again"
"Recommended."
"D: Very drinkable and tasty enough to keep you interested. Hopefully FFF comes back to Ohio so I can take this tailgating and whatnot."
"Okay, but a bit strange. It's not a strong flavored beer, and while it's not simple, nothing about it really stands out. Now, if this was six or seven bucks a six pack I'd get it all the time, but I have a hunch it isn't. Its drinkability is its best characteristic. A"
"Drinkability - A well crafted masterpiece of a mild ale. It has wonderful balance and such an array of flavors for a beer of this type. I can't say enough about 3FFF's! Their beers are always of the highest caliber, and are friggin delicious. I could drink this beer any time of day, and any time of year."
"Best session beer ever... seriously"
"D: This would make a great hot weather (beach?) beer or a great introduction to the style for someone who is still afraid of killer hop bitterness. A good beer to use if you want to wean someone off of Miller beers."
"Update: Been drinking this fairly regularly. I now call it Dreadnaught Lite"
"Poured a deep amber with a bone white head that slowly dissipated into a thin white ring. Smelled great, lots of hops and citrus notes that give way to a freshly baked bread aroma. Taste like an IPA but with a little more malt. Crisp and refreshing with a hops note that disappears as quick as the swallow. Good, clean mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Could drink several over a night at the lake or sitting on the back porch on a warm Alabama night."
"D: Excellent drinkability! It's been years since I've had this and I'd forgotten how tasty and sessionable this beer is. Perfect for the summer."
"drinkability : I could definitely drink quite a few of these. If it was readily available to me this would be one of my goto beers."
"Notes: Thanks to Dyan for this one. I could get used to drinking this FFF stuff."
"D: This is now my favorite ""mild ale."" It is so damn drinkable that I have vowed to stop drinking water from now on. I am not going to file a BeerSpy report. Just stay the hell away from this beer!"
"D: Oh boy, I'm glad I have another 3 of these puppies!"
"D- a really nice beer. makes me want to make a mild so that i can enjoy something like this more often. prolly be a good dry hop fix in these rough times if all you want is a nice dry hop scent and juiciness"
"Nearly gushes from the bottle pouring a clear, medium amber/caramel color and massive off-white head. Aromas are characteristic FFF, lots of citrusy, resiny hops. A bit of toasty malts are noted, not quite biscuity, but with a caramel like toasted character. On the palate, the hops have nearly dissapeared, and the malts, while not overly characterful like they should be in a mild, take the bulk of the flavor. Interestingly, this beer is WAY over carbonated to giving you quite a bite and drying the finish out too much. I don't think it's infected, but there's something seriously wrong with the carbonation level. Given that, it really hurts the drinkability."
"Deep orangey-gold, fuzzy orange tinted lid. Sweet, fresh, orangey-grapefruit citrus hoppy nose. Lightly toasted grains with light, fresh earth bitterness and peppery spice flavors. Piney as well, with a light body and oily smooth and creamy-crunchy mouthfeel. Very nice, light, flavorful, sessionable ale."
"D- A very drinkable brew. At first I wasn't sure but this one grew on me big time."
"We had this from the cask at cellar temperature at the Map Room; not even at the FFF have we had this version. It is a pale chestnut color, with very little head - not surprising really. Aroma was very muted. To my mind the beer was veering towards oxidation, there was a hint of flatness about the taste. Surrounded by a endless high-alcohol beers it can be something of a relief to drink a lighter style. This is redolent of a ligher English bitter, muted hop bitterness and quite dry. It is very accessible and drinkable even if it doesn't leave a pronounced mark."
"D- A very crisp and refreshing beer. Would be nice on a summer day. Very sessionable."
" Alpha kings little brother, hard not to drink alot of these!."
"Hazy light amber color with golden-copper hues. Fluffy white head becomes off-white as it dissipates. How strange. Aromas of leafy hops, wood oil/ sap, fresh dough and biscuit dough. The flavors reprise the aroma with the addition of marmalade and a hint of caramel malt. Just a tad lighter than medium body. Finish of yeast, dough, and citrus peel. It's funny how an American interpretation of a British Mild comes out as a standard profile for an American Pale Ale. A damn good one though."
"All-in-all a tasty, easy to drink, sessionable beer that I'd love to have again."
"Another mild beer based on the english style. A nice refreshing change to the bigger beers I've been drinking lately."
"Cloudy orange honey colored with a soapy sudsy head. Smell is uniquesly fruity. Tangerine strikes me most. Very fresh smelling but slighty subdued strengthed nose overall. Taste has hints of orange with mild bittersweet hops. Quite carbonated, but the body is a bit thin to go along and resultedy tastes a bit weak and slightly bland. What flavor there is, is nice and is unique as far as ambers go. Good effort, and I wouldnt mind trying a bottle of this that I knew for a fact was fresh."
"I wouldn't change anything about this beer, except that I would increase its availability in the Washington, D.C. area."
"Thanks to Sephiroth for the FFF beers!!! Anyhoo- pours a nice hazy orange with with a thick cream colored head. Sweet citrus/tropical fruit aromas are abundant. Nice crisp mouthfeel is followed by a sweet, light citrus type hop flavor that gets balanced out by a malty finishing kick. The flavor is pretty crisp and clean, though. This may be one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. I want more!!!"
"Nice."
"The first 6-pk I tried was very foamy - excessively so. I assumed this was not typical so sometime later I bought a second 6 but with the same results - explosively foamy. I like plenty of head so this is an odd complaint for me. Retention was poor, smell and taste average at best. Mouthfeel is somewhat this and watery in my opinion. American Pale Ale, IPA and Imperial stouts are my favourite styles - there are much better APA's to choose from."
"If it were not for that funky smell this beer would have gotten a fantastic review. But I just could not get past it."
"Thanks, joe1510, for the chance to re-visit this in the bottle"
"D - I wish that this was available here. Seems like it would make a great session beer. Having to trade for it basically makes that impossible though... Let me know if you have a case you want to get rid of :-)"
"Drinkability is high and in the session range at 5%abv. This is a classic APA (more so that the more hop-forward Alpha King APA) with great malt presence and no noticeable alcohol in the body, another great beer from FFF"
"Not Three Floyds' best but still not a bad beer, would drink again but a six pack probably would only cost three dollars more than one bottle does here in California, recommended for fans of easy to drink pale ales"
"slightly hazy light amber/orange. white head with okay retention and lace. nose was light hops and malt. orangy w/ faint sweet bread. taste was a well balanced malt/hop mesh with a medium body and a slight slight bitter finish. i could drink this beer all day and all night. it goes really well with tons of foods. a really exceptional session beer. i've got to give it to these guys, and i'm sure they hear it all the time, but they make fantastic beers. i hope they never get too big for their britches like a lot of other brewers, but i hope they start sending their stuff to the east coast as well. gogo 3fs!!!"
"Pride & Joy is another good beer from Three Floyds. Although Alpha King is what I usually pick up in 6-pack form Pride & Joy is more on the sessionable side and enjoyable as well. Three Floyds does some good things when it comes to hops."
"Just noticed that this beer has an IBU rating of 29. I find this fascinating because I perceive it as being more bitter than DIPA's with five times the IBU rating"
"This beer has been one of my favorites forever. Nice copper orange color, nice 2 finger head. Smells- citrusy, tastes- excellent balance of hops and malt. Nice and bitter but citrusy as well as malty. Have also had it on draft at the brew pub, great beer all around."
"Pours a nice light amber color with fantastic head and lacing. It has an excellent hoppy and slightly floral scent. Absolutely wonderful taste, a great pale ale that has an excellent hoppy taste, with some nice butterscotch tones, which is followed by a very mellow bitter aftertaste. Goes down fine, maybe just a bit too much carbonation for my tastes. All in all, though, another excellent winner from 3F."
"Pours golden/orange amber. Nose is strong pine hops. Flavor is just the same. Bitter salty hops that stay consistent, but aren't so salty that it just messes the whole experience up. Feel has a good carbonation to it. Nice liquid feel. Overall a good drink. The salt could stand to be a wee bit lower I think, but still a good brew."
"Mellow and crisp with moderate carbonation and a clean finish. Very well balanced and slick/juicy in texture. Refreshing with a bit of lingering bitterness from the hops. One of the most well balanced and underrated APAs out there in my opinion. Also one of the best session beers I can think of due to its lower ABV and flavorful, well balanced nature."
"Drinkability: Though light in alcohol, it's anything but mild. Nicely flavorful with a high drinkability."
"D - Good beer."
"Drinkability: Good smooth beer with a low ABV. This is not a big beer and is a welcome change from some of the overpowering beers that are out there. You would be able to have several of these in an evening if you desired and not feel the affects. Good session beer."
"D-Though all the excitement of this one is in the nose this is a nice, drinkable ale. It is quite mild which makes it much easier to drink or even session. I'll pick up this one again-if I ever find FFF again."
"pours golden with a large creme head on top. almost the same color as gumballhead, but maybe a slight bit more orange. could use some more carbonation. taste has some good citrus stuff happening and goes down pretty smooth. after a few minutes the head dissipates. goes pretty well with a mesquite turkey, bacon, cheddar, gouda, and dill pickle sandwich and some creedence. a decent beer, but one of the weaker three floyds beers. the gumballhead is better in every way except for the head."
"D: Rather dry but this beer is really refreshing and the spicy bitterness is awesome."
"Pours a foggy rich amber hue with a chunky two finger off-white head that dies down to almost nothing. But it doesn't disappear without leaving its mark on the sides of the glass. Smell is interesting. Kind of musty earth hop aroma with a strange malt scent blended in. Light citrus is hidden in the nose as well. Good caramel malt presence up front on the tongue. A mild citrus sweetness arises midway and contributes to the lemongrass aftertaste. Close to a medium body with an aggressive carbonation. Nothing special, but a good one to experience."
"Hazy light brown color with a nice tan head. The nose was of citrus hops and sweet malts. The taste is also of citrus and floral hops with sugary malts. Some earthy tones keep it fairly mild. Crisp and refreshing medium body. Good example of an American mild ale. Hoppy, but in good balance. Very Drinkable."
"drinkability is good. very well balanced, with almost no trace of the alcohol in the flavour. nice balance between the hops and malt. great depth to the hops too keeping things interesting. this one seems like it'd be fantastic on cask."
"Definitely recommended."
"Wow, very solid offering and my first (of hopefully many) 3F's offerings. The color is a dull gold with a bit of copper mixed in, cloudy from the yeast sediment (which i don't mind at all--bring on the B-complex vitamins). The smell is mostly fruity hops with some caramel malt and maybe a bit of biscuit (?). The taste is hops with the malt there in the back doesn't doesn't really break through. Mouthfeel is medium to low with some lively carbonation. My only complaint is that there is perhaps a bit too much carbonation, but not much. Drinkability is pretty awesome, I love this as a session beer, a great APA, not even close to a mild, though, but who cares. I guess it just counts as a mild next to their other ri-di-diculous brews."
"Man, that's a good beer! Sessionable, flavorful, characterful. But aren't Mild's (as the bottle suggests) supposed to be a light Brown Ale? This beer is far from being a mild, but would make a great Extra Pale Ale. Somewhere between a copper and golden color with a thin stark-white head formation and retention. The flavors are dominated by an English hop aroma (earthy, grassy) and with a medium malt character that struggles to counter the hops. The malt flavors take on Vienna-type flavors and come across pleasant and light. Body is quite light, slight of thin, but make the beer very easy to drink. finishes with a light caramel taste and strong hop bittering. Good stuff again by Three Floyds."
"Man, we need some Three Floyds distribution in MN, please."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is yet another very good beer from 3F. I could certainly see myself drinking several of these in an evening. The biggest thing that would keep me from selecting this beer if it ever comes back to my area is that I would prefer Alpha King above it and any place around here that would have Pride & Joy would most likely have Alpha King as well."
"Pour is a foggy orange color with a nice fluffy finger of head that takes it's time disappearing. Nose is like some crazy fruity, candy extravaganza. A mix of fruity hops and sweet caramel. Delicious aromas. Taste is fairly similar. Fruity hops segue nicely into delicious candy malt. Lighter hops show up at the back end. That hoppy bitterness increases a touch as the beer goes on. Medium, almost creamy body to this one with excellent carbonation. I really liked this one a lot. My first Three Floyds, and one I'd have again, except for if the Alpha King was available."
"Flavor mainly with citrusy hops, a bit of malt sweetness. Well balanced, not at all overly hopped. It's slightly dry but no in a bad way. This is a great session brew, and if it's ever available in Missouri I will make sure to keep my fridge stock with a few sixers of Pride & Joy!"
"High on the drinkability curve."
"Pours a golden hue with an aggressively rapid forming, rapid descending two fingers of foam. Aromas of grassy, pine, grapefruit, lemon hops as well as caramel and lightly toasted malts. The taste is sweet upfront with some biscuit malts, and some pine and citrus flavored hops in the finish. Good carbonation and medium mouthfeel, very good mild ale that one could drink a few of in a row."
"Large, tight foam with a fair amount of staying power. Clear, nicely carbonated russett appearance. I love the floral aromatics that beckon me to take large pulls. Bitter and not as tasty as it smells, it is a solid APA. Medium-bodied, this almost has a bit too much of a soapy finish, but it easy drinking nonetheless. This is a beer for those of us who like the tongue to be challenged by flavor, but not have our asses kicked with alcohol. Recommended."
"Drinkability- Great! This beer is absolutely fantastic. I think it borders on the APA/IPA borderline but I would take it over either almost every time. So hoppy, so balance, so terrific."
"D-Extremely drinkable. Great bear, and a fine welcome to the Midwest."
"All hail the men and women of 3 Floyd's. This truly should be one of their pride and joy's."
"To me, this is one of the better 3 floyds offerings. I like hops and all, but their brews often take it to the extreme. This one is more middle of the road."
"Recommended. I was expecting a boring beer, but this definitely delivered a nice session beer."
"On tap at the brewery in Munster. Nice golden color with a small but long-lasting head. Great citrus hop aroma. Nice white-bread malt flavor and hop bitterness playing off each other. Nice balance. A crisp, medium body that would have worked well into a long session if I didn't have to get back on the road fairly quickly. This is proof that a beer doesn't have to be ""extreme"" to be well done and noticeably so."
"This actually reminded me of a muted version of the FFF Alpha King, which I really enjoyed. Although not as good, FFF did not disappoint with this beer."
"Overall I was very much impressed here. It just was soo smooth and light you could drink it forever and not even know. If I was around it more it would stock my fridge constantly.Just a good, no, great beer."
" I avoided this beer for quite some time because I assumed it would be overly malty like English milds tend to be. I should have known better, this is an American interpretation. Excellent session beer for the warm weather with low alcohol. Unfortunately, no freshness date on bottle. I highly recommend this one."
"D: An amazingly drinkable ale, a great session beer, it would be, if it wasn't so expensive and hard to find in my area. All-around, a great smaller beer from 3 Floyds, they continue to amaze; now only if I could get my hands on that elusive Dark Lord..."
"pours hazy golden color with a massive white foam head. In fact I think the head is still forming. I'm lucky the beer did not foam over. I had to repour several times because of the continuously mounting head. Smell is citrus and hoppy, but not as much as Alpha King. Taste is citrus and hoppy, with a slight alcohol taste. Limited carbonation in this one. A very good sessionable beer, and not as powerful as Alpha King. A nice beer from Three Floyds."
"Can't really say that I've really been a big English Dark Mild Ale drinker and thus have a basis for comparison... but as I began, I don't think one would recognize this beer as of style.... but I don't hold their phenomenal Gumballhead against them because they decided to play with hops, so I don't here, either. Would gladly quaff a pint from the tap, but with that much hop flavor there's something about a bracing bitter edge (not necessarily a big one...) that is appealing, and I'd rather reach for a beer that has one if I'm looking for this much hop flavor."
"It smells like a sticky malt and nicely balanced soft pine aroma. Medium bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated and smooth. The flavor and the smell are quite similar. Sweet and full flavored with a hint of lemon that i missed in the nose. Quite drinkable and at <5% ABV is a real good session beer. Really enjoyed this one."
"Got as an extra in trade with czoch75 - thanks! Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating info into a pint glass. Was a hazy golden color with little bits of yeast floating around. Had a good head that settled into a wispy film. A little lacing. The aroma was citric hops with malts in the back. I agree with others that it reminds you more of a pale ale than a mild ale. The taste was pretty good and tastes like a slightly watered down pale ale. It doesn't have a real standout taste but is a good session beer when you want a little more flavor than a standard session. Mouthfeel was light and carby - good mix. Overall, a good average beer that is worth trying. Not avail here so won't be a player in my rotation. But if avail, it would be worth a 6ixer or two every year for variety. (3.5, RB, T, Y)"
"Finally the drinkability. This is an outstanding ale that deserves nothing less than exceptional status. It is very pleasing indeed and to say ""Thank you, Sir. May I have another?"" would not do it credit. Pride and Joy lives up to it's name. Well done Three Floyds!"
"Outstanding pale ale, if judged for truth to style I would be forced to give terrible marks, but judged on merit and flavor, a terrific and sessionable mild ale that brings the hops without any negative aftertaste. My addiction to hops notwithstanding, nearly anyone who has tasted this one can agree that this one tastes amazing. Truly the Alpha King's pale ale kin, without the American pale ale stigma."
"D: I guess I could drink a lot of these, but would prefer the company of better pale ales."
"Taste is very mellow, with some bready notes holding up the vanilla. Citrus and floral hops with a little bit of pine in there as well, liquorice, herbal. Mandarin orange and a little lemon sourness to round it off. More complex than the average ""Mild Ale"". Mouthfeel is fairly thin, and carbonation isn't overbearing in the mouth. Slightly drying finish, but not extremely so. This is drinkable to a T. My final verdict on this is that it's much like a watered down Alpha King, it has a lot of the same flavours, but they're much more muted. A well made ale, but it dosen't take it to the next level. That's what the rest of the Three Floyds lineup is for."
"On tap, served in a pint glass. FFFs version of a session beer. Pours a nice dark golden color with a little haziness. Still has the great hop aroma you have come to expect. Extremely drinkable. Aromas of very light hops and some citrus. Light body with a very quick bitter finish. Nice lightly smokey, hoppy finish. A nice little beer from Three Floyds."
"d - 3F never disappoints and this was a nice brew. not familiar with the style but i never would have guessed english dark mild ale for this one."
"Overall, this is a good session beer. Milds are typically not my favorite style, but this would be good for a long poker night when you don't want to get too loaded."
"Overall an excellent and supremely drinkable ale. From what I read, not a traditional mild ale, but who cares. This may very well be one of those desert island beers. I only wish I had access. Thanks to czoch75."
"Taste is bitter, hoppy and fruity with citric and resinous, earthy notes. There is a light malt backbone, but that is pushed away by the hops and body is quite thin. The beer is very dry, which make the beer appear even more bitter. The carbonation is smooth, little gas bubbles feel nice on the tongue. In the end I get some sort of sweetness, although the beer is dry."
"It is evident that they didn't add alot of malt to the bill from the sheer carbonation. The CO2 throat burn cuts the drinkabliity back a hair. Like I said, they pulled it off with a hop-bomb. Definately recommended. Cheers!"
"Pours a slightly hazed amber/copper, thick white head forms, nice lacing, decent retention. Smell is sweet, caramel malt, almost jasmine, pine/citrus, some floral, light, nice balance. Taste is smooth, toffee, some grain, bready malt, and citrus, some floral nice bitterness and perfect balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very smooth and a perfect example of a sub 5% beer that is full of flavour and very drinkable. Thanks Josh!"
"Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy amber/orange color with a half-inch white head. Lacing is OK. It smells mostly like citrusy (grapefruit) hops and lemon peel. It tastes like citrusy hops and toasted malt. Mouthfeel is light/medium, and also smooth and a bit slick. Drinkability is good, with a crisp finish. It seems a bit too hoppy for a mild ale, but this is a Three Floyds beer so I'm not surprised at all. It's good, tasty and sessionable. I think this is a good solid beer, I'd definitely drink it again."
"I think this is a really nice beer. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The appearance a nice amber color, with two fingers of foam. The foam was mainly micro, with a few larger, but a good head non the less. The smell had hints of pine, but is faint at best. The taste is remarkable. Sparkles on the tongue throughout each sip. Very similar to a single orgin coffee from El Salvador. The citrus resembles more of a quaint grapefruit or a tangerine than a lemon, but really sizzles on the tongue. The glass looks great throughout drinking. Bubbles from the bottom, and lacing continues until the end. I really like this beer. I have been liking a lot of area beers lately. Three Floyds and Two Brothers are two of the best brewers I have found in a while."
"This would make an excellent refreshing summer session beer. Watery yet dry, with nicely balanced malt and hop flavour. A tasty and refershing approachable yet interesting brew. Wish i had more."
"Pride & Joy poured a golden orange color with a slight tint of amber to it. It had half an inch in height head of white fizzy bubbles that quickly fizzled away into in to a few clear bubbles along the edge of the beer and no lace around the glass. Not even white bubbles acting as the lace. That would have been better than nothing at all. Very disappointing appearance. The smell was no better than the appearance. To get the slightest aroma to emerge, I had to swirl the beer around for a couple of minutes for anything to come out. Even then it wasn't that good. The aroma was that of citrus hops, a lemon peel, toasted malts, and a pinch of English toffee in the back. To get a whiff of the toffee, you really need to stick your nose into it and even then you might not catch it. Where it matters most of all is where this beer finally came out. The taste was mild and slightly dry with a slice of grapefruit, toasted malts, a few more citrus fruits, and with a mild punch of bitter citrus hops in the background. The mouthfeel was light, but yet it had a nice aftertaste of dry roasted bitter citrus hops. I noticed that toward the end of the mouthfeel, it got somewhat watery. Not too watery, but I still noticed it was there. They label this as a ""classic session ale."" I guess you could make this a reasonably priced Three Floyds session ale, but I wouldn't. I didn't care for it that much. A Three Floyds beer that can be easily passed up for some of their other offerings."
"This is called a mild ale but is similar to a lot of IPAs I've had. Drink up!"
"update: have had this many times since. i wish they made this a seasonal (less of it) so they could make more of other stuff like zombie dust. not one of their better offerings."
"I poured this slightly aged with very little head and almost no lace. Clear, amber color tinged with brown. Aroma is a fruity hoppiness with some hints of citrus, some maltiness. the body is a bit thin, but certainly very drinkable. Flavor's about the same as aroma, just more intense. Relatively short hoppy finish."
"Sort of pale ale like in taste and smell. A little bit maltier and much more balanced than an average pale ale though. This beer is very very easy to drink, due to its crazy balance. I can't stop sipping this beer. Go and try it, but expect more of a pale ale than a mild. Sort of mislabeled."
"D: The beer is very inviting, showing off a bit of a hop bite that never overpowers the delicate malt body."
"Poured into a glass pours a hazy orange with a littl ehead and no lace. Smell is big and hoppy floral and citrus hops come to mind. Taste is amzing for the strong smell of hops this brew is kind of soft and mellow with big carbonation and little bitterness, awesome offering from the floyds highly recommended."
"Drinkability is good make one hell of a warm summer brew, as far as true to style would hardly call it lightly hoppy, except for a FFF brew anyway. Very enjoyable would probably rate higher but can't get over the style its stuck in. Thanks go to merlin48 for this fine sample."
"Pours a sunny amber orange with a pleasant eggshell head with some lacing after each sip. Plus a few jubilant bubbles rising to the top rounded out this beer nicely. The aroma was of fresh pine, flower stems, medium citrus, and some toasty malts. The taste was a perfect reflection of the aroma. Sprucey hops with some citrus in the middle mixed with the toasted wheat bread in the middle and finished with the floral, spicey hops. Medium bitterness and very crisp and refreshing. Great after owrk beer. Very sessionable. Probably my favorite English dark mild ale."
"Pours a nice orange. Very big hops/citrus aroma. Taste is primarily pine resin with much less citrus than in the aroma. Hops give nice bitterness and a bit of pucker. Body is rather thin, which is okay at this ABV. Nice lighter alternative to Alpha King."
"Very citrusy, hoppy, and pleasant aroma. Orange hue. Initially stong hop bitterness, quickly smoothed out by a nice citrusy and malty flavor, which dissipates quickly. I could drink this beer just for the aroma alone, but I'm also encouraged by its flavor."
"Overall, an excellent beer. I'll try this one again."
"Very drinkable, a little heavy to be a lawnmower ale. More suited for the fall."
"jeez, 3F's knows what there doing when they use hops"
"A solid warm weather beer for those who enjoy hops."
"Cheers!"
"A light amber color with a thin off white colored head, that dissolves quickly and leaves a slight film on top. The aroma starts witha piney, earthy scent, that mellows out to sweet malt fragrance. The flavor comes out with that malty mellow flavo, that rolls on the palate, then as it reaches the end a slight smack of bitterness, mostly citrusy, hits the palate. A thin to medium feel, leaving a dry finish. Everything about this beer makes want it to be good to great, but it does not reach that expectation. The hops seem off kilter, like it is trying to be the ant-mild mild. It is still better than alot of other beers out there."
"D - Excellent selection and makes for the perfect session beer. If I ever see a six pack, I'll definitely pick one up."
"D- An intereseting brew. I can see this being a good warm weather brew. Not the first beer I would reach for though. I'd like to see a better balance between malt and hops. The hops feel a little overpowering in this context."
"D- It isn't anything offensive but it's not trying to be. It is a very tasty easy drinking mild ale. I think they hit what they were going for."
"Poured my Pride & Joy into a pint glass. It poured to a clear brilliant amber with a lot of carbonation. The head was gone in a flash, but left some lacing. The smell hit me the second i opened the bottle, strong floral hops, something sweet in there as well. It had me taking deep wiffs with every drink. Taste was hops muted with malt, the word mild came to mind, and according to the name it should have. It finishes dry and hoppy, with a bit of alcohol. Not bad. Pretty thick and chewy, yet not over bearing, finishing dry and crisp. I plan to finish my six pack."
"This beer pours a clear, light amber with a short, rocky, white head. The foam settles quickly and shows just a little stickage. Piney hops hit the nose first, followed by light grapefruit in the background. I was initially surprised, but then I thought ""Three Floyds"" and it all made sense. There's some toasty malt there too, but it's overshadowed by the hops. Moderate bitterness with plenty of hop flavour - grassy, piney, citrusy - but it's not overwhelming, quite refreshing actually. Malt sweetness and caramel flavour is subdued and there's a bit of hop spiciness towards the end. A bit dry in the finish. Medium carbonation, decent texture. I really liked this beer. I could definitely see this as a beer I'd always keep in the fridge if I had access to it."
"Cheers!"
"not really that inspiring or in the spirit of the project. it's fizzy hop-water with some malt afterthoughts"
"D - A perfect hop popsicle for sessioning. I will buy sixers of this stuff regularly."
"The mouth is light, and seems to lack carbonation and life. It's drinkable and mild by design, and is certainly a solid session beer, but lacks the flair expected from three Floyds."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange with a decent white head. Aroma is citrusy hops mostly grapefruit. Taste is citrus up front with again grapefruit coming through. There is also a slight malty sweetness and toastiness towards the middle, then finishing off with more hops. Pretty light bodied ale. This is a very drinkable beer for sure and would make a nice session. Pretty good beer but I think this is more of an English Pale Ale, don't purchase if you want a dark mild."
"drinkability: very"
"A deep gold in color with hints of copper and a small, whitish head. Aroma is subtle, with a light blend of pilsner-like (Saaz?) and more piney (Cascade?) hops -- but a very light touch of the latter. In the mouth, the hops take a more balanced position alongside smoother light malts, which alternately bite and soothe the tongue. Insanely drinkable - even more than my go-to session beer, Sam Adams Boston Lager. This is a keeper for a lazy Spring and Summer days."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing and definitely gets some drinkability points. The friend that brought this back for me said that he tasted a soapy flavor and now that I sit here thinking about that, I get a little soapy tast as well. Good beer though and will definitely seek out again."
"Recieved this in a trade from jhammerly, thanks. Pours a dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice foamy tan 1.5 finger head, tons of nice lacing around and inside the glass. Scents of hops, citrus, grapefruit, and slight malts. The taste is hoppy, sweet/malty, with a nice bitter finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, reminds me of a IPA with a twist, way to go 3Fs."
"Medium to full bodied, a nice maltiness here to support the big ass hop flavors. So damned drinkable, if it were available here, it would always be in my fridge. Sure, it isn't a straight up mild, but it's Three Floyd's, so expect in your face flavor."
"Drinkability is good. The beer becomes slightly more interesting as it warms up."
"Buttery smooth mouthfeel really saves this brew for me, because otherwise, this one is about average. A toned down IPA, and yeah, it's not like an English mild."
"Three Floyd's least crazy beer is just plain good. Very accessible and drinkable. And still plenty hoppy."
"Extremely drinkable beer. They live up to being their self-proclaimed sessionable beer. I'd get this again in a heartbeat."
"D - Good. This would be an easy, non offensive beer to drink throughout an evening."
"Very nice fruity, spicy hop aroma. Taste is balanced, and follows the smell. Fruity, citric hops are present in just the right amount. Mild yet flavorful. Mouthfeel is spot on, vaguely carbonated, but lets the flavors take center stage. An easy drinker, and what I would consider ""training wheels"" to 3F's bigger brews. Well done!"
"i would say this is one pleasant beer...i had a chicken sandwich with it and it really worked well with it...i have nothing bad to say about this one...drinkability is great cuz its not overly strong and it has one hell of a hoppy IPA-ish flavor...a bit thin but i like it anyways...i really like this one and will be buying it again eventually"
"Got this at local liquor store, poured in to my tumbler a nice musty coppery orange. The head is not very thick or showy. It dissipates fast and lingers as a thin cloud on top. Smells of piney aromatic hops, medium sweet and bitter malts, some hints of honey, caramel, brown sugar, banana, and grapefruit. Taste is crisp with some toffee and caramel accents, and bitey grapefruit like bitterness toward the finish. The after taste is nice lingers medium long. For me this beer is an on or off beer, some times when I try to session with this it works, but then other times the balance just doesnt work for me. How ever more often than not I truly enjoy this beers fruity bitter flavor"
"This beer was more like an APA than a mild ale (according to BA descriptions)."
"A very enjoyable session beer with plenty of character. Would love as an everyday beer, but those 3F distribution issues...."
"Update: just got another batch for this year and it is a little fresher. Still dry in the finish but the citrus aspect seems a little more prominent than what I remember. So happy I was able to snag a couple cases of this before it was gone in my area."
"Totally quaffable in every sense; for my money, the classic American session mild."
"Outstanding drinkability. Technically the alcohol is slightly to high for the style but I am not complaining. This is one mild and tasty ale."
"Very, VERY sessionable."
"Opinion: This is a pretty drinkable beer. I am a little thrown off by the word mild written on the label, but that is OK because it is a good beer. I would like the carbonation to be a bit more to make it a bit more drinkable. Right now, there is a syrupy edge to it that would be minimized by increased carbonation. Other than this, it is a drinkable Pale Ale"
"D: There really isn't much mild about this beer unless you are comparing it to other 3F beers. Much closer to an American pale ale. Definately drinkable"
"Amber color with a pretty good, rocky head. Big bubbles of carbonation. Strong, citrus hop aroma with just a hint of malt. Taste is sweet, crisp with light malt, bread and hop flavor. Medium bitterness, citrus hop finish. Mouthfeel is light and clean. A great mild that makes you want to drink a ton of it."
"Thanks for the bottle, Hero27"
"D: Not a session beer to me."
"The bitterness and spice is pleasent - not overpowering."
"Poured a clear light copper color with a slight chill haze to it. Very thin off-white head that left some light lacing behind. Aroma is mostly malty; sweet doughy bread, toffee, and caramel, with some citrusy hop notes up front. The flavor is a good blend of the two. Citrus and some light pine then the toffee and bready malts come out before retreating to the hops presence again. Pretty flavorful for a mild. Good carbonation and medium body with a just touch of dry bitterness upon swallowing. ABV makes this a truly sessionable brew."
"Poured a peachy golden color with a fizzy white head that lasted nearly five minutes before giving way to lighter sticky lacing.Very active carbonation streams visible in the minimal haze. Smell is citrus and piney hops, sweet maltiness finishes out the nose. Taste is fresh and well balanced, the hops welcome you in and the caramel sweet malts round the brew out. Slightly bitter, leaves a dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, with a lighter body that goes down easy. Great drinkability,this would be a good session beer, nothing too complex, low abv and enjoyable characteristics."
"Amber color with a white head that didn't last real long, left some lacing. Juicy grapefruit and lemony hops with some pine and caramel too. Taste seemed to hit me with some caramel and pine first, before quickly changing to juicy grapefruit, and then some more pine in the finish. Taste seemed to be right around 4.25, it was close to 4.5, but not quite, so I'll give it the 4. Higher carbonation, light-medium bodied. Highly drinkable, almost hard not to have another."
"Poured a clear copper color with moderate white head. Smell is dominated by hops with only a slight malt presence to be found. Taste is also mainly hops, but the malt combines to present an enjoyable brew. The finish balances the hops and malt nicely. This was not what I was expecting. It did not taste ilke an English Dark Mild Ale, But I did enjoy it."
"Drinkability- If Dreadnaught is too much for you this is your brew, mild enough to please almost everyone, yet distinctive enough to stand out of the crowd."
"Overall, I'm a Three Floyd's fanboy, but then again...Isn't everybody these days? I was back before they were on the radar, when I could buy this beer and other Three Floyd's offerings at D'z Six Pack and Dogz in Regent Square the Swissvale neighborhood in Pittsburgh!!!"
"D: Drinkable as they come. Definitely mild and refreshing. A true session beer."
"Cloudy but vibrant medium amber with a 1 cm, slightly off-white, creamy head that quickly diminishes to a thick tenacious film. Smell is of citric hops foremost, supported by herbal tea, light grain, pear and a touch of leather. More citrus in the taste, a little stronger but still far from overpowering, accompanied by a moderate, bready malt presence. It has a medium-thin body, lightly crisp yet fairly smooth texture and soft carbonation. This beer is super easy-drinking. Enough character to keep it interesting but still remaining a great session beer. Very nicely done, one of the better mild ales out there. Thanks for the bottle, hero27!"
"Drinkability: P & J is the perfect definition of a session beer. Low abv, crisp and dry. Plenty of hoppiness in the beginning to give it plenty of flavor but not to the point where drinking a bunch of these would burn out your taste buds. Make a point to seek this out and enjoy."
"Overall a very drinkable beer that I will definitely have again."
"I like to drink this one between IPAs or stouts to ""reset"" the palate, very drinkable and tasty."
"I think when compared to some of the simply spectacular beers made by 3Floyds (e.g. dreadnaught) this beer might be something of a letdown, but to put it in perspective, if this was labeled as another brewer's product, I would make a point of trying EVERYTHING that brewery made. It is an excellent beer."
"I am glad to have this brewery close because this is a great brew to enjoy anytime."
"Medium bodied, light effervescence and a slightly dry finish give this brew a nice texture on the palate. A hoppy/floral/citrusy aftertaste completes this offering. Overall a enjoyable beer from the Floyds."
"I love this beer, I can easily down 12 of these in one night. As for the folk's that complain about it not being a true english mild, go pick up a sixer of fullers esb and have a great time. I would much rather drink this version anyday. After all, It's three floyd's meaning it's not normal, just what their six packs tell you."
"drinkability: easy to drink"
"A wonderful all-around session beer, and another winner from FFF. I can only see to get this and Robert the Bruce regularly while I'm in Des Moines this summer, so I'm sure I'll be drinking plenty of this."
"One of the most satisfying and easily drinkable beers I know. My favorite by far of the Three Floyds ""regular"" beers. As for being a ""mild"" I belive FFF are employing the old English tradition in which ""mild"" and ""bitter"" were relative terms used to describe each particular brewery's offerings. And, compared to Alpha King, this baby is mild!"
"-UF"
"Pours a nice light orange color with a little white head that drops away over time. Some citrus hops are in effect on the nose- the taste follows it with some more american citrus hops. Refreshing and not too thick on the mouth with mild carbonation. A little malt/ grain underneath it all. Overall, seems an awful lot like an APA; tasty, but not the English Dark mild I was expecting."
"This beer is a nice version of a mildly hopped APA, I don't know why it is in the english dark mild catagory. However, it is a great session brew. I plan to work this into my regular rotation for summer."
"Note this beer is supposed to be a mild ale. This is FFF and it is not normal. A great beer overall but mislabled in style."
"D - Nice and not overpowering. Could easily be a session brew, but today the alcohol hit be a little bit for some reason..."
"D - Session, session, session. Everything you'd expect from a mild, a nice pleasant flavor with some quenching capabilities and a clean finish."
"Thanks MABZ for this great beer."
"Overall a very wonderfully smelling, delicious session brew. I'll definitely have to stock up on this for grilling season. Would love to see how 'guests' react to this easygoing ale (?)."
"Drinkability - this is easy going down, and a good beer. I would have several more in any one sitting."
"Overall impression: Not all that sessionable. Not at all a Mild either. Way too overhopped. I guess I should try the bottled version to see if the hops are muted any further. Can Three Floyds make a beer without overhopping it? Not bad but it seems these are the only kinds of beers they can make. Worth a try. Got to knock off a few points just b/c it's so far off."
"This is my first beer from three floyds, provided to me by Fugazme. It pours up a crystal clear honey gold color. Nice head up to two fingers and falls quickly down to a cap on the beer. Minimal lacing with this one. The smell is faint, sweet and grainy, with some hop background. The taste is nice. A refreshing sweet taste up front, fruity with strawberries the middle leaves way to more of a tangy citrus zest. The finish hits you with a nice mild hop kick. Not bad, a very solid offering. The mouthfeel is nice, full and creamy, with a tingle of trapped carbonation on the tounge and cheek. This is a very drinkable beer, sans hop kick this is mass marketable, with the hop kick it makes for a sessionable beer destine for garage fridges the BA world over (or at least in the Mid-West). Check it out if you can."
"Verdict: It's not revolutionary, but it's oh-so-drinkable. This practically screams ""session beer."""
"Body is lightish, with pretty standard carbonation. Defintely can't complain, mouthfeel is right on target, leading to a very drinkable hoppy brew."
"D- This is a great hoppy session beer. The big hops are all in the flavor and aroma and they play well with the malt that comes through. The bittering hops stay in the background only to add a nice finish to this beer. All the flavors are distinct and fresh giving good complexity under 5%ABV. Well-built and well handled this is an inspired beer. The fresher the better for this gem."
"This is the type of session beer I've been looking for. Its complexity and flavor at 4.8% blows my mind."
"This would be my lawnmower beer if I had to choose one...so flavorful and balanced."
" Even though I've only had two (the Robert the Bruce Scottish is also available here in Jersey) of 3 Floyds offerings, I love what they bring to the table. Nice mix of hops, a full citrus flavor and aroma, and a finely crafted, easily drinkable set of brews. Cheers to the Hoosier state's finest!"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy golden color ale with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of floral hops with a good malt presence. Balance between the floral hops and the semi-sweet malt is very interesting. The above average body is also very enjoyable. If I were to rate this per the style, I would probably rate this very low because this hoppy beer does not remind me of a mild or a bitter. But since Im rating this solely on what I tasted I can say that without being a great beer it is a very enjoyable session beer."
"12 oz., bottle-conditioned, served in a nonic. It pours a hazed caramel/bronze wtih a half inch of off-white head that doesn't leave much lacing. It smells of caramel malts and citric/piney hops. Tastes kinda like a pale ale but without as full of a body, but it's still smooth, and it has that American citric (grapefruit) hop character with some leafy bitterness. Overall not very mild in any respect except the alcohol content, and I'm fairly sure it's not what an English mild should be even though this is my first example of the style. It is, however, very sessionable as they mention on the bottle, but perhaps a bit too expensive to make it a regular session ale."
"This is a tasty beer, but it is one of Three Floyds' lesser offerings, IMHO. However, there is nothing mild or English about it. It is highly drinkable. In fact, I would go so far as to say that I was dissapointed by the thin mouthfeel. The beer does have the toffee-malt thing going on, but it is dwarfed by the strong citrusy hop profile. I could definitely imagine throwing back many of these on a summer day, for it is definitely better than the majority of summer ales on the market."
"This beer poured a bright and clear amber to copper color topped by a light fluffy egg-white head. Nice lace left on the glass as the head recedes. Up front punch of hops in the aroma (Columbus?) with a nice malty back of toffee. The taste is very citrusy up front. The grapefruit rind from the hops melds well with the malt (in the form of dark carmel) to provide a pleasant flavor. The finish is all hops. Its amazing that this beer passes as a mild. Its more of an IPA. Of course all 3F beers go over the top on the hops, but I do enjoy them. The mouth feel is slick and refreshing. Great drinkability. Wonderful beer and quite drinkable at less than 5% ABV."
"crisp and clean, light-bodied and a medium-high carbonation. bit of malty sweetness then a hoppy aftertaste. ridiculously drinkable. nothing that blows you away, but a very enjoyable brew; the craft beer lover's lawnmower beer."
"Soft amber color with loads of lacing and a thick head. Intense carbonation. Aromas of white grapes, spices, hops, and caramel. Slightly off-balance with minimal hops but still tastey. A semi-sweet, toasted flavor dominates, although it is somewhat subtle. Good mouthfeel, but perhaps a bit too mild for continued drinking. I would want more flavors."
"Ahhh, spring! When a BA's mind turns away from the warming darkness of Doppelbocks and Imperial Stouts, and towards the subtle wonder of lighter, hoppier beers. Pride and Joy embodies the best traits of a ""first day of Spring"" beer. It is a pleasant bronze whose nose is just a whiff of hops. Then, the first sip gently massages your tongue with mild english hops and a light, friendly maltiness. Ahhhh, sitting on my porch, drinkin' a beer. Is there anything finer?"
"Not a mild ale at all really, this is definately a pale ale. Just a pretty damn good, balanced session beer."
"Drinkability is high, this is so approachable and major props to 3F for applying craft skills to a low-alcohol, lower-flavor ale that doesn't knock your socks off but instead is a masterpiece of delicate flavors. This is supposed to be ""an American version of a British Mild."" I guess it is mild, and the lighter color and hop focus are American, but what's British about it? Just call it an American mild, and it is set."
"Dark clear orange color with medium carbonation present and a small off-white head. Fairly hoppy smells of citrus and floral hops. Seemingly present in most of Three Floyds beers. Interesting tastes of caramel malts and bits of a maltier or nuttier malts. Strange brew that I cannot place. It seems to be following an english style but the hops really throw me for a loop. There is a hoppiness that leans toward a pale ale but then again it is a bit maltier. Sweet tangy tastes are very appealing and this is quite a good session brew. The aftertaste is on the dry side and still hoppy citrus. Overall a pleasing beer that Three Floyds makes here."
"This would probably be a great spring morning beer."
"Drinkability/notes: An interesting interpretation of a familiar style. Quite drinkable, and presumably a hop-head's delight."
"I don't think this is necessarily true to the Mild Ale style, but it's a very enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"Aftertaste is a bit biting and dry, but this beer has a good full mouthfeel and I may not be able to save the other one to take home."
"This nifty little brew pours a nice sort of orange copper tone on the amber colour scale. It was aggressively poured to form a head that was not a lasting feature. I do have a small foamy cap currently poised on top of my beer. It looks like it is planning to stick around and it is also giving off some decent lace. The nose holds a nice juicy hop character. Smells predominantly of lemon. The malt character is overshadowed by this hop influence, as both are mild as expected with the malt being more contained off the sniff. The hop character is much more active. It smells really pleasing. I couldn't imagine anyone not enjoying a little whiff of this one. The taste is so easy. This really is a perfect sessioner. It has a nice bit of sweetness and the lemony citrus of hops, but on a more universally appealing scale. A bit of yeasty influence rides along with the lightly proportioned malt backdrop. I can easily envision driving around on a riding lawnmower in the heat with a glass of this in my hand. My mom might even enjoy it. Mild is a perfect description and style classification. It is hard not to love this even if bigger beers are your favorite implement in the arsenal. Just right."
"Thanks to fellow BA UncleJimbo for the chance to try this one. Appearance: slightly cloudy orange amber. Cream colored head disappeared quickly, and I have no head left. Bubbles on the bottom of my glass rise slowly. Smell: prominent malt, but some earthy notes I am also picking up low grapefruity hop notes. Taste: The earthy note I picked up on earlier is at the front again, followed by low malt, and a trickle of citrusy hop bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel: The best feature, small tickly carbonation, not too thin. Drinkability: Not as much a: ""gotta get that again"" brew as the abv promised imo."
"D- I NEED a barrel of this on tap at home! After this, I truly understand the meaning of a session brew. I could drink this all night and come back for more the next day. Awesome brew that needs to be tried. I cannot believe how many times I have walked by this on the shelves. It will become a future staple in my fridge!"
"A very poundable brew; obviously has ""session"" written all over it. When I think of mild, I think more dark and less hoppy, but this is a delicious beer, no matter what. Malt and hops of this one work very well together."
"Orangish hue with about a finger of head. Some sticky lacing. There is a subtle sweetness in the aroma, with some grassy hops and just a hint of citrus. Pretty well balanced flavor, the hops stand out just a bit in the finish. Medium bodied, well carbonated. This would make a pretty good session beer if it was available to me all the time."
"I would have called this a classic pilsner, knid of similar to Prima Pils from Victory. But BA calls it an English Dark Mild. I can't tell what's what anymore."
"This mild ale poured a clear, coppery color with white foam that settled and clung to the inside of the glass a little bit. The smell was nicely hoppy with a touch of floral hops as well, and nice crystal malt with a note of caramel. The taste was mildly malty (crystal malt) with a good hoppiness, only mildly bitter, together with a light fruitiness. Very nice. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with medium body and good carbonation. The hoppiness lingered. This was a very nice and enjoyable mild. I want more!"
"If I didn't have to drive to Illinois to get it, I would drink this all of the time. Although it's a stretch to call this an English mild, it is one hell of a session beer."
"Drinkable, 3 drink minimum."
"Mouthfeel is average. Pretty carbonated, but smooth enough to not stop drinking."
"Just a little less bitter and citrusy, and a little more malt and this beer would be superb in my opinion. As it is now, it is a great session beer that I could drink all the time for sure. Mouthfeel is pretty light, not quite as crisp as it could be."
"Overall Impression: Outstanding session beer. Hops on top make pop hop! Wish it was local; Id drink it all the time. Thanks again to Rick for carting back a bottle from the Heartland."
"This one is great tasting and highly drinkable. It's a touch overly-sweet at times or I'd have bumped the Drinkablility score up a touch more. Definitely worth a try."
"Could be a new style... ""American Mild"""
"Sorry for the low score, but this is not a mild. This is definately a Pale ale or an IPA or something in that family. It is an excellent well made beer but not a mild. The pour is bright copper color with a full white head and lace on the glass, nice. Ahint of malt introduces the flavor before the hop assault starts. The beer is crisp and very dry and dries out even more in the finish. A nice pale ale"
"Definitely not to style as a mild ale, but still a damn fine beer to drink. Definitely a Three Floyds brew with lots of potent hops. Poured a slightly cloudy copper but it cleared quite nicely though. Not much of a head but some nice carbonation that gives this beer a nice medium feeling body. Low ABV would make this a great session beer-0but be aware of the hops because it might throw those taste buds for a bit of a loop. Nose is hops and the deep woods of Maine (think wet wood). Flavor is at first malty but with a nice plump hop bite throughout this beer. Lots of overrripe citrus rinds around this beer as well."
"12 oz bottle. Tones of pungant hops very little malt character. Pour pale with an orange/brown hue. Very little head and no lace. Massive hop flavor but still no real malt present. Super bitter. Kind of makes me cringe to swallow. Light body. Pretty puckering. Not real easy to drink. By far my least favorite 3F brew. Im sure glad the rest are pretty great."
"I hate to pan any beer but I feel that in this case I have to. Reading the beer style description this beer by no means is a mild ale. I think this beer would be better off as a IPA instead. Extremely hoppy for a mild ale and not as dark as I thought it should be. A bit thin in body and a little too much floral in the nose. Sorry Three Floyds I think you missed the mark on this one."
"Drinkability: This could certainly turn into a session beer, as it's not loaded with malt or hops, has enough taste to not overwhelm the palate, and also doesn't have a high ABV. It would probably go well with a meal, too."
"It is a good beer but I wouldnt go out of the way to buy it again."
"Shhh...this is really nothing like a British Mild, despite the way the brewer describes the beer. Don't tell anyone, because then they might change the recipe, which would be ashame. This beer has an enjoyable, distinct orange smell and a good hops kick to balance the citrus and sweet tastes. The hops also have a little bit of a husky taste. Maybe it's a little thin in the mouthfeel, but I'm just focused on the nice lacing."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a small white head. The aroma is suprisingly strong for such a small beer. Sweet and Citrusy it is quite pleasant. Taste is kind of hoppy, but very subdued. The mouthfeel is rather thin. Overall, this is an alright brew. I could see this being the perfect beer to have with lunch while at work."
"Mouthfeel was pretty good, nothing spectacular, but nice and smooth... drinkability was such that I would gladly have another."
"A mild ale?Well not so sure about that,pours a rich copper with a nice white two finger head that leaves a nice sheet of lace behind as it settles,no ""mild"" aromas going on here piney,resiny hop with slight caramel malt note in the background.A tad watery mouthfeel but not to thin mild flavors for Three Floyds I suppose lightly sweet and caramelly but that piney,resiny American hop presence is there make this well balanced and oh so quaffable.I could drink this ale all day has nice flavors and ind goes down like water,a traditional mild no but a damn good American style mild oh hell yeah."
"Drinkability- Even with the watery aspect, it's still a very good beer that I would definitely buy again in the future. Quite a good session beer as well I would assume."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with very little head and carbonation. All I can smell is the hops. Man is it strong. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderate carbonation. Taste is very bitter with mild malt flavor. Too bitter for me. I didn't think a English Dark Mild would ever be this bitter. Drinkability would be higher, but the bitterness is too much. I don't know if I'll ever have this again."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Nice sticky head atop this amber sea of hoppiness. Mild yes. Hoppy yes. I can't righly say if it's too hoppy or just right in the mild department. Definitley hoppy characteristics up front. Lip smacking hops as a matter of fact. Sweet with matching hop bitterness. A nice little brew from Indiana. This is quite drinkable a nice beer to have about the house for any old situation."
"This one is very hoppy. Taste of floral hops, hints of grapefruit or orange peel. Lightly fruity malt. Very crisp and a long lingering bitterness. Bitterness is very persistent. not a traditonal mild, not with all those hops dominating but it is tasty and at less than 5% it would make a serviceable session beer."
"Copper in colour with a thick, frothy white head and prodigious aromas of malt, brioche, orange-lemon, and pine. Clean malty flavor with noticeable hops on the mid and finish. Not at all heavy but clean smooth and delicious. Perhaps a touch aggressive for a ""Mild"" but I guess in relation the the average 3 Floyds brew this is a Mild after all."
"A serviceable bitter and we don't need boldness and high alcohol to clean the palate. Crisp, good carbonation, florl, grapefruit and lemonade. A changeup between the pales and stouts. Decent and drinkable bitter. Don't be fooled by the numbers, in perspective of the bold beers."
"Pride & Joy a mild ale? Seemed to me to be closer to an American pale ale. Good looking amber/orange pour, very yeasty cloudy, yum. No brew date on the bottle, bummer. Lots of citrus and floral in the aroma  also in the taste. But still, seemed to much floral hops for a mild ale. Still, a nice medium bodied summer brew to go along with the BBQing."
"Big fluffy head and copper in color. This smells of carmalized fruits and hops. The taste has tons of hops and fruits, notes of banana. Big body to this brew with loads of flavor that keeps delivering. Hop blast after hop blast, from start to finish. This body is deep, it keeps filling the palate with all of these fruits and pine. Coats your mouth like sap. Excellent beer."
"While I personally don't enjoy it, it is a fresh-tasting, quality beer."
"Pours a clear orangish-copper in color. Moderate-sized creamy white head persists and offers up some patchwork lace on the glass. Aromas are a mix of spices, estery fruits, maybe a dash of sweetness. Flavor is more of the carry over from the aroma: Citric zing with a noticeable hop bitterness that helps this one end clean and sorta dry. It's a strange tiwst on a mild, to be sure. Not reserved, but not over the top. Decent mouthfeel and very, very drinkable. Is this a mild? According to 3F, it is. Maybe a candidate for conversion of the masses."
"A great summer MILD ale?...who are they trying to kid..it's a flavorful pale ale or solid IPA with as much flavor this brew has.. but they're right about it being a great summer/session beer. Thirst quenching & delicious at the same time. Three Floyd's has yet to disappoint."
"This is my first of 4 Three Floyds that my brother brought me from Indiana. I've been looking forward to trying these for a while now. Pours a cloudy gold color with a minimal head that dissipates quickly. Wonderful hops citrus smell. Is this a Mild Ale or an IPA? Hops bitterness dominates up front but is balanced nicely. Smooth finish that makes you want to drink more of this. If this is what Three Floyds has to offer I'm looking forward to trying more."
"Hop bitterness is perfect and along with the medium light mouth feel supported by moderate carbonation - this could be the perfect session beer for baseball coaches or anyone looking for a quality thirst quencher."
"Very tasty and quaffable..."
"The beer pours a hazy dark gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It also has an intense hop aroma that really makes this beer. It is well balanced. The taste is great as well. It has a solid malt core that lays a base for the hops in the taste and finish. It is quite bitter, but very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a fine brew. It is full of flavor and good aroma. Another solid beer from Three Floyds."
"This is not exactly the standard for ""Englis Dark Mild"". Not at all what you might expect from the name. However, Three Floyds is the brewer that calls Alpha King ""only"" a pale ale, not an IPA. So it's not terrible surprising to find that their Mild smells of grapefruit. Whatever. This may not be classicly to style, but it is a damn fine beer."
"Tasted: 12/03/05"
"Cool label, crazy jester with a pint on his head. Pours a soft, clear golden color with very little head. The nose is of spicy and fruity hops. Immediately, the beer tastes skinny. There is definitely a caramel malt flavor behind the hops that seems to linger and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Very refreshing with a nice hint of sweet malt and hops. Wonderful example of a an English Mild with an American twist."
"The word mild on the label is somewhat misleading. Well, mild in comparison maybe. Pours a hazy copper color with a foamy off-white rocky head. Good retention. Nice patches of sticky lace on the sides of the glass. Citrusy aroma, grapefruit in particular. Slight biscuity malt, citrusy and spicy hop flavor. Restrained hop bitterness, but still a fair amount. Finishes fairly dry. Medium body, low carbonation. Seems like Alpha King's little brother. Yes, mild in comparison to some of their other offerings, but certainly full of flavor. What a great session beer this is. This went down oh so easy."
"Pours a dark, copper/amber color. Has a rather persistent head that isn't thick, but doesn't go away, quite a bit of carbonation. Smells of hops, mainly bitter hops and citrus, not much floral here. Taste is of a medium malt body, with some bread characteristics, citrus hops with a moderate spicy finish. Very drinkable. This is probably my favorite social beer, because I can have a few of them and enjoy every pint without being completely blasted. Not sure if I like bottle of tap version of this more."
"A slightly hazy light amber beer. Has a small white head. There is a full boquet of hops in the aroma, spicey and citrusy. Mouthwatering. The flavor is lighter than the aroma leads you to belive. It starts with a nice citrusy hop character with mild hint of malt in the middle and finishing of smoothly with the spicey hop note. The hop aroma may scare some but it is an easy drinking beer. Hoppy yes but not agressively so."
"Drinkable? Hell yeah. I really enjoyed this beer, it was very easy to drink but very likable. That is a deadly combination. I purchased one bottle (One bottle? Idiot!) in Iowa City, IA. In the future this will be a six-pack purchase. I recommend this beer. Buy some before I buy it all."
"This is an American Pale Ale, and a damn fine one...or perhaps what a Small beer made from Dreadnaught's sloppy seconds might taste like."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/8"" bubbly beige head over the slightly cloudy golden amber brew. Head fades to half its height, holding steady with slight but full coverage, and lacing is good. Aroma is citrusy yet piney, with a light undercurrent of sweetness. Taste starts with pale malt sweetness, giving way to the pine and citrus notes of the hops. Well balanced, with a lean ot the hops, but not to its detriment. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is superb, a beer made to session. Nice to see an what should be classified an American mild, probably more hops character here than the UK would expect. Check it out if you can."
"pours a sparkling golden color with a small white fizzy head. Smell is citric, definitely grapefruit, classic cascade nose. Taste is of slight caramel. The malt backbone is not very large, but stands up to balance out the citric hop bitterness and flavor. mouthfeel is thinnish, but very drinkable. English? Nah, drinkable, hell yea! This is the epitome of session."
"I really recommend giving this a try."
"Even though this, in my opinion, is more of an APA than an English mild, it is darn good."
"Extremely drinkable. Now if I could just get this from a cask!!"
"Pours a pale amber with a thin white head that doesn't last long. Very floral and spicy aroma, slightly smoky. Taste is of citric hops and pine resin, mellowing out and sweetening as it warms. Feels thin and oily on the palate, but not offensive in the least. This is a great session beer that is hoppy enough to be an IPA."
"There's nothing like waking up with nothing to do on a Saturday morning. I'm beginning the day with a nice session mild, or so it says on the bottle. This beer is no mild, it might even pass for an IPA! Pours a hazy orangish golden color with a nice frothy head. Good carbonation, lively body. Very hoppy aroma with notes of citric grapefruit and there's a nutty yeast note in there as well. Taste has more citric bitterness from the hops and the grapefruit goes away. Sweet english toffee and lightly roasted nuts underneath the initial alpha acid assault. Finish is dry and lingering in hop bitterness but its soft as well. Very sessionable but the malt doesn't quite hold up enough and the hops are more bittering than flavoring. Still, really really easy drinking stuff. Thanks Craig."
"The taste is as the smell prescribed. I think I have found me a new favorite session beer, and I'll be damned if I don't convince my friends of the same. At an ABV of under 5%, I could drink this all night, and will definitely do so in the future. I can't believe I have passed this up so many times. So, why are you still reading this when you could be out buying some more beer to supplement your beer fridge?"
"ng"
"Sampled from the beer engine at the Map Room in Chicago. My heart skipped a beat when I saw the board saying this was on the engine when I was there. How did it take me 3 beers into the night to see that this was there? It poured a deep amber color with 2 fingers of head, full of large bubbles, that fell to coat the beer. The nose was a nice blend of grapefruity hop and a slight chewy bubblygum. It was slightly crisp, but smelld divine. Cask conditioning this beer took it to places that I didn't know existed. The flavor was mellow. A great blend of the grapefruit hop and the caramel sweetness. This is what I will hold all mild ales up against in flavor. It was mild, yet so full of flavor. The feel was so smooth and silky, with just a bare minimum of carbonation to keep it true. I thought that this beer was fantastic. I'm not sure there is anything they can do withthe flavor to make it better. I can only hope that next time I am there they have the Alpha King on cask."
"Smooth and oh-so creamy mouthfeel goes down so easily. If you think Pride & Joy is a good session ale out of the bottle...just try it on cask and be blown away. This one could be drank all night long with no problem. Simply a great beer by Three Floyd's made even better on cask. Highly recommended."
"Carbonation out the ying-yang! It hits the tip of your tongue and kills alot of flavors, as well as teh temperature served (chilled) hurt this one a bit I think. Easy to drink due to the light body- definitely a nice spring/summer brew. I'd like to say I liked this one, but I would be a liar...I've had better."
"This is a mild ale with 3floyds hop profile. It's not a hop monster. Its a very solid brew to quaff when you don't want alot of alcohol."
"An extremely tasty brew that could make a fine session beer, although it is a tad pricey. I'm buying it again!"
"This ale is not ""mild"" by most standards. If anything, this is just a lighter version of their Alpha King."
"The taste is very good. As I stated before, it is a good beer to drink on a semi-regular basis. Good for parties etc, not only for the taste, but the label artwork is a conversation starter, as is all artwork on Three Floyds bottles."
"12 ounce bottle. The only thing mild about this beer is the alcohol. The aroma is pure hops...of course it says as much on the label. This is definitely a session beer and a beer that really has no style."
"When I think ""mild", Three Floyds beers arent the first thing to spring to mind. However, leave it to them to make one that leaves an impression. Lightly hazy amber color with a thin eggshell white head. Thin lacing too. The aroma is mildy hoppy with a pinch of citrus. Light-bodied and surprisingly crisp, with a moderately bitter amount of hops throughout. Underlying sweetness and citrus flavors make this simply one of the best session ales I have ever had. It was gone before I even knew it. The finish retains the hops, with lightly sweet malt here and there. An outstanding Mild Ale."
"This is a crystal clear amber color with about a half-inch of fluffy white head. The head drops quickly but leaves a decent amount of lace around the glass as it was consumed. Aroma is surprisingly hoppy for a mild, with citric and floral hops all over the place. Notes of grapefruit and a bit of malt where evident as well. Taste starts of with a bitter citric hop bit that is cooled by a bit of sweet malt. This is one hop heavy mild all around and I am loving it. Aftertaste is a hoppy bitter one that is a bit grassy and floral. Mouthfeel is fairly light and crisp. I could drink this stuff all day, its full of hops tasty and goes down easy. Definitely a new favorite lighter session beer for me."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp and the start, and finishes crisp and dry. Medium bodied brew. Nice carbonation levels. This is a brew you can drink all day and night, as the flavor is very interesting but not overblown."
"This is by far the best session brew I've come across"
"Pours a coppery orange head with a nice fluffy off white head. Aroma is of pine with a bit of grapefruity citrus in there as well. Taste well it may be a mild in strength but not in flavour. Very hoppy almost from start to finish. Not much to speak of in the way of malt to balance this brew out just a bit of malty notes in the middle before more piney hop finish. However, this is pretty much what i would have expected from 3F's Mouthfeel is good. The hoppyness never gets harsh or overbearing. Drinkabililty is very high since its a nice flavourful brew at an ABV that won't have you talking to your imaginary friend two beers later."
"Anyway, I let this one get well into cellar temperature before I cracked it for a more authentic mild experience. The body is a copper-hued amber with very light carbonation moving through it. The head is robust and rolls up quickly causing me to halt the pour on several occasions, it retains nicely though and leaves fat, sticky clumps of lace on the glass. The aroma is hoppy as hell! Not quite what I was expecting for a mild, juicy citrussy hops with a faint malt backbone. Honestly, Ive smelled IPAs with less hops and definitely American Pale Ales, so this level of PacNW hops on the nose tells me this isnt a typical Mild. Drinking this beer leaves me a little bewildered. I love hops just as much as the next guy, but here, its almost like the malt is recognized for a millisecond, and is then ambushed and totally eclipsed by hop flavor. Dont get me wrong, the flavors are delicious but I get no sense of balance here what-so-ever, and normally I need my hops to at least pretend to be balanced by malt, or alcohol, or both preferably. Adding to this the mouthfeel is incredibly light, it goes down almost like water, brings to mind the phrase hop tea. I guess the term Mild is in reference to the alcohol content which is low that makes this a drink-all-day sessioner. A good beer, it will satisfy your craving for hops and you can sip on it forever without getting out of hand, but dont come here looking for balance."
"Pours a brilliantly clear deep copper color. It is topped by a thin light tan head. The aroma has been infused by that typical Three Floyd's, over the top hoppiness. I get notes of apricot, ruby-red grapefruit, tangerine and orange. The taste is initially sweet up front, but then moves to a fairly dry finish. Throughout though it is a hop lovers dream. This beer is about as far from a mild as possible, it could easily pass for a supped up pale ale though. I am not quite too sure what to think of this beer, it is certainly by no definition a Mild Ale, but it certainly is what I expect Three Floyds to brew as their mild. I am certainly enjoying the in your face citrus fruit notes, but I wish that there was some of that malty complexity that one gets from a traditional Mild Ale. In the end though this beer does taste quite good."
"This is nothing close to an English dark mild ale, but it's highly drinkable, and very well put together. Much closer to an American pale ale in character, but I wouldn't mind keeping several bottles of this around. Very nice."
"Very drinkable beer. Serve this to non-BA folks and I think they migh really enjoy it."
"Taste is a slight sweet maltiness just for a second then the hops kick in, a very fresh, lemony, vegetal taste. If you like hops this beer is for you. Much hoppier than the style would indicate, but still another great beer from the floyds. I agree with their desciption on the bottle that this is a great session beer as the flavor combines for a nice carbonated mouthfeel and has very good drinkabality."
"All in all this really isn't a bad beer. It just isn't a ""mild"" in my humble opinion, and certainly isn't a ""dark"" one by any means. Perhaps if they keep that recipe and change the style designation, this one would be a high scorer. As it is, I can't go too high. Avoid it, unless you're aware what you're going to get from the bottle."
"EDIT (11/14/04): 3 Floyds is making a comeback! I am now able to get this beer on a regular basis...kick ass!"
"I've recently discovered that Pride & Joy is readily available in my area. Since I feel that a session APA (which is what this really is, let's not kid ourselves) completes Three Floyds's lineup nicely and fills a niche in my own regular rotation, I'll be coming back to this one again and again."
"*edit a few months later. For the last couple of Pride & Joy's that I've had, i've been getting a lot of tea flavor, like earl grey tea. In fact it seems the predominant flavor, I love it!"
"This brew is a clear, dark golden color, with a nice sized bubbly white head on top. Carbonation bubbles rising rapidly. Sweet bubblegum aroma. The taste of this one has a nice oily hop backbone, citrus, the main feature of this drink. Same type as their pale, to compare. Sweet malt up front, cereal grain. For a nice light beer this is quite flavorful, Im impressed."
"This beer poured a standard amber color with a small head and didn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma was very hoppy with hints of caramel. Doesn't smell much like a mild, more like an IPA. The flavor is dead on what I think a mild should be, regardless of the overhopped aroma. Very smooth and light. Finishes slightly bitter, but within the mild area. Very well done beer."
"Overall a very drinkable beer and I enjoyed it. I can see myself buying it often in the future. Its not what I was expecting, but it is as they state an American take on an English mild."
"Poured an orangish gold, had sort of a nice light citrus malt aroma.The head was substantial and stuck around, the taste was a soft thin, malt flavor, with a little hop bitterness that comesin at the end. I guess its better than drinking a macro, but compared to other TF products, its like drinking their version of a light."
"Very smooth and robust with sweet malts up front followed by a slightly bitter, citrus hop finish. An exceptionally well balanced brew that would make for a nice session beer."
"Zum wohl!"
"Served at the brewery from draught. Had a nice off white head that left decent lacing down the side of the glass. Pours a clear amber/orange with moderate carbination. The citrusy/piney aroma is very noticable. Hops stick around from start to finish. The body is in the middle of the road. With about 5% alcohol this is a very easy drinking session beer that has some character in both malt and hops but wont get you loaded after 3 or 4."
"Transparent orange hue, thin bubbly carbonation, a decent off-white head. On the nose, a beauty here! Some wheat and hops noticeable, perhaps some citrus in the way of lemon, orange peel, even some lime notes. Up front, a definitive hop detection, backed largely by some breadish/toasty notes. A dryness is noted up front, borderline medium bodied. Great flavoring throughout, some citrus hops are noted as she warms. Not sure of the main intent of the beer, nonetheless, rather tasty and session-able."
"First things first, I have to give it up for the artwork and naming of the beer from Three Floyds Brewing. The Pride and Joy set the mood to really enjoy this beer and have fun. The look of this beer was cloudy and amber in color. It smelled sweet and fruity...a citric aroma...grapefruit. Had a nice smooth taste with no real after taste. I did enjoy this beer. It didn't impress me but it's a good solid brew. I recommend their web site, it's fun."
"Color is a dusty honey brown with hazy particles floating around within, a one finger high head of off-white fluff builds quickly and sits long before finally fading to a thick skim always present. Minimal thin strings and spots of lace. Aroma is quite nice for a mild, cuz its mild but with a pleasant amount of strength, both a nice fresh dried and leafy hop balances well with a deep sweet bready maltyness. Nose includes nice light fruityness, kinda dull and maybe musty/old citrus with a heavy frothy barley sweetness. Reminds me of a Vienna, Alt, or sweeter Red, but whatever, its a fantastic nose for a mild. Taste is mild as well but has a nice strength in its presence that seems to carry over from the aroma. Great maltyness, breadish, thick, hardy, almost chewy to a point, lightly sour of bagel dough with some nice touches of dullish fruity sweetness and notes of nuttyness and butter. Hops enter in very lightly at the finish with nice notes of dried leafyness and a perfect little blend of bittering thats a bit grassy very late in the finish. Never overbearing in any way, seems to always peak at just the right moment as to keep the mildness in both the palate and flavors but keeps its brawny demeanor. Wonderful. Feel is heavenly smooth, kinda fluffy in texture with a close to medium body and a grand easy carbonation that just floats down the gullet. I haven't had many true Mild Ales, and I'm thinking this may be over the top as far as the English versions are concerned, but with that aside this stuff blew my socks off for a Mild. Glad I picked it up, and what could possibly be the very last remnants of any Three Floyd's here in MN. (Til it gets picked up again?)"
"Drinkability: WIll have to try this one again, becuase this is a bit austere to be a ""session"" beer as they claim it to be."
"Enjoyed on draft at the brewery. Yes, difinitely the ""starter"" beer to introduce a virgin to the 3F family. Hoppiness is not as pronounced as with other 3F beers, but still very much present. Simple malty taste keeps this beer well within the ""Mild"" style, but still manages to pack the 3F twist."
"On a whole, I was disappointed with this offering from Three Floyds. The taste was out of balance and the feel was not too pleasing, either. Maybe it was poorly stored or old but Im not in any hurry to find another for comparison."
"This brew pours a thin dirty white head along with an opaque orangish brown body. As expected, it is lightly carbonated and the flavor and aroma are absent of hops. This is a very easy drinking beer with a slightly tart taste on the tongue. You can see having a few of these with your friends down at a pub."
"A fine session beer with a depth of flavor that will stay with you through a handful of bottles."
"Thick looking, hazy dark honey color with an off-white head the settles a bit, but leaves a quarter inch of thick foam. Smell is sweet of malt, plus some butterscotch and honey. Smooth mouthfeel delivers a malty flavor with hints of dough and honey, with a slight citrus tingle in the finish. I notice no hops, but the flavor is round and balanced. This is very drinkable."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a clear deep amber color with two fingers of head. There are nice lace rings left after each sip. The smell has both malty caramel and hop aromas. Overall it is a fairly sweet smell. The taste has some caramel and hazelnut at first, then ends with a beautiful hops balance. One of the most balanced brews I've ever had. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, and this beer is very smooth. The drinkability is also fantastic. I'll definately be buying more of this!"
"This mild ale pours an apricot/orange hue with a thinning, bubbly off-white head that that looks great while leaving minor trails of lace down the pint glass. The aroma is biscuity with some pronounced citric hoppiness. Taste-wise, this brew is mildly hoppy, quite biscuity/malty with a lingering caramel malt finish. It's quite British in nature with a pronounced American hop profile. Very interesting mild ale, to be sure. It's smooth, medium-bodied and finishes quite clean. A perfect session ale for hop heads, this is an easy drinking, low abv ale. Certainly a Three Floyds take on an underappreciated style. Very well done for a low gravity brew."
"I was sort of confused as to why 3 Floyds would make a style that calls for very little hops. They seem to revel in the plant. Pours a nice rich brown, with a pleasing khaki head. Aroma is way too hoppy. You can smell the hops, for starters. Malts smell right, but are overwhelmed by the floral hoppiness. Flavor is also off. Way, way too much hops. Mild roastiness and some bittersweet bready flavors. It irritates me that these guys just overhop everything, like it's a source of pride. Carbonation is way too high, hops are mellow for 3 Floyds, but still way too high for this style. They should have called it an american brown ale, because that's what it is. I rated the drinkability higher, because it is a good beer, but i was hoping for and expecting a smooth english mild."
"This is a perfect beer for ""multiple"" tastings. A slight hop flavor of Three Floyds that is expected. Definitely Three Floyds version of a typical British Mild. A good hop flavor with a nice balanced malt finish. Definitely drinkable, ridiculously flavorful for such a mild beer, Find it, love it, share it. Nick Floyd for President."
"Drinkability, yes I could have a few of these and be happy, but there are others I prefer"
"Bright golden- copper in color, has a large foamy white head, that lasts.Nice citrus aroma of hops, some caramel malt flavors with a mild hop bite make this very easy to drink, light bodied with crisp mouthfeel, has a light hop bitterness in the finish, very drinkable and mild."
"-F"
"Pours a nice golden amber. The full, foamy head diminishes slowly leaving some lacing behind on the glass. The aroma is mild, with a hint of citrus and hops. Tastes mild, with a bit of hops. Sweetness--probably from the citrus--can be felt on the tip of the tongue. A very drinkable beer (especially in the summer months) that feels very smooth and light. Not an exceptional beer, but definitely one I will drink again."
"Three Floyds Pride & Joy: Copper color, nice head, with a good stickiness. The aroma is nice, oranges, or at least a hint of the Florida fruit. Wow, this is a nice beer, but cripes it is as unremarkable a brew as I’ve seen lately. In other words, its got good taste, but there were five of us sitting there and not one could come up with a better description than it tastes like “beer.” After much effort, we concluded that there was some caramel malts, but this beer is balanced with a passion. Its good, but I can’t explain why."
"12 oz brown bottle. This one depicts a joker with a beer popping out of his hat. Cool. Medium golden dark color. Sticky rocky off-white head. Huge hop filled bubbles pop through. Fresh hop aromas. Taste is decidly hop filled, sticky and rich on smooth sweet creamy malt presence. Almost oily, resin like hop feel. Sticky and syrupy all in one taste. Very good and highly hoped. Medium to light bodied, not much carbonation, the hops seem to do the trick. Very drinkable, easy going down. Another beer I would have guessed was an IPA."
"This beer was a surprise, and not at all what I expected. A mild pale ale...so I expected the predominant flavor to be hops. Oh no. This beer had a high degree of maltiness, a candy-like butterscotch malt flavor. Very light brown in color, with malt and caramel aromas. I liked this beer, but nothing stood out a whole lot to me. Needs more hop flavor to balance things out. Still a good brew, just one I wouldnt want more than one at a time of. Boy is my grammar bad."
"Light amber color with a light tan head that started nice but was gone quickly, with not much lacing. Smell was of ripe fruits and a sweet and syrupy lingering aroma. This ale was rather mild in terms of hop taste almost to mild. Had a more malty caramel sweet character than anything else. Overall a decent beer but nothing to go write home about. As for a session beer the extra low carbonation and syrupy sweetness would grow tiresome for me after a few."
"Big, creamy head; copper color. Aroma: fresh, slightly spicy, soft, faintly herbal, some lemon zest. Taste:tangy, but smooth, quite mild, but more character and flavor than other session ale types I've tried recently. I could drink a lot of this, if I didn't care too much about variety, etc. Unfortunately, I like to drink quality, exciting brews, and a diversity of them. So I ask: why can't the discriminating session beer drinker, the party giver, the softball player, turn to this instead of Bud Light?"
"Color is a hazy brownish orange with an off-white head that's about 1 finger thick. Aroma was quite interesting-- a combination of hops, grapefruit and madarin orange. Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel. Citrusy, hoppy middle. Creamy finish with a lemony hop bitterness to it. Combo of citrus and hop are good, yet at times a little too bitter and sour. I think this would be a more refreshing beer in summer than in winter when I sampled it."
"Not a mild. Maybe ""mild"" in relation to Floyd's other beers, but actually more like a bitter or even a pale ale. Still very good, citric hops in initial bite, caramel comes on strong and finish is soothing and sweet. Full, creamy, and lots of intrigue with Floyd's trademark hop profile. Lemony. Like an Alpha King scaled down, and perhaps a better session choice considering AK's octane."
"This is a great example of a highly drinkable session ale.   Light bodied.  Has a crisp taste that balances oh so citrusy hops with dry, hide and seek maltiness.   Try one on your late morning coffee break instead of coffee."
"Pride & Joy is a light bodied Mild Ale that pour to a nice amber color with a off-white head that quickly dissipates.  It has a light citrus hop aroma, balanced by a light malt aroma.  At first taste there is a subtle maltiness, then a bit of citric hoppiness.  It finishes with a slight sweetness.  Overall it is a light, refreshing well-balanced beer."
"This beer was a medium amber color and formed a nice white head that left some lace.  There was definate aroma hops, but not overpowering, and also of malt.  The taste of caramel whic gave it some slight sweetness, as well as the hops and malt were present.  Definate hops prescense, but not again, not overpowering.  A good summer beer."
"Coppery color, with a thick white head.  Head fades a bit quickly, but leaves plenty of clinging lace.  'Biscuity' aroma with hints of caramel and a strong presence of citrus hops.  Well-balanced flavor:  sweet caramel malt blends wonderfully with the bitter, citrus hops for a smooth taste.  Slight metallic tang on the finish.  Slightly oily, with a bit of lingering carbonation make this brew a lively thirst-quencher.  Excellent session brew!"
"Copper colored and clear. Decent head after pouring from the 12oz. bottle.  The head reappears after a couple gentle swirls. Aroma is biscuits, caramel and some fruitiness (grapes?). Initial taste is slightly metallic. Finishes malty semi-sweet and balanced with subdued hops. Pretty good, but won't hurry to get more."
"Pours a golden amber with a thick chunky head on it.  There are mild malt and hop smells to this beer.  Nice mild malt profile that is balanced by a hop presence that is far stronger than I would have expected for this style.  It is creamy and smooth on the tongue and nicely drinkable.  I like this beer.  Not as much as some others from this brewery but enough to definitely buy it again.  This would be a very nice session brew for transition weather.  You know, when it is too warm to be spring but not quite warm enough to be summer, it would also fit in nicely in the fall."
"Nice bronze color.  Sharp carbonation with a slightly caramel aroma.  Tart and slightly astringent up front, with a mild but firm bitter finish.  Accurately advertised as a good ""session beer."""
