"Good but, interesting.  A lot of flavor up front. Going down, watery and not very much there. I still like this beer, might be too watery for most pale ale fans. Not great, but definitely not bad. Give it a try if you can. Cheers!"

"I found a nice APA in what can often be a beer desert (Kansas). Great looking can."
""
""
""
"This beer had a very crisp taste. I was honestly shocked I didn't anticipate a good beer. I did not take this beer seriously because of the can and print. But it is a quality beer."
""
""
""
""
"I nice ale, not overly hoppy but not bland either. A good balance."
""
"Great Pale Ale, one of my favorites.  I will be grabbing one of these or two more of these during the summer time.  Very refreshing and goes down well for a smooth Pale Ale.  This and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale's are my favorites.  Wish they came in a 6 pack though, since they are so enjoyable."

"Hey, I love this beer and I drink it from a glass. Very simple description: big assertive hop attack, mellows out quickly and has an authentic maltiness that's really yummy.   It's got some nice malts, giving it a orange color and great flavor.  There's room for a little more complexity to this beer, maybe more nose, but is it needed?  This would be my everyday drinker if I could buy it out here in NE."
"16 oz. can bottle from Wed., 12/31/2014 (Niciu 3rd Annual NYE Party) gifted from Erich and Sara, unknown brewing/packaging dates, poured into plastic cup, drank over ~30 minutes"
"Bright, punchy hops meet a slightly caramel and sweet back end. This is a truly well rounded beer and stays nicely within a sessionable range at 5.2%. Very drinkable."

"Great can design but what was inside just wasn't what i was looking for. Way to malty in my opinion."
"S: Citrus, floral, yeast and grass.  T:  Sweet maltiness, grass, light citrus, bready.  F:  Light carbonation, med/light body, light pine bight on the tongue and light pine aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  a good one.  Fairly aggressive for a pale ale, but that's not uncommon anymore."
""
""
"So there you have it."

"T: Bread malt forward, bright citric lime peel and grass. Very clean tasting bitterness. Slightly piercing, but mild and mute. Doesn't get in way of other tropical notes-papaya-which is also understated. Lots of grass and hay, but when in Kansas use what's around."

"Pours a cloudy gold from the can with two fingers of off-white head. Smells of malt and citrus. The taste combines biscuits, citrus and pine, and had a little more hoppy bitterness than I would have expected. Medium mouth with a touch of carbonation, and it lingers on the tongue. I'm really enjoying this, and it's one of the best offerings I've had from Tallgrass. Well done."

"O: A pretty good beer but way to minerally bitter, maybe just a less than optimal match for the light-medium crystal malt contribution. Glad I tried it, but I like a more mellow hops presence and a more rounded maltiness in my APAs."

"Poured from a pint can, with a drink by date of 09/18/14,into a Delirium tulip. Pours a semi hazy golden yellowish orange, with one finger of fluffy off-white head. Spotty lacing left behind as I sip. Smells a bit like a wit style beer, with some spicy herbal hop notes. The taste falls a little flat for my preferences, leaning more towards a strong malt backbone and not enough hops. The mouth feel is right to style for this pale, nice clean finish with a slight hop bite. I would've rated this one higher, but the store owner informed me that this was supposed to be a hoppy pale ale. Not a bad beer at all, just not what I was expecting."

"Overall - Feels a little subdued, but it took some warmth for this to show its potential. Light and pleasant to drink, good hop flavor, good malt flavor. It's hard to remember nowadays that American pale ales probably should taste like this."
"This beer, is a very easy drinking, well balanced brew. A hint of sweetness is very well balanced out. a touch on the cloudy side, but overall good coloring. pleasent yet not overwelming smell. This is the kind of beer that makes me want another one right away, a great ""sitting by the pool"" beer."

"Fruity, yes, so Galaxy hops on display. But too sticky and sweet on top of it. Drinks a lot heavier than 5.2%."
""
""
"On tap at Bernie's in Waukesha, WI pours a hazy, yellow color with a foamy white head. Aroma is mild with wheat, citrus, and a touch of hops. Taste is smooth, mellow and delicious. this makes for quite a mean tasting pale ale. Another must try smooth beer from Tallgrass."

"Rich golden colored. Massive tightly knit off white head that's easily an inch thick. Brussels lacing. Great clarity. Aroma of vegetal Galaxy hops. The flavor is fairly bitter and prominently features the vegetal Galaxy hops. The fade is light malt with a hint of Galaxy hops. The mouth is dry and somewhat chalky."
""
""
""
"A wee bit on the malty side but an easy-drinking and tasty Pale Ale from Tallgrass."
""
""
""
""
"I love the artwork on the can. Who knows what 8-bit has to do with this beer (underpowered it isn't), but it's certainly memorable. I'll definitely buy again."

"Overall: A good pale ale that has the bitterness of an IPA. If I could change anything I would up the aroma and decrease the upfront bitterness in the flavor just a bit. I like this beer a lot, especially at the price point."
"Anyhow, 8-bit's got that classic orangish cloudy look, which is classic IPA, it's hoppy, but not over the top, it's full flavored, and intense, and again without being over bearing... I really really love this beer."
""
""
"Hazy light golden color with a huge frothy white head that persists forever before leaving tons of sticky lace. Tropical fruit and pine resin mixed with a bit of bready malt and a hint of sulfur make up the aroma. The flavor is bread and a hint of caramel with bits of resin and grapefruit. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. decent pale ale, I could drink this."
""
""
"8-bit pours a clear copper color with a large frothy lacing head. There is a nice mellow hop aroma, with some sweet notes. The taste has a nice full hoppy/floral taste, and finishes with a sweet flavor; rather balanced. Good full flavors, nice carbonation. Overall its a very full yet balanced pale ale."
""
""
""
"Overall real fun, hints at some slight large qualities, but is a playful easy drinker. I like the biscuity angle on this, with some faint hinting hop forward quality."
""
""
"O - You better believe I'm picking up a pack of these on my next run. Outstanding member of the Pale Ale family. Even better than some of the top dogs like Sierra Nevada and Boulevard.. Highly recommended."

"Not a bad take on the style. My first experience with Tallgrass, I'll have to keep my eye out for more of their cans."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: I will definitely be looking for more Tallgrass."
"Overall: This is a nice, refreshing pale ale. It's not bad by a long shot but it does seem one dimensional and lacks any ""wow factor"". It's a nice light ale that'd be nice in the summer though."
""
"O - Overall, this is a good balanced coiffing session beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another really solid brew from Tallgrass. Ethos is better, but this is a real solid American Pale Ale that I'd drink again."

"16oz can. Hazed copper with a fluffy and slightly off-white colored head. Thick sticky lacing down the sides. Smells floral and citric with some underlying herbal notes. Sweet grains along the back. Taste is similar, with a crisp and refreshing hop bite that spreads herbal flavors and pine out. An underlying grainy sweetness help keep the hops honest. Earthy bitterness sticks to the tongue. The mouthfeel is slick and creamy on the palate with some light crispness that tingles the tongue. This was a nice APA with lots of fresh hop flavors wrapped up in a quite drinkable package. Love the can graphic as well."
"I would like to re-rate this, because I believe I just got a bad batch considering the good flavors before the fatal flaw."

"Seek this out. I only wish it came in bottles so I could save the label"
"It has a nicely understated aroma that’s citrusy with a light spice. By itself the aroma isn't much but the flavor is just fantastic—it’s light, crisp and hoppy, with a lemony lime zest and a touch of pineapple with a hint of resin backed by a gentle malt that keeps the hops in check. Finishes clean and clear. It’s good."
""
""
"This is one of the most unique tasting beers I've had. Definitely worth the try. Pick it up if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I loved this great example of a very bright and hoppy APA. I could drink this all day. I have never seen this side of galaxy hops before, much less palate attacking and drying then I remember previously. Well done with this one Tallgrass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Satisfying. Enjoyable. Not mind-bending but very well done considering the ABV. Would have it again for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Easy drinking pale ale with a bit of citrus, a good introduction to hoppy style of beers."

"No matter how sleek the newer ones may look, there'll always be a soft spot in my heart for the old 8-bit games. Regardless, this stuff pours a clear amber-brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises grass, orange peel, light flowers, and a twinge of flaky biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with brighter veins of grass and orange peel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a very nice pale ale, nothing earth-shattering, but definitely something I'm happy to have available around here now."

"3rd can of the four pack - I drank the first 2 straight from the can & decided to formally review this one. It has a hazy golden/straw color, frothy white head, excellent head retention. Aromas are grass, grapefruit, lemon zest, biscuity grain, fresh, lemongrass. Tastes are toasted grain and bready malt coupled with dank, pungent hops, grapefruit rind, caramel, grass, lemon rind, pine - nice balanced complexity. Body is medium, creamy but resiny, bitterness lingers some. Overall, I really enjoyed this one - out of the can or from a glass it's a solid APA either way you drink it!"

"Tallgrass 8-Bit Pale Ale ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a nice pale ale that offers a bigger malt presence then most of the pale ale out there today. Extra points for a sweet can."
"I'm beginning an escapade back into brews in cans that is becoming the rage with brewing companies recently. Some, despite my optimism with beer, are not what I was hoping for. THIS, on the other hand, was astonishing for being an PA from a can. Smooth, refreshing and an aromatic head with thin lace. Being that I tried this on a whim from a local bar, my doubts about the up and coming ""micro-can race"" have been subsided for the time being due to this beer. Mad props to this PA and all other brews to come from Tallgrass!"
""
""
"This is an experience. I'm a malthead, so this is high praise from me. Pours to a big frothy white head that stays thick and leaves ample but erratic lacing. Aroma is spicy, fruity hops and toasty Munich malt. Flavor gets better as the beer warms up, with a complex blend of malts and tangy hops playing well together. Mouthfeel is light-medium. I'd say this is one of the best canned APAs you could hope to get your hands on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice canned pale ale with galaxy hops that I enjoy. Point brewery (WI) just came out with their Beyond the Pale IPA and I don't even know if I could distinguish these 2 apart in a blind taste test. If you get Point try it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 1UP for Tallgrass! From 8-Bit's awesome retro design to it's hop-forward aroma and flavor, this brew is nicely balanced for an easy drinking pale that packs a punch of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A basic Pale Ale with a light body, average hoppiness, and nice carbonation. The 8-bit has a decent malt character to it, but beyond that a pretty limited flavor profile. The hops here are pretty subdued, a little citrusy, but generally came across as pretty flat to me with little immediate bite or depth of flavor. Not a bad beer, but an average American style Pale Ale with a can that's more intriguing than the contents."

"O: I'm glad I dont have to drink this as my local APA everyday."
""
""
""
"16 oz. can. Pours a mainly clear, golden-orange color with a good, frothy off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is pale malts, a hint of biscuit, lemon, a bit of pine, and a hint of esters. Flavor is similar, a hint of bread, mainly lemon/citrus hops, and a bit of earthiness. Light-to-medium mouthfeel, dry, crisp, and a moderately bitter finish. Very good pale ale, quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O - Finishes a bit sweet for my liking with the hops not really getting much depth of flavor or aroma. Finish is kind of an ambiguous bitterness without much flavor other than pine."
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light to medium mouthfeel with ample carbonation. Pretty easy drinking and quite sessionable. Overall, I liked this pale ale quite a bit. Definitely one of the top Tallgrass brews, and one I will definitely drink again in the future."
""
""
""
""
"I do like the artwork, though, but other than that, I just can't get into this one."
""
""
""
"Well this is certainly a good pale, not my favorite but it is up there. I love that it is in cans, I beleive it helps keep the beer stay a lot fresher for longer. This one with definitaley be in my rotation of APA's/IPAs!"
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, golden/copper color. One and one half inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong floral hops, slight citrus hops, sweet malt, hint of pale malt, slight citrus, and a hint of grass. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, caramel malt, floral hops, citrus hops, hint of earthy malt, and a hint of grass. Overall, great appearance, blend, good body, and aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours, from the tap, a dark yellow color with a modest cap of foam. The aroma is floral and citrus hops. There is a distinct character here, which may be due to the heavy dose of Galaxy Hops. I don't quite know how to describe it other than bitter fruit, more melon than orchard fruit. This character continues onto the palate. A slight caramel aspect provides some balance, but again the unique hops character dominates. I don't know if I have ever had a beer that tastes quite like this. A pleasant offering from the folks at Tallgrass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Could have something nice here, add more hops!"
"One of the few micro-brews i have had in a can, first in a long time. To be honest it was the artwork of the can that made me buy this beer, reminded me of my childhood playing 8 bit video games. Smell is appearance are great, has a nice hop fragrance and a decent golden color. However the taste is very metallic, and the mouthfeel is watery, this beer is a let down to be honest. It has a very solid aroma and it looks appetizing, but it certainly falls short."
"Cheers!"
""
"D: good, not great. too much hop bitterness distracts from some of the pleasant hop flavor. plenty of malt also distracts in a way that i find unpleasant. stylistically to me this drinks more like an english bitter than an APA."
""
"O: A solid pale ale. Would have no problem drinking this one often if I could."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and some earthy and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors."
""
""
"O: An excellent APA for sure. Very balanced and drinkable. Hoppiness is a nice addition and bitterness isn't weak either. Just mild enough to be an APA. Tasty and enjoyable."
""
"Mouthfeel is great, drinkability is superb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with medium-level carbonation, creating a crisp and modestly soft mouthfeel. Closes dryly, as one would expect with the substantial hop bitterness in the aftertaste."
""
"Overall. Easy drinking pale with some great hops. Did I mention the kick ass can???? (Ya, I am a total geek...)."
""
""
"O - Very nice hop forward beer. Malt strikes a touch of balance but showcases hops very well. Beautiful looking beer as well."
""
""
"A very solid beer. Wonderful hop aroma, nice malty sweetness. Tone down the IBUS from 40 to maybe 30 and it's a more balance and soft pale ale that you could tear through all evening. I'm liking it, but this is totally a one beer an evening drink for me."
"8-Bit is a genuine and gracefull pale ale that is characterful enough to appease the most demanding hop heads, but also smooth enough to capture the taste buds of novices alike. I'd be happy to keep a six pack of these in my stable anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
"I seem to be a fan of Galaxy hops and 8-Bit has become a fridge favorite over the summer. A pale ale with big hops and flavor, neither of which are subtle, so these tallboys are great to feed that pesky hop demon that often growls for more."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Given how robust it is, I'll have to give this one a thumbs up. On sale at $7.99 a four pack of 16 ounce cans, it's a good deal. If they focus in the hop character a little more and balance the flavors it'll be a real winner. Would I drink it again? Maybe."
""
""
""
""
""
"This has the profile of Daisy Cutter, but lacks the quality. I was excited to try it, glad I did, but will be unlikely to purchase again."
"O: While it might not be among the top tier pales this is one of my favorites from Tallgrass. Love the 16oz can which is great for outdoor activities."
"This is a really nice and smooth pale ale and the citrus hops really kick in as the beer warms."
""
""
"O - Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. This is now by far one my favorite pale ales, plus the fact that it comes in tall boy cans is a huge bonus. Props to Tallgrass; they continue to wow me with their beers."
""
""
""
"Taste is big on both flavoring and bittering hops with a light malt base. The flavor profile definitely showcases the Galaxy hop, but maybe is a tad one-dimensional. The more I drink these SMaSH or Single Hop beers, the more I appreciate a solid, well conceived hop schedule. Or maybe Im just not a huge Galaxy fan...either way, I find this beer to be just average tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer seems quite heavy for a pale ale and is packed with interesting hop flavors. It is very enjoyable."
""
"Overall I want to thank TIMMYJ21 for this extra. Smell is not my thing but after finishing this 16oz can I am kind of a believer on this one. Pick it up if you get the chance."
""
""
""
"Good solid drinker. Will go well with my lunch of very fine ground beer grilled to perfection and corn on the cob. Mmmmm."
"O: This beer is quite enjoyable and very easy to drink. Definitely a great sessionable beer and one that I would get again (and recommend to others to give a try). Refreshing and very nice summer beer."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Solid pale ale. Not quite in the top echelon but it is a very good one. I really like Galaxy hops and they were definitely present here although it wasn't quite what I expected (with how much floral/herbal hop flavor was also present). Overall it is a winner although not quite on the level of the amazing (usually limited distribution) pale ales. Grab some for the summer."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a really good beer. I've been buying it regularly. It really works out well for the hot summer days when you don't want some thing that's too heavy. A tasty, thirst quenching pale ale."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very creamy. It's the strong suit of this beer. Some more hops with this feel would make this a really nice pale. As is, it's really quaffable and was exactly what I was looking for after a long afternoon in the sun. A good attempt, with a nice feel, that could fill in as a golf bag 4 pack in a pinch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: At first I was a little disappointed. However, it is growing on me; I like it more and more with each sip. It definitely makes up for the three and a half minutes of my life I wasted watching the beer’s YouTube video."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a nice bit of carbonation making each sip crisp and refreshing. The low alcohol content, crisp, refreshing feel and subtle and well-balanced flavoring make this an excellent session beer though a tad on the expensive side."
""
""
"O:  I love galaxy hops and it really adds a great character to brews. I will be doing a blind comparison between this and arrowhead from Marshall to see which I like better. This is one refreshing crisp beer that is a all around great beverage. "
""
"O- One of the best pale ales I've had in quite a while and interesting at that. The use of Galaxy hops brings something new and different to the beer, ironic considering the retro name."
""
""
""
""
"Smells and tastes very tropical (papaya, passionfruit, and mango), with a mostly sweet malt presence accompanied with some onion / garlic garnishes and medium levels of floral bouquet once the glass was allowed to warm up some towards room temp. Crisply carbonated, medium body and the finish adds a peppery hop aspect that complements the tropical fruit salad quite nicely. Still, if you don't like your Pale Ales sweet and fruity, you most certainly won't like this one. It can get cloying if you don't take your time properly with it."
""
"This Galaxy hop is both unique and pleasant to the palate. I like the bitter dominance of the beer, the lack of malty sweetness. I still think this reminds me alot of a Belgian Pale Ale, one of my favorite styles, so perhaps that's why I am digging it. Recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Easily an above average Pale Ale. I would gladly recommend. Loved the can art too...."
"Very delicious beer. Definitely a hit from Tallgrass."
""
""
""
"Overall – Good packaging, great taste, sessionable, very good-looking, what isn’t to like about this brew? I actually drank my first one straight out of the can, and liked it so much I decided to actually pour another one and review it. I didn’t have any intention of reviewing a beer tonight, but this one was just too good. Excellent job by Tallgrass, probably one of my new favorite APA’s out there!"
"O: I was expecting a lot more hop action out of this beer, especially considering it's Galaxy hopped, but there is just the slightest hint of that juicy tropical fruit that Galaxy is known for and I only think I picked up on it because I was searching for it. Otherwise, it's a decent drinker. Took some to a BBQ and it was simplistic enough to not scare away the BMC drinkers and it seemed to pair with all of the food just fine."
"Overall- 8-Bit Pale Ale is an easy drink with an interesting mix of hop flavors thanks to our little green friends from New Zealand. If they made more of an impression on the palate and the nose, the beer would have made a much greater impression with me."
""
""
""
"Overall: The beer did take me back to the day the Atari 2600 was released and that's a great memory. I enjoyed my APA and found it to be an easy drinking and was looking for the malt flavor to be more noticable. I may even make a cheddar soup with this."
"Great Job Tallgrass! This is my favorite brew from these guys. Go Atari, NES and Sega."
""
""
"Nice light smooth easy drinker. Still lots of flavor. Can't go wrong here. Probably won't blow beer nerds away, but I could drink this guy all day long."
""
""
""
"Cool can. Bright gold with big swamp bubbles of white foam. Pour carefully or expect a clump of beer-clouding yeast to plop into the glass. I was expecting to be blasted by Galaxy hops, but instead find a nicely balanced pale ale. Lightly grainy malt with a biscuit note stands about evenly with the citrus and melon from the Galaxy. All around solid and fairly unique, not to mention it comes in cans, which are great for warm weather."

"Big thanks goes out to Bobby91w for sending this one my way in a recent trade as an extra! I’ve heard good things, so let’s do this! Served from can into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Poured a golden yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that remained throughout. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, wild onion, onion hop, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, onion hop, spicy hop, earth, wild onion, and subtle orange zest. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This brew really shocked me as far as all of the elements going on in it. It kind of reminded me of a toned-back Gubna in a way only in Pale Ale form. This is definitely a good thing incase you were wondering… The aromas coming off of this thing smelled intense enough to be an IPA, but still delicate enough to give the hint that it is a Pale Ale. Really well done on this aspect. The flavor was quite nice and refreshing as well with a little bit of spicy hoppiness biting you on the followthrough. Definitely worth your time seeking this one out to try at least once. I’m glad that I did."
"This poured out as a clear looking yellow color. The head was a little fizzy and white. Didn't leave much retention. The smell of the beer was hoppy with some malts shining through. The taste was on the bitter side, nothing too strong like an IPA would be. There was a slight sweetness in the beginning of each sip. The mouthfeel has a pretty sharp feeling carbonation to it. Overall the beer is drinkable, it's not something that really impressed me but it's decent."
"This is very easy to drink but not a great APA. I would buy this again iif some of my ""go tos"" were not availible"

"First off, I gotta say that this is one of the coolest cans I've seen. Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy yellowish gold, dense white heads that retains as a thin coating leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma starts with lemon and grass with a bit of bread coming through as it progresses. The flavor is similar to the nose with the addition of some caramel sweetness. The hops balance out the sweetness with a swift bitter finish of citrus and a touch of pine. The body is light to medium with an appropriate level of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent pale ale with some similarities to Daisy Cutter. The Galaxy hops don't shine through like I was hoping, but then again, I don't know how fresh this can is."

"Nice APA in a cool looking can. Love the galaxy hops and they really let them shine. The yeast is recognizable from the rest of the line up. Very good overall. The citrus really comes out when warm."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy bright orange color. The head is a massive two inches in height, and recedes slowly into a firm inch cap of bright white foam. This is one handsome looking beer. The aroma is of stone fruit, passion fruit, tangerines, and flower bed. There is a lot going on in this aroma, and it is also quite strong for the size of this beer. The taste is a bit drier than the aroma leads on, but I am really liking that. There is ample passion fruit and stone fruit with some nice floral notes rounding out the back end. The malt is present, but soft. It supports the hops well, and really lets them shine. There is a nice assertive bitterness in the finish, but it is well integrated into the beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is the best pale ale I've ever drank. I can't see how this beer could possibly be improved on. It is sure to become a regular in my refrigerator."

"Picked up a 4 pack. Nice looking can to this old Atari fan. This is a good quality drinkable pale ale. The hops seem more pilsner-like than citrusy, but that doesn't detract. Nice balance of sweetness and dryness. Good."

"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is crisp and easily approachable. A well rounded brew without much wow factory beyond the fact that it is easily drinkable. It boasts just enough hop flavoring to keep me interested throughout the duration. I could see myself firing back a few of these effortlessly in the summer. Not bad. Thanks Jason!"
"Pretty good APA. Very nice citrus notes with a good malt backbone. Solid brew."

"I have been ""experimenting"" with fruity alcopops of late for reasons unbeknown even to me (I hate when my brain starts keeping secrets), but one whiff of this fruity little gem and I knew I was back where I belong. The Crack & Glug was unremarkable and the pour produced just over a finger of fluffy, bone white head with good retention. Color was a hazy orangish-yellow, suggesting a) non-filtering (good) and b) CAN-[CAN]ditioning (better). The nose was tropical fruity and I cheated and looked at a descriptor for Galaxy hops which mentioned ""passionfruit"". I am not sure that I ever ate it or smelled it, so I feel partially unqualified to comment. It was definitely fruity on the nose, however, and in a natural, not chemically-added esters, way. It seemed to just open up like a flower on my tongue! I got an initial sweet fruitiness followed by a rush of grapefruit. Yow! I have a special place in my cooler for Hula In the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually) for something like this. I am planning a trip to the beach this summer with the stated intent of getting me and everyone around me krunked, This will help! Yo, I'm licking my lips like Pac-Man, you hear? Finish was a reminder of why I became a hophead in the first place. Fruity, partially dry with the citrus hops, yummy in my mouth and tummy. I am hereby giving notice - The CANQuest (TM) is back!"
"Nice mouthfeel: it's lightly sweet and wet, with a soft carbonation tingle. Overall, this is a very solid APA. With a few tweaks it could enter into the conversation of some of the Midwest/Plains best APAs."
"Overall easy drinking, easily sessionable. Will have to seek out a fresher sample to compare, as it seems to be lacking the distinctive tropical/citrus notes of Galaxy hops, but is still solid and well put together."
"Thanks again to cpolking for sending this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is floral, some malts as well. Taste is a good hop/malt balance, a light citrus flavor, easy drinking. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality beer."
"Good flavor for a pale ale-starts out with a slight sweetness from the malt but quickly gives way to a fleshy fruit note from the hops and a lingering, but not overpowering, grassy/piny bitter finish. Very drinkable and the body is near-perfection. Crisp, well-carbonated, juicy, medium-thin body. Everything I want in a Pale Ale. Overall, a very well made beer from Tallgrass. Easy drinking on a warm Austin spring afternoon."

"O= This is a solid Pale Ale and with big flavor. Works very nicely for the ABV and will be a go to during the summer for me with how easy it is to drink. Really good melding of flavors and a great look at galaxy hops. The can art isn't bad either."
""
""
"This thing isn't pushing the envelope in any respects, but the Galaxy hops definitely make this a somewhat unique pale in my mind. It's tasty, smells good and it's very drinkable, making this a fantastic summer beer."
"O: Another nice beer from Tallgrass; I can never get enough hoppy canned beers--so thanks Tallgrass"
""
"O- Pretty unimpressive pale ale, the flavor and aroma just arn't there. Would not buy again."
""
"An enjoyable and slightly unique pale ale. Definately worth a try and I certainly will buy it occasionally."
""
""
"There's a strong possibility this is the best beer yet from Tallgrass. Really enjoyable."
"It's a tasty treat."
""
""
""
"Win! Load up the flavor in this easily sessionable beer."
"O: Not a particularly good pale ale. The veggie flavors are a bit distracting and detrimental to the beer as a whole. I love the can, though."
"Overall, I don't like this beer. It is more bitter than the taste would suggest. There should be much more flavor here. I just don't get this beer. I even like galaxy hops so I expected much more from this beer."
""
"O - This is a solid pale ale! It's very drinkable and the hop presence doesn't overwhelm you like the bigger abv beers."
""
"Overall: A very solid take on a American Pale Ale. Hops are nicely sharp and crisp and the malts add a nice bready taste."
"I should buy more Tallgrass, because it's good stuff, & this brew is no exception. The use of the hops is just lovely, restrained, & gives the beer a gorgeous profile. Excellent beer that I'll grab again. Hope it keeps coming through fresh."

"golden yellow pour with generous amounts of head. smells of pilsner malt, honey, citrus (lemon), floral hops. tastes bitter up front with a sweet malty backbone - a bit of honey flavor and grassy. medium body and well carbonated. lacing stayed til the end of the glass. a very nice and refreshing ale, more of an ipa than an apa which is right up my alley. also, awesome artwork on the can."
""
"O: Really solid and refreshing beer. Nice hop characteristics without being as pungent and in your face as the big IPA/DIPAs I usually gravitate towards."

"Light bodied with average carbonation, and a lemon with biscuit malt aftertaste. Finishes dry. Not a completely bad beer, but not my favorite combination of flavors either. Guess I'm not a big fan of Galaxy hops."
"Overall, a decent pale ale. I'll be honest -- I bought it because the can is pretty cool. A tad too unbalanced, if there were just a hint of more malts it would be really good."
"Overall, this is a very good APA. Is it my favorite? Probably not, but there are a lot of good APAs out there that I've had the pleasure of trying. This one certainly can hang up there with some of the top rated ones, though. Thank you very much to TIMMYJ21 for this as an extra in our recent trade!"

"O: Great drinkability. May be my new go too summer session beer. Love the lower abv. The can design is pretty damn sweet too."
""

"Good summer beer. Wasn't looking for anything spectacular and didn't get it, but I would go back to 8-bit for schizzle."
"I was almost sold by the look and the smell, but the taste didn't really do it for me. Smells like delicious hops, tastes like un-delicious hops. Don't plan on drinking too much of this."
"Notes: Moderate in body, with a soft mouthfeel. Flavor is intense, but finishes extremely clean. 8-Bit is a very easy-to-drink brew, and quite tasty. One of my favorite Tallgrass offerings thus far."

"16oz. can served in a SA perfect pint glass. Poured a clear, pale gold with a couple of fingers of fine bubbled white head. Lots of tropical fruit in the aroma. Very fragrant. A little bready malt. Light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Not as bitter as the aroma would suggest, but there is a fair amount of hop bitterness. Bit of drying mouth pucker in the finish. Very drinkable."
""
"Overall - One sip and you'll know that Tallgrass has a winner with their 8-Bit Pale Ale. It's light on the palate with a lot of great flavor and a crisp finish with just the right amount of bite to be super refreshing and draw you back in for more. This could be a go to beer as the weather begins to warm. Excellent work Tallgrass!"
""
"O- very session able very tasty with hops and slight malts creamy finish very good"
"Overall, pretty good. I could certainly see myself having a few of these. Good balance of flavors and a well hopped pale ale for hop heads like me."
"Overall: Nice APA that actually manages to be original in a category that is usually pretty straightforward. I hope this raises awareness and sales for Tallgrass, who, while hit or miss in my opinion, definitely hit at least a triple with this one."
"A hop forward pale ale with some unique hop flavor. Kind of between a pale and an IPA. Maybe closer to the latter. This will make a nice warm weather drinker."
"Mouth feel: Light mouth feel, not heavily carbonated."
""
"Overall - The label says a hop-rocketed pale ale, which is a good description. A definite on my ""must buy again"" list. Now to find it on tap..."
"O - This is a really good pale ale. Tallgrass keeps getting better and better with each new brew."
