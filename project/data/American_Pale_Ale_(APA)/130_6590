The smell was very faint with only some hops coming through in some grass scents. The taste was nice with grass, grapefruit, and some orange peel coming through from the hops, but it didn't last and I wasn't a fan of the aftertaste which was sticky sweet. Overall it was good, but I would have preferred more hop flavor.","WhiteHillsStore","Feb 19, 2015"

Flavor reveals deeply toasted malt and caramel, nutty tones at the base, with a moderately bitter finish. Notes of grapefruit and tangerine add complexity. Hop dominant in aroma and flavor, with enough malt character to attract the non-hoppy crowd. The finish is floral hop heavy. A nice compromise between malt and hop character.","barczar","Nov 09, 2014"

Color was good, head was really nice, mouthfeel was good, but it didn't tickle my tongue the way I was expecting. No numbness or bitterness on the back of my throat. Tasted like it was watered down.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, pine hop, citrus, spicy hop, earth, and earth hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, pine hop, cream, spice, earth, and earth hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I actually went into this brew not expecting to like it very much. However, I actually found something that I rather enjoyed. The hop profile going on in the aroma on this one was actually quite nice. The flavor however fell a little short though with the cream and spiciness aspect. I really wish that the creamy aspect I picked up on would not have been present as it really stole a lot from the flavor. Glad I got the chance to try this one finally after I have seen it for so long. I suggest you do the same if you get the opportunity.","thagr81us","Nov 21, 2012"

Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, mango, pine, herbal, caramel, toast, and light earth. Very nice aromas with nice balance and complexity. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, herbal, floral, pine, mango, caramel, toast, grass, and light earth. Fair amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, herbal, floral, toast, grass, caramel, and light earth on the finish for a bit. Great hop flavor balance and complexity; with a good malt backbone. No cloying flavors at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice pale ale. Great hop flavor profile and flavor balance; and very smooth to drink as expected of 4.85%. No complaints here, very enjoyable stuff.","superspak","Sep 17, 2012"

3.57,-2.2,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"The beauty of the craft beer in a can revolution is that camp-outs are no longer the bland, bloating lite-beer blah-fests they used to be. Still, just because it is craft in a can doesn't make it great for a camp out. This beer is the perfect example of that; not terrible, but certainly not remarkable. Think of it as the craft beer in a can you take in reserve for that late night poker game, but not the one you enjoy floating down stream. The one good camp-out quality to it is its relatively low ABV; at 4.85%, you won't be napping your way through the afternoon after a few of these in the hot sun.","TheHoppiest","Jun 05, 2012"

4.02,10.1,4,4.5,4,3,4,"Pours an amber color. As the title states it is a very hazy pale ale, even with a gentle pour and having spent some serious time in the fridge. Off white head that is holding nicely. Smells Awesome-o. Very piney and grapefruity. Clear a good dose of tasty hops for the dry hopping. It did smell way more pungent when opened and then dissipated. Hoppiness pretty much dominates the flavor. Very American tasting hops (resinous, piney, citrusy, floral). Really just a touch of sweetness from malt. Yeast is fruity and again very American tasting. I suppose pale ales are open to being this thin, but for me the body tastes a bit thin. Although the bitterness really punches through because of the thin body. Pretty good beer, I've always liked this one.","mlazzaro","Nov 19, 2011"

3.52,-3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Let's have another random taste at Bliss, shall we? This one pours a hazy sunset amber topped by a finger of lightly dirty white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, pine, orange zest, lemon peel, very light lime zest, very light caramel, and plenty o' flowers. Not bad-smelling at all. The taste comes in very similarly, focusing on the pine and flowers, and bringing in some dark greens and a bunch o' balsa planks. It's almost too hoppy for its own good. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very dry finish. Almost too dry. Overall, an okay pale, but they went too far with the hops without thinking about what they would do in tandem with each other. (In other words, there needs to be a helluva lot more balance in here for it to really work).","TMoney2591","Aug 05, 2011"

Smells solely of fresh hops: citrus zest, pine trees, and herbal aromas. Interestingly, the taste of the hops is subdued with malt flavors taking over. There is also a slight metallic taste that I assume is from the can. Mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a medium body with a bubbly but slightly thick moutfeel.

The smell was a little hoppy and had some malts in the background a slight floral aroma was there too. The taste was mostly hoppy but nothing too strong in flavor.

Hop aroma is very prevalent. Centennial is prominent for me. Thick off white to light amber head. Fantastic lacing. Taste has a slight sweetness behind the bready/malty taste. The overall flavor is a bit on the weak side. Will re-evaluate when it gets closer to room temps. Possibly a bit too cold now to let flavor potential fully shine.

The head sat atop the pint glass for several minutes before crumbling upon itself. It's very hoppy for the alcohol percentage. In the nose you are hit with hops before getting honey and carmel malt. It's very dry and has some floral aspects to it. It's definitely appealing and very aromatic. The flavors aren't as sharp as they are out of the bottle. It's only lightly hoppy and has a good amount of malt to it. It's sweetness is comparable to honeycream. Something is off though. It's a mellower version of this beer from a bottle. The mouthfeel too is off. It's very watery and isn't crisp like it should be. This beer would normally give me cotton mouth but it's so watery that it's actually quenching my thirst.

The citrus hops are very present in the initial taste too, with a more piney hoppiness in transition to bittersweet finish. Clear grapefruit rind bitterness in the aftertaste is largely absent, and not missed, in this ale. Rich, bold, fresh taste.

Nose was really piney, like a cold day in the middle of a forest and taking a deep breath. That's living! Mouthfeel was medium with an appropriate amount of hops for the style (but not necessarily for me) in the mouth. Finish was likewise hoppy, stylistically correct, but lacking the Ooomph to make me really want a lot of it.

Smooth nose, big malt presence with cocoa, carob, toffee and peanut butter, meager display of tangerine zest, little more pine, even more flower petals, gives you one solid burst of peach, apricot fruit scents, again, very fluid presence. Light to medium-bodied, here it is also demure and at times almost shy. Very active tight prickle to the carbonation, keeps the mouth scrubbed clean. This heightens the tangerine, orange, lime citrus. Earthy, plays well with the pine and tamer herbaceous elements. Honey replaces a lot of the cocoa, caramel flavors, malts and hops well-balanced against each other.

It may not be at its freshest state so my review may be slightly skewed, but what the brewery seemed to try and do with this beer was make a sessionable APA with a big hop profile sufficient enough to satisfy the hop heads out there. For me, the sessionability (which stems from the thin mouthfeel and low ABV) takes away from the ""massive secondary hop infusion"" by diluting the whole experience, from smell to taste. I'd give it another go if I had a chance, but I can think of several Canadian-made APA's that will satisfy me for the time being.","ludachris","Oct 26, 2010"

It has a great aroma from that dry hopping that smells like oranges and just hoppy to put it plainly but the taste isn't really all that bitter. It has the hop taste but then the malt takes over which is an okay malt taste. Maybe a bit watery because of the low alcohol content??? but Samuel Adams Boston Lager is about the same abv and to me thats more full bodied and a better malt backing. The flavoring hops are nice and save this beer in my opinion. I guess its not that bitter because its a pale ale but Sierra Nevada I'd say I like better. The aroma is great but you don't drink the aroma.

This wasn't detrimental as I felt it married itself to the pine and citrus in a pretty productive manner. Pretty refreshing with a clean finish for me.

The lacing is excellent, sticks to the glass even after the session is over. The smell is absolutely phenomenal. The second you crack the bottle open you can smell the hops. You can really smell a powerful citrus hop aroma emanating from the glass, the dry hop is really prevalent when you smell it. The taste is good but a slight disappointment because the smell was so outstanding. The mouthfeel is good, the texture turns out a little dry at the end, but still very good, and the drinkablilty is good as well.

The nose is somewhat mild but definitely floral, with a touch of coriander and, perhaps, a hint of cinnamon (or is that liquid soap?). The mouth is rather light and mildly prickly, not at all cloying. The taste is both spicey and floral, reminiscent more of anis than cinnamon. The flavor is not overwhelmingly bitter, but rather just a bit espresso-dry in the finish, leading to an aftertaste that nicely blends the spice and the bitter.

Off the keg this beer was a dark apricot color with a big beige head that clung defiantly to the glass. The aroma was bold, hoppy and complex, orange zest, grapefruit, pine and some hints of sweetened malt. The flavors were equally vibrant, a sweet malt start quickly met by big, citrus hops. Great balance and very juicy, the grapefruit and orange really came through along with undertones of pineapple. The finish was crisp and dry. The body was medium/full, the carbonation a little high but acceptable and the mouthfeel slick.

The beer poured with a two finger white head that stayed for the beer and laced down the sides. The smell was a hit of hops. The aroma was dominated by citrus but had slight floral notes as well. The taste had immediate hop bitterness and had a distinct grapefruit taste. The beer then settled sweet on the tongue and finished with a floral note. The beer had good body but the higher sugar content left a sticky feeling in the mouth after the sip.

Smell is quite aromatic,pine, nice citrus bouquet with a toasty maltiness in the background. T&M--nice solid melon, slightly sour grapefruit taste leaves a mild bitterness. Malt is sort of lingering in the background, and really doesn't establish itself. That' OK because this beer is still very well balanced and is also very drinkable. D- Excellent!! This isn't your typical pale ale, It's quite aromatic and also quite hoppy but it has a great balance and it's very refreshing. Overall , a very drinkable beer from Boulder.

When poured into a pint glass, the beer formed a large foamy head that dry hopped ales seem to be pretty good at. The head was thick enough to form a volcano cone above the rim of the glass. The body was amber in color and looked a shade or two darker than the average APA. It was however pretty clear, and did not exhibit much of the touted haze until I vigorously swirled the last bits of beer into the glass. The smell was hops of the pungent, earthy, resinous, and a little smoky kind. The taste of the beer let me down after all that buildup. It was not very bitter, and seemed to have a peaty, sour, and chalky taste. These flavors typically work well in a Scotch or old Ale, but the body here was too thin to have them be the main attraction. I am glad I got to try it, and finishing the six pack will be no big deal, but it's not all that I was hoping for, and I will probably not seek it out again.","rajendra82","Jun 18, 2008"

The grapefruity tanginess was missing, and it left one with a dryish hop bite that was uninteresting. The balance is off with this beer. There are too many caramel notes, too much subdued brown sugar hints, and too much lack of carbonation to make this a beer coming back to.

The smell and taste are quite ""grass-y"" and actually it tasted like an IPA to me. If you like that distinctive hop taste this is not a bad beer to drink.

Hints of spicy, citrusy hops come through as it warms, as well as a pale, malty note. Above average for a pale ale, but not amazing. The medium-thin body is nicely carbonated, bitter at times, and finishes with a crisp and refreshing bite. All in all, this is a pretty decent beer. Sure, its not the most in-your-face flavor rush that some of us seek, but as far as drinkability goes (and price, for that matter), it holds its own.","wagenvolks","Dec 29, 2007"

Aroma is big on the hops. Definite grapefruit and lemon, bit of pine and just a slight hint of bread. Taste is much the same with big citrus fruits coming off. Lots of grapefruit/lemony tartness. I was surprised that there wasnt much bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel was very dry. I think this is one of the better offerings from Boulder.","hwwty4","Dec 28, 2007"

Flavor is also strong; grassy hoppiness up front followed by a big malty mouthfeel which gradually tails off and recedes pretty quickly.

3.18,-12.9,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Enjoyed out of a standard pint glass. Pours a very pleasant, hazy, orangey copper with a creamy-white, two finger, short-lived head; lacing left all over the glass. Aroma is immediately of strong hops: floral and spicy. I could smell the hops as soon as I cracked the bottle. Taste is a little lacking. I thought there would be more hop flavor, instead I was hit with too much bitterness and not enough flavor. Citrus and grassy notes, but not a good balance. Mouthfeel is a little thin and slick with a noticeably astringent aftertaste. Very smooth, but the bitterness is going to limit me to 1 or 2 at a time. Overall, I think this beer's bark (smell) is worse (more deceiving) than its bite (taste).

It's distinct enough that I could see either coming around on it, or it clicking for some people and really loving it, so I'm not not recommending it, but it sure doesn't do it for me.

Some apple coming through. Tastes great  all of the hops are very flavorful without being too strong. Floral & herbal with a slight bitter/earthy finish.

No surprise that hops are at the forefront, largely citrus by some floral as well. While I expected the hops were largely masking the malts, the taste suggests that the malts are lacking in general. While that imbalance is unfortunate, the effect is moderated by the fact that this beer is relatively light in body. The hops aren't clingy or astringent, but that doesn't make up for the lack of a decent malt base. Reasonably drinkable but not particularly inspiring.","BitteBier","Feb 26, 2007"

I thought there would be more carbonation, and while I would have liked more action, smooth and crisp is nice. Taste is good, with lots of hops, crisp and piney and citric, a kind of apple thing going. The malts are pretty much completely disguised, so much hop going on.

The taste is also very fresh and 'hoppy', it is like someone just picked the hops and barley and tossed them in the brew.

It's like a cross between fresh hops and great Indian food, which I think this would complement really nicely.

The smell is fresh, hoppy and wonderful, citrus and spruce balanced by a moderate, doughy malt backbone. The taste is a big-time hop-attack. It has an initial sting of firey citrus, and then it subsides very briefly to let the malts add their 2 cents, but those flavors are quickly drowned by a tidal wave of citrus and pine hop flavors. But then something goes a bit off late on the finish. No, its not off, just weak. I think its just too far out of balance. Strange because the smell and the early flavors a bit more balanced than the finish. It has a medium body, dry texture and soft carbonation.

There is a bit of chewy grapefruit hop flavor that fades in towards the end, but by then it's too late. Moderately light body, and it's really fizzy across the tongue.

This pours a mildly hazed, amber body with a large, rocky, offwhite head. Good retention and clingly clumps of lace are left on the glass. Aroma is all hops, but are smooth and citrusy, mostly fresh peeled orange. Grassy and lemony hop notes are in the background. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Taste underwhelms with orange and pink grapefruity hops. Caramel and pale malt sweetness is very understated. Nothing really special here, as the hops and malts are both restrained. The result is an extremely drinkable and well balanced ale that is highly sessionable. I could knock down several of these if I were thirsty.","merlin48","Feb 28, 2005"

The flowery hops and fruit/sweet filled the nose ending with a slight bitter, perhaps white pine. The taste was smooth, crisp, light, with a lot of hops. These hops are more aligned with the nose - more their subtle essence, flowery, versus the bitter. The carbonation and dryness rise this up to the soft palate and finishes. I found this finish a bit thin and just prior ""watery"". Once the mouthful was gone there was no palate memory of the first 2/3rds of the taste. Despite, this beer is quite drinkable and I appreciated the recommmendation to meet this subtle/flowery quality of hops.","yoko","Feb 27, 2005"

Beautiful Centennial hop aroma with just enough malt sweetness to compliment the floral hop notes. Fairly bitter on the palate, but with enough malt to support it. However, theres a dry, earthy note to this beer. There have been a few other beers over the years that have a similar woodiness to them. It's probably either the crystal hops or the yeast, and I like Rogue Brutal Bitter, so I'm leaning towards the yeast. Not sure though. Anyway, it has a solid mouthfeel but the woodiness detracts from the drinkability and taste.","aaronh","Feb 24, 2005"

The nose is like placing your face in a pile of hop flowers (and Ive done it at the Hop Head Throw-Down). It just fills your nose with the citrus and pine characters. The taste is like biting into a grapefruit. This beer is not about balance (although the malt is there in the form of caramel to temper the hops). The mouth feel is full, and slightly slick.

4.34,18.9,4,5,4,4,4.5,"What first comes to mind for me is that this beer is very hoppy in flavor and aroma, but not overly bitter, which leaves it very drinkable! It's hazy orange-copper body is capped by a short head of frothy ivory foam that holds well and leaves nice splashes of lace about the glass. The nose is bright with floral, piney, and citrusy hops that override whatever malt is underneath. It's just mildly crisp and then smooth in the mouth with a very fine-bubbled, median carbonation; and a medium-light body. The flavor delivers more malt than the nose suggests (although there's a bit less than expected); and it's hop flavors ride silkily along atop a lightly caramelish and biscuity malt. It's nicely balanced to display its hoppy flavor atop a delicate maltiness and reigned-in bitterness. It's not an IPA, and yet it gives every impression of one except for the larger maltiness, heavier bitterness, and higher alcohol content. They've done an exceptional job of getting the hops in here; and I certainly hope that this beer isn't overshadowed by some of the bigger beers out there. It's drinkable, dammit!!!

This brew is so hazy that it makes it hard to see anything through the glass (which to me isn't such a good thing for an APA or IPA for that matter). Aromas are very pleasant with mixed tones of hop that first start off smelling of fresh picked hops of the vine, and then move towards a more piney, slightly citrus like aroma. There is also just a slight hint of malt in the background. The flavor to this brew starts off nicely citrusy and hoppy but soon loses its body and flavor. There is a period within the middle of this brew where the malts start to shine through, but then an almost watered down taste follows where there is a void in flavor. There is patches of fresh hop flavor that come through here and then, but overall there is just something lacking in this brew. The finish is slightly bitter, citrusy and hints of malt, but the poor middle flavors of this brew still stick in my mouth. Overall a mediocre brew that for all the hype and designs on the bottle, surely needs more body to become anything worthwhile to drink.

In fact, it went very well with the soy-orange-ginger glazed grilled pork chops I had for dinner. Avg. alcohol content makes me think I could do another 22 oz. in a hearbeat.

What I like is that neither is overwhelming, and that really contributes to the nice and smooth mouthfeel. The finish is hoppy but still leaves you thirsting for more.

More malt would give the beer some more desperately needed body and would most certainly support the free-standing hops and lend this Eunuch Pale Ale some much needed Balls.

Nice grapefruity hops, sharp yet not overpowering. Toward the back some rustic malt flavor becomes evident, perhaps a bit heavier with malt at this point than most hoppy pale ales. Pushes the border on robustness close, but not quite to, IPA territory. A pleasant quaffer for the hops-inclined.","Brent","Feb 07, 2004"

Aroma is very grapefuity, citrus hop with a minor background of medium malt. Flavor is not quite as hoppy as aroma would indicate. I assume the dry hops give of more aroma than taste. Very nice balance of medium malt and hop spiciness. Back has a nice bitter, spicy alcohol kick. Only distraction is little a bit of mineral water flavor on the finish.

Up front, a massive dose of hops (centennial?). Great amound of grapefruit, plum, grapes and apple peel notes in the body, combined with a tender malt backbone. Hop presence off the cuff, this is borderline on an IPA.

Admirable retention, a loose, soapy cap remained throughout my slow sipping of this lovely beverage. Modest, thin lacing. Looks very agreeable in my glass. The first whiff immediately tells me this is going to a hoppy treat. Pine needles galore with flowery notes underneath, grapefruit rinds too. On-tap I found the nose soft, like pineapples in bitterness with a strong resemblance to Bells Two Hearted Ale. But poured from a bottle, it is much different, better Id say, a hell of a lot hoppier! The palate is raw, bitter; piney hops throughout, grapefruit, a smidge of general fruitiness here and there. Only for a brief moment towards the finish is a note of caramel malts detectable. This beer is not balanced; it doesnt try, the bitterness bite is modest but strong enough. The mouthfeel is a touch oily and slick; the carbonation is low, Id like to feel a tickle more but Im not complaining. Hazed & Infused is a great Pale Ale, it is only second to Alpha King. The best part is I bought a six-pack of this in Omaha the last one. :-(","bditty187","Nov 23, 2003"

Slight grass, but little else. Taste is also a little simple, pale malt body with a crystal hop bittering end. The aromatic qualities translate to little hop flavor, so a palette drying bitterness is the hop offering.

On top of all that is a nice citrus and flower aroma. This beer is quite tasty. Up front there is a piney taste which mellows out into a nice hoppy flavor.

Contrary to the assertive hop nose, the hop profile in flavor is surprisingly well rounded and balanced relative to malt sweetness. Moderate hop bitterness upfront in flavor is ensued by a pronounced hop flavor comprised of a concomitant presence of pine, grapefruit, and spicy citrus peel. Crystal hops shine brightly and persist throughout. Malt character is mostly of lately surfacing biscuit and token caramel. A bit light in body, perhaps somewhat thin. Finishes clean, with fading notes of bread and citrus. Hazed & Infused is a delicious pale. Malt character is average, but the hop profile is striking. Wonderfully drinkable.

Smooth malt body that holds the brew up all the way through with just the slightest diacetyl notes in the background. Just enough piney and floral hop bitterness to not go over the top like so many APAs do. Not that I am complaining about over the top APAs because I love them but this is truly a very nicely balanced version of the brew. Perfect medium body that provides for a great ease of drinking but enough to make you feel like you are drinking something. Smooth malt characteristics make this glide across the tongue.
