"Absolutely Phenomenal Beer! Wish it was easier to find! Mainly sold by the Keg"
""
""
""
""
""
"Clearly not one to pass by. Aggressively hopped with a complex bitterness that just keeps growing. Pine, citrus and resin flavirs are pronounced while the malt takes the back seat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great take on a pale ale and I would seek this out again. I can't put this ahead of Hoppy Birthday just because of my love for IPAs but this is definitely in the top 3 pale ales I've ever had."
""
""
""
"This is an outstanding pale ale, definitely one of the best but not thee best imo until I try pseudosue. This just explodes with hop flavor and finishes with honey and I want to say toffee/caramel. Not as piney as some of the west coast ipa's I am use to, but I like this flavor profile much more. Only complaint here is the nose, which is definitely lacking although something I can live without."
""
""
"I had been wanting to get my hands on this for a while, and I was worried my anticipation would lead to a classic case of unmet expectations. Nope. I waited until the last bottle of my 6-pack to review it, as I didn't want to let my initial euphoria influence my rating unjustly. Pale ale, IPA, call it whatever you want. This beer is a work of art in every way. I wanted to find a reason not to rate it a 5, but I'd have been lying to myself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good but nothing special. The label art definitely outdoes the quality of the brew for me. Love the name and love the design, sadly do not love the beer. Definitely something you need to try once tho!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite APA's and easy to get with a little bit of work here in Indiana."
""
""
""
""
"I had this on tap at three floyds and it is the real deal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Heaven in a bottle.... My absolute favorite.  Lucky to live in a city where it's not impossible to find with a little digging and a connection or two.  If you've never had the chance to enjoy Zombie, do what you've got to do to get your hands on some.  You won't be disappointed."
""
""
""
"Amazing! My tongue loved this beer I just want more and more it's so good on draft"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally able to get a hold of this beer.  Great Citra hop aroma and good flavor.  Glad I got a Six pack."
""
"Don't let the hype tell you that this is one of the finest beers ever made, but also make no mistake that this is a good beer and maybe a great one. I think its telling that if I could just walk into a liquor store and pick this up on the regular I would, especially in the summer months."
"Exceptional balance.  This beer will dominate you and ruin your future."

"I have had this 3X now and just have never been impressed with it..."
""
""
""
""
"They suck getting this out to us...but it is top shelf .... But there are a ton of great beers ... Sorry 3 Floyds, but unless you start taking care of your fans...I'm out"
"What's the big deal? I think Miller Lite tastes better!"
""
"Great color, crisp taste, just an amazing pale ale. Damn good beer all around."
""
"Real sharp and crisp.    Need to try a bunch more to get a good handle on this beer.  Will be getting more.  Did NOT taste or smell like Psuedo Sue at all!!"
""
""
""
""
"Clean fresh look with a very distinct aroma. It's not my favorite smell, but it's a definite branding of the beer, it makes it special and very unique. The initial taste is exactly like the smell, unique and natural.  It's bold and direct and demands my attention. I don't know that I trust it, but I believe it. It's not my usual taste for beer, but I damn well appreciate it. Much like my boss, it's not my favorite but it's a leader and knows what it's doing."
""
""
"O - Really amazing. The aroma knocked me off my feet, wasn't expecting that. Very solid, looking forward to finishing the sixer."
""
""
""
"Overall: A top 3 beer in my books. May even be a bargain compared to most 6-pack of this quality."
""
""
""
""
""
"A really good pale ale, maybe overrated but certainly strong all around beer none the less."
""
""
"Draft pour into tulip.  Medium Amber with light chill haze.  Delicious west coast character with excellent balance between aroma and flavor.  Also excellent balance with the bitterness and the malt.  Nice lingering bitter finish.  Excellent IPA"
"O- Overall, a very good beer. Although I think it may not be so popular if it were readily available, it is still one of my favorite beers. It is hoppy enough for hopheads, yet balanced and smooth enough to be a session beer (but too damn rare).  I will definitely keep my eyes open for more."
"Im not a pale ale fan, but with all the hype around this beer I had to give it a shot. delicious Piney, ctrus smell upon opening the bottle. poured into an oversized tulip glass with head less than 1"" quickly turning to a nice lacing on the glass. Initial taste is of light fruit with a refreshing lager swallow. Overall i give this brew a 4 (the highest in the category for me)"
"Wasnt all that impressed. Thought that sue was quit a bit better!"
"Very easy drinking APA, I think this beer really appeals to the standard craft beer drinker and I can see where the beer geeks view this as overhyped. In the end, it is a great beer regardless of standards!"
"bottle date 3/12/15    opened the bottle was slapped in the face with the smell. poured the glass , the smell punched me in the nose.. wow what a smell. filled the whole room. delicious"

"Best pale ale out there. Really showcases the citrus hops well while being unbelievable drinkable. Honestly can't get enough of anything FFF. Bottled on 3/9.... 4 days ago !!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding Pale Ale.  Big beer that stays in its style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommendation: One of those legendary beers that every craft beer fan needs to try at least once. In my opinion, it falls off after 6 weeks, so drink it fresh!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On draft at FFF brewpub poured into nonic pint. Coppery with a finger of white head. Smells like ripe mango and pine resin. Crisp carbonation. Outstanding!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll take one of these anytime."
""
""
"A friend of mine share a bottle of Zombie Dust with me this past week.  Very good choice here and I am glad I tried it and I would definitely refer it to others.  Very smooth and very hoppy!  I actually love the name of the beer and the feel of the bottle's wrapping.  Looking for more of Zombie Dust!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Received in trade, bottled late January poured into snifter. Great beer, definitely get the whole pale ale vs ipa debate - this tastes like a hoppy, light pale ale to me. Doesn't have the weight or sharpness of an IPA. That being said, this is friggin awesome. In the top 20 on the 250 list is probably overrated, but this is a terrific beer. Similar to Knee Deep Citra Extra Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tons of flavor. Great smell. Super smooth. Overhyped? Nah."
""
"Coming from the East coast and sitting down at 3 Floyds for a night of pints has been one of the highlights of my beer-travelled life. Zombie Dust was the beer I was most excited for, and it was even better than I imagined it would be - and looking back at the considerably low abv. for a beer with that much flavour, I'm even more astounded. The only beer that excited me more was Permanent Funeral. Wow."
""
""
""
""
"A hop-forward pale ale. Very well-done, to say the least. Great choice if you want a hoppy brew that is on the border of an APA and an IPA!"
""
""
""
""
"It's a great beer, but it is overrated. I agree with the fellow who said that the label is better than the beer..."
""
""
""
""
"A tad bit overrated. I think the label design is actually better than the beer. This is a perfect example of a beer that is overrated because it comes from a trusted brewery. Love 3 Floyds, but there's no way that this brew deserves a Top 15 spot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is a shame the name is Zombie Dust, because the ""Second Coming"" would be more appropriate. The name aside, it is a fine beer that deserves the high ratings. A true beauty."
"Overall I was dissapointed.  With all the great ratings I wS expecting something exceptional.  it is cloudy and very citrousy.  It is a good beer, but be ready to pucker up on some excessive hops"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If I was to rate this for what it is a pale, it would rank up their at the top. But it reminds me so much like a IIPA , in which I think it is above average. I think it is overrated. I had the privilege to try some of their other brews in which I thought were outstanding! 3F is a world class brewery!  Just don't get the hype on the dust."
""
""
""
"Very hard to find this beer"
"Poured from bottle. Great mouth feel...wow!"
""
""
""
""
""
"took two years to find it.  finally tried it, and definitely like it!  very good indiana beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle that my friend brought back from his trip to Indiana.  Poured into a snifter. In a league of its own as a pale ale, as the hoppy, citrusy goodness makes it better than some IPAs."
""
""
"This beer is great, but prefer it fresh. Being on the lower end of the ABV spectrum feel it drops off from being world class."
""
""
""
""
""
"down rite amazing beer this one lives up to the hype. nice hop note at the beginning with a sweet subtle honey finish. ive been trying to find it again for almost a month now might just drive the 5 hours to get some more"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great every day beer. Awesome floral bouquet with a taste to match."
"The depth of a DIPA in a 6.2% ale. Big, rich floral and citrus fruit, yet it's clean and clear. Get this when you want something to sip without a huge alcohol punch. Damn"
""
""
""
"Just a bit too much citrus for my liking."
""
""
""
"Very good beer, but HIGHLY overrated. There are dozens of equally good IPA's, including better ones from 3 Floyds."
"Great beer no complaints here at all. Except I now live too far away to get."
"One of the balanced burrz I love to love. Great bitterness balanced by the fresh and sweet."
""
""
"If you like hoppy beer this is a one. If your not sure, this is a good one to try. Hoppy upfront taste but clean on the back end."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is quite good but it's not crazy good like the hype implies. if you can find it definitely grab some but don't go nuts trying to find it. Beautiful Citra hops but there are better Citra beers."

""
""
"My absolute favorite beer right now!  TTT ROCKS!"
"So great.  Fruity juicy hops.  Awesome"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One if not the best APA's. Great hops and grapefruit notes.  Funny how hard to get this stuff is. Worth the hunt though.  Drink it fresh"
""
""
""
"Appearance 4.25, Aroma 5, Flavor 4.25, Palate 4.5, Overall 4.5"
""
""
"Fantastic brew. Strong hops but rounded, not harsh. There's a grapefruit bitterness to it that really hits the mark."
"Had a pint, on tap at local bar. Not much carbonation or foam, smooth mouth feel, very easy to drink.  Bubble gun aroma and taste, so well balanced nothing stands out. Not an interesting beer but a very good one."
"I'll be upfront and honest. It might not be THAT much better than Sierra Nevada. More fruity, bitterness disappears more quickly. But for the price and lack of abundance... is it really worth it? That being said, super solid throughout. Likely sits in my top 5 for beers. I rate it higher than Sierra Nevada, sure. But I'm not sure that makes it *better*."
""
""
"m - typical pale ale mouthfeel, nothing of note here."
""
"Interestingly enough this is by far the best beer I have had to date"
""
""
""
""
"I had to get it in a trade. wonderful tasty"
""
""
""
"This beer fresh has so much zest and bite from the hops, its awesome!"
""
""
""
"Really crisp and smooth at the same time. Hops aren't overbearing and balanced out well with citrus flavor."
""
""
""
""
"For a hoppy beer it's a good one. Aftertaste lingers a bit but the smell and taste are on point."
""
""
"It's good.  It has all the familiar characteristics of an IPA but brought down and not losing any of the flavor.  It's full, beautiful, and balanced to perfection.  A wonder APA, a step above the Space Station or other APA offerings from FFF."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sought this out while in  Indianapolis. Success and bliss."
"This is a very good beer."
""
"Great beer. Got a plug on NBCs Chicago Fire TV show. One of the characters went to the fridge for a beer and pulled out a zombie dust."
""
"Damn near perfect of you love piney, resin-coated American IPA. Makes the Top 5 of the style to me and the rest of beer guzzling North America."
""
""
"I'd like it more if I wasn't allergic to overly hoppy beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's very good. I don't believe it is overhyped, nor are most beers, but it's a very good IPA, lots of tropical fruits, crisp, dry and tasty. It's good, but after having had so many other IPAs, I've realized that the grass is always greener when hearing about beers from across the river."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Zombie Dust never fails to disappoint. This beer pours golden with an appetizing haze. The aroma hits you with a burst of fresh cut grass and chopped fruits. The mouthfeel is satisfyingly medium bodied with a lively fizz and a depth of taste that awakens your tongue. There is a je ne sais quoi here - something that drives both hopheads and casual beer drinkers alike to go wild over this beer. I think it has something to do with the bold but not overpowering hopping and the incredible gush of tropical fruit that sets this apart."
"V - The value is good because if you've got it in your hands, you probably had to work for it, thus you're probably willing to pay whatever price tag is on it. Seriously though, it is worth every penny."
"Lived up to the hype! Had on tap at the 3 Floyds Brewpub."
"A very great tasting beer when fresh"
"This may be the best Pale Ale I've ever had. Damn good beer."
"How a pale ale should taste"
"Fantastic but its not as good as Pseudo Sue"
"Have only ever had this one from bottles so it was nice to try it on tap.  Great use of citra, the nose really pops, but the mouthful may be the best thing here -- from almost the start to almost the end, there is a constant (somehow) smooth yet biting bitterness that keeps you wondering when it is going to give out, and it keeps on going."
""
""
""
"Delicious like the El Dorado of beer."
""
""
"Best beer on the planet.  Prove me wrong.  Working on getting some Heady Topper to see if it can meet the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes sharply of peppery and slightly fruity hops, with marked astringent tannic, tea-leaf flavors. However, the hop flavors are not as defined as in ""Space Station Middle Finger," for instance, or several other IPAs; the beer has taken a bit of a step back from last year, in my opinion"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- if you get the chance, drink this beer :)"
""
""
""
""
"Orange-yellow, pillowy head. Straight strong Citra, grapefruit, lemon zest. Drinks like an incredibly smooth IPA. Simply awesome"
"One of if not the best beer's I ever had. So many hops I thought a rabbit might hop out! A must for every beer lover! Oh make your girlfriend drink on too because you will have hop breath..."
""
""
""
""
"This might just be the best beer I've ever had.  I rate it a 4.75 just in hope that I someday taste one thats better."
"Overall - excellent."
""
"Overall: Really great beer. One of the best pale ales/IPAs out there."

"epic citra IPA...I could drink this everyday"
"Nice golden orange color.  Super piney with slight citrus on the nose and a taste that matches!  Not the hop bomb I expected, very drinkable!"
"Oct 31 bottles, drank 6 over a few days from Dec 17 on including once side by side with Nov 7 Heady (rough life I know). Anyway. Nice golden color (slightly darker than Heady if you care) good looking white foam. Nose is incredible with an explosion of piney fruityness. Just epic hops, juicy grapefruit and it will blow your mind. Maybe the best smelling beer in the world! Taste is equally good bitter but it feels perfectly integrated. This beer drinks great and even non IPA/hops lovers will appreciate it."
""
""
""
"Got this in a trade with IPAGeorge. Pours a clear orange color with a thick white head that leaves plenty of lacing. I smelled it from the bottle before pouring. Huge grapefruit and mango. Yup, this is Citra alright. A little earthiness in there as well. Taste is like biting into some sort of grapefruit/mango hybrid fruit. A nice malt backbone too to round things out. I'm getting just a hint of pine and maybe a bit of onion. Drinks incredibly smoothly. Many say this blurs the line between APA and IPA and I'd have to agree. It has that bitter edge and hop aroma of an IPA, but enough balance with the malts that brings it closer to an APA. Mouthfeel is wonderful. Clean, crisp, refreshing, very light and easy to drink. Overall, this is definitely worthy of the praise. Just a great all around beer. Huge hop presence, easy to drink, and a great ode to Citra hops.  I want to compare it to the likes of Alpine's Hoppy Birthday, although that one uses more than just Citra. Really just a fantastic beer any way you look at it."
""
"Best beer I ever had"
""
"Not only is this not nearly as good as it's hyped up to be, it's not even that good in general. Definitely drinkable, and if i could buy it whenever i wanted i might buy it every now and then, but this did nothing to impress me. Dont buy into the hype ya fockin nerds."

"Juicy, citrus hop flavors with a hint of sweet caramel malt in the background."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Could this be the most overrated beer of all time? Possibly"
"Awesome beer, but the hype chipped away from the perfect score for me. Was it amazing, yes, but not the best imho."

""
""
""
""
"Really good fresh. Bitter but very drinkable. I have had this beer with 1 week on it and with 1 month and the difference is vast."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a hop head, by any means.  I typically don't like the bitter after-taste of super hoppy beers.  However, this beer (classified as an ale but in years past would have really been an IPA) is different.  Floral notes on the nose and in the mouth make this a pleasurable beer to drink."

"Overall: With the exception of the small amount of haze to the beer it is in fact world class. Squeezing the amount of flavor and aroma into a beer that resembles fruit so much takes a lot of skill. Especially if this is really 100% citra which can get tricky in bittering. It deserves its spot as the king of pale ales for now at least."

"I was at the brewery on 10/3.  Got a case that was brewed on 10/2.  I have never had it that fresh.  it was phenomenal.  I had probably had 6 or 7 times prior, but this was by far the best I had"
"One of my favorite pale ales exhibiting a wonderful balance between hops and malt.  Flavor is not nearly as hoppy as the aroma but still has that nice hop bite without being too overwhelming.  One of the most enjoyable session beers I can think of....you will want mire than one. Salute."

"Im not great at reviewing so I'll just say this...Great beer, not what I had hoped.  There are definitely pales with limited distribution more worthy of the kind of hype this beer gets.  Not to take away from the quality of this pale ale, it's great.  Just not that great...In my opinion."

"Being from Indiana, I get this beer somewhat regularly both on tap and in bottles.  True that the hype surrounding this beer has possibly caused it to be overrated.  Having said that, this beer has a nose on it that will blow you away.  Citra hops smell and taste amazing in this brew and will leave you wanting more.  Easy to drink, not always easy to find, maybe that's why it tastes so good when you do..."
""
""
""
""

"Balanced malt, hopped with citra fully! This is a great pale ale!"

"While I am not a pale ale fan, I did get to sample this, and it is definitely worth the rating.  The aroma alone is worth it!  A tropical forest that just blows your mind.  ""How do they do that?"" is what I thought when smelling this thing.  Very refreshing taste-wise, with a little bitter note at the end."

"That being said, overall, I'm a little let down. This beer, even in Indiana, is extremely rare to get ahold of. When in stock, its by the 1 or 2 six packs that fly off the shelf. Every craft lover I talk too speaks of zombie dust like it's the loch ness monster of beer; a legend that's rarely been seen. I was expecting something epic, rememberable, and the fact that I had to taste this and gumballhead side by side to tell the difference days something. Gumballs are hard enough to get ahold of where I'm from, let alone this beer, that is with out a doubt, more hype than delivery. It's a great beer, but not the holy Bigfoot x files Grail that, at least in these parts, it's played up to be. Still an easy 7/10 overall."
"The beautiful pour,  the heavenly aroma, and the explosion of flavor of the first sip.  The hop profile is complex, deep and compelling.   Pine & Citrus, with floral jungle flower undertones....rich color...great initial blast of resiny flavor with a beautiful finish.  This is as close to heaven as a brew could get.  Absolute perfection and I just wish everyone could try it."

"Bottled 10/24/14 and enjoyed on 11/4/14. I get a lot of fresh, piney, tropical, citrus and floral notes on the aroma. Dank, fresh hops. Explosion of flavor in every sip to gulp. Beautiful lacing. Not too bitter at 60 IBUs.. juicy!"

"Pours a light golden color with an ample off-white head that recedes to a thin lacing. The aroma is full of juicy pineapple, citrus, some tropical fruit & hints of banana peel. The taste is full of tart grapefruit & resinous pine, some lemon zest, a hint of onion, & modest malt foundation on the palate. The finish is drying, slightly herbal & grassy with lingering hints of sweet fruit. Excellent!"
""
""
""
"Use to love this beer, lately the taste isn't the same"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice golden with beautiful cloudiness, decent head and lacing. Aroma is full of pine resin and citrus, very pleasant !!. Taste is not what I was expecting. Hits hard at first with hops but at the same time a nice malt sweetness that balances it all out well. Intensely hopped(I like it) yet balance is nice. I wanted to try it and now I have. I think what sets this beer apart from the others is the ability to overhop this brew and yet still have a great balance and drinkabilty that other beers wish they had !!"

"Overall, an outstanding beer. I don't know if it's an APA or and IPA, but I don't really care.  What it is is an amazingly well crafted beer with about as perfect of balance as I can imagine.  I would happily drink this again (and again and again)."

"Not sipping right now so I will reserve my review for later but from what I remember from last Thursday, this was like a Heady Topper with less alcohol bit to it and a wonderful blend of Citrus (lots of citrus for you hop heads like me), bitterness (relatively low at 60), and bite at only 6.4%. It's a Heady that you can have more than 2 of in one sitting. My own personal order would put this beer at #2 after Pliney The Elder (only because of how perfectly balanced that beer is). This beer isn't balanced much it's a smack of Citrusy Hops across the face. My #3 would be Sofie, with Maine Lunch and Heady rounding out my personal top 5."

"Amazing for a IPA! I picked up some over the week in IN and really enjoyed it! Cant wait to get some more"
""
"Overall, I need to stop writing and start posting ISO of some more. This is definitely going to be the first beer I clone once homebrewing commences. Absolutely a stellar beer, and I could not be more impressed."
""
"Had the opportunity to try this fairly fresh (three weeks after bottling), unfortunately it was after a beer festival. With that said, this beer still stood out. The beer in itself is very well balanced. There was enough of a malt backbone to support the bitterness, so it never became a palate destroyer, which I like. The hop aroma/flavor is why this beer stood out. Loads of juicy nuances that keeps inviting you back to take another drink, just so you can stick your nose back into the glass. This is a great example of a very hop forward, well balanced pale ale. Worth seeking out to try."

"O-I REALLY like this beer will never pass up a chance on it, unless it's really old"
""
""
"Big hop aroma, lots of tropical fruit and very oily. I was expecting a sweet IPA like PA, but was very surprised at the relative dryness and the more grassy hop characteristics. Finishes with low acidity and bitter bite. Medium-heavy body and carbonation gives it a big mouthfeel. A beautiful beer with a big fluffy head, copious lacing, and a slightly amber cloudy color."
"My favorite beer of all time!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Served from a 12 oz. bottle. Pours a semi-opaque medium copper orange with an off white head. This beer leaves a decent amount of lacing as well.  Aroma is a rich blend of orange and other citrus along with very subtle pine notes without being cloying or overpowering. Taste is outstanding with a continuance of orangey citrus notes and pine plus with a barely detectable presence in the background that brings to mind children's aspirin believe it or not. Mouthfeel is full and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall this is an outstanding beer. Though I have some philosophical objections to to the arch-hipsterishness of Three Floyds in general, this might be the premier example of what an American pale ale should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Citra hop taste perfect."
""
"I just started drinking beer recently and while trying many different kinds so far, this is by far the best. I'm lucky enough to have the Three Floyds Brewery only about 20 miles from me or so, and I couldn't be any happier about it. Zombie Dust is the pinnacle of what  an American Pale Ale should be."

". Outstanding. Overall: Wow! Just one outstanding brew! This is one of those rare ones that lives up to and surpasses the hype. It's dank and hoppy yet sweet and balanced while drying out to allow you time to reflect on just how well the brew is crafted. I could drink this like water if I wasn't careful! I wasn't impressed with everything I've had from three Floyd's so far but this one killed it! The king of APA in my opinion."

""
""
""
""
"I had a taste of this at the Lexington beer festival this summer-3 ounces. I've been looking for it since. I got my grubby hands on two 12 ounce bottles tonight! Pours a golden copper color. Aroma is citrus fighting pine. Poured with small head. Grapefruit, ripe tangerine pine taste. Walkups the back of the tongue. Mild bitterness. In the long run, well worth waiting for!"

"Excited to get my hands on this through a trade. Huge citrus and grapefruit delicious flavors. Wonderful take on a hoppy pale ale."
""
"Like most reviewers, feel like this is more IPA than APA. But technicalities aside, a completely enjoyable drinking experience. The Citra hops can't be missed in this one. Lemon and grapefruit hit you hard at the front and then it finishes with a smooth maltiness. Deserving of its spot in the top tier."

"O- This is an amazing beer that really straddles that APA/IPA line. This is the best showcase of Citra hops that I have encountered. Thirsty Dog's Citra Dog and Odd Side's CPA try to imitate but don't even come close. Really tried to go in not expecting to be blown away and I would suggest everyone try to do that. It's not a DIPA but just a very aromatic and full hop flavored pale ale that you could drink all day and not get sick of. Definitely worth a drive for your 2 case limit."

"One of the best from Three Floyds.  Huge in your face hop aroma and bitterness.  Great beer that I cannot get enough of."
""
""
""
""
""
"HOPS!!!  BITTERNESS?!  Huge hop nose....beer is fueled by aroma hops.  After smelling the hops and then taking a drink you are pleasently surprised how non-bitter it is given the amount of smell they emit.  It is very well done and a true suprise of the top 10 in an American Pale Ale."
""
""

"O:  This is a quality beer.  The hype may have exceeded what you get in this beer, but you will not regret giving it a try.  Not overly complex, but very flavorful for the style and very nicely balanced.  An enjoyable drinking experience."

"Pretty good. went and picked up two cases on site. IDK why all these losers are idolizing it, as 2 cases cost 80 dollars. however, taking everything into consideration, it is a good beer."

"Delicious"
""
"O – Having had this before without evaluating properly, I was pleasantly surprised to remember how well balanced it is.  There is a ton of hop flavor, aroma, and bitterness, but does not destroy your taste buds.  The malt has a great presence as well and really works together with the hops to create a remarkable beer. Great example of the American Pale Ale style."

"Golden amber color with a white head that settles to a steady cap and laces the glass all the way down.  Big citrus and tropical notes combine with a bready, caramel like malt presence.  Taste is of citrus fruits, grapefruit, orange and tangerine.  Tropical flavors of mango, pineapple and guava.  Underneath the blast of fruit flavors that ride the whole way through the palate is a great sweet bread malt presence.  Medium body, crisp mouthfeel and semi dry finish.  Overall a great APA.  Is it worth the hype?  It's a great APA which showcase the citra hop extremely well.  It's a top APA for sure so the hype is at least partially warranted."

"From the first time you smell the hops in the glass, you know this is a special beer. Yes there is an explosion of hops, although controlled, when you taste it, but the clean mouth feel leaves you wanting more. It is evident why all the reviews are what they are for Zombie Dust across the country at BA and other beer rating sites. This is an outstanding beer that you are bound to enjoy! As long as you like hops... If you don't the it is a wonder why you even drink beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A top-notch APA that is very different from the old Cascade examples. That said, I don't feel that this is really any better than Lagunitas New Dogtown Pale Ale, which is easy to find. How much is the hype factor driving up the score on this, albeit excellent, beer?"

"Yup its fuckin good. However the absolutely ridiculous hype is unwarranted. It isn't the best beer ever. In my opinion not a 100, probably a 98 and wouldn't argue with a 99. The fact is it isn't fair that this is #10 on the BA list simply because of people obsessed with three Floyd""s, compared to some of the other beers out there it really shouldn't be a 100. Don't get me wrong this beer is absolutely delicious but to compare it to some of the other 100""s and even some of the other APA's, like MO which is sooo underrated imo, it just isn't so much better that it deserves a 100."

"I really want to rate this beer higher. Poured into frozen pint, bottled on 7/11 so I know freshness isn't an issue. Smell is fantastic , floral and fresh, west coast fragrance. Taste when it hits the tongue is same as smell but gives way to a belgian style flavor, not my style. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean and beer is super fresh tasting. I tried it twice to make sure it wasn't an off day, but it wasn't. I would drink again for sure, but I wouldn't seek it out, just not my style of PA/IPA"

"O: basically an IPA - the fact that they're calling it a pale ale, while it may be true relative to their hoppy beers, is a bit silly... it's an IPA... nothing out of the ordinary, flavor-wise, but it has a nice crisp attack and is undeniably, notably, solidly made"
""
""
""
"Enjoyed at the brewery in Munster. It was served with a light yellow color and a medium head that had fair retention. The smell was largely fruit, and especially tropical fruit. The taste, as others have said, more resembles that of an IPA as there isn't a whole lot of malt to balance it, but the fruit flavors are great, and it starts off sweet (but not too sweet) and does finish with some bitterness. It's moderately carbonated and goes down very easy. It's very, very similar to White Rajah (which is an IPA) in both smell and taste, but the mouthfeel and color are slightly different. Overall, this is excellent. Yes, it is definitely overhyped as it is not by any means earth shattering, but it is worth seeking."
""
""
"Stopped in this beerwery on the way back to Detroit from Chi-Town. Bought several cases of different 3 Floyds. This IPA presents a Gold color with a nice head and a super hoppy flavor and finish. Full bouquet aroma and sweet citrusy after-taste. Perfect hoppiness. They should call this brew hoppy rabbit as it doesn't turn one into a zombie.. very nice brew."

"Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a world class example of an IPA, I know the brewery calls this is a Pale Ale and while it has some of the balance that a good Pale Ale should have it still tasted and drank just like an IPA. This beer had great drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, refreshing, not filling at all and the taste did a great job of holding my attention, I think I could drink a lot of these without even coming close to being bored with it, it's a great combination of taste and drinkability and I think it's a great beer to have on a warm day. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma and mouthfeel, to me those two aspects stood out just a little more than the others and they were both really well done. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't a single that about this beer that I disliked or would change, it's great just the way it is, but I do wish I could buy this in Michigan. I would for sure buy this beer if I had the chance and I wouldn't hesitate to grab a case of it. I would recommend this beer to everyone, it is truly one of those must try beers. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, with how famous it is in the craft beer scene I was expecting this to be a great beer and it ended up living up to that and it delivered in every aspect. This beer made for a great first impression for Three Floyds and I would love to try more of their beer. As a a Pale Ale, I'm pretty sure it's the best I've had and as an IPA it's up there in my top three for sure. Great job guys, this is one Awesome beer and It deserves all the recognition it gets."

"TASTE: The Citra hops really shine through in the taste. Grapefruit & tangerine really hit the palette rup front. There is a slight orange rind like bitterness that lingers -- but it's refreshing and not overwhelming like some hop forward IPA's."

"A nice pale ale, that is basically an IPA. I have had this many times, and never really understood the appeal. Citra hops are strong for sure, but I am not a fan of the consistent soapy and oil character throughout."

""
""
""
""
""

"So few things in life live up to the hype, thankfully, zombie dust does not fall victim to that trap.  Easily one of the best beers I've ever had, crisp and clean, yet still full bodied and robust.  I am immediately jealous of anyone who lives close enough to the brewery or in 3F's distro area."

"However, even enjoying both these beers quite a bit, I question if, psychologically, Three Floyds' hype and frustratingly conservative distribution of these two beers has skewed my ratings from being what they would be if these beers were as common as Lagunitas. There's something to contemplate over your most recent longneck."

"This one was on my list to get for only a year or two after hearing about it. It is right on the border of pale ale and becoming and IPA. There is a very small hint of of what could be described as vegetable ash, but likely it was the yeast. I would definitely recommend, i have a few bottle in my stash aging."

"Had the pleasure of tasting this beer multiple times throughout the past 3 years or so but this review is based on when I got my ZD cherry popped. It was poured into a small taster glass from the bottle and I could smell an intense passionfruit aroma before I even picked the glass up from the countertop. The nose on this thing absolutely blew my mind. Huge amounts of juicy tropical fruit amazingness. The flavor was the same and led me to believe that some sort of actual fruit was added to this beer, nope just citra hops! This may technically fit into the IPA category, but who cares....those lines have been blurred for a while now anyway. Cheers FFF, you did great with this one"

"O-I've tried this beer several times now, even lucky enough to get it on tap on the east coast! I have to say it's slightly underwhelming given it's very high rank and reputation. However it's still a great APA that deserves to have it's name thrown around with the greats."

" The flavor starts with citrus zestiness and juicy tropical fruit -mild mango and pineapple flavors give way to juicy grapefruit and light pale malt with subtle herbal and almost grassy accents with pure hop goodness all the way through. Love the fact this has a balance of malt for the style yet not holding back any hop intensity at all with finesse in the flavor. Overall one of the best pales in existence if no THE best - very worth with the emphasis on Citra making for a enjoyable flavor from first sip to last with citra essence in each taste -incredibly drinkable."
"I tried this on tap and then poured from the bottle into a pint glass a couple weeks later (yes, from a fresh batch) and I'm just not impressed with this one. The Citra doesn't stand out. The beer is fine, but not special. It seemed to have a soapy characteristic to me in both formats."

"O: ZD has been a long time want and doesn't leave me at all disappointed. While I have had better examples, this is definitely among the best Citra single hop beers out there."

"A nice cloudy orange. It was light on it's head but honestly, it was probably my pour. It leaves a great lacing on my pint glass. I can smell citrusy hops that wafts strongly from the glass. I don't have to be close to the glass at all to smell them. That being said, the smell is the only thing that disappoints me about this beer. It's lacking somehow that I can't quite put my finger on. The hops hit me immediately as I taste it but they're calmed down almost immediately by the sweet malt. Neither the hops or the malt is overpowering. The mouth feel is very balanced, not too heavy...not too light. As it lingers in my mouth, I can feel a distinct bite tingling in my mouth. Overall it's a great beer. What impresses me the most is how well balanced it is."

"A very clean drinking beer. It reminds me of white wine or saison with how dry the beer is. It is different because it has this light malt body, and simply injects hop juice onto the palate and then leaves the mouth extremely empty and dry for me."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle at State&Lake, coincidentally during Chicago Beer week 2014. Pale orange in color with a nice white head. Fantastic citrus hop aroma. For an IPA this is all about the aromatic hops, with medium bitterness kept well in check by a solid biscuit malt backbone. Super drinkable, almost English-style West coast IPA. Not totally dry, either. Just really juicy and citrusy."

"A little underwhelming considering its reputation, I've had other pale ales which hold up better with only 4 months of age, but definitely has its charm."
""
""
"Enjoyed this on tap at 3Floyds brewpub in Munster, fresh from the source! Poured slightly hazy with a thin white head. The aroma of this IPA is among my absolute favorites. Light citrus scents with slight piney notes made be very excited to take a sip. The sip, however started well, but took an odd turn for me. The lighter citrus flavors on the initial sip turn to an odd late skunky bitterness blended with some malt flavors. I definitely enjoyed the smell more than the taste, but an overall great offering from a great brewery."
""
""
"I've had a lot of good hoppy ales lately, especially all of the amazing sessionable IPA's coming out locally. But this is right up there with the best. I've been able to try this at bottle sharing sessions, but it was great to sit down and review my own bottle."

"I wanted to start this review mentioning that I am not a huge IPA or APA guy. I am just starting to delve into them. This beer is an orange-gold radiance to it. It pours very nicely. Leaves a thumb width head when served from a tap or poured from a bottle. The smell has a faint citricey smell followed by a grainey finish (for those of you that have looked at a couple of my other reviews, I state that I am a big fan of anything citrus flavored). This smell got me kind of excited. With the first taste of this awesome beer, I did pick up hints of grapefruit and then a strong bold taste that I'm not used to experiencing (again, just starting to delve into IPA's and APA's) all the way to the finish. The beer had nice viscosity and felt nice all the way across the palate. After the first beer I was a big fan and have had many bottles since. I am fortunate enough to live within a hours drive of FFF and have made a couple trips to pick up cases of ZD. I will be drinking this beer many times again down the road. Cheers!"

"Felt good on the tongue and not a sharp aftertaste. Overall look and smell were pleasant, poor was smooth and decent head out of the bottle. All around a good beer for partying with, although availability and overall cost was a bit of a downer. All in all a good beer with a high price tag."

"O: I was happy to get a fresh Zombie Dust from a friend who visited the brewery for DLD so I had high expectations since this was one of the highest rated beers on Beer Advocate. I was let down by this beer. It is a great beer but this is very overrated due to the fact that it is not distributed outside of a small area, I can't explain otherwise why it is rated so high. I would take a fresh / semi-fresh Hopslam over this any day."

"This is a beer that people love to hate cause of the hype. I smell, the taste, the body is just spot on for me. It is my go to beer. Every time I see it is available at the brewpub I make sure I run by to pick up a six pack. The art work on the box is awesome as we'll. I will always love thus beer and hope to never move out of the area"
""

"FFF hit a home run with this beer. Picked up couple cases at DLD. Couldn't wait to get it home to crack a cold one open. Great hop presence on the nose. Citrus dominated nose with some tropical fruits layered in there. Nice carbonation and mouth feel. Great malt presence with fantastic levels of hop bitterness. Never makes your mouth feel abused by the hops. Just really well made beer."

"I had never had a Zombie Dust before and was pretty psyched to try one for the first time last night. One of our local enthusiasts brought this to the bottle shop to share and man that smell smacked me right in the face the moment he opened it. I've always loved hops but this was an exception. Wish FFF made its way to NC but I guess it wouldn't be as special if it was common"

"If you've paid the going rate ($12/6-pk.), then you've got liquid gold. Couldn't possibly find a more flavorful, impressive beer at 6.5% abv or less."

"Overall this beer is excellent! It pours an orange/honey color with a small head. Its overall aromas consist of fruity smells such as pineapples, pears and honey. The taste is sweet and well balanced with a definite hop flavor. The aftertaste is pleasant overall! Great for summer!"

""

"For me this beer didn't live up to the hype at all. It was a solid brew but hardly the sixth best beer on BA. I still enjoyed it and would like to try it again but for my money there are several other FFF beers that I've had that I would much rather get my hands on."

"My sister-in-law was nice enough to bring me a few of these (fresh) from Chicago. I've always been a fan of Three Floyds, and I was happy to finally try this- it did not disappoint. Beautiful beer, with a burnished gold color contrasted with a stark white head that leaves some decent lacing. Citrus and herbal aromas with a touch of grain. Clean and fresh smelling. The taste is where it's at. Clean citrus and a touch of clean sweet malt. Candied grapefruit peel followed by a long spicy hop finish. All very pleasant and quaffable. I'd drink this all the time if I had access to it."
""
""
""
"O - It's not as good as you may have heard, it's better! Not you're usual APA with some of the best hop flavors and smells you'll ever come across. My favorite part is how drinkable this APA is. Most beers with this much flavor aren't nearly as smooth. Well worth the time and effort it takes to find... ""It's Not Normal"""

"Probably the most popular year-round offering from FFF. Had this on tap at The Tap craft beer bar in Bloomington, IN. Had it in bottles many other times, but nothing compares to fresh from the tap. A hazy golden color with a surprisingly creamy head for a pale ale. Smell is fantastic; pine, citrus, flowers. Taste was smooth and biting all at once, a true masterpiece of a pale ale."

"I finally got to try the real ZD after drinking half a batch of my cloned version...Thanks Brennan! This is a nice APA that I could drink over and over. Pours a hazy dirty-orange with an off-white head. It has an amazing tropical fruit aroma, which carries over to the taste, combined with a perfect balance of bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but maybe that's what makes it so drinkable. Overall, a very approachable APA that I wish they sold in my neighborhood."

""
"T: Opens with some pine and just a trace of overripe mango. Middle brings a touch of grapefruit, tangerine and grapefruit pith, which dries things out pretty nicely. Finish shows a little caramel, lingering pink grapefruit pith and some nice pine resin without becoming overly bitter. Fantastically hoppy without sacrificing balance. And drinkable for days. This is awesome stuff."

"3 week old bottle poured into a tulip shaped glass. No head to speak of, no lacing either. Nice hazy, light copper color. Smells great for a pale, citrus and melon, kind-of-a muted Sculpin. Taste is near perfect, the only other pale at this level is ""Mo"". Good carbonation, very smooth finishes nicely. Overall, this is everything I hoped it would be, and rarely can i make such a statement."
"About as good a pale ale can be - tons of flavor for the size of the beer."
""
"One of my favorite beers. A nice citrus nose, and a hint of honey, very pleasant. Citrus hops, grapefruit and maybe a little melon or mango, and honey again, with a bit of maltiness, and not overly bitter aftertaste. A well balanced ale. Bonus points for the sweet artwork. Deserving of the ratings it receives, and not ridiculously priced for such a great beer. This APA presents as an IPA. Glad I was lucky enough to get some to New England."
"O: OK, fine, this beer really is that good. Everything about it is a step above the rest- fantastic and unique appearance, exceptional balance between bitterness and sweetness AND showing the true potential that hops have besides 'citrus and pine' (other breweries take note), and somehow making a non-abrasive but refreshing mouthfeel. Congrats, Three Floyds, you've won me over. Now up your distribution, because I don't want to drive an hour out of the way for more."

"Overall: this beer has a lot of good flavors but falls short in the mouthfeel. Needs a little bit of a bite to it or additional juicy hop characteristics. All in all it's nothing out of this world. Just a well done and good beer that is way to hard to find and sought after"
"Mouthfeel- medium to light body."

"Mouthfeel- Perfectly done. Velvety smooth, wouldn't change a thing about it."
"Maybe it was the first beer or one of the first to showcase citra hops, and to burst the crap out of it with flavor additions up the wazoo, but flash forward to 2014 and it's just a regular old pale ale that is as ubiquitous in flavor as it is pretentious in notoriety."
"This one is certainly citrus and hop forward but, the flavors are balanced so well. No flavor overpowers any of the others. Wonderful aromas and silky mouthfeel. Very impressive."

"O - This is as good as the hype and very happy that I finally got my hands on two. Now I need to get more."
"The taste follows suit, with a cleanliness often missing from big ambitious brews. It finishes bitter and crisp. This is an awesome brew and I need to get me a bunch more. It would be cool to drink a few of these instead of just one."

"This is an okay beer. It's definitely not worth the hype that TF has made. I've tried it a few times & I just wasn't blown away. I've had other APA's/IPA's that I can say are much better. It's not a bad beer, but I wouldn't put it within my top 10 beers of all time."
"o; A tasty and powerfully hoppy ale, well deserving its place among the top brews available. Great combination of appearance, aroma, flavors, hop bite, aftertaste, mouthfeel - this 'un has it all. Unfortunately I'm not expecting to get any more anytime soon."

"O: On draft and in bottles, Zombie Dust is one of my all time favorite beers. I did not succumb to the hype, I am just a sucker for citra hops. It's an IPA for APA lovers, and an APA for IPA lovers."
""
""
"O- There are very few beers that can bring such an intense, aggressive, and tantalizing hop level cascading throughout each sip and still find a way to make it smooth. FFF is rare to disappoint. ZD is right there with Dreadnaught in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was worried that this beer wouldn't live up to the hype that people give it. It has lived up to my expectations and is the best pale ale that I have had. Love the floral taste and smell and would gladly trade for more of this."

"Poured a hazy golden orange with a thin off white head with some lacing on the glass. Smells and tastes fantastic. Citrus fruits come through along with a piney resinous aroma with a slight but present malt backbone. The taste is much of the same; tough to put this one down after each sip. Glad I was able to get a sizer in a trade. It will be missed until next time!"
"O. While good, This one doesn't live up to the hype for me. Given that it is hopped with Citra, I expected more Citrus flavor. Additionally the mouthfeel is quite thin."

"A bit more of an IPA than a pale, Especially at 6.4%, but nice a solid flavorful, smooth beer. Pretty freaking solid brew, definitely recommend, but don't take out a second mortgage, it's just a Pale..."

"Overall: This is one of my favorite beers. Super dank, taste almost like weed to be honest. If you like Citra hops this is your brew. I like a lot of Three Floyd's, but this is one my favorite from them. Definitely worth trying. I get it regularly and use whatever I don't drink as trade bait."
"O: lives up to the hype"

"Absolutely delicious! One of my all time favs! Good hop bite right up front with a smooth mellow finish. One of the most appropriate sipping beers. Slightly better on draft but pretty damn good in the bottle as well. A beautiful golden color, with aromas of blended hops and citrus notes. Other reviews have stated that it isnt as good since the discontinuation of the citra hops, but I disagree. Im not really sure what FFFs secret is, but they have nailed it!"

""

"I think it's fff best beer"
"Will definitely seek this out again. Maybe an excuse to make it down for dark lord day...as if any were needed !"
""
"Poured from bottle into chilled pint shaker glass. Orange amber color, but not as cloudy as I might have expected. Thin white head, which dissipated to thin collar and lots of tiny bubbles. Excellent sticky lacing throughout, all the way down. Beautiful nose of floral citrus and mango grapefruit. On the palate, the nose is replicated, but a dank piney hint emerges. Great malts, good balance. Big chewy mouthfeel. Nice long finish. Reminds me of cross b/t Sucks & Hopslam, which sounds like the definition of heaven to me."

"Until recently with some of Half Acres new brews, this one stood at the top of my list of local Chicago area beer. It's unique flavor and strong hop characteristics make it one of the few beers I immediately recognize upon tasting. The only complaint I have regarding the beer is the consistency of the product can be a bit sketchy depending on what pub you go to. At the brewery it's amazing in both bottles and on draft."

"Special thanks to JayORear for the gift!"
"So far,the best by a bunch. Appearance slight hazy. Good looking in a glass. Nice head retention. Perfect carbonation. Alcohol taste hidden well.Smell of citrus ,but not like a fruit bowl. More like nectar of the Gods. Taste will amaze you. Very smooth.The first one is always the best until you get hold of the second one and then it's the best.The third one works in the same manner."

"O - Fantastic beer. One of the best in the world in my opinion"
"O- An amazingly smooth and drinkable pale ale. While not as flavorful as some top tier IPAs or other Citra hop beers, Zombie Dust might be the most balanced and smoothest. The slight sweetness and lack of bitterness make this one of the few hoppy beers that I could drink all night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The only problem with this beer was that it was in 12oz. I could drink pints on pints of this stuff without thinking twice. Definitely in a grey area between an APA and IPA though. I don't like this one in the APA category because of its hoppiness, but it doesn't belong in the IPA category because of its maltiness. Must try. An incredible beer."

"Overall a stunning beer. I could drink this all day and night. Leans more toward an IPA in my opinion, but who really cares about the classification. It's an amazing brew regardless of what you call it. wish I could get this stuff on a regular basis!"

"Three Floyds Zombie Dust is a 60 IBU Pale Ale that pours a deep amber, also has a very hazy deep orange hue~ Aromas of Pine forest smack your nostril instantly... Like a citrus fruit stand in the middle of a Pine forest, Yeast and Hops present as well~ Mouthful is light, creamy and refreshing, much less sticky than anticipated for a 6.4% low carbination~ Taste is crisp and clean, Citrus right away... Orange Grapefruit, Mango, Passion Fruit, Lemon Zest and Pineapple... All of which are balanced to near perfection with Carmel malt, Honey and a Bready Backbone~ Zombie Dust is not complex, her strengthens are a ridiculously refreshing, well balanced sleek and smoothness that delivers on point and shines while doing so~ How Three Floyd's pulls off their brew being light, refreshing smooth and subtle WHILE also being Big, Hearty, Satisfying, Bold 'Meaty' and Tasty is beyond me! However, they rock each one seamlessly... Cheers to 3Floyds ! A bit of a dank yet funky (soapy) aftertaste is the only MINASCULE Drawback~"

"I was so excited when my beer guy produced an under the counter bottle of this highly rated apa. Pours a cloudy orange tan with a slight head that quickly turns to a thick off white lacing that lasts throughout the ale. The nose is deep and malty. Sweet but not bitter with the hoppiness normally found in a pale ale. There is pine and grass notes but not much citrus on the nose. It Sips clean with a pleasant mouth coating effect. Not bitter but not sweet either. Rather balanced and very pleasant. The tongue is malty and rich with a tangy bitterness on the start and an unexpected sweetness on the finish. The balanced flavor lasts long after the ale is gone. The flavors of this ale are astoundingly balanced, almost too much so. It is an incredibly well crafted ale but lacks any notes that make it stand out from the rest. It is a delicious ale that is incredibly satisfying but, even with all the hype, not one that I would go out of my way for again."

"O: My favorite APA thus far, hands down."

"O-Phenomenal Pale ale. Amazing IPA. The flavor is amazing and not overdone. No wonder it's number 6 on the top 250."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Can see why this beer is considered so legendary. If I could procure this regularly, this would be my every day beer. Doesn't necessarily blow your socks off like a Barrel aged stout or DIPA (though this is a little too hoppy to be considred an APA, IMHO), but it's really impossible to only have one. Great stuff."
""
""
""
"M- Like I mentioned with taste, refreshing and juicy. Medium-bodied with a good balance of sweetness and bitterness. Not overwhelmingly bitter. 4.5"
""
"I've had many FFF beers. This beer is very very good. I give it a low over all only because it's very very strong. I'm not big into DIPAs or IPA's in general. If IPA's had a throne, .. this beer would sit on it. but again, it's not for the faint of heart."

"One of the better pale ales I have had and closer to an IPA in my opinion. I'd really like to try this on tap."

"The first sip is phenomenal.  After that, I felt like it was a pretty garden variety apa.  It's good, but I've had it twice now and I do noses what the fuss is about.  I love the smell, and the taste is very hop forward."

"O: Great hopped up Pale Ale, worth the hype but better local brews with easy availability will steer me away from this."

"Overall, it lived up to the hype was an absolute phenomenal beer. I would highly recommend it to anyone who can get their hands on it. Will actually be getting my hands on some permanent funeral within the next week!"
""
""
"Had on draft like 3 nights in a row, each time just blew me away. First time I had it in a bottle it was pretty good probably not worth the hype... But having it on draft just blew me away I had to re-review it. I've never had a better beer than Zombie Dust on tap, and I say that in full confidence."
"Mouthfeel is great too- medium light body, well carbonated but not prickly, not too sticky. Of course this is an awesome beer; wish I'd picked up a few more bottles."

"Overall an intensely hopped pale ale, bitterness is not that prominent, but the aroma and taste is all about the citra hops. they are nicely showcased in this brew."

"This pours a semi-cloudy, golden amber color with a slight head. The aroma is rich with bitter hops. The taste is smooth, clean, and crisp. There is a decent amount of hops for a pale ale. Well made, perhaps a little over-hyped but an all around well made pale ale."
""
""
"Overall: This is a great brew but I don't think it is world class. I've had it a few times, on draft and in bottle to make sure I wasn't missing anything before I reviewed it. No doubt that is beer is a must try though, really enjoyed the six pack I was able to get."

"What a great beer. I think it should be called a IPA but it is one of the best beers out there. I honestly would rather drink this beer over Heady Topper. It is a beer you can have a couple of without being trashed. However this beer more then any other beer I have ever had has to be fresh. It falls off quicker then anything in the world. But when fresh the nose is second to none. The flavor as well."

"O - I cannot think of another beer quite like Zombie Dust. It may be an APA, and its light feel going down emphasizes this, but its clear hop focus and robust fruit and bitter has more in common with IPAs than with the typical APA I've enjoyed. I find Zombie Dust to be a pleasure, and I love the full frontal attack of the fruit and pine that is at this beer's core. It drops off quickly, so don't leave this one sitting around for long, drink it up and enjoy."

"Overall, just an outstanding beer. I docked the overall however since the abundance of hops doesn't fit the APA style. Call it an IPA and I'll change my score."

"Have picked up two 6 packs in the last 3 weeks.  Both packs were bottled about a week before I drank them.  This is an excellent beer and has no faults.  I hope with the expansion at Three Floyds this will become more readily available (liquor stores in Indianapolis get 1 case about every 2 weeks), and I don't have to leave work early to get my hands on some.  One of the best beers I've ever drank, and if you get it fresh like I have recently it is unbelievably good."

"Very nice pale ale! Deep orange with a thin white head that quickly settles into a ring around the glass. bright hop notes on the nose. Citrus ring and tangy grapefruit with a little sweet tangerine. Is thinner on the mouth than expected. This is almost all hop. the malt is entirely swallowed up by the bitterness. I actually think this could use a tad more sweetness, but that is nitpicking. this is a delicious pale ale for hop heads."

This could be an almost perfect beer, except there's something slightly sweet in the aftertaste that I can't quite put my finger on, but I'm not a huge fan of. Still though, an outstanding pale ale, is sessionable, yet still has of great taste and feel. Every time I have one of these, I appreciate it more. That IMO, is a mark of a truly outstanding beer!"

A bit more body and this beer would be nearly perfect. A must try if you ever get the chance."

"O - Incredible beer."
"O - While not necessarily the best beer I've ever had, Zombie Dust is hands down the best pale ale I've had the pleasure of trying. This beer is a near perfect balance of fresh hop cone flavor, restrained malt sweetness, and balanced alpha oil bitterness that makes a pale ale a pale ale and not an IPA."

"Mostly clear gold with a small, richly creamy head. Big Citra aroma with some sugary malt, pineapple, orange oils, and grapefruit. Pungent fruit all around, mango, leafiness, all floral and zesty with an increasing ""dankness"". Juicy, fruity, oily hops in the mouth...big citrus, ripe fruit, pine needles, floral hops, and peaches. Crisp, medium bodied, and smooth, softening towards the end. Different from what I expected, but that's not a bad thing. I bet I could drink a lot of this if given the opportunity."

"Aroma is super Citra, almost minty. Very juicy and fresh, and dank. Miles of hop, and juuust barely enough malt to hold it up and keep a balance. Lemon, orange, and bright zesty herbs. Flavor is loaded with juicy citrus, light pine, and zesty brisk herbs. Very nice smooth and prickly mouthfeel. Quite swirlable and some kind of juicy explosion in the mouth. Stinkier hop presence as it warms up. A delight for the having..."

"O) I'm not going to lie, this is probably my favorite beer in the world. So many brewers mask a beer's flaw with IBU's, but this is perfectly done and incredibly well crafted in every respect. This is a piece of brewing art."

"One of my favorites. Pours a orange/amber with a small head. Leaves a nice frothy ring around the glass. Smells amazing. All kinda of citrus and a small amount of grass and pine. Only a little malt comes through, the hops are straight forward. The taste has good citrus qualities, as well. The malt cuts into the bitterness and is balanced nicely. Citrus, pine, and some other tropical fruit come through on the aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, small amount of carbonation and the taste lingers on the tongue for just a little bit, which makes you want to keep drinking this all day long."
""
""
""
""
""
"Everything else this beer has though it truly extraordinary. This is the only beer that would be a double/imperial anything in my top ten of all time. This deserves all the praise it has gotten and if you think it's overrated just try another, and another and eventually you'll come around. Perhaps some day this will be as readily available as Alpha King or Gumball Head."

"This is my first post here. I have gone from enthusiast to full out addict to craft beers, especially ipas. Zombie dust is by far my favorite.

"To have a beer that is rated so high the expectation is high. I am finding that this is not the case with a lot of hyped up beers. It had a slight skunked smell to it, little bitter note for me. Maybe I had the bad batch. I like APA's and this did not meet the feeling that I was hoping for. Little down on this one."

"This a fine example of the American Pale Ale style, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite styles. It's almost hoppy enough to pass for an IPA, but balanced enough to enjoy multiple in one sitting. Do yourself a favor and see what all the hype is about."

"Pours a dark orange color with a finger length white head. Dissipates quickly and leaves a nice lacing. Smells of intense, juicy, sweet fruits like pineapple, mango, grapefruit, some peach, tiny bit of floral notes, lots of tropical fruit, sweet carmel. Almost like a bubblegum smell. Taste starts a hefty dose of citrus, sweet, savory fruits like pineapple, mango, and peach, get some floral qualities as well. Very classic floyds taste. Then gets even sweeter with the carmel malts and more fruits. Then finishes with more citrus fruits, even more tropical fruits, more carmel. Nice dry finish. During the entire taste profile, a good amount of hop bitterness lingers. Somewhat bitter, but just so darn smooth, fruity, and refreshing and definitely not as intense as the aroma suggests. Mouthfeel is creamy. Medium body with a good amount of carbonation, which adds to the refreshing quality of the beer. Have had it many times, and never ceases to amaze me. Best session beer on the market."

""

""

" The overall appearance regarding color and head are exactly as one might expect or should expect from an ale. It is the distinct aroma and taste of Citra hops, which again is a perfect balance with the grain and yeast, that takes Zombie Dust to another level."

"O: Extremely well balanced without shying away from the big flavours. Enjoyed the combination of citrus, pine resin and tropical fruits with that backbone of malts. A highly drinkable and refreshing IPA that comes close to a DIPA."
""
""
""
""
"The taste, smell and appearance of this beer is just astounding. The bright, somewhat burnt orange look, the explosive citrus aroma, and the taste that combines the same citrus quality with the perfect malt undertone - just amazing. And so drinkable. I don't get a hold of this often, so I sometimes find myself almost disbelieving my memory of it. But I got a sixer the other night, poured myself one, took a sip, and thought: yep, just as good as you remembered. Then my wife took a sip. ""That's amazing," she said. She took another: ""That's the best beer in the world!"" In my limited experience, I think she's right."

"Zombie Dust is a beer I never get tired of. Every time I have one it continues to be exciting and delicious. I can't recommend this beer highly enough. It's been tough to find over the last 7 or 8 months though. I had to go to the brewery to pick this up and it was flying out of the door."

"My perfect beer. First, 3 Floyds appearance and smell are consistently great. Zombie Dust takes the taste and mouthfeel beyond their other great beers. I love bitter beers with little sweetness. ZD has a consistent taste from start to finish. It is also one of the only beers that tastes the same whenever I have it."
""
""

"O - This beer deserves any praise that it gets. Honestly the best of the ""pale ale"" category excluding the ""I" by miles. I would drink this all day and would probably eat someone's brains if it meant getting this beer sent to PA."

"First of all Three Floyd's does it right! Yes, you might have to wait to get into the brew pub but trust me it's well worth the wait. I love the name and love the art work. Three Floyd's have nailed it once again. It's such a flavorful pale ale. I am a stout girl but my goodness this is great!"

"Overall a great beer as its reputation shows. Definitely not overrated. Huge huge flavor and character from an American Pale Ale. Not too in your face but with huge flavor."
""
""
""
""
"O: EXTREMELY balanced and bold, especially for being a pale ale. I'm going to have to go to Munster/Chicago for some more sometime soon."
""
"O: A really great beer. Much like with Pliny the Elder as the pinnacle of its style, I am not overwhelmed by any one thing about this beer (excepting that the mouthfeel is absolutely perfect). It's just a very well crafted beer all around with no major flaws, and that goes a really long way. I would drink this very frequently if I had regular access to it."
""
"Recently sampled on a trip to Chicago. What can I say, definitely lived up to the hype! Extremely drinkable, and wonderfully well-balanced hop forward pale ale. The citra hops are profiled with expert precision with those tropical notes on exhibition from the smell through every sip. This beer is a real work of art, very much worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a Great beer. Bright clear orange/amber color and an aroma that reminded me of peeling an orange. Light mouthfeel and excellent strong hop and citrus flavor doesn't have a lingering coppery taste that I've noticed in some ipa's or dipa's. hands down best ipa/pale ale I've ever had the pleasure of tasting."
""
""
""
""
" Try it if you have the chance."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber with billowy off-white head that dissipates quickly. Good lacing. It looks like a world class ale in the glass. The nose is all hops. Intense tropical fruit aromas with a whiff of grass and lemon. Bitterness at the front of the palate gives way to a malty middle that finishes with a floral, lemony hoppiness. Light bodied with great carbonation make this a very refreshing pale. Overall this a well crafted pale, complexity to rival the best DIPAs on BA with an ABV low enough to make it just about sessionable, a most impressive achievement. Thanks Xthul!"
"Label art is probably the coolest out there. Like a page from a comic book, except shiny metallic! Since I live roughly an hour from the brewery, this is frequently stocked at my house. I just love this beer. I know perfect scores should be very hard to come by, but this beer is what changed my outlook on beer forever. I have read by some that this beer is overrated, but it is truly the best single IPA i have ever had, and what is even more amazing is that I can get it regularly. Thank you 3F!"
""
"Not a huge fan of ""stronger"" beers, but this is fantastic. The hints of grapefruit are phenomenal and the ABV is by no means overpowering. Don't drink and chew mint gum! The best part of this beer, aside from the taste, is trying to find it. This is the closest thing to the baseball card and later action figure hunts I went on years ago. Fun!!"

"O - Very flavorful, easy drinking, great mouthfeel. An overall great beer."

"World class APA, glad to have been able to enjoy a few pints of this on tap at the brewery with dinner and then walk away with a case to bring home."
"Bottle. Hazy burnt orange pour with a white head. Grapefruity hop aromas. Bitter and with bland almost grapefruit hops, but not really. Very unbalanced with little malt characteristics. Somewhat dry and uninspiring. Hey, the label is cool and I’m glad I got to try it..."
""
"O: An extremely hopped up pale; I’m pretty sure I’ve had a ton of IPA’s that weren’t this hoppy. Very delicious. Thanks again for your generosity, Erik."
"Medium body with a touch of harshness from the alcohol. Seems like the ABV is higher than 6.4%. Overall, seems more like an IPA than an APA."
""
"O: Having this on tap for the first time today at Three Floyd's Brewpub exceeded all expectations. Couldn't not have been happier with this beer... was even happier when I found out that they had cases available!"

"Overall - This is without a doubt the best APA I have ever had and also has the best aroma of any beer I have ever had. That being said I was a bit disappointed in the mouthfeel and the lack of a real flavor punch I would expect from a beer that is so highly rated. It is a fantastic beer and definitely worth trying, but is not quite to the pedestal that people put it on, especially compared to Hopslam or Heady Topper. I understand those are DIPA's versus an APA but just the fact that all three are rated in the top 20 for beers"

It seems as though each bottle is slightly different from the same case or six pack.

"Bottle: Poured a clear amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of grapefruit and citrus hoppy notes is quite sublime with some very limited bitterness notes. Taste is also totally dominated by the best fresh grapefruit hoppy notes I have ever taste. Some citrus notes are also present with bitterness being at a low level for that kind of hops attack. Body is average with good carbonation. I was sceptical about how good this beer could be but was I ever wrong."

"Drinkability: The absolutely best American style APA I""ve ever had (as if 7-21-13). And I expect it will be quite a while until one tops this. Seriously, if you can find this than get it! absolutely awesome! I wish this beer was always available in my area, too damn bad. First beer in a long, long, long, time that has really reshaped the beer world for me. This has become a standard for me now and I am going to be comparing other beers to this....lets raise the bar!"

"Really, people. Pay attention to style. Styles have meanings and characteristics for the purpose of judging. Three floyds calls this an APA when it is an IPA based on the IBU and other criteria. Judging this to be a 100 in the world of American Pale Ales is like saying the best type of apple in the world is a banana. If you don't pay attention to style parameters you shouldn't be judging any beers at all, because otherwise all we're doing here is telling the world what your OPINION is of a specific beer, and frankly, I don't care about your opinion if you can't even compare a beer against its supposed style guidelines."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Fantastic stuff. The hops just shine and make my mouth water for more. I could easily sit and geek out and enjoy one or i could go through a whole six pack in a sitting. ""Lives"" up to the hype. /97"
""

"Great lacing, from a Midwestern IPAD, Zombie dust is at the top of the heap"
""

"O- hop driven light apa. great citrus flavors and aroma. I could drink this everyday and never get tired of it."
""
""
""
"O: This is up there for me. A damned near perfect beer."
"Smooth and refreshing. Almost a bit smokey. Lingering aftertaste is great. Very well done, and I’m very glad I got to try this."
""
"Great beer. I guess I am lucky that one of the first good beers I tried is so high on the best beers list. Fantastic beer. It is very smooth when drinking even though it has an IBU score of 60. I will always purchase when it is available, but it is hard to find even though I live in Indiana."
""
""
"O - This is another flavorful APA from Three Floyds. I have missed this beer a couple times by one day at local bars. I have the generosity of a stranger at Brewery Vivant to thank for the opportunity to try this beer. I like this beer, but it seems overhyped. Although, it makes a great session beer. After having this beer I did crave another. Sadly, I will have to wait until August when I visit the brewpub."

"Amazing beer had on tap at Local Option in Chicago. One of the best beers I have ever had. Awesome balance of hops and super clean finish. Aroma is super inviting and pulls you into the glass. For an APA the mouthfeel was standard nothing to full but not weak either. Color leaves a little to be desired, the pale yellow was not super inviting. Wish I could get this in Orlando!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a rich copper color with a nice half inch white head. Smells of citrus fruits and hops. The taste is an excellent balance of citrus that hits my mouth on the front end, with a nice hoppy bite on the back-end. Hops are great balance and not overwhelming. Cannot taste any of the alcohol. A really great beer I could drink all the time, wish I had access to it here in NYC."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - Another well-balanced pale from 3 Floyds. This one didn't blow me away as the scores have suggested, but I found it rather enjoyable all the same. Definitely trade worthy, but don't overvalue on your end to get your hands on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"As someone who was raised on Two Hearted Ale, this is tough for me to say, but: Zombie is the best Pale Ale I have ever drank (I know THA is technically an IPA, but so should ZD be). Incredibly smooth and juicy Citra hops on the nose and on the tongue. Perfect level of carbonation. Excellent head formation and retention. Hops stay and stay after you are done. Perfect."
""
""
"Best Pale Ale I've ever had. Bottle has some badass artwork as do all three floyd bottles. A little Fruity definitely good hop taste and aroma. Very deserving of the high spot it holds on the list. Made a trade to get ahold of it definitely worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - More like an IPA in flavor profile, but easy drinking like a pale ale. Very nice brew."
""
""
""
"O - one of my favorites."
""
""
"Zombie dust was gifted to me by a liquor store mate who finds us rare beers in CA. The bottle at first glance is 100 percent awesome (A zombie king dark lord deal).Opening the bottle provided an aroma of smooth hops. The taste was unbelievable, It was completely everything you can ask for which provided a great hoppy taste which provides a lesser to stronger to a very lesser taste. Brushing around the pallet leaves your mouth thirsty for more. I was craving this beer for weeks after having tasted it. This is a jewel in my book, a very smooth fantastic tasting beer. Won't EVER pass up a zombie dust."
""
"overall: hate to say this, but did not live up to the hype. dont get me wrong, an enjoyable beer. but really not all that distinguishable from dozens of other pale ales and IPAs that are out there. I actually feel this way about a lot of IPAs, but this one in particular did not stand out one way or another and that bummed me out because I was so looking forward to trying it. It came off as just another hoppy IPA without any flavors that made me say wow. I could have been drinking a Sierra Nevada IPA or a Green Flash."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fantastic APA. At the end of the day, I think it represents the Pale Ale style nicely. Sure the hops are a little more aggressive than in your run-of-the-mill Pale Ale, but it is the pinnacle of the style. So glad I get to tick this one off."
""
"O-can't think of anything better than this. Only thing is I would call it an ipa instead of an apa. Went to buy a case at the brewpub and they were out. Crushing news."
"I notched my score up because I think someone who does like this style would probably love this beer. The smell is great. It has that grassy hop taste that is common to this style. But there is something silky smooth about Zombie Dust. It's aftertaste isn't just an aftertaste. It's more like this green velvet over coat for your tongue and the roof of your mouth. That's what really strikes me it's not merely an aftertaste but a coating you can feel and taste long after you've swallowed. I've never experienced such an amazing, live aftertaste. Zombie Dust is very hoppy, floral, kind of fruity and very tasty."
"My local bottle shop gets about a case a month of ZD and breaks it up with a two bottle limit and sells out in about two hours. I will be waiting on pins and needles for the next 30 days."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Holy crap, this is a tasty beer, an amazing amount of ""new"" hop flavors without being a ridiculous bitter bomb. Almost too easy to drink, I could finish a six pack in one sitting, but the alcohol would eventually catch up and that is a shame :) I keep flashing back to my memory of Masala Mama last summer (also an amazingly good beer). Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an extremely enjoyable beer with wonderful flavors and aromas from the hops - I really enjoy the combination of the citrus and tropical hops with just a touch of pine. I found the beer to be quite easy to drink and extremely enjoyable. I would drink this beer all the time if only I had easy access to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"3 floyds, way to kill it. Best apa hands down."
""
""
"O: I'm not a hop head but this is a very fine beer. Bitterness pushes more to an IPA vs APA to me but who cares. Glad to have it fresh too. I had my first Pliny the Elder recently and I didn't see the hype. This is worth it IMHO. crisp."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the only thing I would change is giving it a higher ABV. Aside from that, it's a chart topper that's easy to drink."
""
""
"First few times I had this beer I couldn't get enough of it., but It was quite hard to find here in Chicago so I believe it made it even more enjoyable since it was like finding that record you were always trying to find in the used bin at the local record store. Then suddenly I started noticing ZD popping up in many more bars on tap over the past few months. It's a really refreshing beer and one of my go to beers to grab a pint of after work. Although I am more partial to their darker creations, Three Floyds has really got something here and this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The medium body is exactly the strength needed for this beer, and the carbonation is at a good level. It's got a good, crisp bite while flowing like silk. The feel is close to perfect and I think the only, very slight shortcoming is the need for a little more nip."
""
""
""
"O - One word: perfect. Zombie Dust is to die for (pun intended). I wish I lived in Indiana."
""
"Zombie Dust is an excellent beer! I am glad that I got to review this beer, and I certainly have a lot of respect for Three Floyds out-doing Alpha King. Pale Ales and IPAs are so abundant and while this isn't the best that I have ever had, it is definitely a world-class American Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.5 This is one of my favorite beers. Great for many occasions - stronger than a session so able to hold its own, but very drinkable where a few won't put you over the top. I am a fan of citra hops, so I assumed I'd like this one going in. Wish I had more readily available access."

"this is incredible. especially in the context of being reasonably available sixer, I would have this in my fridge everyday if it came to Colorado. as it stands, I owe a big thanks to claystation for sharing this with me. it pours a glowing clear candied orange color with an inch of lacy white head on top. the nose is indeed citra heavy, and not to brag, but it smells a lot like my citra homebrew, just saying... the malt is light and toasty, balancing but letting the hops do the talking. they call this an American pale, and I am on board with that I guess, although to me its just a bit more of an ipa. the taste is from heaven, light and juicy hops, bursting with lemon essence and tropical fruits. its refreshing and quenching and satisfying and dynamic and delicious and close to perfect. the feel is very light, which I like, but perhaps just a tad more body would make this stand out even more to me. carbonation is of course right on, and this is far and away the best beer ive had from the highly acclaimed three floyds. zombie dust was a whale for me, one of those tough to find top ten brews, and it is one of the few that has actually lived up to the expectations, even exceeded them. I wish I could have this everyday."

"O: Damn I wish we got FFF here in MA, this is just an awesome Pale Ale, love the single citra hop, really showcases well with this brew ans overall its very tasty. The only thing I'm gunna knock it for is not having a bottle date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All around great beer. I'm surprised its taken me this long to rate as it's constantly in my fridge."
""
""
"Would I get ZD again? Of course. It's delicious, affordable, and brewed year-round, even if it's difficult to get off site. A fresh bottle of it would blow a stale bottle of any of the above listed beers out of the water, but that's not to say that it's better. The margin of difference between these top tier IPAs, DIPAs, and PAs is so slim that it's negligible."

"This is just wonderful , the flavors are all so complex but come together so nicely and make for one hell of a brew."

"I'm biased. Citra and Mosaic are my favorite hop variety. But if you enjoy citra, This is worth seeking out. You'll need the whole six pack."

"No other APA like it out there . Ordered on draft at Sonka's pub in Terre Haute, IN. I heard from a few different sources though, that this beer has been completely sold out in TH and the brewery ran out of ZB ingredients for the year. I guess I'll have to wait til next year :( FFF does it again with a top quality beer. Cheers!"
"This beer is awesome, and I don't think there are words to describe how awesome this beer is! Please drive ir get a partner who can send you this beer of gods to you! It's a must try! Everything about zombie dust is perfect! I am planning on moving to Munster, Indiana after this experience!"

"Overall-this is a great beer. I purchased this with some other Three Floyd's beers that must have been very old. This is the only that lived up to the hype. It's solid thru and thru if I could get more of it I would. The problem is I can't and could find stuff regular that comes close to this. Taking that out of the picture and rating this by itself I say it is a epic pale ale that tastes like a great IPA. 4.5"
"Now on the flip side: if this beer sits for a couple of weeks it becomes average. Over a month it's almost a drain pour. All in all, if you can get this fresh,by all means get it. You will dig it!"

"Overall - The king of these kinds of hops, similar hops to the Surly line are present, I love those hops. Super smooth even creamy with a bite and some balls. 100% recommend."
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic pale ale. One of the best I've tasted and a definite try."
""
""
"This is one of the best(if not the best) Pale ales out there. One of my personal favorites as well. Three Floyd's does no wrong. It's so flavorful and refreshing. Tons of grapefruit in taste. I would consider Zombie Dust an IPA, and would put it up there alongside Pliny and Heady."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - While hoppy enough to be an IPA in my mind, this is just so smooth to justify being an APA. Flavor explosion. Taste and mouthfeel are a 5 in my opinion. I wish I could raise more of an aroma from it though. That is the only thing that keeps it from being perfect for me. Still, undoubtedly one of the world's great beers. Well done!"
""
""
""
"O: I wonder if this bottle wasn't a little out of date, and I'd be keen to try it certainly fresh. As it stands, it's an interesting experiment that might be a little extreme. But I like it, maybe even love it. Recommended, but potentially overhyped."

"I've been waiting for a long time to try my first Zombie Dust, and finally the day arrived. I can't describe it as eloquently as my fellow BA members can, but it's simply awesome. Perfect levels of hops and malt to satisfy any beer drinker. Eye catching art as well on the bottle and six-pack box. Best beer I've ever had."

"Taste is a wonderful balance of citrus,piney resinous hops, and just the right amount of bitterness on the dry finish. Medium bodied and expertly carbonated, Zombie Dust dances gracefully over your palate, and the anticipation for every sip builds as you drink this fabulous Pale Ale. Completely worthy of the stellar ratings and all the hype surrounding it, Three Floyds really delivers a world class gem with Zombie Dust and it gets my highest recommendation for hitting all the right notes. Exploding with all citra hop goodness, Zombie Dust is a must have for serious hop hunters!"
""
"O: A top-notch pale ale. Very hoppy, but the clean finish makes it great for non-hop heads. The laces are amazing. This ale will open up, especially the smell and taste, so be patient."
""
"Overall, defently in the top 3 APA, i have had."
""
""
""
"UPDATE (1/15/14): This is very inconsistent from batch to batch, but it's always GOOD even at its worse. I prefer it when the tropical, stone fruit dank flavor shines, but the malt profile is something that is superb in this beer and always shines as very tasty even when the hops are a bit iffy. It's pretty much the most extraordinarily balanced and hyper flavored pale ale that's easy to get overall in the country, no doubt."

"Beautiful orange amber in color. Two fingers of rocky off white head emerges from a standard force pour. Thick waves of lace stay on the glass as the foam slowly fades. Nose is exuberant with bursting pineapple and floral resinous notes. Pine and dandelion comes through as well. With first sip I am taken by how refreshing this beer is initially. The hop profile of this beer really builds with bitter bite. This brew really has nice malty balance while letting the hops shine. Very juicy as the citrus plays nicely. Gets piney and prickly on the back of the tongue as it finishes. Mouthfeel is not without the appropriate bitter bite and a really nice tingle that is unique and very enjoyable."

"All around a very good and well balanced pale ale, just doesn't live up to the hype surrounding it. I can say that for it's type it's definitely one of the best I have had, but I rarely purchase pale ale's so I'm reviewing it from the perspective of someone who prefers an IPA and as such it doesn't match up."

"Overall: This is a great beer that I wish I could get locally. It is a beer that is so unique in it's flavor that it is hard to relax while drinking; it commands your attention. This is rare for a beer that is not overwhelming in its bitterness or flavor. Though the beers are not at all similar, Pliny comes to mind as another beer that can shock with the combination of both it's character as well as it's restraint. Excellent beer that I feel lucky to have been able to try!"

""
""
"One of a kind beer. Hard to find. In fact the place i work at we sold out in an hour and half the first time we got it. Nice dark golden color. Nice lacing. Smells hoppy and taste hoppy with a grapefruit finish. Wonderful feeling as i drank this beer. Overall a really great beer to try if you can find it . As always i pour my beer into a pint glass"
""
""
"O - Superb APA that may damn well be the best out there. That said, there are a number that get close and this is by no means a runaway winner. I look forward to having more of these in the future."

"Tried this for the first time at Craft Beer Fest in Bloomington, IN last weekend. Got the last serving they had. Was a wonderful beer. The color and aroma drew me to this beer. Am now a fan of 3 Floyd's Brewery. Heard this is a hard beer to find and have found that to be very true."
""
""
""
""
"Super hoppy beers that have a moderate (or lower) alcohol presence seem to be gaining popularity, and this beer is the benchmark for that category. Zombie Dust is definitely worthy of the accolades that it receives. Thank you Daniel for the opportunity to try this amazing beer AND for donating the proceeds to a terrific cause."
""
"Overall - Whether you normally like APA's or not, you need to get your hands on this one. It is absolutely out of this world fantastic and lives up to the hype. I also like the fact that it doesn't try to be more than it is; I'd drink this everyday if I could get my hands on it."
"O- This brew is glorious. Love it like I love Syd barett on valium"
""

""
"This is my first Zombie Dust ever, huge thanks to my FFF hook-up mpayne5. Really not much to say about this beer that hasn't been said already, so I will skip to the good part. For an APA it sure as hell drinks like a world-class, well balanced IPA, amazing nose and complex citrus-fruity taste. Great beer overall, best APA I have ever tasted, worth the wait, get this stuff by any means necessary..."
""
"As soon as I poured this beer into my frosted glass I could smell the fantastic aroma of citra hops bursting forth like an aroma cannon. It makes you feel like you will die of thirst if you do not take a drink. I like the mouthfeel on this beer, but not as much as the taste. Perfectly bitter with an unbelievable flavor profile that is well put together. I unfortunately only was able to have one of these magnificent beers, but it was love at first sip. The best APA I have ever had the pleasure of drinking!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring and feel. The sip starts super fresh, clean, and crisp, developing with warmth into this outrageously complex and well-integrated drink. The malts gave a unique softness, but solid flavoring and boldness, while the hops got dirtier, more herbal, and more spicy throughout the tasting. The hops then play off the malts, sullying them and dragging them down to an equally as gritty level. The feel was soft and personally contributory to the wholeness of this experience, helping to keep drinkability just below the force of a fire hydrant. Despite the changes to this beer as the sipping progresses, it always remains welcome on the palate, definitely living up to the hype. If this is the dust of the zombie I’m almost afraid to see what meeting one face to face would be like…"

"O: I've heard some say this isn't what it once was, but it's pretty damn close to what I remember from when I first had it, and that's pretty damn close to perfect."
""

"Overall...Yeah, I understand the hype. Definitely one of the best APAs (or IPAs depending how you categorize it) I've had. However, it didn't blow my head off and completely change my perspective on beer. Honestly, I don't think any beer can match the high expectations set for ZD. Still, it's awesome. Simply fantastic. Superb. So. Fucking. Good."
""
"I will be on the look out for more of this."

"O - How much do I like this beer? Let's just say that about once every two months my dad and I drive to Munster and purchase four 24-pack cases. This is one of my favorite beers."
""
""
"Popped open a 3-week old Zombie Dust and poured it into a Three Floyds teku glass.. Obviously. The beer is a beautiful orange color with a wonderful floral, hoppy smell. It is the perfect balance of sweet and bitter hoppiness, with citrusy notes and a smooth finish. I could honestly drink this every night and not get sick of it. That's how good it is. Lives up to the hype. No doubt. Definitely one of the best beers I have ever had."

""
""
"On tap at 3F brewpub. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this was a pretty spectacular beer. Beautiful texture, balance and taste. Not at all the hopbomb i expected, like most 3 floyds stuff. So much so, that I brought a case home with me. I'll be having a couple this weekend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not typically a pale ale fan but I'd choose this hands down over any other pale ale I've ever tried and many IPAs too. This is a smooth, hoppy treat that is very easy to drink. A must try for sure and I will most certainly request a bottle or two from any traders that can get it for me."

""
""
""
"On-tap at FFF brewpub. Pours a beautiful copper-orange color. Perfect head goes down relatively quickly. Smell - really nice citrus and hops. Taste - great balance of flavors. Appropriate amount of carbonation for the style. Overall - I bought a case to take home."

"o: no surprise, a top tier ipa, fff owns the style, citra ftw"

"Overall- I waited a long time to acquire one of these, and I am thankful I got to try it. Unfortunately I don't think it meets the hype associated with it. Don't get me wrong, it's a great beer, but a little bit of a let down. All nose forward but a little lacking in taste. Easy drinkability and very sessionable. I will definitely drink this again if the opportunity presents itself."
""
""
""
"The smell is nice and hoppy with tropical and citrus dominating. The taste follows suit. The hops are the focus, but this beer definitely has some malty flavors as well. It's a tasty beer! Mouthfeel was a bit resiny for my tastes, but still good. Overall, it's an impressive beer. Impressive that they could get that amount of hoppiness into a balanced beer and keep the alcohol under 7%. I would definitely drink this again. However, while I don't want to knock an excellent beer, temper your expectations a little, as # 7 on the BA list seems very high to me. I belongs on the list for sure, but not up that high."

"Overall - This really lives up to the hype for me, mainly because this looks and drinks so much like a clean balanced ipa. I barely get the bready character, its very subtle, but balances out the bright hops nicely. Really a great beer and one that I highly recommend. No alcohol presence whatsoever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Overall didn't blow me away with all the hype but it's a pale ale. I think I prefer Alpha King but I had that fresh on tap and I think this bottle is 6 weeks old. Still my 2nd favorite pale ale and and amazing beer."

"O: The beer itself does not blow me away as it is straight forward, not much complexity. However, I am extremely impressed the way the hops are showcased. FFF does something unique in their hopping process that other breweries do not replicate, and that does include the wild hop bombs of Sierra Nevada, DFH, Russian River..."

"What a beer! This beer made me a zombie. Instead of looking for juicy brains, I'll be looking for more of this delicious beer. Sometimes a beer will hide behind a cool label. This is clearly not one of those beers. The beer was just as good as the label. Would I drink another one? That's a stupid question. Of course I would. I would drink a six pack if I could find a steady supply. I would like to thank my good friend Matt for giving me the opportunity to try this sweet brew."
"D -Incredibly drinkable. I wish I had a year round supply. Great beer. My first beer from Three Floyds, and I can't wait to try more."
"My palate just had it's mind blown. Well, it's exactly what i was looking for. It's an IPA to me and it's world class. Peaches, pineapple, citrus, and other passion fruit - extremely tropical and a bit bitter, balanced as well. Mouthfeel is crisp, light, extremely drinkable. Overall this is IT!"

"Never had on tap but have had many bottles of this, and it is a truly spectacular beer. Fantastic aroma and hop profile, I am in the minority but as a huge VT beer fan, this one is in a league with Heady, anything from HF and Lawson's. Appearance is as to be expected, an orange-y color, nice fluffy head and lacing that lasts and lasts. I could breathe this stuff in all night if it wasn't also so tasty -- a spectacular smell and taste, and worth trying if you can."
""
""
"OVERALL: While this may be an overhyped beer, it isn't by much and it is certainly one I wish I had regular access to. It has also improved greatly since the first time I tried it a few years ago when it first came out. Perfect porch beer for a nice, warm afternoon."

After all the commotion this beer has caused in the forums for the past year or so, Id say it is slightly over the top with the hype that it received.

"Pours hazy orange with one to two finger fizzy white head. Strong hops aroma right out of the bottle. Packed with notes of citrus fruit, pine and floral undertones. Flavor is citrusy and slightly sweet balanced by bitter finish. Light to medium body with great carbonation. Absolutely my favorite IPA ""Pale Ale."" Combines all the best things about east and west coast IPA's."
"This is what I compare all ipa's too even though it is classified as a apa. Great beer, a must have for everyone."
"I could drink a 6 pack of these every night and die a happy man. Not to mention the price point. $35 a case or roughly $8.75 a sixer. I would gladly pay double that."

"For the price, an unbelievable beer, and one of the best... $1.50 a bottle, fresh from the brewery? Doesn't get better than that. Overall though, just an extremely good beer. Best beer ever? No, but close to it. Honestly, I feel like this would score slightly lower on a blind taste test. I think a good reason this beer is so acclaimed is because of its label, and especially, its name... America's become obsessed with zombies the past few years."

"The ale pours copper-amber with a thin, frothy off-white head, decent retention & excellent lacing, nice clarity. Aromas are a fruity, tropical nose with mango, pineapple, grapefruit, biscuity malt. Tastes are pineapple, mango, semi-pungent grapefruit rind, mild pine, biscuity malt, a touch of caramel, juicy, coats the palate, semi-dry fairly astringent on the finish. Pine-resiny, medium mouth-feel, nice juiciness. Overall, this is a superb American Pale Ale, but in my books Alpha King wins, but just by a little bit. I like the bready malt with more caramel. This seems to showcase the Citra hop more, while having a little less of a malt presence."

"the appearance is a glowing yellow. it smells very hoppy. a smell that you will come back for. the taste is a strong hoppy flavor. its just strong enough. its followed by a kind of sweet settling on the tongue. this is the best beer. you just have to try it"
""
""
""
"Overall (4.75/5): Zombie Dust is one of those highly-hoppy American Pale Ales that's almost an IPA. Some people might get caught up in stylistic hair-splitting...that's not for me. This is a phenomenal tasting ale that beautifully showcases the power of Citra hops. It's juicy, dank, fruity, mildly bitter, and will flood your mouth with wave after wave of hop flavor. There's a reason why this a legendary ale. Reputation earned and confirmed. Boom."
"Overall - Has to be the best APA out there, but I feel like I enjoyed it more on tap. I can only assume this is fresh because there is no bottling date."

"Poured 12pz into tulip glass. Pours slightly hazy orange with a finger of head. Smell is unreal, big citrus, pine, west coast style hops, the best smelling beer I've ever had. Taste is as good as the smell, west coast hops, pine, lemon, tons of citrus, floral, so clean, so crisp, so amazing. Overall this beer is definitely worth a top ten rating, I have no idea how it is considered an APA, there is almost no Mal flavors and the hops dominate. This beer is pretty much perfect, if you can get it, buy as much as possible. No matter how many times I drink it, it never gets old. Just wish they'd sell it in Ohio."
"Overall: As close to perfect as you can get for this style. While I personally prefer an IPA with more body and a little more malt, the hop presence in this beer surpasses that of most IPAs, even DIPAs. I guess technically an APA, it'd be hard not to call this an IPA. If you like your IPAs dry, clean, crisp, and ultra-hoppy, you won't find better."

"If I was able to get this as easily as I can Pliny, it'd be Zombie all day!"

"Overall A pitch perfect example of a west coast styled pale ale. The delicate and well balanced malt backbone of this pale ale really allows the new Citra hop varietal to really take flight and really showcase its many nuances. This is an incredible pale ale that really lives up to it's well deserved hype. Highly recommended."

"Zombie Dust. Recommended to me by a fellow beerfreak. By the way, I claim coin to the word beerfreak since I haven't seen it used. This is a good one. Quite pricey at 20 a six, but well worth it. Okay, the citrus is there as it is with all hopsy beers, but it stays constant. The same peppery, citrusy flavor throughout. Its obvious since there is only one variety of hops used. Okay, hops aside, this is a carefully crafted brew that the owners of the recipe want to get right. I think they did it. The hops crafting is the feature of this brew, but there is no skimping on the brewing. Body, taste, head, and mouthfeel. I like it. Not an everyday drinker, but a special occasion one. Good job Floyd, Floyd and Floyd."

"Pours cloudy hazy amber with a picturesque head of 1/4 inch thick foam. Grassy pine nose! Like a meadowy forest. There but subdued. Taste is a delicious malty open followed by a low riding pine hop. The bitter lurks below the surface and creates a flavorful blend.This is how a hop should be blended in a beer. Absolutely fantastic."
"Went to the brewery yesterday for the first time and picked up two cases, might be a little bit better on tap,but these bottles are amazing. I guess its a pale ale, but an amazing smooth citra hopped beer none the less. Amazing, Dust doesn't disappoint"

"Its without a doubt one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking! I stop by the The Floyds Brewery every time I get a chance. If your lucky they might have some for sale. They limit how much you can buy so I'll usually get as much as they'll let me. Its great out of a bottle but its even better on tap."

"Pours hazy orange into my tulip with a nice big frothy head. The smell is amazing, as expected. Floral citrus hops that waft up at you like candy. Piney grapefruit flavor, hits right on. Not as bitter as I had expected. Less carbonation than I was hoping for, and the finish comes off slightly syrupy. I guess I was expecting all hops. Strong malt profile here. That's a nitpick though, as the taste is all there and I love the citra hop aroma. All in all, a great pale ale. But given the (unfair) excitement over this one, it is a disappointment without a 5 rating. Very yummy stuff."

"O - Zombie Dust is one of the best beers I've ever had and it's for damn sure the best pale ale I've ever had. It has a massive flavor for its abv % and throws out notes you only get with the best double IPAs in the world. A remarkable feat if you ask me. It's as of a session Dreadnaught as you'll ever find. I just can't get over how stunning this ale is and the pure genius crafted into this. For me Dreadnaught is the World's best double ipa and this is of the same breed. I will buy this every single time I see it(I'm hoping it's often). It lives far beyond any hype you've read or heard. One of the brews with big expectations I've had and fulfilled all those expectations by blowing my mind."

"I was in Chicago last spring with a friend for a conference and this was far and away our go-to beer for the weekend. Had a great flavor, looked fantastic and finished like a dream. I'm in North Carolina now and, unfortunately, Three Floyds doesn't distribute here, otherwise I'd have a bottle in front of me right now. Good stuff. Highly recommended."

"Altogether an astonishingly delicious beer. The intensity of the hops reminds me of Pliny the Younger. The malt character is superbly crafted to balance the hops, with a touch of richness. Really well crafted."

"Decanted into a Three Floyds teku glass, of course, yo, light copper-colored liquid, pale and slightly hazy, capped off with a foamy white head that seemed to last forever, and that left waves of soapy lacing on the glass. Juicy citra hops greet the nose, and pretty much take control of the aroma, though there are hints of a pale malt sweetness in the background. In the taste, again, hops are the dominant factor, as I would have expected, lots of orange zest and some pithy bitterness, biscuity malts taking the edge off slightly, keeping this on the fine line that separates IPA from APA. Body on the lighter side of medium, crisp and clean, and a tasty, drinkable treat. Nothing here that I haven't had before, and nothing really that screams ""greatest APA in the world," but it's still a solid and tasty brew, will always be welcome in my fridge."

"Zombie Dust is undoubtedly excellent beer. I’m honestly shocked at how much flavor it has. The hop flavor really drives it into a class of its own. This really is the best American Pale Ale I’ve ever had. Wow! Find some."

"Overall: A fantastic ale…I hate hearing about how good a beer is before I try it, as the case here, but this brew lives up to the hype…the potent citrus flavor is balanced superbly by pale malts that could exist on their own and create a fantastic taste…it’s vibrant and light making it ultra drinkable…I could easily kill a sixer while playing poker or hanging out with friends…highly recommended, this will be an ale you’ll remember…(5/5)"

"Overall, its easy to see why this wicked pale ale is always in such high demand. Currently at #7 in Beeradvocate's Top 250 Beers, this is truly a marvel. A big, bold, flavorful pale ale gushing with pungent fruity hops. It manages to be complex yet extremely smooth and well-balanced. There's really nothing I would change about this beer. It may technically be labeled an American pale ale, but for me it is the quintessential IPA. It also has one of the best names and label art of any craft beer out there. A beauty to behold."

"An additional note on availability: if you live in the southern Indiana/Louisville, KY area, you can find some bottles at Bridge Liquors in New Albany, IN. They limit you to two bottles but at least they have it. Their major competitor in Clarksville, IN has this ale listed as ""in stock"" (even as I write this), but at 3 pm today they were sold out."

"Overall: This is probably a fresh bottle but it's been 4 months since I had it fresh at the pub (which blew my mind) and took home a case which I've enjoyed very much. I think my palate's evolved quite a bit with all the imperial stouts and DIPAs I've had recently- beers with more malt backbone. This is a very drinkable IPA (I don't care if BA calls it an APA) that showcases the Citra hops and what it can do given a minimal malt backbone. Honestly, after having had more APAs/IPAs, this is definitely one of the best I've had. I think a lot of it is branding (this beer didn't sell well when it was known as Cenotaph), limited distribution (almost but not quite brewpub only) and an otherwise excellent beer. Regardless, I enjoyed drinking this beer so I can't take too much away from it."
""
"O- way above the norm for a pale ale... this is up there with head hunter, white rajah for us ohioians... but this is like liquid gold for us as well for the limit that is in Ohio .... it is that good... and there is a reason why this is #13 on the list.... its that good and everybody backs it as that ...."

"I can see why this brew ranks as the #1 APA. It's extremely tasty and drinkable."

"Beer is medium-light in body, with superbly gentle carbonation that never feels fizzy, but still manages to foam the beer up on the palate. The result is a smooth, foamy mouthfeel that's as enjoyable as the aromas and flavors. Closes quite dry, with little residual stickiness across the palate, which invites taking another sip."
"12 ounce bottle, this just came to the store yesterday afternoon so I'm hoping it's a fresh batch. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with about an inch frothy off-white head that stays around for a very long time. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is nice and hoppy, it smells mostly like citrusy hops (grapefruit, mango, tropical fruits), along with pine hops, orange peel, and some light bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some floral/earthy hops noticeable, and a nice lingering bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit sticky, but also very smooth with moderate carbonation. I think this is a pretty good brew, I know I'd buy this again if I came across it. $10.99 a six pack and worth every penny!"

"The craftsmanship to this beer is second to none. It's an extremely well done beer. I don't look at it is as the ""end all, be all"" of IPAs, but it doesn't have to be. The way this beer is crafted makes it an automatic winner. It's a definitely a magical treat that I would enjoy anytime. Extremely well done."
""

"O- Easy drinking, flavorful APA that pushes the limits, and it's all about the taste."
""
""
"Finally got my hands on a six pack of this. I'd heard so many positive things about it, so I'm quite excited to finally be able to review this. It has a dark honey pour, very slightly cloudy with a thin foam head and very fine lacing. Scent of grapefruit, pine, earthiness, and more mellow citrus. So far nothing particularly out of the ordinary. Upon first sip, I figure out what its all about. Extremely well balanced combination of hops and malts that continue to mellow out in the aftertaste. I taste a hint of caramel in the aftertaste too, a really fantastic brew. Mouthfeel is perfect, light carbonation and a certain heaviness to it. Highly recommended!"

"O - Great beer and ever greater on cask. Easy drinking. Definitely grab a couple of glasses if they have it especially for only $5 for an imperial pint. The nose on this is even better than normal and as per usual, it's flavor packed"

"O- I am so glad I was able to try this. Only wish I had more than one bottle. Hopefully I will land more in a trade soon. ZD is definitely one of the best hoppy beers I have tried, and easily stands up beside Pliny and Heady. At this point, I am unable to decide which I like better....but Zombie Dust is magnificent!"
"Thanks to Tim from the beer club for bringing me a six pack today at work! Poured into my DFH pint glass. Beautiful hazy orange color with a nice head that give way to some decent lacing. I could smell it from across my desk when I poured it, the wonderful fruity notes from the citra hops! It reminds me a lot of the Laughing Dog citra hop ale they did for Capital Ale Houses 10th anniversary. ""I wish it were winter, we could make it into ice blocks and skate on it! And then melt it in the spring time and drink it!"" Yeah, wish I had more than a sixer."
""
""
""
""
"O - one of my top 5 IPAs of all time... Definitely should grab this one if you can"

"Finally received some more of this after putting it off for so long (thanks MCain04). I was afraid this time around that it wouldn't be as good. I was worried that maybe I had hyped it up to myself before and that I was overrating it big-time. I was scared that my palate had changed and Zombie Dust would no longer be the same sweet nectar I fell in love with the first time around. Luckily all of my worries were wiped away the second I cracked open the bottle, took a nice whiff and had another sip. This stuff is simply amazing. So perfectly balanced and so insanely drinkable. All things considered, this is still one of THE best beers out there, in my opinion."
""
""
"O - This is a beer that I had been trying to get for sometime and finally accomplished it over the summer. It lived up to the hype. I wanted to savor these over a few night, but had 3 one night and 3 the next."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A damn good beer. However, I believe it smelled better than it tasted. I feel like the pine overwhelmed the citrus flavors. But it is Three Floyds, they love their bitter hops. Lives up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
"O - stands up to its reputation; I've recently had Dreadknaught and Apocalypse Cow and while both of those have significantly more heat, Zombie Dust takes the cake with balance, flavor, and pale ale (IPA) perfection. One of the best beers I've ever had to date and being a hophead, something I can honestly session...if only I had cases of this!"
""

"12 ounce bottle poured into a small snifter. No bottle dating. Orange marmalade in color with a slight haze. White head, moderate retention. Oily clear lacing. Clearly loaded with hops. Aroma dominated by apricot hoppy goodness with a touch of malt sweetness hiding behind it. Taste obviously has a nice biting bitterness to it, the hops are citrussy and once again, apricot stands out with some grapefruit. Exceptionally easy to drink and very tasty."

"O - This is my favorite pale ale.Probably the BEST pale ale far as taste and balance goes. I love the citrus that offsets the dryness. Its not overly bitter that its smacks you, or ruins your taste-buds for the night. It's a really balanced and really refreshing pale ale. Glad I'm so close to the brewery so I can get this stuff whenever available. if you have the oppertunity dont hesitate."
""
""
"Taste is lovely citrus-tangy and hoppy, with a firm and heavy malt foundation. Still, the taste is predominantly hops, and this premium pale ale is absolutely a winner in my book. I'd repeatedly purchase if I could find this anywhere!"

"This is my new favorite beer. My favorite bartender here in Fort Wayne, IN suggested it to me and boy was he right! This is a new level for IPAs and honestly the new standard. I've been drinking beer for awhile now and honestly this is the best IPA I've had yet. If you ever get a chance to taste this direct from the tap I highly suggest it!"

""
""
"Medium body, medium, somewhat lively carbonation but retains a level of creamy smoothness as well. Terrific mouthfeel and simply terrific overall; does a lovely job of balancing intricate hoppy flavor with just the right amount of bitterness; the latter never overwhelms the tastiest aspects of the beer. Thanks to Mjmoser for a handful of ridiculously fresh bottles!"

"Masterfully crafted by one of the best. Really stands alone in quality. A tremendously tremendous craft!"

"Pours golden orange with a nice white head. Aroma of sweet tropical and citrus fruits with bit of a sweet bready malt underbelly. A very nice sweet and juicy flavor of some tropical and citric fruits, less malt presence in the flavor than was in the aroma. A nice, medium, active body. Overall, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome beer. Tops the list of APA's for me, wish I had consistent access to this."

"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a nice white head. Smell is tropical - mango, papaya, maybe a touch of a fruit cocktail syrup. A bit of grapefruit as well. Taste follows the nose mostly with the grapefruit and a bit of the tropics. There's also a really nice caramelly malt note on the finish that wasn't too noticeable on the nose. Ends with some really pleasant bitterness that invites you to take another drink. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with enough carbonation to keep it EXTREMELY refreshing. The beer absolutely lives up to the hype. Has enough complexity and intensity to keep it interesting while being refreshing enough to quaff. Can't get enough of this beer."

"Given the pedestal my beer friends puts this beer upon, I was a initially underwhelmed when I finally had a full pint in front of me. The beer was surprisingly clear and lacking in the nice creamy head I was expecting. The first fruity, citrusy whiff put those fears to bed, however. Delicious hoppy goodness with bits of orange peel. The taste follows with a nice hop punch and tastes of grapefruit. Just awesome! This embodies the smooth, fruity IPA/AIPAs that I love. Really great stuff that is not to be missed if you have the opportunity."
""
"O. A beer that crosses the boundaries between APA and IPA. Who really cares though as long as it tastes good. This beer definitely tastes good. Wish I had easy access to this as a year round staple in my fridge. 3 Floyds does excellent hoppy beers, and Zombie Dust is no exception."

"There’s really no denying that is an exceptional apa. It’s got 3Fs flair for sure, and nearly on par with Alpha King. Aroma is an A+. Tons of big, juicy, tropical citrus fruits, subtle pine, and vibrant florals. More tropical fruit here than usual 3Fs. It’s so hop fruity, but balanced with sweeter melon fruit, caramel, and cereal grains. The pour is decent, semi-translucent with a golden body, and fluffy creamy, starch white head. The body is light-medium (for a 3Fs product), big on flavor, though not quite perfectly balanced. Less of the great tropical fruit compared to the nose, but more lemon grass, strawberry, and melon starburst candy. Also, caramel and malted cereal with some light soapy qualities. Finish lingers very well with more florals and citrus. I definitely liked alot, but maybe not quite on par with Alpha King, though that is definitely debatable."
""

""

"Appearance is a light bronze/honey color with plenty of carbonation and a creamy-looking head. The smell is of grapefruits and oranges, and the infamous Citra hop, the only hop this brew is made with, refreshing. Taste follows the nose. Absolutely refreshing, clean, crisp, citrus fruit taste, with more pineapple, orange, and an alcohol sweetness coming into play as it warms. Clean, smooth, almost milky mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation keeps it light and highly drinkable. The hype is real on this, and in my opinion, it truly is the best APA on the market. Just swung by the brewery again to pick up another case of 24. Too good to pass up."
""
""
"Poured into a teiku glass. Very nice orange color with a soft white head. The nose is pretty outstanding all of the whiffs for what comes next...Citrus galore, grapefruit, orange, lemon zest and you get a bit of balance with some apricot and mango notes. The finish is nice and soft. Carbonation is medium. Fantastic beer there are some lucky folks who live near this brewery!"

"I can't say that it's better than Pliny, off what I'm having here. (It's dipa vs. apa and apples vs. oranges). But it's a good beer. I'll have to try it on bottles one day."

"O: A wonderful beer that I was very glad to get a chance to try on-tap. It drinks right on the edge of APA-IPA styles but feels more like a hefty APA than a light IPA, although neither of those would be wrong. A superb beer and I was surprised to find out it was brewed exclusively with Citra -- need to try brewing one of those soon!"

"D/O: This beer shines through the effective application of Citra dry hopping, with qualities that are usually reserved for draft only releases that briefly see the light of day at the nation's better beer bars. If it were an IPA, the smell would be questionable; as an APA it is satisfactory. It's appeal is mighty because the brewer was not tempted to over-reach and strive for a high gravity monster. Like some other of the best hops delivery vehicles around, this beer is better for being a ""mere"" pale ale."

"Part of my problem is this style of beer. I cannot make a unbiased opinion without the conflict of complaining that it is simply way too hoppy. I tried the beer while helping a friend make some home brew during a slightly chilly day. The beer did hit the spot but it just isn't up my alley. If you have an insatiable craving for more hops this is a great beer for you. I prefer a much more malty beer with hops to help balance it out."

"O- I give it a 5 over all because even if I have 4.5s in the judging scaled this beer works so well as a whole that it deserves a 5. FFF has really nailed the APA and I would consider this to be probably the best APA--IPA--Whatever hoppy beer out there. Pliny the Elder fans if you haven't tried this get ready for a contender."
"O- I've been drinking 3F beers since 2006, but to me, this blows away any other beer they have made. It easily replaces hopslam as my favorite all around beer. The only problem is that as it moves up the charts, it is becoming nearly impossible to get, even at the brewery (except on draft)."

"Overall: This is the finest beer on earth. At 6.4% it's pushing the upper limits of what you can realistically call an APA, but it doesn't matter what a beer is categorized as when it tastes like this."

"Probably one of the best APA/IPA's I've ever had. I have had it dozens of times on tap and out of the bottle and neither disappoint. A light color with little to no head. The aroma of citrus hops dominates. The taste is very similar to the aroma with a nice rich citrus hop. Balance perfectly with the right amount of hops and malt to make one of the tastiest pale ales in the world. This is what you would expect from a world class APA or slightly less hoppy IPA"

"I've had this beer on tap at 3 Floyds and in bottle. It doesn't disappoint in either format. Pours off golden color with off white head. Aroma is fantastic. Dank resinous hops dominate the nose. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor is intensely bitter, with some citrus and some dank taste. Just awesome."

"355mL thanks to vw73182. Bottle release from the XV anniversary party. About two weeks old. Pours a clear amber orange with a towering, massive, rocky, off-white head. Sheen appearance with ridiculously insane, webby lace. Big sheets of complete lacing. Nose is huge orange juice, ultra dank mango, pineapple, mild sweet onion, pineapple flavored alcohol. My girlfriend thinks it smells like caramelized onions with meat...not necessarily bad. It certainly is not just a citrus/floral hop aroma. I would place the nose more at something like tamarind or other meaty Asian fruit we are not as familiar with. As it warms it gains more starchy character and sweet potatoes. In general, the nose starts off explosive and mellow out so no reason I see to let this decant like most beers. Taste has a nice biscuity quality to stave off astringency. Huge orange juice, ultra quenching malt character, with mild pineapple like alcohol and meaty fruits like jackfruit and durian. Very soft biscuity, quenching mouthfeel with decent amounts of butterscotch richness I get from Sculpin, Duet, and Alesmith IPA. Hot damn this is good. I’ve now had about three bottles of this over the past few days and the palate gets super quenching, small orange juice acidity, citrus fruitiness. Whoa. Like APA category demolition right here. Forget about topping this ever. Well, maybe fresh Spring Peeper. Perhaps a little boozy for the style but who cares. Would be dangerous as a session beer. 12/1/2011 8/5/8/5/16=4.2"

""
""

"O: Wow, this was really good and thoroughly enjoyable. I'm not sure I would go through the headache to get more, but it does (almost) make me wish that I lived in Indiana again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't know what else to say about this beer. Current trends are definitely going towards bigger and better. While Zombie Dust is not an exception to this (it is a pretty strong APA), it does highlight that fact that there are still AMAZING beers that aren't 9% abv. and 120 IBU's."
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: This was sent to me in a trade. He said that he picked it up 15 minutes after it was bottled! It's about a week old now, so this is obviously a fresh sample. It ranks up there with Pliny & Heady IMO. The lingering bitterness is a very welcome attribute. Hope to have this one again. Cheers!"

""
""
"Oh my gosh. One of the most flavorful beers with ease of drinking. This is one of the best beers I have ever had. But then everything I have had from Three Floyds has been awesome. Worth the hype. Beautiful color. Incredible smell, hops and malt and hops and malt. Just an incredible nose. It tastes like liquid gold and the gold coats your tongue with so many complex flavors. This is a top american beer. Three Floyds is incredible and Zombie Dust... fantatstic."
""
""
"O - A great citra hops beer. Simple all over, but nicely made. I would like to do a tasting of all these top IPAs sometime to see how they stack up against each other. There are so many similarities, it is hard when they are not tasted together."
""
""
"O – This really is a nice beer, but perhaps it wasn’t as fresh as it could have been. I will seek this out again to make sure I give it a fair shot, but to me, Citra is a way better example of this hop."
""
""
"O- This beer is nearly perfection for the category, only reason I say nearly perfection is because I don't believe anything is perfect, but this is damn close. One of my top 5 beers of all time."
""
""
""
""
"O- Awesome beer, I could drink these all day. It gets more harsh as it warms, I prefer it ice cold."
"Overall: Even though I only live about 30 minutes from Three Floyd's I for some reason did not make the trip out there to get me some of this sweet nectar until about 2 weeks ago. It is absolute perfection especially on a hot summer day. Oh who the hell am I kidding it's perfect any time!"

"Overall it wasn't really what I expected, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. However, I really didn’t find it to be as full on hoppy as their Alpha King. I think I actually prefer it over Zombie Dust. Granted, I only had 6 oz of the “Dust” so I really need to enjoy a few more before awarding it the silver medal."
""

"Bottle on the RBSG 2012 bus. Clear orange with a sudsy white head. Piney aroma, grapefruit, pineapple and nectarine. Flavor tends a little more toward herbal with sap and resin, snappy citrus fruit framed by subtle malt. Crisp, flavorful, dry. Good stuff."
"Review #1!"

""

"Overall: One of, if not my favorite beer. Always a joy to drink this."
"O: I dont get the hype here.  Its a decent beer, but I am by no means blown away.  I definitely thought Alpha King was better, and to me it remains the standard of the style.  This one was good, but nothing special.  Maybe shipping in the warm weather hurt this one (but I think that may be giving it the benefit of the doubt as I get the majority of my reviewed beers from shipped trades and usually dont notice ill effects).  A fine beer that I would purchase again if it were a local, but not something Id seek out or trade for again.  Glad I got to try it though.  "

"O: A number of damn fine Pale Ales out there. This one may be a bit past its prime given its age of three months (fresh from the brewery the day of bottling), but I am not sure this lives up to the hype. Fantastic presentation of the Citra hops but a beer like this could use a tad more head and carbonation in my option, but we all like something different. Take away some of the pine resin on the back end and this one would hit my personal sweet spot dead on! Overall, an excellent brew… one of my 20 IPAs for sure!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Probably one of my top 5 favorite beers. It just such a nice taste and body and finishes so smooth. A great beer to sit back with and enjoy on any occasion."
"O: this one lives up to the hype…plain and simple. Excellent smell, extremely tasty, high drinkability. Love the tropical notes to this one. Definitely one of the best, if not the best of this style."
"O: A pretty brilliant success, and a truly good APA. I received a 6 pack, and I'll be happy to share it with multiple friends. There's some excellent hop characteristics throughout on this, but my oh my, if only the taste was as good as the nose."
""
"Best aroma ever from a glass here with superb hop bouquet of perfection: aromatic nirvana for me. Sweet grapefruit and pine as well in there, and if somehow in a tropical way the taste follows suit. Nice, nice drinkability, finishes crisp and bitter with a very appealing lingering hop flavor. I guess I really favor citra hops!! I'm trying to pinpoint any slight shortcoming here but I'm already at the last sip and haven't come up with anything. Even though the malt backbone was nice it was backstage of the hop florality (new word) and I like it that way. I'm biased toward anything IPA/ DIPA, and AIPA is the least visited of the style for me. But of the ones I've tried, this does it. Superb. Easily in my Top 3 ever. I'm only sorry I can't purchase it in my state. "

"Had it on tap at the Brew pub in Munster. Pours a nice amber color with a two finger head. Nice lacing that seems to linger. Smells like a hop lovers dream. Taste is a fantastic hoppy flavor that finishes like no other. Mouthfeel is a medium balance of thickness. My first thought was wow, now I get it. A world class beer for a reason. Seek it out my beer loving friends."

"O: Being from NY, I was happy to run into a guy at my local beer stop that was looking to trade these. Definitely lives up to the hype and is worth trading for if you can get your hands on it. I just wish FFF extended their distribution to the east coast instead of planning their new brewery in Europe."
"The body is well-balanced and carbed up well. Crisp and clean, not too heavy. Holds its own with the ABV. Hops, hops, hops. Yes, please. Fresh green hops, grapefruit, melon, orange slices, honey - all melded perfectly to make this splendid beer. This beer is bitter, no doubt, but I love that it doesn't linger in any harsh manner. The finish is short, which I like and don't like at the same time. I like that it keeps me sipping (or gulping) more and more, but I don't like that my glass is soon empty, unable to be filled with this blessed brew again. More ZD, please!!!"
""
"The beer pours a light rusty orange with an off-white head. The beer's nose is incredibly dank and defines a crisp citra hoppiness. However, there is plenty of malt sweetness, which makes a huge impression on the beer's taste and mouthfeel. Thankfully the abrasively bitter hops didn't melt off my eyebrows and taste buds because the mouth watering, bitter-dry finish makes this beer something special. I would easily drink this beer all day and actually have trouble not finishing it within 5 minutes after opening. Get your hands on some and thanks Pellinore1 for the hook-up."

"This has a huge floral hop character with some spicy, citrusy notes as well. It's incredibly hoppy, incredibly drinkable and very smooth. I'm glad I have a few more bottles to enjoy."

"First one poured into a Weyerbacher tulip glass. A karate kick of tropical fruit right to the nose, amazing. Orange, pineapple, And mango. The taste brings the same.. orange peel, mango, pineapple. Some spice and a little bit of a malt back bone. Tangy, sweet, slightly bitter and delicious. Three Floyds always comes correct, handled the Citra hops just perfectly with this one. Thanks Rudi."
""
""
""
""

"O- One of the best made with the best by one of the best."

"I'm definitely impressed! One of the most flavorful pale ales you'll ever have, but done in a clean and easy to drink way."

"Another awesome beer by Three Floyds. I'll have to work out some more trades for this stuff."

"Pours a darker golden color with orange hues with a two finger bright white head, great retention and abundant lacing as the head recedes. Extremely fragant with the smell of citrus rind, freshly cut grass, and orange blossoms on the nose. Opens with pleasant citrus, tangy to slighly bitter, a very light touch of sweet malt, and finishes dry, crisp and clean with citrus rind and a touch of pine and the perfect amount of bitterness. An very refreshing APA, which shows a surprising amount of complexity for a brew that uses only Citra hops."
"O: Ready for the apocalypse. Best pale ale I've had. Truly worth all the hype. Excuse me, I have to pop a few walkers in the cranium now."
""
""
"O: Definitely one of the best pale ales I've had, and much better than Alpha King."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer very much and will have it again if given the opportunity to do so."
"This beer pours out a hazy orange color with a decent head. The aroma is absolutely fantastic. This is one hoppy beer for sure, it's almost like sticking your nose right in a bag of hop pellets. Tropical fruits and citrus are the stars of the show. The taste is also absolutely fantastic, it's seriously a hop assault of the first order. The relatively low ABV keeps the malt profile to the absolute minimum (there's just a bit of pale, slightly biscuity malts if you can cut through the hops), letting the brilliant Citra hops shine through. Orange and grapefruit come out big on the flavor, leaving the tropical aspects to more of a backing flavor. Either way, it's fantastic. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and leaves the kind of dryness that's really quite similar to biting into a hop pellet, just on a much smaller scale. There's that much hops in here, guys. The drinkability is outstanding. Overall, this is the king of pale ales/IPAs for the hophead. Superb in every way."
""
"O - This is a flawless beer. Absolutely fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, yes this is very good. Didn't quite live up to what I was expecting, probably because people talked it up soooo much. Similar to many American IPAs I've had. Beyond that, not quite sure it's worth all the fuss it has received. It's delicious, but there's nothing especially unique or different here."
""
""
"O - Overall, if you have a chance to pick this up, definitely give it a try. Most people absolutely love it. But personally, I think there are better IPA's on the shelf that you don't have to hunt down to find."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I see the hype and glad that a pub across the street from me has this on tap I seriously love this beer I really reminds me of pliny the elder with all the hop oil and bitterness denfintly a must have so much I think I will have a 3rd just cause"
"This is an excellent Pale Ale. I have had many IPA's that are not as hoppy as this Pale Ale, but this beer is extremely well balanced. The flavors are spot on and this is probably the best APA I have ever had. Thanks again to Shrode21 for the trade, this stuff rocks. Now, can I copy this with my homebrewing skills?"
""
""
"But is this the best thing ever brewed in the history of mankind? Don't think so. Come on, it's a pale ale. Get over it."
""
"O - Just a fabulous APA although truth-be-told, it is more IPA than APA. Great, great stuff. Unfortunately for me, when I went to order my second pint with dinner, the waiter told me I'd my first glass killed their keg. A well; at least I got to taste it fresh on-tap less than 2-hours from the brewery."
""
""
"There was no gushing when I removed the cap, but there was a finger of thick, tawny head by the time that I finished with the pour. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose was rich with citrus - grapefruit and orange in abundance. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a citrus intensity on the tongue that killed off all of the weak taste buds that got in its way. I felt like the fellow in the old Maxell tape commercial - blown back in my seat by the intensity of the experience. The finish was literally breathtaking - I really felt as though my breath had been taken away for a second or two after the swallow. The next thing to hit was the intensity of its dryness as I tried to catch my breath. The hops were toying with me to see if I measured up and I was doing my best to rise to the challenge. I suppose that my loss means that I will be transformed into a zombie at some point, but if a transformation must take place, better in my mind to be a zombie this way than a Cyberperson via a Minhas product."
"O: This is my favorite new brew. I had read great things about this beer for 5 years, and have been waiting patiently to get my hands on it. Anytime anyone wants to trade this beer to me, I will not turn it down. What a great combination of hops and grain! I continue to be amazed as I drink this beer."

"Overall: Again, get some of this fresh if you can. Nothing like it. My favorites of this style in San Diego are Hoppy Birthday and New Millenium from Alpine Beer Company, but they have nothing on ZD. If this was on the shelf here along with Pliny, Sculpin - ANY of our stuff, I'd pull the ZD every time."

"Thanks very much to BA apocalypsezombie for beering me this gem!"

"Surprised it's marketed as an American Pale Ale and not an IPA or even a Double."
"Overall, a wonderful showcase of the Citra hop. It's easy to see why Three Floyd's has struck a chord with this beer."

"o- overall, i am looking forward to drinking another one of these. this is my first FFF beer and i am very pleased!"

""
""
""
""
"O: Amazing drinkability. Best pale ale I've had if you want to call it that, though it is borderline IPA to me."
"I have to give this beer 5's all the way across. There is nothing that compares to this beer in the APA style. The Smell is unbelievable.. with grapefruit, mango, and other tropical fruits. Following the nose, the taste is pretty much on point. Excellent citrus flavors with a nice crisp citra hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is slick and creamy with medium carbonation."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. Best APA i've ever had and best beer!"
""
""
""
"I had this on tap at Three Floyds. It is a golden color with a strong floral and citrus aroma. Taste is loaded with floral and citrus hops with a nice orange flavor and without a strong alcohol presence. This is an extremely drinkable and delicious beer."
""
""
"Pours a clear, deep golden color with no head. Head never developed as a consequence of the care taken in the pour by the attendant. Incidentally, it was nice to see that the 3 Floyds staff were just as cheerful as ever *sarcasm*. Even as guests of Firestone-Walker after having been invited to their beer festival, the 3 Floyds staff were lifeless, provided no information about their beers, and couldn't even muster a smile or spare a ""you're welcome."" Anyway, back to Zombie Dust. The beer has a glorious floral bouquet with just a hint of peat. The mouthfeel, which enjoys a decent balance of carbonation, is good for the style. The flavor is grapefruit forward with notes of peat. A good effort."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer rocks and I'm leaving it on my wants list!"
""
""
""
"On tap at the Three Floyd's. Smell is strong and crisp. Glorious hops. This is one of my favorite beers. So glad I got to have it on cask. Everything is so strong and pronounced. I can't think of one thing I'd change about this beer. I wish FFF distributed to CT. This might be my favorite beer. No carb room temp... Hell yeah! Adds so much to this beer."
"Pours a Hazy Gold from the bottle. Smells like a pure Hop liquid from the bottle. Maybe the best smelling beer ever. The taste is not as strong as the smell, but still great. This is a very smooth and drinkable beer, Even with all the hop flavor this is a beer I could drink while working in the sun. Great beer here by far my favorite Three Floyd's I have tried."
"O- it's and APA bordering on an IPA if you ask me. It's a fantastic example of either style."

"Big thanks goes out to pmoney for sending me this one as an extra in a recent glassware trade! Served from bottle into a Boulevard Smokestack tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, citrus, citrus hop, pine, and pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, earth, and pine hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. Holy refreshing as crap Batman!!! I had this one back when it was called Cenotaph and figured I would have to revisit it now that it is bottled. And I am quite glad that I got the chance to do so. The balance on this one made it quite easy to drink and quite nice to smell as well. I actually found myself taking HUGE mouthfuls of this brew rather than sipping on it. Not sure if that is a good thing or bad thing, but I definitely didn’t mind. Still one of the best American Pale Ales I’ve had. Get this on your palate!!!"
"Nose up front of pineapple and orange zest. The taste is citrusy sweet with tangerines fading into lemon and finishing with slightly grapefruit notes. This is without a doubt the best pale ale I've ever had. For me pales are usually too mellow and bland but this guy could stack up to any IPA just without the bitter bite."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a tropical hop bomb; it's not nearly as citrusy and hoppy in the taste compared with what's in the aroma but it's good stuff"
""
"Moderate amount of carbonation, and a moderate body. The beer finishes quite dry but with no lingering flavors, it's just.. dry. While this is a good beer, I believe it is over-hyped a bit."
""
"O: A great beer, overall, with the best aroma of any pale ale I've ever had. Unfortunately the flavor doesn't quite match the aroma and the body is a bit watery, but it's still a fantastic beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad APA. This beer smells great but the taste doesn't line up. I prefer the readily available Alpha King to this. For a Citra bomb, there are better options. Many thanks to Rochefort10nh for the trade."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice dark straw color slightly amber. Incredible nose to this beer when it's fresh, beautiful citrus, fruit and floral notes with some sweetness, kind of like a nice mountain breeze, I could almost just sit here all day and smell the nose, had I not then tasted how ridiculously good this beer is next. The taste is so well balanced with the hops it makes this by far the most drinkable beer I've ever had. Sweet but not too sweet, bitter but not to bitter. The malts are a slight caramel mixed wonderfully with citrus notes of the hops. Just an incredible example of the pale ale category."
""
""
"Poured a nice strawberry blonde with maple tones. Huge hop floral nose. Tropical fruits, grassy/herbal notes, grapefruit rinds. Very light malt background. The grassy/herbal bitterness dominates the flavor however. I would have preferred more of the fruits. Regardless, a nicely made pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Hands down the best APA I've had and easily in my top 5 beers of all. It lives up to the reputation and at $35/case, I don't think I'd buy much else if I lived near FFF."
""
""
""
""
"Recieved in a trade with Chicago John, thanks buddy for the ample stash of ZD. After reading so much love for ZD I am stoked to finally sit down and sip a few. Poured into a tulip. Maybe the best looking brew I have seen, sunset orange with super thick sticky two finger bright white head that clings to the glass leaving beautiful lacing. The nose, maybe as good or better than Kerns Citra, I can just happily sit here and smell this for hours, tropically dense from the Citra, amazing. The flavor profile is citrusy, sweet, balanced, and a tad bitter from the 60 IBU, perfect.The mouth is crisp, clean, and medium weighted, perfect for this holiday weekend at the shore. If there is perfection then ZD is it, the best APA I have ever had. Sadly not available on the west coast, happily sitting with two six packs to enjoy over the next couple weeks. Bravo 3 Floyds, the hype is more than justified."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice APA, that is very drinkable but there are better American pales out there and for all the hype this beer gets I was thoroughly disappointed. Really nice hoppy nose and good bitterness but the mouth feel and finish disappoint this hoppy pale ale fan. In the end slightly above average 85pt beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had zombie dust a number of times now. a few times on tap and I always pick up a couple six packs when they have it at the brewpub while I'm traveling through. poured from the 12 oz bottle into a pint glass it is a clear dark yellow color with a nice crew color head. The smell is citrus and earthy almost (like grassy and wheat). The taste is very crisp and I love citra hops. The beer is very well balanced is a stand up IPA. I'd take it every time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A wonderful beer, looking forward to moving out to Indiana and being able to have this year round."
""
""
""
"M: Clean and hoppy, with an emphasis on the hoppiness. Orange zest and bold citrus standing out against the surprising malt side. I'm afraid that I'll finish off this six pack one one fell swoop."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is one hyped ale, and I can see why. It is no doubt of the west coast style, but it is none the less a very unique beer. It is much hopier than any APA I have had, but it is also much more balanced than any West coast IPA. The bitterness is very smooth, but the hop flavor is extraordinarily large, a trend that has been occurring more and more as time goes on. A fantastic ale, no doubt in my mind, I would always keep this in my fridge if I could."
""
""
"On tap at Macniven's for craft beer week. Poured a very nice mid-deep copper with fantastic head and a bit of nice lacing as it went down. Very nice scent, a wonderful citrus bitter hoppiness with a good malt sweetness underneath. Great flavors, a nice sweet malt with hints of caramel and a wonderfully citrus and slight floral hop finish that stays on the tongue for a nice bit. Wonderfully smooth, as well."
"O - Great beer that lives up to the hype. I was skeptical at first being that I've never had a APA I've really liked before (except Hoppy Birthday) but this gives the APA category a good name."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not writing ZD off. And I'm not hating on them. In fact, if offered I will try again. I'm not scared off of this one, just a little perplexed by the hype."
""
""

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is crisp and very easy drinking. If made readily available to me, I would drink this regularly and in excessive quantities."

"Hazy dark orange with a white head, modest head and good lacing. Nose is all citra, mango, peach, apricot and the 'pittiness' of these fruits really comes through. Sweet malt, and some pine on the back end. Fantastic consistency as soon as this touched my lips, more peach and mango pit, sweet malt with a hint of caramel. Brilliant mouthfeel - fairly full, with some consistency, and something that I think should really be the gold standard for the style. Moderate bitterness, and easily consumed. A top-tier APA."
"O: What to say? Really this is an IPA in Pale Ale's clothing. I suppose given it's 6.2% abv, it's given a pass but this is an excellent beer regardless of what the style is."
"You can have your elite dipas. This APA puts them to shame. The best Pale Ale in the world!!"
""
""
""
""
"O- I find it hard to believe anything is perfect but I simply cant bring myself to give this beer anything less then a perfect score. This is my first perfect 5 rating after almost 200 reviews and I don't see myself giving another, at least for a long time. Everything about this beer is incredible, the price, the taste, the feel, the label art, the availability... well not for most of us but at least its guaranteed fresh. For a hop forward pale ale, this beer may just be perfect."

""
""
"Ov: What a great APA! Probably more of an IPA given just how hop forward this beer is. I wish there could be a case of this in my fridge year round."
""
""
"O- Gonna have to go back and re-rank those that I put close to this one. I am putting it up there as one of my favorites of all time. I could drink it all day, yet it has a powerful punch that lets me know I am drinking real beer."

"(D)- Fits the bill perfectly; this is how I have always imagined what my ideal pale ale is. A great profile and just a pure overall enjoyment factor. I have never been a huge Three Floyds fanboy, but this might be their crowning acheivement. At the same time, it has been a long long long time since a pale ale has really impressed me like this one has."

"Poured into a nonic a clear medium golden with a large fluffy white crown that settled very slowly into a frothy mass.A big shot of grapefruit hops hits ya in the nose along with some overripe tangerine,a sweetish biscuit malt is noticable as well.A healthy dose of citric hops over top of sweet biscuit on the palate,more fruity hops than bitter.A great pale ale,it has a huge dose of hops but it's actually a pretty rounded palate."
""
"O-If there is a perfect session beer for hop heads this is it. Its strong, aggressive and multifaceted while still being easy to drink. Pretty awesome stuff. I only wish it was in Colorado..."
"Overall looking forward to tracking down more of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Okay, let's be honest, this isn't a Pale Ale, right? It's so hopped up I'd easily consider this an India Pale Ale. The profile is akin to the classic West Coast style with its big juicy tropical fruit notes. The hops are kept in check but it's certainly over the top for a Pale Ale. Because it's not in style, in my opinion, I knocked the overall down a bit. Still it's a damn tasty beer."
""
"Boy, I thought their Alpha King was the be-all-end-all of APAs...and then I try this. Wow. Amazing beer, redefines the style. Probably the hoppiest APA I’ve ever had. Fantastic."
""
"O: Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of my new favorites. Every sip made me smile. It’s rare when a beer is everything you thought it would be, but FFF has done it before (cue Gumballhead, Rabbid Rabbit, etc.). Now I’m wondering if the Dark Lord in my fridge will live up to the hype…at any rate, I’m much more confident now that it will. I need to take a trip to Munster, ASAP."
""
""
""
"O - I am very happy that I picked up a case of this on my way into Chicago. I wish I lived closer to the brewery, so I could spoil myself like this more often. Oh well makes it that much more special. I would def recommend this to anyone who can get it!"
"O- This was a good beer however I don't think it lives up to it's hype. It tasted good, I just thought it had a little bit too much of a sugary taste and not a ton of flavor for a highly ranked beer. It was very easy to drink and one of the better pale ales I've had, but I definitely wouldn't say it's one of the best beers I've had (one of my least favorites on the top 100 list). That being said I enjoy drinking it, as a beer in a 6-pack it's definitely worth it, but I don't think it is necessarily a must try although I recommend trying it if you get the chance."
"Putting it in 12oz bottles and charging 35 dollars for a case is awesome, FFF. Nice to see you price something reasonably on occasion."

"Pours a slightly hazy goldenrod color with a 1/2 inch talk head in my tulip pint. Head is cream colored and rather dense, pretty decent retention. Wow! Aroma is fantastic. Citra hops come through strong and sharp in my nose. I could smell this all day. Bit of pine, lotta citrus. Taste is mellowed and more appropriate for an APA (though you won't hear me complaining) I taste citrus sweetes in the middle of the palate and get a resonant pine bitterness aftertaste. The mouthfeel is spot on for an APA, medium/light body with carbonation enough to liven the beer. This is a great beer, it's unfortunate this isn't sold out here in Oregon/Washington."

"Zombie Dust has set the bar for APAs. The citra hop aroma and flavor profile is unmatched. Tropical, fruity, bitter and balanced to near perfection. World class stuff and a must try."
""

"Overall: world class is exactly what this beer is. Don't know if APA is the best label for it, but FFF delivers on all levels with Zombie Dust, will definitely seek again"
""
"Excellent beer all around and worthy of the praise."
"O: A very strong Pale Ale, fits style well, a little hoppier than expected, but I'm learning 3Floyds tend to roll that way. Glad I got a six pack at the brewpub. Will definetly enjoy a few more of these."
""
""
""
"O: Many American Pale Ales straddle the thin line between APA/IPA. To me this beer has crossed over and sits pretty firmly in IPA territory. Not that I'm complaining though. They can call it whatever they want, as long as it's still a damn good beer. Very high marks for this one. It lives up to the hype. Seek it out and drink it."

"O: after trying a 3 month old version, this less than a month old version is beautiful, though the taste could still be improved."
""
"Pours a lovely golden orange color with a touch of copper, medium cap of bubbly white froth, good sticky lacing, bright but lightly hazed. Scent brings big whiffs of pungent grapefruit, some pine resin and a good blend of tropical fruit and citrus, mouthwatering, lightly sugary sweet and modest detection of light caramelized malts. Taste is not as bold or as devastating as the scent had me fearing, but this is a pale ale... strong bitter grapefruit notes, followed by more citrus and tropical notes, fruits come across as more rind than juice. Sweet in a juicy way with a touch of lightly caramelized malts. Bitter, lightly drying on the palate, good body. Overall, a very enjoyable APA with strong flavor and scent notes."
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the better Pale Ales I've had but not the best."
"My first beer purchase on ebay and man was it worth it. A dark gold pour with a medium sized white head. Resinious, citrus hop smell hits you immediately. Flavor is grapefruit, mango, and lemons. Very tasty brew with the enough malt to round it out. Would love to have at my disposal."
"Overall, best apa I've had. If the bitterness were a bit more dominant, there's enough hop flavor to push the ipa envelope."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of pineapple and apricot notes, as well as some bread and biscuit malt. The flavor is just as good if not better. I get a ton of hop characteristics, including a lot of pine, orange and resin notes. There is also a good bit of bread and biscuit malt, and the bitterness level is low to medium. The beer is extremely drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
"O: Great beer, wish it was distributed locally!"
"O: Very good pale ale, but just a touch too grassy upfront for me."
""
""
""
""
"Cpolking comes through big time, sending this beer. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a brownish /orange color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of tropical fruits, hops. Taste is the same, lots of fruits, citrisy, hoppy, some bitterness, a good malt balance. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a top notch beer worth seeking out."
"this stuff is great right down the line, I wish I had this sort of brew to put in my regular rotation around here, for now I'm going to thank the most awesome Rutager for sending me a bottle"
"O - So glad I finally got a hold of some of this one. Very complex pale ale, I wish this was available locally"
"overall really enjoyable love the hops"
"This is the most wonderful glass of beer I have ever enjoyed. Everything thing about it is perfect. Nice smell of hops and citrus but nothing too over-powering. Hops are very flowery and crisp with notes of grass and caramel. Completely well-balanced. Here in Chicago it is hard to find six-packs (even at top-notch bars)."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's full of hop character but light and not boozy. It's big but it's true to a pale ale root. Even at 6.2 it has a light session-able very low sensing abv quality. It is STUPIDLY drinkable, I could go through this six pack I swear with joy in under an hour... but I must control myself. Just flat out amazing."
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best beers I have ever had. Most of the flavors come from hops, but somehow this is not overly hoppy. Just delicious."
"Mouthfeel: Really nice. Well carbed but not prickly. Insanely drinkable. Easy to see what all the fuzz is about. Would be a staple in my fridge if I could get it regularly."
"Only had one bottle to try, great smell of hops and citrus, nice one finger head that lasted, taste like heaven in a bottle, Had a surly furious the other day, and this one ranks just as well. can't wait to get my hands on some more of this great tasting pale ale."
""
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this bottle very much. Not the greatest beer ever, but if I had to choose one beer that I would have everyday, this would be one of my top choices."
"O - This is probably the best beer I have ever had. It deserves this incredible ranking. If I were stuck on a desert Island and had one beer to drink forever, this would be it. Period."
""
""
"O: One of the best beers I have ever had in my life. There is nothing lacking in this beer and I'm just blown away at how the hops fit perfectly."
""
"The aromatics on this beer are staggering. Simply nothing else like it. Every citrus fruit you can imagine and a bit of pineapple. Nice sticky lacing as well. Taste is phenomenal. Love this on tap, really pleased the bottle holds up just as well."
"A very light, flavorful pale ale, but without the bitterness of most IPAs. This is a really interesting beer, planted firmly between typical IPAs and typical APAs. I like it. It does the same disappearing act that Gumballhead does, where the beer simply vanishes from my mouth, leaving little trace of its passing."
""
""
""
"Goes down easy like a pale ale should. Smooth, moderately carbonated and refreshing. Lives up to the hype. I am lucky to live 45 minutes from the brewery as this is difficult to find. $8.75 per sixer at the Brewpub and twice the price at local stores when you can find it."
""
""
"Overall: There is nothing I don't love about this beer. Call me a fanboy. If put on a desert island this is my beer of choice. Not overly light as to feel like water but not so heavy as to feel weighed down. It's the perfect balance and could only dream of having this offered down the street on a regular basis."
""
""
""
"Overall this one resembles Gumballhead - I did not have side-by-side, but on different days. The bitterness and the lacking malt to support it are what make these beers good to try, but not must haves to acquire again."
""
""
"Overall. Very nice ipa. Wait, apa? Okay. Anyways, a very good beer."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy bright orange color with two fingers of off white head that recede to a nice tight white cap. As is expected tons of citra hops on the nose, really bright citrus fruits and just a touch of dankness. No real malt presence on the nose. The taste is more of the same, tons of hops all over the place with a bit of a spicy bitterness on the palate. The mouthfeel is very nice, could have easily downed a 6 pack if I had it. Overall this is a great beer but I would have liked just a touch more maltiness on the taste to balance out the hops, as it is it came off just a bit harsh. Definitely worth seeking out if you are a hop-head."
""
"Poured from bottle to pint glass the beer arrives a pale orange color, mostly clear, with a nice 2 finger white head. Good retention and lacing throughout. The nose is an explosion of Citra hops in your face. Awesome. A large citrus and tropical fruit character with a hint of pine. Couldn't possibly be better. The flavor follows suit. Terrific. It's hard to think this isn't an IPA with the hop character. Again, the Citra hops explode on your palette. Medium bitter with a large tropical fruit, mango, grapefruit, pine tone. Again, I am not sure how this could improve. The light malt base provides enough sweetness to balance this out well. Finishes with a lingering citrus on the tongue. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. I wish I could have more and more and more. Highly recommended!!"
""
"O-This is my first solo FFF offering besides a few of their collaborations. I am happy to have tried it I want this beer all the time and am jealous of everyone that can. I will trade for this whenever possible, or I could just move there. Awesome beer."

"O: Probably a new favorite pale. I even love the taste of my beer burps. Met my high expectations."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Probably the best pale ale I've had, although I feel like 3F is stretching the category a bit as its pretty much an IPA. Having a fresh bottle certainly renewed my faith in the citra hop."
""
""
""
"O: This is a stellar beer. I loved it the first time I tried it, and I still love it today. I think it actually gets way better as it warms. A great APA all the way around. Cheers to FFF."
"If you have a favorite IPA or a favorite PA, you HAVE to give this a shot, and by the way, its ok to give it 5's across the board...i think this SHOULD be the benchmark."
""
""
""
"O: It's hard to look at you and say ""You aren't perfect"". I'm not entirely sure this is what an American Pale Ale is supposed to taste like either though"
""
"This is a good, citra forward APA/IPA. Not much else to say."
""
"Verdict: Massive triumph from Three Floyds. I don’t think there is a better pale ale in the world, it has all of the flavors and aromas of a strong double IPA while having almost none of the bitterness or alcohol and remains exceptionally drinkable. This is one to stock up on whenever it gets released, which is not often enough."
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really great hop profile for an APA. The citrus flavors are nice and strong throughout and have some good complexity."
"Overall - Delicious. It's an IPA, really. Who are we kidding? It would be one of the best IPAs, too. The best pale ale by far (sorry, Peeper!)."
"Big thanks to Rutager!"
""
""
"O - It goes without saying that this is one of the finest APA (or IPA, if you want to make that argument) in all the land. Powerful citrus aromas and a great grapefruit flavor, undoubtedly from all of those citrus hops. If this were available in my area, it would unquestionably be my go-to hop-fix mid-ABV beer (a place currently reserved for Perpetual IPA and Evo Lot No.3 IPA). You don't need me to recommend it to know you shoudl drink this if you can get it."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Love it!"

"Overall: A winsome hop character for a very nice APA."
""
""
""
""
"This is easily my new favorite APA. The nose is definitely the high point for me, but it's really just all around great. Highly recommended."
"O: There's a lot to like here. It's an APA on the verge of being an IPA. Low ABV, with complex, but balanced characteristics; crisp and refreshing. A showcase for Citra hops and well-crafted ale. Well above the norm."
"Overall, what a nice surprise this was. Beers like this are why I don't need session beers.... Only 2% more ABV but busting at the seems with flavor. Another great offering from FFF! 5"
"this is why i drink beer."
""
""
""
""

"O - One of the best APAs I have ever had. Period."
"O - yeah this is a damn fine beer. i want more."
""
""
""
"O: To have this amount of flavor and complexity in a standard APA/IPA is really outstanding. Would I trade my cellar for this stuff? Absolutely not. However, I would never turn one down. This is a great beer."
""
""
"o - this is one of those few beers that disappears from the glass. delicious and very, very drinkable. FFF might have just redefined the style here. get it if you can."
""
"O- An awesome beer, easily the best pale ale I've had, super drinkable, this is a hop head's perfect beer."
"O: This is the best pale ale I've ever had."
"O: Really nice and drinkable...enjoyable, and refreshing. Probably not my absolute favorite for an APA but right up there. Definitely a good Pale Ale, thanks Aaron!"
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger off white head with nice retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some decent lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge mango, pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, light pine, floral, herbal spiciness, and apricot. Fantastic aromas here as expected from one of my favorite hops. Taste of big pine, pineapple, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, and herbal spiciness. Nice amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, herbal, and tropical fruit for a bit. Great malt balance makes this extremely drinkable. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice slightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed at all in the taste or finish. Overall this is an mind blowing pale ale. Tons of great hop flavor and balance. You would think this was an IPA."
""
""
""
"O: Really enjoying the heck out of this beer. Intense aroma and taste, but easily drinkable. If I had more than this one bottle, I'd happily pop open another."
""
"O: It's definitely a good APA and for the price, I wouldnt disagree that it's the best in class. However I was hoping for a little more flavor-wise. Coming off KBS day perhaps my pallate has gotten a little spoiled. I'll come back to this review over the next four bottles I have."
""
""
"Overall this is the finest APA on the planet. No gripes here."
""
"O - the smell didn't win me over all that much, smelled like a standard ipa, and then i tasted the delightfulness that is zombie dust! this is a perfect beer for hot days like today. great flavor, great mouthfeel."
"Pours a ruddy orange with a dense white head. The smell is sharp and tangy, with a lot of meyer lemon notes as well as something herbal, and something a little bready as well. The taste is again heavy on the citrus tang, with a sturdy malt backbone to keep things balanced. It's highly carbonated but very smooth. A very nice beer, one I'm glad to have tried."
"Totally blown away by this beer. Fantastic clarity with a golden orange glow. Outstanding balance of sweetness and dryness, with a pungent and puckering grapefruit hops kick that is assertive yet not overpowering. Some malt sweetness creeps in toward the finish, very clean. Drinks much, much bigger than 6.2 abv. This ranks in my top favorite beers."
""
""
"Poured cool into a pint glass the appearance is a yellow-brown color, clear with a healthy white cover that settles to a stubborn thin blanket. Lacing is equally stalwart. The bouquet of citrus hops is instantly delivered upon opening the bottle. Floral biscuit, near cherry blossoms over delicate grain. Very nice and such a pleasure when risking the often too tame genre of pale ales. The flavor brings an interesting combination of floral grain with a grassy finish. After the tongue has a couple moments to contemplate this, you get more of the citrus back and it ultimately presents a fine, sweet but reasonably balanced hop refreshment. Body is medium-light with a near slick feel and fairly delicate carbonation that crescendos to a mild froth in your mouth. Very drinkable and a fine entry for the pale ale world! I knew there was a reason I was determined to bring home some Three Floyds with me from Chicago last week!"
""
""
""
"A great beer, but voraciously overhyped."
"Overall: Doesn't hurt that I picked up this bottle at the brewpub today so it is super fresh; just about the best thing I have ever tasted that has emerged from a fermenter"

"O - A beautiful pale ale that is for sure and I wish that all my beers this summer would taste the same."
""

""
""

"Overall an excellent beer. Hops are very aromatic but not overwhelming in the taste. Very well balanced and easy to drink."

"Overall; WOW. An outstanding pale (PALE?!?!) ale that I would definitely stack up against any standard IPA, and quite a few DIPA's. There really isn't anything pale about this brew. Bravo FFF, this beer is incredible, drinkable every day without getting boring, but awesome enough to be a special occasion brew. I will absolutely seek this beer out again, and highly recommend that you do as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very special beer."
"This is easily the best example of an American Pale Ale I have ever had. It could easily hold its own against some outstanding IPAs as well. It is hoppy and complex enough for a seasoned craft beer drinker (which I still aspire to be), yet easy-drinking and accessible enough for a more casual drinker. I think it's a nearly perfect APA and an absolute masterpiece of a beer. I wish we could buy it here."
"It's not going to be one of my favourites as I'm much more of a fan of malts than hops but it's a really good beer."
""
""
""
"O- This really is remarkable. It never ceases to amaze me the limits brewers will push. I've been assaulted by citra yet my palate is fried for the night."
"M - Medium body; slightly creamy. Light to moderate carbonation."
"Resiny palate through and through. This citric flavor bomb is very easy to drink and worth drinking a few at a time, but not too many for me. My palate would be overwhelmed with citrus for weeks."
""
"An intense hop experience. It is good, but not great as expectations led me to believe. I like my pale ales just a little more balanced than this. But it sure was fun to try!"
""
""
"Overall? Wow. If I have a better beer in 2012 then I will be a lucky man. This is the pinnacle of the pale ale style for me. I'd rather drink this than ANY India Pale Ale. The only hoppy beer that I would reach for before this (that I've had), honestly, is Pliny the Elder. Zombie Dust absolutely brings IIPA flavor into the best malt package possible _for my palate._ This is a dream beer."
""
"Easily one of the best (if not the best) pale ales out there. Wish I could drink this every day."
"Pours a clear honey orange with a 2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is fantastic with huge tropical fruit, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is also very tropical and citrus fruit forward with a citrus zest finish. The bitterness on the palate is fairly mild and sticks around but that's not a bad thing at all. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a very bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is simply a fantastic beer that beautifully displays the Citra hops in aroma and flavor. I am very happy that I finally got to try this one. This is one of the few beers that I would consider buying again and again if it was distributed near me."
""
""
"O - This is the best APA/IPA I've ever had. I've had better DIPAs, and I really don't like to give out perfect 5s, which is why this is staying below that level. For the style, which is very key here, it is mindblowing. To get a better hop forward beer than this in my opinion, you'd need to have a top notch DIPA like Heady Topper, PtE, or another FFF brew Dreadnaught. It's really some spectacular stuff. I really wasn't expecting an APA to be this great, but I'm so glad I had the opportunity to receive this in a trade. It's too bad I only have a few left, because I'd drink this all the time. Gets a 5 overall because I think, for the style, this is as good as it gets."
"Received a bottle in trade from DaBubs and one from dwbrews, thanks guys! Bright orange color, a little lace. This had a, not bad a very hoppy smell like fruit, smelled good. Flavor was more hops, fuzzy peaches actually. This was a good beer and I wouldn't say it was an IPA but I would say it was very one dimensional and so I probably wouldn't revisit it. Still, I was very glad to have had the opportunity to drink this."
"For an APA, this is a good beer. On the other hand, it amazes me the way this beer is impossible for many people to find. As far as being an APA, there is nothing particularly unique or special. It is a little above average."
""
"I like Dales Pale Ale an Daisy Cutter but this one just has an extra edge of hop aroma and flavor and complex flavor to make it unique in this style."
""
"Overall an excellant example of the style and one I'm happy to review. My first experience with this beer was with Heady topper and Abner so my tastebuds were fried and didn't give it a fair shake. If you dig citra hops, than this ones for you. Definitely one of my favorite APA's to date. Nice job!"
"O) This was really frick'n good. I could drink this anytime, but I'd love to have a nice stash of it for the summer. Cheers...."
"If this were available to me year-round, I'd always have some on hand."
"O- One of the best beers I have ever had, it is incredibly drinkable. If you can get your hands on it, you will not be disappointed"
""
"Three Floyds only produces a limited amount and the supply frequently gets exhausted so if you see it, buy it! It gets sold out all the time for good reason. Best beer ever!"

"The best pale ale I've ever had. Arguabley will ever have."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall this beer is very nice. this style seems to fall by the wayside these days as IPA is quite similar to APA and also seems quite fashionable. this APA as well as the Floyd's flagship brew are both spectacular examples of how uniquely the style can be expressed to show contrast to the IPA and in quite delicious fashion. glad i had a chance to dance with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - This is what an APA should taste like; smooth malt flavor and heavy citrus hop overtones; what more could you ask for"
"Overall, this is a very easy to drink beer with great full flavors and aroma profile. While a pale ale it is not because in my opinion a pale ale shouldn't be over 6% ABV, it is a great IPA or just a great beer in general. Dangerously drinkable and full flavored. Glad I was able to track down a 6-pack for myself. Do I need to have it again, no. Do I hope I have the chance, yes of course. Definitely recommended though."
""
"O: One of the better Pale Ales I've had but not the best. I'd like to try it fresh on tap before giving final judgement though as the aromas and flavors seem to indicate the possibility of greatness."

"Pours a nice orange color in my tulip glass with an off white head. Good lacing on my glass. The nose has a very nice citrus vibe to it, along with caramel malt. Amazing taste to this brew- Hops, pine, w/ a nice malt backbone. Really incredible flavor for a pale ale. Feel is medium, w/ a nice hops bite. Overall, an another amazing FFF brew. Really enjoyed this one."
""
""
"Pours a yellow straw with foam which falls rather quickly to a mirror of the same. Smells like: citra, grapefruit, citrus, more citrus?...NOT AT ALL!!! This smells like band aids and onions. Wow, god awful. Then the flavor is brutalized as well. Bitter, astringent, nasty. Body is fine beyond my clinching jaw. This beer is ruined for me. WTF happened to this bottle?!"

"Overall, this is my ""stranded on an island"" beer for sure. I could drink this all day, every day. Nuff said"

"O: Was worried with the hype behind this beer I wouldn't be as impressed as others, though I was wrong, this is truly one of the best beers I have had the opportunity to have!!!"
"Sampled on tap at the 3 Floyd's pub in 3/13. This beer was every bit as good on tap, and as with the bottled version, is a beer I would order all the time if it were only available where I live."
""
""
"O: Awesome pale ale, hope to get my hands on some more"
""
"Enjoyed on tap at Hopleaf in Chicago, February 9 (looked like almost everyone in the bar was enjoying it as well!). Pours a deep amber with great head and lacing. Aroma is pine and intense citrus - grapefruit, mango, lemon are all there to overwhelm the olfactory. Taste is full of juicy fruity and piney hops, with a substantial malty backdrop. Mouthfeel is resinous and sticky with dry finish. As noted elsewhere, a beer of this description seems like it should be classified as an IPA. Whatever you call it though, it is magically delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer is a revelation. I went into this beer thinking it'd just be an IPA with an APA label on it. I was wrong. IT is very much an APA with a more hop-forward profile, but retaining not only a balance with the malt, but also a strong and flavorful malt presence overall."
"Overall: Not really sure why you can't call this one an IPA. In any case, this is one of the best self-described APAs I can remember drinking. Totally drinkable, flavorful hop profile, and thirst-quenching."

"No doubt about it, the mouth feel is big. It's sticky, viscous, and chewy. Carbonation is mild and the finish isn't as dry as many. It's considered a pale ale, but drink it fresh and you'll consider it delicious. It's nearly as ominous as it's label."
""
""
"O - Overall, this is a delicious beer. Really, really with Three Floyds would come to MA so I can drink this stuff weekly."

"Pours a chilled golden orange with a slow stream of carbonation supporting an initially thick cream head. Fades to a thin layer with extensive sheets of lacing. Aroma is green, fresh and raw. Citrus rind, grapefruit pulp, mild pine, and light caramel malt. Not quite as aromatic as some of the HF APAs, but very well balanced and nuanced. Medium thick, chewy body with moderate carbonation and a slightly wet, thin finish. Strong biscuit malt and earthy body with resiny and pulpy citrus hops buttering the finish. An exceptional, citrusy APA, but a little too much alcohol presence for the style and not quite Hoppy Birthday or Edward. Regardless, I will seek this out every time it is released."
""
"Thanks Dan! Pours a clear darker shade of gold/orange with a sparse head. Nose is juicy citrus pulp, grapefruit rind, light pine resin. Takes the really juicy hop qualities of Dreadnaught and Alpha King, dialed down a bit but still honed in. Mouth is sharply bitter throughout, super brightly hopped. Washes of grapefruit rind with some nice malt underneath. Dry and bitter, but complex with really pleasant citrus tones. Takes me back to the days when I could actually get Three Floyds IPAs. Need more of this."
""
"O: Wow, this is probably the best pale ale I've had. I was expecting something à la Sierra Nevada (which I like) but this is so much better. Very well balanced between hop and malt, very approachable and not overly bitter. Would be a great intro to craft beer as well as a special treat for the seasoned BA. Highly recommend. This is my first experience with Three Floyds and damn, I'm impressed."
"O - Fantastic APA from FFF. This one lives up to the hype and may very well leave Alpha King in the dust with this one. Great pale ale that drinks very similar to an IPA."
""
""
""
"PHENOMENAL, TREAT YOURSELF!"
""
"Not quite as good as Hoppy Birthday or Parking Violation, but this is very, very close. Exceptional, especially when this fresh. Highly recommended."
"Overall - Superb. Among the very best, if not the best, APA out there. I was wondering if someone would be able to pull off such a bold APA, but Three Floyds did. Simply delicious."
"Overall one of the best beers I've had the chance to drink. My new favorite FFF beer, taking Alpha King's spot. Reminded me of a single American IPA, but not overly hoppy. One of the best of all time!"
"Mouthfeel: Creamy, full, astringent, no alcohol heat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I enjoyed this brew but I didn't really find anything too incredibly special about it. I enjoy most of the beers this brewery puts out but all the hype I've heard about Zombie Dust just didn't live up to my expectations."

"o - top notch APA. loved it."
"o: THE American IPA. Best of class. Done. Three Floyds strength seems to be in the IPA realm and this is yet another jewel in their crown as one of the Kings of midwest IPA power."
""
""
""
"O- I f@$&ing love this beer. I wish 3 floyds was distributed on the west coast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. This is a very good beer. Tangy and sweet, not as much like a normal IPA, but still very goo. I would suggest everyone try this at least once."
""
"d - the sweet but delicate flavors combined with great smell and light mouthfeel make this one of my new favorite ipa's or pale ales; super drinkable and doesn't leave much room for improvement"
"Overall - A delicious beer that has a fantastic balance of flavours. It really drinks more like an IPA than a APA. It reminded me a bit of better made Flying Monkeys Smashbomb IPA. Worth seeking out and I'd drink it again anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - an instant favorite! It's one of those beers that give you an involuntary/uncontrollable smile with the first taste. Its flavor is super complex for the super beer geek but subtle/delicate enough to be enjoyed by any beer drinker. I wish it was more readily available, because i would buy a keg. This beer leaves all others APA's in its dust..Dust, get it?"
"Its actually very balanced. A sticky honey malt is highlighted by a good bit of fruity hops. Grapefruit, lemon zest, and nice touch of orange peel. A nice bittering presence is actually a lot less than the nose leads you to believe, but thats actually a very good thing. Slightly metallic. Sits very light and all the flavors fade away leaving the hints of bitter and metal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-going according to style I find it to be much more hop centered than an APA but as an IPA I would rate higher"
""
""
"Overall: A very tasty pale ale. Well balanced, fairly complex. The citrus/hop notes are very fresh. Very high drinkability."
""
""
"O - Superb. No other way to describe it. A sublime example of citra hops that doesnt overpower the beer. Highly recommended, and and I wish I had access to this beer year round. Phenomenal."

"O- Now I see what all the hype's about. One of my new Top 5 IPAs for sure. Definitely cannot improve anymore."

"Overall, this is one of my favorite releases over the past several years. Lives up to the hype and beyond. Most highly recommend. Not avail here in TX so got from ummagum - many thanks! Rotation - if available near me it would be a constant presence in my fridge and probably would get a keg if available. [H;Y]"
"Mouthfeel is great. Easy drinking. I really wish this was distributed. Overall, this is simply outstanding. Believe the hype. This is a damn good beer."
""
""
"New to the review thing so this won't be overwrought. Thanks to tsauce2 for the extra thrown in with a trade. Possibly the best pale ale I've ever had. Citra hops... very fruity nose and taste with almost no hop bitterness. Lovely fruity hop flavor. Didn't even know how much of a gem this one is until the first scent of the aroma. Phenomenal!"
""
""
"Overall a great APA from a World Class Brewery!"
""
"Cheers!"
"O- Overall this is a good beer. Lots of grapefruit and hops with little accompaning bitterness and a suprisingly dry finish. Very happy I tried this beer."
""
"Overall: Great beer, I would drink this throughout summer if I lived near FFF. One thing though; why do FFF bottle their huge IPA's like Apocalypse Cow in bombers and their refreshing pale ale in a 355ml?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Yup, hype is on point. Tons of flavor, but nothing overbearing. Surprisingly balanced and incredibly drinkable. Also, Citra single-hop has to be once of the best ideas on the market. Bonus points."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an outstanding beer"
"overall- a great example of an IPA with a little extra kick of pepper or something. i will have to get some more to try to pin point the unigue taste of this beer that seperates it from the rest."
""
""
""
"Overall, a phenomenal display of what a pale ale can be like with the citra hop, a softer touch to it than the SN Torpedo citra or Kern river, much less in the malt department to let it stand out, it just has a more flowery and delicate aura to it here. Big points for keeping the bitterness down and the hop mouthfeel very high."
"Poured into a nonic pint glass, an apricot golden orange hue with a bright chunky head just barely off white in color. Fine even lacing lines the sides of the glass as the head dwindles down. Aroma has a super citrus grapefruit nose, hints of crushed aspirin, tropical fruit with a underlying biscuit malt character. Flavor is crazy with Citra hops bringing out tropical fruit marmalade it's pretty awesome, nothing else like this creates the same flavor. Bitter citrus peel, pineapple notes, and a mellow biscuit malt sweetness matches the bitterness. I keep getting a really green peppermint tone in both the nose and the flavor, crazy but it works with the beers flavor. The palate is coated with hop oils ample carbonation rolls everything perfectly across with each sip. Overall a classic pale ale that could be most breweries, IPA really unleashes the perfect wave of Citra hops equating into a easy drinking pale ale that we all wish was more readily available. Thanks to the great trader, Ryan aka Schlais, out of Minnesota for this early Christmas gift."
"Golden yellow, solid white head. Lots of tropical fruit. Very fragrant. Flavor is similar to the nose. Pineapple, mango, grapefruit. Carbonation is smooth. Solid easy drinking American pale. I had no problem putting away several pints."
""
"More like an IPA than an APA, this is right up there with Dreadnaught in my favorite FFF beers."
"Good beer but heavy in the grapefruit department. Poured with a huge foamy, frothy, off white head that lasted a while and lots of lace. Color is a slightly hazy amber. Aroma is hop, malt, fresh cut grass, wet grain. caramel. Flavor's the same along with carbonic tang that accents the hop. Finish is like flavor, has lots of length, and is satisfying. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a two finger head, nice lacing, good looking beer. Aroma of citra hops, citrus fruits especially grapefruit. Taste follows nose malts present to back up hop bitterness but still allow the hops to shine. Smooth and easy to drink with little alcohol presence."
""
"Pours a clear reddish copper color with a fluffy whitish 1 1/4 finger head. The smell is amazing!! Nice floral hoppy smell that's very clean. I smell a slight grape in the background, very nice. Very nice mouth feel with some bitterness on the back end, but not overwhelming. Overall this is a great beer that would love to have in my fridge at all times!"
"O: Hard to describe this one. It's not a super hoppy DIPA or a big roasty RIS. It's just right. It has to be the most drinkable beer I've had. Just smooth, clean with some nice citrus and enough malt backbone to balance it out. I thought Alpha King was the best APA I've ever had but I think FFF has broken their own highwater mark."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This would be a staple in my fridge were it readily available. Just an outstanding APA from start to finish. So packed with flavor at a relatively low 6.2%. The interplay between sweet citrus and bitter resin plays out very nicely. Just fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome beer. All I can really say is if you get the chance to try this you really should. It is probably the best pale ale out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I prefer this to a SN Pale Ale as my favorite. The only drawback is it is not as widely available as the SN. I highly recommend seeking this out."
""
""
"O - Very nice, hoppy beer, more like an IPA, delicious though."
""
"overall: this one lived up to the hype. its nice to have a rare, top 50 beer that's reasonably priced too. very glad i got to try this, and thanks again to kalvarez for the trade! will be happily drinking this over the next 2 weeks!!"
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with a huge fluffy white head that displays great retention and lacing. Smells of citrus, pine and resin mostly with hints of green onion and garlic. If there is malt in here I can't find it. Taste is citrus, pine, resin, and green onion with maybe some bits of bready malt if I squint a bit. Long lingering onion hop bite in the finish. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation with a sharp resinous mouthfeel. I'm glad I got the opportunity to try this brew, but to call this a pale ale is quite a stretch, we could safely call this an IPA. That being said, this is a great IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of the top APAs I've had. It walks the line between an APA and an IPA very well. And for as wonderfully hoppy as it smells and tastes, I don't know that it can be beat. Good reason why it's the number 1 rated APA at the moment. Had again recently and I had to up my score from 4.0 to 4.5. It's just that damn good. Though I think I prefer Alpha King just slightly to ZD, it's still wonderful."
""
""
""
"O-Zombie Dust is an awesome beer. Great art, good price and tastes nice. It is probably one of the best pale ales out there but I found the bitterness to be overly accentuated."
"Just as good on tap, 5 months later at the Maproom."
""
""
""
"Is this really a pale ale? Well... I'm blown away. I initially reviewed this assuming that it was an IPA and the hop profile certainly reflects that. This is by far the hoppiest pale ale I've ever had and I'm sure it would be bombastic on tap. A must try."
""
"O- Very good beer to drink. I wish I could pick up a six pack of this anytime. The one bottle left me wanting more. Hope they start making more and distribute it. Thanks Evan for the beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really would like to try this one on tap or from a growler. Perhaps when I visit Chicago in a few days I'll get my chance. Nearly flawless!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is much more hopped than I would expect an APA to be (I think this is more aptly labled an IPA). Regardless of how it's labeled, however, this is a damn fine beer that deserves recognition. Make any and all efforts to acquire this one if you enjoy hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Despite the pathetic excuse for a head, this is a pretty solid brew. Definitely not a huge fan of citra hops, but the malt base was strong enough to keep the soapy notes that citra hops are so well known for in check. Obviously not worth all the exaggerated press it gets on here, but one to check out if you get the chance. Would drink again. Definitely worth the 3F Zomer I traded for it. Thanks again Claaark13!"
"O - Hands down the best Pale Ales I've ever had, I could go through cases of this stuff. Amazing!"
"Overall a world class pale ale that brings any hop lover to tears! Amazing."
"O: Interesting. The aroma is very enticing but the citrus hop flavor just isn't strong enough for me. The bitterness is there, but I was hoping to taste those delicious citrus hop aromas I smelled. This is a solid APA for sure, but it's not world class IMO."

"Just got this in a trade! Thanks whitemomba! The second I popped the cap on this beer, my nostrils got hit with a huge whiff of hops. Pours a slightly-hazy, golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very heavy with the Citra hops. Lovely citra aroma with a bit of pine and somewhat earthy notes. Taste just has so much hoppy goodness going on, it's ridiculous. I haven't had Alpha King in a long time, but I remember thinking the same thing: ""How do they get such intense hop profile into a pale ale?"" Great citra hop flavors with lovely citrus fruit and just the slightest hint of malt. Not sure if this is a fresh hop ale, but it sure tastes like one. An all-citra fresh hop ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, somewhat resiny, with a crisp finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a fantastic pale ale. I would love to do a side by side with Alpha King and Daisy Cutter to see who gets crowned supreme pale ale."
""
""
""
""
"O- A delicious take on the style that drinks really well. Flavorful and unique. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Simply Amazing!"
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is has a great mouthfeel for an American Pale Ale. The body is refreshing and easy-drinking without being sticky or coating. The carbonation is only barely noticeable and is probably doing more in the background than I can give it credit for."
""
""
"Great pale ale that seems more along the lines of a IPA."
""
""
"This is probably the best APA I've tasted. The Citra hops are certainly the dominant player and it works really well. Excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Without a doubt the best APA I have ever had. Another thumbs up for 3 FFF."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this and Dreadnaught and Bourbon/Vanilla Bean Dark lord could be the only 3 beers I take to a desert island and I'd be just fine. I just love FFF, I may be biased as they got me into craft beer, but they just know how to make beer. Right on."
""
""
""
"O: very good and true to style. Malts and hops are blended very well together and provide for an easy to drink beer with a lot of hops."
"o - probably the best pale ale i've ever had. definitely errs on the side of IPA but truly fantastic. i expected this to lose some of it's pizazz as i'm not sure how old this one was, at least a couple months, but it didn't. truly fantastic"
""
"12 oz. bottle poured into a New Belgium glass. A moderately aggressive pour yielded a dark, golden brew with a 2-inch white head which lasted. Lacing was spotty but lasted throughout. The nose was the resinous and the lemony, hop-centered smell you would expect from the citra. The taste was dry, lemon, orange and mango, grassiness, pine but there were tones of some nice malt notes and grain as well. I loved the healthy carbonation and some nice bitterness at the back end. The mouthfeel was medium to light. What a wonderful surprise this beer was. I just wish I could get more!"
""
""
""
""
"O-- I consider myself lucky to have some good APA's in this part of the world with LC and Stone and Wood Pacific Ale, but this beer blows the heck out of anything I have had in a long time. My bar has been Daisy Cutter and LC but this was mind numbing. Well balanced and put together. More taunting was the logo just staring at me and taunting me with those eyes. All this from a single hop APA?? Sick, just sick."
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent example of an aromatous pale ale which stays true to the pale ale genre in the taste."
"D - very nice, it has the aroma of a full blown ipa, but the flavor profile is subtle and balanced as a pale ale should be."
""
""
""
"Hands down the best beer i have had this year. Amazing! First beer of the tasting and we were proclaiming this as beer of the night and beer of the year all in one."
""
""
"Hard as it is to believe that there might be a better pale ale than Alpha King on the market, let alone one from the same brewery, Zombie Dust delivers against all the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Update 2 - I'm not sure if this was me or FFF, but over the past year or so I've not really been happy with ZD. And I've had it a lot. The taste really went downhill, so I need to dock this a few points for inconsistency."
""
""
""
"shout out to RC0032 for some of these, first off the label art is sic! 12oz bottle poured into a very elequent and ravishing....pint glass, shows a trasparent active orange topped off with a soapy 1 inch head, my friends head looked much better than mine....anyway, immediately a rush of sweet fruits and hop greatness in the nose, pineapples, oranges, mango sweetness. CITRUS SON! fresh hops come through and are very pungent. pale biscut malt intertwined, the taste follows the nose of amazing citrus filled beer, fruity and limp wristed, oily hop feel leaves a fresh tracked bitterness. medium bodied on the palate smooth and not very prickly for the style. overall 3 floyds has been a rollercoaster ride for expectations and this one was on point. i love the citrus involved and complexity it brings to compliment the bitterness. well done 3 floyds, all the talk is justified in my eyes. this one sets itself apart from the field in APA's."
""
""
"O: Really a great beer. The worst part about this beer is I finished it way too quick and I want more and I cannot get it! Would love to try this one again!"
"O - This is a really great APA. Thanks to madarab55 for sharing this one."
""
""
""
"O: An absolutely wonderful beer. Heather and I were lucky enough to have tried this back in the Cenotaph days and have had it as Zombie Dust on draft and out of the bottle. Finally got around to reviewing it. This would totally be our ""go to"" if it wasn't so difficult to find right now."
"Overall, I wanted this beer to not be good with all of the hype. This beer is like the Yankees or the Lakers. You want to hate them but all they do is win... Just like zombie dust. Amazing, simply amazing."
""
"an awesome beer, all around. citra hop, my new personal favorite thanks to this beer. it just seems to have every kind of hop flavor. ""juicy"" being the key word i like to use to describe this hop. definatly super sessionable, any hop head could easily down 6 packs of this."
"Pours a dark gold color with white as snow foamy head. It has a wonderful hoppy nose with some citrus. Mouthfeel is not overly remarkable, being the APA that it is. Taste is just a party in your mouth with citrus, hops, sweet and some kind of NW woods kinda thing. Finish lingers with sweet, which would make this a perfect beer to pair with anything from BBQ to fish. Super great APA, this coming from a kid who grew up in STL and cut his teeth on AB beers....(arent they all the exact same with some food coloring???)"
""
""
""
""
"D - really solid APA. They weren't stringy on the hops with this one as the citra really shines in this beer. Definitely worth a shot if you can track some down!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is the real deal. I gave it a 5 on smell, and that can't be emphasized enough. The citra hop smell from this beer makes me want to grow citra hops. The taste is right up there as well. A very solid pale ale from three floyds and has probably surpassed Alpha King for me, which is no small feat. It wasn't quite as good from the bottle, which was definitely more carbonated, but what beer isn't better from the tap?"
""
""
""
""
"O: My first FFF beer, honestly I’d drink this all day, nothing really standoutish about it but its so easy drinking and has enough flavor that I wish I could buy this by the case."
""
""
""
""
""
"As a hop vessel, this beer is all 5s. I'd love a nice, flavorful malt backbone (as exemplified in fresh NEBCO Gold Stock Ale) to push it over the top, but as is I'm pretty in love with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Murky looking damp pale amber with some orange tone. Half a finger of head, sticky lacing in my tulip. Aroma is plentiful citrus, tropical fruits, and some passion fruit. Just an amazing scent. The beer has a great pale base but man does the hop flavor pop. Crisp and citrus like hop flavor that carries through the beer. Tropical fruit flavors, mango, pinapple, passion fruit. The massive hop presence creates just a hint of cloyingness. Typical pale mouthfeel, medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. This really is one of the top pales I've had."
""
""
"I drank this bottle while watching one of the penultimate episodes of the most recent season of Breaking Bad. Suffice it to say, Zombie Dust is becoming my Blue Sky. I want to drink this on tap and from growlers. I'm not sure I could ask for more, taste-wise, from an APA."
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall another winner here. Very tasty,light and drinkable. Great single hop APA. Citra hops are amazing. I would definately recommend."
""
""
""
""
"D: Would make a great lawnmower beer if you're in the mood for a little assertive hop character to go along with that refreshing, spritzy quality."
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer. I did not think that 3F possessed the restraint to so delicately craft a beer like this. Truely an APA, but this is not suggested by the nose. Big hops, but when you drink this beer is balanced and mellow, yet still hoppy. Well done."
"Can't wait for this beer to gravitate to the central part of our state. Three floyds has a magical hop garden that is unmatched."
"This beer is ridiculous. It pours a light to medium bodied auburn in color with a slight white lacing around the snifter. The aromas are other worldly. The citra hops are both insane and perfect. This beer is so ridiculously aromatic that it haunts your dreams. The flavor too, citra overload with some orange zest, light pine, slight caramel malt, with a touch of alcohol. It's exceptional. The detection of alcohol is the only knock I have on this beer. This beer should be knighted, nominated for saint hood. It drinks light in body and is both kickass and sessionable at the same time. I drank two beers multiple times at Dark Lord Day, Pliny and Zombie Dust. I had four of these at Darkness Day. I drank six of these throughout the day at the FFF Anniversary party. This beer is just ridiculously awesome, I can't get enough. Three Floyds masters pale ales like no other."

"Dry finish. Really full and enjoyable beer. I could drink quite a few of these."

"Overall: I cannot say enough about what a great beer this is. I look forward to try it in the bottle. I can pretty confidently say that not only is this the best pale ale I have had but probably my new favorite beer in the ipa/pale ale category that Three Floyds produces. I used to think Daisy Cutter was the best pale ale out there but this one beats it and beats it solidly. It helps that my favorite hop being Citra is used in this one. I couldn't get enough of this beer when i was at the party and look forward to getting as much as people will trade me. If anyone reads this and wants to do a trade hit me up and I will definitely make it worth your while."

"Overall I really enjoyed this, but am over it. I have heard such great things about this APA, that maybe it coming from FFF I was expecting an IPA profile like Alpha King. Maybe I'm being way too hard on FFF, because I expected that. Rambling I may be, the point is. This is a fantastic beer. If you hold FFF to an ultra high standard, like I do, then you will be a bit disappointed. With this being said I am happy. Thanks to TIMMYJ21 for this extra."
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to Janderson91 for this one!"
""
""

"Pours a clear deep golden orange with a light tan head and some large bubbles sitting on top. The nose has a light grain profile, a touch of doughy malt, citric bite and notes of mango. The flavor follows the same path but a bit fruitier and more integrated. The grain and dough malt balance pretty nicely on the assertive fruity hop flavors of citrus and other tropical fruits. The bitterness is assertive but not overpowering on medium body with a clean semi dry finish. Another solid hoppy offering from FFF, if only they could get sugars eaten in their stouts."

"O: This stuff deserves the hype. Great beer!"
"O: This was my first try of a FFF offering and I am thouroughly impressed. I think I just found my favorite APA. A must try beer."
"12 oz. bottle from Woodchopper. pours a honey gold with a one finger head, fades to spotty lace. the nose on this one is off the charts, full of orange, mango and apricot. taste is sweet caramel malt with a nice balance of lingering yet mild bitterness. very nice and I’d love to sit down and have 2 or 3 of these, but if I had to choose between this and Alpha King, I’d go with with the King."
"O - A great ""Pale ale"". Drinks much more like an IPA, minus the honey."
"O - This is quite good overall. I think it is a bit heavy overall and (can't believe I'm saying this) maybe a bit over-saturated on the hop flavors - probably just a particular aspect which I associate with armpits. Glad to try this one - don't think it's really an APA...it's a good IPA for me, worth seeking out, but definitely not my favorite either."
"-this is very good. i would even call it great in the sense that it seems like it is going to be one of those IPA's with the mislabeled PA on it based on the smell, but the flavor isn't too hop forward, just really nice and balanced"
"Overall: As a hophead, I love any version of this beer. It is even better on cask, and I am slowly realizing I might be a cask IPA fanatic."
"Overall: Sessionable great tasting hoppy brew."
"Bright golden color with a nice white head with good lacing and good duration. Aroma is very citrus hop forward kind of juicy. Grapefruit, clementine, tangerine. Very nice. Flavor is clean nice citrus hops with similar citrus notes as the aroma. Mouthfeel is ok. Could be a touch drier, and there is not enough carbonation for me. Overall its a damn good beer. Great offering by FFF."
"O: One of the best beers I've ever had regardless of style. I'm unsure if I've been so taken aback by any beers quite this much lately. Worth the accolades it gets, and then some. If this was available near me, I'd have a case tomorrow. 5/5"
"O ~ pretty tasty... Crazed because its 3FFF.. Glad I got to try one! Thanks a lot Kyle :)"
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being moderate. Overall it's a fantastic beer. I love Citra hops, so this was right up my alley. It was so juicy and bright and so drinkable at the same time. I loved it overall and only wish I could buy it more easily."
"This another beer that actually lives up to the hype. This is so ridiculously good. I would keep this in my fridge at all times if I could get more of it. Cheers to rmalinowski4 for sending me two bottles."
"Overall I'm glad I was able to attain this brew because it is not easy for me to get in PA. Great offering from FFF and I hope to be able to try it again in the future. As good or better than the other APAs out there."
"Zombie Dust is easily one of my favorite beers of the year, certainly my favorite Pale Ale. The aroma and flavor is just explosive without being overwhelming. Dangerously drinkable, there would not be an issue putting down a fair amount in a night. Flat out awesome beer."
"O/D - This is the second time I've had this beer and I still can't find the words to express how good this is. Three Floyds is dead on with this one. Yeah, I just dropped that lame pun."
"O - This is an excellent pale ale. The Citra hops aroma and taste profile are outstanding."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a nice white head and descent lacing. Intense smells of pine,citrus, grapefruit, grass. Taste is top notch with hops in the forefront and some malts. Great mouth feel and carbonation. This is really easy drinking. Amazing how great the balance is. This is the best APA i have ever had, hands down."
"O: This was a very hyped-up beer from the beginning, and it didn't disappoint. The approachable nature of Zombie Dust warrants the fanfare. It's reception, drinkability and subsequent market availability is reminiscent of its FFF comrade, Gumballhead. In fact, while I was drinking this, I felt as if I was drinking the zombie offspring of Hopslam and Gumballhead. Dangerously enjoyable–I feel like I could definitely enjoy six of these in a session."
"overall - pretty good for the style, though im not a hundred percent sure its a pa"
"O- Overall this beer is Exceptional. The aroma is a thing of beauty that fills the room and gets you excited for your first sip. Then once that first sip is taken you wondering how they made the complex smells and flavors blend into a perfect balance. This beer is great example of an American pale. Three Floyds take a bow."
"Thanks Any for the great extra. Poured into an imperial pint glass. Nice orangish color with a silky beige head, lots of lace. Incredible nose a huge bouquet of fresh hops backed by a nice bready malt profile. Taste is well balanced with a nice bitter hoppy finish. Medium body is well carbonated. Another great beer from Three Floyds."
"O: Really easy to drink and a great flavor and aroma."
"This is my absolute favorite beer. Very refreshing and a pure delight to drink. This is a balanced beer that does not disappoint. The look of the beer is golden in color with a nice white head. Smells of pine and grass. Tastes of pine and citris with subtle grapefruit. Well balanced. I could crush this beer all day. It is a nice bodied beer that has a strong hoppy finish and a nice lingering taste. Once again, this is my favorite beer... until my next favorite beer. lol. That said, Three Floyds does good work."
"O: this is definitely a solid offering. would get this regularly if i could."
"had 2 pints it was so refreshing. the uber extra pale ale. well hop and cloudy. very dry hopped and a bit nougat sweet fruit. english yeast. cloudy yellow. with a nice protein sticky head. a bit exotic and a bit power house resilient hops... mid west favorite...due to the fact that it avoids the usual core hoping of amarillo, centennial , or cascade there for differentiating it. a nice accent and unique local note but also a very solid national beer to seek out. have it on tap though. i imagine its not that gold in the bottle after about 1 month."
"I don't think I need to say anything else. Just an amazing drinkin' beer from FFF. Ton's of complexity, yet something you could just kick back with. Highly recommended."
"O- Take the best from Gumballhead and Daisy Cutter and you have Zombie Dust, the best APA I have ever had, it's RAD."
"Gold to amber APA with a full head that falls to a rounded lace in an imperial pint glass. Menu says 50 IBUs, but it packs a much bigger punch. Grassy, earthy nose that sings of hops, light fruit, and bitterness up front on top of caramel sweetness. Not a big beer, but doesn't taste light or watery at all--just not heavy. Smallish beer that showcases the hop bite for those with a zombie like craving for hops."
"Overall: Hands down the best APA I've ever had. Rarely do I give out a 5.0 score, but this one deserves it. Try it and you'll agree with me."
"Overall holy shit, I didn't think an APA could taste so awesome! So much fresh tropical fruit and awesome hops, like all the best parts of the hops got together and replicated until they couldn't anymore, and this is the byproduct. Bravo 3F, Bravo!"
"Medium bodied with a light bit of carbonation, the mouthfeel is slick and quite nice. In the time it took me to type this, I now only have a couple of ounces left in my glass. Damn, this is good."
"Overall no surprise.. another great beer from 3Floyds and certainly one of the best APA's I've had. I would definitely seek this one out but would need restraint it's very very drinkable."
"Drink- Just a very good beer. Three Floyds makes some great beer. DL excluded. I think I am biased being in So. Cal with BT. Anyway. Kevin! Thank you sir. Amazing beer. Super tasty, fresh and vibrant."
"O: Very aromatic and flavorful brew that is very enjoyable and worth repeating."
"D/O: A refreshing beer with high drinkability. Wide appeal on this one -- it's a fantastic introduction to the world of craft brewing for your non-beer-geek friends. Can't wait for the day when FFF starts shipping to NYC!"
"O - I'm going to say that this is the best APA I've ever had."
"Cheers."
"Dark Lord bless Three Floyds. Sometimes their schtick of huge, malt forward beer doesn't really work for me, but this thing... is... great. Is this the best American Pale Ale? Too soon to say, surely, but Zombie Dust makes a compelling case. Ugh, what am I going to do with my remaining one?"
"If only every APA could be this good. This is phenomenal. Well done FFF."
"Overall: Really good beer with high drinkability glad I got to try this one."
"FFF doing what they do best making great ale's. This is now one of my go to beers."
"I'm so freaking glad I picked this up during a visit to Three Floyds. They better keep this one on their roster as a permanent deal. Seek it out!!!"
"Overall..the best pale ale around."
"O- This is an awesome pale ale. The proportion of the flavors is amazing. It goes down so smoothly that I could see drinking a six pack with no problem."
"Pours a slightly hazy deep orange color with a huge frothy head that lingers. Smell is full of grapefruit. Some pine aromas as well as hops are also present. A truly great smelling beer. Taste is spot on. Nice sweetness with fruits and a bitter backbone. I could drink so many of these. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall, I loved this."
"I would buy this every day if available around me. I suppose could use a bit more carbonation for the abv, but a great brew."
"This is one of those beers that makes you say silly things like ""I'd trade for this beer just so I could dump it on my head."""
"The perfect beer for an afternoon spent watching football. I could session these things all day. I'm really glad I liked this one so much too, since a lot of FFF brews have been letting me down lately."
"Great APA. Perhaps my favorite. Will try to find in bottle."
"Overall it is exceptional. The best Pale Ale I've ever had. Everything in great harmony and balance. Very easy to drink/crave."
"O: Wow, an overall great beer, that was well worth the drive. Kudos to my friend Kevin who suggested the detour. I can't wait to get my hands on this wonderful APA again."
"This is a very good beer. It pours nicely, a cloudy orange color with a very fluffy head. It smells floral and strong. This brew has an interesting taste. It is more like an IPA (those looking for a more mellow APA should stay away), but it is quite complex. The flavors accentuate flowers and grapefruit at first, and then finish with a strong IPA-like bitterness. It is a nice balance. The mouthfeel is also very unique. It is almost creamy, like warm milk with slight carbonation, and it somehow works pretty well. A nice job on this one."
"O: This is a fantastic beer, and probably the best IPA I've ever tried. Yes I know it's technically an APA, but semantics be damned, this tastes like one hell of a delicious IPA. If you see a fresh one, buy it immediately!"
"If you can try this beer within 1 week of bottling you will not regret the effort."
"Extremely full flavors, excellent balance, and very easy-drinking. Wish I could get it more often!"
"Overall this is the best pale ale I've ever had and probably one of the best beers I've ever had. I wish this had distro in Washington so much."
"This is from the serving type: bottle"
"Hopefully it starts hitting the market in force although I bet this one fades very quickly. Amazing pale ale!"
"O - I'll definitely be seeking this one out again, it's crazy good. Really like the low ABV as I can see myself kicking back quite a few of these. A very nice APA."
"The taste has just the right amount of everything. It's hoppy enough to let you know care went into the hop profile yet sweet and slightly earthy at the same time. The citrus from the nose doesn't betray the palate. I wouldn't call it rich but rather drinkable. I could certainly make a six pack enjoyably last through a full sunday of football. I haven't had many APAs and maybe this is setting the bar high but the balance is exactly what I wish I found in more IPAs."
" L-let this be a lesson to all you kids out there: if you're gonna review a beer, do it right. The first few times I had this I thought it was real good, but I was in no state to pass final judgment."
"I am looking forward to trying this on a different occasion with a clean palate. I would pick up Daisy Cutter before this if they were side by side but this is FFF, so its worth a grab as well."
"O: Great pale ale.  Chalk up another great ale for FFF."
"-Cheers"
"Overall - damn near perfect APA, I wish the ABV was slightly lower but otherwise the flavors are near perfect."
"had it again tonight, must be super fresh, I would give it a 5 on smell taste and overall. damn fine beer."
"overall, a very nice brew by three floyds. If it was more available to me, I would probably drink a heck of a lot more of it."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Between light and medium bodied, with nice fine carbonation. A bit fuller than many pale ales out there. Overall, the best example of this style I've tried. Really reminds me somewhat of Gumballhead as far as hop character, but unlike that beer, this has a nice malted barley presence to balance that wheat doesn't provide. Very impressed."
"Overall another awesome effort from Three Floyds, what did you expect?"
"Thanks to immobilisme for the bottle."
"D - Very nice APA, strong flavors but not over powering."
"Nicely carbonated, medium body, sweet, hop lingering aftertaste. Love the relatively low ABV which allows for a few more ""tastings"". Really can't overstate this fact, as to me, having a ""session"" IPA/APA of this caliber shows the artistry of the brewers and their ability to create such a fine brew and not need to jack up the alcohol. Giving additional weight to the above facts tips this brew into the rarified air of Exceptional."
"O - Very good brew. The Citra hops really shine. Good FFF brew."
"Oh, and the label is pure badass."
"Really good. Not a Daisy Cutter classic, but very very good."
"Taste is citrus and sweet tropical fruit, very fresh and sweet with a lot of smooth sweet flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich with a nice crisp finish, really good."
"O- I really enjoyed this. The nose combined with the citrus and hemp flavors are remeniscent of a good IPA. The nice biscuity malt bill smooths things out, and the creamy feel make this a refreshing, insanely drinkable brew. I'd have this regularly if it was available in Cali. Recommended."
"Poured into a pint glass, great golden color. The aroma showed citrus/grapefruit and the taste was a light malty background and fantastic hoppy taste. Easily one of the better 'pale ales' I've had as I'm a sucker for hops. Would love to see more pales go towards this style."
"Overall Impression- Simply fantastic! This was tough to compare to Alpha King but have to say I enjoy this one more (from memory). Will be looking back @ my Alpha King review and seeing how it compares. This one definitely had some malt aroma/flavor that helped balance out the taste and make more characteristics happen. Will be getting this one again, and hopefully in a 6-pack or more!"
"O: 4"
"O: Very tasty and extremely drinkable. Outstanding."
"Overall, this was a great APA. Very drinkble and very fresh. I opened this up and knew I would enjoy it. This stuff is legit. Get some of this now."
"Thanks to rjhami for the reminder to stop in Munster to pick up this excellent example of a pale ale."
"Overall-Great citrus nose one of the best smelling beers I have had the pleasure to taste and the taste lives up to the smell. Great Beer!"
"O - A pretty awesome APA, if not one of the best. Definitely worth seeking out and nothing bad to say about it."
"$5 a pint iirc"
"O - I never even had a desire to try this even though I saw thread after thread ISO it, but now that I have, I'm completely blown away!"
"Overall this was a great beer that went down real easy for me. The massive hop flavors and aroma may indicate that this beer could be classified as an IPA, but who really cares what the style is because it was delicious. Thanks to my friend Justin for hooking me up with some kick ass Three Floyds straight from the brewery. I highly recommend this beer and will be seeking it out again as it was ridiculously smooth and outstanding overall. An absolute session beer for me that I could drink anytime and all the time."
"O- This is one of if not the best APA I’ve ever had, it’s more like an IPA, really fruity and hoppy, balanced and extremely easy drinking, this would be perfect for a hot summer day. Really impressed."
"Light body with a crisp and refreshing carbonation that's perfect for the style. While not quite a light ABV beer, I wouldn't mind having a few of these. Very nice beer."
"O- If you could breed gumballhead and apocalypse cow this would be the offspring."
"Bravo, Three Floyds, Bravo!"
"O - I've been a little hard on FFF in the past -- their DIPAs just haven't really done it for me -- but this beer is the real deal. They've managed to pack a lot of the aspects that I enjoy in an IPA/DIPA into an APA. I love it, and I'll be trading for as much as I can manage in the future."
"O- This beer is outstanding and one of the best I have ever had. This beer tastes and smells like a tropical hop paradise. Kudos to Three Floyds, this is the first beer I have had from them and now I am so glad they are back in Ohio."
"To be fair I do not care for really hoppy beers. If you want a real craft beer from FFF try Ragnarok. Not bad, but just too much hops to malt ratio for my taste buds. Seems after 1-2 years it will age like fine wine. If you like hops offer me a trade!"
"This is a tremendous beer. Hop head will love it. The hops are on parade in ways the are both bold and subtile. Three Floyds is not available in my area. I will be looking for more excuses for road trips!"
"O - An exceptional beer. It would be very easy to sit back and enjoy several of these over the course of an evening. I definitely want to try to get some more of these at some point in the future."
"O- a great pale ale. Standard to high on the bitter factor. Its a little one dimensional in flavor, but that's not to say it isn't verrry good. Think straight citrus. I'll have again, if I can find it..."
"O: Goes down easy, very tasty, not too filling, decent kick, a bit more IPA than APA, but a fantastic beer that I would absolutely hit up all the time."
"Overall: While I was a bit skeptical about whether this one could live up to all the hype, it turned out to be the best APA I've ever had... Another EXTREMELY well-done showing by Three Floyds. Do yourself a favor and get a bottle of this one!"
"And this is a much shorter review than normal because I'm headed up to Vermont to compare this to Hill Farmstead's Edward. They're in the same league."
"This is by far the best IPA I have ever had. I was excited to learn that Three Floyd started to bottle it. Although it is a rare find, I got my hands on some at Whole Foods in Chicago. I poured the beer into a stemless wine glass to appreciate the foggy golden color and offers a heavy mango aroma with hints of pineapple, floral and miscellaneous citrus scents. The first sip bites your tongue with the sting of hops like other IPAs, however the aftertaste doesn't linger, it finishes clean leaving a delightful taste behind. The carbonation floats down the side and reflects the light to shimmer, it such a way that it looks like it could be zombie dust! It is a very refreshing brew, and offers interesting comic artwork by Tim Seeley. I highly recommend if you can find it!"
"Overall: This is the craziest pale ale I have ever had, it's hard not to call it an IPA. Easily the best pale ale I have ever drunk."
"Thanks to a buddy for a bottle of this. Pours mostly a clear orange with a very slight haze to it with fluffy white head. Tastes of grapefruit and citrus hops. Nice crisp bitterness and it provides hop burps! Has to be one of the best pale ales out there."
"Thanks again Carleton."
"O- Amazing APA and probably my current favorite beer. Not a huge FFF fan (I know, weird right?) but this one is certainly a winner. Go find this right now and drink til your heart is content"
"12 oz bottle. Generous extra from dougofthefuture. Thanks Doug. Pours a cloudy golden amber with a small white head that has good retention and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is wonderful. Huge mango, light pineapple, light grapefruit, and some light honey. This is definitely a Citra hopped beer. The initial taste is some sweet mango that goes into a light breadiness with a bit of pineapple. The finish has some biscuit, more mango as well as a light bitterness. Light, slick mouthfeel and a relatively low carbonation. Great beer. I would love to be able to drink this regularly."
"O--This was an amazing offering from FFF. It reminds me, honestly, of Gumball Head. This would be my everyday go-to pale ale if it were accessible to me. Fantastic."
"Pours a nice golden orange haze with a big sticky off white head. The lacing on this one is sticky and hangs around. Smell is an absolute knockout. Huge pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine notes. Citrus goodness just dominates the aroma. I feel like I'm at an outdoor farmers market selling only tropical fruit. Taste is only a slight notch below the smell with the bulk of that citrus hitting you square in the palate. The tail end of the taste has a hint of grass included with the citrus. Mouthfeel is solid though a bit dryer at the end than I expected. This beer really goes down easy though. This is another winner from Three Floyds and one that I will always have on my wants list."
"O: Overall I am thoroughly enjoying this beer. The hype around this beer is justified and this comment will lead to that hype but this one really will not disappoint. Although this is an APA it hangs with pliny, sculpin, abner, etc. without question. If you have a chance to try this definitely don't miss out. 4.5"
"O: Well this is interesting. Not like anything I've ever really tasted before, and a really fresh take on the style for me. I really like the change of pace. The disparity between the nose and taste is a little bit confusing, but that's about the only complaint I have."
"O- good stuff. The smell was unbelievable and tasts although wasnt anything like the nose was still good."
"Edit: Had on tap at FFF and bumped scored a bit. Was (4/5/4/4/4)"
"Give me this, Oracle and 2009 Founders Harvest Ale every day, please."
"O - This will be my regular drinker. I'm a huge fan of pale ales and this one tastes wonderful, drinks easily and doesn't overwhelm the palate."
"Denser than it seems from the sweet taste. Leaves a great sticky film in my mouth."
"Overall: Wow. I literally could drink this beer all day, every day. Three Floyd's never disappoints. This one is just so drinkable. Perfect beer for warm weather. One of the best beers I've ever had."
"O: I always try to make sure I don't gush on a beer when I try to give it a review, but this one really just makes me happy. I always want to leave room for another beer to come along and blow me out of the water, but you also have to pay your respects when you have a beer that does just that. This one has rocked me to the core, and I can't believe what a sensory experience this is. It's a Pale ale with an infectious personality, and I can see why this would be called zombie dust. If i had enough of it with me, I'd drink this till I was a zombie myself. Put this on your wants, and get a full pack. I have to admit, I think this is better than Hoppy birthday -- sorry Alpine. It's the juiciness, I still love the pine nutty malt on hoppy birthday, but damn this juiciness."
"o: this can satisfy as a warm weather 'having a few' beer, or as a sipper-the flavors are much bigger than the abv would suggest. this is the only beer (gumball is close) that i can just drink over and over and over and not tire of it...it's all i want to drink and i have been struggling to consume some of the other standbys in my beer fridge."
"O: All I can say is WOW! Blown away. Easily the Best Pale Ale I've had. It's like an IPA with out the bitterness or sweetness. Hops shine through without wrecking your palate. Truly an amazing well crafted beer!"
"One day I hope to brew the equal of this beer. Until then we have Zombie Dust from FFF to drink. Get this if you can, it is staggeringly delicious."
"O: really the most complex and delicious Pale ale I've ever had, not too hopped, heavy, or malty, just balance in its purest sense. i need to get my hands on a case of this stuff"
"The body is light and the carbonation is good. Like I previously stated, a little dry on the finish. Overall great stuff. About as good as hoppy pale ales get."
"I love the Zombie Dust."
"the CPJ"
"Overall, this is an excellent pale ale. Like I said, the taste didn't quite live up to the nose, but that's mostly because this is such a nice smelling beer. Well done 3 Floyds, I actually prefer this to Dreadnaught."
"Huge fan of this very hoppy, very drinkable pale ale."
"O – I think this is the best beer of the year, or one of the highest I have ranked this year. I wish this was distributed into my market or I could obtain a keg of this stuff because I would only drink this. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking some up."
"O: A wonderful ""APA."" Like Alpha King, its hard to call this ""just"" an APA, but whatever it is, its damn tasty. Speaking of Alpha King, I'd love to try this head to head with fresh Alpha King."
"O - I'm trying to not go overboard but this might become one of my favorites. I was fairly impressed with this. Time may weather my opinion but right now I highly recommend this."
"Overall - worth that hype and man do i love this aftertaste of grapefruit. Its very refreshing and easy to drink."
"O: very tasty, the hops are the main attraction. But are mellowed by the wheat and malt profile. One of my favorite beers."
"O - Just a wonderful APA."
"this is all hops. just stunning. i want more."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer, much like most of what I've had from Three Floyds. I will be seeking this out again."
"I originally wanted this beer for the kickass artwork but after getting my hands on it, I think this might just be one of the best all-around pale ales I’ve ever had. Refreshing, complex, and very drinkable, it has everything you’d ever want from the style."
"SkÅL!"
"D. I enjoyed this beer, but not quite as much as my another Chicago-area pale ale - the supreme reign of Daisy Cutter continues. (It's a shame too since I'll be able to pick this up locally.)"
"O - Overall, this is my favorite APA I've had. Big and flavorful, yet easy to drink. A+"
"Thanks Carelton!"
"The appearance is a cloudy light gold color with a small but noticeable head that went away quickly. The smell is out of this world, reminds me of Gumball Head on steroids. The same fruity notes come out in both with this i get more floral tones than with the Gumball Head but very similar. Once I got past the formalities and actually got to taste it what I got in the smell carried over to the taste as far as it being similar to Gumball Head. This beer to me is a heavier more tasty version it. I enjoy drinking this and could see myself drinking multiple of these. This has a very good mouthfeel and is very pleasant to drink. Overall this is my 2nd favorite FFF beer but that puts it into the top 10 of all beers."
"4.5, 4, 3.5, 4, 4"
"O: I'm not a huge fan of bitter hops, but this is a well balanced beer with a nice flavor. The bitterness that lingers is easily combated with another drink..."
"Overall I am in love - this may be a new go-to on hot days, and certainly is a step above Alpha King. blasphemous? go try it out. i can't wait for the bottles to appear!"
"O - a really well-crafted beer, very interesting, bringing things to the table I've never encountered before in this style in a tasteful and tasty manner. Great beer!"
"Tastes as sweet as it smells, big juicy tropical hops explode on the palette, a slight bitterness hits at the end and slowly builds into a full presence. Smooth and creamy feel, but could probably be a bit more lively in the mouth. Overall a fantastic APA, but I still think I would take Daisy Cutter over it most days of the week..."
"O: Three Floyds packs a west coast style IPA featuring the delicious Citra hop in a pale ale package. Big flavor and low abv always rates well with me. "
"Carbonation is a bit lower than I would've liked, but this beer is the best APA, I've ever had, probably because it's a great IPA marketed as an APA. Considerably better than HF Citra and KR Citra imo, I've sampled both fresh from a just tapped keg and opened growler. Could not recommend this beer more!"
"Get it as soon as you can. This is one outstanding apa."
"Overall: I must start by saying that I am not a big fan of the ""HypeTrain."" Time and time again, I am let down because I let Hype tell me that ""x" beer will be insanely amazing. This beer lives up to the hype. Easily. I think Three Floyds raised the bar on this style for sure. Definitely gotta grab some of this if you are given the chance. This beer is absolutely fantastic."
"O- Probably the best pale ale I have ever had! Could easily drink a 6 pack of this in a night or day, which I never do. Very easy drinking crisp beer to enjoy frequently."
"Great job FFF!"
"Overall : this is my favorite beer to date. Easy to drink and big in flavor. Lots of hoppy goodness and IMO subtle hop bitterness . A beer drinkers beer. I'm so glad they finally bottled this beer and can enjoy it 12oz at a time instead of trying to smash a growler in one night."
"Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Overall, this is a really good beer."
"Overall: I don't think I can really do this beer justice. Possibly one of my favorite beers of all time and just one I could put down every single day and be happy to do it."
"This is the best beer I've had from 3 Floyd's. The major problem I have with this beer is that it's very high in alcohol for a pale ale. The taste totally works but for what it's labeled as I want that sessionability and the abv is just too high. Comes through just a little bit in the taste too. I have to knock it in the overall points because of that."
"Not quite the life-altering experience I'd hoped for, but easily one of the top five pales ales I've ever had, clearly behind only its brewery-mate Alpha King. Excellent beer. This is going to be a good evening."
"O: delicious. Best APA I've tried to date. Can't wait to see this in 6 packs!"
"O - Very good APA. Good hoppy beer."
"Finally got to have a couple of pints at the Tomlinson tap room. I've been looking forward to this one! Firstly, it's a beautiful beer. Orange-amber color with a good, whitish head. The aroma could only be better if there were more of it. Awesome citra hop, juicy, grapefruit goodness. The flavor has some caramel malt early, then the juicy hop flavor and finally a dry, slightly bitter finish. I wish it was just a touch smoother, but it's so good as is. Mouthful is nice. Overall, one the best I've had in quite a while. Lives up to my expectations."
"O - just a ridiculously awesome apa. Super drinkable and tons of flavor. This is even better than I expected. Possibly the best apa I've ever had."
"This is a wonderful APA. I would love to settle down to a 6 pack of this as the drinkability is great."
"I really really like this beer. I can easily say this is the best pale ale I've ever had. The flavor is simply phenomenal. If you have a chance to try this then go for it you will not regret it."
"Pours a nice orange color with white a white head. Simple but effective. You bring this beer near you and you get huge orangey hop smell. One dimensional in a fantastic way. The taste is huge orange hop flavor with a medium bitterness. Holy cow, this is fantastic if you like citra. The malts are there for only the smallest amount of balance and the citra hop gives off other, much smaller tropical fruit notes. Again, simple, but effective. Better than Daisy Cutter and equal to Hoppy Birthday, where hoppy birthday has less malt balance and a different type of hop flavor (pine). Good body and good carbonation. Wow, this is fantastic. Hopefully it holds up when they bottle it in the same way it comes off from the tap. Tied for the best APA I've ever had and lightyears past a local throwaway APA."
"O - Well that growler disappeared pretty damn quick. I could drink this one all day, every day, it is that good. The citra hops are the perfect choice for this beer and this is easily one of the best hop-forward pale ales I have ever had."
"D - Ridiculously drinkable, insanely balanced pale ale... perhaps the best straight-up pale ale I've ever had. Amazing. Reminds me of Alpine's Nelson."
"O: A wonderful beer. Great balance and drinkability. Can't wait for this one to come out in bottles."
"Overall: great session beer if you love citrusy hops. Went down way too easy! Great value when you can grab a case for $35 at 3 Floyds."
"Showed on tap at the brewpub when we got there. Nice surprise, I had a lot of expectations since I love citra and what I’ve heard from it. Aroma: This one is all hops: earthy, citrus and soap. Appearance: Pale orange with small head. Flavors: Light, some tropical fruits. Feels likes there is no backbone. Palate: Quite dry but too watery. Overall: Expectations were not met."
"O- This is an elite APA. Tons of tropical hop flavor delivered from those amazing citra hops balanced perfectly by the malts. Very refreshing, easy to drink, smells/tastes great...what more do you want? Dedicated my avatar to this beer, cannot wait until they bottle it!"
"D: Big hoppy pale ale. Super easy drinking, could sip on this all day. Just another reason why I wish I lived close to this brewery"
"Overall, I want more, all the time. Enough said. I can't wait until this bottles so I can avoid paying $24 for. Growler. Try this beer."
"O: This is a hell of a beer, and fits right in with others like Alpine's Hoppy Birthday and The Alchemist's Holy Cow in the trend of low ABV, super hopped delicious pale ales/IPAs. It's so ridiculously easy to drink and flavorful. I can't wait for bottles, because this could so easily be my go-to beer for a long, long time."
"One of the best pale ales I've ever had. I can't wait until they start bottling this. We got a growler to go and ended up finishing it in the hotel room. I could drink this beer all day."
"Overall if I lived in Chicago 3 Floyds area I would be there every weekend getting some of this goodness. Hands down mastery of hops and malt balancing. Now I have killed my growler and am both happy to have had this and sad that will be awhile before I can quench this hole it has left in my heart :("
"O: I waited a while to try this and I'm so happy it didn't let me down. Not only that, it completely blew me away and exceeded all expectations. A perfectly balanced beer and I can't wait until the bottling rumors become true."
"One of the best beers I've had. Period. I received this growler in a trade for some Brute. I think I won. LOL God DAMN what any experience. The moment I cracked the growler, I was amazed. This is the first beer I would describe as smelling ""dank"" in the pot aficionado manner of speaking. Poured a beautiful hazy orange with a rather meager head, which I attribute to the growler. The mouthfeel and taste are off the charts. This is easily one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had the good fortune of enjoying in all my beer drinking days. I can't wait for them to bottle this stuff. I'll be comin' back to this...one way or another. Alll your Z0mbie Dust is belongs to me."
"Overall maybe the best pale ale I've had but it's not a revelation. I've had some beers that were a revelation and this one is just maybe the best of it's style."
"O: This is a pretty rocking APA if that is what you want to call it. It reminds me of some of my home brews that I dump way more hops in than I should, but at the end of the day I like 'em that way!"
"overall: strong"
"Glad I got to try this. If you're a fan of Citra, you'll love this. It's a strange hop. If you've never had it, this is a great example."
"O: I am very impressed to say the least, this is exactly what I would like to see more breweries creating. A sessionable pale ale with the hop aroma and flavor of a world class IPA without all the IBUs. Drinkability is off the charts."
"I couldn't help but swirl the beer in my glass so I could keep drinking it. I can't wait until later in the year when they finally bottle this."
"4.0 D: This is a pretty good beer. It reminds me a lot of Selin's Grove IPA that I just had a few days ago, but a less intense version of that. Still, I would have no problem drinking this to get a citrusy hop fix."
"O - Overall an exceptionally well done APA. Another grew brew from the Floyds!"
"This is far and away my favorite beer from a brewery that frustrates me more often than not. Very, very nice."
"---Note: Had Zombie on tap at Three Floyds. Much better, fresher, rounder. Still, not the best APA I've had."
"O - When the zombie apocalypse comes, this'll be the first refreshing beverage I reach for after I massacre a hoard of zombies only to be overtaken and subsequently forced to out-run them for miles and miles. Seriously though, is this beer unique? No. It's been done plenty of times. But putting that aside, Zombie Dust is another brew which proves Three Floyds certainly know how to use and balance their hops."
"Overall – I give crap to FFF often, due to their prices, the fact I can’t find some of their classics ever (i.e. gumballhead), and because they don’t date their bottles. But hot damn if they didn’t get this beer right. I had two glasses of this and can’t wait for it to be in bottles. A fantastic beer that reminds me why FFF is held to such high regards by so many people."
"Poured clear copper color with an average frothy white head that lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy citrus hop aroma. Moderate bitter flavor with a moderate to heavy bitter finish of medium duration. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Very good brew."
"The scent was perfect as far as I was concerned. Beutiful balnce of subtle pine and citrus neither were overbearings that included hints of spice/floral aromas. The taste was incredible a perfec t taste that was not puniched or bolstered by high abv, which made this beer unbelievably drinkable. The smooth taste starts with pine hints then converts to citrus prior to teh swallow and lastly it comes of the pallete clean. I could session this beer all day....all night....wonderful. No question this beer is worth a try!!!"
"O - Great APA. I can't state enough how great that hop blend is in this, just right and delicious. Would definitely seek this out again. I will have no problem making sure this growler disappears."
"This is a fantastic APA, a ton of hops combined with a ton of flavor, I wish I lived closer than five and a half hours away to enjoy this beer more often."
"Definitely best APA I've ever had. Tie for best FFF brew with Arctic Panzer Wolf. If they had this as their flagship APA I think they'd be more famous than they already are, get yourself some bottles of this stuff."
"The carbonation is on the light side, halfway to a cask feel, excellent. It makes me wonder how much more I might like it if it was served on cask. Excellent, I bought 2 growlers to take home. Delicious stuff, very highly recommended."
"This is a good one - you've got to try it if you get the chance. I prefer it over the Cow."
"D-Overall i hope this beer gets bottled and i hope it get higher on this list. It tastes like a orangish Alpha king with alittle gumbal head in there. Love the balance of this beer and the great flavors that come from it.TRY this ONE!"
"O - A nice offering without an excess of anything, but enough of everything to make it enjoyable to most people's tastes."
"If I were Three Floyds, I’d make it in bottles. Maybe have a combo pack that includes a baseball bat with exposed nails in the top, you know, to prepare you for the inevitable zombie apocalypse."
"O- This is a simple beer that does something simple exceptionally well: showcase Citra hops. It's also extremely drinkable, as I had to 20oz. pours in about 30 minutes. I'm thankful that Three Floyds has decided to bottle this, as it's about the only beer from them that I will consistently have stocked in my fridge at all times."
"Pale golden-amber body capped by an inch of frothy, sticky head. Fantastic juicy ripe fruit aroma, melon coming to mind initially, followed by pineapple and guava. Not much malt character to speak of on the nose. Crispy, light, bready palate. Big hop flavor, pineapple and grapefruit up front, guava in the background - very juicy stuff. A very slight note of diacetyl that softens up the texture in a nice way. Mild, clean bitterness in the finish."
"Thanks Jim for the growler! Epic! Pours a hazy pale gold, slightly orange with minimal 1 finger head. Thin lacing lasts throughout nicely. Aroma is redolent of all types of citrus - mango, grapefruit, lemon peel, pineapple, and maybe a hint of green apple and honey. Taste is an utter hop bomb mango and grapefruit. Mild caramel dominate the palate. Body is medium with lower than average carbonation, oily on the tounge, and finishes extra dry with a very long lasting bitter citrus aftertaste. This was a really interesting APA. Glad to have tried this one out!"
" Still an apa when it's all said and done."
"Overall: excellent APA, good flavors, not too bitter, can’t wait to find this in bottles"
"Fruity hops hit first, more tangerine, sweet orange and grapefruit notes upfront. Resiny sticky hops linger into the pale malt middle, clean and a little grainy. Dry leafy green bitterness in the finish, hints of aspirin. Feel is relatively light, creamy and soft at first, drying out into the bitter finish. Good malty balance to the hefty dose of hoppage, approaching IPA territory for sure. Can't wait for the bottles, this is basically FFF's 1-up to local classic Daisy Cutter."
"Seems to lean more towards an IPA to me."
"O- This is a full flavored hop monster with a soft bitterness but even for this big beer it is very sessionable. The depth and character of the hops really work together wonderfully."
"Edit: Upon further review, this is the shit! (Scores adjusted)"
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this is an excellent APA. Definitely one the best I've had. Right up there with Hill Farmstead's Edward. Really easy to drink with lots of flavor. A great summer beer. Highly recommended for the style!"
"Overall a really nice APA. An easy one for sure to enjoy pint after pint of on a relaxing day."
"pours a golden orange. Tons of great white head. Very nice pour. Smells hoppy and and wonderful. Lots of pine and citrus. Tastes malty and hoppy. The bitterness from the hops is countered by a nice toffee sweetness. Mild but potent. Very solid body with a good carbonation level. Drinks very smoothly and crisply"
"O- Easily the best APA I've had and am continually blown away everytime I have this. One of the top beers I've tried this year. Another great brew from FFF."
"Simply another spectacular 3F presentation. This though is by far the best of the best. I will be attempting some Citra hopped brewing myself! Sierra Torpedo claims to have Citra but you cannot taste it. 3F needs to reach the NY tri-state area soon! After all the Brooklyn Brewing ""garbage"" is in ChiTown!"
"Overall, this is an absolutely amazing brew. For me it blows Alpha King out of the water. The citra hops are just so vivid here with little to get in their way, but it's never unbalanced. A great, great beer. Please bottle soon."
"Overall a fantastic brew. My first Citra hopped beer and I think I found my newest favorite hop."
"O: Really easy to drink and a great flavor and aroma."
"This is a just another in a long line of awesome hoppy beers from Three Floyds, as this stands right up there along such other fantastic APAs from them as the Alpha King and Pride & Joy. There is a LOT of fruity sweetness to this from those Citra hops, which took me a bit to wrap my palate round, but once more of that balancing grapefruit bitterness came out to play, I was fully on board. I hope rumors of the eventual bottling of this come to fruition."
"This beer pours out as an amberish orange color. Quite hazy too. Good lacing for a thin white head. Light citrusy aroma on the nose. Smells almost more like an ipa than a pale ale. Good hoppy taste with a little bit of a Malt aftertaste. Dry aftertaste as well nice citrus all around from start to finish with this beer."
"I've had this many times over the years, and every time it's been better since that DLD. Super easy to drink and one of my favorite APA's ever...bumping it up a bit."
"Since this is called a pale ale, I'm not sure what to say there. In many ways it is more pale ale than IPA but the hops are just so in your face...."
"O: Really nice. I don't think this is an APA, way more of an IPA, but nonetheless, very nice brew. I hope they bottle this. Skal."
"The mouthfeel was nice but perhaps the only weak link in the armor of a solid offering. It wasn't bad, but the light body was a touch grainy and, while the carb was perfect, the finish was a bit dry and bitter. Overall, Zombie Dust is the real deal - a beer every lover of hops, citra, and APA's should have on their radar. I'll be sure to grab some bottles if they come out, but, in the meantime, I'll be asking for growlers from anyone passing by FFF. Awesome beer, perhaps a bit overhyped, but solid nonetheless."
"Overall: Outstanding stuff. So damn drinkable. I had 3 pours of this."
"Medium bodied, slightly higher carbonation, smooth and easy on the palate and ultra drinkable. This was absolutely fantastic - I like it more than Alpha King."
"Overall: Another success from 3 Floyds. The balance is great with just the right amount of bitterness that dominates but doesn't crush the other flavors or your tongue."
"O- Seriously, this is the best APA I have had to date and I don't know if it can get much better. I also had the 3Kings on this trip to the pub and though that was also an A beer, this one just rocks; its unreal. I ended up buying a growler to go of both ZD and 3Kings because these APAs made me have an out of body experience. Thank you FFF for creating Zombie Dust..."
"I hope Three Floyds does what everyone around me was suggesting and puts this on their regular rotation. Incredible complexity for a single hop IPA. Citrus hops are much more versatile than I thought."
"M/D: Well carbonated, it finishes dry. Clean crisp and refreshing the entire way. Really hope to see them bottle this. This is 7%? Surely not!"
"Overall: A very good pale ale with mild hoppiness and drinkability."
"D- I really enjoyed this brew and a brought a growler back home with me."
"A tropical fruit, pineapple bomb, and I love it. I can't wait for this to find its way into bottles. When it does I will be making some trades."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"Hops balanced with malts balanced with sweet balanced with bitter. This beer should have been called Zen Rock Garden. I cannot wait to buy it in bottles."
"Tastes very much like it smell. Has that character Floyds minerality, flinty flavor and feel to it from the house yeast? Or water? Great acidity in the middle and a long drawn out finish. Again cat pee, citrus, dominate very juicy, oily hops not to bitter on the finish but oh so tasty."
"Missed this one before, but now I get to try it on cask. Second chances rock. It pours a clear, bright, lemony straw topped by a finger of cream-white froth and populated by some minor floaties. Were it not for that last bit, this would probably look damn near perfect. The nose comprises orange zest, grapefruit, lemon zest, apricot, very light leek, and mild caramel. The taste holds notes of orange zest, orange rind, lemon peel, grapefruit (both red and white), light pine, mandarin orange, and some even milder caramel than before. The body is a rather light medium, with a very light carbonation and a rich, smooth feel. Overall, a very nice APA. I probably didn't think as highly of it as many, but it is a damn fine beer, let me tell you."
"Overall: Enjoyable APA: too boozy to be a session beer, but one that really lets you enjoy the hop flavor without making your mouth pucker. I was really impressed by the tangy sweetness of this beer, and I'll definitely look for it as the weather warms up."
"drinkable - very. overall, nice sweet, enjoyable."
"D:Extremely drinkable, had my first imperial pint down in the matter of 15-20 minutes while still talking to a fellow patron. Ended up having another one and wanted to keep going after that was done but unfortunatly had to go. Looks like I'll have to wait till the six packs come out to get some more of this delicious nectar."
"O - twice I have noted out loud 'this is exceptional' while sampling, great balance of hop and sweet, each sip is savored, a new personal favorite. Sampled at 3Floyds brewpub."
"On tap at haymarket, reviewed from notes. Poured into nonic, hazy golden yellow with a small one finger white head that fades leaving some lacing. Smell is very refreshing, lots of citrus hops, grassy, some straw and light malts, a bit of floral hops as well. Tastes very hoppy for an APA, which I am fine with. Citrus grassy hops, not overly bitter, a bit of balance from the light malt presence. Light body with a medium carbonation, very crisp and refreshing. This beer is amazing - I will get this anywhere I see it on tap. A perfectly drinkable hoppy APA, very refreshing. I look forward to drinking this beer all summer."
"D/O- Bottom line, this is the best pale ale I've ever had. Drinkability is through the roof. Three Floyds nailed it once again."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy pale color, there is but only a slight head on the surface. The smell is great citrusy hops, there is really not malt in the aroma, but there really doesn't have to be with this beer. The flavor is the perfect combination of hops with the slightly sweet malt background. It's so simplistic and so well done. It goes down so smooth, there isn't too much bittering, this is the most perfect beer for this style. I really really like this beer. It's too simplistic to have much detail into this citrusy wonderfully hoppy APA, but damn if I don't love it."
"Overall (4): Very drinkable and very enjoyable. I was happy to have this one on tap as I don't get 3F more than a few times a year. This one had all the big citrus flavors you expect from Citra hops and was well constructed to highlight them without being too off-balance. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Grade: A+ (Yeah, it really is that good.)"
"Overall this is one fantastic beer. The more I drink of it, the more I love it, and I thought it was fanastic to start with."
"The first sip goes down oh so smooth. It is very crisp and juicy. I get lots of orange citrus taste that was so present in the nose. It is a little dry but not overbearing. I want more! Alpha King is a great beer, especially for a flagship brew, but this APA is several notches above it in my opinion. I can't wait for this to hit bottles and I can't even get them here when it does!"
"Overall this is an excellent choice and I was ecstatic to see it on tap, definitely will get this one whenever I see it available."
"O - An excellent beer, to say the least. Very refreshing and the hop character is wonderful. I love me some citra! A must-try at the Brewpub."
"Had on-tap at FFF Brew Pub. Exceptional citrusy, grapefruit, fresh aroma. Appearance is golden to straw colored with a good 1.5 finger head poured into an imperial pint. Taste is fantastic as this beer tastes exactly as it smells. Far different animal to FFF Alpha King. No real malty taste, just intense fresh citrus. Exceptional drinkability. Another great offering from FFF."
"D - Let's say the growler was pretty much dusted solo. Very quaffable and refreshing. I wish it was a warmer evening in LA."
"Missed the hand-pull cask by one pint and was disappointed when they brought me a porter. Thankfully they did not charge me for it, but I had been looking forward to a side-by-side comparison of Zombie dust cask with the tap. That dream must wait. As I await a bottling of this amazing beer."
"D- I liked both the draft and cask, but in the end preferred the subdued quality of the cask more. I enjoyed this beer when it was called Cenotaph and continue to enjoy it as Zombie Dust. Would gladly buy in any format that is produced and sold."
"I have been infected with the zombie dust and I am now craving CITRA... MMM CITRA... CCIIITRAAA...."
"Zombie Dust is a very smooth American Pale Ale with exquisite citrus and tropical fruit flavor. While some prefer the more intense pang of bitterness in the throat, this ale is much more delicate and soft than more conventional hop-forward beers- making a standout that has no competition!"
"D: This is very drinkable, and very tasty. I think I put away most of the growler on my own. Fantastic stuff."
"D: Refreshing pale ale could drink for hours on end. Light and smooth."
"This is definitely a crushable (makes beer chugging gesture) beer that I am now really regretting that I did not get a growler of. I found it to be very similar to some of the super hoppy west coast APAs that I have tried, but with just enough of that more balanced Midwest feel to make it that much more enjoyable."
"No doubt, I would definitely order this one again."
"It looks good with a nice light orange color it also has a finger width of head that clings to the sides of the glass. The smell is fantastic huge piney notes with citrus. The taste is fantastic it has great bitterness for the style more than I expected. The pine and citrus carries right through the nose to the taste. The mouthfeel is amazeing if I didn't know what I ordered I would have thought this was an ipa not a apa. Compared to other apa's this blows all others out of the water. I hope they put this in six packs the drinkability is crazy good."
"The appearance wasn't anything mind blowing but I loved the smell, the grapefruit, the floral aroma, oh man, I could sit with my nose deep into a glass of this for awhile. The taste reminded me of Double Trouble from Founders which is a bit random, but it's what immediately came to mind. Maybe not as complex a taste but still really strong. Great hops presence, good sweetness but not to cloying. This is extremely drinkable and the growler flew by. I hope 3F's makes this a regular, I would love to have this to drink during the summer months. Just when you start to wonder if 3F's can bring something new to the party, they drop this delightful treasure."
"The mouthfeel is pretty light making this APA very approachable and drinkable."
"I grabbed this at the Trion in New Haven, IN near Fort Wayne. It was on draft and they offer takeout growlers. I heard about it from a couple friends who couldn't say enough about it. I would definitely agree it is a great beer and was a nice surprise (that's a biased statement, I'm a big 3f supporter). It is a very clear light golden color. The smell is great with a very fresh hops dominance. The taste is good, and very light on the malt presence. I was expecting something closer to alpha king, but it doesn't have the richness. It's unusually smooth, light and refreshing. Definitely has a potent hops presence, with lots of citrus spice. Seems like a great session beer and would be great with some spicy food. I hope it becomes a regular."
"d- this beer was fantastic hands down!"
"Beer is relatively light in body with a very mild sweetness lead off and an explosion of hop character in the midpalate. The finish of the beer is mildly bitter but it is a wonderfully rounded beer with so much hop flavor. It's lighter than I expected and not quite as bitter but I suppose this is an APA and not an IPA, I would have more of this anytime."
"The taste was this sort of sublime soft citrus, with lots of lemon, apricot, and grapefruit, some tropical notes, lots of hop flavor, but a very silky mouthfeel and a very dry, pleasant ending with only a trace of bitterness. Excellent beer, and I'm very pleased I stopped by the Pub while it was around."
"Recently made my way through a case of this with the help of some friends. Absolutely phenomenal beer. Right up there with the best hoppy beers in the world."
"overall the opinion was shared by all, this was better then most anything i have had in a long, long time."
"D - I found this not the easiest 6.2% to drink. It's pretty good, wouldn't mind it again."
"D: this is one of the few beers I have had that meets and exceeds my expectations by a wide margin. Fantastic."
"The flavor really takes off on what was present in the nose. There is quite. Bit of tropical fruit, some orange, and then quite a bit of nice bitterness. Really nice how the flavor and bitterness interact here. Feel is bitter.and a bit light with really nice cabontion. Thrilled that this was still here and am very glad I got to try it. Will be bringing a growler back for the DC folk to enjoy."
"Drinkability -- A damn tasty APA, though the single-hopping has made it a bit one-dimensional. It all depends on how much one likes Citra hops - great aromatics and fruity flavors, but is somewhat lacking in earthy bitterness to counterbalance the caramel malt sweetness that this varietal is always paired with to make those juicy citrus, apricot, and peach notes sing. All in all, absolutely worth a try."
"Drink- I plan on finishing this growler watching the Eagles v Giants game today."
"I could easily finish a few of these"
"D - It'd be pretty easy to crush a growler of this while watching a football game, but the weak body and flavor has me reaching for Daisy Cutter instead."
"Great beer here. The carbonation is perfect, and I could sit and drink way too many of these if 3F were down the street. As much as I enjoy Alpha King, I would rate this one even higher with better drinkability. The common trait they share in my opinion is that neither really drinks like an APA, but a great IPA. Well done 3F... what an impressive brewery!"
"Extremely high. Might be the most sessionable beer from FFF. Hopefully they have this on tap for awhile."
"5 hour old growler provided by Alex...Pours a brilliant clear orange, a light white head good retention...Citra aroma, what else do you expect. Not much different than any other citra beer. Nice, just doesn't stand out from the others, but I like it...The taste is more citra hops, a little orange, and yeast, not bad but I'm not feeling this as much as the citra's Its not meaty enough to stand up to the flavors, needs a strong backbone."
"D - Here is where this one shines. Crisp, fresh, and very easy to drink. This might just be the most drinkable beer I've ever had from FFF. I could easily knock off three pints on my own, maybe even an entire growler if I was feeling ambitious. I'm sure this one will become available in bombers. At least I hope it will..."
"D: Fairly high, although the earthy/bitter aftertaste may get to be a bit much after a second glass. Still, there is great balance in this beer. Overall though, I was very impressed with this beer. In fact, I had it alongside daisy cutter and it blew daisy cutter out of the water in my opinion."
