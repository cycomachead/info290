"Really nice PA,just cant quite stack up to the Top ones in the style."

"Reddish gold color. The head dissipated quickly. Strong hop flavor. Next complexity."

"O:  This must have gotten its second wind after expiring, but the hops are lacking.  This probably isn't exactly what they had in mind, but it did have 2015 on the label and it was shiny, clean and had no dust.  I've had fresh pale ales that I don't like as much as this though."
""
"Overall:  This is an excellent, beautifully balanced American Pale Ale.  I’ll definitely get some more of this!"
"Looks great and tastes fine. Its beer."

"The alcohol was good and while the carbonation was present, it wasn't enough to detract from the somber taste and feel of this beer. Maybe it was the caramel malts that were a bit out of lace here, but regardless, this was a good example of the style that would be a nice deviation from the more popular takes on this style that are more common. A bit more dry-hopped and full than I would have liked, I'd have this again to take a break from stronger and hoppier versions of an APA."

"Nice taste and content 5.5% Alc/Vol     nice after drinking heavier beers this is flavorful"
""
""
""
""
"Pretty average APA, easy to drink but nothing too remarkable.  Glad it isn't as intense as some of their other beers.  No longer easy to find in Colorado, so probably won't have this as much as I used to, I guess."

"Really like this pale ale. It has a lot of up front hop aroma and flavor with low bitterness... Almost not enough. This is an IPA with training wheels. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn to be a hop head. Nice complex hop flavor and great balanced malt profile."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one intrigues me. I've had it before straight out of the bottle and a bit more citrus and malt sweetness came through. Maybe that one was fresher, who knows. Still a solid brew."

"05/02/12 On Tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. As stated often stated, I'm happier with less hops, so this is not bad. Something in there has a slight perfumy (not in a bad way) effect. I'm not up on the attributes of the various exotic hops herein but all in all I like it as a change of pace."

" Overall a 3.5 for Doggie Style Classic Pale Ale from Flying Dog Brewery. It was more tame than I thought it was going to be, which is fine by me. I'm slowly, just now starting to get into IPAs and APAs. I enjoyed this since it wasn't too extreme, the malt taste did its job awesomely. I'll probably get this brew again."

"O: for $10 a six pack this can't be beat. If drank from the bottle, the greatness of the beer is lost. Foolishly I did this with 5/6 of the beers. The aromas and flavors need to expand and develop a liveliness, which can only be accomplished by releasing it from its brown-neck prison."

"This beer is okay; not great, but decent. Looks murky and burnt orange. The head is nice and creamy and a thin layer of lacing remains throughout the beer. Smells like piney hops and mild malt. Not an overpowering smell or taste. The taste starts out a little fruity but then a piney hop bitterness takes over mid drink. This beer doesn't seem to be very balanced. In a world of hoppy pale ales, this one doesn't quite stand out. But overall a decent offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brilliantly clear medium golden color with a huge bubbly off white head that persists forever. Aromas of earth and caramel and little else. The favor is sweet with bready caramel malt and hints of earthy hop to balance. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Decent brew, drinkable, maybe a lawnmower beer, nothing horribly exciting and no bottle dating."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""

"O - First time I've had anything from Flying Dog. I don't know why I always overlook them. Anyway, this is a fine pale ale. Glad to have tried and I will seek out others from this brewery."

"O-still underwhelmed by this beer. I have tried to like it, but cant in good faith say its much more than okay. I don't find it smooth and it feels more like an IPA to me, which is fine, but I'd like to taste a little more sweet malt in a pale ale."
""
""
""
"Classic pale ale, just as the name says. Crisp, slight hoppy bitterness. Pale brownish color...just as you would expect. The mouthfeel was fine, soft, white head that went down relatively smooth. Not always a huge fan of Flying Dog, sometimes the beers are a bit commonplace, but this one was pretty good as it was designed to be straightforward."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a superbly done beer. This should be the beer to get someone started in pale ales if they've never had one. It turned me into a big fan of Flying Dog Brewery."
""
""
"Overall this seems like a competent option for someone wanting a lighter alternative to an IPA/DIPA. Or someone acquainting themselves with hoppy craft beers. I try to balance my reviews between style expectations and my personal preferences. Bottom line: I wouldn't seek this out but I wouldn't turn it down either. If you like a light, refreshing pale ale, you should like this."
""
""
""
""
"Served in a pint glass. Had a golden yellow color with a nice white head. Lots of lacing on the glass. The smell is cut grass and citrus. The mouth feel is crisp and a little sweet. The taste is like the smell, grass, citrus. There is a slight hop bitterness but not to strong. Very light hope flavors over all. This is a nice drinkable brew, very clean crisp flavors. Good with a wide range of foods."

"Doggie style is a nice session drinking beer. Not too strong or heavy, and a flavor that will keep you satisfied. Very balanced beer, reminds me of the brew free or die from 21st. If you want a ""party"" craft beer this is a good choice. Plus you get to ask your girl if she wants some doggie style."

"Poured orange amber with one finger of foam that didn’t last and no lace to speak of. It’s clear and has nice beer bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Nose is grass, leaf and herbal. Some grapefruit some forest and pine in back of that. Smells dry. Malt is biscuit, sweet bread and caramel. The malt nose sweetens as it warms with some pale honey. Taste is woody, earthy, both bitter and sweet. Semi dry. Malt base is sweet grain but doesn’t round out. Hops are tangy with the classic cascade profile of grapefruit and pine. Body is a little thin and it drinks a little heavy with the carbonation. It’s unbalanced and watery. I’m looking for something as I drink and not finding it. The bitterness lingers but not well and the alcohol comes to the palate in the finish. This one’s forgettable."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 4/24/2013. Pours slightly hazy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, caramel, biscuit, floral, and light pine. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop and malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, caramel, biscuit, floral, and light pine. Slight floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, caramel, biscuit, floral, and light pine on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of hop and malt flavors; with good robustness of flavor and no cloying present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale ale. Nice balance of hop and malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – It contains an overall nice blend of citrus hop, sweet flavors and malty flavors. A rather tasty brew with a easy drinking feel and taste."
""
""
""
""
" The taste has a slight pine bitterness from the hops with mild malt sweetness in the flavor which adds a slight caramel contrast to the light lemon zest flavor combined with the grapefruit aspect the hops add to the light fruity yeast element. The taste tapers to a more dry and bitter hop flavor in the final sips but is pretty balanced in general leaving a lingering hop acidity on the backside. Overall this is great - more of a west coast Pale in the sense it focuses more on hops and is a small version of the IPA in their repertoire, but juicy citrus and enjoyable drinkability for me -I like the freshness and would purchase this again."

"Taste starts with caramel malt and heavy bread. Has a little bit of roastiness throughout, with a hint of floral and citrus on the finish. Has a bit of creaminess, heavy body for an PA with heavy and lively carbonation."

"4.01/5.00"

"A decent beer but not what I would have expected. Kind of a ""Bud Light"" feel."

"Pours medium copper, good topper of white bubbly foam. Sticks. Piney hop nose, malt/toffee too. Chewy full caramel malt flavor, bitter everywhere. In a balanced way though. Really nicely balanced and makes for a tasty, balance bitter APA. Very nice."
""
""
"Overall - Really hits a sweet spot for a pale ale in my opinion. Light and refreshing. Just the right amount of hops. and complementary flavors to round it out."

"Copper in color. Didn't really smell like much until it warmed up a bit. Smell is mostly malt with a hint of hops. Taste is much like the smell. Hearty malt backbone with just a bit of hops at the back end to round it out. This is more my style of pale ale. Solid offering from flying dog."

"355ml bottle. Tumbler glass. Enjoyed on sep´12. Slightly orangish gold in color. Haze. Beige froth. Quite lasting & close crown. Strong resins, candies & caramel malts to the nose. Quince & tangerine hues. Citric underneath too. Flavor profile shows well balanced mildy toasted malts & hops. Medium & flavorful body. Medium to high carbonation. Buttery & oily texture. Refreshing bitterness in the middle. Fruity & resiny finish. Hoppy aftertaste."

"Wonderfully balanced with malts and hops both featuring, a nice smooth and refreshing feel to it and a great smell that is backed up by the taste. One of the best I've had from an American brewery I think, particularly from the relatively lower abv. ones."

"O - I am pleasantly surprised with this one. I'd had their IPA before and didn't really care for it, but this I like a lot. Well balanced flavors and very drinkable."
""
"Doggie Style reminds me of Great Lakes Burning River a lot, only it's a little less toasty. Similar hop profile, less pine and more floral notes. Not quite as good, but almost equally satisfying."
""
""
""
""
"Not a a bad beer overall. I prefer a true IPA rather than an American ale. This beer just wasn't hoppy enough for my taste buds. The other beers I have had from the Flying Dog Brewery were more memorable. Raging Bitch was better. This isn't a beer I would turn down, but I won't look for it either."
""
""
""

"O: a pretty solid pale ale, if you like em a bit of the biscuity and grainy side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz. bottle poured into a mason jar. Deep, clear amber color with a healthy, steady head. Beery aroma with no predominant highlight. Feels light on the tongue, not too carbonated. Tastes clean and mellow, very balanced, just bitter enough to give it some character. This is a good tasting, easy-drinking beer, one which would be a good call in almost any setting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown and darker than other pale ales. Lightly malty in the nose. Sweet malt taste with a pleasant hop finish that I could definitely do all day. It is only 5.5% so no dui's. Perfectly balanced body and hop character. It also has good carbonation. I would love to try on draft."
"This isn't the kind of beer that will make you bend over and grab your ankles. It's a nice APA and easy drinking, but that's about as far as it goes. The hop profile seems a little out of whack when paired with the lighter toasted elements."
""
""
""

"Overall - Definitely not impressed with this one. Nothing particularly appealing about it, and the taste wasn't very enjoyable. Not terrible, I wouldn't refuse this beer if offered, but for your money there are much better choices out there."
""
""
"O: Overall a good drinker and like it . Very sound beer with good qualities over shadowing the bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, not bad. Taste was not great but it gets a 3.5 because I cannot do 3.25 and because it has a different taste for a pale ale that worked well. Aroma was certainly disappointing. Could have used some dry hopping to give it some aroma."
""
""

"Overall - Really good pale ale. Well layered, not too bitter hop profile, given a semblance of balance by a solid malt backbone. Classic American Pale Ale is right."
""

""
"This beer has plenty of character. It has a nice malty smell and pours a beautiful gold with a white 1 1/2 head. Remarkable lacing can be observed on the glass. Mouthfeel is very nice, full but not overpowering.Taste is smooth giving way to an assertive hoppiness with a mocha aftertaste. I love this one and would recommend it to anyone looking for a beer with some character."

"Overall it's a hoppy toast brew, but it's just too wet and watery to carry everything. Not that great unfortunately."

"Big tan head that sticks to some extent throughout the session. Some brown swirls mix in. Typical malts and earthy hops present to the nose and tongue. Medium bodied. Easy drinking. APAs are what they are, a gateway drug to the IPA, which in no way detracts from their place in the American beer pantheon."

""
"Overall: a decent beer, although it doesn't precisely float my boat. Well-crafted, though, and I'd take the opportunity to try this on tap if given one."
"Pours a clear copper with a caramel color head. Head retention is decent, particularly as it is continuously fed by carbonation bubbles migrating from the bottom of the glass. The bouquet is mown grass and sweet citrus. There's a nice mouthfeel that compliments the orange, apricot, toffee, and pilsner flavors. Decent beer. Quite drinkable."
""
"Overall: A light and drinkable beer. Nothing spectacular, but a solid brew."

"Slightly cloudy pale ale with a towering head from a vigorous pour. Nice dark brick orange color with a beige head. Decent lacing and active carbonation. Smell has mild breadiness with an orange citrus hop. Some light caramel malt sweetness with a touch of fruitiness. Taste is hop forward with a tasty malt core that glues the light orange and bigger grapefruit hoppiness together. Hops are the star here in case you were wondering. Finish is dry and mildly bready with a dry hopped pucker. Feel is crisp and light with a refreshing swallow. A nice drinkable ale that is always welcome"
"Ive tried a few APA's now and so far this is my favorite. Brewery is also very close so getting this stuff fresh isnt an issue. I do tend to buy S.N pale ale a bit more because of price, but I enjoy the doggie style just a bit more. I normally pour my beers into a glass, but sometimes I just gotta keep this one in the bottle and display that wonderful Ralph Steadman artwork. Keep it GONZO!"
"Beer is light-medium bodied. It washes down quick and easy and is refreshing. No coating or stickiness, dry ending, little bit bitter."

"Overall, I'm pretty disappointed here. Flying Dog is usually solid, but this pale ale is just average at best. Very watered down and just bland."
""
""
"Not as bitter as some pale ales, which makes it easy to drink. I found the big hop flavor without the big hop bitterness to be an interesting and welcoming touch."
""
""
""
""
"o: pretty good apa. will be buying more of these. just wish it had more of a hop profile with a fuller body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I had a mouthgasm. This is the best beer by Flying Dog so far, even better than the famous Raging Bitch. So good, I think I'll have to wash these pants."
"This beer poured out with a nice looking copper color with a thin white head on top. The head leaves a touch of lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer was malty and hoppy, pretty well balanced I'd say. The taste of the beer had a good sweetness upfront that fades into a dry finish. The mouthfeel of this beer was pretty good, plenty of carbonation to it and a drinkable body as well. Overall this brew was nice, I can't really say too much about it in a bad way. It's a good drinkable brew."
"O: This was a very nice beer; obvious American hops, but in great balance with the hops - usually the hops overpowers the malt, but in this beer the balance is great."

"Overall this is a good pale ale. I would definitely buy and drink this again."

"12oz bottle, pours amber with a bubbly off-white head that has good retention leaves great lacing on the glass. Aromas are huge with floral hops dominating the nose, with hints of citrus and toasty grains in the background. Tastes are bitter right from the start with loads of pungent grapefruit rind, pine, and floral hops dominating the palate with tons of astringency that's hard to get past. Some notes of caramel, toasted grain, and slight soapy character try to peek through, but the balance is way off for a pale ale. Mouth-feel is medium bodied but overly carbonated. Overall: I like hoppy beers, but balance is key to making them work. Not a complete failure here, but not exactly what I was hoping for either. The astringency and severely dry finish is too much for me."

"Review from 6/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a medium dark orange amber, thin head, but a bit of lacing. Faint aroma of caramel malt, very faint hops. Light to medium bodied. Light sweet and caramel malt followed by a dry non-aromatic hop finish. No off flavors and pleasant to drink, but low key flavors and nothing stands out. A more than adequate decent ale in a pinch."

"Amber colored body with a respectable off white frothy head. The aroma is both heavy with malt and hops, aromatic citrus hops, caramel malts. The flavor is well balanced, nice toasty pine notes with a pronounced grapefruit zest character. Finish is crisp, bitter/sweet and dry."
"DRINKABILITY: This is a balanced, moderately hopped session ale. Easy to drink, repeatable and well priced, it is definitely worth having again and I'd serve it to others with no qualms. Though there are better examples of the APA style, this is a good, solid APA."

"I tried it in a bottle at a random Original Joe's restaurant up here in Richmond, BC - kind of odd we'd get some random selection from Maryland here - but I'm glad we did. It's delicious and I'd recommend it to anyone."

"O: Very good beer, smells great and I love the hop flavor. Just a very well put together beer."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy light orange with a tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty underwhelming with some malt and herbal hop aromas. Taste is also pretty average with a basic malt and herbal hop combo. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average pale ale in my opinion and I am not very impressed by this one."

"Pours a bit hazy with decent sized white head. Smell is bland with slight pine hops, not much citrus, and some pale malts. Taste seems off. Not much sweet or bitter, a little funky and dusty, wondering if this was an old bottle. Kind of strange. Light dry mouthfeel, a little watered down, with low to medium carbonation. Mediocre at best."
"Overall - It's a beer that you can enjoy on any occasion and one that you really can't go wrong with. It's a nice and simple craft beer that is a pleasure to knock back and enjoy"

"The palate is balanced and quite delicous, extremely drinkable. Smooth with just enough bitterness, very flavorful, will gladly go for this brew any time!"
"a very standard beer, but amazingly sessionable. i will give it good marks for that. smells like caramal malts and hearty bread. plenty more hops in the flavor than the nose, on the piney, earthy end of the spectrum. amber malt middle and a majorly crisp finish. this would be an excellent pale ale for the summer, ice cold right from the bottle. mouthfeel is very liberally carbonated and finishes clean, lighter for an american pale ale. better than average"
"In conclusion a pretty good hopy pale ale. Easy to drink but kind of boring."
""
""
"Not bad. Not great."
"A bit dark for a pale ale but still a nice copper color, very strong aroma of hop, a bit different then I was expecting. I can't really put my finger on this one I think I may have a bad one. It looked as it had been on the shelf a while, over all just a bit tart, not really sure about this I'll have to give it another go."

"Overall: Really impressed with what Flying Dog has done with this beer. The updated recipe has improved the flavor and aromatics, but the beer is still recognizable as the Doggie Style they've been making for 20+ years. Light body and ease on the palate made this a great beer for the beach. A go-to pale ale."

"Overall: Decent brew. Slightly unbalanced, but not bad. I prefer hoppier, brighter pale ales."
"Beer is thin, grainy on the finish, a little dry, mild hop character. Not a great APA but decent, other than the aftertaste just an OK beer."
""
""
""
""
"Nothing wowing though"
"Overall, not my favorite beer, it's still a good beer though. I'm more of a dark lager guy myself, but I'd still take this beer over many others in Pale Ale category."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is light hops, mostly pine but with some notes of citrus in there, too. Overall, this one's an easygoing, easily-sessionable pale ale. Not flashy or really standout, but more than enjoyable to this palate."

""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: Lacks the hops that I desire in an American Pale Ale. Maybe if it was fresher, but without a date...who knows how old this is. Couple the lack of hops with the metallic aspect, and this sits at about average at best."

"O: A decent APA that is not overpowering in any respect, but is tasty and enjoyable. I would have it again."
"Taste is a good, basic pale ale, but not great, simple, and a touch too sharply bitter in the finish. It is minerally, grassy-peppery, yeasty, and dryish up front, with faint caramelised pepper citrus and grassy bitterness, light caramelly sweetness. It is a bit vague and nondescript."
"O- It's a lot like Sierra Nevada only easier to drink and less spicy. An excellent well rounded beer."
""

""

"This beer poured out with a nice looking copper color with a thin white head on top. The head leaves a touch of lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer was malty and hoppy, pretty well balanced I'd say. The taste of the beer had a good sweetness upfront that fades into a dry finish. The mouthfeel of this beer was pretty good, plenty of carbonation to it and a drinkable body as well. Overall this brew was nice, I can't really say too much about it in a bad way. It's a good drinkable brew."
"Copper with little head at all. There is a subtle fresh hop nose here, but it is not strong by any means. The upfront flavor is a bit bland followed by a finish that is pleasantly bitter from both malt and hop influence. There is certainly nothing special here, but it is overwhelmingly ok."

"My final thoughts. Overall this is a balanced, moderately hopped session ale that could easily be consumed 6 at a time. A solid offering by my taste."
"Overall: Not my favorite pale ale but this one can definitely stand alone on its own or pair nicely with a wide variety of foods."
"12oz bottle. Pours a semi-translucent burnt orange color with a half inch of head. Aroma is bready with some malts and a bit of floral hops. Taste is more of the breadiness, with some caramel malt. Some floral hops at the end. Tiny amount of bitterness. Somewhat of a lighter beer with a thin mouthfeel. Easy to drink but not a huge amount of flavor. Not bad, not great. Decent beer for the mix 12 pack I got it in. Overall, nothing special but good enough."
"It's crisp and drinkable, I guess. You could probably drink more than one. But like any beer that is light on flavour and character, the question always remains: would you want to?"
"Overall - Decent and real easy to drink. This would be a great starter beer for a typical macro drinker, or a person just getting into ipa's and such. Its soild and tasty, just a little to light and weak for a seasoned drinker. Not bad, a nice summer beer for sure."
"Thoroughly enjoyed visiting this brewery several years ago and have consistently sought this particular beer out since. Definitely a beer I'll purchase again!"
"O - Hop characteristics are a little lacking but hey, at least it's drinkable..."
"O-Although it smelled and tasted great the rest of the beer was just a let down. Although it was one of the more malty APAs I can recall."
"O - I was a little overzealous giving out a 5 for the drinkability (third review ever), and it's very possible that I got an old, different or defective bottle before, because my opinion of this beer has radically changed with one purchase. I still wouldn't place this as the best pale in America, but it's sure up there"
"O: Solid APA that is pretty drinkable and looks and smells great. I like this one."
"Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint. Clear amber-orange with moderate head and nice lacing. Citrus and grapefruit primarily, also smells dry and spicy. Somewhat mild, but that is typical of APAs and the smell lasts throughout the entire beer. Citrus and grapefruit bitterness, countered by a pretty dry malt balance. Somewhat spicy and peppery. Moderate carbonation, a little thin but has a nice firm feel. Very dry finish. Very drinkable APA. I like that it has almost zero sweetness, which I think makes it more thirst quenching and almost like an English Bitter with American ingredients."
"Drink- This was just okay for me. It was far behind others in class. Lack of balance and citrus or hops. Too one sided to fully enjoy"
"O: not my favorite APA, seems more like an IPA to me; almost offensively astringent at first, but a very well-balanced and desirable brew as the brew warms and the maltiness comes through; give me 2, maybe 3 at most, but I'd drink it again"
"Overall: Very drinkable beer. ""safe"" in a way with nothing memorable in either a good or bad way."
"I wouldn't order this out."
"o - Overall a pretty average pale ale. Not a lot going on in the nose, but not bad at all. Wouldn't seek it out again but worth trying once."
"O: I actually really enjoyed the beer. I was a very clean and crisp pale ale and while it wasn't complex it still tasted great and true to style. Nothing fancy, just good beer."
"O-This is one that is very easy to drink more than one of anytime."
"Get a six pack if you're bbq bound, it's good shit."
"Aroma is of caramel malt in the beginning followed by piney hops and hints of orange fruit. Medium, tangy body. Bready malt is balanced by earthy hops and citrus fruit on the palate. Long, peppery, dry finish. Not a bad brew for Flying Dog."
"O - Pretty good, nothing amazing.. pretty mild but well balanced and easy to drink."
"A decent pale ale, with a mild hop presence, a sweet malt backbone, and a bit of a dry finish. Not terribly complex, it is a serviceble, but forgettable PA."
"I have to admit, I work right down the road from Flying Dog’s brewery in Frederick, so I'm totally biased here – but with good reason. They do have exceptional offerings that hold up to some of the best crafted brews out there."
"Overall, this is an excellent, well-balanced pale ale that is, in fact, anything but pale; there is more flavor in one bottle than in an entire six-pack of Budweiser. It's easy to see why Doggie Style has won gold and silver medals at beer festivals."
"O- Decent beer, hoppy yet smooth but not nearly as good as pale ales of similar style"
"Overall, a quite drinkable beer. A simple beer, but a good one."
"Dr: A decent price, but relatively low ABV. Decent quality and moderate drinkability. It's sort of worth a try."
"O: this is a pretty run of the mill pale, nothing offensive about it but nothing that makes me want to drink more of it"
"O - Quite underwhelmed by this beer. Very little malt or hop flavor. The graininess of the malts combined with the one-dimensional hop bitterness left a lot to be desired. Will not have again."
"Nice taste to it as well, starting with a nice little hop bite and biscuity malt behind it. The bitterness is small but noteworthy, making this a very good example of the style. The floral hops shine nicely to make a very pleasant and easy drinking pale ale. The body is moderate and the carbonation level is the same, both qualities of high drinkability. Flying Dog is usually very consistent and this one fits the bill nicely."
"Overall, not a bad APA. I do appreciate the hops coming through as they did. I prefer my APAs hoppier vs maltier. I will probably have this again."
"Finally getting around to reviewing this guy. It pours a clear bronze topped by a finger or so of dirty white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, mandarin orange, light cantaloupe, and mild caramel. The taste holds notes of grapefruit peel, grass, orange rind, very light caramel, and a touch of musty wheat. The bitterness near the finish is a bit harsh, and the musty wheat that follows doesn't help matters much. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty wet feel. Overall, an okay pale ale, but too strong on the obtrusive bitterness for my liking."
"O - It's definitely an easy drinker, like most pale ales. Definitely a good everyday drinker that I would come back to again."
"D/O: Basically a forgettable contribution to the style, this pale ale apologizes at every opportunity with the hope that no one will find it unappealing--and cuts corners in the process. Hops could be described as ghost-like here, if only there were some actually haunting this beer. The most surprising thing about this beer is that it is allowed on the menu at Beachwood BBQ."
"D - This has good drinkability. I could easily drink a sixer of this. Overall, I thought that this was a very nice pale ale. It is a great beer to have on a hot summers day. I would buy this again."
"Definitely worth a try."
"One of the milder varieties on the APA spectrum (It isn't going to kick you in the throat with hops), but it still delivers. Crisp and balanced."
"Love the look and the style of this beer. Edgy and cool. Serious Gonzo styling like all Flying Dog stuff. On the nose - sweet hops, green grass, some apple peeking in. Flavourwise, there's a good dose of toasty malt which fades to that bitterness that american hops is famous for. Limes and orange peel fight all over the tongue. Only 5.5%, so fairly good as a sesh beer too. Stamps of approval all round..."
"This makes a good everyday beer!"
"I was anxious to get started, so my pour was pretty aggressive, resulting in just over a finger of dense, light-tan head with great retention. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose was simply filled with piney hops and I flashed back to last night when the young woman I was meeting stated that she would drink anything that was not too hoppy. People's awareness is astounding. This also had a nice amount of underlying malt sweetness, but I was ready for some hops. Mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant intermingling of piney hops and caramel sweetness in the mouth. It makes me wonder why I have not had Flying Dog beers in a while since I generally enjoy them. Finish was more bitter than sweet and I felt much better than I did after my previous beer today."
"Overall: A nicely balanced, slightly sweet pale ale. Slightly above average for the style. I could session this, but I could just as easily pass on it."
"D: Well made, a good example of a good beer."
"O: I pray to you, only drink this beer at a slightly chilled temperature. It is a magnificent example of the style."
"D- Not the best pale ale."
"O: A good pale ale, this is definitely one to introduce people to hoppy styles without overpowering them. Very sessionable."
"O - Good pale ale, I still think Sierra Nevada defines the style of APA. In fact, this seem more like an English Pale Ale with an American twist."
"Overall: A good example of a pale ale. Nothing extraordinary, nothing underordinary. Would very much like trying this one on tap."
"O: Not a beer I would say no to, but not one I'd pick up again in a hurry. It's got middle of the road flavor and texture with nothing popping out at me, and it feels heavy so it wouldn't necessarily make for a good session beer. There are better pale ales out there for the same price, to be sure."
"Nice beer--orange color, Cascade hoppy grapefruit/orange/apricot goodness in the nose. Pleasant flavor--as others have said, this is Cascade hops, pure and simple, with a little bit of malt and a nice, zesty body. Happy to drink it but probably wouldn't seek it out."
"Poured into glass, thin half finger head, amber in color, very little lacing. Aroma is all malts, some sweetness. Taste follows the nose, very malty hardly any hop profile. Drinks smooth, not awful, very easy drinking but I want more hops in my beer."
"Overall - Not a bad outing, I will be putting one of these off to the side for a buddy. Not sure if I would spend more than a few bucks for this at a bar, but I'm glad that it wasn't super expensive."
"O: this is simply put, a good beer. However being that its local and having a bit of a sentimental aspect, it was the first beer I bought regularly for parties and such, the ""Overall"" for this beer gets a bit of a boost."
"Finish: Light floral hops linger on the back of the palate"
"Overall an adequate Flying Dog, but go for the imperial series if you really want to get blown away."
"Light golden color, little head, but a few white bubbles poke around the glass. Aromas are simple and light, hop and grain. Flavor is very light and easy. Clean malt and one dimensional hop finish, very quaffable. Mouthfeel is light and nicely balanced. Good session brew."
"O: Too bad; I really wanted to love this stuff. Steadman's art is great, the names kill me - it all just seems like an in-your-face experience. Now it just seems like they're compensating for/trying to elevate a lackluster beer. Oh well, I'm still keeping my eye out for other interesting-looking offerings from these guys. Never give up hope!"
"O: Average, not bad at all, but nothing spectacular. Could easily put these down while relaxing, but with so many other options out there, I would probably pass."
"This is a fine Pale Ale but there are many that are much better. I had it on draft at Camden Yards and that scores some points for me. However it is a pretty standard micro pale ale. It's aroma is good but not great, it's not so cloudy golden color is like most in it's class. The taste is good and dependable and solid but not special. It is a little mild in the hops arena and doens't score real well for me in mouthfeel. Overall it is a good beer, yeah good."
"Bright amber color. Decent head. Smells of wet malt with a moderate hop profile. Flavor is nicely balanced but not all that exciting, which I guess is ok for a pale ale. Nice mouthfeel, smooth with a good level of carbonation. A solid pale, nothing to write home about."
"O/D - Not too shabby of a Pale Ale. Not overwhelming and doesn't really pop at you but it's a good, easy drinker with a flavour profile worthy of keeping me interested for more than one."
"O: Not bad, but not that far above average, either. With so many other great ones out there, it might be a while before I try this one again."
"Poorly poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is a transluscent dark amber with a good inch of slowly fading head. Decent lacing. Aroma is of hops, yeast, blades of grass, and some flowers. Mouthfeel is light. Taste is yeasty, but too much so. Slightly hoppy, somewhat floral. Not bad for a mix 12 pack beer."
"O: Found this to be a good example of an APA and sessionable. I see myself picking this up again with the limited selection of a local liquor store that has pick your own 6er."
"Carbonated with a light body, it certainly has a pale ale bite. Overall, it is a decently crafted beer. Not great, but not bad either. It could be refreshing in the right circumstance."
"Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, pretty much ideal for me"
"This is a well balanced and refreshing ale. No fuzz, just good."
"Poured a nice orange color with a decent white head. Aromas of sweet malt and some subtle hopping. On the palate, this one is fairly light bodied, with some hoppiness, some malt and just a hint of peaches."
"Overall: Nice easy drinking style without so mucha s a whimper of big flavor anywhere - Gateway Craft Beer."
"O - highly drinkable; very session-worthy; the label doesn't lead one astray - ""classic"" American pale ale, but still unique"
"A solid pale ale with nothing standing out. Drinkable and straight forward."
"D - certainly drinkable for a standard APA."
"O: Meh. Not my favorite beer, but I could drink it from time to time. For the style, it's good from what I can tell with my limited experience."
"I recommend this as a good ""lawnmowing"" beer. All credit to my friend the Beer Samurai coining the term ""lawnmowing"" beer."
"Poured an orange/amber color with a little bit of light beige head on it. Smells like some citrus hops - nice aroma. Taste was very good. Nice balance of malt and hops with a good bitter finish. Light to medium mouthfeel. This beer went down very smooth and was easy to drink. I really enjoyed this beer and will be picking it up again."
"Taste, A great hop fix. I am not the biggest fans of IPAs but this does the trick to give me the bitterness I am looking for."
"Solid pale ale, fairly standard overall."
"O: The bitterness became a touch abrasive after awhile which detracted from my enjoyment."
"O - Pretty decent hoppy beer, works well by itself or as a session drink."
"O - A solid brew somewhat reminiscent of a good IPA"
"A solid American Pale Ale with a lasting hop finish."
"D: Definite session beer, tasty but nothing over the top. Stays flavorful as it warms."
"Decent, but not up to yesterday's pale ale: a New Belgium Mighty Arrow"
"ive only had one or two american pale ales that id really ever drink again, compared to germany and austria american pale ales just seem watery and tasteless."
"D; Great, I will be drinking this again. 4"
"A nice beer with plenty of aroma and flavour. If you like aromatic hops then this is for you. The only downsides are that it lacks bite from the hops, and the body is more watery than it could be. Also not sure if it's really a pale ale - the colour is much more amber. However, these are minor flaws. Pick one up if you come across it."
"This is the only beer I've had from Flying Dog so far, but this solid. Very solid example of an APA, probably a good intro for those looking to get into the style."
"This beer is harsh, dry and somewhat bitter. Its definitely not the better beers from the Flying Dog arsenal. At best this is a mediocre Pale Ale. There are much better options out there. Even on tap, this one didn't deliver very well. I will be hard pressed to choose this one again. I was at a local restaurant with this one, Coors and Miller on draft so I figured to support the local brewery. Sorry I can promote this one further though."
"Not too shabby of a pale ale. Relatively low abv makes this easy to pound a few of."
"Aroma is quick again and clean. Light hops are totally balanced against a nice malty bill. Nice bread and grain notes, hints of lemon and pine and a clean refeshing taste. Light touch of corn like flavor in the finish before a quick dash of hops dries it out and gets in the last word."
"This is a wonderful, vibrant Pale Ale.. theres nothing classic about this. Its down right GONZO!"
"Drink is decent, light overall, bit of a sticky finish but dry, bitterness ramps and almost gets astringent but not quite."
"This is a solid pale ale, it's nothing flashy but still a good brew."
"D - For a while I was thinking of getting a case but it just wasn't as good as I remember but would consider getting it again. Aside from Gonzo and Double dog this really is a very nice pale ale."
"Classic Pale Ale is clear light brown/dark golden color with good head that dissipates quickly, decent lacing. A very malty taste with a bitter/hoppy after taste, but not very hoppy (has it's only 35 IBUs). Mouthfeel is a little rough, but still above what I would say is average. Definitely a very drinkable beer that I plan on having again...and again."
"Pours a clear copper color with little head. Aroma is hoppy and floral- very pleasant as if it were an IPA. Taste is very bitter with a bit of sweetness accompanied with maltiness. Fills the mouth up with flavor, but not enough sweetness or spicyness to balance out the bitterness for me. Goes down kind of rough. Decent beer."
"D: This one has an ok flavor profile, but its way to malty for my liking. I would not get this one again, and I don't think that I would recommend this one. Not bad, but not really worth the time to me."
"D: it was drinking good but was very light all around; decent pale ale."
"Pours a dark amber with a nice beige head. Aroma of citrusy piney hops, some fruity esters, and some malt. Taste is same aroma. Palate is medium body with good carbonation. Finish is dominated by citrus piney bitter hops with some dark sweet malts for balance. Overall a good drinkable pale ale."
"drinkable - yep."
"D - A very drinkable beer although the bitterness. I like it!!"
"Pours a rosy amber with thick head, lots of lacing, takes some time for this to recede. Smells of malts and raisin bread, maybe some caramel. Tastes very musty, even earthy. Has some characteristics of being in an oak barrel. A little smoky. Has a bit of a flat mouthfeel, bitter at the end. Drinkable? Go ahead, but this dog don't fly. (For me)"
"D -- Very solid brew, fit for the discerning craft drinker without being over the top for the would be."
"Pours a golden amber color with a thick white head and tons of lacing. Smells of piny hops and maybe some grapefruit. Tastes much the same. Some citrus, some hops, and maybe a little malts. I like it. Mouthfeel is medium with a little carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"The mouthfeel as previously stated is extremely smooth, it's perfectly carbonated and medium-bodied. This makes it a very drinkable pale. It's not the best pale ale ever, but it really has it's strengths - it's very easy-drinking and probably a very nice brew to keep on deck. I'd consider keeping six around when it gets warmer outside."
"Easy to put away a few too many. Besides the alcohol, this one would be an all nighter. Time to call a cab."
"A very unoffensive beer which bodes well for the novice craft beer drinker or one who is not seeking a lot of hops. Not bad, but I think there's better APA's out there."
"Refreshing, bubbly mouth feel and slightly less than medium, but not watery, on the palate. Highly drinkable. It would be easy to knock back 2 or 3 just about anytime."
"This was a pretty good pale ale, the flavor was perfectly balanced. I wouldn't mind having this again."
"D - Easy enough to drink and the flavors are interesting enough to bring me back for another."
"D- This is a pretty solid, balanced pale. Not one of my favorites but definitely something that should be tried."
"I did not expect the color or taste of this beer seeing that it was a pale ale. The taste was great, went down very smooth, was not that bitter, but ended with a bitter leftover taste. This tasted more like an IPA to me than a pale ale."
"The foam was white in color, bubbley and lacey til the end. It had a honey with pumpkin orange and gold highlights. It had a fruity and hoppy aroma with hints of wood and carmel. It had a deep robust hops taste with a citrus undertone. Mouthfeel - full-bodied with a light twist. Drinkability - being one of my favorite micro-brews, I love the full-bodied-ness and its great for the summer."
"Overall this beer is a 2 thumb up in my book! I thoroughly enjoyed drinking this beer. The smell was wonderfully balanced and the taste was hoppy but not overpowering. I'm not a fan of IPA's due to their bitterness but this APA is a perfect match for me. GREAT BEER FLYING DOG!!!"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its elegant appearance, its nicely balanced flavor, and its great name! The hops begin strong, but by the end of the glass tend to become less apparent, leaving you with a borderline mild brew for the style."
"Drink - Just an average IPA in my books, probably not something I'd seek out again."
"Drinkability: A good beer! The bitterness was not overwhelming but slowed down drinking enough for the beer to be savored. I enjoyed it very much."
"This beer pours a copper slightly lighter than the usual pale ale. The most striking feature of the beer is the hops on the nose. The smell is definitely floral and reminds me of summer grass. After the strong smell, I was a little surprised that the taste is dominated by a slightly sweet maltiness. It does finish dry thanks to the hops, which are relatively benign. Pretty easy drinking session beer."
"O: Good drinkability. Refreshing with a strong American Pale Ale character"
"D- Nice solid pale ale, would be very versatile to pair with food, and could be an enjoyable brew by itself."
"D: I like most of Flying Dog's other offerings, but I'm afraid they missed their mark with this one. The off smell combined with the lack of flavor (or in this case the flavors most important to beer: barley and hops) leave much to be desired. I'm kind of thinking I got a bad bottle at Central Market, it can't be this bad right?"
"D- Nice pale ale. Refreshing. I could enjoy this after a hot summer day mowing the grass."
"D. A nice pale ale from F.D. One that I would thoroughly recommend you try if you have yet to do so."
"d- very nice beer, i normally prefer to just go with an ipa because regular pa's taste like diluted ipa to me, but this beer is almost like an ipa if you ask me"
"drinkabilty was really good - even though if I were going for a true Pale Ale, this wouldn't be my choice . that being said I would recommend and purchase again ."
"D: The beer is rather refreshing and quite sessionable."
"This beer looks impressive. An amber tint for a pale ale is interesting, i like the fact that they used caramel 120 to achieve a nice color. They said they used cascade hops for dry hopping during fermentation. Which gives the beer a mellow hoppiness. Would have worked better in aging I think. Unless this is what they were going for. I feel they kind of held back on the hoppiness, even though this is not an ipa it would have been nice to get that awesome dry hop nose. Still a good pale ale!"
"Appearance has a golden brown with a one finger bubbly head that quickly fizzles away to no remnants. Smells mildly hoppy but nothing to sharp or fancy. The Taste is mild as well with no real lingering hop taste on the back of the tongue or on the taste buds, the hops wash away quickly as you swallow with a flavor of something sweet as it goes down. Mouthfeel is lighly carbonated with nothing very exciting in the way of flavor. Mildly put it is a mild tasting beer. Would recommend this to someone who is getting into craft beer drinking. Mild hops."
"D- could drink this one all night. very drinkable."
"This doesn't fill the craving for the genre; no hop flavor or aroma to write home about, no caramel sweetness to balance it out; simply blunt, harsh tones with a drab twang/bitterness."
"I like this pale ale, and a great way to end my variety pack on a good note...I would recommend this to the non pale ale drinkers to give this one a try, it might just convert them..."
"Overall, very surprised by Flying Dog on this beer, i've hated all of them but this is finally something theyve gotten right"
"D: Very enjoyable brew. Good example of an American Pale Ale. Goes good with food or by itself. A nice go-to brew. Well done."
"It pours a light and with almost no head, a burnt copper in color. The smell isn't very strong. It's very dry and has faint hops and malt aromas but is heavier on the hops. The taste mirrors the scents. It drinks dry and is mildly hoppy with slight sweetness. It's an alright pale ale, nothing special."
"The mouthfeel is nice. It is very drinkable. This is a nice beer to have on hand. I got it in a mixed 12, but I will defininetly buy more."
"D: It may not be all that complex or powerful on the palate, but this APA is effortlessly drinkable and a great beginner's beer for anyone that wants to try a hoppier beer. Highly enjoyable in my opinion."
"D: Incredibly drinkable brew. The hops really put an edge on this one."
"Pours a clear mid-range amber with a tall white head and lacing. Nose is of pine and marmalade, some lemon, lemon grass, honey and butter. The hops are grassy and mild, with a slight soapy edge. In the mouth it's fresh hops and soft malts; there's toffee sweetness which is balanced by a citric bitterness. Mouth feel is medium with a lively yet fine carbonation. Finishes with a sweet bitterness and green hops. It's refreshing and smooth, very drinkable."
"Overall this is a good example of the style and a pretty refreshing beer for hot summer day. Also flying dog has some kick ass labels and packaging."
"d-Oh yeah...this is going on the buy list. Got it as part of a mixer pack. Nice hoppy pale for when you aren't looking for a hop bomb."
"Medium body and effervescence. All hops in the aftertaste. Slightly watery as well. It's ok, I guess, but just ok."
"D - Good slightly malty pale ale, it's a pretty affordable option as well."
"There's nothing WRONG with this beer, but it's not to my tastes."
"D: Not bitter enough to be good in that way, and not balanced enough with the sweetness to be good in that way either. Not horrible, just average."
" ~ This is a good pale ale. I think the brewer has done a nice job of making this beer rather interesting."
"M & D - Crisp, refreshing , light bodied but flavorful. Good ABV content that allows for multiple consumption of good flavorful beer."
"D:Not a bad brew for the style, Very drinkable, sessionable, and for the most part enjoyable."
"Light bodied, well carbonated and an easy drinker. Nonetheless, there are numerous pales I would rather be drinking than this (that are both cheaper and easier to find...)"
"D: Tasty, but not overwhelming. Interesting and mild enough to encourage repeated enjoyment."
"D: At 5.5%, a good sessionable pale ale."
"Overall a solid beer."
"D- Very good, I could easily have a few more."
"D: nothing too complicated about this brew, but it has wonderful balance and great, fresh flavor. I would definitely drink this again."
"Pours medium amber with a slight dull orange hue and a head that is much more beige than I would have expected. The head is nice and fluffy, but leaves weak, broken lacing. The aroma is mild, and pleasantly fruity. I am getting some light citrus hop aroma, mostly bitter grapefruit, but it is fairly subdued. Malt is also evident in the nose and smells very bready and yeasty. Flavor is a bit perplexing. Citrusy cascade hops are the predominant character. I also notice that this beer carries a pretty hefty bitterness for style, but it is not too overbearing. The strange part is that there is grainy, astringent quality that is not very pleasant and really detracts from the other flavors in this beer. Malt is much less of a player than in the aroma, but what I do taste is fairly bready and non-descript. The mouthfeel seems to be smack dab in between light and medium and is fairly aggressive on the palate. Not much carbonation, but a dry bitter finish that lingers long after I swallow. This beer finishes a bit too sticky to be very drinkable. Not terrible, but not terribly great either. Definitely not a beer I would seek out on its own, but it doesn't ruin this sampler pack."
"Bottom line: it's a decent beer. I would definitely get it as part of a variety pack but would probably forgo it on its own in favor of my usual favorites if I were looking for just a pale ale. I certainly wouldn't turn it down if someone offered it to me."
"While it is refreshing, it doesn't have the same bite from the ingredients themselves that often makes a simple beer great."
"Good pour head which keeps a thin cover throughout the drink. Head lace clings well to the glass and hangs in there for quite a while. Good dark amber color around EBC 42 with a slight haziness, mostly from the wonderful carbonation bubbles. Bottle IBU: 35. I don't consider it quite that bitter, more around high twenties. Good refreshing hop flavor with a great lingering after taste. I would recommend this beer to those who like a bold refreshing taste, rich with flavor. Drinks well cold but I prefer the better bite as it warms to 50 degrees."
"Drinks pretty well. I'd buy this one in a sixer for sure."
"Pours a nice orange/ruby color with a thin head. It has a nice bitter ""bite"" to it but it's not overwhelming. Some citrus fruit with a hint of some darker fruit, maybe plum? Weird, I know. I couldn't defiantly drink a few of these over the course of a night."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. A good looking Pale Ale, golden/amber color with good clarity and some lacing. Smell is good, citrus/cascade hops. Even though it's the hos that dominate you can still detect some roasted malts in the smell too. The taste is good. You can taste the malts first followed by the aftertaste of the hops. Very good, classic American Pale Ale taste. Medium bodied with a bitter feel from the hops with a slight buttery feel, very drinkable though. Not really a whole lot to mention about this beer, classic American Pale ale taste, good for summer time. Well malted and good hope taste, well balanced. Good Pale ale and would be a good gateway beer for those getting into craft beer."
"This beer was poured into a plastic cup before I corrected the bartender, asking her for a glass. The beer was a dark red-orange color with a well-retained finger-depth head. The smell was hoppy and bready, like the taste. This one was more bitter than I like my pale ales, but to each his own. It had a strong carbonation and was not the beer I settled on."
"M/D: Very drinkable and smooth brew. Enjoyable pale ale. I find that while I still prefer IPAs, pales are growing on me with their simple yet complex flavors."
"The beer pours a deep burnt orange, or red orange. It's mostly clear, with a decent crown that falls halfway between off white and tan. The nose is of bready and caramel malts and a very nice blend of citrus and floral hops. As I sip the first thing I pick up on is the malty sweetness alluded to in the nose. A brief crack of bitterness hits next, before the hop flavor comes in to finish things off. I'm just a little let down that there's not as much citrus in the taste as there is in the nose. Carbonation is adequate, but the body is a little bit too thin for my taste. Doggie Style is fairly easy drinking, but not exceptionally so for the style. A fairly well executed American Pale Ale."
"D - Overall a very drinkable offering from FD, actually one of the better brews they put out. Perhaps a good gateway for a BMC drinker as it's not very intimidating."
"D- A good beer which seemed to be a little better when it was brewed in CO. Although, I haven't had it in that long so I just might be used to bigger beers. This beer is just average and a little better than that for the style."
"Overall this beer is rich yet light with a nice hop presence and balance. I very much enjoyed drinking it and the roasted caramel notes are nice, a bit different for a pale ale but it works well."
"D - A bit rough for an all-nighter, but 2 or 3 is great on a week night before bed."
"D: Would be great to have more often if it were not for the price. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a great standard for a micro pale ale."
"A solid pale. Definitely East Coast in nature with the balanced profile. I'd certainly drink again, but it would be pretty far down my list of priorities."
"D- I drink this all day. Overall this is a solid beer."
"Doggie style is another sold beer from Flying Dog."
"Good beer but not a favorite of mine and something I won't be getting again. However I am glad I was able to try it and definately want to try other offerings from Flying Dog."
"The feel of this beer is nice with a pretty even feel. This goes down well with a great drink-ability and makes for a great summer beer and one that would pair well with a good amount of BBQ."
"Pours a copper color with amber traces. Nice head. Nice retention. Great nose on this. Fresh piney hops are heavy and appealing. Initial taste is good with plenty of piney hop flavour and a decent caramel malt backbone for balance. It finishes very bitter for an APA however which hurt drinkability a bit. Decent ale overall but nothing extraordinary."
"D- Quite good. A pale I can session without getting burned out on hops madness."
"I usually hate pale beers, but I love this complex drink."
"I poured into a pint glass to a finger of off white head. It has a nice amber color. The smell is hoppy with some caramel malt. The initial taste was nice and hoppy for the style. I got some pine that gradually gave way to some citrus. The finish is clean. I don't get a whole lot in the way of malt. The mouthfeel is medium, slightly watery. This is an easy drinker. I notice that most of the pale ales go down rather quickly on my reviews. This is not better than Burning River, but it is a good beer."
"A very unbalanced APA, in my opinion. Sorty malty, sorta hoppy, sorta not enough of either one to impress. Moutfeel is very watery and thin. Do not really care for this, it's not even as good as the artificially colored Fosters Ale.Much better pale ales out there."
"Pours a nice hazy copper color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is mostly malty, with some hops, slight citrus. The taste is slightly sweet, bitter, malty, with some hops thrown in, citrus. Medium body. Drinkable, a not too bad brew, not what I was expecting."
"Here's my only hesitation...my label says '05. Today it's April 2010. This beer appears to be five years old. Maybe the hops just snuck away over the past five years...to be fair, I'll give it another chance with a fresh one."
"Poured into a bottle, light amber wheat color, great head, 2 finger creamy that stuck around the whole time. Smell earthy and hoppy, slight oils and citrus. Taste was some malt and mild grassy hops up front, going to an oily citrusy hop finish. Good beer, good session pale ale, somehow watery though."
"D - wonderful all around. could contend for one of my favorite APA's. excellent clean hop profile without dwindling smoothness and drinkability. well done."
"From the 355 ml. bottle marked 223FX10. Sampled on April 9, 2010. The pour is copper orange in tone with a quarter inch of silky beige head that lingers and never goes away completely. The Cascade and other hops arouse the senses right away as more of a teaser than an overwhelming zing. A little maltiness is noted as well as something kind of like orange zest.A decent hoppiness balances out the bitterness in the taste. A decent enough and drinkable pale ale."
"This beer is drinkable, but way down on the list...reach for something more complex and bold...unless you are looking for subtle."
"D: A pretty decent pale ale; above average. I wouldn't buy a six-pack, probably, but I certainly wouldn't turn a glass or two."
"Having on tap at a bar. This was a bad pour, the glass is effected by cleaning, the draft system is screwy or the beer is old. My glass was presented with no head or carbonation. A flat beer. I am familiar with this beer so I knowit is better that this presentation. That being said the color is right the flavors are spot on for an American pale ale. Toasty malt up front, with a dominant hop finish that is not too powerful, just enough that you know this is a craft brew. Forgive spelling errors, reviewed from iPhone. Desperate for the BA app."
"Pours a hazy amberish orange color, disapointing head and retention. Smell is of carmel malts and faint citrus and piney hops, not much going on. Taste is mostly carmel maltss, hops charachter is mostly bitter, lacking any nice citrus or pine notes expected from the style. Comes across more as an Enligh Bitter than an APA. Slight twangy taste to it. Undercarbonated, medium bodied, slightly oily. Disapointing beer which lacks the brightness and nice hop charachter ive come to expect out of an APA."
"Drinkability- This is very drinkable. Not the best representation of the style but still very decent."
"This was ok, I've had many a pale ale and this one ranked pretty average for me, taste was actually a little too strong with not much else going on, not alot of complexity, just that strong hop flavor but tasted too sharp and bitter for my taste. Poured a good color, typical for pale ales, don't think I would order this again, not a bad beer just not my bag. Average at best."
"Pours a clear, golden amber with a fluffy, white foam head. Smell is malty with a big citrus tip. First taste is almost dark fruit-like, with a smooth finish that twists into sweet bitterness and many a pleasant, high hops to cap it off. Decent complexity on the taste. Lighter feel. Lace all the way down the glass. A solid pale ale."
"D-easy drinking and light. Good balanced pale ale that brings everything I want to see. Definitely a very good beer to relax over and would be nice on a warmer spring day"
"Wouldn't seek this beer out again, but if it was around would drink it."
"A pretty aggressive poured yielded about three fingers of fluffy off-white head over a fairly dark amber/orange brew. Lots of grapefruit in the aroma as well as a pretty large amount of brown sugar sweetness from the malts. While pine doesn't make an appearance in the smell department, it shows itself in the taste. There's a bit of orange before transitioning to a slightly bitter grapefruit finish. There's also a slightly grassy note here and there along with a sweet doughy malt presence. The malt might be just a tad strong for me. It's pretty decent, but I prefer Flying Dog's bigger beers."
"This is my first time trying anything from Flying Dog so I was not sure what to expect. This brew poured to a golden color with a slight amber appearance. Had a fair sized off white head that had good retention and left a fair amount of lacing. There is a clear hop aroma here, it is pretty nice but to me it does not stand out. Hops have a somewhat citrus smell and there is a pretty good malt aroma. The malts seem to give a caramel flavor from the Crystal, that is what comes to mind at first and then the middle seems to be more about a citrus hop flavor. Late flavors seem to have the hops but the malts seem to catch up. Overall this is a fine brew, seems to me that there are better APA's readily available but if someone gave one to me I would not pass on it."
"Poured to a nice two fingered head that was offwhite in color. Brew itself was a brownish gold in color. Lacing was okay. Was actually very light smelling. Just of some hops and malt. Again kind of light. Tasted light also. Had that pine taste going on. Also of bitter hops and malt. Again very light. Felt thin in the mouth. Carbonation was right. This really wouldnt be my pale ale of choice. I dont think I would drink these as a session beer."
"Overall, this is ok, nothing special."
"This beer starts sweetly malt, bitterness comes with carbonation and dissipates . The beer finishes bitter but very light. This is a great pale ale. I found this to be more refreshing then most east coast pales, slightly less malt and a little more citrus hoppyness."
"A nice APA."
"Pours golden orange with a white head. The aroma is mainly hops with some earthy and resiny hops. The flavor is earthy and resiny hops with low-medium bitterness. The overall flavor is somewhat dirty due to the hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: Terrific APA, I found this to be very refreshing and sessionable. This is definitely one I will remember and plan on making a go-to."
"Taste is more bready malts and great hop flavors...citrus, pine, grapefruit..but nevery too astringent in mouthfeel. very crisp, delicious, and highly drinkable. a solid pale ale."
"Light body, lots of crisp, lively carbonation along with pleasant hop bitterness. This might be my new go-to pale ale dinner beer; I love the peppery hop profile."
"i was really in the mood for this one."
"Notes: Not a brew to get out of your way for but a nice one to have around."
"Pours a clear dark amber color body, with a big frothy off-white head, diminishing. Strong aroma of hops, citrus, some dustiness. Some malty sweetness, but not much, mostly pine, citrus. Citrus, pine in the taste. Some breadiness, biscuit. Slightly sweet, but very tempered by the hops. A slight bitter after taste. Tasty. Very good pale ale."
"Buy Again? No"
"This one pours a medium yellow with a half inch white head. Smells of yeast and a little bit of hops. Tastes of yeast and a little bit of hops. Yeast pretty much dominates everything. It's a good yeast flavor, but it's out of balance. Very drinkable, and I enjoyed it, but it's out of balance for a pale ale."
"it even has a leg up on sierra nevada in my opinion!"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a brownish/orange color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of hops, not much else going on. Taste is a bit on the hoppy side, some malts are present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Bleh, not my kind of pale ale, can't savor any mouthfeel, not drinkable when so many other superior choices for this style."
"A brewery can't just go around calling its beers ""classic"" without ample justification. That chaps my hide."
"I am definitely not a hophead but I am willing to give IPAs and Pale Ales a chance. Aroma is purely of hops with a bit of alcohol. Smells like heather flowers more so. The hops flavor was a bit too much for me, rather strong. Unfortunately this was a drain pour. But it is still decent, and one of the better examples I have had."
"Overall, a pretty basic American Pale Ale that fits somewhere between typical east- and west-coast interpretations of the style."
"M/ D - Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but okay APA. Has a touch of spice in the finish that almost tastes of an Amber Ale."
"B+"
"Clear copper pour with a quickly fading head and minimal lacing. Nice caramel, perfumy nose with a hint of pepper. Nicely balanced with a solid caramel base offset by a subtle hoppy bitterness. Nice slightly chewy mothfeel. Highly drinkable, quality pale ale."
"Overall this is a solid but not spectacular brew. Easy to drink and goes well with just about anything."
"Overall better than what I've come to expect from Flying Dog. Their beers seem to be mostly hit or miss but this one is pretty good."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a golden amber color with a small, quickly diminishing frothy off-white head, a hint of lacing. Aroma is sweet malts, bread, a hint of metal, and citrus hops. Flavor is caramel malts, straw, pine and citrus hops. Mouthfeel is dry with a hint of bitterness, on the lighter side of medium bodied. Decent beer, drinkable."
"Body seemed a bit light, and the feel was somewhat watery, but slick with a dry finish. This one wasn't bad, but it wasn't special."
"D: Goes down easy and is very enjoyable. Above average APA but to say it was unique would be an overstatement. Could be a great session beer..."
"A clear orange-amber colour fills the glass with a decent looking head that leaves an acceptable amount of lace. Smells of hops and flowers (which i guess is redundant), but not very strongly. The smell is not bad, but it is severely lacking, which hurts it. The taste is completely mediocre. Inoffensive hoppy taste that isn't bad, but does absolutely nothing for me. Medium body that goes down well picks me up a little bit, but overall this a decidedly average beer. I have no desire to have another, and am sad to say that after many great beers by Flying dog, the Doggie Style classic pale ale was a severe disappointment"
"D : Tasty and refreshing. With an easy ABV, you could be at it for an entire day's game."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable, but again, not what I was looking for or expecting. I could see this being a good session beer as it's strong enough to satisfy, but weak enough to not be filling."
"Color is a beautiful reddish copper with a respectable foamy white head. The crisp, mossy, herbal aroma almost reminds me of a European pilsner. The primarily pine hop bitterness is fairly well-balanced against a mild honey malt sweetness, but the flavors are are a bit muddled and the bitterness in the aftertaste isn't as pleasant as it should be. Medium bodied and easy-to-drink, making this a solid but unremarkable pale ale."
"It is a satisfying drink. It is not hopped to the point where you have to slowly sip it, but it is not too light. If you're craving the taste of hops but don't want to drink a strong ale then I would recommend this beer."
"Overall, I think it's certainly worth a try. Not a particularly standout brew but since I've been in Europe, I haven't had an American pale ale in awhile, so this has been pretty refreshing."
"This wasn't the worst beer I've ever had, but isn't something I'd like to try again."
"Drinkability is solid, this is definitely one that I could see having a few of. The only reason I couldn't really see having this one around all the time is due to the fact that Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale tends to be cheaper, more available, and just a hair more enjoyable in my book. However, this is a good option for when I want to switch things up."
"Drink is decent although I do think most could have more this is not my cup'o tea."
"Mildly hoppy, cleanly sweet, Doggie Style is an ok pale ale but fairly bland. The beer pours a medium rust with a fluffy white head that leaves lots of lacing down the side of the glass. It's on the dark side for a pale ale, but it's mostly an appearance issue; no strong specialty malt flavors come through in the flavor. The aroma is balanced with lightly citric hops, a touch of caramel and malty sweetness. Flavor is similar. It's not bad. There just isn't enough going on for me. For whatever reason, I consider this beer very middle of the road. The feel is a bit light on carbonation but fine."
"This is an above average brewery that also has you guessing what style of beer any given brand is. Most of their beers are very good and they just introduced a double ipa. This beer, the Doggie Style has very good color, great carbonation, good flavor and very drinkable. Always a good beer that everyone will like."
"Drinkability: A decent beer, not the biggest fan of APAs but this is very drinkable. Just enough sweetness in the malts the balance out the hops, making it an enjoyable beer."
"Poured a dark amber with a moderate head that quickly faded to a collar. The aroma was citrus, not a lot going on there. The taste was also citrus, just a little bland or maybe average describes it better. The feel was light bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a beer destined to be damned with faint praise...just ordinary, nothing special."
"Drinkability: A standard pale ale. Nothing exciting and easily substitutable with other pale ales."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, but it just doesn't stand out. For a regular BA, this would act well as a session beer or a ""party"" beer, but nothing that will get someone too excited. Another beer from Flying Dog that would be good for beer noobs. I'd drink it again, but this is not outstanding."
"D: Flavorful and very easy to drink. As sessionable an APA as youi'll find."
"This was a solid all-round pale ale. Had a good, hoppy nose while the flavor was a solid hop-malt combo and didn't have a strong bitter aftertaste at all. The mouthfeel was a solid body. This was a delicious pale and was very drinkable. Had mine with tacos and it was a great combo!"
"I want to blame the bar, but they're normally good with their taps. I'll give it a second chance when possible, but for now, this stands."
"Pours a nice mid-copper color with some very nice head and decent lacing. Has a great citrus hop scent; fills the nose, but still with a bit of malty thickness to it. Great taste, a wonderfully bitter beer without being too much; as bitter as possible while still being a very quaffable, near session ale. Flying Dog makes some wonderful pale ales."
"Poured a nice copper/orange, with a nice thick head, but it didn't last. The aroma was primarily grapefruit, lemon, and apricot, with a subtle clove hint. The taste yielded all aforementioned citrus and spice flavors fairly prominently, which dissolved into a bitter hoppy finish, and unfortunately a somewhat dry-bitter aftertaste. Nice and medium-bodied, with not much in the way of carbonation, but again the dry aftertaste was a little annoying. At least the dryness keeps you gulping, and after a few pints, you realize that it's a pretty good session beer."
"I liked the Hunter S. Thompson association as well - he was an uneven writer but at his best (as in Hell's Angels) he's one of the greats."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable APA. I like that it has almost zero sweetness, which I think makes it more thirst quenching and almost like an English Bitter with American ingredients. Great everyday brew and one of my favorite APAs."
"smells basic, a lightly blended mix of hops and fruits. a bit of grapefuit and orange. flavor was sub par. did not enjoy it. no where near as much hops as they made it out to be, and it just wasn't that good. light body with high amounts of carbonation like most flying dogs seem to be"
"Bro approved."
"Mouthfeel was thin and there was none of the body I have come to associate with a Pale Ale."
"Not a bad beer.... not up my alley but a very good brew."
"d- this is a great ale, by itself: you'll want more than one, and would pair well with grilled food"
"I've stayed away from flying dog beers but this was really enjoyable. I'll try this on again sometime."
"Good work Flying Dog."
"D- Really nice flavored APA with enough of a hop kick to keep me satisfied."
"Transparent dark orange amber color. Good creamy white head that fades fast. Smells hoppy and tastes malty. Malty up front then a pleasant punch of hops followed by the bitter bite of hops but the malt comes through in the end. One of Flying Dogs better brews from what I have tasted."
"Cheers!"
"I view this as one of the standards for Pale Ale. Flying Dog has struck an excellent ballance between taste and drinkability. Along with the Old Scratch Lager and Snake Dog, this is in my view one of the top beers is the 12 pack selection. The flavor is neither too bitter or too sweet which allows for the nice smooth taste."
"(D)- A solid pale ale that has everything it should. Simple and straightforward; balanced. An all-around solid beer to enjoy"
"Pours a clear organish color with a white one finger head. Head stays for a little. Smell is of hops and not a lot of other smells. Not the complexity of fruit. Taste is mild of hops not overwhelming with a little malt to balance. The mouthfeel is good. There is not a lot of over the top carbonation. The beer is very drinkable and well balanced."
"D - Very tasty and refreshing qualities make it a killer session beer that's not strong enough to get offensive but not weak enough to be mistaken for water."
"Clear, orange amber with a patchy eggshell head that quickly recedes into a skim of foam and leaves a little lace behind. The nose is minimal, piney hops and toasted grain. A pretty typical entry level APA, mild cascade hops and just enough malt to balance the flavors. Smooth, medium light bodied and easy to drink. A good session APA I suppose."
"Poured amber / orange color with a nice creamy 1/2 inch head, smells malty and hoppy; lacing didn't last as this beer went down quick. Smooth with medium carbonation and good hop flavor that mixes malt and caramel with a grassy finish; very well balanced and easy to drink; had a few ice cold and thought it was a great beer!"
"d- totally drinkable, i'd buy again, very well balanced, i could definately session this dog."
"I would rate the drinkability as good, its not a bad pale ale. I think it would be a good session pale ale."
"Drinkability: Drink with a meal; doesn't hold up as a stand alone; it's an average pale ale"
"Pours a nice copper color with an awesome foamy head. Laced down the entire glass and really impressed me. Not a huge fan of the Pale Ale style but this one was pretty good. Citrusy notes are the big thing I picked up on. Aftertaste of malt is also apparent. Well balanced in my opinion but as I said before just not my style."
"Indeed, this is the classic APA. Copper color, a fruity nose with a mild hop scent, a taste of hop flowers, mixed fruits, a pinch a caramel, a good all-around balance, and a clean finish. All this makes an easy drinking brew with enough flavor to make you want another one."
"Drinkability: This is a reasonably drinkable APA that I could consume all evening. While it is not better than some of the others I've had it would be a fine choice if it is the only APA on offer."
"D- enjoyable but I'm not rushing for another one."
"Overall, a decent but uninspiring pale ale."
"Mouth: carbonation is high, as expected from the burst. This brew is crisp and refreshing. A little sour, but I'm having trouble identifying the origin of the sourness. Bitterness is well present for a pale ale witch is a plus. Hops are citrusy and little piny. Aftertaste is pleasant. Solid malt."
"D= not that good. This is the first flying dog that let me down. Just not interesting. Boring beer."
"Overall, better than some Flying Dog's, but not as good as many."
"D: This isn't my favorite pale ale. I would much rather go a different route next time when I feel like enjoying this type of brew. I have to admit that I am not disappointed with it since I am enjoying it."
"Overall, it's my least favorite Flying Dog so far"
"Doggie Style Classic Pale Ale from Flying Dog Brewery pours a nice dark amber color. Not a big head on this pour. Not much smell here at all. The taste is a little better than the smell. I can detect a little malt and hops on the tongue. Keyword here is little. It's a pale ale by definition, but there's nothing that stands out in this beer. Sure it's drinkable and better than most macros. All in all I would have to say ...yawn."
"The crispness and dryness makes this a potentially refreshing brew. Personally I look for a lot more malt flavour to my beers. Seemed a little out of balance to me."
"Nice amber color. Got a strong hop smell along with pine and citrus. I found this to be very crisp and refreshing. While not overly complex, the flavor is solid and works well with food. Nicely carbonated and easy to drink. This is a good beer to keep on hand while you are grilling."

"Good pale, I would seek it out again."
"Drinkability- Crisp and refreshing. A good summer brew."
"This is the third different APA in a row that I've tried after Alpha King and SNPA and I feel like I'm still trying to come to grips with this style. The hops here have a good interplay with the cleaner, sweeter malt background.  However, as a direct comparison, I think Alpha King just does everything better, and by a considerable margin.  Flying Dog's offering is pleasant, but not necessarily awe-inspiring."
"This is a simple, yet great Pale Ale. Good flavor, nice balance, and great drinkability."
"I got a case of this and I probably wouldn't be in a hurry to get it again. It was reasonably priced at less than $30 a case, but in the past few months, I have been getting other Pale Ales that I enjoyed more. I just felt like this one left me hanging a little bit."
"This is another beer I could drink all night just for the flavor. I have to hand it to Flying Dog for creating a whole list of exceptional beers, and this one is a good starter for anyone. Great flavor with a light hoppy taste, not too heavy and the bottle looks awesome!"
"Overall this is a lackluster version of the american pale ale, I can think of four or five better ones off the top of my head, it just isn't different enough from other beers to warrant buying this again. Not something that I hate to see in my fridge, just wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"D: this to me is just okay. I would have liked to see a little more balance out of a pale ale, but then again its doggie style so they can do whatever they want. All and all not bad, it just comes off like a really weak IPA rather than and good pale ale!"
"Cheers!"
"I feel like I could drink this beer all nite. This American pale ale is very true to the style and overall an excellent beer. The taste is delicious and it's extremely drinkable. Comparing it to an Serra Nevada I say its less hoppy but more drinkable. It's brewed local to me and I'll guarantee it will become a new favorite."
"Wow.... I'd love to find something nice to say about this but I just can't. It's watery and lacks any real body, flavor or aroma. It has an odd aftertaste similar to the Golden Ale. I can't put my finger on it but it isn't good. I noticed the same ""funk"" with Molson beers. Yikes, avoid at all cost."
"one of the nicest bottled pale ales I've had. pours a lovely orange-ish clear colour with a manageable frothy head that subsides within a decent amount of time. Orange in the nose, medium carbonation in the mouth, balanced bitter taste with a sharper, more bitter aftertaste that mellows over an agreeably long time."
"This beer pours a rich copper color with a wispy foam head or what one might call lacing after it settles. There are some mild hop notes on the nose. The flavor is what I would crisp with prevalent hops flavors. The flavor seems to linger in the mouth for a while and then dries up as it fades into what becomes the aftertaste. A nice beer on a warm day, but not one that I am going to call all my friends and family to alert them to it."
"If you like a pure, earthy citrus hops flavor, then this uncomplicated but pure brew is worth a try. A good brew in my estimation."
"first time having a flyingdog and its pretty good.. pours to a medium golden amber with a inch head with some lacing but nothing crazy. hops up front aroma with some citrus and malt coming in. i'll say i can definitely drink this one again its got a good after taste and is a tasty american pale ale.."
"Overall, this beer is a pretty good example of the style, good all around, worth a buy."
"The refreshing, light flavor and ABV make this one a good quaffer, especially in the warmer months to come."
"Nice easy beer; solid but nothing too special."
"D. Overall I liked the fair amount of hoppiness, balanced by the malt and cirtus taste. I would buy this beer again."
"D- Really refreshing, one of those beers you want to have after a hot day out of the sun."
"D - This is a decent, modest American pale ale. While perhaps not my favorite, it's everything I expect from the style and a well done beer."
"12 oz. bottle Pours a very nice amber orange with a good one inch off white head. The head fades after a couple of minutes leaving behind nice lacing. Heavy hops in the nose with both pine and floral notes. A little citrus in there too. It has a certain raw greenness to it that I can't quite place. Medium carbonation with a rich mouthfeel for a pale ale. Malt flavor is a little biscuity. Hops have a grassy taste. Overall this one is pretty middle of the road for a American pale ale."
"This is going to the drain, its borderline sour."
"This beer pours a clear golden brown colour, with a few fingers of puffy, creamy white head, that leave minor lacing. It smells of citrus hops, and a little bit of caramel malt. The taste is pine and citrus hops, with a decent sweet malt body. The carbonation is a bit on the high side, the body could have some more heft, but it finishes with a nice flourish of malt and tangy hops. A decent American pale ale, worthy of a session."
"Not bad for an APA, very drinkable. Sort of bitter malty. The beer is orange in color. Taste is really bitter with a malt finish. Mothfeel was medium. Overall its pretty good for a session beer definitely a good one to start the night off with. Hard to be to critical of the apa style as I'm not a big fan of it."
"Flying Dog's Pale Ale is more like a Bass should be - simple, civilized and drinkable. It's the a golden color and perfectly clear. A very respectable beer that you could offer to anybody - even someone used to lesser (crappy American) beer."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0902-TimL"
"Overall: A very nice APA, I usually am not a huge fan of the style but this was almost borderline IPA I thought. Highly drinkable and enjoyable."
"Drinkability: All in all, this isn't a Double Dog by any means, but an excellent, more logical offering for any hop lover. It features all the elements to make it a classic APA in my book. Very sessionable and very refreshing. A must have."
"(D) A great beer for the summer days."
"d-due to it's mellowness, it is quite the quaffable pale. it is what it says it is. since i have 3 more to go through, it'll be interesting to see if it stays consistent. and major deviance, i will return!"
"D- Overall, it's not bad, but not great. You could easily have several of these without really suffering due to lack of taste. However, it's just missing something, which keeps it from being a great ale."
"Pours clear copper with a disappointing head and no lacing. Light biscuity aroma. Flavor is thin, with a slight toasty character and light floral hop character. The mouthfeel is thin and rather disappointing."
"Pours a a bit darker than i would expect for an APA. not much head, and almost no lacing. Smells of roasted malt with very little hop nose. Tastes similar, but the hops do come through on the finish, but not strongly. This is a bit overbalanced on the malt side, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. Good mouthfeel and extremely drinkable. Would make an excellent session beer."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a dark amber/reddish color with very little head with a fairly vigorous pour. Smell is very much like caramel and roasted nuts. Taste is very toasty and malty with almost no sign of hops. Fairly thick mouthfeel that coats the entire mouth. Decent drinkability, not outstanding but you could drink a few of these before you even know it. Overall a fairly disappointing pale ale. Not necessarily bad by style definition but I've come to expect more from Flying Dog and think more balance shouldn't be too much to ask for. Not really bad but there are many better pale ales out there."
"Pours a rich, clear amber/orange with a thin tan head and little lacing. Absolutely beautiful. Smells strongly of hops and roasted barley, nice and crisp with a little citrus in it. On the first taste the grain fills the mouth and is quickly followed by a burst of citrusy hops and then a quick and clean finish. On the medium body side for a pale ale, and all-around just a delicious treat. Very classic example of the style."
"Overall a really good American style pale ale. This one is kinda par for the course."
"Notes: i dont know, i think it might be better with just a little more bitterness. just a little. but this is a great easy drinking pale"
"This is a good brew that would be nice to keep around for when I'm in the mood for a pale ale."
"Overall a very solid Pale Ale. Not my favorite, but still very, very good."
"An easy drinker, this is one I could see myself having 2 or 3 of in a sitting. This is actually probably the only standard offering from Flying Dog that I might want to have more of."
"Taste has a bit of hop and maybe a slight citrus. Mouthfeel is very thin and watery. This is not a terrible beer, but not worth seeking out again."
"The doggie Style Classic Pale Ale presented a dark, golden appearance. The aroma was fruity with a hint of grassiness and the taste was very tangy to me. It was, however, light and smooth. This seems like a very good summer beer served cold on a hot day."
"I think this would be a good transition beer for someone who prefers a Bass Ale, and is looking to broaden their horizons into the world of craft beer. An all around good entry level beer from a pretty reliable brewery."
"D: This one goes down easy enough, a good session beer, nothing really stands out in my mind, but still flavorful. Okay, but nothing terribly exciting."
"Drinkability: Similar to the last brew I tried (the Brooklyn Pennant), this one's a straightforward, inoffensive, not-too-terribly flavorful pale ale. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just not terribly impressive or bold. The alcohol's right though, and at Mellow Mushroom the price is always right, so I don't regret buying it at all."
"Light orange to amber color with a strong storm of bubbles, the thin head rapidly dissolves. Orange citrus, more hoppy than malty nose, somewhat on the bready side, while crisp feel in the nostrils not that much going on scent-wise. Medium-bodied, same general profile as in the nose, more bitterness favors the presence of hops. Orange citrus, touch of cocoa powder, slight roast to it. Most of the carbonation dissolves before you swallow. Clean finish but it would be hard not to finish cleanly with the lack of flavor depth."
"After working my why through their sample pack I am interested in trying their big beer line, but their 'normal' offerings are rather disappointing."
"Tasted this with side by side with several other APAs and this one was in the middle of the line-up preference-wise."
"I didn't find it as hoppy as most other plae ales in the same price point, so I was a little disappointed when I first tried it. On the plus side, it is easy to drink and the overall characteristics of the beer lend themselves to it being a safe choice when necessary."
"this beer is what you would expect from a descent pale ale. it has a good head with traces of lacing, the smell and the taste give you hops and touches of pine and citrus. mouthfeel is even and drikbability is high. a safe and solid choice for a pale ale."
"Overall, this is a good beer for drinking. I like the hop dominance."
"Golden amber in color, short-lived carbonation. Slightly laced, quickly fading head. Mostly yeasty, slightly hoppy, slightly malty flavor and smell. Not a wonderful beer, but solid and fairly pleasant. I wouldn't feel bad about buying a 12 pack for a party, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"This was my first experience with Flying Dog. Love the name and their logo, and while the beer was ""good," it just wasn't great."
"Taste revelas a nice balance between lightly toasted malts and some aggressive citrus/piney hops. Finishes smooth, moderately bitter and crisp."
"Decent atmosphere, and good flavor make this worth the drink. I rather enjoyed this, as I'm honestly not a big fan of the style, and was pleasantly surprised. Good drinkability, good overall quaff."
"Not sure why this beer was made different, but the hops really break through this beer. It had a strong bitter taste to it for a pale ale. I was very surprised because typically the pale ale is a little less hoppy. Don't get me wrong though, the taste was really good. The beer was medium body and light on the tongue. Very impressive. This brewery has nothing but good solid offerings in its line up and this beer lives up to that standard."
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"Pours very dark amber. Nice, hoppy, fruity aroma. Good balance of malt and hops, some citric fruit in there also. Quality pale ale that doesn't quite measure up to the top tier beers of the same style. Very good, but I'll stick with Sierra Nevada and Stone."
"D - The bitter taste doesn't impede the drinkablity all that much. It is quite pleasant and a treat to have any time. Definitely will buy again and recommend to my friends."
"D - A sixer I wouldn't mind taking to a party with first time introductions to Flying Dog in mind. Probably a little strong on the hops for those of us not tuned to what real beer tastes like, but a great intro to the diverse flavors of good beer."
"A light amber pour,with a bubbly white head. Aroma of floral hops and faint citrus notes,maybe some sweet malt notes.Flavor of hops up front citrus and floral,with some caramel malt for balance.Thin body,with a nice crisp finish,and hoppy aftertaste. A pretty good PA."
"Drinkability: Despite having a ""shit load"" of hops, this beer is not so bitter that it impedes drinkability. In fact, this is a very easy to drink beer, providing you don't completely, totally hate hops."
"D - Good on a hot day, could throw back a few"
"A bit thin."
"Verdict: With true-to-style aroma, flavors, and mouthfeel, Doggie Style is a fine example of American Pale Ale. And if you happen to love Cascade hops (like I do), you're in for a real treat."
"All around well balanced and delicious i wish this was my everyday drink"
"D-Pretty good. Average pale ale"
"D-Good drinkability. An enjoyable and good-quality brew. First tried this one almost 6 years ago during a trip to Steamboat, and was glad when it started being distributed in MN awhile back."
"D- the websites claim to using 'shit loads of cascade hops' had me expecting something more, but the bottle's claim to balance was right on, only the malt isn't all that flavorful, and left me desiring something more than plain toasted grains."
"this beer pours a orangish light amber color with an off white head that fades to a thin film, with nice lacing on the glass. the aroma presents a decent amount of pine, with just a hint of malt, the taste has a nice bit of sweet maltiness, and a bit of hop bitterness at the end. the mouthfeel and carbonation make this an easy drink."
"Very tasty and easy to drink APA."
"D: Was nicely hopped for a pale and definitely good to throw back a couple. session material."
"Out of the bottle this beer was a dark amber color almost like a garnet with a tan head one finger thick. The retention was average and it left sticky lacing down me glass. The aroma was nice, pale malt and floral Cascade hops with some hints of grapefruit sweetness. The flavors were hoppy and a little bitter at first but this was soon answered by a balancing malt. The mouthfeel was good though the carbonation just a touch on the prickly side and the finish is a little oily. It's a well balanced beer however and though it lacks complexity it is quite sessionable as an APA should be- worthy."
"12 fl. oz. bottle, bought at the GBBF 2008 for takeaway. ABV is 5.5%, IBU 35. Deep amber to orange colour, decent off-white head with an orangey hue. Very nice aroma of Cascade hops, notes of citrus and honey. The flavour is also dominated by Cascade hops, but there is a sufficient malty base to balance the hops. Moderately bitter aftertaste. American Pale Ale is an underrated style IMO, this is an example. Great balance is more interesting for me than ""hop monsters"". Good beer!"
"They're definitely doing some things right here but until they do something about that finish and mouthfeel, I say pass."
"Thanks to CurtDoggYo! for the tasting sponsorship during our brew session!"
"Overall: Probably wont buy again, not impressed. It fills the ""MAKE THE MAJORITY HAPPY"" beer category easily."
"nc beer monger"
"The beer pours a dark orange/copper color with an inch of off-white head. Aroma is exclusively citrus and piney hops. Medium bodied on the palate. The flavor is mainly from the Cascade hops, pine and citrus. A light sweet malt rises in the center and provides some balance. Overall this is a middle of the road pale ale. The flavor is bit thin, but definitely not watery. A session ale indeed."
"Not a bad pale ale overall, just unremarkable."
"A pretty good version of an APA. I had heard it was pretty hopped up. Not sure I agree with that, but I like it"
"All said and done this was enjoyable beer, not a world class one but a decent option"
"A damn good pale ale right here. By far the best one of the mixed pack I got from this brewery and one of the better Pale Ale's I've had. A nice little hop aroma and taste and super drinkable which is just what I'm looking for in a pale ale. Good job with this one flying dog."
"Nice amber color with a tan colored head that raises to about 3 fingers before receding into a decent looking cap. Lacing is there a nice looking. Piney, citric aromas, backed up by a nice helping of caramel malts. Flavor profile is right on with the nose. Nice bitterness, plenty of pine flavor, lots of caramel malt, slightly citric, slightly sweet, but dry on the finish. Plenty creamy on the tongue, not much carbonation. Easily drinkable. A fine APA, but there are plenty more out there who do it for me than this one."
"Pours a three-fingered white head that slowly fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Flavor is typical pale, hints of caramel mellowing to bitterness at finish. $1.67 for a 12 oz bottle from Capital Convenience (now Barb's Beer Emporium) Concord, NH."
"Not a huge Flying Dog fan in general, but this is s fine APA example. Will gladly have again."
"D- Superb drinkablility due to light characteristics. Only 13 Plato's and 146 calories"
"Still, I would recommend it on a hot day - or for the game."
"3	D not even close to an ideal APA, but could be decent summertime beer. should try comparing this head to head with acme."
"Drinkability: Average beer. Would drink again."
"Overall an above average beer in my opinion.. if you can get it take it."
"D- A very drinkable beer and a good session beer. I would like to give it a higher rating because I really like it, but it just doesn't seem like the best representation of the style, so a slight knock there on the score."
"Pretty good Pale Ale. This one pours a copper, amber tinted color with a nice amount of head and lacing on the glass. Sweet hoppy aroma. Floral hoppy flavor, dry, with a nice little sweet malt taste in there. Perhaps could use a little more punch but it's a decent session brew."
"D: A solid pale ale, middle of the road for the style. Not something to seek out, but drinkable in a pinch."
"4 M&3.5 D: very smooth, slightly too smooth actually... this is a medium-bodied APA, balanced, approachable, suitable for a beginner dare I say... as it lacks that ""sparkle and zest"" to open up one's eyes and tastebuds."
"Drinkability: I could drink a lot of this beer fast. I also wouldn't hesitate to pick it up again if I hadn't had it in a while or was going to a party and didn't want something too heavy."
"Pours a brownish gold that had a two-finger head that receeded slowly with lacings. A faint citric hop smell and some malts in there. A light-to-medium body, this had a crisp carbonated feel with a good citric hop presence and a slightly dry backbite. Some malts on the side include caramel and bread (somethi9ng doughy). I could session a couple of these even though its a little simplistic."
"D: easy to drink, an APA that could be sessioned...just allow it to warm enough first."
" Perhaps it comes very close.I will leave it at that since the Sierra brew may be better balanced. Still,this one has a chance."
"D- It's a pretty good drinker. The flavor isn't ""in your face."""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. No date but a code on the label. It was a clear, deep amber color with a good carb stream. It has a small off-white head that quickly settled into a broken foam. Very little lacing. The aroma was, of course, cascade hops. It was a little weaker than others in the style that I have tried. The taste was good but again was missing something for me. Overall, a good APA but I've had better in the style. Worth trying but don't go out of your way."
"This is a good beer to relax with. Not to complex, but a very well crafted beer. Something that will find its way into my fridge more often."
"Right up Flying Dog's alley. Crisp, malty, tad bite of hops and a wee bit bitter grain finish. Not great, not terrible, both good and average. Flying Dog is the ""I'm only going so far so don't push me"" brewery. Reminds me of Sam Adams. They won't budge, they like coming up just short...but just short in the glorious American craft brew selection is still an honor. Begins knocking on Sierra Nevada's door, but they aint answering. A worthy attempt nonetheless."
"Overall this is a lot like the Flying Dog IPA. Worth a shot, and a pretty good deal for the price."
"Darker than I expected it to be. Nice dark gold-to-brown color and a thick foamy head. Sharp citrus and hop notes. Hoppy, slightly sweet, and a l;ittle bit of citrus in the flavor. Smooth texture, nice body, and easy to drink. One of the better Pale Ales and definitely the best that I've had from the Flying Dog company."
"A lightly carbonated, amber colored beer sits in my pint glass like a dog with its tail between its legs. An inviting smell of hops is what draws me in for more. A light carbonation doesn't balance well with a light, docile flavor. Definitely pale ale in smell and taste but feels more like watered-down Sierra Nevada PA. This dog is more chihuahua than pit-bull in the end and could use a nice kick in flavor to boost up the brew."
"D= very drinkable if you're in the mood for a strong Pale-Ale, even IPA fans should really appreciate this. Pine-bitters and bite might get to my stomach after a handful, though."
"D: Nice session beer. I'll happily revisit this one."
"Poured from bottle to glass. Seems like a very standard IPA to me (hence the name Classic Pale Ale..I guess). Copper color and thin head at first after pour. Head remains ringed at the edges of the glass throughout the entire drink. Pretty dry, the hop taste lingers in your mouth after you swallow. There's not a huge hop presence, nothing interesting. Not something to write home about. They do go back easily however. Also, some have noted a chill haze. I did not seem to find that."
"This pale ale has a nice transparent copper appearance with a medium white head. Some lacing. Smell is strong of citrus, particularly grapefruit & lime as well as yeast, hops. Taste is a combination of citrusy hops and malt, but the hops wins out. Fair amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisp with a some acidity. This is a drinkable pale ale but not nearly as good as many I've had."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body and carbonation."
"Pours a clean copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, small grapefruity hops, an a small sweet maltiness. In the taste, small hop presence, sweet malt, and somewhat watery. A lighter body and a small bite in the mouthfeel, with a small dry hoppy aftertaste. OK pale, small hop presence and somewhat watery."
"Pours a darker almost ruby colored amber with some pretty good bubbling, a good head after the pour, and a strong film of foam on the top of the beer. The aroma is a light bread an Yakima valley hops. Great malt and hop combo. Th taste is almost as balanced, with a little more emphasis on the hops in the front. The finish balances out the hops with some wet rye bread. Very soft palate balanced with breads and lemon zest."
"D - For a pale ale, this was very interesting. I love hoppy beers, but every once in a while, I enjoy a mildly hopped beer. This pale ale, while still having that nice hop aroma and flavor, is not nearly as harsh as other pale ales out there. Definitely a sessionable brew."
"D - More than one? Yes please."
"Served a crisp orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was a very faint tinge of citrus hops. The taste was fair balance of sweet malts and citrus hops. The beer was light and crisp with decent carbonation. This was a somewhat enjoyable beer, but there's better Pale Ale's out there."
"Nice light amber colored brew with a decent white head that left some lacing. Smells of fresh grassy hops, earthy malts with carmel hints and slight citrus smell as well. Taste has a decent bitter hop hit throughout some biscuity malt flavor and hints of tropical fruit flavors theat never really materialize. I got a slight metalic aftertaste, but it did have a decengt feel and was drinkable other than that metalic noted aftertaste. Overall I thought it looked more appealling than it was but still its a worthy APA."
"Overall: boring pale ale."
"Pours a clear burnt umber, big bubbled white head forms, some lace spots, slowly settles down to a thin ring, looks okay. Smell is sweet and perfumy, caramel, biscuity malt, lots of floral, some spicy hopping, oranges, cherry liqueur, I like this. Taste is nice, caramel malt, quite grainy, bit of burnt sugar, lots of light fruit and floral hopping, bit of grapefruit, strawberries, nice balanced finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, a bit too sharp but still refreshing. Must be better fresh but is a solid pale ale as is."
"D - Very nice for drinking this summer - very quenching."
"Taste is an excellent balance of pale malts with the semi-sweet caramel and a nice hop bitterness that features just the least bit of bitter lime peel. Nice dry finish, and excellent drinkability."
"Had this on tap in SC. Had a nice dark golden, amber color. Not much head to this but excellent lacing, which was a bit odd. The smell was very strong citrus. Taste was hoppy with a definite citrus finish. Not as smooth as I would have expected. Maybe I would get this again, but I'd most likely look elsewhere. Nothing special."
"D - Easy drinking brew. Maybe good as a lawnmower-type brew that's very light and thirst quenching."
"Doggie Style is a pretty good APA with a cool name and, as always, awesome artwork."
"drinkability: definately sessionable. Rather tasty stuff and it's light and refreshing. It's certainly drinkable. I like this beer."
"Got a sample pack from Table and Vine. I dig this pale ale. The appearance is pretty dark amber with no head to begin with or any lacing. The aromas were probably its biggest strength: really spiced, yeasty, hoppy and citrus flavors, warmly wrapped around malty alcohol. The taste has a smooth, dryness to it. Hoppy with a sweetness balanced in a medium-thin body. Really enjoyable due to its lightness but great pale ale taste. Overall, a solid pale ale."
"It comes out of the tap a nice reddish amber with a decent off-white head. Aroma is surprisingly hoppy and seems to have a dash of spice. Flavor is strong and fairly hoppy; bitterness is mild. Texture is fairly smooth, but had an edge to it. A lively, jazzy, satisfying ale."
"The beer is very crisp and refreshing with a great hop presence, and since I'm on my third by now, I definitely think I could have more than one."
"D: Fairly drinkable for an APA. It's a bit too heavy, but still gets the job done. Not as sessionable as some other APAs I've had, but still very good. The best Flying Dog beer I've had yet."
"This copper hued amber brew poured clear into a pint glass creating a solid two finger slight off white head. The sticky cobblestoned head has decent staying power and leaves a fair amount of rope like lacing. The nose is of warm crystal malt and citrusy floral hop spice. On the palate, this beer is relatively light bodied, refreshing and deliciously well balanced, perhaps too much so. Toasty malt with caramel tones is well matched to citrus/grassy Cascade hop spice with a hint of alcohol and slight biscuity breadlike malt character. Finishes relatively clean, only slightly drying considering the style. Cascade showcased quite well in this brew but could be balanced a bit more towards the bitter side. Overall, a very tasty and quite quaffable American pale ale."
"Pours a hazyish amber with some red and orange tones when held to light,the head is tan with lots of rope like lacing.This one smells fruity sweet,and hoppy.The taste was not as hop filled as the nose,but a nicely balanced APA.A good amount of caramel malt gives a nice offset to the earthy,grassy and slightly bitter hop presence that is the backbone.A medium full body and soft carbonation,with just the right amount of tounge tingling hops makes this one of the most drinkable APA's I've ever had."
"D - I had this beer a long long time ago and didn't much like it, but now I feel it would be a perfect session beer, especially alongside some snacks to counteract the constant bitterness. Easy to drink with enough flavor to keep it interesting, but not so much as to make it intense."
"Drinkability- Session beer for sure. Well rounded, quenching and tasty. Wondering why I didn't try this earlier."
"Deep amber/gold. Nice clarity. 1/2"" off white head. Falls to a cap and stays there. Light lacing. Nice citrusy, floral hop aroma with a some sweet, caramel malt under it. Citrus and pine needle hop flavors dominate. Malt is a little muted with a only a hint of breadiness. Medium body, medium carbonation. Simple and tasty pale ale. Sessionable APA...good drinkability."
"pours a clear med. red-copper colour w/ a thin off white head which dissolves into pools of large bubbles leaving a decent coating of lacing in my nonic ; not a strong smell, piney/floral hops and warm bread mostly, not much else stands out ; taste follows suit in being a bit light, but still good, a decent hop bite well balanced w/ a deeper roasted malt flavor, crisp finish with a hint of soapiness ; a light bodied beer made fuller by the good level of co2, sticks around just long enough to get all the flavor out ; quite a drinkable brew, too bad there's only 2 in the sampler pack..."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a thick persistent head. No real lacing to speak of. The taste is a bit sweet with bitter hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and carbonated. The drinkability of this is fairly good, however I don't think I could drink several in one sitting."
"Refreshing and much more than I expected, would make a good session beer."
"D- A nice rendition of an APA that is easily sessionable."
"Overall, nicely put together, easy to drink."
"D: Very drinkable and highly enjoyable. Smooth and easy with solid flavors that hold together. Recommended."
"I would have liked no alcoholic taste, and maybe more of a hop presence in the nose"
"O: A good beer that only suffers from its lack of weight. Maybe not the best pale ale, but refreshing and it definitely has its place."
"Clean and crisp mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. Everything a classic APA should be."
"I found this pale ale a bit more British than I had expected. And there is nothing wrong with that."
"D: Yep"
"Which makes a very drinkable brew! Just enough flavor to keep it interesting but not so much it slows you down. Nice!"
"This is a decent pale but could use a little boost of fullness. I have found a watered down thinness in most Fkying Dog beers that disappoints me a little since they have such great artwork on their bottles. Pours a healthy amber color with a slightly hoppy nose. At first taste of hops but swish it around and damn, there's that thinning sensation. Don't go taste, stay there! The finish leaves a struggling hoppiness and some malt but flavor is fleeting. Drink up when you are lazing around a fishing hole though!"
"D - Refreshing! I look forward to enjoying more as the weather heats up. A nice beginner APA, recommended for a session."
"D: Okay. Easy to put back but not altogether enticing."
"D- This goes down very well... could definitely put a few of these down without thinking."
"D: Good Session brew for sure..."
"The first in a small series of Flying Dogs I tried, this one was quite good. It had a very nice blend of hops, yeast, and malt. It was smooth and pretty easy to drink, with just a slight copper bitterness. This reminded me of Eureka, which is one of my staple beers."
"Pours a medium amber color, slight haze with a quarter inch of off0white head and excellent tracing on the glass. Aroma of grassy, citrusy hops dominates, and I really struggle to get any malt aroma out of this beer. On the palate, however, the malt profile really emerges. Though the hop presence is strong with its requisite citrus, piney, resiny strength, a nice toasty, Munich malt feel helps to balance. It has quite a bit more body than a SNPA with a dextrinous, hoppy finish. Carbonation is pretty standard and it's light enough on the mouth without being watery. Some might see this as a pretty blah APA, but I really like it and would choose it over an SNPA anyday."
"D - Very good pale ale. I could throw a few of these back no problem."
"Pours a translucent, dark reddish amber. A foamy, off-white head settles slowly, leaving random, patchy lacing on the glass. The aroma is dry and grainy, but with a substantial piney hop character. Wheat and rye make themselves known amongst the evergreen hop profile. Flavors follow suit, with the aforementioned elements showing over a substantial caramel malt base. Medium bodied and easy drinking, this is a solid session brew. I"
"Drinkability - Easy Rider."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Great look and enjoyable drink."
"Can't say I loved it, but as a taster for my other 8 Colorado beers, not bad."
"Had this beer last night at Croxely's Ale House in Franklin Square. Pretty good Pale Ale, but didn't wow me too much. Slight hop aroma and nice clean finish, amber in color, good drinkability. I'm a big fan on Flying Dog's Double Dog and Gonzo but this was pretty average even for its style in my book. Worthwhile try, but i would stick with SN Pale Ale over this any day of the week."
"Pours amber-orange with a moderate white head; drop rapidly leaving little lacing. Aroma is mainly citrus hops (it's dry-hopped with Cascade) but not excessively grapefruit. Taste is American pale ale citrus with a substantial bittering hop component. There's enough malt to hold everything together. Finishes with a nice bitterness, some citruds hops, slightly astringent. This is a good 'go to' pale ale that's readily available."
"The aroma is good and smell of classics pale ale smells. The flavor is bitter on the with a nice citrus smell. The taste is bitter in the front and dry in the back. It has a excellent hop character to it. I will be having a couple more of these."
"D: Top notch pale ale, can happily put away many of these with a solid meal."
"Aroma is very nice. There are moderate bready notes with light grapefruit and apple as well as butter. Pour is a clear sparkling bronze with a creamy off-white head. Flavor is pretty waterey. A tad astringent on the finish. Wouldn't buy again, kind of forgettable."
"D-I like this stuff. Visually it is almost a work of art, and it tastes great. The label is unique, and only adds to the qualities that make this beer memorable."
"Doggy Style has a beautiful, rich red color. Earthy hops offer a pleasant aroma. Bittering hops are powerful upon tasting and leave a bitter aftertaste. Good representation of an English Pale ale. This beer is pretty easy to drink. My experience was an enjoyable one."
"This beer poured out a golden amber with a thick head leaving some lacing. It smelled of of caramel malts and spicy hops. The taste was pretty balanced leaning a little heavy on the hops. It is medium bodied with good carbonation. Pretty good beer but not outstanding."
"The beer pours a light amber with a light tan head. The aroma was of malt and hops. The taste was slightly malty with a fairly strong hop finish. The feel is light and dry. A reasonable pale ale, but nothing that shouts out have me. So I wouldn't turn one down, but I probably won't seek it out either."
"Reddish amber pour with nice thick off- white lasting head. Looks nice and smells mostly of lightly fragrant hops and a hint of malty caramel. Nice lacing on the glass as well. Taste is incredibly smooth, with a lovely hop flavor and slight bitterness up front and it finishes clean with a hint of a malty sweetness and a medium length finish. Very good, easy to drink, and I will definitely get this again. A great pale ale similar to Sierra Nevada with perhaps a touch less hops and bitterness.."
"D - Very refreshing, a good beer for typical Florida drinking. Excellent uncomplicated hoppy pale ale, a real easy and fun drinker. One I come back to often."
"This a good pale, but not a brilliant one. The color is clear amber with a whitish head that hangs around the edges of the glass and minimal lacing. The aroma is aged hops, not the fresh hoppy ester, or raw green hop smell that I was hoping for. There is some metallic malty aromas here too. The taste is on the dry side with a raw hop flavor (this does taste like it has been dry hopped) and some malty dextrin sweetness in the background. There may be some dry nuttiness in there as well, but it is quite subdued. There is a copperishness too to this beer that gets blended in with the overall dryness. this is somewhat of a medium bodied beer, not overly carbonated, and the aftertaste does linger a bit. This beer is okay, but the hops are not grassy enough for my tastes, and the maltiness is slightly metallic and it gets compromised by some of the dryness as well. The beer tends to thin out after it settles."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Decently priced and easy to find in six pack, this one can end up becoming a regular in your drinking rotation. While its not the best pale ale or the strongest tasting, it is a good medium ale and great for your BBQs or other social gatherings."
"I'd have no problem sitting down and polishing off a couple of these puppies any day. Be great for washing down a spicy dish from one of our local Chinese places (I'd take it over Tsing Tao, authenticity be danged), or salmon."
"D: one of the better small company beers I have ever tried. I could go for a 6'er"
"So what can I conclude? You best try this beer yourself. It isn't extreme, and I think that's what they mean by ""Classic"". But it's sturdy and reliable - you might just end up with it as a regular in your fridge."
"Pours a copper color with a plenty of carbonation and a nice thumb-sized head. Aroma is grain and a reasonable dose of hops. Taste is ever better - rounding things out with a malty caramel flavor."
"D: An above-average pale ale. Nothing that knocks your socks off but easily enjoyable with some nachos at the Woody Creek Tavern after a long day at Snowmass."
"D - I like the beer but it has a bad finish. Good flavor bad finish."
"D - Very good. This is one of those definite staple brews in my fridge. Not my favorite style, but as far as I'm concerned this is one of the most drinkable APA's on the market. Recommended."
"Other: Simpe Style, Yet Flying Dog Managed to make it More Complex. Of the Mixed Pack I Purchased, I Thoroughly Enjoyed This and the SnakeDog IPA."
"Doggie Style pours an orange-pinkish hue with two fingers of white froth, rather impressive. The smell is enticing, well-hopped and rife with fruit--orange, lemon, melon--really good. The taste didn't quite back up the smell, though it's certainly good. The fruit and hops come through cleanly, though I wouldn't mind a bit more hops. Smooth and fairly well carbonated, this is well crafted, one of the better offerings from Flying Dog that I've tried."
"Drinkability: I'm still a hop-head but this one is just not hoppy enough for me. I realize it's only a PA but there is just too much malt here for me, and the malt is not a good tasting malt that balances out the hops. It comes at you in a distracting sort of way followed by the unpleasant tin flavor. It would be a good choice as a gateway beer for those who want to journey into hopdom but there is nothing world class about this one."
"Delicious beer, I could drink it all night long."
"Drinkability- Fun and easy to drink. I could drink this one all night."
"Pours a very slightly hazed amber with a crème head. Minor earthy nose. Flavor is earthy as well with a nice leafy edge. Feel is well bodied on liquid. Carbonation is full and bites just a little bit. A nice drinker. Smooth and a bit edgy with an earthy quality."
"Drinkability: It's not exactly what I'd call a ""classic"". Then again, ""okay"" doesn't look as good on a bottle label."
"From a 12oz decorated bottle that I copped singly for about $1.50, this ""pale ale"" poured an unusually dark amber-brown color with a decent frothy head... was a lot darker than I expected but a nice appearance nonetheless... this was my first brew from the Flying Dog company, and although it wasn't bad at all, can't say I was head-over-heels about this one... smell was good, slightly hoppy with some vanilla aftertones... taste was slightly bitter, with a hoppy, vanilla presence that lingered for a bit... nice bread and butter flavor that was subtle yet refined... mouthfeel was equally good, and being very drinkable, this beer went down smooth, crisp, and clean... Recommended as a pretty good rendition of the style..."
"D - A nice beer for sure. Something I'd drink a bit of if it was cheaper and more readily available here."
"Flying Dog is a brewery that used to be all over Boise... now it seems only a couple of the better beer stores carry their brews.. and even those stores are carrying fewer and fewer.. What happened to the Horn Dog, the Double Dog? What happened to the GONZO? Good solid beer from a definately above average brewery."
"The taste is likewise sour with some malt and fruity hoppiness to back it up. It is light bodied and almost flat. It is almost undrinkable. I have avoided everything from this brewery because of this 6-pac but seeing all the praise I must have had a bad sample. But I still won't rush out and buy anything else from this brewery. Some of the worse micro beer I have ever had."
"Worth the money I paid, only for something new and unique."
"Drinkability: This beer ""downs"" easily and, subjectively, gives a jolly refreshing feel to the event. Good taste, with a moderate alcohol content, easy to drink and not too filling makes for a good sports afternoon in front of the ""Tube"" with your buddies."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, I could certainly drink this beer for a very long time."
"Recommended."
"Overall, this is definitely one of Flying Dog's better offerings...A smart buy"
"Poured into pint glass from 12 oz. bottle from Flying Dog sampler. Pours a golden-amber color with good head. Pretty good retention and some lacing left behind. Smell is initially of muffled hops however that seems to decipate as I drink and it starts to take on a grassy and almost metallic smell. Taste is nice balance of malt and hops, slightly heavier on the hops side with some citric notes. Moderate carbonation and a slightly oily residue is left behind. While its not the best APA I've had it wasnt bad at all and very drinkable, a good session beer."
"Update-12/05/07 this was very good on tap at the brewery. Hoppy and fresh. Too bad its not the same in the bottles."
"ps: I love Flying Dog's label artwork! Definitely some of the most unique labels I've seen."
"Beer pour a clear amber color. Mine had a small beige head that disappeared pretty quickly. A light note with hints of citrussy hops. Taste starts with a bit of malt sweetness up front followed by bitter, citrussy hops in the middle with a lingering bitter finish. A very good example of the American pale ale style."
"Drinkability: A good pale ale. I wasn't crazy about certain flying dog stuff, but this is a good beer."
"I'm sort of a Flying Dog sucker, but the Classic Pale Ale is just that - classic. It won't wow, but it'll never disappoint. In fact, there are some pleasant surprises for those who aren't used to the style, most notably the color and smell."
"D - This one really depends on my mood right now its just ok but it could be great if I w as in the mood for something more hoppy"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer. The balanced flavors and medium carbonation make this a prime candidate for mass consumption."
"D: Very refreshing and easy to drink. I think I like this more every time I taste it."
"Overall - A pretty decent APA - nothing groundbreaking just a good, clean well made APA... recommended..."
"D - I must say I am not that pleased with this beer. The flavor is quite unplesant... but at least it looks good."
"This is the third beer I've tried in a mix twelve pack of Flying Dog beer. It poured an amber color without much head and what there was was gone pretty quickly. The smell was floral with some pine with hops. The taste was of hops. Not too bitter but enough bite. Overall a good ale."
"A very easy to drink pale ale but not a favorite due to the buttery aftertaste."
"D- Drinkability factor was just OK. It was a little too bitter for me to want to drink alot of it, but definitely was an alright choice. Not bad, just not my thing. And that is kind of wierd, since pale ales are mostly my thing. Just a little too sour and not that sweet."
"I tried this becuase I'm a big fan of their Gonzo Imperial Porter, and I wanted to see how FD did a pale ale. Lived up to its expectations. Poured a deep golden, good foam. FD seems to be big on carbonation, and their pale is no expection. Nice and hoppy, a good lingering taste with aftertaste, but not too bitter, and not at all sweet. Excellent pale ale. Much better than Harpoon, which I consider average, but not as good as Stoudt's, the APA by which I measure all others."
"Pours gold with a reddish tint. Big rocky head. Nice lacing on the surface and sides of the glass. Aroma is faint herbal and citrusy hops. Taste is mostly pleasant herbal hops. Decent malt backbone, but hops dominate. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side. Quite drinkable and a good pale ale overall."
"Overall a decent brew thats not bad to have every once in awhile."
"A very nice and hoppy bottle smell. Poured into a pint and got a nice bronze colour with a nice head. In the glass the smell is sweeter like caramel. Taste is a great mix of malt and hops. Well balanced, not too sweet but the bitterness of the hopping is not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is great, the carbonation seems a little high but it helps the flying dog give a good bite. Overall a triple, the sweetness starts with the hop bite coming immediately, but the third stage returns back to sweetness over bitterness. Very cool. Very much a pleasure to imbibe this brew. I will be drinking more in the future when I see it."
"pours a beautiful honey color with a one inch frothy white head, decent amount of carbonation and lacing are prevalent. smell is great, spicy hops dominate while a bit of orange citrus is hidden. taste is awesome, i don't know if its just cause i worked 13 hours but i'm in love with this. very full, rich and warm, awesome taste all around, the hops just slightly overpowers the malt and i like it. drinkability and mouthfeel are both good. another good brew from flying dog"
"Wow, I've never really been impressed by any of Flying Dog's regular lineup until now. This is a very solid pale ale, it's just a little thin. There's nice soapy lacing and an amber body. The aroma is nice and strong with citrus and floral over mellow caramel. The flavor is more of the same, but the malt falls off a little early, and like I said, the body feels thin. Other than that, its a nice hoppy, yet light session ale."
"Goes down pretty easily. Try this if you get the chance."
"D: I knocked down 3 pretty easily. Not to strong in the mouth or on the tongue, easy drinking beer."
"Pours a clear amber. 1/2 inch head. Smells fruity, piny, and sweet. The taste is a little more hoppy than most APA's. A bigger malt background still reigns it in as an APA and not an IPA. Sweet in the front dissolving into a moderately hopped and resiny ale. Clean dry finish makes it go great on a hot day or with spicy foods. Nice name too."
"Crystal clear, deep amber color, with two fingers of white ehad and light lacing. Dissolves to a thin film fast. Nose is caramel malt, but more fruity, piney hops. Taste is likewise - nice smooth fruity hops. A good amount of toffee malt as well. Surprisingly creamy body. I really like this one, maybe my favorite of the Flying Dog taster so far. A little high in ABV, but close to sessionable."
"This isn't a bad pale ale. It's kind of nice to see someone restraining themselves with the hops. Easily a session beer."
"D: Nicely flavored, neither overwhelmingly rich nor oppressively dense, this beer is quite sessionable. It's not especially memorable, but neither is it at all prohibitive."
"pours a deap amber, with an average head, that clings with some nice lacing. The smell is a bit hoppy for a plae ale, with some citrus and pine notes. Taste starts off a bit sweet, going into some heavy hops for the style, which finishes bitter, with an avergae mouthfeel and drinkability. Hoppy then the average pale ale, which i like"
"12 oz. bottle with a strange-looking label. The smell is mainly of hops, some faint citrus. Very hoppy, with grapefruit and a kind of a piney aftertaste. Average tasting pale ale I'd say. Mouthfeel kind of light. Nothing I'd go out of the way for, but it was all right."
"Light to medium in body, nicely carbonated. This is a nice drinkable APA that does not stand out in a crowd."
"D- This is a fine APA, but nothing spectacular. Worth a try. The label art looks cool at least."
"Not a bad APA"
"Poured a nice deep orange with a small light tan head. Smells of citrus hops. The taste is very rich, the hops add a great floral character to the beer with malt to match. Not an excessively bitter beer, a little bit sweet, but still very much to my liking. Perhaps a bit rich tasting for a session beer, but otherwise a solid apa."
"This one poured a nearly clear, beautiful copper colour with a fine, beige cap. Though the foam fell in short order, solid lacing was left behind and a solid ring + a skim of tiny bubbles remained. Piney hops were up front in the aroma, with a bit of fruitiness and mild malt (caramel, toast) in the background. Mild malty sweetness with moderate, well balanced bitterness. Fruit character intensified towards the end, with a light lingering bitterness. Lightish bodied, ample carbonation, solid texture throughout. I really liked the balance in this beer, which made it pleasant and easy to drink. I'd definitely have this again."
"D: O.K. if offered but wouldn't go out of my way to pick up more."
"The beer tastes as hoppy as it smells. A big lemon flavor starts us off, with pine, orange, and flowers coming through secondary. There's a bitter, dry finish, with little malt to really balance it out. Mouthfeel is too thin and no carbonated enough. To be honest, this is a decent APA for those looking for a hoppy brew, but I prefer better balance."
"A refreshing pale ale, served chilled it really hit the spot on a warm summer's evening however its all a bit one dimensional, theres not a whole lot of depth to the flavour and its all a bit short lived. That said, drinkable :)"
"Poured out 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Nice brown, dark amber color with a one-inch head that retains well. Smells pretty strong of citrus. Taste has a tangy citrus start with a hops middle, and a bit of a bitter finish at the end, in the back of your throat. Feels a bit over carbonated on the tongue, but other than that is very refreshing and crisp. Overall, I like this beer and Flying Dog did a good job on making a nice APA, but nothing too special for me. I'd drink if offered, but don't see myself reaching for a 6-pack at my neighborhood store."
"Yeah, it's a darn good pale ale. Not a DFH by any stretch, but plenty of maltyness, lots of earthy hoppyness, a nice medium-thick mouthfeel and good drinkability. If it were $7 or $8 per 6-pack I'd probably choose something different, but for $5.39 for a 6er? Sign me up!"
"Over all, not a bad beer but for $35 a case I think I'll pass on it, unless it's on sale. I was expecting much more from this beer."
"A very drinkable beer, and a good representation of the style. This one is on par with the best of the American pale ales. I wish it was more widely available in my area. Very nice."
"Nice brew but not amazing."
"I was fairly happy with this one. Again the head retention was next to nothing as I finished it off, not making it appear very inviting."
"12 oz. bottle- color of medium brown, with a decent tan head - nose of hops, orange blossom, cilantro?, and malty  taste of orangey, light hops, and too light- body is medium, semi oily, and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of light resin , and malts"
"This brew pours a clear red color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into this lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit with a hint of cirtus, and an undertone of malt. The taste has everything from the aroma but is less intense. The mouthfeel is velvety with nice fine carbonation, and a medium body. Overall, this is a nice pale ale. I could drink this again."
"Attractive copper color with nice head that lasted a pretty long time. Nicely balanced aroma between malt and hops. Not overly hopped like many pale ales, instead well-balanced. Taste is balance of bitterness, light caramel, and fruit citrus. Nice lacing on glass. This makes a fine session brew at 5.32%"
"Just another pale ale. Nothing to crazy or special, just another middle of the road beer (kind of seems to be the tendency of Flying Dog)."
"D- It is a average Pale Ale. Nothing to make it stand out from the crowd. I can drink it but just nothing special."
"One of my old favorites that I just got around to reviewing. A healthy head leaves fine lace on top of a bright amber gem. Smell is simple, citric. Flavor is hop forward, a little dirty which I like. Nice balance of citric and piney hops, and the malt holds it all together real nice. Mouthfeel is nice, refreshes and soothes. Great pale ale for all seasons."
"A deep amber, almost reddish color with a whispy head and a little bit of lace. The aroma is pretty mild, a little pine at best. Taste is a nice blend of malt and pine, lightly carbonated, a little hoppy, perhaps like a very mild ipa. Not too complex though. Plenty drinkable and a happy introduction to Flying Dog. Classic is a good name for this!"
"D - Overall, not a bad APA. Nothing fancy, but a pretty decent beer."
"This beer has a deep golden dark color, also a creamy head that lasts more than usual. It has a decent amount of hops but there could have been more, the maltiness would have been better contrasted with a higher hop count. Not a bad choice though for a refreshing beer."
"Wait a minute. Let this thing warm up to cellar temp where I should have served it in the first place! Caramel aroma now comes through well and flavor mellows nicely. Again that English character coming through. Still not a winner, but drinkable. DON'T try this one ice cold."
"Not much of a smell to this one overall but I'm thinking I detect a bit of pine in what scent I find. A light amber color that's nice but nothing special. A bit watery in the mouth. More yeasty than hops in the flavor which is a let down because, after all it claims to be a pale ale...A ""classic"" one at that. I like my pale's to have the hops get my attention. It's the first thing I look for in them. Kind of a coffee bean, grapefruit and that pine thing I already mentioned is what popped up on the tongue but it's an odd balance that doesn't work for me. I'm all for the grapefruit thing when it comes to dry hopped ales (which is what this claims to be) and come to expect it but it's the coffee bean thing mostly that turns me off here. It's just tastes weird here and hangs too long in the aftertaste. Not much to get excited about really. If I'm over at a friend's house and I'm offered one of these down the road I won't turn it down but I don't see me picking up another six for myself again."
"Taste is medium bitter with clear US hops, which are citric and a little flowery. The hops give a nice aroma and appear to be dry hopped. The malt is lightly sweet and dextrinous and also caramellic. Body is light sticky and drinkability is good."
"Clear, amber orange pour with some carbonation persisting even after the fine, light beige head falls away into a tight collar. The nose is reasonably assertive, with biscuity grains and citrus hops. There's an off-note in there too that I can't pin down. Malt and hops hit the tongue in tandem, but the bitterness wins out and lasts into a smooth finish. Mouthfeel is light with some crispness--perhaps the reason the hops bitterness doesn't cling more than it should."
"12oz brown bottle with Ralph Steadman label art. Looks cool giving you that gonzo vibe. Pours amber with a very light-tan head that's got good lacing. Orange-mint and spruce in the hoppy aroma. A very fresh sample. Malt sweetness aroma backs it all up nicely. Juicy fruit malt and salty caramel sweetness with all the hops you could want in a pale ale; orange, slight grapefruit, lemon iced-tea, pine and spruce. Dry hopped well to make for an aromatic flavor profile. Medium body with medium smoothness makes for a great session beer. Brewed in Denver, CO for the west and Frederick, MD for the east to almost guarantee a fresh sample coast to coast. Love this brewery."
"In the end, you just want another. And another."
"I thought it was a bit thin, but on merit this is a reasonably good APA. The grape vinuous character is very apparent and pleasant, good dry hopped technique, overall a really decent beer."
"M/D: a little too light for my tastes but it is very good. it has a smooth feel to it and is a beer you could enjoy drinking though i still wish it was less light and more medium bodied"
"D: I could sit and drink a few of these over some good conversation. Overall, I think this is one of the very best American Pale Ales available."
"Pours a golden red color with an average tan head that is leaving some nice lacing as I drink it. A very nice color. The smell is pretty faint, grassy citrus hop. The taste definitely has more of a hoppiness than the smell. It has a light grassy hop which borders on citrusy but doesn't quiet get there before the malt balances it out. A very balanced brew. It could be a tad hoppier. Has a moderate body and good carbonation, a slight bitterness left on the tongue. A good APA not outstanding, worth trying."
"D: An average APA that does not impress much."
"Drinkability is good, extremely well balanced. This beer is a perfect example of the style, with just the right amount of hoppiness. Recommended."
"OK, but nothing to write home about."
"D- OK, but not a ""rush out and get this one"" beer. Lower ABV makes it a nice session style beer for the summer."
"overall this is a very nice beer and its a plus that its also sessionable"
"Pretty decent flavor on this one...not sure why it's so poorly rated. Good hoppy caramel notes and a great carbonation level. The body is a thick one for a pale ale (not a problem) and it has a nice bitter-hop finish. Goes well with cheeses and steak. Disregard the flack, this is easily an 86/100 and up Pale Ale. It's flavorful, and has a biting finish reminiscent of Flying Dog's Double Dog DIPA. A bit simple, but it's certainly drinkable."
"Two-finger head straight from the bottle with nice tracings on glass....brownish clear color with a hoppy aroma...smooth taste, soft palate....smooth and crisp, with a smooth, unobtrusive aftertaste...""classic"" is a presumptive term, but in this case I'll nod and use the word ""smooth"" again..."
"Poured into a pint glass.A clear,amber body that looks like any other pale ale with a half finger white head.Some bubbles streaming to the top of the glass.Citrus and some bready malt in the nose.I really pick up on some pineapple.The malt is the pretty dominant smell to me.Citrus hops are the first taste with some bittering after the sip goes down your throat.As the beer warms the hop smell starts to take over.I think this is a no thrills APA.I wouldnt pour it out of my pint glass but Ive had this beer before, but under many different names.I dont think I will try this beer again."
"D- simple balanced pale, english like, enjoyable and sessionable, worth a try but i wouldnt keep this in my fridge"
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug. A dark amber body with a white head. Very poor retention but held an ok lacing. The smell was fairly hoppy, typical of an APA. The taste was that of a good APA. Initial taste is very malty with subtle hops. But a lot of the hops come through in the aftertaste which made drinking the beer very nice and soothing. The mouthfeel was pretty full-bodied. Very drinkable beer. Balance of hop and malts makes it nice and soothing to drink."
"Beer pours a medium amber color with ample carbonation. Aroma is nice and hoppy with some malt peeking out. The taste is much the same with a smooth, hoppy finish and a malty backbone. Not too bad. Reminds me of my homebrewed Pale Ale. Regardless, I would say it represents the style well. There's a slight caramel taste at the back of the throat which only makes it better in my opinion."
"This is fine if you don't want anything too demanding (ABV-wise) or complex. There are better pale ales out there, and that odd iced tea flavor throws me, but not something I'd ever turn up my nose at."
"This a very drinkable pale ale that isn't complex but is very refreshing. It pours a pale golden yellow with minimal head that doesn't lace. The aroma is very mild and the taste is crisp and clean for an ale... almost like a lager. Very very drinkable beer perfect for a warm summer day."
"I enjoyed the flavors of this PA, lots of grapefruity and piney hops. But for some reason the entire beer was foamy all hell. Every sip I took turned into foam in my mouth and destroyed the entire experience. I don't know what sort of carbination problems could have caused this but I would like to retry this beer sometime so I can fully enjoy it."
"D: Nice beer, I like some hops in my pale ale. This seems to be a pale ale in the british tradition. Worth trying, not my favorite."
"D - not a bad brew if you're having a few, but I wouldn't want more than 2 or 3 of these in a sitting."
"Very pleasant, not exactly my preferred beer (still a bit too hoppy at times) but well crafted."
"ordered this mainly due to the name...appearance is typical for the style, amber. citrusy, piney hops in the nose. malt characteristics are dominated by the hops in this beer. light/medium mouthfeel. decent finish. good drinkability due to abv. good but not outstanding."
"Is this new to Maine? I've heard of Flying Dog but not seen it around. Pours a very pretty golden orange color, smell is of pine and citrus. Taste, a nice citrus bitterness and malt but it's a bit weak for my taste buds (too many Bigfoots I guess) A bit thin mouthfeel. Overall it's good, for me this would be a nice summer quencher rather than a regular pale ale, buy I would recommend it."
"Pours with a dense head that thins out. The head that remains includes tiny, dense bubbles. Clear, clear, clear copper color with only a (very) few carbonation bubbles seen. Smell includes some flowery/citrus hops with a bit sweetness underneath. Taste magnifies the flowery/citrus hops and adds the bitterness. This part has much the same character as Sierra Nevada PA, but doesn't have the richness or depth that I know from SNPA. The sweetness is light caramel but this falls away after several sips and you begin to taste mostly hops which then get accentuated by the aftertaste and the pine flavor starts to come through toward the end of the glass. Mouth feel was good, but I'd like a bit more carbonation in this one. Drinkability is also good. More richness of flavor and a tad more carbonation might give this a better score for me."
"12oz brown bottle from Florian's. Brown-red clear body with a quarter inch of light tan head. Floral pithy hops dominate the aroma. Caramel malt and apricot-like pithy bitter hops dominate the flavor. Fairly well balance, though the hops are a little more central. Medium body with a decent amount of carbonation. Fairly drinkable. Not the best APA I've had, but probably the best thing I've had from Flying Dog so far."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability. Mouthfeel of this brew is a bit disappointing. The body feels thin...""like butter spread over too much bread.""....ha Bilbo Baggins! Carbonation is what one would expect for this style, just right. Overall the mouthfeel for this brew is a let down. It is the low point of the brew. Leaves a bit of an oily residue on the palate, which eventually disappears.This is a brew I'll probably end up buying again, though over this one I'd much rather drink GLBC Burning River or SNPA."
"There is something that bothers me about this, yet, for all that it does have a decent drinkability. In the long run, though, it's pretty forgettable. And, with so many choices in this style, I can't say that this one has anything about it I would choose it over so many others."
"The monotone smell tends to make it a little boring."
"On the whole, an above-average beer, good for session drinking, but I will say it's not a very adventurous brew. I'll happily drink the rest, but for what it's worth, I was left slightly underwhelmed."
"Pours amber with a reasonable head that fades to a cap and leaves some spotty lacing. Smell is balanced sweet malt and floral hops. Taste is sharply hoppy with a nice bitterness an an underlying maltiness. tastes like an English hop varietal. The flavor falls off sharply at the end, but its pleasant. Crisp mouthfeel, but a little mouthcoating. Nicely drinkable."
"Medium-light body with a good carbonation. Crispt and enjoyable, very drinkable and moderately refreshing. It doesn't jump out at you, but it's not supppose too. Shows good balance with a nice hop profile to make it interesting."
"Drinkability...is OK... nothing great... but not bad...."
"The smell is very hoppy, and the taste reflects that, but they are both good. I found this beer to be very drinkable although I would still rather have a SN Pale Ale over it."
"Very smooth and somewhat creamy mouthfeel makes this a keeper. Too bad it's almost $14.00 per sixer..but then you do get what you pay for"
"Medium body, but has a pleasant, lasting presence, post-swallow. Finishes nicely; smooth but not watery. It's a good, solid beer. Better than average, just very odd."
"Drinkability-goes down smooth"
"Drinkability: Above average. I found this to be a great example of a modern APA. Not so biting that your eyes water but hoppy enough to appease the style. Nice work!"
"Very solid, but not oustanding, pale ale. Color of both beer & head a shade darker than what one expects from a PA. Robust, fruity taste and very substantial mouthfeel with an almost syrupy sweet overtone. A little light on the bitterness and carbonation. I'm thinking that's why it might be lacking that crystal-clear sort of *zing* that distinguishes the very best this style has to offer."
"D - Doesn't have the sweetness of Flying Dog's IPA. A good touch of bitterness which is not overpowering."
"12 oz. bottle with some code. It pours an unfiltered, lightly hazy copper that is extremely carbonated with a massive head (4 inches) which makes it difficult to fit the entire beer into a 20 oz. nonic. It smells of pulpy orange with light grapefruit and a light papery or stale character that makes the beer seem a bit ""off."" The flavor has a medium bitterness and tastes the same as the aroma on top of a medium, drying body that is medium in carbonation and finish. Maybe this is a bad bottle, but if not, then I'd rather spend my money on something else."
"I was pleased with this beer. Pours a nice creamy head and the body almost resembles a red ale. Golden to red color with some biscuity goodness on front end with nice grainy flavors. Very smooth with a good twinge of hops on the back end. Smells of some citrusy grapefruit. A nice session brew that I like keeping around. A crowd pleaser."
"Purchased 6er from Pridom in Rockford. Rich ruby copper color. Tons of lacing. Medium pour builds a one inch head. Heavy funky breadlike yeast aroma. Burnt buttery buiscuit up front. Tinges of dark bitterness on after taste. Not bad, Not great...Soft conditioning was a plus."
"A ruddy amber appearance with lacing that speckles the glass on the way down. Hops come through in the flavor, but in a very mild manner. Very smooth and enjoyable, but with a little less pizaz than I was expecitng. Just a calm and mellow beer through and through. Would make a good session ale."
"Pretty much your standard American Pale Ale, maybe this one has a little more malt presence. Worth a try."
"Drinkability is just fine. I'm not a big fan of sour/wheat beers, but this one is well put together with plenty of flavor. Only thing missing is a refreshing finish that begs to have another drink. I didn't get that from this one."
"The drinkability is pretty good, it's one cut above ordinary for a PA. I enjoyed it and will enjoy the rest of this sixer, but I'd have to see a good price to want to buy a repeat sixer. This ale's from Denver, we've got some very good local beers (PA-MD-DE) that are just as good and deserving of my business."
"Overall, a good session beer. Its is worth a try for sure."
"This pale ale has frragrances of sweet malt aromas with a tip of hops. Floral and fruity. Dark amber in color and produces moderate amount of head, and turns into fine lacing. This sample may had possibly suffered a little oxidation. Overall, this feels very watery and almost too flat. Not too bad, but I've had a lot better."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light for an APA<,which makes this beer very drinkable. I could have a handful of these at a sitting."
"Tastes cardboard and fouled malt. Like an IPA I once made that got something awful growing in it. That flavor is awful, beer will be dumped when I get the mouthfeel. Md-thick which is unpleasant because it keeps the flavor around. Blech!"
"Nicely carbonated with a great mouthfeel. The smell is a bitter hoppy aroma. The first taste is a kick of hops, very bitter, somewhat fruity, with a surprising lingering. Even more surprising is the malt finish. It's nice that it comes in and balances out this beer. The malt is a nutty malt. You can see the effect of the maltiness in the color which is a nice clear amber color. I really like this one."
"Pours a clear red/orange with a thin white head that fades quickly. Looks like raspberry iced tea. Nose is strong hops and sweet bread with a malty backbone. Taste is still hoppy but not as strong as the nose. Instead, strong malts come through in the middle, and the hops come back for the finished. Nice balance. Mouthfeel is good and full, a bit tangy. Drinkability is good."
"Drinkability-Quite nice. Not as good as some pale ales, but better than most."
"Overall not a bad beer, however it doesnt really stand up to other beers in this category."
"This is an excellent representation of an American Pale Ale, although not my favorite of the style. A strong taste of hops dominates this brew, as is the case in most Pale Ales. I certainly would enjoy a session or two with this solid product from Flying Dog. Cheers!!"
"D - Not a beer that I can drink a lot of. Not a bad beer. Nice pale ale though. I bought it as a single and not a 6 pack."
"The drinkability is good, a better then average example of the style. MK"
"D - Excellent. The bitter acidic citrius flavors may overwhelm some, but this is right up my alley. This is a damn good brew."
"Drinkability: A good beer."
"Pours a nice brown-gold with a decent head which disappears quickly. Has a citrusy, hoppy scent. Has a thick, rich mouthfeel with small carbonation. Nice malty, flavor underwritten by a very slight hoppy bite. Good flavor, good pale ale, but not the best"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Clear amber liquid with little carbonation rolls to a decent head. Very nice lacing. Smell is disappointing in that there isnt much.Taste starts off with bland malt and finishes a bit hoppy. The dry finish saves this beer for me. I found it to be a very drinkable pale ale, mostly because of the finish. Probably not worth the money I'm paying."
"Doggie Style is ok, not too standoutish and not too bad. The taste is a one-channeled hoppy bitterness. I would like it better if there was a richer pallet. Cant beat the cool art on the labels."
"The smell is malty, very mild. Mouthfeel is thick, rich, almost creamy. There is a hint of oil on the back of the throat. The taste is GREAT. Noticeable hops but not overpowering. This is an extremely balanced, flavorful brew. Maybe my 2nd favorite Pale Ale (after my own). The aftertaste is minty, hoppy, crisp. I love this beer. I could drink a bunch! My favorite of the Flying Dog line so far."
"Drinkability is slightly below average due to the metallic and overly bitter flavors. Nothing to see here. Move along to much better examples."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a thick persistent head. No real lacing to speak of. The taste is a bit sweet with bitter hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and carbonated. The drinkability of this is fairly good, however I dont think I could drink several in one sitting."
"D: I find it to be very drinkable. I don't find myself having to force my selve to drink this one...I'm quite glad there was four of this one in the FlyDog Litter pack I bought. Definitely enjoyable..."
"Not a bad choice."
"Nothing amazing...just a simple cascade-hopped pale ale. No-thinkin', easy-drinkin' beer."
"Notes: Drinkability is an issue with this offering as the mouthfeel is just too oily and thick for me to have a session out of this. The taste is the best part of this offering, not a bad thing to excell in."
"Pours out awfully amber for a pale ale. Oh well. Little off-white head. Clear. It smells nice - it starts out sweet, but has some floral, pine hints to it. Uncomplicated. At the taste, it disappoints. It's fine, but isn't all that impressive. A pale aleish clean malty start, but finishes spongy and dirty. Didn't like the aftertaste. It felt smooth and pleasant in the mouth, at least, but overall it was only tolerable. I don't need to drink more."
"D: Really well-balanced, and a nice beer all around. I recall liking this when I had it a few years ago, and I'm glad my memory works. I'll be getting this again."
"Not the hop bomb I expected but a fairly decent pale ale."
"Into a pint glass, pours a yellowish gold, with ok head and lacing. Aroma is good but forgettable, decent cirtic hops and thats aboot it. Tastes alright, but again, nothing special. So, this is one I'd classify as a good after work beer, something refreshing."
"pours a clear copper body with a sticky white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Aroma of sweet citrus and floral hops and a hint of grain. Good amount of hop bitterness with some sweet malt mixed in. Full bodied with good carbonation. Mouthfeel is smooth with a dry finish."
"This one seems strange to me...the malt nose and taste is much stronger and the taste is an underdeveloped malt, not unlike some homebrews I've had in the past. There is a balance, but the malt is too in your face for the style and the hop effect is lacking. It's easy enough to drink and the artwork on the lable's is a big bonus visually."
"Notes--not quite up there with Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale, but it's pretty good."
"Drinkability: Definitely sessionable, quite a good APA."
"Overall: Pretty good overall, the weak nose, head, and straight hops flavor keep this beer from being great. Good hops presence, but no real complexity. If you like your pale ales straight up, this ones worth a try."
"This is a great Pale Ale. The beer poured a rich amber color that swirled nicely down the sides of the glass. I thin white head formed on the surface of the beer and lasted throughout. There was significant lacing for the duration of the brew. Raising the glass to the nose floods the senses with rich caramel notes offset with a pale ale hop bitterness. The hops hit the front of the tongue with a subtle spicy flavor. As the flavors work their way toward the throat the hops give way to a malty caramel taste that finishes smooth with fruity notes from the yeast. This beer has a well-balanced flavor profile. The mouthfeel is as rich as the flavor making this a good beer to savor which does not sit heavy in the gut. Cheers!"
"A decent beer. Not specatacular but very smooth and easy to drink. Enjoyable."
"Pours amber colored with white head. Smells like citrus and malt. Tastes like grapefruit, a little bit of maltiness with a little bitterness in the finish. The taste on this one is great, but the mouthfeel seems very watery to me. If this had a little more body, it would be great."
"D - It is drinkable, but the hop flavors may overpower anything that you try to eat with it."
"D-goes down nice and easy"
"Poured to a copper color, with off-white head that diminished quickly, yet left good lacing. Kind of a strange beer, regarding aroma and flavor. I detected aroma of hops and dark fruit (plums, figs), yet taste was what I expected more of a pale ale, citrus fruits, dominated by grapefruit. I enjoyed the flavor, yet the finish tended to be sour. May have ben a bit old. Im sure Ill have the opportuinity to have another, and will re-rate if finsih is markedly different. All and all, still a good beer-drinking beer."
"A very nice APA. Pours out to a peppy light amber orange color with medium high carbonation and a nice 1/4 inch pillow of yellowish white foam. Aroma is highly dominated by floral hops and grassy notes. Some citrus and malt. Taste is medium bodied and rather classy; malt, citrusy hops, grass, a hint of bourbon, light wood. Interesting. Keeps the palate busy. Mouthfeel was refined and zesty. Drinkability is pretty good. More hoppy than most APA's. Worth trying. I'd like to see this cask-conditioned..."
"A Very good and tasty beer to quench a thirst, go with a meal or sip on awhile with others. The label can also give you something to talk about. cheers!"
"This has been sitting in the back of my fridge for a little while, but it should still be fresh. It's a decent pale ale, worth a try."
"Overall: If you like hops (as I do) you''ll love this brew."
"beer poured with little to no head. I was a little disappointed, but it may have been a bad pour. its hard to say which smell is more powerful, the hops or the citrus. so I guess that means its a nice blend. tastes pretty hoppy at first but shortly after that a citrus taste takes over, not unlike the smell. the only ""problem"" I have with this beer is I think its a tad bit over carbonated... but thats just preference. over all I think this is a tasty beer which is very easy to drink."
"I don't want to criticize too much, as I think I'm just in a non-Pale Ale kind of place right now. The beer had a good level of hoppiness to it, I thought a bit too much bitterness left in the aftertaste. Nice color and decent aroma, but I rate it about an average Pale Ale."
"Doggie style pale ale is a slightly hazy, dark amber color. It has nice head with decent retention and good lacing. It has malty aroma with some hops. The taste is malt with a nice hop finish. It has medium body, is well balanced, and just plain good. This is one of the better pale ales I have found in this area."
"This is a good drinkable beer, awesome session beer."
"Poured into a 20 oz. pint glass, a half inch head forms, leaving several rings along the glass a it dissolves away. The color is a clear amber color with a hint of orange along the sides. The aroma of malt starts off, followed by pine and earth scents. The hops found in the aroma dominate the taste, there is a malt flavor at the beginning, but does not really stand out. Medium bodied as it first crosses the palate and thins out from there, losing alot of the body it had started with. It is fairly drinkable beer, though the mouthfeel is a disappointment. It still has a good taste and aroma, not a bad choice for a session beer."
"Pours clear copper with a sticky one finger head. Smell is of citrusy hops (grapefruit in particular). In the taste you get much of the same citrusy hop tastes that are in the nose and a slight malty/bready flavor. A decent brew but a bit too thin with a lack of body."
"Drinkability: A good but not great Pale Ale. Easy drinker, close to sessionable. One I would have again if the price is right as I have only the two bottles that came in a mix 12 pack."
"A good and drinkable APA. I would have prefered a stronger hop presence, but overall a good example of the style."
"D- This is an APA done well. The smells and tastes are distinct and classic but this beer is smooth and quaffable for summers in the backyard. Flying dog surprised me on this one and I will have to hunt for this one on cask and in cases."
"Pours an amber-red color with a nice, big off-white colored head. Aroma is hoppy with citrus. Taste is malty, sweet, with a touch of caramel and a pretty strong hops bitterness that gives an aftertaste that is somewhat unpleasant. Mouthfeel is fairly light. Drinkability is pretty good, but the taste limits its appeal a bit."
"Pours clear, auburn in appearance? Off-white one and a half finger head of thick foam that holds well leaving spotty lace. Toasted malt with a very hoppy aroma of cascade and fruity chinook. Sweet crystal malt and biscuity pale malt flavor. Juicy alpha acid aftertaste; dry- with that distinctly american pine sap and grapefruit rind taste. Medium in body and carbonation, the mouthfeel is smooth and even but too hoppy even by west coast standards. The only flaw seems to be the overly hopped flavor, which halts any chance of diacetyl, but puts the finish a tad on the dry side."
"Pours an orange-copper tone with a thick and chunky white head that laced nicely. Aroma is citrus, grassy, and even some yeast I think. Taste is where this one kinda let me down, the hops up front were ok, but the overwhelming orange peel bitterness was what caught my tongue the most. Mouthfeel was ok, except for maybe being a bit flat. I love APA's, so I will give this one another try later on. Still way better most macros though."
"Pours a beautiful bronze color with reddish tones. I really love the color in this beer. The nose is of citrusy bitter hops, though not very pungent. The taste, though, is hops, hops, and more hops! Bittersweet and citrusy, the hops rule this brew. A lemony zest followed with a tangy twang across the palate in the finish. Great tasting beer. The intense bitter/tangyness makes this one a real sipper. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both enjoyable. A good pale ale here. Maybe not the most balanced, but an outstanding offering nonetheless."
"Overall, I can't recommend this beer to anyone who wants to do anything except try it just to see for themselves. I won't go as far as to say I won't drink it ever again, but it would have to be one of a limited selection of big brewery macros, such as Bud Light or Coors, for me to choose it."
"Pours a rather good looking copper with a thick head that retained well. The nose was very yeasty, with some faint hops and a strange sour that wasn't detected on the tongue at all. In addition, the tongue is rather thin, but inoffensive, doesn't set the mouth on fire, but it has a nice bready element, with a bit of a sweet dryness. Very little aftertaste. Not bad, but not great."
"I have had this on tap at the Woody Creek Tavern in Woody Creek, Colorado--the tavern that was Dr. Thompson's lair until his suicide in 2005. It was perhaps fresher on tap and in Colorado."
"Pours a tantalizing deep amber color with a frothy head. Floral hops dominate the aroma with a mellow graininess underneath. Hops come through in the flavor with a nice malty backbone to balance things out. I don't see this as an IPA as noted in some other reviews, I think it's a pretty well crafted pale ale as it states. It's a pretty tasty beer and quite easy to drink. Refreshing on a hot day with it's smooth creamy body."
"Don't you just hate it when your pale ale becomes an IPA right under your nose? Dang it, I was looking for a pale ale. This brew pours an amber color, with minimal head formation. The smell is strongly of hops. The taste is overly hopped for my palate, especially when I am looking for less assertive bitter flavoring. There is a some what tasty citrus note, however. While not a horrific beer by any means, this beverage is not worthy of your hard earned dollar, when in search of a pale ale, when there are ample alternatives out there. As an IPA (which in this case was not wanted by the consumer), rather than a Pale Ale, this review would change ever so slightly, with a .5 increase for both taste and smell. If you enjoy IPAs and you know what you are getting with this in advance, you may want to give this a try."
"Creamy in body and smooth on the palate. This was really a nice pale ale and one that I could drink quite a few of. Recommended."
"Drinkability  Solid pale ale. Nice hops, not monstrous. Simple but seesionable. Definitely worth a shot."
"more edit: take a look at the Standard Deviation on the ratings on this beer. That will give you a good idea of how inconsistent it has been!"
"D: Much better than expected, a nice middle-of-the-road session pale."
"Drinkability: This is one to keep track of as I could easily rip through a few of these without even realizing it."
"Pours a darkish copper with a fairly small head that is retained well and leaves some lacing. Smells of citrus and piney hops with a buttery note in the background. Taste is hoppy, with plenty of floral hop presence and citrusy fruitiness. The finish is very dry, with a slightly sour note that lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel is crisp and rewarding, with the aforementioned dryness in the finish giving it some distinction from most other pale ales, and the drinkability is very good. I'd barely noticed how fast it was going down until it was gone. A classic example of the American-style pale ale."
"Drinkability isn't so great."
"Overall: Nice little pale ale but it just doesn't bring it on. The smell fades quick and the taste fleets pretty fast itself. Wish everything was ramped up a bit because there's simply not much there."
"D - This one does go down nice and smooth. A nice APA for a spring or summer day, nice easy drinker that still can satisfy someone in need of a hop fix."
"Amber in color with a white head that didn't last long, and left specks of lacing. Smell is nice, a good amount of hops in the nose with a sweet malty aroma playing second fiddle. Taste is borderline 4, it's good but after the smell I really expected to be tasting as much as I was smelling, a little disappointed, but still pretty good mind you. A little watery in the mouthfeel, average carbonation and medium body. Pretty drinkable and a nice beer here, I just was left wanting a little more. Try it, it may be just right for you."
"Overall i dont know what to think about htis one. As far as putting numbers on the rating, it's low, but it is one i would gladly drink again. I dont know."
"Classic American Pale Ale look to me consists of a clear amber body, two finger thick foamy head, and lively display of carbonation, and this beer had it. The smell of the beer was a hair more hoppy than the average for the style, although not so much to throw it out of balance. Taste was balanced as well, with toasty sweet caramel and fruity malt and herbal bitter and slightly floral hops. Mouthfeel was medium thick and the aftertaste both bitter and sweet. The beer was very easy to drink, and it would have been no problem to make a session of this, but I only got one bottle in a World Market sampler pack."
"The head didn't last long but the beer is a nice dark amber. The head was ivory while it lasted. The smell is very malty and hoppy. The taste is good, there is a nice fruity sweetness and a hoppy finish. The mouthfeel was very disappointing, it was thin and watery. The carbonation was very light. The drinkability is good, it is very easy to drink."
"Taste is piney, not strong. Theres an ok bitterness and carbonation in the aftertaste. I could session with this real easy. Another good ""bring to a BBQ"" beer."
"Musings: As I mentioned before, too much marketing and not enough time honing the craft. It's decent enough - but could be something much better. This beer is all over the map - no direction and no coordination. I won't be going back anytime soon."
"Mouth feel is a bit watery, but this remains quite a drinkable beer."
"D - This is an excellent choice for chilly night or with burgers or steak. It warmed me right up and left me wanting more."
"Disclaimer: The above remarks seem harsh and they are. Overall this is an average APA. Yet its flaws are pronounced and therefore easy to comment on."
"Drinkability: A pretty good pale ale in all respects. I could certainly find myself making a session of this. There are too many pale ales that just don't have much, and though this isn't outstanding, it certainly has enough to make things interesting while also being good enough for a session, with the right amount of hops and malt seeming to do the right thing."
"Poured a hazy amber with little head that diminished to whitish lacing within a minute. Smells sweetly of caramel and musty hops, taste starts sweeter then the hops take hold and finished slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is light on the tongue and moderately carbonated. Light in taste and body, good session beer, very drinkable."
"Bought a 12 pack mixer from Flying Dog, and to tell you the truth wasn't expecting much, but this beer will definately have me buying more. Had just the right amount of HOPS, not overwhelming but enough to have you satisfied with a pale ale. This made it very easy to have quite a few of these in one sitting."
"I bought this to try it. Now I've tried it. I will not buy it again, and would probably say, ""No thanks, I'll just have water!"" if someone offered it to me for free. Overall, a fairly pretty, decent smelling beer, but when it comes to the tasting, to me it's not quite a drain pour."
"This pours a dark coppery color with a smallish head that disappears quickly.This is alot darker than I expected.This has a nice hoppy floral smell to it.This is a good tasting beer.There is some hoppyness and even some spices with a carmel aftertaste.The m/f is medium to heavy,which I like,but was not expecting.The balance between hop and malt was a slight problem with this beer.This is a good beer that everyone should try."
"The mouthfeel was a bit thin with not very good carbonation. Definitely feels a bit watery. It's decent and drinkable, but not something I'm going to go out and pay extra for when local options are available for less (and luckily tastier)."
"The body is light and has a somewhat watered down taste to it. Decent hop flavors bring it to an average score. This beer is easy to drink but nothing too exciting."
"Dark amber color with a thin head left little lacing on the glass. The smell was definitely very hoppy, like a typical Pale Ale, and the taste had biting hop flavor, malts, yeast, alcohol and bittersweet hints. It was quite carbonated; didn't finish as good as I'd hoped. It was somewhat refreshing, but left me sticking to my guns; tihs is a good Pale Ale but nothing outstanding."
"Overall- slighty better on tap than in the bottle. Not impressed but was drinkable. Amongst 200 beers being served this should not be on your list of beers to try!"
"A nice drinkable Pale Ale, nothing incredible, but I like it."
"the first one i had in the 6 pack seemed to have more flavor. this being the 2/6 im hoping the remainder will be more like the first. we'll see"
"Amber in colour with hints of gold. This particular bottle was WAY over-carbonated. It took over 20 minutes to get all of it into a glass! Nice cascade hop aroma with a bit of malty sweetness drifting in afterwards. Flavors were of bland watered down malts, with little of the hop presence that was apparent from the smell. A real let down."
"Overall, probably the best beer from Flying Dog I've had yet. Has a lot of the same qualities as SNPA although not as vibrant and packing the same load of bitterness. Nevertheless, a pretty decent brew."
"Not too bad, I'd have it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"Pours up with a nice two finger head that sticks around and laces the glass all the way to the bottom. Deep amber hue with golden tints. Smell is vibrant sweet and almost exclusivly hops. The taste is very amazing with a nice sweet taste underneath the hoppy base and finish that I was expecting from this pale. A smooth feel that comes in easy and finishes the same. I want more of this one, the best part is some resturants in the area actually might have it."
"I do not usually like lighter color beers but this one is pretty good. In fact, I like it. It has a very smooth mouthfeel. The drinkability is very good with the absence of a strong aftertaste. The beer is a copper color with a good aroma. I will probably seek this beer out again. I poured it out into a mug and it had a nice thick head that stuck around for a while. A very good beer that caught me my suprise."
"The color is copper with a moderate level of carbonation. The head is average-sized and off white. The aroma consists of a piney hop smell layered over a sweet malt body. A sip starts with a quick dash of citris hop flavor which quickly melds into the stronger malt body. The malt flavor consists of caramel malt flavors with a mild earthy quality. Bitterness comes into play towards the finish, but the malt flavors are what linger on the palate. This is another of the many good APAs out there, not quite as hoppy as expected, but this easily gets the job done. I could easily put back many of these in a session and Doggie-Style is the kind of pale ale that always finds a home in my fridge."
"Drinkability: Certainly drinkable, and if I were seeking an amber, I might like this better; as an APA, it has its demerits"
"Very drinkable, especially for cool weather."
"D: Good session beer."
"This isn't a bad ale, I just look for a bit more character and a bit less sharp bitterness (I am NOT referring to a hoppy bitterness - that would be expected)."
"The body could be a bit thicker, but a nice summer time drink. Liked the drinkablity."
"I decided to purchase this one after seeing it make the #4 spot on Stuff Magazine's top 80 beers from America. It's a good overall beer. All of Flying Dog's beers have a unique appearance- I like that. Medium body, pretty hoppy. Easy to drink. Expensive as hell (at least where I got it- $7.19 for a 6-pack)."
"This beer pours an amber color. The head is almost nonexistent...thus the unimpressed score. The beer smells fruity esters, like berries. The Taste is surprisingly good. Slightly bitter, a very fruity, citrusy hop with a little pine in it. Mouthfeel is light to medium body, and barely astringent. The drinkability is decent. I have always avoided this beer because it has the crazy packaging. Anyway. It is not bad, and is at least worth a try."
"Picked up a sixer this evening for $6.99. Pours clear and golden. Nice head. Citrusy hoppy aroma. Last time I had this beer I swear it did not have the hop punch this batch has. Big time fresh cascade citrusy/grassy flavor. Has just enough residual malt sweetness to keep the hops from completely overpowering this beer. Nice beer, think I'll sit back and have 'nother."
"Im looking at some of my other scores for pale ales, this one matches up well - just a tad expensive at $7.50 a sixer (12 ounces)."
"I found this beer in my fridege left over from my 30th birthday party. The thing that stands out to me is a harsh grassyness from the hops in both the nose and the flavor. The malt come through with caramel, and bready notes. Nothing too special. Just a basic pale ale."
"I recently got a mixture of Flying Dog brews from a friend. I hadn't tried these beers in quite a few years, silly me! This brew is excellent. It comes off like an IPA, though and that's great, for a guy like me. It pours with a golden yellow hue and not too much of a head. It smells light and airy with just a hint of hops. But, when you taste it, wow! There's the hops! Light, soft in body with a lengthy finish, this is a brew that you'll be sure to put down a few! I highly recommend this Pale Ale."
"I shall continue to go back to this one."
"Drinkability - This goes down very easy. If it were more bitter, it would work with foods better, but its lack of bitterness makes it a fabulous session beer. This is very good."
"12 oz bottle decanted into a pint glass. Dark amber in color with very little head to speak of. A small bit of lacing but I would like a little more head to open up the hops. The smell was of terrific citrus hops. A very nice aroma. The taste was nice as well. Nice hop bitterness with again that citrus taste and a touch of hay/grass? Good nevertheless. A nice mouthfeel with the hops sticking around on the back of the tongue and palate for a while. A nice bite to the beer (like a flying dog?). A nice beer that I will definitely try again in the future."
"Overall, not a bad beer. This is an interesting brew. Not overly hopped, but it shows and I've yet to develope that hop taste so points off for that. When it does, I'm sure i'll reevaluate this brew."
"poured an amber color with light tannish head than slowly fell throught the glass. Smell is citrusy with loads of hops noted. Taste is hoppy with nice dry bitterness. Mouthfeel is more of hops and leaves a nice dry bitter feeling. Good drinking beer."
"I'm a pale ale fan, flat out. this is an interesting brew, different from most pale ales i've had. It's not as carbonated as others and has a darker taste. Overall not bad, but there are better in this price range such as Sierra Nevada pale ale and Full Sail pale ale"
"What a delightful beer, especially since it is $5.50/6 pack around here while competing pale ales like SNPA are generally north of $7."
"Medium bodied with a crisp, thirst quenching mouthfeel. Totally sessionable."
"Hard to find fault with this one. Aroma is sweet and fruity with citrus and a bit of malt backing it up. Coppery hued body with a moderate cap of off white head. Good citrucy, piney hop flavor without excessive bitterness. Mouthfeel is a touch lighter than I prefer, but nothing too distracting. Good beer, not too crazy but I could drink a bunch of these in an evening."
"Very drinkable brew. Based on this one, i would love to try more Flying Dog stuff. Would recomend that it is definately worth a try."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is particularly good with this brew because you need to keep swallowing it to get your fill and to truly feel the character. This is right on the edge of being a solid beer. It just needs a bit more meat."
"This is perhaps my favourite of the Flying Dog brand and definitely a beer I will be trying to have in the fridge for a nice hop fix here and there."
"I was overall impressed with the beer and I enjoyed the hoppy flavor. Flying Dog makes a lot of nice, middle of the road beers and I will definately be coming back to this one."
"The color is copper with a foamy head easy to achieve with a standard pour. The aroma is pleasant and slightly fruity. More hop bite than most PAs. A welcomed difference from most APA here in the southeast. It is not up their with SNPA or Liberty for hop bitterness but its in the top ten, IMO. The art work is a little gimmicky but whatever sells their beer works for me!"
"I have reviewed this beer on tap, but the bottle is a different experience. It pours a coppery color, has the aroma of citrusy hops, a little too much carbonation, some lacing, minimum malt middle, and HOPPY aftertaste. It compares with many IPA's, but is a little too over hopped to go well with food."
"Pours amber orange, with a smallish white head, ok lacing. A little malt, a touch of hops, and very little else. An average pale ale at best. Finishes dry and slightly bitter. I found it a bit watery and lacking in flavour in every category. Neat looking label though."
"Pours a very light small head, which disappears quickly. There are laces left throughout the whole beer as you continue drinking. It pours a light orange amber color. Slight malt scent and strong hops. The flavor is bursting with hops, but is not overpowering. The hops are flavorful and dry. Great beer for pale ale drinkers."
"One of the classic APA's. Looks golden to orange and pours a loose knit head. High carbonation and descent head retention. Smells nicely blended of hops and malt. Slight spicyness in the nose. Tastes well balanced with the flavoring hops and sweet malts. Caramelly and crisp. Bittering hops increase through the body. Finishes bitter and tart without drying. A good thirst quencher. Bold enough to stand in any season."
"I consider myself to be a hops lover but this was too much. At one point I found myself actually removed from the beer drinking experience and transported into a hops consuming experience. The hops are so dominating that the rest of the tastes are completely overpowered. I have a couple more in the fridge so I will try then again and see if I experience the same phenomenon."
"This tasted more like a hefeweizen than a pale ale. Hopefully I was unlucky and got an old bottle (the bottle says 235A05 whatever that means), but the flavour here seemed to be dominated by yeast rather than malt or hops. The hops became apparent after a while, but yeast was the overwhelming player."
"I thought is was really hard to screw up a pale ale. most are at least average tasting. I've tried this beer twice now with the same result. A sub-par beer, not alot to say about it."
"Drinkability: An average Pale Ale, if it's the same price as Goose and Sierra, I'd choose those over this."
"From notes. Poured deep copper color with a 1 fnger head that fell to coat the brew. The nose was sweet caramel with a nice sweet citrusy hop that smelled very nice. The flavor was full of nice, crisp hops that were slightly citrusy. There was a sight metallic aftertaste that was not to my liking. The feel was moderate with a nice active carbonation. Overall, this was better than remembred. Easy drinking and crisp. No problem for me to drink a few of these."
"On tap poured into a Flying Dog pint glass. It pours a medium copper color with two fingers of head. There's a bit of lacing left down the sides of the glass. The smell has mostly hops coming through, with just a little bit of malt character. It doesn't jump out at you too much. The taste is very well balanced. It's nice and malty up front, and the finish has the perfect dose of hops for a pale ale. The mouthfeel is decent for a pale, and the drinkability is great. I enjoyed this one."
"This makes me interested in trying their other brews."
"All in all, this is a pretty good pale, one I'd definitely buy again. This would be a nice break from SNPA and similar pales, as well as from the bigger beers of the season."
"Pours out amber with a nice off-white headskie. The great hoppy flavor is quite smooth too... Malt balance is there and quite pleasant. This is actually a good beer! Smooth and tastey. I won't think twice about having another. (That much can't be said for some of the other Flying Dog brews.)"
"The taste is very fitting of the classic APA mold. I found it very refreshing after recently having a few APAs I wasn't particularly fond of. The initial drink shows of a brown sugary, caramel malt character followed by a mild to medium hops bitterness in the finish paired with a piney, fruity after taste. Quite refreshing to swish about the palate. This is session beer potential, but I am sure there are other fallback APAs I would choose ahead of this. Worth a try, or two, or three."
"The flavors blend poorly; an uninteresting beer that sadly grows less interesting the more is drunk."
"Drinkability and Overall: Flying Dog brew pretty much all seem to have that yeast flavor that's way too out of control. It takes what could've been an excellent APA and turns it into a mediocre beer."
"Drinkability is also very average, no reason to seak out this drab beer."
"A nice amber beer with a white head. It screams hops as you pour it in a glass. It has a nice citrusy, floral nose and a bit of sweet malts in the background. The flavor profile is the same... Tons of hops that cover up a bready maltiness. I am impressed by this Pale Ale and it is definitely fighting for room in my refrigerator."
"Pours an amber color. Head retention is very good. The head sticks all over the glass. Aroma is very balanced. The hops come oout very strong as well as the malt. The taste is fairly balanced. The hops stick out more than the malts. There is a mild pine flavor that comes from the hops. The malts are sweet tasting. Flying Dog do a good job of balancing the flavor. Over all this is great session beer. No flavor is overdone."
"Overall, not too bad."
"This is a very good pale ale. I'd love to try it in a flight of pale ale to see where it would place. I believe I'd put this near the top."
"About a year ago this date, I was urged to try this out by a pregnant girl who felt someone needed to consume one. Even though I though my expectations would too high, I feel this is the best tasting pale ale in my books. Little carbonation or lacing. Apeared a bit darker than most American Pale Ales. I bit pricey in the grocery store, paid $2.50 a bottle at a pizza place tonight."
"They call it a classic and I agree that it is a classic cross between an american pale and an english. It has a wonderful copper color with a rich deepness that says drink me. The well balanced head soon gives way but not without leaving you with memories of a well that runs deep. Nice hop overtones with just the right amount of malt. The first impression is of boldness. Soon you relaize that this beer is bold and smooth. What a great product, one that I always look forward to drinking with friends."
"For me, this isn't a beer I'd have more than one of in a sitting. The finish is a bit too much for my tastes."
"This Flying Dog offering poured an nice amber color with a modest off-white head with lots of lacing. It had a slightly hoppy nose with some hints of citrus. The hop character was weak for an APA but there is a little more maltiness than expected, which limits the bitterness somewhat. The citrus flavor continued in the taste. I was not greatly impressed with this offering. It was a rather bland effort. It is sort of like an APA light."
" A nice Pale Ale, love that piney-bud smell."
"Can't believe I've not reviewed this beer yet. Comes in a 12oz bottle with cool artwork. Pours an amber color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a floral hop smell and an interesting citrus character. Has a strong hop flavor at the beginning and a somewhat weak caramel background."
"Not exactly typical of the style, but a nice change of pace to the Sierra Nevada copycats out there. A solid ale IMO. I know that this one isn't for everyone, but it suits my tastebuds just fine. Probably my favorite offering from Flying Dog."
"The alcoholic content actually tastes higher than it is. Still, this remains pretty drinkable."
"Drinkability - these disappear like popcorn. It's a lighter pale ale, excellent for an intro to the style. A poor mouthfeel holds it back a bit but it's still a solid drinker."
"pours a decent but not great amber colour with a sticky but fairly small head. looks like this ones gonna be a bit thin overall. the smell is nice: mostly hop (more than expected) and some spice, with a bit of biscuit/bread as well. the flavour is quite nice, being a bit juicy and hoppy, with some floral and sweet fruit notes here and there. my main problem that i see as holding this brew back is that it's very thin, to the point where it seems very watery at times. this seems to be a problem with most, if not all, of the flying dog brews that i have had. that said, this is a flavourful brew that is basic but enjoyable, and it has a moderate hop kick that's quite unexpected. give it a whirl."
"Wasn't impressed with this one, but I will try another bottle in the near future and update my review if necessary."
"I haven't been all that impressed with Flying Dog in the past, but this beer and their Scottish Porter are worthy of occasional purchases."
"The beer poured a soft amber with nearly no head at all. Thus, no lace formed on the glass. The hops were kind of strong for a pale ale, almost pale ale like. Hints of citrus hung around the beer. Both in the flavor and in the finish were notes of orange and lemon. The malts were a nice compliment to the hops as well."
"This amber colored brew did not pour much of a head and leaving no lacing. Smell is of bread, floral hops, and citrus. Taste is well balanced between the malts and hops with a smooth citrusy hop finish. Mouthfeel is fair for an APA although it is not as lively on the tounge as I hoped. But the overall drinkability of this beer is very good as this beer can go with most spicy foods or quite well by itself."
"Pours a positively orange hue. Head retention leaves something to be desired. Smell is hoppy, as expected. Taste grew on me. More hop bite on the after than initial taste. Quite sweet, and carbonation plays on the tongue. A subtle beer, good for inspiring creativity. A good take on the pale ale style."
"Pours a clear deep-amber body with orange highlights beneath a creamy cap of off-white that holds well but leaves little lace. The nose delivers an excellent blend of biscuity and caramelish malts and citrusy, piney and floral hops. The body is medium and it's lightly zesty on the tongue. The flavor bristles with piney and citrusy hops upfront; softens across the middle as more malt comes out; and finishes with biscuity and caramelish malt followed by a solid, lingering bitterness. A decent enough American pale ale that works well with food, but somehow seems to lack the finesse needed to lend it any greater drinkability."
"I found the finish, leaving me smacking my lips form the hops flavor, particularly enjoyable. Go I am a sucker for Pale Ales!"
"Still a really good pale ale, but not something that I'll be likely to list as one of my favorites."
"I was afraid to try any of the Flying Dog Beers for the longest time, figuring that the beer inside couldn't possibly be as cool as the labels. How wrong I was..."
"Bottle: Poured a medium red colored beer with a nice head with medium retention. Aroma is quite nice with floral hops. Taste is even nicer with a hops heavy taste leaving a quite important bitter finish. Could have profited of more spice and a bit less hops; I believe taste would have been more subtle and complex. I find this to be very similar to North Stock Red Seal Ale. Im still looking forward to trying more products from the Flying Dog Brewery."
"I've recently come to the conclusion that I'm beginning to love pale ales, and the 6 pack of Doggie Style that I managed to finally pick up seems to have driven this home. That stunning copper body turns me on every time, and Doggie Style has plenty of it, a clear bright copper colour. Decent off-white head on the pour, which sinks down to a very thin cap to about halfway through the glass. Bold citrusy cascade hops on the nose, only the faintest bit of malt in the background fighting to get at least a limb in the picture. On the flavour profile the malt stays in the background as well, a base for the grassy, citrus sweetness of the hops. Mouthfeel is thinner than I had anticipated, but the carbonation adds a bit of extra body in compensation for that, while it becomes more oily on the finish. The finish is refreshing though, a very quenching and satisfying experience. Plus I'm a sucker for the Ralph Steadman labels as well. This is definitely a fine session ale, it's just a shame it's so expensive up here in Alberta ($15 Can. for 6!)."
"I highly recommend this ale."
"Notes: This is a good beer, but not quite as balanced as others that I would prefer to keep in my fridge. Definately give it a shot, but don't expect to find a favorite."
"I'm not a pale ale fan, but I like this one. It is somewhat mild in the hop department, though that is the first sensation that hits your tongue followed by a really nice smooth sweet finish that leaves you wanting another sip. I've tried all of Flying Dog's stuff, and this is one of the better offerings."
"Actually a pretty good beer. I little too hoppy to balance against the malt, but a very drinkable and enjoyable beer."
"Sidenote: There is also a variety 12 pack available. Apparently this is a random selection of Flying Dog brews. I passed because a) I like to know what I'm buying, and b) I could see that at least four of the beers were their wheat, which I have no interest in."
"Very drinkable, especially for fans of pales or IPAs."
"Beer is good. Happy draught beering."
"This just arrived in BC. liqour stores and I must say that this is truly a hoppy pale ale that tastes like an IPA. The head is big and long lasting and the colour is dark gold but the real pleasure is to be found in the fantastic PNW hop nose. The beer tastes big and bold but with balance and finesse. I see this as a classic example of what makes New World Pale Ales a hoppy delight."
"4.5 out of 5 swills."
"Nice piney hop aroma overtop a solid malt base. Foamy dirty cream colored head has a decent amount of stick. Clear orange amber colored beer with a few slow moving tiny bubbles moving through it. Caramel malty flavor is solid, hoppy tea flavor makes a run for the front but ends up pulling even with the malt for a sweat tea finish. Hardly a bitter beer, body is middle of the road. I haven't had too many pale ales like it, I'm thinking more British style as it's pretty balanced. From what I've had so far Flying Dog beers tend to be mild and they did a good job with this one."
"there's not a lot going on with the malt, so when the decent hops flavor gives ground, all that's really left is the bitterness. As much as I enjoy hops, I like them best in a combination, not solo. On the surface, the hops make it drinkable, but with plenty of better, more balanced, options available to me, I'm not strongly inspired to do so. With not enough malt for an IPA, and more hops than most PA's, it struggles to find an identity. I can enjoy it fairly well, but it's not the love of my life."
"The deep amber ale forms a fair white head when poured into a glass. The inviting cascade aroma hints at the flavor profile. The dry ale's flavor is dominated by dry hopped cascade on a thin but roasted malt backbone. It's a drinkable, but unexciting pale ale."
"Wet leather malt sweetness in the smell. A rather dark look in the glas for a pale ale.. light red in color. Pale white head with a tinge on pinkness. Quite sticky and lasting. Initial taste is hoppy/orange rind but this then leaves the tongue and you get a wash of watery thin slightly sweet malt base. There is also a metalic finish to the brew as well (tin). Thin mouth. Not balenced on the ratio to hops and malt backbone."
"DRINKABILITY: Lacking the 'stickiness' of most West Coast pale ales, Flying Dog is little more than a representation of the style. Is it horrible? Absolutely not. Unfortunately, the answer is the same if you ask me if I'm going to go looking for it again."
"A friend of mine bought a six pack of this on a whim and luckily he didn't enjoy it too much, so that means it's my job to dispose of it and dispose of it i will. It poured an orangish/amber color with a lingering white head. Smell was very citric. Ok, just nothing spectacular. Taste is a little hoppy but there was a bit of sweetness creeping up on the finish. Mouthfeel is decent as is drinkability. This beer is alright, will i have have it again? Who knows, but it doesn't pain me to take this off of my friend's hands."
"This beer is golden with small bubbles, carbanation is perfect. The beer has a medium thick white head thats lasts a long time. The aroma is very sweet from the malts and the hops is sweet as well. For flavor the malt is sweet just like you would think from the aroma. The hops is a solid bitternes as if you were drinking an ESB. Over all this beer is very tasty."
"Pours to a frothy off-white head with rich amber-copper color. Leaves bits of foam on the glass. Aroma is decidedly Cascades hops, bread and crystal malt. Flavor is a balance of dry maltiness and tangy American hops. Finishes with a nice blend of pleasing hop bitterness and slightly toasty malt. I have to admit that the beer I am reviewing appears to be past its prime ( I see protein floaties in it) but I can tell that it is a well made beer by how well its character holds up to age and brutal Oklahoma handling."
"-Oelergud"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed an inch tall off-white head with large bubbles. Amber, brew, average lacing present. Great malty sweetness in the nose, with hops right there as well. Flavor pretty much follows the aroma's lead, and is very pleasant, although it seems that there could be a bit more substance to the mouthfeel. However, it's a pale ale, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. Drinkability is excellent, having trouble not just downing it right away. Looking forward to the rest of the mix pack."
"Definitely a drinkable brew, not the best EPA but definitely something to keep on hand, my favorite of the flying dog brews."
"I'd have to say that this is better than I thought it would be, with much more of a hop presence than I would've expected. A nice solid little pale ale, ranking in just slightly under Sierra Nevada in my personal taste. I can imagine this being a nice little session brew, especially accompanied by some spicy food."
"It's drinkable but it seems to be under flavored."
"Deep copper color, hazy, with a small tan head. Has a nose that is floral, hoppy, and fruity. Very sweet smelling. Pretty blande for a pale ale. The initial maltiness shifts almost instantly to it's mild hop bitterness. Does have a fullmouthfeel, but this isn't one of my favorite PA's by any means. Good, at best."
"The pscho(delic?) labels were drawn by the artist who did the artwork on the books of Dr Hunter S. Thompson(Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas). This pours a clear, copper, amber with a medium sized head that has good retention. Globs of foam lace the glass. Floral hops flood the nose with lilacs, orangerind, and pine. Mouthfeel is alive with carbonation and has a moderate citrus/pine hop bite on the tongue. Taste is grapefruit and pinecone hoppiness, which ride all over the top of the underlying sweet caramel malt. Good balance overall. A very drinkable and crisp Colorado IPA. Try it, you'll like it."
"on tap at the Brazen head in Brooklyn, NY. Pours a nice auburn with tiny bubble, leaving medium amt. of lacing. Nice hop nose, piney, citrus. Smooth malty mouthfeel, nice hop bit tells you this is an american IPA. Citrus, grapefruit, resin. Nice job, nice and fresh --on tap cant be beat!"
"Definitely worth purchasing again, and next time it will not be for the kick-ass label, but for the kick-ass beer"
"Alcohol by Volume: 5.3%"
"Tastes good but without all the frills that make it a top shelfer."
"Copper color with minimal head. The lacing was nice though and made up for the lack of head. Strong aroma of citrus hops and a bit of a floral smell. Quite appealing to the nose. The taste was a well balanced pale ale with a good presence of hops and a fresh clean feeling in my mouth. Really a solid beer with a good lingering aftertaste of hops. Excellent drinkability something I'd buy again."
" Nice fruit flavor without getting bitter or into the strong grapefruit flavor. If you see in on draft, give it a try."
"After drinking Molson for two days I needed a break. It was time to open a Doggie Style. A clear amber colour with decent head and good retention. Fruity aromas fill the air with citric scented hops. The taste also had a fruity feel to it. The hops were strong, but not overbearing. The aftertaste was a hoppy bitterness."
"The taste is absolutely lovely. The hops are beautifully balanced, but that's only part of the appeal. It's also exceptionally crisp; it refuses to sit still on my tongue. After the initial woody/nutty flavor, the hops come in and dance around. They playfully wind in and out, one moment stealing the spotlight and the next passing behind the woodiness. The finish is slightly metallic. As an added bonus to finishing the pint, the interior of the glass is covered with speckled, spastic lacing. The unremarkable mouthfeel is the only thing about this beer that's not outstanding."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It started off good, with only above average taste. Not enought hops. But after it warmed up a little you got a good Cascade hops finish to this beer. I'm not convinced this brew merits the overall 4 I have given it, but it is definitely solid and drinkable. Very enjoyable. Plus, I couldn't find any flaws. Not the greatest pale ale I've ever had, but a decent American version."
"Easy to drink with a nice creamy mouthfeel. I like this one a lot!"
"This pale ale has a mellow finish and little aftertaste. Definitely drinkable, but the flavor is somewhat dull compared to the aroma picked up by the nose. Overall a decent pale ale, but the hop level needs to be a bit higher."
"Clear light copper color, decent size white foamy head, light bready and citrus aromas, balanced malt and hop flavors. Light to medium body with a watery and somewhat thin mouthfeel, finishes with a mild bitterness, very average and middle of the road pale ale."
"Pours a golden amber with hops bouquet that fills the air while pouring. Nice small head with some lacing the smell is wonderful. Sweet citrus with fresh pine forest scent. Wizard needs air wick in this fragrence. Taste is refreshing with hops dominating the flavor but not much in the way of bitterness. This is a wonderful pale ale, if it was readily available to me I would swear off of Sierra Nevadas Pale Ale."
"Reddish-amber with a bit of an off-white head, quite high carbonation levels. Hops dominate the aroma, and it came as no surprise that the flavour too would also feature hops in prominence; a slight toffee sweetness also found its way through. Not bad, except the beer seemed a bit too gassy for perfection. The label on the bottle can only be described as bizarre."
"maybe i just don't favor pale ales but i did not like this beer at all. they went too far with the hops."
"A clear amber color, topped by a tan head. There is a hoppy slightly piney, slightly citrusy aroma. There is a hint of malt under the hoppy aromatics as well. Nicely bitter up front in the mouth. There is a light maltiness in the finish. The beer is a bit too cold at first, so I warm it up for a bit. The hop flavor is a mix of piney, & orange/ citrusy. Finishes with a good pale ale level of bitterness. There is an after taste here that I cannot quite pin down, it is part of the hop flavor. Perhaps a hint of menthol in the finish, along with a bit of grassy hop flavor. This is a good solid example of an American Pale ale."
"Poured out a clear and bright amber color with a thin head. Nice delicate lacing left on the glass. There is some fruitiness in the aroma, along with lemony hops. Taste is light and flavorful, with some fruits coming through including apples, cherries and orange. Nice sour tang in the finish. This is an above average pale ale. Light and drinkable. I enjoyed this beer."
" Ive found this beer to be a bit more ballsy and fuller bodied on tap. Still, a pretty dam good Pale Ale."
" A decent pale ale that just fails to stand out. I would rather just go local."
"Poured a nice amber color with a small head but good lace. Smell is hops although not a huge hop aroma for a pale ale. Taste was very hoppy and bitter, too much for a pale ale. This is more like an IPA not a Pale ale, at least that is what I think. It really has a mild hop aftertaste though - very enjoyable. It finishes a bit dry. If they renamed it as an IPA I think it would be a good example of that style. It is still a slightly better than average brew - I think its just named wrong. Worth trying."
"Zum wohl!"
"Not a bad session beer. Manages to be refreshing. A bit too tart for my taste, and a bit too sharp, but not a bad beer for all that."
"Honey colored with an off-white receding head. Call me crazy, and it has nothing to do with the name, but it really has an aroma of wet dog. I'm not kidding. Also some hops in the nose, but really, it's wet dog. Flavor is hops and sweet malt, with hints of sweet pear. Also a hoppy finish with flowery notes. Very tasty, but what is up with that smell?"
"This beer was a golden, almost yellow color. There was a fair amount of a white head to it. The aroma and taste were both somewhat thin. There was some hop bitterness in the aftertaste, but not enough to really make it a Pale Ale. Definitely a dog."
"Not a great pale ale, but a servicable one. The obvious name aside, I don't know if this would be one I'd have again...maybe if I saw it around somewhere."
"Oh yeah, really like this dog."
"Note: Head to head comparison with Full Sail Pale and Town Hall Columbus Pale."
"Drinkability  This went down exceptionally well. Im impressed."
"Light orange gold color. Medium Head. Aroma is malty and floral. A lighter bodied pale ale. Hoppy without being too bitter. Somewhat fruity and floral. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, with some staying power. Some sweetness in aftertaste. Very drinkable beer."
"rich reddish amber color with a tan head. odd smelling beer in that the malt is so evident, smells almost like raw malt extract. slight hops come though as well. has aan almost pumpkin pie smell, which i can't say i mind. malt flavor comes through big here, not so much sweetness though, the hops hit at the end. hops bitterness is present but hardly any taste. it's strange, but enjoyable. good mouthfeel. overall not bad, i'll have it again"
"Wow, every once in awhile a beer creeps up on you this one sure did to me. Not expecting anything maybe cause I have never heard great things about Flying Dog, but regardless let's set the record straight here this is a good beer. Appears a copper amber tone with an off white cream colored head which leaves ample arrays of even lacing around my pint. Aromatics oh so nice buttered hop aroma with the pine scented earthy variety very nice definitely appeals to my sense of smell. Flavor is hoppy bit not a bitter unappealing hoppiness, perfect blend of the floral citrus hops mixed with a silky smooth sweetness that has texture and adds a warming quality to the brew. Mouthfeel is completely smooth and buttery with this medium bodied excellent pale ale. Oh yes the drinkability factor is kicked up a few notches because it hits me right at every angle of the beer nothing turns me off from wanting another one of these lucious nectars very good session brew I would like to have on cask."
"I really don't understand the reviews this beer has been getting. Despite an amusing winged dog on the label, I found the beer to be absolutely disgusting. In addition to the foul taste, this is one of those rare beers that really, truly, smells bad. Not to be drank under any circumstances."
"Copper colored ale with a thinnish cream head that shows some retention. The aroma is very malty with a nice caramel note and a bit of fruity sweetness. The taste is rather light, with a slight malt sweetness that is bathed in bitterness. A slight citric acidity becomes apparent on the finish. Mouthfeel is sort of middle of the road, and drinkability is decent, due in part to the overall lack of authority in the beer's character. Great artwork on the label and six-pack holder, though."
"This brew poured a medium sized head of small to medium sized off-white mostly lasting bubbles that left a fair lacing. Its body is a carbonated transparent amber brown and its aroma is a hoppy malt mixture. It has an initial hoppy bite with a mild malt spice finish. I would have like for it to have a bit more character, but its not bad for a pale ale."
"This beer poured a large creamy off-white head with small-medium sized bubbles that was long lasting. The body was clear with a lot of carbonation observed and the hue was orange. The nose was citrusy and hoppy. There was excellent lacing on the sides of my glass. The flavor was very hoppy and it was very bitter tasting from start to finish. The mouthfeel was tingly, thin and watery."
"On draught at Lazy Chameleon in Powell, OH. Amber color with a thin light beige head. Little lacing is evident. Aroma of hops and a little pine. Medium body, with a lightly spiced hop flavor that fades much too quickly. There are shades of malt as well. The finish is decently hopped, and I think this would be a better brew if it had more staying power."
"Maybe I just picked up a bad bottle or something..but this was not good..Its safe to say I will stick to Full Sail Pale or SNPA when in the mood for a pale."
"However, would like to meet the rest of the litter....and I will!"
"The beer pours a dark golden/light amber color. The head comes strong and finishes with a pretty lace. The aroma is of hops and nothing else. The smell is floral and pleasant. The taste is not bad. There's a nice hoppy flavor and a bit of malty richness to it. The beer goes down smooth, but is far from light. There is a medium body here. It's a good drinking beer, but not a gusler. You need to take time to enjoy this one. One of their better brews."
"Nice appearance....dark gold...small head with some lingering lace. Decent hoppy smell, which suggests the taste. Taste is good......has a bit of bite and aftertaste, but still refreshing. Mouthfeel is ok,,,,but nothing special. Goes down smooth enough, but aftertaste wasn't the best. Great bottle though. Part of a 12 pack of assorted brews which I will sample later in the evening. Good price too! Decent choice."
"The 'Doggie Style' was my first experience with the Flying Dog Brewery and I was not impressed, but definitely not disappointed. Poured a light to medium golden with a decent head. Aromas are hoppy and earthy, very pleasant. The taste reflects the smell, although its nothing that hasn't been done before. The earthy feel reminds me of a saison which appeals to me, but an unplaceable aftertaste leaves me anxious for something different to clease my palate."
"Awesome looking appearance.Wondefrul color with a nice pour delivered by a froaming white head.The color is clear amber with bubbling carbonation.A well-balanced aroma of hops and malt.Spotty traces of white lace left.Well-balanced taste also,with the hops,bitterness,and malt all equal in taste.A sweet lemon and honey taste that goes down smooth.Accompanied by a crisp mouthfeel.High drinkability percent with this above average Pale Ale.This one surprised me."
"12 oz bottles. Poured a dark amber, with a moderate head, that didn't stick around long. Light tracings of lace left behind. Aroma of hops, sweetness, and malt. This is my first beer from the Flying Dog Brewery, and I must say it is very good. Not too much bitterness, just enough to balance out the sweetness. An over all good beer."
"Pours with a deep head and has a light brown color. Taste: Crisp hops flavor and roasted malt, combination. Finishes with an excellent aftertaste. Very vibrant on the tongue, where the taste first greet this drink. From the tongue, the cheeks are next in line. This would be an excellent beer served with a great, grilled steak."
"Pale orange with a very thin dissolving head. Hoppy and somewhat musky aroma. Cascade hops and citrus flavor off the top, some grapefruit and orange peel notes. Rather thin in the body, yet somewhat bitter and just a touch dry. Great character, well done, a great session PA."
"Pours a nice reddish color with a lovely foamy head. Wonderful smells arise from this brew, citrus and floral flavors are very present. The flavor of the beer is great, very hoppy yet tame at the same time, it is heavy on the hops and citrus, with a slight malt and spice aftertaste. This is a very drinkable beer, goes down smooth, and easy. Definately something i would buy again."
"It was 5.99 for a 6 pack, figured what the heck. Pours out a nice amber and is pretty impressive looking. smells like hops and boy does it taste like hops. i like it. It is decently bitter which i like, it finishes a little dry which i also like. citrus hops, raw and up front, clean lightly caramel like malt and an overall refreshing character. crisp in the mouth and damn tastey. this is a PA that may be a bit intense for some, but it is damn good for those of us who like a good hop fix now and again."
"First of all, this beer was served a little cold for me. As I poured this beer, I observed 2 things. First, this beer is a little dark for a pale, and second there is not much for head. The aroma did have a lot of the hop profile in it, but was on the weak side of a pale ale. The taste was not enjoyable to me, I had a hard time finishing this one. Hops strained there way to reach my tongue, leaving my taste buds crawling for more hops. Not a beer that I will be having again."
"For me, this was a great find. I got Flying Dog's ""mixed litter"" sampler. So far, so good. Four of the 12 bottles were the pale ale. That pissed me off at first, but realizing how good this one is, I'm now quite content."
"Overall: A good summer beer. Refreshing, but satisfying. You like hops? You'll like this. I found that one did the trick; maybe you'll need a couple."
"Pours a nice crystal clear honey tone with a nice head that, as seems to be the case with the other Flying Dogs I've had, fades away quickly. Smell is malt and then sweet, wonderful hops. The taste follows suit nicely with a nice finish. Great session beer."
"Woah! Mucho Cascade in the nose, along with a little sweetish malt and some roasted grains. The front is hoppy, sure, but I'd have guessed that there's something other than Cascades in there (slight tobacco). The middle is caramel malty, with some chocolate at warmer temperatures. The finish is bitter, fresh and again, there's some creamy cocoa at temp. I put off buying Flying Dog for quite a while, but I've been pleasantly surprised. These aren't the best brews out there, but they're at least in the ballpark."
"Copper in color with an off-white head that leaves excellent lacing. The aroma is malty, and fruity. The flavor starts out fruity, then it flows to a malty, dry, bitter hop finish. It is a light-medium bodied brew that is easy drinking. It is not too bad, but nothing really beckons me to drink it again."
"Comes out looking good. A nice amber color, not much of a head on this guy. Smells like a garden when its cracked open, a nice blend of hops and citrusy smells. Not the best pale ale in the world, but definately a fine drink. Give it a go if youre looking to try this one out."
"A nice Pale Ale and better than some examples I have had lately. More body than most, slight fruity yeasty taste. My only complaint were the hops, I just couldn't find anything that struck me here as bitter, floral, etc. A good beer if I couldn't find any other APAs that interested me."
"Poured a bright clear golden amber with a fine white head. The carbonation bubbled for some time after the beer was poured. The aroma was very light and mostly malt. I might have gotten just a whiff of hops, maybe. The taste was to subtle for style. The hop bitterness did not stand out particularly but there was a fair amount of citrus taste and bite. A small amount of malt sweetness can be tasted in the finish. The mouthfeel was light and the carbonation played with tongue. This is a good session beer. I could sit and drink this beer all night telling lies with my friends."
"Can find these pretty easily here in Greensboro,I think pretty muan average American pale ale.Kind of a darker orange color medium head that went fast,smelled pretty zesty maybe like a northwestern style pale ale.Taste was fruity and hoppy I would have liked a little more balance."
"Finish was real quick and was mostly fresh drying cascades."
"Nice amber color when poured, decent head and nice lace all the way down the glass. Light malty aroma and decent hop bite - slightly fruity and a good finish. A good example of a pale ale, very drinkable to me at least. Though it's not the best that I've had, it's by far from the worst. Plus I like the label art too - fwiw."
"There was some bitter malty undertones in the flavor, followed by a nice, but not overpowering touch of hops. This is definitley an easy drinker, and the 6-pack I had disappeared very quickly. Cool name too."
"Bright, frothy head, amber color. Aroma: full-on citrus, and precious little else. Smooth, easy-drinking, and, dammmit, if I can ever think of anything else to recommend this one by. It's fine, and forgetabble, and it's got that great Ralph Steadman art going for it...sigh...it's okay...I geuss..."
"Crystal clear copper hue, topped by a vanilla white, fluffy well retained head. Loose lace remains. Soft, citrusy hops w/ soapy tinge, along with mild biscuit and light caramel malt in aroma. Trace pearish fruity esters. Bland wash of non descript caramel malt sweetness at first in flavor, ensued by token biscuit and bready base malt notes. Subdued floral hop flavor runs parallel with generic caramel malt. Mild hop bitterness emerges mid palate, offsetting residual sweetness, lending a balanced but uninspired overall character. Lightly bodied and approaching watery. Finishes dry and nearly bland, with hints of worty graininess briefly lingering. Although clean, Doggie Style is a prosaic and insipid pale ale. The apparent excessive filtration has stripped it of character. Decent drinkablity."
"Beer of the month time again, and this time half of it was from Flying Dog Brewery. Doggie Style is a orange red color and had a thick off-white head with good retension. Slight floral aroma. This is a very good representation of the style, with only a slight hoppy bite in the aftertaste. Nothing special, but a good buy nonetheless."
"There isn't anything unique about this beer, but it looks and tastes like a standard pale. It didn't have any strong hop flavor or aroma, but some might still consider this a pale. It had a pretty typcial malt flavor, and if I'm not coming across very well, it just doesn't stand out. This beer would be a good summer beer for drinking while playing croquet or throwing lawn darts. Really though, the label really looks like an advertisement you'd find in a sporting periodical."
"Drinkability: I'm still a hop-head, so these beers are my favorites to drink. The hop flavors are not overboard and the ABV make for an easy-drinking brew."
"I'm beginning to notice a trend in all Flying Dog brews. They're like that real pretty girl of the most respected, upstanding sorority from your college. They look good, they smell good, but ultimately they don't deliver. This brew pours a medium orange-red amber with a rocky cream colored head. The aroma makes your mouth water....loads of grapefruit, pineapple, and pine. In other words...Cascade! The taste is pretty good too...and dominated by all that lovely hops, but it could use a bit more malt for balance. This malt deficiency is also detrimental to the mouthfeel...just a tad too watery. Given the relatively low ABV, this would make a good session pale ale. I've been pretty critical, and this is not a bad brew, but with the sheer number of different PA's in America alone in mind, and how some of them set the bar, this one just comes up a little short, considering the playing field."
"This beer pours a clear copper tea-like color with a nice eggshell colored head. The smell is a raw bread dough and yeast type aroma along with a light fruity twang. The taste consists of a light fruity hop bite, roasted malt, and finishes with a citrus twang. It is light-bodied and the mouthfeel finishes just slightly on the dry side. This is not the best example of a pale ale, but it is a pretty nice brew. Cheers!"
"Pours a slightly orange medium amber color with a nice white head that quickly fades into a patchy and sticky lace. Nose is sweet malts and floral hops with some notes of fresh citrus. Taste is dominated by a citrus hop flavor with additional notes of sweet grains and a bit of a woody flavor and a hint of fruit. A very crisp and refreshing brew. Probably my favorite offering from the Flying Dog Brewery."
"Translucent, amber-coppery hue. Tiny, bubbly whitish head with poor retention, good lace. The nose is ideal for an APA, subtle citrusy hops with a solid malt foundation. Straightforward yet restrained hops initiate the flavors on the palate, malt works well, nice balance. Slightly sticky finish, Id prefer it to be drier. A smidge thin. This is a very solid and likeable beer, Id drink it again."
"Clear as a bell orange/amber, orangish creamy head as well. Citric aromas, a little sense of perspiration as well (some funk)...Flavor is slightly tepid, sweet and tangerine notes duking it out. Cuts to watery mid mouth and finishes with bitter rind hops, but not that tangy. Carbonation is pretty low. Some similarities to an orange pekoe tea here, and unlike some Ales, it doesn't improve as it warms toward 50 degrees F. OK beer, I'm not a fan."
"Deep amber pour with an ivory colored head that lingers long and leaves a thick lace. Looks great. Citrus hoppy aroma and sweet maltiness come through. Taste is sweeter than expected at first then the hop bitterness comes through. Slight woodsy taste and aroma. Crisp and clean mouthfeel with good carbonation. Overall a good brew. I can't wait to try some of their other offerings."
"My second Flying Dog beer, and I note again that it has a listed ABV to more than one decimal place, which I distrust immensely. What are they trying to say by doing this? It is almost as though the technical specification, image and label of the beer is much more important than the taste of the beer itself. I do wonder. Its a real shame as well, because for all the people it attracts  I can see that the label will also put people off buying it because they may think it is a bullshit image beer!! Sad, because this beer is not, it is a perfectly good beer, whilst not the greatest American Pale Ale that I have ever had, it is solid, and certainly above average Pale Ale."
"The choice is yours."
"On the pour the beer is a deep translucent amber color with a monumental very light tan head that is creamy in texture and the residual lace a thick mat to coat the glass. Nose is malt and lightly floral with a nice fruit sweetness, start being sweet with a fair to middling malt profile, the top rather thin. Finish is moderately acidic and the hops pleasing in their spicy bite, the aftertaste droughty, overall a drinkable beer but seems a bit thin to me."
"This was the first beer I tried from this Co.  For going in blind, not too bad.  It has a nice amber/copper color in the bottle, but pours golden amber.  It leaves a nice head and a lace to match.  It smelled of very hoppy (floral hops) and citrusy. Upfront, the taste is sweet and malty. Floral, and hops linger at the back of the tongue to the last drop."
"hop sandwhich in a bottle!  pours out a deep amber color with a big head and lots of lace that sticks and sticks.  aroma of sharp piney hops, some malt peeks out too.  tastes almost like an IPA with the hop load drowning out the sweet maltiness. kind of a ""nothing"" finish, but a big full mouthfeel lets you know that this beer is worth it's weight in hops.  not particularly balanced by any means, but if you're into northwest hops, this is a must try."
"This beer pours a clear copper-orange color and the carbonation is evident upon observing the beer.  A nice off-white head mounts the body of this beer and has a sticky presence about it.  Leaves some nice rings on the glass as I drink.  This beer has a great hop nose. Lovely floral boquet.  And it's backed by a sweet caramel malt presence on the nose as well.  There is something unique about the taste of this APA and I think it is a candy like sweetness that is present.  There is obvious caramel malt character and nice earthy and floral hops as well.  Not an overly citric or piney hoppiness, but this works fine as well.  Body is about medium-full.  Carbonation checks in just right.  This is really a pretty nice brew.  My first from the sampler I got a week ago."
"After two dissapointing ventures into the ""Flying Dog"" sample pack, I am pleasantly surprised by this.  It is not an all-time great but it is a solid APA...Very nice citrus aroma....good juicy hop taste with a decent malt backbone....pretty balanced...very drinkable...really a pretty nice beer overall...a tich thin though.."
"Initially a really sweet aroma that became more balanced by some hops, then became sweet but flowery.  Interesting aroma mix.  Medium head that dissipated rather quickly.  Clear with a orange-amber color.  Flavor really comes across as Am. Pale ale.  Nice bitter flavor that's not overwhelming and establishes a very pleasant smoothness.  Has aspects of citrus.  Finish is medium to short.  Medium mouthfeel with enjoyable amount of carbonation.  A nicely balanced brew that I could recommend."
"This brew pours with a deep red orange color with a quite lace around the glass.  The huge spicy aroma only hints at the hops contained within.  The initial flavor is of smooth, but mighty spicy-bitterness with a light malt balance.  Nice finish good flavor."
"This is perhaps my favourite of the Flying Dog brand and definitely a beer I will be trying to have in the fridge for a nice hop fix here and there."
"Pours a nice copper color, but the head seems to fade quickly and there is not much lace to go around.  The smell made me think malty and then when I tasted the beer, it didn't seem that Hoppy.  Maybe the smell tricked me, but it didn't have the hop-kick I like.  Not the best APA, but may be a good session beer."
"Flying Dog Classic Pale Ale  is a well bittered Ale, off on a wing of its own with more tails to spin... and biting off a chunk of the Ale sky for its self in the process."
"A very good beer but I wanted and thought more hops would have better served it.  The taste is more on the malty side but nevertheless a very smooth one.  The appearance is a little dark for a pale and it has a fair motuhfeel.  A very catchy name lol makes you want to try this brew and I don't think you will be sorry...................CHEERS"
"If you like good hop presence without the bite of an IPA, than you will probably like this beer.  I do, and I like it.  It isn't overly complex, but as pale ales go, it is a slightly above average one."
"I really liked this pa. Deep amber with a thick head that stayed for the whole glass leaving decent lace. I loved the amount of hoppiness in this. Sweet and slightly salty. This one is definatley worth getting again."
"Despite the reviews and the annoying label and name, this beer talked me into buying a six pack. It was a pleasant surprise. Nice tan color with a hint of copper color, the head disappeared quickly. Heavy hop smell, maybe a little strong. Taste was very hop heavy, more than I expected. Taste was still very crisp and refreshing. It went well with grilled chicken dinner."
"Nice deep copper color and piney hop aroma.  It's basically a decent pale ale that starts off with a nice hop profile but the whole beer kind of fizzles out at the end."
"Drinkability/Notes: Not my favorite pale ale, but certainly a solid one, well deserving of a try and a good session beer as well. Remember to pause for a moment to admire the wonderful Ralph Stedman label art."
"Notes: I think the name and label has made this beer something more than it is ... it's not the best Pale Ale in the world, just above average IMO, but it certainly does the trick."
"Dark amber color, metallic hop aroma was evident.  Taste was fresh hops all the way through, malt flavor was kinda thin as noted in the other reviews.  Sort of unbalanced but very refreshing.  A great spring and summer brew, should go well with food."
"All in all an average pale ale. A reserved sort of session type brew. The labels might be cool but I haven't really been impressed by Flying Dog's beers."
"Quite tasty.  This pale ale struck me as a mellow take on their Snake Dog IPA.  A good session ale.  Flavorful hops, but fairly restrained."
"A truly enjoyable ale good mouthfeel nice hoppiness. Flying Dog brews are all very good and this ale is no exception. Available in 12oz,22oz bottles and on tap."
