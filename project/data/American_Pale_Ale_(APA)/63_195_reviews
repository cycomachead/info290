"O: Very drinkable APA with well balanced malt and hops that leans slightly to the malt."
""
""
"Exceptional beer. Beautifully balanced. I poured a 12 oz bottle into a tumbler, 15 days shy of the ""Best by"" date on the bottle. Great color; amber, golden, orange-ish with a little bit of a haze. I poured it fairly aggressively and only got about a 1 finger head, (which didn't stick around too long). A lot of bubbles coming up from the bottom. A very pleasant, inviting smell. I could smell the hops but it was a subtle, gradual aroma, not an all out hop assault to the nostrils. The malt presence was also subtle, but definitely there. It was not obliterated by the hops, which I found nice (for a change). I would have given the taste a 5 but not for a slight, (very slight), dry, graininess in the finish. A perfectly balanced beer. Maybe just a little on the dry side for my tastes, but even as I write that I can't help thinking I'm probably being too nit-picky. This is a great beer. I would (and will) make this a ""go-to."" Very sessionable at 5%, looks great, smells awesome, tastes outstanding... what else is there?"

"Best pale ale I have ever had. Try with splash of lime. Heaven."
""
""
""
"O:  Didn't float my boat in the Mirror Pond.  Wonder how it might've tasted fresher.  Glad to try it, though."
"Very good pale ale. Pretty close to Sierra Nevada Pale."
"Oh how things used to be.  This beer once stood out with its hoppy character.  Now it is a fairly tame but reliable pale ale."
""
"little bit of the expected bitterness but not overwhelming at all."

"Very nice pale ale, probably my number 2 after Daisy Cutter. A little pine, a little citrus, and a nice but not overpowering hop bitterness."
"Smooth and no bitter aftertaste"

"A very good pale with strong notes"
""
""
"A standard pale, nothing special here."
"Overall: My personal opinion: A nice APA but nothing to get all excited about. If I am out at a restaurant or pub I would want to know about other offerings rather than just say ""Give me a Mirror Pond""."
"O- Great overall APA, in which the balance and mouthfeel is its best quality."
""
"This is my go to Bob Seger pale ale...Like a rock."
""
""
""
""
""
"t and m: great layers that follow the nose but are more compelling; little more fruit than in the nose; finishes medium dry; nice body for a pale."
"Excellent pale ale - not too hoppy.  Had this on tap in Fountainville PA.  Very smooth and great flavor."
""
""
""
"O: I would like this better if the aromas/flavors were a bit bolder. That being said, everything is so pure with not a flaw to be found even if on the light side this is not to be missed"

"No resinous pine smell from this IPA, but a very enjoyable clean tasting IPA. There are some nice earthy smells as if sniffing a fresh cut oak barrel. Lots to enjoy for the nose. Only 5% alcohol which is a nice twist for an IPA. Could absorb many of these and maintain as if drinking pilsners.  Lacing is quite good, with dark patchy colors on the glass. Bitterness is slight on aftertaste...lets you know the hops are there. Overall a great IPA for sessions and enjoyment..."
""
""
"This is a world class beer, indeed. It pours beautifully, with a lovely lingering head that dissipates into a foam archipelago. There is a distinct chill haze to the amber/orange body. Mirror Pond leaves distinct tendrils of foam lacing as it moves down the glass. The flavour is wonderful - biscuit, malt, and hoppy. There are definite grapefruit notes that do a great job of quenching your thirst! I first enjoyed this beer on tap during a scorching hot Idaho day. Today, it helped cut through the heat of a spicy Italian pasta dish. Mirror Pond is equally suitable in either situation and I imagine it rise to any occasion."

"Overall, we are finally getting around to reviewing this west coast stable of beerdom.  We were first able to sample this about two years ago, on a road trip out to Colorado to visit some friends.  Having never seen Deschutes before that moment, this became an obvious first choice when we hit that first brew stop.  We happily and rapidly sipped that first six-pack at altitude, but neglected to take any notes worthy of rating.  Fast forward to now, and we stumble across a second helping at a Meijer in Sandusky, Ohio, while visiting Cedar Point a month or so back.  Here we are, with the meaningful rating baton in hand.  This here is your quintessential no-nonsense pale ale.  The nose comes across freshly and seriously, with no unnecessary inclusions or deviations.  The flavoring is describable in much the same way, but is a bit more to the sweeter and more biscuity side of life.  Fill in the gaps with straight quality, and that is really what you’re left with."
""
"A nice balanced beer.  I expected a bit more, and perhaps the beer was just old enough to be muted, because it didn't taste stale at all."

""
"Deep gold in color.  Slim head.  Respectable clarity.  The aroma is clean..some fresh hops, balanced with lightly toasted malt.  Semi-sweet.  Drinkable."
""
"OVERALL:  this is my first beer from this Deschutes Brewery and it is one of the better pale ales I've had, it was really well balance with a sweet malt and the hops were very much to my liking, the 5% ABV means you can enjoy more than one, the hops are pleasant but not overpowering, I would definitely buy this again, looking forward to more from this brewer."

"Pours clear amber color with a 2 finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are moderate.  Has a citrus, maybe apple, aroma with slight piney hoppiness.  Bready malt with a mild bitter hop.  Nice bitter aftertaste.  Very good beer.  Very drinkable session beer."

"There was a lot of hype when this came to Wisconsin.  Not sure if we got a bad batch, but the beer was terrible.  Almost zero hop presence and a very thin mouth feel."

"A tad bit disappointed. Thought it was a very solid Pale. Like, as pale ale as a pale ale could be. Don't get me wrong. I would definitely drink again, would definitely buy. Just didn't find it to be spectacular. Definitely a hop heads APA. Not a standout by any means, in my book, though. Again. Let me reiterate. A very good and solid beer, but not great or exceptional. Drink it if you get the opportunity, but don't expect the world."

"Overall (4.05): This was good if a bit bready/yeasty for a pale ale, yet added a nice touch. The hop presence is pretty spot on for the style, but i couldve used a little more. These are minor flaws.  It is a clean, solid pale ale, and sometimes thats all i need."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber-ish in color with a caramel yet fruity aroma. No bitter after-taste but hoppy enough to satisfy the hops fan and mild enough to pacify the ""I hate hoppy beer"" drinker. Nice in-between brew."

"Beyond all other styles of beer, ambers are my preferred favorite.  For some reason, the Mirror Pond really hits the mark right on the head for me.  There's notes of hop bite, caramel, oak, and flavors of red meat and sausages.  I can't explain why, but after drinking German weizens, Belgian doubles and triples, or roasty porters, this beer knocks it out of the park.  No harsh after bite or lingering tastes.  Crisp, but even on the tongue.  I'll be stocking my fridge with this one for quite awhile."
""
"Mirror Pond put Deschutes on the map, and it's still their biggest hit.  As with a lot of APAs, I find them a wee bit too hoppy for my liking, but that doesn't mean I won't enjoy it.  I buy this from time to time, so I'm still a fan, but I don't think it's quite as unbelievable as everyone else does."
""
"Light golden color with a minimal head. Hoppy lemon aroma with some earthy tones. Taste is an earthy lemon citrus taste. Pretty easy to drink. Not too complex."
""

""

"O: This is easy to drink and perfectly balanced. It's a classic APA."

"O: A terrific pale ale.  I could drink this any time, any place."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  I see why this gets high marks.  It embodies many things that are good about gentle APA styles.  Unobtrusive malt and yeast, delicate hop bill and much skill in the application of the hopping schedule has produced a very fine APA."

"O- is there a finer APA around?  I think not."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.04) : As indifferent as I am to Pale Ales, this one wasn't bad at all. In fact it was pretty good. The hops were there but they weren't overdone. They were flavorful but subdued enough to taste the other flavors (wheat, lemon/orange peel, coriander). If one is looking for a good pale ale, look no further. I probably wouldn't buy a six pack because of my sensitivity to bitter beers, but I can rate this one on its own merit - it's good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very nice complexity to the aroma.  Aroma is also well balanced.  Definitely a hop forward pale ale.  Bitterness overshadows sweetness.  I prefer the Inversion IPA to this but this reflects the mainstream IPA style more truly.  4/5"
"Overall, not a bad APA although I feel like it is rated a little higher than it should be. The graininess is just a little too much but I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up again."

"Overall: This is totally unlike Burning River, much sweeter, and then this astringency.  Really balanced; definitely would buy again, but I could see this being too sweet after a couple."

"One of my favorites! I have been drinking this ale on and off for years, and it never fails to please!"
""
""
""

"I agree with the Bros, this is a world-class beer. Fresh, crisp and hoppy and one of my new summer favs.  First had it on tap and was pleased to have as equally good experience with bottled."

"Hazy bright orange. The head lingers only briefly, falling to a minimal collar of lace. Soft maltiness with notes of grapefruit and mild pine. The flavor is evenly balanced with Pale malt and Cascade hops playing equally important roles. An easy drinking APA. (5% ABV)"

"**UPDATE** Found a very fresh bottle from the inlaws when I came home from work. Best by date of 11/13/14. Still a very nice brew, but not noticeably hoppier, juicier, etc than my previous review. Still a good, solid APA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was anxious to get started, so I got a nice, heavy-handed pour going. The by-now predictable outcome was a pseudo-cascade, followed by the production of three fingers of dense, rocky, tawny head with great retention. Color was a deep-amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled primarily of grapefruit, but underlain by a light mintiness. Mouthfeel was medium, kind of soft on the tongue. The taste was mellow, kind of tea-like, with a light citrusy tartness. Finish was likewise mellow and unobtrusive. If I could only have one APA forever, it would NOT be this one."
""
""
"To be honest, this is a pretty good beer. For me, this is a porch sipper. It'll do well for bbqs, firesides, and boating trips. It's better than anything you'll get from the big name brands and it's just as smooth, add in the fact that it has better ingredients and was perfected by people who seem to have mastered their trade and you've got a better beer to hang out with than the competition ""porch sippers."" The flavor is a little lacking, so I wouldn't consider it something i would celebrate with or look for on an extensive menu, but it's a good six pack to have in the fridge for the end of the day when you're not looking so much for flavor, but for refreshment and a reprieve (the ABV'll get ya there). All-in-all, good beer, my friends. Deschutes gave us another gift with this one."
""
""
""
"This might fall slightly outside of typical pale ales because of the big flavor, but it's a fantastic beer. Definitely a worthwhile go-to."
""
""
"Few standard 5% strength beers pack this much flavor. Well-balanced, too."

"Final Word: Friend recommended and I was a little disappointed. It was good, but didn't stack up compared to others. In fairness, this was close to getting pulled based on brewdate. I wasn't impressed, but would easily pick this over any macro swill."

"Pours a golden orange color with a white head that leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Smell is of sweet bready malts and grassy/earthy hops. Taste follows the nose for the most part. Just a little bitter. The malt seems to cover up the bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty thin, good for a pale ale. A nice summer beer. Nothing incredible here, just a good APA."

"Final Word: Highly recommended beer for practically any purpose! This is just as enjoyable at a great beer pub as it is as a take home six pack. Phenomenally well balanced and well rounded! Full flavor with a gentle ABV."

"O - The bottle might be encroaching on the final days of it's ""best by"" date but it's still got a little life in it. Deschutes' Mirror Pond is a smooth and easy drinking pale ale with hoppy notes but at the lower end of the spectrum, making it a nice-to-pair belly up to the bar beer."
""
"This pours a mostly clear, amber color with a slight off-white head. The aroma is fairly bitter smelling for a plain pale ale. Upon tasting it is surprising the aroma is so hoppy because overall the beer is very simple tasting. While having a crisp, clean finish this beer is very easy drinking."

"Another impressive buy from my Ohio buying spree. So glad to have finally gotten to try some of Deschutes' offerings. This apa pours a beautiful reddish brown hue with very little off white head. It does retain a nice film and a very nice lacing. The nose is quite deep and malty but with a pleasant hoppy bitter bite and a little roastiness. The mouthfeel is very light and smooth. Almost a bit too light. I'd love a little more coating and chew to this beer. Maybe if it was unfiltered, this may be perfect. The flavor is very balanced. Malty sweetness, hoppy bitterness, and an almost funky belgian yeast flavor all play together beautifully. This is an excellent apa and just makes more excited to taste the other two Deschutes offerings I bought last week."

"Overall, this may be my favorite pale ale and one of my favorite beers. Just a great balance and so easy to drink. Superb."
""
""
""

"Deep copper amber slightly chill hazed with a bright white head forming thick and fine speckled lace left evenly as it dwindles down. Aroma complements malts and hops so well, slight sweet breadiness, herbal, pine, and citric notes complement the soft baked bread qualities. Pungent hops reach out to the nares as it warms, really nice American pale ale that's been around since 1988, wow!!! Flavor is amply hopped but round, malts mild sugar coated hops, fresh baked bread, biscuit quality, a hint of chalky yeast packet...herbal rolling hops, citric notes, pine earthy dankness is mild yet expressive in the hop components of this beer. I grabbed a sixer without hesitation when I saw this one at one of my local stops. Mouthfeel is packed with crisp flowing carbonation carries light hop resins across the palate, not much going on but the feel is very natural no forced over carbonation on the palate perfectly balanced well engineered pale ale with character all day. Overall this is the bread and butter of this great brewery out of Bend Oregon someone started making this at home in the 80's and had a eureka moment."
""
"Overall - A nice, smooth and flavorful pale ale. Very easy to drink, has enough hops to give it nice fruity flavors. No alcohol is noticeable, just balanced well and easy to enjoy."
"In a medium body with plenty of support without going too strong or heavy, there's a nice, creamy quality on the palate with a consistent crsipness supporting."
""
""
""
"O - I was excited that Deschutes started distribution in KY and wasn't disappointed. This is an outstanding Pale Ale."

"Mirror Pond Pale Ale pours a hazy dark copper color with a small lacing head. There is a nice mellow floral aroma. The taste has a noticeable hoppy flavor; mild, but finishes with a rich biscuit flavor. Good feel, good flavors, and very drinkable. Overall its a nice pale ale, strong biscuit flavors make sit rather unique."
""
"O- Another solid offering from Deschutes. I'm bout to have my 3rd bottle of the night. Definitely a session beer."

"O: An amazing APA, this is most likely one of the best examples of the style I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. This ale displays a gorgeous texture and flavor profile. The fact that I could drink this all day reminds me of why this beer is considered a classic. For fans of the style, I cannot recommend it highly enough."

"If this beer came out today (instead of years ago), I wonder just how well it would be accepted. I definitely like it, but I think the crowds who gravitate towards, big, bruising, citrusy beers would shun this one and consider it a bit dated. I would recommend this one to those new to craft beers. If you've been drinking craft for a while and are just getting around to this one, you may be a little disappointed. It's a good beer, but there are many Pale Ales out there today that surpass this one. I wouldn't seek it out, but I'd grab it if you happen to come across it and haven't tried it yet."

"Overall, this is a very competent, well made pale."

"O - Pretty good pale ale its worth a try."
"This isn't really an exciting pale ale. It personally reminds me more of an Irish red ale. This is ultimately boring and forgettable. This is my first experience with Deschutes so I guess this isn't the best first impression, but it's all good because there are more goodies from them for me to try out."

"12 oz bottle into pint glass. This is my favorite pale ale. Every other ale pales in comparison. Ha! This beer has a wonderfully balanced flavor and mouthfeel, and the low ABV allows one to drown the stomach in a short period of time if one is not careful."

""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Green Flash Imperial Pint glass. Lovely light copper color. Nice inch head or so. Smell is floral, fresh, piney hops. Pine really stands out to me. Taste is refreshing and mildly hoppy. Wonderful American Pale Ale. Had the pleasure to go to the brewery in Bend and it's even better there. Cheers!"

"Overall - Still being somewhat of a hop newbie, I was impressed by the balance of this APA. It is hop forward but the malts balance perfectly, and the bitterness only mildly lingers and dries the tongue, kind of like biting on a little chunk of orange peel. Very drinkable. As a BA just getting into the craft beer scene, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys hop character but can't quite take the high IBUs yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If this beer was a Christmas gift, it is the gift you never knew you wanted but now you can't imagine being without."
"Light bronze to brown in color. I get a good inch of foam resting on top with good lacing and great clarity. I smell light malt and Pacific Northwest piney hops. The hops and malt are well balanced. I get piney hop aftertaste followed by delicate malt backbone. This is a very smooth, session beer packed with flavor."
""
""
""
"Glad I randomly bought this in a mix and match six pack at my local store. This is my new favorite chill out beer. When I don't want to assault my tastebuds I will sip on this for sure."

"Pours a murky orange amber hue with considerable off-white head that leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is classic APA, citrus, gooseberries/black currants, tangy caramel malts and a little toasted grain. Palate follows the nose, with some brown bread, gummy candy sweetness and toasted grain propping up orange marmalade, green grass, mint, and chamomile floral notes along with a little pine resin. A bit chewy but skewed towards crisp and dry. Finish is like a high-quality semisweet citrus soda, clean, crisp and smooth. A little pine and fresh earth accumulate on the palate along with another bitter flavor that I am having some trouble placing ... Its a bit seltzer-like or chalky/medicinal in character. Well-balanced between tangy rich malts and classic American west coast aroma hops. Very true to style, not tropical and dank like many American IPAs but certainly has citrus twang and ample 4-MMP character (the chemical compound that gives American hops a ""black currant"" character). Find this brew as fresh as possible to get more of the bright top note flavors. Great session beer and something I will bring to a gathering of the beer proletariat to introduce them to the world beyond shitty macro-lagers."

"O: I think this is a very nice pale ale. I like it and would have it more often if the code dates were fresher. Sometimes I find this beer on the shelf past the freshness date. This is an extremely drinkable beer that I can enjoy without affecting me too much because of a high alcohol content. I recommend it and I am going to have another."

"Decent beer but lacking overall flavor. Bright orange color looks inviting and the aroma is very hoppy, but the overall flavor falls short. I was hoping for a little more maltiness out of a pale ale. I think it most certainly fits the style of a pale ale just not my favorite."

""
""
""
""
""

"I think this was a wonderful example of a west coast style pale ale. Some would even mistake it as an IPA I think. I thought it was one of the best APAs I've had in a long time. The last time I had it was on tap at Triple Crown in SD on Adams Street. I don't remember it being this good. :-)"

"Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
"On draft at a Tacoma Raineirs game. Deep copper pour with a creamy head. Citrus and malt aroma. Flavor follows with citrus hops and a strong malt backbone. A nice bit of grapefruit or mango here to go along with the caramelly malts. Finish is not as clean as I had hoped. Not bad and easy drinking brew that went well with baseball."

"Poured a 12 oz bottle with a fresh-by date which is getting close to the present date. Didn't matter though - it was enjoyed. Not an overwhelming smell - little hoppy and malt smell. The taste was of course full of the cascade hops, but a pleasant carbonation along with a mild fruity background. I did find a bit of an odd after-taste. However I countered that by not waiting long between tastes. A very nice pale ale which is nice in the summer as refreshing with enough hop flavor - Deschutes is a reliable brewery in my mind."

"The Mirror Pond was a light beer all around. The aroma, appearance, flavor were all light. The aroma was crisp with some fruity and floral hits to it. The appearance was an orangey and gold. The flavor was also a fruity/flowery combo. The beer overall was an excellent version of an APA."

"Overall- An above average beer that's worth a try but Deschutes does make better products."
"Overall I'm not blown away by this ale, but at the same time it tastes pretty darn good and serves its purpose; it's very refreshing. I'm more of a fan of lagers and darker, more robust ales than I am of pale ales, but this is really a good example of what a pale ale should be. Pick it up if you're a fan of the style. Cheers to good health and good beer."

"Hoppy, fruity, floral, spicy, malty. A wonderfully balanced and complex pale ale, great to enjoy in any season. Love me some Deschutes. Cheers"

"O - Not bad, not great. Good for a hot summer day."
"A very solid pale ale all around. Pours orange with amber highlights and nice frothy head. Smells of chewy malt with ample citrus hop nose. Also bready, slightly toasty malt aroma & flavor. Nice medium mouthfeel yet refreshing. Overall, a nice beer that could likely go with any food or any occasion."

"Bottle with a BB date of 6/25/13 poured into a pint glass. A couple fingers of off-white large bubbled head tops a burnt orange, hazy brew. Nice lacing-beautiful beer. Aromas of cascade hops (grapefruit, flowery and spicy) with a nice grainly, bready barley aroma in the background. Taste is balanced between an upfront Cascade taste with plenty of bready, clean malt with a crisp slightly bitter finish. A very smooth mouthfeel, a well balanced APA, hoppy but restrained with plenty of malt goodness. Medium bodied and carbonated. Overall, a flavorful easy to drink APA, balance is more towards the malt than the hops compared to many APAs I come across now. Well crafted brew."
""
""
""
"O: A very solid, well balanced pale ale. Definitely something recommended during warm weather, as it is quite refreshing."
""
""
""
"O: Overall fairly easy to consume, fresh, with a gentle hop dryness in the middle. six pack worthy."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great brew that's quintessential for any fans of the style and newcomers alike. Balanced and refreshing flavors with a smooth drinkability make this one extremely sessionable, especially on warm summer days/nights."
""
"Overall: A really solid APA. Glad I bought it."
""
""
""

"O - The more I drink it, the more I like it. Maybe it tastes this way because it is so close to the BBD or maybe the friend who gave it to me let it get hot or something. A fine pub ale."

"O-I remember disliking this beer the last time I had it (maybe four years ago), so I was pleasantly surprised by how good-looking it is and how nice it smells. The taste, while something of a let-down compared to looks and smell, is not bad, but it loses some of the hoppy sharpness that makes the smell so appealing. All-in-all, this is a good but not great example of an APA."
""
""
""
""
"O - A well balanced, but hoppy pale ale. This would make a great session beer in the spring or summer. Very flavorful."
""

""
""
""

"Great session beer. One of the finer Pale ales out there. I think it gets over looked because it is so easy to get, but with great tradition is great beer. I don't think they have to change a thing. Great citrus notes. Wonderful aroma. And you can actually have a couple of them without being completely loaded. That seems to be a problem with a lot of these beers these days. Nothing better on a sunny after noon"
"Orange-amber in color, filtered clean and bright, with a wispy/feathery off-white head - nice, snotty lace sticking around.... Mostly a floral-soapy hop aroma, toasty pale malt just sneaking in underneath, to balance.... The floral-soapy thing certainly comes across in the taste, refreshing, matched against some pleasant lime/grapefruit hop flavors - supporting malts show a bit more here, but never really give the esters and hops much of a fuss - bright/lightly tart bitterness, bit of an English esb/pale flavor quality.... Smooth, quite clean light-medium body, maybe a little round-maltier than drier than desirable in the finish - but having a little fat is no crime... A really solid APA - the invigorating hop/ester combo is showcase here - definite warm-weather treat"

"I remember drinking this earlier in the year, from the same store (and thus probably past its due date), I thought it to be one of the finest American style, west coast pale ales around (i.e. HOPPY pale ales). Even though the bottle was old, I still found it to be complex enough and easy-drinking enough to be enjoyable, and well worth the 2 1/4 clams I forked over for the bottle."
"Like a Rita Hayworth hair flip, Raul enjoys this."

"Poured a rich amber color, tan head which dissipated rapidly. Smell reminded me of lightly toasted bagels, very earthy. Taste was much the same, earthy, whole-grain oats, cracker-like. Sweetness is present, yet faint, but well balanced with the mild bitterness. Finishes dry and very pleasing. Did I mention it is very earthy. I had another, and another, and...Deschutes flagship beer sets the standard for Northwest Pale Ale."
""
""
"For a pale ale, this beer ventures into a realm of comfort and warmth most don't explore. I'm relatively new to the style, but I find this particular pale ale to be rather interesting due to it's complex profile. The hops are noticeable, but they seem to take on an equal playing field with the malts and caramel flavors this beer offers, which is a delightful spin on the pale ale. In one word: rustic. This beer should not be overlooked."
""
""
"Overall: Excellent American Pale Ale, very refreshing. The smell may throw you off into thinking this is a hop monster, but it's really not. Whereas there is some bitterness in the mouthfeel, it seems to be more on the smell. Highly recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite drinkable and low-key. From the 12 oz bottle at AJ's Fine Foods in Chandler."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a classic Northwest Pale Ale. Everything about it screams Cascadia, the hop and malt balance, the fruity yeast, and the full mouthfeel. As an added bonus, it is a touchstone that homebrewers and brewers alike can use for tasting the intricacies of the Cascade hop. I overlook this one to much."
""
""
"Great pale ale - nice all around. Pours a bit darker than your average pale ale - brown to orange in color with a nice foamy head. Head is retained well and nice spotted lacing on the glass. Based on aroma alone you would think this is a darker beer - earthy malt. Flavor is nicely balanced with a bit of body yet still light and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a hazy amber color, produced a creamy white head, featured excellent retention and excellent lacing. The aroma contained malted grain, citric lemons and herbal hops. Medium bodied, there was a nice foundation of malted grain, apples, yeasty esters orange and lemon citrus and piney hops. This is a very nicely hopped APA, If you enjoy micro brewed APA's...this is one of the best!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This might not be as carefully crafted and have as many ingredients as other, higher rated beers, but I have not yet found a better drinking beer. It's smooth, full of taste but not too strong with a nice balance of hops and malt that really respects the Pale Ale moniker. Also goes for a great price in the Northwest, which really rubs in the fact that I now live on the east coast because this stuff also destroys anything from the Boston or Brooklyn breweries."

"O: I've heard about this beer for a while now from a fellow BA. The girlfriend was able to score some for me on a recent trip to Chicago. Can't say that I'm disappointed at all! Smooth easy drinking APA, my first from Deschutes and hopefully not my last! Would seek some out again for sure, but probably wouldn't go bonkers if I didn't have it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well made American Pale Ale. It's tasty and highly drinkable."
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid APA. Between this and SNPA, they represent the style very well. Depending on the price, I might get this over SNPA. All in all, if you're in Deschutes distro, this should be a staple."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: because this brew is so well balanced both in aroma and taste, it really lends itself to be quite sessionable. The 5% ABV doesn't hurt either. A fantastic example if the style and bone that stands out in a market crowded by the style."
"Smoothe and crisp finish, really good example of the style. quite drinkable"
""
"Mirror Pond has made its mark as one of the few go-to APAs I've been getting for the past years whenever I'm in the mood for one. It definitely is on the sweeter side, although the 5% ABV and easy drinkable aspects make it a classic beer of its type. This one in particular is the most balanced of Deschutes' offerings, and a crowd pleaser. Want to find a gateway beer that will turn people on to craft? This is one of the main ones to pick for sure."

"The beer is golden to copper with a white head that leaves ample lacing on the pint glass. The aroma offers some bready malts, biscuits, light caramels, a touch of hops. Easy drinking and well balanced. Malty finish with a hint of bitterness. More of an English style brew than the hop forward American offerings. Tasty. This one disappears quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: At best, this is a decent pale ale. It's fairly refreshing at times, but compared to many other pale ales out there, this just doesn't stack up."
"Will buy again if on sale and sierra nevada pale isnt...mostly for the longneck bottles for use with my homebrew (labels are easy to remove)"

"Wow....this is a good beer!!! I believe this is my first from Deschutes and I can't wait to find other goodnesses from thia brewery. The beer pours a nice copper with thick slightly off white head that is lacing nicely. The smell is very subtle, sweet malts and fresh bittering hops. The taste starts with a sharp bitter, then a smooth sweet caramel malt takes over fro a nice finish. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is one heck of a pale ale...absolute session!!!"
""
""
"O -- A very well-balanced APA with a great blend of malt and hops. Not in-your-face, but definitely embracing the hoppiness of the style. Well worth a try for studying the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I tried this right after a Belhaven. The Belhaven was superior in my opinion, Mirror Pond to me is almost fruity to Belhaven's nutty. Doesn't finish as clean as the Belhaven. My wife did not like it and that's usually a good indication that a beer has some unwanted aftertaste."
""
""
""
"O- Well, can't say I didn't give it a fair chance. This one just doesn't come together for me. Bitter off notes along with a weak malt body and harsh astringency leaves me unimpressed again. Will not try for a 3rd time."

"O- This beer hits every metric to make a great beer in my book. Complex enough to be interesting, simple enough to be immensely drinkable."
"To answer the label's question: CCR's Chronicle. Cheating? Maybe. Regardless, this stuff pours a clear brass-amber topped by a finger of off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises light grass, flowers, and light toffee. Almost nothing makes it all the way to my 'strils, but I do get the general idea of some of it (I assume). The taste brings in more of the same, amped up to proper volumes, and with some additional mild orange zest. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a solid pale ale, indeed. 'Nuff said."

"Overall: As of this review, this is brand new to Chicago and all over the Binny’s Beverage stores in the area…I’ve tried this and the porter (haven’t “reviewed” it yet) and I have to say the hype is a bit more than the beer can stand up to…it’s good, and maybe it’s just me, but I’m not feeling this new style of NW APA’s…ambers and reds are flavors of beer that I typically avoid and this one is not a far cry from that…it’s good and has good flavor, is drinkable and with only 5.0% ABV it’s a sessionable brew…Deschutes rates really high so like I said, maybe it’s just me, so even though I put this one in the average range, it’s probably worth the gamble on your end…(3.5.5)"

"A solid session beer but nothing to write home about. Probably my least favorite from Deschutes to this point, and at a 3.5, that clearly shows that Deschutes is world-class."
""
"This is an exceptional pale ale. Pouring with a light copper color and gorgeous clarity, It's bright, bold and balanced with a citrusy hop character that stands way out front in the nose and leads the way towards a clean and malty taste that reminds me of toasted bread. The mouthfeel Is medium without being watery or oily and i would call the carbonation level perfect.It's not overly complex and I would argue its a bit too hoppy to be marketed as a straight laced pale ale, but its highly enjoyable and a great beer to serve to friends who are curious and beginning to dabble in craft beer. Mirror Pond will be the one to convert them!"

""
""
"O> An awesome beer and a great example of what Oregon beers are all about. Deschutes shows why it sets the standard once again. Deschutes makes beer that is mass produced, but still has the attention to detail that microbreweries command. I am proud to have Deschutes represent the Pacific NW.

"Tall, rocky ivory head tops an amber colored ale. Great retention and just stellar lacing all.the.way.down.the.glass! Aromas and tastes are very similar with notes of bready malt, caramel, toffee, earthy citrus tones, somewhat fruity. Mouth-feel is creamy, smooth, medium, excellently balanced. Overall, one of the best APA's I've ever had, regardless of the best by date....it was fine."

"O: This is a nicely hopped beer, although, as is common in West Coast pale ales, the malt is weak and too sweet. Nevertheless, it's a solid pale ale for the style, and quite drinkable."
""
""
"Overall tasty and easy to drink, this was a smooth pale ale that flowed down like water."
"Nicely balanced malt accentuated just so with cascade hops. Time and time again this is a winner and in my fridge."
""
""
""
"Very interesting in the taste and mouthfeel. This drinks like an IPA. In a blind taste, I would even guess its an IPA. Right up front there is a punch of bitterness followed by a wonderful caramel covered pine flavor and finishes with freshly squeezed orange juice. Smooth to drink, with low carbonation and a light body. Just wonderful overall."
""
""
"Overall-Very chugable. A great IPA for beginners. I can't imagine someone not liking this beer."
""
"Well balanced, easy to drink. Would be a fantastic introduction into craft brews, but it's not up to par with some of the better pales I've had."

"This is in my opinion one of the better examples of the American Pale Ale style and one which I recommend to some of my friends who shy away from some of the hopped up IPA’s out there. (Deschutes Inversion, Stone Ruination, and Dogfish Head 90 Minute to name a few)"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by 9/5/2012. Pours hazy golden orange color with a very nice 2 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, pine, herbal, floral, caramel, pineapple, biscuit, and light toast. Pretty nice and pleasant aromas with good balance; but they are a bit muted. Taste of orange, grapefruit, biscuit, pine, caramel, toast, nuttiness, floral, and herbal spiciness. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, biscuit, caramel, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great hop flavor balance with malts; and a very nice robust amount of flavor for a 5% beer. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is an excellent pale ale. Great amount of flavor; with nice hop and malt balance. Extremely drinkable and smooth. My glass was gone a bit too fast. Really enjoyed this."

"While I had previously mentioned that Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is not an everytime beer, I think Mirror Pond is. Deschutes has done a great job with this one. It's reddish body isn't typical for an APA and it's got a heavy dose of malts and a little fruitiness that work in tandem with that initial hop push to find a great balance. Even my friends that don't typically go for hops or pale ales can get into this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Excellent drinkability and a very nice hop presence make this one of the all time best pale ales in my opinion."
""
"This beer is a dark blond (think burnt orange) with good carbonation and a nice thick, off white head that’s very bubbly frothy and just overall inviting. I hope hell is this soft when I get there! You can smell the hops right away, some mild citrus fruits aromas with some wheat mixed in. Its got a medium-to-light body and is crisp on the tip of your tongue with mildly tangy kicks when it hits the sides and back of your mouth. The hops are present and very welcoming and like those overbearing mother-in-laws or grandma’s that always say” here you go, have a little more food, you’re too skinny”. The aftertaste is nice and smooth, the hops pick up a little more and there’s a slight grapefruit taste in there too. Not bad beer over all, I can’t wait to have this one again."

"Overall a great take on one of my favorite styles. If distribution ever gets picked up around here I will be sure to secure a case every month."

"Overall - This is an outstanding brew, one of my favorite PA's from the first time I drank it. I think this will be my go to pale ale from here on out if I want a bottle, of course 8-bit in the can.

"Overall: This is a very nice pale ale. I tend to like mine with malt that is a bit lighter, but I enjoyed this one anyway."
""
""
"I would like have to of seen more hop presence in the palate but still a very solid and enjoyable APA. Deschutes has done their research."
""
""
"All in all, those who want a more boldly hoppy APA may be disappointed but the mix of the floral hops, sweet middle and grain on the finish made this a real smooth drinker that would be wonderful in hot weather."
""
"A great session-able pale. I feel like a lot of pales fall short in the area of complexity. Mirror Pond brings to the pale category a bright citrus smell and taste. A lot of pales seem to sacrifice complexity in order to appeal to the standard ""light"" drinkers. Sitting on the back of the tongue this beer begs for another sip. Excellent color adds to the pleasure making this an all around enjoyable beer, a great beer to bring to a party or to take the edge off a long day."

"O: Could be a little bit hoppier but this is a fairly balance APA. Definitely easy to drink with any occasion."
""
"Overall-This brew would taste great with anything. It also is a great session beer. It's the type of pale ale you could have on a nice warm summer evening, just after a long hike or a nice run. Let it sit after pouring it into your glass to warm up a bit. The tastes ""mature"". I will buy this again. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Shorthand: Drink this. I want to."
"O: A very underwhelming APA. It's balanced and easy drinking but I would prefer the hops to be a little more forward."
""
"Right up with Sierra Nevada as the classic American Pale. Mirror Pond has a bit more malt and yeast character. Biscuit and caramel are firm against the floral and citrus cascades. Bitterness is even and drying and keeps the drinkability high along with the well-calibrated carbonation. An anytime beer that's great alone or paired with just about any type of food."
""
""
""
""
"O-a nice easy drinking pale ale"
""
""
""
""
"This is stupidly drinkable, and I imagine that it is fantastic with food. I would love to drink this all day. But, of course, I can't. I need a private jet so I can get regional beers whenever I feel like it."
""
""
"It's very smooth. Very very little hop bitterness. A nice amount of honey, caramel malts and fruitiness from the hops, and then on the back there is a nice breadiness. It's very pleasing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstandingly good interpretation of a pale ale. After drinking lots of IPAs, stouts and other heavy beers, this is compartively light, refreshing and easy."

"Overall - Nothing groundbreaking, just a very solid and drinkable APA. I can see how this beer will appeal to just about any beer drinker. It might be a little too sweet to have more than a few of them though."
""
"Tastewise, the malt is still heavy and thick, but not a bad or syrupy way. Things start off bready, then get piney, then there's a very nice finish of doughy yeast, citrus, and caramel. The yeast *really* brings everything together, and the chewy backend keeps things plenty interesting throughout the duration of the bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy copperish-golden color with an eggshell colored soapy head. Decent head retention with some glass lacing. Hints of lemon and a raisen or two in the bouquet. Perhaps a raisen bread pudding. Certainly nothing obtrusive for the olfactory to experience. Nice, mild flavor with lemon citrus being noted most easily. At first, I was a little disappointed with the mouthfeel. I wanted it to be a little more wet. But, after having given the beer a few pulls, I realize that the scrubbiness and just the faintest dustiness accentuate the flavor of the beer. There is more of a bitter feeling on the back of the tongue rather than a discernable flavor at the finish, if you will. I like it. I wish it was just a fudge cheaper though."
""
""
""
"If you're looking for hop, stick to the Inversion or Red Chair, but if you're looking for malt, this is worth a try."

"Overall - This is a beer I've grown to appreciate over time. As pale ales go, it's one of my faves."

"copper on amber with a finger of light tan foam. Spotty lace. Smells sweet with malts of the english engagement - simple malt with tones of toffee and wood. There smells some fruity, herbal hops which are understated and approachable. Flavor is slightly sweet and has low acidity and a nice flowery finish. Medium bodied and lower carb with a semi slick finish. Nice beer, really, really drinkable and although it's not my favorite PA, it's among the most frequently visited for me, surprised I took this long to sit down and just type this out."

"A great pale ale to be had here, any hop head would be pleased and if you love cascade hops this is your ale! A great snapshot of what an PNW Pale Ale."

"Haven't had this one in a LONG time so decided it was time to give it another go. Poured a nice dark golden with a thumb and a half widths creamy head. Sweet, bready, citric, piney. A very smooth and balanced flavor. A nice malt base providing a nice sweet bread that gets paired with some hops. . A very crisp, medium body with some carbonation to this. Another homerun by Deschutes and so much better than I remembered it. Balanced, smooth, and tasty. A great choice as a session beer but just as good a choice if you just want to take one in for the night and enjoy it (but good luck only drinking one!)."

"Gold color, small off white head and thin lacing. Has a very malty fruity aroma mixed with a well blend of malts and hops creating a great tasting well blended ale, not too bitter, very tasty.Nice and hoppy without being over the top. Really well balanced."

"to me this is about as good as an american pale ale gets. quite similar to the odell 5 barrel in a lot of ways. smells more malty than most, almost british style in that regard, but also has a touch of sweetness in the smell and in the flavor too. flavor has a nice fruity hop profile, but nothing aggressive, just a nice balanced easy drinking session pale ale. works will with tailgate style food, and is a nice beer for that purpose. i must say, this brewery has done nothing but impress me, i will always buy their stuff because its so unique and high quality. this is their staple beer for good reason."

"Overall Impression- This Mirror Pond in front of me HAS to be due to an old/over due keg or line problems... I will be reviewing the bottle I picked up from Lukas Liquor soon. I surely cannot recommend this beer from what I had to sit through with this version. An English Pale Ale at best..."
"O-Real nice and I'm looking forward to drinking a few of these during warmer months."

"Overall: SOLID American Pale Ale. $2.99 for a bomber? Heck yes. This is a solid B+, something that for the price would be an easy call to pick up whenever you're in the mood for an APA. This makes a nice counterpoint to Schlafly's more earthy, dank Dry-Hopped APA."

"O: So yesterday I reviewed Dale's Pale and man are these two beers on opposite ends. Dale's is an IPA-lite and this is an EPA-extra. So balanced and tasty. If Dale's Pale is my go to party/bbq beer, Mirror Pond is my chill evening bbq/anytime beer. I can drink this to relax any night. Love Deschutes!"

"Poured a slightly hazed apricot color with a small white head that receded to a ringlet. Good dose of citrus and pine hops in the nose, with a hint of bready yeast. As good beers in the style should be, a good balance of sweet and bready malts with citrus and piney hops, mild fruit tones. Light-medium body, and easily drinkable."

"For all the non-hop-bombs (which I love) from Oregon, I would put this beer on a very level playing field with Widner Bros.' Drifter Pale Ale...that one has a bit more bite to it when it comes to hoppiness, and that's about it. Both are excellent and I would recommend to any person that likes the Pale Ale style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Light yellow-orange color, although it might have been the lighting at the bar. The color was translucent and not too much head off the pour. Had a good crisp taste, with faint hints of a grainy blend. The first sip was very flavorful, and the strong flavor lasted through the entirety of the drink. I strongly recommend."
""
""
""
""
"I really like this pale ale, you can drink pint after pint of this stuff"
"O: A very decent APA. Love the malt texture and aroma. Will continue to drink"
""
""
""
""
"Pour a clear, copper color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of floral hops, hint of pine, sweet malt, hint of citrus hops, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, floral hops, slight citrus hops, hint of yeast, and slight citrus (pear?). Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, and body."
""
""
""
"An ok beer in my opinion but, as a lover of double IPAs, I feel like I'm jaded against less bold statements out of a beer."
"o - overall...great pale ale, wish this was a local. i continue to be impressed by deschutes. the fresh hop was an interesting take on the beer and another that i'd pick up regularly...but the mirror pond just seems so accessible that it would be the kind of beer that would just always be in the fridge. nice job on this one."

"Conclusion: I would expect nothing less than a great pale ale from a brewery with as a good a track record as Deschutes. This is a great pale ale from an outstanding brewery."

"This is a really well crafted pale ale. Extremely sessionable and tasty, without being over the top at all. Another Deschutes brew that has impressed me greatly."
"D - Finding more eloquent descriptions for a relatively bland pale ale is pretty difficult. A disappointment. Oh well."
"Masterful brewing; just not a huge fan anymore of Cascade. Proly not many others who could make this taste as good. Poured with a lovely. foamy, frothy, fluffy, large, off white head that lasts all the way down and lots of lace. Color is a pleasing clear honey amber. Aroma is malt, cascade, cereal, fresh all grain bread dough. Flavor’s about the same with the sweet grains, bold hops and a little carbonic tang framing the picture. Body and carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor and as much as I’m no longer a fan of Cascade, it leaves pleasant memories. I’ll have another gotdamit."
"Glad to have finally tried it. Will certainly have it again."
"O- Pleasant taste, look, and smell. Kinda seems like a spring/early summer beer."
"Overall, one of the most easily likeable beers I've encountered. Simple, drinkable, refreshing, and delicious."
"O- i really enjoyed this beer and have gone back to buy more. its balanced well, tastes great and goes down good. burps taste yummy too. this is definately one to try, and one of my personal favorites now."
"O - An underperforming brew. Last time I had this one, it blew me away, this time the brew/batch has let me down... COME ON DESCHUTES, don't let me down...."
"Pretty superb pale ale, and I got it at Safeway of all places (not that I'd recommend it at all for a beer store [or grocery store for that matter], but it was the only place that's open past 9pm and has beer)! It has one of the best heads I've seen for this style. It smells wonderfully of hops with floral and citrus qualities. The taste is even somewhat perfumey with some lemon zest flavors and, of course, the pale malt. A very solid pale ale indeed. So pleasant, it feels like it should be had a a tea party. I'd definitely drink this mid-day."
"O - Fine example of pale ale. In fact BJCP list this as a good example of an american pale ale."
"Or would they?"
"O - Very smooth, easy drinking, well-balanced and refreshing. Great beer."
"O- this beer was good and refreshing. I usually like a little more hoppiness in my pale ales but this beer is balanced well so it makes for an easy drinker."
"O: Very represenative of the style. I think they did a great job with this one. I would recommend to avid P.A. drinkers as well as newbies, and I know they would both be satisfied."
"You know, I really liked the character of this for a Pale Ale, having a well balanced and accessible hop profile but the overall thickness of it (which seemed totally unrelated to the body) did hold the drinkability of this back some. I’m guessing that it’s the English-style yeast strain that Deschutes uses, which has never really been a problem for me until this beer. I think that a 16 oz pint of this was just a little too much for me of this beer during this sitting."
"This is a great pale ale, as it is easy to drink, perfectly carbonated, well balanced, and very aromatic. Good all around, this is a very solid APA."
"Overall: I've always liked this beer and it is a solid reference point as well as ambassador of a similar style. Maybe not exactly what I would expect from an ""APA"" I would see it more along the lines of an English style."
"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of bready malt and some subdued herbal and citrus zest hops. Taste is of sweet malt, subdued herbal/floral hops, and some slight grape juice flavors. Minor hop bitterness quickly fades from the palate. This beer has good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pale ale with a nice balance of malt and hops. Very easy to drink and with the 5% ABV I could drink these all night long."
"Golden straw with a white head that dissipated slowly and left some lacing. Aroma of citrus hops and toasted malts. Flavors of citrus hops and cereal-like malt are well balanced. Medium bodied with enough effervescence to leave a fizzy sensation on the tongue. Nice citrus bitterness in the finish. This is a balanced beer that leans toward the hoppy side."
"Pours a clear pale copper hue which leaves a two finger head and sporadic clingy lacing,the smell is caramel/toffee malts,citrus hops,lychee and passionfruit,the mouthfeel is light bodied and has tastes of doughy bread,citrus hops,passionfruit,lychee,lemon zest and finished with a fruit salad dry semi bitterness and overall its alright and sessionable but probably would not buy again cheers."
"Overall this might be one of my favorite Pale Ales ever made, and why I love Deschutes so much."
"Solid APA, but not in my top five. Great for warm weather."
"Drink- I'd come back to this any time, if it were available in SoCal on tap. Treads a line not heavily traveled by the Pale Ale specialists these days, that is, one of adequately balanced with malts without syrupy sweetness. Heads in the direction of a more elegant version of Sierra Nevada PA, with better malting and more attractive for multiple glasses at a time."
" Overall this is a good brew. Drinkable, yet complex; exactly what a good APA should be. I loved the fruity hops. It's too bad this isn't more common up here in Minnesota, I would take this over Sierra Nevada any day."
"This is a good pale. It has plenty of flavor and is easily drank."
"Match this one with a slice of pizza or hamburger. The quintessence of a northwestern brewpub beer. I'd never turn one down, I'd even buy it again but it isn't my favorite pale ale."
"Thanks to MNbeerhunter for sending me A bomber of Mirror Pond in the N00b 5 BIF. This beer is a bright amber with a nice tuft of foam that leaves a little lacing. The beer smells like candied oranges and graham crackers. The beer tastes wonderful, with great citrus zip. The malts are chewy and a little dough like a good pizza crust. There are nice herbal and citrus hops percolating through this beer. Wonderful. I think this is one of the best examples of an APA I've ever had."
"O- very nice drinkable beer, not one of my favorites but an enjoyable beer."
"Drink-  Overall one of the better APAs on the malty side.  Ill come back to this one when its available."
"Mirror Pond pours an ever so hazy orange hued gold with a nice slightly offwhite head that doesn't linger. The aroma is malty with some nice biscuity bready notes, and a pleasant herbal hoppiness. The flavor is malty upfront, with a sudden sharp citrusy hop flavor. More bready malt and some nice caramel and toffee pop up in the finish. The moderate bitterness is sharpened by the carbonation in the finish, with just a bit of lingering resin."
"O: It is a very good APA and one that I will definitely have to enjoy again some time. No complaints. Deschutes never disappoints."
"Mirror Pond Pale ale is a rusty orange colored brew, sporting a medium-sized white bubbly head. The scent is a light, citrus hop scent with a sweet caramel follow through. The taste starts off with a light caramelized malt flavor, but the hops dominate the taste. Apricots, orange peel, fairly floral, pretty fruity overall. Medium bodied."
"Overall this is a good example of a Northwest-style pale ale, generous with the hops and always refreshing."
"Overall-Reasonable and easy drinking pale ale, as for flavor, pretty average."
"On the other hand the aroma and flavor dropped off quite a bit by the bottom of the growler."
"O: Excellent pale ale. Good summertime, and really, good anytime beer."
"While this has a tremendous amount of character, it's nothing too strong so as to be niche; it's more likely to turn the average beer drinker onto better beer than it is to turn them away from it - which is exactly what Deschutes does. That fact, coupled with other reliable flagship brands like this, makes that brewery truly deserving of all the praise that comes its way."
"O: What can I say? Deschutes just doesn't disappoint. A very refreshing beer."
"o - Overall a good beer, but their Red Chair NWPA blows this one away. The Red Chair had a lot more hops, whereas this one had a lot of malts and a twinge of mustiness to it. If I saw both on the shelf, I'd suggest going with Red Chair, though this is worth a shot once."
"Easy drinking enjoyable pale ale, not the best out there but tasty none the less."
"Surprisingly creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot-on for me. I really just can't find anything negative about this beer. It's not setting the world on fire, but it's a very solid brew from Deschutes. I can't wait until they have the capacity to come to Pennsylvania full-time"
"A dark amber color with a very healthy off white creamy head and plenty of lacing. The aroma is a very nice flowery yeast hop with caramel malt ideas. The flavor brings more yeasty sweet caramel with a decided up front bite of grassy hops. There’s a suggestion of alcohol with a hint of dry citrus, even a little vegetable edge. It mellows as it drops down the gullet and is quite drinkable, though I’d prefer less grass as usual. Medium-light body with a sparkling, clean feel."
"."
"O: This is easily one of the better balanced Pale Ales I've had. It definitely shares a lot of qualities of amber and brown ales. It does seem a little too roasted/nutty for a pale, but I like it. If I had local access to this, I'd likely buy it regularly."
"o - very highly recommended beer. One of the finest pale ales in America, definitely on the West coast. Oregon, and especially Bend, should be proud of this one. Pick one up if you haven't yet."
"It is easy to get (for me), reasonalby priced, and a tasty beer. This is going to be one of my go to beers for a quick one after work."
"Overall: Exceeds my expectations and I am a big fan, now if only I could get my hands on this on a regular basis I would be one happy camper!"
"Pours a dark coppery amber with a decent off-white head. Aroma is malty and fruity and has a surprising hoppy, evergreen overtone. Malty, hoppy flavor is somewhat fruity with a touch of fruit sweetness and just a hint of caramel. Fizzy, sassy texture leaves behind a nice tingle."
"O- nice pale for sure I'm glad philly got this in for beer week."
"This is a pale ale loaded with flavor and reasonably heavy on the hops. Quite nice."
"D - This one is an extremely sessionable American Pale Ale if ever there was one... Slight more assertive than most, but nothing overpowering... Simple... Straight forward... Very effective..."
"Medium bodied but a bit fuller than expected with a somewhat creamy texture.  Subtle floral hop presence up front with faint dryness.  Only slightly bitter with kind of a weaker hop presence than anticipated.  Sweetness underneath with pale malt, grass, straw, apple and pear.  Slight dry finish.  Very easy to drink."
"O - I'd definitely get it again, a very good, nicely balanced pale ale."
"D/O: Refreshing and smooth; a pretty classic example of an American pale ale... good stuff."
"O: This is a great pale ale, crisp clean and delicious, I seem to have enjoyed everything from this brewery!"
"O: Nice, light and tasty and very drinkable. This is a very mild APA and IMO is more suited to the style. I have had some very hoppy APAs that while delicious, are almost indistinguishable from IPAs. This turns the hops down a little and makes it into a nice balanced APA. All around good, but nothing outstanding in my opinion."
"A good overall APA. Excellent finish with good flavors. Hops provided flavor but didn't kick up bitterness until the last second."
"A great NW APA, even better paired with food (e.g. a high quality burger). Readily overlooked by their porters and stouts, but Deschutes knows how to brew a wide variety of styles with distinction and craftsmanship."
"O- A very tasty brew, goes great with food, a great session choice."
"O: Very drinkable for prolonged sessions with this one. Not that I'm rating it any higher because of this, but the low cost will have me returning to this one soon."
"Overall: This is a very good APA. Obviously not as intense as an IPA, maybe a good introduction to craft beer for the unwashed."
"TASTE: WOW. Really smooth. Taste of hopps but not overpowering like some pale ales. VERY refreshing. While browsing through my ligour aisle at albertsons and taking way too long to pick from my usuals, my impatient 8 year old said, ""Dad, pick something new!"" This was the one and no regrets. Good stuff maynard!"
"Overall excellent."
"Overall. Great tasting pale ale. Wish it had a little more carbonation, but that's a pretty minor complaint."
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark golden amber with a small white head that leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is light floral hops as well as some sugar cookie. Not terribly complex, but enjoyable. Taste is very similar to the nose. Some sugar cookies as well as some floral hops. Clean finish with a light bitterness. Light body. Medium carbonation."
"O: A good interpretion of an American style pale ale."
"A very balanced, simple American pale ale. A great beer to enjoy with food."
"Nothing really stood out and made me say""wow"" but it was a very pleasant experience."
"Poured from a bottle into a tall beer glass. Great orange hue with a nice beige foamy head. Nice smell with a small sweet taste...little alcoholy for a 5.0. Mouthful was watery and a bit disappointing considering the color and head. Overall not a bad beer, just wouldn't go out of my way to find it again.... oh well."
"O: Classic northwest pale ale, great balance between citrus hops and sweet malts. One of my go-to pale ales."
"M & D - a bit watery. Finely carbonated - refreshing. Very drinkable."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer. The aroma especially is nice and is a bit like a potpourri with a sweet malty edge to it that I enjoyed. Otherwise, the flavor is also good and well blended, I just think that there is something going on with the water to make the hops have that edge. Regardless, I have a 6-pack of this beer and I am not going to let it go to waste, I assure you."
"Overall: Very solid pale ale, love this stuff."
"Pours a dark orange color with a small white foam head. Bursting scent of fruits and malts. Tastes exactly how it smells with a slight edge of hops. A bit carbonated. has a smooth but brisk mouthfeel. A pleasure to drink. No alcohol taste. Would be great with pasta and cream flavored sauces or fish. Just a damn good beer."
"Two fingers of straight ahead, basic off-white to tan foam, loosely constructed and infused throughout with larger bubbles, simmers down evenly, you get a sheeting effect on the glass sides at first that just keeps gliding rather than break into stickier streaks. Somewhat cloudy reddish orange hued liquid, consistent throughout with hardly any color loss at the rims, a few strands of bubbles here and there. Settles into your nostrils snugly and confidently, no great fanfare just multigrain bread, biscuit, tea leaf, green grass and pressed flowers, lowkey milk chocolate to toffee accents, a brush of apple, peach, pear fruit and then a splash of orange peel, fits together nicely as a whole with no one element dominating. Medium-bodied, similar user-friendly and balanced, knit-together presentation, little bit of pepper and maybe ginger spice or soy, then wet green hops and earth. The more you sip the more the bread, biscuit asserts itself, more dough than raw grains. It's smooth enough already that it does not need the malts to do too much work in this department, hence the chocolate, vanilla and peanut brittle mostly under the radar. Nothing unusual about the carbonation, brings some fluff as much as churn. Mixed white fruits, moderately surprising you don't get more citrus but nothing unsettling. Maybe a tick more bitter at the end than needed, otherwise delivers a compact, clear message of a brew which can be consumed in good amounts."
"O- I remember the hops being fresher, brighter, and most of all stronger in this beer, so maybe this isn't the most fair review, but then again maybe since I didn't stop to think enough to write a review before it was all in my head. But even faded it's still a tasty beer, and an easy drinker."
"As a fan of Black Butte I was eager to try this one. I brought it home read reviews and realized it was a light beer. I expected a heavier pale ale taste and was slightly disappointed. Aside from its super light taste its not half bad, at first I was turned off but got the hang of it and started to welcome the flavor. One thing that was unappealing was the light body. The dried peach and bitter hops scream heavy body. Overall pick this one up its not too bad and not bad for you. Looking forward to trying more Deschutes brews. Stay thirsty my friends."
"I was looking for a snappy pale ale for this gloomy weather instead mirror pond is more of a sessionable amber, very balanced but doesn't deliver quite the refreshment or enough bitterness. A drinkable brew, but I don't like getting fooled."
"O:-> Crisp, nice, would enjoy with a meal next time...a very solid pale."
"Slightly powdery yet creamy mouthfeel with a full body. This ale purports to be more well balanced with hop bitterness than other APAs especially from the Pacific Northwest, but this claim only goes to show just how overhopped American craft brews have become. Yet the bitterness is pleasing and mild enough that the virtues of the Cascade hops can be detected. I get a slightly nutty taste off of it as well."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp and slick, with just a bit of stickiness on the tailend, while drinkability is exceptional both in sensation and abv - bitterness cleans the palate a bit while the 5% abv definitely makes this sessionable. Deschutes puts out a fantastic year-round sixer lineup, of which black butte and obsidian are probably my favorites, but this guy is well worth the money as well."
"D - Impeccable, frankly. This beer is well balanced, smells good, tastes good, and has low alcohol. Very well done."
"Dr: Admittedly, pale ale is my second least favourite style. That said, it's a very light, moderate, enjoyable summer's day brew and gets me excited to try Deschutes' other offerings (If I can only get me hands on that damned Abyss). It takes a lot fr me to rate it as high as I am, but that's what beeradvocate is about - discovering and enjoying new beers."
"To this one now and again."
"A nice darker amber beer with a good white froth that settles down after a few minutes. A nice aroma that hints of hops and grapefruit. Smooth drinking and a nice mix of hops and malts. Perhaps a little more hoppy than some pale ales, but if you like a little hops, this is a great fallback beer that can be had cheap. One of my favorite pale ales."
"D: Highly drinkable and sessionable and also quite refreshing. Deschutes Brewery continues to impress with this exquisitely crafted, balanced and complex American pale ale. Perhaps not the definitive beer in the category, it is certainly no lightweight and should serve as a fine example of the style for beer enthusiasts."
"Drinkability - Interesting. Glad I tried it. Will not go out of my way to pick up another one."
"I thoroughly enjoy this beer from the tap, but it seems to be missing some of the best parts out of the bottle."
"Verdict: This is an old stand-by for me, as it is a darn good pale ale and widely available in my part of the country. Definitely worth trying if you haven't already."
"Easy to drink, decent alcohol content. Good session, especially for fans of the American Pale Ale."
"This is a beer that could be enjoyed by anyone willing to try a American Pale Ale. To those that already enjoy and seek out APA's, this label should be a very pleasant experience"
"The mouthfeel is a bit off as well, almost grainy but at the same time thin and watery with an especially weak finish. I'm sure this is a good beer fresh and I wish I had noticed how far past the best by date it was when I received it. Lesson learned: drink your pale ales fresh."
"my first deschutes offering and i'm impressed. nicely balanced and would be a perfect compliment to some spicy food or hot wings."
"D: Great drinker. A excellant example of the style."
"FourthBeer potential: HIGH. Not bad at all. As an IPA fan, I find this to be a good balance of some bitterness in a slightly more subtle and sweeter package."
"Solid and drinkable pale ale. Sessionable. Not top notch, but very pleasant."
"Overall this was an enjoyable pale ale. Had a great balance of flavor and is just a bit more hops away from hitting IPA level."
"D/O- Besides the mouthfeel misstep, this is a very drinkable Pale Ale. I believe this is the first time I've had this beer and I am quite enjoying it. I like Deschutes."
"D - Smooth and just the right amount of malt."
"Overall this was a solid beer for the style but it's nothing special. Worth a shot."
"D&O - The intensity and weight of this brew offers the opportunity to sink them one after another without a second thought, and it is within this characteristic that its dichotomy exists. There's not really enough in the glass to stimulate prolonged interest or that second thought, yet it is interesting enough to not bore you to death. Consequently, MP is best summed up as worthy of attention - just not the center of it. A solid session brew only."
"D - Very easy to drink. Expected, given the ABV."
"Light bodied and very well carbonated. Refreshing and sessionable, great with a meal or to quench thirst."
"This is a very drinkable IPA and well worth the money."
"Good level of carbonation. Easy drinker. Really solid brew. Deschutes does a phenomenal job with all their lineup."
"drinkable - yep, but not a favorite."
"Appearance is good, nice one and a half finger head that disappears within two minutes. Nice lacing throughout the glass. Great amber/golden color. Smell is hoppy, citrus and floral notes are picked up on the nose, but very vague. In the taste the hops are neutralized to some extent by the sweet maltyness, I also start to pick up a taste of fruit, I think I get grapefruit. I can't quite tell which taste is most present, it really just blends nicely all together. The three tastes make for a really nice beer. The drinkability isn't bad, I don't want to drink a hundred, but it is very drinkable and easy to go down."
"Refreshing enough and I've had this as a session beer in the past."
"Atmosphere is pretty good here. Appearance is nothing too exciting, but has a nice amber hue, foamy head, and lots of lacing. Nose is not complex, but a nice floral malt. Flavor, similarly, not complex; but done well. Pungent malt with woody and slightly sweet hope notes. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"I like the boldness but would appreciate more complexity. Still, a tasty beer."
"D- I found this one to be really easy to drink. I like what's going on here."
"Maybe a bit to carbonated, still, easy drinking and a good starter to convert your freinds to craft/micro-brews."
"If you are looking for a nice hoppy ale that goes down real easy, this is a beer for you, and if you havent tried a Deschutes beer, you are missing out. Perfect beer for a sunny afternoon, while you sit in the snow on the top of your local mountain."
"The body is limited and I think its more because of the dry finish. This does help bring the hops out more in the taste though. CO2 is good. Overall a good APA."
"D - Very drinkable, this is a nice pale for a casual setting or with a meal."
"D: Well balanced, a drinkable beer.Like it."
"I love Deschutes."
"D: Low because of my taste, but it seems like a well put together beer."
"My first one went down exceedingly quickly. I bet brand new fresh Mirror Pond is bomb and a rival to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I'm glad I know what I was passing up all those times that I chose something else."
"D - This is great. Looking forward to trying more Deschutes beers."
"D - I could drink this all night, especially during the summer."
"This is an overly hopped beer, which to me is sometimes a good thing. This beer is hoppy, with a grassy, earthy mouthfeel, a golden yellow color with just the right amount of head and carbonation, and is pretty smooth if served very chilled. This beer loses its flavor the warmer it gets. It is very refreshing, and is obviously made by people who know what they're doing. Deschutes usually tends to put out a great product, and this is no exception."
"Overall a good IPA but not as good as SN."
"D: near perfect. I suggest you drink this to excess."
"D- As with most pale ales, this is a nice medium bodied beer with great flavor. I would put this right up there with most great American Pales. I had been enjoying so many IPAs recently, that when I started tasting Pales again, I forgot how great this style is. Never again."
"D- very drinkable especially if its hot outside."
"nicely done."
"Poured golden orange with yellow highlights that had a very thin head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass. Moslty sweet with malts with citrus character and subtle hop notes that a very faint. The taste was also big on the malts which makes the more sweet and really no hops to really speak of but had citrus accents. The brew was medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a sweet, malty,citrusy, and crisp finish. It drank really good and could easily be a session beer."
"D: This is a beer that people are usually glad to see you show up at a party with, since it's a little better than the terrible stuff that is the most common. Easy to drink casually, but nothing there for people looking for something interesting."
"Wow is this sweet. I'm very disappointed in this beer. I love Deschutes... I'm just going to endthis review and return to watching Star Wars with my 3 year old..."
"As far as drinkability goes, this is great. It is subtle and not invasive. The ABV is low enough to consider it sessionable by BA standards, which makes it perfect to drink a few of these without getting too buzzed."
"Drinkability is great, perfect session beer, crisp and bitter enough that it never gets cloying."
"Overall, a very solid American Pale Ale. From Deschutes, it's expected to be good, and it delivers. Great balance."
"Very very drinkable overall -- I'm glad I got to try this and would definitely drink more. Tasty!"
"Overall a very nice brew that drinks easy beer after beer. Perfect for a warm summer day."
"This beer deserves high marks in all areas, especially in terms of drinkability. Tasty, well constructed, highly drinkable and one of the top pale ales brewed in the US, without a doubt."
"Pours a nice amber color with a good white head and some pretty nice lacing. The nose is citrus and floral hops with some orange standing out. The flavor is nice and balances the hops with just a bit of malt, but certainly not too much. Good body with a nice bitterness. This drinks incredibly well and would certainly be a staple of mine if Deschutes were to ever make it out East."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice APA. It had some very nice hoppiness to it for the style and also some decent maltiness to balance it out some. A very easy drinking and tasty beer for the style overall."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light and a bit watery, with decent carbonation. If you're looking for a beer that is sessionable and easy to drink, this would be a good choice. If you're looking for tons of flavor in your pale ale, you'd probably look elsewhere."
"Nicely balanced and dangerously drinkable. One of my favorite pale ales. When I think of APA, I think of this beer."
"This is a very easy to drink pale ale and would be a fine choice for any occasion."
"Medium body, a little dry and chewy. Goes down easy but not exactly something you go crazy over. Definitely a decent session beer but there's better APA's out there."
"Very drinkable, yet not highly distinguishable...might get lost in the masses of microbrews out there. Good sessions beer and good with food."
"Great malt/hop balance combined with a fairly low ABV makes this quite drinkable. This is the best Pale Ale I have every had, def not my favorite style but this is what a pale ale should be simple hops, simple malts, delicious. Sets the bar for APAs, period."
"Served in a whiskey glass. Look: brown color with ruby shades, very thin foamy head (maybe because of the glass). Smell: Grass hops and nut malts. Taste: Wood hops with a waterfall of cookie and nut malts, with eart hops at the end. Mouthfeel: Woody, high bitterness, the body is soft for the style. Drinkability: I liked the combination of wood with biscuity malts, very good."
"D: Quite high. The beer actually reminds me of an ESB. It's good, perhaps a beer to try and convert friends to craft with. I will admit that I'd get a bit bored with it."
"12 ounce bottle. Color is a brightish orange tinged to amber. I've got a little bit of a cloudy appearance, not sure if that's a typical characteristic of this beer or if it was maybe my choice of glass. Smallish head that collects tiny little pools of foam. Minimal lacing. Big aroma of biscuity malt. Hop aroma is also there, though not as pronounced as the malt. Mouthfeel is quite nice, with a level of bitterness that surprises you given the aroma is mostly that of malts. Adjusting to the level of bitterness the malt opens up, with caramel sweetness hitting all the right notes. Grapefruit and spice add hop character. This is quite a pleasant pale ale. I really like the mouthfeel, it's not watery, almost slick, and very enjoyable. My only complaint about the beer is that it's relatively standard for a pale ale, with nothing that really stands out. Still it's a solid, although unspectacular, example of the pale ale style."
"D: A very good session beer. Enjoyable to the last drop."
"This is one of my favorite pale ale's big on flavor."
"Pours a nice golden straw color with touches of amber. Good cap of firm white bubbled, good retention and moderate sticky lacing. Scent is a great combination of Pacific hops, good pine and grapefruit balane. Taste brings the delicious hop profile from the scent but adds a nice touch of mango, good light crackery malt backbone. Lighter side of medium bodied, perfect carbonation level. A very nice APA with better hop qualities than some IPAs."
"D: Very drinkable, excellent hop flavor and malt complex with the lighter mouthfeel makes this a highly drinkable and enjoyable beer. One of the best, if not the best, examples of an American Pale Ale."
"D: I have a friend who I once heard put this on a pedestal by saying that Mirror Pond is one of the best pale ales on the market...I'm not going to argue."
"The best by date was a week awway has I remebered. I could defeintly tell that most of the hops have faded. Still a well balanced pale ale with some decent hop flavors. Some citrus. but not much. still a well crafted beer."
"O: I was expecting a solid flagship style beer, but I was pleasantly surprised. One of my favorite pale ales."
"Clear amber color with two fingers of head that had great retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Plenty of citrus and floral hop aroma to start things out balanced with some caramel malt. This APA is surprisingly flavored balanced coming from a West Coast brewery. Citrus hops leads the way but is quickly balanced by the sweet, caramel malt. Bitterness is moderate and seems to just right for this beer but it does linger for a little too long in the aftertaste. The body is on the lighter side of medium but is more than enough to carry the hops. Good carbonation. One of the better values to come into our market in a long time. This is a regular in my fridge."
"D'ability - Lacks malt sweetness to offset the hops. A 5% ABV hop bomb."
"m/d-Very light in the mouth, but it has a little bit of balls for a pale ale. There are a number of pales that I would drink before this, but it would make for a nice drink on a warm day."
"All in all, this brew was not much special. I'm glad I got to try it, but I will not hunt it down again, for sure."
"Solid, highly drinkable APA that didn't quite live up to the Inversion IPA or the Hops in the Dark I tried, but still a solid effort from Deschutes. Pours how you'd expect, then a nice balanced mix of hops and malt. I could have done with a bit more fruitiness, or flavor in general, but it's a fairly subdued style. Highly sessionable."
"Awesome copper haze, a nice head and a balanced aroma all come with the pour. Taste is very rich and less refined than most pale ales. Its much more complex and thicker on the taste buds than say a SNPA. I like this beer, it drinks heavy but says it weighs in at 5.0%. It has an awesome taste that makes it stand out to me as a pale ale with alot of backbone. Cant go wrong with a 12er of this in the cooler, summer or winter!"
"Pours a cloudy amber color with a small white head. Scent is VERY fruity. Lots of citrus, mainly grapefruit. It has a bit of a funky scent to it as well. Taste is quite pleasant. Very well balanced and smooth. Initially, I get citrus (lemons, orange, grapefruit)...then I get a bit of tropical mango. Then it ends with a nice caramel malt flavor. Very nice. I see this beer everywhere, but I never buy it...I regret that. Mouthfeel is kinda thick for a pale ale...but I have NO complaints about that. Drinkability is very high. It seems like it's a bigger beer than it actually is (weighing in at only 5%)."
"Poured a golden, copper color with a 1/2"" white head. Smells hoppy and piney. Citrusey hop taste with a little bit of bitterness, little bit of malt too. Mouthfeel is a little thicker thank I expected, but it was good. Overall, it was enjoyable, one of the better pale ales I have had."
"Pours a clear copper with a thin creamy off-white head. Smells of freshly baked bread and a hint of pine. Taste is light toffee up front, followed by a citrusy orange peel middle, and a piny dry finish. A hint of soapyness in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, nice low carbonation. Very good drinkability, I would certainly get this again, an excellent example of an APA."
"Yup, a pleasantly hoppy session ale, through and through - tasty, balanced, and increasingly drinkable, due in no small part to its lingering dryness - and look - my glass is now empty - quelle surprise!"
"D - Better than the sum of its parts. A good, enjoyable session beer, but don't expect it to be real interesting in any one area."
"I would recommend it. However, this beer was not to my liking. It's worth a try. I gave it a good rating on taste because the flavor was there, but the drinkability factor was not."
"D - A definite session ale though there may be some better options available."
"Cheers!"
"D - easy drinking, thin but smooth, and light well balanced flavours make this a worthy beer, and the kind of pale ale that will appeal to many tastes"
"D - Very pleased with this offering. Nothing mind blowing, but was definitely a full flavoured ale with many admirable characteristics. I wish I had access to 6-ers of this in Alberta, as this would be a lovely sessionable beer."
"D- After about two of these, the malt becomes a little to sweet for me. A good interesting take on the pale ale."
"D: A great lawn mowing beer. Actually great for any time you want a very refreshing beer."
"This brewery produces some liquid gold, unfortunately not this."
"D : Easy going down, but the lack of distinctive character gives this one a thumbs down."
"This is a very drinkable beer and good for a session."
"Bottle poured into a standard pint glass. This bottle says best by 8/26/10. Yellowish-orange in color with a solid inch of head that slowly dissipates and leaves a good amount of lacing. Fresh hops on the nose combine with a distinctly sweet malt to provide a great aroma. I get pineapple and citrus notes. The taste is well rounded. The hops and malt strike a nice balance so that you seem to taste both equally. Bitter, fresh hops dance on your tongue and the malt provides just enough sweetness to make this one very refreshing and easy to drink. Carbonation might be a little on the light side for me but not by much. The finish leaves you with only a slight hop resin and a little bit of malty sweetness but is overall pretty clean for a beer with this much flavor."
"D: A refreshing and tasty brew for something that's low in ABV. Good for a lunch break in the sun (cover the beer, of course!). I prefer this to Inversion."
"D: excellent drinkability, reminded me a lot of Copper Dragon from Skipton"
"Nicely done. Good solid drinker."
"D - a very solid APA, one i would love to drink if it were available here. another great beer from Deschutes."
"Cheers!!"
"Sitting at the in-laws house in Seattle watching the World Cup with a Mirror Pond in hand. Poured into a goblet style glass. Dark amber color with a nice but small head. Moderate lacing on the glass. Smell is pine and a bit of grass and caramel. Taste is very nice, as it has an excellent hop profile but a great maltiness to it also. Mouthfeel is hoppy but leaves a spicy hop aftertaste in the mouth. Drinkability is higher than normal due to the well-built balance of this beer. Would love to see more Deschutes back in Mass."
"Pours a mahogony reddish, brown color with an nice off white head that gives way to minimal but noticable lacing. Retention is poor, but this just barely hazy APA looks inviting. It has a very mild, almost muted hop aroma but it does carry some nice caramel sweetness on the aroma. Almost has a barleywine esque matly aroma but its very faint. Tastes on point with the style. Not over hopped, or over malted, balanced and crisp. Nothing jumping out at me and does have a slight bitter, unenjoyable aftertaste. Mouthfeel is spot on, small bubbles wake the tongue up but leaves a disjointed hollow alcohol aftertaste. Drinkability is very high. solid APA, too bad its not distributed by me."
"D: Goes down easily, nicely blended, mild kick. This is a damn fine APA to sit with for a long time."
"Finishes with a nice hop bitterness and a slight citrus lingers. Great mouthfeel overall and very drinkable. Beautifully done!"
"Big fan of Deschutes Brewery, have been from the start and their little brewery was brand spankin new. With Deschutes, it's almost as if their ""terroir"" shows in some of their brews. Mirror Pond is a pale ale I've loved for decades, it never gets old. Also, this is one that needs to be fresh for the full effect, I have bad visions of some esoteric brew from Oregon sitting on shelves for months in New Jersey or Georgia and then getting picked up by beer lovers. Makes my head hurt."
"D-It is pretty drinkable but I will probably not buy any more. Than mouthfeel is pretty much a turn off. ..."
"Pours a light golden color with a half finger of head and a tad bit of lacing. The aroma is pretty light, made up mostly of bready malts and earthy hoppiness. The flavor is very crisp, but the hops are virtually non existent. This would be fine if the malt profile was a bit cleaner, but there is some mustiness that holds it back from really being an easy drinker. Bitter finish. Overall, a nice beer perhaps to have with a burger and fries but not something I would purchase again."
"Medium body, smooth with lively soft carbonation which makes it really refreshing."
"Overall a very decent pale ale built for sessioning. Really, as a fan of IPAs and DIPAs it's kind of hard for me to rave about a pale ale in quite the same way as I would something more in-your-face--much less engage in the same level of detailed tasting forensics--but make no mistake, this is a great beer from a great brewery."
"Drinkability: Excellent, excellent beer. I need more Deschutes in my life. Flavors are simple and great, it's a very refreshing beer and the 5% ABV makes it more than manageable. This is an all-day, all-summer beer."
"I love this beer, incredible taste. Not a huge head on it, but I really love this beer. For an american pale ale, this beer is amazing. Incredibly refreshing, good color, good smell/taste. Good alcohol level, great body. Overall very very good, I have no improvements to make. You can find this at Whole Foods, which makes it even better."
"The taste was mainly hops, the same variety as the smell, but again mostly hops. A dry bitterness with a hint or two of malt make this a very drinkable beer. They haven't tried to over hop this beer, it sits nicely below the IPA levels and although it leans towards being that style they've resisited to go that far, good."
"Poured a golden dark amber with carbonation evident. 2-finger head quickly settled to a coating which remained throughout. Nose is underwhelming citrus, floral and butterscotch. Mouthfeel was medium and was a little sticky. Taste was woody, sweetness of some citrus, particularly lemon and a mildly bitter finish. Although this was supposed to be a fresh bottle, nothing really stood out here for me. It almost tasted more like a lager. At 5% this should be quite sessionable but I will pass."
"I really liked this brew and the bottle when way to fast for me I would gladly by more of this brew if I could."
"Body is perhaps fuller than average for an American Pale Ale, but not out of line. Soft carb, not sticky, extremely drinkable; I'll have this any time I can get my hands on it."
"Quite drinkable, session pale for sure. I guess this one in my opinion basically compares to sn pale ale but with less of the roasted malt and bittering hop flavor profile. Possible more of a mellow wheat beer presence in the hops here which make it more preferable to girls?? Ill experiment on that and get back to you."
"D= A very interesting and unique west coast pale ale. Quite different from SNPA, with the esters playing a much larger role. Easily sessionable."
"Entire bomber poured into a weizen glass. Yep, that's right. Lovely golden orange color with about a half inch of white head that fell to a lasting cap, spotty sheets of lacing. Looks great! Good hoppy aroma here, but not overpowering in anyway, less grapefruit than I was suspecting, cut some citrus notes are there with a lightly malty component in the background. Good balance on this pale ale. Tastes more like an English style, but the American citrus-like hops do show up on the clean bitter finish. Malts are very mellow, not much sweetness, and pretty well balanced. Carbonation is just about perfect for this lighter bodied brew. Easy drinkin beer, light bitterness made this bomber go quickly. Great session brew."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink and very easy to session due to the lower ABV. A great balance of hops and malts, this is a solid entry in the very crowded America Pale Ale category. I will definitely drink this one again due to the low cost and great flavors."
"D- Fairly high. I like this beer and it'd be something I would buy frequently if it got shipped to the East Coast. Good stuff. One of the better Am. Pale Ales I can remember having."
"d - Very easy to drink. All around very balanced and pleasant."
"Overall, this beer just wasn't for me. I expected more hops. Way too much pale malt here. All of this combines for a beer that isn't too drinkable when a normal pale ale should be."
"Overall this beer is lacking in the flavor area. The bottle is about six months old so maybe I can find this fresh and amend my review."
"Easily the least impressive Deschutes beer I have yet had. It's a very basic pale ale, if overly bitter for the style. One of my favorite breweries in the universe proves they're mortal by brewing a merely ""good"" beer like Mirror Pond. I have lost no faith in them."
"Moderate carbonation and a light, creamy mouthfeel. Initial notes of soft, lemony hops that balance nicely with a strong biscuit and caramel malt backbone. Clean finish leaves only a traces of hop bitterness. Doesn't make as strong of an impression as some APA's, but very nicely done."
"drinkability - the cask pour really puts the beer on a level playing field and lets it shine. amazing pale for something so readily accessible."
"Drinkability is great, this would be an awesome session pale ale."
"Mirror Pond pale ale pours a good two fingers of loose, rocky foam over a clear orange brew. Carbonation is brisk and steady, the nose is fruity marmalade, a bit of yeasty funk, and spicy, medicinal hops. The flavor is bready malts with notes of lemon and a little mild herbal hops off the back. Mouthfeel is light and round, smooth and slightly dry. That a bit surprising as I was expecting it to be a bit more assertive, West Coast brewing practices being what they are. Altogether a pleasant, decently crafted offering in a very very broad field of similar ales. If they are your local brewery, by all means support them- the fresh stuff deserves your loyalty."
"M/D: Medium body, smooth feeling over the tongue. Carbonation is a touch on the higher side. Okay drinkability."
"D - Very nice, great for a spring afternoon. Full-flavored but not even slightly overbearing."
"D - All day long. Had to raise the ratings a bit from my previous review."
"Nice drinkability, but two or three would be enough. A pretty unique APA. It's good and interesting. I would have it again and at the $2.99 price point for a bomber, a good deal."
"Highly drinkable. I prepped myself for a binge with a couple glasses of water, and went to bed eight hours later for a good night's sleep. I recall walking to bed and locking the doors, and that's about it."
"Beer is sweet and medium to light in body. There is some bitterness at the back and well balanced. Some carbonation on the palate, its pretty good. Its simple and tasty. I like it."
"Slick mouth feel, mellow amalgam of the grapefruit-wood-bittering-sweet malts of the Pac NW APA..nicely executed...mellow and non aggressive with full flavor and satisfying character. A standard for the style"
"D-Refreshing and quite tasty, this one is perfect for warming weather that comes with spring in Minnesota."
"Not much better than sipping a Mirror Pond next to a mountain lake in Southern Oregon."
"great drinkability enjoy"
"EDIT: This beer continues to go downhill, Deschutes either expanded too far or something, because we just don't get the same fresh awesome mirror pond as it used to be."
"The flavor is also not real strong, and matches the aroma. This is not a complex beer, but is still solid. Medium bodied, with decent carbonation. I could see this being a nice session beer."
"Deschutes is in Minnesota, so I picked up a few to try. Mirror Pond is first, a little less hop forward than I was expecting and not a lot going on with the aroma. A pretty solid beer, but I'll stay local with Summit for a regular pale ale."
"Clear copper body. Thin and bubbly dirty white head. Lace is spotty and fairly abundant. Fresh lemon citrus hoppy aroma with a slight background of caramel malts. Quite the nice aroma. Fresh citrusy flavor too with a solid malt backbone. Again, I'd say more of a lemon citrus aspect than the expected grapefruit, but I'm not complaining. This is obviously fresh and very agreeable with my buds. Carbonation level is pretty high and this is quite quenching. Would lend itself very nicely to some spicy Thai or Vietnamese dishes."
"Drinkability - This is a good APA overall with slightly more rounded edges. Its got a noticeable sweetness, lacks the cut of citrus, but retains good presence of both its malt and hop flavors. I think this is solid within the context of the style, though overall I prefer less hop in my beer."
"D= This beer is excellent. 2.99 a bomber in MN right now and drinking excellent. Just enough complexity to keep ya guessing and just enjoyable enough to sip on year round. Great brew and thank you for coming to MN!"
"Pours a clear amber with about a finger of head. Odd smell... smells metallic and a bit like a port-a-potty or a freshly cleaned bathroom. Tastes a lot like a lager to me. It has a woody bitter taste in the back of the mouth. Sweet in the beginning, even a bit fruity like fresh berries. Very crisp and light, the flavor does not linger very long. At about 150% of the cost of Summit EPA, I will stick with my Summit, though the price isn't bad."
"pours a beautiful ruby color with a fresh 1 finger off white head with lots of clinging lace on side of the glass its almost perfect looking..the smell is crisp pine and crisp citrus and hops with a malt/caramel smell...the taste is very crisp its a piney citrus hit on the beer senses that follows with crisps hops/grapefruit it is balanced nicely with some caramel /malt and a bready taste ..the mouthfeel is full medium and nicely balanced this pale packs a whole lot of flavor at 5% and is oh so smooth and drinkable..my bomber went down fast..i also bought the black butte porter both @$2.99 what a buy"
"My first from Deschutes."
"Very good beer. Especially with the price point of $3/bomber around here, this might become a nice go-to beer, especially for those unexcited by beer geek chic. I can see myself having a few Mirror Ponds this summer as long as they keep coming in fresh from out West."
"Welcome to Minnesota, Deschutes!"
"A very refreshing yet complex pale ale suitable for a warm spring evening outside."
"Thank you Deschutes for coming to MN!"
"Superb on drinkability. Extremely well-rounded and quite tasty."
"Flavor is light, crisp...extremely drinkable. Heavy yeast flavor. There's a very slight 2nd wave of minimal hops, that dissapears faster than it hits. Having some issues picking out any perticular flavors. I would have to lean torwards a citrus...but that doesn't really help! Regardless, a solid pale ale."
"D - This was a more malt forward APA, but still very balanced with floral hop in the smell, and citrus notes in the flavor. Very very good, extremely drinkable, I could drink a 6-pack of this brew, and I think I'd buy this one again sometime. I recommend it. Cheers!"
"I probably would not order this one again because there are so many others I prefer."
"D: One of the most drinkable APA's I have had. Flavors are complex, but very tolerable for just about any palate. It's good to see these guys finally made it to Minnesota."
"D: An easy to drink pale ale, but nothing outstanding compared to some of the other pale ales out there."
"Overall - It's a classic. Tastes great and goes down easy. This was one of the first beers that really opened my eyes when I moved to the Northwest, and it's still a solid staple of mine."
"Impression: I would buy out my store of these, it is absolutely delicious, but sadly Deschutes doesn't ship here. This is a must drink."
"+ a great sessionable beer, and a well made APA. my only problem is with the aggressive carbonation."
"Wonderful, classic example of the style, a dead ringer. Great looking golden brew kettle copper with an off-white head. Highly refreshing cascade hop aroma, nothing overpowering to dull your senses, just enough to remind you its American. Sweet caramel malts are enjoyed in harmony with the great hoppy flavor. Terrific pale ale and highly sessionable. More Please!"
"Notes: Very similar to the bottled version with a fresher quality and better mouthfeel as it holds the texture much better. Remains a good and reliable pale ale."
"Drinkability: This beer is much closer to an IPA than a standard APA, which makes me wonder what Deschutes IPA and DIPA are like. Solid beer nonetheless."
"The body was a little on the thin side of medium. The feel was very slick with lively carbonation. Dry after the slickness in the mouth, it was easy to take another sip."
"For a Pale Ale this one was pretty strong and I tasted quite a bit of hops. I'm not used to having a pale ale that tastes more like an IPA. Again I purchased this one at a Wal-Mart for only $6 and well worth it to. I figured this beer to be a lot more for the price. The drinkability was great being able to enjoy them for the night but not getting too carried away with myself. I could classify this as better than the Sierra Nevada pale ale, one of my favorite beers. Would love to get some more of this and the price is too good to pass up."
"This is one of the first pale ales that I tried and loved from the instant I caught that great hoppy aroma. I have since appreciated hoppier brews but I enjoyed this in the beginning because there was more to it than hop. The appearance is golden with a little lace left behind. The smell isn't too strong. I could probably drink multiple pints because it always leaves me wanting another. Mouth feel is good but not much linger on this one. I would suggest this to anyone looking for a classy pale ale."
"Bottom Line: I am a HUGE fan of Deschutes. I give them the benefit of the doubt whenever I am selecting beers, but this one just seems to have missed the mark. I prefer the Red Chair NWPA to Mirror Pond."
"Drinkability: There are lots of good flavours here, but the slightly diluted feel spoils it. Pleasant enough, but I'm glad they were free. There are much more rewarding pale ales out there to enjoy."
"Overall, this beer is dry, yet refreshing. The brew remains bubbly and full of flavor through to the end. I don't know what the Mirror Pond in Oregon looks like, but I believe I know what that sensation tastes like after having this brew."
"If this APA has hops in it, I'm hard-pressed to find them. I just can't get past the malt. I know there are others who prefer the balanced English pale ale to the West Coast-sytle hop forward style, but I'm not one of them."
"D. This is a pretty good session beer. Kind of boring but easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Overall, a fairly typical example of an APA. Quite good, but not worth seeking out with all of the other choices out there."
"A tasty pale ale, well balanced. Worth a try for the price. Dechutes does it right with most beers. Recommended."
"Overall - A quality choice"
"D: one of the better APAs I've come across. aggressively hopped, while remaining semi-sweet. worth a try."
"Great beer to accompany a burger, but also great on its own."
"This was the first sixer from Deschutes that I bought from a supermarket where some fool didn't try to be slick and mix it with a bottle or two of Obsidian or Black Butte, but somehow that phenomenon is actually quite pleasing whenever people try to pull that. I've had bottles of this beer in sixers when trying to purchase Black Butte where it provided a nice change of pace but alone it doesn't really do it for me."
"Extra bonus - love the packaging!"
"I recently picked up some Mirror Pond for a special occasion party in which many of the guests had unrefined beer palettes, and it was like seeing an old friend again after many years apart..."
"Pours a three finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Piney almost grapefruit hop nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Favor is mild grapefruit hops with hints of sweetness. 12oz bottle - gift from Portland, OR."
"Mirror Pond was one of my favorite pale ales early on and while the competition's gotten pretty stiff, I still very much enjoy this beer."
"D- I found this to be a very drinkable ale. Its low ABV, fruity flavor, and crisp feel make it good for social occasions."
"I love Sierra, had it specifically at my wedding only with the mighty Pilsner Urquell, but this beer, 10 years later is my new pale ale. The malt balance with the subtle hops works for me, is it my age, maybe, but I love this beer, it's better than the always picked up flagship Porter, this is one of the better beers they make."
"I'm a fan of Obsidian and Black Butte by the same brewery. This isn't the kick-in-the-face hop bomb some people want, but it's got a lot of character, is perfectly balanced, and it's clear a lot of thought and experimentation went into making this beer."
"F: Finishes very clean and crisp. Touch of a bitter hop bite, but its not too much. Light and crisp, clears your palate very well with a nice bitter finish. Very nice tasting ale and very clean and crisp, nice crystal malt and good cascade hops. Another winner from Deschutes."
"Great APA, I have had a ton of this stuff. Mostly before I appreciated beer. Before it just seemed really bitter to me, but now that I have really gotten into beer I revisited it and I really enjoy it."
"M/ D - Very good APA. Nice balance of grapefruit, pine hops and caramel hops. Crisp and tasty. Lt to med mouthfeel and nice carb. Good session brew."
"Nice golden amber color, big creamy, frothy light red head. Leaves moderate lace, nothing special. The nose is very nice and indicates an unbalanced beer-I mean this in a good way. nice red malt notes, almost like the nose on an Imperial red just more muted. piney, citrusy, not so much floral. Aroma matches the taste spot on. like an imperial red or amber/pale ale hybrid. Nice ripe ruby grapefruit, pine notes and bitter orange peel. I found this beer to be welcome-ly hoppy for a pale ale. Would put this next to New Dogtown and Sierra nevada as very tasty, hoppy, sessionable Pale Ales."
"Overall impression: If you're looking for a solid, sessionable APA, look no further."
"What a pleasant experience to drink this beer - the first taste was quite appealing - good mouthfeel, great taste. Easy to keep drinking. Enjoyable by itself. . .but it goes well with poultry dishes, especially. Tried some of their other beers, too - very good, although not necessarily my preference of style This one's a winner, though."
"D: well balanced and not overly bitter, yum"
"D- Extremely drinkable but not very interesting. I could kick these back all night."
"This is on my list as something I would buy again, but not seek out."
"This is not a hop bomb by any means so some will probably call this a weak version of a pale ale. Personally, I think it is a fine example of the style...balanced, tasty and infinitely drinkable."
"Had this beer again and would agree with the above. Not really a stand out. Color was a light copper with a light hop aroma. Flavor also had a light hops, nothing outstanding but not bad at all."
"Drinkability: My least favorite from what I have tried from the brewery so far. This to me is just an above average APA. I would like to try it again, but could not see myself having anymore than two per sitting."
"D- Nice hoppy flavor that is easily sessionable."
"In a lot of ways this is a middle of the road pale ale, but quite well executed. Worth a try, and would be a great session beer."
"Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into my nonic pint glass. Mirror Pond appears a hazed apricot color with about an inch of dense off white foam. The head leaves a noticeable lace in its wake. Aromas and flavors are of toasted biscuits, citrus such as lemon peel and white grapefruit, some pine, sweet caramel. Decent body with ample carbonation. A nice session APA."
"sixer from the Liquor Depot, Rock Springs, WY...best by 10/29/09"
"3.5 D: All around average or worse."
"Drinkability: quite quaffable."
"D: Gone in a flash, 4 more please!"
"D - This was a very enjoyable pale that I could easily session for the night easy to drink with a good taste worth picking up sometime"
"friends of mine moved out to nor-cal, and immediately raved about this beer. so i got it in on trade. and it's delightful. poured out of the bottle into my NY giants pint glass. it had a thin and easy aromatic head. My initial response was wow, this tastes like i just poured a long trail into a sierra nevada. and it really is right in between the two. it looks great with a dark golden color with lots of carbonation throughout. the smell is light and clean. This beer is so clean and smooth you can shower in it if you want. Too bad this is my last one, i am always up for a trade for this so if you see this and you got it, let me know your style."
"Dusty malt up front with some subtle fruitiness; solid hop bitterness but not overwhelming hop flavors. Hops are subtle, but some green herbal flavors give it a nice fresh finish. Dry, balanced pale ale with a subtle PNW hop flare. A classic session beer or one to take on a hike or camping trip."
"D: Doable, just very basic."
"Drinkability - 4.5/5.0 - A good solid beer that I would definitely get again."
"Overall - Good beer, not outstanding but worth trying. Definitely a good option when the selection is limited."
"Overall this is a good Pale Ale, especially if you like cascade hops, or if you really like hops in general."
"D- This pale ale goes down very easy and also has a great aftertaste. I would definitely buy again."
"Highly quaffable. We don't get many Descutes products down here and this could certainly be a hot day go-to."
"BB: 09/30/09"
"Pours amber with a thick, rocky head that slowly collapses to a thin cap. Smells of light, earthy hops, some grassiness, and a touch of malt. The hops are a little more prevalant in the taste, but the beer is a little grainy. Citrusy hops, grain, some sweet malt, more body than the smell would suggest. In fact, perhaps just a tad too thick from the graininess and malt, but not too sweet, thankfully. Pleasant enough that I wouldn't be upset if this was the only thing on-tap somewhere worth drinking."
"D- An above-average, middle-of-the-road brew suitable for a wide range of occasions."
"D. A very balanced drinkable pale ale that I finished quite quickly. This 6 pack wont last long at all I assume."
"This is probably my least favorite ale in Deschutes' very fine year round lineup. A good beer and very affordable in Salem, OR."
"Tending towards the dry side with some slight lingering bitterness."
"The taste is similar, with lightly toasty grain with a faint caramelized bready hint, slightly burnt grapefruit and orange peel, some green leaves, light sweetness and balancing light bitterness with grapefruit, orange, leaf. It's good and drinkable, although its character is a bit too tied to grapefruity-citrusy hops, which makes it seem a little one-dimensional to that style and reduces the score for me, making it seem more mundane as well"
"D_A well done pale ale that I would drink often if readily available."
"D: Easy to drink, but solid and interesting enough to go back for more."
"Poured with an average-sized, off-white head. Hazy-bodied, and a nice, dark-orange color. Aroma was mostly of hops, with some very fetching citrus as well. Medium-bodied on the palate, creamy texture, and average carbonation. Very nice flavor that ends moderately bitter and stays with you for a while. Overall, another excellent APA that I experienced in the same time frame as some other great examples of the style."
"Drinkability: Easy-going and hardly made a dent, even after the second one. Drinks easy and tastes solid, definitely a solid and enjoyable sessioning beer."
"This is what I consider to be a mediocre and pedestrian pale ale. I expect better things from Deschutes, especially with hop-centric beers."
"Very drinkable, solid session beer with enough character to make it worthy"
"A pretty drinkable brew overall. A well made APA."
"A very solid, sessionable Pale Ale from a great brewer. Didn't knock my socks off but didn't disappoint either. I've got to seek this out again!"
"Drinkability - Sierra Nevada curb stomps the crap outa this beer. It is highly poundable due to it's light body. If you lived in Oregon a sixer would make for a nice session beer at a gathering."
"The appearence is a clear copper color with some nice white lacing and almost zero head. THe nose has some piney hop and a fail amount of malt in there as well. Taste is some slight hop bitterness with a light malt taste coming through and taking over. A slight grassy hop taste at the end. Mouthfeel is medium with nice carbonation. Overall a pretty modest pale ale. Good but nothing to get excited about."
"overall an above average beer and a very good pale ale."
"Pours a light amber color that is slightly hazy with a fluffy finger of head that eventually dissolves and leaves a nice layer atop the glass. The aroma has caramel malt and a floral bouquet of hops. Flavor pretty much mirrors the aroma with a gentle citrus bitterness that lingers. Its medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation. I've had this beer numerous times, both from the bottle and on-tap, its definitely my fall back beer if nothing else is looking appetizing."
"Pours slightly hazy golden color with good sized white head that leaves nice lace. Nose is very citrusy-hoppy, especially lemon and grapefruit. Palate is somewhat sharp with the citrusy-hop profile again, though the malt sweetness in the background is quite pleasant. This is one of the easiest drinking hoppy ales I've encountered in a long time."
"Yeah, this is a nice APA. Bright, golden body with a fluffy white head. It diminishes in fairly short order, but just above it, wafting out of the glass, is a fresh citrusy yet sorta grassy hop nose. Nicely balanced taste profile. A bit of malt that's wonderfully offet by some tingling on the tongue from the hops. Not a ton of bittering hops; just a well-balanced brew. Mouthfeel is medium, just where I think an APA should be. Drinkability; kick butt. I consider SNPA to be a the benchmark of APAs, and damn tough to beat. But I'd rather have Mirror Pond."
"Bought a six pack of this at the grocery store. Poured into a stemless wine glass. Slightly murky orange and copper hue with a nice little cream head. Fresh hop aroma reminds me of dandelions covered with honey. Alcohol is evident on the nose after 20 minutes of warming. Taste is sunny with solid caramel base. Hints of lemon or grapefruit. Enough carbonation to perk the buds without that over-tingling sensation. At 5% abv, I could drink this brew all night long. I think I will."
"D - Definitely not a horrible brew, its not offensive by any means, it just doesn't really have much complexity or intensity to it. Refreshing and wouldn't have trouble putting a few down, really not a standout though, in my opinion."
"The mouth on this is weak and wet. Too watery for my liking. Knocks drinkability down a notch. Flavor is a little muted as well. It's not offensive at all, just slightly absent. Some malts and a slight bitter finish. This beer is not bold in any way, and I think it needs to be in the flavor. This could be tweaked a little. Not bad, but I've had much better."
"D: Balanced. Smooth. Refreshing. Definitely one of the best APAs and session brews available. Just another day for Deschutes!"
"D: Not for the faint of heart, a pretty wild Pale Ale offering. Not a bad choice at all considering how many places that I found it available, a rock solid go-to Micro that's easy to find. My first Deschutes and they've definitely got me interested in trying more."
"Overall, I'm kinda disappointed in the Mirror Pond. I have really fond memories of this beer from when my sister lived in Oregon and she would send some back to me. I'm gonna say that the bottle isn't as fresh as it could be and probably has something to do with my lower score here."
"Verdict: Mirror Pond is a great example of the American Pale Ale style. While not the most complex beer out there, this does make for a very solid session beer. I can't wait to see what these guys are cooking as far as IPAs and Double IPAs go."
"Simple, but very enjoyable. Something that is going to be in my fridge more often. Recommended."
"Overall Impression: Very easy to drink, the first one went down in minutes. I enjoyed this beer a lot, but I would expect more hop flavors and balance more towards the hops in American Pale Ale. That said it is still a great beer."
"A better version of Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. Extremely high drinkability and perfect amount of hops, does not overload it as a lot of these West Coast beers are apt to. I wish I could easily find this back on the East Coast as it's my favorite example of an APA."
"Worth seeking out, this should be considered a solid go-to beer, suitable for quenching thirst after yard work or introducing someone to the world of craft beer."
"Great sessionable pale. Doesn't knock your socks off. Awesome deal at $6.99 a sixer on sale."
"D: A strong example of an APA. Some wonderfully brilliant cascade hops thouroghly dominate, producing a crisp beer. Well done. Recommended to any Pale Ale fan."
"Pours and orange amber with an inch thick head. There was a bunch of sediment in the beer. It ahd an herbal floral hoppy smell. Sweet malt floaral flavors up front and a tingly mouthfeel due to the carbonation. There is a lingering bitterness from the hops, but all other flavors die out. Good flavor and drinkability."
"Some malty bite on the finish with sweetness."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite pale ale, but a very good example of the style. Well balanced and flavored, but just doesn't quite fit my tastes."
"Overall, a very respectable example of APA."
"Translucent tangerine color with a frothy off-white head. Pulpy, unripe grapefruit aroma with a little bit of caramel and a little pale malt. Flavor is pale malty with grapefruit drupelets and some light esters. Maybe even a hint of cantaloupe rind? Biscuity malt rather than the more typical (and tasty) caramel flavor in most pale ales. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an understated carbonation that makes for a smooth sip. High drinkability but low complexity and a little too weak in all areas."
"D. Probably my go to at peoria spring training. Really hard to do this on the BlackBerry ..."
"Same citrus/grapefruit in the flavor as in the aroma. The flavor is quite a bit more balanced. Lot's of toasty sweet malts. Kind of like a toasted sweet bread. Perfectly balanced, light on the palate, easy to drink. The perfect session beer. Deschutes may very well have the best regular offerings of any brewery in the nation."
"im jealous of people who can get this regularly...."
"M/D - Medium bodied with excellent carbonation levels. The beer finishes on the sweeter side and that taste lingers. Very easy drinking pale ale."
"D: A decent brew but for an APA this one falls short of its early promise."
"A good well balanced hoppy pale with a slight bitterness/astringency with the finish, a definite session beer."
"D - Great pale ale. The smell and taste could be a little better to leave me in complete awe."
"Aroma is caramel matls with a slightly citrus/spicy hops. A bit of orange even. Taste is very light malt and some overbearing bitterness. Slightly watery mouth with lots of soft carbonation."
"Drinkability- Very smooth drinking and versatile. A good middle of the road session brew. It's mine in this category."
"The taste is light but compliments the tongue nicely. It is not nearly as bitter as some other pale ales. The fresh hop flavor shines through and its a real refreshing beer. The sweetness of the malt is also a plus in that it gives the beer good balance.. not too bitter, not too sweet. Its pretty awesome that pretty much every restraunt, gas station and bar up here (at least in the PDX and Olympia, WA area.. I have yet to spend much time in Seattle) has it available."
"I feel like it got more hoppy as I drank it. As it warmed a little bit, it released some more of it's flavor. If you like Cascade Hops, this one's for you."
"Mighty fine pale ale!"
"Would have loved some more hops in the smell, would have made this beer excellent if it had some more aroma hops in there."
"Pours an amber orange colored body, with a rocky off-white head, somewhat lasting, with decent lacing. Dusty hoppy, somewhat grapefruity aroma. Some malty sweetness too, but mostly hops. Muted aroma. Light flavor, sweet, some hops. Somewhat sweet aftertaste, malty. Nice carbonation. Hoppy grapefruity taste. Very tasty, a nice hoppy session ale. Some fruitiness."
"An amazingly drinkable Pale. Bitterness is there and does have a bite, but it is not tongue-scraping or unpleasant in any way. More of a grassy hop flavor rather than extreme bitterness. Malts are there only to provide a short burst of sweet grainy balance. This would be a dangerous beer to have on tap as the beer is not sipped, it's gulped. One hell of a beer that everyone needs to try."
"Pours a orange/copper with a golden-toned beige head. Significant lacing. Smell is strong of floral hops. The taste is even stronger of bitter, citrusy hops. However, there is a malty sweetness underlying the initial bitterness of the hops. Mouthfeel is crisp, not too acidic. This is a fine example of an APA -- lots of bitter hops with a good offset of sweetness."
"Pours a nice, typical light amber-orange color with an ok head that doesn't leave too much lace (I somewhat suspect it's really the glass though). The nose is wonderfully and intensely floral. Lots of cascade. The taste is a nice balance of sweet and bitter. Love the hops and nice light maltiness of this beer. For a pale ale, it's a phenomenal beer."
"One of the Northwest classics. If you're wondering with a US Northwest American Pale Ale tastes like, try this. It easily rises above most other options in the supermarkets, yet sets you back less than a sixer of piss Euro lager. In my opinion, not quite as tasty as Sierra Nevada's pale, but an outstanding beer on all accounts."
"On tap at the Yardhouse in Long Beach. Aroma has some citrus/pine hops in there...cascade. Color is a golden amber with a small off-white head. Flavor is a wonderful balance between malt and hops, biscuity, toasty, a little caramel without being sweet, while still being hop forward. light to medium bodied with a dry finish. A very nice example of an APA."
"had this on tap a couple of times and loved it. the bottle might not be quite as nice (best before date is March) but still a very good apa."
"D- no problem drinking this one all night and often."
"One of the Northwest's premier session beers. While it may not capture the attention that Deschutes big beer offerings like the Abyss, this may be one of the best entry points for the macro-beer head to delve into craft beers. Two finger head, nice lacing from pale orange body. Not overly hoppy, but damn you could certainly quaff a few of these on a hot summer day. Pairs with most any food. Not an overly bold statement from one of the country's biggest and best craft brewers, but certainly one of their best. Worth seeking out if you can find on cask."
"Drinkability: Remarkably easy to drink without tasting dumbed-down or simple; in short, a great session beer."
"Bottle: Poured a bright copper color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of medium citrus hops with a good caramel malt base. Taste is also a good mix between some caramel malt with some lightly citrus and bitter hops. Very refreshing with good carbonation. Very well done for the style."
"TM&D - Citrusy and earthy with a nice malt backbone to balance it. Very refreshing and drinkable beer. Nice hops after taste and exhale through the nose. It was a real pleasure to savor this one. Make me think of a summer day (not in Arizona, but someplace pleasure in the summer)."
"D - easy drinking brew."
"I always will buy this beer when looking for a good pale ale. Deschutes is the shit."
"M/D: smooth brew that offers a strong hop bite while still being highly drinkable. This could be a great session ale."
"It's a great everyday beer."
"7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"Drinkability is very good and a deal at a buck a bottle."
"A good standard for a fresh Oregon Pale."
"Drinkability could not be better. Perfect ale for any time of day, any time of the year. I am very impressed with this Pale Ale and will seek it out again."
"This is a decent beer, but I do think that there are other APA's that are better."
"Cheers."
"Pours a light amber in color, clear with a thin brown/white head. Aroma is nice, slight maltiness with a blend of pine. Taste is predominately hops (very piney) with some malt and an aftertastee of cereal grains. The aftertaste is not overpowering, but a pleasant mix not bitter from the hops. Good texture but on the thin side, light body. Excellent flavor, very well balanced. Great session beer."
"Either that or make more trips down to the Grand Canyon as I had this on tap at the El Tovar Cocktail Room. It's well worth drinking, especially if you can find it and enjoy a simple but well-done APA."
"An excellent APA and I like seeing this one around."
"Delicious, and one of the better pales I've had recently. I'm not a fan of pales, but this one definitely stands out as a winner among the category, with some solid flavors and just enough character to keep it interesting. If pales is your thing, this is a must try. And definitely worth trying a bottle or two regardless."
"This is an easy beer to sit down and session. No sign of alcohol to be found in the taste, smooth going down, readily available and cheap. A nice offering from the good folks from Oregon."
"As pales go, this is a very good beer. Pours clear amber with a medium white head. Malty with some hops and a nice citrus back. Consistent throughout. Clean taste. Better than a Sierra, but about the same in every category as a Firehouse with less hops."
"Overall: good for any occasion"
"D: Very drinkable. Solid pale ale."
"Taste is sweet malts with a good amount of citrus hops for balance. Caramel, fair amount of grapefruit, pineapple, orange, medium bitter finish. One of my favorite go-to Pale Ales, hard to fault in any way. Lucky to live in Oregon where this fine brew can be found almost anywhere! Abv on label of 5.0% makes this a very fine session beer."
"D - Easy to drink with a good amount of hops here."
"pours a nice amber with a 1/4 inch and and a lot of carbonation. leaves behind a little lace, but not a ton. smells slightly of honey and hops. tastes of floral hops and slight yeast. leaves a sweet bready taste in your mouth. an alright pale, but not the best thing i've ever had."
"D. Very nice. Liked it better than most brews with citrus flavors I've tried."
"D: This is a really tasty beer. It is simple and it works for this beer. Its smells and tastes are very accessible and in no way overwhelming. This is an easily sessionable brew that has some flavor to it. This beer is easy to put down and does the job. Very nice indeed."
"D- Easy to drink. I like it, might become a session beer."
"pours a light copper with a two finger head that fades fast. Nose is citrus and herbal hops, with light caramel and breadyness. More malt on the palate than hops, with a crisp finish and light bitterness. Very drinkable, makes a nice SNPA alternative."
"Pours a light clear copper with off white head, no lacing with this beer. Smells fresh and piney. Tastes slightly of citrus, but smooth with a light creaminess. Not a lot of hops, more of an aftertaste. I would probably opt for another pale ale over this one."
"Drinkability: Nice tasting PA, would get again, nothing too crazy, very drinkable."
"Pretty solid Pale Ale. Not the best, not the worst. Subtle flavors that go well together and a nice, smooth finish. Probably would opt for Sierra Nevada or Firestone over this one."
"A man's beer. Not for the timid, despite only being 5.0% alcohol as listed on the label."
"D: good all night drinker, middle of the road."
"D - I've had many pale ale's, but this one impressed me quite a bit. Very drinkable, a good session beer."
"D: Easy to drink, refreshing, tastes like it would go great with pretzels or chips and dip. The hop flavor is really nice, and I would definitely drink this beer again."
"Appearance has a golden brown hue to it with minimal head. Smell is a slightly sweet malt and light bread. Taste has a nice balance of malt and hops with light grapefruit. Mouthfeel is a slick medium with a light carbonation spike that goes down easy. Nothing fancy just a good easy drinking ale."
"Copper color, with nice citrus smell and a touch of metallic potpourri. Pretty thin head with very little lacing. Taste is very good, like a pale ale should be. Refreshing with just the right kick of hops. A little bitter, but definitely acceptable. Drinkability is high and there is not much else to say that others haven't already. Top-notch stuff."
"Note: Beer labeled as 5.0% ABV with an 11/19/2008 freshness date."
"Yet another good beer from Deschutes. Something that would go good with dessert or maybe even Chinese"
"Another very drinkable beer by Deschutes. Great session beer."
"A well-balanced, fine example of an American Pale Ale!"
"D - A great APA, makes a great session beer."
"The drinkability is also quite nice for a low key brew. Prosit, MK"
"Tasty yet simple."
"D: this is probably my favorite session pale ale. i love to drink this beer, and multiple ones. great beer."
"D: Definitely drinkable, not my favorite APA but one I would definitely not mind having again."
"Though there's nothing really special about this beer, it is eminently drinkable. A very good session beer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date into a pint glass. It was a somewhat hazy orange color with some carbonation. A little lacing. It had a small head that quickly dissipated into a thin collar with a little foam in middle. The aroma was Cascade hops, grapefruit and some malt in the back. Standard APA aroma. The taste was nice and crisp with a good hop bite. After drinking a bunch of hop bombs lately it was refreshing to get a nice hop bite that didn't shred the tongue. Overall, it's a solid beer that delivers great taste without tricking it up. At 5.5% it could be a session beer or just a nice couple beer change-up. Goes down smooth in the 104 heat in Texas."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Best by 08/28/08 clearly etched on the side of the label. Pours a very attractive looking amber color with a nice off-white head that has very good retention and very sticky leaving a good amount of lacing around the glass. The aroma is sweet malt and floral citrusy hops. The taste has a pretty solid malt backbone, but the hops are clearly the focus in this one. This is a very tasty and refreshing brew. The mouthfeel is thin-medium bodied with a slightly creamy mouthfeel and a good amount of carbonation. Overall, Mirror Pond Pale Ale is another excellent beer from an outstanding brewery. Recommended."
"D: While this is not a hard beer to drink, I feel it is lacking overall."
"D-This is really, really good beer. For a session type beer that comes in 6pks this gets it done. I am looking at the lacing on my glass and noticed that every drink left a ring and every ring got bigger. I could drink a ton of this one and enjoy every sip."
"I think I liked this one better from the bottle."
"I found this a little nicer than Deschutes other pale ale. It has an amber color and a good tan head. The nose has a solid bouquet of hops backed by soem rich malts. The taste is a nice blend of sweet malts and bitter hops. Fairly light body has good carbonation. Another session from Deschutes."
"This may not be the most adventurous example of an American Pale Ale, but it is among the best."
"Drinkability is high. Good flavors, low alcohol, easy to consume. A great session."
"D: highly drinkable example of APA. Nice balance, not as ""obvious"" as some pale ales. Great beer, definitely worth trying. I wish I could get this in KY."
"Tasted on 5/1/08, but labeled as best by 2/19/08... Ooops!"
"There's nothing overly stand-outish about this brew, except for how solidly it's put together. Everything is done in great balance and I feel like I could drink a lot of this stuff if I had a lot more. Overall just a really nicely done beer."
"I don't have a lot to say about this beer. Kind of reviewing in a hurry, but it's a nicely balanced beer that I could drink all day long."
"Balance is way off to the hop bitterness side. That's atypical of the APAs I've tried. Nice change of pace."
"D- A great APA. Any APA lover would love this, goes great with a meal(or without one)."
"A good solid 4 to me...pours golden orange with 2 finger, fluffy white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is of some hops and a bit of caramel almost, some sweetness at least. Taste is good, a great example for this style. A nice kiss of hops, nothing too overwhelming with a good malt backbone. It does have a different hop profile than its more famous cousin SNPA, but I really couldnt tell you what kind of hops it is. A nice light feel to it, carbonation is moderate. An easy drinker, good taste and good example of an APA."
"The drinkability on this one is off the charts. It is a perfect summer ale for the hot arizona summers, and it is a staple in my fridge for the summer. It is also a nice one as a transition beer for friends who come over who say they dont like craft beer... mild but yet bold flavors in this one can change peoples mind about what they should expect out of beer. Not an IIPA but that is why I love it.. a true summer thirst quencher, and at only 5.5% it is easily sessionalble around a bbq in the hot summer sun!"
"Deschutes brews some quality beer. This isn't one of my favorites from them but it is a solid pale ale. This is a very well balanced pale ale."
"Overall, this beer could be good fresh. its a little sweet and has very little hoppy notes. I'd try it again just to confirm or debunk what I wonder about this beer."
"Carbonation seems perfectly matched with the other characteristics of the beer."
"This is the Michael Rappaport of beers, good, but underappreciated. Tastes better than a B+"
"D: This one certainly isn't the most complex or daring APA, but I have to admit that I wouldn't mind throwing a few of these back on this warm spring night. Very sessionable."
"Poured into pint glass from the bottle. It is golden orange in color and has a creamy off white head which dissapates to a sticky lace. The nose is citusy hops with hidden malt notes. The taste is refreshing hop forward and has a nice bitter bite on the finish. Good mouthfeel for the style, and again if more widely available would drink it as a session beer more often."
"The color is a medium yellow. The aroma is stronger than you might expect of a pale ale; malt and some citrus in there, too. Taste is a nice blend of malt, citrus, and hints of some spices that are hard to put my finger on. An intriguing pale ale, one of the better ones out there, and one I could drink one after another."
"IBUs: 40"
"237 reviews as of this writing. I liked this beer. I decided to match it up with a spicy taco salad for dinner and I was quite happy with the results. West coast inspired, balanced and quite quaffable. Sent my way by a kind BA. I would have this again."
"This beer is a nice beer, and it serves its niche, but I may not buy this again just not my style."
"this beer is very drinkable one of my new favorites"
"Overall this is one of my favorite Pale Ales. Another outstanding offering from Deschutes and the great state of Oregon. The Pacific Northwest has become a staple to me for great beer."
"A bit of weird breadiness keeps this one from getting bought be my every time i'm at Deschutes. I didn't taste it so much in one of the two MP taste-samplers that I had last week, so maybe the new recipe will make this my new Deschutes favorite!"
"Drinkability: Very nicely balanced example of a west coast-inspired pale ale"
"The first thing I noted is that this is a bit darker than a lot of pale's. Certainly darker than Sierra Nevada, which I guess is my comparison point for pale ales. More orange than amber. Nice crisp smell with citrus hops. The taste was basically the same as the smell, with clean malt and plenty of C hops. Plenty carbonated, but easy to drink. This is probably my new favorite West Coast APA."
"overall, a pretty good beer....probably won't see it till i head out west again."
"Caramel honey colored pour with a lasting creamy head. Smell is of an almost berry like hoppiness at first, but it fades into a light hoppy, almost metallic smell as it opens up. Taste is mildish hoppiness, with a sweet finish at first, and then after a few sips a hoppy light bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. Maybe it was just my tummy today, but this seemed fairly acidic after it went down. Not a bad pale ale at all, either way. There are more I like better, but I could still have this again."
"D - Excellent. This is a gem among APAs. I've had before, I'll have again. It stands alongside SNPA as the best APA available, at least in my mind."
"Overall a pretty solid American pale ale and would be a quality session beer. Amber in color, decent white head that stuck around for a while, Piney Northwest hop flavor dominated the smell, light malty flavor on the taste with a little fruitness that is excentuated by the dominant hops but it's not near the hop level of an IPA or Sierra Nevada, a touch of biscuit flavor as well. Finishes fairly clean without any bad aftertaste. Nothing to write home about but better than your average fair. Although I bet this one goes down fast and gets rated higher on a hot summer day."
"Overall: I didnt expect much, so I wasnt let down. I just moved to a beer wasteland, but I can find this everywhere. I assume I will have this on hand a lot since there is not much else. Give me a few years, and I assume I will grow to love it."
"an all time classic pale ale, next to maybe only the sierra nevada, but this pale is stronger and can stand alone as an adventure a little more, deschutes does a good job of keeping their beer developing, where some of the other large micros start to remain the same, stagnant in their creations, deschutes pale mirror tastes a little different every time."
"Drinkablity: Decent brew, a bit tamer than I expected."
"This beer was my first introduction to Deschutes over a year ago; I had it on tap then, but it has always tasted as it did that day. I'm a great Deschutes fan, and this one is classic."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice beer to drink several of over the course of an evening."
"When it arrived at the table, the beer had little head on top and a hazy amber/tawny body. There are two things you need to know about this beer: caramel and piney citrus. The first half is a wave of malt, and the second half closes out on a pleasant hop note. It leaves a bready and sweet aftertaste on the palate. A little heavy for a pale ale, but it cleaned my palate of the extreme spiciness from the dinner I had."
"Pour light amber with a decent head that quickly disappears leaving just a little lace. Moderate bready malt with slightly perfumey hops smell and a hint of sourness. The sourness isn't exactly unpleasant, but it doesn't really add positively either. The flavor is good with a nicely balanced malt base and moderate hop bitterness, leading into an acidic and bitter finish that is relatively long lived. The aftertaste also picks up a hint of sourness as it warms up. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with nice dry texture, lively carbonation, and a slightly astringent finish. Overall this is a nice, clean pale ale that goes well with a variety of foods, especially grilled meats. It isn't too overhwelming, and the flavors are generally good but not overly complex."
"Pours a clear gold/orange with some head that leaves a good bit of lacing. Nose is hoppy and sweet. Taste is heavy with hops with a firm citric/sweet edge to it. Almost like a cross between a lemon and an orange. Feel is what you'd expect - has a little carbonation to it, and it feels good on the tongue. Extremely drinkable."
"D: its understated, but its great flavor adds to its drinkability"
"As far as I am concerned this is the staple of deschuttes brewery. Black butte is good stuff but this is quite possibly the most floral Pale on the american market. This beer pours like a normal pale, light amber in color with decent head. The nose smells like a florists shop. Fresh grass and flowers come out in the strong cascade hop flavor. Very smooth and not bitter at all. A very unique pale. great brew."
"This brew is a staple in my home.... You can get in nearly anywhere for good reason. Non offensive to nearly everyone and any ""good"" beer drinker this could easily qualify as a session and frequently does for me. Deschutes is a world class brewing company.. and gets a significant portion of my beer budget."
"Drinkability: Mirror Pond is a well made beer by a great brewery, but I'm never going to fall in love with a hop-forward pale ale that isn't very hoppy."
"Mirror Pond is a classic American Pale. It pours a nice amber color with a nice foam head that leaves some nice lacing. The smell is fruity. The taste is malty up front in a biscuit sort of a way. Then it is fruity and finishes with a dryness on tongue like a dry white wine. I highly recommend this to anyone."
"Overall: I like my beers a little more aggressive when it comes to hops, but this one was still nice. There is a nice gentle mix of malt and hops which would make it a perfect gateway beer."
"Mouthfeel's about average for a pale ale. Not a hot weather thirst quencher. Pairs up well with just about any meal. I like this beer a lot."
"Clean crisp citrus hops followed by good malt backing for the style that really adds to a wonderful mouthfeel on this beer. Good carbonation, overall a highly drinkable west coast pale."
"D: A good beer, not great, drinkable, but I've had better pales, though not a bad beer for any means, certainly a good try for those hop fans on the West Coast."
"This beer is highly drinkable...it'll scratch your hop itch, but light enough to have a few. Definitely recommended."
"Cascade hops at their finest."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Nice hazy orange color with a substantial white head. This looks unfiltered. Smell is some slight hops but not to an IPA level. The taste also has some citrus hoppiness but nowhere near IPA levels. Nice malt background makes this an excellent pale ale. Deschutes is really doing great things with their beers. The drinkability on this beer is pretty awesome."
"This beer is well balanced. The perfect pale ale for any occasion. Pours a light amber. White head that leaves good subtle traces. The session drinker would be happy to have several. The aroma is good, but nothing to write home about. The taste does deliver for a well rounded pale ale."
"Pours a hazy golden orange with an adequate white head that drops off steadily leaving tracks of sticky lacing. The aroma is excellent. Bright floral hops with a touch of yeast and caramel malt. The taste is about all you can expect from an APA. Great balance between the hop bitterness and malt sweetness with just the right amount of prickly carbonation. This is a delicate brew that needs to be consumed as fresh as possible in order to enjoy it for what it really is."
"At the time I reviewed this, it was the best pale ale I had tried. Since then, it's been supplanted by quite a few others, most notably 3Floyd's Alpha King."
"drinkability: good"
"Could drink several of these, especially in the summer time when it was tasted"
"D: Goes down easy - would make a solid session beer - and very refreshing after a day of listening to your sister and 1-1/2 year old nephew scream at each other."
"Most of the country would probably call this an English IPA, but it is definitely a Pacific NW pale ale. The front tones are hops, all wet and pungent. Really just stick to the tongue, cheeks and teeth. Malts balance it all out nicely with a sugary background. Medium to full body with the typical heavy water feel of NW beers. Just a great all around pale ale."
"Comment: Excellent hop flavor and mild carbonation make this an enjoyable beer for a lingering hot summer day."
"Pour light amber with a decent head that quickly disappears leaving just a little lace. Moderate bready malt with slightly perfumey hops smell and a hint of sourness. The sourness isn't exactly unpleasant, but it doesn't really add positively either. The flavor is good with a nicely balanced malt base and moderate hop bitterness, leading into an acidic and bitter finish that is relatively long lived. The aftertaste also picks up a hint of sourness as it warms up. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with nice dry texture, lively carbonation, and a slightly astringent finish. Overall this is a nice, clean pale ale that goes well with a variety of foods, especially grilled meats. It isn't too overhwelming, and the flavors are generally good but not overly complex."
"Likely one of the best APA's I have had in ages, perhaps ever. Thanks to my mother-in-law for bringing this back as part of a nice beer haul she picked up for me on a recent visit home to San Francisco. Poured a pale orange with a great looking head and thick, sticky lacing. Smell was candy sweet hops with some pine resin and sweet toasted malts. If this beer is only one thing, it's balanced. In smell and taste. Plenty of hops in the taste, be well off-set by the sweet malts. I wouldn't mind having a case or so of this down stairs. Fantastic!"
"Drinkability: This is easily drinkable, and very sessionable. I like it more after it warms close to room temperature, and that is how I would go through a six pack without realizing it."
"Drinkability- This is a really tasty beer that can easily be drank in great quantities. There are other beers out there that I would rather drink on a daily basis but still a quality beer."
"Overall, a great beer, and a fantastic sessional beer. I really wish I could normally get this as its relatively lower alc level (bottle says 5%), but high flavor content would make a great one to have all night."
"Pours a golden orange with 2 fingers of head that slowly dies down. Nice lace. Smells of strong hops and citrus with mild rind and malt. Tastes wonderful of hops citrus and a nice balance of malt. Feel light and crisp in the mouth with great carbonation. Another sessionable beer which I have done myself in with tonight. Delightful and recommended."
"D: Goes down very easy. Overall a very good APA. The ""go-to"" beer for me and a number of my friends."
"At 5.0% and ample complexity for the style, the drinkability is out the roof. This one replaced SNPA as my go to pale ale/session beer. Great pale ale."
"Light mouthfeeel,very dry with grainy textures. Easy to drink,could drink a few,a bit boring to drink all night. Overall somewhat of a let down. The aroma was the best part makes this beer worth a try."
"D - Effortlessly drinkable, this beer exhibits a great marriage of hops and malt without overwhelming the palate. I think its a bit better on tap, but out of the bottle it is still a go-to beer when you just want something drinkable."
"Pours a cloudy copper with orange and gold tones. Medium to large foamy, creamy, head; good lacing. Aroma is sweet dough, coconut, a touch of butter, and faint citrus tones. Juicy, medium-bodied mouthfeel. Flavor is mellow and well-balanced with lighter bread and sourdough malts, distant butter, caramel, suds, and bitter (though restrained) pine and floral hops. Aftertaste is clean and lightly soapy."
"An off-white head capped this hazy amber beer. Head retention was pretty good and there was some chunky lacing. The aroma was mostly fruity, floral hops, but there was a bit of hop spiciness and mild malt present as well. Moderate bitterness with malt sweetness held fairly low. Up front, hops were orange and tangerine, towards the end more grapefruit. Lightish bodied with carbonation that started out crisp and lively, but mellowed to smooth out the texture at the end of the glass. Quite a nice pale ale that makes for enjoyable summer drinking."
"Pours a light copper golden color with tight head of tiny bubbles that dissapates relatively quickly. Carbonation is low to medium. Aroma is carmel and malty sweet with citrus hop charater, in line with cascade hops. Flavor is initially malty sweet with a small citrus hop flavor in the finish. I would prefer more hop flavor in the beer especially for a west coast pale. Body is pretty medium not to heavy not to light. Overall a pretty average pale, nothing really that special that makes it stick out."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lingers of floral, hoppy, & citrus. Mildly bitter, with a thin, dry finish."
"D - Overall this is a very nice session beer. I will chalk up the dull flat feeling to a bad bottle for now. This is more then likely awesome on tap and would love to try it in that regard."
"M/D - The hops are subtle enough to where this is very enjoyable and not overly dry or hoppy. The carbonation is very smooth as well. I love the balance of hops, fruit, and malt, and every sip reminds me of why this is one of my favorite Pale Ales. Some PA's can get tiring after a pint or two, but this one keeps you intrigued. I wish Deschutes would distribute back East, but I understand why they stay on the West Coast right now."
"It tastes good -- the citrus-pine northwest hops match that pale bready malt -- but not the West Coast hophead bonanaza I was expecting. Decent body with a crisp finish makes it go down easy, and I could see having another one on a thirsty afternoon. And then another one. As it is, I've tried nine beers today and I'm ready for bed."
"A good beer, definately better than expected. For the style the appearance was a bit weak. It looked more like fizzy pop (a pet peeve of mine) than beer. But all in all, pretty solid, could have used a bit more hops, and the mouthfeel was a bit too watery."
"D - A very good tasting, hop accented pale with a subtle effervescence. Nice lingering sweetness in the finish while tinges of grapefruit accent this easy drinking american pale."
"I acquired this bottle from The Bier Stein, Eugene, OR. It poured out a dark golden amber color with a thin, bubbly head that disappears fairly quickly. It has a clouded appearance and some lacing, but not much. It smells of floral hops, but it doesn't have a strong aroma overall. It's a little disappointing in the taste because not much of the smell-complexity comes through and it's mainly a taste of bitter hops-aftertaste that dominates it."
"D: I'd gladly drink down a few of these. This is a nice sessioning APA, strong on hops without ramping up the alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery. Very active carbonation. Lightly dry, bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable."
"Aggressive pour froma 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Nice orange color with a finger's width white head. Decent lacing. Aroma was a mild citrus. Taste was mildly bitter finishing sweet. Very accesible and enjoyable pale that went down very easily, I had no problem having a second."
"This is a highly drinkable pale ale. It had a fairly robust taste of cascade hops and just sweet enough to taste the way I prefer my pale ales, it was refreshing and easy drinking."
"A very enjoyable and accessable pale ale; this has elements that would appeal to both those who love hops, and those who aren't quite as keen on them. A nice balance of flavors and a beer that I'll most likely get again."
"Drinkability: 4.5"
"Drinkability is very good. Plenty of flavor, but it still goes down very well, leaving me wanting another."
"Copper in color with a slight white head. Slight smells of hops and flowery notes. The first taste has a slight bite of hops, but not a strong flavor. The second taste is sweet and tart. I guess the word for this brew is slight. A decent and drinkable beer that may be the start of introducing a macro drinker to the world of micros. Personally I would probably migrate to the other offering from Deschutes, the Black Butte Porter, a winter FC favorite..."
"A well made, easy drinker."
"D- Pretty drinkable, would be good fresh"
"Cant say enough about the hoppiness  for an APA, this one packs a nice little punch. Finish is not as dry as an IPA, but all in all a nice composition, and definitely drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is good with probably the finest attribute of this beer. Overall somewhat drinkable but not my favorite pale ale."
"This is an excellent session worthy APA. Maybe a notch below Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but it's close... and at times I do prefer this one."
"This is one of the best American Pale Ales on the market. If you see this in your local liquor store, pick it up. If you are a fan of American Pale Ales, you need to get your hands on this. Unfortunately Deschuttes is so small that they do not distribute much beyond Oregon, California, and Washington."
"D - Mmm. It's so nice, I think I'll have another."
"D - I could drink this one all night. Great example of an APA without making me feel like I am drinking a mini IPA like so many other pales resemble."
"Nice bite to it. Crisp and refreshing."
"Drinkability: A true brew for all seasons. She provides the refreshment one would require while mowing something or BBQing something delicious, yet at the same time substantive enough for the colder months. It would be a tall order to find a better session beer."
"Adam"
"Easy to drink. Easily sessionable. Good solid beer, not great."
"The label talks about a generous helping of cascade hops but I think this beer lacks a bit. Not much of an aroma upon pouring and there seems to be a very subtle sweetness that distracts from what hoppiness there is. Kicks up a frothy head that makes you think there might be something to this beer but in the end it doesn't deliver."
"Very drinkable. I was very happy to see this one at Vons Pavillions. I will definately revisit this one again and again."
"Oddly, I'm rating this bottled version higher than the on-tap! I think it's because the on-tap head had faded before it was served, and the mouthfeel was just a bit flat as well-- probably due to the location's stock or equipment (Matt's, Redmond WA)."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good steady carbonation. Smooth and easy going like a good pale ale should be. I could easily see myself grabbing a sixer of this for a get together. Easily drinkable and overall a solid pale ale with plenty of hop character. I hope to have a chance to try more brews from Deschutes, thanks to kmpitz2 for this one."
"This is one of my favorite beers out there right now. I poured this beer into a pint glass and let it warm up from fridge temp. It has a color that is between golden and copper, with a nice head that lasts throughout the glass. There is a gentle sweetness through the sip that finishes with a citrusy bitterness on the back of the tongue. I prefer a smell that has a little more grapefruit attached to it, however. I enjoy how the beer rolls around in the mouth with just the right amount of carbonation."
"The drinkability of this is quite good. It's a pretty good pale ale, so you will be satisfied, although you may get bored of this one later on, and want something a little more interesting."
"D: A good example of a Pale Ale. Not the best I've ever had, but one I would get again."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is very crisp and clean tasting. The flavors are well represented but do not blow me away. The beer is well balanced. This beer is very easy to drink and I could envision sessioning this pale ale."
"The beer poured an amber copper color with a light head that settled into a medium lacing. The beer had a sweet malted hops smell that was not too over powering. The taste was a nice blend of malts and hops with a fairly clean finish. The beer feels smooth and crisp with a light carbonation. Over all a nicely drinkable beer. It has a summery quality that makes it a great beer for a warm afternoon bar-b-que."
"Cheer's to Deschutes for a fine Pale Ale!"
"Overall: Somehow my late night trip to Vons to pick up some Light bulbs had me pondering the limited beer range for something new and this one just leapt out at me. The six-pack was a little more money than the other regular boring selection, but I think it a creditable purchase and one that I did not regret.maybe Ill crack a fourth bottle."
"A winner in any season."
"The taste is intially quite hoppy with a bit of grapefruit and grass but the malt moves in quickly giving it a nice balance and a fairly sweetish finish. Over all, this is one of the smoothest and easy to drink APAs I've had."
"A lot of people, including myself on occasion, knock APA's, but this one is addictively good."
"Drinkability: This was a staple on-tap selection at most restaurants we frequented and I can see why. Pleasant and enjoyable in a simple way. Nice and worth having several of."
"Enjoyed Mirror Pond Pale at Brick Oven Pizza in Crested Butte, CO. After a long day of hiking we found this establishment while walking down the main street in town. On a hot summer day this pale ale had all the attributes I needed to wash down the thin crust pizza I was eating. The beer has an outstanding pleasant aroma with a crisp not overwhelming taste. Its slight dry mouthfeel was complimented with a suttle hop flavor. The Deschutes Brewery puts out some great products, I only wish the Pale Ale draught was available in more locations in Colorado."
"D: A crisp, enjoyable beer; quite drinkable - especially on a hot summer day."
"12 oz bottle. Pours an orange-hued testaceous color with a light, but incomplete, film of head over top. The brew is slightly cloudy with just a few stray bubbles making their way to the surface. Taking a smell, I get moderate caramel sweetness, with even a touch of honey. This is backed by sweet orange and lighter grapefruit citrusy hop, even a light kick of peppery hop as well. I like how the sweetness of the malt is a little subdued and lets the juicy-smelling hops shine through. This one has good balance. The first sip brings caramel and grapefruity sweet hop. This moves to a more full caramel after swallowing, with a very nice moderate hoppy bitter that clings on the finish, but not harsh and offensive. The aftertaste is very orangey citrusy to me as well, leaving a nice dichotomy between the bitterness and the sweetness playing on my tongue. Mouthfeel is moderate with a light-moderate carbonation. It is not light, but definately nowhere near being a heavy beer, and I think it hits the mouthfeel very well for the flavors. I think this is a very solid example of an APA. The hop and malt flavors and aroma are in synch with each other, and its something I could make a nice session out of, so this one is a keeper in my book."
"Light orange, with head of foam that evaporates slowly. Significant lace left in glass. C-hop grapefuit aroma and malt. Soft on the palate, but an aftertaste of tongue tingle from carbonation. Medium grapefruit and orange flavours, with bitter and a tad metallic finish never mind it. Refreshing though drying. Give me another, this hot summer night."
"forget all the details. all you need to know is this is THE pale ale of our time. its a lovely deep sunset, its smells like fresh citrus hops and it tastes even better. hops are the big picture with a delicious malt backdrop. a slight mineral aftertaste lingers along with your thoughts of how resfreshing and crisp that beer you just drank was. such a solid offering, i love this."
"Pours a golden copper with a fantastic off-white head, lingering for the duration of the glass, with pretty decent lacing at top. Aroma is nicely hopped, obvious citric fruits, not a 'wow' but leading to... A really good tasting beer. Up front... it falls short toward the end, which was pretty disappointing after the first mouthful. Actually, I'm finding the larger the sip, the better/longer the aftertaste. Duh. Anywho, good hop attack up front, malts playing nice in the background, giving way to esters and citric bite thats not really a bite, but a hold, that lets go and eases into a finishing hop oil that isn't too outward, but still nice. A medium body full of carbonation up front and smoothing out nicely at end. Overall, quite a fine beer, one I'll be glad to take home."
"Dark amber with 1/2 inch head. Little detectable aroma. Taste was well balanced with malt & hops. Mouthfeel was very smooth, felt like it could have used a little more carbonation. A very easy drinking and enjoyable beer which was better than the sum of it's parts."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, it's so tempting to drink as a session brew but at 5.50% it has caught up with me rather fast in the past, actually. It also is so flavorful that it has a tendency to saturate my taste buds and become bothersome after too many! One of the best beers to have one or three with a good meal or just on it's on."
"D- this feels like a good anytime beer. no doubt a good pale ale, i'll be enjoying this again in the future"
"Overall impression: Very drinkable and balanced. Yet another quality offering from Deschutes."
"Whenever I'm drinking a Pale Ale (especially a ""West Coast"" PA) it's hard not to compare it to the gold standard - SNPA. Not only does Mirror Pond compare to Sierra Nevada very favorably but in some ways like the malt note it may even be superior. The hopping may be a bit lighter than SNPA but this is a first rate example of the style."
"Very easy drinker. Hops aren't as out front as I prefer and not nearly as much as the aroma would lead you to believe. However this beer is very well balanced, clean, sharp, and refreshing."
"Wonderfully balanced, light, sessionable summer beer"
"Dark Orange. Subtle hop aroma of grapefruits, tang and oranges. Very approachable, juicy, fruity and well balanced hop profile in the mouth with notes of grapefruit, orange and other citrus fruits. The meek malt presence serves its purpose and balances well. Very creamy and quite good."
"Notes: As it warmed breadiness comes through with some balls. This is one easy drinker and kept my interest throughout. Worthy effort."
"Another excellent and very drinkable beer from the folks at Deschutes Brewery. I can see this becoming a regular session brew for me."
"D: Overall not a bad pale ale. I have had mirror pond many times before and I remember it smelling and tasting much better than this bottle, perhaps I'll have to get another sometime and compare my rating."
"Pours a hazy-ish clear medium amber color with a decent head.Nice lacing for an APA. Smell is of melons and berries. Malt dominates with a little hop. Taste is nice with much of the same characeristics as the smell. Very clean with a lot of flavor. Not as hoppy as most APAs, but that doesn't distract from the flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for my liking, but not bad overall. Drinkablity is great. Not offensive at all and could easily go down one after another."
"The taste is lighter than I expected, but I'm a hop addict so I am slightly biased. It finishes refreshing and extremely drinkable. could be the easiest session pale ale I have ever had. Not strong on the hops, but delightfully balanced."
"Overall: When I first started drinking beer I tried a couple of Pale Ales and decided to avoid the style because the hops were too bitter. Mirror Pond avoids the over the tops hops for a more balanced approach which I liked a lot. Next time I am buying beer I might not avoid pale ales."
"I liked this beer, but I think its a little bitter for my taste. I wouldnt want to drink much of it, but its a nice occasional change of pace."
"Easy drinking PA that goes down great. Not as good as the draft version and the one time was luck enough have this on cask, wow! But this works if you are looking for a PA that won't blow your lips off and still excite the hophead inside you."
"Very well executed and highly enjoyable. One of the better APA's I've tried.This would be a regular staple in my fridge if it were available locally."
"Very pleasant Amer. Pale Ale. Smell is faint, but has hints of bubble gum and light citrus. Taste is unexpected, with a very strong grapefruit-like note coming all the way through. Body is substantial until about two-thirds of the way through it, then it effervesces into very little. Finish is sweet, with a light malt left on the tongue for a few seconds. This leaves a pleasant mouth feel which warrants another sip!"
"Slàinte!"
"Drinkability  For my money, this is the most drinkable American Pale Ale Ive tasted. I am continually amazed by its balance and how frequently Im in the mood for this very beer."
" I wouldn't go out of your way for it. like i said it's a solid fallback"
"Man, do I love this Pale Ale. As excited as I was to see that this one would be a part of the tasting clinic I was volunteering with at the World Beer Festival, I was more excited to see two or three bottles left over afterwards. After the final tasting was done, I got to enjoy this one with some great people I just met. Real balance of malts and hops, nothing to bitter, almost perfect in my book. Too bad I cannot find this one close by . . . yet."
"Had the privelage of sampling this beer many times yesterday at the WBF,poured a slightly hazy deep orange with a clingy white head on top.To be expected this Oregon produced pale ale's aromas are hop dominated wich is a good thing fruity citrus with underlying pine very fresh smelling.This goes down very easily and would be a staple of mine if I could get it here,flavors are pretty nicely balanced there is a firm dry maltiness up front finishing with the big dose of cascades in the finish citrus and pine linger nicely.Deschutes makes some damn fine brews I wish I could get them more locally instead offline."
"It poured a nice light copper color with a fat two inch head. The floral scents were impressive. Not as hoppy as I would have liked it up front, but extremely drinklable. loral hints throughout and extremely smooth. A tremendous choice for a session beer. Could probably drink a six pack with ease."
"I'm looking forward to trying more selections from Deschutes."
"A nice hazy orange-red with a white head that falls fast. Looks good but it does not smell like much. In fact, the piney boquet is light that it takes some doing to detect. But things pick up when it comes to the third sense - taste, which is well balanced, allowing the nutty malt flavors to come out without being sweet. The touch is also nice; it feels good in the mouth. It is slightly parching but only enough to make you want to drink another."
"I really like this beer's appearance in my regular pint glass. It pours an amber-orange color, with a pale, white head, a bit lacking in thickness. Bubbles are visible slowly rising throughout the glass. It has a nice crisp and hoppy aroma. Floral scents help to give its hop smell a very well balanced appeal. The taste at first is a bit disappointing and thin. But as the beer warms, its citrus flavors become more apparent. In addition the presence of a hoppy kick at the end, added to a slight bitter bite, help to complete its flavor. In the mouth, this beer has a lot of carbonation. It is not very full, but its flavor does linger for quite a time on the palate. Overall, this is a good Pale Ale. It is not overdone at all and, hence, very drinkable. Balance is the key to its success. I would say that on those occasions when a moderately-hopped up and tasty pale is desired M.P.P.A. would hit the spot."
"This brew could pretty much be the reference for perfect drinkability; tasty and mild without beating any of your senses into submission. I could drink this everyday and be very happy for the rest of my life. I give this brew the highest possible recommendation!"
"Appearance is a cloudy golden with some white lace and some lacing. Aroma contains floral hops and banana esters along with nicely balanced hops and malt. Initial taste is of sweet crackers and malt, citrusy/fruity bitter hops and somewhat dry. Finish has a dry even feel that goes well with food."
"Darker than some and better balanced than many, this is a classic PNW pale ale that really hits the spot. Reasonable hop nose is followed by a real nice balanced body that is drinkable to the core. I think that this is the closest the PNW comes to SNPA."
"Dated 09/02/05. Poured a slight hazy golden color with some nice lacing. Has a very nice taste not bitter at all compared to other Pale Ale's I've had in the past. Very nice body on the light side. Very light compared to other Pale Ale's, very drinkable. I could get use to drinking alot of these (for me 3-4). I really like the taste. A very socialble brew."
"A good summer quaffer."
"Drinkability- I'll have to try a bottled version of this and re-rate in the future. May get a better rating. From what I tasted, I enjoyed though."
"This Pale Ale has a nice zesty bite to it. The grapefruit flavour isn't as strong as it is in the Cinder Cone Red Ale. Here it is more of a highlight rather than dominant feature. I think this would be well enjoyed by both Lager drinkers as well as hopheads. I wish I had more than just one to sample."
"Slightly hazy appearance and a pleasant, light hoppy aroma. The flavor is very smooth with mild hops and a bit of citrus. It goes down easy, with a manageable amount of carbonation - I could drink a lot of this beer. A good bang-for-the-buck that doesn't overpower food and even non-beer-drinkers won't find offensive, it's handy to keep some around."
"atop the Cascades."
"Another nice offering from Deschute's."
"This was rather hoppy for a pale ale (immediately I was glad there was no IPA!) and boasted the usual creamy, raisin flavoured Deschutes backing. They certainly weren't being stingy with the malt here. This was a well coordinated and very drinkable beer with a reasonable feel (lots of small bubbles). Perhaps I should drink more pale ale rather than IPA, but more likely I should drink more Deschutes beer. I find Deschutes to be the most dependable brewery (never a bad beer). Good stuff!"
"I did notice the higher alcohol content in this one, though, as it kicked in on me soon into my second beer."
"Pouring with a nice lasting head, Mirror Pond is the definitive pale ale. Starts off slightly sour and finishes with the bitterness you expect from a pale ale. In the background I taste some hints of wood. This style of beer has never been my favorite but Mirror Pond is definately an easy drinker, good for just about any occasion."
"My fiance acted as air courier to bring me a sixer back from her trip to Spokane. I am even further indebted to this lovely lady. Pours a slightly cloudy golden/orange hue with a smallish gleaming white head. Lovely aroma of fresh, floral hops, some sweet malt, and notes of pine and astringency. Palate begins with light sweet malt, then the hops kick in. Nice, rich floral hops coat the tongue, with a pleasantly bitter hoppy aftertaste. Body is full and slightly creamy, almost perfect. If I had to pick one session beer for life, this would definitely be it (although maybe it would be from the beer engine at the Horse Brass)."
"Tried on tap in downtown Portland at a very busy pub. For a pale ale it looked darker than I thought it would, looked almost amber. A very nice citrus aroma but the malt backbone of this beer seems to be too much as the beer had some sweetness that I wouldn't expect. Very little head retention with some large surface bubbles during the first few sips. Gonna have to give this another try someday to see if I just had a bad pint."
"I'd love to sample this with some sharp cheddar."
"Goes down so smooth and at 5% ABV, it would make a very nice session brew."
"The mouthfeel is interestingly soft and foamy, which I liked, especially from an American pale ale, but I think in the end it lent it a somewhat watery feel and decided that I'd like it a bit firmer."
"The taste as I was affraid was much like the smell. Seemed rather bland. There was a slight sweetness to it but not much else. A bit dissapointed since Im a big fan of many of their other beers."
"Mirror Pond is a decent all around pale ale that's best found in a bottle. The draught version served by Deschutes has a plump mouthfeel and a companionable flavor but otherwise stirs little excitement."
"This beer pours a nice dark golden color. It has a white head that leaves a pretty good amount of lacing. It has a nice hoppy, floral, aroma. Slightly citrusy. Taste is of malt and a small amount of citrus. Mild hop bitterness on back of tongue. Good mouthfeel. Perfect amount of carbonation. My friend sent me a few of these from out west. I wish this was sold around here in MI. This would definately be in my fridge on a regular basis. I guess I don't need to recommend it to anybody on the west coast. I'm sure your probably drinking one right now. Try it if you've never had."
"Poured a rich deep gold almost amber ale with a thick slightly tan head that subsided slowly. The aroma is of fresh floral hops with distinct fruity esters mixed in. The taste is bittersweet on the initial taste with a clean cascade hop flavor supported by a sweet carmel malt but the initial impression is on hop flavor not bitterness. The absence of high alpha hop roughness gives credibility to the pale aleness of Mirror Pond as the hops are deliciously there but not to the point of being an IPA. The mouthfeel as with other Deschutes brews is great when concerning the carbnonation and carbonic bite but in terms of body i belive this is lacking but not of making this beer poor. Very drinkable but i like the black butte or quial springs for a session beer instead of htis one as the hops could become less distinct after the first pint."
"Good ol' Mirror Pond -- it's available literally EVERYWHERE in Portland. Every bar, every grocery store, every 7-11 and Plaid Pantry... luckily, it's a good beer and deserving of its popularity. It, along with Sierra Nevada, may be the premier American-style pale ale, or at least the West Coast version. It's full of malt, full of hops, well balanced and drinkable, but manages to pack a slight punch. The mouthfeel is smooth and filling. I don't know if the beer is bottle-conditioned but it feels like it. Pours a tawny orange with great head and lace; hops dominate the flavor with fruit flavors that marry well with the sweet malts. Despite the bitterness, the finish is on the sweet side, and soft fruit flavors linger, such as peach or mango. It is an everyday brew, although for an ordinary beer it is lucky that we have one as tasty as this. Many cities have to make do with Bud or Coors. It may be a drawback to some that it absolutely must be poured into a glass; it just doesn't work from the bottle. A beer not to be overlooked."
"This was another beer I really wanted to try while in Denver. We dont get Deshutes in Boston (that I know of, so I jumped at the tap when I saw it. The bear poured a bright copper, with a thick full white head. A nice lace stayed for the entire beer. It had a bright citrus aroma from the hops. More hop character than I expected. The taste was light and fruity, from the hops, not the yeast, with a light floral middle. It had a light mouth feel and a great drinkability. Nice candidate for a session beer."
"12 oz. bottle pours a amber hued liquid with a decent head that quickly fades to a sheen. Has a very slight sweet caramel smell with a whiff of hops. Has a medium body, with a taste of caramel sweetness followed by smidgin of floral hop bitterness to finish. A very easy drinking, smooth beer - maybe too smooth."
"Mirror Pond Pale Ale is a highly drinkable brew that's perfect for enjoyment while camped out in front of the TV watching football (college or pro). Another great beer by Deschutes, one of the most underrated breweries in the U.S."
"A bottle brought to our Brewers of South the Suburbs meeting. Light in color, with a thin head. I didn't find it to be as hoppy as other people have described it. Just a nice, clean smell and taste that goes down well, and another brewer I hope to sample further in the future."
"Men's Journal recently stated that Mirror Pond Pale Ale is America's Best Beer. Hardly, but it is a fine, drinkable example of the American Pale Ale style. Most everyone should enjoy this fine ale from one of the Pacific Northwest's best breweries. I know that I do."
"Drinkability  This went down well enough."
"This should become a blueprint for all other pale ales. Pours an amber orange with a semi white/tan head that grows to great proportions then fades to about an inch. The smell is of strong floral and citrus, hints of hops characteristics, very clean and refreshing. The taste is a nice balance of the sweetness of the floral/orange citrus and the bitter tangy lemon hops. Some pine notes detected as well, very light and refreshing. Goes down about as good as a beer can, great for those thirst quenching moments. This is now become my staple in the fridge. Sorry SNPA for there is a new pale ale king."
"Clear orange-amber, bright white 1cm foam. Light fresh orange zest fragrance with caramelic malt underneath. Hop profile is grassy. Honey and earth notes. Taste is fresh with earthy oranges peaks, peaches-like malt and what I found to be mostly grassy in the aroma here appears mostly floral and minty. Very quaffable straightforward verison of the style. Definitely doesnt have the complexity or stand-out characteristics to be worth seeking, but pleasant enough to try if you have the chance. Great creamy mouthfeel, airy and foamy medium body. Thanks to skyhand for the bottle!"
"Chill hazen dark yellow with a slight bronzed tone to its body, thin dense white foamy top reached a finger high before fading quickly down to whispy fringe and thin collar, lacing in spots and tiny strings. Aroma is of Cascade hops moslty, grassy and floral, yet sweet with some fruity notions of malts inbetween. Taste intially hoppy with slight citrus and grass, fades off to a sweet middle of bready thick malts then dries out to a lingering bittersweet hoppiness that keeps a touch of zing on the tongue. Good finish with lingering hop spice and resin oils sticking well but light and nonabrasive. Feel is close to a medium body, albiet somewhat on the lighter side, still has some creamy, slick and quiet carbonation, and a dry, slightly spicey hop finish. Very drinkable, very soothing, a bit on the malty side, but the hops partake a good balance in its finish to make up for it."
"Easy drinking beer with a very soft feel in the mouth."
"Clear amber with a thick off-white frothy head. Aroma is pretty uneventful, though there is subtle evidence of some legitimate hopping going on here. For a pale ale, this has much more of a roasted malt base than I anticipated & I like it. Hop profile is piney & citrusy - just like with the aroma though, it seems subdued a bit, but does linger. Mouthfeel is medium to thin & a dry finish makes this highly, highly drinkable. Solid. Thanks to skyhand for the chance to try this one."
"I purposely paired it with my penne and andouille in a pancetta and smoked gouda sauce (recipe doesn't have beer, so you can't have it). Perfect! It doesn't overwhelm any part of the sauce, yet it can stand up to the andouille and smoke and cut right through the dairy."
"The flavor is snappy and comes with a good solid amount of hops. The mouthfeel is a little sharp but it is still very drinkable."
"Zum wohl!"
"It's simple, poorly balanced and quite thin, but the excellent hop flavor and mild carbonation redeem it nicely. Works for me."
"The smell is the best part of this one, and is hoppy and tart through and through. A warm, sweet alcoholic maltiness insinuates itself at the close. Taste is top notch as well, and is wonderfully refreshing. Crisp fruit notes are present here, as well as huge hops that suggest juniper and citrus. Mouthfeel is good and slightly oily. The carbonation adds to the complexity but does not get in the way. Drinkability is supreme. Quickly becoming a classic."
"This is a nice pale ale that wasn't terribly special, but certainly not offensive. Certainly it's eminently drinkable, and not bad if you can get it on sale. Otherwise, don't strain anything to get a hold of it."
"Nice clear amber with orange tones, small frothy off-white head -- very little carbonation. The Cascade hops are evident in the aroma and the flavor, with a tingly bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy, which makes the brew 'feel' sweet even though it isn't sweet at all. Very drinkable -- a nice pale ale."
"Drinkability: My first real love of west coast beers. Thanks to Dave for making me try this one. Well done, but wish I had a fresher bottle."
"Good foam to the head when poured into your glass. The aroma promises a nice hoppy spiceyness. The tastey hop strength in the flavor might be more than some people would expect from a pale ale. But is just what I would expect from a west coast beer. A tasty easy drinking pale ale with a good hop precence."
"I really liked this beer and hope to score more of it somehow here on the east coast. I've been told its better on tap and on the west where its fresh."
"A translucent amber on the pour with a modest and creamy head that is light tan in color, the left over lace forms a fine concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is rich in malt, crisp and clean, maybe even a tad lemon like sweet start with a moderate feel to the palate. Finish benignly acidic, the hops pleasant and welcoming in their spiciness, dry and long lasting aftertaste, a damn good session beer."
"Light copper body with a sticky off-white head. Surprisingly aromatic; big fruity malts, and lots of resiny hops. Taste... the malt presence is a little more subdued than the smell led me to believe. It's a bit toffeeish, but this is walloped by a large dose of PacNW hops. A little unbalanced I believe. Finish is dry, appetizingly bitter, with lingering apple cider notes."
"This beer is a wonderful copper color, quite clear as well. Pours with a cream colored head. The aroma has hints of lychee and grapefruit, definitely an American hop signature here. Quite malty tasting with a nice hop flavor that hits the tongue up front. This beer finishes with a slight bitterness. It seemed to be missing the American hop punch that the aroma promised, other than this quite an enjoyable beer."
"Theres a fine line between some Pale Ales and IPAs, and this is certainly the case with Mirror Pond. I tried this brew 6 years ago and it's the same today as it was then. Amber/copper in color, fast fading white head and some patches of sticky lace. A good floral hop aroma dominates a faintly sweet malty smell. There's a fair amount of malty body in this brew. A lemony citrus and lightly spicy hop bitterness possess quite a potent tangy bite. It mellows out and becomes more balanced at around the halfway point. Nice bottle! Thanks to Genaro for bringing this back from his trip to Oregon!"
"Mint bubble gum and cream aromas rise up reluctantly from the orange/brown liquid. Grapefruit, alcohol and crushed seeds appear in the flavor. A leaner malt profile here, barely able to support the bitter, grapefruit-skin hop notes. Perhaps not the result of an obsession with quality, but the thing does drink. A little more roast, some funkier yeast, and you have Bell's. For fans of the craft Pale scene, maybe a clever little brew. For me, I can live without it."
"Deep golden color, with a moderate soft white head. Aroma is malty with a brisk blast of Pacific Northwest citrusy hops. Refreshing and tasty, the malt body is clean tasting with a slight nutty flavor rounded out with a nice finishing hop bitterness. A very enjoyable pale ale."
"Dark gold color, medium head. Aroma is malty and fruity. Malts are nutty and sweetish. Hops are grapefruity. Heavily hopped, roasted malts. Nice smooth malt flavor. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Malt flavor dominate this brew. A nice bottle conditioned pale ale."
"Had this nice little brew while in Portland recently. Pretty average in appearance and smell as this may have been on tap too long. However the taste was extremely good, something I am starting to expect from Deschutes Brewery. Had a good mouthfeel to it, good play between the malts and hops. This is another extrely drinkable beer from this brewery, makes me want to abandon the desert as I do not think this is available in Arizona!"
"Overall Impression: On par with their Black Butte Porter, this is one of my favorites that I've tried. Delicious. No complaints at all about this one! In fact, I really like this beer a whole hell of a lot!"
"A very nice pale ale."
"Overall a very good APA. Too bad this and Full Sail Pale Ale aren't available here. They're 2 great Pacific NW APA's."
"Originally sampled on 21 August 2002. Had this at Deschutes' brewpub while in Bend, OR. It's hoppy w/ a nice nose. The pour is a cloudy amber color. It finishes fairly well balanced. This is a pretty good American Pale Ale. I would definitely have this one again."
"This one pours a cloudy amber color. A bit of a head, but it did stay around for a little while. Fairly decent aroma of hops to the nose. Flavor is well balanced, with a fairly decent hop bite at the end. It gets high points for being crisp and clean. Not spectacular, but a decent Pale Ale."
"I love this beer. The flavor starts calm, slightly hoppy, however once swallowed, the tongue gets the true delight. The ""copious"" amounts of hops linger well after drank, and leave you thirsty for another gulp. My favorite part? Could be the fact this beer goes unfiltered, so a generous amount of yeast builds to the bottom, convincing you to finish each and every one opened to get that blessed B-12 rich hangover antidote. Highly recommended."
"The beer pairs well with asian foods, and with trivial pursuit, or whatever it is you do in the evenings with your drinking buddies. Another good Oregon beer."
"Very drinkable a good session brew for those that like to tatse hops hops hops"
"Nice Pale Ale. Tap is a lot better than bottle. The 6-pack I bought tasted a lot more hoppy than I memember the draught was like at a local restaurant. I didn't like the hoppy cascade flavor, not when it says Pale Ale on the label. But, still enjoy it."
"(P.S., Seven years later, I'm a little embarrassed with this review. Now that it's becoming prevalent in my hometown market, I intend to review a freshly tapped pint someday soon.)"
"Due to the mildness I consider this is more of a ladies beer--my girlfriend really likes it. However it is not so bland that I couldn't knock down a few of these and enjoy it."
"Pours pale orange amber with small quickly fading head. THe aroma is mostly hops, although not powerful. A bit citrusy, a bit floral. The flavor flip-flops being mostly malt. Ver bread-doughy, like multigrain bread. The finish is dry and short. The palate is soft. The beer is a bit thin in flavor for my tastes, but it isn""t bad."
"This fine offering from Deschutes in Oregon poured a nice deep amber.  Lace was wispy from a decent head.  I liked the hoppy aroma and while I expected a more prominent hop finish I wasn't let down.  This beer was very smooth, refreshing, and drinkable.  The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side otherwise I say go for it."
"Nice golden, somewhat cloudy amber color. Head leaves something to be desired though. No head also means no artistic lace on the glass. The only good part of that is that it'll be easier to clean the glass if I forget to rinse it out. Good flavor that is both malty and hoppy, but not too extreme either way. Good beer, in my opinon, but I think the cheesy hop embossing job on the bottle needs to go."
"Mirror Pone Pale Ale is Dischutes best beer. Not to malty and grainy, but has just the right amount of bitterness to bring everything together. The flavor seem to get more complex as it got warmer in the glass."
"I think one of the best American pales out there.  Many breweries stay ligth on the malt to bring out more hop flavor, but Mirror Pond has a great malty character to balance out the wonderful flavor of the Cascade hops.  Love this stuff."
"Heavily hopped...noticable on the nose and the buds...good fruity hop notes...citrucy...bittering units are much higher on this one than their other pale ale I would assume.  Nice frothy creamy head that settles nicely...cloudy gold in color....tastes like it was dry-hopped....a spicy, fruity ale without enough malt backbone..decent and more adventurous and flavorfull than their other pale ale (Cascade Ale), but not as balanced.  I prefer the other one (Cascade Ale) even though it lacks this flavor because I see this as a little unbalanced..."
"A very good APA.  Overall well rounded flavor,  Nothing outstanding it's ground.  However, nothing particularly special about it either.  What else can I say, but you are about to drink a very good APA?"
"This is a GREAT americal Plae ale. I think Elk Baiter mistakenly pickdt up a bottle of nail polish instead of Mirror Pond. There is no way this stuff and be considered dry or bitter. It has a lovely rounded maltyness if anything a small tiny touch of sweetness. With a understated bitterness and only a small hop flavor.  If you find it you must try it, it is just good beer."
