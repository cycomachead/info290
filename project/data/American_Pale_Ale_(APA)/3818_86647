More times then not I'm drinking this beer fresh, so my review might be bias. Great APA, with citrus notes of grapefruit and apricot taking over the aroma as well as the taste of the beer. Mildly hoppy. Reminds me of Founders All Day IPA in taste. Once in awhile I will notice inconsistency in the taste of the beer from batch to batch, but this is a great summertime beer, one I usually have on tap, and one I've been enjoying since I had STBCs trial run of this stuff a few years back.","716gibbs","Jan 24, 2015"

Some of the Southern Tier six-pack offerings have been hit or miss in my experience but it has been quite some time since I've consumed them. The bright, fruity hops are matched very well by the bready malts in the finish. The live yeast seems to give the body a nice boost which helps the flavors truly shine.","cbutova","Nov 25, 2014"

3.9,0.3,4,4,3.75,4,4,"Review from 4/2/14, on tap at Tribeca Tap House, NYC. Pours clear yellow gold color with a huge foamy 2 finger white head that was full of small bubbles and faded very slowly, leaving good lacing as it dissipated. Smells of lemon zest, citrus, malt, spring-like hoppy notes, grains and light caramel; nice balance and appropriate for the style. Tastes like it smells but with more citrus and piney hop notes to go along with the lemon zest, malt, herbs, grass, light bready grains and caramel; very has nice balance with a little malt sweetness that makes it very easy drinking. I drank 2 of these quickly as they felt nice and light with average to mild carbonation, a medium body and very good drinkability. Aftertaste was clean and near crisp, this was a definite session beer and one I’d like to try from a bottle. A solid brew.","CHickman","Apr 02, 2014"

3.71,-4.6,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75," The taste is good with slight pine tinge from the hops with light citrus and slight astringent flavor like overbrewed tea with a mild malt flavor which adds sweetness to balance the slight bitter aspect. The taste of malt is pretty well interwoven with the hops and yeast as a pale should be. Overall this is a nicely flavored pale, not very complex or intense but it is good for the style","Slatetank","Mar 30, 2014"

I would have to agree with ST and say it was a light copper, almost golden or blonde. Very clear, slightly carbonated, not undercarb'd. A fair bit of sediment settled in the glass. ST says there is a hop dominated flavor, which I don't get. The taste feels very balanced to me for a Pale Ale, the finish is where I get the most hop bitterness. It's slightly sweet, but very well rounded with the malts and hops. A lot of citrus and pine, slightly fruity. Mouthfeel is light, and with a 5.5 ABV very much drinkable and feels session worthy.","JCarey","Jan 21, 2014"

4.1,5.4,4.25,4.25,4,3.75,4.25,"O: A very raw and powerful hop-centric pale ale that uses Citra quite obviously as its focal point. A little bit of rough yeast character adds to the raw feel of it too. More of a 'Shock and Awe' approach from Southern Tier, as they normally make very clean and focused beers. It's punishing in a good way, if you're a hop head and you like that sort of thing. It draws some comparisons to Zombie Dust in the way it wields the citra hop. A great buy at its price point and availability, and the concert ticket marketing really works for it. Great concept, great execution.","ryan1788a5","Jan 09, 2014"

4.33,11.3,4.25,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"My oh-so-gentle pour so as not to disturb the lees produced only a skim of wispy, tawny head. Color was a deep golden-yellow (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity and I was uninterested in playing referee to Midas, Croesus and Mammon, all who wanted some. Nose was predominantly grapefruit, but I felt like I smelled pineapple in there also. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste, while citrusy, was not as pronounced as it would be in an AIPA. I really felt like I was tasting pineapple on the finish, but I may have convinced myself of that on the nose. I will not feel slighted if you disagree with me on that. This was a very mellow beer, especially at the end of the day when I am contemplating an early rack time. My last trick was to swirl the remaining beer in the bottle and pour the lees. Waste not, want not, I always say. Now, I swear that I tasted pineapple! Could the yeast be imparting that flavor? Good stuff.","woodychandler","Oct 07, 2013"

Lots of carbonation throughout the body. Aromas of resin and grassy hops, with lemon and grapefruit tart and sweet highlights. Some floral highlights on the nose as well. Flavors of tart citrus sharply hit the forward tongue, with a blast of resin and bitter on the midtongue. The palate is a bit out of balance. Light, effervesced body that comes off sharp in places. The aftertaste is very tart and slightly bitter, again out of balance. Also some earthy and barnyard notes into the aftertaste. Tangy sweetness lingers into the finish, which is light, very crisp, and clean.","GarthDanielson","Sep 14, 2013"

Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells mostly like citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) and pine hops, and some bready/wheat malt. It tastes like citrusy (grapefruit, citrus rind, mango) hops, pine hops, and bready malt. Taste doesn't seem to have as much kick as compared to the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and coating, and has good carbonation. It's easy enough to drink! Really wouldn't have had a problem getting a regular size growler of this.

Fruity and floral notes dominate throughout as opposed to the piney flavors of west coast hoppy ales. The live terminology refers to the active yeast in this unfiltered beer which give the beer a tart but not sour quality similar to belgian pale ales though it does not taste like a belgian yeast is used.

Aroma is citrus and mild pine all day with a bread biscuit malt character super fresh bottle it's almost like a Sierra Nevada clone with a bit more hop action. Flavors bitter waves of rolling hops intermingled with biscuit caramel malts a very clean malt profile no residual sugars left behind just super tasty stuff. The live concert theme goes very well with the overall presence that the beer offers due to the pure drinkability, it's the type of beer one could get away tailgating with only 5.5% abv great stuff. Hops are great enough bitterness to keep any hophead interested with enough balance to keep a newbie on board and not running away in fear. Mouthfeel is light to medium even carbonation flow very natural feel on the palate I'm a big fan of Southern Tier from the early days of great core session ales into their extreme path of bombers that have been hit or miss for some beergeeks.","WVbeergeek","May 28, 2013"

Hazy lighter amber pour, with a medium-sized, foamy, white head that receded to a thin layer, but never completely disappeared, and left some spotty lacing on the glass. Nice aroma crisp with fresh hops, pale malts and a bit of toastiness as well. More of the same in the taste, a good balance, fresh grassy and citrus hops, with a biscuity pale malt base. Simple and tasty. Light-medium body, easily drinkable, and worth revisiting.","Rifugium","May 17, 2013"

The taste is hoppy and clean, with the sharp citrus and a touch of pine cutting over grainy malts to a very clean finish. The mouthfeel is light and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is great. Overall, Live is a solid APA.

It's a fairly clean smelling beer. The taste follows the nose mostly. I get the citrus, though it's mostly orange as well as some lemon. I also get the light breadiness from the malt. There's some back end biterness that is fairly mild. It's a bit like some bitter orange on the back end. The body is fairly light with strong carbonation. The beer drinks very smoothly due to all the carbonation. This is a good beer.","acevenom","Apr 04, 2013"

I was extremely excited to see this at the store a few days ago and now, I'm extremely pissed. The bottle has a DOB of 2/25 too so it couldn't have gone off. I drank a whole 6er over the past few days before making this review to confirm that it was THIS bad, and unfortunately, it is. I sent out a few bombers to friends about a month or two ago and they said it was also very good, so again, I certainly hope this was just a badly-packaged 6er...","Beejis60","Mar 19, 2013"

This is an awesome beer for hop-heads and those looking for that special APA! It dances the APA style line very closely and does not go into the IPA style zone. Not to mention names, but this is a serious contender to a certain undead Pale Ale from the beer gods in Munster. It has that beer's, and others like it's spirit!

Taste takes the beer in a different direction. Tons of juicy lemon and grapefruit bitterness coats the mouth. A very slight sweetness appears at the back of the palate to balance things out a little. Very dry finish. Sort of a session IPA, which is awesome...this will be a new favorite of mine from ST. Can't wait to see this in 12 oz bottles in the next few weeks.","spark3148857","Jan 27, 2013"

I would take this over their regular IPA everyday for the rest of my existence. So much orange! A super-hoppy Pale Ale that is, to me, an India Pale Ale. Whatever it is, it tastes pretty delicious.","VelvetExtract","Jan 07, 2013"
4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5," a Duvel tulip. Nice copper color. Head is white and lite and leaves just a little lacing. Aroma is really nice, lots of Citra and cascade. Obviously lots of pine and citrus. Carbonation is right on, lots of it, which I like, seems to evenly distribute flavors. Mouth feel is dry, yeast did a great job, none of that unfermented sugary feel. Flavor is just what I was hoping for. Relatively light IPA in terms of gravity 5.5 abv. Great hop combination. If I could get this year round, it would be a top pick.","HawkD","Dec 23, 2012"
4.03,3.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall an interesting beer for sure. Nice hops that could come out a bit more, interesting malts that take a background flavor and leave the beer overall light and drinkable, but also could be a bit more maybe. And a unique yeast character that brings the beer to life alright, effervescent, nice carbonation, and a light almost earthy farmhouse flavor that's not quite there. A nice beer.","jlindros","Dec 23, 2012"
