"O: I like it. 3 Floyds has never let me down and this is no exception. Top notch APA."
""
"Overall very well rounded. I could pound a few of these down if it were available in a 6 pack (and I was in the three floyds distro!)"

"One of the best pale ales I have ever had."

"This is a good beer, but I feel like it's strangely similar to Yum Yum. Maybe it's the a certain type of hops the two share, or something. But I enjoyed Yum Yum, and I enjoyed this. This one had a bit of the same funky taste, which I didn't care for. Not sure what specific ingredient or brewing technique attributes to this, but if anyone knows what type of hops SSMF, Yum Yum, and Alpha King are made with, I'd be curious to know. While this is good, I'm not sure I could tell the difference between this and another 3F PA in a blind taste test."

"An exceptional APA. Fruity, but balanced and hoppy.  Well done, once again 3F!"

"Much more mellow than either ZD or Alpha King. I could drink the hell out of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is possibly the best beer that I have ever had. It pours nicely with a light orangeish color and a light head. The smell is citrus hops with a little pine. The taste is not as hoppy or overwhelming as other brews by 3 floyds like zombie dust. It's citrusy with a slight hop at first followed by a clean malt flavor. Don't be scared or turned away by the price tag, it is well worth it!"
""
""
"Overall another good FFF.  This ones strength is balance and feel."
"Pours a medium amber with a thick one inch head. Smell is a hop forward, nice citrus zest, and notes of tropical fruit. Very mellow start, nice mouthfeel, with sweeter tropical hop notes, nice malt ballance, with very little residing bitterness. A very easy going, well balanced Pale Ale."

"O - not quite as hop forward as Zombie Dust, but in the same tier of quality. Just another Damn great APA from FFF. It's absolutely ridiculous the way these guys do beer. Space Station Middle Finger is one I hope gets bottled every year. I'll buy it every time I see it. It's just another great brew from the guys who do them best."

"Overall, it is a very nice APA.  This would be good on a hot summer day/night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden hue in color with a firm white head that stays in hand for the first few sips. This is unmistakably a Three Floyds APA - has that often present blend of a smooth mouthfeel with medium body, good maltiness on the back end and a full hop flavor with tropical fruit on the nose. Excellent blend of bitterness with the fruitiness of the hops and a slight sweetness to balance. Everything goes right with this beer, and at 6% I feel it would be no stretch to enjoy a 22oz of this one too."
""
""
""
""
"Glass- Imperial pint"
""
"Apricots and tree sap for days"
"O.  Very nice beer.  Not permanent funeral.  But very awesome.  Tastes great.  Smells nice.  Looks good.  Good mouthfeel.  Like it and will get it again."
""
"Pretty good beer, has some sour notes to it. Worth a try for sure."
""
"Delicous.  Never would have guessed ABV was only 6.0%.  Drinks much more like a heavy-bodied IPA?"
"Just a fairly average pale ale.  Nothing remarkably good or bad about it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Another good Pale Ale from 3 F's.  I won't search for this one, but would gladly pick one up if it's available.  Prost!"
"Clean drinking APA. Nothing too notable going on, would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  Like I just said, this drinks like a much bigger beer than it actually is.  I would be very happy if every 6%, hoppy beer felt and tasted like this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a crystal clear copper body with a thick beige creamy head that last and last.  There is a full herbal unripe citrus aroma even during the pour.   The taste has more spicy hop flavor with some nice big green herbal flavor and a green citrus pith finish, although it is not bitter or even pungent for the most part.  There is some tropical fruit notes as it opens and a lime hop flavor in the finish.  The creamy mouthfeel has a hop boosting crisp fizz.  This has nice full hops that are big but not punishing.  Very easy to drink many of these.  delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden orange with a nice creamy head.  Wonderful hoppy smell.  Extremely well balanced between the hops and the malt. Great finish.  Three Floyds beers seem to have a dance between the hops and malt tastes and neither is overbearing, but work well together.  Great beer!"

"R ottos. Pours a dull, golden orange color. Attractive head. It's thick and white. Lots of lacing left behind. The aroma is strongly hoppy. I get a bunch of melon notes. It's also clearly very citrusy. I get a bit of minty hops, too. There is also a light cookie sweetness. The flavor births a lot of unique hoppy descriptors in my mind. I get the citrus and melon right away. I also get the mint and a hard to describe, earthy flavor. I'd like to know what hops are being used here. As it warms I get more sweetness, grain and candied citrus character. Hops also taste lightly lemony. Surely a memorable flavor. The body is relatively light. Nice carbonation; quite spritzy. Bitterness is noticeable but not overbearing. Pretty much an IPA for all intents and purposes. I rarely get to try Three Floyds beers and was very happy to get this one in my grasp. Would love more."

"Nice work fellas!"
""

"Very floral and mild IPA, I think it's actually a pale... But is more like a very mild and enjoyable IPA. Has a nice hop profile that you can enjoy without being too 'hop heavy' or abrasive. Some great malt tones and a bit Of a creamy feel. Very delicious~"
""
""
"Slightly hazy deep golden yellow in color. Forms a moderate sized fluffy white head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is pleasant. Mildly sweet, with a distinct floral quality. Citrus, orange, grapefruit, orange blossom. Taste starts off rather sweet. Lots of citrus with some tropical fruits, neither of which are necessarily all that juicy. Mandarin orange, papaya, maybe some mango. Medium bodied. Mild bitterness. Appropriate carbonation."
""
""
"Overall: good hop flavor like many of the three floyds hoppy beers, but this one has too sweet and sticky of a malt base. the smell is a lot better than the taste. the taste comes over too sweet and doesn't quite let the hops shine."
"16 oz. pint on draft at the brewery,"
""
""
""
"Just about the time I think this brewery is becoming over-rated and that I should stop trying new beers of theirs, this one hits. Very, very solid pale ale. Drinkable, but plenty of flavor. A nice pale ale, but no more. It's certainly not the Zombie Dust killer some BAs billed it as. Would be a good buy in a ten-buck-six-pack, but this beer is overpriced in a ten-buck-bomber."
""
""
""
""
"Look, I love Three Floyds as much as the next guy and have been a card-carrying member since Day 1. But cult status and cool labels have led to a lot of over-hype. Like any brewery pumping out this volume of different brands, they won't all be winners. Space Station Middle Finger is a good everyday, emblematic American pale ale - nothing less but nothing more."
""
""
""

"Serving type: bottle."

"Overall. Great stuff. The hops seem familiar but different."

"The first time I came across this beer on draft I finished off a good chunk of the keg, and left a lot more poor. The bottle, while not quite as vibrant as draft, is excellent. It's unique to the core, bitter, delicious, and easy drinking. Space Station is one not to pass up."

"A very nice pale ale with good balance. The aroma is a little muted but good flavor."
""
""
"Three months old, was looking for an occasion to share, but no luck. Aroma is tropical fruit heavy, with notes of mango and pineapple accenting resin and a toasted caramel malt base. Flavor is piney and resiny, with tropical fruit and grapefruit underpinnings and a lightly bitter finish. No zombie dust, but a solid offering. Finish falls a bit short."
"O). One solid beer.  Maybe not ZD but it is different, much more tropical and melon favors then grapefruit but just good.  I enjoyed this beer greatly."

""
""
""
"Overall, very good brew that I'd like more of. Nice hazy golden pour. Def tastes like a FFF brew. Clean, subtle and smooth. Damn good."
""
"This is a nice beer, but it doesn't feel like anything different from their other hoppy beers. This can definitely pass for an IPA. It's really the craftsmanship that sells this beer for me. They pack a whole lot into 6%. Nice beer, but I'd personally take ZD or Alpha King over this. But at the end of the day, this is still good."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: great offering from 3f, good session brew and somewhat different from zombie dust and alpha king"
""
"Light, sweet, mild pale ale with excellent candied-citric notes.  Clean, highly-drinkable pale orange-brown brew that barely deteriorates in quality as it warms to room-temperature.  Nose has a 3F-typical candied-hop complexity: sweet, sharp, and buoyant.  Another great APA that demonstrates Three Floyds may be even better at that style than bigger, bolder IPA and IIPA for which they are so often lauded."
""
""
""
"Poured a dark hazy amber color. One Inch white head. Dank earthy smell. Citrus aroma. Taste is light. Little bit of caramel flavor with a bunch of bitterness on the tongue."
"O- Another solid beer from FFF, very happy I was able to try this.  Also love the bottle art."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Melon rind and lime zest on the nose and the flavor.  More like an IPA in terms of balance and mouthfeel to me.  ABV backs that up.  Pretty dark blonde/amber colored, so there's plenty of malt bill there.  Prickly bitterness throughout.  Smooth pale ale that is very sessionable."

"O: This beer is freaking awesome. In my opinion it is juicy, but different than all the citra pale ales that are out there. I enjoyed this more than Zombie Dust, but I have yet to drink ZD this fresh. Loved the melon I got in this beer. Delicious!"

"Alas, the waning sips begin to suppress the malt sweetness and the hops pull forth, showing a strong IPA set of proportions. Its malty-dry finish is resinous and peppery as flavors of fresh-cut grass, chive and leaf offer a snappy resinous closure with aftertaste of tropical fruit."
""
""
""
"Clean drink, light hoppy smell, finishes a little bitter but overall a good beer to pair with food, had a great burger with this one."

"The beer pours a clear golden amber with a fluffy white head that settles into a thin blanketing while drinking. The nose is ripe with grapefruit and slightly floral, has a great malty sweetness, and negligible booze. This smells similar to ZD, but is less citra-forward. The taste is generously hopped, but not overly bitter, and doesn't seem dominated by a single hop characteristic. The hop profile feel west coasty, but still maintains that perfect malt characteristic that sets 3 floyds APAs apart. It's relatively light-bodied, balanced, well carbonated, clean, and very hop-centric - but still 10/10 in drinkability (the bomber drinks faster than some 12oz bottles). I'd highly recommend this buy if you can grab fresh bottles."

""
""
""
""
"O: Not as impressed by this as I thought I would be. It tastes nice but was looking for something more juicy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A very nice hoppy pale ale from Three Floyds, another successful take on hops in a more palatable and less aggressive manner than many of their beers. The balance is nice, perhaps it could be more pungent and bright, but this is a very refreshing and enjoyable pale ale."
"Final thoughts, pricey but unique. If you can get it, try it. Especially if you like Zombie Dust."

"Bomber as an awesome trade extra. Big thanks! Pours a deep reddish orange color with a creamy nearly offwhite head that lingers a nice but. Aroma is piney citrus rinds, juicy mango, light toffee. Flavor is a juicy mango flavor with very light citrus rinds and a bit if caramel sweetness. No date on the bottle so no idea if it is fresh (assume it is). Low bitterness, resinous body, with low to medium carbonation. A very nice pale ale if on the unexciting side. Would drink it any day."

"O) I really liked this pale ale. I thought it was great. Reminded me a bit of Pseudo Sue. Citra hops here??? My complaint would be the price I paid for the bomber. Of course no one had a gun to my head. Love to see this in six packs for like $12.99. That would be just fine by me. In any case, it was quite delicious, and definitely worth a try."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by great flavors and aromas. Another great one! Three Floyds never disappoints."
""
""
"O - Not what I was expecting for the taste. The smell is similar to a mix of Pride and Joy with Alpha King, but I get that earthiness in the flavor. Good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-Another good APA from FFF, it doesn't hold a candle to ZD but it is still a yummy one. Love when they bottle more of their stuff."

"Taste is more fruit forward with the dried apricot flavor at first, a pale malt middle and a long lasting resiny bitterness in the aftertaste. A light fruity sweetness up front dovetails nicely into the bitter hop resiny finish. Easy drinking, would get this again anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at the brewery. Poured into nonic pint. Huge head and golden color. Big sweet candy hop aromas. ..fresh hop and a tad hint of yeast. Taste is smooth crisp pale malt with a big candy hop flavor...some earthy hop as well maybe? Its dry but a little thin and somewhat bitter mouthfeel. Overall a great ipa ... well worth a detour to have a pint."
"d- 3f should bottle this. Absolutely phenomenal."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. This sip started appropriately sweetly, progressing to a full, herbal, bitter, malty, and organically complex flavoring. The finish was particularly interesting, with big starchiness and licorice bite. The latter was also noted in the aroma, adding bitterness there to the otherwise sweetly blended base. The more you drink this beer the better it gets, as the flavoring and sip muddle a bit when cold. This beer will blossom for you closer to cellar temps, and sip very nicely."
""
""
"Tastes very much as it smells: wonderful APA juicy fruit up front moving into more bitter, higher-alpha nodes in the middle and end. Nice balance, but my dumb personal taste wishes it was more of the start and less of the finish."

"Overall: Personally, I found this better than Zombie Dust in a side by side. Quite possibly Three Floyds best hoppy beer yet."
""
""
""
""
"Overall another wonderful pale ale from these guys, they know pale ale and make just fantastic examples. Real easy drinking as well to boot."
"D - A nice pale ale that is perhaps a bit too bitter for heavy session potential. Still, whatever this hop is, it's a good one and I hope it makes it into more beers in the future. A good beer, but I'd actually prefer Supa Rice in large quantities."
""
"An awesome beer, an amazing compliment to their other amazing pale Zombie dust. As always, Three Floyd's excels in the hop department."
"Overall an excellent hoppy pale ale."
""
"Overall, this is pretty killer. Very happy I have an imperial pint of this to drink. So juicy and tropical! Get some of this!"
""
""
"An absolutely amazing to drink. Sits right there with Zombie Dust maybe even better honestly. Wish I could have taken a growler (or two or three...) If you're a Three Floyd's fan and you live near the pub do yourself a favor and make a trip to try this beer. Hopefully this'll become a regular production beer."
""
"O - different hop profile than Zombie, not as much citrus, was told it was an experimental hop, not named yet. I would drink this along with Zombie all day long, a really good Pale Ale! Hoping they bottle this one!"
"Let's all push hard to force FFF to make it year round bottle this one!"
