Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and hop notes with decent strength; very unique aromas. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, pine, grass, caramel, light rye spiciness, bread, and toast. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, floral, pine, caramel, light rye, bread, and toast on the finish for a bit. Good complexity of hop and malt flavors; with very balanced hop/malt flavors and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale ale. Good balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 26, 2013"

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grass, spice, pine, pine hop, and subtle citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, fruit hop, banana, and bread. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I really enjoyed how the notes of citrus in the nose and the banana in the flavor were incorporated into this brew. These slight little subtleties definitely took this one above average status for the style. I just wish there would have been more things going on if I am honest. This one definitely has a lot of potential with some subtle tweeks. Glad I got to try this one and would likely do so again.","thagr81us","Jan 23, 2013"

Fine mouth feel - not a too bubbly and also not too light either. As for the taste though - it tastes pretty strongly like malt extract. Not sure why that's the case, but it's a little offsetting. I don't expect outrageous amounts of hops, but in my opinion this beer is way too sweet for the style. In general I like Left Hand, but this is not my favorite Pale Ale - probably won't get this one again.","duffalo","Beers"

Sweet (malt) and citric (orange) aroma. I am wasn't expecting such a sweetness from an APA as it seems sweeter than some EPA's. That said, I am a fan. The flavor is sweet mixed with some citrus and it closes out with a mild bitterness. Again, I like it. A nice creamy, maybe kinda syrupy thickness to it and plenty of activity from the carbonation. I went into this expecting a relatively average APA and ending up finding it to be quite good.While it is a little straightforward and simple, maybe a little more layering to the flavor could have benefited it, but I do like it for what it is. I could see having an inflated opinion of this than others here might but, whatever, works for me and I look forward to having it again.","denver10","Jan 21, 2012"

The drink also leaves a significant amount of residual hop oil on the tongue. My criticism is that it was lighter on the malts than my experiences with other APAs. The beer drinks pretty easily, but it's lightness on malt balance may render this beer more of a hop-head's ale.","jmvecchio1","Jul 14, 2011"
4.05,17.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass...have never had this before. Pours a bright golden with a fine but not massive head. Smell is malty, with a fruity bit of subdued hops. Taste is quite mild and very smooth...this could almost be termed a mild ale. Mouthfeel is excellent. Very refreshing beer, well put together and highly sessionable. If you think you're going to find a brew to make you stop buying Alpha King, this isn't it, but if you like to keep a few different kinds of pales in the fridge, this isn't a bad one to have around, it is better than most.","chicagoabbot","Jul 03, 2011"

3.39,-2,3,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Has a strong, malty, slightly fruity, and surprisingly hoppy aroma, almost more at an IPA than an APA. It pours a clear and typical golden with a fairly thick and frothy white head. Flavor is smooth, malty and slightly fruity, a bit on the watery side but still acceptable. There was almost none of the hoppiness that the aroma promised in the flavor, but there is some in the aftertaste. Texture is fairly smooth and somewhat tingly.

The aroma is a slightly skunky citrus note that like over ripe grapefruit and orange. Medium mouthfeel. Muted citrus flavors with a slight sweetness. Rather bland in flavor to be honest with a minimal hop presence. Even in the back end there is minimal flavors.

Fairly dry and grainy in the mouth with a little of the citrus but not nearly as much as in the nose. A late grainy bitterness rounds it out.

I can detect a crisp spiceyness from the rye, nice touch. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly and quite carbonated. You know at first I wasn't blown away by the this beer. I agree, it is a more "light" beer than a lot of brews on the market. The hops are actually more aromatic than bitter flavoring. But smell dominates taste, and right now I am on my last one (first one today) and I will be tempted to buy more someday. Overall a refreshing beer that is highly drinkable, just not extremely complex.","Star80","Apr 03, 2011"

There is a bit of grassiness to the beer, and a slight rye like malty dryness. This is a good beer and the piney hops play very nicely with the dry malts, and the floral notes.

Head forms nicely, fine speckled lacing that sticks evenly with each sip to my DFH pint. Aroma spicy rye with citric/pine hops going on this is a nice straightforward drinking hoppy RyePA. America say goodbye to Jackman's Pale Ale and say hello to Stranger American Pale Ale. Adds a nice level of complexity to an APA, crisp bitterness cuts through the body...citric/pine/spicy rye comes off iniitally as the beer warms a nice caramel spiced breadiness flavor comes around. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied evenly carbonated goes down smoothly, right at 5% abv will work for an American session ale for sure.
