The floral smell introduces a floral and honey taste, leaving an oily and slightly bitter after taste. As a pale ale, it's great. It's an every day drinker, but not at $2.25 per bottle at the store. I'd drink it again.","TeamMathis","Feb 28, 2015"

Aroma is grainy, toasty & floral with bitter & spicy notes of rye, piney hops & a faint hint of grapefruit. Taste is earthy grain, toast & rye mixed with earthy  citrus & pine.  Produces a low-moderate bitter across the tongue, front to back, with a floral, grapefruit, piney resin & light pepper mixing with spicy rye & pale/lightly toasted malt background producing a nicely bitter, dry finish. Unusually the bitter does not linger in the predominantly but shortlived malty aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, dry, drawing & peppery. Pairs exceptionally with spicy boiled crawfish.","mothmanscott","Jan 10, 2015"

The taste starts with a full rye malt taste with a bit of dark fruits coming out in the sweetness of the middle, followed quickly by a nicely bitter hops finish. The feel is robust and wet, giving it a liquid bread quality that I like in a malty rye beer. This is a very nice example of a rye ale with a lot of malt, and nice use of the hops to compliment those qualities.","claytri","May 19, 2014"

There is grain but not the ultimate delivery of grain. I would have rather it came across more robust. Yet this evening as I returned from work not really looking forward to polishing off another bite of it I found instead it wasn't so bad, especially with a dinner of chicken cobbler and sauteed zucchini. My conclusion is this is a beer to accompany a hot meal on a cold night, but not necessarily a ""destination brew.""","A_Frayed_Knot","Nov 12, 2013"

Nothing too outstanding, in fact for a Pale Ale I was expecting more of hoppy presence. The taste is pretty mellow and smooth. Nothing really jumps out at you but then again nothing really really bad hits you either. I'd say this is actually a very good session type beer that you can guzzle a few down with ease and get some decent taste too. So pretty much I'd get this again for those hot summer days where you just want to enjoy a better than ok beer throughout the afternoon.","sjones5045","May 20, 2013"

I like this beer, I may have had this one a bit out of its prime, but i think that if i was introducing someone to a beer with rye in it for the first time i would choose this. The Rye is there but it plays well with the other elements in the beer. I don't know why but i think it would pair will with bacon and creamy foods like ice cream or mac and cheese. That peppery kick would cut through the cream. It would also because of the rye pair well with cured meats !","Uncle_Jimmy","Feb 20, 2013"

Pours an almost-clear golden color with a large white head that takes some time to go down. Scent is rye spiciness at first with some grain. Not much hoppiness. A touch of caramel malt. Taste is initially bread-like malt with some slightly spicy rye. There is a hoppy presence, but nothing bittering whatsoever. The rye characteristics are lovely though.Mouthfeel is light bodied, but nicely carbonated. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, it is an okay APA. The rye definitely helps. If it wasn't for the rye characteristics, this APA would be below average. Like I said before, this is an old bottle, so I'm sure it tastes better fresh.","DovaliHops","Jul 09, 2012"

Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with a smallish foamy white head that persists a bit. Earthy spicy and citrusy on the nose with a bit of sweet toffee and caramel to back it up. Taste follows the aroma very well but intensifies the spicy earthy component and lessens the citrus. Medium to thin body with a crisp level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. This is a great easy drinking summer beer for me, I wish I could get this one locally.","johnnnniee","May 02, 2012"

Poured with very little head, but maintained a wispy cap that left a few sticky lacings on the glass. Bready, biscuit malt aromas with fresh lemon hop aroma as well. Medium bodied with refreshing carbonation. Nice balance of bready malt and light lemon hop from beginning through the middle. The rye malt flavors come through toward the end and lead to a dry, bitter finish. Very refreshing and easy to drink.","IronLover","Jun 23, 2011"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours an orange amber with a fluffy bone white cap. Retention was so-so with some delicate lace strewn about. The aroma was of spicy rye and grapefruit with a bed of caramel malt. There is a nice balance here as the rye lends a perfect amount of spice and dryness while the hops deliver grapefruit and orange flavors and a mild bitterness. The malt holds its own keeping the hops from stealing the show. Easily drinkable. Medium body with a dry, mildly bitter finish.

The toasted barely flavor is replaced by a bitter sweet rye flavor. It still has hop presence and a nice mild bite that makes it an easy drinker, which isn't so unlike other pale ales that I've tasted.

It pours a brilliant orange-amber with a white head which left rather quickly and has a rich aroma of peach pie, orange and pink grapefruit. Subdued hops on the nose. The palate is bright with flavors of canteloupe and the creamy, fruity rye character adding a nice bump of body and complexity.

There is a slight hint of grain and hops on the nose, but very subtle. The flavor is grainy, but with a heavy dose of hops. Very well balanced flavors, tasting almost like a hopped amber.

The beer is fairly simple up front, displaying some of the fruitier citrus notes well, and then moving into some nice bitterness from the hops, and then that awesome rye malt kicks in and melds nicely with the bitterness in the finish.

Two fingers of fluffy white foam rise up, but disappear a little too quickly. Lacing is solid though as I make my way down the glass. The nose is equal parts bready malts, spicy and floral english type hops (guessed EKG were in the mix before checking Terrapin's site), and that distinct sharp spiciness I always get from beers that include rye malt. It's a little weak though. The taste is more of the same, and I'm having a really hard time finding the amarillo that Rye Pale Ale was supposedly dry hopped with. A nice crack of hop bite from the magnum marks the transition from the definitely present malt sweetness to the aforementioned hop and rye flavors. The body is nice, a little bit richer than I might have anticipated, but it works with this beer. Carbonation is a little too high/prickly for my tastes, but the key word there is little. A solid presence balances out the hops and rye and makes this a greatly sessionable beer. Solid offering from Terrapin, though I've seen them do better.","axeman9182","Sep 04, 2010"

Good tasting beer, but a night after enjoying the Terrapin Rye Squared Pale Ale, it's just a bit more subdued for my taste buds. Still, a nice example of a pale ale.

Pink grapefruit and orange citrus break into the nose first, hoppy with pine and floral resin notes too, the rye is present yet in a sharp manner, no breadiness really, light apricot fruit presence, few distinct malt scents, if any. Medium-bodied, fairly foamy for its weight, fills the mouth up that way. The pink grapefruit and tangerine equally omnipresent here, tends to overshadow the more delicate floral aspect. Bags of dried lawn grass present, bitter tea leaf and tar. The rye like bread crusts, no doughy softness. It's not particularly hard to drink but not very balanced nor as complete as you suspect it may have been.","farrago","Mar 22, 2009"

It has a crisp, pale, Carapils, and rye malt flavor that goes down easy an finishes bitter with a nice spicy, bitter hop taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. I love the addition of rye. It adds another layer of complexity to a APA.

Well balanced flavour, with just enough malt presence and bitterness that stayed solid through the finish. Oranges and a bit of citrus zest turned into a bit of spice towards the end.

The smell is IPA-ish, definitely hops are the predominant aroma, citrusy and not unlike Red's Rye or Gumballhead (not exactly similar beers, but the amarillo aroma is the same). The taste is nice, well balanced between the malty sweetness and the massive hops bill. I found it tastier and more drinkable than the Rogue IIPA I was drinking side-by-side with it.

The head doesn't build quite as well, but it retains decently and leaves good lace on the glass. The aroma for this beer on tap is excellent. The hop aromas are still there, but the rye malts really present themselves in the draft version of this brew. Taste is similar to bottle--tangy, herbal, and spicy citrus hop flavor is present with a light underlying balance of pale rye malts. No sweetness, but thirst-quenching bitterness. Body/mouthfeel is similar, with a little bit more carbonation on tap than from the bottle.","BamaBeerBuff","May 08, 2008"

The aroma was a little hard to detect which disappointed me a little, I got faint hops and rye but it took my nose right up to the brew. The taste was pleasent and chewy. Kind of loogey inducing which I like. Taste of oily hops and a little floral with a kiss of rye. Over all a good brew.","Portertime","Apr 26, 2008"

Some of the head seemed to stick around for pretty much the entire drink, which was a little unusual. Also when held up to light, you could see some light carbonation. The beer gave off a definite hoppy aroma. This followed through to my palate as well. I found the beer to be smooth, simple, finished with a bitter aftertaste and overall very drinkable.

The aromas are of fresh and bright, spruce/pine hop resins. Slight whafts of citrus as well. Spicy pine flavor with light pear, lemon zest, and faint grapefruit. The semi-sweet toasted malt provides adequate substance for the bright hop character. No adjunctory wheat or grain traces whatsoever. The bitterness is assertive, but light leading to a spicy pine aftertaste. Light, medium in body; active, but not over the top. Very flavorful and highly drinkable. The rye addition makes for a very interesting combination with the hops, almost giving the drinker the impression that this is an IPA. Whatever it is, it's certainly worth having a few pints when you have the opportunity.","NEhophead","Apr 20, 2008"

It pours a well-carbonated, crystal-clear orangey/gold hue, with a loose, three-finger khaki head that leaves nice lacing. Toasted and biscuity malts in the nose, with a decent helping of rye and a light backing of hops. The taste is similar, with citric/piney hops that impart a medium bitterness, but the rye is more subtle than in the aroma. Medium, drying, yet fairly smooth on the palate, and it imparts a medium finish.

Not very pleasant at all and quite a challenge to get past. Mouthfeel it rather light and not much to the taste.

Taste is a flavor explosion and a damn fine offering at that I can taste a bit of malty bread with a tangy tart hop bitter, and also some roasted chicken and a bit of wheat freshly grounded up in the mix as well.

The hops are piney/citrusy in character. This is a particularly well balanced ale. The flavor has a strong, noticeable malt backbone that stands up nicely to the hoppy, citrus and pine bitterness.

3.75,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden-orange. The head is thick and bubbly if poured aggressively, but fades fast to a loose bubbly layer. Somewhat fruity in the nose, sweet, but with sort of a sour, very slight earthy smell as well. Weirdly enough, for a beer that isn't close to one, it sure takes on the smell of many DIPA's I've had, mostly because of the malty sweetness. Lots of light but sweet malt combined with citrus hops (probly the cascade aspect of the beer). The citrus aspect comes off juicy over the middle of the sip, but the beer finishes semi-dry. The other hops used in this are more of the earthy subtle English type hops, probably giving it the dry earthy finish it shows. The carbonation seemed a bit high in the glass I initially poured but I transfered that to another glass and it came out ok, just needed to warm up a bit and release some carbonation. A good beer. A little more rye or a little more hops would have been nice in this.","MiScusi","Aug 07, 2007"

Smell is a grassy rye (who woulda thunk it) with a nice crisp hint of hops. A nice bit of malt is also present in the nose as well, very pleasant odor. Taste is of a toasted rye (once again, who woulda thunk it). Lemony hops do tingle the tounge at first, but then sugary sweetness comes through and ends with a nice bready malt to tie things up. Mouthfeel is a bit weak, maybe some more carbonation to give it more life. Balance is terrific though. Love the rye ales, and this one doesn't disappoint.

There was a good ammoutn fo floral hops to the aroma, with sweet and sour fruits present, very mild malts if any. It was a very balanced taste, with sweetness and sour playing off eachotehr well. Hops and mild yeasts present as well. Biscuit or grain and malty taste linger after each sip. At first bitter and sour, but quickly turns sweet and smooth and finally rather dry in the mouthfeel.

4.45,17.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A dark, orange amber brew with a nice white head that lasts for a bit, and leaves decent lacing on my glass as well. The aromas are awesome. I smell rye bread, fresh, oily hops, a few spicy hop notes, and some citrus fruits as well. The taste of this brew is very well integrated. There is definately an excelent blend of flavors going on here. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is simply awesome! A very interesting RYEPA!","francisweizen","Jul 31, 2004"
4.17,10.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Taste: Crisp and dry, with very nice hop flavor. I'd call this a pale ale along the lines of SNPA in terms of bitterness, but with more character. Rye addition gives a nice full body and a distinct dryness overall. Finishes crisp and dry, with fresh-baked Jewish rye bread lingering on and vying with the hop remainder for attention. Excellent.","rabidawg","Jul 20, 2004"
3.72,-1.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A quandry, this. If this beer were a straight IPA, I'd give it mad props. But the whole selling point of this beer is its unique ""RyePA"" identity. In that sense, it's a bit of a letdown. I like the concept, but there's just far too much weight on the hops; the rye is all but wasted. Tasty, but a bit pointless; it's ""WhyPA?""","WetCoaster","Jul 19, 2004"

4.45,17.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Great big sprucey hops. Wet head clings to the glass. I guess this is what they mean by a sticky head. Nice burst of flavor from the hops followed by the malt, the rye makes an interesting character. The finish is a nice lingering hop bitterness. Perfect match for a good pizza. This is such a great beer. Sweetwater IPA just lost the ranking as my favorite GA beer.","aracauna","Sep 09, 2002"
