3.34,-12.6,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,"07/31/13  On tap At Rattle N Hum, NYC. I guess I need to brush up on my beer nomenclature. I thought I knew what a pale ale was, but obviously I'm out of sync. This being in the English style, is pushing my low hoppiness tolerance. It's bearable, but a suffrage & since RnH offers sipping, I should have looked before I leapt & found myself neck deep in what might be the longest pint of my life.","seedyone","Jan 30, 2015"

The beer is an excellent blend of hops and malt.  Very piny bitter on the finish.  Very easy to drink.  I enjoyed this beer very much.","gonzo000","Jan 23, 2015"
3.9,2.1,4,4,3.75,4,4,"Poured a copper/amber with a modest head and decent lace retention. For me the aroma was dominated by malt, grain and a tiny hint of honey. The taste was a bit surprising for me in that it features a heavier than normal emphasis on hops, as compared to other pale ales I've had. Indeed, the slightly intense citric (grapefruit) hop taste and dry bitter finish and aftertaste remind me more of an IPA. That I did not detect as much of a malt backbone or sweet flavor to balance out the hops, is the only minor quibble I have with this one. No complaints about feel; lively carbonation is crisp, medium bodied and drinkable. A solid brew.","Gajo74","Jan 21, 2015"

Taste is big malt and hop bitter. Malt is toasty, bready biscuit and robust leaving the sugary sweetness behind in the nose. Hops stand up slick and resiny. There’s a kind of salty taste as well. Lingers dry with a metallic aftertaste and a bitter mouth coating. This is a heavy and full bodied pale ale whose bitterness is not for the weak. Drinks more and more bitter.

I think an excellent blend of good brewery craftsmanship coupled with a consistent taste from every bottle. Oddly enough, I have had to specifically ask my local grocer to stock this beer ! I asked the folks at Smuttynose to help and they went to work and got me in touch with the local distributor who in turn made sure my grocer had a good supply on hand. If you don't see it in the store ask! I also got a nice T-Shirt for my troubles ! All in all Shoals Pale Ale is a true go to beer.

Smells of flowery hops, but not that strong, and it is not as prevalent of other pale ales. Tastes of sweet hops and light malt, a nice balance between the two, but enough hops to have some great taste. Beer is carbonated rightly and beer is balanced for a pale ale.

3.73,-2.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a Deschutes pint glass, the body appears much darker than expected. It is a murky brown/amber color with about an inch of frothy, off-white head that seems to last forever! Long strands of wet lacing cling to the edge of the glass. It looks much more like an amber ale than a pale, but that makes it slightly more intriguing. Smell is of typical pale ale scents: grass, straw, hay, some floral hops, faint citrus (mostly lemon, touch of orange). Taste is similar, with the grassy notes taking the forefront along with some other grains (wheat, hay). A smooth malt makes up the middle, and it finishes with the hop flavor. Mouth is smooth throughout, the carbonation and hops lightening the body a bit. Overall, I’d probably reach for a slightly lighter pale were I in the sun, but for a shade sipper, this one certainly does the trick.","eclipse54","Aug 08, 2011"

You can really taste the bready malts and caramel malts when you breathe out of your nose on the aftertaste. The hop bite sticks around for a bit as well. Although straight forward its an excellent example of the style. Its right up there with the best of the best Pale Ales and definitely makes the top 3 for me. Although I've had Pale Ales that taste very hoppy this one has a very nice rich malt taste reminiscent of like I said the Samuel Adams Boston Lager but with more of a floral bitter hop bite. Excellent beer.","thebrood1987","Jul 15, 2011"

This place has a beer on draft called 412 ale the local area code brewed by Smuttynose. I've had Shoals in the past and this is definitely a reissue of that same beer with a new label. Which is fine by me I don't see the Shoals Pale ale locally very often so that's fine. Plus it's really drinking great on tap, a pale copper hue with an off white cream head forms fine even lacing. Mild fruity nose with herbal mild citric hops, a very nice baked breadiness going on with each sip.

I get a lot of the malt at first some of the biscuit but mainly a medium bodied caramel/toffee flavor.

Mouthfeel was medium with a just-right amount of hops for before bedtime. It made me want to go inside The Samuel Haley house on Smuttynose Island, look for a bed that would be just right (not too hard and not too soft) and lie down. The lacing in the glass was nothing short of beautiful as I drank. It was maybe a little more malty than the brewer had intended (best before March 2011), but I was satisfied with the intermingling of malt and hops on the tongue.

Anyways, the smell is really nice, of almost resiney, citrusy, spicy hop goodness. I cannot wait to taste this beer...yes, it even smells dry hopped. Wow, first impression is very hoppy yet SMOOTH, and balanced. The aftertaste also has like that, second layer of alpha acid hops making it quite three-dimensional. But, gosh, the malt base keeps it together, with vague toastyness, and this beer is remarkably well crafted, an astonishing Pale Ale, ranks up there with classics like Sierra Nevada. Nice lacing all around my glass. Moutfeel is smooth as well, not overly carbonated, not too thick. Just right. Soo, this one vaguely reminds me of SNPA, but in fact smoother and more complex hop taste. I could imagine this being a delicious beer with hot wings, spicey Indian food you name it.

4.62,20.9,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Just the slightest bit darker than I expected for a ""Pale"" ale, but not overly dark. Golden/amber color with slight haze from particles inside. An off-white, trying to by orange head appears and hangs out around the edges for the entire beverage. Not a heck of a lot of lacing to this though, just around the top of the glass. Smell is very good. Cascade hops dominate the nose at first, citrus and floral aromas. You can also tell by the smell that it is well malted, pale roasted malts. The taste is outstanding, perfectly balanced malt/hop combination. There is a nice sweetness from the roasted, and I'd say caramelized malts. The distinct hop flavors follow, a slightly bitter citrusy taste that complement each other perfectly. This Pale Ale can easily be drank all year round. The mouthfeel is good. It's medium bodied with a good carbonation feel. The start of sweetness and the bitter finish feels clean. This beer is close to as drinkable as can be without being perfect. As mentioned earlier, it's a year round drinkable pale ale. A good introduction on what pale ales should be like. A home run by Smuttynose in my opinion.","AndyAvalanche","Jul 11, 2010"

Still has the bitter taste, mostly at the finish, goes down smooth, tastes almost sweet at the beginning as you are drinking then finishes bitter.

Medium-bodied, the bitterness continues here with mineral water, iron notes and sauna stone smoke. The grapefruit pith clearer, foresty sort of herbaceousness, floor matter. Even the yeast, bread notes seem to get covered up. Carbonation is palpable, however, can't really increase the pacing.

Sweet roasted malts layered with floral and earthy hop bitterness that blends well together. Nothing more needed from a pale ale and this one certainly delivers.

The beer is clear amber with a whitish bubbly head, retention, and a little lacing too. The smell is your very prickly hop aroma with some yeast bite in there too. The smell is good, but it is less balanced than the taste implies. The taste is robust and very good. This is a complex brew with a nice prickly, carbonated, wide mouth hoppy dryness that tastes like it comes from the sea. There is some saltiness in this beer a bit more malt in the finish. The one word that comes to mind with this beer is just simply robust. There are some nice flavors in the malt, perhaps a little nutty flavors hidden in the background, and a prickly mouthfeel. There is ample carbonation and a modest aftertaste. This is well worth seeking out.

Tiny bubbles cascade with the pour. Smell of sweet malt and citrus. Essence of caramel. Sweetness is there at the very start and gets bombarded with citrusy hops in flavor and aroma. Expert use of dry-hopping. Malt continues on in an undercurrent of flavor. This pale ale is bigger than many IPA's. Lip smackin' hop juice.

Again the flavor is led by citrus hops but quickly gives way to nice rounded maltyness. There is also a strong salty presence, maybe a bit off but I kind of like it.

Following the hops splash their way into the picture giving off a grassy earthy flavor with just a hint of citrus in the mix.

It's almost piney, or woody, but not in a hoppy way, if that makes sense. Taste is good. This is the perfect example of a beer where the hops and malt are very well balanced and niether takes charge, allowing other flavors (fruits, nuts, berries) to come out, making for a complex brew.

Deeply concentrated brown sugars and malt in the aromas remind me of some sort of baked artistry involving walnuts, butter and vanilla. Then, of course, there is the nuance of green resin. Its relative proportion is bound to depend on how accustomed to hops and other herbs one is. On the palate the piney, citric qualities are surer while the malts form a glossy coating of brandy, nuts, poppy liqueurs and tanned coconut flesh.

Winds out with a good amount of bittering, not juicy but more resinous in quality. There's a lot of Pales that come and go, this one gets points for being more stolid and different than many.

Incipient waft of browned caramel and butterscotch is quickly contrasted by softly citrusy, mildly herbal hops. Subtle hints of carob and dried fig esters surface as the beer warms. Medium toffee sweetness initially in flavor is promptly offset by sharp, catty hop bitterness accompanied by notes of singed, overbaked biscuit. Mellows somewhat mid palate, with mild, well integrated diacetyl burnishing the rough hop presence. Becomes progressively more woody, leafy and earthy as it oxidizes, and approaches a fresh best bitter in character late. Nearly creamy, aptly viscous mouthfeel and judicious carbonation complements the mellow malt profile. Finishes softly savory, with a fading suggestion of salted grainy cracker. A unique pale that begins harshly in flavor, but redeems itself as it breathes. All around it's well balanced, but perhaps overly tame. Quite tasty, nonetheless!","marc77","Aug 07, 2003"

3.78,-1,4,3.5,3.5,3,5,"Amber pour with a medium white head, mostly diminishes and leaves little lacing. Aroma is mildly malty (caramel, biscuit), mildly floral hops. Flavor starts with the mild caramel and biscuit, middle is clean, ends lightly hoppy. Body is medium, light carbonation.","goz","Jun 12, 2003"
4.43,16,4,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,"This is a fabulous pale ale, one of the best I've ever tasted. Probably a bit hoppier than most other pale ales, which may account for my enthusiasm for it. This is a beer that I intend to keep in my stable often.","Darkale","Jun 08, 2003"
4.12,7.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall this is a good pale ale and at $5.99 a six well worth revisiting.","PhantomVodoo","Jun 06, 2003"
4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Cloudy-amber in appearance. Impressive chalky-white head is very thick and laces the glass. Aromas are malty sweet, with a candied fruit hovering in the background. Taste is sweet as well, with a slight citrus bittering effect at the end. Flavors and aromas in general are very mellow and very tasty. Smooth mouthfeel and quite easy to drink. Yet another very nice cask-conditioned ale sampled at the AOBF.","OldFrothingSlosh","May 27, 2003"
4.04,5.8,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"An off-white head rests upon the deep amber body then settles fairly quickly into a thin coating. The lace sticks in thin spotty patches. A full doughy malt aroma dominates with essences of fruit and wet wood. The full malt body is caramel sweet and a little pasty. The multi-hop bitterness is mostly of mild citrus with a light fruity taste. Very rounded and almost buttery in texture. Nice Beer.","BeerResearcher","May 24, 2003"
3.87,1.3,3.5,4,4,3,4,"This beer pours a lightly hazed dark copper color with a nice medium off-white head. The smell reveals light fresh baked bread and buttery tones. The taste is a mild but nice blend of roasted malts with a light burned taste (but in a good way) with light hops and fades into a light bitter end. The mouthfeel is that of a light bodied brew and finishes lightly dry. It is not a overly complex brew, but it is a solid one. This could perhaps fall into my session beer category. Thanks to McCall for the opportunity! Cheers!","BeerAngel","May 08, 2003"
3.88,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Shoal's is a sturdy Pale Ale, with a dense mouthfeel and a bold ruby color, displaying a full off-white head. It's the kind of ale you can really sink your teeth into, chewy and thick. An initial hoppy bitterness never really subsides, though it becomes a bit more lemony mid-palate. Beneath the bitterness are elements of toasted grain, malt and a trace of something like instant coffee, though nothing that distorts the basic flavor profile of this pale ale. A good, drinkable beer.","jward","Apr 01, 2003"

3.5,-8.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a brownish color and looks like it is thick. Not too much head, yet laces extremely well, to the bottom of the glass. Lightly tart smell, semi sweet. The taste is interesting, sweet, tart, malty and slightly hoppy. Thick in the mouthfeel, yet is light going down, reminds me of an English Ale. Very drinkable, smooth, yet good carbonation. Sweet yet tart. Clean easy finish, yet slightly hoppy. Nice beer.","HopheadEd","Jan 30, 2003"
4.15,8.6,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Very fine lace clinging to the glass on top of the reddish amber brew. Smelled of very rich, sweetish toasted malt and somewhat fruity hops. Caramel, toasted grains, and sweet malt are major flavor players in this one, as well as a tiny bit of diacetyl, maybe. A great tasting brew. I am always happy to see an English Pale Ale as they are a very nice departure from the over-the-top American style pale ales. The only fault I see in this is perhaps it is a bit too sticky.","yen157","Jan 27, 2003"
3.95,3.4,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Ah what a refreshing beer after a hard day of moving tons of boxes loaded with beer, and at least a million boxes full of glasses, well maybe not that many, but I did work up a sweat! Alternatively, is it raining in here, been a long time since I did enough manual labor to break a sweat.","Gusler","Jan 17, 2003"
3.68,-3.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Before I discovered the likes of Hop Devel and Alpha King (among others) I probably would have considered this to be a highly hopped ale but now I judge the hop level as pretty run of the mill. Still a nice pale overall. Beautiful copper color with a substantial head and lace. Faint citrus aroma. Good body and mouthfeel, the Shoals goes down easy. A good session ale. I think I'll have another or two.","mickstepp","Jan 13, 2003"
3.47,-9.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Malt nose with a touch of hop in the sinus. hazy amber color with a slight touch of purple. 1/4 inch white head. Smooth big malt backbone to the taste with a hop flower finish. The tongue is left slightly sour and bitter. Fuller mouth than I am used to for a pale ale. Rich and smooth but a little thick for me. This factor hurts the brews drinkability. Its a good cup of tea.. just not my cup of tea in the long run as pale ales go.","frank4sail","Jan 03, 2003"

4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Living in Portsmouth, I consider this my local ""Bud"". It is the benchmark from which I compare other local beers. It is not too bitter, and goes down quite smooth. Not the best pale ale, but from my location, the freshest. If you want the best retail brew from Smuttynose, this is your baby.","bewareOFpenguin","Sep 26, 2002"
3.77,-1.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Rich amber color that is a little cloudy, which is a good thing.  Not a sizable head maybe the way I poured it.  A nice scent of aroma hops with a mixture of english pale malts that compliments the hops nicely, with a balanced blend of bittering hops.  Overall a good beer but the not the best pale ale I have had.","kunzbrew","Sep 18, 2002"
4.33,13.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Rich amber color, lots of delicious hop bubbles pop through a creamy off-white head. Noticablely thick hop smells, makes for a very inviting beer. Lots creamy rich malty undertones. Crisp highly hopped middle. Very crisp and refreshing beer. Medium bodied, perfectly balanced for a Pale Ale. Easy going down, and very smooth drinking. Count me as a new smuttynose fan.","StevieW","Sep 08, 2002"

3.88,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Good color, with a strong hint of hops.  Not to fruity, I like it.  Picked this up from Kappy's in Medford.  This beer is a standout among new england micros.","slurpinhops","Jul 27, 2002"
4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice copper color with a medium body and nice fluffy sticky head. On the nose there is a aroma of tangy fruit. On the palate there is flavors of freshly-baked bread, hop crispness, dry grains, and sweet malts. In the finish its a bit dry. Overall this was a enjoyable pale alemy first brew from smutty nose brewing co.","WilliamPhilaPa","Jul 27, 2002"
4.28,12,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"From the pour you know this is not going to be your average pale ale. Amber colored body with nice fluffy head. Initially this tastes sweet and fruity but turns a little more balanced as you drink. The hops presence is perfect for this brew. Bitterness does not overpower the malts and it leaves a nice  floral hop flavor on the tounge. An easy drinking session brew.","Longstaff","Jul 11, 2002"
4.08,6.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Another great New England beer. Darker amber than most pales but closer to original hue from back when pale ales were the alternative to pitch black stouts. Thick, long-lasting head and fragrant aroma with hints of sweet malts, flowers, and yeast. This is a big, thick chewy pale ale, balanced by hops that add clarity and singularity to the flavor. There is also a burnt woody flavor deep down that might just be the outskirts of the hop flavor but I found unique. Lingering aftertaste also has hints of this.","Thrasher","Jul 09, 2002"
4.33,13.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"What a great brew.  Somewhat darker than most Pale ales, but has a wonderful flowerey aroma and taste.  Nice amount of hops makes this beer so crisp, with enough bitterness to appeal to hop lovers.  Head stayed throughout.  A lovely balanced beer.","AaronRed","May 06, 2002"

3.15,-17.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Heartier pale ale than most.  I usually enjoy the diacytal(sp?) that Ringwood beers throw off, and it's cetainly acceptable in this style but I found it to be over the top in this brew.  Perhaps the 4+ months in the bottle had gotten to the better of this.  Would happily try a fresh draft of this.","pbrian","Jan 28, 2002"
4.3,12.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Very refreshing.  Not an over-the-top American pale ale, but has plenty of hops to do the job, nonetheless, and balances out a substantial malt.  Very drinkable - nothing fancy, just solid quality beer.","Brent","Jan 20, 2002"
