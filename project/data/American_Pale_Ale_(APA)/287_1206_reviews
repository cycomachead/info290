"O: kinda like a pale ale done like a rustic, homespun saison - reminds me of Hof Ten Dormaal's Blond that I had recently, just with slightly different yeast character and more biting hop bitterness"

"Nothing incredibly special about this brew. It has some bitterness to it that gives it some depth, but for the most part it comes across somewhat hollow and leaves me a little underwhelmed...ESPECIALLY in comparison to the vast array of Bell's other delicious beers."

"overall a bland pale that I wouldn't recommend. I had it free, so I can't complain, but I wouldn't return to this."

""

"OK beer, but nothing really good I could say about it."

"New packaging since my original experence with the beer. Hazy golden color and a grainy aroma? A bit of malt character that finishes with a bitter bite. Grainy malt and some sweetness. Not one of the better bells offerings and maybe priced higher because of the bells name? Worth a try, goes down easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very sessionable APA that I would be happy to put down all evening long, enjoyable but not overly complex and the hops are not as big as in some other offerings in the style. Easy to drink with the less intense flavors/aromas and well hidden alcohol."
""
"A rather unexciting take from Bell's. Pale and pushes toward a typical APA, but ultimately falls a little short. It's still decent to drink, but there are better options for the same price."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I have to say I'm quite disappointed. I expected much more from Bell's. It's not a bad beer, but there's nothing impressive about it. Bland smell, bland taste, and too much carbonation. I won't be buying this again."
""
""
""
""
"O: It's pretty decent, I'd opt for this over almost all mainstream beers, but from what I've experienced from Bell's, I expected much more, but not terrible, not at all."
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a creamy, thick, off-white head. Aroma is quite bad, skunky smelling. Taste is much better, a light cracker malt, followed by some pine and citrus hops. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a decent beer, that would be much better without the bad aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel : Medium bodied feel. Carbonation kills the likability."
"O: I thought this was a pretty good pale ale. I like how there were so many particles and the head was excellent. The taste was a little dull though."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"This beers not all that complex, but it's a decent session brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is just too generically bitter without any of the good hop flavors that make pale ales enjoyable. Fine to have on draft with lunch for $5 but nothing I would want in a 6 pack amount."
"While I would like to pretend to myself that I don't frequently whine about styles, this has some style issues. This smells and tastes like an American Blonde Ale. And it's not great, even for that style. It isn't bad, though, but typically when I drink a beer from Bell's, I start to feel sad that I can't get it on the East Coast. I won't be sad to not drink this again anytime soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid, clean, and enjoyable pale ale. One at a session is good for me, however if you are looking for a pale, this is certainly worth a shot."
""
""
"If someone were to tell me this were Bell's, I wouldn't have guessed it, based on some of their others beers I've had. Regardless of that, it's still a solid beer I'd very gladly have again."
""
"Overall: It's a decent beer, but not a very good American Pale Ale. I can't say I disliked it, but it didn't blow me away either. I'd recommend this to people that find most Pale Ales lacking a certain ""kick", but not to the average beer drinker."

"Bottle to glass. Poured a great gold color, slightly cloudy with a solid white head. Good lacing with some head remaining throughout the drink. Good hop aroma, slight grainy smell as well, but had my mouth watering! The taste wasn’t as good as the smell, malty, bitter, but nothing special. Body was good and finished quickly. Not a first choice, but definitely will drink again!"
"A pretty nice beer but nothing spectacular. That bitterness really it what brings it down as it is dull and a little musty. It's not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I didn't think Bell's could make a beer this more, it doesn't have the malt or hop profile of an APA. It is an ok beer but fell very short for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's like a regular pale but with less dark hops. I has a creamy mouthfeel that is great but not what I expect. Overall, it's a good brew that everyone should try and should not be refused, but it is a bit understated."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - This is the same brewery that made Two Hearted and Kalamzoo Stout? I never would have guessed. This beer is a miss on a lot of levels. I thought it may have been because of the ge, but it isn't that old, five months. I see a lot of BA's are disappointed. Not a good APA at all, not a good beer. Kinda reminds me of Corona, seriously. Not recommended."
"Overall-- APA is my favorite style... And this is a pretty average take on the style. Surprising disappointment from such a great brewery."
""
""
"O: This is a simple and basic Pale Ale. It is a great representation of the style. The mild flavors blend together to create a pleasant and pleasing beer. No frills, no twists, and nothing hitting you over the head. This is just a classic, simple Pale Ale."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, citrus. Taste is different, spicy, hops ,bitter, lemon. not really what I was expecting. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good summer brew; I’m getting essentially the same enjoyment out of this beer that I did from their Amber Ale. At any rate, if you like raw, chewy grains, then you’ll get a kick out of this beer."

"It may be the age of the brew, but judging from other reviews I'm not alone in this regard. A miss for me."
""
"Drank in the dark so not sure of the appearance but it did provide a nice foamy head. Smells of citrus fruits and pine. Its full of flavors with a spicy prickly taste. Not really what I was expecting for the style. It is different but that sets it apart from others in it class. Not very bitter and leaves a lingering flavor of pine and spice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer caught me off guard a bit, as it truly looks and starts just like a witbier. The pale ale is much more apparent at the finish of the sip, with the hops shining long into the finish and between sips. I know this gets alot of lower marks, but as I like both styles, I really like this hybrid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Falls flat for a pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: This is really an odd little thing. It is drinkable and tasty, but I have no clue what is going on. I wish Bell’s would drop the witbier part and concentrate on making this a full-fledged, citrusy pale ale."
""
"Overall - It was just okay. Pretty unremarkable and I really feel like it even missed the mark on a pale ale."
""
"This is an alright APA. The flavor is definitely not forward or robust in any way nor is there any standout qualities. It is however drinkable and enjoyable. I would have it again if offered."
"Overall, while this is a very drinkable beer there is not much to set it apart. I've tasted several pale ales that i will pick ahead of this one."
"Single bottle sampler from a pick 6. Very average in every way for an American pale ale. Agree with an earlier poster about the ""sea monkey"" appearance. Refreshing however and would be nice for a hot day. Probably would not go out of my way to buy again. Not nearly as good as other Bell's offerings in my opinion."
""
""
"(D)- Not bad. A straightforward pale ale but a good one at that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not my favorite style, but it did grow on me as I worked my way through it."
""
""
""
" O: Overall a great beer from the folks from Bells Brewery strait to you."
"O- nothing special here...decent beer but no better than an MHD or bud."
""
""
""
"Honestly, as far as a recommendation goes, this is a ""stay away"" for me. Get a single if you want, but don't spend the money on a 6 pack. If you're set on a Bells ale, Two Hearted is absolutely the best bang for your buck."
"O-this is better than i expected after looking at the sites ratings. Pretty pleased with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is light in body and low in carbonation on the palate, the beer is mostly just a thin malt syrup flavor, nothing much else. Mild hops, no bitterness, not a repeat."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is citrus and pine hops, too, with a slightly bitter finish. Plentiful malt presence seems to balance it well. Another solid session offering from Bell's."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer doesn't exactly have an attractive appearance or an inviting smell but it makes up for it in other ways. Im used to really hoppy pales that border IPA's so for me, its hard to really classify this as a pale. Its really smooth and anybody could drink it so in that regard, its pretty decent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: When first smelling this beer and looking at the ""floatees"" in it, I didn't think I would like it. However, this is really a great beer. Could use a touch more maltiness flavor though. Love how the hops just sit in your mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz, freshness dated bottle, into a pint glass. Color was true to name, with a creamy white, one-finger head that maintained good retention. The nose was bready with a bit of flower noted. I liked the taste as it followed the nose with a good bit of biscuit and a bit of black pepper. Medium-bodied with a lingering aftertaste. Overall, a pretty good offering. I'll partake again!"
""
""
""
"Overall - This is more of a wheat ale then anything, with added spices, hops and such. Not bad but doesnt work for me. Too bitter for being what it is, and really, not overal great flavor at all. Decent and easy enough to drink, but nothing special."

"Appearance is a slightly hazy golden straw color with an ample white head. Lots of lacing left on the glass adds to the experience. Nothing special going on with the nose; mainly malt scents with a slight citrus scent. The malts are up front in the taste, followed by a bitter floral taste in the finish. At first I liked the taste, but as I drank more of it and it warmed, I enjoyed it less. I'll take the average and give it a 3.5. Mouthfeel was above average for an APA. Bell's makes some very impressive beers, but this is not one of them."
""
""
"O: Nice beer, goes down easy and good for a few."
"This is an good quaffable brew. Not sure why this isn't rated higher to be honest. I could sit and watch the game and down a sixer of these easily and not be unhappy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a mature pale ale, but it's not outstanding in the field."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I could crush a sixer of this bright sunny brew in no time. I suspect it's underrated because it doesn't conform to the APA style guidelines. If they called it a blonde or ""golden"" ale, the reviews would probably skyrocket. In any case, Bell's Pale Ale is a scrumptious beer with eminent drinkability, and I'll be seeking it out in future."
""
"O: I would have no problem drinking this beer all night long. It’s not that complex but is very sessionable."

"This beer is a golden blonde color, with a healthy head. As I take the aroma in I detect bready malts and coriander, with a slight hint of hops. The taste has a floral touch, full of wheat and rich graininess, and a citrus background. It finishes with a alight bitterness on the tongue. The mouth feel is medium and overall, no one thing dominates. I began to appreciate this beer more as I went through it for its subtleties. Underrated."
"Not a bad beer at all. But in a crowded field, it is nothing more than a cheapest beer available purchase. Which is how I purchased it the last time and remembered why I should have spent an extra buck on Sierra Nevada."
"This brew poured out as a traditional hazy yellowish gold color with a fluffy white head on top. The head had a pretty good retention to it and a good lacing also. The smell of the beer had some fresh grain aromas with some hoppy aromas in there as well. The taste of the beer was average in my opinion. The flavors of grains and bitter hops seemed to be pretty well balanced here. The mouthfeel was light bodied with a tingling carbonation to it. Overall this beer was decent."
"2/20/13-Just had this again and feel the same way. Perhaps I've been spoiled by all of the hoppy and more flavorful APA's out there, so this one remains average in my book."
"Overall: Nothing impressive here; I find the taste unappealing and the aftertaste even more-so. By far the most disappointing Bell's beer I've had."
"A soild beer but a forgettable beer. The only thing I really enjoyed about this beer was the floating sediment in the glass which gave it a cool look. With this being a pale ale, I expected more hoppy bitterness and it just wasn't there. Outside of the look of this brew, everything else was average and I think my score reflects that."
"O: This isn't a bad beer, but I guess I'd like a little more from an APA. Would this be better as an Eglish Pale Ale? Yep. This recipe would probably make a very good Pilsner. Oh well. Not a bad beer, but nothing I'd seek out again."
"O - I thought Bell's could do much better in this space. This beer tasted mass produced."
"Overall Impression- How can you call this an APA? Not enough hop or attribute behind it. I would call it an English Pale Ale but not an APA at all. An easy drinking pale ale but I'd rather go for others in its style or even others from Bell's. Will not be returning to anytime soon..."
"Pours an amber color with 2 finger white head. Quick fading and leaves little lacing. Smell is pretty straight forward with plenty of malts, some sugar, and little hop presence. Average smelling beer. Taste is also just average. Somewhat watery. Some malts and toffee on the palate. Mouthfeel is pretty thin. Overall this is pretty drinkable but really doesn't stand out in any way."
"O - It's a Pale ale, hmmm. not much here."
"O - Less than optimal boldness/hoppyness. Really just tastes grassy, dont really like this one as much as I hoped, I figured since I live and die for 2 hearted ale that I'd give this a try, probably wouldnt drink again on my own unless a friend preferred something like this. Definitely not terrible, definitely not great"
"update: On closer scrutiny (and a few more beers) I believe I was too harsh in my initial evaluation. The pour is quite nice with a nice tight head. Taste is much better than any adjunct lager and I upgraded this beer accordingly. Still not overwhelmed though."
"Light texture in the mouthfeel. Not Bells best effort."
"Overall this just seems strange, unbalanced, and barely even to style. Floral sense as mentioned? Not even close. I always wondered why there never seemed to be anyone buying this or mentioning this brew from Bell's considering some of their really good beers. Now I think I know why."
"I enjoyed this beer. It was the first of four Bell’s I tried and I ended up going back to it a few times."
"Bell's Pale comes into the glass splashing a golden tan shade with a nice bright look. Pouring real hard, I got a decent cap to stare at, just a dead calm, some small etchings of lace as well. Smell is mostly pale malt and some grass and light aroma hops, nothing to large though. Taste is lackluster, faint hops, earthy, hay, no citrus, no real pine, no real nothing. I got more out of Bell's Amber which is saying something. Pale malt is not to heavy which is commendable. The body seems on point, light and crisp carb, it's just lacking any taste from remaining on the palat for more than a few seconds. I drank it and thats that."
"O- it's average, had better, had worse. Won't drink it again, but at least i tried it."
"D - Very drinkable. Could have used a bit more kick somewhere as the flavor just feels a tiny bit empty."
"D/O: This mediocre pale ale combines English malt qualities with nuanced herbaceous hops in a package that is uncharacteristically blond for the style. Expect it to serve in versatile roles, but it isn't likely to reveal any new beer horizons to the drinker."
"A solid Pale Ale, although not the best out there and not the best beer Bell’s is brewing. Still, it is fairly tasty, crisp and refreshing. Glad to have tried it, but won’t become a regular in the rotation."
"O: I made a pale ale homebrew that I didn't like recently and this reminds me far too much of it. I don't feel the need to ever give this a try again."
"Overall: Decent beer overall. If it weren't considered a pale ale, I might have rated it higher. With so many good pale ales out there, I can't give this one great marks. I'd much rather have a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale any day. I'm glad I tried it, but I won't be buying it again."
"Taste is quite grainy, a little tannic actually with a side of wheat husks. There is some dry, hoppy bitterness on the finish, but there is a serious lack of flavoring hops. Mouthfeel is fine, a good body with moderate sweetness and creaminess. With as many really good to excellent beers Bell's puts out, this one is a total dud. It may be a bit harsh on the beer by itself, but c'mon Bell's…seriously? You really cant brew a fantastic APA? This one is merely good, I guess you cant knock em all out of the park. Glad this was only a single…especially at the price Mr. Larry Bell charges for six-packs."
"Enjoy"
"O - This had to be an off cask or an old one...or this is the way the beer is supposed to taste...I was not too impressed with this one from Bell's"
"O - Not too fresh to say the least. The hops were all but non existent and the bready malt took on a life of its own as a result. I will have to give this one another try in the future."
"Excellent pale yellow color, nice thick creamy white head. Interesting aromas including something slightly cheesy? Can't put my finger on it. Ultimately fairly bland and 1 dimensional with a pretty muted hop profile. Easy drinking, moderately bitter, but in the end kind of boring. The least impressive beer from this brewery I have tried so far. All the others were pretty memorable."
"adequate carbonation, medium to light in body. very refreshing on a hot summer day while still getting your hop fix on. but i would pass on this for some cheaper, easier to obtain pale ales..."
"Aroma is a mixture of sweet citrus, flowers and bread. Medium white frothy head. Beautiful hazy golden color. I would not be surprised at all if there was a little wheat in here to smooth out the texture. Mouthfeel is a little too smooth for the style, but it is wonderful on the palate. Tastes like a sharpened Oberon. Moderate carbonation. Very, very dry taste. Healthy bitterness. Smooth with gentle spiciness. Excellent hoppy finish. This might be my new favorite summer beer. Clean and refreshing, good, above-average PA. An excellent beer."
"O - I'm glad I put this in a mixed-6, but knowing Bell's prices around me I wouldn't buy it by itself"
"O - This is a decent brew, but it is stylistically a 'tweener'; anyone seeking a hoppy APA, even a standard APA, should disregard this offering. That said, it is plenty drinkable."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a light hazy golden. This was only my second offering from Bell's, as i have to drive to DC or northern Va to get it. My first was Two Hearted Ale, so the standard was set pretty high, maybe a little too high for this one. The label describes it as ""a blond ale...with a distinctive spicy, floral aroma and taste."" I'd say this is totally accurate. The floral taste just does not do much for me. It's not a bad brew, and having it on a hot Sunday afternoon while working on my deck was probably an appropriate time for it, as it was light and refreshing. But just found it to be nothing special, and i'll probably not be picking any more of this up on future road trips."
"O - A looker, but not much beyond it really. I wouldn't call this a total miss but its nothing special"
"This one pours a very hazy pale yellow color crested with two fingers of head that retain and lace very nicely. Aroma is weak and primarily citrus and grains. First thing's first. This is a different monster than the average APA you'll have. The up-front citrus and the backing herbal hops give it a completely different character than most APAs, which use bright, juicy hops. Here, all the brightness is imparted with the citrus, and the herbal hops help temper it. The mouthfeel is solid, it's well-carbonated and has a lighter body. The drinkability is quite good. Overall, this was a solid and fairly unique pale ale that's very easy to drink."
"O: Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from the style. I feel like this beer is underrated, it's very light and tasty but not strong in any particular area. Good lawnmower beer."
"M/O. . The mouthfeel is a creamy smooth medium body that finishes off dry and overall this is a good beer with some nice hops flavor that balances well with the sweetness of the brew. Not sure why this did not get a better rating by most reviewers. I am glad I tried this and will buy it again."
"Overall I am pleased with this brew. It's well balanced but lacks a little in the aroma department."
"M/O: Crisp and light beer with some crispness from the carbonation. Decent interpretation of the style."
"That said, there's nothing to prevent you from having many, because it goes down like water. A good session beer, I guess, or good for drinking while you mow the lawn."
"So, this beer poors slightly hazy pure Budweiser golden, thin bubbely head, very thin yellow straw like color. Not quite sure whats going on with this beer, but it smells very... funky? I detect the pilsner malts and the citrus lemon front from the hops, but its not mixing well. Big rubber type smell with a metallic tone. This tastes more like a tea than a pale ale. Ginger, spice, clove, herbs, tastes kinda like lemon flavored medicinal herbal tea. Light bodied, highly carbed. I did not care for this at all, it was just all over the place. Glad i only had one. NOW! Onto the next beer..."
"The mouthfeel is average, it is drinkable and refreshing."
"Overall: A good version of an American Pale Ale. Not the best but good."
"Well, I haven't had this yet, so my mixed sixer decision was pretty easy to make this time. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises coriander, orane peel, slightly dank wheat, and a touch of caramel. That wheat smell just doesn't really work very well for my 'strils. The taste is a blast of vague and blunt rind-y bitterness, with a kiss of musty caramel for effect (I assume). Wow...no... The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry-ish finish. Overall, I never thought I would dislike a Bell's product this much. I never really wanna have this again. Boo."
"O: Far too bitter without any of the good hop flavors that make pale ales enjoyable."
"O - Nothing too special here. An average, easy drinking pale ale. Nothing more, nothing less."
"I haven't had a Bell's that I didn't like."
"Drinkability is fine, it's a session ale, no flaws, just boring."
"It's pretty apparent that Bell's was going for something a bit different here. Something that deviates from the standard APA that we've all come to know and love. Despite the risky move, they came along with a decent brew. I'll leave it at that. Decent."
"Poured in my mug and was surprised with the amount of yeast floating in the beer. The head was a one finger foam of medium bubbles, leaving little lace and less cling from the lace. The color is a hazy 5 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell of grapefruit and malt is in the forefront with aromas of wheat and corn is lighter fragrances. There is also a touch of black pepper. Taste is an improvement over the looks and smell. Great taste of the hops in nodes of grapefruit. There is some flavors of malt, wheat, oats, and spices. There is quite a bit of body in the mouthfeel of this brew, creamy and just the right amount of zing. Some aftertaste of the hops linger. Got better as it warms. I might have to give another a try in the future."
"O: A slightly better than average pale ale. Sessionable, though nothing overly impressive. This was one of the first beers I had from Bell's many years ago and it caused me to not buy their beers for quite some time. Having come to revisit this beer, I remain unimpressed by it."
"D: Nice drinkability. Pretty easy to enjoy a few of these on a hot day - would be pretty ideal."
"O: Meets all requisite points for an American Pale Ale, and is less watery than others I've tried in the genre. Just an average APA in my opinion."
"O-Like all the other aspects of this beer, its not bad, its just average. And when it comes to Bells, I expect more than average."
"I wouldn't recommend this beer."
"Wow, the first I have had from Bell's where I was disappointed. Average at best pale ale."
"D: Very high, at 5.2%, you really can't taste the alcohol, or feel it for that matter. Very drinkable."
"Not good, flavors are weak, very disappointing."
"O - Nothing special here, easy to drink, but can pass on this one quite easily."
"I cannot believe all the reviewers out there who dis this beer. The people I have sampled it with all like this beer. First off, it's unique. It's not your typical west coast over hopped cascade boring beer. Frankly I don't know what hops are in it but the taste is very distinctive and kind of citrusy but not like the so called west coast citrus which is more like pine in my opinion. The beer is full tasting not thin as suggested by some who of the reviewers.The guy who owns that beer distributor in the South Hills of Pittsburgh area says it's his favorite beer. He has dozens of craft beers ,most of them more expensive and that's the one he drinks. It is fresh tasting and doesn't have that typical caramel sweetness. This beer is similar in some ways to Bell's Oberon, another fine example. To conclude if you beer drinkers think that over hopped beers like Sierra Nevada are the alpha and omega of your beer desire don't buy this. If you like a fresh tasting, satisfying and pleasant experience out of the norm then you MUST go buy this beer. I go to California every year and because it is not distributed there as yet I have to suffer the experience of drinking all those IPA that pretty much taste the same."
"Overall enjoyable, but not outstanding. It's probably my least favorite Bell's beer so far."
"O - Im slightly biased because i do like medium-darker beers but Im really just a fan of flavor. This beer lacks alot there and would only be appropriate for a summer bbq of sorts."
"D: A pretty average pale ale. Bitter but and floral and spicey hoppy no citrus hop flavor."
"Medium-full body, a tartness up front with a medium effervescence overall. Decent but a touch hoppy for me, seems more west coast style."
"The beer pours a dark yellow color with a decent cap of foam. An odd sour mix of malt and citrus hops. Smooth on the palate. The grainy malt and the citrus hops combine to form a nice flavor. However there is something through the center which is slightly off. I am not sure if it some off-kilter malt or what, but it brings the beer down just a bit."
"Drinkability is pretty high. The beer is only 5% and kind of watery. Not really bitter or drying. However, I would not seek this out again. Plenty of other better pale ales out there"
"m/d - Soft cooling tingle. This is a refreshing beer. Cooling above everything else. No bitterness, hardly any hop profile at all. I could drink this one all night...although might get a bit boring after 2 or 3."
"D - I'd have another even like this but I think this one might be off."
"Appearance is kind of a mixed bag with this beer. The head is large and lovely with good retention, leaving many lace rings on the glass. But the yellowish color and lack of clarity is less than impressive. Smells clean and fresh. A little floral, but not a strong hop presence. Tastes good but isn't very flashy. Slightly grainy pale ale with a small floral hop flavor and a soft bitterness. Mouthfeel is fluid and somewhat dry. Carbonation is lively yet not excessive. Drinkable ale that won't wow your palate but has session potential."
"This pale ale is a little different. It looks amazing in the pint glass. Nice head, lacing, golden and carbonation. Smells of wheat, yeast and a little floral of hops.Taste is more earthy, metalic with a slight trace of hops. Bells makes some of the best craft brew in the world but this pale ale is just all right."
"D: Again, there isn't anything here to blow you away. For the style, it is about as average as you can get to. This is such a broad catergory and this beer will get lost amongst many more flavorful and unique pale ales."
"D: This seems off for the style. The unfiltered floating stuff is offputting in a pale ale. The flavor is nothing noteworthy. At least I tried this. I'll stick with 2 Hearted and Hopslam for my Bell's pale family."
"D - unique -- it's like other pale ales I've had in overall lightness and ease of drinking but that's the only similarity; so much going on here -- complex flavors keep it interesting; not for slamming"
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, dry and plain on the palate. Bells makes a bunch of great beers, and this isn't one of them. This is honestly one of the most boring pale ales I've had in a while."
"Verdict: Not even Bell's can win 'em all. Unfortunately, this beer requires a good deal of work, adding some hop presence plus some other complementary flavor to round out that malt dominance. I was not fond of it. C- (2.6)"
"Overall I'm not sure that I'd be jazzed to drink this one again. Flavor profile just seems flat and unexciting. I've had better pales. Though, I'm thankful for the opportunity to drink it as Bell's doesn't come to Maryland."
"This beer is just kinda eh. Not terrible but nothing special."
"D - Not what I expected from Bells; for a blonde ale I thought this would have a more profound taste and scent of blonde ale spices and flavors; overall I would pass"
"M&D- A very easy drinker. Very light and is smooth on the tongue. The carbonation gives a bit of a bite at the end."
"D: This beer is average. I am more geared toward the American style PA's out there, and this one is more British in tone. I would guide anyone interested in ESB's to give this one a go."
"An okay beer but not much more."
"I actually liked this beer better before I poured one into a glass to review. It is a pale cloudy straw yellow, with lots of ""stuff"" floating around in it. Unfiltered? It pours with a small head and not much lacing. The smell is mildly hoppy...nothing too impressive. I do, however like the taste...above average, but not spectacular. A mild, pleasant hoppy taste, with some grapefruit, lemon, and grassiness. Mouthfeel is light and pleasant. Drinkability is good. This would be a good summer beer to have after mowing the lawn. I wouldn't seek it out, but I wouldn't turn it down. Above average."
"Pours a pretty golden color with tons of sediment floating around with a thick white head and a fair amount of lacing. Smells of hops and citrus. Tastes of oranges and floral and bitter hops. Mouthfeel is medium with a thick carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"Poured a yellow hue filled with hundreds of white specs. I'm not sure if this is a bottle conditioned beer, but even if it is the white specs suspended in the beer were not typical sediment found in bottle conditioned beers. Very little aroma other than skunk. Tastes very skunky with some hops flavor. Light mouthfeel, drinkable because its light, but not so much because it is skunked and generally not good."
"Slightly hazy gold colour with a thin white cap - more of a collar with a single layer of bubbles coating the surface of the beer. Decent head retention, some lacing. Floral and grapefruit hop aroma, plus biscuity malt and a hint of hop spice. Nicely balanced flavour, weighted more to hop flavour and bitterness yet still possessing a malt presence. Bitterness was apparent throughout, biscuity malts were prominent up front, then grapefruit took over and lingered in the finish. Medium bodied with moderate, smooth carbonation that was still somewhat crisp, off-dry, nice texture for a pale ale. I enjoyed this quite a bit and thought it was pretty tasty. Easy drinking and well balanced."
"M Light, refreshing"
"D- Very drinkable with the ultra inviting nose make it easy to revisit"
"Quite easy too drink. a good session beer"
"This is....interesting to say the least. I was skeptical at first, but this definitely grew on me. I would definitely buy this again."
"Overall this was a pretty good beer, bell's sure knows what their doing."
"This poured a nice light gold color with a 2-finger white head with good retention that left just a little bit of lacing as it fell. You can also see a lot of yeast particles floating around. The smell is that of citrus and hops. there is also some sweet malt character that shines through. This is a very delicate pale ale. The hops and malt are present, but neither of them are too strong. It is very balanced and nice. There are also good citrus notes. The mouthfeel is great. Medium body with good carbonation. The hop taste lasts on the tongue after each sip. This beer is very drinkable. I can put a lot of these down very easily. This was the first beer I had ever had by Bells and I don't think it ever gets old. Very good APA. Good Job Bells. Cheers."
"A good beer, recommended for what it is which is simple pale ale (or even a blonde ale, depends on how you want to look at it). Not my favorite Bell's beer by any means."
"D - Very herbal and dry with a good dose of dry, toasty malt that verges on acrid. The hops are a bit on the musty side for an American pale ale, but the bitterness is on the mark. Not bad, but there a lot of superior examples of this style out there and I can't see a reason to pick this over any of the beers that one would expect to be available alongside of it."
"A poor product from Bell's that should be skipped."
"This reminds me more of a regular lager than an APA. It's a drinkable beer, and completely inoffensive....but if people reach for this expecting what's typically in an APA, they're sorely mistaken."
"Pours with a thick dense white head that remains. The aroma is of pine and citrus no distinct hop nose but plenty of grains. It is a beautiful golden color and clearly unfiltered. The taste starts with a malt sweet taste and finishes quickly with a slight bitterness and a maltyness. The mouth is smooth and never harsh and it is easy to drink a slightly better then average but only slightly pale ale."
"This beer has a nice golden amber color though I was put off by the yeast and floaters. Not that this was bad or changed the taste or overall quality of the beer, but it did not add to the flavor and was not expected when poured into the glass. The head dissipated quickly but left some lacing. The smell was not remarkable but was nice and pleasant with aromas of citrus possibly lemons? The taste of the beer was well balanced but lacked zip. Overall the mouthfeel and was unremarkable. This was a nice beer that was drinkable and had good overall drinkability."
"D- It dosn't make me want to drink another one just like it. But for a blonde ale it's an ok beer, but i have had better."
"D- An interesting flavour profile which is very refreshing. Light body and its higher carbonation help making this a lovely summer refresher."
"D-This is a very drinkable beer.Bell's consistently cranks out phenomenal beer after phenomenal beer.This beer pales(no pun intended)in comparison to the rest of the Bell's lineup.It is a decent,drinkable,unassuming beer."
"Overall- A solid pale ale. Completely opposite of the current trend in American pale ales which seem to be fairly aggressive and hoppy. I'm surprised because Dale's Pale Ale is one of my favorites and its completely different than this beer."
"An ok beer but nothing worth seeking."
"(22nd)"
"Drinkability is low, as I don't care if I have another one of these unremarkable beers,."
"D_Great session beer. Simple flavor and easy to drink."
"Cloudy bright orange in hue with frothy white head. A sweet aroma of sour apples, light fruit, and light floral. A slightly-off tasting pale ale of hops, citrus notes, grains, and orange rind. Prickly carbonation in the mouthfeel of this medium-bodied brew."
"Drinks about average or a little better. Honestly, it ain't bad at all. I'm looking forward to another one. Not fantastic tho. Better pale ales exist in the $10 and under price range, but this one is still quite drinkable."
"D: ABV is low, but this one is a pedestrian effort from a great brewery. Admittedly, I bought this bottle from a sale rack at a local Whole Foods store and it was probably not as fresh as it could have been. To be fair, I'll try this one again in the future and maybe I'll change my opinion then. This pale ale doesn't resemble it's big brother, ""Two-hearted Ale", in any way."
"Overall/notes - Kind of disappointed, to be honest. Bell's Two-Hearted is so fantastic that I had way too lofty of expectations. That being said, this beer just feels too light for an APA. It's got all of the basic elements, but none of the daring that it takes to make a really good beer. I'll give it a second try in the near future just to confirm."
"DB- I would say the bitterness takes away from the flavor and feel of this one. If it was a bit less bitter I would enjoy it more overall. Some nice flavors but nothing makes this one stand out."
"D - this is not a bad pale ale, but I have certainly had better. I definitely go with a different Bell's product next time I purchase something from them."
"D:Nothing great but still a decent entry level brew from Bells. Was thinking it was going to have a little more impact far as the floral and flavor goes."
"Overall I just wasn't a fan of this beer - the buttery notes were a bit over the top for me, especially as the beer warmed."
"This really isn't very good; not at all interesting or captivating. By the end it's pretty bland. More or less forgettable. Maybe it's an old bottle (no code printed on it). A rare miss for Bell's."
"Draft. Stopped in the brewery and had a little sampler of several beers. Clear golden amber color with a white head. Slight pine/citrus notes in the nose. Very nondescript taste. Straight forward and clean. Crisp and bitter ending. Med/light mouthfeel. Very easy drinking."
"Overall the beers after-bite is its strongest, or most pronounced, feature, although its looks are good, too. Light body makes it easy to drink"
"Drinkability - This is really a decent brew. Perfect spring and summer brew. I'll give this another go before summer ends for sure."
"Drinkability: The brew is drinkable, but not very memorable. I would not seek this one out by any means. There are so many better APAs out there that are much more enjoyable. Thank goodness for mixed bottle 6-packs."
"drinkability is good however there are fall too many beers i would drink over this at the price"
"Dissapointing offering from Bells."
"D: Absolutely one of the easiest drinking craft beers I have ever had!"
"The beer pours a radiant orange-yellow, cloudy due to a ton of suspended yeasties (not that that's necessarily a bad thing). The white head initially swells up to about a finger's worth, but retention and lacing are both a little weak. The aroma is of citrus american hops, but not as pungent as I would expect from an american pale ale. There's also a prominent pale malt sweetness in the nose. The taste is a carbon copy of the nose, orange and lemon zest at the close along with an upfront sweetness that reminds me of a belgian pale ale. A brief crack of hop bitterness falls in between the two and is a welcome addition. Body is appropriately light, almost surprisingly so for the amount of malty flavor this beer has, and the carbonation is medium and does a good job of emphasizing the hops while not becoming too fizzy. The solid taste, restrained hop presence, and great mouthfeel make this an extremely easy drinking beer. A great effort from Bell's."
"Hazy yellow pour with quite a bit of sediment floating. Quickly fading head and minimal lacing. Lots of grass in the nose and not much else. It has an odd almost sourness in the taste. And again, lots of grassiness with very little else going on. You begin to taste a little sweet maltiness and just a touch of citrus, but nothing great. It has a nice crisp, dry finish and good carbonation. This was very surprising and disappointing to have a beer this bad come from a brewery that's typically top notch."
"Drinkability: Its pretty hoppy, but overall, just an OK pale ale. Biggest letdown from Bells which is otherwise a fantastic brewery."
"2nd try: Now this is more like it! This one was only bottled a couple months ago, so a lot fresher than the one I had before. The appearance is about the same. The nose has a good amount of hops to it, along with some sweet scents...possibly honey or floral notes. Very subtle, but nice. The taste is like ten times better than the last one I had. No sourness/tartness this time around. And the hops are definitely in the house this time! I get lovely hops that are not too bitter with a very nice balance of sweetness. This is a very pleasant pale ale. I also get a bit or orange and honey as well. The mouthfeel is still light, but much more body to it than the old one. Drinkability is EXTREMELY HIGH on this beer."
"Drinkability- Would not drink this again try it once and be done with it"
"Bottom line: if you are looking for some sort of miniature version of Two Hearted, then look elsewhere. Bell's Pale Ale is shockingly bad."
"D: Sessioner for sure."
"this is not one of my favorite Bell's it poured amber with a small head. It had many suspended particles in the beer. It tasted bitter with a strong note of hops. smelled flat, like beer, just no real noticeable smell. The taste was much the same with not a ton of flavor. Overall, it was not bad, just something I don't need to rush and get right away."
"D. Maybe it's because I expect more from a Bell's beer, but I'm pretty disappointed with this one. The flavor isn't quite satisfying and the carbonation level is too high."
"D: Very drinkable and pretty light. I may have expected more in an APA."
"Overall it was an OK beer. I prefer a more noticeable hop presence in an APA, and compared to say Sierra's Pale ale this one doesn't compare favorably. Like I said though I'm sure it has it's place and could be enjoyed by a lot of people that prefer this style of beer."
"A good beer. I little rough around the edges though. Nothing all that special, but I will have no problem finishing the six pack. Worth a try."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with tons of suspended particles in it. Not the best start for the pour, with it looking like a snow globe and all.. Head is nice and white. Smell is sugary and grapefruity. First taste is ALL grapefruit and sour and melony. Pretty nasty, in fact. Finish is quick, dry, and bitter. After sampling Two Hearted Ale, this beer was a supreme disappointment. I'm glad I only bought a single."
"Notes - Good mouthfeel. I like this beer and suspect I'll rate it higher than the average."
"D - Quite drinkable, can definitely do a few of these summery/bbq beers."
"d - an overall decent beer, but not something i'll rush out to get more of."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a ""yeasty"" white head. Aroma had a malty buttery smell to it. Taste was initially like malts and biscuits, but the hops quickly killed that flavor. Only thing left was a watery hoppy taste. Decent body in terms of thickness and carbonation, although a bit thin in my opinion. Drinkable, but a lot of other better beer out there. Quite disappointing considering Bell's puts out a lot of good beers."
"D-It's pretty drinkable...but pretty forgettable. A good gateway beer for those looking to convert macro drinking buddies. I was pretty dissapointed drinking this after the Two Hearted...really should have done this one first."
"Bell's Pale Ale poured a golden color, with a smaller head. It smelt a bit lighter but kinda of hoppy as well. It had a lighter blonde ale taste that was a bit hoppy, it wasnt too difficult to drink, I am just unsure if I would want another one because the taste wasnt any speical. Overall it proably should not have been labeled a pale ale."
"pretty drinkable, but there are a number of better pale ales out there. bells usually makes some pretty good beer, but this is clearly one of their weakest of their offerings. i could see this being a good crossover beer for people who usually drink bud/miller/pbr."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was citrusy smelling. The beer poured a nice frothy head. The brew was a little hoppy smelling and a little hoppy tasting. This beer to me also was a little too bitter. I like Be'll's beers but I guess I will not revisit this again."
"Highly sessionable APA."
"D: Not bad, pretty good, rather bold example of the style."
"D: sessionable. nice flavor for this abv."
"D - Easy drinking. Flavors are not overwhelming, well integrated. Carbonation can be a bit filling. ABV is manageable."
"D: It doesn't have a ton of flavor to speak of, but it does drink rather easily. There's no way this is an APA though, it's a blonde ale."
"Overall, not one of my go to pale ales. Has some english tasting influences. Hops don't quite come through as one would expect from Bell's."
"A good example of what an IPA is capable of, without becoming an extreme version of the genre."
"Easy drinking and fairly enjoyable. Would have again."
"I have been sampling numerous Bell's brews lately and it seems that they play it safe on alot of their beers. I guess I would rather have them err on the side of caution then brew something over the top conversation piece beer."
"This is probably my least favorite of the Bell's beers I have had thus far. For the price, there are other beers I would rather drink. (Although I did get this 6-pack on sale for 7.99!)"
"Overall impression: Can't recommend this one. Old/bad bottle? No dating on the bottle."
"D: Nothing I will ever seek out again, there are far better APA's out there."
"(Edit to review 1/30/10- I just finished the sixer last night and I must say this beer was better today. I must have had a bad day when I first reviewed this beer. I re-rated accordingly.)"
"From a review below, I don't think I ever saw yeast sediment floating in a glass like this before. It looks like a snow globe!"
"D: one was enough for me, would not buy again. there are far superior selections of this style."
"D - Very drinkable. Near perfection in drinkability to be exact, this is a well-rounded, delicious beer which would work well for any occasion. I believe a six-pack may be in order."
"Very drinkable and quite nice."
"The drying effect makes it hard to resist another sip. I have never had an unfiltered pale ale like this before and the yeast added a nice touch to all aspects of the brew. A solid pale ale that is slightly unique yet still a classic example of the style."
"Poured into a pint glass, this left about 1/2"" of white head. Left some lacing. Appearance is light yellow with lots of sedimentation. The sediment floats in the glass for the whole time, kinda like it's a homebrew. Smell is faint floral and mildly hoppy. Taste is the same, there's a good mild hop taste. A very good example of the pale ale taste. Carbonation is right for the style. Drinkability is right up there."
"Bell's Pale Ale from Bell's Brewery pours a light amber blonde in my pint glass. Smells like a typical APA. Not much foam or lacing on the glass. Taste is really the best thing going on here. Hops and malt with a touch of citrus make for a refreshing beer. I especially like the yeasty-ness at the bottom of the bottle. I always make sure to ""do the swril"" in order to get all the flavor from my bottle. A very sessionable beer."
"Drinkability the soapy aftertaste is very off putting but even with that it is quite refreshing... will need to revisit"
"D- The light body is easy to drink but the lack of any flavor will keep me from purchasing this one again. While this beer is not necessarily offensive, it sure isn't anything special either. For the price I think I would have rather had 12 Grain Belts."
"Uh...this is a Bell's beer? I would've guessed Magic Hat in a blindfolded taste taste, and this is probably on the same level as MH's own #9--drinkable, nothing terribly wrong, but leaning a little too much toward ho-hum. Probably my least-favorite beer from the usually awesome Bell's. Next!!!..."
"Pours a hefe like orange color with a two finger head. Has a nice hoppy aroma to it, more of an oily hop smell than anything else. Taste is solid, a textbook ale, a dryness to it aswell as a smooth easy drinking body. It could use a little more malt to it to balance the hops, but that's just my opinion, overall a good beer"
"D- Pretty easy to drink, but also pretty one note with the taste. If there was a bit more bitterness going on I think I might be into it."
"Sloshing the beer around and first drink, it becomes immediately apparent that the beauty of the beer itself does not make up enough for the undistinguished flavor. Most points on this one come from look and perceived texture, however there is a nice bite and it's definitely drinkable, just not for the price. I'll keep searching..."
"D: On the whole, a drinkable beer. Not the best pale ale ever, but worth a go."
"D - refreshing"
"D: I get the feeling people are reviewing this as an IPA, which is sad. This is a great beer in a broad category. I would definitely have another."
"MF&D - crisp carbonation with a light medium body. carbonation makes the brew quite chewy and mouthcoating, and is perhaps the one redeemable feature to the beer. the drinkablilty is low beacuse the beer is a poor representative of its style and moreover not very good."
"D: Drinkable? Sure. Memorable? No. Worth a try I suppose, but Bells has many other offerings that are much more appealing."
"Guess drinkability would be ok. Several of these would be no problem, but why would you want to?"
"Drinkability: Very nice APA overall that is a little unique due to the color and spiciness. I was pleasantly surprised by this, as I do not seem to be a big fan of lower abv beers (6% or less) from Bell's."
"A light grassy hay taste followed by a slight amount of hop bitterness in the middle before settling on the weak and only somewhat sweet and present malt character. Maybe trying to leave some sediment behind this time damaged the flavor because I feel like this APA has been better in the past, when I disregarded whether or not the sediment was floating around. This has a bit of a macro taste, but like the BMC has been mixed with a Dales or SN APA. Either way not terrible, but not as amazing as I remember."
"Worth a try I suppose, but the worst offering from Bell's I've had yet, which doesn't say too much"
"Cheers!!!"
"Drinkability: It was pretty good, although I have to admit, the ""floaters"" kind of turned me off to this brew."
"tastes like your average pale ale, feel like your average pale ale, and drinks like... you guessed it, an average pale ale. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad, but it definitely gets lost among the rest of the world and would not raise my interest"
"The reviews were off-putting but I enjoyed this beer thoroughly (much more so than the amber ale)."
"Pours a murky peach body with a white head that leaves good lacing. Aromas are sweet maltiness with little hop character. Slightly lemon and funky in the nose. The flavors are sweet malt with a lemon grassy hop finish that is not bitter or really sweet. The hops aren't quite up to par for the style. Light to medium body with lower carbonation. Decent drinkability, but not a ton or character."
"D: This is an odd beer for the style... normally I could care less as long as its good but this beer seems to have actual brewing flaws. I am positive the boys at bell's know what they're doing but the grainy astringency kind of overshadows the whole beer and it tastes oversparged. I don't know, you be the judge"
"MF is medium and is kind of laborious to drink , but can be enjoyed very much sip by sip. drink is as well in the middle it leaves a wet finish , but is still enjoyable with a meal not eant to be drank by the 6 pack so take it easy on this one and it'll treat you right"
"Sweet bready malt on the palate, with moderate floral hop notes. Sweet, sugary caramel throughout alongside a light spice quality and a (berry?) fruitiness. Medium bodied with a bit of stickiness. Fine overall, but probably my least favorite Bell's to date."
"Well balanced and fairly drinkable. The yeasty, bread like taste is not my favorite though. It was definitely not what I would expect from an APA. Hops are barely noticeable."
"Cheers!"
"Would make a decent session beer, I expected quite a bit more. I've enjoyed everything I've had from Bell's, but this might be the exception."
"Overall, nothing to blow your socks off, but would make an o.k. session beer"
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a nice blond color with a little head. Aroma of citrus and some light honey. Very crisp to the taste with more citrus and some light caramel and toffee with a decent hop bite to it. Finishes clean and slightly dry. Very good session beer and I wish bells would start distributing in Tx."
"Very drinkable and one that I would like to have again. A very fresh tasting beer. A good session brew."
"This beer can't hold a candle to its big brothers, but then again, those are HUGE shoes to fill."
"The beer was, again a little lighter than expected, but still, it had good carbonation to it, smooth, clean and good drinkability."
"Overall, a different type of pale ale that was pretty well done overall. I would reccommend this as a good session pale ale."
"Clearish yellow color and thin head. Smell is reminiscent of bud light, with a touch more complexity. Citrus malts with sharp tang on the nose and on the tongue. Not particularly drinkable and the finish isn't smooth or refreshing, but the citrus and fruity flavors carry through to the end."
"3.5 D: If you're in the mood for a grainy witbier this is it. If you're in the mood for an APA, look somewhere else."
"Aroma is malty, weak, not very impressive. It pours a typical clear golden amber with a few little goobers in it - those don't bother me, though. Flavor, fortunately, is stronger than the aroma - mainly malty, with a metallic tone. Not great, but potable. Texture is fizzy and fairly smooth."
"Drinkability: A decent, drinkable pale ale that provides something a bit different, both in terms of malts and hops used, than many American-made APAs. To say nothing of the sea monkeys! Though enough talk of the Pale Ale -- pass the Kalamazoo Stout already!"
"Overall a very tasty, simple and quaffable pale ale."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of head that quickly left with little lacing. Faint hop and malt smells. It tastes like an an without bitter hops. This is kind of a let down considering some other fine brews they offer. I guess I could pound this like a macro since it doesn't have a lot of flavor. Not one of Bells better offerings."
"It seems very drinkable, but that might be because I have been craving a pale ale all day. Overall it is clean and refreshing. I think I will have another."
"Notes: This is superior to SNPA."
"D - Extremely drinkable, but not the best example of the style. Pretty standard example."
"Bell's has tons of better brews, but this is a pretty solid beer that is a bit mislabeled. Still very drinkable."
"decent pale ale...a bit dry...easy drinker"
" ~ I'm a big fan of this brew. I could kick back with a six pack and a Brewers game while enjoy a nice evening on the porch, no doubt!"
"It's a beautiful beer that I find eminently drinkable... from bottle or from the glass. I'd recommend the glass because of how nice every aspect of this beer looks. If you can get over the lack of good aroma and the slight metallic tinge it has, this would be a very enjoyable pale ale for you."
"I'm generally not too impressed with this beer, be it an APA or a blonde. Not enough flavor or hops to make it memorable at all."
"D: Quite sessionable. While not the best APA out there, certainly a decent offering when looking to kill some time on the beach, and want a little more hops than Oberon has to offer."
"Pours a pale amber gold with a frothy, slightly effervescent pearl head. Thin lacing remains and a misty overall appearance. The aroma is grainy/grassy with mild spicy hop notes. Some citrus resin as well. Citrus and a spicy herbal flavor basically characterizes this one. Some husky grain and mild yeast notes. Bright with some metallic character. Moderate carbonation and a semi-dry finish. A nice go-to when little else is available but a middle-of-the-road pale ale at best. Enjoyable but not remarkable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied and easy to drink. The carbonations is also very light and smooth."
"Drinkability - This would be good on a hot summer day. Light and refreshing, but not remarkable."
"Eminently drinkable and utterly forgettable... no real off or bad flavors, but lacking in character."
"Aroma is a bit odd musty funk of orange, citrus and malt - which leads right into the quaff. Rather earthy pale ale, dry and woody finish. Not the best pale I've ever had, and really not worth the almost $10 a sixer price. Bell's makes (overall) good beers, but they seem to be overpriced to me."
"Drinkable enough, but lacking any outstanding character for a classic APA, and not tasting too fresh either."
"Mouthfeel: I'd lay off the carbonation with this beer. Felt it was overcarbonated for this style. I'd love to try this on cast sometime."
"good mouthfeel. a bit bubbly. good drinkability because it is so mild."
"D- It's not bad."
"taste is rather weak. not much to speak of. very thin on the feel, slight hop presence, not much malt and a slight bitter finish."
"Lighter bodied, not big on carbonation. It's drinkable but not what I am after in an APA."
"this is a blonde pale ale and pours as such with a1 inch head and grat lacing..its very nice.. the smell is different it is a spicy herb/hop smell with citrus undertones and sweet malt finish very good..the taste is the same its a spicy bitter but great great flavor different from most pale ales.. the mouth feel is hops spicy bitter malt floral just delicious its very good... this is one of my favorite pale ales..bells just makes great ales period an A for this one i recommend it"
"Solid American Pale Ale designed for easy sessioning. Relatively low alcohol, along with nice balance make this an any-time-of-day quaff, but I usually prefer bigger hops. Nice."
"Pours a golden straw (light for a pale ale) color, with a nice bit of head and a bit of lacing. Odd pale ale scent, a bit of hoppiness, but also strong aromas that are usually associated with lagers and with wheat ales. The taste has some nice floral hints, but there's a strong witbier spiciness to it as well, with a peppery aftertaste. Goes down fine, although not particularly smooth. This just seems like a bit of a mish-mash beer."
"mid body beer. good carbonation. i like this beer. i am excited to see bells again. good unfiltered apa."
"Drinkability: A very nice pale ale, one of the better examples of the style. A very good day-to-day beer if you can get it."
"The flavors are all over the place,but a very enjoyable session type ale or lawnmower beer."
"Bell's Pale Ale won't knock the socks off, but it's solid, smooth, tasty beer. It went great with the grilled mozzarella and turkey sandwich, with a kosher dill on the side. Quite good."
"Pours a murky, light gold in color. Whatever head formed on the pour is quickly gone and leaves some nice webby lacing. Some very, very faint hops in the nose. Not too much to get excited about there. Very crisp, with more hop flavor coming through in the taste. That's more like it. Clean and well crafted."
"D - Not too bad, I could drink a few..."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a thin foamy off-white head that quickly fades without any lacing. Bland aroma consisting of subtle citrus hops and slight maltiness. Malty with floral hop flavor and bitter sweet citrus hop aftertaste. Slightly dry finish."
"D-Decent drinkability. It's quite different than most of the ""typical"" APAs. However, it certainly has its merits within its differences. This brew is quite a bit more refreshing than many other APAs."
"Taste: Floral flavor with a citrus peel hop taste. Bitter aftertaste. Definitely a great pale ale."
"D-This would be a good session beer.Maybe a little light on the hop flavor for the style but would make a great intro to the APA/PALE ALE style."
"Pours a very cloudy, fizzy, yellow/slight orangish color, big white head, medium sized bubbles, lasting, creamy. Somewhat sweet, malty aroma, medium strength. Malty, balanced by the hops, taste. Sweet, fizzy, somewhat hoppy aftertaste. Tastes a little more IPAish than Pale Ale."
"Pours a very cloudy orange with TONS of massive flecks of yeast and a medium white head. Aromas are somewhat subdued, but I pick up bready malts with a zesty orange smell. Taste is interesting. It's hoppy in a citrusy way with fruity malts making less of an appearance than my palate was hoping. It's too bitter and too chewy to be sold as ""Pale Ale"" in my opinion. Kudos for defying expectations but I hope that they make this beer more balanced in the future."
""
"D: Not the best pale ale out there, but one I would probably drink again. I think this would be a fun beer to drink in warmer weather."
"D - Fair. It grows on me as I drink, but I'm not sure it would ever be a standby for me."
"You need to be careful to make sure you don't get some outdated bottles. If there is dust on them, beware. When this beer gets old it is not enjoyable."
"This isn't a horrible beer, but not a stand out choice."
"Not your standard run of the mill American Pale Ale. It's limited drinkability makes this a beer I will not go back to in the future."
"D - it's ok, but there other beers of this style I would grab before this."
"Nikki"
"In the end, this was a nice crispy and citrusy Pale Ale. Session beer? Only if you like low ABV% citrusy Pale Ales. For me, I could probably go for another one."
"Light bodied, pretty high carbonation. I truthfully was a little disappointed with this beer, I expected better from Bell's. There are far better options available for this style of beer. While it is pretty drinkable, I can't see me picking anymore of these up."
"Overall - Very light and refreshing brew. It has fairly thin body but still manages to satisfy."
"Goes down nice, but left me feeling totally underwhelmed and lacking. Not worth $7.99/sixer, that's for sure."
"Notes: I know it says ""Pale Ale", but this is a Blond, like it or not. Also, for what it's worth, this is an awful lot better on tap."
"A thin carbonated mouthfeel, overall a good blond/pale ale."
"Notes from 8/29/07"
"Not a bad APA even though it's claim is a blonde. If that's the case, this is the meatiest blonde ale I've ever had. I enjoyed this, but was a little turned off on the chunkiness. I need to filter this in the future. I'd get it again."
"D- more like a well malted pilsener with some ale complexities, this one seems a little strange to me. though guidelines are just that-- this is a decent brew, but adhering to the APA category, this one falls way under expectations. perhaps bells could be less rebellious and rename this APA as a hopped up blond, wherein i would have gratefully given it a better review."
"poured a fizzy orange yellow color with a huge head of lite fizzy white foam that runs away scared real fast. the taste dosent impress me, a tad of sour malts up frount then the bitter takes over, this is not good in any way, the hops taste like thay were harvested to early and are to green, thay taste wet. the bitter sitcks with you after the sip is gone and lingers in the back of my throat. this is a beer i had to slam and get a difrent beer, i am not in a hurry to try this one agan"
"I may be coming down with a cold so I'm not sure my nostril's were all in on this one. Otherwise, not bad at all. I will definitely try it again."
"Drinkability takes hits from the dryness of the beer and the price. An interestingly spicy take on the style, though, and props for the brew nailing the stated description on the label."
"D - This is a very easy-drinking pale ale. I jus wish Bell's wasn't so pricy."
"The nose on the beer is slightly hoppy mostly malts. The beer is golden in colour with a good inch head. Good retention. A lot of carbonation and some sediment in the beer. There beer is pretty bitter with a nice fruity malt character. Nice and creamy mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable."
"D- I could have a few more but this beer just isn't anything too exciting, I will try other pale ales before buying this one again."
"Could use more balance, perhaps a little less hop and a little more malt, which would in turn improve drinkability that should be better for the style. Still, an enjoyable beer."
"Thanks to Unionturf for this sample off of my wants list. Very cool indeed."
"Nothing too spectacular about this. One of my least favorites from Bell's."
"I really like this and I think that it is a great pale ale, but I have been experimenting more with the IPAs lately and this is just to ""regular"" for me. Overall, a definite must try!"
"D- Bell's for me has been kind of hit and miss. I think this one is a miss for me. Not terrible and worth a try for sure. Just not my cup of beer."
"Drinkable but not the best example of this catagory."
"I enjoyed this one. Different from most other Pale Ales I've had. This is a little lighter and more citrusy, making it very refreshing and ideal for the summer. Orange color, thin head and some spotty lacing. Aroma is floral, fruity with malts. The flavor is citrus orange, sweet malts, quite wheaty with faint spicy hops in the background and more towards the finish of the beer. Nice."
"Drinkability: A thoroughly unexceptional pale ale - hits many of the right notes while missing a lot of the better ones. Could use more hops, more of a malt profile, or both. Just, more of something!"
"A golden color with hints of amber, strong visibility of carbonation in the glass. A quater inch, white in color head forms, then dissolving to a film on top. A yeasty bread aroma at first scent, this is followed by a grassy, grapefruit fragrance that dominates most of the aroma. The bread flavor comes out at the front, at the halfway point grapefruit and earthy flavors take over, and stays there for sometime. A thin to medium bodied feel, with the cleansing feel of carbonation at the end. A solid pale ale, fairly evenly balanced beer in flavor and aroma."
"D: Easy to drink, pleasant ABV. A good selection for an evening with fresh grilled burgers and corn on the patio!"
"D- an unimpressive offering from bells. ill probably never seek this one out again. glad to have tried it, but there are several better offerings than this one."
"I don't care for this one all that much. I'll pass it up on the shelf, but I wouldn't refuse one if it were offered."
"Tastes biscuity malty with noticable hop flavor and some hop bitter. Very strong hop aromatics rising retronasal. Yeasty and mild peppery zip. Some orange from hops with mild esters (peach and pear). Md body with mild/fine, but stingy carbonation. Drying aftertaste is a bit sour/acrid from the carbonation and a drying hop-grassy roughness. Overall...this beer is meh."
"This is not a bad pale ale, though not one of Bell's best offerings."
"Drinkabilty: Easy drinking pale ale. Seems to focus on the classic pale ale formula and even looks the color. I feel there could be more flavor to the malt but if I could find this more often, I'd probably buy it again. It really is easy to drink and average/good for the style."
"Good beer, the only drawback is the dry hopping, which takes the front. Dry hops should be aroma hops, but these seem to come through on the flavor."
"Be that as it may, this is an interesting beer worth trying. It's complex and interesting, and it's delicious. This would be a great session beer, IMO. If you generally like what Bell's does, you'll probably like this one too."
"D - this could be an easy drinker if there wasn't any other options."
"This is more of a halfway point between a golden ale and a pale ale with that less distinct (but definitely present) hoppiness. As long as you don't go in looking for a hop-bomb, I think you'll find this quite enjoyable. It would be a great transition into the world of pale ales if someone was unfamiliar with them."
"I am becoming a big Bell's fan, I wonder how good this would be on tap or cast? Next are the Bells stouts...next weekend. :)"
"Outstanding drinkability."
"Pours a glowing golden amber with a fluffy white head. Spotty lacing and steady carbonation. Smell is pretty good but nothing more than that. Kind of a peppery biscuit with underlying floral bitterness. Taste is an improvement on this. Not so bitter as I had the impression it would be. A nice clean hop profile with some pale malts. Grassy, earthy, peppery, and floral with the biscuity and somewhat grainy flavor in the background and finish. Crisp, clean, and refreshing. About all you could ask for in a beer such as this. I liked it for being a solid example of the style, though it didn't stand out from some of my favorites."
"Overall, a very good pale ale. This is one of those beers that I could just drink all day."
"I'm not very impressed with this offering from Bell's. I found this pale ale to be very bland - nothing really stuck out in the taste or smell of the beer. It's drinkable, but nothing about the beer left me looking forward to another. It doesn't really have a poor taste or anything, but it's mostly grainy-dominant from start to finish with a little bit of a vague bitterness."
"Drinkability: Easily drinkable, but not remarkable enough to warrant many of them."
"overall, this is a very nice tasty brew"
"This was my one disappointment last night @ Bell's. It poured a very light with no cloudiness. The smell was nearly non-existant. Then on to the flavor.... to my disappointment that was non-existant as well. Now I am a HUGE Pale Ale fan and this one definitely needs more flavor. This reminded me more of a summer ale or golden Ale, too mellow for a pale ale in my opinion. The mouthfeel was ok and its something I could drink a bunch of but for a pale ale it was lacking."
"It pours a very cloudy ornage color with a pretty good head on it and very little retention. The smell really is the best thing this brew has to offer as it is very floral with the rich smell of hops and citrus, the taste is really a step back from teh nose it satarts off really well with the hops commming through nicely but fades quite disaponitingly into just a bitter finish without much to be said, carbonation level is good but with all the APA's out there i couldnt see me hitting this one if i had many other options."
"This is very easy to drink, and a wonderful session beer. Flavorful without being over the top or imbalanced."
"A nice looking ale. Golden in color with a slight cloudy appearance. A white head sits atop the beer and has good retention. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Has a bready and slightly grassy aroma. Malty taste with some spicy hops lingering in the background. Light body with somewhat harsh carbonation. I like the beer and it drinks easy but it is overpriced for a pale ale."
"D_A lively and yeasty pale ale. While it doesnt look like the style indicates it does sort of drink like an English Sierra Nevada to some extent. I would venture that it is tasty and drinkable but really doesn tfit a particular category"
"Usually I tend to pass up this style, and end up going for their hoppier cousin, IPA. Time to get back to basics, with a straight up Pale Ale from a very respectable brewery. Pours a golden orange color, with a white heading (very close in look to the Oberon sans the cloudiness). Smell is everything I would expect from a Pale Ale, with hints of biscuit, grain, bits of fruit...dry overall character. Taste is very much on par with the aroma, with a decent amount of hops to keep things interesting. Carbonation is just about right for this style, lending itself to dry and sweet aspects of this beer collectively. Body is medium, well balanced, and very drinkable. Very nice to visit this style again after a long sabbatical. Thanks again to Jess for the opportunity."
"Overall an easy drinking beer."
"A fairly bland beer overall that's more British in style than American. Middle of the road and not that memorable. Not bad but nothing special here."
"drinkability is good. this is a hoppy brew with a good quality and concentration, without over doing it. cheers!"
"Carbonation is medium and the mouthfeel is light and pleasant. Very drinkable."
"D- It had a full, but clean, flavor that makes downing more than 1 pretty easy."
"Eric"
"D: An easy drinking session brew.. a little simple in the taste dept. for bells"
"Medium body, light carbonation, very smooth - velvety. There is no overpowering flavor or turn offs. This is a pretty well-balanced beverage and a great session beer."
"Enjoyed in a pint glass. Color is deep gold to light amber. Nice foamy white head. Pleasant pale malt aroma with a good dose of piney hops. Flavor is nice and malty with notes of citrus and spices. Finish is a lingering bitterness. Or is it the sweetness that lingers? It's both. Nicely balanced and very refreshing. Subtle carbonation makes for a nice mouthfeel. An easy drinker."
"Poured a light copper with a small head that dispersed quickly and seemed moderately carbonated. Smells hoppy and fruity. The mouthfeel is bubbly and the taste is pretty good--slightly hoppy, a little citrus, and ends very smooth. I would say this is a very drinkable beer. Not my favorite Bell's (Two-Hearted, please!) but definitely noteworthy. Quite an enjoyable pale."
"First Bells beer I have been dissapointed with. Back to the Hopslam and Two Hearted."
"It's fine the way it is, however, if a touch generic."
"This poured a hazy faded gold with off-white head. It smelled like subtle lemon hops and some malt. It tasted like a typical pale ale with citrus hops and a bit of malt. It was watery with some carbonation and a slight bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a good beer, but I would still rank it below Sierra Nevada."
"Overall Impression: Blech. Just not digging this one. Not what I was expecting from an APA, or from Bell's for that matter. It's not undrinkable, but not really enjoyable either. Can't recommend this one."
"Good stuff, would make a great summertime session brew. Approachable and drinkable, somewhat simple and straightforward, yet well crafted and tasty."
"The reviews on this one are all over the place; from very good to very poor. The name most likely turns off a lot of reviewers as this is certainly a pale ale but not ""pale"" in what we normally associate with this style. To Bell's credit the back of the bottle describes this ale in fact as a ""blond ale."" This is a blonde style ale, and as such it is decent. Next time I will reach for Bell's amber ale."
"An ok APA. Not bad, but not a beer that Bell's reputation is built on."
"Overall I am not terribly impressed w/ this beer. I love APAs, however this would definitely not be my first choice. I'd rather have a SNPA, an Anchor Liberty Ale, or a Summit EPA over this. I love Bell's beer, but I'll stick w/ a Two-Hearted or a Hopslam instead."
"Cloudy orange with a medium sized whitish head. Smell is mildly hopped, with a touch of musty citrus and malt coming in. Taste is very mildly hopped, and lightly bitter. More emphasis on the malt, I thought, which was somewhat bright and citrusy sweet with hints of orange and honey. A decent pale, but short of spectacular."
"Gold with white lacing but floaties are all up and down in this beer. The aroma is a bit too mild with hints of citrus rind and spice. The Flavor is a big grapefruit and a touch of grassy, earthy spice around the edge. The bitterness fades to make this a tasty pale ale that's very drinkable. I'd like more malt in here, as there isn't much balance. There's a little biscuity malt, but hops run the show here."
"Drinkability: I just rated the Stone Pale Ale poorly, and now this one also. I hope they were bad samples, but now I'm not sure. Bell's continues to be hit or miss with me. I won't be having this again."
"Pours a cloudy orange color, with a bright white head that doesn't last long or lace much. Aromas picked up are citric hop, and a faint malt sweetness. Taste is a citric hop flavor, something like orange peel or watermelon rhine, with a sweet buttery malt behind it. Hops linger in the aftertaste, but not to the point where it dries the palate out. Light body and moderate carbonation provide a clean mouthfeel, and though there are better interpretations of the style, I could drink this all damn night if I needed to. Good beer, but the Two Hearted is much better."
"D - Decent, but I think I'd probably get bored if I drank another. Not a bad brew at all, but there are much better pales out there, and if you're going to get a sixer of Bell's anyways, they have much more interesting brews than this."
"Other: Not Exactly Impressed, Toward the End it Began to Taste Somewhat Bland. I Believe it Could Have Been a Bit Hoppier. I Respect Bells Brewing Co, but Will Stick to Oberon!"
"12 ounce bottle, Batch 8230, packaged on 11/14/07. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy golden orange color with a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. Aroma is grassy/spicy hops and bready malt. However, the aroma is on the weak side. Taste is very similar to the aroma, grassy/spicy hops, grain and bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with above average carbonation. Drinkability is OK too, but nothing special. Overall I think this is an average beer. It's not bad at all, but there's nothing that sets it apart from other beers. With that being said, I'd still drink it again in the future but I wouldn't make a point to seek this out either."
"This is a pretty harsh pale ale. It's bitter, but in the wrong way. This is a subpar Pale Ale in most ways. Try something else."
"Its no Two-Hearted."
"Pours a fully clouded golden brown. Off white head. Nose is so bland, it's basically lifeless. Flavor is a slight bit of a bitter edge over deadened citrus tones. This is an APA? It seems more to me like a bad version of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Or maybe a hybrid of the two at least. Either way it just seems to come out swinging, and misses. Feel is good on carbonation and decent on liquid. Overall it is drinkable, but I say again: this is a pale ale? Seems pretty wacky to me to be in the class of APA. Oh well. It was decent, but nothing memorable as far as the style goes. Might be better promoted as a summer brew."
"Pours orange gold with a modest layer of foam with some visible suspended yeast. Aroma by itself is weak. Any taste comparison to IPAs is unwarranted except to say this is not an IPA. The taste is bitter in a classic kind of way that reminds me of the way beer tasted in the sixties. Finish is clean and dry with light carbonation like a lager. Pleasantly drinkable."
"D- There's nothing wrong with this beer, but there's not anything special about it. Neither the malt nor the hops really scream out with flavor at me. The honey thing is interesting but quickly becomes boring."
"A little over-carbonated at first but then it settles into a smooth, easy drinking ale that screams session. An absolute pleasure to drink."
"Smell is pretty muted, but there is some hoppiness to it. Taste is also muted, american hops poking through, but barely. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good considering the muted flavors and low(ish) alcohol. I don't think i would pick this up again. The field of pale ales is a very crowded one, and there are plenty of readily available beers that are the same price and are definately better. Try it if you would like, but i would just stick to SN Pale Ale."
"D: Not my favorite Pale Ale, can't compare to burning river or alpha king, but I'm glad I tried it."
"The beer was smooth, but the mouthfeel was off for me. I had the odd sensation that it was grainy. I could literally feel bits of particles that I could chew while drinking it. Overall, an okay beer that is a step up from your macro brews, but not even close to some of the other APA's such as Sierra Nevada. I have heard so many good things about Bell's and kinda sad this is the first one that I got to true. Hopefully, the Stout's leave me more impressed."
"D = Good for easy drinking and I could also envision picking it again as a simple American Pale Ale."
"Over all, this isn't my favorite, but that's stickly opinion. If your looking for a beer that's low alcohol and flavor, then this might be your thing. But it's not mine."
"This is my first beer from Bell's and as a blond ale it's a pretty decent ale. I might buy some this summer for outdoor activities. However, the marketing for this beer gets a big F. They need to re-brand it clearly as a blond ale because that is what it is. As an APA this beer falls seriously short. I'll be grading it as a blond."
"Average from here on out. Flavor profile was weak. Grainy, bready, slightly sweet, grapefruit/tangerine hoppiness. Light bodied and watery. By far, the worst Bell's offering I have had. I would think the ""easiest"" and most popular style would have been better coming from a big brewery like this. Im starting to appreciate all the other beer out there."
"Drinkability: Good. Nice light-feeling beer, perfect for a crisp autumn day."
"I'd buy this again, but it could use some tweaking.."
"Feels slightly thin with just a little carbonation."
"D- I have had this on numerous occasions, but it hasn't really done it for me any of the times. It is very solid and little different, but there is just something not quite right. Just feels like a hoppier Oberon."
"Overall: a solid American style pale ale, above average, but nothing special, drinkable as hell. A good beer for Bell's repertoire, but I will stick to Two Hearted ale."
"This beer wasn't bad, just not among their best offerings."
"Pours murky gold with a big white head. Nice lacing. Aroma is mostly citrusy hops. Some floral notes with background sweetness. Taste is clean light malt sweetness below spicy and floral hops. Crisp. Some light fruit flavors in the finish with a light lingering bitterness. Pretty balanced. Mouthfeel is medium and fairly well carbonated. Overall this is a balanced and very drinkable APA. Not particularly exciting but very solid and sessionable."
"D: This is a very nice summer beer, crisp/sharp for a hot day. Of course it is overcast and ~60 and this is still a nice beer. I am not sure this fits the APA style but I like it. Good session beer, recommended."
"Ok now this was a good Pale Ale. Perhaps my favorite style, whether I choose to admit it or not, I was thrilled when I saw this come in a package. It had been forever since I tried a good pale that I had not had, and let alone a Bells I was stoked. Poured a nice very hazy golden amber with about two inches of white head on top. A nice slow fade gave way to copious side glass lace and a nice film across the top. You could tell it was nice due to ample carbonation consistently replenishing it. Great fresh aroma, with lots of floral hops and a good bit of grain in the back. The taste followed through pretty much the same. Great floral hop flavor hit you right away, but it was very light and refreshing, nothing overbearing about it at all. Nice underlying grain base had a touch of sweetness to it which gave it some good depth. Smooth, crisp finish with a nice lingering bitterness. Great light bodied feel and amble carbonation made it very light and refreshing and kept you wanting to come back for more. This was easily a session ale with no issues. Overall I was very impressed here. This was an awesome pale that was more the adequately hopped and really had a great profile. I would love to have this on tap in my house, it would really be something that would go well for a large gathering of friends or during a game. Highly recommended here."
"Pours a hazy, cloudy golden with a large-and-small-bubble lively carbonation, persistent with good retention and lacing. Smells of spring flowers, light spice, spearmint and peppermint. There is a really assertive hoppy taste and mouthfeel, dry and sharp. Substantial body but fairly high alcolhol seems to come through in the ginger-snappy aftertaste that is also a touch sour and takes away from the drinkability quotient. Lots of yeast on the bottom of the bottle, thanks to Merchant's in Dearborn for another treat from Michigan-based Bell's, I only wish it were a touch less sour on the finish."
"D: Getting this in Oklahoma took some work (by JSommers - thanks again Jay). Sadly, it was not worth the effort. I wanted hops & did not get them."
"Creamy and delicious on the tongue, the taste is a crisp, balanced refreshing beer that does not overwhelm with flavor, but has a nice long finish that is just bitter enough. A well made example of a flavorful blonde ale, as it says on the label. Very drinkable..the more you drink (and as it warms), the more the subtle fruit and spice notes reveal themselves."
"Pretty decent pale ale, though there are better offerings more readily available here in Chicago. Compared to others this beer isn't too grassy which isn't necessarily a plus in the taste department, but when it comes to repeat drinking, it doesn't get overpowering."
"Pours a hazy golden with sediment swirling around. Good head: offwhite, rocky, and healthy and leaves some lacing. Smells spicy and clean with some washed out grain lingering. Taste is similar. Dry and sspicy to start with clean flavors and some more of that washed grain taste. Drops off a little too quick and finishes with pepper, grain, and earthy hops. Fairly grainy and thick mouthfeel for the style. Pretty decent, but not my favorite Bell's product."
"Ive been looking foward to this beer since I bought it and I didnt dissapoint. Nice cloudy straw color with a big head from a hard pour. The smell isnt that great moslty just hops. The taste though is complex. Hops, grapefruit, sweetness, bitterness all come together to make this a great tasting beer. Nice full mouthfeel, and I cant beleive how quick I drank this glass, too bad I only bought one."
"Don't drink and review."
"A previously recorded tasting from ""up north"". Thi sbeer smells sweet and zesty. Into my trusty trapezoidal tankard the brew pours a cloudy dark yellow with a foamy two finger head. The taste is a semi-sweet start with an evenly bitter hopped finish. A nicely balanced ale. Very tasty. This is a shoe-in for a sessioner. The flavor is very pronounced yet clean. I like it. I could enjoy just about any food with this beer."
"I would not consider this an American pale ale at all, and when taken in this context it doesn't work. However, this reminds me of the hoppy pale ales (specifically Hommel) that I had near the town of Poperinge in Belgium recently this summer. It's an interesting and unique taste that is not commonly found in the States. I think this is a good, but very commonly misunderstood beer."
"D=If you like watery grapefruit, it's ok"
"D: A very textbook APA which is nice to see. Not too extreme on the bitterness or the hop flavor."
"Got this one at Brady's is Southfield, MI. This is one of the Bell's I hadn't really gone out of my way for, basically cause I always go for IPAs over PAs. However, they had it at Brady's so I went nuts. Poured a nice amber color with some lighter highlights, and a good fluffy head on top. Nose was very mild; some light orange and a touch of hops. Taste was better. Lots of orange and lemon, with nice caramel malt background as well. Solid but not-too-long aftertaste. Feel is solid, and carbonation was good. I've had a few really good Pale Ales lately, including Stone PA and the Burning River. I'll add this one to that list. Definitely one I could have a bunch of."
"D - I've had this beer many a time, and it never fails to be a good summer standard fare type beer. The price is right too."
"Light and drinkable, I suppose, but this one really didn't work for me."
"This is not a typical pale ale (though the category is broad), but definitely a beer meant for good summer drinking."
"A different pale ale for sure. I'm not sure if I could make a session of this or not. Lots of pale maltiness, yeast, and earthy hops...not really what I would call an APA per se, but it seems they were aiming for something a little different here."
"Not crazy about it, but glad I had a chance to have it. Thanks to dekker0 for including it."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, although overall it's a crisp and easy drinking brew. Carbonation is good, finish is clean and easy. Good session beer, low complexity."
"No bad aftertaste and could be a great session beer."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good representation of style, I could put away several of these, this is very good beer to stick with for an evening."
"Crisp and rich enough mouthfeel. Just not enough of this beer to base a session on it or seek it out again."
"Thanks to dogfooddog for this one!"
"Drinkability is very good, this beer is very well-balanced and perfect as a session beer."
"D: Pretty smooth other than the dryness at the end."
"m: smooth, lighter in body then other apa's but very smooth to me. i like other apas more, but this is a very good one as well"
"-Oelergud"
"Poured into a standard pint glass, this beer appears a very clear, yellow-gold color. Nice, fat head with good retention and noteworthy lace. The aroma here is very faint, despite the good sized head, with notes of wheat and open fields. Floral, but no distintive scent really jumps out. Some muted malty scents as well. The taste, however, is much more complex. Nice malty spices up front, with some faint citrus notes mixed in the middle. Finishes with a spicy bitter kick and an old leather taste. Not bad. Not bad at all. Smooth mouthfeel, but very clean. And at 5% ABV, this beer is entirely drinkable as a session beer. I would have no problem putting a keg of this in my kegerator. It's a very nice beer."
"Recommended for someone who is starting with craft beers or for the experienced craft beer drinker!"
"One other thing I'm curious about.... why do the newer Bell's labels remind me of the artwork from New Belgium? Odd..."
"Body is below medium, soft and creamy with a wheaty slickness. Could drink a bunch of these on a hot day."
"Poured a hazy wheat color with a slight head. Little to no lacing. Aroma is primarily floral hops with some mild malts, but there isn't much aroma there. Taste is floral hops with some mild malts, just like the aroma. More bitter than I would expect from an APA. Bitters make this less drinkable than other APAs. Not a bad beer, but not my idea of a good APA."
"Point # 1: Don't try to appreciate this beer too much if trying it after Bell's Hopslam. But, as time passes and I get further into this beer, I appreciate it more and more. Picking up more nuances that I missed before. Poured with an offwhite decent textured head with some lace that last. Very slightly hazy amber color. Basic american pale ale hop flavor slightly leaning to grapefruit."
"dense golden color with a thick surging head. grains and candy sweetness in the nose. gobs of grain and yeast flavors infused with blueberry, hops, merengue. unconventional, to say the least. thick in the mouth -- it's creaminess is a strange match with the flavors, but it's a good strange."
"Ya know I like this beer but its not a APA in my book.It taste nothing like any of the APA's Ive tasted.It taste more like a british beer.Good but shame on them for labeling a beer that isnt what it is."
"Bought as a single bottle. No freshness date, but I think this was a left-over from long ago."
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my Adnams Tulip pint glass. Appears a rich, slightly cloudy golden amber color with two fingers of off - white foam. Minimal lacing left on the inside of the glass. Smells faintly of apricot followed by mild, flowery hops. Tastes of sweet pale malt, followed by mildly spicy, flowery hops. Medium in both body and carbonation. Worth a try."
"D - As pale ales go, this is definitely one I can sit back and enjoy a few of."
"Pours a murky light amber with good head to begin with, good head, good lacing. Aroma is pretty stock, should have more hops to it, more of anything really. Is this a bad bottle maybe? Some fruity hops, some caramel, but I want more. Taste is fine, hops are fine, malts are fine. Really, nothing wrong with this beer, just nothing I'd have expected from Bell's. Granted, Bell's puts out a shitton of beers, and it seems they put a whole lot of effort into other works of genius, but I'd like more out of their stock pale ale. (Now, if that wasn't subjective enough for ya...)"
"Plenty of carbonation..might want to tone that down a little if it were up to me. But it does slide down rather smooth. Certainly a sessionable beer as well. Yet another Bell's brew worth trying."
"Taste is of spiced hops with a good malt balance...otherwise unremarkable and underwhelming. Feel is good; crisp and springy on the tongue, nice hoppy aftertaste. This is not the most complicated of beers, nor overly refreshing, but it's tasty and easy to drink. Have one."
"This is the first Bell's beer I tasted and enjoyed it very much. It has a golden cloudy appearance and a nice head. The aromas smelled while drinking it are citrus and the tast is citrus with a subtle hoppiness. Drank it out of a standard pint glass."
"Poured into a traditional pint glass. Beautiful golden pale orange with a frisky, fluffy white head that laces itself all over the glass and top of your remaining beer. Trademark Bell's yeasty suspension as well. The nose is partially full of light, fresh citrus aromas and dry spice. Imagine the misty aroma you get when you bend the peel of a lemon or orange. Not a whole lot of hops present in the aroma, although they are slightly detectable. There is also a slight whiff of dry malt. A light and smooth body carries, what you can tell is, a brew that has been created by a smart brewer. Light hop flavor hints of aromatic citrus fruits as mentioned above. A well balanced, and again very light, malt sweetness supports the hops and does not overpower. Finishes super clean with a nice dry, fresh husk flavor. This has got to be one of the cleanest and freshest beers I've ever tasted. One could easily have a fantastic session with this beer on a very hot summer day."
"Batch 7759. They just recently added 3 more Bell's beers to the lineup at Raleigh's Flying Saucer. Poured from a bottle a very light orange with a decent head that was mostly diminishing. Aroma was very weak. Some citrus hops trying very hard to be noticed, but barely achieving. Taste was an improvement on the aroma but still not much more than average. Good blend of mild hops and pale malt. There was a pleasant sweetness on the final sip. The peer possessed a decent carbonation and alcohol was hardly noticeable. This would be a decent session beer, likely better suited for the summer."
"Not bad, but not amazing either. The palate features a really nice malt sweetness, with a pleasant hint of honey, which, further into the sip, transitions into a nice balance of tasty grain and a fairly assertive hop spice and flavor. Not mind-blowingly rich, but its got good flavors and great drinkability. Recommended."
"Taste is broad and bitter with active, piney hop flavors that mellow and finish mostly cleanly. Rather dry for an APA. Mouthfeel isn't bad but could stand some straightening. Not a great beer but definitely a serviceable one."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, small foam white head, some islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of hops, and slight citrus. The taste is hoppy, but not what I would think of an APA, nice little bite in the finish. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad APA at all, could use more hops though."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a golden-yellow color with particulates floating throughout the beer and has a sparkling foamy white head. Smell is not overwhelming, but is of floral hops and grainy malt. The taste is neither sweet nor bitter, but is incredibly smooth and well balanced. The beer is light in body and has gentle fizzyness about it. This is an exceptionally drinkable beer, goes down very easy and could be consumed in mass quantities easily."
"($7.99 / 6-pack)"
"Nose of this beer is mostly malts with just a slight peppery hoppiness to it. Flavor is straightforward leaning heavuly on the malts but balance decently with minty hops. Slight pepper tang to the overall flavor. Kind of an orange citrus fruit thing going on as well. Medium body that is slightly oily. Bitterness lingers a bit too. Nie and drinkable. It will ecome a great choice to drink during a game."
"Easy to drink, with a fairly smooth mouthfeel that is this ale's saving grace."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Any indicator of this being a bad bottle or old bottle are out the window, this was simply an unimpressive beer. Pass."
"A light and hazy pale orange-yellow with a moderate head and some lacing. Looks more like a wheat beer than a pale ale. The taste is just very lacking in flavor. It enters the mouth with promise but has a pleasant mouthfeel that doesn't scream of over-carbonation but very carbonated in flavor. I was disappointed in this particular beer, mainly because this company's other brews are outstanding."
"This is one of thier weaker beers. The ale poured a cloudy bright orange with decent head and lace. Unfiltered with plenty of chill haze. Aroma was neutral with some floral hints. The front end had mild malt aroma, some bitterness took over in the middle, but finished a bit sour. Mouthfeel was watery at best. Carbonation levels weren't bad, so I'm assuming this low gravity ale just needed something to give it character."
"12 oz. bottle, batch 7701 - packaged 11/01/06. It pours a mildly-hazed gold with some floaties and a finger of white head that leaves light lacing. The bouquet consists of pale malts, spicy/floral hops, and maybe some yeast. It tastes of a pale malt background - mainly for balance - with a nice mix of piney/grassy/spicy hops and hints of grapefruit/perfume, combining to deliver a medium bitterness. It feels nice on the palate, with natural carbonation and a lightly tingly, dry body that leaves a medium to long finish. Overall very reminiscent of SNPA except with more bitterness and less of a malt profile. Definitely sessionable if you can get it."
"This unusually plain pale ale is a pee yellow, and has an aroma of musty basement inhabited by a cat. Flavor is better with a restrained malt and hop presence. It is a little less than ideal for a standard American Pale Ale, but will certainly do in a pinch when decent beer is needed for mindless television watching. Having tasted the Bells Two-Hearted Ale, ans some of their stouts, I am a little let down by this rather average offering, yet I admit that most American Pale Ales that really knock my socks off could actually qualify as IPAs in disguise, much like a 20 year old senior on the Highschool Varsity football team."
"The beer fells good in the mouth, light bodied and somewhat creamy as the head suggested. Carbonation does not interfere with the flavor of this beer. This could be a good session beer, however I think that there are better representations of the style out there. this one is alright, but I'll definitely be trying others before I come back to this one."
"And that all adds up to solidly good drinkability. This would be sessionable, I'd love to try it on tap. I'd have no qualms about scoring a sixer of this, I think it's more representative of the more reserved, English-style PA than the raucous APA, but wot do I know? Pretty good brew, recommended. But I want more hops."
"As I came to know this beer, it's smell proved only to break my narrow expectations of the style, not to be anything less than wonderful."
"Bottle purchsed at Breeze-Thru in Milwaukee."
"D- This beer has a bitter punch from the hops but not that much depth in the aroma or flavor of the hops. The malt is very faint and it would be nice to taste it a bit more to contrast the bitterness."
"I would have enjoyed a little more malt and a bit less hops, but still a very nice beer."
"Cheers!"
"D: Very drinkable, an enjoyable beer that I was concerned about (as I bought the variety pack specifically for the sixer of Kalamazoo Stout). Well worth a look."
"Pale orange/yellow brew. Nice foamy white head. Nice caramel malt smell with a nice hint of floral hops. Taste is nice and malty up front with a good bitter balance. Very smooth drinking beer. This is a very solid brew and could be a great have around the house kind of beer. I'm really liking this one. Another solid brew from Bell's, way to go guys."
"The mouth is light and not very complex, a little creaminess in the center before the dry hop finish. It seems somewhat out of balance and lacking a bit of character. Seems to perform better on draft based on my own experience. Not one of Bell's better selections."
"D - A decent beer, but decidedly too dry."
"Drinkability: If you really had too, I imagine this would make a decent session beer, but there are better APA's out there. This is by no means a terrible brew, but personally it didn't impress me like some of the other APA's that I've had."
"Drinkability - not a great beer, not bad either, but not good enough that I'd want another serving after I finish this 6-pack, especially since I can get ( and will, of course ) so many other excellent offerings from the normally excellent Bell's."
"Good sipping beer, but nothing much to write home about."
"This was okay, but not as good as I expected from Bell's. The yeast charactor was a little too prominent."
"Overall, a decent pale ale. It has good bitterness, but is not well balanced. I wonder what this tastes like fresher."
"What the hell happened Larry? I just do not like this beer. And I've had it from at least 3 batches, so it wasn't a bad bottle or anything. It amazes me that I love their IPA (2-Hearted) so much, but disliked this. I know some people have liked it from the reviews, so its a decent beer, but I personally will avoid it."
"Drinkability: I will definitely have again. Surely worth a try."
"Overall it's not a bad offering, but Bell's has set the bar so high. I would go with one of Bell's other offerings."
"Incredible how much quality Bell's put into even their lesser beers. A dense clouded colour capped with good head and lacing. Hops hit the nose like fireworks in the air, an explosive aroma. Hops only in the nose, void in the body. Taste falls flat in comparison, a big let down. Not much interest offered in the flavour. Stale wheat character. One dimensional, mouthfeel dull. Against other U.S micro pale ales this one doesn't compare, a surprinsgly (slightly) comprimised offering from Bell's. All the same, much prefered over anything commercial and I still can't say I've had a bad Bell's beer. Thanks Sammy."
"drinkability: Overall, for an APA this beer is what I expected to have. A good beer indeed and I would drink a six pack."
"A perfect hue for any pale ale. decent bubbling and some lacing to boot. Lots of amber and hints of light rust. The aroma is a good Saaz hop presentation mixed with a little alpha acidy Northwestern hops. But les not forget a biscuity bread aroma mixed with that bitterness. The taste starts out with some interesting, funky malts. But then lets the resiny hops get some attention. The palaste is a tad dry but still refreshing."
"This beer is okay but nothing to write home about. I don't see buying it again since Bell's has many better products out there."
"Enjoyable brew really. Not the best pale I've ever had, but a worthy brew worth trying. enjoy!"
"drinkability: super session"
"As I said, this bottle was my very first Bell's. This would be a really good Wheat/White/Wit, which I generally don't really care for. But it's labeled a Pale Ale and I'm not going to argue with a brewer that generally gets good marks. Not what I was looking for and not my preferred style, but pretty good, nonetheless."
"Poured a nice, light amber color with good head. The aroma was somewhat mild and consisted of some malt and a bit of sweet hops. The taste was malty with a hoppy, bitter finish and something of a stale, banana flavor. Maybe an old bottle? Mouthfeel was fine. Drinkability suffers due to the underwhelming aroma and funny taste."
"Bell's has had some pretty good offerings, this wasn't one of them, IMO. I'll leave the rest of the 6 pack in the fridge for others to try."
"light feel with a stinging, tight carbonation. toasted malt and honey sweetness with a touch of spicy hop balance, but not enough. finishes with a weak, generic bitterness. somewhat bland and very forgettable."
"Peppery. Very mild carbonation. Thin yet filmy in the mouth. Not bad, but not good either."
"Pretty easy drinking although it's probably not a beer I would go out of my way to drink."
"The body is light and really a very mellow beer overall. The taste is good but I wish there was more to it. Rather basic indeed, even with a pregnant padre."
"The beer pours a light gold. It sprouts a big foam head that leaves just as quickly and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. It is very bright; like no APA I've ever seen before. The smell is just like an APA. The biggest smell is floral hops. It also has hints of caramel and apple. The taste reminds me more of a AIPA, because it oily, with some spice, and very bitter, on top of normal APA flavors. It also contains some never before encountered in an APA, sweet and sourness. The mouthfeel is fair, and drinkability is killed because of the sweet/sour taste. Not like any other APA, but that doesn't mean it isn't good."
"Drinks pretty easy, a nice but not great APA IMHO"
"This is drinkable. I think I'd be happier were it to make up its mind about being a blonde or pale, and commit one way or another. Hoppy or balanced? Malty or balanced? Thin or medium body? It wavers a bit much for my tastes. But all in all, it's not a bad beer. I'd have another, but it wouldn't top my list."
"12 oz bottle, pours a cloudy honey yellow, sediment suspended throughout, finger of bright white head that fades to a lingering ring and leaves a little lacing. Nose is a nice mix of citrusy hops and a strong bready malt. Taste follows the nose, with a grapfruit/citrus hop presence making itself known over a good solid pale malt base. Finishes crisp and slightly bitter, with a slight metallic note. Pretty solid APA, tastes a lot like an English IPA, but easy drinking whatever it is."
"Da very good pale ale, while Im not a fan of sediment, this one is very drinkable. Indeed a good choice as the weather gets warmer."
"Picked this one up at Blue Max in the make your own sixer section. I will definitely get a sixer of this once it warms up, this would make a great cookout beer."
"Not very good."
"Overall: A solid brew but too much malt and grain in the taste. A solid ""average"" brew but an average brew nonetheless."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard pint glass ... appearance is golden yellow with a thick, white head and sporadic lacing in the glass. Nose is hoppy and almost bread-like. Some sweetness in the nose as well. Taste follows suit, with a good hop bitterness well offset by the sweeter malt foundation. Finish is rather dry and not at all bitter. Body is light and not overly carbonated. All in all, I like this ... and every ... beer from Bell's. Could have maybe been a bit stronger hop profile, but this does offer a well-balanced hop/malt ratio. Easily drinkable and mild enough that it would appeal to a wider range of beer drinkers ...specifically those that don't like a strong hop dominance."
"A great APA from Bell's. Pours out to a hazy yellow golden color with a medium head of white foam, and vigorous carbonation. Citrus hops and bready malts make their way to the nose, and mix in harmony. Taste is solid; flavors of rich, oily hops, mild sweet malts, and dry grain balance well on th palate. Mouthfeel was slick, and enhanced by the ever-present carbonation that didn't seem to die. This could be a good session ale for the summer time. Recommended."
"This tasted just like an average in the style. So I can't really rave about the flavor. It was sort-of an ipa, so there was a plus, otherwise, just an average beer that I wouldn't get again."
"Pours a very hazy peachy orange color with a minimal head that is very patchy over top. Nose is just okay. There is an almost apircot fruityness to it, with a sweet caramel backbone in there. Flavor is dominated by a peppery and lightly earthy hop, with a mild sweet caramel and apircot behind it. The finish is moderately bitter, but very clean. Feel is on the light end of moderate with carbonation to match. Its not bad, but not really drawing me in. I'd like to see more of a crispness in the hop."
"This brew pours a semi-cloudy bright orange color. The head is two fingers in height, rocky, and recedes slowly. It looks how a pale ale should look. The aroma rather lacking. There are some faint floral aromas that are nice, but they would be better if they were stornger. The taste is toward the lighter end of the pale ale spectrum. Floral hops dominate the sip, while the finish has some nice mild bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and smooth. Overall, this is a decent brew and very drinkable."
"Yet another great beer from Bells Brewing Company. Keep up the great work!!!"
"it's not bell's('s?) best offering, but i can dig it"
"Pours a cloudy, straw-colored golden color. The cloudiness is caused by a light sediment, this pale ale had a one finger white, fuzzy head that falls quickly to moderate to light white lacing. Smells hoppy and of sweet grain, almost like honey-wheat bread. Tastes very similar, appreciatively bitter, an overall enjoyable brew. Perhaps a little more carbonated than I enjoy, however not to the point of dislike. Drinkability fairly high, crisp and clean, slight bitterness in the aftertaste, not bad at all."
"Thanks to Frozensoul327 for the trade."
"Cheers!"
"Great APA, the best I've ever had. Batch # 6882. Traded from Reavis after his trip to see dirtylou in Chicago."
"Drinkability: I could easily session this beer. Quite tasty."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" white head above the golden brew. Head lasts pretty well, with average to good lacing. Aroma is kind of a corny sweetness. Taste is well-balanced, somewhat generic, with that same sweetness coming in at the close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are okay, but this is not one of the Bell's brews I would be knocking myself over to revisit."
"Like most Bell's year-around beers the Pale doesn't blow me away, but works as a solid representative of its style."
"Tastes a bit of wet dog. This is a fresh batch: ""The Batch ID that you entered '7089', is a Bell's Pale Ale. Your Bell's Pale Ale was packaged on September 28, 2005," but I have no idea where the hops have gone. The only hint of them is the bittering in the finish; there is no hop flavor. It doesn't taste bad, but it also doesn't taste like an APA. Very disappointing, especially when compared directly to Founders' superb version of the style."
"Drinkability is good. These could probably go down easy. However, I could only find this in 6 packs, and only in MI. The price was high for what it is, too. In the future, I will spend my beer $ on something with a little more zip."
"Has a moderately dense mouthfeel and syrupy finish. Drinkability is moderate on this. A little disappointing considering the rest of Bell's line-up."
"Not much of a head (< 1 finger) over the murky apricot brew with lots yeast particles. Signature Bell's yeast aroma. Grapefruit hop nose. Malt character well balanced by hop bitterness. Slightly leafy hop flavor. The finish is very clean with a pleasant nuttiness from the minor addition of Victory malt and mild Hallertau bitterness. There has to be cascade hops in this beer - no way the yeast will give that much grapefruit esters. Love the favor of this beer! Looking forward to a trip to the brewery."
"Notes: I prefer Two Brothers The Bitter End to this one for a pale ale with a large yeasty component."
"Altogether very nice, worth a try."
"According to Michael Jackson's Pocket Guide to Beer, a ""Pale Ale means bronze or copper colored."" Even though the bottle said this would be a lighter colored brew, the appreance alone turned me off to this one, a first for Bell's. Starw colored with mild hops, little carbonation, and grassy smell, this almost seems like they bottled this one wrong. Too many great Bell's and too many great Pale Ales to choose this one again."
"This beer was ok and I should note that my mom loved it but I expect more from Bell's and wasn't too enthused over this."
"Creamy and semi-sweet to start, but the hop bitterness and mild alcohol warmth provide a malty-dry finish of grain and light resin for a crisp and zesty aftertaste of balanced fruit and bitterness."
"Mouthfeel is nearly perfect with enough grist to make it feel full in the mouth. Another easy drinking brew from Bell's. I could see a sixer disappearing from my fridge quite quickly. Thanks to kmpitz2 for the single."
"Bottle conditioned pale ale, nice head, sticks around nicely, hoppy and floral nose, slightly malty, more tilted to the hoppy side in the nose. This is a pretty run of the mill, boiler plate american pale ale, hoppy on the get go, with a nice malty middle and a hoppy, drying finish. A good beer for a 6 pack on the beach or a bar b que, worth a try, but somehow I have come to expect more from bells."
"Pours a very pale straw color. Slightly hazy. Nice 2-finger white foam head that persists. Aroma of American hops. Flavor is grassy/floral hops that dominates over the pale malt base. Medium bodied. The hop bitterness lasts a long time, and {burp} keeps repeating. Overall an ok American Pale Ale."
"I used some of this brew in a marinade for flank steak and the end result was beautiful. Added a nice fruity touch to the soy sauce i also used."
"I might drink this again if it was fresh from the brewery, but I don't reckon I'd try it again otherwise."
"Good aroma: yeasty and fruity aroma, nice lace. Very good smooth fruity pale, with apple, grapefruit, orange and a spot of lemon. Understated carbonation as i would exepct from the style. Touch metallic, though not noticed in retry in fall 2005. Drying finish and spice aftertaste including cloves . Easy drink, not their best but a good effort."
"Pours out a straw color not too distant from the typical color of a macro. Here is where the similarities stop, however. A thin, white head that quickly disappears leaves a decent amount of lacing. Notable ""floaties"" in the body of the beer, but I'm not particularly scared away by such things. Aroma is strongly citrus with hops and pine serving as a background. From the appearance I expected this offering to be overcarbonated, but I was wrong. The taste is fairly typical of the style - strong hop notes with a dry finish. Nothing that breaks the mold, but still a very pleasant beer. Mouthfeel is slightly weak in the body compared to many others in the style, but not enough to be a deterrent. Drinkability on this one is pretty good, as long as you have a love hops."
"Very cloudy and yellow. When put up to the light I see floaters swimming around. Smells very much of floral. The taste starts with a piney spice and ends with a hops bitterness. Other taste I detect are citrus orange peel. With this beer I would say you felt like you drank something, plenty of taste."
"Drinkability is good seeing this beer is neither over-the-top or shy. It's very sharp, crisp and dry - all the qualities I love in a pilsner. I respect Bell's interpretation of this style, but I'm not a huge fan of this pale. A quality offering, just not quite for me."
"Pours a necw yellow, with the nicest white head you will find anywhere. Some floaties are about and swirling around in the carbonation. Nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is fruity with a touch of hops present. No defects. Lively fruity flavor, with plenty of hops and a nice malt presence. Hops linger on the palate. Nice mouth feel for a light ale, with perfect carbonation, and nice malt body. This is one easy drinkin' brew that could easily be consumed in quantity."
"Pours out blonde, with a slight haze to it. Foamy white head which sticks around and leaves some good lacing. Color is a little too light for this style. Aroma of grass, pale malt, a bit of lemony hops, and not much else. Taste is creamy with lots of malt, however it quickly leads into a tannin filled bitter metallic taste. An almost honey sweet malt taste is balanced by spice and a little citrous hops. Although it is a smooth beer, the drinkability is hampered by that tannin taste. Not at all what I was expecting in an APA."
"Not as much bite like others in this style exhibit, but it does have a decent malt body and a nice dry finish. Medium mouthfeel, a sixer of these goes down pretty easy after a long summer's day."
"12 ouncer sampled, pours light orangy, apricot. Cloudy with sediments, just a wisp of a white tiny bubble head, no lacing to to get excited about. Nose is sweet, bready and peppery. This is another nicely crafted and enjoyable from Bells. Moderate citrus hop bite, pepper evident. Quite dry in the finish. Fine sessioner"
"Hefe-cloudy golden yellow with a small, downy white head. Looks a lot like many witbiers that I've had, only with a smaller head. Nose is made up of lemony citrus hops over a slender, biscuity malt base. It's got that [expected] Bell's yeast character to it as well. Lively carbonation delivers juicy, lemon zesty hops to the tip of the tongue. Light malt backbone follows. Kinda sugary but not very sweet and leaner than I like. Tart, lemony hops swell into the piney, yeasty, malty finish. Medium-bodied with lively carbonation; refreshing. Not bad, but not my favorite Bell's beer."
"Final Thought: Not the best from Kalamazoo BC's brewhaus, especially at a steep price, I'll stick with SNPA for a staple APA."
"Thin and uninspiring, in my opinion."
"bottle 151 on rate beer.com doing it with a mich. beer .poured a golden color with lots of floaties with a med size white head. aroma malt, caramel, molasses, citrus(orange) honey. dark breads.flavor malts, earthy, fruity,hints of grapefruit.not a bad beer will buy more"
"If you like pale ales, do give this a try. It is a worty contender."
"Medium bodied and a smooth mouthfeel. The finish was somewhat dry and smooth, and the bitterness and citrus stuck out most here. Overall I thought this was a nice pale ale, and is a good tasty brew you can drink a few of."
" Decent mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation and a medium body. Its a very drinkable beer. I like it a lot. I realize I like it more now than I thought I did. I guess I just had to sit down, review it, and pick it apart. I highly recommend trying it if you can get it in your area."
"Pours a hazy golden, with a fluffy head with large bubble pockets and slight carbonation. Smells of mild hops and wheat, with mild malt underpinnings. Smells like a pilsner. Light hops with a slight spiciness, again shades of a pilsner, a tiny touch of fruit, apples maybe, with the slightly citrusy hops. Unfortunatly, it gets a bit watery too. A very pleasant beer, that is very smooth and light, a good summer beer. But as I sit here and drink it, it's 'grade' starts to slip. The wateriness becomes a bit too apparant, overpowering the otherwise very nice flavor. Pushes the definition of APA, at least in regards to my other experiences in the genre."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. There are some floaties present. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent with some citrus hops dominating, but not overpowering. The taste is good. It has a light pale malt flavor with a very bitter hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine American pale ale. It has good aroma and flavor, although they could use some body and munich malts."
"Mouth was oily and left a small hint of bread. I may have this agin but I doubt I'll pay for it."
"So which is it? As an APA, I find Bell's Pale Ale to be lacking. As a blonde ale, it ain't half bad. I guess I'll just score it on its own merits, regardless of style. I've had much better beer from Bell's, but this one is still enjoyable in its own way."
"This is the most mainstream of the Bell's I tried. Its smell is quite mild but the taste is better. While I don't think it is that bitter, it has a good hoppy quality, but I would expect to be able to smell that too. Weird. This Pale Ale is quite easy to drink and would be a good session beer."
"Pours cloudy yellow color and chunky white head with great lacing. Very big on the citrus hops right off the nose. Taste is very citrusy up front with nice yeast flavor mixing around in there. Very crisp beer that's almost a creamy texture. Goes down really smooth, a very drinkable pale, but nothing incredible here."
"D&N: Another fine offering from Larry. Very nice tastes and smells, and the fact that it's unfiltered lends it an interesting look. Nicely done."
"Pours a cloudy, hefeweissen yellow with a great coarse and fluffy head. Very slight smell, floral and I could swear a hint of stale marshmellows. Great taste, like a Bell's Two Hearted which decides to take the afternoon off. To 2hearted's grapefruit on viagra, we have sour citrus fruits underwritten by vegetal hints which make for a more complacent hoppiness. Flavors bow out half way through to a long, bitter finish. The carbonation is as spunky as 2heartd. I might just prefer this pale ale if I'm not in the mood to pucker my tongue for the night."
"This pale ale poured a hazy, golden (peach) color with creamy, smooth, white foam that clung to the glass a bit. The smell was fruity and malty, with a nice, mild hop aroma and traces of grain and yeast. The taste was a sharp malt and hop flavor (almost lager-like) with some floral hops and a bit of soapy hops in the finish. The mouthfeel was sharp and crisp and dry and hoppy with medium body and moderate carbonation. This was a decent pale ale overall."
"I had no problem with this one, but wouldn't reach for another too quickly."
"Not bad. Not bell's best, but not bad"
"Mouthfeel is generally good and drinkablity is good."
"This Bell's beer pours a golden hazy colour into the glass. It even looks a bit cloudy. Doesn't pour much of a head. It has a big hoppy smell with some hint of citrus. And a bit fruity smell too. The taste is fruity and very hoppy, with some malty taste too. It has some fruity aftertaste with some hint of citrus. This is the first beer from Bell's i taste. It is not so bad, but i think they have better ones."
"One nice Bell. It pours a hazy dirty gold with a nice white inch high head with plenty of lace. The aroma is soft floral hop. The taste is also soft, crisp, floral citric with a hop note that sticks around in the mouthfeel. A buttery oil feel coats the mouth while the final finish is abit dry. A nice, easy drink'n Bells. Great on a hot day or with a meal."
"Hazy yellow pour... looks almost like a wheat beer. Small white head leaves random small patches of lace. Smell starts similar to a wheat beer, too... grainy with a bit of lemon, but followed by floral hops. Taste is dominated by piney hops with a little grapefruit bitterness. Any malt flavor gets steamrollered by the hops... not very balanced! Medium body. Kind of middle-of-the-road: hop-haters would think this is too hoppy, and hop-heads will want more hops!"
"A nice pale ale. Nice blend of bitter soft hops and sweet malts and has a candy like quality about it."
"My first beer of the evening and anxiously anticipating it. Something there is about a nice bitter beer after an air flight. Arrived in my glass as the last of the head melted into the golden yellow beer. The head that remained did a good job clinging onto my glass - some stayed on the glass from my first sip. Flavor is a nice balance of sweet (mandarine oranges) and hops with a refreshing bitter finish."
" Very flavorful, overall, with pine cone hop flavor obliterating the pale malt. I enjoyed this quite a bit, but found all the ""floaties"" a bit disconcerting."
"I certainly won't be buying another one of these. This is better than, say, Coors, but that's about all the compliment I can give it."
"This pours a very pale straw/golden color with a white foamy head. There was some lace throughout on the sides of the glass. Smells slightly grassy, with a hint of grapefruit also. Tastes slightly sweet, with some hop bitterness mainly citrusy tasting. This was pretty drinkable, but overall not very impressive. There didn't seem to be very much malt character in this brew, and the hops did not taste very fresh. I guess this was an ok beer. I will stick to stouts from Bell's."
"Pretty drinkable, but it's not really my thing."
"Blonde ale with a creamy white head topping it off. Nice floral aroma along with a spicey note of hops. The spices standout and are quite noticable without being overpowering. The taste is again a nice blend of floral and spicey hops with a dry pale malt bite. Very good taste. The aftertaste is a lingering spice that remains tasty. Not an exceptional beer but still a one to enjoy."
"Hazy gold color, with a big white head that quickly dissapears. Smells of hops, but nothing that strong. This is a pale ale that is not nearly strong enough for my tastes, I need more hops. Not that bad, but nothing to write home about. Maybe it's because I just had chili, who knows"
"ng"
"Not bad, but defnitely not amongst Bell's best. Still, a decent if uneventtul pale ale, and I'd probably have one again."
"Appearance: Pours a hazy golden yellow tone with a vibrant white two finger sized head, leaving fine scattered lacing nice appearance. Aroma: Grapefruit in nature with underlying floral, spiced hops mild grassy malt notes very mellow but nice. Taste: Up front bitter with a bread malt tone, a bit one dimensional with the upfront zesty bitterness but overall a decent brew from Bell's. Mouthfeel: Is medium to light bodied steady carbonation, a bit oily from the hop resins. Drinkability: Not overly impressed by this pale golden ale from Bell's it's alright just not something I would crave."
"Very drinkable, especially at 5.0, another please."
"The beer pours a somewhat nebulous golden yellow with a persistent frothy white head that erodes and leaves behind a fine sheet of lace. Sweet and kind of biscuit like aroma at the front, crisp, fresh and lightly hop floral, appealing this nose, sweet malt start, top moderate in body. Finish is pesky in its acidity; hops are delightful in their muted presence with the aftertaste dry and lingering. I certainly wish we had a local source for this great breweries beer, maybe I need to lobby the distributors here more than I already do."
"Drinkablity: Hops on the taste, but not the nose. A nice little beer. Great prelude of what was to come."
"Thanks to FM for supplying this one, much appreciated."
"Cloudy and hazy light orange color, has a decent white creamy head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass, light citrus and bready aroma. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel, flavors of bread, butterscotch and grapefruit, finishes clean with a light bitterness."
"The Bell's Pale Ale was disappointing in appearance. Although the body was a clear light amber/gold the head was less than one finger high anf the lacing was virtually nil. The nose was light but gave botha small hop sense and then a stroger malt backbone was revealed as the brew warmed. The taste was OK, but not impressive, being bitter without a nice cirtrus sense nor other discernible flavor. The feel was good and the drinkability was quite obvious although more from the feel than the flavor."
"thanks go out to feloniousmonk for the sample."
"This brew was a little disapointing, I had heard so much about Bells, I guess I should have got one of their bigger beers. It was awfully pale in color. The smell was nice, with the hops sneaking out to say hello. The hops come through in the taste as well, with a nice yeasty flavor to balance it out nicely. Bottle conditioned too, which I thought was a little odd for such a light beer, but I guess SN pale is as well."
"Pale golden-orange in color with a white head that diminishes into a thin lace. Lots of sediment floating around in the glass (ok, so I can't pour. I won't blame them for that.) Lots of citrusy hops in the aroma, but not overpowering. The taste is citrusy and yeasty. I didn't expect all the yeast flavors from a pale ale, but it still tastes good so I'm not complaining."
"A very drinkable, smooth and perfectly hopped pale ale. It does not jump out as too hoppy and has a clean light orangish color to it. The light citrusy cents blend well with the hops. Smooth and not too carbonated but enough to be refreshing. Bells does a great job with their beers and the Pale is no exception."
"Pours a golden orange color with a tall pillowy white head that leaves spider webs of lace across the glass as it slowy dissipates. Very aromatic with notes of floral hops, citrus zest, and a touch of spice. Taste is dominated by bitter grapefruit rind hops with some biscuity malts in the background. As the beer warms, some notes of grain husks become apparent. Solid mouthfeel. This was a nice pale ale and good choice as a session beer. Just dont let it get too warm or the grain tannins become overpowering. Thanks to feloniousmonk for the sample!"
"Sharp mouthfeel especially in the back of the throat. A pretty drinkable beer overall."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a light orange, slightly hazy with lots of floating yeast. There are three huge fingers of head that die slowly. There is lots of lace left. The smell is full of citrus and hops. The aromas fill the nose nicely. The taste is a bit malty and yeasty at first, then it moves on to a fruity finish with only a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is a little light, but not too bad. The drinkability is nice though, and this is a very drinkable pale."
"Refreshing and tasty, but just a bit above lawn mower class."
"However, this particular bottle is just a little off, with a light aroma of cooked veggies. It is otherwise a maize colored, fairly clear pale ale with a good (but not overwhelming) spicy kick of hops. A lighter beer than you'd think, but this just makes it more quaffable (and in my mind) more enjoyable on a hot summer day. This may not be as hearty and full-bodied as some other pales ales, but iI still like it. It's a bit expensive for such a light bodied pale, but as a homebrewer I harvest the yeast sediment for some of my own brews, which makes the expense worth it."
"Not usually being a fan of the Bell's products, I tried this one with a negative outlook. Had it on tap at the local pub. Pours a cloudy yellow color with a small head that dissipates quickly and leaves little or no lace on the glass. The aroma was very fruity - very similar to most IPA's. The taste was a little spicy, but other than that it was a fairly average IPA taste. Nothing too special in my opinion. The drinkability was run of the mill."
"Thanks to tavernjef for sending several Bell products."
"This is a pale gold color beer that is clouded by a slight presence of sediment. On top of that is a bubbly white head, which leaves a nice lace trail. This beer has a pretty fruity/citrusy taste, topped with a spicy hop precence. This is a pretty good drink, not my all-time favorite, but worth a shot if you run into it."
"Alcohol by Volume: 5.3%"
"Served from a 12 oz bottle, courtesy of tavernjef, who sent some much needed Bell's to me in CT. Fairly golden in color this pale, only a bit of haze. Little bit of white head, nothing significant, low to moderate carbonation. Aroma is fairly yeasty, with a bit of spice. Taste evolves as this pale warms a bit, starting off a bit yeasty, but with good hoppy bitterness jumping out from the back of your tongue. Loving the bottle conditioned smoothness. Finishes with notes of citrus and spice, fairly dry. Good example of an intelligent pale ale, excellent artwork on the bottle as well..."
"If it wasn't for the dominating grainy tannins, this would be a pretty decent beer. However, as it stands, this is a one beer beer. Glad I gave it a try though ..."
"Pours a flourescent orange color with little head that soon left and there was no lacing to be found. The yeast was strong flavored here and provided a citrusy aroma and taste. Hops seemed to be more floral in taste and definitely strong. Finishes with a mouth puckering hop kick. Everything about this beer tells me it's average for a pale ale."
"Thanks to 'Realale' for the fresh sample."
"Finally got around to reviewing this one and overall I'd say it's a solid pale ale. It pours out a clear golden yellow with a small white head that fades to almost nothing. Malt dominates the nose and has a sweet bready, almost biscuity aroma with some help from the yeast. Hops are there but barely play a supporting role. Good texture on the tongue and a proper medium body. Again, malt takes the stage with bread and some fruit. Hop flavor is very detectable with some earthy tones and a nice lingering bitterness. Not a whole bunch going on here with this beer but a good pale ale needs not be overly complex. I could drink this all night if I could only get more of it here in Virginia."
"Purchased at the Brewery General Store on July 3, 2003."
"This beer poured virtually no head. The lacing was good on the sides of my glass. The hue of this beer is light yellow and the nose is spicy. I was disappointed in this brew as I thought it would be much better than it was. This is another one of my ""not a Bell's favorite of mine""."
"Overall, a good drinking brew. Welcome back, Bell's."
"Another questionable bottle of Bell's beer. Pours a cloudy gold/orange color, topped by a loose, off white head, and highly sedimented. The aroma is nice, with strong malts and a nice floral aroma. Notes of orange in the nose as well. Actually very nice and fruity. The taste is more lager-like than ale like, with a sharp malt taste finished by a crisp hoppiness. Lingering bitterness on the finish. No souring or wet cardboard flavors to hint at an old or spoiled bottle. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, with agressive carbonation. Drinkability is average. Best part of this beer is the nose."
"This brew has a very mild aroma almost non-existent. It has a light yellow orange body with no head and great lacing. It also has a bit of an after bite. I found it impossible to describe the taste. It was an OK brew, but not one of my favorites from Bells."
"Taste: mouthfeel is light/medium with some hoppiness that doesn't dominate, but you know it's there. All in all, a great session beer. Hopefully, with all of these great beers, Bell's will distribute out my way one of these days"
"Looks just like a wheat beer, cloudy deep golden color with small white head of foam. Smells kind of yeasty with a slight floral aroma. Very crisp and effervescent. Flavor is a little stale with a slight bitterness. Not one of the best pales I've had. Would prefer a little more hop presence. Reminds sme of one of my homebrews I used to make. Not as good as some of their other brews. This brewery seems to be inconsistant in my opinion. They have some stellar brews and some like this one. Just doesn't impress me."
"What a spectacular looking beer! Pours a creamy head. Looks like a mogul-covered ski slope. Except it's not downhill. It looks like there is a storm in the cloudy peach-colored beer. The head refuses to settle. It's there as I drain the glass. Smells wheaty and slightly of apricot. Tastes fantastic. This may be best traditional pale ale I have had. Very complex. Somewhat bitter aftertaste. I think I need to head to Kalamazoo. I'll bring my kazoo."
"Notes: Judging from several of the other reviews, it appears that some question this being a pale ale/bitter. I also found it very mild in the bitterness category, but I also really enjoyed the taste of this beer."
"Pours to a orangish-copper color with an off-white head. Has a huge blast of fruity, citrus hop aroma. Has a different flavor, almost nutty, with fruitiness. It flows to a very dry and bitter finish. It is medium in bodied and highly drinkable. Another tasty brew from Bells."
"I have to say I was a little disappointed in this beer, especially after being so impressed by most of the other Bell's brews I have tried. Pours an almost sickly looking light orange color with a thin and foamy white head. Very floral hops aroma, with light citrus notes as well. Flavor is mild, with perfumy hops and light malt. Finish is crisp and light, with a nice hops presense lingering. Okay, but gimme an Expedition next time."
"One really nice pale and quite unique."
"-F"
"It's pretty cloudy and straw/orange in color. The head is huge, has a good retention and awesome lacing. What a kick ass aroma this has! It's citrusy and yeasty, I really enjoy it. There's a wonderful smoothness to this beer, medium carbonation and mouthfeel. I really enjoy the spicy hop character, also fruity in a way. This character follows pleasant malt character. It's kind of odd for the style to me, but I really enjoy it regardless. It's an awesome beer."
"Chunky, murky pale orange appearance with a lighter 1/2 inch head of medium bubbles. Laces in rings. Grassy hop aroma, quite evidently mixed with an oiled pizza dough yeastiness. Semi-coating and smooth mouthfeel and a mid caramel malt bill supplemented by a nectarine fruitiness. Hops tend toward an slightly astringent citrus and are evident mid mouth onward. Good balance. What's really evident here is the yeasty breadiness, welcome in many of the Kalamazoo Stouts, but somewhat strange here (as in the Sparkling Ale as well). So I'm a fence sitter, balanced but somewhat odd flavor."
"A somewhat reserved pale ale, but very well crafted and quite drinkable. Citrusy/floral hops were judiciously administered and well balanced by a lightly toasted malt. Tended to lean a little toward the English interpretation. Very clean and refreshing - a good session ale. Strikes me as a good transition beer to build a non-hop-head's tolerance (and appreciation) for Two Hearted Ale."
"@The Press Grille: This beer poured a hazy/cloudy yellow color(chilled glass did not help-note to bartender after I get to know him better)and had a small bubbly white head that left trace lace. It had an aroma of hops, citrus and slightly of malt. A flavor of hops, citrus and bread. The finish was light an a touch astrigent. As far as pale ale's go, this is not a good example and a rare miss for Bell's."
"Overall, it's a decent beer, but it just doesn't seem polished. Plenty of better pale ales out there IMO."
"Pours a slightly hazy gold, with a persistent fluffy white head that leaves a fair amount of lace. Aroama is full of toasted malt, cut grass, and spices. Flavor begins as bread dough, then becomes herbal and bitter. The flavors balance quite well. Mouthfeel is just slightly rough and somewhat oily, with a medium body. This is a most excellent pale ale, that I could drink all night long. Kalamazoo does it again!"
"Pours a hazy yellow, very little head that fades to zero, and virtually no lace. Faint smell of sweet hops, slightly bready. The taste reveals very little carbonation, light malty, slightly spicey. Not too much going on in the mouthfeel, and a short, slightly hoppy finish. Strange, I have the Expedition stout in the wings that I am looking foward to, but this one falls short."
"The color's that of ripe apricot, the head a solid, stocky white. Aromas are explosive, spinning off citrus, primarily grapefruit, orange, lemon, and a whiff of spice. A downright friendly finish, that meets you, and greets you and treats you right. Awash in bitter, but fruity flavor, with a sensational, and long lasting drizzle of hops. Fresh, sea-foamy nose. Light body, excellent texture and mouthfeel, full of that unexplainable effervescence that permeats all of Bell's ales. It's got to be that yummy, yummy yeast. One hell of a great pale ale!"
"Pours a reddish orange with a white head. Nice hopiness with enough maltiness to back it up. A really solid version of the style. Another solid brick in the foundation of a rock solid brewing company."
"Enjoyed on tap 12/9/02. Pured an amber color with a medium head that quickly dissipated. The strong hops aroma was clearly noticable on the nose and accompanied by an overwhelming citric, grapefruit taste. The presence of malts providing any balance to this brew was undiscernible. One pint was enough for me."
"Hazy gold body with a thick, almost creamy head.  Head fades surprisingly fast, but never disappears altogether.  Smell is a bit grassy, with bready caramel malt and citrus hops.  Good smell, but a little weak.  Well balanced flavor.  Neither the caramel malt nor the hops really takes full control in the taste.  Caramel malt is a bit biscuity, and the hops are bitter and citrusy.  Finishes oily and bitter.  Rough, oily mouthfeel for this excellent session brew."
"It's a little paler than I was expecting from Bell's. A lot of PAs are darker than this beer. It does have that nice wet, clingy head that I love pale ales to have, though. The aroma is mostly the hops, a bit thin and astringent, but not unpleasant. I was a little worried at the taste. Had the brewery I had come to expect for big malty beer let me down? Turns out the light color had less to do with lack of malt than with the color of the malt used. The malt flavors dominate early on. As the beer warms, the thin, bitter hops dominate the beginning finishing with the crisp malt. Not my favorite APA, but far from a mediocre example of the style. One thing, though. If you're expecting the huge hoppiness of a lot of the really popular APAs, this is a bit mild."
"For a good ""fruity"" APA, check out Hair of the Dog Ruth.  This ""pales"" in comparision."
"Palest of all. Gold. At first there's an impression of brown sugar on the nose with candied lemon in the background. Then the kaleidescope shifts and there is a custard-like egginess predominant. Then, once more, it reconfigures as a freshly opened can of creamed corn, corn and milk. The attack is of overripe citrus. Bright, clear flavors of cane, pancakes and lemon marmelade with sunny, hayfield notes weaving in to linger. This beer was easy to pick out in the lineup for that trademark Bell's signature flavor."
"I love k'zoo beers, but this one I am not as high on as others.  It is very unique though as it almost has some Belgian qualities to it..a pours a cloudy golden with a big thick head....smell is yeasty as you'd expect with a bottle conditioned beer...also some sourness on the nose...  Taste has some biscuit, breadiness to it and some real spicy hop accents..maybe even some subtle smokiness to it similar to Batch 5000 in that regard but toned down about one-thousand times...One of the more unique pale ale's but not my bag of tea...nice to try and solid in its own right but I like many others better.  Nowhere near two hearted ale in my opinion.."
"Drinkability: Very quaffable."
"Cloudy orangish-yellow pour with very fine head that gives way to a persistent lace that lasts the glassful.  Even when well chilled, the aroma is striking with citrus and hops hinting at the surprisingly strong flavors that await.  A nice hoppy sharpness with some of the fruitiness giving way to a hint of toastiness.  Mouthfeel is smooth without being slimy.  I first enjoyed this beer from a keg, and it seems nothing is loss in its translation to a bottle."
"Cheers to Deuce for the sample!"
"Pours hazy bright golden color with tiny bits of yeast suspended and a perfect sized pillowy white head that last most of the way down the glass.  Light floral and spicy hops smell.  The hops attack the tongue first thing but are then nicely followed by just enough malt to balance this one.  The spicy hops make this refreshing and crisp and a great summertime brew.  Extremely drinkable and thirst quenching.  This is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries.  Thanks to Deuce for the sample."
"I thought the aroma was huge, I could smell the citrus-hop with the bottle a ½  foot from my nose. On the palate a decent malt backdrop, and I thought the hops were pretty dominant but not totally overpowering. I agree with bighuge a pretty unique version of a pale ale.. good stuff."
"I've been into so many different specialty brews from Kalamazoo over the past couple of years that I hadn't realized it had been years since I tried some of their ""run of the mill"" brews.  Thanks to Davo for leaving one behind for me in our trade."
"Wow I sure do miss Bells back home (Mount Pleasant,Mi).Wow great head,nice subtle hop maybe to little for a Pale ale but good enough.Yeasty smell is wonderful would like a six pack now!Well back when I drank this beer I thought it was the greatest thing ever."
"The huge, billowy thick and creamy head sits atop a light golden bubbly brew.  Good clarity, although there are yeast particles from the apparent bottle conditioning.  The signature but subtle fruity, almost pearlike esters from Bell's yeast strain are discernible in the aroma, along with a hint of diacetyl.  The Centennial hop nose is citrusy and a touch grapefruity-- the hop nose is reminescent of a subdued Two Hearted Ale.  Very smooth mouthfeel. The hop bitterness is mild to moderate for a pale, and a firm malt character manages to assert itself into the flavor profile.  Slightly leafy hop flavor.  The finish is very clean with a pleasant nuttiness and mild hop bitterness.  Although this isn't as distinctive as other Bells brews, this pale is finely balanced.  As the risk of sounding esoteric this beer tastes like a mix of Liberty Ale and Odells Cutthroat Pale."
"A nice interpretation of the Pale Ale style.  As the six pack container says, you ""sprain a taste bud"".  Good stuff."
