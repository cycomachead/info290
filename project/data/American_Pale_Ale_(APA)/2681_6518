4.34,11.6,4.5,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"Poured from a growler into pint glass. Pours a finger of soapy, eggshell white head, with good retention and walls of firm sticky lacing. Dark orange and brownish amber, quite clear. Smells well balanced with a sweet malt backbone and a nice floral hoppiness. Nice flavor, has some metallic bittering hops in the background, with a flavorful malt balance. Tastes a little like oranges. Metallic feel, and foams up somewhat in mouth. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy body. Overall, I love this pale ale. It was one of the first craft beers I fell in love with years ago, and this is the first I've had it in a long time. Though its not as complex as it probably could be, it will always be one of my favorites.","sporklift87","Apr 05, 2015"

4.41,13.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I was honestly going into this beer already disapointed because 2 of my 3 previously tried out of a make your own 6-pack were very disapointing (1 was another well known pale ale from another craft beer giant, the other was a canned beer). Boy was I surprised, this is a good beer. Pours an orange-gold body with a mountain of frothy foam. The smell was floral and piny with some citrus. The taste reflects this with the addition of some sweet malts. Overall a delicious beer that I definitely see myself drinking in the future, but with that said there are a few critiques. Firstly I felt there was too much bitterness with not enough hop flavor if that makes sense, like there was a lot of just generic bitterness with not too much distinct hop flavors. Secondly, the packaging needs to be updated. Although I got only one in a make your own I saw that these were being sold in the old plastic rings of fish doom. In my opinion that need to change to the new 6 pack carriers most craft brewers use for their canned beers, they look better and are better for the environment","Joe_Howard","Mar 31, 2015"

Bit more going on with the taste as there is some floral hops in the mix as well. A slightly dry and light bitter finish but doesn't last all that long. Probably one of the better APA style brews though, although I am not a really a big fan of this style of brew. I will say that as it warmed up a bit, it was a little better.

I was 12 when I first drink this, a little clean shaven boy not ready for what I had acquired.

4.19,7.7,4.25,4.5,4,4,4.25,"Canned on 12/17/14.  Poured into a mug at about 45 degrees.  Pours clear dark golden-copper with 2 fingers of nearly white head which dissipates quickly to a thin film with flecks of lacing around the glass.  Smell is dank west coast hops with a mild floral tone and fresh baked biscuits.  Smell is similar to Sierra Nevada's Torpedo Extra IPA, but with somewhat less complexity.  Carbonation is medium, and this adds to the body nicely.  Mouth feel is medium, and seems a bit thicker than most other pale ales I've tried.  Taste is robust alpha acid-rich hops and mild sweetness.  It is extremely well balanced as far as hop-bitterness to malt sweetness goes.  Overall, it's a bit on the bitter side as far as the style goes, but that is precisely why this is one of my favorite pale ales.  If you like the American pale ale style, this will probably be a top-notch in your books.","nizzle8287","Jan 30, 2015"

It's a good thing that this beer is available year-round, as it can be enjoyed and would fit well in any season.

Incredibly fruity nose, all kinds of things going on including orange, mango, peach, strawberry, kiwi, guava ... All blending together to yield a gummy bear effect. Wonderful hop aroma than can keep up with many full-fledged IPAs. Palate was more classically pale ale, however (assuming one can truly split hairs like this), a smooth caramel backbone with the hops still bold but not aggressive, everything well-integrated to yield a pleasant but mellow grapefruit, floral and tropical fruit melody. Mouthfeel slightly oily and smooth, moderate body and carbonation. Finishes quite dry, almost woody. Bitterness is notable. Great concoction, this, even if the nose does trump the palate by a wide margin.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 23, 2014"

Good heavy malt start with the substantial hops coming through about half-way into the sip.  Strong citrus dominates the palate until the swallow.  Then a crisp, slightly bitter finish.  Very quaffable.  A strong go to APA with more hops than average.","wasso67","Nov 03, 2014"

Very nice nose of tropical citrus hops over a pine and light caramel background. Medium body with an almost slick texture. Above average carbonation with a nice effervescent finish. The flavor profile is complex and well balanced. It begins with a blend of hop flavors found in the nose, then rapidly flows to a pine focused hop bitterness over a slightly tart note. As the bitterness fades, a light caramel sweetness emerges in the effervescent finish. A tart pine bitterness with hints of spice lingers.","tillmac62","Jul 29, 2014"

Good hop to malt balance. Easy drinking session ale. Taught me that canned beer need not taste bad. My example was brewed in Brevard, NC. Fresh. One of the best session APA beers. On the expensive side for what it is. I'd drink this ale again. Offends in no area.","KentT","Jun 26, 2014"

First of all, it has a darker complexion. Not much darker, but enough to be noticable. Second, it smells richer, like there's a little more to it then the 12 oz version. Third, my wife and I split a can so we each got about 10 oz and it had considerably more kick to it than a 12 oz can. Finally, there was way more malt and not nearly as bitter as the 12 oz version. I could see a couple of my ""I don't like IPA"" friends drinking this and enjoying it. Very good all around and if I could get it here regularly for less than $5 a can, this would be my go-to beer instead of the 12 oz cans or Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.","MarkGamber","Jun 24, 2014"

I picked up a bit of caramel in the aroma along with some piney hop goodness. Tastes fairly boozy in a delightful way. Lots of nice hoppy piney notes that leave me wondering where the boundaries of IPAs and APAs are drawn. Very rich mouthfeel with a moderate amount of carbonation that balances everything just right.

It's a heftier APA at 6.5%, but it's still a very solid hoppy session-ish ale, and a brew that I plan to try fresh at some point in the future. No one satisfies the hopheads better than our neighbours to the south, and this is one of the benchmarks in its style for good reason.","thehyperduck","Apr 21, 2014"

After getting home and cracking open a can after dinner i poured it into a glass and was surprised at how well it poured. Lots of lacing and a great orange/amber color. Once i took a sip i couldn't believe what i had just drank. This beer came out of a can!? Before i knew it the glass was empty and i had a smile on my face.","unscarred785","Apr 14, 2014"

It pours hazey yellow, with thin white laces running to the finger width head. It has a real strong hop tatste for being a pale ale, not to over bearing though, goes down smooth, leaves your palte dry (wanting more). I think it is a halloween party in the can, becuase taste like a IPA in a pale ale's costume....","ChristopherWIU-UTPA","Apr 10, 2014"

The taste is, just wonderful. It starts sweet, and just when you think this beer will be too sweet, the hops kick, but, not overpowering. The after taste is heaven. A perfect balance of malty sweetness and hop dryness. This tastes like a really, really good homebrew. That is the best thing I can say about any beer.","thebeergeek","Apr 06, 2014"

I couldn't pick up too much aroma because I had this at a bar that allows smoking. I picked up some sweetness along with pine and citrus. It tastes slightly sweet upfront followed by a piney and fruity bitterness that lingers. It's really bitter for a pale ale, almost borderline IPA. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall a solid pale ale. It's not outstanding, but it is good.","y2jrock60","Mar 24, 2014"

4.28,10,4,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"I get this in the can often (From the Brevard NC brewery, not Colorado, different water) so this review surmises the beer across multiple tastings. As with many APAs it is best when fresher. Recently I have been getting it as fresh as one week and as old as 1.5 months. This is a great daily session drinker. 8.99 sixer here. Pours excellent head, 1-1.5inchs. Nose is mango when fresh more hops and malt when old; taste is similar. full on fresh grapefruit and bitter hops when a nice sweet fresh hop middle and then some dryness at the end. Compared to Zombie Dust, Pliny the Elder and Heady Topper it is not on that level; but that is a hard level to achieve and I rate this beer consistantly just below them. I highly recommend especially when fresh. Check the date on the bottom of the can.","coriswrasse","Dec 29, 2013"

The hop profile is actually more aggressive than expected, and the malty sweetness is pretty robust for what it is. It lacks consistency in the body and aroma, but it is undeniably tasty for what it is. Other than this, I've only had Ten Fidy, but I really hope I can find more spare cans from the brewery because I'm definitely interested thus far in moving on from their flagship and trying other brews of theirs.","magictacosinus","Jun 21, 2013"

3.96,1.8,4,4.25,4,3.5,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a good example of an American Pale Ale, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style, but it seemed to be right on the border of the style and it was pretty close to an IPA, i have had more than a few IPA's that were much less bitter. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't that smooth because it was a little overly bitter, but the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, so I could myself drinking a couple of these, but it's not the type of APA that I could drink all day during the summer, the bitterness is a little to high for that. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty good and I thought it had nice balance to it. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of bitterness, if the bitterness was toned down like a normal APA it would really help the drinkability. I might buy this beer again, but it isn't something that I feel the need to rush out to the store and buy more, but it's for sure worth the price and I would recommend giving it a try if you like APA's and IPA's. All in all i wasn't wowed with this beer, but I thought it was pretty solid for the style and it was fairly enjoyable, but with a couple adjustments I could see this being a great session Pale Ale. This made for a nice first impression of Oskar Blues and i'm interested too see what the rest of their beers are like, it's always nice when good brewery's starts to distribute here, welcome to Michigan Oskar Blues.","StoutHunter","Mar 18, 2013"

4.1,5.4,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Overall, I suppose it's an APA. I usually find APAs to be a little less hoppy than IPAs, but this one has quite a huge hop presence, to my taste buds. I really find that it's an APA/IPA hybrid. This is quite a complex, tasty APA, and it's a better beer than Mama's Little Yella Pils, but I don't know that I'd find this beer to be very sessionable. Not so much because of the ABV, but I'd prefer my session beer to be a bit less bitter.. despite the fact that the fruity, floral hops are quite nicely balanced with the malt sweetness. Dale's Pale Ale is a beer that I've wanted to try for a long time, and I'm glad to have such a damn good canned beer in the great state of Michigan. A slick, simple looking can, a tasty, sexy looking beer... Oskar Blues can make some tasty brews.","Alextricity","Mar 12, 2013"
3.98,2.3,4,4,4,3.75,4,"I enjoy the APA style, mainly because of the nice hop jolt they deliver while remaining (at least somewhat) sessionable.

I was expecting a burst of flavor, but it was rather mild. For 6.5% it has a slightly harder punch than most pales, and it comes in a can! Gives me a more mobile option if I'm wanting to drink craft, especially if places don't allow glass. Watch out pool party, Dale's is coming with me. And for a really good time, I'll throw in some Ten FIDY's!","BWED","Mar 10, 2013"

The nose comprises orange zest, light flowers, light grass, and a version of sweet caramel that blends in quite well with the surroundings. The taste brings in more of the same, with a sharper sense of the grass and the rind of the orange. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish.

4.63,19,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"In the South, where I live, Dale's Pale Ale stands out as that craft brew from afar that a lot of places carry, and that proves time and again to be a superior brew over the locals and the typical non-local stuff that appears on drink menus here. It is clearly underrated here on Beer Advocate because it gets lost in the crowd of pale ales and IPAs that are out there. But in a place where there isn't so much of a crowd of those brews, Dale's absolutely kicks ass. I first had it on the rec of friends at Motorco and Geer Street Pub in Durham, NC, then had it at again at a Mellow Mushroom in Atlanta, and every time I thought, damn I'm glad the server recommended this. It's really more of an IPA than a PA, and for me that is just fine. It is cloudy, very flavorful and drinkable, and would be high on the list of beers I would offer to newbies wanting to get into hoppy craft beers. This review is based on my Mellow Mushroom order, which was the first Dale's I had drank in a year, and I was stunned by how good it was. A beautifully thick, cloudy brew with a nice balance between assertive, hoppy flavors and drinkability. I think it's a superstar in the craft brew world.","Cobrito","Jan 31, 2013"

Aromas of big orange, orange zest, grapefruit, caramel, floral, grass, light pine, bread, and light herbal spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; not as strong as I would have hoped. Taste of orange, caramel, grapefruit, light pine, floral, grass, citrus rind, bread, and herbal earthiness. Fair amount of piney citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, caramel, pine, floral, grass, citrus rind, bread, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice hop flavor complexity and malt flavor balance with the bitterness; with zero cloying flavors noticed after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any arming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice APA!

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, and pine. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, pine, and cream. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I’ve had this brew in quite a few different servings and have enjoyed each quite a bit. This one was no exception. The nitro really didn’t take much out of this one, but it did add one interesting note that I got with the cream. Not sure where it came from, but it really didn’t hurt nor help the brew. Just a note. The carbonation was cut down as one would expect on the mouthfeel, but was still quite nice. I would drink this brew in just about any format. Now to find a cask!","thagr81us","Nov 21, 2012"

The beer is medium amber, completely clear, with languid bubbles. The nose is earthy, citrus, a little fresh cut grass, some pine. The flavor is malt up front, with pine resin, some honey or toffee, and a bit of a lingering, drying bitterness. Mouthfeel is slick and coating. A very decent, non-challenging American Pale Ale that has enough going on so you can serve it to a crowd with some beer geeks in it but not such a hop bomb that only hopheads will like it; in other words, a good party beer.","MCDuhamel","Oct 28, 2012"

Of course, I love hops so I’m not complaining, but it’s not as balanced between the malt and the hops as most pale ales are. Still, this is another awesome beer from Oskar Blues.

The nose picks up a beautiful citrus-pine hop with a pleasant root beer malt hint. Very high end for a pale ale! The flavor brings on more of the same with vanilla sweetness and more of a hop grain attack that satisfies any hop appetite in the pale ale world. I also sense a near chocolate malt complement. Medium bodied with a frisky feel from lively carbonation, this is one great pale ale! Highly drinkable and well recommended.","Durge","Sep 14, 2012"

Honey colored with a finger of off-white head that reduced to a thin layer pretty quickly, but it stayed throughout the drink and had some lacing. Slightly piney, citrusy nose up front. Malty/bready notes were in there. Malt sweetness up front on the taste that gave way to a hop (piney/herbal) bitterness in the middle and citrus on the finish.

Big floral, perfumey nose with subtle resiny citrus hops and a solid caramel malt base. Taste follows suit wonderfully. Resiny, perfumey hops are perfectly balanced with toasty, bready, sweet caramel malt. Hints of orange peel, toffee, biscuit, and tea. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly sticky with a great tangy, dry, bitter hop bite on the finish. This is very close to the perfect Pale Ale.

4.13,6.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Dave's Pale ale is almost an IPA who's flavor complexity almost seems like the floral version of Sierra Nevada's bench mark pale ale. The body is about perfectly balanced for a hop-head, and is light enough to drink several in an evening. Plus it comes in a can, which makes it perfect for camping, backpacking, etc. Oskar Blues is quickly becoming my favorite Colorado brewery.","Bockrules","Sep 02, 2012"

The beer appears to be well-carbonated with some bubbles on the side of the glass and rising from the bottom of the glass. Plenty of sticky lacing is left on the side of the glass. The aroma is of sweet malts and citrus and piney hops. The flavor is hop forward. There is a nice blend of citrus and bitter piney hop flavors. The malt backbone adds mild sweetness. The amount of hops borders on IPA territory rather than just a pale ale. The body is medium with adequate carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer. It definitely is a solid offering from Oskar Blues that is worth trying.","acevenom","Jul 07, 2012"

3.62,-6.9,4,4.5,3,4,3.5,"This beer pours piss brown and yellow with some slight oranging and a big thick creamy head that leaves good rings of lacing swirling in the glass, and has a mellow retention. Smell is an excellent mix of spicy piney hops and sweeter caramel malts. There is a surprisingly great spiciness to this smell which I am finding thoroughly intriguing. Its taste is light an almost caramelly, but with some nice spice hints and good hops-bite. There is a slight soapiness present from the hops taste, but it is not too bad here. I really was hoping for more of the spices found in the smell, but it kind of disappointed in that aspect. It’s cool and refreshing, just not as spicy and complex as the smell had me thinking. The mouthfeel is cool and crisp with a good carbonated tingle on the tongue that slides away quickly leaving a dryly wet hop feeling, if that makes sense… There are good amounts of saliva on the tongue, but it just feels slightly burnt and dry from the hops. It’s a feel I have come to expect in more hoppy beers I just have been unable to explain it so far. Overall, this is decent beer, but I’m a little disappointed after the amazing taste of Deviant Dale’s India Pale Ale. Dale’s normal pale ale is good it’s just nowhere near as good as the Deviant Dale.","Maxwell","Jul 07, 2012"

An underlying sweet malt is also evident--decent nose. The flavor is quite hoppy and rather bitter. A constant hoppiness from start to finish with a hop bitterness enhanced dryness at the swallow. The body is medium and carbonation also moderate. Overall a tasty pale ale--definitely on the more bitter end of the spectrum. A solid pale ale.","uwmgdman","Apr 28, 2012"

Good, heavy nose of hops, with a resiny and tangy character, and some light citrus and malt blending. Flavors are hop forward, with a peppery and basil spicing, which is balanced by a buttery and toffee-like malt, as well as a slight citrus highlight. Very well blended. The aftertaste is tangy sweet and resiny hops bitterness, with a slight cloying effect to it. Slick, somewhat lingering finish, with a slow, steady withdrawal that dries evenly and subtly.

3.97,2.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Transparent honey/amber with eggshell colored craggy two finger head, minor lacing only. Nice carbonation, creamy texture, intense toffee malt scent combined with piney resin pitch and citrus oils. On tasting I am surprised this is called an APA, by my tastebuds this brew sits smack on the borderline between my definition of an APA and IPA in bittering. Taste follows the nose but also includes a modicum of Simcoe onion-y-ness that I didn't smell in the nose, Not a deadly large amount mind you, but just the right amount in a sane dose that stays delicious. Really delicious and full of bold flavor in both malts and hops... I only ever revisit about 25% of the brews that I try for the first time and I am pretty sure that this one will be getting a repeat visit in the future, so take that as a recommendation. I just wish more of that flavor was represented in the nose, if I were to nitpick it.","WastingFreetime","Oct 28, 2011"

I would drink this summer, fall, winter, or spring.","SawDog505","Sep 27, 2011"
3.95,1.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The deep orange color is darker than I would have expected. The aroma is subtle but complex, with a combination of caramel sweetness, earthy hop bitterness, and alcohol. The flavor is much more one-dimensional, with strong notes of pine and grapefruit, making the flavor bigger and bitterer than many pale ales. The bitterness builds, which can make it tough to drink more than a few at a time. Overall, flavorful and a great option among canned beers.","MayLattimore","Sep 27, 2011"

The taste is hoppy, malty and resiny with a tad of citrus and caramel. The beer is fairly balanced, but might be a little on the hoppy side. Medium body with medium carbonation.

I love PAs, but this one is really just like a light bodied IPA. I've had IPA's that were much less hoppy. Also the body is too light for a PA. Close to watery. Not happy with this one as a APA. Great looks, good nose, but it stops there for me. If they want to re-market it as a IPA and fixed the body, I'd buy it again.","bpw28","Aug 01, 2011"

The taste was great, even better than I remember (and I remember it being good), you get a little caramel malts up front but a load of bitter pine hops on the way down and a nice hoppy lingering after taste.

It pretty much has all of the elements you expect, lots of hops in the nose, and a bitter finish, and there is some malt to partake in too. I imagine that this would be a different beer if the carbonation was at least twice what it is for this example, so on tap it would be a different experience and I may try it someday.

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Bold and bitter in the taste. Lots of hops and sharply bitter, this beer is no slouch. Slight fruitiness of oranges in the background, but all of it takes a back seat to the hoppy bitterness. It's by no means balanced and could almost be considered an IPA, but the boldness of the flavoring makes it work. The hop taste sticks around for a while after the sip, making your palate surrender to the bitterness. More than solid, but couldn't see myself drinking more than one or two of these guys in one sitting. Very heavy on the bitterness making it hard for your mouth to keep up with it. Still one of, if not my number 1, go-to pale ale.","chodinheaven","May 14, 2011"

3.56,-8.5,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Nice looking can leads to a nice appearance score. The nose was faint hops. Not much came through the can though. Regardless, this beer is all about balance and drinkability. The light hop profile mixes perfectly with a light male sweetness to create a distinctly quaffable pale ale that is both hoppy, but also as drinkable as a light lager. The hops are faintly citrusy, with some bitterness that doesn't go overboard. Good carbonation and an easy mouthfeel. I'm very impressed OB. Now, as pale ales go, this is about the opposite of a beer like Hoppy Birthday from Alpine, which is a feat as a low ABV hop bomb. This is more about sitting around the camp fire with a few brews, and as that, it is a winner.","seeswo","May 12, 2011"

Medium mouthfeel and carbonation with a juicy-oily finish. Not nearly as dry as most U.S. pales, this one refreshes the palate while delivering lots of hop goodness.

A subdued malty sweetness then joins in, but then is once very hoppy. The flavors are excellent and the there is a slightly dry and yet someone creamy finish. A great beer, but alittle high in ABV for a pale ale. Also it's a bit hoppier than most would expect from the style, but it's not exactly an IPA either.

Color is golden to a slight orange that you can see all the way through. Looks like a damn good APA or IPA (depending on how you consider your IPAs). Smells of fresh resinous and piney hops, not much in the way of citrus or anything of that sort. Some sweet malt and grainy barley characteristics also show through to balance the nose. Upfront is more bitterness than i had expected, this leads me to feel that this is more of an IPA then an APA as the hops seem to weight a bit more heavily in my mouth and in the after taste. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing and makes me immediately want another one. This beer is pretty drinkable and at 6.5 percent, i could probably go all night with them.

A bit hoppy for an APA, though that is my preference it might not be for everyone. Light to medium bodied and a bit heavy on the carbonation, but not overdone.

Could be the malts but wouldn't be shocked if the hops have much to do with the sugar-sweetness in the smell, backed up and perhaps surpassed by the fruit-punch juicy hops. A toasted bent to the light malt flavor and a bit nutty in the back but, once again, the hops rule here - only marginally bitter - a predominantly orange citrus tone throughout, but finishes decidedly lemony. Such a pleasure to drink with only a trace of carb sizzle, in spite of a few hearty braps. Happy that the level/potency of hops didn't detract from indulging in a good swill or two, however, considering the English-cask feel, I'd be curious to try this with the hops toned down a tad.

3.98,2.3,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce can as part of my GABF Denver haul. I could be wrong but I believe Dale's Pale Ale was one of, if not the, first craft canned beer. Pours a reddish hue, with a small fizzy head about a half inch tall. Some lacing on this one. Aroma is a nice balance of citrus and pine hops with caramel malt sweetness. It could be a little stronger, but that could be my nose and not necessarily a flaw. Light syrupy body, good carbonation, better bitterness. Huge caramel toffee malt sweetness is present in this one. This is quite good. Buckets of resinous hops coat the mouth, leaving behind a sticky residue. Malt sweetness chases the hops down the back of the throat. They can't get rid of the lingering hop bitterness though. I got this can of Dale's about two weeks ago, so it's a bit old and I'm sure the hop character would be even more pronounced had I drank it sooner. Still it's a very solid example of the Pale Ale style and quite enjoyable. I could drink about 3 or 4 of these on a night and go home happy.","eclaycamp","Oct 01, 2010"

The beer is colored light copper with orange notes. There is a big off-white soapy head. As it settles, there is decent patchy lace. It has a warm hoppy aroma that is both earthy and citrus-like. I taste light malts at first, but the big hops come in quickly. They are oily and bitter. It has a great pale ale flavor. The beer is served at cellar temperature, which I think helps it a lot. I wouldn't want this one too cold. It possesses a medium body and low carbonation. A small coat is left on my tongue. It's a very drinkable beer. This is my second glass of the evening.

Barely heard a sound when I opened the can, which made me think it may have been flat, but it produced a small froth. Poured from the can it has a nice white head on it that slowly shrinks down leaving minimal lacing. Not much stuck to the glass beyond the initial layer, actually. Honey colored. Hint of dry crackers in the aroma. Balanced aroma of some grain and hops. Tastes hoppier than it smells. Seems a bit off balance to me, though I'm admittedly not a hophead. Light bodied, with low to moderate carbonation. This is something I probably couldn't make a session out of, but sometimes I'm looking for that lasting hop flavor. It really has more hop flavor than actual bitterness. Late hopping could be the reason. My biggest issue is the discrepancy between balance in flavor and aroma.

As far as I'm concerned, this is an IPA, but I guess Dale's India Pale Ale doesn't have the same ring to it. In fact, it's bitter hoppiness is enough to make me only want a couple Dale's in one sitting.

The flavor is sort of opposite of the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and falls right down the middle, not heavy or watery. The bitter hops coat the tongue for a good while after the swallow, and there's a nice lacing on the inside of the glass.

Pale malts that have a certain graininess in the flavor are joined by herbal and mild citrus hop flavors midway through the sip. As the beer warms the same butteriness that is exhibited in the smell enters the flavor profile however it's not intense enough to be debilitating and may even help pull the flavors together.

4.03,3.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Thanks to jgasparine for this brew! 12 ounce can, canned on 3/17/2010. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is pretty good, and there is lots of lacing left on the glass after drinking this brew. Aroma is pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops. Taste is mostly pine and citrusy hops, along with some sweet and bready malt. There's also a little bit of a lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. Too bad this isn't available in Ohio, because I'd buy it whenever I was in the mood for an APA if it was.

I do from time to time get Dale into a glass but the fact is I enjoy this one near the grill straight from the can. When poured Dale takes a soapy topped head of a near white resting atop of what reminds me of my Grandmother's sun tea. The smell of hops piny, grassy and full of citric delight is much more present when not from the can. The hop bitterness and aromas are aplenty so feel free and drink from the can if you are so inclined by convenience. Caramel and grapefruit combine with ease. Sweet grain reminds you that this is no light pale ale ...this is Dale . The finish is bitter hops with light caramel and grain. The medium body compliments the medium carbonation.

Hop taste is a combination of moderate carbonation and bitter hops, both combining effects while remaining smooth and drinkable. The almost overwhelming hop presence without having a strong, lasting aftertaste of the hops allows it to be drinkable, although not as much as it would be if it were a bit less hoppy.

The hop bitterness attacks the entire tongue and pallet, leaving no taste bud untouched. I have an affinity for canned beers that pack a hop punch...they give me a great opportunity to drink beer for breakfast while fishing, camping, etc. Oskar Blues does a great job on this brew and I couldn't be happier with its drinkability, ie. its relatively modest ABV for its style.","ArrogantDeadGuy","Feb 05, 2010"

This is one of my go-to beers considering how it is full of taste and not overly expensive. Taste is rich and tangy with a nice bitterness from the hops. Very citrusy and full of grapefruit. The bitterness sits on the back of the tongue as the citrus dances around the front. The hint of malts gets this beer down quite smoothly. Very delicious. Nice mouthfeel on this APA as well, nice and crisp. Has a smooth backbone as well that settles down the crispness from carbonation. Goes down easy, provides huge amounts of aromas and tastes.

Smells mostly malty to me with a hop (piney) backbone, a decent balance but I pick up mostly pale malts. The smell is certainly deceiving to the taste, it is a bit weak, not much going on I guess. Taste is better than the smell. A huge kick of malts to start off, perfectly balanced by a BLAST of hops in the after taste. I feel like there is only one hop used here and LOTS of it, it kicks you in the mouth in the aftertaste. The can is not lying about it being hoppy. Some sweetness can be detected on the palatte asides from the malts, a good kind. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation, creamyness, and a huge coat of hops left on the tongue, no alcohol taste but a tiny bit of warming in this one. Drinkability is good here, good taste and the price for it is not bad, the only thing I am worried about is the hop backbone overtaking the palette if I have a few of these, other than that no off flavors or over alcohol will kill this one. Maybe I'll buy this one if I want an overly hopped pale ale for a decent price.","cbutova","Oct 06, 2009"

3.35,-13.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours clear, dark orange in color, about a two-finger yellowish light tan head. Smells of sweet floral notes, some caramel, a touch of orange rind. The taste at first is a bit herbal, with some nice sweet malts, then a bitterness creeps up that reminds me of biting into an orange rind almost. It has a sort of intesity to the bitterness that has a hint of citrus and some sweet malts. Sticky, slightly biscuity finish is not crisp like I would desire. For a pale ale I find it a bit harsh without a lot of aroma hops there to balance it out. Quite malty for an American pale. Medium bodied with a comparatively high carbonation. Decent stuff, though I am fairly surprised that this has so much bitterness without an equal aroma, and also at how malty this one is. No real outstanding aspects here for me.","vacax","Sep 28, 2009"
4.17,7.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Two finger plus head of airy foam, the surface dimpled even without too many larger bubbles, not that much lacing but what's there is super sticky. Light amber orange color with a vague gauzy translucency, more yellow at the outermost edges. The nose definitely has a ""nip at your heels"" quality, cut wet green grass alongside pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus as well as floral blossoms and some pine oil, the malts expressed as cocoa and chocolate powder, smooth in a non-showy manner. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is lowkey and firms up the mouth feel rather than add unnecessary flash. The pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime citrus drier but no less dominant. Grassy in a tickly way, like a blade drawn across the bottom of your foot. Any maltiness pretty much gets its lunch money taken at recess. Some pine and mint, pinch of white pepper too. Vibrant from start to finish, hyper-actualized pale ale which one might argue exceeds the category.","farrago","Sep 28, 2009"

There's some malt sweetness, as well. The flavor is hoppy without being overly bitter. They've hit a really nice balance with this beer, though it's definitely hoppy for a pale.

4.45,14.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"This is one of my favorite, if not my favorite, pale ales. Simply put, I had a CRAVING for this beer this week. The six pack I bought, though nearly 10.50 and a bit dated at nearly 3 plus months didn't disappoint. Is it the can? Or kudos to my local shop for keeping it refrigerated? Anyway, an aggressive pour leaves a two finger head that leaves satisfying amounts of lace by the third pint. The malt is caramel and sweet, but the hop profile is where this beer just shines. It is balanced. The almost brown sugar malt base is perfectly matched with the tangy, citrusy hoppiness. Disappears dangerously fast from my standard pint glass. Flavor abounds and is complex enough to keep you drinking. I love this pale ale! Well done Oskar Blues.","tchurchill7","Sep 17, 2009"

Not only is it a very good example, I feel like it's a very drinkable one. The mouth feel is a little thick and I know that after too much time, or a few of these, it becomes cloying.

Since the smell was rather muted, I was pleasantly suprised by the bitingly bitter taste up front which then mellowed in to a fuity hop.

A bit heavy on the caramel, which gives a bit of english flavor to this... overall with the presentation, and the philosophy behind why they put it in a can- to give campers/climbers/boaters/hikers an opportunity to carry this thing in, and not leave trash.

4.22,8.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"A very good beer that lives up to the hype. The tap delivers a well-carbonated copper hue with firm, froathy head formation and great retention- lots of lacing on the glass. A mild has persists, likely from dry-hopping. Aromas of abundant hops- a lot of grapefruit, orange zest, pine, and lemon grass. A firm malt backbone follows with low-lying sweetness and hints of bready crusts. Low fruitiness from esters and low phenolics. Flavors bring about a crisp malty flavor with low sweetness (only to balance). The hops are definately showcased with a burst of flavors like those found in the nose. The malts round out the hops with light fruitiness (kinda English-like only better attenuated). The body is medium, yet firm with a crisp, malty snappyness. Finishes with a clean, dry, hoppy note. On par with Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale.","BEERchitect","Nov 06, 2008"

On the heavy side of medium bodied with moderate carbonation - flirting with viscosity without hitting it or losing drinkability.

So besides my environmental lean, I don't think the can takes away from the beer. It is a very good pale ale. I have had their Old Chub and would rate it as the best Oskar beer, but Dales is solid. Nothing exceptional for a pale ale, but well above average. I have had a lot of IPAs and I would still rate this as a pale ale; the hops is not overwhelming.","bheilman","Sep 20, 2008"

3.69,-5.1,3,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Poured from a can, served at Moan and Dove. The appearance was a little average: no real head or lacing; overall light brown mixed with amber. The aromas were decently well for a canned beverage: medium fruit aromas and hops. The taste was more sour in flavoring and lacked a hoppiness typical of a pale ale. However, its lightness in the hop department was relatively heavy for something in a can. And that is probably why I rate it high in mouthfeel: for something like a pale ale, the can helps it be light and refreshing.

Some produced a pale that had a smooth butteriness. Overall, I would guess that there were 3 or 4 different batches out of this 12-pack, running the gamut of what the batches would taste like.

The taste isnt the strong hop flavor that was expected, but more subtle citrusy notes, along with a creamy buttery malt flavor. Mouthfeel is much smoother, with the balance of malts.

That odd resiny sweetness also found in Gordon appears here as well. The hops are mostly citrus and pine, but defenitely some spiced hop flavors in here. The malt presence is strong and profound, but defenitely does not outdo the hops. Very balanced, if anything I would say tone down the maltiness a bit to get rid of a bit of that caramely sweetness, but it is nice to see a pale ale that leans that way instead of the common west coast ""hop the shit out of everything"" mentality. Not to say that this brew is not generously hopped, because it is. Mouthfeel is good, quite viscous, could maybe be a bit thinner. Drinkability is fantastic, very sessionable.

The flavor profile isn't quite a vibrant as the nose, but it still has balanced flavors of flowery (at sometimes pungent) C-hops and a sugar-cookie malt base rounds everything out nicely.

The aftertaste is a little sweet with maltiness that comes through after the bitter flavors hit your tongue.

The color was a beautiful deep amber with NE-quality clarity. The mouthfeel was thin-to medium with a tasty hops tang in the mouth. The finish was where the pine taste that I noted on the nose really asserted itself. There was also a gritty feeling in my mouth after the swallow, which I will attribute to the drying quality of the hops. It was not unpleasant, but it was notable. This was the first of their four canned products that I have tried, so I wish to reserve judgment on drinkability for an update once I have tried them all.

Pours a copper, amber, golden hue with minimal frothy head that dissipated after a minute or so... smell was complete with hop-like aromas - bursting through, very fresh, crisp, clean, and clear... I must say that this is a very drinkable brew... with the relatively modest ABV of 6.5% combined with its ultra-fresh and refreshing flavor, this is quite a depiction of an American Pale Ale... good, creamy mouthfeel combined with a hopped, vanilla, and bittersweet taste leads to a great brew...

The fact that a brew this good is in a can and does come from a can truly makes me think a lot of other breweries could pull this off, but I'm not sure why they don't try. I wish I could try the Ten Fidy, so let many of us hope it gets a higher distro rate in the future, if they keep making it that is.

The taste was pretty good, with just enough hops to make it above average, yet drinkable enough to not be a hop bomb. This is the kind of beer that I enjoy.

I, of course, think that it's the best thing in a can that is out there, and one of my favorite hoppy brews overall. If you like hops, then this will double the size of your hop head. Sure it's unbalanced, but that is the appeal of the APA- an overhopped IPA. Am I right? And to validate my opinion, I had this beer on a non-hyped recomendation of a liquor store owner on my visit to the Carolina's- I'd never even heard of it before then.

Just lacks a even flow. It's like the beer is yelling out, ""Hey! I'm a micro brew in a can! Woo hoo!"" Feel is a little lighter than I'd want. Overall I have to drop the drinkability down because the hops are too harshly over-pronounced and it lacks balance.

Piney scent is up front with very little malt presence in nose. At first the flavor shows that the nose promised, but where I usually expect a pale ale to either give me more hop flavor or open up for some complexity, the flavor just gives way to a watery finish.

Very clean, smooth malt flavors in the mouth, but the focus here is clearly the explosion of hop taste and bitterness. A dry beer with an emphasis on humulus lupulus, Dales Pale is quite drinkable and enjoyable for all, especially hopheads. I must comment once more about how much I like the canning movement. Environmentally sound and economically sound I imagine, I hope more craft brewers get on this and produce more killer beers in cans. Its part of beer advocacy.

The smell is a crisp citrus hoppiness. There is also a sweetness of caramel malt that is detectable after some of the hop aromas settle down later in the drink. The taste starts with a citrus kick and finishes with a somewhat abrasive bitterness that lingers. The carbonation is on the higher and more coarse level, probably teaming up with the bitterness to leave that aftertaste.

Taste is everything I want and look for in an APA; sweet, fruity and sticky caramel malts balanced by tons of aromatic domestic hops.

I don't know the advantages or disadvantages of each specifically, but I do know that opening a bottle has a better sound than a can. Once I pour it into a pint glass though, it looks much better. There is a thick white head on a crystal clear amber body. There is a surprising caramel aroma that is actually more powerful than the piney hop aroma. The caramel flavor is very present in the flavor as well. The initial flavor is mostly caramel and biscuity and then the hop bitterness comes in to play. The bitterness isn't accompanied by any real hop flavor though, so the balance seems off and it is really bothering me. Also, according to the BJCP, APA's shouldn't have much caramel flavor. Going with the ""Style be dammed"" train of thought, I would have to say that the only thing I can hold against this beer is the hop imbalance, but I'm not crazy about it.","drseamus","Mar 16, 2007"

First off I did not think the can would pour as well as it did. Beautiful rich orange color, with lots of haze, and visible streams of carbonation coming up from the bottom. Big white, frothy head slowly faded to leave about a half inch that stayed until the end. Big time sticky lace all down the glass. Smell was very crisp, lots of citrus flavors and some hints of grass or fresh leaves. As it warmed some more grain and earthy bread like smells became apparent. The taste was very light, crisp, refreshing. This beer absolutly screamed sessionable at me, could drink this year round anytime of day, was perfect with dinner(ham) and just very enjoyable. Taste was predominantly the hoppy side, grapefruit and pineapple as well as hints at some pine freshness. This was balanced out very nicely with hints at grain and yeast flavors. I actually detected a bit of green apple too which was very nice. Big dry finish with a long lingering bitter aftertaste made this a keep. I was very happy with this brew and will not shy away from the can. I actually think more beer could be in cans, as it seemed to make for a better pour, and shipping and storage were much easier.

Big metallic notes from the get-go. Very mouthfilling, very big beer, with tons of bitterness for a pale ale, a lot of carbonation, and just enough sweet malts for a touch of balance (although it's swayed way toward hop bitterness). It's not until the finish that this beer shows any smoothness... but even after that the hops pop up for another go-round, lingering on the palate with spiky citrus notes.

The hops and malt are soft however and preserve a pale ale flavor rather than the relative sharpness of an IPA. The hops are much more flavorful than suggested by the aroma- nice bitter hit here followed by a grainy maltiness and a light stone fruit flavor. The mouthfeel is quite thick and grainy for a pale ale, but its not unpleasant. This does make it a little more filling and less of a session beer than it might be.

The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with medium body and good carbonation. There was a light hoppiness and maltiness in the finish. This was a good pale ale.

The nose is very malty, more then typical in a pale ale, but due to the abundance of barley used in this beer. The bitterness of this beer tastes high for an APA, but the huge malt proportion balances out the bitterness and results in a very big tasting beer. The hops have a piney character and the malt has a chewy sweetness, honey almost raisiny malt, similar to Dogfishs 90 Minute IPA or Raison dEtre. The mouthfeel is substantial, medium-fullbodied and chewy, somewhat creamy at the beginning due to the monstrous head. This is a tremendously drinkable beer, even at the 6.5% abv.

The taste is interesting; it hits you right up front with the grinding, aggressive hop taste and kind of buzzes along through the sip without mellowing out. Hmm. It's an earthy/dirty sort of hop flavor, but in combination with the beefy body, it works.

Dales is a hop heads APA, in fact, its more along the lines of an IPA if you ask me. Plenty of juicy, citrusy hops and that undercurrent of semi-sweet malts makes this an easy drinker for sure.

4.13,6.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Hell yeah! Oskar Blues beers (Dale's Pale Ale and Old Chub, at least) are available at Consumer's on Transit in Williamsville! Picked up a sixer today. Can art is a bit different: Blue background, red and white logo with mountain landscape in the background -- no bricks or whatever that is on the picture here. Pours a bright copper with frothy soy-milk-colored head. Citric aromas of grapefruit and pine sap blended with a sweetish biscuity malt scent. Taste is extremely hoppy for an American Pale Ale; astringent grapefruit and tangerine flavors abound. There is nevertheless a strong malt backbone, biscuity and caramelly. Lovely hop-tinged burps. Much more like an IPA, in my opinion. Smooth, juicy mouthfeel and medium-light body. Quite drinkable, just don't agree that it's an APA. I'm super excited that this is available in Buffalo now -- I've been wanting to try this for a while and thought I'd have to wait until my next trip to Denver. Not so!","orfeu","May 05, 2006"

So long as it arrives fresh, and it tastes good, then I am happy. This beer pours an orangey amber color, with a bubbly head that doesn't ever completely recede. It is a classic APA: all hops. In terms of taste, it might be closer to an IPA, but the classification isn't really all that important because the styles are pretty much the same anyways. There is a strong, puckering hops taste that finishes with a delicious fruitiness that lingers. I would reccomend this beer regardless of its packaging.","bignick","Mar 28, 2006"

Hop aromas all over the place. Absolutely amazing. In my opinion, certainly closer to an IPA. The numbers would support as well at 60+ IBU's and 6.5% ABV. Wickedly drinkable. May be a bit high in alcohol for a session brew, but it won't stop me from trying. This may very well be my favorite IPA. I love the fact that one of the reasons these guys are canning is because it made them laugh. I was the one laughing at a party I went to when people thought I was drinking ""generic beer"".

The can calls it a ""voluminously hopped mutha of a pale ale."" Let's hope they're right. It pours smoothly from the wide mouth an unfiltered orange/amber color with lots of visible carbonation leading up to a frothy 2 finger khaki/yellow head that is very sticky and leaves nice lacing throughout. It smells citric (lemon, grapefruit) with pine and some hop oils. The first taste reveals sweet, almost buttery/nutty malts, with caramel, perhaps some earth, and a medium bitterness from the hops which are grapefruit, orange, pine, perhaps soapy, and there's also an apricot quality in there. The body is just right - medium, carbonated, but not overly so, and soooo smooth, even when very cold and drunk straight from the can. On top of that, I'm having grapefruit burps from a CANNED BEER! I can't believe the quality - it tastes so fresh and goes down so easily. This beer screams session ale - I had to struggle to keep a couple to drink the next day.

Retention is decent and some clingy patch lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is assertive, with prominent malty notes of fresh toffee and caramel. Fruity hops add accents of grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and some chewy malt. Taste is sturdy, with lots of sweet malty caramel and toffee, and an equally powerful menu of tropical fruit bitterness, mostly pink grapefruit. Lots of flavor, and well balanced. More like an American Amber than an APA, but an excellent and very drinkable brew no matter what it is. I'm convinced that canned microbrews work just fine.","merlin48","Jul 03, 2005"
3.26,-16.2,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Basically, if I were going camping, I'd bring this along by the six pack, but I probably wouldn't buy it any other time. Might be a good beer to take along to a party where lots of swill will be consumed (assuming you don't want to stand out too much). Maybe I will buy some to take to the family fourth of July this weekend... nah, they already know I'm a snob =)","AndIWantYou","Jun 29, 2005"
3.92,0.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A novelty item: a large, hoppy ale that comes in a can. Presentation aside, this is a good beer with lots of hops and lots of malt (a baby barleywine, if you will) that is probably not entirely deserving of the attention it's gotten due to coming in a can. Color is deep amber, difficult to see through, with a healthy dollop of thick head atop, and firm, arched lacing down the sides of the glass. Aroma is fragrantly sweet, like bubble gum and wild flowers, equal shares of malt and hop. The same is true for the taste, with big sweet caramel wood-varnish malts and grapefruit hops that are equally matched dance partners. Mouthfeel is full, like pulpy OJ or peachy iced tea, and the drinkability is quite good for a beer this size. Towards the finish, a sour lactic, earth-laden, almost metallic flavor is the sole niggling kernel of doubt about the can format, but it could be a by-product of yeast. Worth a shot, especially if you require cans for some reason. (Upon popping the can, which feels a little flimsy, a shot of beer may shoot out and either spray your hand or deposit itself on the counter. Also, you will probably not want to tip the glass during the pour if you want any head at all; if you don't tip, the head will be full, thick, creamy, and lace-inducing, and it won't come over the edges of the pint glass.)","Thrasher","Jun 13, 2005"

There was a large frothy head with a decent amount of lacing. There is good hop aroma, with mainly grapefruit notes. Nice bitter taste, with a suprisingly light sweetness in the aftertaste. This is a really decent beer. Can you bring this to CT? Thanks for the beer, Jay!","Boto","May 09, 2005"
4.42,13.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A clear orange-amber body rests gently beneath a short head of white that holds well and leaves some very nice lace about the glass. The nose delivers a combination of bright, fruity (more orange than grapefruit) and mildly piney hops along with a splash of yeasty fruitiness and a base of sweetish malt. It's crisp in the mouth without being overly aggressive, and it fades smoothly and cleanly from the palate. The flavor is bold, to say the least, and seems to add a light touch of diacetyl to it's already rich and fairly complex profile. It's exceptionally well balanced by a solid bitterness that allows its malt sweetness to shine before drying in the finish; and it's delicately pine-like hop flavors linger in the finish along with a touch of doughy maltiness. Quite nice! This beer deserves far more attention than it gets (and the fact that it's available in a can is a complete bonus!). Go get some!!!","NeroFiddled","May 06, 2005"
4.17,7.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Overall an excellent pale ale, more towards IPA territory (and a good one at that). It has the excellent mix of fruitiness and piney hops that I love. Very well balanced.","Beaver13","Apr 28, 2005"

Even out of the can the smell of fresh northwest hops was intense. Unfortunatly the hops are completely over the top in the flavor of this beer, overpowering everything else. Don't know why they chose to call this a pale ale. It would be over the top for an IPA. The mouth feel was harsh, despite the light carbonation. Wouldn't drink another. A shame, because their Old Chub is outasight.","mrgrandefromage","Apr 10, 2005"

3.67,-5.7,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability  Theyd call this an IPA in many parts of the country. I would have liked to have seen a bit bigger body to go with the massive hop bitterness, but if you like hoppy bitter brews youll enjoy this one. Its probably the hoppiest beer that you can drink right down then crush the container flat against your forehead (all the while singing, Louie, Louie, of course).","RoyalT","Jan 21, 2005"

Its a light copper body with a good head. Theres a bit of caramel and citrus rind hops in the aroma. A touch of grass. Very fresh tasting hops. A bit of lingering bitterness in the flavor. Very good.","aracauna","Nov 22, 2004"

More malt than a lot of pale ales Ive joyfully encountered lately. A very good one too. Surprisingly big body, chewy malts, and an appetizingly bitter finish. More reminiscent of a good, malty IPA. The best beer Ive ever had from a can? Probably so far!","alexgash","Oct 23, 2004"
3.71,-4.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Hmmm a canned beer that is supposed to be good? Definitely worth a try so I can have something to break to places that dont allow bottles if it is indeed good. This poured out of the can a slightly hazy copper color with a tall rising rocky off white head of foam. Pretty good retention and it left big chucks of foamy lace around the glass as it was drank, very appetizing appearance. Aroma is made up of mainly a strong citric hop smell that is backed by slightly doughy malt. Not to complex but a solid nose. The grapefruit hop flavor is what comes through at the front of the taste with piney notes and a bitter finish. A bit of caramel malt peeks through as well when this warmed up a bit, add a touch of depth to the taste that makes for a balanced pale ale. Good medium mouthfeel with sufficient carbonation. I am fairly impressed with this beer, while not the best tasting pale ale it is all around solid and a great canned beer.","meathookjones","Aug 16, 2004"

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a bright clear copper color with a tan well proportioned head. An aroma of American hops (grapefruit, citrus, and pine) plus some un-recognizable weird aroma that quickly fades. A nice sharp pale ale that finishes with a nice bitterness and it has lots of hop flavor. Definitely hop dominated, though there is a bit of biscuity maltiness in here, as well as some sweet malt character. This is definitely a well crafted pale ale that I would be happy to take on a camping trip. As my palate becomes used to this beer I get a solid contribution from crystal malt. It starts in the middle and goes through to the finish.","Gueuzedude","Apr 20, 2004"
4.22,8.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Don't let the can fool you - this is a damn fine pale ale. Poured out a golden orange with a slight haze and a solid bubbly head. Aroma of floral & citous hops, perhaps a slight mango tinge to it. Taste is very clean & refreshing. The hop characteristics that dominate the aroma don't show up like crazy in the taste, rather we have a fairly citrousy, decently malted, very bitter brew. The grapefruity bitterness shows up in the finish, just where you want it. Mouthfeel is clean and smooth with a low carbonation factor. Drinkable? All day long. If you enjoy pale ale's or IPA's, don't pass on this one. A good, solid pale ale and immensly refreshing.","avylover","Apr 16, 2004"
3.85,-1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Clear bronzy-coppery in hue, it is a lovely color; the white head reached a modest half a finger in height. The retention was decent, it turn to a soapy residue. The subsequent lacing was messy and webby. The nose is stereotypical APA, which is fine by me, the hops are soft but citrusy, some flowers too, the maltiness is soft with caramel notes and there is a pleasant hint of sweetness, ale fruitiness as well. I really like the bouquet on this Pale Ale, simple but very inviting. The palate is very respectable, good, crisp hops bitterness upfront that imparts a grapefruit flavor, it is a little raw and Im digging that, flowery, the malt adds good balance and a bit of flavor, toasty-bread and caramel. I could also detect a note of brown sugar and leafiness. The finish is appropriately dry. This is a nice little Pale Ale here, ordinary but good. Medium in body with firm enough carbonation, the mouthfeel is a little too rigid but it is acceptable. I found it to be quite drinkable and on par with the countless middle of the road APAs. Maybe I bought this because I wanted to try a micro from a can, maybe it is a gimmick and I fell for it, maybe not. Maybe the future of craft beer is here! Anyway, I wish I could get it locally. Go ahead and buy it for the novelty but youll enjoy it because there is a tasty beer housed in that aluminum. I purchased a single can for $1.49 in Fort Collins.","bditty187","Mar 22, 2004"

To me this tasted like a bit less flavourful SNPA. Nice and hoppy with just enough malt to balance. The hops add a nice dry finish to the beer. Drinkability is good as this would be a pretty good session brew especially when outdoors where glass is not allowed. While some may question the practise of canning this beer, I think it's great. Finally a beer you can take out where no glass is allowed and not have to suffer drinking swill. Plus the cans look so different you could probably walk down the beach or street and not get a second look drinking out of it.","TinusTime","Dec 19, 2003"
3.65,-6.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Flavors were modest. Tastes of sweet malts and very hoppy with flavors of grapefruits possible of other citrus fruits from the hops. Very dry and well hopped. Very bitter and not sweet like some.","Crosling","Dec 06, 2003"
4.12,5.9,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a translucent amber color with the head large, creamy and an off white color with the lace forming a tight skirt around the glass. Sweet malt nose reinforced by some floral spiciness from the hops, crisp, clean, fresh, Marvelous. Front is thick malt, sweet and pleasing to the palate with the top moderate in its feel. Finish is lenient in its acidity, the hops powerful in their bite, quite dry aftertaste that is semi-sweet and a real pleasure to quaff.","Gusler","Nov 30, 2003"

The beer is nice looking, honey in color, with a little head. The aroma has some definite fruitiness along with the the floral hops and sweet aroma of malts. A thin feeling beer but it the taste of this beer is purdy darn good, the spicy fruit flavors accompanied by a not too strong sweet maltiness, and the good presence of hops leaves a little bite at the end. A very drinkable brew.","BigHead","May 02, 2003"
