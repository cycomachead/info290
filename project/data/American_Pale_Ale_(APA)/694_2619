Aromas of subtle floral notes, bittering hops, and a toasted backbone. Flavors are heavily roasted forward, with a solid dose of resinous hops, pepper spice, floral notes, and a toast backbone. Light and crisp bodied, with a tangy sweet and slightly bitter aftertaste. The finish is dry, smooth, and clean. Pretty tasty and damn drinkable.","GarthDanielson","Nov 19, 2014"

4.19,10.8,4,3.75,4.5,4,4.25,"BOD 8/17/14.  Clear light amber pour that is slightly darker than golden.  Very nice head with normal lacing and retention. Light nose of citric and floral hops over a light biscuit.  Light medium bodied with an almost slick texture.  Perfectly carbonated with an exceptional effervescent finish.  The flavor profile is exceptional - intense, balanced, clean and somewhat complex.  It begins with a wave of blended hop flavor (pine, citric and a touch of spice) over a light biscuit background.  The middle is a medium bitterness that is mostly pine, but also has grapefruit rind aspects,  which fades into a very light caramel.  The finish is quite effervescent and yields a nice dryness.   A mild bitterness lingers that has a bit of pepper and caramel sweetness.  An outstanding Pale Ale.","tillmac62","Oct 05, 2014"

The balance is very nice with this beer and it drinks smooth. It will appeal to a lot of drinkers I think. The very last thing on the palate is that of chewing on fresh barley malt. The biscuit and bread crust flavors seem to shine through a well hopped beer. I will buy more of this.","slusk","Jul 13, 2014"

3.98,5.3,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Pours clear and golden with some friendly bubbles coming up from the bottom. A faint finger plus a little more of foam that fell pretty fast to some sticky lace. Nose is amiable, bright with cascade hops, juicy and fruity with some grass underneath. Malt is deliciously sweet on the nose with biscuit, bread and honey. Taste is crisp, light with a mild astringency and a grainy aspect of the malt sweetness. Broad leafy hops give a touch of bitter and a kiss of orange while the malt stays ample and sweet. This is an enlivening pale ale that keeps it’s bitterness in check leaving the palate open to a variety of foods. So far Troegs is a go to brewery for good session beers","utopiajane","Jun 09, 2013"

Preferably they would imbibed indoors in the AC. At first this beer is not at all that bitter but by the end of the glass there is an aftertaste for sure making this a tough beer to recommend as a transition beer from pee-water but making it an excellent example of an APA! This one is tough to score. I don't like the slimy feeling on my tongue and will have to take points for that but all in all, EXCELLENT! 4 out of 5!!","WissBrauSean","May 27, 2013"

It relies perhaps a bit too much on its hop profile, as so many APAs these days do. I found the sweetness (crystal malt?) to be a touch off-putting too. A little bit more malt character would go a long way, as would a less heavy-handed dose of hops. Still a refreshing quaff, and worth a try.","ryan1788a5","Sep 20, 2012"

3.97,5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This is a good solid mix of a pale ale that doesn't try to be a borderline IPA hop bomb. Lets the malt come through and eventually dominate but gives enough presence to make a statement. Easy drinking as well. Solid Pale Ale here.","smakawhat","Aug 28, 2011"
3.97,5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured a 1.5"" white head. Clear color is golden verging on amber. Smell has malt plus an interesting floral aspect to the hops. Taste is far richer than either the smell or my expectations prepared me for. The hop bitterness carries through in the aftertaste and is refreshing. There's also a slight acidic zing to the beer which perks me up. Quite a respectable pale ale.","MoreThanWine","Aug 21, 2011"

Bready caramel sweetness supports a bold fruity hop layer. More of the same hop characters from the nose. Finish has a light bitterness that sits on top of the malty body well. The fruity hop character is what makes this beer. Enjoyed a six pack while hanging out with some friends I haven't seen in a while. Goes down smooth, easy drinking.","DrinkingDrake","Aug 13, 2011"

Having it again was really nice though. The beer poured out as a golden orange color. The head was white and fizzy and leaves just a bit of lacing on the glass. The smell has a nice sweet hoppy aroma to it. The taste is a very good, nicely balanced with hops and malts. The mouthfeel of the beer is a also very nice, it's smooth and bubbly, very drinkable brew. Overall I found the Pale Ale to be quite nice on most levels. I almost wanted to bring home a growler of it but chose the Flying Mouflan instead.","Knapp85","Jul 30, 2011"

Pours a bubbly light orange with a 1/2 inch foamy head, that dissipates to a thin head that stays throughout. Smell is a floral cascade of hops, with hints of malt and wheat.

4.08,7.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"It's like they took a standard APA, added the sweetness of some ambers and the toastiness of a pils. Interesting mix. It does say it's a ""copper APA"". Very tasty stuff, actually. Exceptionally easy to drink.","NODAK","Jul 24, 2011"
3.92,3.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Bottled on May 19, 2011. Dark yellow in color with a touch of red and perfect clarity. Poured with a frosty white head that quickly reduced to a wispy cap that leaves nice sticky lacings on the glass. Floral hop aroma with a touch of citrus orange and lemon hop aromas balanced nicely with bready malt. Medium bodied with assertive, biting carbonation. Nice balance of bready and toasted malts with herbal citrus and pine hop flavor from the beginning thru the middle. Malt flavor stays consistent through the finish as hop character transitions from herbal to lightly piney. Finishes crisp and dry with a light bitter aftertaste. Very easy to drink.","IronLover","Jul 24, 2011"
3.43,-9.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer pours a clear, bubbly, pale orange, huge two-finger head that lasts only briefly. Smells of wheat or grain, a bit of hops and a bit of malt. Taste is a bit more hoppy than malty but not by much. Has some sweetness to it but refreshingly so. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry, really nice and the best part of the beer in my opinion.

The aroma is faint a sweet malt backbone with a floral and citrus hop bite in the middle and end. Good aroma but faint. The taste has a bigger sweet malt backbone more pronounced then I thought it would be. At the backend is a floral and citrus hop bite. The bite brings balance and isn't in your face or tongue.

They CAN't all fall bright, I suppose. Nose was hop-forward with a soft grassiness that again started me to sweating. The CANQuest (TM) has had me drinking a lot of AmeriCAN Adjunct Lagers and I simply miss hops as a result. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a mildly understated grassy hop taste on the tongue. My hop jones monkey began to cease his incessant chattering. I began to feel some maintenance drinking upcoming that weekend.

Again, the malt character is present almost as a mild bread and a little caramel. Sweetness is low, and the hops are very well expressed. The bitterness slowly grows, lingering on into the finish with a blend of grapefruit and candied oranges. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this is a treat on the palate.

3.77,-0.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. I feel it should be called Very Pale Ale, it was bright yellow close to a yellowish pilsner type color. Good clarity on it. There is about a half inch white head that slowly fades and provides some better than average lacing to it. The smell is good, when you crack it open you can tell it's pretty hoppy, by far the dominant feature in the aroma. Citrus, floral notes, and a little bit of pine. All in all smells like a good pale ale. The taste is good, not an aggressive pale ale, but good. In my opinion it's more of a pine hop in the flavor than anything else. There's a sweetness from the malts that make it pretty well balanced, but mild overall, still good. Mouthfeel is good, it has a clean, crisp, bitter finish. Good carbonation level. Very drinkable goes pretty quickly. I like this Pale Ale, very reliable. I can't say I'd go out of my way to get it or drink it again, but I'd certainly get it if available. I don't know why, but I really want to try it on tap.","AndyAvalanche","Sep 18, 2010"

It tastes resiny overall, without the sweetness of the aroma. The ample bitterness carries into the aftertaste. The malt flavor is pretty discreet and perhaps a touch melanoidal. Compared to a Sierra Nevada Pale, this seems more English in style but it's still solidly American. It would make a solid session ale.","yesyouam","Jun 13, 2010"

There is some malt and some hops to balance it. There is a little bit of bitterness in the finish. There is a little bit of butter to the flavor. The butteriness is really apparent in the mouthfeel. This is a slick, slippery beer. I don't really like the film it leaves behind. In fact, I'd say the buttery qualities negatively affect the overall drinkability.

Mostly sweet nose, grainy hops and cereal, vague swipe of orange/lemon citrus, softly floral but no pine notes, while not that much malt or cocoa evident, does end on a creamy note. Medium-bodied, the foaminess lends a fluffy cushion to the mouth feel, raises the sour dough, raw bread up off the palate and into the swirl above where the sourness is less present. Not much fruit, peach pit, apple or pear skin. Raw grains, oats, wheat, not herbaceous though. Dryness here eliminates much of any maltiness.

The aroma at first is all hops, very inviting cascade smell that reminds me of fresh hop leaves, almost the aroma from the remnants in the primary of a homebrewed pale or ipa . While that is the dominant aroma, I am picking up a slight background malt aroma that comes across a little sweet. The flavor is nice, again hops come to mind at first but I am also picking up a tea like flavor(??), maybe I am crazy but that flavor goes extremely well with this brew. Some malt there as well, roasted profile. The hops that I noticed at first are dominant but not overly as the flavor breaks and does not remain at the back of the tongue.

Overall, a generally above average beer in terms of brewing technique but I think they're a little confused on their definition of an APA.","wiseguy142","Dec 29, 2008"

4.03,6.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice copper color with a slightly off-white head. Smells hoppy, pine forest hoppy, not citrus hoppy. I've been having a lot of beers lately where the malt is followed by the hops in the taste department, this one kind of flips the script. Slammed into a pine tree at first sip, it mellows into biscuity malts by the end. I like it, is it the best beer in the world or even the best from Troegs? No, but it is an extremely solid effort and very sessionable, a few of these would disappear into my belly in no time.","SwiftyMcBeer","Dec 28, 2008"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a great offering from Troeg The beer pours a wonderful golden copper color with a bone white head. The taste up front is spicy pine hops but after that you get a nice subtle malty taste. The aroma is the same spicy hops with subtle malts. This is a very drinkable beer for sure. Almost and IPA in its hop.","mjmbeer","Dec 27, 2008"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"An amber color with touches of gold along the sides od the glass. About a half inch high head forms, cream in color, showing tremendous retention. At first scent you are hit with the strong aroma of grapefruit citrus fragrance along with with a grassy aroma. There is also the feint scent of malty mildness finishing off the aroma. That malt comes out at the front of each taste, mild in flavor, almost like a light to bland bread flavor. Then as it reaches the halfway point the hops take over, with grassy, earthy flavors at first, then finishing with a grapefruit bitterness. A light to medium bodied feel, light at the front and gaining weight as it crosses the palate. This is a solid, if not a very good pale ale. Very easy to drink,plus you can throw this at many different dishes and dinners.","cameraman","Dec 20, 2008"

Spotty chunky webbing sticks to the sides of the glass. Light pine and fresh citrus up front in the nose with a good dose of floral hops as well. Nice balancing caramel and pale malts in the aroma too. Taste starts off with pine and herbal hops with some bready characteristics. Toasted grains and biscuit flavors midway with a touch of lemon zest. Aftertaste is sweet and malty with a slight bitterness from the hops. Light to medium body with a crisp feel and a solid carbonation. This is what an APA should be. Good flavor, good balance, and easy drinking. I'm so glad Tröegs is finally available in Syracuse.

Light malt sweetness balanced with the citrusy bite of hops, fades to a grapefruit like aftertaste that does not dry the palate overmuch leaving the mouthfeel as lightly creamy and full. There's also slight buttery feel left in the mouth and something of pine or lemon rinds, though it's very faint. Not bad brew and seems to follow the style.

One of the better AIPAs, especially for the price, that I've sampled on the east coast. Mouthfeel is a little watery, but not a major detraction.

Malts were also very prevalant, providing a nice balance. Taste was about the same, although the malts were more evident than the hops, which was a little surprising. As I drank the beer more, the hops began to come out more to provide the nice balance to the malts that I had expected in the first place.

Grapefruit and other fruits in there too. Light caramel malt sweetness too. Lingering bitterness sits on the tongue for just a bit. Feel is thin to medium bodied with solid carbonation.

Also a slight grainy pine aroma as well comes through to me. Taste is bitter but smooth w/ grainy tasting grapefruit. Very citrussy w/ some slight sweetness of sugars throughout. However, not too complex in flavor. Feel is wonderful! Carbonation up front on the tongue gives way to a very smooth swallow and a very little alcohol burn.

An absolutely extraordinary American pale ale. Today, I could have sworn there were no Cascades hops in this one, as the flavors and aromas seemed so smooth and lush, bathed in apple, pear, lemon, and orange. I went to the brewery website to see what hops varieties were used, and, sure enough, it says Cascades. Some pine and grapefruit emerge at the finish, this time, but this is just so smooth and balanced most of the way through. Must be the Crystal Malt. This is now my favorite pale ale.

Color is very nice, bright (!) amber-to-honey colored, with orange highlights. Hop smell comes right out of the bottle; fruity hops are up front in the aroma, with a sweet, mellow orangey quality. For this review, I'm drinking this beer at a slighty higher temperature than usual, and the complexity of flavor has increased. Served cold, I recall more of a piney hop bite; this serving has a more distinct fruitiness to it. Subtle malt background, but the real show is the robust, resiny hops... is this halfway to an IPA? Very refreshing mouthfeel. Although a bit thin in body, that resiny hop character leaves a sticky bite that lingers. As for drinkability, I highly enjoy this by the six-pack, especially with that moreish, lip-smacking hop body.

A healthy sized enduring head with a nice collar of lace forming as the lace settles, and as the glass empties the lace continues to cling form scattered patterns within annular rings spaced nicely with each sip. In the aroma, cascades make the appearance with floral, grapefruit tones with some hops of the pine cone esque variety going on here all built upon a backbone of caramel buttered malted barley also coincides to form balance. Taste is primarily bittering hops with tones of pine cones, earthy dicotamous grittiness on the palate, but by no means is this beer a palate killer just a wonderful representation of a balanced pale ale. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body, on the thin side but the oily texture from hop resins adds a nice sensation to the consistency of the texture. Drinkability easily a session no beer brewed Troeg's is as a drinkable except for the Hopback, but if I couldn't get a keg of the Hopback Amber for my kegerator than I would go with this brew very nice.","WVbeergeek","Jun 06, 2003"

The invitation is not misleading awesomely hoppy palate, just raw enough, bitter and crisp, kisses of toasty malt leafy and dry finish.

Not a smack you around hoppiness like many AIPA's, but just a prominent, floral/citrus/soapy hoppiness. After a couple sips, the malt sweetness becomes apparent and really balances out this beer beautifully. A touch of bitterness on the finish leads to a lingering hop-laced sweetness on the aftertaste.

I would love to try this on tap. This is a killer Pale Ale, and it has far exceeded my expectations.","IrishRedRock","Mar 18, 2003"
4.2,11.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"An excellent offering. Orange/beige/deep ruby color with luminous white head. Other reviewers have said it and I agree--tons of grapefruit aromas here, there are other floral notes but they are completely dominated by the grapefruit. Flavor is extremely well balanced. Sweet malts in the back ground but sharp hops up front. Bitter but not puckering and slightly sweet but not 'mouth drying'. Medium body and creamy mouthfeel combine for a good mouthfeel. A good, easy drinking Pale Ale, one of the better I've had in this category.","allboutbierge","Beers"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Gold/copper in color with a very bubbly white head. Carbonation showed itself with some very fine bubbles constantly streaming to the top of the glass. Fruity and sweet flavors and aromas are dominant. Aroma also showed some pine-like smells. Beer finished slightly bitter, but the bitterness was not very evident in the main body of the beer. Very nice and quite enjoyable.","jreitman","0"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Troegs Pale Ale: I was very impressed with this brew, which was shipped as part of Mike Maddens care package. I knew this was something special when the strong and rich aroma hit me as I was pouring the bottle. Off white head (that left a thick lace down the sides of the glass) topped off a clear amber brew. The hops asserted themselves in the aroma, and dominated this very flavorful beer. There were hints of molasses malts, but not much to speak of. All in all this is a very well made beer.","jackndan","Nov 23, 2002"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Upon pouring this pale ale, the first thing I noticed was the smell. Grapefruits greeted me before I even had a chance to pour the bottle. A nice clear, copper color with spare carbonation bubbles filled my glass. The taste was dominated by a subdued hop bitterness, with a nice complement by the fruity esters. Great balance of malt and hop, and the grapefruit scent really adds to the taste experience, too. A very clean, crisp finish with lingering bitterness also adds something to this very good ale. Troegs has produced another fine product in this very drinkable and enjoyable Pale Ale. If it's available, I'm going to consider this next time I stop to get a sixer...perhaps even an entire case.","SchmichaelJ","Nov 19, 2002"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours to the glass in a goldish color that is crystal clear. The head is nice and large that lasts and it leaves a nice lace behind. The aroma is clean. Has hints of floral, citrus, grass, and malt. The taste is slightly sweet with overtones of citrus and flowers. Also there is a grassy appeal to it as well as hops and malt. Again this is a fresh and clean beer to the end.","Jarod","Oct 11, 2002"
3.92,3.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The pour a light crystal clear amber color. Head is frothy, mountainous, the lace lumbersome sheets that last till the end of the glass. Nose is malt, lightly floral, hints of citrus, clean and fresh. Front is malt, ambosial, the top light, the finish meaningfully hopped, thoughtfully acidic, mindfully dry. A quite pleasant beer, just right in all respects, wish I could have been nicer with the lager. Well worth the sample, and wish it was available here in Arizona. Ranks A deserving #484 on my current 1000 beer master list.","Gusler","Oct 03, 2002"
4.22,11.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Clear. Deep amber in color with an off-white head that holds well and leaves some nice lace. The aroma is boldly floral & citrusy! Very nice. The body is medium with a moderate carbonation that leaves it smooth and creamy in the mouth. The flavor is rich with a lightly caramel malt sweetness and lots of gentle citrus, floral & grassy hop flavors. Very well balanced with a bitterness that is solid enough to hold the beer in place, but restrained enough to let the sweetness of the malt and depth of the hop flavors come through. Finishes drying with some residual honey-like maltiness and swirls of hop flavor & bitterness. Excellent! A highly enjoyable and extremely drinkable beer with lots of character. Well brewed!","NeroFiddled","Jun 08, 2002"

4.35,15.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another really nice surprise from these guys. Amber colored, with a really nice full head that stayed for the whole glass. Cascade hops give it the typical floral & citrus APA aroma, but it's nicely balanced by the Belgian malts used in the brew. Taste is also well balanced, with a combination of citrus and a caramel sweetness, with a nice, bitter, refreshing finish. I am now a bona-fide Troegs fan.","mophie","Jan 22, 2002"
3.83,1.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Real nice lace on glass.  I have genuinely like every beer I have tried from Troegs to date.  Try some Troegs if you get the chance.  I have a feeling they may be hard to get outside of PA area though","bmills1608","Beers"
4.92,30.2,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"This is a truly great beer.  The cascade hops are well balanced with maltiness in this pale ale.  I like this better than SNPA and I love cascade hopped beers.  Availability is limited to the eastern PA area.","canoehornpoint","0"
