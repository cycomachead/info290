Maybe it was the caramel malts that were a bit out of lace here, but regardless, this was a good example of the style that would be a nice deviation from the more popular takes on this style that are more common. A bit more dry-hopped and full than I would have liked, I'd have this again to take a break from stronger and hoppier versions of an APA.","JerzDevl2000","Dec 03, 2014"

I'll probably get this brew again.","Caveworm","Jul 06, 2014"

Smells like piney hops and mild malt. Not an overpowering smell or taste. The taste starts out a little fruity but then a piney hop bitterness takes over mid drink. This beer doesn't seem to be very balanced. In a world of hoppy pale ales, this one doesn't quite stand out. But overall a decent offering.","Cory_Brown","Apr 22, 2014"

Nose is grass, leaf and herbal. Some grapefruit some forest and pine in back of that. Smells dry. Malt is biscuit, sweet bread and caramel. The malt nose sweetens as it warms with some pale honey. Taste is woody, earthy, both bitter and sweet. Semi dry. Malt base is sweet grain but doesnâ€™t round out. Hops are tangy with the classic cascade profile of grapefruit and pine. Body is a little thin and it drinks a little heavy with the carbonation. Itâ€™s unbalanced and watery. Iâ€™m looking for something as I drink and not finding it. The bitterness lingers but not well and the alcohol comes to the palate in the finish. This oneâ€™s forgettable.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Pours slightly hazy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, caramel, biscuit, floral, and light pine. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop and malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, caramel, biscuit, floral, and light pine. Slight floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, caramel, biscuit, floral, and light pine on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of hop and malt flavors; with good robustness of flavor and no cloying present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale ale. Nice balance of hop and malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 29, 2013"

3.9,7.4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,4," The taste has a slight pine bitterness from the hops with mild malt sweetness in the flavor which adds a slight caramel contrast to the light lemon zest flavor combined with the grapefruit aspect the hops add to the light fruity yeast element. The taste tapers to a more dry and bitter hop flavor in the final sips but is pretty balanced in general leaving a lingering hop acidity on the backside. Overall this is great - more of a west coast Pale in the sense it focuses more on hops and is a small version of the IPA in their repertoire, but juicy citrus and enjoyable drinkability for me -I like the freshness and would purchase this again.","Slatetank","May 23, 2013"

Smell has mild breadiness with an orange citrus hop. Some light caramel malt sweetness with a touch of fruitiness. Taste is hop forward with a tasty malt core that glues the light orange and bigger grapefruit hoppiness together. Hops are the star here in case you were wondering.

Aromas are huge with floral hops dominating the nose, with hints of citrus and toasty grains in the background. Tastes are bitter right from the start with loads of pungent grapefruit rind, pine, and floral hops dominating the palate with tons of astringency that's hard to get past. Some notes of caramel, toasted grain, and slight soapy character try to peek through, but the balance is way off for a pale ale. Mouth-feel is medium bodied but overly carbonated. Overall: I like hoppy beers, but balance is key to making them work. Not a complete failure here, but not exactly what I was hoping for either. The astringency and severely dry finish is too much for me.","barnzy78","Mar 29, 2012"

Faint aroma of caramel malt, very faint hops. Light to medium bodied. Light sweet and caramel malt followed by a dry non-aromatic hop finish.

Smell is pretty underwhelming with some malt and herbal hop aromas. Taste is also pretty average with a basic malt and herbal hop combo. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average pale ale in my opinion and I am not very impressed by this one.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 02, 2012"

Taste is more of the breadiness, with some caramel malt. Some floral hops at the end. Tiny amount of bitterness. Somewhat of a lighter beer with a thin mouthfeel. Easy to drink but not a huge amount of flavor. Not bad, not great. Decent beer for the mix 12 pack I got it in. Overall, nothing special but good enough.","PicoPapa","Oct 14, 2011"

Somewhat mild, but that is typical of APAs and the smell lasts throughout the entire beer. Citrus and grapefruit bitterness, countered by a pretty dry malt balance. Somewhat spicy and peppery. Moderate carbonation, a little thin but has a nice firm feel. Very dry finish. Very drinkable APA. I like that it has almost zero sweetness, which I think makes it more thirst quenching and almost like an English Bitter with American ingredients.","CushyGig","Sep 14, 2011"

4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice taste to it as well, starting with a nice little hop bite and biscuity malt behind it. The bitterness is small but noteworthy, making this a very good example of the style. The floral hops shine nicely to make a very pleasant and easy drinking pale ale. The body is moderate and the carbonation level is the same, both qualities of high drinkability. Flying Dog is usually very consistent and this one fits the bill nicely.","chodinheaven","Jul 29, 2011"

3.42,-5.8,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Finally getting around to reviewing this guy. It pours a clear bronze topped by a finger or so of dirty white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, mandarin orange, light cantaloupe, and mild caramel. The taste holds notes of grapefruit peel, grass, orange rind, very light caramel, and a touch of musty wheat. The bitterness near the finish is a bit harsh, and the musty wheat that follows doesn't help matters much. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty wet feel. Overall, an okay pale ale, but too strong on the obtrusive bitterness for my liking.","TMoney2591","Jul 21, 2011"

2.74,-24.5,3.5,2,3,3.5,2.5,"D/O: Basically a forgettable contribution to the style, this pale ale apologizes at every opportunity with the hope that no one will find it unappealing--and cuts corners in the process.

Flavourwise, there's a good dose of toasty malt which fades to that bitterness that american hops is famous for. Limes and orange peel fight all over the tongue.

Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose was simply filled with piney hops and I flashed back to last night when the young woman I was meeting stated that she would drink anything that was not too hoppy. People's awareness is astounding. This also had a nice amount of underlying malt sweetness, but I was ready for some hops. Mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant intermingling of piney hops and caramel sweetness in the mouth. It makes me wonder why I have not had Flying Dog beers in a while since I generally enjoy them. Finish was more bitter than sweet and I felt much better than I did after my previous beer today.","woodychandler","Jun 24, 2011"

3.7,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"O - Good pale ale, I still think Sierra Nevada defines the style of APA. In fact, this seem more like an English Pale Ale with an American twist.","steelerguy","Jun 16, 2011"

3.3,-9.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours medium amber with a slight dull orange hue and a head that is much more beige than I would have expected. The head is nice and fluffy, but leaves weak, broken lacing. The aroma is mild, and pleasantly fruity. I am getting some light citrus hop aroma, mostly bitter grapefruit, but it is fairly subdued. Malt is also evident in the nose and smells very bready and yeasty. Flavor is a bit perplexing. Citrusy cascade hops are the predominant character. I also notice that this beer carries a pretty hefty bitterness for style, but it is not too overbearing. The strange part is that there is grainy, astringent quality that is not very pleasant and really detracts from the other flavors in this beer. Malt is much less of a player than in the aroma, but what I do taste is fairly bready and non-descript. The mouthfeel seems to be smack dab in between light and medium and is fairly aggressive on the palate. Not much carbonation, but a dry bitter finish that lingers long after I swallow. This beer finishes a bit too sticky to be very drinkable. Not terrible, but not terribly great either.

Even though it's the hos that dominate you can still detect some roasted malts in the smell too. The taste is good. You can taste the malts first followed by the aftertaste of the hops. Very good, classic American Pale Ale taste. Medium bodied with a bitter feel from the hops with a slight buttery feel, very drinkable though. Not really a whole lot to mention about this beer, classic American Pale ale taste, good for summer time. Well malted and good hope taste, well balanced. Good Pale ale and would be a good gateway beer for those getting into craft beer.","AndyAvalanche","Jul 29, 2010"

The nose is of bready and caramel malts and a very nice blend of citrus and floral hops. As I sip the first thing I pick up on is the malty sweetness alluded to in the nose. A brief crack of bitterness hits next, before the hop flavor comes in to finish things off. I'm just a little let down that there's not as much citrus in the taste as there is in the nose. Carbonation is adequate, but the body is a little bit too thin for my taste. Doggie Style is fairly easy drinking, but not exceptionally so for the style. A fairly well executed American Pale Ale.","axeman9182","Jul 22, 2010"

There's a bit of orange before transitioning to a slightly bitter grapefruit finish. There's also a slightly grassy note here and there along with a sweet doughy malt presence.

Hops have a somewhat citrus smell and there is a pretty good malt aroma. The malts seem to give a caramel flavor from the Crystal, that is what comes to mind at first and then the middle seems to be more about a citrus hop flavor. Late flavors seem to have the hops but the malts seem to catch up.

3.77,3.9,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a nice copper/orange, with a nice thick head, but it didn't last. The aroma was primarily grapefruit, lemon, and apricot, with a subtle clove hint. The taste yielded all aforementioned citrus and spice flavors fairly prominently, which dissolved into a bitter hoppy finish, and unfortunately a somewhat dry-bitter aftertaste. Nice and medium-bodied, with not much in the way of carbonation, but again the dry aftertaste was a little annoying. At least the dryness keeps you gulping, and after a few pints, you realize that it's a pretty good session beer.","donniecuffs","Aug 26, 2009"

Toasty malt with caramel tones is well matched to citrus/grassy Cascade hop spice with a hint of alcohol and slight biscuity breadlike malt character.

Though the hop presence is strong with its requisite citrus, piney, resiny strength, a nice toasty, Munich malt feel helps to balance. It has quite a bit more body than a SNPA with a dextrinous, hoppy finish. Carbonation is pretty standard and it's light enough on the mouth without being watery.

The taste is on the dry side with a raw hop flavor (this does taste like it has been dry hopped) and some malty dextrin sweetness in the background. There may be some dry nuttiness in there as well, but it is quite subdued. There is a copperishness too to this beer that gets blended in with the overall dryness. this is somewhat of a medium bodied beer, not overly carbonated, and the aftertaste does linger a bit. This beer is okay, but the hops are not grassy enough for my tastes, and the maltiness is slightly metallic and it gets compromised by some of the dryness as well.

Piney hops were up front in the aroma, with a bit of fruitiness and mild malt (caramel, toast) in the background. Mild malty sweetness with moderate, well balanced bitterness. Fruit character intensified towards the end, with a light lingering bitterness. Lightish bodied, ample carbonation, solid texture throughout.

A bit watery in the mouth. More yeasty than hops in the flavor which is a let down because, after all it claims to be a pale ale...A ""classic"" one at that. I like my pale's to have the hops get my attention. It's the first thing I look for in them. Kind of a coffee bean, grapefruit and that pine thing I already mentioned is what popped up on the tongue but it's an odd balance that doesn't work for me. I'm all for the grapefruit thing when it comes to dry hopped ales (which is what this claims to be) and come to expect it but it's the coffee bean thing mostly that turns me off here. It's just tastes weird here and hangs too long in the aftertaste. Not much to get excited about really. If I'm over at a friend's house and I'm offered one of these down the road I won't turn it down but I don't see me picking up another six for myself again.","Dalem","Jul 19, 2007"

Juicy fruit malt and salty caramel sweetness with all the hops you could want in a pale ale; orange, slight grapefruit, lemon iced-tea, pine and spruce.

This part has much the same character as Sierra Nevada PA, but doesn't have the richness or depth that I know from SNPA. The sweetness is light caramel but this falls away after several sips and you begin to taste mostly hops which then get accentuated by the aftertaste and the pine flavor starts to come through toward the end of the glass.

Raising the glass to the nose floods the senses with rich caramel notes offset with a pale ale hop bitterness. The hops hit the front of the tongue with a subtle spicy flavor. As the flavors work their way toward the throat the hops give way to a malty caramel taste that finishes smooth with fruity notes from the yeast. This beer has a well-balanced flavor profile.

Juicy alpha acid aftertaste; dry- with that distinctly american pine sap and grapefruit rind taste. Medium in body and carbonation, the mouthfeel is smooth and even but too hoppy even by west coast standards.

There is a some what tasty citrus note, however. While not a horrific beer by any means, this beverage is not worthy of your hard earned dollar, when in search of a pale ale, when there are ample alternatives out there.

4.05,11.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a clear deep-amber body with orange highlights beneath a creamy cap of off-white that holds well but leaves little lace. The nose delivers an excellent blend of biscuity and caramelish malts and citrusy, piney and floral hops. The body is medium and it's lightly zesty on the tongue. The flavor bristles with piney and citrusy hops upfront; softens across the middle as more malt comes out; and finishes with biscuity and caramelish malt followed by a solid, lingering bitterness. A decent enough American pale ale that works well with food, but somehow seems to lack the finesse needed to lend it any greater drinkability.","NeroFiddled","Aug 02, 2004"

That stunning copper body turns me on every time, and Doggie Style has plenty of it, a clear bright copper colour. Decent off-white head on the pour, which sinks down to a very thin cap to about halfway through the glass. Bold citrusy cascade hops on the nose, only the faintest bit of malt in the background fighting to get at least a limb in the picture. On the flavour profile the malt stays in the background as well, a base for the grassy, citrus sweetness of the hops. Mouthfeel is thinner than I had anticipated, but the carbonation adds a bit of extra body in compensation for that, while it becomes more oily on the finish. The finish is refreshing though, a very quenching and satisfying experience. Plus I'm a sucker for the Ralph Steadman labels as well. This is definitely a fine session ale, it's just a shame it's so expensive up here in Alberta ($15 Can. for 6!).","IronDjinn","Jun 27, 2004"

On the surface, the hops make it drinkable, but with plenty of better, more balanced, options available to me, I'm not strongly inspired to do so.

It is decently bitter which i like, it finishes a little dry which i also like. citrus hops, raw and up front, clean lightly caramel like malt and an overall refreshing character. crisp in the mouth and damn tastey. this is a PA that may be a bit intense for some, but it is damn good for those of us who like a good hop fix now and again.","DESTRO","May 26, 2003"

First, this beer is a little dark for a pale, and second there is not much for head. The aroma did have a lot of the hop profile in it, but was on the weak side of a pale ale. The taste was not enjoyable to me, I had a hard time finishing this one. Hops strained there way to reach my tongue, leaving my taste buds crawling for more hops. Not a beer that I will be having again.","Amdahl","May 24, 2003"

The front is hoppy, sure, but I'd have guessed that there's something other than Cascades in there (slight tobacco). The middle is caramel malty, with some chocolate at warmer temperatures. The finish is bitter, fresh and again, there's some creamy cocoa at temp. I put off buying Flying Dog for quite a while, but I've been pleasantly surprised.

I might have gotten just a whiff of hops, maybe. The taste was to subtle for style. The hop bitterness did not stand out particularly but there was a fair amount of citrus taste and bite. A small amount of malt sweetness can be tasted in the finish. The mouthfeel was light and the carbonation played with tongue. This is a good session beer.

Soft, citrusy hops w/ soapy tinge, along with mild biscuit and light caramel malt in aroma. Trace pearish fruity esters. Bland wash of non descript caramel malt sweetness at first in flavor, ensued by token biscuit and bready base malt notes. Subdued floral hop flavor runs parallel with generic caramel malt. Mild hop bitterness emerges mid palate, offsetting residual sweetness, lending a balanced but uninspired overall character. Lightly bodied and approaching watery. Finishes dry and nearly bland, with hints of worty graininess briefly lingering. Although clean, Doggie Style is a prosaic and insipid pale ale. The apparent excessive filtration has stripped it of character. Decent drinkablity.","marc77","Mar 02, 2003"
3.28,-9.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"Beer of the month time again, and this time half of it was from Flying Dog Brewery. Doggie Style is a orange red color and had a thick off-white head with good retension.

It didn't have any strong hop flavor or aroma, but some might still consider this a pale. It had a pretty typcial malt flavor, and if I'm not coming across very well, it just doesn't stand out. This beer would be a good summer beer for drinking while playing croquet or throwing lawn darts.

3.7,1.9,4,4,3.5,3,4,"I'm beginning to notice a trend in all Flying Dog brews. They're like that real pretty girl of the most respected, upstanding sorority from your college. They look good, they smell good, but ultimately they don't deliver. This brew pours a medium orange-red amber with a rocky cream colored head. The aroma makes your mouth water....loads of grapefruit, pineapple, and pine. In other words...Cascade! The taste is pretty good too...and dominated by all that lovely hops, but it could use a bit more malt for balance. This malt deficiency is also detrimental to the mouthfeel...just a tad too watery. Given the relatively low ABV, this would make a good session pale ale. I've been pretty critical, and this is not a bad brew, but with the sheer number of different PA's in America alone in mind, and how some of them set the bar, this one just comes up a little short, considering the playing field.","johnrobe","Feb 11, 2003"

The taste consists of a light fruity hop bite, roasted malt, and finishes with a citrus twang. It is light-bodied and the mouthfeel finishes just slightly on the dry side. This is not the best example of a pale ale, but it is a pretty nice brew. Cheers!","BeerAngel","Feb 08, 2003"

A very crisp and refreshing brew. Probably my favorite offering from the Flying Dog Brewery.","Morris729","Feb 04, 2003"
3.92,8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Translucent, amber-coppery hue. Tiny, bubbly whitish head with poor retention, good lace. The nose is ideal for an APA, subtle citrusy hops with a solid malt foundation. Straightforward yet restrained hops initiate the flavors on the palate, malt works well, nice balance. Slightly sticky finish, IÂ’d prefer it to be drier. A smidge thin.

Cuts to watery mid mouth and finishes with bitter rind hops, but not that tangy. Carbonation is pretty low. Some similarities to an orange pekoe tea here, and unlike some Ales, it doesn't improve as it warms toward 50 degrees F. OK beer, I'm not a fan.","ADR","Jan 03, 2003"

ItÂ’s a real shame as well, because for all the people it attracts Â– I can see that the label will also put people off buying it because they may think it is a Â“bullshitÂ” image beer!!

A nice off-white head mounts the body of this beer and has a sticky presence about it.  Leaves some nice rings on the glass as I drink.  This beer has a great hop nose. Lovely floral boquet.  And it's backed by a sweet caramel malt presence on the nose as well.  There is something unique about the taste of this APA and I think it is a candy like sweetness that is present.  There is obvious caramel malt character and nice earthy and floral hops as well.  Not an overly citric or piney hoppiness, but this works fine as well.  Body is about medium-full.
