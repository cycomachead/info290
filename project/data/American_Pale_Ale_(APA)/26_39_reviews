"Had this guy a million times. Can't wait for the next one."
"One of the greatest pale ales ever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall very solid. Quality wise it is one to strive to replicated and duplicate. Very good. High drink ability. I hate saying it, but if I wanted an IPA I would get a Alpha King without thinking. Its perfectly balanced."
""
"Mouthfeel: Solidly midweight, decent carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice caramel taste, hint of that great 3 Floyds citrus vibe they have, smooth finish.  This is a great beer."

"First sip at Three Floyds Brewery Indianapolis Thanksgiving 2013 with Andy, John, mom, dad, Shipp, Andy D."

"Beautifully blended beer. Great color and flavor. A number one choice"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To me, it reminds me more of an amber. Very well balanced between hop and malt although a tad maltier to my palette. Very good but can't believe it goes for $20 a sixer."
""
"Probably one of the best balanced APA's I've had. It reminds me a lot of Little Sumpin' Sumpin' with the strong grapefruit-forward smell and taste. This is a tiny bit more toned down and refined, though. Very good APA. Would probably be one of my go-to's if it were readily available."
"This is bland and boring. Nothing special"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow that's unique for a pale ale. Great look, great smell with a bit of citrus and caramel. Man that's good. Thanks to Brent for sending this to me"
""
""
"A American Pale Ale with slight caramel sweetness balanced by aggressive citrus  Hoppiness, this is the kind of beer you find yourself not Able to put down because the flavors become more complex as you drink the beer! My first beer from 3 floyds, and I can always tell I will now be apart of their cult following!"

"Acquired a fresher bottle for my second tasting of this 3 Floyds gem. Bumping my initial rating up by .13 from 4.13 to 4.26."
""

""

""
""
"Possibly the best ""flagship"" out there"

"Wish I could read the bottled on date. I can see 2015 but could be anywhere from a month to a month and a half old. The beer doesn't hold up that well it seems."
""
""
""
""
""
"Alpha King is a great beer. It delivers what you would expect from a well crafted APA. The aromas are bananas, and the taste is complex. Enjoy it on tap."

"I really liked this beer."

"Love the little bitter sweet caramel taste. Great beer by 3 Floyds"

"O -  Unfortunately I'm in Ohio and this is not available at any of the stores I frequent, or to the best of my knowledge, unavailable outside of bars, but I would but this regularly if it was easily available.  A fine experience."
"Pours a clear, dark copper color topped by a creamy off-white head that laces. The nose is aromatic, earthy/piney hops, but not smashing in your face - quite a reserved hop profile that mixes well into the malty sweetness. The beer drink with a malt sweetness upfront, which quickly transitions into modestly bitter and flavorful hops that linger. It's well carbonated, has balanced malt-hop character, a pleasant aftertaste, minimal alcohol, and a hint of bready yeast. This is a pretty crush-able beer, balanced and with good availability - I'd definitely recommend."
""
"Outstanding pale ale.  Bursting with flavor in a somewhat aggressively-hopped fashion."
""
"way to hoppy for my taste..seems  overly bitter ..tried on a number of occasions in a bomber poured into a pint glass also sampled on tap..just not my thing this more a matter of personal taste"
""
""
"Next time I am in Indiana, I will make sure I pick up a case."
""
""
""
"O - 4.5 - A really solid and sessionable go-to pale ale. Truly remind me of a not quite so strong variant of their Zombie Dust. This is the type of beer that drinks easy enough for me to go through a six pack, but packs enough flavor to keep it interesting to the last sip. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice amberish body, 3 fingers of foam firmly attached to the glass, even forming thick layers on the sides. Papaya in flavor as well as oranges on the fringes. Smooth with average bitterness in aftertaste and hints of dryness. Full bodied pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid brew. I would love to get my hands on more of this one!"
"Pours hazy Carmel with an off white foam. That 3 Floyds nose hits, this is a great smelling beer, hops fruity with some pine, not a lot of malt for me. Smooth body light/medium. Lemon acidity on sides of tounge right away, then the hit of bitterness, then piney resony after taste with the bitterness fading. Really drinkable. Not as bitter or fruit as Zombie but smoother. Excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden amber, fluffy white foam. Bursting young citrus, pineapple, hop syrup. Lite dank, great bitterness but it's fleeting. Nice"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Faint citra hops but more malt than zombie dust. Solid pale ale"
""
""
"If God made beer this would be it!"

"O - A great pale ale. Like Sierra Nevada on steroids."
""
""
""
""
"Usually I drink IPAs/ double pales, but this was a nice change! Cool look, the only thing was a weird feel, but I think I feel that for most Three Floyds Beers. Good stuff!"
""
""
""
"I wish I could get this one on a regular basis rather than having to beg for a trade!"
""

"Had on tap in Indy. Overall great APA. Wish I could get this back east"

"Legit everyday brew"
""

"Neck and neck with Zombie Dust as my favorite pale ale.  Wonderful hop aroma and delicious hop bite.  Beautiful amber color is very inviting in the glass.  Personally find Aloha King equally enjoyable from a bottle or on draft.....yes please. Salute"

"After reading several reviews about how this beer can be difficult to find, I suppose I should be grateful that it is so plentiful in my town north of Indy. I have this a few times a month on draft, and it is always excellent- perhaps the best balanced APA I've had. Aggressively hopped with fantastic citrus and caramel at the same time. One of so many great Three Floyd's offerings. Believe it or not, this one can be had for $3 a pint or less year-round at two bars in my town."

"Very tasty APA.  Definitely worthy of its ratings.  More juicy than dry."
"Pours a hazy, copper color.  One inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of resin, pine, strong hops, sweet malt, alcohol, and strong tea/hop essence.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of resin, pine, hops, sweet malt, and alcohol.  Overall, great appearance, strong pine/resin/hop aroma and body, and decent blend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"[Ph]attest eggshell, 3 inch head I've ever seen! Hung around unto the last sip. A beautiful, copper-bodied pale ale with refreshing citrus hops and a subtle malt combo. Poured into 12oz glass, slightly translucent, and absolutely ZERO floaties. Most refreshing beer I've had in a long time!"

"O - Overall underwhelmed a little - very nice, but I am glad I didn't seek this out - it was just in the fridge at my local whole foods.  Given the $2 or $3 premium compared to similar pale ales I don't think this is worth it, but if I ever saw it on tap I would have again"

"On draft. I can't quite understand the hype that surrounds this beer. Thin, weak and one-noted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A very nice pale ale overall with tons of great flavors and a nice hop blend.  This is renowned for a reason… it is very good."
""
""

"More like a American IPA. Very complex with great IPA characters."

"Looks beautiful, feels beautiful. Deep amber, almost brown, with plenty of head and sticky lace, the likes of which are unexpected outside of the draft world. Creamy, smooth, medium low carbonation and medium high body gives it a big smooth, and very soft, mouthfeel. Decently balanced, leans toward the dry side, and like Zobie Dust, low acidity. Piney, slightly catty, and at 6.6 ABV, a nice in-between all days and DIPAs. Wouldn't call it intense aroma, though. More understated and consistent with the flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – I love that this is a fairly high-hop flavor/bitterness beer that also really accentuates the malt, which is very flavorful without being overly sweet. I think it’s equally fit for summer BBQs and late fall campfires.  Really excellent."

"I’ve had this beer many times. A good solid go-to beer since it is easily available year round in Wisconsin. Pours a light amber color. Good floral smell. Taste is a nice balance of bitter hops and sweet malt."
""
"O- Now that I've had 2 years to get over the Three Floyds hype, try many different other pale ales from across the country, revisiting their flagship beer on a whim was a great decision. This is a very complex but balanced pale ale with quite a bit of great fruity flavours. Slightly expensive at $12/6-pack, but then again the quality of this beer is just as good as the ones you'd have to buy in bombers and is still a better deal. [4.25]"

"Light brown color with a fair amount of haziness. There's a good inch thick tightly knit layer of khaki colored head. Brussels lacing. The aroma is a blend of cereal grains. The flavor is a bold burst of cereal grains and subtle hops that blend to give it almost a copper like bitterness. There's a slightly chalky note in the mouth."

"Pours a deep copper color with a big, foamy white head that settled slowly to a creamy collar and leaving some nice lacing. The nose is a nice balance of malt and hops; bread biscuits and caramel along with some floral, spicy hops. The taste follows suit with again, a really nice balance. The malt presents as nice and toasty, some bread and sweet caramel. The hops were difficult for me to tweeze out, and presented more as those great West coast spicy and floral bouquet. It has a easy drinking body, yet is still round and creamy with enough carb to lighten but not too much. Overall, I was impressed with the balance FFF achieves with this brew and the depth of flavor considering its low-ish ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a well-deserved knockout 4.5 for Alpha King Pale Ale from Three Floyds Brewing Co. & Brewpub. This had enough bite to taste, and went away as I finished the sips. The clean finish made this very refreshing. I will undeniably buy this brew again."
"Overall perhaps a bit more British than American in style, but packed with plenty of fresh citrus hop goodness."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is amazing. Malty, for sure, but still well balanced with all kinds of hops bitterness. This is the best tasting pale ale ever. The aftertaste is sad, because the ale is going away. Otherwise, it too is sublime, with malts and hops staying on the tongue for a long time. It tastes as though the alcohol would preclude you from drinking more than one, but I think I could do SEVERAL of these, and be in heaven, so I will try to get more. But alas, they are rare, and in demand. Rightfully so."
""
""
"Perfect end to the day."
""
""
""
"O - love this beer. I wasn't expecting to like this beer as much as I did when first tried. With its relative easy availability (at least here in Illinois close to the Indiana border) and excellent balance of hoppy/fruity flavor, this will be a go to beer for me for all occasions."

"Overall I could see why this brewery is quite good for an extreme pale ale it flourishes and I would consider picking up more offerings especially if they started using the 12oz format more often!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very solid IPA. Smooth mouthfeel and hoppy taste, with a subtle background maltiness.. Pleasant, hoppy aroma. Gives an even, strong taste of hops while not being overly bitter. Definitely very drinkable as a daily beer, think this would supplant Furious as my go-to if it was available in my area."
""
""
""
""

""

"O- Overall, its an enjoyable pale ale. Easy drinking, tasty and easier to get than most other 3 Floyds."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- An incredibly balanced and smooth pale ale. I was shocked my how impressive and strong the malt character was on this beer, it laid a great foundation for all the hop character."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer has a very good balance between the malts and hops—you get a lot of the citrusy aromas and flavors with only a slight amount of bitterness."

"I was hoping this would be a better beer, but was slightly disappointed. Slight head and not much if any residual lacing. The aroma was nice, slight citrus but not much else. Flavor was nothing special, a generic IPA. Maybe the batch was old...? Seemed to taste a little ’medicine-y’ at the finish."

"O- overall, this is good. Smooth and delicious. The hops aren't over powering and the hops blend really with the malt. Not the best pale ale but very good."
""

"O-I have always wanted an Alpha King. Finally got the go-ahead on this one. I found it to be an above average IPA/Pale Ale hybrid but not much more than that."

"O: This is a wonderful beer that I thoroughly enjoyed and really appreciated trying after looking for it during my travels over the last couple of years. Definitely one I wish I had easier access to and that I could enjoy more readily. Highly recommend and definitely in my top 100 of all time."

"O: good, but not extraordinary; maybe I just don't like pale ales that much, but being a 3Floyds brew I had to try it"

"o; It looked and at first smelled so good, the taste was a bit odd but ok. Perhaps an old bottle, no date info anywhere I could find, and Dating Beer does not list any info on how to find it if it IS there somewhere. None of the fruitiness a pale ale ought to at least hint at."

"I haven't been disappointed by a three floyds brew yet. Great flagship brew. I love the citrus hops that FFFs uses. The hops are similar to that of zombie dust and gumballhead, but this one has more notes of pine. This one doesn't have quite as crisp of a finish as those two. Still an awesome beer and will drink it anywhere it's available."

"O- This is my second beer form Three Floyds and Again I am extremely impressed. Zombie Dust was the first and this one isn't far behind. Alpha king in a very good example of a pale ale and one I highly recommend. Unfortunately I only have the one."

"Pours a robust copper color with about a finger’s breadth of off-white, almost ivory colored head comprised of medium-sized bubbles. Respectable retention and lacing. The aroma is of spicy and earthen hop cones, a bit of pine sap, some wet earth, and orange citrus. It tastes similar, but with a greater emphasis on the orange citrus. A bit of lemon rind and grapefruit come through as well. Earthen notes, including grass and pine, are more predominant than the spicy character that was notable on the nose. Hint of caramel malt on the end. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, but rich in carbonation with a nearly effervescent quality. Finish is wet and refreshing, but doesn’t linger longer than wanted. Overall, this is a very drinkable and enjoyable pale ale. While commendable, it lacks a certain depth that some other top-tier examples may provide, seeming somewhat one-dimensional. Still, this only adds to the drinkability, as it prevents it from becoming too filling or overwhelming; in that regard, great success here."

"O: Somewhat rough and abrupt in the hops department at times, but the body and mouthfeel go a long way to promote drinkability. In the end it's a crushable pale capable of delivering quite a hop fix, and it really makes you want to come back for more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I find this beer a pleasure, but not always an easy one. Though other Three Floyds might represent a finer example of what beer can be, this is a pretty clear statement of what a Three Floyds beer is. Strong, almost brutish, an explosion of flavor. I enjoy the contrasts, and think the beer represents a very successful statement of how big and robust a beer can be below 7% ABV."

"O: Perfect APA. I'd be happy if more breweries cloned Alpha King. Has an exquisite combination of malts/pine/hops and citrus for a wonderful APA. Highly recommended!"
""
"It's no wonder that many beeradvocaters, if that's a word, admire this beer. It has a nice appearance--typical pale ale color but with very nice lacing and head retention. It's got the hop presence of an IPA but is labeled as an APA. The smell is not outstanding at all, and while the hop profile really is quite nice, the one-dimensional malt character (oversweet caramel) contributes an odd and unappreciated balance to all of the hops. The mouthfeel is the strong suit here--despite all of the super-sweet caramel flavors, it's not sticky and the thickness and carbonation are near spot-on. While I very much enjoyed this brew, I can't say it quite lives up to its hype."

"Pours a slightly hazed copper hue, big fat fluffy white head, amazing retention that leaves a ring of foam from start to finish with good lacing. Aroma is sweet malt and bitter peach, tropical fruit and fresh cut grain. Flavor is sweet and malty up front - the hops seem to be an afterthought upon the first sip, merely there to balance the classic carmel malt flavor, but man do they slowly creep up to dominate the palate with earthy bitterness and stone fruit that lingers well after the malt gives way in the overall flavor. Finish is dry and clean, light effervescence with sappy hop oil lingering for days! Overall top 5 pale ale i've ever had the opportunity to try. Right up there with Alpine's Hoppy Birthday. Wish I had a 6'r... Arctic Panzer Wolf up next!"

"Fantastic! Of all the three floyds pales this really stands out. Balanced, restrained, yet full and satisfying. Its a little dark for a pale, but that's where any criticism ends. bright tropical and citrus notes on the nose, sweet and sharp on the tongue. light-medium and effervescent mouth feel. its really one of the best pale ales out there."

"Very balanced, aroma-hop-forward, well crafted American Pale Ale. The nose on this thing is fresh and citrusy, some pine, some sweetness. Taste is not aggressive but very assertive, no harsh bitterness at all. Lemon comes through strong and is followed by a subdued soft bitterness. Modest sweet cereal body ties it all together. Light alcohol flavor, but hidden enough that it could sneak up on you. More drinkable than its 6.6 ABV would suggest. Overall this is an incredible Pale Ale, and it most definitely lives up to the hype it gets. Well done. 89/100"

"One of my all-time favorite beers. It's both big and highly drinkable. I have trouble categorizing it as an APA because of its explosive aroma and flavors, its extreme hoppiness. Ten years ago this was moderately priced beer, but as Three Floyds has grown in renown, the price has gone up and it can be hard to find, even here is Chicago. At old prices, it was my everyday beer. Now it's a treat. Ah, the old days!"
""

"Overall- This is one loaded pale ale - not for the faint of heart. Full of wonderful hop notes and a distinct malt profile. Very bitter for a pale ale, but not unpleasant. Certainly one of the better pales out there. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from tap into nonic pint at the brewery. Deep caramel color with a nice foamy head. Piney hop and sweet caramel aroma. taste is bitter hops with some sweet caramel finish. For me the bitterness is just too much. Its actually way too bitter for my likes; which is the norm for FFF. Huge malt and bitter profile - and lots of people like that, just not me. Good brew for sure, I just don't get the hype on this one."

"Pours a nice amber with a hint of red, about an inch of fluffy off white head after a pretty normal pour. Really a nice looking beer. Getting hints of bread, biscuit, a bit of carmel and some piney hops off this one. Kind of underwhelmed on the aroma. The taste makes up for it though. Tons of hop presence from the first sip. Nice resiney pine base with citrus fruit overtones, also getting some peach through on this one. The malt comes through less in the flavor than on the nose, but the same flavors are there. Good caarbonation, medium mouthfeel. Overall, great beer. I enjoyed the hop presence in this APA, and found it very easy to drink. It isn't exactly to style, but what FFF brew is?"

"Overall- Good beer, big bitterness for a pale. Good display of hops, its loaded up. It gets rather one dimensional as it warms behind the bitterness, I thought at least. Would have it again for sure though."
""

"It's a simple and elegant pale ale with loads of hops in the flavor with a good amount of bittering. It's a very well balanced brew with the caramel and biscuit malt. The beer did not blow my socks off, but is quite good."
""
""
""
""
"o. this is a perfect beer. There is really nothing to improve other then to use different styles of hops to give a different pallet. I wish I could get this all the time in ohio, because it would be my go to bee."
"I've been waiting a long time to try this beer and it did not disappoint. Fresh bright aroma, zesty citrus hop flavor with a spicy bitterness on the back end. Malt bill was perfect for the amount of hops used. Well crafted and highly enjoyed."

"O: Excellent. I had my first Alpha King immediately after an excellent Odd Side Ales CPA, and suspected it might pale (excuse me) by comparison. Well, it’s different, but similar in both sensory properties and quality. Glad I have 5 more!"

"From the bottle into a Funky Buddha snifter. I love the smell of this beer, it's super hoppy, but with a bit of balance to it. It's very dark for a pale. Nice 2-3 finger head, great retention and lacing. Very citrusy taste, but doesn't live up to the smell. A very good pale, not in my top 10, but still very good."

"Thanks NW2285. Pours orange to brick red with slightly cloudy body. A thick, three finger off-white head with excellent retention and nice lacing. Strong orange notes dominate the nose with a hint of pine needle and faint caramel as well. Orange hits the palate first delivering a strong citrusy taste that’s faintly tart. The next notes are sweeter - sherbet and caramel. Alpha King finishes dry and slightly bitter, with faint resin notes. Medium bodied, not quite as chewy as an IPA, but pretty close. The carbonation is lively. Overall this might be the finest example of an American Pale Ale out there. Great work 3Floyds."

"O: This is probably one of my favorite go to IPA's from my area. I have had this beer many times and I like it more every time I try another IPA from the next up and coming brewery. 3F knows APA's and there is a reason this is almost always in my fridge."

"I am not a huge hophead. In fact I don't like most IPAs. This is an APA. But I do like this one! The smell of hops is a bit thick, and the aftertaste is a bit to hoppy for me, but that's the style. It absolutely represents the style well. There are times when I'm in a hoppy mood. I usually turn to an Imperial Stout, but those are quite heavy. This is a little lighter, a bit more drinkable. I could have another."

"Alpha king is the flag ship beer for Three Floyd's. As a result, it needs to be a solid tasting beer and it is. It is a bit cloudy, but it has a very hoppy taste that is common in many of the Three Floyd's beers. If I was at a party and that was among a variety of other beers, I would grab it first (followed by a Zombie Dust). The only problems with the beer are the price, around $12 a six pack, and availability."

"O. This serves as my standard for a pale ale. There are a few better, but many-many that are worse. Of course it is better fresh, but can hold up over time. I love the complex balance of hops: citrusy and resiny. I would keep this in the fridge 24/7 if always available. I see a 6er here and there a few times a year."

I love the citrus hops and the nice sweetness the malt. Perfect if you don't like overly bitter IPA's but would like a more citrus/hoppy pale ale. Being from Indiana I'm a little biased but seems like it should be the best APA in the country. I could drink these for ever."

"Crisp and refreshing. Creamy head. Very pleasant, long-lasting finish. Neither the hop character or the body overpower one another. It is also quite thirst-quenching. This is a rare APA that would be appropriate for a winter or summer session. One of the finest offerings from Three Floyd's."
""
""
""
""
"Thought this beer was good, but a little on the 'meh' side as far as my expectations go. Had high hopes as I've absolutely loved everything I've tried from Three Floyds so far, especially since this is their ""flagship"" beer. But it just didn't do it for me. It was definitely a good pale ale, however one-dimentional. Would have again, but wouldn't seek out."
""
"Verdict: A pretty standard APA from Three Floyds and it's no wonder why they've been making this for over 16 years. It's crisp, it's refreshing, it's hoppy without being abrasive and most of all, it's clean and balanced."

"What perhaps may be the most ""normal"" of easy to find FFF offerings, it's still quite different from pale ales that I'm used to. This isn't your cascade-focused pale ale here! The maltiness is very hearty, and combined with the very pleasant range of hops, it's far more juicy and zesty as a result. I really enjoyed this – its balanced nature could make this *the* go-to pale ale in my fridge year-round if I could only get this out West. Glad I got to try it at least!"

"O - one of my all time favorites. From day one Alpha King was a classic and deserving Halloffamer. It's by far the 2nd best American pale ale ever produced IMO and I'm sure everyone knows who make the #1 APA. Yep, FFF hold both of those 1 and 2 spots in my book. Simply remarkable what they do with Alpha King and Zombie Dust. Both are clear cut winners and both a must try. If you have access to this then you should be enjoying it. It's top shelf good. I just wish we'd get the bottles of this on a regular basis here at home. Ill buy this anytime I see it. A well balanced world class APA that's ridiculously tasty and fulfilling? Indeed. FFF brewing a liquid like Alpha King = pure Class. Pure genius."

"I've always liked the label art. No freshness date but my store just got it in so I'll assume its fresh. I love the look of this beer poured into a pint glass, darker then your average pale ale (or ipa) amber, with some caramel color, hazy, nice head and lacing. Don’t get me wrong it has plenty of hops up front but this thing is well balanced and the very last taste in the back of my mouth is toasty malts. This is damn good beer, I love how the citrus hop flavor up front is balanced and nearly taken over by malt. Hate to use the ""malt backbone"" cliché but it's really appropriate here. It takes a hell of a malt backbone to even out these hops. Times change fast, this used to be seen as a real hop bomb of a pale ale/IPA but now that job is left up to it’s brother Zombie Dust, meanwhile this one is becoming a classic."

"O- Very impressed by this beer. It is nicely balanced, easy to drink and keeps my interest through out the glass. Very nice. Too bad I had only one, I think I will have to pursue more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice pale ale. Refreshing, also tasty and well balanced."
""
""
""
"A great APA. A lot more flavor here than most offerings in the style, which is typical for 3F. Have had this before but just had it again and it is a lot better than I remember. If you are an APA person or an IPA person I still think you'll love this beer. Floral hops and balanced sweetness, great finish. If you have a chance to get it, don't pass it up."

"Upon drinking first comes a very hoppy front more in the standard of an American IPA, with a good finish. I keep forgetting this is suppose to be a pale ale but it sure doesn't feel like one. This is quite an okay drink but nothing here I would desperately want to have for an APA."
"O - Glad to have finally been able to try a Three Floyds Brew not to mention their flagship beer. This one definitely delivers full flavor for a Pale Ale and almost reminds me of an IPA with its characteristics. Even though this seems to be a huge Pale Ale it delivers and definitely does not disappoint, keep it up FFF! Oh I wish I had another one."

"real hoppy for a pale ale, more of an ipa to me. very red in color, not quite amber, but definitely moving in that direction, with a big rich tan head that doesn't fade at all. bold hop aromas are just blasting out of this, with equal parts forest and fruit grove. definitely some higher alpha acid varieties, this beer seems by the smell to be very appropriately named. the flavor actually does find some malt balance, despite the intense hopping. there is a sweeter yet dry American caramel malt going on, which holds up the hops quite well. plenty of citrus bitterness in the finish too, not lemony, but equally pungent. there is also a sort of woody character to this that I sometimes find in hoppy beers, not like its been oaked, but like its made in part from freshly milled timber. in any event, the finish is about an 7 on a 10 point bitter scale, strong but not overbearing. nice mouthfeel too, maybe a little dense for the style, but this is a style that's constantly in flux anyways. plenty of carbonation and a decent abv make this about the perfect 6pack beer in my mind. One of my first few beers from the much hyped three floyds, and it did not disappoint, although I can think of several American pales that are every bit as good as the alpha king here. still fantastic."

"Hands down one of my favorite beers. It has a strong citrus smell followed by a fresh hoppy scent. It rolls down the palette, intoxicating and bursting with flavor. I have had the opportunity to have a glass from a cask at Three Floyd's brew pub and the flavors are more present than on the tap or in the bottle. Dont expect to like any ""lite"" beer after this gem."
""
"D: very. Wish I had more right now!"
"O: This is a little too sour for my taste, but I am more of a fan of IPA's than I am of pale ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its a good Hoppy ale. Im still new to the world of IPA's or Big hoppy beers but this one is actually enjoyable to drink unlike some."
""
""
""
"O- nice pale/ipa. Closer to two hearted than Sierra pale. Nice caramel and citrus, with good amount of pine bitterness."
""
""
"Pours hazy copper with a fairly dense bubbly head that doesn't last too long. Smell s orange, pine, bready, lemon. Taste starts with sweet malt that makes way for citrus fruits and tropical fruits, some caramel, earthy, sweet hop profile, nice grainy backbone. Overall a very very drinkable beer, amazing balance of malt and hops, a beer anyone can love, but still has a distinct profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"D - Absurdly drinkable. I'd definitely get it again, if I was so lucky. My second beer from Three Floyds, and I can't wait to try more."

""
""
""
""
"Very good beer. Picked up one of these at the new Whole Foods in Kildeer. Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint. A very appealing dark golden color bordering on a red. A nice thin head carrying through. A different oily texture in the mouth. Smooth and bold hop flavor to start and finishes smooth. Very solid beer. I will definitely buy this beer again."
""
""
""
"Overall: a pretty tasty hop-strong pale ale. not quite an amazing beer. I'd like a bit more citrus but another solid from a brewery that should expand to Michigan, now that they have added Ohio"

"Had on cask yesterday at the FFF brewpub. 10 oz pour into a nonic pint, amber colored with a beautiful whitish head that laced the whole way down. Smooth mouthfeel, almost undercarbed. Hops are almost understated yet balanced making Alpha King an easy drinker compared to Zombie Dust. One of my favorite regular bottlings from FFF, a treat to have on cask!"

"Overall: I give this one a 3.5/5. It not bad, but it is a weird brew and I felt that it needed more definition."
""
"A nice tasty concoction of malt and hops, heavy on both and not holding back from much. Doesn't taste much like an APA, rather I think this one is more deserving of a malty IPA title. Either way, it's pretty drinkable and goes down easily. Maybe a tad overrated in my opinion, but good nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"Taste/feel: Just an awesome beer. The most dominant flavor that I get is of a quality, caramel malt on the start. The finish is super clean, and offers a burst of fresh hops. Not only is this beer pretty much perfectly balanced, it has an outstanding flavor. There's virtually no aftertaste, which makes me want to keep going back for another sip. Alpha King's a worthy flagship beer at Three Floyds, and one of my absolute favorite beers overall. I can only hope that they ship this stuff to Michigan some day soon."
""
""
"On tap at the brewpub. Kind of a three floyds forgotten gem here. The flagship beer that we don't have too often, we forget how good it actually is. The hops are balanced absolutely perfect with a slight citrus aftertaste. the 6.66% ABV is also a nice touch from the boys (and girl) over at three floyds. Just a great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is just as hoppy as a lot of IPAs so I really enjoyed it. It's a bit sweeter than something I normally drink, but the intense hop aroma and great balance make this a winner."
"Overall: Good balance in flavors. As the beer warms, floral notes started to appeared in both aroma and taste. Very nice malt characters. It was little odd at first. Overall, Alpha King is a tasty brew."
"Raul was tripping. More than a year later, Raul dipped in again and he is well into this thang."

"Beer is medium-bodied with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is at first slightly fizzy, then softly foamy as it moves across the palate. Closes quite dry, with modest stickiness lingering across the palate."
""
""
"the appearance is a dark copper color. the smell is fruity with hops. the usual fff hoppy smell. it has a fruity taste at first then followed by a hoppy bitterness. the bitterness then dissipates and you want more. slight carmel. overall it is one of my favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"From notes, 4/4/11. Pours a lustrous orange with a shiny white cap. Good lacing. The aroma is dominated by hops with bright orange-tangerine and freshly cut grass notes taking the forefront. However, there’s a nicely doughy caramel malt backbone holding up that hoppiness. This beer definitely straddles the line between APA and IPA. The taste is also much bigger than your average APA. It has marvelous balance, starting with malt sweetness and smoothly transitioning to hop bitterness in the finish. It’s very, very easy to drink. The beer has a round, full feel that never gets too heavy. Flavor fills your mouth with each sip, but it finishes clean, light and in need of another quaff."
"O - finally reviewed after drinking on - tap previously and in bottle several times. On cask seemed to really accentuate the carbonation, it was really smooth. This beer is always available but when I saw it on cask I had to give it a try, we'll worth it and as Three Floyd's ""everyday"" beer, its always a good solid option."
""
""
"All in all....hop forward, not overly sensational from an olfactory perspective... Biting hops taste with a malty finish and great mouthfeel. I was debating with how it compares to others I like. On par with Sculpin, but different. Not as ""sessionable"" as Dogfish 60 or Lagunitas, but an excellent IPA."

"This Ale is considered a flagship for one of the best breweries in the nation and it seems to hold true for a non-Imperial style."
""
""
""
"This pours a golden amber. There’s’ an orange marmalade aroma and a bready toasted biscuit note which contrasts with the hop aroma. I find a similar orange marmalade flavor that’s dryly bitter with pine and orange peel on it. Nicely carbonated with a bitterness that lasts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours deep clear amber with a small head. Aroma is huge floral grapefruit. First taste is pine hops with a tinge of grapefruit. Even more malt than expected. Beautiful fruit flavor without much bitter, citrus and caramel malts, grapefruits but not bitter, yum. Medium slick mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Easy drinking. Solid beer, but will have to check out Zombie Dust now."

""

"A right fine pale ale. It goes down smooth and easy with a good bit of bitter hoppyness balanced by sweet malts. While I won't yearn for more, I won't turn any away either."

"This pours a semi-cloudy medium brown color with a slight off-white head. The aroma is mild with scents of hops with hints of grains and citrus. The taste starts off as a bold, rich pale ale and than finishes with an extra amount of crisp bitterness. This is about as perfect of a pale ale as I’ve ever have had the pleasure of drinking."
""
""
""
"I poured this brew and received a warm amber colored body with about a 1/2 fingers worth of an off white head that left decent lacing. The aroma was earthy (tell-tale of Warrior hops) mixed with hints of citrus. The flavor punched your palate immediately with a solid blast of bitterness followed by some earthy hop flavors and toasted malt. The body was light to medium and left your mouth dry afterwards."
""
""
""
"Overall: Across the board, one of my favorite beers to date. I live in an area where some effort is need to obtain this brew, but worth it every time. It is unfair to compare other APA against this beer since it is simply so much different then other of its style."

"Alpha King pours a deep red/amber color with nice creamy, fluffy head. The nose is pungent hops with a touch of sweetness. It's got a nice medium body with just enough malt to keep the hops in check, but the hops really do want kick your ass. It's got nice zippy bit bite on the back end. Alpha king is a personal favorite of mine and a for sure go to."

"O: This is such an amazing pale ale and probably one of the best I have ever had. 3F sure loves using their hops in Pale Ales, but I personally think that is whats amazing about this beer. This beer though isnt near as good as Zombie Dust."
""
""
""
"Overall an excellent stuff from 3Floyds. My second beer from them. First one was at the pub, on tap, the name of which i do not seem to remember. It was an IPA as well. Highly recommended."
""
"Maybe my bottle wasn't as fresh as it could be and like many Three Flours beers I'd love to revisit them down the line. But this one hit me with a tantalizing blast of hoppy aromas as soon as I popped the cap of the bottle and unfortunately went down hill from there. I found it overly sweet, more assertively bitter than flavorfully hopped, and drinking bigger than it should. Lacks subtlety of any kind and has more alcohol presence than I'd like, both characteristics I've encountered before with this brewery 's beers. Not bad, but I clearly am in the minority here in not being a huge fan of this."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the beer that got it all started for me. I love this beer. From the grapefruit, hoppy taste, to the citrus smell. This beer is my kryptonite. I can't go into the brew pub, or local shop and not walk out with a six pack of this. Seek it out. This beer is a gem."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I stopped at a small bottle shop in Porter IN and picked up 3 varieties of FFF and not a single one has disappointed so far - this is no exception. A must try."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I like this one as an IPA. Good hop character and a balanced malt flavor. Would I drink it again? Yes, got to finish the six-pack at least."
""
""
"Overalls - love it; an epic example of the style; savor every sip if not readily available in your area; 3 Floyds has my absolute favorite labels/marketing as well"
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"O - a hoppy interpretation of a pale ale which is fine by me, but ZD is better"
""

""
""
""
"Overall: The best pale ale I've ever had. So good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden amber. 1 finger head, no carbonation. Smells slight hoppy fruity. Taste fruity and hidden alcohol. Nice apa, their zombie dust is preferred. ale Ales have never been near my favorite types of beers, but Alpha King is definitely good. VERY hoppy, with a strong malt backbone, AK is best (at least for me) paired with food to ""wash it down", as I dislike the extremely hoppy aftertaste. This is going against the grain of my Great Divide Titan IPA review, which was glowing, but I prefer the Titan due to it’s dryness. There’s a sweetness in the background of AK that I can’t get over. Still, Alpha King is outstanding, but I prefer other pale ales."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fairly complex pale ale. Balanced to the extremes. But it's a little too bitter for my tastes. Just not my style."
""
""
""
"Overall: Good, but not great. It tickles my fancy every now and then, and I would definitely stress that I enjoy this beer. However, I view it more as an amber ale than a pale ale."

"O: This bottle is probably pushing three months old -- so gotta keep that in mind in this review. I don't quite remember like this when I originally got the six pack. I remember it being more refreshing without as big of a malt characteristic. So, definitely pick up a six pack, but don't let it sit too long."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the dark and beautiful coloring, and the freshness throughout. The hop presence is phenomenal, and again, so fresh and gritty. The malts become a bit muddy in the nose, and almost overpowering with warmth from those great hops right at the start. Throughout the taste, however, the blend of the malts and the hops is supreme, and this is one of the best in the style for sure. Drink on the colder side, as excess warmth throws the balance to the more sour grain side of things."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste is bold, again with several citrus tones, but not overpowering. Hops are present but not overly biting at the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A nice top level APA. Well rounded and balanced, wish I knew when this was bottled though."
""
""
""
"This is quite the hoppy pale ale. Alpha King is a pretty appropriate name, as it has the properties to be the top APA out there. There is enough malt to balance the beer out, and a touch of citrus, but it's clearly all about the hops which absolutely dominate the palate. So, it can be a little pungent and I recall not wanting to take big sips, but at the same time I could easily have a couple of these in a sitting."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is amazing....a hop heads session beer. I really wish I could get this regularly"
""
"O - Easily the best american pale I've had. Three Floyds gets plenty of hype but a beer like this makes the attention justified. Loved this one."
""
""
""
"D - An all around fantastic pale ale from FFF. While the pungent and assertive hop profile pushes this brew towards IPA-territory, the big presence of sweet malty flavors gives it some real balance. Almost like an Imperial-APA. At only 6.00% ABV this brew packs some serious flavor, but remains balanced and most importantly, incredibly drinkable. A truly world-class beer from FFF."
"OV: A well crafted APA verging on IPA that brings lots of great hop bitterness to the table."
""
""
""
"Pours a jewel-like amber with a two and a half finger pillowy off-white head with great retention. Significant lacing as the head recedes. An inviting blast of grapefruit rind and pine greet the nose. Opens with bitter grapefruit and understated floral notes sweet malt joins in fairly early and adds balance, finishes with a bit of bite and citrus. Incredible mouthfeel, medium bodied, but silky smooth with just the right amount of creaminess. A standard-setter for APA's. You'll be hard pressed to find one that is better."
"This is an awesome pale ale. It's big and malty with a nice, citrusy hop character that leads to superb balance. This is easy to drink and very enjoyable. I'm glad I have a few more of these to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is a bit thick for my liking but really works well with the beer. I can't knock it."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Everything about this beer is bold, aromas, taste, feel, even the label art. It's a fantastic beer that I seek out every time I'm in the great state of IN, though it's not always easy to find."

"Alpha King is awesome. Now, all I need in my life, is some Zombie Dust. Until then... cheers!"
""
"O- FFF really knows how to make good APAs. This isn't as good as Zombie Dust, but for a flagship beer that they make in large quantities this was definitely quality stuff. Although there wasn't a freshness date, I could tell it wasn't exactly the freshest but it still tasted good. One of the better APAs I've had, but nothing amazing. Good go to flagship beer for the mideast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Its another solid 3F's hoppy beer. You tend to get a very similiar hop profile from most hoppy beers in the 3F lineup. But here's the bottom line...once you have drank Zombie Dust all other American Pale Ales just don't come close."

If I lived within the FFF distribution area this would probably be my go to session beer. I intentionally sought this out before Zombie Dust, and will have to try that one next to compare."
""
""
"O: This is a pretty good beer, but It's not quick what I imagined it to be. This particular bottle seems a bit old, but without any bottle dates, it's hard to know when it was brewed. I'd like to try this again, but when I know it's a fresh bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Yummmy."
"A fine beer."
"My brother and I have been drinking this fine brew since 1996. They were at a local brew fest in Downers Grove. My brother tried Alpha King and adopted it as his favorite of all time. We have been hop heads ever since. Thanks for years of cranking out awesome beer Three Floyds."

""

"O: A good pale ale. More bitter and alcohol presence than Zombie Dust or Pride and Joy, but still fairly easy drinking."
"Notes: Served on tap in a pint glass. Dark atmosphere made it a little difficult to judge appearance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This brew defines the style for me. Incredibly well balanced, and looks stunning in a tulip glass. There are several outstanding APAs that really taste like IPAs, or at least ""light"" IPAS. AK does not fall into that category, IMO. Incredible balancing act here."
"How have I not reviewed this? This beer helped me discover craft beer and began my love of three floyds. 12 oz bottle into a duvel tulip. Pours a clear copper with a 2 inch off white head that shrinks slowly. Very nice lacing. Aroma is grapefruit, toffee, grass, and mild citrus. Flavor is bright citric hops. Grapefruit, caramel, mild toffee, and a mild creaminess. Mouthfeel is medium and sticky. Flavor lingers and alcohol is invisible. This is THE go to beer at any respectable pub I go to. Amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very nicely crafted, unique beer. These guys really know what they are doing in the pale ale category and I would go back for more in a second. Even though they touched on some classic notes that come with the style, they definitely stretched into a new realm of beer with the alpha king."
""

"Overall - Awesome. Pushes the edge of a pale ale. Any more hop kick and this Is a ipa. Incredibly smooth, tasty and full of flavor, theres a reason this is 3 floyds flagship beer. A totally different monster then zombie dust, but equally impressive."
"Overall, a very solid beer. Between this and SN Pale Ale, they are the flagship beers for this style."
"O: Gets a slight edge over Daisy Cutter from the beefier malt and hop profile. Still too grassy in the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I can see why this is so highly rated. The balance and boldness are second to none when it comes to APAs!"

"poured a clear dark amber with an inch of off-white head. smells of hops, grapes, caramel, and grapefruit citrusness. bitter taste up front with a bit of spicyness to it. floral sweetness fills up my cheeks. a bit earthy and grassy. medium bodied and perectly carbonated. this is an awesome beer. bitter as hell just the way i like it. a nice summer thirst quencher with a great amount of sticky lacing that leaves your moustache asking to be dunked in the glass again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is fairly light, with a medium carbonation that suits the style well. This is a very nice pale ale. I've always been happy when people send it as an extra."
""
""
"O - This is fantastic. Very well balanced between the citrus and piney hops and the toasted caramel malts. The grassy earthiness and a dash of danky hops really sets this apart from other pale ales. Really enjoyed this one!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange color into my glass with a nice white head that lasts a long time and forms very nice lacing on the glass.The aroma is malty sweetness along with a good amount of citrus, pine and grapefruit tang. Hoppiness is present throughout the taste but a bit too sweet for my taste. Overall very nice."
""
""
""
"This is a terrific beer that breaths nicely. It is a close as it gets to being a perfect beer for a pre-pasta meal. While I believe Three Floyds really can't do wrong, this one is head an shoulders above even dark lord 2011. It is my favorite way to start a perfect weekend."
""
""
"Dark, opaque honey color. A short head, but it sticks to the glass all the way down to the bottom. Citrus aroma is equal in strenth to the hops. Perfect carbonation, almost creamy on the palate with tiny bubbles just a swirl away from a fresh head. A late, but short lived finish with a light aftertaste. Good hops balance, not overwhelming, but clear and intentional."
""
"Fun, easy, APA."
""
""
""
""
"Slightly torn between this IPA and Pale ale style but either or this is a damn good one."
""
"O- Embarrassed that it took me this long to get around to try this one. This is the best pale ale I know of. Its also priced well, unlike a lot of other 3F brews. If you like a hoppy pale ale and IPA's, this is the bomb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Everything about this beer is great. It is well-rounded. Hoppy, yet not as extreme as something like Three Floyds' Zombie Dust, and nicely malty. But just like Zombie Dust, I wish I could easily acquire this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent beer, a very solid pale ale. Definitely good for more than one. Well worth a try."
""
"O: Very solid pale ale, an easy drinker which is balanced and packs lots of flavor for the ABV."
"O- Good beer, worth a try, need to try this from a bottle to really give it a fair shake."
""
""
"Alright, so I've had Zombie Dust, I've had Daisy Cutter, and now, I've had Alpha King. Three of the top five APAs at the moment. For one, I must say Three Floyds knows how to make an assertive, hoppy brew, be it APA, IPA, or DIPA. Secondly, I have to say that Alpha King is my new favorite APA, without a doubt. There's just something about it that rubs me the right way. The mouthfeel is wonderful, the hops are bordering on IPA territory, and the smell is absolutely great."

""
""
""
""

"M. Medium body and carbonation levels."
""
""

"Overall: A very solid pale ale. A pleasure to drink, if it was available I would have it regularly. Find it and drink it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: For everyone who can drink this all the time, I'm jealous. Tons of hop flavor and aroma, but enough balance from the malt that it never crosses in to IPA territory. Incredibly well balanced with a nice hop bitterness."
""
""
""
"O: Drinkable with a good hop flavor and malt backbone. Sad I can't get it around here. 4.5"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice amber colored pour with a medium off-white head. Nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is floral with citrusy hops and malt. Nice malt flavor with citrus hops and pine; nice bitter finish. A good balanced beer. Love getting my hands on any Three Floyds beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- The citrus qualities inherent in the beer are a little muddled. If they had as much zing as the grassy and piney hop notes this would be a really great beer. It is still good as it stands, thanks to the hop profile and the mouth feel."
""
"O - excellent. Perfect APA."
""
""
"I find this to be a good, hoppy pale ale. I wish the taste had more than the heavy dose of hop bitterness. But I could smell it all day, and I definitely don't mind drinking it."
"This is a beautiful brew."
""
"O: This beer is so smooth and well-balanced start to finish it is hard to find an argument against it. Drinks amazing and it big, bold, and hoppy (as it should be). I wish Three Floyd's would distribute to Colorado (or Ireland), but it is a nice perk having family and friends in Chicago for an ""excuse"" to go visit!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Certainly a well-made beer, refreshing and enjoyable. I could sit around smelling this all day; perhaps future experiments with a snifter in order?"

"O- A pretty damn good pale ale. I'll have to pick up a sixer of this next time it hits my local shop."

"This is a great beer and I wish the good people of Chicago & Indiana wouldn't mind sharing a bit of their stash with the good people of Ohio!"
"Smell is very nice tropical with a little pine and some sweet caremal. Taste is definately some more nice tropical with a small amount of pine. There is also some nice caremal to even things out. Great beer. Mouthfeel is sorta medium and great for the style."
""
"Mouthfell is ok, some dryness because of the lasting bitterness. Drinkability is good for an APA. Overall I have always enjoyed this beer as something that is sometimes available in places that have a bad selection, and that's about where I'll keep it."
""
"Overall, this is certainly one of the boldest, most flavorful pale ales I have tried, and I can understand why a hop lover would enjoy this beer. Its boldness borders on abrasive, however, which keeps it from being the kind of easy-drinking pale ale I often crave."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste matches the nose. Hops first earthy and pungent. After the initial hop flavor the carbonation comes in and pale and lightly roasted malts mix in. As the carbonation subsides the hops present themselves again as a earthy bitterness."
""
""
""
"O: I stand behind, my favorite IPA is brewed by Surly out of Minnesota, and I think they styled on this beer. Still take the surly first, but this is a close second."

"Great beer, I'd love to drink it all the time if I could!"
""
""
""
"O- It's legit. It's a go to when the other's aren't there but it's also something that if pressed I would be seeking out."
"On tap from Clevelands own Bier Markt- served in a pint glass. Had a one finger head and great retention and lacing. Poured a dark copper color with its foam being a sort of bone-white. Smell makes it immediately apparent that this is a fiendishly hoppy beer- I smell the citrusy notes that I've come to associate with cascade hops. That taste measures up to the smell- hops from beginning to end and rounded out with a nice medium light body. The mouthfeel is wonderful as well- a little oily from the hops and medium carbonation make it very drinkable. I would get this all the time if it was available to me."
""
"O: This is my first FFF beer. It's a solid pale ale with a nice balance, but with all the hype I was expecting a little more. Not as hoppy as I thought it was going to be."
"Highly drinkable, somewhat bitter, bready, and sweet pale ale."
"O - Either the recipie has changed, or I have, but Alpha King is nowhere near as hoppy and delicious as I remember. Regardless, it's still a GOOD APA, but pales in comparison to the Zombie King I just had. Will re-visit again to confirm freshness."
"O: Best pale ale of my life. So easy to drink and every sip was enjoyable. This is a legend."
""
""
""
"Alpha King pours a medium copper color with a half finger coffee colored head. Good lacing on the side of my snifter glass. Fairly clear in appearance. The nose is very nice- hops, some malt, citrus fruit, a little grass. Very well blended, and pleasant smelling for the style. The flavor is almost like an IPA- much more flavor and hops than I was expecting. Big hop bite, with grapefruit, orange, pine, and a decent malt backbone holding everything together. Really big taste for the style. Fairly smooth, malty aftertaste.. but the hops are definitely still there. Feel is medium, with a nice bite, good carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, I can see why this is the #3 beer for it's style. Really well done- another winner from FFF. Cheers."
""
""
""
"Overall, I am just really pleasantly surprised by this. I've been wanting to try FFF beers, and some very nice BAs have made that possible for me. This is definitely my new favorite pale ale."
"I am re-acquainted with how much I love this beer every time I have it. One of my favorite easier to get offerings."
""
"It really is a solid pale ale, and at 6% it is on the heftier end, but I'm not complaining. I'm really enjoying this and happy I have 5 more! Would love to try more from Los Tres Floyds."
"O - Excellent. Most complex PA I've tried that doesn't simply become a hopped up PA that is really an IPA. Malt character sets it apart, hop profile is delicious."
""
""
""
""
"O- a very solid APA with fantastic flavors and superb balance. citric and malty at the same time. would have liked a lighter, less malt forward profile, though would certainly seek this beer out again. drinks big for the style."

"O:This is definitely more hopped up than I remember from years past. It drinks more like an IPA than a pale ale, but is still a delicious and hoppy brew."
""
"Pours a deep clear copper color with a big fluffy white head that slowly dissipates to a wisp of foam on top. Smells of citrus, lots and lots of grapefruit fresh from the produce isle. a bit of toffee, bread and a hint of caramel malt are buried deep underneath. Taste is citrus and resinous with bits of bread and malt barely breaking onto the scene. Long lingering hop bite in the finish is there but never harsh. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation with a smooth resinous mouthfeel. This is a very nice beer, but to call this a pale ale is a bit of a stretch. I would drink these a lot more often if they were more available in my area."

"This was one of my first loves getting into craft beer, and to be honest, it still is among one of my favorites. I've also had it on tap and it was fantastic!"
"I love Alpha King. It was one of the first craft beers I really got into when living in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago, around 2003. There was a liquor store down the street that had 3-4 craft beers and this was one of them. (Another was a spoiled sixer of Abita Turbodog I bought once. It was AWFUL. Pure soy sauce!). I loved Alpha King from the start, and still do. I drank it when I was at the brewery way back then, before the brewpub existed and it was just a well-lit factory atmosphere. Some old-timers were drinking their Light Lager offering and eating some potato chips they had brought. It ruled. Citrus, caramel malt, a bit sticky, excellent. I had it on tap at MacNiven's during lunch (a liquid lunch in my case).. to celebrate the end of my first semester at grad school. I also had Bell's Sparkling Ale, which I was less impressed by but still enjoyed. Indianapolis is a good beer city. We have lots of good options."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - I was super surprised by how good this was. I know it had high marks here, but I needed to experience it to believe it. Really enjoyable beer and I hope to track down a 6-pack in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: I love hoppy beer. This was enjoyable, and I will repeat it again soon."
""
""
""
"Had this on tap at 3 Floyd's Brewpub. Pours a dark amber color with 1"" of an off white colored head. Smells of big grapefruit and pine. Tastes of big citrus and fruit flavors. Big grapefruit here. This has got to be a borderline IPA. I've had many IPA's that couldn't hold up to this one. Great beer. I wish I could get it where I'm at."
""
""
""
""
"T: Great juicy citrus hops upfront tempered by some slightly bready malts and finished off with a nice peppery hop resin bite. A bomb pale ale. I would love to get more of this stuff."

"O: This beer is one I like to call dangerously drinkable. The balance of the malts and hops, the dryness of the beer throughout, really just everything make this a beer you absolutely have to try."
""
""
""
""
"Cost: $9.99 for a six pack, or $7 for a cask-conditioned 16 oz pour."
"I typically prefer IPA's with higher IBU but this APA is outstanding! Rich flavor with enough hops to let you know they're there. Great amber color with a antique white full two fingers head and great lacing. I have yet to find another APA to match this one. This is a quality beer that any beer lover would enjoy! Cheers!"

"Overall: Big, sticky Pale Ale that is firing on all cylinders. Maybe could use a titch more balance, but this is a great example of a beer pushing against the boundaries of its style."

""
"O: This is absolutely a unique beer. There's a definite battle between sweet and bitter going on at the finish that I enjoyed. Being a hop head I totally dig the huge citrus hop presence. Worth the accolades it receives."

"Overall - This is a very well balanced ipa, and a hop lovers dream. I personally prefer a little more complexity and a little more sweetness, but this still does not disappoint."
"This beer is translucent golden amber with a healthy white head. The smell is of citrus and grassy hops, with a sweet hint of candy. Taste is pine, grapefruit, and sweetness. mouthfell is dryness from hops. Overall this beer tastes like a combination between avery ipa and pliney the elder. YUM! thanks to gcurlow!"
"12 ounce bottle, no bottle date but I bought a 6 pack last week. Pours hazy red orange color with a nice 2-3 finger off white head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick lacing cap that lasts. Some decent lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big orange zest, pine, lemon zest, caramel, light grapefruit, bread, and a bit of spiciness. Some fantastic aromas here with great balance and strength. Taste of big orange, pine, spiciness, caramel, bread, and a bit of toasted malt. Nice amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, spiciness, caramel, and bread on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Fantastic drinkability with no alcohol noticed at all except for a slight warming on the finish. Fantastic balance of flavor and bitterness. Overall an incredible pale ale with tons of flavor, hoppiness, and balance. I will be picking up more when I am in Indiana again."
"Overall, a damn good brew. Dreadnaught's more balanced little brother, really."
"Cheers."
"This is the flag ship beer of my favorite brewery. I love this beer. Top 10 favorite of mine definitly. Thanks, FFF."
"A great APA, I would love to have this readily available in my area."
"Pours a deep orange with a generous head. Aroma is mostly hops (citrus and pine) with some malts coming through too. Taste is the same floral hops with a little bit more of a malt backbone than I expected/remembered -- it is an APA after all. Still, it's a pleasant surprise because the smell had me expecting IPA all the way. The malty backbone really mellows and balances the spiciness of the hops. Great use of hops to balance out the flavors here. Plus, it's nice to find a beer where the hoppy flavor blends so well and doesn't overwhelm. Good, balanced mouthfeel with a crisp, hoppy finish. Drinkable and delicious."
"Alpha King pours a deep orange/amber color with a finger of off-white head. Decent lacing. The nose is citrus hops and pale malt. Taste opens with bitter orange rind. Malt lends notes of sugar cookies and caramel mid palate. Bitterness reasserts itself in the finish and there is a nice lingering bitter aftertaste. Feel is medium bodied. Carbonation is spot on and lends a creamy texture to the beer. Alpha King is an excellent example of the style. Ridiculously drinkable and insanely tasty. This would be a regular in my fridge if it was local to me. Recommended."
"The beer was a little bit darker than I expected. It tasted like a true old school IPA. I'm not sure that it can compete with the newer IPA's out there but 5 or 10 years ago I would have wet myself for this beer. It'll be a nice brew to go back to from time to time."
"O: One the best APA's out there. Great taste, perfect balance, no wonder its Three Floyd's flagship beer."
"Overall: If this was available in my area it would be my go to pale ale. This is my favorite pale ale to date. It is surely the most hop forward pale ale I have had, that might be just due to the freshness. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a quality pale ale."
"O: I like Alpha King a lot. If you're after a hopped up pale ale, this has to be high on your list."
"O – A stellar pale ale. One of my favorites."
"O: fantastic beer, not sure of its category though. It's so well put together, I want a thousand of them. Got the 6 pack for $14 at some hell hole in Chicago, so screw them for that, but it's probably worth it."
"o: they dont get much better than this, thanks again nate!"
"O: Alpha King is a complex and enticing APA. A strong hop presence but excellent balance make this one of the best APA's this reviewer has sampled."
"Pours a clear honey orange with a 1 inch puffy tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thin sticky rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of tons of herbal and citrus zest. Taste is of sweet malt up front with a mainly citrus zest hop finish. Mild bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pale ale with a nice kick of hops in the smell and taste."
"O - Solid APA with excellent balance. Malts and hops both shine through nicely. If you are looking for an outstanding pale ale then look no further."
"O: 4"
"Seriously, try one."
"Overall this was a great beer that went down easy and is very similar to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale in most aspects, especially the high drinkability. I highly recommend this beer, which to me is a session beer that I could have anytime; it was balanced perfectly, tasty and outstanding overall. I’ve had 2 3Floyds beers so far and both have lived up to the hype."
"$10 a sixer"
"This is pretty much my favorite beer. Not necessarily what I think is the best, but a beer I could drink every day for the rest of my life. Deep copper with a beautiful three finger head and really awesome lacing. The nose is like wildflowers, grass and pine... smells like a vibrant forest should. Excellent hop flavor right from the beginning the really fires the senses and adds some spice, and the floral flavors accent it very nicely. The malt takes somewhat of a backseat but is there to tie everything together with lingering sweetness. The mouthfeel is pretty standard for a pale ale, but the hoppy tingling and excellent carbonation are exceptional here as well."
"Overall - Nice flavors, none over the top. Complex hop profile, even if it isn't in-your-face. Not really what I expected from such a high rated APA. In some ways, it's good that a beer as balanced as this is so highly rated on BA. But I'm not looking for balanced. As an American craft beer drinker, I want extreme everything."
"Overall, a highly enjoyable American Pale Ale that makes great use of major hop auromas and flavours."
"O- Nice APA. pretty good all around brew"
"o - pretty good and fits the style well. could easily have a few in a night."
"This is great stuff and one of the best out there."
"It's hard to find anything wrong with this beer, unless you just don't like hops. If I could get this stuff all the time (I can't), it would probably be one of my regular go-to beers. It's a big, bold, flavorful, hoppy-as-heck American pale ale."
"The body is light and the carbonation holds up nicely in the growler. Overall this one is pretty rock solid. Glad to have a growler of this bad boy."
"This is very nice and drinkable with good crisp carbonation."
"Overall this is a great beer, especially for a pale ale. Im usually into bigger IPA/DIPAs, but this brew can definately hold its own."
"D - not in love with this one though not bad at all; having a hard time putting my finger on a specific flavor/smell - more curious than good or bad; a little bitter for me at end but i'm not really a hop head; wondering if this has started to fade at all."
"This is the most flavorful pale ale I have ever tasted. A very solid beer that should probably be under the style of an IPA, but either way a very solid brew."
"O: Drank this chilled around 50 degrees. Nice drink for a warm day. Paired it with a cheesy brat and it was a good combination. Not real complex, but a nice, drinkable beer."
"Overall I didn't like this beer until after my first few drinks. Maybe because I had to trade for it and I might have had it on a pedestal, but it grew on me as it went down rather quickly. I think I could drink several of these and at a nice low abv, it would make for a long evening."
"O - Used to be my favorite APA... that is until zombie dust came out."
"O: A very good beer, and one that I wish were available in Ohio as it would definitely be a go-to summer beer."
"O-One pale to rule them all!"
"On the light side of medium bodied, soft and round and what I might call ""fleshy."" Quite palatable. Finishes with a moderately drying hoppy bitterness, but otherwise doesn't lean too far in any one direction. Nice."
"This one pours a beautiful amber color with about a half an inch thick head. The nose is a beautiful hoppy one. It's a nice smooth hoppy inhale. It's not beastly strong. The taste is sublime. It's got a sublime hoppy draw that's so smooth it's criminal. This isn't a taste bud scorcher at all. The hops are just perfect. Considering this is an APA versus an IPA, the hops are really forward all the way around. I'm not complaining. Over all this is a crazy solid beer. I've now been fortunate enough to have had Zombie Dust, Gumballhead, and now this. I have Dreadnaught, Arctic Panzer Wolf, and Apocalypse Cow out in the fridge. Can't wait to see how they stack up against this. Another winner from FFF. These guys are good."
"O - A good IPA. Can I have another please?"
"O - This is a great representation of an American Pale Ale. Just the right balance of darn near everything. Great beer."
"O - Over all this is another winner, especially for a pale ale! Whoa... Did not know pale ales could be this good. Very hop head friendly! Balanced hop and malts make this a great beer. THUMBS UP! Thanks Dave!"
"D - Super drinkable. Pretty much every aspect of this beer is excellently balanced. The hop profile is really fantastic from start to end and everything else just falls into place around that."
"Medium bodied with great carbonation, this beer is deceptively drinkable. The body is rather full and somewhat coating for the style but never becomes sticky. The carbonation has no noticeable fizz at all but seems to give the beer a great creaminess."
"Probably the most complex APA that I've sampled. Just a masterpiece of a beer. If you can get your hands on some Alpha King, don't hesitate to try this nectar."
"O-A week or so ago my friends wind to Indiana and gave me a call while I was work and asked if there was anything that I wanted from Indiana, and of course the first thing that came to mind was Three Floyds so this was in a mixed 6er that they brought back for me. I didn't really want to follow along with the pack and say something was good just because of the name on the baottle since this was my first experience with Three Floyds, but I do have to say that I wish I could pick some of this up in Iowa. I may have to make my own trip to pick some other FFF up, I can't wait to try some of the others in the 6er but unfortunatley they are not all FFF. If everything from them is this good I cant wait to try the others."
"I've had this in bottles and on tap at Three Floyds in Munster, IN. Pours a dark amber with an off-white head. Smells of piny, citrus hops and caramel malt. Taste is of high-alpha citrus hops with assertive bitterness and is beautifully balanced by rich caramel malts. It's really more of an IPA than an APA, but I like to give 3Floyds the benefit of the doubt. I love this beer. It's been my go-to for years and is a must-try for anyone."
"O: Overall, maybe this 6er was old, as its my first time trying this and it was a bit disappointing, albeit a good beer. It has a complicated taste, but it just doesn't move me or refresh me very much. I'd like to try this fresh on tap as I suspect this beer can / should be better than this."
"O: A thorough enjoyable, well made beer."
"Hazy browish-red pour with a one finger head, decent retention and lacing. Aroma is a brown-sugary citrus hop explosion with some almost thyme-like herbal notes. Big hop taste, pine, citrus, with nutty malt backbone. Full bodied and definitely drinks more like an IPA than an APA. Pretty darn good."
"O: Great on draft. Great out of the bottle."
"I could look forward to this as the last beer on earth, A+"
"O: I've had this before and this time around isn't as hoppy or flavorful as I remember it being before. Perhaps its not as fresh as the last time I had it, but its hard to say for sure without any dating on the bottle."
"All in all, this could easily be one of my new favorites. I'm pretty glad 3F doesn't distribute in my state because this could be dangerous. Oh well, it might be a good excuse, after eight months, to visit the girlfriend's family. Two thumbs up. My big toes, too."
"Pours a nice amber with a creamy white head. The head diminishes rather quickly, but leaves a great ring of lace around the sides of the glass. Nice smell of earthy hops and a sweet bread character. This beer flavor profile is very crisp and refreshing up front with a great balance of bitter hops on the backbone. Great balance and smooth delivery with each drink. The mouthful is right on point. Another solid beer by FFF. This is a staple beer in my fridge."
"The appearance is an amber tone with a larger one finger head. Alpha King has a smell that contains bread malts, some citrus hops, and flora. Upon tasting from my pint glass and I taste more citrus, some spice, also an appropriate amount of hops for the style. MF is medium with similar carbonation levels. All in all, a very nice APA, which I am glad that I finally got to try."
"M- Good carbonation and body. A bit creamy. Nothing to write home about."
"O: My first beer from FFF and I really like it. I hope to try more in the near future and eventually make it out to the brewery. I'll get there when I go to Chicago."
"O: Good example of the APA. More hoppy than its predecessors for sure, but just malty enough to hang on."
"A very nice pale ale overall, worth getting if you like pale ales."
"Cheers!"
"O: This is my style. It's hoppy for a pale ale, but if you view it as an IPA then it's incredibly balanced. The malt backbone really makes this very drinkable. One of my favorites in the style for sure."
"Overall this is an exceptional pale in every facet. Incredible piney, citrusy and bittersweet flavors. Has sufficient maltiness to balance out the hops. This one is worth seeking out pretty much any time."
"Pours a lovely copper tinted orange with only a faint cap of white bubbles, diminishes quickly into a small ring and splotch in the middle. Leaves some sticky lacing. First whiff is an attack of hops. Pungent notes of grapefruit and orange backed by notes of pine and a little apple cider to boot. Malt backbone is quite strong, husky kiln dried malts with the faintest touch of roast. Taste begins bitter, much stronger then any pale I have knows. Hops flavor is big on citrus (bitter grapefruit and orange rind) and the malt does more then just provide the backbone. The malt presence is high, but the sweetness is quite low. Medium bodied, smooth, creamy and very dry on the palate. This beer was quite a revalation... unexpected boldness throughout with the pale moniker as notes of IPAs and Barleywines danced on the tongue - and at 6.5% too."
"This is an easy drinking and flavorful APA. Hoppy, but not overpoweringly so. Still has a good malt balance."
"O - very good APA, dare i say that it reminds me of DR 11's little bro...i may have one tonight just to confirm or reject this thought. i would definitely get a keg of this as i said with gumball head."
"O: Probably the best Pale Ale I've ever had. I'm a hop head and this is easily the hoppiest pale ale I've ever had. It's easy drinking, a perfect 6.5%. This beer is one I'll be getting a steady supply of as it's one of the best beers I've ever had."
"This APA pours brilliantly clear very deep copper color with a clingy, white, soapy head. The aroma is intensely hoppy, loads of pine and good burst of citrus. Alpha King? Yes. The flavor is highly hoppy, citrus rind, floral and slightly piney. After the burst of hop flavor chewy, bready malt emerges and that is finally wiped clean by moderate hop bitterness. The beer finishes perfectly balanced between dryness from the hops and sweet, bready malt, very smooth and well rounded. The carbonation is medium-low and body medium. Overall this beer is incredible, deliciously hoppy, tremendous nose, and yet somehow a wonderful malt flavor emerges. One of the best APAs you can buy. Very highly recommended!"
"O: Awesome. One of the better american pale ales. Period."
"O - This is a very enjoyable beer with a taste that keeps me reaching for more worth picking up or trading for to give it a try"
"Pours a deep amber/orange with a beauitful white pillow one finger head. Lots of citrus and pine hops, with a malt sweetness supporting it the whole way. Taste is very balanced between a solid malt profile and some great hops. We could drink this bad boy all day."
"D- hop heads rejoice Alpha King is your loving regal savior. Drinkable and full flavored."
"Had on tap at Floyds / Growler and bottle. WOW! Enough cannot be said about this gem. Definitely one of the best pale ales Ive ever tasted. So balanced and wonderful. Aroma contains some fruit hints and hop character. Appearance beautiful golden brown/red. Taste amazingly balanced, the hops and malt are mated in the smoothest fashion. On the palate it is almost medium bodied with sweetness and hop covering your tongue. Overall I must say Three Floyds is an amazing craft brewer who has hit the mark with this and all their amazing beers. Definitely one of the best!"
"Overall, another solid offering from 3 Floyds that I wish I had regular access to. Their beers just continue to amaze me."
"poured into pint glass, rich amber in color with a miniscule amount of head that dissipates quickly. Nose is definitely malty, caramel and roastyness. On the tongue this thing rocks, very crisp. Lots of piney aromatic hops up front, but the malty backbone tones them down a bit through out the end. A good amount of grapefruit comes out when it warms up, with i think compliments the malty characteristic. excellent brew to go with a late summers night dinner, or to exhaust fatigue from a hard day's struggle."
"O- My favorite APA, although I would think this is more an IPA myself. The citrus and caramel malt are balanced very well which makes this a beer you can have quite a few of without destroying your taste buds. My favorite six pack offering from 3F and just a great beer all around. Highly recommended."
"The Alpha King pours out as a lightly hazy golden color. The head was thick and white. It's leaves a trail of lacing down the glass with each sip. This beer smells very hoppy with a good amount of malt too. The taste of the beer has a good amount of pine like flavors and some sweet malts in the mix. The mouthfeel tingles the taste buds. Overall it's a really good Pale Ale. Well worth the wait and look forward to having more one day."
"This is an excellent beer. It may lean more toward the IPA style than Plae Ale; in fact, it's actually hoppier than some IPAs I have tasted."
"wish this was on west coast shelves, it'd be a go-to for me."
"The mouthfeel is superb, it's got a lighter body, but still feels full and coating on the backend. This gives the brew a nice, satisfying finish. The drinkability is exceptional, especially considering the relatively high ABV for an APA. Overall, this is just a great pale ale that I'd love to be able to keep on hand at all time. It's just perfectly executed with absolutely no rough ends, a true masterwork of brewing."
"You all our lucky, those who get this distribute on the reg."
"My pour was as aggressive as Nick would have wanted, I am sure. I ended up with a finger-and-a-half of rocky tawny head with retention like a bad guest: it would not go away. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Now, before I say, ""BUPGOO!", imagine putting this in kids' hands ... How about a box of matches to go with? Even after all of that thinking and typing, the head was still hanging in, leaving behind the kind of lacing that will require a jackhammer to remove later. Nose had the kind of upfront hops intensity that seared my nostrils! Really, it was big on piney hops and underlain with caramel malt sweetness. This should be an air freshener, especially for my classroom. Mouthfeel was creamy, exploding with hops initially and then letting the malt get a chance. I amend my initial take on the mouthfeel to ""oily"". Man, they squeezed those hops for all that they were worth! Once more, I began to hear my Hops Monkey screeching for his Jones. F**k! I rue the day Victory Hop Devil touched my lips and sent me down the road to Perdition. I am a Hops Junkie, nay, a Hops Fiend and every time I wean myself off the hops, a beer comes along to pull me back in. Finish had the hops that I crave and although the malt tried to assert itself, I was focused on dem hops, baby. S**t, what can I hock in this dump and get some scratch? I need to be on the road, like tomorrow if not sooner, so I can score some more of this! Hey, man, is it normal to itch like this? My skin is crawlin'. Dig, my neighbor across the way deals in hops, so maybe I can cop a taste to hold me over. He lets me buy a pellet at a time, just to dissolve under my tongue. Yo, lemme get a hit of some Columbus or some Amarillo, bro. He's down, but I gotta hit the source (again). This tongue-poppin' bottle-swiilin' nonsense ain't makin' it. I gotta get a hit offa the tap, baby!"
"Yep, yep, the good ol' days when doozies like this were [legitimately] distributed to PA. Pours a hazy golden amber with a fluffy white head that retains well and leaves some nice lacing. Pleasantly hoppy aroma with lots of citrus and pale malts. Delightfully light on the palate, with a great balance of light, sweet malts, and crisp, citrus hops. Finishes crisp and just dry enough. Light-medium mouthfeel, and extremely drinkable."
"Seems like more of an IPA than and APA, but tasty nonetheless. One of my go-to brews for a hop fix."
"The mouthfeel does fall a little short: a bit more carbonation would put this over the top for me. Even with a slightly dull feel to it, Alpha King is an easy-to-drink beer with a touch of complexity, and it does a nice job straddling the APA/IPA border."
"I have 6 other 3F beers to try in the next couple of weeks in the fridge, gonna do 1 a day to really enjoy them, i'm guessing this is just the tip of the iceberg for me and this brewery!"
"I enjoyed it quite a bit, as I was in the mood for a hoppier beer and this definitely fit the bill, especially for style. I was also impressed with how thick this beer was for the style."
"This is a perfect example of what a pale ale can be. If I could get this regular I would be a very happy man but I'm glad I got the opportunity to try this one out."
"O: FFF's Alpha King is one hell of a nice APA. I had no idea it was packing 6.5% ABV, as the alcohol isn't detectable. I could easily put a sixer of this back in a sitting. Highly recommended, the balance of flavors is spot-on."
"O: very drinkable and enjoyable pale ale, flavors are not very complex but are well balanced, will definitely seek this beer out again"
"O: Like I said, this is my go-to beer, so this is the one I'm all about. I love just about everything about this one."
"Is this the best Pale Ale I’ve had? Yes, yes I think it just may well be. Damned tasty, aromatic and beautiful to look at and it’s going down oh so fast. Will do my best to savor the rest of the 6-pack since it may be some time before I can try this again."
"This is an APA I could enjoy every day for a couple of years or so. If I could get it every day it might replace sierra nevada as my every day beer or every other day beer. A ruby/amber color with good ivory lace this beer looks good, smells good, and taste like citrus and fresh hops. Good day."
"This pours cloudy amber and has nice fluffy head and good lacing. There are a lot of notable hops on the nose, surprising for a pale ale. The amount of malt is also outstanding, but not surprising once you've seen the dark color. This pale ale is delicious and crisp. There isn’t quite the hop presence that would be in an IPA, but the balance of strong bitterness and heavy malty sweetness packs a powerful yet sessionable flavor combo. The body is fairly heavy for a pale ale, but again, easy to drink."
"O- I'd say this is the quintessential American Pale Ale, but it's more of an IPA by style. I don't care what it is; it's good. In a sea of breweries with hype surrounding them, FFF is truly not a pretender. This is their flagship beer, and boy, does it ever represent what they stand for...big hops, big malt, big beers and shattering of style guidelines. FFF always does what they want to, and other breweries try to emulate or jealously choose to ignore what they're doing. Bow Down!"
"this beer pours a nice hazy golden color with a thick sticky off white head that hangs to the sides of the glass. the smell is piney and floral, and it sticks in your nose, this beer smells more like an ipa than a pale ale. the taste follows the smell with a wonderful pine flavor up front followed by some nice hop bitterness and a well rounded malt finish. the mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a resinous well carbonated feel. overall this is the best pale ale i have ever had."
"M - Mouthfeel is a creaminess and then the bite at the end, leaves the palate dry and wanting a nother drink but not parched"
"The beer itself is pretty low in alcohol content, which makes this a dangerous beer to fall in love with. But it’s got such a good aftertaste, I will drink until I can’t drink no more! Plus, the logo is sick. Sick and creepy! This is a great beer, and not what you expect from a beer made right here in the Hoosier state. Funny thing is, their Dark Lord is oftentimes voted as the best beer in the world. It’s also nearly impossible to get."
"Im not sure if the hop character worked for me. Its a great beer but I feel like some hybrids like OSCAR, were more of a mix as opposed to being for hopheads. I liked it but, I feel like if youre looking for the feel of an APA with the mouthfeel of IPA, its not for you. FFF has a signature hop in most of their beers which is great, just something about this beer its not an A beer to me."
"Overall: This is a beer that I enjoy a lot. I wish I could get this one regularly"
"Overall it's a good beer...much move enjoyable than dreadnaught."
"O - Great Pale Ale. Could not find a freshness date on the bottle and I suspect it's just a little past it's prime, but still a great example of an APA. Would like more on a hot summer day."
"O - A very enjoyable and slightly different APA"
"o – overall a very solid pale ale indeed with a nice malt backbone."
"O-overall this is a great APA that borderlines an IPA. i'm not sure where the line is drawn on this one. its definitely a tasty beer that would be a go to of mine if more readily available in my area. the tastes are strong and definitely form a lasting impression on your palate. it goes down way too quickly."
"O: For a style I usually do not enjoy, this was one of the better beers I have had in this style. A great summer beer. I could see myself drinking a few of these at a session."
"D: A very easy drinking pale ale, with the hop aroma minus the alcohol and bite of a full IPA"
"D: A solid sessionable brew. Extremely drinkable. Very nice for style...which seems to be closer to an IPA (as numerous people have already said). Enjoyed this prior to grilling burgers...Thanks Kris!"
"O - Drinks very easily. I may have gotten an old bottle in a trade."
"Seems like this is a hit for certain beer drinkers, but for those with my tastes it's best to avoid. Overall it's just a wacky, piney taste that somehow seems shouldn't be in any drink."
"O: As scores of other reviewers have mentioned, this would be more aptly deemed an IPA, but that's not all too bad. I can definitely see why this brew has earned such acclaim; it is quite enjoyable. My biggest complaint is that it is lacking what every IPA should have; a big, frothy, meringue-like head. Despite this error, Alpha King remains one of the best APAs I've come across."
"Worthless information to this review: Years ago when this was easier to get here in PA, I used to buy this and it was one of the beers that turned me severely steered me in the direction of hoppy beers. I will always have a place in my heart (and wallet) for this beer, it's one I will never grow tired of. It's a first class beer."
"D-Over this is an exceptional APA. almost an IPA for me. love the flavors and balance. If you havent had this beer try it. its super tasty"
"Enough with the analysis, this is one of hell of beer. A job well done by Three Floyds. Recommended."
"O: When drinking this, I was expecting a fuller version of their Pride and Joy ale. What I got was a fruitier brew with more distinct flavors. All things considered, though, I can’t say that I think it’s a better beer – it’s about on par with P&J. The non-sessionable version of one of my favorite session brews. Great stuff!"
"I usually prefer the more hoppy APAs, but this is just awesome. Overall a fantastic APA. Might be the best one I've had."
"O--I usually prefer the more hoppy Pales, but this offers something new. It does the style well."
"Overall a very good beer, though I'm usually more of an IPA guy. Delicious. Would drink again."
"O (D) - Excellent beer. It lives up to its reputation."
"O: Buy this beer. Trade for this beer. /drool"
"O - Good beer. Pushes the line between styles but very drinkable."
"This is my deserted island beer!"
"Overall- One of the best APA's I've had yet! I haven't been exposed to many APA's in general, but this just became my #1 on my list. Thanks Mark! The drinkability was pleasant, and such great characteristics with this beer. I would recommend this to anyone trying new styles or need a good APA. Haven't seen this one around St. Louis before and glad to have had the opportunity to have a cousin out of town who gets good beer in Indiana. Cheers Mark!"
"O: Good. Always a great treat to try some Three Floyds beers, being so far from them. Hope to see their Brewery some day."
"O-this is a nice, well-built, and very drinkable beer with a nice ""green"" hoppy flavor that goes down easy and doesn't overpower. (except for maybe being a little overly bitter) I'm not a huge fan of super hoppy beers, but when I get a craving for some hops, this one is on my short list."
"O: I prefer my Pale Ales to be a little more stripped down and simplistic with subtle nuances (again with the SNPA). This is trying a little too hard to be great and forgets to be good first. 2/5"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, with a solid, lasting, off-white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing. Beer is a very deep copper red. Aroma has strong citrus/pine notes, with some evidence of herbal tea in the background. Taste also has floral hoppy notes, with an understated burnt caramel presence as well. Mouthfeel is just a bit thin. Overall, a very enjoyable take on the style; another winner from FFF."
"This reminded me more of an IPA in the nose, though the hops and malts did balance out a bit more in the taste. A very well done APA overall."
"Love this beer! Pours a perfect darkish-golden and smells of awesome grapefruity-ness. The hops really stand out, as in most 3 Floyds beers. Head was 1.5"" and laced fairly nicely along the glass. This might be my favorite overall beer, and it's quite drinkable."
"12 oz bottle poured into a ccb pint glass. Pours reddish brown with a thin head, not a bad lookin beer at all. Aroma of crazy hops with some malts. Is this an ipa? Taste follows the nose but with a little more balance Of hops and malts. Finishes with tangy hops on the tongue. The is a really good beer, it's one of those pales like dales pale ale that borders on an ipa."
"O: I've had IPA's that don't deliver what this beer does. Really a spectacular example of what is possible in an APA."
"Alpha King does seem more like an IPA than a true APA. I ain't complaining because that's just my game! I will be looking for a clone to brew and if you know me, you know that is the ultimate compliment. well done, FFF."
"Maybe my expectations were just too high here for a brew titled the Alpha King. As far as hops go this one is definitely not the King. Maybe back in the day this was considered hoppy? Overall a decent brew but a bit heavy on the malt flavors and aromas for the hops to really shine in my opinion. Perhaps one I will not be seeking out again any time soon with the many other options these days. Glad to have tried though."
"Overall it's just an OK pale ale. Not bad, just not great. If you have the option of buying a Daisy Cutter (and I know this isn't really a fair option to many), buy the DC. Daisy Cutter is by far a top example of the APA style, and has a certain crispness to it that Alpha King can't boast."
"Thanks again to Sean9689, for an excellent beer. I will definitely be seeking this out when i am in the distro area."
"Pretty easy to drink beer, light bodied and perfectly carbonated with some refreshing bubbles that cleanly remove the bitterness after your taste buds are done with it. A solid example of a well made pale ale."
"A very pleasantly dry and bitter finish with a light-medium body and reasonable ABV that makes it very difficult not to knock back all six of my stock at one sitting.."
"All in all a tasty beer that holds interest. Not my idea of an APA, but well worth checking out just the same."
"Overall: I'm probably underrating this. To be fair it's pretty good."
"D- easy to drink and quite affordable. ill have another glass. check this one out if you havnt already. i think i liked it better on tap than in the bottle."
"A fantastic beer from an awesome brewery."
"Poured a copper color with quite a bit of beige head on it. Lots of citrus and floral hops in the aroma, great smelling beer. Taste is about the same as the smell, good hop flavor with some citrus notes as well. Pretty well balanced beer. Easy to drink, light mouthfeel, this beer went down really smooth. I really really liked this beer a lot. I'll definitely be looking for it in the future."
"A damn crisp and tasty hop forward ale, that I would argue doesn't quite fit the category it is placed in. That aside, a very enjoyable beer that I wish i could get my hands on back home."
"Drink ability is good, and overall, a wicked tasty apa!"
"There has yet to be a day when this wouldn’t bring a smile to my face. Just an amazing beer and beyond worthy of the reviews."
"Copper amber with very little head and no lacing. A bit of sweet maltiness in the aroma as well as some tropical fruit and pine. Taste is a nice balance of mildly sweet malts and floral hops. Low carbonation and body. Quite drinkable, but nothing exceptional."
"First review! It's about time."
"Notes: Alpha King is brewed with Centennial, Cascade and Warrior hops and is one of 3 Floyds flagship brews. I've seen a sixer of this at pretty much every Citywide and Belmont in the area, as well as Martin's Supermarket."
"O: excellent pale ale; thought it wouldn't be hoppy enough for my liking, but it definitely hit the spot"
"Cheers!"
"Overall I'm sad I only bought one of these, but I would definitely seek this one out actively again. A great citrus pale ale that I could enjoy any time of the year."
"O: Pretty good pale ale, but I'm underwhelmed (though I had high expectations). Not something I'd search out again but nice to try once. Hope my bottle was fresh and an accurate representation of this beer."
"Overall: This is absolutely one of my all-time favorite beers. Three Floyds works such wonderously hoppy magic that really raises the bar for the style. I could drink this beer every day."
"O-amazing, get this if you can, no way this is just a pale ale cause it kicks all other pale ale asses"
"Mouthfeel is smooth with a rough ended as mentioned in the taste, but overall it's a crisp and juicy beer. This isn't its strong point, but I think it traded this for the taste and nose. Drinkability is quite good on the other hand as the beer is well balanced and only slightly harsh at the end. I think I get the fervor around this brewery after having this and some of their other beers - everything is phenomenal."
"I've been on BA for over a year now and have had several Alpha Kings. In an effort to temper my bias i've tried several other APA's to compare. Honestly, they don't measure up. It's a great beer from a great brewery. I truly am fortunate living in Indiana. If you can buy it, do so, if not, buddy up with someone and trade for it."
"Overall, this is a solid APA. Alpha King has it all. Lots of citrus, hops and a great malt backbone. Three Floyds has done a great job crafting this brew. Highly recommended for the style."
"Overall this is one of my favorites of the style."
"o: Very good beer. Similar to others out there, though there is nothing wrong with that. I would have liked a stronger presence of the citrus in the finish, though the sweetness you get as it all washes away made this a great beer to start the night with. Very good."
"This pours a burnt orange with a nice, tight, one finger head that faces down to a collar and leaves good lace behind. On the nose are earthy, caramel malts that I don't remember being around before, but on top of that is a huge orange peel and other citrus note assortment. In the mouth is more of the same, maybe with the caramel hanging back a bit further and the orange peel mixed with some dirtiness, really a great hop profile that's a little different than the centennial bombs I'm most familiar with like Two-Hearted. The body is on the thin side of medium with a big bitter finish. It goes down really fast and my two bottles were gone quickly. One of the great fake session brews of the Upper Midwest, at least those that I've had experience with, and something of a high-water mark for pale ales."
"A good draft. When I put it in the pond of pale ales, I rate it towards the top. Yet the hoppiness almost warrants it being amongst ipa's, in which case I'd put it towards the middle of its peers. How you review it depends on if you wanna group it with the label's title or your or your palate's."
"Conclusion: This is a great ""anytime brew."" It's perfect for just about any occasion, and a good beer to kick off spring."
"Drinkability: Full of hop flavor, but doesn't pack the bitter whallop of an IPA or IIPA. Very well-balanced from the perspective of someone who likes a hoppier APA. Highly sessionable, and highly recommended. One of my new go-to beers in Indy, my new home town."
"What a great surprise this was. Thanks to claaark13 for sending this extra my way. He was the second mid westerner to send this to me as an extra. Must be rough having this one cluttering the shelves at the local bottle shop."
"Served from a bottle in to a pint glass. Pours a nice amber-y copper-y color. Lacing sticks to the side of the glass all the way down and lives on when the beer is gone. There's a nice citrus smack to the scent that carries on to the taste. There's a bitter / sour grapefruit taste that hits me pretty hard as well. That seems to make the alcohol feel a littler higher to my mouth than rated. That bitter bite kept going thru the whole glass and one or two would be enough for me in an evening."
"D: Not as drinkable as I'd hoped."
"A really well balanced beer here. Very sessionable in this guys opinion."
"I found this beer very amiable, and incredibly drinkable. The best Three Floyd's offering I have had to date, and I think I have to include Dark Lord in that statement as well."
"Drink and overall: A very good Pale Ale. Very good. Easy drinking, yet packs the flavor you want, yet keeps the ABV to a drink-more-than-three level. Highly recommended."
"D- Very drinkable, well balanced. The malts and bready/woody taste mixed with the hops and the piney taste makes this brew excellent. Highly recommend this one."
"Taste is quite bitter, lots more harsh flavors rather than the light fruitiness that the nose implied. There is a pretty strong graininess that takes the flavor down a bit, but it's still a tasty beer. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy and smooth."
"D- Easy to drink but really surprised me, not really a Pale Ale, but still really good. I wish I could get this more often!"
"D - This is different. It is really sweet to start and hoppy on the finish. I love the smell. I think I need to do some more research (drinking) on this one."
"D- I could down multiple pints because of the mouthfeel and taste. Glad I had this great beer on Tap."
"My first beer from Three Floyds did not disappoint. Can't wait to try more of their brews. Alpha King would constantly be in my fridge if I had access to it."
"The mouth is full and very thick for the style while the head hangs around and leaves nice spots and legs of lace around the glass. Just an overall fantastic beer that does everything right and will sorely be missed."
"Heavy-bodied, Alpha King is a big and assertive brew for IPA-lovers (though it's categorized as an American Pale Ale), and a definite winner. I'll be drinking more of these!"
"drinkability good a nice beer pretty easy to drink a few will drink this again soon"
"Pours a dark amber with a fingers worth of off white head. Quite a bit of grapefruit hops in the nose. Just a little bready malt mixed in. Taste is similar with the malt coming forward more to balance the hops almost perfectly. Theres a fair amount of bitterness from the hops but it's not overpowering at all. Carbonation is perfect. There's a nice a residual hop resin that coats the palate after every sip. Body may be a bit on the heavy side for the style which keeps drinkability down a bit."
" A bit on the hoppy side overall for an APA, but I absolutely love this beer."
"d- this is a really nice apa, nice and hop forward like i like them. i'd drink this again for sure, not sure if it's something i'd trade for again but would be more than happy to knock back a few more."
"This beer pours a dark golden color, with a good size head that lasted through out the beer. There is a strong hoppy and grapfruit aroma. There is a strong hoppy taste, but it lacks that bite that some pale ales have, also a bitter grapefruit like taste is detectable. Not very carbonated and could use some more carbonation. Overall a REALLLY good beer, I enjoyed this one."
"Cheers to the Alpha King!"
"Overall, one of the best pale ales I've had."
"D: This beer is drinkable. However, the taste puts me off a bit. Wish there were less early bittering hops to prevent such severe dryness."
"Drinkability: I like this beer and am likely to pick some up again in the future."
"Drinkability: Very good drinking beer that I would buy the hell out of it were readily available to me. Another good brew from Three Floyds."
"I was very impressed."
"D - A good staple session APA, I've had better and I've had worse, but not a bad one to try."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. As I look back on the notes, I describe it as inoffensive but not very inspired or worth seeking out. A standby in Three Floyds rotation, it wouldn't be hard to find something comparable in local shelves."
"Look forward to trying it again at the earliest possible opportunity!"
"Medium bodied and very hop forward for the style with a blast of bitter, earthy hops that are countered by sweet citrus presence and a subtle malt backbone. Hints of pine needle, grapefruit, citrus peel, mango and pineapple as well as a subtle biscuit/graham cracker flavor that provides nice balance. This beer is much closer to an IPA than a pale ale with lots of oily, resinous hop flavor and a nice dry finish. Complex, well balanced and extremely quaffable. Recommended."
"Okay there is not much I can add to the reviews already given. This is a great APA. I give it 4s to 4.5s across the board. It's an A beer. If you can find it, drink it. Watch dating however. I really liked it and wish I had picked up more than one bottle from the store."
"This is a good beer, and I enjoyed it very much. I'd wouldn't have more than one is a session, but I will definitely have another one of these beers! Great beer."
"This beer pours a dark orange with hints of brown in the middle. Quick head leaving decent lacing. It has a musty orange bitterness smell with lemon citrus. Taste is very bitter, a very good hop bomb. Powerful orange and grapefruit with grassy undertones. This beer leaves a tackiness in your mouth with some malty sugar stick. A good beer and I would definitely like more!"
"D: Really easy to drink. A great beer."
"Massive thanks to aasher for this as an extra in a past in-person trade. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured yellow-orange with a two and a half finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, chocolate, citrus, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty excellent brew. Very well balanced and complex. Not too much missing on this one. If you haven't tried this before, get off your ass or trade for it. You won't be disappointed."
"D - A good beer to enjoy over a long period of time. Not one to drink many of, but one to savor and make last a while."
"D - Extremely drinkable, had no problem finishing most of a growler by myself. The finish leads me to keep drinking more and more. There's nothing too special about it, but when I finish my glass I realize how good it was and pour another. I'd definitely like to get some more of this. One of the better American Pale Ale's I've had, holding its own with a lot of IPA's."
"D: Phenomenal APA for the hopheads. Had this beer on draft in Chicago and it tastes just as good down here out of the bottle. Would love to have access to Three Floyds."
"Pours a beautiful amber gold with a ton of white head. The head hangs out for ever and there is beautiful lacing on the glass. Smells hoppy and malty. Smells as hoppy as any IPA I've had. some light citrus and piney hints on the nose. Tastes very balanced between a solid malt profile and some great hops. Pine and citrus on the tongue. A bit of grapefruit as well. Very good mouthfeel and very drinkable. A top notch brew"
"This was one of the first craft beers I fell in love with and sometimes I forget about this beer, however, it never disappoints. Well done!"
"D-A damn fine Midwest APA masquerading as a West coast IPA. My favorite American Pale Ale so far."
"D: Pretty damn high. Admittedly, I'm biased--I cut my craft beer teeth on Alpha King and Gumballhead, but this brew really is tops in the $10/six pack Chicago market. It trumps many other beers in the style, for sure. Great hop and malt complexity for an acceptable price."
"D - A very easy drinking pale ale. Hits the malt/hop balance just right, which isn't easy to do. Would've liked a little more body to the beer. Well worth seeking out."
"D - A very drinable beer, not something I'm reaching for first in the fridge but definitely a old standby that I could always rely on. Bummed out that FFF doesn't distribute to Ohio. That needs to happen again."
"This is one to savor."
"The CPJ"
"Big American Pale Ale - a hop lover's cult beer and Three Floyds' flagship beer, I understand, is brewed with centennial, cascade, and warrior hops. Pours a reddish amber/dark copper hue. Not much going on with the nose but pick up a little citrus aroma. Taste a bold citrus hop character. Mouthability was the highlight of this beer. Drinks down smooth and dangerously. A close second best Pale Ale I ever had next to Stone Pale Ale. I really wish Three Floyds would start dating their bottles so I would be able to fully vouch the freshness of a 3f beer."
"D: This is one wicked Pale Ale. Drinking it again after so many months I am reminded why I love this beer so."
"This is by far my favorite beer. Its a little subdued from its age. I will update when I get a fresher batch."
"D: Quite enjoyable."
"This beer pours a nice clear amber color with an ecru foam on the surface. The smell is mainly of hop characteristics such as grapefruit and floral notes. There are some hints on the nose of caramel, but they aren't too strong. The taste is interesting, as it is a combination of hop fruitiness and a slight nutty background. The pale malt is still rather hidden behind both of those flavors. The mouthfeel has some bitterness that you'd assume with an IPA, but it's still quite a drinkable beer and an interesting take on an APA."
"D: This glass went down fast, let's hope FFF starts distributing across Ohio again soon."
"Somewhat disappointed. I've heard such great things about this beer, but I'm finding it to be kind of blah. I'm on the third of a six pack, so it isn't just one bad bottle. FFF needs to start bottle dating, especially for these hoppy brews. Not sure if this is old or what. I had a friend bring this back from Indiana for me, but based on this experience, I will not try this beer again until the FFF starts dating bottles."
"D- not sure how fresh this is thanks to FFF and their lack of dating, but it's damn good...not as hoppy as SNPA, but very easy to drink. I wonder how this would taste on draught. The ABV is hidden extremely well. I can see why this is ranked so highly"
"D - Staple session beer that I'll need to get some of my IPA-avid friends to try. I think they'd be quite surprised that it's a Pale Ale considering the amount of that bitterness."
"Overall, a really impressive American Pale Ale. Certainly up there with the best of the style. The really strong hop character is definitely the emphasis here and this beer's biggest strength."
"on-tap at Bar Deville. Hard to go wrong with 3F's. Great pour from the bartender. Rich amber color with a hoppy but balanced nose. What a great beer. Will do a bottle review sometime too. Try it for yourself. If you can find it. I go out sometimes even when I feel like kicking back and watching a movie to drink this on-tap because 6 packs are so hard to find, even though this brewery is not far from Chicago."
"Light to medium in the feel with a modest amount of carbonation. Quite a bold, herbal hop character with toasty caramel to offset the bitterness. This is a very solid brew that is easy drinking."
"d- Really good. I am starting to think that IPAs are all really drinkable but the flavor on this one keeps it apart from the rest. I really enjoy this beer"
"Medium bodied with an average amount of carbonation. Fairly drinkable, but I've had other APAs that I enjoy more."
"I sucked this one down. For some reason I like this better the second time around. It helps to go into it not expecting a pale ale."
"d. i could drink an infinite amount of this beer and continue to be happy and curiously engaged."
"Had on tap at Pazzos in lexington, came to me a amber orange color with a nice fluffy white head that lingered for a good amount of time and left a small amount of lacing on the glass. The smell was fresh hops citrus lemon and perhaps some tropical fruit. Taste was just what I expected fresh citrus hops with a good bready malt backbone and a great zesty hop finish! Mouthfeel is very smooth and almost creamy, good amount of carbonation which brings out the hops in this beer even more. Drinkability is great this is a great session beer by three floyds!"
" Overall an excellent example of the style."
"All in all, this is a great brew. It would be awesome if I had access. This would be a regular 6 pack in my fridge at all times. Definitely give this a try for a very well done session brew. Definitely worth hunting."
"Really nice Pale Ale"
"D: Although this is an excellent APA, I wouldn't say that it's especially easy to drink. It's a big APA, with more body than most, which makes it a sipper, but I'd say sipping is very easy to do. I only had one bottle of this, but was perfectly satisfied with it and may had ended it there if another one was in the fridge. Lower drinkability doesn't take away from its quality, however, and I'd love to get a few more of these."
"D - I'm finding this very drinkable and even at the ABV, i can see myself having several in a sitting. This is more hop forward than many beers in the style and i'm loving it for that. This is a solid APA. This is easily one of my favorites along side Sierra Nevada, Dales Pale Ale. Too bad is not sold in California."
"D: Very good pale ale - good session beer. Terrifiic smell. It seems like it's trying to get as close to being an IPA without crossing the line. One of the best Pale Ales I've had."
"D- I down a sixer w/o thinking, and the draft pints go down as smooth"
"I'm really impressed. This is a very good beer. I think it is clearly falling into the IPA style guidelines. Much too big to be a pale ale. Fantastic, I would like to try others from this brewery."
"D- Alpha King was who I thought it was! This is the best APA on the planet. There are so many flavors and balance in the brew. It's definitely sessionable and tasty. I swear if this brewery could ever get to Syracuse, I would drink mountains of this stuff! I will get to Munster somehow this summer"
"d-this is one of my favorite beers. It really works well as a session for someone like me who loves hops. This is an APA on steroids."
"This is an amazing session beer if you are a hop head. So much hop flavor and aroma in a nice drinkable package. This is only the third FFF beer I have tried and so far they are three for three. Probably one of the best American Pales that I have ever had."
"DELICIOUS, MUST TRY!"
"There is no date printed on the bottle, but it's been in my fridge for a good six months. Perhaps the hop aromas would be more overpowering in a fresher example, but I enjoy this beer very much."
"Overall- A bit on the hoppy side overall for an APA, but I absolutely love this beer. Best. Pale. Ale. In. The. World."
"One of my favorite APA's hits the Palate just right!!!"
"D: This is one hell of a beer. 6.5% ABV is a tad high to be truly sessionable. However, it wouldn't be difficult in the least for me to polish off a sixer of this on my own."
"Drink- I want more. I have to get more. Every beer drinker should have this APA."
"One of my top 3 beers since I first tried it 3 years ago..."
"D: Very good. Two pints or so would be fine."
"All in all this is another great beer from the guys at FFF."
"Overall, this beer is great! Highly recommended. As mentioned, it tastes like a beefed up Pride and Joy. A little more hop presence which is great. I definitely would choose this over the Pride and Joy if both are available."
"This beer pours a deep copper color, with a white head. This beer has a great citrus hop aroma to it. The flavor is fairly strong with citrus hops, there is a bit of a lingering citrus hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium light. Overall its a drinkable beer."
"I'm not sure how this is classified as just a pale ale, but I'm really impressed with this beer. And at over 6% I'm sure I could get in trouble with a few of these. The citrus is bright and fresh and the malt is quite tasty."
"D - I wish I had more of this so I could (try to) session it."
"This brew pour a beautiful orange/amber color with a great head. It definitely smells of hops and citrus. Hops are much more subtle than I expected, as the smell is much stronger than the taste. Perhaps the most refreshing pale ale I've ever tried. Initial citrus and hop flavor dominate as I drink with an ever so slight sweetness, and a mild bitterness kicks in as it goes down. A perfect balance of bittering, flavor, and aroma hops are used in this brew. Lacing is evident all the way down to my last sip. Tastes like it should be around 4 to 5% ABV, but is 6.5%."
"longer. i love how close it is to an ipa, and stradles the line but the malt just holds it back enough. i wish i had a steady supply of this beer so i could experiment more but alas, it cant be true. ive just begun experimenting with three floyds beers, but this one certainly helps point me in the right direction."
"D - Excellent beer, wish everyone had access to this one. Hard to drink just one but its all I got. Enough said."
"Juicy, grainy, biscuity malts. Citrusy, sweet fruity hops. Nice color, not much head, but not bad at all. Amazing overall. A great session beer. One of my absolute favorites of any style. Can't believe how much flavor this has for an APA. Almost an IPA, but not quite."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, a little chewy. Very refreshing and easy to drink with plenty of solid flavor. Even with the higher ABV for the style, everything meshes well."
"D- Very pleasant taste make this beer one to drink on a regular basis."
"Very good beer. Not my favorite style and the hoppy/malty split is somewhat confusing. Beer hides its alcohol level."
"Of the bigger, hoppier pale ales (Dale's, etc), I think this is definitely best in class."
"Slightly too malt focused for my tastes."
"Overall: Definitely closer to an IPA than a pale ale, but the malty sweetness does pull it a little closer to style. Its a big tasty brew nonetheless and a great choice for a flagship beer."
"And calling an IPA a pale ale isn't ""pushing the envelope", it's just mislabeling."
"The flavor reflects the smell mostly. I've a feeling I should have gotten this fresher somehow but I'm glad to be able to try it either way. The flavor is balanced and the hops that do come though are citrus all the way. A nice bittersweet edge with lemon feeling most prominent. The malt is sweet and kind of dry, it reminds me of a brown ale at this point. Overall a good APA by my standards but sadly I feel I've an old bottle so....bummer."
"D: A good Pale Ale that is really much more of an IPA, but still good none the less."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"better than most, IPA's) Another great brew from those bros in Munster."
"Drinkability? OMFG... Seriously... Keep 'em coming. If this was readily available in my area, it would be my ""go to"" beer. For the style, Three Floyds knocked this one out of the park."
"Medium body that is just a little sticky from the hops. Carbonation is pretty high. Overall, a very bold pale that is very well balanced and easy to drink. Always enjoyable to get a hold of some Alpha King."
"Drinkability: Excellent. Just a well done beer. I wish it was distributed here."
"Poured into a pint glass, has a nice head for a bit, gives pretty lacing like you would expect. It looks really good. The taste is where it loses me a little. It's good, but I think there are others that are better. Pretty drinkable, could easily sip at it all day..."
"NOTE: This strandles the fence on becoming an IPA. But I'm certainly not one to shy away from an overly hopped pale ale. Keep them coming."
"D - Brewer manufactured this beer with hop characteristics dominating this brew; brewer did a good job constructing this beer; would have a lot more"
"I Am - Alpha King - Bun Dee. Tee-hee. This Hoosier icon pours a clear auburn-amber topped by a finger of light-ish ecru foam. The nose comprises sticky pine, Squirt-style grapefruit, a tiny bit o' honeydew, flowers, and a decidedly understated undercurrent of caramel. The taste brings the caramel forward, but doesn't forget about the pine and the grapefruit (which itself leans a bit toward the white grape area). The body is a nice medium, with a very-light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very good brew, more than worthy of its reputation. Get some!"
"Drinkability: Very well balanced, with amazing hop presence. This beer really impressed me and I will definitely grab another if I have the opportunity."
"The beer tastes solidly bitter with a resinous, sticky hoppiness. There is a little malt sweetness, caramel, and biscuit as the beer warms that was absent at first. The carbonation was good, and there was really good body and a medium chewiness. Highly drinkable, but I could've used more hop aroma and flavor, as well as a better malt character."
"D: I have a whole growler waiting for me tonight. I believe this will do the trick and the abv is just right."
"Side note, definitely drink this one fresh. Had them fresh and with about a month on it, and while it is still great, its a different beer fresh."
"D: I will be seeking this out again. This is the second Three Floyds beer that I have imbibed, and I am blown away so far. I knock this down just a notch because the bitterness detracts from session-ability a little bit, which I find to be a key component of a pale ale."
"D- A little too much bite. Kinda got heart burn after 2 or 3. so, that would kill this being a 'drink a sixer'. All in all, a good beer though; Very tasty."
"D: I absolutely love this beer. What played against it is that if you handed me this beer and asked me what style it was, I would say it was an IPA. It would be a let down if I hated that style or was really in the mood for an APA. Put that aside, very easy to drink and great flavor. I would definitely get this again!"
"D/O- It would be a blast to have 2 or 3 of these in a night but the way that these go down - so would you, in my opinion. Great great APA. Cheers Three Floyds."
"D: Three Floyds is yet to disappoint me and I must say all of there beers are damn near all A+ on drink-ability."
"Great stuff, a slightly different animal from what I remember -- the green & resinous character is overshadowed by citrus & pine this time around, falling a little more in traditional American IPA territory. Still damn fine, & easily quaffable -- I could drink this all evening."
"Drinkability: Not difficult to drink, but not interesting enough to make me want another. Just because this brewery makes some real gems, doesn't mean that everything it makes is good, or even competent."
"D - Good, clean, dry finish. Refreshing and easy drinking, but the astringency is a little distracting."
"I would like to have a more drinkable Pale Ale. Yet, I will seek out this one again because styles aside, this is a very good beer. However, as I said before, is reminiscent of the quintessential American Strong Ale to me."
"D: A very good APA although the resiny character is a bit overpowering in the on-tap format."
"D - Delicious and drinkable APA. Quite hoppy for the style but am a fan of the Hops. ABV is perfect and flavors work well together. Good job FFF."
"D. Reviewing this beer after a 3 year void of Alpha King from Iowa. This bottle brought from Wisconsin. This is a damn good beer. I think this is pretty much the style guideline for an APA."
"D - I think this bottle may be old but it isn't dated so I have no clue. A decent pale ale but not nearly as hoppy and delicious as I remember when I had it in the past. Hopefully I'll have a chance to try this again."
"I personally don't like IPA's so I marked it as a low drinkablity."
"This is a great pale ale, maybe not the most drinkable due to its bitterness...but it is a great drinker for hop heads. It has the taste like an IPA making it my favorite Pale to date."
"D: Excellent. A solid pale that is both complex and refined as well as being one you could have three or more of and not be starting to turn to the dark side. Awesome, and what a flagship beer, it really shows you just how awesome FFF is as a brewery."
"D - Probably the best Pale Ale I have ever had. Very well done. I have loved their ipa and pale ale, cant wait to crack open the dark lord."
"D: It's not every day that a beer gets it's own competetion named after it (""Alpha King Challenge"" at the Great American Beer Festival). That speaks volumes as to the respectability of this amazing brew. It has always and will continue to be.... my favorite beer."
"Drinkability - I'm quaffing this sucker as I type. I freaking love Three Floyd's and was pumped when I saw ptwnbwlr gave me a couple extras from them! Cheers!"
"Thanks Nate!"
"M/D: Medium bodied and extremely drinkable. It may be one of the easiest beers to drink that I have ever had. This is a great beer and I need to get my hands on some more of it."
"Very drinkable and very smooth."
"A well balanced beer - as much roasted maltiness as I've ever seen in an APA, but it works to good effect."
"Overall this well balanced beer is very drinkable."
"D - One of the best APAs I've had so far. I'll drink this any day."
"very drinkable. could be good with both a meal and just sitting and relaxing with family and friends. i will definitely enjoy drinking this 6 pack over the weekend."
"D: Pretty good drinkability, although this beer isn't as exciting or interesting as I would like in order to drink several of them...I feel like I would get bored."
"Drinkability is fantastic... low ABV... hop kick of an IPA, goes down pleasantly and smooth. It's probably a good thing I can't get these in NC... It would certainly be one of my ""go to's"" during football season!"
" Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass, a nice cloudy amber colour with a small white head, slight lacing. Has a nice sweet hoppy smell, some malty caramel in there...very, very nice. Taste is out of this world. Malty up front with a long lasting bitter finish. Nice weight, not thin and not syrupy...near perfect. I absolutely loved this beer. It really lives up to its hype, this also came to me from Indiana so it was super fresh. I would no doubt have this beer again....and again, and again."
"M/D - Medium to full body, easy to drink, but I can find similar examples of the style locally."
"D: At 6% ABV, the Alpha King is not asking for trouble, and I will hold council with him again soon."
" drink was preety good for me,went down real nice like , just tell youself it's an IPA and all is GREAT!"
"very drinkable at 6abv."
"D: A great pale ale that acts more like an IPA--probably is more of an IPA--but I'll go with the APA because the hops don't quite dominate like most American IPAs; good beer"
"As for a food pairing, try this with traditional English Fish & Chips w/Malt Vinegar. The citrus notes and carbonation will cut through the batter coating and help play up the sweetness of the cod, and the sweet maltly background in the beer will tame the bite of the vinegar while marrying the malts together. I am getting hungry just writing about it."
"D - An excellent beer but there are definitely better out there"
"Wow....nuff said"
"D - I am so lucky to have FFF at my disposal anytime I want. This is a great beer. For the price at my liquor store of $9.99 for a sixer I've reached for it many times. The hardest part is deciding Gumballhead or Alpha King!!!"
"Mild sweetness and then bam! The hops hit hard. Great hoppy pale ale."
"I think ""Alpha King"" give this a ""pha king"" awesome rating."
"Deep copper pour, with a one-finger, white head. The aroma has loads of sweet caramelized barley with peppery, spicy, piny hops to balance. The flavor follows through from the nose and adds a few notes of mango and toast also. Creamy medium body with a slightly aqueous finish."
"D - Pretty drinkable APA, and easily have more than one in a sitting. I would for sure get this brew again and I would recommend it"
"M/D - Very smooth. great carbonation, perfect balance. This is a bit on the hoppy side for an APA but it goes down easy and I would say this is a sessionable beer. Wish I had more than one to enjoy."
"DB- Unique flavor for a pale ale. Good hop presence lends nice citrus flavors. Really felt like a small Barleywine IPA hybrid."
" I was unimpressed when I had this from a bottle but in a growler it was GREAT!!"
"This beer pours a crystal clear golden copper with a gentle carbonation and a nice cream tan thin head. The aroma is pure green floral hops. A bit of pine resin with more citrus but very fresh hops. A hint of sweet malt is hidden in the background. This beer has a very fresh hops taste with some grapefruit and citrus flavors that is bold but not overpowering with bitterness. It is gentle enough that you can taste the creamy sweet malt that is mostly pale malt. It the softness of a slight bit of wheat. This has a medium full mouth feel with some creaminess. There is no alcohol warmth or astringency."
"Notes: Drinkability is good. Overall, it's a good beer. Emphasis on good. It isn't phenomenal, but definitely holds it's own. This beer is out of my distribution range, and for that reason, I probably won't try it again. There's just so much more out in the MidWest that I'd rather drink again/try than this. If I could pick it up at the packey whenever though, that might be a different story."
"I was excited to review this beer after all of the great comments and recommendations and it did not disappoint. Color was copper brown with nice light head that goes away rather quickly and forms a nice thin layer at the top. Smell was citrus with a little bit of pine. The taste has an initially sharp bitterness but turns into some citrus orange and light pine. As the beer warmed up the bitternes mellowed out and I could taste more sweet caramel flavors. Had the pleasure of enjoying this beer with freshly grilled Alaskan King Salmon and Asparagus. It added another element to my dinner. This beer borders on the realm of a single hopped IPA but is less over the top than its hoppier cousin and the bigger Imperial IPAs. However, it has less pronounced fruit flavors then the bigger IPAs. It is well balanced and a very versatile beer when it comes to pairing it with food. The fresh taste and crispness of this APA makes it a really winner among craft beers."
"I'm 2 for 2 on 3F's beers that have not disappointed!"
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep orange hue that has a nice head at first. Then it fades to a prisitne white foam around the edges that laces tightly to the glass. Smell is tight and sticky, very well constructed concoction of piny, sticky, citrusy sweet hops and a binder of nice malt. Taste is a perfect blend of bitter hops and sticky goodness that is balanced by the sweet malt character. Mouthfeel is full with a superb drinkability."
"Very good but I think it'd be better if the bitterness was a little lower. Paired with some local pizza smothered in hot sauce, yum."
"Best ""APA"" I've had"
"D: This is a beer that I could drink everyday, not only does it do justice to the classic APA style, but it pushes the limits of the brew and has you questioning whether it is more of an IPA than APA. Great all around brew."
"D: This doesn't stand out as anything special to me. It isn't bad but since I can't get it here but I can get SNPA I'll just stick with SNPA and not seek this out."
"D - Overall, a nice brew, well-made and tasty; I do not believe it is anywhere near as good as a number of other FFF brews. Give me a Gumballhead any day."
"Sure seems more like an IPA than an APA, but it is delicious either way."
"D: A really easy drinker. Not off flavors to distract me from killing the bottle. Nothing soapy or crazy bitter or to malty. like i said before nicely balanced but nothing to really rave about. Id make it my backup plan at a bar if it were local for me"
"I've had this in the bottle and it taste quite a bit better from the tap! I'd still pick up some bottles with limited supply in town but would prefer the tap."
"D- A quaffable brew that presents a bucketload of hops in balance with a bucketload of malt... yet somehow maintains a low 6% ABV!? Thanks again Brian for hooking this up- I need to get a couple cases of this stuff!!"
"This is a very drinkable APA. The flavor and smell aren't in your face, but that's OK for the style."
"D - Man oh man, this is an awesome APA. I would drink this all the time if it were readily available."
"D: Not my favorite Pale Ale, but still nothing really wrong with the beer. Fairly hoppy for a PA, but not as crisp as I would have liked."
"Drinkability is excellent. A premier product from one of the best breweries in the world."
"a beer i get all the time, but actually under appreciated the balanced qualities. great beer from the Floyds"
"D - More please! Amazingly drinkable, really wish I had regular access to this now :( This was my first 3 Floyds beer, and it certainly did not disappoint. Thanks again AgentZero!"
"Drinkability -- This is a pale ale for the ages. So big, but so balanced. This is never not in my refrigerator. Never."
"Been waiting to try this for a long time now. Had Daisy Cutter last night, so this beer has a lot to prove. I doubt it could be better than DC. Pours a very unique amber color with a nice medium sized head on it. Hops smells immediately when pouring. When smelling this, I get a LOT of sweet malts and caramel. Also get a lot of hops, but not nearly as much as DC. The citrus fruits are there, but not very ""in your face."" This smell is more well balanced than DC. Taste is very sugary sweet up front, then some citrus fruitiness (i also get hints of cherry), followed by the hop bitterness. This is just an amazing pale ale. The mouthfeel is chewier than most pale ales I've had, but keeps an AMAZING drinkability. I wish they sold this here in California. I'm so spoiled after these last two nights with DC last night and now AK tonight (got 1 of each as extras in a trade). I'm gonna go through ""Flawless Pale Ale"" withdrawals for the rest of the week."
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip pint glass. My first ever 3F beer, and boy oh boy, was I impressed. Pours a deep orange/ruby red, with a very thin layer of head. Disappeared pretty quick to leave almost no head and minimal lacing; the bottle wasn't dated, no idea how fresh this is. Smells of citrus hops right off the bat, pretty grapefruity I'd say. Taste is right there too, quite hoppy and bitter up front but that sweet warming malt comes in there to finish it off nice and a bit dry. Medium-high carbonation, but doesn't affect the drinkability on this one. Wish I had a six pack of this stuff, it kicks ass and is ridiculously drinkable."
"In sum, this is a beer that defies normal categorization. If you're expecting a refreshing, crisp APA, you will likely be dissappointed. It drinks more like an IPA or Imperial Red Ale. Best not to think about it too much...if you like hops, try the beer. It's as simple as that."
"Drinkability: Aftertaste leaves this beer a bit too strong for its abv for me. would be able to have a couple of these but there are way better options SNPA for one that i would grab instead. Not sure what the hype on this beer is for it to have an A rating, but its good, not great."
"M: Chewy, big, and dense: it's got body and coats the mouth, fills the mouth, and satisfies with every sip."
"A very, very good beer."
"Nice deep amber. Aroma of malt, citrus and fruit. Taste follows aroma. This has amazing taste. There is a bit of everything going on here...you have it all in nice proportions. This really gives the tastebuds a workout. Starts somewhat yeasty, thenmaltiness, then citrus/grapefruit then fruity finish. Feels a bit heavy and would make it difficult to put many of these away over a short period if time."
"Overall, this is a very good APA, though I definitely wouldn't call it that in a blind tasting. Either way, it's a top notch APA or IPA, whichever you want to call it."
"my first 3F beer, now to try the rest :D"
"Another beer that i could have sworn that i have tried before, but i guess i was wrong. pours a great looking cloudy light amber color with a decent amount of sediment floating around. looks really really good, smell is great too, has a full nose of hops to it and is a real treat to the nose. taste is very good, the only thing keeping this one from a 5 is that it is a bit watery, just a tiny but, but enought to be noticeable. other than that, this beer is nearly flawless and a textbook pale ale."
"d - A good pale ale and another strong beer from FFF. Would try again."
"Almost everything I encouter that comes with hype ends up dissapointing me or pissing me off to the point that I stay away. Three Floyds and this beer in particular seemed overhyped but I gotta say, ""damn good beer!'"
"D: pretty decent pale ale from FFF I'm glad I have more on the way. I'm itrested to see how it taste a little more fresh."
"This is a solid beer, no doubt, but I can't say it's one of my favorite pale ales or beers from 3 Floyds."
"I had this the day after Daisy Cutter and I can't decide which is my favourite APA, but they are number 1 & 2 in some order."
"D: Very smooth, and, although not technically a session beer...this is a great session beer."
"I'd definitely recommend Alpha King, in bottle or on tap"
"Alpha King brings a solid maltiness to the palate, but it tastes a bit hollow beneath the massive hop presence. A bitter blast of resinous hop oils coats the tongue and lingers well into the finish--a bit woody. The medium-thin body is nicely carbonated, with a sticky finish and lots of hops. Alpha King could use a bit more of a malt backing, but when all's said & done it's still an incredible beer. A must-try for any hop-head."
"D- For 6 percent I would say it is very drinkable and hides the booze well. Some beers when you reach this point struggle to hide the booze while maintaining the integrity of the beer."
"D-This is a really nice APA. Definitely a good session beer. I will be looking forward to the rest of this 6'r I picked up after DLD."
"D-Really nice, easy drinking pale ale. I remember having this years ago and not liking it all. I'm glad I finally got around to giving it another chance."
"Overall - I think it would make an awesome IPA. No doubt about it. Perhaps a bit over the top for an APA. Regardless, I dig this a lot. A great beer all around and I would love to get some fresh from the tap at the brewery again. Thanks again to BJ for sending this over :)"
"D: Goes down nicely, well balanced - at first seems like a hop bomb, but then the malts even out nicely. Great drinkability and another fine brew from Three Floyd's."
"Tasted from a twelve ounce bottle. Pours clear amber with a one finger beige head. The aromas are lightly roasted malts, hops, and prune juice. On the palate, the flavors are lemongrass, and then hoppy bitterness. There is a hint of the malt on the mid-palate, but the bitterness is the main flavor. On the palate, everything is fairly medium. The body, carbonation, and finish are all in the middle. Overall, this is a very high quality beer, perfect for sessions. I could drink this one all night long."
"D: Doesn't seem like a Pale Ale, but is a nice one none the less."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is really nice, I would have no problem having a few of these. Overall, I think this is a really nice brew. I do not think it is a APA though, much more of a well balanced midwest IPA. But who really cares, a very nice beer. Skal."
"Poured a darker colour than expected with a grapefruit tang on the nose. Funny how this beer is hoppier than a lot of Canadian IPAs but when you drink next to a bunch of west coast IPAs you see how the malt comes into play to balance the beer and place right in the APA zone. Lots of complexity in the finish and more than enough hops for the style this is a classic"
"Note to Self: Ranked #5 American Pale Ale (APA) when I tried it."
"Wow! 3F does a great job with all their beers and this is no exception. The beer looks good but then you take a sniff and get intoxicated by the piney citrusy hop aroma. The taste does not dissapoint at all either with the hops carrying through very nicely and a solid malt backbone to help sweeten it up. This is a damn good beer and I wish either 3F ditributed in MA or I lived closer."
"Pours a small one-finger head that dissaptes quickly. Color is a dark, hazy amber. Nose has some pine but prevalent bready malts and caramel. This beer is unique - nothing else I can compare it to. The hops and bitterness are forward. There is citrus in there and sweet malts that kick in part way through. By that or whatever means, the bitterness goes and is only faint in the finish. Refreshing. It has a light mouthfeel and good carbonation. At 6% and a warm day, could delve into this more, if I had the chance. Nice."
"Drinkability: For me, this is the ultimate drinkable pale ale. Maybe it is more IPA than pale ale, but I could care less. I almost always keep this in my fridge. The balanced hop flavor really does it for me."
"D - Three Floyds definitely hits a sweet spot here. It's not palate-wrecking, but has a great hop profile to keep me going back. I really wish I had regular access to it. Definitely the best APA I've had."
"Hoppy? Oh yes. Citrusy hop stands forefront but without overloading the senses. One for drinking on its own. Though if you want to eat something a robust cheese might play well with it."
"D - A little heavy for a session beer, but it sure drinks like one. I can and have killed a sixer in an evening, enjoying each gulp."
"Overall: Truly outstanding. I can drink this one ANYTIME. Based upon its near constant availability (in my area at least), amazing aroma, and delicious flavors this is my favorite beer on the planet."
"Overall, this just might be one of my top 3 favorite session beers. I could easily drink this beer all night long. Wish I had this beer available to me all the time in KC."
"D - Really easy and refreshing to drink, could do a few of these."
"I always have some of this on hand so I guess its my idea of drinkable. This one for me blurs the line between APA and IPA but its good either way. Trade with ME to get it though."
"D - A solid beer, definitely worth drinking again. I don't mind having two or three in a sitting when the mood strikes."
"I had this beer on tap several weeks ago at the Comet cafe in Milwaukee. I loved it ... I found it at an offsale in Hudson Wisconsin (chicones) and bought a six .... what a great beer a nice balance between hops and just enough malts. This might become my new go--to beer when I don't feel like an IPA or Imperiall IPA. Others have described the beer well and the nuances - I can highly recommend this beer if you like a great not too hoppy Pale Ale."
"Taste - Surprisingly sweet and not overly bitter at all. Smooth but this must be an older bottle since I'm not getting the hop bite that I would expect from a FFF APA."
"Nice prickly carbonation and the dryness in the finish make this one pretty damn drinkable. Too bad I can't get this locally, or I would have the King over on a regular basis."
"D - This is one of those beers I love to have every so often, but when I do I stop at one. It's no exception from the tap."
"D: Very nice hop-centric pale ale. Could easily enjoy this on a regular basis. This APA stands up with many light weight IPAs in the market today. Will hunt down again."
"Very drinkable! I would say this is more of an imperial amber (think Nugget Nectar) than an APA. In fact, I rank this right there with NN!!"
"D: Worth the hype. I'd call it an IPA instead of an APA were I tasting it blind, but I don't think my palate's sophisticated enough to take off for that."
"D - I could drink a lot of this. Another good beer from 3 Floyds."
"(D)- Exactly what a pale ale should be like! The balance & complexity is simple, but smooth. The bitterness, dryness, & citrus is borderline near what I would expect from an IPA, but I have no complaints about that! Just a simple yet delightful beer to enjoy one after another. The essence of the style."
"This beer is an impressive effort to blend high amounts of alpha hops into the APA style. I have no hesitations about buying more next time I am within the Three Floyds distribution area; in fact, if I lived in said area this would occupy space in my fridge on a regular basis. Recommended."
"Drinkability - MMMM Hops! Probably not a beer I would session but it sure is a great beer."
"D - definitely enjoyable, would probably go through a few of these on a summer day"
"D: this is a very drinkable brew, nice hop presence, crisp body and nice mouthfeel.. makes for a nice brew to enjoy on a warm day"
"M/D: Nice crisp and creamy. This has to be a hybrid between a pale and an IPA."
"Poured into a pint glass with a two finger tan head that quickly goes away. Copper collored with small groupings of bubbles. Smells of grassy citrus hops. Taste is mostly bitter hops with a slight malt flavor towards the end. Mothfeel is wattery with a light resin coating the mouth, nothing too thick. One thing i notice is the bitter hops taste stays in my mouth awhile after drinking it like when you eat garlic. Not a world beater but this is still one of the better apa's i have had. Recommended"
"D - This is a brew that any hop lover will rejoice in. Very tasty indeed, and I'm glad my friend gave me this sample to enjoy. Thanks Jason! I would certainly recommend this to anybody that can get their hands on it. Would love to try more from Three Floyds."
"A nice Pale Ale from FFF. I wish I could buy this one more often now."
"D- Moderate. I'll have to revisit this at some point, maybe my head's just not in the game. Good stuff, not great stuff though."
"pours a nice copper with highlights of straw and a light tan/white one finger head. smells of citrus/lemony hops and a light caramel malt. juicy and fantastic. i had an argument with a fellow BA over who would win in a fight between this beer and bell's two hearted. it had been awhile since i had them both, but i swore by two hearted up and down. we had a side by side. my opinion was shifted. with balance, flavor, and being FFF hopped up as much as an IPA, the king takes the cake. chewy viscosity and a lingering pleasantness. FFF has me floored again. surprise"
"D- Quite drinkable pale ale here. Some argue that this is more of an IPA. It's not my call to make but I would say it's somewhere between a pale and an IPA. Overall, I would get this again."
"(d) I would say the most I would have of these in one sitting would be 3...but for as much bite and punch this packs its suprizingly drinkable. (4/5)"
"D= 4.5 (non-session) This is an amazingly well balanced beer. Different flavors in each sip. The peaks are mellowed out with the valleys and makes for a great drinking experience. Good beer, Great brewery. Good job FFF"
"Well, this is the top of the echelon for American Pale Ales. Interestingly enough, this could be classified as a IPA and no one would say differant, its 60ibus, which while not a skull crushing IPA is safely in the territory. Its hoppyness is citrus bound and packs a big punch of flavor, retains a somewhat balanced malt side, that puts it in a perfect place overall between the styles, and has a great creamy mouthfeel and neverending drinkability."
"D- There is a good amount of flavor but it never really affects the palate. Like I have mentioned before, this reminds me more of an IPA than an APA. You can't tell the amount of alcohol in here and I have no problem knocking back a few of these in a sitting."
"I can drink these all night. In fact, I think I will."
"D- Good drinkability with the abv a non-factor."
"Mouthfeel is a s rich as the flavor, and despite a slightly high abv. this is a wonderful session beer."
"SkÅL!"
"Could drink these all day...easy on the ABV, huge on the flavor, great combination in my mind..."
"I certainly wouldn't call this a pale ale at all by definitely good stuff."
"D- Drinkable and enjoyable. Nothing overpowering but no more then two."
"Pours a dark orange body, almost a reddish colour. Head is a foamy white, and thick. Aromas are hops like crazy, pine, citrus, malt. taste is lots of hops, but not overpowering, subtle citrus and some mild malt that balances it out nicely. FInish is smooth, crisp, and the 6.5% is not noticable. I wish I could get more."
"Haven't had this in over two years, or whenever I was last able to buy this in PA. I remembered loving this so I'm excited to see how my memory holds up. Pours a clear copper color with a massive rocky off white head that has great retention and impressive strings of clumpy lacing. Aroma is very rich, full of bready malt and grapefruit hops like an IPA, impressive balance. Hop bitterness grabs you from the beginning, unusual for an APA but is supported by a strong biscuit malt backbone and finishes slightly sweeter with smooth citrus hops. Medium thick body with moderate carbonation and a smooth dry finish result in a very hoppy, drinkable APA. Not quite as impressive as I remember, but still the class of APAs."
"Drinkability is good, a great flavor treat."
"Good on drinkability. Vvfffh."
"Thanks for the sample 6 pack from Jdostal... poured into a pint glass this brew has a wonderful hazy orange color with a 2 finger pure white head that settles into a nice cap leaving sticky lacing down the glass. The aroma is strong and full of citrus and pine, some nuttiness and burnt caramel. The taste hits you with pine hops up front but then cools off with some malt balance in the middle and finishes with a great bitter bite. The strong carbonation and medium body give an astringent feel that intensifies the hop flavors. Very good brew."
"I thought this would be a knock out. I'm sad to say that I am somewhat disappointed, I bet I would groove with this more if I'd tried it on tap. I can see why people would really dig this, but for a PA it just doesn't do it for me."
"Very sessionable. Tasty pale ale."
"D- Excellent. It's always hard for me to judge APA's because I have a tendency to think of them as weak IPA's, but keeping the style in mind, it's hard to think of too many ways this could improve."
"Drinkability: Goes down smooth. Nice, solid APA. Would definitely recommend and drink again."
"A great ""affordable luxury"" pale ale. The name alone tells you what to expect. What the name doesn't say, the label surely does. A king made of hops. This quite heavily-hopped pale could easily be one dimensional without that heavy dose of malt for balance. This beer won't change your life, but it's a great introduction to the brews and philosophy of Three Floyds. Hop first, compromise never."
"Pour is copper with a nice thick head that persists as a thicker than usual ring and also leaves a nice trail. Smell is muted hops and malty sweetness. A touch muted. Taste is similar to the nose except that it is much less muted. Really enjoy it. A pleasant light yet still somewhat creamy body. A great session beer."
"Pours a deep, semi-hazy copper color with a light and lacy off-white head. The nose is well balanced between malty sweetness and citrus hoppiness. The flavor is also well balanced between the sweet and bitter with big citrus bitterness composing the majority of the flavor. It is a medium bodied beer with moderately high levels of carbonation. The finish is bitter and citrus but the sweetness flavor returns as the beer fades away."
"D - on second thought, this is easily one of the better APA's out there. great bold (grass, pine) hop flavors yet quite balanced."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer! Great taste with a nice and creamy mouthfeel, I can't wait to drink this on a warm summer day!"
"D: Had this two days in a row and picked up on a lot more flavors the second time, so there's definitely something to be said about the complexity in this beer. More than most APAs."
"Overall this is a nice beer. Not the typical Pale Ale by any means, as the beer drinks pretty big. Surprising that it's only 6% with how much malt there is here. Overall this beer reminds me a lot of Drake's Gold Medal IPA, but maltier. Good stuff."
"D: If your not careful this one could get you into trouble quickly."
"D: again IPAs aren't really my thing, but considering the style this is about what I'd expect."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, I really enjoy this beer. This is pretty close to the perfect session beer for me. It's hoppy but not too hoppy and has a nice malt backbone. This would be a regular drinking beer for me if only I could buy it locally."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and I recommend this to someone who enjoys a solid Pale ale with a malt profile that really makes this enjoyable."
"Overall this is one of the best American Pale Ales that I have had and it certainly lives up to its reputation. Thanks again Chuck for throwing this one in the box! Recommended."
"Pour a slightly hazy orange copper,solid well established head,which dissipates to leave a nice ring of lacing,smell is exceptional,citrus floral pine,smell reminds me of west coast hops,taste is outstanding well balanced sweetness and acid,hit all the taste buds at one time,this is a beer that I could drink every day and not ever grow tired of,one of my top ten all time."
" ~ This is a great beer! My thanks to jdostal for the gift. I only hope that I too, someday, can repay the favor."
"D: Drinkability? Hell yeah! I wish I didn't have to cross the border to get ahold of this fine specimen..."
"D: 2 per session max, always on the shelf in the garage."
"D: Very complex for its body and one of the most drinkable pale ales I've ever had. Good balance in the malt and hop bills with neither being overpowering. A definite winner from FFF and a great brew to enjoy on a hot summer day (though I'm reviewing this in the winter)."
"D - Very sessionable"
"Pours an amber color with an off white head with good retention and a nice lace. Smells of floral and citrus hops with some malt in the background. The taste is much like the smell, the hops come through and are balanced by some sweet caramel malt. Light to medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation. A nice hoppy beer which is easy to drink, one that I will have to pick up again when I am in Hudson."
"Very drinkable with a thicker mouth feel. A like it."
"Alpha King does have a very good mouthfeel, nice and creamy, and finishes well, but overall I thought the sweetness of the beer was a bit much. It is possible to bring out a lot of hop aroma/flavor without making a bitter beer, unfortunately FFF's decided to leave just a bit much residual sweetness which I think ruins the hoppy character. The beer isn't bad for what it is, but it is not a great APA, IMO."
"Three Floyds does it again."
"Plenty of hop character, enough malt. Its nowhere near as pungent as it seemed over a decade ago, but it still holds a special place, and is a legitimate high end pale ale still to this day."
"D: Pale ales are known for their high level of drinkability, and this one is no exception. A very nice beer by Three Floyds."
"oh, how i've long waited to taste your juices! like the flowing locks of an auburned redhead, she drops into the glass, forming into a lovely finger of head. popping the cap off releases all that is holy, from 2 feet away, I know what is to become of my mouth. the grapefruit, the flowers, the pine, mostly the grapefruit. indeed there is a sweetness as well to this lass, and as she comfortably nuzzles my tongue, the flavors design to leave me in love with a pale ale? silly floyds. anyways, $4 a 12 oz? why not? in fact, i did it again."
"D-so tasty for a pale ale and great mouthfeel, only 6% (not quite a session but damn near). i could pound cases during summer months!"
"Overall: What most impressed me about this beer is that it's one of the few top 100-borderline top100 beers that's simply enjoyable. This beer has no amazing qualities you can't find in other beers, it's just a well-balanced delightful beer with no weak points. One of the best I've had in a while...glad to be on the Wisc. border."
"Nice and smooth overall. Medium body, good hop bitterness in the back, some malt sweetness up front. Beer overall is a good pale ale. Drinkability is high, no real aftertaste, citrus hop flavors, bitterness builds as you drink, beer flavors become more pronounced as beer warms a little."
"Medium body and nicely carbonated. A nice fruity hop finish. Nice drinkability."
"Certainly there has to be levels of progression between--or a scale to measure the degrees between--an APA and an AIPA, and this one might just about tip the scales and spill all over the next category up. Tasted blind I would have pegged this as an IPA without a doubt. Not a bad thing. This is a great beer. I'd pick it up all the time if it was available to me. It's just more than a little brash for the style it claims to be is all."
"As a person that usually leans toward malt over hops, this pale ale was a nice change of pace for me. Strong hop presence without being overpowering, citrus touches both in the nose and in the mouth. I strong suggest this beer as a beer for people who claim not to like hoppy beers."
"A good APA/IPA. But a lot of better choices out there are easily available, imo. Will try fresh on tap if available, see if that's the issue for me."
"drinkability is solid. very well proportioned and easy drinking on cask. cheers!"
"Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a decent, but not overlarge, head. Aroma of grapefruit and pine, not as strong as some but not weak either. Definitely stronger hops than most APA's, and stronger than a few IPA's I've tasted. Kind of like getting the flavor of an IPA with a bit lower alcohol, which makes for a pretty drinkable combination. Overall a very pleasing beer."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours a clear copper with a 2 finger head and alot of lacing. The aroma is a pine explosion. The flavor showcases the cascade hops, big and bold pine and citrus. The finish linges with a piney bitterness. Alpha King is medium bodied, well carbonated and taste like a much bigger beer. This beer taste bigger than many of the IPA's I have had and kind of blurs the lines between the two. To date this is the best APA I have had."
"Pours a reddish amber body with an off white head that falls to a cap and leaves great lacing behind in the glass. Aroma is citrus hops with caramel malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Flavors are a hint of sweet malt that quickly gives way to a big hop flavor that last through the finish but not for too long, and then it dries out your tongue which makes you beg for another sip. Excellent drinkability!"
"Really happy to see Western Sconnie starting to get more FFF offerings. Have heard nothing but good things about this beer. Pours a wonderful amber color with a two finger, light tan head that fell into a lasting cap leaving nice lacing. Aroma is wonderfully balanced between the sweet caramel, and bready malts and the piney citrusy hops. If this is any indication of the flavor I'm in for a real treat. Oh yeah, great bitterness on this one, lots of grapefruit and pine, sweet at first, but bone dry on the finish. This is about as perfectly balanced as you can an APA, but I feel like this one is borderline IPA. Medium bodied, ample carbonation. Just an all around great APA (if you can call it that). This would slightly edge out SNPA for the standard on which all others APAs are judged."
"D: Good, better if it was more carbonated."
" I could chuck these back my gullet for a fortnight."
"D - FFF came back into our market about a year ago but I haven't seen AKPA until last week. This beer was worth the wait - it is extremely drinkable (it drinks like a mild mannered IPA) and one I will always have on hand. It is nice to try a well regarded beer and not be disappointed."
"D - I was really excited to finally get to try this beer...it lived up to it's hype as one of the better APA's...a nicely balanced beer...I just wish I could get my hands on this more often"
"I have been wanting to try this beer for several years. Finally. Pours a dark, clear amber with a small head that settled to a thin cap. Delicate lacing is left on the glass clear to the bottom. Big, pungent, massive, are all adjectives that could be used to describe the citrus hop aroma coming from this beer. It is not all hops however, as there is some sweetness from the malt as well. The flavor features the hops well. Grapefruit and orange come to mind. Bitterness is high. I am not a big fan of the malt bill. Overlly sweet in my opinion. I have knocked the scores of other beers of having similar sweetness, so I will knock this one down as well. A very good body and carbonation. It feels substantial without weighing down the palate. Nice texture. This almost lived up to my expectations. Just a little to sweet for my tastes. The bitterness and ABV limits drinkability as well."
"Overall a very nice pale ale. Pretty well balanced, but hop forward, very sessionable, pretty much what you want in a pale. Would love to have regular access to this one, a nice beer."
"I'm usually not crazy about APAs but this one is the exception to my rule. Awesome hop/malt balance with fresh hop flavors and a smooth body to accompany it!"
"Drinkability: An easy to drink beer that I wouldn't mind keeping around all the time. It's a fairly hoppy APA from my experience, which is always fun. It's similar to the Ale Asylum APA in hop character."
"A very good pale ale."
"Overall impression: Great beer - could definitely drink quite a few of these. Nice hop flavors, close to balanced but tilted enough towards hoppy to satisfy any hop head."
"This is drinkable as hell. Would make a great session beer. Lots of flavor going on and not overly hoppy to cause a lower drinkablility. Well balanced and tasty. If I had access, I would buy this often."
"A very stern and assertive pale ale, but very balanced and approachable. This was the first craft beer I ever drank, over a year ago, and I wasn't a very big fan of it then. Now that my taste has developed a bit, my reaction is quite the opposite, and I know I will make this one of my regulars."
"D: Quite drinkable. The definition of a Pale Ale."
"I'm very happy FFF brews are starting to turn up in some of the Wisconsin liquor stores. Looking forward to trying more from this brewery."
"AK has a fullness to it that's unusual in most IPAs these days (though FFF calls this an APA). I really enjoy the fuller body and richer character. Great beer."
"Taste, at first I taste the yummy citrus hops. Then it gets really bitter with the taste of a dark bitter malt backbone. A bit of an earthy planty flavor in there too. Maybe with a sweeter malt flavor I would, but I'm not especially enjoying this. The lingering bitterness is just not doing it for me. A Dale's Pale ale is a bit more accessible to my taste. As I go though, it's going down easier, but still not ideal."
"I thought I knew what hops were but this drink has help to redefine my understanding. I could smell them when the glass was just sitting on the table. I admired the golden color and think foam, then I dove in. The hop flavor was very prominent at the tip of my tongue, then did a disappearing act, then came back to haunt the back of my tongue. It was wonderful. It wasn't overbearing and I was a bit sad when I finished my glass. I wish I could get this stuff back in Iowa."
"HV"
"It sure is nice to have the FFF brewpub with 30 minutes of my house!"
"Bottle. Pours a very dark, cloudy, ruby amber. Very hoppy for a pale ale, but its not normal as the bottle says! Very tasty and easy to drink. Excellent beverage. Really enjoyed the 6 pack I was able to get from a friend visiting. No Pale Ales will ever be the same."
"D- I could drink this everyday for the rest of my life!"
"Great orange color on this beer. Lots of aroma coming from the glass - citrus for sure. The flavor was ehat I expected from the appearance and smell - nice citrus flavors and tartness along with citrus hops and just a hint of sweetness. Great body and lots of flavors."
"D - A wonderfully crafted Pale Ale... Many in the style seem to be timid and lacking any discernible character, however that is not the case with Alpha King... This is a Pale Ale this is oozing with character and charm without ever being overpowering or off putting... Excellent in all facets and well balanced..."
"Very drinkable, big citrus hopped pale ale that could easily be considered an IPA."
"Enjoy!"
"Pours a dark color for its style, color is somewhat of a caramel amber. The scent is initially some clear hops followed up by a pretty decent malt backbone. The taste increases on both of these, with quite a bit of hops coming through for the style. The mouthfeel is that of a medium body and moderate carbonation--fairly full-bodied for the style. Drinkability is supreme--my go to all-night beer back when I lived in Chicago."
"Filled the trusty pint glass with this gem smuggled back to Vegas from Chicago. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color. Slightly off-white head with moderate retention and some lacing. Smell is a nice blend of sweet caramel malt some citrusy hops and I sweat a touch of alcohol that kinda surpirsed me. Not much, just a little. Taste was great. Quite possible the best I've had of this style yet. Amazingly smooth and well balanced blend of a dry caramel malt with some hop bitterness. A west coast, citrus kick to it as well. Mouthfeel was slightly heavier than your average APA but very smooth going down. Overall a great beer and amazing representation of this style. Could easily put away a few of these if I had more."
"Drinkability: well-balanced beer. IPA like. very bold on the hops and very pleasant to drink."
"This is very smooth and well balanced except for a slight astringency on the finish. All in all a very good pale ale."
"Appearance is good, nice copper hue, slight head and lacing. Smell and taste are identical, some grapefruit and heavy hops right up front. This milds out as it sits on your palate by some sweet malt that provides some balance. Mouthfeel is good as well, medium in body, good carbonation and oily feel. Drinkability is good."
"D: This is a great beer. Perfect for summer."
"Drinks very smooth, highly refreshing as a wake up to the festival beer."
"This poured a hazy copper with moderate tan head. It smelled like a sweet array of topical hops including pineapple and apricot, with some orange and mango, balanced with prominent sweet honey malt. It tasted like apricot and orange, with some pineapple and mango and lots of sweet honey, and a bit of white peppercorn. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a clean, tropical bitter aftertaste. Overall this is fantastic. It meets the hype. The super clean and tropical taste meets my ideal for a pale ale or IPA. It had nice body also, and was very easy to drink. Clearly one of the top beers in its class; makes me wonder why I didn't like Dreadnaught nearly as much. I wish I could have an Alpha King every day."
"If the opportunity presents itself, get some Alpha King."
"D - Hmm after average ratings this brew has above average drink. Why? Well it doesn't fit the categories that are used but the beer is good!!!"
"Alpha King pours a reddish amber with minimal head. I wish I had multiple bottles to see if that was the case with just this pour, but nope. The foam resides quickly after giving a good show for a few seconds and then proceeds to lace the glass as I continue to drink. The smell has a certain fruit characteristic to it and makes Alpha King smell kind of bitter. It's very reminiscent of an IPA actually in its smell, which made me check the bottle (the only bottle I have) to see if it in fact was an IPA in which in fact it was not, it's a pale ale; welcome to obvious statements by Josh. Alpha King actually has a very present hops flavor which I quite enjoy. The moderately bitter fruit taste, grapefruit, blends well with the malts that it makes me wish Three Floyd's distributed to Missouri. I really enjoy this beer, it reminds me of going to see Royal's Baseball games with my Dad when I was little kid. Except neither of us were drinking and this beer wouldn't be in the memory and the Royal's probably lost, not characteristic of this beer. Alpha King is something I could see myself relaxing with on a summer day watching a Baseball game or [fill in your favorite sporting event here]."
"Bottle thanks to FlssmrBrewAlum. I've been waiting to try this one for quite some time now. Pours a semi-cloudy orange-brown with a small white head. Aroma of caramel malt, brown sugar, citrus hops, and grapefruit. Flavor is initially rather tangy with hop oils and citrus and then mellows with a maltier finish. This is pretty tasty. I'd love to have this as a session beer, if only it was distributed in NY. Good stuff."
"D - if you like hoppy pale ales, this one truly is the king. Very sessionable and enjoyable throughout. I will have to stock up on this stuff next time I am in Illinois..."
"Wish this was distributed to MA, as this would be a go-to. A solid ""A" beer all the way."
"D - Really goes down smoothly and easily. Very delicious. Pretty hoppy, but not as bitter as many IPA's. If I didn't have to get this in Chicago, I could easily see myself drinking this very regularly."
"Cheers."
"Thanks again Dan!"
"along with southern star pinebelt pale,this is probably my favorite APA."
"Poured Three Floyd's Alpha King Pale Ale into glass and first noticed its nice citrus smell. Hints of grapefruit which is different and nice. Amber color with a small head. I do believe I noticed the grapefruit in the taste as well. Overall a pretty good beer, nothing that I would go out of my way to get but would like to try again..."
"D - Very flavorful yet well balanced. This was my first taste of anything from Three Floyds and it didn't disappoint."
"Alpha King is superb. It has supplanted Schlafly Dry-Hopped APA as my favorite beer in the style. It has tremendous hop flavor -- enough that I would take an Alpha King over a number of fine IPAs. This beer makes me weep bitter tears over the fact that Three Floyds does not ship to Missouri as of yet."
"Notes: Definitely a beer for hop lovers, one of the hoppiest, although most balanced ales I have had. Reminds me of sweetwater 420, but with much better balance with the malts. A go to for a hop fix."
"This one can quench your hop thirst, with a unique and well balanced mix of hops."
"D: well I only bought 2 but I wish I had bought more."
"I found this on tap at a hidden gem of a beer bar 30 minutes out of town. Lucky me. It pours a rich amber orange color with two inches of creamy off white head. The aroma is spectacular. Hops are at the forefront but sweet malt and citrus fruit are major players as well. Then I take a sip. I took a double take after I swallowed. This tastes much more like an IPA then just a pale ale. The flavor is very hoppy but, not a hop bomb at all. The malt is well balanced with the hops making for a super drinkable beer. There is a orange peel sour/sweetness that comes out as well. The mouhfeel is awfully pleasant. Medium body with a nice creamy texture. This is a top beer on my list. I spent the entire night enjoying one after another. I will be visiting my this bar again. A 30 minute drive is nothing to enjoy a drink with ""the king"""
"D: Very easy to drink and quite refreshing."
"D: This is a really good beer. I wish that I didn't have to trade for it. If it was distributed in my area, it would absolutely be a beer that I would buy again and again."
"I'm imagining this flowing directly from the tap at the brewhouse in Munster into my 20 oz. imperial glass on a hot day. One day...one day."
"All in all, this is a better beer than I may have indicated in this review. I seem to have fixated on one (perceived) flaw that shaped my overall interpretation of the beer, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't mind having one from time to time."
"Pours dark amber with a respectable head. A good citrus aroma, strong, but not overbearing. The taste was a sweet grapefruit and I had no bitter aftertaste, excellent. Feel is smooth with a nice body for an APA. I could drink a half dozen of them. Everything good about an IPA, but kept none of the bad. My first taste of a 3Floyd's effort, I'm impressed."
"Drinkability is high. The flavors are just strong enough to keep you coming back for more and the ABV allows you to pound these beers but not be abliterated after a six pack of them in one night."
"The drinkability of theses pale is outstanding. I wish I had more of these and I could easily see myself drinking a 6er of these in a night, if I had regular access to this beer. I had trouble not drinking this too fast while trying to take tasting notes. Get some!"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and fairly smooth with good carbonation."
"Had this as part of a tasting session with a buddy a while back. Poured an amber color with white foamy head that left decent lacing. Smelled of citrus hops, malt and caramel. Tasted of earthy hops, malt and caramel. Smooth, but slightly overcarbed. Could drink more."
"Overall, this pale ale is great. I think it is really hard for a brewer to brew a pale ale that tastes very good, but FFF did a great job. This one went fast and even the family enjoyed a few samples."
"This is an IPA at its core but incedibly drinkable. Its sweet but hoppy and bitter."
"Served in a pint glass. Red/Orange in color with a creamy tan head. Super fine carbonation bubbles. Smell is a blast of Pacific Northwest hops. Taste is well balanced, caramel malt, piney, citrus hops, and a nice bitter finish. Super creamy mouthfeel, great drinkability. An excellent APA, tastes more like an IPA though, but it doesn't matter what the classification, it's great."
"A very well crafted beer. Medium to slightly heavy bodied with the rich malty backbone the light carbonation is a nice touch. Somewhat reminds me of a light barleywine."
"I really don't know if I could have more that 1-2 of these in anyone setting. The aforementioned metallic aspect builds to a point where it becomes cumbersome and annoying. I just wish it step out of the way and leave this otherwise well crafted beer alone."
"Drinkability: So high...this is one of those beers that's good whenever, wherever and with anything. I realize Three Floyd's take on most of their beers is hoppier than traditionally done, but they do hops very well - possibly best."
"Cask at Clark Street Ale House in Chicago. Surprisingly dark amber pour with a cream colored head. Piney hops dominate the aroma of coarse, but some malt also. Taste has some nice caramel covered apple, citrus and the hops. Smooth mouthfeel, just enough carbonation, hand pull helps this of coarse. Finish is not overly bitter. Not a frequenter of pales, but this is the best American pale I've had. Three Floyds hop heavy style obviously works well with this."
"D: Again one of those beers that pisses me off I cannot simply go to a store to get. Probably the single best pale ale I have ever had."
"Both the bottled and tap versions are excellent with both showing slightly different characteristics."
"The mouth is creamy and smooth, but with just the right amount of carbonation to tickle the mouth. Well done. Flavor is slightly bitter at first sip, but this gives way to a big malty caramel sweetness that finishes with a grapefruit punch. This is much sweeter than I though it would be, but I like it. I like it alot! Dang fine brew. I want more of this..."
"D: Very good. I could enjoy a nice evening with a few of these. Good brew here!"
"Just Brilliant."
"(tasting notes from 23 Jun 2009)"
"D- This is quite a beer, but I wish it was fresher."
"I don't know if I would consider this an APA. I think it is more bordering on an IPA; however, I know I really like it, no matter what style they call it."
"Drinkability: Very high. The incredible balance and dryness combine to make a very drinkable beer. Start a big meal with this brew. A great example of the style."
"the taste always seems to let me down, but it's still a great beer. sometimes i need a reminder of why it's great living in Indiana!"
"Simply an outstanding pale ale."
"D: A very drinkable APA that goes well on a nice warm day...or any day for that matter!"
"Taste: Very nice citrus taste with strong hoppiness but not an overpowering amount which I really enjoy for that reason"
"Very aromatic take on the APA. Lots of citrus hop aroma, but still had some caramel malt character. A light amber appearance with good head retention. Good, clean, hop flavor with a good balance with the malt. Tasted as part of a sampler, so it was less hoppy than the IPA, but still had a good amount of hop bitterness. The bitterness didn't linger and finished clean. Had a good mouthfeel, carbonation was just right. Even with the hops (68 IBUs) it was not overly astringent and was very refreshing. A very well balanced beer and definitely their ""flagship"" beer."
"Its not to style, but its a damn fine brew."
"D: This is a tasty pale ale. I wanted another pint of this brew right away!"
"D: Very drinkable for such powerful flavors."
"The beer is nicely carbonated, it's awesomely hoppy and it has a nice dry finish. It tastes a lot stronger than the 6% abv or the Pale Ale title would have suggested, this beer was great."
"D - Yeah it's an easy drinking pale ale. A lot going on for a 6% brew"
"My first Three Floyds beer is a good one. But is this going to be enough to take the title of being the best in the T.U.I.? Only two more beers left, we'll resume tomorrow night."
"rankings on tasting 1-8 GFlash-2Hrtd-BigEye=Hop3-CorneDuDiable-60min=AlphaKing-Hdevil"
"Bottle. One of the hoppiest pale ales i've ever had. Pours a darker amber/copper color with small white head. Aromas are more malt focused, with only minor amounts of hops. Great balance on the palate between hop and maltiness. The flavors are rich, but not overpowering. With the hop profile I wouldn't have guessed a pale ale, but thats FFF's style. I wish I lived closer to this stuff."
"A very good beer."
"D: I could drink a couple of these and be content. Not sure if this is one I'd pick up a sixer of but I'd grab a pint when I'm out to dinner or out with friends anytime."
"Really glad to have gotten this, if it was readily available in my area it would be a staple in my fridge. I'll be sure to get some again."
"A very impressive pale ale (or IPA or DIPA, whatever you want to classify it). Elite in class and execution."
"This is a very good APA. Probably one of the best i've ever tried."
"EDIT 2011- Still not terribly impressed. There is an unexpected nuttiness to this beer. Also, the appearance is not the best. Head dissipates so quickly. Decidedly thin. I know this one is fresh, so this beer is definitively not my cup of tea."
"My first impression of FFFs, and a good one. Maybe a little misclassified, but I'm never disappointed by a good hoppy beer."
"Had this for the first time on tap at DLD and just had to pick some up because I like it so much. Pours a very nice copper, almost reddish orange color that looks really nice. Has about a one finger white head that doesn't stay around to long and leaves little lacing down the glass. The aroma is piney hops, grapefruit? and caramel. Pretty good smell to it. Taste is really great. Piney, bitter about halfway through but not nearly as bitter as some other beers which is good in this particular beer. Also their is fruit in there as well, grapefruit? Overall the taste is great and has a nice mouthfeel to it. Very drinkable as well, not a low ABV but not high either. I could drink this all night for sure."
"This is a very interesting beer. Straddles the line between a pale ale and ipa, and does it quite nicely. A fine brew indeed. Thanks Dan!"
"Draught at The Red in Santa Cruz. Black with a dense tan head. The aroma is super chocolate powered; leaning a little toward the dark side, but still milky and creamy. The flavor takes that and adds in a roasted bitterness that doesn't completely blend, but works out alright. The body is a little thin, but pretty smooth. This is a really nice smelling beer, with a pretty good flavor to back it up, but the chocolate and roasted malt don't seem to gel as well as they could"
"overall a nice pale ale but i think its lacking in a few departments"
"Overall impression: It's OK, but disappointing as I was expecting a hophead's delight and instead got a very sweet (and flattish) brew. Older bottle, maybe? If I get a chance to try it again and have a different experience, I'll adjust my review/ratings accordingly."
"M & D: Medium bodied with light carbonation. Wonderful mouthfeel on this one making it extremely drinkable. Will satisfy your hop fix but backs it up with the smooth malt to turn this one into a great session beer. Wish this was readily accessible."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter end of medium with light carbonation. For a beer this pleasantly bitter it is so round, so smooth. Three Floyds always kills me in the mouthfeel/carbonation department-something that I think gets overlooked in favor of their hop-centric approach to many styles. I could drink this a lot. Unfortunately I can find good APAs for less money-I'm looking at you SNPA and Lake Louie Arena Premium. Regardless, this is a well put together brew that pushes the limits of hop hearty American Pale Ales."
"I could guzzle down quite a few of these, there delicious."
"D: A quite astonishing APA. Considering the amount of hop aromas and flavors in this one, it could easily go head to head with an IPA. And despite all of the hops, it still feels well balanced."
"D: The drinkability of this beer is through the roof! This beer is excellent, has great flavor, is refreshing and has a decently low abv (6%). I could drink this beer anytime and anywhere."
"Overall, for a pale ale I was expecting a more hop profile, as this was more a light barleywine."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. Appears a hazed deep copper color with about two fingers of sticky creamy light ecru foam. The head leaves a moderate lacing on the inside of my glass as I sip my way to the bottom. Smells and tastes of fresh fruity citrus such as lemon, grapefruit and orange peel, sweet caramel glazed biscuits, and a welcome bitterness. A few notches above medium in both body and carbonation. Excellent drinkability, this is probably epic on cask."
"D - Yes. Definitely drinkable and enjoyable. Sessionable for sure. But enjoyable one at a time. A great place to start."
"Overall, this is a very good beer and is well balanced. The flavors complement each other nicely and are definitely highlighted by the carbonation and smoothness."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange-gold, with a light off-white head. Head doesn't last for long - it was a wuss pour, so chalk that up to me. The cap sticks around a while though. Great lacing. The nose is citrusy and has a fresh hoppy aroma, but it's not a hop bomb. In addition to the hop flavor, there's good malt backing, and as a result this is pretty balanced. It's smooth and drinkable."
"Totally surprised by this one. I had heard it was good, but I didn't quite understand how good it is. Thought it would be an underwhelming run-of-the-mill APA. Shame on me for doubting FFF."
"I had this on tap and that tasted better. I ended up buying a six pack of this and taking it home with me."
"Really I was kind of surprised by this beer. It was alot darker and alot more like an IPA than I expected - in fact, my friend sampled the beer and remarked by calling it a half-IPA, and I think that nails this beer on the head. Not that it was bad, I was just expecting this beer to have more of a malt profile to better balance the play on hops. Not a bad beer by any means and one I would have again."
"One of the best."
"I'm trying to keep this review simple. This beer just kick's ass. But don't take my word for it. Go out and get some and see for youre'self. All in all, one of the best brew's ever made. Do not miss this one..."
"Three Floyds is fast becoming my favorite brewery (Gumballhead, Dreadnaught, Miloko Plus, etc.) and I'm so happy to have regular access to all their beers (my mother lives minutes from Three Floyds and I visit her often to help with household chores). This Three Floyds offering is no different. This is what beer should taste like. If you can trade for this beer, I say go for it."
"An absolutely fabulous APA. Possibly the best I have yet to try."
"D- I find this beer to be an fantastic everyday drinker. FFF has never steered me in a terrible direction. I could easily and have many times before drink a sixer of this brew."
"D - Easy to kick back."
"Pours a dark amber with nice lacing on the head. Very nice hop on this one and really well balanced. Def on the hoppy side for a pale but very tasty and easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel with some maltiness to balance it out."
"Hands down my favorite beer out of the Three Floyds haul I just received (thanks Josh, aka alleykatking). Rich amber in color, great head and lacing on the glass. This beer is just perfectly balanced. Some might push this beer into the IPA category, but I believe it's right where it belongs as a pale ale. It's darker than most IPAs, and while yes it is very hoppy, it's not super bitter or dry. It really has an excellent ""hop efficiency", yes I just made that up. Basically I mean that the hops used in this beer seem like they go a long way and the utmost flavor is achieved from the ingredient, therefore it's not overloaded with extra hops or clouded by other ingredients trying to balance out the hops. Fruity, ripe, delicious fresh hop taste. A nice malt backdrop. Wish I had more..."
"This is a beer that I could drink till the cows come home. Love it."
"This is definitely no West Coast APA and I really dig it. I look forward to the day that FFF could meet their current demand enough to possibly bring this to California. Recommended."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite brews that's available year round. Every time the ""favorite beer"" discussion comes up, Alpha King certainly gets a mention from me."
"Drinkability, I find to be exceptional as is evidenced in my score of 5. This beer is very sessionable and also a good start for someone just getting into real craft beers."
"All in all I thought this was a pretty good beer. I think I was expecting more hops than were delivered. I would love to try this fresh on tap to use as a comparison. If this were available in CA I would definitely pick it up due to its relatively low abv and the fact it goes down easily and does not fill you up fast."
"Drinkability: yes please."
"Overall: This is closer to an ipa than a pale ale, but it really defies classification. Another Three Floyds winner."
"Overall a great brew and i am glad he sent me 2 of them. I will probably trade for more of this another time..."
"D- Uh, yeah. Definitely drinkable."
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink..."
"The only problem here is that the malt isn't there enough for this style. While objectively I like this beer tons, it is not an APA. So I gotta go with all 4.5s here. It's three floyds, sure, but its no dark lord or behemoth, something that dominates the playing field in its respective field."
"Pours a deep orange/amber color with 1 finger head that went away quickly. Smells of very nice citrus hops, very pleasant. Couple floaties in the bottle which is no big deal. Taste is very good and goes down easily. Massive lacing on the glass. Seems like more of an IPA as opposed to a pale ale which is fine with me. I think I could get in trouble with this brew if it was more widely available around here. I really want to try a very fresh one b/c I know this one is atleast 3 or 4 months old. Another winner from FFF and a very good pale ale. I will have to keep trading for this and dreadnaught until they distribute in PA. Cheers."
"Taste- This is where you really get into the good beer. It tasted amazing and really brought you to want more and more. citrus and malty hints at the same tame quite a unique beer and i can understand the cult following."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer, but I don't think anyone should crack into this sucker expecting an APA because this is really an IPA. At least as far as my taste buds and nose are concerned it is anyway."
"D-A really good APA. Really it seems like an IPA in the hoppy flavors, but not the bitterness. It reminds me a lot of Two Hearted Ale in its hop bouquet. Really drinkable, but the price may turn me off a bit (6 bucks a pint). Hopheads must try."
"Got this as an extra on a trade I think. This is the first beer I have had from Three Floyds and it did not disappoint. Pours a dark redish orange color with a moderate head that faded to a faint layer of bubbles that rested on the top of the beer. Smelled of sweet citrus/floral hops with some bready malt smells in there too. Taste was awesome, sweet, citrusy, grassy hops, sharp bitter hop finish. Medium bodied. Very drinkable. Awesome beer."
"Overall: VERY easy to drink, very refreshing, good flavors! really well rounded with good malt and hops! Not too overly sweet or bitter."
"I would drink this for the rest of the day if 1)it wasn't so expensive 2)I still lived in Indiana 3)I didn't like the variety I now enjoy. This is a fine beer and one I wouldn't mind having again in the near future."
"Pours rust orange and opaque. Creamy head, dissipated quickly to small lumps. Smells nice. Sweet malts, aroma is heavy with earthy, nuts and hops. Taste is a good balance of hops and malts. Sugar is prominent, hops linger through finish and well after. Mellow feel, not sharp or fizzy. Sticky and smooth...I love this brew. Proud to call this my favorite local brew. This bottle was awesome. Best from the tap. With tournament time coming, pitcher of Alpha at Chumley's in Broad Ripple are a sure bet."
"Got this in the Educators BIF and I think that this is a solid pale ale. Most others I have tried have been a little hop weak in my opinion but this beer does not fall into that category. I think that it almost boderlines on an IPA, with its hop presence but it obviously falls short. A very solid pale ale that I wouldn't mind having around here."
"Recommended."
"alpha king pours a nice dark orange color with nice carbonation/head... the smell is great.. sweet malts,hops ,citrus,pine, and other floral/fruity smells..superb it smells and taste more like an IPA to me it starts with a malt sweetness followed by a citrus hop flavor all in perfect balance..it fills the mouth with all of the before mentioned and is so very drinkable..this is my favorite PALE ALE but not my favorite IPA.. its easy to down 3 of these quickly in fact i got to go get another. buy/try this one for sure"
"D: Easy to drink, could drink and did drink 3 of these no problem. So where's the distribution for this guy?"
"Dark amber/caramel color with a nice amount of lacing. Fresh lemon and pine needle aroma. Taste of lemon/lime citrus and pine sap, loads of hops yet exceptionally well balanced. Very drinkable, smooth, and refreshing. An excellent session beer. My first from FFF lived up to its reputation."
"This was my first beer from Three Floyds, so I didn't know what to expect. It ended up reminding me a lot of SN Pale Ale or a Firestone Double Barrel Ale with a hoppier finish. Nice beer, but I won't feel too upset that we don't get it where I live. There's a number of beers in this style we do get here which are less expensive and just as enjoyable. However, I am still glad I got to try it."
"This one is a bit of a wild card. It's not really East or West Coast style IPA and, for that matter, it's not really American in some ways. A little more biscuity than I'd expect and the hop profile is excellent, but just that little bit unfamiliar. Great beer and I'd highly recommend it."
"D - I wish I had a six pack of this stuff. One is not going to do it."
"Overall: this is the 6th ive had of this 6-pack that i had imported from indiana (not all at one time) and i can honestly say that this one didnt do it for me. I would take a dales pale, snpa, or a anchor liberty ale over this any day of the week and all of those beers are cheaper and easier to get. A let down"
"It feels a little slick in the mouth. I guess I was expecting a little more from FFF."
"Poured a clear auburn amber body with minimal head but some good lace. A very citric hop smell hit me in the nose first, along with a minor mix of sweet malt. A great pale ale taste - medium-boded with a mix of hops for a dry, citric taste and blended with sweet malts for a balanced beer that lights up the palate as it goes down smooth (almost buttery) and finishes with a nice dry backbite. A solid beer to have anytime."
"great taste. it definitely lives up to the hype. great feel on the palate, no real aftertaste. initially a bit crisp and carbonated that blends into a wonderfully creamy and smooth mouthfeel. great hop flavor, and an over superbly balanced beer."
"Poured a deep orange color with a small white head that disappeared rather quickly. Nose is sweet, malty, citrus and floral and pretty malty too. Taste is malty, some citrus and hop bite. Mouthfeel is ok. Malty, citrus and kind of blah. Nothing spectacular. Overall an average Pale for me."
"D: Very drinkable. Great aroma, taste, and finish. I would definitely have this again."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: I think this is a fantastic representation of an IPA. It has a good hop component without being harsh and a nice malt character to create balance for the strong hop presence. The beer has amazing layers of flavor and aroma. The fact that this beer is also so drinkable makes it a nice addition to any wonderfully packed beer fridge. Alpha King is absolutely delicious and a must buy, in my opinion, for IPA lovers."
"Pretty tasty as it is although nothing too special."
"This is a great sessional APA on the verge of an IPA."
"Have now had 4 bottles of this beer, and it has to rank near the top of my sessionable beer list. I'm a big IPA/DIPA fan, and this could easily be one instead of a pale. Very fresh hop aroma and taste, and drinkable given the moderate abv%. Mouthfeel is good, nothing special, but a great overall example of the pale ale style. For what it's worth, I generally avoid PA's in favor of an IPA, but this one blows away most other pure PA's (think SNPA) I've had due to the more present hop aromas and flavor. Great beer by FFF."
"Bottle. Poured a nice amber, nice slightly off-white head that left lacing. Aroma was very inviting, nice citrus and pine notes. Flavor is slight hoppy, again nice citrus and pine flavors, very subtle, not over the top. Will be having this one again."
"thanks beergynt for the trade!!! good thing i got a six pack, these will go quickly!"
"M/D - nice mouthfeel and carbonation as well as a really great taste, definitely one I wish I could still get locally"
"Hoppiness is sufficient, and sweetness is a definite plus for this beer. Both are balanced to perfection. I have had Alpha King on tap and in bottle, and both are consistently good."
"4.5 D: I can deal without the complexity in the malts because the hops taste so damn good. Therefore, this beer is extremely drinkable."
"D - This is a great example of a pale ale! It really doesnt get any better than this. Outstanding flavor and high drinkability. If this wasnt such a rarity for Texas, I would easily drink the entire six pack in one night. Highly recommended!!!!"
"Cheers to FFF!"
"Great quaffability. i wish I had grabbed a full six pack."
"Cheers!"
"D- It could sit back and just kill six packs of these any season of the year. However this beer + a cookout= heaven."
"Orange amber with lots of tiny suspended yeast particles visible. Very fine whipped tan head that settles into a nice collar of foam that leaves lots of sticky rings of lace on the glass. Smells of floral hops and caramel maltiness. Tastes pretty hoppy for an APA,with lots of grapefruit upfront with a solid malt backbone. I think their mild ale is more an APA and this is more IPA, but who cares? It is outstanding. Medium bodied mouthfeel with a fine carbonation. A hop head's beer for sure."
"Drinkabiliity: Three Floyd's with another hit. Here's hoping they expand into Western PA."
"Solid apa."
"D: At 6% ABV, Alpha King is more than accommodating. Drinkability? Ermm...let's just say I had more than three."
"d- an addictive APA! Very crisp and refreshing. This could be a great go-to APA and wouldn't be bad as an introduction to hoppier beers, especially if you like cirtus fruits! I can see myself drinking a lot of this in my future."
"Good beer and one of my top rated active bootle beers for the APA style."
"Drinkability - This beer is legendary and is a staple at the map room at all times. Was excited to try it, and thought it was good enough to have earned it's respect. I wasn't awwed, but would have no problem having this as a fixture in my house."
"Head is foamy, large, orange tan in color. Mild carbonation. Deep copper and russet in color, slight haze. Aroma is sweetly citrus, oranges and some grapefruit, along with some spicy pepperiness. Caramel malt and citrus fill the mouth, good bit of hop bitterness throughout. Alcohol is noticeable, not too strong though. Finishes with a lingering taste of candied orange peel. Reputation is well deserved."
"I still agree with my comments above but will add this beer doesn't have a bright citrus taste but it leans in that direction. It sits somewhere between the APA and IPA camp."
"This is an exceptional IPA and well deserves its reputation. My only complaint is that it is not readily available."
"From keg into pint glass. Half finger of soft white head. Good lacing on glass. Smell is very much citrus hops. Taste is great! Citrus hops and biscuitlike malt are perfectly mixed. Light dry mouthfeel is perfect. The most drinkable pale ale I've ever had. An absolute amazing beer."
"Pours dark amber with a half inch of head. This bottle had some sediment, but most do not, I'm not exactly sure what causes this. Mainly a citrus smell, not very strong, but very pleasant. The taste is very hoppy with a good malt backing. This is a great example of an American pale ale, my personal favorite."
"Taste has a nice smooth malt at the start with a little hop bite to finish. This beer is very well balanced. Would probably be nice up higher ABV session beer."
"Pours a hazy reddish brown color with a mediocre small white head and minimal sticking. A mellow nose of resinous hops and pine, musty pale malts lay balanced in the nose but overall its aroma doesnt necessarily strike me as inviting. Sweet malt character, brown sugar, big notes of grapefruit and orange peel. Lively bubbles, coating medium body and a long lingering bittersweet aftertaste. Good drinkability, but i was expecting so much more from this beer, possibly i got an old bottle, and i would love to experiment with Alpha King again but until that day, im unimpressed."
"A: Medium copper, thin layer of head - 4.00, S: Wonderfully hoppy aromas, hard to believe this is a pale ale and not and IPA, bubble gum, lemon zest - 4.75, T: Grapefruit along with some earthy hops, nicely balanced with a medium malt, slightly on the side of green, extremely flavorful - 5.00, M: 4.50, D: This is one finely crafted beer, solid all around, hopheads will delight in this brew, I would make this part of my regular rotation if it was more readily available - 4.50"
"D: Carbonation and great flavor make this one very drinkable. A very good beer."
"D-This brew that blurs the lines between an APA and IPA is about as good in flavour as a mild ABV hop bomb can get. This stuff is absolutely lovely. I could put dwon pint after pint of this liquid nectar without any problems."
"Pours with a beautiful creamy head. Good lacing. A light amber color, my favorite color for a hoppy ale. The smell is centennial, you know citrus, kind of pungent. There is also a bit of breadiness if you seek it out. A brilliant smell. The taste is great. A bit bitter, but talk about balance! There is a sort of nutty, biscuity malty taste under the hops. And the hops are just like it smells, refreshing bitterness with grapefruit flavor. You can also detect the tiniest grassiness in the taste, which I enjoy. You get a hit of carbonation with each drink, pretty straightforward in its delivery, which is very enjoyable. The taste lingers, and actually feels a bit sweeter after the initial bitter feeling. This could be dangerous. For an APA, 6.00 could catch up with you quickly. But it would be possible to drink quite a lot of these quickly. Too bad I can't purchase 3F in SC, but I may have some more coming from a friend."
"D-Higher-than-average alcohol content and strong flavor make it easy and pleasurable to have a couple, but more difficult to take down a sixer. More of a premium beer or finisher than a session beer."
"Thanks For Reading"
"M/D: very very very easy to drink, dominates my thoughts and makes me want another. i will be sad when this glass is gone"
"Drinkability: I'd drink more in a night but I like diversity in all things, a classic from a legendary brewer."
"Wow, a great beer."
"Overall, this is an excellent APA and well worth the money and the effort of finding."
"On a recent trip to the Three Floyds brewery with bheilman and swiftymcbeer I had the chance to try this gem. I don't know if it was the excitement of being at the birth place of this brew or what but I must say this truly is the king of pale ales. Much darker in color than I would have guessed with a frothy head that left a nice stache on your face. Slightly hoppy smell with tones of citrus. Great classic pale ale flavor. Hoppy, carmely, orangy, fruity, bitter all the good stuff. This pale ale is a true pleasure to drink and I would highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys this style."
"M/D: Probably the best APA I have tried to date. The beer was smooth, very easy to drink, medium body and good carbonation level. Very well done beer."
"Mouthfeel: Carbonation is good and the aftertaste is pleasant."
"A very good brew. Works well with a thick beef stew with root vegetables. A nice choice for balanced flavors. Definitely worth a try if you haven't had one before."
"This being my first beer from 3F I am very impressed and am anxious to try their others. If you ever have a chance to try this beer I highly recommend it."
"D - A guy can dream. During said recent trip to Chicago, this was my go-to beer. As a 300lb guy, this easily qualifies as sessionable at 6%. Not only could I drink it at every chance possible, I craved it. Case of a beer living up to the hype."
"Longneck served into an American pint. Fill level on the bottle was very high - almost right at the top of the opening. Shows a hazed light amber in the glass with a light covering of white head that is dying fast. Smells of strong flowery hop, dark caramel, toffee, orange, and pine - hops dominate the nose. Big, bright flowery hop flavor to start complimented with some orange peel, moving into pine and finishing with caramel and lemon. Medium carbonation and body, and a nice drinker for fans of the humulus lupulus. A very hop forward pale with a higher than average caramel malt character. I would have to say one of the finer examples of an American Pale."
"It's suprisingly dark for a ""pale ale"" and this coupled with the intense hoppy aromas let's you know you are dealing with a serious brew. Taste is burly with sharp flavors up front and smooth on the finish. For some reason this reminds me of Stone's Ruination, and yes, I know the styles are different. Maybe it's just the up front machismo that both of those beers deliver. Whatever the case, this is a fantastic beer. Of the 3F's that are available all the time, I put this right behind Gumballhead. On tap, this actually gets the slight edge, the Gumballhead seems to shine a little brighter out of the bottle. Either way, that is a potent one-two punch from the crew up in Munster, one that can stand up to any brewer in the nation."
"I had this on draft at the Beer Cellar in Indy. This is a serious beer. It has a significant hoppiness that made me think it was an IPA rather than an APA. It has a citrus flavor with spiciness and a dash of sweetness. It smacks you in the mouth before it is done with you. I will be visiting Three Floyds the next time I am in Chi-town. A very very good brew."
"D - smooth, tasty and very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Well, there you have it. Probably the best APA I've ever had, and it's a style I'm quite fond of. No alcohol to be found here, though I do recognize it may be on the higher side of the scale, stylistically. That aside, this one's gorgeous, aromatic, flavorful, smooth, and is incredibly quaffable. I am envious of those who have this as a ""go to"" beer. Highly recommended."
"Pours a watermelon pinkish color in dim pub lighting,quite nice looking. The covering of thin off-white bubbles hangs for a minute,before falling to a quick death,sheets of lace are bringing this full tilt. This is like a whopping rainbow of hoppy fruitiness pine-apple(zebra stripes gum on steroids). Big bubble gum notes(Bubble Yum) and Star Burst candy flavors,creamy and dreamy. Pretty hoppy for a APA,but not the intense taste bud assaulting hops,more fruity. Juicy and mouth watering from start to finish. Cotton candy beer.A three ring circus of hop,malt and more hops that never disappoints. Well orchestrated and delightful."
"It's my second favorite Pale Ale (behind Founder's Harvest), and a great brew to buy a sixer and share with friends."
"Simply put, this is an incredibly solid and well-crafted beer. For a pale ale, it was definitely the most intense version I have yet to try (it more closely resembled an IPA than a pale ale). Overall, another winner from the folks at Three Floyds."
"my buddy vic put it the best. you could drink 50 of these. if i had the option to i could easily put back a sixer of this."
"I can enjoy one or two, or enjoy it all day and night."
"The taste was delicious: the beer began mildly sweet and finished mildly dry with some nice fruity/caramel notes, not too overpowering in any flavor, but just enough to make you want to drink more. Well balanced. I picked up a much stronger citrus/grass/hop flavor when I burped (I love the beers that give hop burps) Also, I enjoyed the heavier body of the beer. A couple of these would fill you right up."
"Overall, I really liked this beer but it didn't quite live up to the hype."
"This is not to be missed, a fabulous pale ale that I'd contend is more IPA than APA. Regardless, hop lovers shouldn't be disappointed after enjoying this, a genuine treat and the best in what few Three Floyds wares I've had the good fortune to sample. It won't be the last time. Outstanding."
"This is just a fantastic american pale ale. Three Floyds shows me again that they know how to put out high quality beer. From now on ,I will give the King the respect he deserves!!"
"I consider this to be very drinkable. Wouldn't quite call it a session beer but wouldn't mind having 3 or 4."
"d: What a tease. I find my new favorite pale ale on-tap at the Brass Rail, and now I might never find it again."
"Drinikability is very high. This is in my top 3 IPAs."
"This is by far the best APA ive ever had. It is very drinkable and walks the line of becoming an east coast style ipa. Though not overly bitter. If you haven't had this beer your missing out!"
"Drinkability: This is definitely an enjoyable beer. It packs a bit of a punch (for me anyway) and the bitterness is nice -- something that could be sipped on for a long night."
"Pours an orangish copper color with a thick tan head. The nose has a big bouquet of fruity and floral hops along with big fruity malts. Taste is also an explosion of citrusy hops over sweet bready malts. A medium body is nicely carbonated and goes down quite well. A very well made brew."
"Poured to a nice offwhite head. Head didnt last real long. Had some nice lacing that left rings with every swallow. Ale was reddish brown in color. Also poured a little cloudy. Smelled of floral and hops. You know that flowery smell. Also of malt and pine. Had a strong slightly bitter pine taste. Also tasted malt and a little alcohol. Slightly bitter aftertaste hung around a while. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. Felt light. The problem you run into is that you just want to start chugging because its tastes to damn good. You would have to be carefull with the slightly higher alcohol content."
"A great extra from a generous BA knocks off an unlisted want. A vigorous pour yields a 1 finger head. Dark reddish brown with minimal lacing. There is a nice floral hop aroma with a trace of citrus. The taste is well balanced, with a small and sweet malt backbone balancing out the astringent hops. The beer is medium bodied with good carbonation, and I want another."
"america IPA style for a pale. amber IPA look with spotty lace. quite malty and backed with some hop fruitiness. grapefruit, orange peel, (both mature sweet and young bitter), and the metallic nature of green tea. mild floral jasimine. solid pale. but more an IPA. american. very plentiful approach. doesn't really pick up on the more delicate aspects of a pale. great beer but the power drill mistaken for a screwdriver."
"Wow! Three Floyds has impressed me again. This is a quality beer that can easily be mistaken for an IPA and still hang with the best of them."
"D- Delicious!"
"Drinkability: doesn't get any easier to drink than this. This would go in my permanent rotation if it was readily available on the east coast."
"Sampled this six pack while lost in Southern Indiana. Out of the bottle it poured a copper color with some mandarin highlights around the edges. The off white head was fluffy, laced well and retained well too. Great looking brew. The aroma was bright and hoppy, lots of citrus, some floral notes and slightly resinous. The taste was equally spot-on for the style, first a bitter hop bite followed by grapefruit and lemon zest. Behind that was the deeper malt balance, biscuity and solid along with some pine. As I continued to sample it the hops developed more nuances, orange zest, kumquat and hemp or it's smokable cousin. Quite complex and yet approachable like that cute, late 20's, school-teacher you want to chat up at the end of the bar. The mouthfeel was smooth, medium bodied and it finishes crisp. Like the school teacher, glad I took this one home."
"Hazy copper body topped by small beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, grapefruit. Taste is grapefruit, medium sweet, fairly intense bitterness. Still, the sweetness lends decent balance to the hops. Medium body. Nice hoppy ale. A little fruity, nice finish. Another great beer from Three Floyds."
"This is a really tasty pale ale. Often I am bored by pales and feel little motivation to drink them. Alpha King is certainly an exception. Serious malt foundation and serious hops. Though the hops are well balanced against the malt flavors and don't drown the flavor. If you told me this was an east coast IPA, I wouldn't question it. Regardless of labels, this is a great one."
"D: As far as Pale Ale's go this is right up there. Maybe I'm partial to the brewery after trying most of their stuff and being thoroughly impressed, but what can I say, I like the way FFF makes beer. Highly drinkable."
"I'm definitely going to have to add this to the regular beer rotation from here on out. Three Floyd's continues to make a fan out of me. This surpasses Robert the Bruce as my favorite amongst their kickass brands."
"D - So crisp and fresh tasting, easy drinker here. Excellent APA."
"poured from a growler. floral hop scents up front. slightly malty with bitter hop finish, more towards the citrus. very floral and slightly sweet. smooth in the mouth with light carbonation, probably because i poured it straight into the glass. very drinkable!"
"Great, light, not filling, easy-drinking, mother of a beer. I will have this again. I'm rueing that I am going to have to send a couple of bottles of this puppy away!"
"This beer is definitely sessionable. I think my fiance will drink all of mine though, so someone send me more! Daddy like!"
"The color is a medium amber, a little bit darker than your average APA. Had a 1 finger head that disappeared quickly, lacing was minimal. There is a walloping hop nose of grapefruit, pine, and flowery esters. My friend calls this ""Kind bud beer"". The taste is mostly hops, spicy, citrus, yet balanced Medium to light body with a little carbonation. Very drinkable, possibly sessionable, but I usually like to switch up my beer anyway."
"Update: Just had what I know to be relatively fresh and it was much better. Still not living up to the hype, but the citrusy nose is very clear and strong and then taste is much hoppier. A very solid bre."
"A very drinkable beer. I have enjoyed this one many times and only wish they distributed to Michigan."
"Overall: great pale ale"
"Overall: A good beer...not great. One of the better pale ales I have tasted."
"Drinkability - What shall I do with my remaining 5 bottles? Drink them seems in order. Very nice offering and approachable for someone who isn't a hop-head. Nicely balanced and well presented."
"Pours a clean copper color with a white head. In the the aroma, big citrus/ grapefruity hops. In the taste, sweet, grapefruity hops and a nice balanceing maltiness. A small bite and medium mouthfeel, with a citrus/ grapefruity hops in the aftertaste. Big hops and mellow for a pale, easy to drink."
"I'll be back for more of this one"
"It was easy to drink, would have been more enjoyable if it had a bit more maltiness to balance it some."
"A hop-head's version of a pale ale, for sure! And nicely done, Firm malt backbone keeps the hops tied in nicely. A goodie!"
"D - I get the impression that the bottle I had didn't hold up as well as most, since it is missing the same hoppy profile most others are talking about. Still a great brew, but I would be curious to try it again fresh for comparison."
"D: This beer is truly great. I am now a fan. Great balance to this beer and that is what I like in my APAs. Damn near perfect."
"D: Insanely drinkable, one of the freshest cleanest tasting ""Pale ales"" I've had in recent memory. Alpha King is a must try from the cask."
"So damn drinkable, unlike a lot of American IPAs there is no harsh lingering aftertastes, yet has more hop flavor than those same IPAs. This is a beautiful beer (especially if you get to try it out of the serving tanks at the brewpub). If I could get this beer where I live, it would be in the fridge at all times. Highly recommended."
"This is a fairly well-balanced American IPA with a variety of hop flavors - fruity, resiny, piney, all balanced by a clean malt backbone. Only points for improvement are a bit more head retention and increased bitterness. Despite this, I could drink it all night long. Delicious."
"Definitely recommended, I'm upset I can't buy this as my everyday beer."
"This beer pours with a light amber hue. It has absolutely great coloring and density. The smell is almost sweet, setting the stage for the surprisingly sweet taste as well. You can taste the hops - but is not an overwhelming amount. The feel is crisp and light. There is no dry texture here. This beer is delicious and more drinkable than your average pale ale."
"Wow. This is like hops in a bottle. This beer has the aroma and hop flavor of a double IPA with the drinkability of a pale ale. BIG BIG hop aroma. A little out of balance and could use some more residual sweetness to even things out, but overall very good."
" Easily drinkable Pale ale with a solid complexity."
"There's definitley a reason why this is considered one of the best in its style. With a fantastic balance and full flavored nature, this is hands down one of the best Pale Ales I've ever had the pleasure of trying. My only quibble is that there is a touch too much heat in the body that hinders the drinkibility a bit. Otherwise, I could drink this all night. Good stuff!"
"This beer is by far the best pale ale I've had. Just like everything FFF does, there's much more flavor here than many of their contemporaries' beers. Delicious. And officially my favorite pale ale."
"Another extra from bgramer; an unbelievably generous trader (thanks Brendan). Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a translucent copper red; excellent clarity. Tight, off-white head approached the rim of the pint before reducing its volume in half within about 30 seconds. Cap eventually settled into a thin semi-consistent skim with strands of watery lacing spattered around the walls of the glass. Aromas of floral, piney hops immediately hits the nose. Taste consistent with nose with a strong grapefruit character that leaves a lingering bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a distinct tingle across the tongue. This is an excellent representation of the APA style and I can see why it is a Three Floyds flagship brew, as such, I tried to be true to the style in my rating; however, a little too hoppy for my preference. If you are a fan of the style, this is definitely a brew to measure all other APAs against."
"On tap at Coles. Great looking orange/amber colored beer. Smells a bit sweet with some tropical fruit and floral notes. Moderately bitter and fruity. I get berries in there somewhere. Alcohol comes through late but its subtle and adds to the flavor. An all around unique and tasty pale."
"D- Very much so, would be a great thing to have on a hot summer day by the lake, like I'm doing now."
"It may be good to be the king, but it's great to drink an Alpha King. See It. Drink It. Love It."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours a Sienna brown, and the hints of red come through pretty generously when held to the light and the big frothy white head left sticky lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is citrusy hops with lemon in the forefront and nice sweet bready malts coming thorough on the back end. The taste is really complicated. The obvious citrusy and piney hops come through but subtle hints of caramel, anise and rye for some reason come out to me. These tastes are not what I would normally pick out in a APA but man, every single flavor is pretty precise to me. Weird. The mouthfeel is full for an APA and leaves a nice coating on the mouth. This is a great APA, my only knock is it seems a bit hopped for a standard APA, almost more like a mild IPA."
"The initial hit from this beer is the hops with their citrus and slight piney flavours. The beer is really balanced. It has a great fruity malt back bone and is a great addition to the hops. There is a pleasing bitterness to the end of the beer; the bitterness comes across a bit strong at first, but settles out quite nicely after more drinking. The mouthfeel is creamy and a bit thick, perfect for a pale ale. The drinkability of this beer is just absurd..."
"This is another beer my wife brought me home :) This beer pours a dark bronze with a very light head. The smell is not overpowering but what I can catch I get nuts and alcohol. The inital taste is nutty! Beautifully nutty and the it follws with malts. A very nice beer and definatley something I could drink all night if it was more readily available on Long Island"
"D: A great big drinking pale by all means, will leave your mouth watering anxiously awaiting the next sip. Great drinkability, and case worthy by all means."
"I really want to taste more of their offerings."
"All in All, this is a very fine well built beer. It's a damn shame that it's not available in Texas."
"D - It is a very enjoyable beer to drink."
"First of all, I really enjoyed the beer. My only concern is that it seems more along the lines of an IPA than APA to me. Otherwise, a great beer!"
"Very drinkable it would be very easy to drink a few of these on a nice summer day."
"Wow, what a beer. It's a bit on the bitter side but it's remarkably balanced with those sweet malt flavors. I used to think that SNPA was the benchmark for APAs, but now I think Alpha King takes the crown, no pun intended."
"Notes: I had my buddy pick me up 2 sixxers of this when he went to Chicago for a couple weeks. He couldn't believe how much he was spending on twelve beers. I couldn't believe that he was around the block from a Binny's. I guess it's all perception."
"Acquired from thickerfreakness. Thanks dude! Decanted from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours an amber color with a one-finger head that fizzles away quickly. Aroma of resiny hops, citrus hops, and big, sweet caramel malt. Taste starts with a pleasant resiny bitterness, then the citrus kicks in, and finally it finishes with caramel and bready malts. Nice medium body, with a quite high drinkability. Honestly this tastes more like an IPA to me, but I'm a hophead, so I'm quite into this beer."
"D : A little too much on the hop side for me. I prefer a more balanced beer."
"I poured this from a bottle into a pint glass, looking forward to this hoppy pale ale at the end of the day. There wasn't a lot on the nose initially, but it had a nice white head on top of the golden beer. I was surprised by how creamy it was in the mouth. I was also expecting something a bit more hoppy, but what I got was just a nice American pale ale that I'd happily enjoy again."
"Huge hop presence in the nose, with much to offer in the malt department. Taste is quite sweet with huge hops to make it nice and bitter. I actually used to prefer this from the bottle slightly more, as it is less sweet, but now tap is where it's at. At any rate, an amazing session ale."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Low alcohol levels and great flavor make the beer easy to consume, bitterness will limit the amount of consumption however."
"D- Very easy to drink. Very refreshing."
"I can drink this all night long, very enjoyable. No wonder it's Three Floyds flagship beer. Fantastic."
"D - Not cloying, fun beer. Easy to drink. The sour note is my only dent in this tasty beer."
"Drinkability was great, a very well put together APA"
"Given to me by Rich at Bellport Beer (he acquired some through beer trading), the beer poured an orange amber color with a small off-white head. Wonderful and balanced hop aromas emanate off the top of this beer. Wow! This tastes more like an IPA than an APA and it's great. The hop flavor is very rich and not abrasive at all. I even noticed a slight caramel or chocolate note in the hop finish. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Definitely one of the best American Pale Ale's I've had."
"Drinkability - wire-to-wire goodness. A great beer to get a quick hop fix but really not something I could session at length."
"Overall, its a great session or go to beer. I really enjoy it."
"Impressive, even better than the bottle version."
"D: A nice job from this brewery, and a pleasure to have tried. It makes me wish it were still here even more, as it would make for a great, easy-going - though perhaps a little high to be sessionable - drink to enjoy in casual conversation on the patio."
"Taste & mouthfeel: This is a pale ale? Dry and ultra-hoppy, this drinks more like an American IPA. Oily hops present flavors of grapefruit and lemon peel that segue into a resiny bitter finish. Malts are subdued and provide little more than a foundation for the hops - I wouldn't call this balanced, but it's delicious."
"Poured a light ruby red amber color with a great sparkling body and sudsy light colored hear. Smell was very grainy with spicy citrusy hops that jump through. Taste is a balanced IPA with plenty of hops present as well as a strong grain bill. Some lemongrass comes through as well making this a really smooth mouth feeling. Drinkability is really high and this is one of my favorite sessionable beers if only it was more available in Ohio."
"Had this one on draft the night before DLD and on DLD as well. Liked it and bought a 6 pack to bring home. I initially ordered this one to come down off my Alpha Kong high. It was a very pleasant APA. It was a clear, golden-orange with a nice, fluffy white head. It left a little lacing as the beer disappeared from my glass. A strong hop aroma did not translate into an overwhelming hoppy taste, which I was glad of since the Kong almost destroyed my tastebuds. It was a clean, crisp tasting pale ale. Light in the mouth with minimal aftertaste, this beer would be a great addition to my regular rotation....if I didn't live in Alabama."
"Well balanced, very drinkable."
"once again three floyds doesnt not let me down this pale ale was hoppier then i thought it was going to be it poured a nice amber color with nice lacing around the glass.This truely is one of the best pale ale i have had.I would recommend getting a hold of this best to have a good session to. It saddens me that I only had one"
"D: This would be a staple in my fridge if I had access to it. It is an extremely drinkable APA and I could drink a few of these in a sitting. Highly recommended!"
"Copper to amber in color the beer poured a 1/2"" tight head that dissipated slowly. The nose was filled with piney hops followed by a bit of grapefruit, spice and caramel. These flavors cointinue into the mouth which was concentrated and had good weight though remained light on its feet. The midpalate had richness and sweetness to it which gradually turned dry toward the finish. This is a really well made beer that I could drink all of the time."
"This brew pours a nice clear copper with a finger's worth of foam. Smell if of citrus, a hint of pine, some resin, and a nice malt backbone. Taste follows suit - incredible balance in this brew. Hops lead the way, with a nice citrus and pine flavors, followed by a caramel and toasted malt flavor. Great balance in this once. Drinks smooth with a nice crisp finish. This is a great pale ale, and if it were available, I'd likely drink it on a regular basis. Another great brew from Three Floyds."
"D - Drinks almost like an IPA. This is quite the hopped up pale ale, certainly worthy of being Three Floyd's flagship beer. This brew is highly drinkable and extremely flavorful."
"Fruity, beautiful and complex all-around. One of the best Pale Ales I've had. Hits the spot and is easy to drink."
"Remains on the tongue after the swallow. Thick and a tiny bit fizzy but goes down smooth. It's a superior beer."
"This is a great session beer. I'd like to always have a 6-pack handy in my fridge."
"This one is simply damn good. IPA? APA? Who cares? A mainstay in my fridge that everyone should get to enjoy regularly."
"Although somewhat tauted as a hop-bomb, I found the balance of this APA to be its strength. The citrusy/pine hop flavors are incredibly balanced with the caramel malt sweetness to make this a classic, benchmark APA. Finishes clean and crisp with a fairly aggressive bitterness. Great stuff!"
"Wanted to revisit with a bottle that was sent via trade. The hops are just as present and pleasant. Truly a damn fine beer, even more IPA like than I had remembered. delicious."
" Well rounded super hoppy, malty flavor, that improves as it warms. Bursting with flavor! This should be drank slowly, but goes down so easly. for me this is as about as good as it gets."
"Score: 4.5/4/4.5/3.5/4.5"
"D- Tempted to drink the whole 6, so tasty."
"Notes: I can see now why so many people like this, a true classic American Pale Ale!"
"D: I'd drink another. Definitely the hopppiest APA i've tried"
"Not a beer to knock your socks off, but if I could get this in bulk I'd keep a stock on hand all the time!"
"T/M/D: I would elaborate, but this is standard. Nice and hoppy, but just a mundane pale ale."
"I think this beer stands with the hop giants. It's not an IIPA or even and IPA (technically), but it is one of the best examples of hops out there."
"This is a great go-to...pale ale? Really? Could have fooled me. Anywho, consider yourself lucky if you can grab these on a regular basis."
"D. A great sessionable American Pale Ale. Definitely wish I had more than one!"
"D: Not as good as I thought it was going to be, but pretty respectable. I guess it's hard to live up to perfection every time."
"Man candy."
"A tasty beverage! Easy to drink and quite enjoyable. This one can be consumed all night."
"Thanks to Sephiroth for this one, also. Poured from bottle into a snifter- pours a deep amber color with good sized creamy white head. Tons of lacing. Tons of piney hop aromas, without even taking a good whiff of this one! It comes right out. Great bite right off the bat. Grainy, piney bitterness. A hophead's delight. medium body with a lingering bitter flavor keeps this beer on the palate for a while. More bite and flavor that any PA I have had in a while. Kind of like a Sierra on steroids. I Like it a-l-o-t..."
"Drinkability is fantastic, especially after this one warms up a bit. At first it was a little overpowering compared to what I was expecting. 5 minutes after the first sip though, things mellowed out and are very smooth going down."
"Poured into a snifter. Alpha King pours a reddish amber color, with an off-white head that drops quickly. Really nice lacing. Great hop aroma..very floral, citrusy and piney. Taste starts with an iced tea, malty background, with a very nice hoppy twang that reminds me of centennial and cascade. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little dry. Light mouthfeel as well. I could drink a ton of these if only Three Floyds was in Florida. Very nice American Pale Ale."
"seems like enough has been said, but i have to shout out to this nice, hoppy, citrusy and slightly piney pale ale. great pale ale for the hop head, and nice malt backbone as well. seems this brewery has developed somewhat of a cult following, and they deserve it. never had anything below par by them. please keep 'em coming three floyds. cheers."
"I can see why hopheads would love this beer! Not my cup of alpha."
"Very sturdy for a Pale Ale, with strong flavor and big bitterness. Very drinkable."
"D - Drinkability is really high on this as I could see myself buying this and just drinking one after another. It could possibly be the beer of choice for those nights when one just wants to drink beer after beer instead of sipping along. I also have to add that if I were ever stuck on a deserted island with only one beer this is the one beer that I would hope is with me since I do not think I could ever tire of this one as it just brings you everything you want in a beer and does it greatly."
"D- This would be an absolutely excellent session beer. One of my favorite pale ales to date. Has all of the hop flavor but none of the bitterness which makes it pretty drinkable."
"Pours a rich, cloudy honey/amber color, with a big lasting, and lasting, and lasting beige head. Never seen anything less than a rich stout hold onto a head the way this did. Smell is huge bold hops, citrusy, and fruity sweet caramel and is just mouthwatering. Taste is very nicely hopped, but not overdone at all. A great flavorful sweetness really rounds this beer out, and a nice satisfying bitterness, and full mouthfeel make this one of my all time favorites. A must try if you like American Pales."
"Goddamn, this is one of the best beers I've ever had. It pulls down my pants and taunts me. Thanks to Louisdog for the trade. Pours a deep orange color, lots and lots of white foam that leaves an opaque layer on the glass. Smells strongly of citrus. Tastes of citrus, some malt, and a solid amount of bitterness. Outstanding balance of flavor. Close to IPA territory, and in fact I've had IPAs that were less intense. Strong but not too much carbonation, and I was done with it before I realized what had happened. Jesus, how do those Floyd guys do it? And by the way, which one's Pink?"
"This is a very clean, super example of a West Coast style IPA that is highly drinkable. If I could get this locally, I would be stocking it up."
"D- I could definitely have a couple of these. I think I should road trip to Munster, IN!"
"Alpha King Pale Ale pours a hazy orange with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is citrusy hops. The flavor is also dominated by citrusy hops, and the malt is up to the job of balancing this beer nicely, but stays in the background. This is a hoppy beer, but it's not a as strong as a DIPA type beer, I think I could session this beer all night. Very enjoyable."
"Overall- This was a quick review while taking a break from brewing. My friend had some in the fridge and I have been dying to try it. Very sweet and a nice offering all the way around. Glad I finally got to give it a go. I would definitely seek this one out."
"Drinkability is excellent. A classic example of american hoppiness. Too hoppy to compare to most other american pale ales, this one holds its own next to the best american IPAs such as Mad Hatter."
"Drinkability is very high, I really like the balance between hops and malts, this is a very hop-forward pale ale in the session range with very little alcohol presence, i'm glad i was able to get a 6-pack of this tasty ale!"
"Have heard this beer is cream of the crop of Three Floyds releases other than Dark Lord, did not disappoint, best pale ale I have ever had, will buy a six pack next time I make it to this store even though it is fifteen dollars"
"Drinkability: Pretty good beer. Very drinkable for a beer that focuses on hops. One of the better Pale Ales out there and definitely easy to drink."
"We have had the Alpha King all over, in bottle and on-tap, at the brewery and other places, but I don't think we had it from the cask before. What a fantastic beer! Nice dark amber with a good froth in the glass. The smell is full, hoppy and floral. On the palate, all the good things of Alpha King are emphasized in this super-smooth and drinkable brew, floral hops, fruit, length. I was reminded of Fuller's London Pride and Brakspears (RIP) in particular as examples of a complex fruity bitter."
"Balanced hop aroma without residual bitterness. Heads up decently. Nice malt tones combine with hops of the style to make a beer that's scarily drinkable. Very clean mouthfeel. Has always been one of my favorites; for an IPA this drinks waaaayyy too easily."
"Finally getting to some of the Three Floyds brews. A golden amber pour is topped off by a one-finger tan head that dissipates in it's own good time leaving a jagged lacing behind. Smells of bold, citrusy hops which are rounded at the edge and present perfectly. I've never experienced this aroma in an APA. It's of a different class. Tastes of grapefruit covered with table sugar. The hop bitterness that follows is actually icing on the cake. I'm so enjoying drinking this one that I find it hard to write. Mouthfeel is smooth and comforting, but it also leaves you feeling like you're drinking a real-mans beer. There's something going on here that sets this one apart from the rest of the pack, and that's a mighty big pack we're speaking of."
"Drinkability: Well balanced, striking a satisfying compromise between refreshment and satiation. An excellent brew that is an exemplar of the style."
"D:This is probably one of the best pale ales I have had."
"At times I find myself thinking the beer is a bit thin, but the body seems to suit it. Carbonation is slightly on the low side, and as such I have trouble not draining the glass in one motion. Wish this was available locally, but then so do BA's in about 43 other states!"
"Considering how strong the hop smell was, I expect more bitterness from the hops but well pleasantly surprised at how balanced it was with the sweetness of the malt. Though that's not to say there's a lack of it, cause there's plenty of hops going through."
"I've had this a number of times but never had the occasion to review it. This review is based on a some I had on draft at the Map Room. Poured an orange/amber with a thin head that faded to a ring that stuck around. Smells of fruity apricot, cherry, a touch of rhubarb, with citrus as a top note. The taste is beautifully balanced and fruity,similar flavors as those found in the aroma, with cherry, vanilla, and citrus being especially pronounced. Nice hoppy bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, perfectly carbonated, a little rich. My absolute favorite session beer.I would have this around all the time if it were available in my area."
"Had this on tap at Sportstime Pizza. Reddish bronze color, with a thin white head that disappeared before too long. Slightly hazy. Moderate lacing. Smell is a wonderful harbinger of what is to come. VERY hoppy, mainly citrus. If I thought that the nose was hoppy, it was nothing compared to how it actually tasted. This bad boy is like a hop bomb. Amazing. The hop flavors actually come at you harder and faster after you swallow, kind of like when a roller coaster goes down the first big hill. Thicker on the mouthfeel than most pale ales, though this is definitely a good thing. With such a low ABV, this is easily sessionable. One of my new favorites, especially when I'm craving hops."
"The taste was similar in that you can definitely taste the hops, but they are not so prominent as to be the star. They mix well with the maltiness and some toffee, creamyness and make for a very easy to drink beer."
"A good beer, my favorite of this style."
"Great beer from the boys in Munster. I award them with having this in my fridge at all times."
"Finishes dry and is light bodied. Certianly nothing wrong with this one but nothing mind blowing either. I would recommend this as a nice, solid, everyday beer."
"EDIT: not nearly as impressive from growler... tapped 3 days ago and this tastes.... older?"
"Poured a really nice amber color with a decent head. Wonderful floral, hoppy smell with some citrus aromas. Great taste, not overpowering at all with just a slightly sweet finish. Good balance on the carbonation. Very drinkable, could easily go though one after another after another. Will gladly buy more when I find it."
"Pours a hazed golden amber. Nose seems to have apricots on it. Flavor is heavy with hops with the apricot present on the palate as well. Just as with other hop happy brews, you get that taste of hops lodged in the back of your mouth and it lingers. Feel is great. I get a silky smooth texture that slides over my tongue. Oh so drinkable. A hop lover and a craft brew lovers dream. Awesome beer."
"Overall, my favortie APA so far. Hopefully it will be easier to locate with the upcomming brewery expansion."
"Cloudy copper in color with minimal head. Unmistakable aroma of grapefruit over sweet malt that develops into a honey candy smell. The taste is very balanced and smooth with a nice dry finish. There is more carbonation than I would have suspected from the almost non-existent head. This is as drinkable a beer as any Ive had. It is about to be added to my list of beers to always have on hand."
"D: A simple brew that just does everything right. Probably the best of its style that I've had. Too bad this isn't available in my area. Would make a great session brew and I'd love to bring this to gatherings to try and convert some people."
"D - I generally don't care for pale ales because of the finish. It's usually too bitter but this is great. It has a little bitterness but much less than most pale ales. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves beer."
"our of a bottle into a nice pint glass of my friend's. the beer pours a nice dark amber. a small thin white head and it goes good with chicken fingers and watching THE WIRE on a cold winter night. pretty dark for a pale ale but it goes down fairly smooth. good beer."
"Nice darker amber fairly reddish body topped with a very nice thick foamy white head. Perhaps a touch dark for a pale ale in general, but a picturesque beer none the less. Good citrusy aroma but it could be stronger. The flavor is wicked smooth and tasty. Good amount of citrus flavor and a bunch of malt with some caramel. I could drink this stuff all day long. This is a great beer to go with the quesadilla I'm eating right now."
"D - Very drinkable beer that has such a good flavor you will easily drink more and more."
"The taste was almost as impressive. Very malty and hoppy. Fairly bitter, with a smooth sweet aftertaste. Good body to this beer, nice and heavy. Very drinkable. The heavy body and bitterness is surprising coming from the East Coast."
"Drinkability- This brew really reminds me of the fresh hop ales that come out around harvest season. What sets it apart is the depth in the flavor. Its not a one trick hop pony like some of those fresh hopped brews. Big thanks to ClockworksOrange! Awesome brew!"
"Update: bought a 6-pack at the brewery in April. Forgot how amazing this beer is. Big, juicy, pungent, dank, resiny hops. Good balance that keeps this enjoyable. Such a delicious hop profile. Why I didn't pick up a 6-pack of Zombie Dust while I was there will haunt me for a while."
"I told you the Beer Gods didn't want me to drink that sub-par brew. Thank God the next beer i cracked open produced a beautiful head with great lacing... every sip has been a pleasure and i'm gripping the glass with 2 hands this time."
"A good solid APA. Maybe not the best I've tried(Stoudt's and Flying Dog come to mind), but not a bad choice. In fact, I'd say a definite solid choice. Pours cloudy golden. Nice hoppy aroma, not too strong. Hoppy without being bitter in taste, nice and clean and crisp. Its best quality may be that it is very drinkable. Smoothness is its second best."
"D: An excellent beer, eminently drinkable and thoroughly enjoyable. This would quite possibly be my go to beer if I happened to live in Three Floyds distribution area."
"This is excellent! Three Floyds has done a great job with their flagship beer. Comes out a nice copper color and has very good head and nice lacing. It has a wonderful scent, very hoppy without being overly bitter. The same for the taste, along with a great caramel taste as well that serves to sweeten it a bit. Went down very easy. It was so good I got a growler of it to take home."
"T-"
"Drinkability: Wonderful for the style and much more complex than the average apa, the hop combination is great and the malt profile provides a nice backdrop to the excitement."
"Nice creamy medium body with good carbonation. Very drinkable. It's been a long time since I had one of these. I really wish 3F would come back to MD soon. Damn good beer. This would easily become my go to beer if I could get it regularly. Thanks, Eric!"
"D - It is a potent Pale Ale, maybe leaning towards an IPA. Still, this beer is exceptionally drinkable. Recommended."
"Finally got my hands on one of these after a friend went down to Indiana to grab a slew of Three Floyds stuff. Appearance is a deep orange color with a nice bit of white head on top that disappears nice and slowly. Nose is strong on crazy fruity hops, strong caramel hops. A good dose of spiciness in there too. Taste is likewise, only stronger. Powerful from both ends, with a nice balance to the hops and malt. How an APA should taste. Feel is solid, well carbonated. I loved this one. I'd drink about a hundred of these at a time if I had the opportunity (and the tolerance)."
"D - It tastes and drinks more like an IPA but I am not complaining. A bold hoppy pale ale."
"Drinkability: I have had better APA's, in my opinion (try Christian Moerlein OTR (Over The Rhine) Ale). But this is right up there. I would recommend this to any discerning beer drinker."
"So smooth and creamy,yet full and well-rounded. The drinkability? Simple,don't want to stop drinking it. Been a while since i had this beer almost forget excatly how great this beer was.One of my all-time favorite beers. A beer that everybody must try at least once. I know you'll want it again though."
"Thanks to Kingpin for the bottle. This pours a hazy reddish amber color, with a minimal whitish head and a scant amount of fine white lacing on the glass. The smell is citrussy. The taste is of intense citrussy hops(primarily grapefruit, as well as a slightly floral flavor)along with a sweet bready malty finish. The mouthfeel is rich and full and the flavors blend smoothly. This is a terrific drinker and may be the definitive APA. I only wish it was available in Minnesota."
"All in all a pretty nice beer. This is one of my favorite styles, so I do have plenty on my list I'd rate above this one though."
"Alpha King pours an amber color with a good inch of head. A few tiny bubble rise from the bottom of the glass and continues to keep a good layer of foam. The aroma is of pine and citrus hops, grapefruit, lemon and biscuit maltreally pushing it to an ipa standard. The taste is pleasantly bitter and refreshing, one of my favorites to drink on a hot day. Caramel and a touch of alcohol are present as the beer warms up a bit. This is one of the best pale ales out there, but not sure if I could drink a six pack of this without the hops and alcohol affecting my taste buds."
"Pours a nice slightly hazy orange with a thin off-white head. Aroma is some citrus hops and sweet malts with a hint of caramel. The taste is a delightful blend of mild citrus and a hint of pine hops well balanced with sweet malts with just a hint of caramel. The beer is light bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer and would make for a decent session had I picked up more than one bottle."
"D: Very high."
"Still, seek this beer out. It's fantastic."
"All and all, another good 3F offering. This is a very good beer, but as I consider a ""5" ranking as the best ever, my ranking is probably lower than most others."
""
"Pours a burned orange with a nice sized off white head that laces. Smells of citrus rind, floral, hops and a malt. Lots of yummy bitter hops with an awesome malt balance. Nice bite and dryness but doesnt linger on the tongue. This reminds me of Nugget Nectar. Feels smooth, crisp and delicious in the mouth. Drinkability goes on and on. A session beer classic. Cheers 3 F's."
"great copper color with a thin fluffy white head...smelled of floral hops, slightly piney...great mouthfeel, slightly oily with perfect carbonation...taste was great as well, with the underlying floral hop taste with a slight bite at the end...wonderful beer"
"thanks jamie."
"Hazy orange-tinted deep amber color. Pours with a one finger orange-tinted head that shortly collapses to a collar. Leaves a fairly sticky lace on the glass. The nose contains piney and citrusy hops, delicately sweetened by malt. A hint of mango can also be found. The taste offers caramel and pale malt sweetness that balances the bitterness while it lasts. The piney and citrusy hops detected in the nose dominate the taste with a strong hop bite. A hint of peach in the background. Bitterness builds into the finish with the hops becoming crisp and herbal. Body is medium. Beer feels slick on the tongue. Malt could be a bit more chewy though. Overall, it's a delicious beer that left me wanting more."
"D: A bit potent, but i could drink this beer all night. Gets better setting in your glass and getting warmer, but is really good super chilled as well."
"Overall: This is an excellent American pale ale, marred only by poor head retention."
"This is an incredible APA and quickly became one of my favorites. Enjoy."
"D- very high, delicious"
"D - Supremely drinkable. I could have one of these every day. The only problem is, of course, that Three Floyds does not distribute to SoCal."
"An excellent APA, worth seeking out."
"Overall: top shelf APA. This beer walks the line of IPA and PA as far as hoppiness goes. A bit heavier on flavors than most APAs (like thats a problem) but is still pretty much as drinkable as them. Outsanding."
"Drinkability - I'm very glad I have many more of these!!!!"
"Drinkability - I wish this was more plentiful in my area."
"This beer is uber drinkable and is a fantastic, complex beer that will not, no matter how hard you try, taste the same everytime. That is not because it's inconsistent between brewings, but rather because the taste will conjur up different memories and imagery everytime... it's that good."
"D: The greatest APA that i've tried so far, it's just a shame I can't get it very often, an American craft brewing classic."
"This is definitely an IPA in Pale Ale clothing. A great beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and a little bit chewy. Carobnation is very subdued, and overall it's very smooth and almost too easy to drink. Awesome."
"Recieved from brandoman63 from the brews-n-tunes summer '07 tour. Served slightly chilled in a pint glass from a twelve ounce bottle. Poured a deep copper orange , almost brown color. A thick, tight, two finger off-white head formed with a rather easy pour. Awesome nose on this one, very bitter hop aroma, grapefruit, pine, pineapple, with a nice balancing malt aroma to it. Taste was more of the same. Piney hops, mild citrus fruit notes, and somewhat grainy. Very well balanced in my opinion, mild carbonation, and some well hidden alcohol. Mouthfeel was full bodied, thick, and pleasant. Drinkability was great. An easy beer to sit down and enjoy."
"Got in a care package from my now favorite brother-in-law along with Dreadnaught and Expedition Stout. Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating system. Was a hazy copper color with a few bits of yeast floating in there. Had a decent head that settled to a thin film with good lacing. The smell was very hoppy and citric (either grapefruit or tangering). Really had more of a IPA smell than an APA as mentioned in other reviews. Definitely set the table for what to expect. The taste was also really good and more along an IPA than APA line. Good hops, good citric but had a slightly too bitter finish for me. Overall, an excellent beer and recommend trying. (4, RB, T, Y)"
"Personally, I think dreadnaught kicks this one's ass in taste. This is still a very nice and refreshing pale ale though."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. This beer poured a hazy, dark amber/copper color with a minimal tan head that faded slowly, leaving a bit of light lace. The aroma is something to behold. It consisted of grapefruit, peach, and roasted malt. Just a beautiful, big citrus/floral hop experience. The flavor is more of the same. Nice hop bitterness, balanced out by the roasted malts and some citrus sweetness. The beer has minimal carbonation with a medium to full-body. It doesnt get much better than this. A must try from Three Floyds!"
"Pours a somewhat murky burnt copper with a very generous two fingered off white head that takes a good while to die down to a nice lacing. Stickiness is very good, stays all over. Smell has alot of grapefuit, pine, and floral aromas in the nose. Extremely crisp odor. Flavor is so balanced. Starts off with the grapefruit then the pale malt comes through and blances it out so well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. So clean in the mouth. Drinkability is amazing, this is a pale ale? I'm thinking more like an IPA but who cares about labels, this beer is amazing."
"D - This truly is an outstanding tasting APA. I was surprised at the lackluster appearance, but maybe that was a fluke."
"4 / 4 / 4 / 4 / 4.5"
"Overall: Come on its 3 Floyds you know it has to be great. What I like about this beer is it pushes the edge for IPA's. It has enough hops to push it on the verge of a DIPA without going too far. The taste is wonderful and they go down sooo smootly. I proclaim this beer sessionable and great!"
"Great drinkability here, but like most pale ales in my diet these days, a couple in a row may be the max."
"Quite decent. I could enjoy 2-3 of these before the taste buds need a break from being worked so hard. I look forward to trying the $17 bottles one day, but for now this will do just fine."
"Unfortunately for Alpha King I drank this right after I had my first Bell's Two Hearted. It's very difficult to go from a tremendous IPA like that to a Pale Ale. Since I love the hops, I was disappointed in the taste of Alpha King. In retrospect, It was probably much better than I realized and actually stood up well for being an APA. As far as pale ales go, this should be a solid offering. But why drink Pale Ales when you can drink IPA's?"
"Bright and refreshing, but retaining some nice body, with natural carbonation. A great pairing with fish or chicken on the grill this summer. Another success from the fine folks at Three Floyd's."
"This beer is really good...I wish I had another..."
"D: To me, this is just about as close to perfection as you can get in an APA. Perfectly balance between smell, taste, and mouthfeel. An absolute joy to drink. This is so good it should be illegal."
"The best part of the FFF label is the little map! Alpha King appears rusty copper, a thin cap of foam quickly dwindles to nothing. No lacing. Smell is floral hops and some sugary malts. A very subtle blend. Taste is a spicy hop blast. Some piney ether as well. Just enough sweetness to temper the hops. A touch of full sweetness gets cleaned up by a great full hop blast. Extremely drinkable, refreshing even."
"Born on date- who the hell knows? Pours out a cloudy copper with minimal head - some soapy lacing. Smell is nothing to write home about- some fading hops. Taste- quite spritzy which surprised me given the lack of head. Grassy hops with a soapy aftertaste. Malt is solid- tobacco and solid caramel flavours. Its quite tasty, but doesn't blow me away. Maybe its the age- I can't imagine I have a bottle at its peak of freshness. First time trying, so I risked the purchase in my excitement not knowing its age. The hops are there, just in weird muted kind of way. given the rep of FFF, I was expecting more. Truthfully, pass the SNPA, as this pale ale doesn't match the benchmark classic american pale that is Sierra Nevada. I would love a chance to try fresh on tap or bottle. Until they date these suckers, I can't cut any slack."
"D- I think it is very tasty. Hops come through very nice but it doesn't totally cut out the malt body."
"Overall a great APA that is almost sessionable."
"Bottle poured into a frosted pint glass, pours a nice pale orange in color with minimal head that leaves no lace on the glass, this could be brought on because the glass was cold as hell. Smell is wonderful citrus smelling with a nice grass and weed in there, reminds me of being in the mountains in spring time. Taste is very amazing with a nice light crip bitterness of weed, citrus fruits, maybe a not ripe honeybelle, simply awesome and a damn fine tasting pale ale. This is one fine offering and it gets better each and every time I drink one of these masterpieces."
"D- A nice quick session worthy beer. I would recommend this beer ever to non hop heads because I don't like hops for the sake of hops but I enjoyed this beer a lot."
"overall this is a very nice beer that i enjoyed very much"
"Another thanks goes to czoch75 for a sixer that was included in a trade."
"man, i loved this via bottle but on-tap this shit is even better. deep orange amber in color with slightly more clarity than the bottled version, the freshness from drinking it at the 3f pub took this over the top for me. even via bottle this has a thick, creamy off-white head that cannot be denied, leaving globs of lacing even after the beer is gone. citrusy hops dominate the nose with nice, rich, bready malts mixed in. subtle floral and pine notes as well, along with some caramel and honey. nice amount of sweetness at the front and with plenty of hop bitterness clearing it out leading to a long, complex, crisp/bitter finish. medium in body, this beer just leaves you wanting more and more. almost drinks like a dipa but at 6% you can have several of these. this is a must-try beer. if you ever have the misfortune of being in munster go get this stuff fresh. and when you're done, inhale the bouqet left behind-an absolute grapefruit bomb remains in the bottom of the glass."
"Final Statement - This is Hop Bomb!! There should be a warning on the label, not for the faint of heart. It's a delicious APA suitable for hop heads such as myself. I'd love to have regular access to this one."
"This beer lives up to the hype. I would be happy to have this one as a regular drinker."
"Alpha King Pale Ale was an orange-amber in color with a nice off-white head. The head had good retention and left quite a bit lacing behind. The aroma was all about the hops, fresh and fruity citrus hops just begging to be tasted. The taste was also very hoppy and delicious with a good malt base to keep some balance. The bitterness was not as intense as you would expect with all of the hops. The finish was dry and bitter. It was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was excellent. It's one of the best pale ales that I've tried and I highly recommend it."
"I have been waiting to try this for a while. I broke down and ordered a sixer from Archer Liquors in Chicago. Very cool looking bottle with the king himself featured on the front. The beer poured a dark orange with a very good head. The smell was so amazing. fresh hops permeated my nose and reminded me of grass, herbs, and flowers. The taste matched up very nicely with hops really shining through. Wow, believe the hype! I think this was better than dreadnaught. This probably ties with Deschutes Hop Trip for my favorite Pale Ale. Outstanding."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light to medium bodied. Very drinkable. I could drink a number of these with ease. Overall, it's a great beer. It actually seems more like an IPA than a typical APA. Either way, it's a fantastic beer. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Silky smooth on the palate this beer easily flows down the throat. Alpha King is medium bodied and feels great on the palate. This beer is something I would most definitely buy again, that is if I can ever find it again. One of the best and most unique APAs I've ever had."
"Feels a bit thin for an IPA, which is why this is a PA. Good drinking. Wish I had another (cool label)"
"Drank from an AleSmith pint glass. Poured a dark amberish color with a thick and rocky tan head. Looked fairly translucent with some suspended particles. Great smells of citrus and grapefruit. Light pineyness as well. Smells refreshing and very clean. Bready malt smell thrown in too. Bittering hop up front along with a caramel and bready taste. This is an excellent drinker. Mouthfeel on lighter side and bubbly. Head retained until the end of the glass. Finished with just enough bitterness. Drinkability is great with this one and I only wish I could find it local for $9 a sixer like some people."
"Pours a cloudy deep amber into a pint glass. Big 2 finger head that is quite luxurious and creamy. The head has staying power, too and leaves some insane lacing. The nose is heavy on pine, some grapefruit, and slight flowery note. Very balanced flavor - hops up front/malt on the back & some definite citrus in between; really nice. Mouthfeel is nearly perfect for this style - well carbonated, refreshing and a little on a creamy side. This is an easy drinkin' all night beer - I could easily have another and another 5 after that. Highly recommended."
"The body is an almost caramel color, or reddish brown, with a white head that dissipates to create a cover just slightly over the top of the beer leaving decent lacing. The aroma is full of citrus hops and a rather large malt sweetness which is basically a non-descript fruity flavor. The taste follows the aroma nicely. Big citrus hops flavor with a fruity malt backbone. The beer had a medium body that gives way to a long dry finish. Very nice beer to drink could be a little thinner for the style giving it a more refreshing hot day beer character."
"Overall a very tasty and well-balanced brew. I wish I could buy it here in Michigan. Its not intensely bitter, but the hops are very prominent. This beer definately blurs the line between a pale ale and an IPA."
"Very murky amber colored body with a white head that stood for a while.There were flooties in the beer,im assuming they where yeast.Citrusy hop smell,Hops,this is a hoppy tasting beer but there is somthing blocking the hops it seems.Like there shielded.Slick mouthful and very easy going down.Good beer but lacing somthing.I thought it would have been more but it just lacks something.Good though.I will have again."
"Drinkability: The ale is quite drinkable and, in my mind, a restrained version of Dreadnaught."
"A fantastically hopped American Pale Ale, with the smooth mouthfeel to make it sessionable."
"12oz. bottle poured a dark hazy amber color with very little head and just a few specks of lace. Smells mostly of citrusy hops. The taste is a blast of fresh bitter hops up front then is followed by a bit of yeast and malts towards the end. The feel is light to medium and has a little stickiness to it. This brew is pretty easy to drink and I'm glad I tried it but I'm not much of a fan of the extra yeast they put in the bottle."
"D: Tasty and easy drinking. I think that i prefer this on draft, but either way, this makes a great session brew."
"In all honesty, I drank two bottles of this beer during the course of the review because it is just that good."
"I really hope this bottle is an outlier and that a typical bottle of this isn't as flat as mine, because it brings down an otherwise tasty beer. I would seek this one out again. All beers deserve a second chance."
"D- Love it. My only qualm was the lack of quaffability of it. I really hate to buy into hype. But damn it, this is good stuff. Highly recommended."
"D: This is beer is very easy to drink. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has been my go-to beer for yaers, but this one is less bitter and has a much more complex and soothing flavor. Too bad I'll probably never see this beer on tap in California, let alone matching the overwhelming availability of SNPA."
"Good Job Three Floyds!!!! Now please bring it to MIssouri so I can help out the environment by not driving to Illinois to purchase this beer."
"D: A muscular in your face hoppy pale ale. If I didn't know what I was drinking I would say it was an IPA. That being said it grew on me. I'll get it again when I am back in Ohio - too bad 3F does not get out to Massachusetts."
"Very good ale overall, definately one of my favorites!"
"exceptional beer drink one if you can get your hands on it"
"Bottom line, this pale rocks if you love hops. I think it's more of an IPA than a pale but I love it in spite of that. I know for a fact I would buy this alll the time if I could."
"Poured a cloudy burnt amber, with no real large head. What was there faded quickly but left a film of gooey, drippy lace skimming on the top, lots of eddys and swirls rounding about on it. Deep dripping lace down the glass, and a bit of a bubble stream coming up from the bottom. Smell was big and strong. Big citrus players here, lots of orange and grapefruit. Very sweet smell, like orange sherbert or candy. Very nice and plesing to the nose, smells like it will be a winner. Taste struck me as odd, after all the sugary itrus in the smell, none really came through in the taste. There was a strong bitter hop presence, providing lots of IBU's however it was more of a pine,resiney type of hops, rather then the sweet candy orange that came through at first. Nice and crisp, clean, very dry and long lingering finish, leaving a taste of burntor raosted pine for several minutes after a sip. Goes down very smooth and clean, not overally carbonated, and not syrupy either. A nice IPA, and a good call from Three Floyds."
"M&D - smooth and highly palatable with a manageable bitterness, nice mouthcoat and easy down carbonation, all in all a great APA, probably one of, if not the best i've had to date"
"D - Very fine APA, with interesting herbal/spicy notes in the taste. Not the best I've had but it is very good."
"thick, cloudy orange-brown color with a big head and lots of sticky lacing. smells like fruit preserves, orange juice, hops, herbs, caramel. tastes like herbal tea, natural fruit juices -- cherry, orange, grapefruit, peach...; tons of hops, but they're nicely blended with bread and malt flavors. this is complex, which is something i don't normally associate with the style. robust in the mouth, but very smooth, and very refreshing. this could be guzzled by the gallon, the only obstacle being the abv."
"Drinkability: Near perfect and that's all there is to it."
"And it don't taste too bad neither. Hoppy as hell, but if you didn't know that, then you didn't look up ""alpha acids"" on wikipedia before you bought this beer and you're getting what you deserve. It tastes like citrus, grass, and mounds of bittering hops. Yes, it's another American-style hop bomb, but Three Floyds has taken a single-minded style and just nailed it completely. The mouthfeel is crisp, with a strong carbonation that complements the hop profile. It's crisp and refreshing, and I could see myself knocking back a bunch of these. Hell, I just did."
"Poured into a flute. Amber with orange and red hues. Large head rose and fell slowly. Small bubbled head fell and left lacing on the sides. I smell oranges and grapefruits. Definate ""c" hops. Same taste as aroma hits you, then leaves a grapefruit hop bitterness as an aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good and bubbly with a dry finish. A clean drink that you could have more than one of..."
"D: This is one extremely clean and refreshing brew. Drinkability is off the charts. A session beer for hopheads and a regular in my refrigerator. Highly Recommended."
"Drinkability is good, easy to savor a few of these."
"Cheers!"
"This is a highly sessionable beer which doesn't get old after drinking a few."
"d - this is superb. i could drink this beer all night long. if there is a better APA out there i haven't had it and they've really done something if it's better than the alpha king. this alpha king is the alpha male of APAs."
"Pours amber orange with a small light tan head that fades fairly quickly. A film of lace when agitated, fades to a lingering washed pattern. A dominant citrus hop aroma with an underlying earthiness. Creamy while hopped, with a nice amount of carbonation that adds to a very satisfying complexity. Tastes somewhere between an IPA and a Pale Ale. Enjoyed it. Thanks JH!"
"Poured to a hazy reddish-orange with thin off-white hhead that lingered well and left good lacing along the glass. Nice strong aroma of grapefruit citrus, with a hint of grassy hops. Taste followed along the citrus vein. A tangy mouthfeel led to a dry bitter finish, much more like an IPA than an APA. A most enjoyable beer!!"
"Highly recommended."
"Decent mouthfeel. A nice sessionable beer. MMM."
"This is my favorite beer of all time possibly but this is certainly not my favorite bottle of this beer I've ever had. The hops didn't present themselves as much as they usually do and the beer drank a little flat, possibly an old bottle."
"My sense is the other BA's that tasted & reviewed this must know a thing or two. Just a great rendition of an APA!"
"This is one of the best beers I have ever tasted! Thanks dogfooddog!"
"D: Went down easy. The bitter finish doesn't linger too long, and makes you want more. Overall, very nice."
"This beer is a slightly murky orange with a thin head and not much lacing. But the smell is hop heaven. Sweet hop aroma fills the air. Cirtus hints are present as well. This beer is what I think a hopped up beer should be. Sweet, bitter but not harsh. Just nice and smooth to make a very drinkable brew. Mouthfeel is silky smooth. The drinkability is high. In fact, the beer is gone before the this reveiw is even finished. I could certainly go for more of this beer. Off to add it to my wants."
"Dark amber color and a thin but sturdy white foam cap. Big floral, fruity nose...citrus, caramel malts, and more floral alcohol esters. Really nice dry hop character, not too spicy, sprucey, juicy citrus notes of orange and grapefruit rind, and all balanced with sticky diacetyl. Sweetness varies between hard candy and honey. Medium body and a full mouthfeel that ends dry, bitter froth. The finish is bitter, some grapefruit twang and spicy hops. Extremely juicy and aggressive hop characters might push this beyond its style a little but its still very tasty and an easy drinker."
"Medium bodied and very smooth. Refreshing hoppy and flavor. Just fantastic."
"Maximum respect to czoch75 for throwing this special surprise into our recent trade. 12 ounce bottle, no best before date. Tawny amber-gold with a moderately-sized, creamy, just off-white head and undying sheets of lacing. A lovely hyperactive citrus aroma greets my nose, with tangerine, grapefruit, and bergamot predominating. There is also a distinct scent to the bouquet that is not at all unlike high-grade cannabis, all sticky and resinous. Exceptional aroma for me, if only due to the affective evocations it elicits. Big pine and citrus flavors with a crystal malt sweetness in the very back. Bitterness is the dominant characteristic of the taste, but it's not rough (so I'm guessing no Chinooks in this one). Lip-smacking, but not for the faint of heart, at least as regards hoppiness. Fairly light in body; there's a stickiness to the mouthfeel that borders on syrupy but doesn't quite get there. The floral character of this beer is making me pine for spring and summer. What a treat it must be to have this available year-round to pick up before a summer barbeque. Many thanks, Clint."
"Low on carbonation, almost like an English bitter with a creamy mouthfeel perfect for all-night consumption. God, I love this beer. One of my favorite sessions with a taste that keeps on giving."
"D - Awesome! I could drink these regularly."
"This beer poured a clear copper color with a thin head that dissipated quickly. The smell is very hoppy  and has a fresh cut grass type aroma. The taste is bitter and very hoppy with just enough malt to counter the hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly creamy. If you are in a mood for hops, this would be highly drinkable. I love pale ales, but can usually only drink one or two before it gets too bitter. Id have to say, this is the best one Ive had the pleasure of tasting."
"This is an excellent APA, a contender for my favorite of the style. It seems to have a sweeter malt character than some, and more hop flavor than others. In perspective, I think it's somewhere between a Burning River and a Sierra Nevada, but closer to a Burning River (two beers I enjoy very much)."
"I really enjoyed it. Sessionable if you are into hops. Great balance. Easy to see why it scores well. This one falls into the category of expectations met. Not sure I would call it a Pale Ale, though...."
"I could drink a few of these...I should say, I would really enjoy having a few of these."
"Bottled sample from trevorwideman via demcorhip. Medium amber in colour with a bit of haze. Slightly below average carbonation for the style. Dominant pine needle aroma, with some background notes of sweet citrus, both sweet and toasted malts, and even a bit of yeastiness. In the mouth, there is more pine, but more reminiscent of the wood itself as opposed to the fragrant needles. The citrus notes become more distinctive and remind me of tangerine, mandarin orange, and grapefruit. The hop flavors are substantial, but their sharpness is blunted by the equally assertive malt presence. The bitterness is about on par with the style, which is somewhat of a disappointment considering the name of the beer. Overall, this is a very well executed beer, but not the mind blowing, mouth-puckering experience I was hoping for. Something a little dryer and a little more bitter with the same amount of complexity would have garnered a higher rating from me."
"Drinkability/notes: Superbly well-made, but quite biased toward the hops, hop-heads will surely be delighted, for everyone else, it may be a bit much."
"A very drinkable beer. I will buy this again if it is available too me. I had to go out of my way to get this and I am not disappointed. A great beer."
"D - Definitely drinkable, but a little heavy for the style."
"In all, this beer would rate as one of the best Pale Ales that I've ever tried. The folks at 3 Floyds are amazing and I can't wait to try Dreadnaught someday. Thanks Chris for this one!"
"Wish I had more than one, oh well..."
"Mild, extremely fine carbonation from the bottle conditioning gives a lush mouthfeel. Liquid velvet. Perilously drinkable. Amazingly this is probably my third favorite of the regular FFF line-up, but that speaks to the quality of Pride & Joy and Robert the Bruce rather than to any problems with this beer. Top notch stuff."
"D: Very nice beer, excellent flavors and balance - one that you could drink several of..."
"Slightly cloudy off-orange in color. Decent tiny tan head that maintains superior retention. Near sugary lines of patching will retain until the sunlight of tomorrow is upon us. The nose is largely citrus hops, a sinus cleansing dose; pine cones and grapefruit, crossing the IPA side here! Bold and bigare the hops, citrus and piney in flavor. To get technical, my seasoned taste buds can quickly pick up on the centennial and cascade hop offerings; warrior hops, hmm. Massive flavor of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice and orange peels. There is a moderate caramel malt backbone, yet it is certainly second fiddle to the three letter h word. Full bodied and loaded with flavor. The best APA on the market, search for it, find it, secure it. World class! A liquid-hops-induced delight!"
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with no freshness date. Pours a nice reddish-orange color, with a small, off-white head. Very good retention. Sweet and hoppy aroma, smells like a cross between an IPA and a Scottish Ale. Piney hops, touch of caramel. Excellent aroma of toasted barley that comes out as the beer warms to room temperature. Taste is dominated by the hops, but the barley balances it nicely. Good, creamy mouthfeel. Very easily drinkable beer. This is my first time trying a Three Floyd's offering, and I will definitely sample more."
"Another East Coast beer that I have tried that would lend itself well to sessions. Not over the top, just well done. A nice beer, thanks for the opportunity MuenchenerKindl."
"Pours a peached copper/amber with a bumpy almond head that retains very well and leaves thick sheets of lacing. Smells primarily of juniper and grapefruit. There is some toasted grain in the background along with malt sweetness. Pretty much the same lines in terms of flavor, although I never expected the hop flavors to be this pronounced and bitter. There's a slight nuttiness to the malt as well. Mouthfeel is incredibly soft and of sturdy body. If I had more than one of these, I could drink them all night."
"12 oz bottle poured dark copper with a small off white head that fell pretty quickly. Dark for a pale ale. The smell is all hops...grapefruit and pine, but more citrus. A small amount of malt comes through, but the smell is definitely about the hops. The first sip yeilds a very balanced hop punch and nice malt. The hops are predominate in this brew and are very citrusy. This is a bit over the top to be classified as a pale ale, this is definitely a very nice American IPA. As the grapefruit flavor dies down, a nice doughy malt flavor comes through and then ends with a nice bitter. Mouthfeel of this beer is medium and nicely carbonated. I will have to say this is another great beer by 3 Floyds and I would drink it very regularly if it was available locally. This beer tastes like the Dreadnaughts little brother. Excellent beer but I think it is mis-catagorized as an APA."
"Taste is just wow. It's times like this that I'm most thankful for my sense of taste. Enormous hop presence, grapefruit, orange, licorice, herbs with a lovely light caramel/honey backbone and some toasted malts. Bitterness is pleasant and not overbearing, that said, it's still a hophead beer, the balance definitely leans towards the juicy hops. Sticky and a little oily in the mouth with a dry finish that goes on forever. This is absolutely the hoppiest APA I've ever had, and it's welcome. I'm feeling a very lucky man to be drinking this right now, it's like an elixir to cure all my ills."
"6% means you should limit yourself but the flavor says ""gimme one more please""."
"Very drinkable. Tasty and pretty well balanced, the hop profile is nice and pronounced, if I had better access to this beer it would be a regular in my fridge."
"not too strong not too weak, hoppy bitterness is there which i absolutely love...it isnt sticky but this stuff is great i could drink it all night....3 floyds is the shit...wow....this stuff is probably the best pale ale ive ever tried... there was sediment in the bottom of my mug for f**k sake....i apologize for my language on this one i just want people to know i am serious about this review...the color is beautiful....this will be my main from now on i reckon ....I love it ..its too good i will drink too much of it tonight im sure...GREAT JOB FFF"
"The mouth begins somewhat velvety, then moves into the dry hoppy bitterness undercut by lemony notes and peppery spices. I could drink this all night, by itself or with almost any entree. A damn fine ale fo sho."
"Drinkability is high with the thinness of the beer. Also, if one attacks this as an IPA, it's a little bit more mellow than some others. An interesting beer."
"D: An excellent beer, well-crafted. Three Floyds deserves their reputation, and it's even better that they are located in my parents' hometown."
"Bow down to the King of Kings."
"Ryph"
"Long live the King! This is assertively hopped, well balanced and highly drinkable. I will visit the kingdom again, soon."
"A masterful pale ale. Seems more like an IPA to me since the hops are quite more powerful than the malt character. An excellent interpretation of the style, though. A must have pale ale, especially for hops lovers!"
"Overall a very nice APA. Although not my favorite style, this was indeed a quality brew and was an enjoyable beer. Recommended."
"D - If you're ready to tackle some bitter IPA's, this APA is a very good start; I started with American Pale Ales before I ventured into IPA country, and this was my last test before I made the switch. Probably the most drinkable and enjoyable APA I've had to date."
"-Oelergud"
"This will go down nicely all day long."
"This is a very drinkable hoppy beer, and would make a great session brew for a hophead. Would also make a decent introductory brew for those wanting to explore hoppier beers. Ill be drinking this one again."
"M&Dr - nicely carbonated and medium bodied with a crisp and clean finish. I could drink this all day and just wish more pale ales were like this. Heck, this beats out many IPA's!!! Get some if you can. This is the best pale ale i've ever had."
"Being a hophead, I love this one. I would not recommend this to the average Bud or Corona drinker, they would not be happy. I do recommend this awesome beer to my friends, I love this one. I have yet to find anything Three Floyd's brews I don't like. They and I seem to share the love of hops and this is by far a great hoppy beer. Highly recommended for the hophead"
"Highly drinkable, this is one of my ""go-to"" beers."
" It's medium bodied with medium/high carbonation and very drinkable. I guess it's labeled an American Pale Ale because it uses American grown barley and hops but it's very similar in character to a traditional IPA and a very good one."
"Dark copper color, off-white head that fades quickly. Smells of pine and citrus hops, maybe a vegetal aroma... some bitterness, like dark leafy greens. Big hop taste, spruce, lemons, nice kick to it. Mouthfeel is thicker than I expected it to me, cloying and sticky. (which is nice in some respects, but I was looking for a medium pale ale, this strikes me as a lot bigger than I was looking for."
"Mouthfeel nice as well. I drank this straight, but I'd love to pair it with a good pizza. Very drinkable as well. The more I drank this beer, the smoother it got."
"355 ml. bottle. Hazy orange. Upon first sense of aroma I thought this was an India Pale Ale. This is highly hopped. If Im not wrong the Warror hop has high amounts of alpha acids and the Centennial is lower. But this is where is must get part of its name, yes? Bottle conditioned. Finely crafted. More on the grassy side than citrusy side for me. Nice long lasting bittering finish. No sweetness here. I thought pale ales would try more of a balance between sweet and bitter...this is all hops...Im not complaining, but why is this not in an (American) India Pale Ale style? Very good beer though."
"I just recently noticed I hadn't reviewed AK yet. I drank it all summer and it was love at first sip. One of my favorite beers. Straddles the line between a Pale Ale and an IPA, which is just fine for me. FFF's trademark beer is certainly a great one."
"This beer tastes more like an IPA than an APA to me, but who cares, it tastes great and that's what counts, right? Whatever style this beer is, it manages to be balanced and (very) drinkable without skimping at all on the hops."
"Over all: this is a good beer from a great brewery not my favorite of their brews, but a damn good one."
"D: Excellent, I could drink these all night."
"A dark honey body, crystal clear, with a long-lasting, sturdy head. A pretty beer. The smell is grapefruit with a strong malty bakground. Taste is intense on the aroma hops. Loads of citrus, but well balanced with sweet malt. The mouthfeel is a little thicker than I expected. Drinkability is really good. A well-balanced beer, but a bit chewier than I expected."
"Worlds of difference from the fresh version. Although I probably won't be buying this again, I am happy with my inadvertant experiment, and look forward to the rest of the bottles."
"Drinkability: Couldn't drink it all night, but wouldn't mind having a couple in a session."
"This tremendous beer pours a golden-red hazy color with a minimal head. The smell is huge and almost hits you in the face. Not over is it loaded with hops, buy there are many sweet notes almost like bubble gum in there. The taste is also huge. Very chewy with the amount of hops, but also little special additions of sweetness along with the hops. When its swallowed, the first 3 seconds have mostly a malty taste, then the hops take over and command the rest. These two tastes are surprisingly well balanced for such a big beer. A great beer thats worthy of every bit of praise given to it on this site."
"A bold copper color and complete clarity stand out on the pour. An average amount of tight, off-white foam that falls away quickly but retains a bit of lace. The first note in the nose is a hoppy bite, but it rests atop a caramely malt base. Even more strongly hopped in the taste, though again the malt base waits patiently underneath and asserts itself more noticeably as your palate adjusts to the hops. A nice mouthfeel that balances between clean and oily. While this more resembles an IPA than a pale, I'm not complaining."
"Awesome beer - I drank three the first night properly and slammed three on the golf course and I think they would be just as tasty and satisfying in any situation."
"A very drinkable apa that will be enjoyed at a soon to be session near you!!"
"The mouth is pleasantly oily and a bit thick. Drinkabity is very nice. Session beer all the way. My favorite of the 3Fs regulars."
"Poured a hazy amber into a pint glass, smells of citrus like many others have stated. Man does this stuff taste great. A nice slap of hops, floral aromas and malts. The hoppy aftertaste comes back for another round. Wow! There is no point in rambling any further. If you like APAs - GET SOME! Simply delicious. This is the best beer I have ever had."
"Smooth-ish, kind of dry with a hoppy/yeasty aftertaste and a hint of malt. Decent hop note with out overpowering this medium bodied offering. A very good beer, too bad they don't sell in FL, I had to drive this home. Well, what else was I gonna do on vacation?"
"Served in a pint glass, the Alpha King pours a hazy amber/orange color, with around a half inch or so off-white head. The main aroma I get from this is citrusy hops (grapefruit), with a little spicyness too. It tastes hoppy with citrus being the main flavor, and with a bit of caramel sweetness in there too. There's a bitter finish/aftertaste, but it wasn't as strong as I expected (not that I'm complaining). The mouthfeel is kinda slick, with medium body. It's a pretty drinkable beer. Overall it's pretty good, you can't go wrong with this!"
"Drinkability: Just keep it coming"
"Really enjoyed this one. If you're lucky enough to be somewhere where you can get this stuff, I'd definatly recomend picking up a six pack."
"D - Very drinkable. This is a very tasty APA, more of a slight IPA flavor to me. Totally different than a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Glad I got a chance to try some."
"Drinkability: Great pale ale, though the fruitiness is more reminiscent of an IPA than it is an APA (which I tend to think have heavier malts). Nonetheless, this is a fairly unique flavor that displayed a lot more balance than I thought I'd find in a FFF pale ale. Refreshing and sessionable brew."
"How do I catergorize the flavor of this beer? Seems unbelievable that this is an American Pale Ale, but my first thought is how good this spicey, hoppy beer would be with pizza. Upfront spicey hoppiness with a warming, subdued aftertaste. The spiciness wasn't as prevalent with the second sip, which hinted at various citrus juices. Later, a light maltiness barely peeks through. No alcohol to be found anywhere in the beer, and even at 6.0% ABV. I'm thinking about sessioning this one. A creaminess appears further into the glass. Alpha King is a medium bodied, hop bomb that is super drinkable. Believe the hype about this one."
"Dispholidus brought a six pack of this to work for our friday beer drinkin' time, and im glad he did. mmm. this is a good beer. Butterscotch colored beer with a little head but good lacing. Smells like oily hops and sweet malts. Tastes fan-frickin-tastic. Very, almost overthetop hoppy on the first sip but for the duration just a nice powerful hop flavor that is a great treat to drink. Some sweet malt and pine flavors, but its pretty much all about the hops. A fantastic bottle of beer."
"This is a well-made brew but not my style. I'm way more into FFF's Gumballhead, which I consider an IPA also (though it is wheat-based), and showcases Amarillo hop flavor beautifully."
"Drinkability -- This is the first beer I've rated all 5s and I now declare it the official beer of my summer. I plan to drink a lot of it. I've been drinking this beer off and on for several years now, but this is the first time I rated it. This beer delivers what few others do. It's just excellent."
"This one has gone over the wall a la Bitter Woman From Hell, but it's packing more balance. Crazy, but tolerably so. This goes in the pile with the hoppiest beers of which I would not mind having two."
"Pours a deep amber bronze with surprisly good clarity given the sediment. One finger of soapy but dense head shows good retention and leaves spotty lacing. The scent of citrus here is collosal; more like fresh squeezed oranges rather than the rind. Some faint pale malt aroma lingers somewhere in obscurity. Toasted crystal malt and vienna upfront. Semi-dry aftertaste, herbal/citrusy cascade does an excellent job of balancing the sweetness. Low carbonation and medium body allow a hint of slickness, but it's really just enough to keep the mouthfeel less than crisp. Cascade and caramel flavors meld perfectly in the finish, which is a nice medium of dry to slick. Highly quaffable."
"Drinkability is very high as this beer is better balanced that most of it's peers. Prost MK"
"Pours a crystal clear light caramel color. Off white plumes of bubbly head is formed, tracing impecable. After transfering my IIPA to secondary and getting a good whiff of cascade and centennial hops, this beer comes off as a hop tea, the aroma as fresh as those hops. A little sweetness is also detected in the aroma, but American hops dominate. Flavor starts out sweet with the hop flavor dominating. Lots of complexity in hop and malt flavor swirls around the mouth ending in a stab of bitterness. This beer is almost too perfect in the realm of APAs or IPAs whatever you want to call it. I've yet to experience one like it, but I hope I can make one damn close."
"Pours amber and orange in color with a cream colored head. Aroma is outstanding, smells of a hint of grassiness, sweet vitamin C citrus, red grapefruit, and sweet peaches. Complex taste of sweet oranges up front, quickly followed with bitter grapefruit,a little biscuity and then a dry slightly peppery finish. Mouthfeel is also very good, crisp and clean with a nice mild dryness in the finish. Definitely pushes the envelope of the Pale Ale style category in a very good way. I could very easily continue to drink more and more of this beer, and I probably will."
"Poured an awesome tawny, sunset orange with a slow moving head - took a second to start up then (like bread in an over) slowly raised to the perfect spot, and just leveled off and would keep for the tasting. A very nice semi-clouded shade. Thorough lacing too. Explosive aromatics. One of the most full bouquets I've encountered with any style. And lively too, quite vibrant. Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth, drinkability is at a super high level. A polished mouthfeel leaves the flavour almost undetectable for a second, then you can feel the hops come back and coat your mouth. A great deal of citrus character. Different hops come out but the malt is blended in well enough it keeps this beer level without interfering with the hops. In other words, this taste and smells (and well overall, just plain IS) ultra hoppy - but it doesn't feel like it! Immense job with their flagship beer. A big, huge thanks to HogTownHarry!"
"This is one damn good beer. Smooth, well-balanced and highly drinkable. This wasn't my first and surely won't be my last. I've got a case I just picked up at the brewery and I'll be stretching that out until the next visit. Nice work, 3F!"
"this is a great, hoppy american pale ale for sure. very solid, tasty, and luscious brew. could session it but it's complex and packs enough hop-power to sip and savor 1 at a time."
"Even with the strong hop flavor, this beer is very drinkable. The hop bitterness is not overpowering. This is a fantastic pale ale / IPA."
"M&D: Relatively light-bodied and pretty well carbonated. Goes down pretty easy, but not one I would session."
"I'd heard rave reviews over Alpha King for a long time, but since they don't distribute here, I couldn't locate a sample to try. Closest I came was another Three Floyd's brew, Pride and Joy, which I panned due to style, not due to quality. When I finally located bottles of this in Vienna, Virginia, I snagged a couple to bring home and try. I'm very glad I did. This is an outstanding beer."
"Overall, a solid, very drinkable, very enjoyable beer. However, I still can't figure out why this is classified as a pale ale and not an IPA."
"Not available in Minnesota but is in Wisconsin and Iowa, this is a really hoppy pale ale. It's a hop-head's dream and easy to session. Recommended!"
"Bottom line: wow. Believe the hype. It's that good."
"The perfect beer to cap off a fine father's day."
"Slàinte!"
"This is one hop bomb of a PA, but still maintains its drinkability. An absolutely fantastic pale, and one I expect will be a regular in my fridge."
"At 6% sessioning this might be a bit short-lived, but it is a very enjoyable hoppy beer, typical of the quality I have found in 3 floyds' products."
"Cheers!"
"Man, this is good sh*t. One of the most hoppy, aggressive pale ales I've had. Another one of those beers I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed already."
"Nice carbonation and nice hoppy aftertaste. Very high drinkability for this one. A solid session beer."
"All of their hopped beers are exceptional for my taste. Alpha King is not for the faint of heart. This is a hop lovers dream with a citrus punch and a strong bitter finish that pleasantly stays with you. Highly recommended for those who like unique ales."
"D - This is an excellent APA, but it is too drying for extremely good drinkability. It has an good flavor and a fantastic aroma though. Basically, it has too much flavor to be as drinkable as some other APAs."
"This will be a regular drink for me, it's great."
"Very piney hops, with a clean carbonated spicey mouthfeel. Lush flower, resiny as hell, somewhat of a sweet malt finish, not as much citrus in the mouth as the nose but it is there. Very complex, very balanced, unbelievably drinkable."
"Quite drinkable. I will buy again."
"One finger buttermilk/off white head with moderate carbonation, earthy straw color. Nose primarily citrus (lemon) and yeastiness, with the hops surprisingly subdued. Fresh, carbonated presence on the tongue with citrus and malt up front, hops bringing up the rear with residual bitterness in the aftertaste. Surprisingly hoppy considering the lack of same in the aroma. Pretty strong hop taste, probably edging closer to an IPA. Good all around balance. Overall, an excellent American pale. A good medium choice between the weaker hops of a typical APA and the overwhelming (to some) hop bitterness of an IPA, making an ideal session beer."
"Now that I'm finding places in WI to get 3 Floydss, I think i'm going on a 3 Floyds addiction. I mean, if this is their pale ale, what is Dreadnaught IPA going to be like? I grinning with anticipation. Very nice beer, very impressed with 3 Floyds."
"D: Um yeah, it was a decent beer. But the ratings its receiving are not worthy IMO."
"A fine Pale Ale with good flavor. Take home a 6 pack, it'll be worth it."
"Drank from a 12oz bottle. It's been a while since I tried this, I forgot how hoppy it is. Smells and tastes like citrucy hops. I don't know what an APA is supposed to be, but it must be close to an IPA. Whichever type this is, it's an easy-drinking session beer."
"Thank you MABZ for yet another great beer."
"Hop-tastic! This is a really in your face hop experience but it doesnt exceed any boundaries of decency. In fact, if pushes those boundaries nicely."
"This beer has a regular spot on my shelf, and I always smile when I see a full bottle waiting for me."
"The highly-regarded Alpha King pours beautifully, with a hazy, reddish amber and a two finger head. This is a very tasty beer. There is a rough, brash bitterness from the hops, but it is balanced by a nice malt sweetness. Interestingly, the fruitiness is more of oranges than grapefruits. While it is balanced, the abrasiveness of the hops hurts drinkabilty just a bit."
"My first Three Floyds experience was the Alpha King pale ale, and it was clear at once that this beer was truly not normal. Nice appearance, but the smell totally grabbed my attention. One of the hoppiest, citrus, floral, spicy powerful aromas ever. The taste is also very hoppy with a finish that was almost too bitter for me. This is why I think it's not as drinkable as it could be, it's a bit strong for a pale ale and the bitterness is so extreme that I don't think I could handle a session of these. A great beer, though, that I highly recommed."
"A pale ale that nearly borders on being an IPA, but balances its hoppiness with a fruit punch complexity. Good mouthfeel for the style, and definitely sessionable. I think I found my favorite pale ale."
"What a beer. A buddy shipped these to me and man the hype is to be believed it's some great stuff."
"Very good APA."
"Notes: If you pass this up on the shelves at your local beer store... you are crazy. Simply one of the best pale ale's ever made."
"M & D: Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very high on this offering from 3 Floyds. Slick but smooth mouthfeel allows you to have a bunch of these. The hop complexion makes this a very enticing ale to drink. Sessionable? Yes! Love this one--my new favorite pale ale."
"I personally think that this is right on the border between pale ale and IPA. It's bitter enough to be an IPA, but has the alcohol of a pale ale. Quite enjoyable either way, and would make a relatively nice session beer... if you drink it a bit slow."
"I can (and do) drink this beer all day."
"Superb. A pale ale that doesn't impress with intense sourness or a huge ABV. Nice to experience such a good balance and depth of flavors and especially smells, along with high drinkability. Only bought a single, now wish I would've gotten a sixer (or hell, a whole case)."
"This beer was incredible. Poured into a pint glass, an amber color with a small head that forms and laces very nicely. Several aromas come through from citrusy, floral, and earthy scents, with a slight scent of malt. The taste is amazing, very well balanced. It starts with some malt and barley flavors, then the hops begin to announce themselves midway to the end of each taste. The mouthfeel has the consistancy of skim milk, watery, but it does have some body to the texture. Overall, this beer is incredibly drinkable, great taste, wonderful aroma. This beer surpasses one of my favorite beers in this style in SNPA."
"Awesome, awesome brew here. Only problem is, it is a little unbalanced. But hoppier than hell. If you are a hophead, this is the brew for you. Decently priced, a little malty on the front end, with a kickass hoppiness at the end. Best APA I've ever had."
"A quality beer, no doubt about it. Three Floyds should be very proud of this beer."
"Pours a dark copper color with a nice off-white head leaving lacing all the way down the glass. Starts off citrusy in the nose, but then hits you with a floral bouquet that seems never ending and always changing. I also noticed grapefruit as others have mentioned, there is also a slight maltiness in the nose, but hardly noticeable. On to the taste, the grapefruit taste came in strong, slight caramel for a second, but finishes with a lemon zest, a hint of pine is present throughout entire taste. Medium bodied and average carbonation level, pretty slick. Just a flat out good beer here, one of my favorites to keep around. Use caution with this one, once having one of these, you will not be able to taste much else in a beer until the following day."
"This is the best Pale Ale I have ever tried, by far. Its not as bitter or pungent as some IPAs, but the sheer depth and delicousness of the hop profie make this beer feel huge. One of my favorite beers ever. If only this was readily available in Ontario."
"Drinkability - I could easily sit here and finish a whole six pack myself and savor, and I mean savor each and every sip, in just one sitting, absolutely no problem. Also, I could just sip and chill with this, or serve this with any kind of meal, event, etc. I just plain love this ale !!"
"D: Great beer. Very nicely balanced. A great alternative for someone who is craving hops but also craving balance."
"D - very, very tasty brew. Very nice on a warm spring day. Refreshing hop content livens up your tastebuds."
"My thanks to Bditty 187!!!"
"Pours a super clear orange color, maybe light amber. About a one finger thick white head forms, and disappears quickly. Tons of sticky lacing around the glass. Beautiful hop aroma, with lots floral, citusy and piney smells too boot. Reminds me of softer version of Dreadnaught. Maybe Dreadnaught ""light"". Big hop taste up front with some malty backbone, not overly bitter, just right. An medium bodied brew, thats easy too drink. WIth a low abv a definite session brew that can be enjoyed all night long. Another winner from Three Floyds, and once again my only disappointment, is that its not sold here in Michigan. Bring me some Three Floyds dammit!!!"
"D - A nice, somewhat well rounded APA with extra hop intensity for all you hopheads. Alcohol not in taste at all, making this beer a great session choice or a fine meal pairing."
"Drinkability - very light and airy. I drank 3 during dinner and didn't realize it until the end (when the 6 ABV kicked in)."
"I am, however, a little confused with this beer. It tastes very similar to Pride and Joy Mild and I wonder if it wasn't mislabeled. I bought a 6'er of P&J and found 2 Alpha King bottles in it. I figured someone had just pulled a switcharoo with a couple bottles from an Alpha King 6'er. Whatever, this is good beer."
"overall, a great beer. i'm only half way through the bottle and i find myself wishing i had another. definitely recommended."
"Overall I was not dissappointed. I never know what to expect when trying a new APA. I normally go in with expectations and typically come out dissappointed. This was definitely not the case with this beer."
"This beer nails it. Crisp grapefruit tartness and smoothness are outstanding. Very floral aroma and balanced pallet make this beer the best Pale Ale I've had (yet...)"
"This is not a Alpaha King in my book, while hoppy it is for the malt and mouthfeel that I enojy this beer, a lot. Looks a crazy shade of red with a quickly receding white head that gives little lacing. Smells of a great malty red that has been nicely dosed with low-coho hops, giving a citrus and piney aroma. The mouthfeel is full and it allows the terrific malt profile to outshine the hops that give a nice balance to this beer. This truly rocked for my, so much so that I had two, with a list of 60+ beers in front of me."
"Thanks for picking this one up Dave!"
"Citrusy hop aroma, but it is muted. Copper/tea colored with a finger thick white head. very quaffable. Nothing revolutionary here just a good malt base followed by ample hopping that leaves a mildly sweet malty beer that finishes citrusy and grapefruit bitter. Very solid if you like lots of hops."
"Verdict- The sole purpose of this beer is to serve as a hop delivery system. The strength of the hops might rub some drinkers the wrong way. I appreciated it, though."
"on another note, shouldn't this be under IPA? how does something labeled Alpha King not make it into the IPA category?"
"I really enjoyed the luscious aroma or orange/tropical hops and sweet malt. The flavor couldn't match the same balance but it was drinkable nonetheless. The fruitiness reminded me of Fruity Pebbles cereal, oddly. It's a very unique pale ale, and I was glad to get a chance to try it..."
"Quite good, quite good. For a regular pale ale, this is ridiculously hoppy. It's hoppier than some IPA's I've tried. I would prefer the hop flavor to be more citrusy than piney, but it was still good. Recommended for hop-lovers."
"awesome amber color. there is a great citrus hop to the taste and smell. great fruit esters. built like an american pale should be built. taste is very crisp, not too much carbonation. man i love the citrusy/leafy/piney taste to this. a very sessionable beer from well known american micro brew. wish this beer would make it down south. i could drink this bad boy daily"
"The beer bar I was at sold 12 oz. bottles of this for $4. Compared to the 22 oz. Gumballhead priced at $16, this was a steal! Seek it out and embrace it."
"Pretty darn drinkable, but THE best APA? We shall see..."
"Gorgerous copper brown color with a two finger head with good lacing. Huge oily hop notes. Plenty of lemony leafy hops. Very sweet citrus hop oil taste. A little hop balance. This beer is delightfully smooth and creamy. A textbook APA that I've heard lots about and certainly hasn't disappointed. Thanks to hero27 for this one."
"Served in an imperial pint glass. A nice, tight tanish-white head sits on top of a dark copper body. The head falls down to a small cap leaving good lace all the way down the glass. Piney, citrusy hops greet the nose. More juicy citrus hops with good malt backbone to support the hopload. The beer finishes full and long. A great beer and a good reason why its 3F's flagship beer."
"I was not sure I would like this brew. I had envisioned it as being undrinkable due to being excessively hoppy. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it. It pours a beautiful clear copper with a long lasting rocky off-white-head that left lots of clumpy lace. Aroma is in your face citrus, iodine and notes of pine with some faint swet caramel out there fighting to be noticed. Taste is desert dry with strong grapefruit and juniper obliterating the palate in an agressive but not unpleasing manner. Mouthfeel was just right with a hefty grain bill to match the dryness of this agressively hopped brew. Definitely an exceptional APA and well worth seeking out."
"12 oz Bottle Pours a hazy amber with an off white head. Head has good lacing. Aroma has a good mix. I pick up lemon citrus and a good prsence of what may be carmel or molasses malts. aste is excellent a clean well carbonated beer wit great flavors. The mix is perfect. Has a good bitter finish with a nice duration. This is one awesome pale ale. I would drink all of these I can get my hands on. If I see it, I am buying it."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is a red-hued clear amber color with a half-finger white head that slowly fell to light sticky lacing that slightly clings to the glass as I drink. Aroma is fresh citrus and floral hops, along with hints of sweet maltiness present, smells very fresh and clean. Taste is exceptionally balanced between the citrusy hops and the caramelly sweet hops that stand out in this brew, just enough fresh hop oils/ hop resins to create a nice appreciative bitterness that is kept in check by the sweet malt. Tastes great overall, very refreshing and drinkable. Mouthfeel is slick with a moderate body. Perfect level of carbonation, would definitely seek out again."
"D: This beer is certainly drinkable. It’s tasty and not-to-filling. I enjoyed this beer a great deal. Beers have roles in which they fit. I think the role for this beer, for me is to throw back a sixer (or more) while watching a wrestling PPV on a Sunday night."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability, borderline very good. Bitter, but not so much as to leave me turned away. Will absolutely buy again, when I am in one of my not quite as common hoppy moods."
"not very exciting in my book; seems to lose itself in the c-hop pale ale parade. yeah, it's OK but i've got no real reason to seek this out"
"Highly recommended, and I plan to get a bunch of this when I go back."
"This brilliant little number shows a lovely amber colour. A well mannered head came forth from a delicate pour and crashed into a soapy film. Positive for lace. This beer is so clean. I can see my fingers on the other side with sharp clarity. I can even see the dirt under my fingernails. Just gorgeous. The nose is far from exaggerated. It is a very tasteful and well controlled array of luscious malt sweetness and a mild but nonetheless, dare I say, dazzling hop bouquet. Great citrus notes and nice herbal impressions. The taste shows wonderful synergy betwixt green and grain. The sweetness slides in and swirls into a fruity citrus notion. Everything seems to be lightly expressed with the sum total of flavours leading into complexity. One may find a very subdued grapefruit as a subtle hint, or vague orange inflections, or muted grass and pine. The possibilities are many and intriguing with a refreshingly dry finish that begs the thought of orange peel bitterness and a lemon squeeze. All of these culminating while adrift in the well scaled structure of the malt profile. The body is model. Light but full enough to please the palate and float the myriad flavours. This beer is so graceful and even tempered. Balance exemplified. An abslolute pleasure to imbibe!"
"Overall, this is a beer I'd love to have again; it's insanely tasty and drinkable. However (like so many other great beers), I'll have to leave Nebraska to do so..."
"Brought back a bottle from my trip to Madison, WI"
"I feel this beer is a perfectly acceptable example of an American Pale Ale and Three Floyds deserves the praise and recognition they recieve for this beer. I will drink this again."
"Overall, a great and very drinkable American Pale Ale and definitely the first one I would recommend to someone interested in trying out the style. A great APA, in my mind, should also be a good session beer and this one certainly is...just be careful with the alcohol % as it can sneak up on you."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and one of the best APA's."
"Either way, I was shocked to see this in the liquor store down the road, having no idea this was distributed in NJ. When I went to the liquor store to get a few bags of ice for a NYE party and came back with ice plus a 6 pack of this and a Dogfish Head Raison that I had run out of, I was forced to go with the explanation that this is the top ranked APA and I couldn't pass it up. While dubious, the wife understood. In any event, the high ranking is well warranted and I'm damn glad I got this beer."
"Quite a hoppy brew but it is so smooth that you almost wonder if you really are drinking something milder. Very subtle and easy to drink beer that will satisfy the hophead and the Macro drinker equally well."
"Definately recommended, but not sure if its worthy of its rating at the best APA."
"[Thanks to IrishRedRock for sending this westward in a trade...]"
"Drinkability: Let's just say I can understand why this beer is considered their flagship beer. Keep up the good work 3 Floyds!"
"This pale ale poured a clear, coppery color with creamy, light tan foam. The smell was dominated by hops! But there was a touch of caramel malt in the nose as well. The taste was bitter hops and some citrusy hops balanced by a good maltiness. The finish was dominated by the hops (both bitter and citrus). The mouthfeel wad dry and hoppy with medium body and modest carbonation feel. The dry malt flavor and the hoppiness lingered in the finish. This was a very nice, American pale ale, and the high ABV is hidden well."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass from the bottle, I received a near perfect pour. An orangish amber body with an off-white two-fingered head. A wonderful aroma of citrusy hops with a hint of pine (can someone please market this aroma as an air freshener?). The hop flavor just coats the tongue and lingers there for awhile. It is strong, but not overpowering. If not for the high ABV, this could be a nice session beer because it isn't heavy and it is very drinkable."
"This beer poured a clear amber with a decent size slight off white head. The smell is dominated bye the hops but there is a decent amount of malt coming through. The hops were citrus and the malt was bready. I thought I smelt chocolate but my wife said I was insane. Slight bitter taste at first then the malt washes this away, then a slight bitter taste is left on the tongue. This beer is refreshing, the low carbonation and medium mouthfeel usually don't support this but it did here. Very good beer."
"This is an excellent beer that I would never pass up if I saw some in front of me. It's on par with the Bell's Two Hearted ale, which in my opinion really puts it in the category of IPA, albeit on the milder side of American IPAs."
"This is easily the best pale ale Ive tasted since having tried the American pale ale examples produced by Legend and Sierra Nevada. As many other BAs have observed, it certainly is a lot hoppier than your typical American pale ale, but, as most of those BAs have also pointed out, who cares, its fantastic!! Highly recommended"
"Copper color with an off white sticky head but who cares how it looks with that awesome smell. All citrus hops. Probably out of the range of a APA and more like an IPA but so what, it's a great beer. Taste shows more of the hops bitterness but there is plenty of malt to balance it out. Dry finish for this full bodied beer. Very drinkable beer, my wife and I flew through a case of this. Would recommend for any hop head out there but my guess is that you've already had it."
"D: So easy. The sweetness really makes this an easy to drink pale ale. It is just perfect. The hope are prevelent, but not overwhelming to the point where I only want one or two."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is full bodied. Nice carbonation helps the brew slide down. This is one of my favorites."
"This brew suffers on the drinkability. Not so much the high alcohol, but the one-dimensional taste. An interesting take on an American Pale Ale, not the classic advertised on the bottle but quite tasty. Still, more like an IPA or DIPA, and after one I'm ready for something else."
"Poured a copper orange colour with a big foamy head. Lots of lacing in the glass. Citrus and floral hop aroma. Flavour is full and bold, almost approaching an IPA. Slightly bitter and dry finish. Higher alcohol is only slightly noticeable. Very drinkable beer, particulary with a meal."
"The lacing could be a bit better, but everything else about this brew makes up for it. It's a lot to take in, even down to it's strong finish, and unlike any Pale Ale I've ever had. Floral notes can also be detected in it's taste, and it's not as buttery as the runner up from northern California is. That being said, this beer is unique, bold, and was worth all of the hype and advance word of mouth. Three Floyds could change the name of this brew to just ""King"" - I am certain that few, if any, would beg to differ..."
"Nicely done."
"so drinkable that 3Floyd's can't make enough of it. 7.35% alchohol isn't believable if not for warmth and adding to your good mood after finding this. dry APA with a hop backbone that shows in every characteristic of this stuff, can't get enough of it lately. session king."
"This beer pours a nice dark amber, with a nice white lace that sticks to the side of the glass. The smell is citrus, hops, and lemons and flavored with a sweetness of honey and the faintest hint of vanilla. The taste is great, it has a nice bitter kick from the hops as well as some great lemon flavor that is brought out by the honey. The mouthfeel on the palate is very clean. Great beer overall glad I was able to get my hands on this beer, I will def go back to it again."
"The taste was truly exceptional, and got even better as the beer warmed a tad. It tasted lovely; pine and citrus hops yet balanced perfectly by malts. It tasted surprisingly pale, the darker color is truly deceiving. The freshness and drinkability was ultimately the crown jewel of this beer. Its so rich, balanced and flavorful; truly is as good as everyone says it is on BA."
" -cheers2beers-"
"A quite tasty APA. I have waited for a long time for this and it did not disappoint. Just saw this is 7.35%ABV??? Wow. Never would have guessed."
"Overall- an excellent beer on tap. Much better than its bottle conterpart. A definite for Pale Ale fans!!"
"I feel lucky to have 6 of these beers and not surprised that it is ranked so high in BA. Three Floyds should be a who's who in breweries and be just as well known as Don King himself."
"this is the mother *** of all pale ales."
"It pours a hazy amber body and despite being poured straight, it doesn't make such a big head. What is there is there to stay though and never leaves until the last sip. The smell is deep hops, especially citrus cascade, a great sniff for sure. In mouth, you receive the same treatment, tasty malt balanced with loads of hops bring you to a piney bitter aftertaste, but not before passing through a flower field where grapefruits fall from the sky. In my opinion, this would have won a lot from a thicker body, it was thin to medium and a little lacking to support such intensity (or I had too full-bodied beers recently). On the other hand, while it was one of the most tasty, it was also one of the most drinkable APAs I've had. Thanks Egajdzis!"
"I could surely drink this one again and it is defintely up there in my top IPAs. If you like IPAs try this one."
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a small white foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of strong bitter hops with some floral malt. Taste is mostly overpowered by hops with some caramel malt. Im not sure I get what is suppose to be so great about this beer, seems to me that it lack balance. Will give this another try though."
"This beer tastes better than it smells and it smells really good. Hop flavor throughout but not overwhelming. Each sip and I wanted to drink more. One of the few times I don't mind living in PA because I had to purchase an entire case of this and I'm thrilled I did."
"Pours a dark clear amber with a short finger of white head with decent retention. Nose is big and hoppy, the bitter floral variety, some citrus, and sweet malts. Taste starts off with a sharp bitter hop bite and transitions nicely into tropical fruits and caramel malts Alcohol is mildly present. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, though a little on the thin side. This is a tasty APA. Didn't wow me, but a solid bitter hopped pale ale."
"Poured into a pint glass and had a nice copper-reddish color. Was amazed at the head retention. Actually thought I saw it getting thicker in the glass. Superb appearance. Had a flowery, grassy smell too it, very earthy. As expected, the hops dominate the taste, but it is very well balanced. Thgouth the flavor changed somewhat as the beer breathed in the glass. A very refreshing beer."
"I could easily knock back a few in a row. In fact, I have...."
"D - Goes down nice and easy. Could easily knock this sixer down. Probably a bad idea though since I'm going out later."
"This just might be the best APA Ive ever had. If its not, its darn close."
"I like this beer, I bought a sixer of it, and glad I did. This beer though did remind me alot of Bell's Two Hearted with a little more body, to any fans of that I'd reccomend them Alpha King."
"This beer doesn't hit perfection in any category, yet it's so close. Its flaws are almost negligible and has been one of my favorite beers for years."
"For me, this beverage represents a balanced diet."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink. I had several in one sitting and enjoyed the very last sip. This beer can be overpowering with mild dishes. Should go well with spicy dishes."
"I enjoyed three of these with no problem during Notre Dame's big win over the Pitt Panthers last night so I may be bit biased. Great looking copper colored Pale Ale with average head and lots of carbonation. Smells of floral hops and citrus, with a hint of alcohol. Superb style that fizzes in the mouth and is very easy to consume. One of the top Pale Ales I've had."
"Hop heaven!! I once described this as grapefruit and beer mixed together to a friend, and he was startled to agree. The citrus hop note is unmistakable. The perfect malt note to balance the citrus. If you can find this fresh, it's spectacular. I can't seem to find a fresh 6 pack anywhere. Grapefruit and pine dominate. Mouthfeel is wonderful; smooth and creamy. Three Floyds can't make a bad beer. Buy anything they make, you can't go wrong."
"Poured an orange color with a small, off white head, that left nice lacing on the glass. Citrusy hop aroma, as well as a bitter hop flavor, with some grape taste as well. Very nice malt backbone as well. This can be drank more frequently than Dreadnaught."
"Re-review: Since this beer is listed as a APA, I say it is the best possible APA. I rated it before assuming it was an IPA"
"A hearty pale ale no doubt. I've had plenty of IPAs that can't hold their weight against this surly boy. Balsy & bold. What else would you expect from 3Fs?"
"A tasty brew nevertheless."
"Bottle conditioned APA. Pours hazy orange color - creamy medium dense head recedes into thin bubbly white sheet. Smell is fresh: citrus and fruity hops, light sweet malts. Taste is fantastic: big hops yet very well balanced with sweet malts...nice and smooth. Crisp and rich with a dry hop finish. This is a great IPA (it IS an IPA isn't it?), it should definately please the hop-heads. Very tasty indeed...too bad its so hard to find in the NE (available in RI though). Excellent."
"poured a deep copper color with respectable head. Smell is very hoppy, also noted is citrus with lemon domibating. Taste is hoppy, hoppy, hoppy. There is also found some sweet malty notes that mox well with the hops. Finish is dry and bitter, but moderated some by the malt. An excellent all around beer."
"A truly wonderful, if slightly overdone, version of the style. A delicious beer worthy of an afternoon of drinking. You'd be trashed if you did, though!"
"This is definitely more of an IPA than a PA. Great pleasant and satisfying hops. I could drink this constantly."
"Drinkability: I had heard good things about this beer, and being a hophead I knew I would like this. But you fellow BAs know your stuff. This was a truly impressive brew. Very easy drinking, despite the higher alcohol (which was hidden well). Im glad I followed the advice of this community and sought it out (thanks hero27 for a great trade), Id definitely recommend this to a hop-hunter. The first Three Floyds offering I have tried, but I hope to remedy that soon."
"taste is a huge citrus hit with big flavors of grapefruit and orange with those caramel malts making an appearance in the middle. It has a great creamy mouthfeel to it yet finishes crisp and slightly dry leaving a slight hop bitterness but not overwhelming at all. This brew is masterfully blended with great flavors."
"overall: this is another one of those beers where even though it gets good ratings, i still believe it deserves even higher. near perfect for this style. a little hoppy for an apa, so i couldn't give a five there, but that's what i love so screw the ratings! get yourself a lot of these if you're able!"
"Very clear coppery red topped by cream coloured foam. The head was a bit on the thin side, but it stayed around throughout and left some decent lace on the glass. Intense citrus hop aroma, but still soft like low alpha hops were used for finishing. Also a bit grassy with moderate maltiness that doesn't hang around for long. High bitterness, again soft from the use of lower alpha acid hops, with lots of citrus and floral character. Low malt sweetness. Very dry, hoppy finish with plenty of citrus. Medium body and moderate carbonation with a soft, smooth texture. Very tasty beer with a lot of hop character that isn't overpowering. Highly drinkable and something I'd love to find on tap. Thanks Viggo."
"Reviewed at Charlie's Ale House in Munster, Indiana on 8/4/05. Pours a brilliant deep copper color with a medium size white head, compact. Nose screams hops, yeah, Northwestern Hops, yeah again. The flavor is dry and malty, and is dominated by the hops just waiting to attack. Finish is full of hops, the beer is full of hops, this is good stuff."
"Overall a great Pale Ale bordering on a great IPA. Seek this one out and enjoy."
"Pours a blood red color with a creamy white head. The aroma is strong and citrusy. Utterly mouth watering. The taste is very hoppy for an APA, not good, none the less. It starts out sweet and finishes hoppy. The aftertaste of this beer is excellent. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, a very good over the top APA."
"Overall, I could drink this all day long! Refreshing, tasty, and just enough alcohol that helps make this ale truly special. I now know what all the hype was about!"
"A little too high on the abv to be considered very drinkable but plenty smooth though. They do a good job of hiding the alcohol actually as this doesnt taste real strong (abv-wise that is)."
"Pours a cloudy orangish brown with a quarter inch of head that thins to a trace. It smells of hops and citrusy aromas. Taste is very bitter, but has an average citrusy APA taste to it with mild malt flavors. Mouthfeel is a little acidic and is highly carbonated. It leaves a very bitter after taste in your mouth that seems to last forever. I found this brew to be a little to bitter for an APA, but a big hop lover would most likely enjoy this one."
"Poured from bottle a deep amber color with 1/2 inch head. Smells of citrus and floral hops. A slight hint of malt till the hops kick in. Tastes almost like an IPA with the big hop flavor. Very Nice! Has a medium body and goes down smooth. The hoppiest of the APA's I've tried yet. An awesome beer that I plan to go back to many times in the future."
"Wish that this was sold this in my area. I had to order it from John's Grocery In Iowa City. I have a feeling that I will be ordering more of this in the future. The more I sip it, the better it gets. Wish I could get other Three Floyds brews after this one."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick, smooth, almost creamy. By far the best APA I have ever had, and this is number three for the evening. The hops never overwhelm, just perform. Awesome color, cling-for-dear-life lacing, super drinkability... FFF has wowed my ass. Great job, this is a must-stock always."
"An excellent pale ale."
"Drinkability- I actually felt some of the alcohol kick in at the end of the brew. Not sure if I could session more than a couple of these. But, an amazing hoppy pale ale that I would buy again in a second if I could get my hands on it out here. Hands down one of the top two or three Pale Ales I've had. Maybe the best."
"Mmmm...one of those really big tasty american ales, i'd have thought this would be an ipa"
"A very fine beer available at a reasonable price, especially compared to some other Three Floyd's offerings. If this is going to be considerd and APA, its my favorite of the style."
"Excellent drinkability and a fine beer me thinks."
"Appearance is a clear mahogany with a nice one finger tan colored head and some great lacing. Smell really jumps out at you. Sweet sweet oranges alongside some bready malt. It never ceases to amaze me how powerful that first whiff is. No detectable alcohol. And now to taste. Ahhh, the creamy smoothness is the first thing you notice. Perfect carbonation and body. All the citrus fruits in the world are there, with the orange flavor really standing out next to a little bit of grapefruit and lemon. The malt adds some balance to this brew as a nice bready bisuity aspect, though it is definitely hoppier than your average pale ale. As others have said, it almost crosses the line into an IPA, but the hops in no way overpower the malt in this beer. The finish is extraordinary. Hops all the way, though it's not too bitter. I could drink this all night. In fact, I might just do that now. In case you couldn't tell, this is my favorite APA."
"With a a rich, gold color, ample lacing, and a full, vaguely creamy mouthfeel, this hop monster is as pretty as it is potent. Hops hit you the second the beer taps your tongue, and they leave their joyful mark in a linger aftertaste. Although this is a definite hop monster, it's reasonably smooth and has a tinge of sweetness. There are hints in the beer I didn't like, perhaps something about the yeast. There was an imbalance in this beer that spoke of lack of control. I had an entire six pack during the past week, and I reacted to each bottle differently. Is it me, or the beer? I think it's the beer, because I had several cans of Dale's Pale Ale during the same period, and they were consistent."
"If you love hops this is a great one to try."
"Drinkability is great if you like a hoppy ale. At over 7% ABV not too many of these could be had. But the crisp mouthfeel and balanced flavor make this one which could be enjoyed in multiples."
"[Mislabeled. With this big body, slightly elavated alcohol, and big hoppage, this is definitely an IPA and should be compared on that level. To have this listed as a pale ale is unfair to the real versions of the style.]"
"It has a nice medium body and the alternating hops and malts are perfectly done. I could drink this all day...if I had more than one bottle that is."
"Finger licking good."
"Simply put: A hophead's dream. One of the best PAs you'll ever come across, heck--it's one of the best beers your going to come across."
"Great beer. Pours into the glass and leaves a nice tan head, which remains for the entire beer. A beautiful copper colored ale with a little bit of cloudiness from the yeast from the bottom of the bottle. A few small bubbles make their way up, not overly carbonated. Smells like pine and citrus, and slightly sweet, maybe like caramel. The taste is outstanding, finding a nice balance between hops and malts. Hints of grapefruit at first with a nice, earthy aftertaste. A pleasant hop flavor lingers long after swallowing. Leaves a nice, slightly slick feeling in the back of the mouth. This is a fantastic APA which seems to find a hop/malt harmony that can satisfy hop-heads and non-hop-heads alike."
"Pours a dark reddish amber with a finger of white head and moderate amount of lacing. Nose is a strong burst fresh resinous piney hops, maybe some grapefruit in there as well, wonderful. Taste is a nice juicy grapefruit and ctirus hoppiness, almost hoppy enough to call this an IPA, but definitely more flavor than bitterness from the hops. A smooth creamy malt flavor perfectly balances any hops, leaving this as an immensely drinkable beer, even for non-hopheads. This beer is absolutely delicious, I don't know if you can find a tastier APA out there."
"Designed and created with love and respect, this product is absolutely phenomenal."
"I can see myself enjoying more than my fair share of these treats on a hot summer day."
"D- This is a very subdued beer with a big hops flavor. It can compete with the hop monsters but still make a nice session beer. Very impressive."
"Worth a trip to the brewery to taste these beers as Nick Floyd and his associates intended them."
"Amber and cloudy in color with a thick copper colored head. Stinks of hops and has a lot of apricot and lime flavor to it. It doesnt have so much body to it but is a great tasting brew. Very easy to drink. The finish is very mild and floral, and disapates quickly. Im very impressed with the Alpha King. This is the first of Three Floyds that i have and i look forward to trying more."
"overall- great beer here. When i read the reviews out how hoppy this was, i knew i would enjoy it. Even with the knowlage of this it still struck me suprised as to how much hop flavor and bitterness this beer has. Great beer for those of us who enjoy hops. If you dont, its still worth a try."
"Go out and buy some of this now. This beer is delicious."
"Pale Ale? Try hoppy IPA. The hops put other PA's to shame. This is one of my fav's, but I don't want to stock it all the time because the artwork on the bottle is a little frightening. If you can get past that, it's one fine PA....probably the best. Typical PA color and head on the pour, but right away you can detect the hops in the nose. Taste is complex and incredible. Good balance of malt and hops at first, then the hops kick in in the finish and you get that citrusy sensation that comes with the stronger IPA's....in fact, close to a Double IPA. Buy this one if you see it!!!"
"The beer pours a hazy dark gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a solid malt aroma that boasts of pale, carapils, and crystal malts along with an intensely bitter citrus hop scent; very nice. The taste is great as well. It has a rich and smooth malty flavor that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It also has a very bitter hop taste that goes down easy and finishes hoppy. This is a good tasting beer. It is full of hops, but also well balanced. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It is a tremendous drinker. This has got to be one of the all time greats."
"Up next - Robert the Bruce..."
"Drinkability  This is a light, easy-drinking APA that I thought could have used a bit more depth."
"Damned I love this beer. Many pints on tap at the Yardhouse in Glenview last week. Colour is dark red brown with a nice white tan head that leaves good lacing. The smell is amazing, bitter and lots of floral piney hoppy aroma. Taste is citrusy hops with a pronounced bitterness throughout but with a solid malt backbone to complement. Mouthfeel is smooth, perfect carbonation and perfect bitterness. I think this is a perfect pale ale, I could drink only this for the rest of my life and be happy."
"Notes: Great beer. An easy drinking IPA that shares some space in my fridge alongside other favorites like Two-Hearted and Red Seal. Buy a case."
"I regret I only picked up one of these, I could have easily drank them for hours. Top notch Pale Ale."
"This beer poured a clear dark copper color with red highlights. The head is light tan and about 1 finger tall. It disintegrated into a lacing film of tight bubbles on the surface. The smell is of serious hops. It also smells a bit fruity. The taste is mild up front then the hops take over. The finish is dry and bitter, which just leaves you wanting another sip. The mouthfeel is very good. It isn't too weak and watery, but it's not thick and sticky either. The drinkability is good, I am always in the mood for an Alpha King, just not a lot in a row."
"Drinkability: Very interesting beer with a big malt bill and plenty of hops, this is not for the faint-hearted"
"A copper/amber colored beer with a slight haze. Small creamy beige head, with a good lace. There is a strong hop boquet with both spicey notes and citrusy notes. The hops in the flavor are quite assertive but not overpowering. There also seems to be a hint of smokey malt in the background."
"Label stated bottle conditioned, but I couldnt find any sediment, and the pour was fairly clear, not hazy. Nit picking, had two bottles, ready for more!"
"This one is pretty much spot on in terms of having a vibrant carbonated mouthfeel to it and is quite drinkable overall. This is a very nice (and very bold in its use of hops) Pale Ale from the Three Floyds folks."
"Pours out a deep copper with a beige head with lots of little bubbles rising to the top. The head is quite large and thick, and when settled looks like a mess of cobwebbing everywhere on the sides of my glass! Smells like resiny pine, grapefruit, and gumballs! I can smell it across the room! Really, this beer has some sort of candy-like smell and taste due to Three Floyds malts. They give a somewhat sweet caramel like taste which nicely compliments this very hoppy pale ale. Definitely NOT normal! By far the hoppiest pale ale (which isn't very pale either) I've had to date. Mouthfeel is fine, very good actually. I can hardly believe this beer is 7.35% abv because it is so drinkable. Why the heck didn't I pick up another six pack of this beer sooner?"
"D - Extremely well crafted, although a touch acidic. I could definitely drink this all day on any spring or summer afternoon. Unfortunately, this perceived seasonality keeps it from the perfect drinkability rating."
"Oh yes, this is an immediate APA favorite. What a kick in the tongue. Huge props to the guys in Munster."
"Every few months, I just need to buy this beer. Pours a brilliant orange with a fluffy head that sticks around and laces the glass. The smell is sweet malt as the minimum characteristic, with the rest of the aroma being dominated by hops, bitter, strong citrus and some floral hops. When you first take a drink, you are once again given a pretty substantial taste of malt, but that is soon replaced by a rush of hop taste. Floral, citrus, bitter, some pine too. I can drink this beer really fast, and have spent a few nights in a stupor because I drink it too fast, and too many. All in all, probably my favorite beer."
"12 oz., bottle conditioned. Pours a reddish orange with a creamy, 1 finger, tan head that leaves decent lacing. Looks more like an amber or an IPA. Big citric/piney/leafy hop aroma with grapefruit, mandarin oranges, and a little bit of alcohol. The beer is fairly bitter and has notes of pine, grapefruits, oranges, and other tropical fruits. The malts are there, but they're overpowered by all the hops. It's somewhat thick, coats the mouth well, and is very drinkable. Delicious but not your typical pale ale - the flavors and appearance (and the ABV) resemble an IPA."
"Amber color and generous off-white head, some lacing. Aroma is very much an American hops extravaganza--extraordinary blend of citrus and pine. Flavor is on the big side for an APA, strong malt balanced with hop bitterness. Caramel and biscuits in the flavor as well. Finishes with an astringent bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with alcohol warmth and a bit of astringency. I'll have another. Wish it was available in OK."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all the time, but it'd be a sipping beer with food more than a session beer as it's pretty strong. Overall though it's a fantastic take on the style and one of my new favorite pale ales. Can't wait to try the rest of their offerings, if I can find them that is."
"This beer grew on me as I drank more. Neat bottle picture. It poured a very murky brown. Kind of surprising for a pale ale, but neat. Stained oak. The stain smell also came through the nose. The flavor was a nit tarnish at first. But after I let it breath the hops really started to come through. A full bouquet of flowers. The malts are slightly sweet, but balanced nicely with the hops. The mouthfeel is not crisp, quite heavy on the tongue, probably thanks to the hops and high ABV. I may hold off on a thrid or fourth one of these beers."
"Medium-full bodied, crisp and dry, a very good hoppy session APA. Thanks to Qarre for the sample."
"Great with beer can chicken."
"Backwash: I was amazed and thrilled when this showed up in my very average local store. I didnt even know it was coming to NJ. Im also hoping that this appears in draught at my local watering holes. Its been some time since Ive had this (I bought a case about 18 months ago at Shangys). Somehow, I remember those examples as being more pleasantly drinkable, with better balance, and a fuller flavor. Perhaps these are very fresh. Also, although the Bros. dont like this, I have to review this as an IPA rather than a Pale Ale. If I were honest, Id have to rate this low as a Pale Ale, as it really doesnt deliver those flavors. I noted at the time of my Ithaca Pale Ale review that it couldnt possibly compare to SNs Harvest and 3Fs Alpha King and I think that still stands. Still, this is fine beer that Im happy to have in NJ."
"Nice to revisit an old friend. Nicer still to learn that it has returned to NJ. Heartily recommended. Hail to the King."
"Last swigs: Clean pine resin and grapefruit thickness. Reminiscent of Avery IPA but this requires a paint stirrer to get moving."
"Freed from the bottle, this brew cascades into an intriguing reddish orange. Very hazy appearance with a decent head comprised of tightly knit bubbles. The nose is citrous with some fruit, as well as a slight floral quality. The taste is bold yet very refined. Although generously hopped, there is some good toasted malt to even things out. Some caramel and spice add their balance to the citrous explosion of hops. Slightly thicker mouthfeel than some other pale ales also helps to counter the sharp hops bite. The toasted malt flavor sticks around with the aftertaste, blending wonderfully with the hop oils in the finish. The most striking facet of this ale is the dance between hops and malt, without one dominating too much."
"I could enjoy this beer for an entire evening...one of the best I've tried to date in this, or any style."
"Pours out clear amber with a huge, rocky white head. A good deal of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a burst of fruity hops that smells amazing. Extremely fresh hop flavor, and plenty of it. I agree with one of the other reviewers of this beer who wrote that he tasted peach and mango. This is no mere hop bomb without the malt to back it up. There is a nice malty sweetness that complements the hop. No sign of the 7+% abv, as this goes down so easy. This is classified as a pale ale, but it's one the most unique beers I've had in recent memory. Having previously tried the Gumballhead and the Alpha Klaus, Three Floyds is quickly becoming one of my favorite American breweries."
"good beer, but a pain in the ass beer if you have to go through trading and shipping for it. bring on the gumballhead and dark lord por favor si vous plait."
"I remember the first time I has this beer. Instead of a case of Rhinelander, I started buying a bunch of craft and import singles. One booze fueled night, fate led me to 3F Alpha King. The only thing I remember from the actual taste is thinking they'd infused it with grapefruit. Thus was the beginning of my addiction to hops. At this point hopmarred beers are a dime a dozen, it is the rare one that actually balances it that rates high. This is not an extreme beer. It is just a really great IPA. Seek it out."
"Drinkability and Overall: The best APA I've had. No question about it. Many thanks to Patyoda for fiving me the chance to try this delicious brew."
"OK, so this isn't your typical Pale Ale. At over 7% with a big hop and malt profile that would make many IPA's look like a wee small beer, it's not what you see every day in this category. This puppy is balanced! Dark amber colored with a thin, bubbly head and a nice balance of juicy, citrusy hops and sweet malt in the nose. Flavor comes at you in layers, which makes this baby so interesting and complex. Starts rich and malty, with darker notes of fruit and dare I say, a bit of sweet chocolate? Then come the piney, grapefruit hop flavors, giving way to a dry, sweet malty finish. Wowzers. Balanced. Not a hop bomb, not the ""best tasting"" beer ever, but wow. An awesome beer. One I want to drink all night. This is there with HopDevil on drinkability, and I think due to the balance, actually surpasses it. Great stuff."
"Clear orange, lighly tan head, nice lacing anda few floaties. Fresh, and very fresh, fruity/hoppy aroma. Big hop flavors roll over some nice malts with a big hop bitter finish. The hops linger nicely. Very creamy mouth feel. Very drinkable and quenching. THis is a great session brew, and a welcome addition to my cellar!"
"On tap at Barley's Smokehouse. Definitely a nice surprise to find this on draught considering how much of a fan I am of the bottled version. Pours a dark amber color with thin chunks of a light beige head that disappeared quickly. Thin and quick lacing. The aroma has a nice bouquet of floral hops, grapefruit and malt. Medium-bodied with a mouthfeel that really cannot be improved upon. Robust hops flavor with citrus and a great malt balance. The finish is long and nicely bitter. I would never tire of this beer."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink is the understatement of the year. This can be found in my fridge year round, and is perfect on a hot summer day or just when you need a quick hop fix. One to be respected and definitely a treat for any beer lover. If you haven't tried it yet, track it down and do so ASAP. Still one my my all-time favs.."
"Easy driinking top notch pale ale that lives up to its reputation...."
"The taste was great, leaving a trace of hops bitterness eventually fading into a malty sweetness that beckons you back for more. I will definately buy more in the near future."
"Pours out a very deep coppery amber with a decent sized head of big bubbles that left a fair amount of lacing in my glass. Very hoppy aroma offset with some citrus notes. Hoppy flavor with a certain orange rind twang, although there's also some nice spice and grapefruit in there, too. Medium-bodied smoothness that goes down with the faintest malt notes before a hop aftertaste and bitterness kicks through. A very nice pale ale that I'm glad made an appearance on my living room tour of top American micro hop juices."
"cloudy dark copper color. a little hard to coax a good head out of this, but i got an adequate one. it quickly dissipates leaving some sticky lacing. ridiculously grapefruity piney hop aroma with a slightly spicy malt character. this taste is as excellent as i could have hoped for. it kicks you in the teeth witha boat load of fruity hops, that are then backed up by a light caramel slightly fruit malt flavor. really achieves a non ""hop water"" taste that many very hoppy beers have (not that i am not a fan of that sometimes too, but for a beer to achieve greatness it's needs some balance). fizzy medium sticky resinous body that really adds to the experience. a really excellent beer that i'm really glad i had a chance to pick up."
"Pours a pale bronze color with a light cream colored head. Good lacing. Piney, hoppy nose. What do you expect from a beer named ""Alpha King""? As hoppy as any IPA, and packs the same kind of punch. A bit of honey-like maltiness comes through, but the hops are more powerful and a dryness ensues in the finish. Some lingering grapefruit astringency in the aftertaste. A fine ale brewed for serious, hardcore hopheads. I had it on-tap a year ago, and it has been too long since I revisited..."
"I heard great things about this beer and was not disappointed. Probably an IPA rather than APA, but whatever the title this a great beer."
"I once had this beer on tap at the brewery and was not impressed. This bottle is way better. 3F, nice job at exploring the limits of IPA."
"This has always been a sure bet for me. Alpha King satisfies your no-nonsense hop cravings. The appearance is a nice copper orange with an average head. The lacing just stick to the glass and makes intricate patterns along the sides. The smell is like a fresh bag of hops. It really kicks you like a mule. The taste is just explosive with tartness and smooth bitterness. The alcohol content is well hidden by the hops, but it hits the cranium with no problem. If you were to belly up and drink this all night off the tapper, you would be floating higher than Nick Nolte. This is one kick ass pale ale!"
"A good looking amber, slight carbonation, with a head that disappeared quickly. Great citrusy hops greet the nose, stong and intruiging. Boy, what a fine APA. Citrusy hops with just the slightest touch of smokyness. Very smooth, medium bodied with typical hop oiliness. As you put it to your mouth, you get a nice whif of what you are about to get; hops. Easy drinking, good stuff. Not overly comlex, but good stuff. One to keep an eye out for."
"This came from the bottle a deep copper color. Very clear with a thick rich creamy head and bands of clingy lace down the side of the glass. Deep hop flower aroma, backed by pine and a delicate caramel malt aroma. The taste has all of the hop character, the flower, the pine along with a bright bitterness and a caramel malt backing. The bitterness lingers long after the drink. It has a good rich mouth feel slightly slick. Very drinkable. This competes well with the great west coast APAs. I wish this were available in Boston. Id order it above a Red Seal, or Speakeasy."
"Pours out a copper orange color with a thick, rocky off white head. The smell is moslty sweet malt with a floral hop aroma. The taste is very hoppy. A little too hoppy to say it is balanced but it does taste good. Citrous hop bite is really noticeable in the finish. A nice malt flavor is detectible through the strong hop flavor but barely. The mouthfeel is very thick and chewy. Quite nice. Very good tasting pale ale although probably just a touch too heavy on the hops for this style. Highly reccomended for IPA lovers."
"Dark honey colored with a thick and lumpy off-white head that rises up a full inch, and then slowly recedes, leaving thick oily lace around the top of the glass. Aroma is very inviting - citrusy hops and some light malt, some cinnamon and pear. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, very full. Taste is immediately hoppy upfront, citrusy and flowery at the same time, a little sweet, not overpowering. A solid malt backbone and some candy and toffee highlights ride along evenly with the hops. It all works together, nothing overpowers each other. This is great stuff, I could drink it for days. Thanks to BuckeyeNation for sharing."
"Wow, talk about one hopped up pale ale. This one does the trick. Very hoppy, yet still balanced with by the sweetness of the malts. For having a higher ABV this one could easily be a session brew for me. I believe I will be returning to the store to get some more of this asap"
"All I can say is Mmmm, I want another. Draft pour yeilds appropriate level of dense, white head with superior lacing throughout the beer. Mouthwatering aromas of sweet grapefruit hops with bright sprucey notes followed by light bready malts and apricot/nectarine sweetness. Taste is sublime...dominated by those grapefruit and resinous pine hops up front, and perfectly balanced by a pleasantly sweet, but very subtle malt back . Perfectly balanced with a medium body and perfect level of fizz. Alcohol level not evident till you have more than 1 or 2, which is very easy to do. This is an extraordinary beer, go find some, NOW!!!"
"On tap at Cole's 3.5 years later, a very good pale but not the best, aroma missing from bleached glass."
"*daniel"
" a great deal of hops throughout. The taste is grapefruit and nicely bitter in the aftertaste. A fine APA, I must say. Very refreshing and good for quenching the thirst."
"I have been to the tops of the pale ale mountain after drinking this beer! Looks nice and dark auburn with a creamy head. Good carbonation. Smell is hoppy and earthy with an acidic burn in the nose. Taste brings me those juicy citrus centennial hops. There must be cascade hops in here as well. But there's a sharp acidic bitterness in the finish which makes this beer nearly perfect. Alcohol is wonderful in its bite. Malt is not the strength here but definitely goes well with the hops. There a floral element in the flavor and maybe, just maybe a bit of nuttyness in the bottom. Great, great beer, I need to go get more!"
"This beer pours a golden amber color with head that just coats the beer. The nose is awesome. There is lots of grapefruit hops overlaying some mellow caramel tones and some orange peel tones. Nice nice and nice. The flavor is so nice. There is a great grapefruit hop, deliscious sweet orange caramel malt and a peppery and mellow hop finish. I really like this beer a lot. I like the Pride and Joy, but this is more my style. Sweet beer. The feel is moderate to thick...maybe a touch thin. Drinability is awesome on this one. I dig this beer a lot."
"Overall I find this is a very good American IPA and is at the upper limits for style in IBU's and ABV but does not go over the top in any aspect."
"Drinkability: Not difficult to drink, but not interesting enough to make me want another. Just because this brewery makes some real gems, doesn't mean that everything it makes is good, or even competent."
"Drinkibility: Does a decent job of hiding the alcohol."
"Clear, with a nice amber-gold color with orange highlights. The head is bubbly, large bubbles, but spawns a lot of Belgian lace and is very rocky (and off-white in color). The aroma is totally hops - wonderful - piney, floral, and a dash of citrus. The flavor is also dominated by hops, with a spicy bitterness reminescent of cinnamon, but a malty backbone exists to keep the beer from being terribly overbearing. However, it would be nice if there were more ""depth"" from the maltiness. (I can't think of a better way to describe it.) Overall nice mouthfeel and drinkability. This is great."
"mly enjoyable."
"Big, chewy malts up front; toffee, fruit, light brandy. Nicely balanced by equally big (if not bigger) hops. They enter midway through and swell into the finish with intense citrus (grapefruit) and pine sap flavors. Bitter and oily, with an almost cannabis resiny character. Big-bodied, chewy malts, and an appetizing, oily finish. A great pale ale, thats big enough to be most breweries IPA. Very drinkable as well."
"The Three Floyd's beers are fast converting me to being a hop head."
"On-Tap @ McGradys! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Ahem....Dark red with a small white head that dies quickly (old keg?). Aromas are of piney hops, hops, hops, hops, a bit of bready malts, and some alcohol. The taste is hoppy up front with a lovely malt flavor in the middle and a dry, piney, after taste. The mouthfeel is thick for an IPA and the drinkability is awesome. At 7.35%ABV this one is a true killer! Wow, what an awesome brew from FFF!"
"Taste is tangy and full of fruits in the mouth. Very sweet in the mouth, loaded with ruby red grapefruit juiciness--and followed by a grapefruit drying of the mouth. Medium and totally smooth body. Not the biggest IPA around (oh wait...it's NOT an IPA ;), but very much balanced with an intense, yet drinkable, flavor."
"Moutfeel and Drinkability are both great, and overall great Pale Ale."
"Wow. It's been too long since I've had this fantastic American Pale Ale. As I poured this beer into a straight-sided pint glass, the huge, piney hop aroma and wonderfully sustaining, lacy foam was the first thing I noticed about this beer. The first sip was full of juicy, sugary and caramel malt flavors laced with heaps of spicy, citrusy hops. The body is fairly thick, but doesn't keep me from taking larger sips. The alcohol does slow me down. I don't recall this beer being so strong. The lasting bitterness stay with you for a long time. The finish is not only quite bitter, but much drier than I remember. (I really like a dry finish.) All the complexities of this beer, the sugary, almost tropical fruit flavors that seem to meld with the citrusy hops and caramel malt are truly wonderful. When this beer is fresh the hops really shine through and almost steal the show. The remarkable complex hoppiness and maltiness of this beer make it really stand out on its own."
"Okay, I'm gonna throw this out: Alpha King may be mis-styled. This brew strikes closer to being an American IPA than a pale ale. The hops character is of such a higher order than the malt aspect as to smell and taste more like a U.S.-bred IPA than a pale ale, American or other. Not that I'm complaining; I love this brew. I've just had a number of IPA's that were similar to Alpha King and not very many pale ales. That said, if you can get the King, do so. If not, work your connections for a trade. Big thanks to qarre for the hook-up!"
"Anywho, on to the review. This brew pours a lovely golden oaky color with a medium-sized head. The smell is absolutely to die for, a sweet and complex aroma of hops, hops, hops! The taste is similarly divine, a sharp, spicy bite with the sweetness of a flower garden. It's a relatively intense experience, and probably not everyone enjoys this fine ale as much as I, but this is one brew I'll be coming back to over and over again."
"I'll qualify this by saying Pale Ales aren't my favorite type of brew, but I tried this one after alot of encouraging from my IPA friends and was pleasantly surprised! The taste was very interesting and hoppiness didn't overwhelm the fruit overtones. The aroma caught my interest immeadiately. The bitter finish was quite strong which I know is typical, but not to my liking. If I had to choose a Pale Ale of those I've tasted, I found Alpha King to be quite unusual and worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is wonderful...goes down smooth, not too much carbonation, very easy to drink. The same goes for drinkability...this is going to become one of my new session brews alongside SNPA. I could down these heavenly brews all night. 3 Floyd's deserves much praise for this fine example of the style!"
"Three Floyds Alpha King a perfect example of a pale ale that is not dominated by a overwhelming presence of alcohol in a beer. The beer pours a copper color that reminds me of a amber ale with a nice head. Beer smells like grape fruit and whole wheat bread. Tast of this beer is something spectacular, the taste of the hops do not dominate this beer and blends smoothly with the malty finish of this beer. It is easy to drink a lot of these beers, but they do catch up with you given the modest ABV. Give this beer a try, you will not be dissapointed."
"Thanks to BUCKEYENATION for the trade sample. I had tried this ages ago and was not impressed. Poured a nice coppery red color with a damn nice head that remained the whole way down the glass. Wonderful aroma-citrusy,almost spuce like. Big hoppy flavor up front-almost thirst quenchingly bitter if thats possible. Good body-well balanced to the hoppiness. A killer pale ale-more towards an American India Pale to me but a great beer all around. Funny what a second chance will do."
"this is a nice clean crisp pale ale that will knock you on your ass if you do not watch yourself. abv is a little over seven percent but doesn't taste over 5. very little alcohol taste. taste is clean crisp and hoppy. from the things that i read i expected some sort of hop freak show but instead had good hop character which is what i like. wait a minute... it is pretty freakin hoppy. i'm looking forward to trying other three floyds brews."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" frothy beige head over the orangey amber brew. Head hangs around, and lacing is good. Aroma is of piney citrusy hops. Taste is all about the hops, but they aren't dissolving your taste buds, rather massaging them vigorously. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great. Another reason I wish Three Floyds would branch out their distribution a bit..."
"Beautiful amber with big fluffy head that leaves thick spider web of lace, whats that floating in my beer hop flowers? Guess its yeast because of the bottle conditioning but judging by the smell hops sound good. Wonderful hop aromas fill the air mostly citrus along with sweet floral hints could be the malt I guess but not a very malt heavy brew. Taste is you guessed it hops more hops along with a good dose of bitterness more IPA like the APA. Alpha King is a very good name because alpha acid is king with this pale ale first pale ale I have had thats bitter enough for a IPA usually other way around IPA that tastes more like a pale ale. Only problem with this beer is lacks malt enough to balance the hops hell I have had more malt in double IPA's that scorch the taste buds with hops then in this beer. Very fine beer for hop lovers wich I am but reduced taste and mouthfeel score by .5 for lack of malt backbone. Otherwise very fine beer very drinkable if you like hops try it you will like it says Sam. I would drink it in a box I would drink it with a fox."
"Fianl Thought: Well now, Three Floyds is making a case against Great Lakes for best Midwest brewery... what's that... is that a tear... running down my face??? I love beer!"
"Thanks quarre."
"Sampled from a 12 oz bottle. Pours a hazy amber with a big, enticing aroma of grapefruit & mild background sweetness. In the mouth, this is very bitter & damn tasty. Big grapefruit throughout & some light pine. Caramel malt lays a foundation, but is thoroughly dominated by the brew's hoppiness. Medium bodied with active carbonation. Lightly sweet & moderately acidic, this brew finishes with more strong bitterness. A damn good pale ale."
"If you are a hophead, this is a must have, but don't rule this out if you aren't. For a beer with this kind of hop bitterness, it is very drinkable."
"Hey Three Floyds - contact Southwestern Distributing Company in Memphis and let's get your beer to Tennessee!"
"Deep red copper color. 3/4"" of tan foamy head that leaves sticky rings on the sides of the glass. Light floral hops aroma, slightly citrusy. Taste is abounding with hops, makes your mouth water with every sip. There is definitely a malt backbone to this, though. A hophead approved beer, that is a little more balanced than many IPA's or even PA's for that matter."
"The body is hazy amber with a 1 ½ inch thick creamy white head with medium carbonation. The aroma is citric with the fragrance of grapefruits and orange rinds. The taste is crisp and refreshing grapefruit juice with a nice hop bite to it. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than an IPA, but is right on the money for an APA. Nice sessionable beer with no noticeable faults as long as you can tolerate hops. Very nice bonus in a box of trades, thanks to eyedrinkale."
"Bottled...part of a trade with Brooklyn Boy. Poured a delicious deep amber-orange with a wonderful sand colored tight. sticky cap which goes to a surface covering clinging lace which lasts. Lively in the glass with a continuous stream of tiny effervessent bubbles coming from the glass base. Glorious hop aromas...floral, lime, grapefruits, pine and sweet malts. Best APA aroma yet. Dandy mouthful of sweet bready malts at the start then the peppery carbonation helps in literally shotgunning the tongue with alpha oils....like bittered grapefruit and key lime with a floral background...malts sit well in the background mid point....the finish is long with the drying effect dominated by the piney hops and a very subtle bubble gum taste... then the metalic aftertaste followed by a slow warming from the alcohol...a very flavorful refreshing and satisfying ale. Thanks Edward...this brew is an American jewel."
"12 ounce bottle, with no freshness dating. Pours dark auburn, cloudy and with a few chunks swirling around. Rich, creamy, tiny bubble head and leaving quality lacing. nose is richly, malty and resiny hop filled. Full bodied nectar. Citrus hops explode on the palate. Deeply flavorful. High quality brew,seek out and enjoy. Cheers!"
"A very exceptional pale ale, one of the hoppiest i've had. This gets me even more excited about the Dreadnaught I have waiting."
"Thanks to Rick and Betty for dragging one back with them. I'll average the two scores."
"Well I must say whenever I find myself with a 3F brew its just an exciting time. This one pours a deep copper with amber highlights and a nice head about a half inch thick which leaves only the slightest of slight laces. Aromas are dominated by a citrus hop, with a slight malty background. Intially this beer hits up front with citrusy, grapefruity, juicy hops. Following some malts make themselves present giving a nice caramel and toffee like flavors but the hops just crash right in again showing that they are the king of this beer. More flavors of an assortment of fruits and some oily piney flavors just coat the top of my mouth. Literally this beer just sticks on the pallate and won't let go. This beer finishes spicy and hoppy with just a nice zing to it that makes it killer Pale ale, not for the faint hearted I must say. This beer has a nice light to medium body to it, with a fair amount of carbonation that just adds to the crispness of it. A wonderful brew from a wonderful company."
"This beer poured a nice coppery color with a small white head that stuck around for a little while, and then left a nice lace pattern down my glass. The smell was at first very hoppy and then that went away and there was a smell that was very malty. The taste was more malty than hoppy, however you could tell that there were a lot of hops in there. I think that there could have been more hops in this beer, especially seeing as how it is called alpha king. This was a nice beer, but I have had better. I will try this again if I ever get a chance. It is always hard to rate a beer on one experience. i think that this beer would be great with a RANDALL."
"It's been along while since I've had this, my memory of it had completely diminished 'til now. Now that I've had it again; well I'm wishing 3F still was available here."
"Wyll-"
"This is one mean pale ale. Perhaps the most flavorful pale ale I've tasted yet. Poured out a copper color with a nice head that lasted for a while. Smell hops and citrus. At time though it smelled like buttered popcorn. Strange. Taste was all there though. Grapefruit goes all over the palate and lasts into the aftertaste. But then more hops and malts attack in the middle and also lasts into thre end. But this is balanced alright. Next time I put in a order I have to order a 6 pack of this stuff. Damn this is tasty. But only if it wasn't for that strange aroma."
"A very easy to drink beer. A really good ""stock"" beer to have in the fridge."
"A rich copper color with a full tan head that leaves a touch of lacing. Citrus hop aroma with a bready caramel malt backing it up. Taste is quite good with alot of malt showing up as it warms. Moutfeel is full and gives the beer a nice rich feeling. One of the better APAs."
"Pours a deep, dark red amber with moderate lacy off-white head. Smell is light, smells crisp with a little hoppyness. Taste is good, hoppy yet smooth, there is nothing to complain about here. Very drinkable, this would be a great conversion beer to recruit fine men and women to the BeerAdvocate army. Yummy."
"This pale ale rocks! Pours an orange-amber color with a nice white head that retains throughout the beer. Nice lacings all over the place. This bad boy smells hoppy and a hint of citrus or fruit. I definitely tast hops, a touch of citrus, a hint of floral, and a smidgen of alcohol. This stuff goes down easy. Drinkability...are you kidding me? It's gone already? I could easily throw down a six pack of this over friends and a cookout. Pale ales aren't even my favorite style but this will be a regular in my stash. Drink it if you got it!"
"The mouthfeel was smooth and the finish was too. The bitterness and fruitiness lasted a short while on the tongue. This was a medium bodied brew that had nice carbonation levels. Very drinkable and could easily be a session brew for any hophead."
"The first time I ever had it. At Brewtopia beer festival in New York. Nice, full whiteness for a head. Big, hoppy, flower like fragrance and a brisk carbonation. Cloudy, orange-banana color. Smooth, easy drinking and yet big and hop infected neverthless. One of the best beers I have ever tasted."
"Pretty nice stuff, quite sweet at first, then quite bitter towards the end. Rich palate, full of flavour, a soft smooth texture. Sweet malts, a nicely bitter aromtaic hops. Main flavours of lychee, pine, grapefruit (sweet). Satisfying bitterness. A slightly stronger version of an APA, Tasty stuff."
"Overall, excellent and highly recommended."
"This one pours a nice dark red/amber color with nice sized white head. Has good head retention and leaves some lacing around the glass. Smell is dominated by the hops mainly citrus and there is some malt too it as well. The taste is all about the hops, which dominate the initial flavors. There is some malt to it and it has a nice bitter aftertaste, a very balanced taste. Has a nice think and creamy mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. A great pale ale that is very complex and makes for one of my favorite session beers."
"It may be pale ale, but there are plenty of IPA's that don't come on this capably and this strong. With a crafty balance and a sly blended complexity, it keeps the palate interested from the get-go. And with the refreshing elements in full splendor, it's absolutely, positively very drinkable. It's a whole lot better than most session beers, but the ABV is quite manageable, and damned if I can think of why I wouldn't want to have plenty of these available at any given time."
"Hopheads delight! Big juicy orange / grapefruit flavous, along with intense pine. Fortunately theres enough sweetness / malt to hold this thing together. Medium bodied, slightly creamy, gentle carbonation."
"It pours a clear dark copper/amber with a good sized beige head and it has some lacing. The aroma has a lot of hops (mostly cirtus with some floral notes) and some malt. I get juicy grapefruit from the hops and a slight caramel maltiness in the background. It becomes slightly sweet and malty and then the hops finish up with a well balanced bitterness. It is over the top, but just a fine pale ale."
"This is a great beer that begs to be drunk time after time"
"Super smooth with very mild carbonation. Easy to drink, with good taste and silky flow."
"Taste: Initial bittersweet mix of spicy hops and complex malts. Creamy in the mouth, with nice balance. Don't get me wrong, it is a bitter beer, with massive high-alpha bittering hops for a pale ale. But balance is the name of the game here. Relatively high alcohol is barely noticeable except for a warming of the face. Nice finish, with juicy citrus flavor."
"This is probably the best standard pale ale I've ever had. Definitely the Alpha King; as the name implies, a seriously hopped beer here. Malt is second (but still present) to citrusy hops. Wonderful. A great session beer. I wish we could get more 3 Floyds stuff in NW Ohio."
"IPA fans will find this very drinkable (compared to other IPA's, in my view) however I find it slightly challenging. Likely I'll only drink one at a time and then move on to a different beer."
"I'm sold. Too bad the nearest place I know to buy one is a four hour drive away...But you know, it's almost worth it."
"Thanks to jables for the reunion, after too, too long!"
"The mouthfeel was not as pleasant as the bottle, but a damned good experience nonetheless."
"Bender: At 7%, whoo hoo. I had the intention of just trying one of these before going with Black Forest for the night. Well, I never made it to the Forest as I detoured staright into Hopland. In addition, I was on my way home to Buffalo. This beer convinced me to get a hotel room and stay over so we could become better friends."
"Drinkability: This is not for the faint of heart. It is very blunt with the hops in aroma, flavor, and even appearance with the hop floaties."
"Ahh, a not bad pale ale at all, and I appreciated the chance to give it a try, and I might well have it again."
"Overall: A bit unbalanced for a pale ale but it does have character. The malt profile could be more steadfast and while it is nicely hopped it doesn't have much to complement it. All in all though a good brew."
"This was a great beer. Very hoppy but very well balanced. I wish that it was available locally."
"This beer makes me proud to be a Hoosier. It pours a gorgeous copper color with a cream head protecting it's hoppy citric body. Smell is wonderfully full of citrus notes backed by some bitter hop scents. First taste makes me question why this is called a pale ale, i guess an IPA by any other name... This beer is massively hopped but it's balanced well by fruity esters. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This beer suffers a tad in the drinkability department as the high alcohol content takes it's toll. I also love being able to get this beer at almost ever liquor store in Indiana"
"12 oz bottle. Looks copper in the glass with a dense foamy and biscuit like head. Smell is simply wonderful. Lots of green hops smell. I want to take in deep breaths of this beer. Taste is great. So much hops it leaves the end of my tongue numb. Lots of hops taste without being very bitter. Piney notes seem most present. I've had more citrus notes in IPA's. Maybe even a slight peppery taste on the initial sip. Ends very pleasantly with a nice lingering hops aftertaste. How many times can you write the word hops in a review? As much hops as is here it doesn't make you gag with bitterness. Very assertive but not too unbalanced. A very unique and well done pale ale."
"If you like the pale, hoppy ales, you'll like this one. It's highly drinkable for the style."
"EDIT-- maybe my first review was with an older bottle or maybe i was in a bad mood, but on second glance this was better than i thought.. The nose on this one was pure piney hops.. Hell my wife even noted that the room smelled like evergreens. Taste was still as good but the Hops much more pronounced. Still goes down smooth .. Glad I gave it a second glance"
"this beer is attractive, just plain attractive. easy to drink while not being ""ordinary", it's got nothing bad but wishing i had bought a sixer if i hadn't. if i had i wish i got a sevener. HA!"
"Pours a beautiful amber/orange color with a small cream colored head...lots of lacing after a few minutes. This smells hoppy and citrus-y. Taste is sweet and smoothat first but is followed by a hoppy bite. This tastes good and not overly hoppy for the style. I wouldn't want too many at once though. This is certainly something to try."
"Pours a deep copper color with a white foamy head. There was a great amount of lace present on the glass throughout. Smells somewhat grassy and herbal, along with citrusy. Taste is sweet upfront, then with an intense bitterness. Citrusy bitterness, very sticky. Wonderful! Good mouthfeel. This may not be the most drinkable beer for a session, but it sure did hit the spot. When I am looking for some hops, this is a good beer to have. To me, it almost seems more like an IPA than a plae, but whatever it is, don't pass this one up."
"The thing is, I remember this being even better on tap. The freshness was overwhelming to me at the time. I will have to re-review once I get this on tap again."
"Amber color with a little lingering head and nice lacing. Very aromatic smell of hops and floral hints. Taste is a delicious blend of hops and malts. Notes of citrus. Bitter hoppiness that doesn't take over the beer but works very well. Sweet clean taste that leaves a crisp aftertaste of citrus hops. This is a very good pale ale and a must try for anyone who adores hops."
"Excellent Pale Ale."
"Thanks to JahNoth for the trade."
"This poured a murky auburn orange color, with an offwhite head that hung around quite a while. Ring lacing was there until the last dram. Mouthfeel is a bit surprising, as that's where I sense the first inkling of the nice malt going on here. The nose is all about grapefruit, tangerine, and spruce. Halfway through, it still looks like southern iced tea in an oldtimey pitcher. The taste is memorable. I've forgotten how long it's been since I've had such a perfect blend of subdued sweet caramel taste teased by such a wonderful sour grapefruit and bitter Mandarin orange hop balance. This one seems like a happy marriage of an excellent North American ESB with a westcoast Double IPA. Extraordinary!"
"Pours an amber color, quite clear except for a few large floaties. Forms a thin beige head that does not stick around too long. An immediate aroma of American hops wafts from my glass. Notes of lychee, grapefruit & other citrus fruits are in the nose, it smells slightly sweet & nectar like, there is a hint of caramel malt here as well. Ooh, quite bitter; this beer finishes with a drying intense bitterness. Overall this beer is only slightly sweet, it has a light body & is focused entirely on the hop component. The hops are over the top, but perhaps it is missing some hop flavor. There is lots of bitterness, but it feels like it is missing some balancing hop nectar flavor. Underlying the hop attack there seems to be some nuttiness, as well as some caramel notes. This beer is all about the hop attack, not much malt here, so if you don't like hops stay away. Luckily I do like hops so this beer is just fine. Perhaps a bit too unbalanced for an everyday drinking beer, but every once in a while is nice."
"I was extremely impressed with this pale ale. I like the idea of dropping the ""India"" moniker. The nose is great. Lots of citrus and pine, coupled with a sweet malt profile. The head is white and thin, but leaves a decent lacing. The color is orange with lots of red highlights. The taste is extremely balanced. The hops are quite present, but they seem to be just right. This isn't an Imperial IPA, just a well-hopped pale ale. There are some grapefruit notes alongside some hints of pine. These are balanced by a taste of toast or a biscuit flavor that balances the hops very well. The ABV is warming as you move through the beer. The finish is very clean and keeps you coming back for more. Wow! This is a great beer."
"The aroma is slightly grassy, slightly citrusy, but not overbearing. The taste is a very satisfying mixture of bucolic malt flavors, very traditional British tasting. Combined with the nice firmness of the hop flavor, it makes for a great beer. Its a tad high in ABV for a pale, but you don't sense this when drinking. And its very drinkable."
"Fairly easy to drink, you gotta try this one even if you dont consider yourself a ""hophead""."
"Clear copper-amber in color with a good, frothy head that dissipates very slowly. Huge grapefuity aroma that I think has some pine notes (I have a hard time distinguishing pine notes). Medium bodied with a good carbonation. The ever-present malt backbone, which is most noticeable at the start, is pretty overshadowed by hops after mid-swallow. The finish is citrusy and grapefuity with an aftertaste that lasts for a long while. As a pale ale, I think Ive had some IPAs with less hops than Alpha King. Nonetheless, its a great brew that is very drinkable and very well balanced. This one would make for a nice session brew. Alpha King almost reminds me of a VERY mild Dreadnaught."
"Medium body, soft mouthfeel and tingly carbonation. I could (and have) drink this beer all night."
"I highly recommend this one, I've had it bottled as well as on tap. If you're ever out one night and see this on tap, yeah, order it up."
"All in all, more of an IPA than a pale, which (for me) is a good thing."
"Pours a hazy amber with a huge white head which leaves trails all along the glass. A nice chewy almost toasty malt attempts to hold it's own against citrus hop attack. Hop profile is wonderful. The flavors make mouth happy! This is an incredible beer which I wish were available in Vermont, or even New England at large."
"Alpha King does seem more like an IPA than a true pale ale. I could definitely make this a regular in my rotation if it was more available. I plan to pick up a couple of fresh sixers (at the brewery) next week."
"IMHO, Alpha King sets the standard for American Pale Ales."
"burnt copper with a foamy white head, which recedes yet remains ever present. spectacular lacing. pungent grapefruit aroma. carbonation is a perfect level. silky smooth. lightly sweet fruity malts hold up to a powerful hoppiness that is never too bitter. highly drinkable. this was the beer that got me started years back, and i will always have a special place for it in my heart. love it."
"Served from a 12oz bottle from a 6 pack I picked up in Indy a few weeks ago. I've been dying to try some of the 3 Floyds beers and I have not been disappointed in the least. The alpha king pours out a subdued orange/light copper color, topped with a healthy head that's just a bit off white. The carbonation in my Alpha King was very present, not lacking at all as I have heard some say in the past. Aroma is a curious blend of grapefruit citrus and pine resiny hops, with just a bit of sweetness and malt creeping in. Taste is very boldly hoppy, but surprisingly malty as well. Much more balanced than I expected, the bitterness of the hops blends well into a caramely malt sweetness and a bit of piney hop flavor is left of the back of your tongue with the nice crisp finish. Very drinkable IPA, well crafted."
"Wow, this really took me by surprise. I was picking up a barrel of Brooklyn Lager for Thanksgiving and I decided to get something for myself to cover the few days before. I grabbed an expensive 6 of Victory Storm King and this because I remembered the Three Floyd's name. Damn, this is great beer. Pale Ale my ass --- maybe because most others Pale in comparison. The appearance was a burnt amber color with a nice deep tan head. lacing throughout the entire pint all the way down. The smell was floral and hoppy with a nice sweetness with a hint of good things to come. Bam, the taste just smacked me in the face. Flowers, a little grassy but very bright with a serious bite. I'm writing this after my second bottle; if I start the review the same sitting (or day) I can tell it's a winner. The mouthfeel was extremely crisp with a slight citrus twang, but definitely not that syrupy taste that sometimes lingers. This lingered on for a good long while, some of the maltiness crept back in on the tale end. I believe this is very drinkable because I've already decided to start my 2 beer a weekday limit tomorrow... This is right up there with Hop Devil (I know, IPA category but similar in character). I will A-B these one of these days."
"Drinkability: A great beer. Hoppier than most Pale Ale's, but who cares! A staple in my fridge. Seek this one out."
"I enjoyed this beer, it didnt kick me out of my shoes but it is good. It has a nice flavor and (IMHO) with a decent punch to it."
"Ah, the firstborn child of Nick & Co's ""Not Normal"" brewing philosophy. It's almost damning with faint praise not to call it an IPA (in which case, it'd rate second to 3F's own Dreadnaught. At our homebrew club meeting at the brewery, it felt as though we were swimming on the US's entire hop production for the year. Tangy citrus hop flavor will give you a buzz long before the alcohol can work its magic. An inspiration to every amateur or pro brewer to ""go BIG, or go home!"""
"I have no idea why the bottle was so full and the carbonation so low, but Alpha King is an old favorite and highly recommended."
"Very thin mouthfeel, and very easy to drink by flavor, alcohol content, and mouthfeel, I could throw this down easy, yet it is good enough to be slowly savored. A toned down little cousin of the vaunted Dreadnaught."
"Just a decent all around pale ale. Deep copper color with an off-white head and a decent amount of lacing. Smell was judiciously garnished with piney hops as if the brewers merely dropped dripping hop cones into the boil. To me it was a somewhat raw unrefined smell that was not balanced exceptionally well by any malts. Taste was very true to style with more hops although a tad on the citrus side in the taste with a cracker like malt taste and a fair bit of alcohol punch. Much more alcoholic than expected for a pale ale so this is not what you would call a session beer, but a nice way to mix things up and kick your taste buds around a bit. The unrefined hops make it something to drink towards the end of the night when you are ready to not taste anything else."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep bronze color with one finger of head. There is a good amount of lacing left down the sides of the glass. The smell hints at pineapple and grapefruit, with a good dose of hops as well. A very full smell. The taste starts a little sweet and malty, but ends with a fury of hops. This brew reminds me of Burning River, because both are pale ales that have lots of IPA characteristics. The body is fairly thick and strong for a pale ale. The drinkability is really good for a 7.25% brew. A fantastic pale that works anytime!"
"Appearance: Pours a copper amber tone with a nice sized off white cream hued head leaves nice appeasing rings of lacing, not bad at all. Aroma: First thing that hits me is the grapefruit like citrus hop tone with a rich malty barley presence this beer is a big pale ale at about 7%abv I think this one smells absolutely wonderful. Taste: Rich balance between the full hop bitterness some pine cone like and earthy tones available to the palate the juicy robust malt backbone also is here teasing the taste buds just so good. Mouthfeel: Medium body not sticky but texture just enough to let the sweet maltiness and hop oils run across the palate with some consistency. Drinkability: Freaking amazin' so damn drinkable perfect with a sixer and a ball game on the tube just one of those beers, I personally love the Dreadnaught but this is so damn good and palatable for a flagship beer they better never touch the recipe."
"Tawny-golden brown hue, slightly off-white head, about a finger in size. The head lasted for a moment, faded to a tight cap that lasted throughout consumption. Laced very well. Damn lovely nose, hoppy(!) acidic, bold grapefruit, hints of pine very distant caramel malt. Powerful. This is the Alpha King of all Pale Ales, the bitterness is not as assertive as the bouquet would indicate; it is might tasty though. Oh, dont get me wrong, it is bitter. The maltiness plays more that a secondary roll, Id say the relationship of malt and hops is 40/60. Yes, the hops steal the show, grapefruit rinds, acidic, zesty, vaguely piney. Flowery too. Savor this one, its hoppy enjoyment and complexities only seem to grow better! Medium body with light carbonation helps produce a silky smooth mouthfeel. So easy to drink, youd never realize how high the abv is. I snagged a six-pack in Des Moines, now I wish I bought more. Recommended."
"A stuporous deep copper color as it sets in the glass adorned by a massive and semi-creamy off white head, and after dissipating the resultant lace a velum like sheet conceals the glass perfectly. The hops produce a marvelous floral aroma at the front, sweet malt in the middle, fresh crisp ending to the nose with a semi-sweet malt start and the middle a moderate feel on the taste buds. Finish is lenient in acidity with the hops dynamic in their spiciness, WOW, they make your whole sensory system sit up and take notice, dry and long lasting aftertaste. Ranks in my top ten all time favorite Pale Ale category, need to get another order in for this magnificent beer."
"Hazy orange-brown body, almost iced tea-like. Topped by a sticky, chunky head. No missing the big, citrusy hop aroma with mild, but noticeable, hints of banana esters. Im not talking about hefeweizen, but theyre there. Great hop taste and bitterness which is kinda implied by a name like Alpha King. Usually with a hopping like this one would expect to find a sticky malt body, but remember this is a pale ale not an IPA. The malt provides precarious balance to the big hop flavor and assertive bitterness. The hop flavor is rather complex and changes throughout the mouthfuls. There is a little apple late in the finish. Looking back on this brew, it seems like this is about as close to a big, homebrewed PA as you are going to find out there with the hops, haze, and esters. This is one beer I wish would come to the Garden State."
"12oz bottle fresh from the brewery. Beautiful copper colored ale with a thick frothy head. Big piney citrusy hoppy aroma which smells like a good amount of Cascade but I could be wrong. None the less, fantasticly hopped. Smooth body with a bitter slightly dry finish. Terrific flavor with nice blend of malts and hops. A bitter pale but fantastic and nearly an IPA in my opinion. Delicate lacing. Wish I had more of this."
"OHHH...me gusta esta cervesa! Its very good. The nose and taste screams Hops, hops hops. Malt malt malt. (In that order) Huge grapefruit bitterness that the malt attempts to balance, but has a hard time doing so, however it has a nice maltiness that isn't lost to the hops. The head was a bit small and the carbonation was low, but I think this was good as an overcarbonated hoppy beer tends to burn ones tongue pretty good."
"Lightly turbid dark copper hue. Topped by a solid, stiff, cream white head that leaves steadfast Belgian lace. The aroma is comprised of pronounced pink grapefruit with sprinkled with hints of acidic lemon zest. Overshadowed, non descript light lovibond caramel malt tapers the pungency slightly and couples with understated hints of pine to lend a sweet, sappy spruce counterpart to the dominant citrus character. Obviously hop driven and very welcoming aromawise. Brusque snap of simple caramel sweetness initially in flavor is nearly overrun by a barbed, yet agreeable melange of grapefruit flesh and barely burnt biscuit. A suggestion of candied lemon surfaces mid palate along with rounding hints of toffee, and manages to facilitate a lingering, rich, nearly balancing malt presence. A balmy, grassy, dry hop derived component surfaces late and extends the lemony citrus theme in a fresh lemongrass like nature. A bit skimpy in body to support the pervasive hop character, but certainly passably dextrinous in mouthfeel. Finishes with a deceptively light and balanced mix of clean hop bitterness and stately caramel sweetness. Alpha King is a unique and highly enjoyable American brew. Its overall flavor profile precariously teeters between an American pale and a northwest IPA, but manages to find balance. The quintessential sugared grapeftuit impression is there, but never becomes cloying. Reminescent of a Hop Ottin / Liberty Ale hybrid. Superlatively drinkable, and ominously so at that."
"Medium gold color. Medium head. Aroma is hoppy and malty. A medium bodied pale ale. Nice citrusy floral hops, balanced by sweet crystal malts. Great malt and hops flavors that are different and distinct, yet still well balanced. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and kind of dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. VERY nice beer."
"This one pours out a copper color with a good sized, slightly-less-than-white head on top. Great lace trail. One wiff of this garden-like beer will smack you with hops, with a touch of ginger scent in there. As for the taste it is completly dominated by a kick of hops. Spicy hops. Not much else to say except that if you like hops this is a good one to seek out."
"Pours a dark amber color with a medium head and little lacing on the glass. Tons of floaty stuff in the glass - almost scary how much there is. Lots of hops in the aroma as well as a grassy and citrus smell. The flavor was mostly hops with some grass and citrus tastes thrown in, just like in the aroma. The finish is ... you guessed it, hops. Not a bad beer. Not the easiest drink, but I may have another sometime down the road."
"That massive whack of hops is what gets you. Yeah the body is really good: heck, 7.3 percent alcohol and alcohol never shows up in the taste profile. It's bitter, but not massively so, and while others have noted some sweetness, I never noticed it. Give me this over Arrogant Bastard any day."
"I'm impressed with this beer, as much as i thought i wasn't going to like it."
"Hop heads rejoice! This one will dominate you and make you beg for more of those delicious flowering cones! Hops, hops and more hops are in the aroma, predominate in the taste, and are present in the finish. Not nearly as bitter as you may expect. Very smooth and luxurious mouthfeel - I love this beer! I dare say on par with Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale and then some! Recommended!"
"This beer poured amber/orange colored that was clear and well carbonated. It created a creamy beige colored foam that lasted the whole way to the last sip and more. The consistency of the foam was watery (as it moved fairly well), thick, sticky and creamy. It created a sheet like lace on the sides to about ½ way down the glass then slowly broke into a spotted lace to the bottom of the glass. The aromas were dominated by hops, fresh (just harvested), then aromas of grass, citrus (grapefruit), pine trees and sap, and some malt soon began to mix in to the nose of the beer. The flavors that rolled over my tongue were also dominated by hops. Tastes of dry hops, fresh hops, pine needles, floral hops, fresh grass, citrus fruit (grapefruit), and some malt at the end. The aftertaste was mainly of hops, some citrus, some fresh, with malt tones, but light. Semi dry appeal and not overly bitter. The body was on the light to medium side. I did notice that as I came to the finish and the beer was allowed to warm, it became thicker and the malt flavors seemed to become more pronounced. This is a really good Pale Ale, good flavors, and very pleasing to the senses. A really good example of the style it is brewed in. A must get."

"Perhaps, my experience with this pale ale was the result of perfect lining up of the planets, but I can't remember drinking a better tasting pale ale in a long time."
"Originally sampled on 5 October 2002. Alpha King has a beautiful citrus hop aroma, along with a nice bitter taste w/ a clean finish. It is a very nice example of an American Pale Ale (APA). In my opinion, it's a very good session beer. I'd rather have Dreadnaught, but if you want to drink a few, this is a better choice."
"Update: I believe Three Floyd's has given up having Schell bottle their beer. I like the new batch better. The head is stronger and the flavor is a little more balanced. I wish they would send their strong beers to Iowa. A top shelf brewer."
"Well this sure is one great looking beer. The head came up three full fingers and lingered like crazy, creating super sticky lacing down the glass. The body is crystal clear dark amber topped by the ivory head mentioned above. Great nose that gives off plenty of hops aromas and hints of the malt body. The taste is about hops - citrusy and floral in the main, with great rind and grapefruit accents. Plenty of great bitterness it lingers on the palate like some great oily lotion to leave a creamy sense to remind you of the great taste you've just experienced. Full body and ultra creamy feel make this an exceptionally fine flavorfest."
"I will be finding another of these and revisiting this beer."
"Pours a dark coppery color, nice foamy white head. Lacing on glass as head dissipates. Lacing persists as beer is consumed as does a very thin head. A very attractive beer. Smells of citrus and hops, not overpowering but very pleasant. Decent taste, hoppy with a citrus overtone. A nice feel, not very heavy. Readily drunk, a good overall beer."
"This bees is defiantly the ""King"" of Pale Ales in my book. The wonderful golden copper color and thick creamy head delighted me at the start. The smell was rich and floral from perfect dry hopping. The taste was excellent. A complex blend of grains balanced with hoppy floral esters and bitterness balanced this beer beautifully. Starts out smooth and sweet, becoming bitter and piney, with a citrus middle and a tart, floral finish. Hail the King!!"
"(Tasted this beer at the Blind Tiger's Three Floyds event)"
"Cheers to MJR for the blockbuster."
"Pours with an amber color. Grapefruit comes through in the aroma and in the taste as well. It's labeled a pale ale, but I might go as far as to call it an IPA. It's a wonderful beer with a wonderful hop character. I hope I find more of it around here."
"A very good IPA. This is very nice from the pour. A good copper color from the outset. A nice head that fades to a lace after a while. A great aroma of hops and some spice, this beer offers a great flavor from the first sip to the very last. The hops are so well-utilized. This is a solid IPA. Prost!"
"I ordered this beer at restaurant a couple nights ago, already knowing that it received high ratings, but I had no clue that it was going to be this dang good. Pours a dark copper color with a thick rocky white head. The head retains itself for the entire duration leaving a thin lace splattered on the sides of the glass. The aroma is all about hops, lots and lots of hops. Light citrus aromas where also detected. The tastenuthin but hops, it seemed as though I tasted a different type of hops each time I took a drink. But, wheres the 7.3% alcohol? Its hidden exceptionally well. There was an intense amount of bitterness left in my mouth, but I didnt mind, I was in love with the taste of this beer. Will I buy this one again? Hell Yeah!"
"This beer pours a slightly hazy orange color with a moderate tan head. The mouthfeel is moderate. The smell is sweet maltiness with citrus notes. The taste has a malty start finishing with grapefruit hops. Overall a nice hoppy pale ale that seems to hide its relatively hight alcohol percentage well."
"Drinkability: Very, very easy to drink. The blend of the flavors, coupled with the dryness on the tongue make for an excellent beer."
" Cheers!"
"Overall this is a wonderful ale. They call this an IPA? Can't wait to try Three Floyds IPA."
"If this is the Pale Ale from Alpha King  I would dearly love to try their I.P.A!!!!"
"My first cask-conditioned beer....the head was large and fluffy and the aroma was strong of citrus and fruits. The balance was amazing, a sweet malty mouthfeel among the strong citrus hoppy domination. The hop flavor sticks around past the very dry and crisp finish. What a refreshing and enjoyable beer. I've never had a beer with such a dry and crisp finish. Is that a trait of cask-conditioned? Not the slightest hint of the 7.3% ABV at all. This beer just came damn close to Two Hearted Ale as my favorite pale ale."
"The labeling on the six-pack caught my with the crazy looking king on it to begin with,poured a hazy-yellow color with extreme hoppy mown grass smell.Taste was a little piney,with definent hop overtones.Alittle malty in the background but in my opinion not quite balanced enough,a decent beer but maybe a bit overated."
"(source: Habersham Discount Beverage; Savannah, GA)"
"Very good APA. Pours a coppery golden color with an off-white head. Good citrusy hop aroma. Aggressively hopped. Very good citrus hop flavor that seems to overlay a solid malt backbone. Spice notes are also detectable. Maintains good drinkability."
"Dark red amber color, citrus hop smell, and a really cool label. The taste is a little grapefruit and a whole lot of hops. The hop flavor stays on long after the beer is gone. I like hoppy beer and the 7.3% alcohol is a nice bonus."
"One of the coolest bottle labels I've seen around."
"7.3% abv?? You have to be kidding me. Not even the least bit noticable in taste. Highly drinkable but watch out or this will hit you like a hammer to the head. A great Pale Ale!"
"Drinkability: Very high. The incredible balance and dryness combine to make a very drinkable beer. Start a big meal with this brew. A great example of the style."
"Pours a glowing amber-copper color, nice thick head,decent lacing. Strong grapefruity cotten candy, hoppy aroma. Medium body, soft creamy palate, Strong citrus hoppy with some caremel flavor, good session brew, easy to down a few."
"First thing that came to mind: ""Holy crap what a great beer!""  Huge citrus aroma leading to a refreshing and extremely drinkable, well-bodied ale.  The intense spicy citrus hop profile is awesome with an aggressive, but not oppressive, bitter bite.  Up on/near the top of the line."
"Bottle numbered 02142 which I presume means the 142nd day of 2002. Does anyone know if I am right? Says brewed in New Ulm; Cokes tells me it's contract brewed by Schell. Despite being 6 months old still in fine shape. Spooky bottle. Excellent head, sensationally fruity aroma. Taste is quite good, rich caramel malts buttressed by grapefruit hops. Instead of bittering, the hops bolster the sweetness of the malts. Interesting effect. Kind of like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale crossed with Magic Hat #9. But sweeter than both those beers. Top-notch mouthfeel, creamy frothy and just a hint of rawness. This should appeal to not only the hophead but the fruit beer fan, as well as middle of the road drinkers looking for adventure. A fun beer to drink but too fruity and zesty to be a session pick. 7.3? Is that for real? Yikes. Three Floyds is new to me and definitely one I will keep my eye on. God bless this current wave of intrepid new US microbrewers, I was born at the right time."
"I must say that I really enjoyed this beer.  It pours to an amber-orangish color, with an off-white, creamy head.  It also has a slight hazy appearance to it.  Alpha King has a very hoppy, citrusy nose, probably from the possible use of Cascade hops.  The citrus aroma reminds me of lemon zest.  The beer has a nice hoppy, citrus flavor as well, and finishes dry.  Overall I would definitely drink this beer again when I want a nice hoppy beer.  I would love to try this one on tap."
"Pale average appearance.  Not alot stands out.  There is an above average hop presence, but it seems to fade into thin air as you drink.  Slight white head.  Overall a slightly above average pale ale."
"Nose of citrus and spruce over a hint of malt. The flavor... It starts out OK, but about a third of the way through a medicinal, herbal note kicks in that I can't get my tastebuds around. I found it slightly off-putting, but can appreicate that it makes it different from other APAs out there. Decent balance otherwise. Good, bit it wouldn't be my first or second choice."
"The appearance isn't too much. Color of one of the lighter shades of leather with an off-white head that was neither large nor long lasting. Nose is malty with hops that are dominated by the Christmas tree-like over the citrus but both are present. Flavor is surprisingly thick malt for a pale beer with a nice balance with the hops. Kind of a slick mouthfeel, but not as slimy as some."
"a fresh one. You might also be blown away."
"As a Hoosier, I've got to give it up for my favorite beer brewed in Indiana. This pours a deep copper-orange color. Smells of citrus and floral aspects. Has a huge hop flavor (lots of Cascades, I presume) and should qualify as more of an IPA than a Pale Ale. However, this is a Three Floyds brew, and as they say, ""We're not normal."" Regardless, this is a great ale."
"can't believe this is brewed and bottled at schell in new ulm.   what a serious and bold beer...cloudy, hazy burnt orange color.  nice off white head that sticks.  hops explosion in the nose...a citric dynamite blast.  tastes awesome.  bitter alpha hop madness in the mouth is meakly balanced by a caramel malt body.  it IS slightly thin in mouthfeel but the hop party doesn't let you worry about that.   hits the spot after a hot day in the sun!    a hop-head delite."

"This beer had a nice dark amber orange color to it.  It formed a nice light tan head that left some nice lace.  A slight hop and malt aroma to it.  The flavor had hops and malt with a sweet, but not too sweet, citrus and caramel taste.  It has a medium body and finish.  Not as dry of a finish as their Pride and Joy, but a good beer."
"Pours orange with thick white head, strong hop taste hits you all the way down your throat, Citrus flavors abound.  Along with a respectable abv this is an ass kicking pale ale.  A personal favorite of mine!"
"Pours an orange-copper color with a nice pillow like, off-white head with good retention. On the nose there is a citrus hop aroma mixed with fruity / malt overtones. The same on the palate a lot of citrus flavor, grapefruit, highly hopped, malts, all well balanced with a slight acidic bite. The finish is slightly tart and bitter. I can not detect the 7.3% abv. Overall and enjoyable pale ale I think this brew leans more to being an IPA then a Pale Ale"
"Even more beautiful than I remember,deep,clear coppery amber in color.Nice lace about a half an inch head that stays.Deep fruity hop nose.Awesome drinker,nice balance of sweetness with lingering hops.A little citrusy."
"This is one terrific beer.  Copper-orange color with thick full head.  Hop aroma with mild citrus noted. Full hop flavor with mild bitterness from start to finish and lingers nicely.  Mouthfeel very nice medium body and noticable carbonation. Additionally, it possesses a nice creaminess.  One of the best examples of this style."
"Pale Ale? Seems more in line with an IPA if you ask me! Pours nicely into the glass with a thick, tightly laced head. Excellent deep gold/reddish color. Nose is of fresh hops, citrusy & spicy with a little malt sweetness. Taste is at first malty and sweet again, changing to a tremendous but not palate-numbing hoppiness...citrusy and long lasting. A very satisfying beer to the hophead and non-hophead, I would hope. Very good without being heavy-bodied, well made."
"N.B.: WOW, according to other reviews, this is big in alcohol, but you’d not know it."
"Man, what a good beer. A nicely hopped APA (not an IPA) that pours out to a reddish-copper color with a slight head. Initial taste of citrus and caramel with a big dose of hops on the finish. This reminds me of Sierra Nevada's Pale with a heavier dose of hops.  This is an excellent beer and does the American Pale Ale style proud."
"I am definitely happy that I went and bought this beer.  Pours a pale orangey/amber color with a nice head on it and a clinging lace.  Floral hops and yeast in the nose.  This beer starts off all hops.  But as I keep sipping it I get more and more malt that really balances this brew very nicely.  Lots of bready yeast flavor as well.  Creamy and smooth across the palate and very drinkable.  This is one kick ass beer.  I will definitely be picking up some more of it."
"Nice amber color, good head that left some lace on the glass.  Too much yeast floating around.  The yeast didn't bother me while drinking, but it wasn't a very appetising (sp?) sight.  Grapefruit and floral hops dominate the oh-so-wonderful aroma.  Pretty damn hoppy for an APA (really closer to IPA).  Wonderful bitterness in this beer.  It's a must for hopheads.  Nice thick mouthfeel.  This ale, truly, is ""meat, drink, and cloth"" - it's all one needs in life.  At 7+ abv, this is a pretty damn drinkable beer."
"Hazy orange tinted amber color.  Frothy white head.  A bit of a pungent hop scent.  An oily hop taste present.  Quite bitter.  More like an IPA though.  An average pale ale.  Tastes more like a British-style pale ale to me.  American styles have more of a floral and herbal aroma reminiscent of the NW hop varieties.  To me, this one doesn't possess that characteristic.  I see I'm not in agreement with most on this beer, but SN, Summit and Big Sky are a lot better in my opinion."
"Ahhh, now this is what an APA is supposed to be. Golden orange color with a thick white head that lasts throughout. Floral aroma and knock-you-on-your-ass grapefruity hoppiness. Delightful. Now I am a huge Sierra Nevada fan, but this definitely tops their pale ale. Nicely done!"
"As someone who loves American hop flavor but thinks that lemon tones in wheat beers are sour, I was a little worried that the label was in tropical colors and promised citrus.  One short sip later, my fears were allayed, we're talking grapefruit hops...this is a truly good American Pale, and I can echo the grapefruit comments of VENOM and others...yes, better than Sierra Nevada, to me...only the similar but even  more hopped Summit Extra Pale is a better example of this style, in my opinion."
"Certainly smokes more well-known APA examples like Sierra Nevada. Pick some up...you will not be disappointed."
"Nice herbal nose and fruity malt palate, especially towards the back where some real juicy flavors come through.  Hop flavor is mellow but the bitterness is solid.  Not the cleanest pale ale, but its really well rounded and has a deliciously plush mouthfeel."
"A damn fine beer. They use this as the base for the Alpha King Challenge, held annually during the Great American Beer Festival at Falling Rock."
"This is one of my favorite beers.  Beautiful rocky head, great citrus aroma, unfiltered copper color, awesome hop finish.  Nice malt balance."
"Hops had a great citrus aroma, but I was a little disappointed that the citrus did show up in the finish, which seemed a little on the harsh, quinine-like side."
"Notes: Well built and one of the best ales in the US. Hop character is above the rest ... a must buy."
