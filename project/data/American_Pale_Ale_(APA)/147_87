3.88,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 2/16/2015. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus hops and dark/bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, pine, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale ale. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of citrus/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 28, 2015"

3.9,1.3,4,4,3.75,4,4,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy amber body with a half finger of off-white head, golden highlights when held to light and a nice trickle of bubbles. A very good looking pale ale. Scents of pine resin, wet, earthy herbal hops, floral, jasmine-like hops, a hint of tangerine, a bit of pale malt and a touch of caramel in the background. A nice, hop forward aroma that leans less towards citrus and more to resiny, floral and earthy aromas with a nice balancing malt. Flavor begins with notes of pine resin and earthy herbal hops with moderate bitterness and a low level of malt sweetness. This moves into a more bitter middle with notes of pine resin, earthy herbal hops, floral hops, hints of grapefruit peel and a touch of pale malt sweetness faintly in the background. Finish is medium-dry with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel, light herbal hop character and a touch of biscuit-like malt. Aftertaste is dry with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel and biscuit-like malt. A good hop forward flavor profile that uses its light malt presence to keep the flavor from becoming too bitter. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with low carbonation and a smooth feel. Very nice and quite easy to drink. Overall this is a nice pale ale. It's hoppy, yet not overly so, aromatic, flavor and smooth. It's a nice, simple drinking experience and quite good.","Auraan","Aug 09, 2014"

A wonderfully balanced brew that drinks extremely easily as has become a top-contender for my summertime session choice.

The head on this beer is outstanding, very much like that on Sierra Nevadas Celebration Ale. I prefer this to Stones IPA, it seems to me to be a bit more complex and balanced with the malts coming through and not so hop dominated. Very nice.","theteleman","Feb 28, 2014"

The aroma is very well balanced between malty sweet and hoppy bitter. The body is light to medium and very very drinkable. This is definitely a sessionable beer. The flavor follows the nose. Very smooth and well balanced. No particular notes sticking out. Just smooth enjoyable well crafted beer.

4.05,5.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall / Drinkability: A very solid and drinkable beer. Full flavored and loaded with good aroma, I could drink another one easily if I had one. Went great with food (mexican bean & salsa + polenta casserole) and I know it would be good all by itself. I agree with the back of the bottle, probably exceedingly bold for its day, but not mega hoppy by today's standards. That being said, really well done and still a very good beer that accentuates the hops, but isn't excessively bitter. Well done.","damndirtyape","Oct 14, 2013"

4.07,5.7,4.5,3.75,4.25,4,4,"o: A classic modern American style pale ale, in that it is on the whole more hop than malt dominated. Some balance but it is the hops which stand out. Extremely sessionable: you do want more after it's gone. Wondering if the low marks and references to maltiness in some reviews here are the result of aged bottles. Not my experience at all.","scotorum","Oct 13, 2013"

This means the level of hops is not equal to that which British brewers introduced to keep beer fresh on the way to the Indian colonies. Interestingly, I take this as a less hopped IPA, which is -obviously-- just a PA. Regardless, this brew is a workhorse. It is fabulous with food but is a sessionable beer that will keep you coming back for another. Highly recommended and relatively cheap: $9 for a six.","BeerDocT","Jul 02, 2013"

Great brown color, lasting head, and a nice malty, yet very well balanced flavor, makes this beer stand out from the rest! If you don't like bitter/hoppy beer and stay away from Pale Ale's, do not ignore this beer. It is not hoppy by any means and yet at the same time it is not overly sweet or malty either.

The nose is mild but approachable with earthy hop character along with a gentle pale 2-row malt base. According to the tour guide only 2 malts used (2-row and crystal 60? Not sure he wouldn't confirm). The flavor is nice and easy drinking. The hops again are a little earhty in character with the malt base providing a pleasant flavor. Mildly bitter, very approachable. Lighter bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is an easy drinking Pale. Amazing that when it was introduced it was a hop bomb of sorts and now that seems to be the norm, a trendsetter.","hopfacebrew","May 08, 2012"

When the beer actually hit my tongue for the first time I was a little disappointed by the result. It's not the actual taste that put me off but rather the strange, lingering bitterness that felt bland and unpleasant. It just worked to mask all the other flavors of the beer, which if I could taste, I'm sure it would be great!

Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my trusty affligem chalice. I love the appearance a bit darker than a ""pale"" ale but a beautiful two finger head and a deep orange. Nose is nice malts and slight grassy piney. No definitely not a ruination but I can enjoy a beer afterwards without having to bump up the IBU. Nice mix of British PA and California PA. Malty with a eccentric piney aftertaste. Light to medium bodied with the enduring oily hops. Overall an excellent Pale Ale.

The hops assert their presence in the flavor with a distinct mild level of bitterness, piney. Some sweetness from the malt is there. Balanced but this has always felt, to me as a non-hophead, to be a hop forward pale ale. But I like it, it's assertive but not too strong. This was one of my first american pale ales and remains one of my favorites for the style. This isn't a beer I go to all that often, but usually once a year I do have to go out of my way to pick up a 6'er of this and always enjoy it.","denver10","Jan 24, 2012"

It is a good quality product that is sure to be a crowd pleaser to those that couldn't stand Arrogant Bastard, as well as other intense products by Stone. Not sure why they consider this to be one of their flagship beers when they're so renowned for their hops and crazy recipes, but it still stands as a good beer that I would recommend a try.","magictacosinus","Jan 03, 2012"

Sierra Nevada has more hop character in their PA than Stone, which kinda made sense when I compare SN's Torpedo to Stone's IPA. I think they like to make the hop presence a little more subtle than most in Escondido. The hops really come out in the mouthfeel and bitter aftertaste. The prominent malt presence makes this a well balanced brew that is easy to drink. A solid beer, I'll pick this up when I'm looking for a bit more malt in my pale ale.","Philousa","Dec 21, 2011"

The nose is caramel, hops, malt, and some floral notes. A little on the weak side, but improves with warming. The taste is fairly pleasant, with the hops really coming out to balance the malt. Not bitter at all, w/ a smooth aftertaste. I can see putting several of these down after mowing the grass, or any other summer activity. Overall, not a bad beer for the style.

The taste follows the smell with the main players being the hops, maybe more floral flavors than what is found in other west coast pale ales and IPAs but regardless the focus of the beer is clear. The malt is in there as well but only for support of the hops and seems to be mainly comprised of just typical caramel malts. I would have liked it to be a bit more well rounded. This beer has a moderate body and carbonation the finish is quite dry and puckering. Overall this is a good beer, but to me the APA style should yield beers that are good for a session and this one doesn't seem to fit that bill. It appears that other reviewers are finding more malt than I do, could have something to do with the age of the beers I have, they are getting close to the best by date.","fank2788","Aug 20, 2011"

Feels tight and spicy, and is carbonated well. I could definitely use more malts, but this one has some other nice complexity, even though the overriding character is of hops.

I have drank 2 Six packs since and think it's some of the best American Pale Ale produced. It pour perfectly and made a very nice off white head that stayed with the glass. The blend of hops and malt were just right for my taste. On Superbowl Sunday I drank the beer with Chicken wings and Sliders the beer complemented the food and was a perfect match.

Nothing really stands out too much, making it fairly sessionable, but if I want sessionable Stone, I'll go for Levitation.

The aroma offers a mild pine hop with a vague banana nut malt. Very mild but nice. The flavor is also mild but it brings a light citrus bite and crispy bread with some quiet caramel underpinnings. This not a sweet treat of an APA. It's pretty acidic, sort of spicey, a bit dry. I do pick up some more general fruitiness and banana as I get near the end. It's on the aqueous side, fairly carbonated and easy drinking if the taste suits you. It was a little dissapointing to me considering it's from Stone.

The stone had a kool-aid sweetness to the malt, and was less hoppy then the smutty and didn't balance out as nicely. The stone was all sweetness with no bitterness, maybe an old bottle?

Taste is very chewy, with multilayered flavors starting with big malts right up front with very vibrant hops kicking in mid-palate and electrifying it, and then a long, oily finish with an evergreen hop profile that makes me think of gin. Very round and balanced. This beer reaffirms Stone's status as one of the best breweries on the West Coast.","droomyster","Feb 03, 2009"

I loved the aromas in this beer. Initially sweet malts, balanced out with hops. Taste is similar at first. A long sip featured brief malts at the beginning, ending in bitter, grainy hops. This beer is medium-bodied and smooth on the palate, coating my whole mouth with bitter residues. The only downside for me here was that after the first or second sip, the hops started to take over completely, making the beer more unbalanced and less flavorful towards the end of the glass.

Actually I think the hops seem less bold because of the large amount of tasty malts in this brew. Anyway I appreciate the balance of this beer. Thanks Stone for making a well rounded very drinkable APA. I just wish it's price was closer to Deschutes Mirror Pond. Ah well there is shipping and distance to big added.

The huge malt is easily felt, this is thick and full for this style. Fantastic taste still can't believe how malty this one is.

Upon the first taste, it seems to be the same old story. Toasted caramel, brown sugar, toffee. A light toasted bread and grain. Fruit is still present. The hops come through a little stronger than the nose may have suggested, though not until you get toward the finish. They provide a solid bitterness and good balance to this brew. Mouthfeel is good but and balanced as well. Never too sweet or too bitter, just in between the two. Could have used a touch more carbonation but otherwise a nice feel to it.

They were there and certainly noticeable, but not quite so ""in your face"" over the top as seems to be the way any micro pale ale is these days. This was a very flavourful pale ale with a pleasant smell and easy to drink. What more do you need? Mouthfeel was very smooth and about the weight I would expect considering the style.

Smell initally is of hops, not too strong, but some grains are present as well as a grassy aroma. Taste was a little bland for me. It seemed to be more malty, grassy, and grainy rather than any hops. Hops were there, but very subtle. Moderate carbonation and a thick mouthfeel, leaves behind a plesant aftertaste and oily feeling in the mouth.

Not as balanced as the nose, more towards the hops here. Mouthfeel is not as smooth as I hoped, with overall drinkability being pretty good.

Malt-forward but quickly balanced by a dry hoppy bitterness. Again, the hops are more subdued than anticipated, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Stone refers to it as a ""southern California interpretation of the classic British pale ale style""...now the beer makes more sense. The hops, although American, are mostly earthy, leafy, and floral and the nutty malt base keeps everything in balance. The mouthfeel is almost cask-like which suits the intended style just fine. I like how Stone didn't try to go way over the top on this one. It's all about balance here.","wedge","Oct 09, 2007"

Nose is pretty mild, but mostly fruity hops come through with some caramel malt. Flavor is complex and fantastic: lots of fruity hops throughout the drink (they actually come to dominate more later on in the drink), citrus, pine, and then a nicely balanced amount of toffee malt. Feel is amazingly full-bodied for the style, very filling in the mouth with good carbonation. This one is one of the best APAs I've ever had, perhaps beaten by the fantastic Hoppe from Southern Tier.

I was shocked to see this in NJ (Liquor Outlet Wine Cellars in Boonton), but as the bottle states, their new expanded facilities have allowed them to make more beer. This was the first thing they brewed in that new site according to the bottle, and I'm not sure if that was a great decision or not.

I have been waiting patiently for this one for a long long time...time to indulge. Poured a somewhat dark almost honey color, with a small white lacing. In the aroma were toasted grains, honey, a bit of grassy funk, and an overall sweetness. Taste was complex in a few ways. For one, it starts off bitter as all hell, with aggressive hops, then fades into a malty sweetness. Flavors of honey and doughy yeast come to mind. The hops in this beer also have a mild fruity side to them. Mouthfeel was light to medium, and ever so drinkable. Stone never ceases to amaze me. Pretty much all of their beers are all business, they are tough, robust, and delectable. Next time the oppurtunity presents itself, a six pack of this will be bought.

Toasted crystal malt and light grassy hop aroma with some citrus/grapefruit just pulling thorugh. First sip has a touch of pale malt sweetness and a husky grain taste. Light caramel and pilsener malt come out slowly just before a snappy and herbal american hop flavor. Not unbalanced, but certainly a west-coast level bitterness for a pale ale. Semi-drying aftertaste shows some grapefruit and tea-like hop character but fleeting and not overly-bold. Light-medium bodied and gently crisp-a very smooth and inviting mouthfeeel. Finishes with a hint of butterscotch, mildly residual caramel and tame ale fruitiness that will vanish before it becomes distracting.

Ruby red with a touch of copper and a pure white head, which doesn't last that long albeit compared to Stone's other head retentions. Never gets to a ring though! Wouldn't exactly call it ""pale"". The smell is at first like a watered down version of their IPA, but gets much more pale ale-ish like when you start to scarf it down. The Carmel flavors come out and its very well balanced in the hopping and malt. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy and leaves little carbonation. In fact, I was wondering if I got a dud bottle because of the lack of bubbles, but after you take a swig they appear. Drinkability is damn good and very balanced. One of the best Pale Ale examples I've had yet, and Stone just keeps impressing me. A little bit better than Sierra Nevada because of the balance in flavors.","MusicmanSD","Aug 04, 2006"

Biscuity malt flavor is sturdily present, and yes, I'm picking up a definite butter flavor as well. All of this leads me to think this is a very ""English"" beer. Quite unexpected from such a paradigmatic ""West Coast"" American brewery. Smooth mouthfeel, extremely quaffable.

It is obvious that Stone put some quality ingredients into this beer as opposed to some breweries I've tried recently who just throw the cheapest crap they can find together into a brew kettle.

This one pours a great orange amber color with a good-sized head of off white. As the head disappears it leaves a beautiful lacing around the glass and beer. The aroma is predominantly citrus hops with a trailing sweetness from the malt. The taste of sweet malt briefly starts this one before the hop rush kicks in. The finish is a hop bitterness that counter balances the malts nicely. Mouthfeel is unusually thick for a pale ale but I like it, there is also a good amount of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer as most are from stone and is a great pale ale. It really makes me wonder more why this isnt as abundant in stores as the rest of their line.

4.33,12.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear, coppery-bronze in hue, an off-white head reached two fingers in height. This is a very lovely looking beer. It had steadfast head retention, it took a moment before it started to collapse, and a firm cap remained throughout consumption. The subsequent lacing was very webby and quite rampant. The nose says Pale Ale but it doesnt shout at me with hops alone, yes there are the typical hoppy notes of citrus, flowers, and pine. But the caramel malt is more than just a passing fad. The bouquet is well rounded and very inviting with modest potency. Like the nose suggested, the palate confirmed, this is a Pale Ale! Hell yeah! The bitterness is firm but not out of hand, citursy and piney hops flavors start the taste off on the right food, caramel, slightly toasty malts follows, ale fruitiness too, and by the finish the hops and malt blend in perfect harmony. This is quite the flavorful Pale Ale, very balanced and one of the best representations of the style I have ever had. Medium in body. Natural, soft but filling carbonation, the mouthfeel is very encompassing, relaxing. This is an ideal beer to drink on a regular basis. Stone Pale Ale is every bit as tasty as SNPA. When I was in Fort Collins I was smart enough to purchase a six-pack of this nectar, I figured this would make a great beer to chill with in the hotel (it was). I did save one bottle to review. Now I realize I should have bought two six-packs or a case or a one-way plane ticket to San Diego.","bditty187","Apr 30, 2004"

Aroma: Very floral in nature hops are evident they take a seat in the cockpit, but it's okay the malt backbone is the copilot. Wonderful fruity undertones with a bouqet of whole leaf flowery hops, well done. Taste: Sufficient amount of hops some may say unbalanced however for me this beer is perfect. American style pale ale boasts a fruity slightly caramel tinged malt backbone that also has the support of some juicy hop bite. Mouthfeel: To Stone this is their light beer, in reality it's a medium bodied lucious ale with mild even carbonation. Drinkability: Blessed with high marks across the board making it hellaciously consumable wow this is up there with their IPA for all around goodness.","WVbeergeek","Apr 13, 2004"

I love IPA's so I tried Stone's IPA first, wonderful, but a little too strong for a session beer for most folks, as is Arrogant Bastard. If you like IPA, this is as strong as a NORMAL IPA.

3.81,-1,4,3,4,4.5,4,"The Stone Pale Ale poured a slightly cloudy, copper-orange with a medium off-white head that quickly went to a lacing that stuck to the glass on the way down. It had a faint grassy, hoppy smell. The initial taste was some bitterness with a touch of citrus. It had a pretty strong bitter finish that mellowed as I drank it (the draft version was also mellower and smoother). Overall, this was a fine specimen of a pale ale, which is not my favorite style.","Beaver13","Dec 31, 2003"
3.64,-5.5,4.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"A nice, slightly hazy, copper color. Pours with a dense white head. Not as aromatic as I was hoping. There is a nice bitterness up front, as I take my first sip, it is accompanied by some biscuit - malty notes. There seems to be a lot of complexity missing here. A straight forward pale ale with not real defining characteristics. It is not balanced enough to work on a subtle level. It is certainly bitter, fairly clean flavors (light fruit, malt and some hoppy flavor contributions). Seems to be missing that certain Stone 'pizzazz'. Overall a decent beer, but I was hoping for something with a bit more definition. I need to see if I can get a known fresh bottle of this, to see if perhaps this is just past it's prime.","Gueuzedude","Dec 04, 2003"
4.43,15.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"This is one of the ultimate session beers in my opinion. On tap it is especially smoothe and crisp. It poured a nice light amber color with not much head because the bartender filled up the pint to the brim! Right off the bat I could smell the scent of floral hops and a slight spice that I cannot put my finger on. The taste was very good and reminded me a bit of the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale but with a much more balanced floral hop character and a nice malt flavor as well. Seeing as how most good bars around town have this on tap, this is now the new default beer =)","Dmann","Nov 29, 2003"

4.28,11.2,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Brilliant orange copper color topped by a lovely thick cream head. Aroma of floral hops and lightly roasted malt sweetness. Taste shows good bitterness, both citrus and somewhat floral/perfume in nature. Well balanced by a smooth malt sweetness that hints a caramel. Mouthfeel is good, not thin but not extremely rich either. Drinakbility is very good. Perhaps a little less bitterness would make this a touch better, but then less bitter wouldn't be much like a Stone brew, would it? Give this not-so-pale ale a try. If you like Stone (and who doesn't?), you'll like this slightly lighter (everything is relative) offering. That said, many IPA's wish they were this hoppy and this good. I'm about ready to give up all beers other than those from my Fab Five breweries. And each beer from Stone puts me a step closer to that day.","aaronh","Aug 13, 2003"

Amazingly fresh aroma of grains and hops could have easily passsed for a draught beer. Full bodied and smooth with a slight crispness, fantastic mouthfeel. Malts are really standing out ahead of the hop aroma. Flavor is a terrific balance between the malt and hops, grainy,rich,slightly bitter and sweet at the same time. It's great to see an ale that is well balanced and can showcase good malt flavor.","BierReise","Jun 29, 2003"
4.83,25.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"After tasting Ruination and Arrogant Bastard, I expected all Stone brewing ales to be totally dominating and ruthless. This on the other hand was beautiful and poetic, yet strong. Appearance a beautiful white head resting on a rather dark orange body. And what a sexy body. The malt aroma was married with the hop. I have never had a beer with such fragrant malts. The flavor was outstanding, both the malts and the hops were aggressive, but not intrusive and announced themselves with grace. I think dry caramel. It is only on the finish that the hops come out ahead.","Naerhu","Jun 21, 2003"

Medium body and on the lighter side of carbonation. This is a nice drinkable pale ale, not as assertive as I was expecting.

Pours a deep amber to copper color, the head is prodigious in size, frothy in texture and the lace fine sheets to coat the glass. Nose is nice a deep sweet malt, hints of caramel, and the little ""Hop Flowers", I love so much. Front is malt sweet, top is middling in feel and the finish a Hop Heads Dream, spitefully acidic, the aftertaste dry as a desert bone and quite long lasting, ranks in my top 5 all-time favorite Pale Ales.","Gusler","Dec 31, 2002"
4.57,18.7,3.5,4,5,4,5,"Somewhat hazed, copper color with a thinnish but surprisingly persistant head. Leaves a great lace down the glass. Aroma is hoppy and citric, with a caramel sweetness underlying. Malt sweetness hits you up front in the mouth as well, and is noticeable throughout the beer, contributing a nice nutty flavor. The dominate taste, however, is still the slightly acidic, citric flavors of the hops. They also give the beer a pleasant oily smoothness. The beer feels medium-bodied, finishes dry, and leaves you with a nice fruity/sweet aftertaste, with lingering hints of hop bitterness. This is probably more hoppy than the average Pale Ale, but this isn't an IPA or Ruination. There's a good deal going on here besides the hops, and this is a good thing. Extremely drinkable and pleasant.","mzwolinski","Dec 08, 2002"
3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"It's copper with a big head that sticks to the side of the glass. The smell is noticeably hoppy but not overwhelmingly so, especially compared to other West Coast APAs. The taste is a bit on the bitter side, with the hops beating out the malt by a length or two. I'm starting to think that it's tough to make an APA that really stands apart from the pack. This one is better than most, but it's not a knock-out.","mickeymac","Dec 06, 2002"

4.33,12.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Slightly hazy, very deep reddish amber/copper in color with a creamy bone-white head that holds well and leaves some nice lace. The aroma is limited but offers some light fruit (berries & citrus) and a mild caramel note. The body is medium with a very fine and gentle carbonation that leaves it surprisingly creamy in the mouth. The flavor starts lightly sweet and fruity, reveals some biscuity caramel malt and bright citrusy hops as it warms in the mouth, and finishes dry with a lingering sweet & fruity citrus maltiness. Well balanced. The bitterness is appropriate for the style but not-overdone and the maltiness & tight carbonation are exquisite. This beer caught me off guard. I was expecting something more ""full throttle"" from Stone's. But then it occured to me... of course they have a more straightforward beer! It's their flagship (and they do make the Smoked Porter as well). And, I actually loved it because it wasn't abusively hoppy. If it was, what would be the point of having all of their other, more aggressive beers? This is easily my favorite beer from Stone! Well-rounded, fruity, and highly drinkable.","NeroFiddled","Nov 11, 2002"

With a taste comes more fruity hop bitterness that is just a notch above the biscuit-like malt flavors that accompany it.  Fruity in the front and bitter in the back.
