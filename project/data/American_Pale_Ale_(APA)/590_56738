If you are the type of person who likes a little more flavor and feel to your beer, but maybe don't care much for strong IPA's, give this NCPA (No Coast Pale Ale) a try, I think you will be pleasantly suprised!  Another great beer from the best midwestern brewery in America, New Glarus.  Just remember you can only buy New Glarus beers in Wisconsin, so stock up when your there (as I do) or have a friend grab some for you whebn passing through!","The-MAD-Polski","Nov 09, 2014"

A nice malty presence that works nicely with the hops providing perhaps one of the best balanced beers I've ever had.

Citrus fruits up front with a small amount of maltiyess in the background with a light amount of light pine notes. Very smooth and light with malt that balances well with the hops.

Clean, fresh aroma, pale malts and citrusy hops, light floral/grassy notes. The taste was a bit more thinned out than the aroma would have led me to believe, but it was still good overall: crisp and clean, light citrusy and floral hops, and some sugary pale malt sweetness. Light-medium body, easy drinkability, nicely balanced, with a very mild bitterness. A good, simple pale ale.","Rifugium","Apr 10, 2014"

This is much closer to a pilsener than many of the pale ales that I have typically enjoyed the most, but the malt profile is also much less wheaty and prominent than the pale ales I have enjoyed the least. This finds a unique space and nice balance for itself, and is really a nice beer. I'd probably not seek this out specifically in trade, but would absolutely purchase it as an everyday sort of beer if it were readily available.","jdhowe","Apr 05, 2014"

(Not saying that just to make fun of Wisconsin.) This, by the way, is not a criticism. It makes me want to run up and grab a block of cheese to serve with it. Hop scent is muted, I can't pick out the varieties, but with a little swirl of the bottle, there's some pine and a little floweriness coming through. It has a good robust feel in the mouth, with some maltiness for balance at the end. I do not get a particularly clean finish from this beer, but I think that's OK, as it really is begging to be consumed in quantities greater than one. All around a good, solid brew from New Glarus.","schris","Mar 19, 2014"

This aspect of it really showcases the five varieties of hops used here, each taking a bit of their own turn in the spotlight, while appreciating the collaboration of the event as well. The flavoring followed well, but lacked a certain punch and zing so favorable to the aroma. This was likely helped along by the lightness of the thing. The feel is exquisitely clean and airy, bordering on thin and watered at times, but saved by the fullness in flavoring. To reiterate what is advertised on the bottle, drink this one fresh. You will get such a different experience. Perhaps that is one detriment, that its longevity is quite low. Either way, we are so happy to have finally sipped back on some New Glarus swill, and we are glad that this tasty offering was our initiation.","TheBrewo","Feb 01, 2014"

They're not trying to reinvent the wheel here and that's ok. What they've done instead is created a tasty pale ale that's extremely well-balanced and incredibly smooth. I'm a huge APA and IPA fan but for some reason I prefer New Glarus' lagers and maltier ales to their hoppy beers. Still, this is a really enjoyable brew and a solid take on the style.","WolfsbaneBloom","Apr 24, 2013"

Each sip seems to leave more and more lace on the sides of the glass. Hugely citrus aroma. I especially get lemons and a bit of grapefruit. The taste is full of citrus as well, suggesting a fresh leafy hoppiness that I quite like. The bitterness from the hops is somewhat muted but definitely there; it's just not as assertive as some other American pale ales. The mouthfeel is very soft and the finish is quite fruity and a touch dry. The citrus aroma and flavor in some ways reminds me of Three Floyds Gumballhead. All of these qualities make Moon Man an exceptionally drinkable ale.","marcobrau","Feb 13, 2013"

4.05,-1.9,4,4,4,4,4.25,"a great great session beer, drinkable in every way. pours a relaxed pale color with a little more than an inch of white foamy head. the nose is balanced between american pale malt and bittering hops, nothing to distinct about the hops here. ale yeast is obvious, providing some toasted biscuit notes. the flavor too is quite yeasty for an american pale ale, and i like it in this case. bittering hops on the back end, fresh wholegrain toast on the front end. dry mouthfeel, average carbonation, and just a little thin in terms of body. there is nothing too unique about this beer, maybe the stronger yeast presence, but this is an all day every day kind of session beer, perfect in all seasons, at any time. a delightful beer to drink in high quantities.","StonedTrippin","Jan 16, 2013"

The flavor and aroma are very juicy with mild floral and tangerine. The finishing bitterness is relatively mild, really on par with some blonde or amber ales. The body is a touch light for a pale ale, but this is supposed to be more drinkable (and it is). Check it out next time you're in 'Sconie","tempest","Dec 24, 2012"

Nice citrus aroma, odd for a pale ale. The hops are up front in the flavor, some nice malt follows, then comes a watery finish.

AWESOME. if there is a better pale ale out there... SHOW ME!

Tastes is light, malt first with assertive but not strong hop character, but under (as expected) and IPA. The balance is really terrific, somewhat dry and very refreshing. Mouth-feel is refreshing, the carbonation big, but not too, somewhat scrubbing, but not aggressively so. Overall a terrific offering and my favorite of the small hoard of New Glarus brews I've tried.

It is a choice beer for Spring and Summer, as its refreshing, citrusy, smooth, and, most importantly, drinkable nature screams to be enjoyed on the porch on a sunny 60º day. Additionally, because of its relatively low 5.0% ABV (by craft beer standards), Moon Man is a great session beer. As the label states, ""Don’t let this one lay around;"" it would take immense restraint to allow oneself to do so. 17.5/20","THANAT0PSIS","Jun 14, 2012"

The taste of the beer has a solid bitterness to it that is well balanced with the sweetness of the malt. The mouthfeel is crisp and dry with a lighter body and a solid carbonation level.

There is plenty of fruit character with plenty of citrus and tropical fruit. It has low bitterness and Is pretty refreshing. The lighter body is perfect for this beer. It is extremely sessionable.

4.02,-2.7,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Colored like clear golden sunshine, with a persistant foam collar that leaves behind better than average curtains of lacing on the inside of the glass. Smells at first mostly of herbal hop / pine resin combination with the emphasis put on the herbals. As it warms, I can start to detect notes of a sweet malt in the aroma as well as a tiny whisper of cannabis hop aroma. I taste mostly citric peel, floral flavors mid-sip, and a soft-pedaled finish of gentle pine resin that lingers for a nice while. Just barely enough malt in the flavor comes through to balance, this APA is definitely hop focused. Texture is very creamy and smooth, medium-light bodied, with an extended finish that gradually dries out as it progresses. A better than average APA.","WastingFreetime","Feb 03, 2012"

I would be very interested to try some of new glarus' IPAs, as i think a stronger version of such a beer would rival pliny. That being said, given that this a pale ale and not am IPA, the only thing i wish it had more of is aroma, but perhaps this is due to style as well. Great beer overall, and i will be hoarding the few of these in my variety pack.","amanofbeer","Dec 27, 2011"

The body is good and it goes down a mild tartness that's pleasing. Another winner from the land of beer and cheese.","DesMoinesMike","Nov 04, 2011"
3.54,-14.3,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"O: This is a good, lighter bodied, lighter flavored ale that delivers a citrusy hop aroma and flavor that is not too overbearing.

3.95,-4.4,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The palate opens with a blend of citrus flavors, a mild weed-like dankness, more intense than on the nose. The hop character is beautifully captured here, with a perfect balance between flavor and bitterness (for the style, at least). Orange peel, lemon, a little bit of a leafy/chalky character I usually find in Cascade-hopped beers are all present here.The mid-palate has a little bit of honey, graham crackers and some wheat-like flavor. While great up until this point, the finish is a little lacking. A little watery, this character is amplified by the lower level of bitterness and hop resin (even for an APA). Drying and moderately carbonated, with a wisp of alcohol and a touch of carbonic acid, this beer is thoroughly enjoyable.","DefenCorps","Sep 27, 2011"

The aroma is hop dominant, with a fresh, fragrant combination of floral, woodsy, and citrus characteristics. The flavor is a bit more balanced, with an earthy vet vibrant hop profile being at least somewhat contrasted by some nice bready malt sweetness. The fine, soft carbonation only somewhat breaks up the resinous texture, but it isn't at light as I would prefer. Overall, I acknowledge that this is a terrific example of a hop-forward pale ale, but even though I do enjoy a good pale ale, I couldn't get too excited about this one.","devilben02","Sep 12, 2011"

Taste is a little hoppier than a lot of pale ales - and a lot tastier than a lot of pale ales. Citrus and pine, grassy freshness, malty too... just delicious.

4.35,5.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Golden-copper appearance, solid lasting head. Great citrusy hop nose, dominantly grapefruit. Malt is upfront with the hops, lending a note of crusty, rustic bread. Great palate, a really nice balance between citrusy/grapefruit hop flavors and bready malt. Has a slight floral/herbal quality toward the finish, something that reminds me of rosemary. Mouthfeel is medium-light, fairly dry. Has a more substantial texture than many pale ales, but it's still supremely refreshing.

4.42,7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Comments: A great beer to get people introduced to the IPA style, as it gives a lot of hops in the nose and palate without much bitterness at all. (Consequently, for those hop heads that really want to experience the bitter, this might not be the brew for you.) What makes this APA stand out is the clearly pronounced aromas and flavors--hop and malt--that balance with such ease. Very few beers of this style can produce so much flavor with such smoothness.","DabblinWiscCraft","Jul 05, 2011"

Like many of the more sessionable American ales, its fair complexion belies its pale ale heritage, but it is otherwise very appealing in its looks. Otherwise it is very stylistically true but never extreme.","beagle75","Jul 05, 2011"

This is a dry beer that could of used a little sweetness. Not that it is overly bitter but it is nice to have something for the hops to play off of.

A bit of pine to the bitterness, but the big tropical fruits from the aroma have all but disappeared.

The taste is very balanced. In fact it is slightly on the malty side with some nice hop dryness in the finish. I really like how this beer smells hoppy, but tastes mildly malty. Both play well of each other. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture.

Living in Chicago, I only get out there twice a year, and seeing as they will not distribute to Chicago or anywhere besides Wisconsin, I may hype it up in y head throughout the seasons. However this particular brew has all the qualities of a Green Flash and gumballhead without being too heavv or too sweet. Another quality is that it is also similar to the Lagunitas IPA, one of the best beers ever created IMO, without the super-fruitiness that makes the LIPA tiresome after 6 months of loyal sessioning. I know '5's are extra special, but so is this brew. Jason, Todd, get on this one. This is truly one beer that belongs to no coasts yet all coasts can appreciate.","tapman","Jul 06, 2010"

The flavor is hops upfront-citrus, pine and a bit grassy followed by a hint of malt and a prickly hop bitterness lingers at the finish. The carbonation is medium-high with a medium body and a dry finish. Overall this is a well made beer and quite drinkable. I'd recommend it for drinking a 6er in a night.","uwmgdman","Apr 24, 2010"

Poured into a pint glass to give a nice clear golden ting witha 1/2 inch of white head thatlingered for a while but eventually dissipated to a thin film atop the beer. Very lemon smell with some grapefruit and grassy notes. Tastes fairly balanced with malts and hops for about 1/2 second and then a hop bomb is dropped on your tongue. Lots of citrus and some grassy/piney flavors and a nice bitter finish. Excellent hop profile on this APA. Mouthfeel is very smooth. With an IPA profile and an pale ale ABV, I could drink this all night long. If only I lived in Wisconsin.","hurricanelars","Apr 23, 2010"

Great body and carbonation. Finish is like flavor with a bit of the sweetness holding out as it all tapers off. Session beer for sure.","drpimento","Apr 21, 2010"
