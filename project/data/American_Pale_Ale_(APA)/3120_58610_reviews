"duet for me, was really worth the hype, this one was also really good, but less exceptional i think. less amazing and unique is for sure, but still a really trusty ipa, that i would happily drink all the time if it were available here. unique in that it finds the floral/pine specturm, while almost entirely skipping citrus. sure there is a hint of orange peel, even candied orange peel in the nose, but the flavor is like clover and pine forest, with no citrus in between. usually there is always that element there, but this is way cool in that its polleny and blooming, but also hearty and sappy. its balanced, but its big too, and although the hops drive the flavor, there is definitely a moderate toast to a fuller grain body, really really nice. i like this a whole lot, and amazing to have it on tap for the first time, but i just dont see it as one of the best in the world in its category. maybe i am spoiled, but for me, its a level below the hype that it comes with."

"O: Exceptionally balanced, creamy, and smooth. A perfect amount of light crisp mouthfeel mixed with a clean hop punch. I could drink this all day."

"Tried this at the Yardhouse in LA.   Beer had a smokey aftertaste which was very unusual.   I am not sure if something was not wrong with the beer"
"I am so happy that Alpine brews are now available in MA. Never got to have this one out in CA but it sure is a great one. Finds a nice balance between fruity, bitter and floral and every sip is so satisfying and flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Starts with nice citrus flavor, followed by earthy spice notes, a tad bit of wheat, well balanced.  Can tell it is an APA as it is missing just a touch of hops in the finish.  Rather crisp and dry."

"Green Flash version.  The nose and flavor was more hop forward than the Duet drank side by side.  More balanced, not as much bitterness.  As it warmed the hope profile came through more and it became more pleasant."

"Nice dry, bitter hop bomb. Less sweet (thankfully) than it smells. Nothing wrong with the feel, but clearly the weakest element, and given the standards set by the likes of Noble or Maine BC, subpar."

"@ Sunol Ridge, Walnut Creek,CA. 3.7.15.  With Tyler Kellner."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my type of pale. I'm used to the big citrus bombs here on the east coast and this was very piney to me. Nicely balanced but just not my flavor in terms of hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"Been waiting a long time to try my first Alpine beer. On tap at the Ale House Amesbury and this baby didn't disappoint. More than lives up to its lofty rating. Hoping to see more of this around. Thanks Green Flash!"

"Very nice aroma, all day pale ale, deff great summer time beer"

"The best pale ale from the best West Coast, up there with some New England hoppy brews."

"Serving type: On tap"

""
""
"O: definitely one of the better APA's available. Hope to see this more often in NYC. Damn good!"
""
""
"Lots of tropical fruit in the smell.  Super flavorful yet light and delicate.  This is right up there with Nelson.  This is probably the best tasting lighter alcohol beer I've ever tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There’s an aroma of orange citrus and piney notes. I get a great burst of flavorful orange citrus, as well as a subtle grassy hint that emerges as it opens up and some … Christmas tree notes too. The bitterness is all upfront, followed by a dry, dry, dry finish. This was exceptionally well done IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at 4th Ave Pub in Brooklyn for Alpine/Green Flash tap takeover.  This has been one of my wants for a while--really happy I had the chance to try it.  The nose on this beer is wonderful--hops galore, florally, tropical fruits and some grass.  Taste follows the nose--fruity hop bomb that could easily be an IPA.  This beer is very well done--right up there with Zombie Dust in terms of world class APAs for me!"
""
"Lots of biting pine and nearly astrigently dry malt. High carbonation but low richness. Chewy finish. Long lasting aftertaste of straight up bitterness."
"I can see why this one is so popular, so tasty and so drinkable."
""
"On draft. Yes. Have wanted this brew for ages. Poured fairly clear. Thin, white head. Mild lacing. Aroma sinks into my schnozzola and delivers bright, lively hoppiness. potent West coast pine and citrus along with some more East coast tropical fruit and juicy notes. Just a little bit of neutral maltiness but this one is clearly hop perfume. The flavor is simply so bright and lively it's such an enjoyable experience. Very complex hoppiness. No one hop descriptor dominates. Citrus, grass, pine, pineapple, some passion fruit and some mango. This one has plenty to latch on to. Finishes with a nurturing bready malt and a long lasting hoppy grass/fruit combo. Medium bitterness. Light bodied. Long aftertaste. Carbonation adds drinkability. This lived up to the hype for me. West Coast meets East Coast hop profile. One hell of a Pale Ale."

"Hoppy Birthday is an immensely flavorful and complex American pale ale that truly pushes the limits of the style. Now that Alpine beers are available in the greater Boston-area, I am looking forward to trying more of their offerings."

"My favorite Alpine beer even compared to the others."
"On tap at Fireworks Pizza during the Alpine launch party. I tried to go into this tasting with an open mind, as it included Nelson and Duet and I had never tried any of these beers. Hoppy Birthday was the clear winner for me, which was quite a surprise. I'm not sure I've ever had such a full bodied, hop forward satisfying APA. This would be the Alpine beer that's in my fridge at all times if I had the option."

"I know some are unhappy about the recent agreement to brew at the Green Flash facility, but in the last five years I have never seen Alpine on tap or in stores. Now I am suddenly seeing Alpine a lot of places, and the three I have tried are remarkably good. I don't see a loser here, unless people buy less Green Flash because there are better alternatives!"

"On tap at Barrel Republic. Hazy orange in color with a white head. Smells earthy with some pine. Kinda garlicy. Taste follows the nose. Super easy to drink. Loads of dank hops, some tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is great. Really smooth and drinkable. Overall, incredible pale ale, dare I say best pale ale I've ever had."

"I've been lucky enough to have a lot of great APA's - Edward, Sierra Nevada, Daisey Cutter, Alpha King, Zombie etc. This one is, in my mind, the best, especially for a good session. Incredible citrus nose, forward but not overagressive hops. I could easily drink this all day."

"O: Alpine is by far the best brewery for hoppy beers on the west coast in my opinion."
""
""
"Picked up,a bomber of this brew at the brewery in Alpine while passing through from San Diego to Yuma.  Nice IPA.  Great hop aroma.  Nice lacing.  Solid beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale gold with a small white head, good retention. Lots of citrus on the nose with mango, pineapple and apricot notes. Hop forward. Fruity on the front of the tongue followed by pine resin. Biscuity malt backbone but takes a back seat to the hops. Light bodied with light carbonation. Finishes dry. Overall possibly the best sessionable APA out there."

"I had this at congregation ale house. I've heard great things about this and it did not disappoint. I even gave some to a non-beer-enthusiast and he loved it. Sweet, malty, crisp bitter, dry, smooth, citrus, refreshing. This beer is a solid brew, if you find it. GET IT!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wonderfully balanced, full of complimentary and rich flavors, really enjoyable. However, it becomes extremely bitter as it warms. Also, maybe I'm behind on hops, but there is no way in hell I would call this an APA."

"Another super-dry hop bomb from Alpine. This one low enough gravity to have 3 at a sitting. On draught at the Rose & Crown, Palo Alto. Cloudy pale orange pour with a finger of foam which persisted until first taste. Apricot nose and orange rind, no appreciable sweetness. A perfect IPA for a hot summer day."

"O: Impressive but then again its alpine. This is a real treat. I should rate this higher because for its style its world class pale ales just aren't one of my favorite styles and they made an outstanding one."
""
""
""
"O: Damn near perfect for the style. Insanely crushable yet abundantly flavorful, seems like this was the 'session ipa' before the style was coined. Beautiful beer, and I can't wait to have it again."

"I walked, well almost ran, to City Beer Store when I saw they had tapped this. Pours somewhat hazy golden, slightly darker than straw with a fluffy one finger white head. Aroma is well balanced though amazingly hoppy for a 5.5% pale ale. What really sets it apart here is that super fresh hop aroma that is reminiscent of very fresh Pliny. Big piney dank hops overwhelm the senses. On the palate there is big grapefruit up front that turns into lots of piney dankness. Wow, this is dank as hell for a pale and also more bitter than I expected. Similar hop profile to Duet imho, just accentuated in different ways. A delight and lives up to the high expectations. World class west coast APA."
""
"Pours hazy gold with hints of bright orange. Smells fruity, apricot, dank, sour-deisel. Taste is pine citrus, resin, graipfruit rind, apricot, bitter. (Not the typical floral, balanced APA, more of a ""hop-head"" APA with hops in the forfront and very pertinant, compare to the medium malt profile expressed in traditional Apa's)Mouthfeel is light-medium, dry, crisp, creamy, bitey. Overall a pleasure of an APA. Packed with flavor most complex pale ale to date for me.would go nice with black pepper/ spiced rubbed meats, sausages, bbq, fowl recommended."
""
"Sunset orange in color with tropical mango and pine aromas. Taste follows the nose with a velvet mouth feel."
""
""
"Sampled on tap at Ale Arsenal. Beautiful golden color with some haze and great lacing. Fantastic aroma with loads of tropical fruit and citrus. Flavors follows with outstanding hop complexity, moderate bitterness and a foundation of toasted malt. A creamy texture and a perfect carbonation. A flavorful and refreshing beer that's perfect for a sunny CA day."

"I am looking forward to the pending Green Flash treatment of this excellent ale, and to see how the ratings go once it sort of hits the masses. THIS is what the so called ""session IPA's"" should be, IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Besides the great name this beer also has an incredible taste overall. With a pour of hazy yellow and a thin head. Aromas include hops, grapefruit and orange. The carbonation is medium and the flavor is very sweet with caramels and citrus. The aftertaste has a little bitterness."

"O: I tasted this beer knowing it had a score of 100 on BA. It still blew my mind, and it made me reconsider the style of American Pale Ales. There is still much I do not know. I haven't had it, but I'm assuming that this is the west coast Zombie Dust. A+"
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Good. Overall, really enjoyed this beer from Alpine. Very tasty with an abundance of hop flavor."

"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and onion and garlic hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus and herbal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"O- This was a damn good APA, one of the best I've had but definitely not the best and slightly overrated in my opinion. Nice balance, decent amount of flavor, and very high drinkability, but I still prefer some of Alpine's other offerings (Duet is still my favorite). I would drink this again, but I wouldn't go out of my way obtaining it."
""

"High B+"

""

"Pours a nice medium orange. Fairly cloudy. Nice big white head. Lots of fine foam, which leaves a whole bunch of lacing behind. Aroma is orange, tangerine and pineapple. Lots of nice hop flavor bouncing around. I'm not getting any malt character, really. Smells like a nice clean yeast. A touch of mineral water flavor. Lots of hop flavor in the taste. Very dry. Just a hint of biscuity malt. Medium bitter. The dryness amps up that bitterness some in the finish and I'm getting some solid grapefruit pith and pine resin. Tasty stuff. Very refreshing. Not quite as bright as some hoppy pales/session IPAs. Mouthfeel is light. Prickly carbonation. Good hop bite."
""
""
""
"O- Just an amazing amount of flavor for being a 5.25% beer. Extremely drinkable and one I would happy sipping on all day."
"O: This is a very fine beer. Very well balanced, great flavors, hoppy, yet not at all overdone. Quite drinkable. Glad to hav tried it."

"4.25/5"
""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is a grossly exaggerated example of an over-hopped pale ale (in a good way!) The modest level of carbonation gives way to a light body that at times is watery in a way that does not distract from the experience but increases it's overall drink-ability. I am pretty sure if this was made available to me on a regular basis I would pound it. The depth of flavor encapsulated here is impressive, I thoroughly enjoyed how much hop flavor it had without being excessively bitter for an APA. Very well done yet again Alpine and thank you a ton for sharing this Brett!"
""
"Growler at Woodshop 7. Not exactly mega fresh since this hasn’t been brewed in awhile, but CP filled and immediately fridged by a Woodshop attendee (amtran maybe). Clear to chill haze golden pour. Spotty white foam. Nose is big mango and tangelo. Taste is tangy, nutty, rich, fresh and chewy butterscotch. Heavy, rich, quenching, elusive butterscotch quality only found in select West Coast IPAs like Port Wipeout, Alesmith IPA, Alpine Duet. Very yummy. Amazing palate. Very bitter through the long finish. Still holding up- will be a knockout fresh on tap. 7/23/2012 7/4/8/5/15=3.9"
"Overall: This is a fantastic pale ale. If I was able, I would have given this a 4.75 overall. About the best smelling beer I've ever run into. Did not disappoint at all."
""
""
""
"D - And only 5.25? Oh, session time!"
""
"Growler shared at Woodshop 7. Not super fresh but way better than plenty of fresher hoppy beers out there. Sweet citric aroma with oranges, tangerines, lemons and mild stone fruit. Flavor is nice and tropical, grapefruit and orange and mango, a hint of sweeter malts in the back, dry finish and lightly bitter."
"O- Double IPA with an ABV of a American Pale Ale. Awesome session beer for the IPA drinker."
""
""
""
"Light body with spritzy carbonation, very refreshing and easy to drink. An excellent beer."
""
""
""

"Wow. I never thought I'd meet a rival to Zombie Dust....today I have."

"Poured into my tulip the brew is a beautiful pale orange with a thick one inch bright white head that leaves curtains of webbing as I drink down. The nose is amazing, pure Citra hop aromas with white flowers and peaches, simply one of the best noses on any beer I've had. The flavor profile follows the nose with concentrated citrus, stone fruits some bitter hop bites and a beautiful glance of light biscuit. The mouth is crisp, dry, and cleanses the palate with perfect carbonation. By far the best pale ale I have ever had, another world class effort from my favorite brewery on the planet."
""
""
"Overall this is an amazing bright, clean, well balanced fresh pale ale. I love Zombie Dust, but this is even better!"
"The best APA I've ever had thus far, it'll give IPAs a run for their hops to be sure. Just another wonderful example of what Alpine can do with hops, they've crammed so much craftsmanship into a beer under 5.5% alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is great, right up there with Zombie Dust as far as pale ales go. This would be really nice during the summer."
""
"O: What a killer APA. They don't make many like this: a low ABV hop fest. Though I still find 3F's Zombie Dust a better entry (and one of my all-time fav's), this is certainly no slouch. One of the most flavorful beers under 5.5%. Worth seeking out, and heartily recommended."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was an awesome beer. It was very hoppy and bright but at the same time light, refreshing and drinkable. What is really outstanding about this beer though is all that flavor is in a beer with abv in the low 5% range. Great beer overall."
""
"Tastes like a west coast iteration of an APA certainly, citrus and bitter resiny hops dominate a meek pale malt backbone that lends a wee bit of sweetness, though the finish is dry, resiny bitterness all the way. Light feel with maximum hop delivery. Would easily drink a couple pints of this schtuff, though it's not as unique as some of Alpine's other beers."
"O: A great APA. Glad to tick this one. Thank you Romulux."
""
"Hoppy Bday lands safely in second place amongst APAs, thanks to the sublime Zombie Dust. Wish I could get this regularly."
"O - Definitely the best APA I've had to date. Can't wait to try Zombie Dust and compare the two. I'm not a huge fan of APA's but I really enjoyed this one."
""
"super clean, filtered and lovely white lace. great example of a pale ale appearance. the smell is hoppy but muted, even with the head strong as it is. taste is hoppy with water pine and citrus and toast. the taste finishes clean and drying, and is seriously well balanced. sierra Nevada still wins in my book, but if i could ha e this all the time It would be serious competition. happy super bowl, hoppy. birthday. thanks Martin for the hookup. seriously enjoyable. great beer cheers and go pats!"
"One of my favorite beers ever and I love it every time I get the chance to have it. Light and refreshing, but still loaded with good IPA flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While I did like this Alpine offering and can understand what all the fuss is about, I personally would have prefered a finish that wasn't so dry. Not that I'd refuse this beer if you bought me a round..."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is right there with Zombie Dust as far as pale ales go. I keep forgetting how low of an ABV this is and I'd think it was a massive IPA based upon the hops if I didn't know better."
""
""

"Over all one of the best beers on the market."

"This poured a really nice orange/amber color, displaying excellent clarity and effervescence. It had minimal head (given that it was a 5 oz. pour) that left some really nice, sticky lacing. The aroma on this brew is insane! My first impression was ""oh my god!""; my girlfriend thought i found a bug in my glass, haha. This one is so intensely tropical. I'm getting big peach, lemon, orange, and mango. So good, it's almost unreal. The taste just follows suit with the nose. Very heavy on the tropical citrus fruits, peach and orange taking the forefront. There is also a perfect hop bitterness that bites the tongue, which is very piney, but is mellowed out by a hint of malty sweetness. This leaves a really nice hop oiliness in your mouth. It really reminds me more of an IPA than a pale ale. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, and somewhat dry. Just how i like my pale ales. Overall, I am going to have to say this is my favorite pale ale I have had so far. I really wish I would have grabbed a growler of this, but I did get a mixed case of Nelson/Pure Hoppinness, so I can't complain. And there's always next time : ) Anyone seeking this out, do yourself a favor and go to extreme lengths to find it. It really is worth it. Cheers!"

"I can't get over how much I loved this offering from Alpine. They raised the bar for APA's with this one."
"A great Pale Ale and one of the hoppiest I have come across. In fact, I don't think you can pack any more hops on top of such a light malt body and reserve that balance. This one even tips the scales on the bitterness factor."
"o - Overall I thought this was an amazing IPA; another fantastic beer from Alpine and one of the best single IPA's I've had. Very hoppy and fruity and I felt like I could have drank the whole 64 oz. growler myself. Would love to have it again and would drink this all the time if I lived by Alpine."
"O - Great! You can't ask for much more than this."
"O- Double IPA with an ABV of a American Pale Ale. Awesome session beer for the IPA drinker."
"O: Light, refreshing, and lots of flavor in this very drinkable pale ale. Hoppy but not a hop bomb. Another light but flavorful ale from Alpine."
"T: Somehow, the taste is just as good as the smell. A hint of mango and then a big hit of citrus and slightly piney hops. Some caramel malts balance the hops before they can get too bitter and the finish has just a touch of pine hop resin. A picture perfect pale ale. Must get more."
"Overall: About as perfect as a pale ale can be. Absolutely loved this beer and now I am kicking myself in the ass for not getting a growler of the stuff"
"D - I could drink this everyday. One of the best beers I've had from Alpine! And that says a LOT! Perfectly made!"
"Overall, just incredible. This is what every pale ale should aspire to. I could session the hell out of this if the ABV were under 4.00% and I were legally allowed to do so by British law."
"Reviewed from growler into tulip. Pours a dark gold or light orange with a fairly bubbly white head. The smell is much fainter then I had expected and really had to stick my nose in it, pun intended. Smells sweet citrus and almost musty. The taste far over powers the smell, there is a floral bite with a tangy citrus. Good cabonation with a fairly dry sticky finish. Great beer, absolutely perfect sitting out enjoying the outdoors."
"Overall: This is pretty damn good. There are four pale ales I find worth my time, every time. Zombie Dust edges out Hoppy birthday on my personal favorite list, with Daisy Cutter and Alpha King tied for a distant third. That is splitting hairs, though, this is another win for Alpine. You can trust them to do right by the hop gods."
"Pours clear, light to medium copper in color. A somewhat rocky white head slowly falls back to a ring, lacing my pint glass. Incredible hop aroma, a mix of citrus and sweet berries, ripe sugary sweet grapefruit like you'd find where its grown, not bought from a supermarket. Tangerines, oranges, grass, hay, and some light sugar sweetness in the aroma as well, one of those hoppy beers where you are continually sticking your nose into the glass to catch more of the aroma. Taste hits up front with some orange sweetness, cotton candy, grapefruit and grassy bitterness towards the finish. Light to medium body, bitterness is pleasing, not over the top, but just slightly puckering and dry to keep you thirsty, a perfect balance to the touch of malty body on the tongue. Crisp hoppiness with some zing left on the palate in the finish. This after 5 days across country in a growler, impressive pale ale, very sessionable, delicious."
"pours a light golden yellow. Very clear with a crisp white head. Nice lacing on the glass. Smells very hop forward. Some nice light citrus and floral aromas. Tastes fruity and lightly bittered. The body is fairly weak but well carbonated. A pretty solid pale ale but the body does not match the bitterness well..."
"O: What an awesome pale ale. I can't imagine making a better one-- truly Alpine doing what they do best."
"O: There are many things I love about this beer, but above all: this is truly identifiably a pale ale. It has a hop character, but I wouldn't take this for an IPA. The malt really has strong control over the flavor experience. A wonderful combo of pine nut malt and light bitter floral hops is outstanding. This is a member of the nobility of the summer time session ale kingdom. A very fancy pale ale, but humble with simplicity. Incredible execution here by Alpine."
"The perfect pale ale. It's astounding that so much hop flavor, aroma, and character is packed in to this sessionable, pitcherable, gulpable 5.25% pale ale."
"Drink- Simply put DAMN! I want to drive down to Alpine and get another couple growlers after A generous BA had this at Clusterfork #6"
"What an outstanding pale. Despite its BIG hoppy flavor, the brew retains drinkability. Good to the last drop, yo."
"A very good beer, wouldn't say its deserving to be in the top 100, but the way the brhos changed the list, rare and one time new releases are bound to jump into the list at the expense of more time tested and available stuff. I'd put it midway through my top 10 pales."
"Poured into a Jester King snifter and I can smell the motherfucker already. Pours golden with some haze along with a bright white head with a stream of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Smells of citrus hops a plenty and this translates beautifully into the taste. Lost of bright citrus with no malt. Mouthfeel is perhaps a touch thin, but if these other assholes were not drinking this with me, I would drink all 64oz. myself, just kidding, but not really."
"Medium lighter body, decent carbonation, dry and refreshing while drinking. This is easily the best super hopped session ale I've had, and it easily surpasses stuff like SD County Session, GF Citra, and others. I wish I could have this all summer."
"Beer is light in body, very hoppy, the malt lead off is nearly non-existent. It is very nice, bitterness is about 60 IBU thereabouts, great finish, overall a superb beer. I'd have it again, and again."
"O - Awesome beer, great to drink pretty much anytime, anywhere. Wish I could get this regularly, awesome."
"O: Amazing, just an amazing beer. I absolutely love Alpine."
"O: This beer is unlike anything I've ever drank and is another huge success from Alpine. They packed so much flavor into a small APA package which combines for the most flavorful borderline-session beer I've ever had."
"Have had this on tap more times than I can count on my hands and toes. The color is golden, slightly bronzed, and always carries a nice frothy airy white head. The smell to me is more of a green, earthy smell, with only a tiny bit of citrus hiding in the background. The hop flavor over the palate is spicy, slightly juicy, again just a touch of fruit or citrus. This is not a sweet/bright/citrusy/tropical beer. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side as to be expected. Being a somewhat small-batch beer, it varies a bit from time to time but it's usually a must get anytime we see it."
"O - A really nice APA, expertly hopped and infinitely drinkable."
"O - Fantastic stuff; this is what APA, and hop-centric, should aspire to be."
"4.5/3/2/4/3"
"As I texted to Ryan011235 that I was drinking this my auto correct took over and I sent ""Choppy Birthday"". I stand by that moniker, I think its more accurate. I'm not sure why this one is rated so high... Oh yeah! Its a new Alpine tap only! Duh!"
"Smells grassy with a shot of grapefruit. Definitely San Diego style. Taste hits you with a dry, full bitterness at first but after your tastebuds are shot you can start to get all the hop flavor. Lots of grassy grapefruit and citrus peel. Reminds me of making a hop tea. It's like they boiled this thing, took all the hops they used and squeezed out all the wort from them and fermented that instead. A tiny bit of toasty caramel to relieve your tongue. Low to moderate carbonation makes you think the beer is a little thicker than it actually is."
"The mouthfeel is equally as good, full and meaty with lots of carbonation. Overall, this is one of the best surprise beers I've ever had. It completely blows any other APA out of the water, and there are some really good APA's out there."
"Medium-thick body with soft carbonation and a pleasant lingering dry hoppy finish. Sweet and juicy ripe tropical fruits dominate from the start and dominate throughout. Amazing. Again, maybe not a great APA per style, but an incredible beer regardless. This growler was ~2-3 weeks old; fresh this would have to be near perfect"
"The beer appears straw yellow and slightly hazy. The head is thick and white, displays lasting retention, and leaves ample lacing on the tulip glass. The aroma...wow. One of the best aromas in a pale ale I have ever experienced. This would give any IPA more than a run for its money. Fresh hops and a blast of varied citrus. The flavor is absolutely phenomenal. This is perhaps the most drinkable and enjoyable <6% beer I have had the pleasure to sample. Perfect? Ya, pretty much. My highest recommendation."
"Massive thanks goes out to mikesgroove for sharing this one at an impromptu Hobo Tasting #7 which turned out to be a good time in an Ingles parking lot out of the trunk of my Audi with my AR-15 in-check to keep the haters out! Served from growler into a Stone nonic. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and a very subtle roastiness. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew just plain excellent in all aspects. I have been wanting to try this one for QUITE some time and glad that I finally was able to. The nose on this one was nothing short of excellent. The flavor, well balanced and excellent in all aspects. If you haven't gotten your hands on this one before it is definitely worth seeking out. You won't regret it!"
"Overall one of the best, most drinkable IPA’s I have ever come across. This was just nuts. I would like to see someone do better than this, incredible light offering that seems it was made to be shared!"
"D: This hop-forward pale ale is a tour-de-force, bringing a showcase of West Coast hop flavors into effortless balance with malt, acidity, and a texture that drinks more easily than water. Most comparable to Strand's excellent 24th St. pale ale, Hoppy Birthday is as sharp and presentable an American pale ale as any currently brewed."
"Very good beer that I would love to have again."
"Hoppy Birthday is a nice dark amber color with a finger of snow white foam atop it. The head recedes leaving some decent lacing. The nose is distinctly hoppy and hempy. Definitely more like an IPA than a pale. Smells fantastic! The taste is bitter hops with muted biscuity malt. There is a faint citrus presence accompanying the bitterness that moves this APA dangerously close to IPA territory. The malt does a great job of balancing the bitterness mid-palate and the finish is dry and bitter without lingering too long. Very nice. Feel is medium bodied with an excellent level of prickly carbonation. Wow! I likey! At 5.2% Abv I could enjoy this in copious amounts on a regular basis. Yet another incredible Alpine Ale that I wish was bottled and available year round. Highly recommended!"
"O - This is another near perfect example from the folks at ALpine. IMO they consistently mark the standard for West Coast hoppy ales. Delicious and well crafted flavors that play perfectly with each other."
"Pours a super clean golden amber with a large white head that lingers. Looks fantastic. Stronger hops come off the nose than expected, pine and resin, maybe a touch of lemon. So far so great. This beer is more straight forward bitter than any APA I've ever had. Really smooth, with a more generic hop bitterness than the nose implies. Thicker than expected in the mouth, in a very pleasing way, with solid carbonation. They did a great job disguising a 5.25% ABV beer in the mouthfeel as something bigger. To me, that is an impressive feat. Aggressive bittering hops limit the drinkability slightly as an APA, but yet it otherwise presents itself as a 6-7% ABV beer, increasing the drinkability quite a bit with its lower ABV. Really, one of the best 2-3 APA's I have ever had."
"A fresh growler provided by Alex, drank from a Cigar City snifter... The body is a bright dark clear gold with a beautiful off-white head. The head rises a few fingers and settles with a nice cap, decent lacing. Crystal colors and contrast, looks great... The aroma is very sharp, at the most basic level its a mixture of catty/dank and sweet amarillo like hops. Other notes of pine and lemon, very good. Its sweet but dank... The taste isn't as sweet as the nose, more of steady hops throughout, not super bitter though. Light grapefruit on the front. This is an apa that tastes like an ipa but drinks like an apa. Has to be one of the most flavorful drinkable 5% beers out there. The aroma is outstanding, well worth trying. The aroma is more of 4.75 and taste is more a 4.25."
"D - As Jason would say, this is ""absolutely crushable""! Another winner from Alpine!"
"D - Wow...just....wow. An awesome APA and right up there with RR Parking Violation. Drinks like an IPA without the ABV. Must get more and if you haven't had it yet, please get you some. A must-try."
"Pours a slightly hazy, bright amber color with a two-finger, frothy white head. Head retention is very good, as is lacing. Tropical fruit and citrus really shine in the nose, with pineapple, tangerine and mango notes coming through. There's a nice cracker and caramel malt aroma underneath the hops. The taste is much the same, with pineapple, mango and tangering fruit flavors melding nicely with a substantial cracker malt with a slight caramel sweetness. Alcohol is unnoticeable. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Drinkability is off-the-charts here - this really hits everything I look for in a sessionable beer. The flavors are refreshing and interesting with a very nice balance, though, obviously, this leans to the hoppy side. Overall, another incredible hoppy beer from Alpine. Every time I try something new from this brewery, I am more and more impressed. This might nudge Alpine slightly ahead of Russian River as my favorite brewer for hoppy beers."
"Pours a clear, darker straw-gold color with minimal white head and a bit of lacing. The aroma isn't too powerful, but is slightly spicy with some bitterness in there. It is light-bodied with generally light carbonation. Taste-wise it is slightly bitter with some citrus and somewhat astringent pine. The aftertaste is bitter and somewhat yeasty too. Personally I thought this tasted really good at first, but I tired of it rather quickly. Seemed to be a bit too much yeast in it, and I suppose it didn't impress me overall. Not a bad beer, but it pales (pun, haha) to Alpine's other similar offerings."
"What a great American Pale Ale!"
"Oh, and I guess I forgot to mention it, but there's no malt character present, but given that this is a hoppy beer from Alpine, that description is rather unnecessary, isn't it? But I kid. There's a little bit of a light biscuit/cracker-like malt flavor, but it does nothing but provide a brief respite from a wonderful hop character. Thanks a lot, Chris. This makes 99% of the IPAs out there superfluous. I'd have to say this is one of my favorite Alpine beers yet, probably up there with Nelson and O'Brien's IPA. The last beer I drank a growler of, solo, in one sitting, was Younger. And that's very high praise."
"Pours a moderate yellow-orange color with a white head and some pretty good lacing. Nose brings forward some really nice tropical, floral, and citrus notes. It seems like they've crammed every single hop variety into this one and then balanced them all out perfectly. The taste is similar with some really well defined hop notes. I got the most out of the tropical hops, though Amyliz4 got more from others. This is just stupendously well done with a beautiful balance between bitterness and drinkability. This is probably the best APA that I have ever had. Thanks again, Mike--I really owe you one."
"Pours a golden haze with a white head with some nice lacing and tiny ropes of co2 rising to the top. Smells like STRAIT UP tropics....mango, pineapple, pommegranite???? So many awesome bright fruit smells along with a sweet piney aroma. Tastes light and maybe even a little too much so...for a beer of this size, there is a LOT going on in it. I'd put Nelson over this one but thats just MHO. ALSO I could drink this for days."
"Is there a better pale ale out there?"
"poured a golden orange with yellow highlights that had a half finger of head and left good lacing sticking to the glass. the aromas were just like most of other IPA's consisting of a great hop profile, pine, grass, citrus grapefruit, slight pineappple, and some good malt prssence. Upfront the hops and pine flavors were the stara with citrus grapefruit and slight pineapple co-stars. even though it was pretty hoppy the malts did come thru to balance out the hop bomb which was is really a pale ale;great job. the brew was light to medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a nice slight sweet but bitter hop crisp finish. it drank very good and IMO can become a epic session beer chiilin in the hot socal summer sun."
"I would call this an IPA for sure, and may be my new favorite Alpine IPA. They need to crank out batch after batch of this stuff; no longer on for tastes or growler fills in the tasting room."
"D - This was an all around delicious beer, like many of the Alpine beers. They really have hops down to a science. Congratulations on this lovely beer."
"How they achieved the level of hop complexity without any malt and very little weight or ABV is quite intriguing. I believe it is a Citron dry hopped APA, but presents more like an IPA."
"Overall: Really couldn't ask for more in beer. Easy to drink, lots of flavor, and a style that most people can enjoy. A must try. Cheers!"
"Flavor follows in an IPA Light kind of sense with a notable hop presence throughout, a citric flavor with a perky carbonation and a light grainy feel. A bit of warming suits this beer well as an initially thin feel becomes fuller and more robust. Finishes with a bit of hop infused orange malt tones, offering a smooth feel. Drink is solid but held in check by the one sided approach for a Pale Ale, quite dry and hoppy and perhaps out of balance, yet give me another.."
"D: This is one of my new Alpine favorites. So brutally hoppy, but so easy to drink (helped along by a moderate ABV)."
"D - I could drink this everyday. One of the best beers I've had from Alpine! And that says a LOT! Perfectly made!"
"Growler from ArthurPendragon. Thanks, old friend. The beer is a hazy, glowing yellow peach color. An inch of sudsy, frothy foam tops the body and retains nicely for the duration of the glass, which was admittedly brief. The first whiff displays huge tropical fruit and citrus hop aromas. Pineapple, papaya, a plethora of words that begin with P. Also mango maybe, which begins with M. Malt character is faint, possibly even imaginary. The taste is explosively hoppy yet quite dry and nuanced, with a light biscuit malt foundation barely perceptible beneath the hops. The hop flavors range from tropical fruit to fresh pine needles to juicy citrus. The body is light, but this has a ton of flavor. It finishes with a silky smoothness, only moderately bitter really, and with incredible balance. This is exceptional. Superlatives and Alpine seem to go hand in hand."
"Very nice bubbly mouthfeel. Tons of thanks to a generous benefactor. Managed to guzzle the entire thing through the Lost finale, which took the edge off a very underwhelming close to the series."
"The mouthfeel is dry and crisp, with an upper moderate level of carbonation. The drinkability is insane. Highly recommended. Though a pale ale in name, it's essentially an IPA. I hope they decide to brew this again. Awesome stuff."
