Aroma is unusually pronounced for a brown ale with tons of chocolate supported by roasty grains, dark coffee and just a hint of hops. Taste is mostly roasted chocolate/ semi-dark grains on the front end with a nice hop balance towards the finish. I may be getting hints of oatmeal in the finish as well. The grains are so predominant that some can be picked out (brown malt, dehusked black, medium roast crystal, maybe some toasted oatmeal) and each one presents itself without muddling the others. I used to think HF was all about the IPAs but George makes me realize that Shaun Hill's dark beers should be as highly regarded as any of his other creations.

Based off the description, I was hoping this would be a hop forward version, but it's very true to style. Nutty malt dominated the flavor, and the hops round everything out. Hazy brown in appearance, with cascading bubbles rising to the surface. About a finger of fluffy white head when poured and the mouth feel, with the amount of carb in this beer, really helped to push the flavor. Smelled like every other brown ale. Not a huge fan of this style, but based off of all the brown ales I've had, this was by far the best tasting.","Davepoolesque","Apr 07, 2014"

4.03,-2.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"George is brown, like the style would suggest. He's acually veering towards black with a silky liquid look. A nice puff of tannish/brown foam up top leaving some. Smell is rich with a nice toasted malt base and there is a blast of fresh hops. Some sweet scents with brown sugar and a hint of smoke. Bread with warming. This is quite full of flavor, normal browns don't get this involved. Tastes of roasty/toasty malt with a hit of citrus hops, surrounded by some nuts, smoke, brown sugar and some earthy flavors. I like the body on this, it's richer and fuller than most browns. Nicely carbed, not dead in any way with a full aftertaste that does not linger to long. A nice drinkable brown ale that is good for two glasses or so, not boring.","BARFLYB","Jan 31, 2012"

3.73,-9.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured a murky chestnut brown with a decent off-white head that left a bit of soapy lacing. Aroma of nuts, grains and tea-like herbs. Nuts and brown sugar in the taste, roast and bitter cocoa, pine and herbal hops, grassy, with a bit of a wet cardboard sensation that isn't too out of place for the style in general. Better than many brown ales I've had. Medium body, a bit chalky, but still decent overall.","Rifugium","Jan 14, 2012"

Maybe my sniffer is operating under less than full capacity, but I don'g get anything at all. Very muted nose indeed. I don't know what it is I'm tasting, but I'm not digging it at all. Very roasty with some dark fruit going on. Figs, plub, cherries. A bit smoky. Yeah, not my bag. The mouthfeel is the bright point here. Smooth, highly carbed, with a slightly bitter finish. Overally, this is a rare miss for HF where I'm concerned. I just didn't think this came together very well.","Retail1LO","Jan 13, 2012"

4.2,1.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"One of the most interesting brown ales that I have had the chance to try, and I am very glad that I did. Hill Farmstead hits a delicate balance of an over-bittered brown ale that didn't just turn into a dark IPA, and their ability to infuse the citrus with the coffee and raisin bread character of the beer is nothing short of masterful.","NittanyBeerFan","0"

3.36,-18.4,4,3,3.5,4,3,"D - The combination of brown ale and Columbus hops just doesn't work for me, and this is by far the least enjoyable beer I've had from Hill Farmstead. The flavor profile is exactly what you'd expect from the description, but the concept seems problematic. Oh well, even Mozart wrote the occasional bad piece - perhaps this beer would pair nicely with the Flute & Harp Concerto K. 299.","MasterSki","Dec 12, 2011"

The smell is earthy floral hops up front with a nice roasted and sweet malt finish. The flavor is pretty similar to the smell with there being a bit more than expected hop profile. The malts come about a bit more as the beer warms up. The mouthfeel on this beer is medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall this beer is refreshing and very drinkable. Shaun said the next batch has had the hops toned down a bit, can't wait to try it.","rowingbrewer","Nov 26, 2011"

4.2,1.9,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a clear, dark mahogany with ruby tinged color with a massive frothy cream colored head. Finger thick bubbly head throughout with thin sticky sheets of lacing. Pleasant aroma of brown sugar, molasses, roast malt, earthy hops and light coffee. Strong roast malt flavor in the body with brown sugar and cocoa but the sweetness is well balanced by pine and grassy hops. Dry and bitter finish with a silky light medium body and soft carbonation. A brown ale is a brown ale is a brown ale (generally), but I enjoyed this compared to most and thought the mild bitterness of the hops added a unique turn to this.","yourefragile","Nov 21, 2011"
