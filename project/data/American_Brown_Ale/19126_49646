Aromas of mocha sweet and bitter forward, with a cream backbone, subtle nut sweetness, and roasted notes. Smooth and balanced nose. Flavors are nut sweet forward, with that bittersweet mocha coffee flavor right behind in the backbone. Creamy highlights help blend everything together, and with the subtle roast and char notes, this balances out nicely. Light and smooth in mouth, with a candy sweet aftertaste of nut, chocolate, and subtle coffee bitters. Smooth, slightly lingering finish.

Strong enough to have some bite when 1st tasting every time, yet keeps delivering for each one. Alcohol content is enough for you to know you're drinking this beer at half a bottle. Does not loose it's flavor as temperature changes. Great to grill with. It's that ""I've got this beer you've got to try"" when entertaining.

3.71,-2.1,5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"From my home tap, this one looks gorgeous in the glass, with a warm, reddish, deep-but-still-translucent medium brown color and capped by a thick, foamy, tan head that clings to the glass after every sip. The aroma is likewise thoroughly enticing, with a dry, bittersweet chocolate character and a bit of minerality. The flavor is similarly only slightly sweet, with a slight bready sweetness creeping into the mostly dry, roasty, chocolaty profile. The flavor is also a bit grainy and astringent, however, especially in the aftertaste, which detracts from the nice balance of flavors. The light body and light carbonation helps it all go down smoothly, though. Overall, this one doesn't slide too far to either the sweet or the bitter sides of the spectrum, making it an easy-to-drink yet flavorful brown ale","devilben02","Jan 22, 2012"

It pours a somewhat transparent warm brown with a fairly thick and fine-bubbled tan head. Flavor does not quite live up to the aroma, having malty, caramel and cinnamon notes but a bit of a metallic tang and a bitter undertone that is not hoppy. Texture has average body and only a little fizz. Well, maybe this bottle came from a not-so-hot batch. A decent ale nonetheless. Give it a try.","Cyberkedi","Jan 20, 2012"

I also just like Lone Rider, even though this and Shotgun Betty are really their two best at the moment. Still, if you are in the Raleigh or Durham, NC area and have to visit a tavern- go to Big Boss. Big Boss's ales (especially the stuff like the ""wooden monkey"" (they made these for a while then stopped- why?) and ""sneak attack"" (a short run) are awesome- even though they don't have them on tap at the tavern.

3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Okay, got this on tap at Icehouse. Nice color -- brown -- fitting. Nice head and good lacing. The smell was okay. Probably the only lacking characteristic. The taste was pretty good. Nice layering and super subtle. Nothing overpowering anywhere. Nice blend. The mouthfeel was the same with good carbonation. Overall, this was a really a pretty good brown.","MayLattimore","Apr 28, 2011"

Very smooth mouthfeel with exeptional sweet taste. This is a very exceptional well balanced brown ale. I look forward to lonerider expanding their beer portfolio. Awesome beers guys.","asrte76","Apr 17, 2011"

3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"On tap at Sticks and Sones in Greensboro.Poured from the tap into a standard pint glass a deep roasted chesnut brown with some ruby tinge,a 1/2 finger beige colored head atop.Aromas were a little light with chocolate malts mainly sticking out with light roastiness as well.Well rounded on the palate with sweetish chocolate and a hint of brown sugar,firm graininess and light earth in the finish to keep it balanced.A pretty rich tasting brown,one of the better browns I have had in a while I gotta say.","oberon","Mar 12, 2011"
3.33,-12.1,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Had this in the bottle at a friends house. He's a big Lonerider fan, which I am still trying to understand. Maybe he met a girl there. Or a girl works there that he likes. Who knows. Anyway, it had a nice deep brown appearance. No real head to speak of. Lots of brown sugar in the smell. I will say that the smell matches the flavor. Okay body with a little carbonation. I hear this beer won a gold. Not sure if it was this one or not. My friend has a tendency to talk up Lonerider. But it was an okay brown. I may have to disagree with him a bit and give it a better than average ranking.","SFrankBrew","Beers"

3.77,-0.5,3.5,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Clear, deep brown color with a thin, creamy off-white head. Nutty caramel malt and chocolate aroma...hint of maple and brown sugar. Sweet cocoa and caramel malty flavor with a touch of earthy hops in the finish. Pretty well balanced, though not as smooth as I'd like. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, and a bit drying. A well made, standard brown ale.","wedge","Feb 27, 2011"
3.72,-1.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D- a decent brew and it would be worth a purchase no doubt. I am leary of the chocolate and coffee not complementing each other in flavor rather than nose.","Dodo2step","Feb 20, 2011"
4.3,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Dark brown in color with a nice fluffy textured head. Lot's of sticky lacing lines the sides of the glass as it empties. Interesting aroma. Toasted malts, mixed nuts and a hint of pine trees. Wow this is good. Think caramel biscuits with some bite. I'm pretty sure it's the hops that is giving it the bite but I can't quite place the flavor. It's kind of an earthy spicy hop. This is really good and my review doesn't give it justice. Good crisp mouthfeel and very quaffable. I'm very impressed with the 2 beers I've had from Lonerider and look forward to trying more.","wcudwight","Feb 20, 2011"

2.99,-21.1,3,4,2.5,2.5,3,"On tap at the ""hideout", which is an old warehouse converted into a brewery. Tanks everywhere its quite a site to see. Pour is dark brown with a thin tan head. Aroma is chalked full of roast, chocolate malts and hazelnut. Flavor really follows suit. Light buttery presence that really doesnt mesh well","NCD","Mar 07, 2010"

Very nice maltly flavor that is balanced well with a little touch of hops. Mouthfeel is light, but it does not take away from the drinkablity.

3.89,2.6,3,4,4,3.5,4,"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint-glass a crisp dark brown with a thin diminishing tan head. Aroma is a decent amount of caramel, burnt toast and slight brown sugar. The taste is a decent amount of brown malts, brown sugar and slight Earthy hops. The beer is on the light side of medium with decent carbonation. This is a very enjoyable brown ale, I hope LoneRider keeps the new beers coming!","atsprings","0"
