This time, the two-plus fingers of head were a dense, light-brown with good retention. I was reminded of the top of a coffee or mocha ice cream cone. Nose definitely gave off raisin and a smoky roastiness, hence their suggestion for smoked cheeses. Color was mahogany (SRM = > 22, < 27) with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was creamy and the taste was chocolaty with raisins and smoke. It was like a Cadbury Fruit and Nut chocolate bar. Finish was semi-sweet, with the roasted malt offsetting the chocolatiness and the fruitiness. This was one that need not be thought of a a seasonal, but it would have been nice to have paired it with some of their suggestions. Maybe next time ...","woodychandler","Jun 13, 2014"

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 9/24/2013. Pours very hazy deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toffee, chocolate, cocoa, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, floral, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/toasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, cocoa, chocolate, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, floral, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, cocoa, chocolate, nuttiness, biscuit, toast, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/toasted malt flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice brown ale! All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 02, 2013"

Poured red-brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, toasted malt, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, powdered chocolate, milk chocolate, and nutty. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I had never heard of this brew before until I saw it this night. So I really didn’t know what to expect at all. What I found actually wasn’t too bad for the style. A lot of the right components were present, but it was a little too sweet with the chocolate aspect going on in the flavor to stand out in the style. If that was toned back slightly it could have been a pretty good brew. Worth your time trying if you get the opportunity to do so.","thagr81us","Dec 26, 2012"

I was concerned that the flavors would bring a grainy sensation, but this was not the case. The flavors changed in the aftertaste to a molasses and slightly nutty flavor.

3.58,-2.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a good and solid American Brown Ale. This Brown Ale had much more roast then most Brown Ales, which made it more fitting for it's winter release but I feel like some additional hops in the flavor and the aroma would help make this beer more balanced and less one note. This beer has good drinkability, I could drink two or three of these in a sitting, it went down smooth and had enough flavor to hold my attention. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the taste, this beer looked real nice and the flavor stuck out from most Brown Ales due to it's heavy roast which I liked and I thought was fitting. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of hops in the flavor and aroma, it needed about twice as much hops in both to stand up to all those roasty malts. I would buy this beer again when looking for a roasty Brown Ale for the winter season. I recommend giving this beer a try, it's not the most complex Brown Ale, but the roast lends a nice flavor that makes it stick out a little. I was glad I got a chance to try this one and I think it is a pretty fitting American Brown Ale for those cold Michigan winter nights. New Holland comes through with another solid beer, keep up the good work guys.","StoutHunter","Jan 07, 2012"

Pours a very nice velvet texture with a brown ruby highlighted huee with a big khaki tan head forming thick. Fine speckled lacing scattered sporadically. Aroma has a nice fruity roasted malt character going on, slightly nutty with some hints of dark chocolate. A touch of alcohol in both the nose and the palate. Flavor is a bit astringent with alcohol and dark roasted malts bring out a hint of raisin and mild dark chocolate notes. Finishes dry with some herbal hop finish, maybe a hint of pine. Mouthfeel is medium bodied moderate carbonation with a fittingly dry finish not overly sweet enough hops and alcohol to balance out the malt sweetness. Overall maybe one of the better beers out of their seasonals up in New Holland, I'm typically not crazy about their beers but this isn't half bad.","WVbeergeek","Jan 01, 2012"

Very small on the nose with some carmel notes and a little nutty. Was wanting a bigger hit with the aroma. Taste was similar to the nose, but this is where it came up a little short. Does not have that complex brown malty, nutty taste I like in a ABA. It does go down smooth for 6+% ABV, but a little weak on the taste. Feel is okay for a brown. A bit of cream and some carbonation with a very small sting of hops on the tongue. Overall- Not a bad brown, but not spectacular. Like how smooth it is and the limited hops profile.

Even after pouring, the aroma remains a bit yeasty, but this aroma had a minimal impact on the taste. The malt flavor is strongest, accented by mild hops, just about right for a brown ale. The malt is a bit chocolatey. Overall, the taste is on the bitter side. The feel in the mouth is quite bubbly.","ribby","Dec 28, 2009"
3.72,1.4,3,3.5,4,3,4,"Deep mahogany body topped by a late-rising, parchment colored head. The head didn't form until well after the bottle was emptied. It then quickly fades to little more than a few scattered large bubbles around the edge of the glass. Aroma is almost all malt, heavy on the molasses and brown sugar. A touch of fresh bread in there a swell. Just a hint at herbal hop aromas intermingled with all the sweetness. Flavor pretty much follows the nose - blackstrap molasses, caramelized sugars, a touch of anise. The bitterness is almost disguised as carbonation - almost like carbonic acid rather than hop bitterness. But in the age of the over-the-top IPA (which I love) this is a great break from what has become the norm to some of us. Each successive sip reveal more layers of malt and sugar. Tastes like a really hearty beer. A little more body would have been great, but at cellar temps it may have gotten cloying if it had more presence in the body. Drinkability is very good, if you like malt. A very nice offering.","aaronh","Dec 20, 2009"

Finishes clean with a hint of dryness and that's about it. Not a bland beer, but just a run-of-the-mill brown to be honest.

This beer is great for the Vanilla Porter and sweet stout fans out there. Has just enough all spice to remind that it's a winter beer.

3.4,-7.4,3,3,4,3,3,"An intriguing brown ale for sure. From the pour, you would swear you were looking at a glass of coke - the color is strikingly similar and the head dissipates to a cola-like set of bubbles. I get a lot of butterscotch on the nose of this one, intermingled with some slight metallic notes, and definitely some brown sugar/molasses. I'd say the body is medium-heavy, and the carbonation is plentiful, perhaps a little too much. I usually think of brown ales as having a smooth mouth feel. This one is a little rough given the amount of carbonation. The flavor is quite interesting - a lot more complexity than your average English Brown. I get raisins, figs, molasses, toffee, plus some herbal notes that mingle together pretty dynamically. I'd be interested to know what yeasts they are using here. Kind of reminds me of a recent trip I made to the Ommegang Brewery in NY where I tasted a couple beers made with wild yeasts. There are definitely some wild, estery notes in this brew. Not quite sure where this one fits categorically, but it's an interesting beer to try. Maybe not one of my favs, but certainly worth sampling. Give it a shot if you're looking for something different.","sudsface69","Nov 30, 2008"

Apart from its caramel color, its aroma is even more apparant, almost butterscotchy in aroma and mixed with a prety decent amout of grapefruity hops. Not like any brown ale I've ever encountered, this one is American through and through. Rich, roasted caramel malt dominate the opening and everything keeps getting sweeter from there, hops seem to fall of a little bit from the nose. Beer closes overly sweet and grainy, almost cloying, would be almost unbearable if not for the soda like carbonation that keeps the beer bubbling just above the tongue. Not something I'd really want to reach for again, reminds me a bit of Atwater's beers, maybe I got a bad bottle, but the rest in teh 12 pack seemed okay. Just a bit dissapointed here.","bluemoonswoon","Nov 19, 2008"

It's like a moderate beer in a world of conservative and liberal beers.

Smells of chocolate waft towards my nostrils, as do caramel and toasted malts. A definite nutty quality mingles in the nose as well. Light chocolate and roasted malts meet in the taste, along with some earthy nuts and a small amount of dark fruitiness (like two raisins worth). Not much carbonation to effect this medium bodied offering in anyway. It bit more balance and strength would lend nicely to this fairly average brown ale.","Slynger","Jan 07, 2008"

4.05,10.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Brown Ales are the style of beers that I often overlook. Then when I taste one like this, I ask myself 'why?'. The beer begins with a firm, malty plop in the glass with a deep brown color and tan head formation that would prove to withstand until the end. Aromas of chocolate malt, light roasting / toasting, a milk-sugar sweetness, and pine-ey hops all promise great things in flavor. The taste takes on the same characteristics as in the aroma, with emphasis on the chocolate and malty flavors and textures. An unexpected peat-ey flavor and aroma begins to take hold as the beer warms, giving hte beer a lot of complexity and flavor. The hops are not as agressive in the flavor as in the scent, but work well to balance the sweetness. Body is a bit higher than medium, but not heavy, relying on a creamy base to cary the flavors. Finishes with a long linger of chocolate and earthy-dirty character.","BEERchitect","Dec 06, 2007"

Rye is definitely the base of this beer and provides ample backbone. Hops are abundant but not overpowering. They begin fruity like red delicious apples then turn more floral then spicy and finally finish bitter. Body is decent, not real big but really makes this beer drinkable. Went great with the pizza.
