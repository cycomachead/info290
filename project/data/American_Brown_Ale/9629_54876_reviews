"Feel - appropriately carbonated, hard for me to get over the taste"
""

"Pours the color and thickness (or thin) of black plain coffe.  Head dissipates quick.  Smells hoppy.  Tastes hoppy for a brown ale, but I think it was supposed to.   Overall a decent beer but nothing I would go out of my way for."

"Overall: A well-done version of a hoppy brown ale."

"Overall - Solid, if not really interesting."

"One of the best brews from Short's. I really recommend this one to anyone who is a fan of Brown ales"

"Dark brown pour - ruby red where the light passes through on the edges - with a thin, soapy head. Aroma of brown sugar, chocolate and even a little bourbon. Tastes like brown bread with raisins, very light coffee roast & bitterness. Warm, fairly boozy finish. Pretty good for a brown ale, but brown ales aren't really the greatest to begin with."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/22/2013. Pours slightly hazy ruby brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, caramel, toast, brown sugar, chocolate, coffee, light nuttiness, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, brown sugar, toast, cocoa, light coffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, floral, grass, pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, cocoa, brown bread, light coffee, light nuttiness, floral, pine, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roast malt flavor with moderate hop presence; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial brown ale. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roast malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"O - Decent beer. Nothing bad, nothing great. Would drink again, bu wouldn't seek out."
""
""

"This is an odd beer, which I suppose shouldn't surprise me from Short's. It's like they throw all kinds of stuff in a blender to see if it works, and if it doesn't work they throw some other stuff in a blender. Occasionally they get hits, but often they get oddballs like this one."
""
""
""
"Ya feel me, my peeps?"
"O-good dry hopped brown ale could use more complexity"
""
""
""
"Overall: I like the hint of sweetness and i wish there was more of it. I don't like the hops and roasty malt combination outside of stouts. Also a little bit weak on flavor for so strong of alcohol"
""
""
"O: This is a phenomenal brown that may become a six-pack purchase for me in the future."
""
""
""
""
""

"Outstanding, well done.  Thank you Short's"

"I really enjoyed this beer. The color of slightly dark chocolate. Perfect mouthfeel. Not highly carbonated but by no mean thin or flat. This is hoppier than most browns I've had but it's not overdone. Taste is a nice balance of the hops and a mild combo of brown sugar and caramel. I saw the ratings here and didn't have high expectations but this definitely surpasses them."
""
"O: Nothing too special here. Basically, it's just a decent, easy drinking brown ale the does a good job of belying its alcohol content. I wouldn't seek this out, but I'd gladly kill this six pack with minimal effort."

"O - This is a really impressive double brown ale. It is a must try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty decent. I'm not sure when Shorts comes to Boston, but I always catch them months later with a few straggling singles in a liquor store I haunt too infrequently as of late. So, when I see it, I grab it. Not a typical brown, and pretty decent."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This isn't a bad beer, but it sure isn't anything exciting. Glad I tried it once, but I won't seek another out. Quintessentially forgettable."
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Good Humans is a deep amber-brown color with a very thin, cream colored head. Nose is surprisingly malt forward with hops being barely discernible. Malt nose includes chocolate, caramel, roasted coffee and toasted bread. Hops come through much more in the flavor but are still only to balance the strong malty backbone. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected with a velvety carbonation. Overall a good beer, could be a little stronger on the hops but definitely solid."

"Overall: A nice ABA from a brewery that comes to Boston a few months of the year. Yeah, I'm happy with this one too."
"Thanks to DrewShal9 for the trade!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is an interesting beer. I had recalled earlier tastes of this beer having a pronounced hop component. When I first tasted this particular Good Humans I got a ton of chocolate and hop significant hops. As I mentioned earlier, once I finished a third of the beer the hops made their presence known. This is one on the more enjoyable beers that I have had from Shorts."
"O - An interesting variation on a brown ale, but not necessarily something that I would go out of my way to seek again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, I'm surprised by this one. The Short's normal beers don't seem to do anything special and are usually fairly lackluster. And I wasn't expecting a dry hopped brown ale to do anything nice, but this is well balanced, not too bitter, nice profile of both hops and malts that seem to somehow play off each other, since I think they picked the hops and malts well."
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer is hot and boozy in my opinion. I usually feel brown ales are easy drinking and smooth as this one seems to be but its just slightly on the boozy side. Not one to gravitate to, but one I liked at one point. For some reason this bottle is not doing it for me. Better luck next time cheers!"

"12oz bottle. Deep amber with a frothy light mocha head. This retains with a creamy richness, leaving sticky swathes of lacing behind. The aroma smells leafy with green citrus, cocoa and roast all mixing together to give the nose a fresh ripe twang. The taste is fresh ripe citrus with a firm bitterness at its core. Tropical and herbal notes hang on the edges while a malty backbone of cocoa sweetness and roast flavor that leave a touch of char lingering in the finish along with some leftover green bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium with a firm creaminess that spreads out. This is pretty easy going in the mouth overall with just a touch of warmth to the proceedings. This was a more than serviceable take on the hoppy Brown Ale style with a good bit more going on with it than I expected. The really easy drinkability for 8% helped as well. Glad I picked a bottle up."

"The mix of hops and brown ale malts works for me but the malt flavors actually are my favorite part of this beer. A good hazel-nutty, leathery and caramel cocoa feel to them, good stuff."

"O- I love unique beers and this didn't disappoint. I don't really like brown ales but I dig anything that highlights hops. This is a beer that is great to try but I can't see buying a 6 pack. Great beer, very unique, enjoyable. Thanks shorts"
""
"This is a dry hopped double brown ale, which to me means ""a lot of different things in one bottle."" It's complex and enjoyable, but it's hard to get a grip on everything going on in each sip; maybe that's a good thing…. Well done, Short's."

"A unique as hell brown ale ... really tastes like it was blended with an IPA, and it has a flavor I'm not sure I'll find in another brown ale. Good Humans has an aroma that I'd like to forget (I'm not sure why I'm smelling what I am)... but at least the taste and mouthfeel shine. The beer has got an unusual name and label, but it has a flavor that any beer geek ought to try. Unique. That's what best describes Good Humans."
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth for 8% with lots of flavor and very drinkable."
"This beer has a slight bitterness upfront with a light touch of the straw and grassy hop notes but it’s balanced by a gentle malty sweetness along with a hint of maple. It’s an interesting beer that stakes out a different style and makes it work in the process. A great winter seasonal sipper, regardless of when its available."

"Strange brew, as are many coming off of Shorts' line, but this one hits the mark pretty well. Is it an IPA? Is it a brown ale? Why can't it be both? I didn't know how a double-brown dry hopped beer would be, but the caramel flavors from the malt mix and the jungle flavors from the hops play nicely together."
"This is a big but very drinkable beer I loved it, but there were a few issues that kept it from greatness."
""
""
""
""
"O- pretty tasty brown ale. More hazelnut, nuttiness than most others but still has nice flavors and bitterness."
""
"I really do like the nose on this one. Really nice hop influence going on. Overall, the hops really do stick with the beer on this one, providing a constant influence that clearly speaks of dry hops. A different take on brown ales that works out pretty nicely."

"M - Medium body with moderate carbonation."
"Overall: decrease appearance and mouthfeel and increased taste and overall"
"This beer pours a lighter bodied dark amber in color with a slight off white lacing. It smells of slightly smoked malts and raisins. It's definitely on the malty side. The flavors are dry and hoppy with a nice malt backbone. I'm glad the hops are present here since they were absent in the nose. The flavor builds with time as well. It drinks light in body with a nice after taste. Overall this is a solid brown. I'm glad I could try it."
""
""
""
"O:Overall, I'm pleased with this offering from Shorts. I really thought they did a good job with this brown ale. Really goes well with the season. Decent beer worth a try."
""
""
"Overall nothing really bad to say about this except maybe could use more roasty or nutty flavors. Kind of drinks more like a mildly hoppy amber ale if you ask me (nugget nectar like...)"
""
"Poured out a nice dark carmel color. Pretty typical for Browns. Loved the Dry Hoppped flavors. Good cure for boring browns. The smells doesn't give you a whole lot but it does have a good carmel smell with just a bit of flower in there from the Hops. Very sweet smell. Probably one of the best tasting beers I've ever had. Didn't expect it given the smell. Very smooth given the high alcohol content."
""
""
"O: Higher than I expected. Tasty and quenching. A very solid and respectable session brown with hopitude."
"Had this one after a few while downtown in Ann Arbor. Pours dark cloudy brown with not much head. Smells of booze, roasted grain, piney hops, some sweet molasses. Taste is pretty harsh, and I am not sure what they were going for here. Heavy burnt booze flavor, some bitter but not balancing, molasses, roast. Mouthfeel is a lot of booze, a little syrup, with low carbonation. This one was just unpleasant for me. Not a fan."
"Sharp tingly hop bite. Resinous and piney. Chocolate and toasted nut flavor follows. Some caramel malt sweetness. Very enjoyable. Reminds me of Ellie's Brown; maybe a little hoppier. Definitely hoppier in the nose. Alcohol had a kick on the palate. I rather enjoyed this one but I have a soft spot for hoppy brown ales."

"O: I'm not a fan of this beer. I don't know if it's been sitting for too long, or if this is how it's supposed to taste. I have had a lot of bad luck with Shorts' beers in the past, so I'm not surprised that this is yet another flunker."
"O - It's a bit sweeter than Bellaire Brown, which I honestly like. But I don't know how it holds up against some other Michigan browns. Not bad, though."
"O- Wonderful American brown ale. Rich, yet extremely drinkable. It's a great fall/winter brew. Higher ABV is deceptively well-hidden. It went really well with the considerable snow we received over the weekend."
""
""
""
"I certainly wish I could get this beer on a regular basis. Hopefully they will up their distro to OH someday soon."
"Overall this is a fairly decent brown ale. This is one of my least favorite styles but I still tried to rate accordingly. The ugly lifeless appearance and thin mouth feel knocked it down more than anything really."
"Overall: It infected and really give this beer a fair shot. I drain poured this beer and I don't do that very often."
"Overall, this is quite an interesting beer, and despite the fact that it a hoppy darker style ale, I enjoyed it. The hops really come through and make you forget that you're drinking a ""brown ale"" for a second, but the maltiness is there to help the balance throughout and create quite a pleasant flavor profile. Not something I need to revisit anytime soon, but pleasant enough"
"Overall: Really well made beer. Great earth and sweet combo of flavors. I've had other kinds of brews that aim to combine the two in the past. At best, they come out like this brew. At worst, they taste like dirt."
""
""
"Overall, this was a good brown ale, but not so much what I was looking for. It's surprisingly normal for a shorts beer, and while it's well crafted, it seems like it's aimed more towards making everybody happy. Somewhat fitting for a beer named Good Humans."
"O - The dry hopping is a nice addition to the brown ale base. Wouldn't mind seeing more hoppy brown ales."
"D: A big, robust, very tasty and very easy & pleasant drinking beer. It would be super easy to over do it with this one. It has a ton going on, but is just so drinkable and well crafted that the glass swiftly empties as you attempt to contemplate."
""
"Fresh bottle from Champagne's Cellar. This tastes a lot more hoppy than 19 ibu. More or less neutral aroma. Crowning white head on Brownish body with tons of lace at the end of a very drinkable brew. Grapefruit citrus taste, some herbal - lemongrass? A little sting on the palate."
"D and O: Review to style? This is a good brown ale, one of the better I have had in a long time. Very drinkable, even with the elevated ABV. The dry hopping goes nicely with a fairly well rounded brown ale."
"O: A very good double brown ale. While it's nothing spectacular, it's certainly one of the better brown ales I've had with plenty of drinkability. Another good Short's beer where I could sit back and have multiples without getting sick of the taste."
""
"O- A fantastic brew from shorts here. wish i could get this all the time in colorado"
""
"I am liking brown ales more and more. I really do think its an underrated style and can be done in many different varieties. I like the fact that this is a double brown ale and that its dry-hopped. I'd like to see more breweries stretching the boundaries of the classic styles."

"Thanks, FlandersNed, for the opportunity"
"O- This looked like it would be a total 'try it once and never think about it again' beer, but I was pleasantly surprised!"
"D: Easy drinking. Bigger hop presence was a nice addition to a rather standard brown. Try it"
"O- I really enjoyed this one, it brought something different to the style that in my opinion, improved upon it. Nice work Shorts."
"O - Very interesting. It is a nice hoppy sour ale."
"Very well done beer, but reading other reviews it appears that Short's quality control continues to be an issue with this beer as well. Very unique brewery, but very disappointing and unprofessional considering that scale and scope of their infection issues."
"O:"
"D - I couldn't get through my glass and had to pour it... it just wasn't enjoyable. I'm almost positive this was a bad bottle. Fortunately, there seems to be more positive reviews here than neutral/negative."
"O: Oddly, I've been more impressed with the 'regular' beers from Short's than their oddball, dessert beers. This is a prime example. Get this fresh and enjoy. Only Short's hit-and-miss QC make me reluctant to give this a stronger recommendation."
"O - If I'd be guaranteed a good bottle each time, I'd pick it up again. I know that they've had a run of issues with beers going sour, or infected at times... Not sure? Either way, worth a pick up though!"
"Taste is not what I expected from the smell – first it is sweet and malty, but that is followed by a lot of fruit (cherries and plums) and it finishes a little tart. Only a touch of bitterness, no real hop character. Although it is a winter seasonal and I'm drinking it on April 2, so the dry-hopped character may have faded a bit."
"Pours a hazy deep amber to a brown-ish color with a tan head. In the aroma, sweet roasted malt, with small notes of fruit and nuts. In the taste, a sweet roast and complimented with a nice sweet fruitiness and balanced back down with a dry nuttiness. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry fruit and nut aftertaste. Nice malt, and the fruitiness is really nice."
"This is a medium-bodied ale with adequate carbonation to add life without being spritzy. There's a bit of warmth, and the hops add a dryness to the body to result in a body that's overall semi-dry. Each sip goes pleasantly creamy and a nice complexity lingers in the finish."
"O: Almost a souped up gueze. I've read lots on here and other places about how Shorts beer have tons of quality issues: constant bottle infections, blah, blah, blah, etc., etc., etc. I'm not sure to believe these charges, or to just believe that the brewers at Shorts are just weirdos. Either way, this wasn't entirely a disaster and was BY FAR the most unusual brown ale I've ever tasted."
"O: This had the possibilities of an incidental oud bruin, but fell short. Either way, I wouldn't recommend it, based on the high probability of infection."
"O - Honestly, this beer isn't awful, I just find it lightly offensive between the over-the-top hop profile that's not balanced very well. Also, I'm not sure if the date is a production or best before (although the hops haven't faded it seems) but there seems to be some sort of bug in it. Lastly, the label calls it a double but there's no alcohol anywhere. Then again Short's excels at covering up alcohol levels."
"D - High -- very smooth, goes down quick."
"Overall: Not my style at all, but this is a great take on a brown. I'm enjoying this beer and happy I have another in the fridge. Regret not having it uber-fresh so I could enjoy the dry hops, but still very pleasant. Cheers."
"Probably the weak spot in the Short's lineup for me. It's good, but I've come to expect more."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was below average for me, the hoppiness was nice but that sugary sweet, tart fruity flavor hurt the beer overall for me. It just didn't seem to fit the beer style at all. As I said it seems like a flavor I get out of a lot of Short's beers. Not a terrible beer overall but not a great one either."
"Overall I thought this was a unique and good brown ale. I like this one a little more then Bellaire brown. It had all the great brown ale flavors I love but with a citrus hop twist that you don't get with many brown ales. This is a good beer that I feel could replace bellaire brown as a year round serving. Good unique brew shorts, just when I think I know just about everything about a style you guys put out something crazy like this and make me eat my words...Touche'"
"Thanks to hurfer for the extra. Poured from 12oz bottle (no date) into a snifter glass. Pours a reddish brown, deeper copper with decent haze, a decent sized khaki head that settles to a film that laces a bit. Aromas are brown malts and nut, toffee and tobbacco, some vanilla, faint cocoa, soapy grapefruit hops and floral come in, with a bit of rind and grass. Toasty bread and caramel mixes with a good hopping. Initial is well hopped up front, bitter and floral with a touch of soap moves into caramel and toffee, biscuits and toasty bread, tobbacco, brown malts, earthy hops mix with grapefruit and tougher florals on the backend, providing a nice contrast from sticky sweet malts and stronger hops with good acidics. Medium bodied, a firm bitterness counters the sweeter malts of cocoa and caramel. Finish is nutty, floral, and pine with mellow sweetness having final say on the tounge, and bitterness going down the throat. Tasty, a nice beer overall and I'm probably not quite giving it enough credit. Glad to have tried this one. A strong brown ale for the style and an interesting beer from a small local brewery."
"Drinkablity: Like most of these Short's beers, 12oz is plenty."
"This beer was just okay for me. I was really excited because it was a style I had never seen before and I love me some hops. It tasted like a beer a friend made using cheap equipment. You know the kind, you can taste the potential but the way it was brewed leaves it lacking. Not bad by any means, just not something I'd look for really hard."
"Swifty donated this to me. It's tasty and a style I've never had. Strong hop significance to a brown ale. It's pretty tasty. I mixed a porter and an ipa before and it sort of reminds me of that beer. It's darker in color reminiscent of a traditional brown ale. The smell is a little hoppy but does have a strong malt presence. The taste is good with caramel, oak and finishing with a nice bitterness balancing it out. Definitely a nice idea. It's pretty tasty with a nice aftertaste. It's exactly what you would think with a dry hopped brown ale and tastes like a mix of an ipa and a brown ale, and if you like either of those styles of beers, you will like this one too."
"Drinkability is limited by the odd sour flavors. Not at all what I expect in a brown ale."
"drinkability - has a very unique flavor profile but inconsistencies that bring out the flaws in the beer...or maybe intentional qualities"
"Drinkability: I'm not a huge fan of this one. I'm not sure if I got an old bottle or what, but the fruity flavor really turned me off."
"I find these Humans to be very drinkable. They are a great combination of a nutty, malty brown ale and a hoppy, citrusy pale ale. This is a tasty treat that I will enjoy much over the years."
"D - It's a good beer, but I'd only have one on account of the aforementioned stickiness I experienced upon finishing."
"To my mind, an excellent brew. Its a wonderful marriage of IPA and brown ale elements which i enjoy immensely. This pairing really seems like a great beer for hopheads and lovers of brown ales alike, as it offers a nice palate of both worlds. I recently gave one of these to a good friend who usually tends towards macro pilsners, and he loved it. I look forward buying another 6-pack before its next brewing :)"
"D- Not quite sure how much I'd seek this one out again."
"I'm guessing this is infected as the flavor is immediately artificially sweet, like orange and strawberry Starburst and finishes with an astringent sourness. Under that mess there is some nutty malt flavors, but still no hops. The more i drink, the less sure I'm that this is infected, but regardless I'm not enjoying this and will pour out the rest of the glass. Oh well."
"M/D - Almost like drinking sour candy. I received a BM from gnemesis who traded this my way saying it might be infected. After reading some other recent reviews, seems like maybe a bad batch hit shelves? They don't seem to jive with all the other reviews. If I get another chance to taste this (have another bottle, but it is likely the same batch) I will adjust my review accordingly."
"Drinkability: I was expecting a dry-hopped brown ale, and I got mild dark fruit and much hop presence. Maybe this was just a bad bottle based on the other reviews, but there was almost no hop presence."
"The mouth is light and carbonated well. This helps in drinkability quite. The flavors are different from standard Browns I've had. The citrus aspect carries over here as well, with flavors of lemon, orange and mild bitterness from the hops. The usual Brown characteristics are fleeting, if not absent. Some mild malty sweetness on the back end. This was a different take. I guess the more I have from these guys, the more I learn that they like to push the envelope a bit on the styles and ingredients. I'd have it again, I guess, but not when I'm looking for a Brown Ale."
"D - despite all the weird stuff about this beer, from the out-of-place hops, to the empty mouthfeel, to the funky sweetness, I think it is pretty drinkable. It's odd, but it's not offensive."
"Mouthfeel was a little bigger than I prefer, especially for a brown but because of the nice balance you could easily drink more than one or two."
"D_Very drinkable."
"Frankly dear, I don't give a Schlitz about Good Humans."
"Bottle courtesy of Erik, thanks! Poured into New Belgium globe, dark opaque brown with light tan one finger head that fades to a cap with some lacing. Smells sweet and resinous, roasted malts, some tobacco and hints of sour notes, slightly hoppy. Taste is interesting - a fruity sourness up front, slightly roasted malt, some coffee flavors, hazelnut finish. No alcohol Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Good drinkability for for a double brown, would be interesting to find out what the abv is."
"A really odd brown ale, and yet another Shorts brew with a tart/sourness. Makes me wonder if this is really what they are intending. I know they had some infections issues, but across different brews still? The experimentations maybe starting to hinder at this point."
"D- goes down very smooth. Nice drinkability"
"Drinks pretty good. I'd certainly have it again."
"D- This beer is drinkable not a problem. The ABV I would suggest is higher making it kind of a deadly combo with the drinkability. I don't think Short's really makes a beer that is great in the carbonation department which I expect from them. This alone makes it drop half a point in this category."
"D: Okay, but I wouldn't order again or buy six. Tasty, but only one for me."
"Altogether, it is a decent beer, but not great by any means."
"Pours into a brownish red colored body with a tan head that has good retention and some of the best lacing I have seen on a beer. The carbonation is also good on this one. The smell is a nice fruity smell, along with some hops, pine, toffee, some citrus too. Love the smell of this beer. The taste is of pine, coffee, chocolate folloed by some hops and citrus. It is not too strong in any tastes and is well balanced. The mouthfeel is a nice smooth medium body feel and this is so good and smooth that how could it not be a very drinkable beer?"
"drinks very well. variety of flavors are crafted together well. another good one from shorts."
"D- High. I would drink this a lot if I had it in my local stores. One of the better Am. brown ales out there, I'm loving the hop bite."
"This beer is very drinkable and tasty. I could drink multiple of these in one sitting, though the richness might fill me up after a bit. The verdict: Good Humans = good!"
"Overall- short's brewing always offers delectible liquid libations for all. to me this brew hangs in the middle. it's not bad at all but just lacks some punch. it's very easy drinking."
"Being a Michigan resident I feel obligated to try the Shorts offerings. I honestly have not been all that impressed except for their IPA."
"Overall: This beer smells like a pale ale, looks like a brown, and has bitter and roasted flavors. Very smooth and creamy, perfect amount of hops that are countered nicely. Easily drinkable, I hope the ABV isn't too high..."
"Poured a nice medium brown color with a nice off-white head that left good lacing on the side of the glass. It smells surprisingly hoppy. Also there are notes of lemon zest, a little roastiness, and floral hops. The taste is great. There is a nice earthy hop bite right up front. There is also some roastiness that is cut by some malty sweetness. There is also some alcohol notes that come in at the finish. The taste of this beer is pretty well balanced. The mouthfeel is good on this. It has a good medium body with nice carbonation. The drinkability is good on this. I could drink these quite often. This beer was a definite surprise. I have never had a brown ale like this before, and I hope to find more brown ales like this. If anyone knows any please recommend some to me! Anyways, all in all I thought this was a great beer. Good job Shorts. Cheers."
"Pours a nice caramel brown color bordering on chestnut. Nice white head and a bit of lacing. The nose is really nice, with some sweet and roasted brown malts along with some nice piney, floral, and earthy hops. Really love the concept, as this seems to be done differently than the typical hoppy brown. The taste scales back a bit with some slight bitterness, roast, and slightly-sweet malt. Good body and carbonation with a nice level of bitterness. Drinks quite well and I'm glad that put this into bottles."
"overall would take this any day over an arrogant bastard or other strong ale. just really, really well done."
"had it again about a year later and have to say that its a brown ale jam packed with all the possible qualities. great thing is that it evolves into something with each sip with food. a unique earthy fruit blend. pine resin, chocolate, bittle blood orange with a dry ender. this is the prefect time to have it. somewhat of a hop unique beer. somewhat of a malt unique beer too. and i like that. may be a tad sweet for some. but its suit well for the finish."
"Bottle. Pours a fairly carbonated light brown color with a slighlty tan head. Notty, fruity, hoppy notes abound in the nose. Nice medium mouthfeel. Nice balance of hops and malt. Not super awesome but a nice twist on a brown ale with the addition of the added hops. Good lace."
"As I poured this brew into my nonick pint glass, out came a cloudy brown ale with a slight bit of an orange glow in the light. There was a nice, white, full head on top with great retention as I tipped the glass. Upon dipping my nose into the glass, there was an overwhelming hop aroma; beautifully hoppy. There's a tinge of malt backing, but the majority of the scent is a nice, cirtusy, floral hop goodness. The brew has an uncommon, yet delightful, flavor to it. You can taste the brown ale, you can taste the hops, but there's a quality, citrus balance in between it all. It tastes more like a well-balanced IPA than it does a brown ale; however, the amount of malt and slight bit of roastiness I taste within, makes it switch back and forth on my palate. The citrus/fruit undertone mellows out all the flavors and brings it back to earth. I really enjoying this brew's flavor. After each sip was a fruity sensation that almost had the essence of a lime zest. Little heat after-the-fact as well... I mean, it is a double afterall."
"Overall, a really nice new take on a brown ale, worth a shot for sure."
"Poured a nice clear mahogany brown with a short lived beige head. There's an awesome chocolate aroma here, nearly like a Hershey's milk chocolate thing going on. Subtle raisins and caramel in the background, but surely a chocolate-fronted beer. Flavor bursts of chocolate, raisins, and a hint of toffee in the finish. Very mild bitterness, if at all noticeable. Smooth and mildly carbonated. A lovely drinker for sure."
"Overall a rather average beer. Maybe a touch different for the style but not out of bounds or anything. Drinkable."
"The beer pours a clear brownish-red with an off-white head. The aroma is chocolate, mint, caramel malt and some piney hops. The flavor is a nice mix of chocolate with some pine. You also get caramel. Not too terribly complex but a very nice, easy drinking brown ale with some nice hopping. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D-this is very tasty. It is a little hot in the back but has a nice balance of both malts and hops. It is actually more hohp forward but it is quite tasty."
"Unique and different, but it works."
"Carbonation is low-moderate, fairly smooth on the palate with a touch of residual sweetness and some heaviness in the end. Interesting concept of a dry hopped double brown but there are a few conflicting flavors at the beginning. After half of the bottle the finish gets a little rough and more alcoholic...wasn't that impressed by this one."
"D: Good drinkability. Goes down easy and the flavor is nice. I am not a huge fan of brown ales, but I really enjoyed this beer and the variation Shorts has put on this style"
"Definitely one of the better brown ales I've had."
"Pours a clear reddish brown with a lasting foamy off white head , leavins some lagged lacing ,medium carbonation. Aroma is of floral and citrus hops , caramel, walnuts, and brown sugar . Flavor is nutty with spicy , citrus , and piny hops a little smoky , toffee and brown sugar , nice bitterness level , very hop forward for a brown . Full body , creamy mouthfeel , with a nutty earthy finish . Seems to get quite sweet if you let it get to room temp , Very drinkable . Another quality and intresting product from Shorts ."
"D- Very drinkable, a good balance between zest, bitter and sweetness. Would definitely buy again and is probably one of my favorite of the Short's limited releases."
"If there's one thing you can say about Short's Brewing, it's that they're trailblazers. Good Humans is further proof of that. I don't think I've encountered a Brown Ale quite like this one. It has a deep flavor profile that seems to feature a little bit of everything. At the end of the day, it has a good flavor, but doesn't quite strike me as great. Nonetheless, it's very interesting and worth your attention. Thanks, Derek. I really enjoyed the bottle."
"Drinkability - I like this, but not enough to sit back and drink a six pack of it. Very interesting beer and I would like to have it at least one more time and share it with my brother in law. I feel he would appreciate it."
"Smells like some grassy hops and a bit of citric bite up front. Toasted nuts as it warmed with a little grainy malt in the background. The taste... is very unusual. What's the abv? What is going on here? Weird fullness to the mouthfeel without being too heavy and not your typical brown ale by any means. Firm bitterness and some grassy hop flavor with a moderate fruitiness but it's all in a very odd balance with the caramel malt and grainyness. It somehow works though. Pleasant enough and pretty drinkable, I would guess it's 7.5% or so...?"
"Overall, a solid beer - what doesn't Short's do right?"
"Overall this is hands down my favorite beer from Short's and I commend them for doing a great job fusing an IPA with an American Brown. Though the split is probably about 75/25 with the IPA ahead. It definitely works very well."
"D: Good, pretty solid unique take on the style."
"4/3.5/4.5/4/4"
"The palate opens with plenty of caramel and brown sugar, but this definitely isn't syrupy. These flavors are well complemented but the aroma hops with some sweet citrus present Hop bitterness appears towards the finish with a mildly grassy off-flavor, almost vegetal? The sweetness of the finish almost tastes artificial, like there's some Spleda/Equal present. As it warms up, there's a fruity yeast character present, which doesn't really work well here. Medium-light in body with a medium-high level of carbonation, this is solid stuff. I did like drinking this."
"drinkability is great. i really liked the belaire, but love the extra depth and character that the hops lend this one over the belaire. that one was delicious, but this one just has a little more ""pop"" to it. great balance. super tasty. good stuff!"
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, pretty thick, low carbonation, some warmth but goes down smooth. A pretty nice beer, thanks Russ!"
"D: I'm sure the ABV isn't below 6%. This is pretty drinkable, though it is pretty sweet. I probably wouldn't have more than 1 at a time."
"D: It's difficult to criticize Short's. This is no exception. I like the syrupy hoppiness and how it gradually builds up its strength."
"Very hop forward, especially for the style with lot of dry bitter pine notes as well as a very prominent sweet citrus presence. Hints of orange and lemon peel along with some grapefruit and mango. Medium bodied with a slightly creamy texture mid palate. The hops are prominent and linger throughout but are nicely balanced by a slightly toasty caramel malt backbone. Hints of toffee and hazelnut as well as some biscuit. These notes are noticeable underneath but this beer is truly dominated by the dry bitter and sweet citrus hop notes. This beer is truly unique and a welcome twist to the style. Very complex and flavorful with a very dry finish."
"Notes: I wrote Short's Brewing inquiring about the ABV%, and have yet to receive a response."
"D: This is a really interesting beer, and the description was enough to intrigue me. The hops really come through and make you forget that you're drinking a brown ale for a second."
"Overall a great beer that was truly original."
"D - Really like it, good drinker."
"Overall, decent I guess, but nothing too amazing. Drinkability above average."
"This is an outstanding brown ale, especially if you like a hefty hop presence to mix things up a bit. Highly recommended."
"This strikes me as an interesting experiment, but not one I'll return to. Good on Shorts for trying new things."
"D - Really interesting brew here. Sweet and toasty, Good Humans offers a unique twist on a brown ale by incorporating quite a bit of citrusy hop character. Yum!"
"Got this one thanks to Telix. Pours a nice light golden brown with a thin white head that quickly fizzles to lacing. The smell is decent, some lightly roasted malts, a faint whiff of hops, coffee and chocolate. The taste is very similar, with lightly roasted malts providing subtle hints of coffee and chocolate, with hops providing a little bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is nice, with a medium body and good drinkability. Overall this a solid beer, with some nice complexity and excellent flavors. I could see enjoying quite a few of these."
"I haven't had anything like this before, and I'd go for another."
"I like it. This seems perfect for Fall/Winter weather."
"(D)- Yet another unique, yet tasty brew from Shorts! Certainly a different take on a brown ale with the addition of dry hopping. Not the best out there, but I respect Shorts for thinking outside the box."
"Trippy label. The beer poured a bright, clear chestnut with a thin beige/tan cap of fine bubbles. A bit of sticky lace, decent head retention. Big citrus aroma, lots of grapefruit, with some caramel and earthy malt in the background. Sort of surprising, but nice. Bold hop flavour, juicy citrus, grapefruit, moderate to high bitterness with enough malt sweetness, caramel, faint nuts and chocolate, to provide some balance. It finished with a hint of alcohol and lingering combination of malts and bitterness. The body was lighter than expected, not thin exactly but headed in that direction. Carbonation was medium-low and the texture was malty with a bit of dryness once the sweetness dissipated. An interesting beer, plenty of flavour and quite tasty."
"Pours a pretty clear rustic amber brown with a two finger light khaki colored head that dies down to a thin layer. Bits of lacing here and there, but not much. Aroma is one of a kind; roasted coffee, citrus hops, and bready malts. I like the smell, but it could be bolder. Taste begins with toffee and caramel sweetness. Midway a good combination of earthy and tropical hop flavors emerge. Chocolatey Brown Ale characteristics linger in the aftertaste with just a splash of Cara Cara oranges. The taste is a wonderful (and totally unexpected) blend of Brown Ale and hoppy Pale Ale. Medium body with a steady carbonation and a slight tingle that remains on the tongue. Another solid and unique brew from Short's, I could definitely put a few of these bad boy's down."
"The bottom line is that I like different characteristics when they mesh together. Stouts are malt-heavy and lightly hopped. IPA's are hop-heavy and have small malt character. Short's attempted to bring the two most notable parts of beer together by producing a malt-heavy IPA, and pretty much succeeded. I could tip a few of these back because it's delightful, but what's its ABV? Its goal? I usually look this stuff up on the Internet before reviewing so I know exactly what the intent of a beer is. Short's, if you brew it again, let's call it a ""dry-hopped dark amber ale""...that would have been perfect."
"This is now one of my favorite brown ales, and I prefer it to Surly Bender. Great job, Short's!"
"Starts off with toasted grains, soapy sweetness, and subtle hop bitterness. Cola and caramel sweetness increase, along with herbal, resinous hoppiness. Slightly earthy, tobacco and chocolate flavors near the finish. Fruity alcohol contributes some warming. Grainy, herbal bitterness in the finish. Medium-full body with a somewhat sticky feel. Not bad, but a tad rough around the edges and not as cohesive as it could be."
"Cheers."
"D: If you are into this style, I can imagine wanting to have a few. It's clearly the best of the Short's limited releases that I've had, which isn't saying much, but it's pretty good. I wish it tasted as good as it smelled!"
"D: This has got to be at least eight or nine percent ABV, but it goes down smooth anyway. Clean and delicious."
"Overall, an awesome beer that will only get better with time in the cellar."
"D: The flavors in this one are not too heavy and lend themselves well to drinking. The combination of the dry hopped aroma and the sweetness of the brown ale make a great combination."
"The sample came from the first bottle run put out by Short's. Their appearance on shelves cam with little warning and even less information. The majority of what is known comes from the bottle itself. The drinkability may be able to be scored more accurately if the ABV was available. With that being said, I am impressed by this brew. Very enjoyable and provides a pleasant warming feeling as it goes down which is welcome this time of year. Drinks smooth and easy making it one I would consider drinking a couple in a sitting. Once again hat's off to Joe and the gang for producing such a fine product."
"Very good American brown and it's not too far behind Surly Bender in my book. One of the best of the new Short's bottle releases."
"Overall an ale that fell flat for me. Since there aren't many representatives of this style, I can't really compare it to a certain forerunner. I'll definitely try more Dbl. Brown Ales as I come across them, but I think I'll pass on this in the future. Glad I tried it though."
"D- A very unique beer that is definitely worth a try. A bit sweet and warm for my tastes, but I thoroughly enjoyed it as well. I wish this would be a regular offering."
"This is much stronger and more bitter than the typical brown ale. Still, this is pretty refreshing and interesting."
