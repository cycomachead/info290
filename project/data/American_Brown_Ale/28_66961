I am very impressed with this beers flavor, balance, and complexity. Overall a very solid brew, I think it is a bit underrated.","TheCondor","Mar 24, 2015"

4.25,16.1,,,,,,"Wow, quite different from other brown ales I've had and very enjoyable. Single hopping with Citra really helps to set this beer apart. Pours a deep brown with a large tan head. Aroma is malt forward, sweet chocolate and some citrus fruit, which prepped me for big things on the palate. Toasty, nutty and chocolate tastes are there, typical things I expect from this style, but enhanced with the citrus fruit characteristics of those hops, has a bit of a zest or tang and some slight bitterness is noticeable. Overall I really enjoyed it. Maintains everything one wants from a good brown but that fruit character helps to make it unique among it's peers.","BrewChatKen","Oct 25, 2014"

Creamy malts, toasty, and nutty. Taste is fruity, bright, yeasty with some brisk hop over caramel, and some smoke/roastiness. Mouthfeel is thin feeling, very liquidy, and seemingly not dense enough to hold up all the flavors. Pretty juicy actually. Overall not bad. Easy to drink fast and interesting aromas and taste.","tastybeer","May 10, 2014"

This particular fine food and beverage emporium charged about 10 dollars for a six pack, which is probably too much, considering browns of similar quality can be had for about 25 percent less- this beer is simply one with a sparser distribution, and appeals to those few of us who crave variety.

Aroma is a juxtaposition of strong citrus/tropical fruit and dark malts. Amazing complexity in the form of citrus (orange, blood orange, lime), mango, passion fruit, papaya, peach, and brown bread, almond nougat, chocolate, coffee, and brown sugar from the malts. Some body and residual sweetness coupled with a dry bitter finish from the hops. Really quite an aggressive brown ale that captures the malt aspects of the style but obviously experimental in the hopping. I like it but maybe not every day.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 08, 2013"

The hops fight and ultimately overpower the malt flavors here and this is difficult to miss, as this beer is so light, slick, and heavily carbonated. Probably one of the most turbulent brown ales I've ever had, I kind of think this one should be treated as a unique experimental brew and rated as such. In the end, I do not find Brekle's Brown to be bad at all, but I do not find it to be all that appealing either. I kind of don't know precisely how I feel about it. I suppose I can say that if you are a fan of the style, it's worth trying once, though I doubt this is the kind of brown ale fans of the style will reach for on a regular basis.","mrfrancis","Jul 21, 2013"

The nose comprises toasted caramel (nearing burnt), light roasted malts, and a light kiss of what seems like orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with the orange, more present and powerful, doing battle with the even-toastier caramel, leading to a confused clash of flavors that doesn't sit all that well on the tongue. There's a sense of cedar in the background, as well, mucking things up even further. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel.

Silky on the tongue with decent carbonation. Overall- A really good, unique spin on the style. Really enjoyed the carmel/malt hit and the balance of the citra.

Color is a pretty, clear mahoganey with many tiny bubble trails. Aroma is banana up front, then malt, roast, toffee, fruit. Flavor's like nose and is fruity up front too; then there's the classic brown ale flavors. Oddly, sweetness is muted at first and comes in later finishing along with the bitter and tang. Body and carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor, ending to a not altogether pleasant bittersweet slow taper.","drpimento","May 28, 2012"

This beer didn't have that good of drinkability, I drank one and wouldn't want to drink another, too sweet, and the flavor doesn't do it for me. What I liked most about this beer was the way it looked, the color and head were on point, if this beer drank as good as it looked it would be pretty good. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma and taste, I didn't care for them that much and I thought they could have had much more balance to them. I wouldn't buy this beer again since I didn't enjoy it and I don;t recommend it, there are tons of better browns on the market for the same price. I had high hopes for this beer but it for sure didn't live up to them, I thought that the malts were just way too sweet and not that flavorful and the hops didn't work well with this beer. I am going steer clear of this beer from now on, but I am still down to try more of their beers, but this one didn't to it for me, better luck next time.","StoutHunter","Mar 16, 2012"

3.17,-13.4,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"A few days ago we were lucky enough to bring you a little bit of Anchor Brewing Company's history through their flagship brew, Anchor Steam. Today we will let Anchor bring out some more of their history, with an eye on the future as well. Anchor's Brekle's Brown ale is named after a German immigrant, Gottlieb Brekle, who opened a brewery in San Francisco that would 25 years later be named Anchor Brewing. In tribute to Brekle, this brew features a classic all-malt, single hop recipe (old) that makes use of a new hop variety, Citra (new). Brekle's Brown pours a reddish-brown with a frothy, off-white head that leaves a good deal of lacing. Slightly sweet malt rushes into the nose, with dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar, and trace hop notes lingering. Sweet malt is again in the foreground, this time well balanced by the new hop, hints of coffee and caramel come through on a sweet and lasting finish. The brew features a creamy light to medium body with good deal of carbonation. Nothing too fancy here, just an honest to style brown ale from a brewery that seems to be able to brew nothing but good beers.","phishsihq","Jan 09, 2012"

It might seem like it's going to be a cloying sugar bomb when it first hits your tongue, with huge amounts of caramel and sweet malts hitting the tongue. However, there's a fairly substantial amount of hoppiness (for the style, that is) that comes in the finish, along with a touch of roastiness that really helps to balance things out. The mouthfeel is perfectly substantial and well-carbed, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, yet another winner from Anchor. I find Anchor are really one of the most underrated breweries.

Taste wise I'm getting a lot of phenolic flavors, which are not abnormal though is different for an American brown, and hay, though not miller light hay, I'm talking fresh, grassy hay. Also in the taste is German low sugar chocolate biscuits. Mouth is light and crisp and not heavy, like the label suggests.

Primarily, the use of Citra hops here in a brown ale doesn't really work for me. The hops add a note of zingy citric sourness to the roasty, malty notes of the ale, and so are evocative of the grainy sourness you sometimes get in a brown ale. Not the flavor I'm looking for. In a hoppy brown ale, I much more appreciate herbal or pine notes that play up the roasty notes rather than work at cross purposes to them. The beer does have a nice color to it, a toasty, reddish brown, but the head fades relatively quickly. Quite citrusy in the nose, with a pleasant sweetness and hint of roast. If the taste more closely emulated the aroma, I'd be sold. A shame, because the body is solid as well. An interesting experiment, but I'd try it again with another hop profile.","Georgiabeer","Oct 20, 2011"

3.91,6.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The taste is more sweet than the smell suggests. But the hop provides plenty of counter-balance. There are elements of a low alcohol barley wine, but it is also like caramelized pale ale. Good body with a high carbonation level.","smcolw","Jul 20, 2011"
4,9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours reddish brown with fluffy off-white head. Caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted grains in the nose. A bit on the sweet side. Caramel, toasted grains, citrus and rind comes through as well. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A tasty session that is crisp and a hoppy brown. Balanced and clean.","JRed","Jul 14, 2011"
4.05,10.7,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"I have to say I liked it overall. Nothing special, just an easy drinking brown ale. The Citra hop works nicely. Would rather it be in 6-packs than a big bottle just for price sake though. Recommended.","bennetj17","Jul 14, 2011"
3.61,-1.4,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Flavor is good and slightly enticing. Bit of roast, touch of carob and some dark cherry in the background. Flavors linger moderately, softening a bit over time to offer a touch of sweet dark chocolate. Feel is smooth and offers a touch of dark chocolate in a spice sense. Light to medium in body and easy drinking as a result, sweetish but not too viscous. Been a while, but this comes across as a somewhat subdued version of their Porter....will have to check back on that...","HalfFull","Jul 10, 2011"
3.28,-10.4,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a moderate brown color with a good off-white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose carries a bit of caramel and toasted grain plus some mild roast. Faint hoppiness is there as well. Nice blend. The flavor has a bit too much roast and hop, coming together to create a strange bitterness that really affects the taste and feel. Medium body with average carbonation. All the components of this one didn't really come together for me, though I did enjoy the nose.","Thorpe429","Jul 08, 2011"
3.62,-1.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear dark brown with a 2 inch tan head that fades to a thin cap. Random streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of brown malt, light fruits, and some wood aromas. Taste is of caramel malt and fruit like apples or grapes. There is a woody zing flavor that I am getting as well. Some nuttiness is present too. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a smooth and slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good brown ale from Anchor but nothing amazing. I am glad I got to try this one after I read it was going to be bottled.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 05, 2011"
4,9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Though it got a little fruity for me at the end, Brekles is a damn fine brown and a great addition to Anchorâ€™s legacy of solid brews that stick to style standards. Itâ€™ll be great for the cooler fall weather.","Phelps","Jul 05, 2011"
3.32,-9.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Mild taste, smooth, sweet but not overly, enough substance to it to ride it out. No hops. Could make an Oktoberfest fan happy I bet. A little toffee in the mouthfeel, seemed par for course. Might pick up a 6 of it if I ever see it bottled, simply because its a nice agreeable beer to have around when people come over to the house empty handed.","Beerandraiderfan","Jul 01, 2011"
3.85,5.2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Beer is medium in body and surprisingly bitter. It is sweet with a nutty midpalate flavor and an overall pleasant feeling. It is not super easy to drink. There is a lot of beer in here and it gets a little rough throughout. I didn't dislike it but I don't think I"ll have it again.","drabmuh","Jun 30, 2011"
3.53,-3.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, a decent brown that shouldn't offend, but doesn't offer anything new.","ocelot2500","Jun 25, 2011"
3.31,-9.6,4,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"(22oz bottle from Total Wine Desert Ridge). Pours a clear dark brown--red color with a creamy tan head. Carbonation is almost like seltzer water. Aroma is very interesting: Iâ€™m getting some light caramel and cocoa, but also something like a peach jolly rancher. I like the smell, but its a bit weird. Taste is sweet malt, but not cloying at all. That peach is in the aftertaste. Thin bodied with slick texture. Iâ€™m not sure what to make of this beer. I donâ€™t know too much about the Citra hop so I just looked up some info and the resources I saw mentioned a fruity aroma like melon, papaya or mango. Well, this is an interesting beer and one that might grow on me more or turn me off completely. Definitely worth a revisit.","trappistlover","May 19, 2011"

2.39,-34.7,4,2.5,2,3.5,2,"O: Seems so strange. I love Anchor's beers but this was just awful. I'd be willing to give a bottle a shot, but Beachwood is a top bar, so I don't think it's any fault of theirs. Gave my glass to a couple other people to make sure I wasn't imagining things and consensus was that this beer tasted terrible.","womencantsail","Beers"

3.5,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Draft at Zeitgeist. Clear amber-brown body topped by a fleeting white cap. Lot of fruitiness on the nose, dates and stonefruit, bit of raisin and brown sugar, mild toasted malt. Very estery for a brown ale. The palate is more toasty, but still heavy on raisin and date flavors. Body is a bit thin. Finishes with toasted malt, a mild bite of herbal hops and licorice. Leaves a lingering earthy, slightly vegetal note. Pretty good and easy to drink, but nothing terribly special.","largadeer","0"
