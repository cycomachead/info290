"My favorite brown ale. I just wish SN would bring it back in six packs"
""
""
"Overall: One of my favorites from Sierra Nevada, would have it again"
""

"NUM NUM. Great autumn beer"

"Overall, a nicely made brown ale. Fit for the cool weather outside."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.07) : Would I buy this again? OH YEAH! I'd buy it in a sixer and drink it over the course of a month. It's a very tasty, easy drinking, flavorful brown ale and I'm sorry I waited so long to try it. Good job, Sierra Nevada, this ale is a winner!"
""
"Probably my favorite Brown Ale to date. Malty & sweet, but well balanced by Sierra Nevada's liberal hopping practices. Deep rich brown in color. I agree it goes quite well with a brisk fall day... What a Brown Ale should be & a standard for others to look up to!"

"Reddish brown color.  Has a carmel malt smell.  Toasty sweet malt and carmel taste.  Medium body and carbonation.  Great 'autumn' brown ale."
""
""
"OVERALL:  this is a very drinkable beer, it is not too roasted and is not overly sweet either, I am not a huge fan of the brown ale style but I enjoyed having something different, SN is one of my favorite brewers, they never disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beige head with an overly hoppy taste."
"Not a huge Brown Ale fan, but this is quite solid."

"1 1/2 fingers of creamy head over a mahogany body... looked great in the snifter. Aromas of roasted malt, light but crisp aromas. Very nice malt presence, roasted grains, clean and balanced overall. Classic SN body... might like it a bit heavier for the brown ale. Still one of the better ones that I have tried (despite the fact that my case was a little bit old). Glad than SN brought this one back."
""
"Overall this is pretty nice brown ale. I cannot complain here as for as brown ales are concerned. The only flaw, if any, is the bitterness is a little out of place stylistically. But this a fine beer from Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""
"Pours out a clear brown with a thin, white head.  Nose is toasty and a touch grainy.  Light caramel.  Flavor is toast, caramel, chocolate, light roast coffee, bready malts, honey, nuts.  Delicious.  Mouthfeel is light to medium with moderate carbonation.  Delicious.  An exemplary brown ale from the US."
""
""
""
"I was pissed when I heard they were discontinuing tumbler.  Back in April a rep told me they were going to bring it back in the fall pack.  Same coffee, chocolate, and smoky malt notes that I love in the aftertaste.  Bring this back as a stand alone.....please..."

"From bottles dated 07/15/14, part of 'Fall Pack Seasonal Sampler' 12-pack: Notes of mild chocolate and roasted grain; rather sweet malt; little hop presence.  Drying finish with a slight tang of hop spiciness.  Flavour reminds me of some chocolate stouts, but with a thin body; I'm imagining this is what a sweet and mildly chocolately Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale would resemble.  And it does have an earthy flavour of what I imagine autumn leaves to taste like (in a good way).  While I haven't been enamoured with Brown Ales in general (I think it is often the burnt-sugar taste that puts me off), this is one of the most palatable I've had.  —Reviewed 26 October 2014"
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoy brown ales, but am not a fan of smokey flavors. I can't really criticize the beer, but it not to my particular tastes due to the smoke. I would probably rate it much higher without the smoked malts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great brown color gives off a chocolatey cardboard aroma. The scent is a touch chalky, toasted and nutty. The flavor is dry chocolate malt, smoky, shoe leather, toasted, nutty and a bit of graham cracker. Overall, not the best brown but still tasty enough."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes much better than I remember. Mmm... bitter and chocolatey, with a touch of tobacco. Almost like a porter, but lighter of course. Somewhat dry and spicy; not sweet like you would expect. Well rounded and super drinkable. Now I wish they would bring this back in six packs!"
""
""
""
""
"O. Just a typical Brown ale nothing special, but still good. Give it a try. Hard buzz for 5.5% ABV. 3.25"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a very dark brown, with two fingers of beige head that settled to about a quarter of an inch and stayed to the end.  The aroma is sweet roasty malt, caramel, and just a slight hint of grassy hops.  The taste is dark roasted malt, with just a bit of bitterness.  Mouthfeel is fairly light for such a dark beer, with a good bit of carbonation to add a nice feel on the palate.  Overall, this is not one of my favorite styles, but one I may have to look into more often."

"O:  glad I finally got to try it after missing out last season, but it's more Americanized than I'd hoped (though I'm not surprised).  it misses the lighter toasted notes and buttery goodness of the English brown ale, but it is very nice in the vein of the black IPA -- loaded with hops that are tamed considerably by the darker malt"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoy this one. It's really perfect for the transition from summer to fall. Great for those warm days cool nights."
""
""
""
""
"O 3.75 - a fall staple. I'm glad they figured out a way to keep this on the shelves in the fall, even if it's part of a mixed 12 pack."
""

""
""
""
""
"09/05/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Although touted as an ale I find this leaning more to the porter side. As I'm not a pronounced hops fan I'd prefer a bit more subtlety. Flavor galore but just not to my taste."
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this brown. Balanced and smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a well made beer people, its not too sweet, not to bitter, not to thin but not super thick in the mouthfeel department, It really is one of the the best brown ales I have had for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Enjoying a 2013 vintage. Poured into a pint glass with an enormous frothy head. Nothing says autumn like a Tumbler. Everything a fall seasonal should be. Super malty with toasted nut flavors. Well done Sierra Nevada!"
""
""
""
""
"What a complex brew. Possibly the best brown ale I've ever had. Paired it with some aged gouda and they matched perfectly. Get some!"

"Medium brown with some clarity in addition to the off white head. Soft smoke note upfront. Chocolate, white bread, mixed nuts, and brown sugar, with a hint of smoke. A bit of nuttiness -- almost like a chocolate covered nut (of non-descript origin) toward the end. Very smooth, a bit creamy, and has a medium dry finish. Medium body. Delicious autumn ale. I love that is has a lot of flavor but a low abv. I'm not a cigar person, but if you were looking for something ""lighter"" to enjoy with your smoke, this could be it. I could see this with meaty stew or, for a different route, some spicy jambalaya. The spice would round out the sweetness of the beer nicely."

"Nice brown ale with good flavor and aroma, worth a try and easy to enjoy.  Beyond that, nothing exceptional."
""
""
""
""
"This was the first brown ale I fell in love with.  I've had better brown ales since, but this is still a good, very drinkable beer.  Safety drink when in a NYC bar during the fall."
""
"O: A solid interpretation of a classic (and often ignored) style."
"O: Enjoyable with the cooler fall weather that just moved in"
""
""
""
"Nutty, bready, toasted, chocolate, and caramel. Lots of lace rings. Easy drinking. Good value."

"Overall-  I can see why people miss this beer, but I wasn't expecting to love this one.  Easily the best brown ale I've had with amazing balance and flavor.  Literally the perfect amount of sweetness I'd like in a beer.  Definitely a must try for the Fall beer list."
""
""
""
""
"I go to Sierra Nevada when I want a beer done right. SN brews staples. This is a staple Brown Ale. Smooth, sweet, smokey, and nutty. With hints of vanilla and toffee. Great brown ale, great beer altogether."

"Pours a clear dark brown in color with a good 3-finger off-white head! Good carbonation with some sediment left in the bottom of the bottle. The aroma is of roasted malts, hazel nut and brown sugar. Very nice! The taste is close to the aroma but not as strong BUT pretty good overall with all the flavors mentioned above coming through lots of the hazelnut 'nut' flavor in the mix. A slight dry smoke finish but still good."

"Pours clear dark brown with 1 inch off white head, smells awesome! aromas of malts and nuttiness, hazelnut aroma pronounced and rich, also some brown sugar on the nose. medium high carbonation. taste is very nutty, not hazelnut or sweet but more like dry roasted nuts, was hoping for more sweet malty flavor in the taste, slightly smokey aftertaste as it warms!"

"O - This was a beer well beyond its standard drink by period, which actually speaks well of it, because it held up surprisingly well. When I saw it on the shelf, I knew I had to try it, because it was something I might never see again. I'm glad I did, because it was an impressive brew, even with the age on it. Hope it comes around again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Frighteningly easy to drink, very smooth throughout and with a crisp, bitter finish; I was looking forward to this one and again Sierra Nevada doesn't disappoint. Whilst not the very best from the brewery that I've tried this one is certainly a good one."
""
""
""
"O- Not a bad ale by any means. Interesting flavors are present but it lacks the smoothness that I associate with an above average brown ale. I would drink it again but won't seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer, and it hadn't been retired, I would definitely get it again. Oh well..."
""

"O: Pretty good brown ale. Its discontinued now so i'll probably never drink it again, but I'm glad I got the chance to try it."
"O - Its a shame SN didnt see it fit to brew this after this year, this has been a staple autumn brown ale. I know everyone has been all geared up on hops in more recent times, I'm one of those people, but there's great beers in other styles (like this one) that suffer due to demand of other product. Maybe one day it will return, for now, so long old friend..."

"Sierra Nevada Tumbler Autumn Brown Ale ---3.5/5"
"Pours brilliantly clear with a 2-inch tan head which settles to 1/8 inch. The color is dark mahogany with a hint of red. The nose suggests coffee, wood, malt, and bread. The body is surprisingly light. Modest carbonation. The palate suggests toast, coffee, nuts, roasted malt, and earthiness. Decent lingering. Some Belgian lace does form. Thirst quenching, not moreish. The ABV is not noticeable. Very pleasant."
""
""
""
"Overall- As claimed, this is a nice roasted brew for those cool fall nights. There are some more robust and flavorful brown ales out there, but this is very drinkable and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brown pour, as it should be, with a nice head and lacing that lingers. Slight nose of roast absent hops. Light / medium bodied and well carbonated. Flavor is much like the nose, slightly nutty against a light roast. Very well balanced with the malt. Nice crisp finish with just the right touch of hop flavor and slight bitterness. This is one of SN's not heavily hopped brews and should be well received by non-hop heads. A great transition beer to stouts with just a touch of roast."

""
""

""

"O - A near perfect pair with some spicy summer sausage and Quattro Formaggio Triscuits, Tumbler stands alone well on a crisp fall afternoon or paired with nearly anything grilled. Easy drinking and simple on the surface, this smooth, medium body, and well-balanced hop and malt profile make it a delicious fall brown ale that's a quintessential fall beer with layers of complexity hidden beneath the surface."

"3.69/5.00"
""
""
""
""
""

"Beer is medium-bodied, with medium to medium-low levels of carbonation, leading to a slightly foamy, smooth mouthfeel that also makes the beer feel a bit thicker than it is. Closes dry, with moderate to high stickiness remaining on the lips and palate."
"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 7/3/2013. Pours lightly cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, nuttiness, brown bread, floral, light pepper, and floral/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with moderate earthy hops; and good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, chocolate, brown bread, nuttiness, floral, light pepper, and floral/toasted earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, brown bread, nuttiness, floral, light pepper, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of dark/toasted malt flavors with a moderate earthy hop balance; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent brown ale. All around great balance and complexity of malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Its a decent brown ale. I've had better brown ales, but this isn't the worst brown ale out there, especially at the typical Sierra Nevada price point. This feels kind of SNPA without the hops.. I would definitely take Surly Bender or DFH Indian Brown over this any day."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a refreshing and tasty brew, balancing on the edge of a delicate hop/ malt balance. Not my favorite, but quite nice nonetheless"

"O - I figured I better review this one before it goes into retirement. It is one fo the more flavorful beers I have come across at this low an ABV. Rich aroma and flavor full of nutty caramel malts. Just a hint of hops. Perfect for a crisp fall evening. I like to grab this at least a few times each year, so it will definitely be missed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A good dinner drink. Not really a sipper, not as much malt evident as I like in my browns. Not quite getting why so many seem to be upset that this one is in its last offering. It's just not as special as other SNs I have tried. However it is above average for a ""mainstream craft"" brown."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome brown ale from Sierra Nevada. Not sure if this is my favorite offering from SN, but if it's not it's very close. The smokey deep brown flavor is great for fall, colder weather, or maybe after dinner. There's a sweetness to it that's outrageously smooth, flows right down the back of your throat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Gonna be sad to see this gone and replaced by Flipside next year. It isn't my favorite brown ale, but by golly it hits the spot. I'll have to buy another sixer before its gone."
"I now remember having two that night even though I had an important meeting early the next day since they were so good. Even after cellering for a year, this remains my favorite brown ale I've yet to try. The body is so well balanced and complex, yet completely drinkable. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy for incredible drinkability, yet has enough character to hold ones interest and complement the complex flavor profile. Tumber claims to be the ultimate autumn beer and i'd have to agree. I feel fortunate to have this beer associated with one of the defining moments in my life."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"3. Cheers to you Sierra Nevada for continuing to offer the world your pioneering artisanal skills and offering a different expression of your hoppy-goodness prowess; and again, thank you for a refreshing interpretation of a fall season drinker."
""
""
"o: on the bottle it says ""perfect for an autumn afternoon"" and i couldn't agree more. the style itself isn't the most complex, but i really enjoy brown ales anyway. this one plays a little more to the roasty/chocolaty qualities than the malt sweetness, but it works so well!"

""

"Overall- Solid beer. It isn't amazing. If you like brown ales, you should give this a try. If not, you aren't missing much but you still might want to give it a try. A good representation of the style."
""
"The packaging gets me every time...Its just so beautiful, it does a number on my brain, gets me psyched for the chilliness and Autumn nights. I still can't fully put to words how I feel about this beer. Its definitely not one of my favorites, but there's an overall aesthetic that is immensely appealing. It affects me."
""
"To me, brown ales are one of the fine signatures of fall. This one is good and kind of skunky smelling. It has a bronze-ish brown color. This one reminded me of a brown ale from Bear Republic. A dark brown ale is always a better brown ale, as far as taste, but this one is different than a lot of brown ales I've tried. Sierra Nevada is usually a little hoppy for my taste, but this one goes down real nice and should be everyone's go-to beer for the fall season, but watch out, it tastes totally different out of the tap at a bar!!"

"This is a very hoppy brew with a good amount of toasty malt. This is a really flavorful beer at its ABV. I highly recommend this beer for beginners as its has a good assertive hop profile, but also that malt to back it up."
""
"This is a tasty, easy drinking beer. Very smooth and flavorful. Great for a cool autumn evening."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Easy drinking but not a whole lot of flavor. Weakness is disappointing as the aroma was very nice but not a lot of flavor coming through in this beer. Not bad but not great. Just not a lot of flavor or complexity coming through at all. There are a lot of better browns out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As my friend said when he first had this beer ""This tastes exactly how brown should taste."" This is an excellent offering from a brewing company that tends to be hit or miss for me. I definitely will be picking this up in the falls to come."

""

"O - I have to buy a sixer of this every season as it signals fall is approaching and the 100 degree Texas days are numbered! I'm not a fan of brown ales as they are usually very lacking in flavor to me. This is one exception. It's still not mind blowing, but I find it to be a good example of what the style should be. I can definetly enjoy a sixer of this, but only one a year."
""
"Always enjoy this.. As it remimds me of fall.. Aka hunting season.. Typically the first beer i drink on opening day as a fall tradition.. Roasted malts and great aroma sets the mood just right for opening day out in the woods looking for a trophy buck to put on my wall and share with my family"

"This is very good. It's one of my lesser-liked SN brews, but still always worth getting. I look forward to having it again as it gets colder. I will get it again."
"I'm amending this brew, mainly for score.  I obtained three bottles of this excellent beer as part of a seasonal 12 pack- sadly, the only way to obtain it now.  This brew is nutty, a little buttery, rich, and has great balance.  One of the best browns out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I don't think I've ever had a bad beer from Sierra Nevada and this is no exception. This is a really good brown ale, and one of my go to beers during the fall months."
"Overall: Finally tried this, very fresh, and I'm glad I did. A great fall seasonal and for me, a better fall beer than many oktoberfests. Definitely a must try."
""

"I love seeing this come out every year. It's kind of become my kickoff beer for fall, football season, and the holidays for me. Poured into a tall goblet, nice head, dark brown ale that has a reddish tinge when held to light. Aroma is nutty, coffee, light caramel, molasses. Taste is very malty with the aforementioned aromas present in the flavor. Nicely balanced by hops. Appropriately carbonated and well structured, and a lot of flavor packed into this 5.5 abv brew. As I said, I welcome its arrival each year with the autumn seasonals, and recommend!"
""
""
""
"One of the more refreshing, hoppier browns I've had, most are bready and heavy. Nice balance and lingering flavor. Earthy aroma and some brown sugar, but not overly sweet and very drinkable. Nice transition beer from pale ale to porter, two of my all-time favorites."
""
""
""
""

"This is a great beer to transition from summer to autumn as it's fairly light for the style. It smells of roasted malt, brown sugar, and nuts. The taste is sweet, a bit too sweet I feel, but there are some nice flavors here, specifically brown sugar, bread, and nut. I couldn't taste the hops but I'm sure they're there somewhere. The mouthfeel is light but satisfying, and for as sweet as this is, it's not sticky. Overall, I like this, but it would work better as maybe a dessert beer, say, with some pumpkin pie. As it is, it's a little too sweet but otherwise quite tasty."
"O: Nothing spectacular but well above average for the style. It does remind me of an Autumn afternoon, so bonus points there! I wouldn't seek it out but I would drink it again if offered."
"The Verdict: Good beer. Nothing great or earth-shattering, just another good solid brew from Sierra Nevada. I’m still waiting for this winter’s Celebration Ale, though."
""
""
"This tastes like autumn. Absolutely perfect for the season and one of the best Browns I've had in a long time."
"O: for a nut brown, almost dead on. Maybe a little bitter in the middle and lacking nose."
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, this is one of the beers that makes me look forward to fall. Dear Sierra Nevada: make it year round!"
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Not much left to say but I'll reiterate that even for a ""Autumn"" beer, it still has a place in the terrible heat of July. I'll probably find myself getting it a couple of more times this season."

"Overall: A marvelous beer in an underrated and usually poorly done style. Sierra Nevada presents a beer with soft roasted flavors while still conveying just a pinch more of the sweet maltiness of mid-colored beers compared to the often more bitter and overtly roasty porters and stouts. A really excellent beer and one that's great on those cool, crisp fall nights, where you aren't looking for a huge imperial stout nightcap, but don't want something light. Would recommend."

"good flavor but the carbonation, like most Sierra Nevada beers, is a little harsh. I prefer a more smooth carbonation. Poured to a nice clear dark amber with slight head. Smell was not overly hoppy and seemed to have a little lingering yeast smell. That's all."

"Overall: a good quality American Brown Ale. Note sure I'd want to pay this much all the time though. I'd like to stop getting ripped off in Australia so we can actually enjoy this sort of stuff at a reasonable price."
""
"I've had the Tumbler before....i guess I just never rated it. The beer pours a deep brown with creamy slightly offwhite head which is leaving a nice lace. The smell has some rich sweet malt with hints of nyut meg. The taste has good bready/biscuity foundation with bitter hops to balance. The mouthfeel was a medium to light brown ale...the carbonation is a bit strong and detracting from teh taste. Overall its a decent beer."

"O: I'm not a big brown ale drinker, as the style often leaves me feeling kinda ""meh"" but I really enjoyed this ale - it was quaffed quickly and with gusto - it had a brisker, crisper, lighter feel than other brown ales I 've had, and I liked it. Perhaps the things most people look for in a brown were missing, hence its middling reviews, but for me it may have been these very factors that elevated it above others for me in particular. Absolutely worth a try, as Sierra Nevada has firmly established themselves as a reliable brewer of great craft ales."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is a bit nutty, some hops. Taste is malts, nuts, some hops, a bit of caramel, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."

"Overall not a bad brown ale at all yet I don't think I could session more than one. Quite a good staple for this above average company."

"O: Decent brown ale. Smells better than it tastes. A mildly hoppy and plain brown ale. Not as much toastiness and nuttiness as I'm used to."
"O: Another great Sierra Nevada brew. It's not super heavy or robust, but it is a perfect option for throwing back a few while watching a football game on a Fall day."
"O-Not the best brown ale, Not bad, but seems lacking when compared to other commerical examples that have more intense flavors."

"O - Just a solid american brown by SN. Not going to standout among the craft varieties of the style, but uts accessibility and quality make this a nice go-to beer in the fall."

""

"Overall - Solid Brown Ale from Sierra Nevada. Nothing special but pretty good!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very drinkable, enjoyable brew. Not overly aromatic or flavorful, but nice and refreshing. Perfect for easy drinking."
"There are better browns out there."
""
"Pours a beautiful, rich caramel color with a nice head. The head takes a bit to dissipate and leaves nice lacing. Rich, malty flavors dominate; some nice light hopping balances the considerable sweetness of the malt. A feel-good brew for when the weather starts to turn colder."
""
"Personal Rate: 3.5"
""
""
""
""
"Sierra Nevada never fails to impress me, and this is certainly no exception. A very solid brown ale with a great nutty flavor that does nothing but hit the mark. At 5.5% ABV, this beer is drinkable as can be. Chalk this one up as a victory."
""
"Some soapy and off flavors on the finish from time to time on certain bottles i've noticed such as a soapiness or too much noticeable alcohol, could be quality of the brewing process diminishing since I remember it being much better last year, but still a very good fall beer."
""
"O: Good brown ale."
"The depth of this brewery continues to amaze me. While they are best known for their fresh, hoppy profiles, Tumbler provides are maltier one with just a touch of hops to balance. It's a smooth, foamy brown. Biscuity malts are in the foreground with a trace of nuts. A wonderful autumn seasonal."
""
""
"An easy drinking brown that could also act as a transition beer for those just starting to explore outside of Newcastle..."
""
"This easy going brew would be a great beer to share with friends who shy away from ""crazy"" beers that might scare them away. This is similar to, but much better than, Newcastle in that regard (a beer that I often recommend to people who want to try something better than light lager crap)."
""
"Overall: This one is a readily available seasonal brown ale at a good price. If I am in the mood for a brown, and this one is available, I will not hesitate to pick it up."
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and quite enjoyable, it has a flavor that makes me think of the fall and went really well on a chilly fall afternoon just before Thanksgiving. I think this could be a decent fall session beer and I would think a nice tailgating beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure why it's considered a seasonal, but I don't mind it. Good enough to be enjoyed year-round."
"O- A solid brown."
""
""
"A perfectly balanced session Brown, but I still want a bit more malt depth. They could cram more malt flavor in there and still keep the ABV (or even lower it). This beer was better on-tap back in October at the Bear. Slightly muted flavors suggest oxidation, which is pretty likely given that this was bottled over four months ago. Nevertheless a solid and drinkable offering. (3.5)"

"O: I enjoyed this beer immensely. It will definitely be a go-to beer for the autumn season for me."
"Final Thoughts: I picked this one up as part of a make your own six pack and I'm not disappointed. I would, however, be disappointed if I had purchased an entire sixer of Tumbler. It's a little on the watery side and not quite as robust as I like my ABAs to be. It's ideal for someone who is new to craft beer and fears ""dark beers"" I suppose. Would I drink it again? It's unlikely."

"Overall-Perfect autumn seasonal! Every time I sipped it I looked outside and saw a crisp, cool, fall evening with multi-colored leaves surrounding the area. Drinking this beer brought intense feelings of nostalgia. I eventually stepped out onto my patio and I could smell wood burning stoves filling the autumn air. Great beer and very sessionable! Throw back a couple! I think this beer should be available throughout the winter, too. It is not just a great brew to sip while watching th leaves change, it is a great brew to sip on a cold winter's eve watching the snow fall (if snow will ever fall in the Mountain West!) I think global warming is upon us, my friends."

""

"The beer is copper to auburn in color with a quarter inh of thick, foamy beige head. The aroma offers caramels, malt, squash, light spice, maybe a hint of cinnamon and/or nutmeg. The flavor is ok, with some lightly toasted brown bread notes. Mild bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall, this was ok."
"This beer pours a nice mahogany color, not quite opaque with a one inch head that lingers and excellent lacing. Smell is molasses, honey, coffee, and charcoal. Mouthfeel is about perfect for this style. Taste pretty much follows the nose. Can Sierra Nevada produce a bad beer? I've yet to have one."
"A clear brown color with a thick tan colored head that laces down the glass. A nice sweet and roasted malt aroma. Sweet malt up front with bit of hop and then the toasted malt flavor kicks in and gives it a little depth. It finishes sweet with a touch of bitterness and a lingering roasted flavor. The beer is light with good carbonation. This is a very easy drinking brown ale. Just enough roasted flavor and bitterness to counter the sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent beer, crisp and suitable for fall. Will go for this one again. One of my favorites from Sierra Nevada."
""
"O - For a fall seasonal this is a really pleasant clean session beer which I can see myself drinking more then just a few. The quality is great on this brew and the price can not be beat. Hats off the SN for so many great enjoyable brews and another great fall seasonal. Cheers!"

"-Overall 4.0: A satisfying beer that would be excellent as a session beer. Great on its own, but would go well with food and crudites. That's right, I typed ""crudites."" Regardless, this is one of the few ""mego micro"" seasonals that is worth picking up every time it comes out."

"Overall an enjoyable rendition of a style that's never been a personal favorite. Definitely a nice complement to falling leaves, dropping temps, and Sunday afternoon football."

"Pours a nice medium brown, with some white head and little bit of lacing. Aroma has a very slight hop bitterness, but very balanced compared to some other sierra nevada offerings. many of the toasted to mid roasted malts starts to come out in the aroma, but only after a few hefty sniffs. Taste has hints of biscuit, caramel then to a lighter chocolate. feel is nice and crisp, with a nice balance that would taste great on a colder night. toasty malt taste lingers in the back of the throat. Overall very tasty beer, hits a very great balance without being overly malty or hoppy."

"O - this is what fall tastes like! This is now my official fall go to beer. It's extremely drinkable and and just the right roasty flavor and in the mist of all the ESB's and pumpkin beers this is definitely my favorite style for the season. Go out and get a 12 pk this stuff is fall in a bottle."
""
"Overall: Very good fall seasonal from Sierra Nevada. Will buy more."
""
""
""
""
""

"O:  A fantastic Fall treat that is bready, bittersweet, roasty and nutty.  I would prefer a thicker mouthfeel but overall I have no real complaints. I like the fact that it isn't overly boozy and not burnt. Another delicious offering from SN. "
""
""
"O: This was a very pleasing, high quality beer. Nothing is wild or extreme in this one, and it is not meant to be wild or extreme. This is a high quality and baseline beer to use when thinking about wild and extreme beers. This beer has a pleasing balance of the various flavors of dark roasted barley, which results in a satisfying balance of malted sweetness, and toasted grain, chocolate and coffee bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Love having another good brown ale available at a decent price, even if it is only in the fall. I think the brown ale style is a little looked over and I'm happy to see a major producer make one that will appeal even to the hop heads. Good work Sierra!"

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, rich, chestnut coloring with a thin, filmy, clinging off-white color. Aromas of campfire, hazelnut coffee, and roasted nut. Smells very ""autumn camping"" right off the bat. Flavors are rich and malty, but balance is maintained by the light, carbonated body. Heavily roasted with a hint of the campfire charcoal, the nutty blend is sweet and slightly dark at the same time. Overall, this comes off slightly bitter from all the roasting and firey characteristics, but the deep, rich sweetness balances very smoothly. Rich, roasty aftertaste with a slight smokey linger transitioning into the clean, smooth finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall: Quality ingredients combined with flawless execution, the trademarks of Sierra Nevada. It is a little light for my tastes, but there is still absolutely nothing wrong with it. I am not sure I would grab this again, but that is only because I prefer a little more punch from my beers this time of year."
""
""
""
"Overall: A great brown ale and a great fall seasonal. Definitely love the smokiness in it. It's subtle, so it doesn't dominate but it's always there. Definitely a beer I'll be having again and again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown, with a beautiful thick cream colored head. Scents of roasted malts, caramel, nut, and a hint of apple. Taste is of slightly bitter roasted malt, sourdough, and it has a beautiful nutty aftertaste. I think the smooth aftertaste that is reminiscent of walnuts and peanuts is the most redeeming aspect of this brew. Relatively thick mouthfeel for a brown ale, overall pleasant. This beer definitely smells like fall, though the taste leaves a bit to be desired."
"The beer pours a pretty amber brown like light grade maple syrup. The head is big, fluffy and smooth, with a nice light tan coloring and it lasts for a little while at a fingers width leaving sticky lacing splotches behind. The beer smells strongly of nutty roasted malts. Hints of roasting bread, earthy hops, and bready yeast can also be found in the nose. There is also a phenomenal whiff of decaying leaves which reminds me so heavily of fall and my childhood that it sends shivers of nostalgia through me. The beer tastes nicely sweet and nutty, with nice roasted notes and hints of nut bread, and earthy hops and leaves. This beer tastes of the fall. It is cool and crisp yet warming and sweet. Slight candied notes reminiscent of maple syrup are also present on the tongue. The beer opens with nutty sweet malt and then transitions into roasted bread before the taste closes down into a roasted nut aftertaste with slight coffee hints. The mouthfeel is kind of prickly with the carbonation, but the beer is smooth and slightly creamy with a nice light chewiness to it. Overall this is a fantastic seasonal brew, and a wonderful autumn brown that stylistically echoes the season in taste and smell. Another great offering from Sierra Nevada, and definitely worthy of a taste."

"On the lighter end of medium bodied with decent mix of bitter, sweet and roasted flavors. Surprisingly hop forward with some dry bitterness that lingers throughout, slightly overpowering the malt notes. Grassy and resinous with a floral pine presence that's countered by lightly smoked malt, toffee, caramel and hazelnut. There's a decent amount of sweetness and interesting malt flavors but the hop presence is too aggressive for the style. Still, it's an enjoyable beer that's easy to drink."
"O – This is a really nice brown ale. I wasn’t convinced after the aroma, but the taste is great. I love the unique touch of chocolate, smoke, and citrus and pine hops. The creamy mouthfeel is also a plus. Sierra Nevada is right: this is perfect for an autumn afternoon."
""
""
""
""
""
"Raisin reddish brown in color with a slight chill haze. Poured with a short beige foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Sweet, lightly roasted malt aromas with floral notes and a hint of nuts. Dense, rich carbonation provides a chewy, fuller body feel. Roasted malt flavor up front with hints of roasted coffee in the background. Tangy floral hop bite in the middle that accentuates the coffee notes toward the end. Finishes clean and dry with a light lingering coffee-like bitterness. Roastier, hoppier and less sweet than the typical brown ale. Sierra Nevada comes through once again."
"Poured a half inch head which dissapated to a ring. Nice lacing. The nose was of roasted malts, dark fruits which made it's presence as it warmed. Toe tongue is roasty malty with a slight hoppy bitterness in the backbone. Overall a decent brew which I've had on several ocassions. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into snifter."

"I sampled this beer along with two other similar choices (Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat and Dundee Oktoberfest) and it seemed wholly average. It was dark brown in color and tasted earthy. It matched my average expectations. I didn't expect much and I didn't get much."

"for an autumn night, or a walk out candy huntin' with the kiddos, the mouthfeel is perfect... a sip every house or so should do... keep it comin'"
"O- A very good American brown ale at a very reasonable price. A nice segue into the winter beers to follow from SN."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A decent brown ale but missing on a few fronts in terms of being appropriate for the style as well as having a spark. This would be good during the football game but not necessarily for provking a discussion."
""
""
""
"Creates a frothy two finger head on the pour, quite airy and thus dissolves down swiftly, deep tan in color, the lacing appears sticky at first but only a few streaks persist. Very clear brown hued liquid with a metallic orange tint, some yellowing around the edges, the bubbles are so tiny at first you hardly see how many there are. While the nose has a crisp mocha to cocoa toast to it along with coffee notes, behind that is sweeter caramel, nougat, glazed nuts and honey, gains stiffness from surprisingly strong lemon zest, cut grass and dried flowers, not much fruit, more of a slugger than a glider. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied with a good deal of fizzy carbonation to assist in relieving its weight. More of the nuts, roasted coffee, cocoa and general toastiness, here with more pumpernickel to sourdough bread notes. The roast tends to keep the sweetness in check, allowing for some toffee and butterscotch. The hops have a bitter oiliness to them which is actually for the better as they create a herbal pucker at the end and continue the drying sensations so the mouth feel is not overly creamy. Well-balanced and sessionable, its lack of decisive direction may be offputting to some. Should prove a versatile food beer."

"The brew poured with a thick two finger, tan head that dissipated pretty slowly. It left a lot of pretty lacing on the glass. The body poured a beautiful deep brown with lots of active visible carbonation. The nose had a lot of nuttiness on it…I’m going with hazelnuts. Maybe even a hint of maple? Although I’m a total hop head, this smells like fall to me. On first sip, I’m impressed with how good of a brown ale this was. It had the nuttiness that was apparent in the nose, coupled with sweet malt, and then a minor hint of bitterness. All the flavors work together in concert. The body was on the thinner side with moderate carbonation making it an easy beer to throw down after raking leaves or some other appropriate fall activity. The finish was quick with some bitterness to it, albeit mild. To me, this is a great session beer for the fall and I could see drinking it while sitting by a firepit. This will definitely be a seasonal go-to brew."
""
"Medium plus body with a sharp, up front effervescence. Slight warming. This is like Newcastle Brown with a bit more hops. Aftertaste is a nut/cardboard/toast blend with an light medicinal note, probably best described as toasted nut."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I thought the appearance of this beer was awesome - hard to beat. The flavors blended well for the most part but I thought there was a bit too much toastiness to it and it was a bit dry beyond my preferences."
""
""
""
""
""
" Well integrated hops character, malty malt bill, roasted malts, dry chocolate. A brown ale that's up my alley (a number of American brown ales are over-roasted for my tastes, not to mention over-hopped). This is well balanced, while still tipped to the American side. Herbal hops aroma comes through as it warms up a bit. Remarkably smooth. Good beer. Oh, and last whiff aroma note from the wife: lemon, citrusy...amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. There was a certain depth to the malts that really helped to lock in, and keep, your interest. The lightness of feel helped this fact. The nose, however, is where we lost points, as it presented quite generically, and was rather uneventful throughout the sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice brown ale. Very drinkable, and perfect for a crisp fall day."
"O: This beer is a little drier and bitterer than your average brown ale, which I do appreciate. Fairly easy drinking and enjoyable, but nothing special. Don't know if I will be buying this again though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours clear, dark honey brown with a tall, creamy tan head that nearly overflows. There are a lot of visible tiny bubbles in this beer. The head leaves some lacing on the side of the glass as it dissipates, which occurs very slowly. The aroma is nutty with some roasted barley malt. The nutty and roasted malt flavors really come through well in the taste. It's mildly sweet and bready. I can detect some chocolate as well. There are some hops on the back end that are earthy. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is smooth and the drinkability is high. This is a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells and tastes about the same. I get some maple syrup, toasted hazelnuts / almonds / chestnuts, toasted bready malt, and an initial earthy / grassy hopping combo that ducks out of the way of the midsip only to rise up anew in the finish. Pretty good, if perhaps just 10% too sweet for my balance preferences."
""
""
""
""
""
"The Sierra Nevada Tumbler was a pretty standard brown ale overall. Its appearance was darkish brown with a slight tan head. Its mouthfeel was medium-bodied and its smell was overall a solid maltiness but nothing super strong. The taste was much like the nose-- just pretty average. I was hoping for something with a little spice, but maybe that'll have to wait for he winter warmer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall one of my favorite fall seasons, not an Oktoberfest or a Pumpkin but still fits in well. Great transition from the light summer beers to the darker winter ones."
"O- great fall seasonal, great flavors and body."
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice to see a fall seasonal that isnt Pumpkin or Marzen, honestly this should replace marzens as the Fall Style. Malty enough for harvest style food and football, but not quite as dark as the blizzard/freezing water style brews (robust porters/stouts/winter warmers). One of SN best non hoppy beers."

"The nose on this beer is so good that I just kept going back to it for a whiff. Inevitably, that leads to high expectations for all other aspects of the beer. It delivers. Nice smooth flavor profile with a rounded tone to it. A lot of brown ales I try tend to be too fruity and vibrant, but this is not one of them. It's even. I like this one. It's rare that this style does it for me, but this beer delivers. A pleasure to drink."

"O: Not one of SN's better offerings. Having said that, it's an immensely drinkable brown ale that one could find themselves drinking 3-4 of in a sitting. At least it's well priced in typical SN fashion. Average, but worth a try once."

"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown amber with a moderate light tan head. Aroma of light malt and hops. A pleasant malty flavor with light toasted malts and caramel. I thought I caught the cinder flavor similar to Cinder Cone in there at one point. A nice low ABV brown ale."
""
""

"Overall - A really nice brown. Bold and assertive. A little more hop than your average brown, but I welcome it."

"Caramel and a touch of toffee hit the palate and lend some sweetness to the proceedings. It has a subtle roastiness, but that aspect is restrained. Hopping is also reigned in, though there is still a pleasant level of florality in the dryish finish. Though not a complex bier in any way, Tumbler goes down easily and could make a good session bier. Prosit!!"

"The verdict: Not bad, but not at all great. Probably the least impressive of the beers I've tried from this brewery. However, I'll definitely be trying it again in the Autumn, as fresh I can get it."

"Overall, well made beer. Not a massive flavour - not too sweet, not too bitter, could go a few, and I don't normally say that for SN."
""
""
""

"Pours a grocery bag brown with a small khaki head. Fresh grainy aroma, like walking into a brewhouse. Some milk chocolate and caramel in there too. Flavor is a bit of a letdown. Thin body and not enough robustness to interest me. A meek sweetish bready beer with a breath of smoke and a vanishing astringent finish."

"Reliable and highly satisfying offering that doesn't grate in any way whatsoever. Nice to see a sessionable brew whose character isn't predominantly derived from hops."

"O: Fantastic brown ale. I love the chocolate tons without the coffee harshness. It's subtle, balanced and delicious. Plus it has the signature creamy head that all Sierra's bottle conditioned beers have. Absolutely love it."

"This is an enjoyable, pretty standard, American brown ale. Another good brew from Sierra Nevada!"

"The only downside to this offering is that it is a seasonal and not offered year round. This is my favorite Brown Ale hands down and is my go to beer when it is available. From the smell to the taste to the reasonable price it is gonna be hard to beat Tumbler in any aspect. Highly recommended!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Conclusion: This was better a bit fresher; I wish I woulda gotten around to reviewing it then. Picked this up for $5.99 so that they could bring in Celebration; the regular price is $7.99. At that price, I'd rate this about an 84 or so; a solid B I'd pick up once or twice a season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Man, this was nice. Surprisingly enough it was made by Sierra Nevada; low on what makes American-hops American - far from what Sierra utsually puts on the market."
""
""
""
"All up fairly innocuous. Well balanced and tasty, but coulf be richer for mine, although this would probably put it into the porter category."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:	Not bad I thought it was a great autumn beer."
""
"A mild mouthfeel with a small spark of carbonation and medium body. This is a smooth easy drinking beverage but not something that's amazing. Good on a fall day and not very offensive to beer novices but a touch dull in the long run. Worth a try but probably one I won't buy again."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: I like some of Sierra Nevada's other offerrings better, but this isn't bad by any means. It's a nice fall beer, and I will drink it again."
"Overall Drinkability - Sessionable. Not much of a tasting beer. Near boring, but not quite."

"D: A little blander than I had expected, especially after that first whiff, but a solid brown ale. The kinds of beer I look forward to when the leaves begin to fall."

"Side Note: Awesome with some sweet potato fries and horseradish mayo."

""
"I'm not a huge brown fan, but this one was pretty good and I try to keep style in mind when rating. Overall this is a nice late-fall/early-winter beer when I'm not quite in the mood for a heavier stout/porter or anything too spiced."
""
""
""
"A good showing by Sierra Nevada. It's hard to make a distinguished brown ale. This one may be. It has a toasted/biscuit character that seperates it from other brown ales. Just enough for you to notice, but not too much to block its drinkability. Im usually not a huge fan of the style, but I liked this."

"A more hoppy brown ale for a fall season. Not exactly what I am looking for that time of year, but still a well crafted beer."

"Drink- A very tasty brown ale with some nice balance and good roastiness behind it. A little lacking in pop but had a bit thin feel which brought it down a little for me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it seems like this is an English Brown Ale, plenty of malt, not big on hop bitterness. Another well done Sierra Nevada brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A pretty solid brown ale. The hoppiest of any of the few browns I've had."

"O - For a brown ale, this makes a statement. More hops then most, and stronger then some, but easy drinking due to the crisp light feel that many brown ales impart."

"Garnet brown in color with striking ruby hues in the light. Pour produces a creamy and fluffy head -- almost looks like it was poured from a nitro tap -- but there is no lacing to be found. Hints of peaty smoke, earthy hops and yeast, along with light fruity esters. Overall, well balanced and flavorful, but the complexity falls short as the smokey notes take over the beer. Creamy and thin and smooth on the palate. Decent brown ale, but not top-notch."
"O-pretty enjoyable for my first Brown Ale"
"I'm not sure what other people see in this beer...browns are definitely not my favorite style but this one didn't have much redeeming qualities. A rare miss from Sierra Nevada."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with moderate carbonation."
"Overall, a decent brown ale, but too rough around the edges. Not in my top 10 for the style."
"O: It's fine. like the high amount of hops, dislike the high amount of carbination. P.S. had one tonight with roasted chicken,fingerling potato and gravey. The flavors of the beer really came into play while drank with the roast dinner. Reveiw was based on a clean palate."
"Liked it better than I thought I would. Very nice blend. Easy drinking. Will have some every fall from now on."
"Lively carbonation with a crisp, clean finish. Very easy drinking. Not a big flavored beer by any means, just a pleasant and refreshing brown ale. Toasty caramel malt and very mild smoke were the predominant characteristics for me."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I through this a quite enjoyable brown ale and enjoyed sipping my way through both the first and the second one. My overall impression is that this beer is a good solid brown that well made quite good even if not among the best. This would be a good beer for an evening of dinner and conversation with friends."
"This a fantastic fall beer, and the price is fantastic. I will definitely buy more of this beer."
"Nice and easy to drink. Sierra Nevada got it right again"
"Pretty good beer overall. Smooth and roasty rules the day."
"A really good brown ale, I am glad I had picked it up."
"Picked this up at the Mondial Bier Fest in Strasbourg, France. Clear mahogany pour with one finger head with good retention and lacing. Very nutty, toasty, malty, nose with hints of caramel, and just a touch of coffee and metal. Roasty malts dominate the taste along with an earthy nuttiness with hints of chocolate, toffee, caramel, and just a bit of hoppy bitterness and metal. Very nice balance between the bitter hops and sweet malt. Too many times these types of beers are sickly sweet. Slightly thick mouthfeel with a nice dry, stout-like finish. Another great beer from one of my all-time favorite breweries."
"D - On the hoppy side but a very nice, easy drinking brown ale."
"O-Fantastic beer, perfect for the fall. Isn't too big that you can't have a few, but still lots of flavor so that it remains delicious each glass. Well crafted"
"O: good for the style, and good to me."
"D - Good beer; easy to drink; I really thought that this was a good beer; brewers could have done more though to separate themselves from the usual brown nut ale taste"
"O: tasty but not particularly memorable."
"Overall: A very good nut brown ale. The hops and roasted malt are in perfect balance. Very drinkable."
"A very nice and sessionable brown ale."
"Great fall beer!"
"A nice subtle Sierra Nevada offering."
"This is by far one of the best brown ales that I have ever had. Look forward to drinking this one every year. Great flavor, great smell, I absolutely love a brown ale that I can practically chew."
"Not a bad beer but a bit strange. Not as mellow as I would expect."
"Pours a very nice dark golden brown color, nice carbonation, with a very nice one-finger plus tan head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is sweet, malty, with lots of caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some very nice caramel notes. Medium Body, with a nice crisp finish. This is a very nice American Brown Ale."
"O-A bit astringent on the roast to be my favorite brown, but very nice in colder weather."
"O - A classic fall beer that never disappoints. The flavors are clean and both warming and refreshing for that fall transitional period."
"O- this is a nice beer. Great taste. Perfect representation of fall. Loved it."
"Edit: Made ""Black and Tans"" (sort of) with Smutty Robust Porters. They didn't have the classic BnT look, but they tasted great."
"Appearance is a dark translucent brown. Head is off white, small. Good lacing. Smells of roasted coffee and malts. Tiny bit of brown sugar and earthiness. Taste is coffee, caramel, bread, malty and finishes with some crisp hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, yet gives some bite on the tongue. Overall this is one of my favorite autumn browns. It feels and looks like fall."
"O: I wasn't sure what to expect from an autumn brown ale, but this was really good. Perfect in a mug and when it's cold outside."
"Overall, this is a decent brew, but not the best brown I've had, and certainly not the best beer from this brewery."
"o: pretty good beer, not as good as other browns, but this holds it's own."
"I enjoyed this beer, and I will probably pick up a six pack next time I'm at the store."
"O- Pretty good offering, good take on a non marzen or pumpkin fall beer."
"O: very good beer, it's definitely fall-like. I wish it had a touch more spice of sorts, but that's all."
"Pours a cherry chestnut brown, almost cola looking, with a 1 finger head and minimal visible carbonation. Slight coffee/toffee notes on the nose, sweet malts, almost an extract type scent thrown in as well. Sweet malts fill the palate, slight nuts, and toffee swirl around, and hint of bittering from the hops. Light on the body, easy to drink, sweet and bitter. Overall this is an easy to drink brown ale with alot of character, def worth trying out."
"O - Just a nice clean tasting Brown. Not over-hopped like some American browns, not overly malted as well. Nice sessionable beer."
"O/D-Not on par with a Celebration Ale as a seasonal. But I think I like it better than their Summer and Spring seasonal. Solid. Good for Autumn of course."
"Served ice cold on tap. Poured a glorious ruddy amber topped with a finger of thick white foam. Not a whole lot of aroma. As it warms the flavor comes through but the aroma stays muted. It has a pleasing, sweet malt flavor, very agreeable. Nice carbonation, great finish, just an all-around enjoyable beer. For me to praise a brown ale it better be good!"
"Overall - I was glad I tried it and I really liked it at first but by the finish I didn't find it as charming as I first thought or as others described. Not a bad beer though but nothing special for a brown ale."
"Overall: Another great offering in the form of a brown ale from the Sierra Nevada lineup. I found a new addition to my autumn selection. I took a gamble committing to a 1/6th keg without trying it first, but Sierra Nevada hasn't failed me yet. If you like Brown Ales, give it a try."
"O - A good fall beer that has great characteristics that all go together. No flavor overpowers the others, and the medley of tastes flow into each other well."
"O: Excellent brown ale. Very smooth, well balanced, and enjoyable."
"Overall: solid American brown ale, great for fall drinking. well balanced. both flavor and aroma improve as it warms up."
"O- Quite yummy autumn ale. Malty goodness."
"Overall: This is a decent brown ale. Definitely worth trying, though there are definitely better brown ales out there."
"Pours a rich mahogany color with a sticky foam like head. Nice lacing and malt nose. The flavor is predominantly coffee, malt with a slight bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is excellent with finely crafted carbonation. This is a terrific fall seasonal without the sweetness that most breweries pump out this time of year."
"More true to the English style browns. Not as hoppy as I would have liked Sierra to do here but overall exceeded my expectations. Will definitely be picking up some bottles."
"O-Good for rainy fall days and the cooling transition from Summer to Fall. The light body keeps it from needing a cold-weather complement, but its strong roast and mild bitterness kill the chill."
"O: Another solid offering from SN. I love this brewery. $8.99 6-er great value here."
"Overall, an excellent fall seasonal. Perfect for cooler autumn weather. Really delivers in the rich, dark, roasted malt department."
"Overall, this beer is both somewhat light and drinkable yet layered and flavorful. Although there is a varied flavor profile, however, each characteristic is a bit thin, making this somehow not as satisfying as it could be."
"Overall it's a good beer. I was hoping to find something that tasted a bit ""warmer"" for a brown ale. The toastyness of the beer was good but for a brown ale this seemed a tad more on the hoppy side."
"O: Decent. It's balanced, but as a result nothing really stands out to me. Wish for more caramel, brown sugar and almond notes in a brown ale, hence the grade. I preferred this more last year, though I'm sure it's the same recipe, and my palate has changed."
"O: This is a really good brown to which I plan on returning. Really could be more than a seasonal."
"O : Excellent"
"enh..."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, less carbonation than you'd expect from the pour and pretty smooth. Overall, a great fall beer. Great for watching football and relaxing. Will probably be picking up a case of this in the near future."
"O: One of my favorite brown ales. Very sessionable."
"Notes: I guess it was time to try it, but did not feel inclined to get into the sixer… I confess that I´m rarely enticed by an American Brown Ale. Grabbing the single revealed a pleasing and quality quaff. One could have it again socially without much fanfare."
"Color is dark brown with maroon highlights when held to light. The generous tan head is long lasting and leaves lots of lacing. Roasted malts are noted in the smell, with a hint of citrus. The taste is primarily roasted malt, caramelly and nutty, with some herbal hop taste in the finish. Nicely balanced, and a beer fitting for autumn."
"A decent, workhorse Brown Ale from Sierra Nevada. It lacks a bit of a hop kick to really make it work though."
"O-Overall a really solid brown ale, I could absolutley have more than one of these at a time!"
"This is a moderately dark, reddish-brown ale, transparent, with a fizzy, short-lived head. The aroma is very inviting...malt and nut, earthy and slightly smokey, a little toast, and a fleeting touch of fruit. Some slight hop scents as well. The taste is moderate in its intensity, with a malt-centric bend. Fairly low in carbonation, and a little lighter in body than I would have preferred. The bottom line is that this is a fairly good and drinkable beer...but not exceptional or really remarkable."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Color is deep, deep mahogany, like a dark ruby red. Head is a one-inch thick fluffy, creamy pillow of froth. The head dissipates to an even film of bubbles across the top. Pretty decent sticky lacing. This beer tastes solid, a more richly flavored brown ale. Toffee, caramel, and roasty malts are present. Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated, but really nice, this beer doesn't feel watered down. Overall, this is a fine Autumn beer. It's easily sessionable. It's along the same lines as a Breckenridge Autumn Ale, for comparison. Great for a chilly evening, I'd recommend trying this one if you like Autumn Ales."
"A perfectly clear amberish brown with a huge head and chunky lacing. Smell is sweet with faint molasses and brown bread. Hops are evident with an earthy body and mildly sharp edge. Taste is exceptional. Rich malty body with a clean earthed hops finish. English style mineral undertone firms up the dryness while leaving a lovely toasted brown bread in the finish. A bit of butter and sweet mild molasses. Feel is crisp and lightly creamy with a lovely suppleness to the light medium weight. This is super drinkable and goes with pizza as well as traditional hearty fall fare. A great American brown. Stock up on tis one."
"O - This is a great Fall beer. It is really drinkable and has a well-balanced and subtle flavor profile. I could definitely drink a couple of these in a single session and be very happy."
"O. A Good fall seaonal brew. The balance was good and the biterness lingers on the tongue."
"O: Overall this is a pretty good beer. Nothing really jumps out at me, but I did drink it pretty quickly, so I must have liked it!"
"O - A very solid brown ale and certainly a surprising treat. Wish I had brought a bottle back with me from my visit."
"Overall this is a good beer, I am just not all the in to brown ales."
"O: This beer is a very good brown ale and a perfect Autumn beer. It is tasty, rich, and wonderfully satisfying."
"O: Pretty good ale, it's a nice change from the watered down oktoberfest fall selection. Worth a try for sure."
"O - I like this beer and have had it many times. I think this is an EXTREMELY ACCESSIBLE craft beer. If you're trying to get someone to step outside their BMC comfort zone and discover what real flavor is... this could be an excellent first step. That being said, this is also a very enjoyable beer for the more ""sophisticated"" drinker. Put it this way - if you LOVE beer but not everyone you know is as enthusiastic as you are, this is what you should bring to Thanksgiving. Everyone will love it, including you. It's not perfect, but it's got something for everyone. Recommended."
"Too much carbonation."
"It was ok but not something that I'll be rushing out to have again."
"O: Sierra Nevada makes some simple, yet remarkable beers. This one, however, is just simple. It has good flavor, sure, but it’s lacking in a few key areas. A pleasant drink, but nothing more."
"Very good complexity but not overly done."
"Overall a nice fall Brown Ale - the aroma was no where near what I experienced for taste. Definitely the biggest difference I've experienced there. Nice autumn session beer and definiely a good alternative to the flooded Octoberfest market."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good American Brown Ale. Everything about this beer was pretty good with nothing seeming off or out of place about it and the drinkability was really good, it just had the right combination of flavor and smoothness that made them go down quicker then expected, a six pack during a nice fall bonfire would for sure hit the spot. What I like most about this beer was the appearance, it looked exactly how I would want a Brown Ale to look, and the nice flavor was also very noteworthy. If I had to choose something I liked the least about this beer it would have to be the aroma, it was good, but the sweet dark fruits seems a little weird, but that really wasn't a big deal at all. I would for sure buy this beer again, there's a good chance I will be getting another twelve pack before it disappears for the year. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone, and if Brown Ales are your thing then they don't get much more drinkable then this. This beer makes my top three Brown Ale list but I still think Indian Brown is my favorite. This was another good beer from Sierra Nevada, every style I try from them always seem like a good drinkable representation of the style and this beer is no different, thanks for sending your quality brews to Michigan Sierra Nevada."
"O - Good, solid brown ale. You dont get any shit beers from these guys."
"perfect for the season. pours a mahogany brown color, ruby red when held up to the setting sun. big creamy tan head that only reduces slightly as it sits. has a fantastic rich roasted flavor with just a hint of booze coming through as it warms. i think its lighter body is a double edged sword... it doesnt all the way stand up to the chilly wind outside because its light in my belly, but at the same time, i could put a 6pack of these away no problem. delicious!"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice coca cola colored beer. It poured a nice fluffy tan head that had a great malty smell to it. The beer was smooth with a slight caramel taste. This is a really great tasting beer and I will certainly buy again."
"Tumbler pours a lovely brown color with a pillowy tan head. The smell is faint with notes of caramel. The taste is toasty with nice notes of caramel and grain. The mouthfeel is smooth to the point of being silky. There is a nice roasted aftertaste. Overall this is a very tasty beer."
"O: Pretty tasty brown ale. Has a nice fruit component that most do not have and is very easy drinking. Not my favorite brown, but better than most."
"Update: I sampled the 2014 version in the fall variety pack and thought it was slightly less hearty and rich than previous versions. I'm not sure if this is due to a slight change in the recipe or a cloudy memory on my part.  Nevertheless, I thought it was relevant to mention it as an addendum."
"Drinkability: The taste makes up for everything the smell lacks; it is very bold and aggressive. I am really impressed and eager to have another."
"D- Aside from the slightly more bitter taste than I would like I found this beer to be very enjoyable. One of my favorite browns. Pick this up every fall if you can."
"Pours with moderate turbidity as a deep copper brown. Gives way to a thick, three finger, almond brown head, with good retention and wonderful lacing plastered all over the walls of the glass. Toasty almonds and caramel on the nose, very faint hop aromas, simple but delightful. The flavor is malty and nutty, toasted almonds again, toffee, caramel, cocoa and milk chocolate linger in the shadows. Very nice finish, mouthfeel is creamy and balanced, velvety and slightly sweet, very sessionable. This beer is not complex, just an excellent example of what a brown should be. Sometimes its nice to drink something simple and just plain good."
"As much as I really like most from Sierra Nevada this was not one of them for me."
"D/O- Classic Sierra Nevada. Easy to find, cheap, and worth a try. Cheers."
"Overall this is a good beer for the fall at an affordable price. Not sure I'll buy it again this year, but I'll probably look for it again next year."
"O- Great drinkability, nice autumn/fall beer. Sierra Nevada rarely disappoints."
"O-this is good. real good. i remember having this a long time ago and feeling indifferent about it, but this time it just hit the spot. this so easy to drink. i'm very proud of my self for going with the 6-pack. although i'd love to know what Sierra Nevada could come up with for a pumpkin beer or oktoberfest, but i appreciate the originality with this one. good job SN!"
"Dark but not opaque chestnut brown with a nice nutty smell. Small off-white head with a surprising amount of lacing. Caramel, toasted nuts, some coffee, some pine hops and a drying character on the back of the tongue--almost too drying! Overall a pretty tasty beer, especially with the right food pairing."
"D - A very solid very respectable brown ale... All the parts work together to create a wonderful harmony... More than the sum of its parts... An excellent fall seasonal offering..."
"O: Very enjoyable to look at and taste. Will definitely have more."
"a good stab at the style and worth trying. not worth going out of your way for but definitely give it a shot if you see it."
"Smells of three heavy hitters; coffee, cocoa, and caramel. Bounces off the tongue reminiscent of the smell. Cocoa, dark burnt malts smoothly glides with a medium body, just a hint of sweet marshmallow reminds one its autumn again. Overall a solid seasonal, one that makes me very excited for the colder seasons as those are just as good here in CO as are the warm ones"
"VERY GOOD, GIVE IT A GO!"
"Overall - What a nicely balanced and complex brown ale. Complex with all of the flavors playing equal parts. Not overly sweet at all, very thirst quenching. Enjoying my first one during Monday Night Football, you should too - highly recommend, and a very good representative of the style."
"Overall Impression- A very drinkable brown ale. I would categorize this one as an English Brown but no worries. Sierra Nevada is known for their hops and strength. This one I just had to try. Probably won't be going back to it but wouldn't pursaude anyone to not to try it."
"O: This one is pretty good. Picked it up with a mix a six and it's pretty good."
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not too filling, mild kick, nice representation of style. This is a nice autumn beer; very easy to throw back a few."
"O: yet another exceptional beer from our good friends at Sierra Nevada. Now I want a Celebration Ale..."
"Overall an incredible brown ale. Find some and drink it."
"O - maybe I got an old one it was picked up as a single. Its worth trying. overall nice brown ale"
"Poured a 3"" beige head. Clear dark burnt umber brown body. Smells very mildly of malt and even after warmed not much smell. Taste is also very mild, mainly malt, and with some imagination the slightest hint of cocoa butter, but all in all mild. Not hoppy. Although a decent drinkable beer I just don't find anything too remarkable about it."
"Poured from the classic stubby SN bottle. Mahogany brown color with copper highlights. Thick head of with a nice lacing. Faint aroma of toasted malt with hints of coffee and smoke. Flavors of toasted medium dark malts, caramel and brown sugar. Mild bitterness. Firm mouthfeel, full and creamy. Very tasty and drinkable beer. What a great beer for a fall football tailgating weekend! Go Tigers!"
"O: For a seasonal brown ale, this is quite tasty. I'm not a huge fan of many autumn offerings, and this is certainly above-par. That being said, when judged independent of its season, this beer is nothing too special."
"Poured a nice rich brown color, with a good taupe head that hangs around for awhile. Nice aromas of roasted nuts, good milk chocolate and maybe a little lightly roasted malt. Somewhat dry on the palate, with some roasted malt, chocolate and a late bitterness. Pretty solid. Really a let down on tap."
"A perfect beer to kick off fall, especially when you tire of Festbier/Octoberfest offerings. Color is deep, clear reddish-brown with a tan, thick head on top that sticks around. Foamy, rich lacing all the way down the glass. Nutty flavors, mild malt balanced by mellow hops and some raisin flavored sweetness. Good body, not an overly thick mouthfeel, but this is a rich beer overall. The alcohol kicks a bit, but this is cool weather warmer, and it fills that role perfectly. Quite drinkable for a heavier style beer. Recommended highly."
"Overall / Drinkability: Very drinkable - gone in almost no time at all. A nice balanced brown ale with strong hop and malt flavors. A very nice fall offering and I could easily have another one. I like the combination of malt and hops with this one - well balanced and the two compliment each other well."
"Soft and creamy, pleasant nose, and it’s beer, what’s not to like!"
"Overall, I'm going to have to get a few more bottles of this. It's a good beer for the fall, so they didn't even miss on the name. In the end, a very satisfying brew."
"I give a Schlitz for Tumbler."
"Notes: Beautiful looking, very tasty beer. A nice Brown Ale and a real marker into the world of cooler weather and darker beers. Nice, a keeper."
"Compared to Long Trail's Harvest Ale (my other favorite Brown Ale) this is the true winner. A fall classic. Well done, Sierra Nevada."
"Overall: Good beer, very drinkable, not to bitter and not too sweet. Good balanced beer. I like this beer and would definitely buy this again, another Sierra Nevada quality beer."
"Overall-Sierra Nevada just does it right. Impressive on so many levels. Every beer they put out is solid. While other breweries are brewing beers w/ Bacon, Quadrupal IPAs, Stouts aged in Tequilla; Sierra Nevada is just making quality beer after quality beer. Well Done."
"O - a nice ABA and seasonal brew."
"Overall I would say this is probably the barometer for an american brown. Terrific malt backbone, and just a kiss of hops in there to differentiate it from it's english counterpart. Will definitely be getting more of this before the season is over. Aside from the hemisphere beers that SN does, this is right up there with my favorites."
"O: Dissapointing. I really wanted another cheap go-to brown. This failed. To much hop bitterness for my brown tastes."
"O- Way too watery. This beer was kind of a mess, did not blend together well. Drinkable, sure; a disappointment from Sierra Nevada though, definitely."
"Solid Brown Ale that I'd like to try from the tap."
"O: A nice, rich, sweet beer. The overall impression is not one of cloying sweetness, but actually balance with the the hops and the dry finish. Another solid offering from Sierra Nevada."
"It came in a brown bottle. It gave a two finger rootbeer like head. The color is dark brown with inviting red highlights. I could see almost nothing through the mug. There was some transluscence but the beer borders on the opaque.The head maintained for a few minutes more then half its initial thickness. There is a moderate amount of carbonation bubling apparent. It smells hoppy and yeasty to me. The malty sweetness is quite evident without beeing overpowering. The thickness is moderate. There is light to moderate short bunchy-lined lacing. There is a nutty chocalatey taste. After becoming acclimatized to more hoppy beers I can tell the hops are there but the bitterness is more ballanced. It seems well buit. There is a pleasant stickiness left on the roof of my mouth. I could drink another and would if i could right now. I'm not used to drinking brown ales so this is sort of an introduction for me."
"This stuff is great. Very drinkable and an excellent example of a warming fall beer."
"Nose of malt and co2. Flavor is malty with slight hop bitterness twinge. The big selling point for this beer has to be the toasty brown flavor it brings forward without adding a heavy finish. Good gateway beer for your non ""beer drinker"" friends and nice for kicking back a few pints. Certainly not an incredible piece of beer artistry though."
"Good offering from Sierra Nevada."
"O: very drinkable. Smooth, great tasting brown ale. Perfect mix of malt and sweetness."
"I liked this one a bit more than A."
"Overall: A fantastic fall seasonal. For a ""standard"" beer category, Sierra Nevada does a great job staying within guidelines while not compromising on flavor. Definitely find this beer if you like more malt-forward brown ales. Smooth, drinkable, and relaxed. Great for autumn afternoons and evenings."
"Overall- Another successful beer from SN. Really enjoyed it. Cheers"
"Could easily have a few. Good example of the style"
"O: Great fall offering from sierra, finish makes it a solid beer."
"This brew pours out a medium-dark color that's not quite as dark as most browns, and it has a nice head on it that takes a while to dissipate. It has a pleasant malty smell that's got light chocolate and nutty tones to it. It's not a heavy brown ale. Tumbler goes down nice and smooth, a thick and malty beverage that's very bread-like without a whole lot of bite. It's a great beer for the Fall season."
"Overall: Not my favorite style by far, but another winner from SN. A great beer!"
"O – I really enjoy this; it’s a perfect addition to the SN seasonal release schedule. I personally don’t like Pumpkin or Oktoberfest beers, so this fits the bill as a great replacement for fall."
"Dr: It's cheap but forgettable. Leave this for committed fans of the style. I'm unimpressed."
" :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) (: (: (: (: (: (: (: (: (: (: (: (: (: (: (:"
"o- Fantastic brown ale. One of my favorite fall seasonals."
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark amber with an off-white, long lasting, thick head. Aroma is of herbal hops up front, then dark fruit and caramel come through as the beer warms up. Light-medium, smooth body. Toasted malt, herbal spicy hops and dark fruit fill the mouth. The finish is long, hoppy and dry. Tasty session brew."
"Overall this is a great ABA and i would purchase it again"
"Overall not too bad for a Brown Ale."
"Has a deep bronze color with a beige head dissipates at moderate speed leaving excellent lacing. The nose consists primarily of nuts, some caramel and leather. The taste is very nutty and toasty some wood, leather and brown sugar sweetness; fruity on the finish. Mouthfeel is hearty without being sticky or chewy. A solid brown ale especially enjoyable in fall or winter"
"Dark brown but translucent. Small amount of big bubbly head. Roasted malt, some copper bitterness. Slightly earthy/nutty. Somewhat of an earthy hop character but more of an earthy nut aroma. Burnt caramel, bready malt for the flavor with a earthy nut finish. Crisp but also roasted and earthy bitter for the finish. Malts dominate but Sierra busts out some hop flavors for this one."
"Overall: A very good fall/winter brew that I would seek out again. Would like to try this on tap sometime."
"A decent, simple, incredibly easy drinking brown ale. I prefer Sierra Nevada's previously brewed (now retired?) Brown Ale."
"Very good brown ale, and I don't usually care for the style. Pours a dark chocolaty brown with a nice off-white head that retains as a thin layer. Smells of dark roasted malts, nutty, with hints of chocolate and resiny hops. Kind of reminds me of autumn. Nice helping of roast in the taste, dark malts, very obvious chocolate notes, toffee, pine. No one flavor comes out too strong; very well-balanced and not strong or heavy at all. About middle-of-the road medium-bodied, and pleasantly drinkable."
"O - Overall an excellent brown ale, and an excellent offering from SN."
"This is a very drinkable brown. Quite tasty!"
"Overall- For some reason, I liked last years batch more. I was excited to see this on the shelf again, but it didn't live up to my memories. This was my fall beer last year. Might need something else this year."
"O: this is an amazing brown ale; to this point then best I have had. Every year it is among the top of my list to look fo on the shelves as far as seasonals. It makes me think of a late september or early october day thats still warm but damp and rainy. This beer and a movie are perfecte for that day."
"Mouthfeel is dry and kind of gritty. Overall, this is a pretty good beer."
"Overall: A very good version of an American Brown Ale from Sierra Nevada. Robust, complex, and very well balanced."
"Pours out a dark brown hue with a whitehead that leaves some really good lacing and retention. The smell is chocolate, and some roasted malts. The taste consists of chocolate, maple, a hint of hops, and some sweet malts that make this a really good tasting beer. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and easy drinking. A must try brown ale."
"O: A solid beer; not especially unique but one that I'll be having again. There's a definite seasonal quality to the beer that I can't quite pin down, but it's something to look forward to in the early fall."
"Overall - I was very impressed. One of the better brown ales I've ever had."
"O - It's a great brown ale, nice to have as a seasonal beer. But it's still no Bell's Best Brown. But i'm not complaining..."
"Overall this is an excellent brown ale and a perfect beer for watching football in the fall."
"Pours a nice medium dark brown w/ very little cocoa head. Very little carbonation, and below average lacing. Nose is that of yeast, malt, some hops, yeast, and smoke. Taste is very thin and dry from what I was expecting. I'm wondering if the tap line was clean, because this beer really disappointed me based on the glowing reviews I've read. Mouthfeel is dry, w/ a little hop bite/malt smoothness. Overall I wouldn't look for this again. I might pick up a bottle at some point, and will adjust my review accordingly if needed."
"It pours a dark brown color with hints of orange. Nothing really stands out in the taste. There are some hints of nuts, some roast, and some caramel. But it's full, earthy, easy to drink, and delicious. Perfect for a day of watching football. Very nice autumn ale here"
"O: A first rate Brown Ale that is simple but quite enjoyable, this beer exudes 'autumn' in a good way. The roasted characters balance the sweetness very well."
"Bottle pours a solid brown color into a pint glass. Smell is a slight sweet brown sugar and possibly some hazelnut. Taste is a very light brown sugar and some slight roasted malts with very little in terms of hops or bitterness. This is very light bodied and easy to drink. A nice fall seasonal."
"D- Not a bad beer but the lingering taste of mint throughout has me not enjoying it too much and I wouldn't mind just a little more hops or alcohol in the mix."
"Overall: In my opinion this is a very nice brown ale. It's not my favorite style, but this is one of the better ones that I've tried. Perfect beer to kick of the cool weather. I will be frequenting this one for sure."
"Overall: Has some interesting qualities especially the malts but I find the balance off and it isn't entirely drinkable unless you specific like a coarser heavier malt brown ale."
"After the pour this one is a great deep mahogany brown with a nice and thick light khaki head. Great ruby red highlights when held up to the light, just a touch shy of clear. The smell is of beautiful roasty malts. Nice caramels and a bit of toffee with a touch of west coast hop and some light yeasty ester. The taste reminds you that this is an american brown without overdoing it. Sure there are some west coast citrus and pine hops in there but the focus remains the malt and the balance lies a touch to the malt side. Granted this beer has way more hop than an english leaning brown ale but there it is clear it's a brown ale. The mouthfeel too is pretty good. A moderate body and and medium levels of carbonation with a finish that is slightly drying with a lingering roast malt character. Overall this is a very solid brown ale. The low alcohol and great taste make it good for a session. I've always been a big brown ale fan and I look forward to this one every Autumn."
"O - yeah, this is a good beer. Sierra Nevada always does a good job."
"Pours a nice 2 finger head with a lace that clings to the glass. Dark mocha brown in appearance. Smells of sweet malt, molasses,with a hint of brown sugar. Tastes of sweet toasted malt yeast and oats. Touch of hop bitterness near the end. This is the only brown ale besides Dogfish that I have had that I like. While not quite up to the level of DF it is probably a better representation of the style. I find most brown ales to be too sweet, but this one gets it right. Sweet but not overly so."
"O: Good beer, not my fav, but good."
"A really simple and clean offering from SN, the Tumbler is a great example of what it takes to be a solid example of the brown ale style. Pronounced but simple nuttiness. Great light body and super sessionable. Worth picking up a sixer for sure."
"O: This is a very enjoyable beer and would be approachable to folks who don't normally drink craft beer. Sierra Nevada rarely misses and Tumbler is no exception."
"A smooth malty brown ale, with some nice, nuanced malt flavors, but I with it had a bit more to offer-maybe some hop character in the aroma and flavor. Easy drinking and nice for this time of year."
"Overall: A tasty well-balanced beer. Very refreshing and easy to drink."
"This is a solid beer. Sierra Nevada's second best seasonal. Second only to my beloved Celebration Ale."
"O: Bought this to kick off the football season as well as the autumn weather. Exactly what I was looking in a fall seasonal- flavorful with a thick body yet the ability to drink multiple in a sitting. Very nice packaging, too, fits the brew perfectly."
"O. Brown Ale is far from being one of my favourite beer styles but I've come to look forward to Tumbler season. It's just a little high on the ABV to be considered a true session beer but I wouldn't supping this all evening."
"Prosit!"
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clear dark brown color with ruby hints and a 3 finger soapy light tan head. Good lacing. Smell: Burnt malt with just a hint of caramel. Taste: Smoky roasted malt up front followed by sweet caramel in the middle and mildly bitter hops at the finish. Aftertaste is both smoky and bitter. Flavor, like the aroma, is a bit subdued. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a high amount of carbonation. Tingles a little on the tongue. Drinkability: Good drinkability. You could knock back a few of these without any trouble. Overall: Solid beer overall and a good representation of the style. Very solid choice for a crisp autumn day."
"Overall: Tumbler is one of the better brown ales available as a seasonal. The flavor profile could be bolder, and less carbonation would sure help the mouth feel of this one."
"O: Uncomplicated and straightforward, a good beer for a fall weekend after raking the leaves or during the big game. Pretty sure I'll be buying this again before the season is over."
"I ordered this on recommendation from staff. Not bad at all. Very malty. Typical Brown Ale style in my opinion. Not too boozy for me. Dark in color. I don't drink brown ales too often but I think this is a great style. Almost similar to stouts or porters I would think. Overall, I'd order this again."
"Overall: Full flavored, refreshing, smooth, drinkable autumn brew that is perfect for the crisp bite of fall weather (and football season)."
"O: A bottled brown ale by Sierra Nevada. Unfortunately, I want to like this beer much more than I actually do."
"O - A good brown, not overly complex in the taste department, but worthy of sampling."
"O: A simple yet delicious american brown that does the style justice. You can always count on SN for that"
"Pours a clear dark iced tea color with a 1 inch puffy light brown head that settles to a thin cap. Nice rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, slight caramel, and some spices. Taste is of toasted bread, burnt caramel, and a spicy flavor on the finish. There is a bitter spice taste that lingers on the back of the tongue after each sip. The carbonation level on this one is good with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good brown ale that is very appropriate for a Fall beer. The toasty malt smells and flavors remind me very much of the season."
"After being impressd by Ovila on tap and a huge fan of British Browns I figured I'd try some other SN. This beer looks good nice head with lacing. The smell is toast, caramel, and almost a cross between a german dunkel and a nut brown. The taste is not bad, and the hop used are an interesting twist on the style. I guess that is the explaination for an ""American"" Brown Ale (american hops). Seemed a bit over carbonated. The beer kind of explodes in your mouth. I prefer more mellow carbonation for the style."
"I like the way this beer looks. Big fluffy head, tan colored, and it leaves attractive looking lace behind. The beer itself is a warm reddish brown color and clear, letting light pass through casually. Aroma is wholesomely malty and comforting. Kind of like freshly baked pumpkin bread minus the pumpkin. It is also a little bit buttery, with decomposing leaves, and apple cider. Nice mix of scents. Taste is malty and a little darker than the scent. More leafiness, some dank bitter hops, with both nuttiness and woodiness. This beer is fitting of its name. The body is medium, with moderate to mellow carbonation. Somewhat slick texture with an added grittiness. Overall a solid brown ale, fitting of the fall season. Also rather sessionable making the 12 pack a good choice."
"O: A not disappointing beer but not as outright satisfying as some of SN’s other offerings. I think it would be a much nicer ale if it were bottle-conditioned and/or offered on nitro."
"Tumbler Autumn Brown Ale is a very dark brown, almost black, cola colored brew. When held to the light you'll notice the body is mostly dormant, I just saw a lone carbonation bubble rise up. Topping the beer is a large, pillowy, tan colored head, with a lot of lace left in its wake. The nose has a lot going one, caramel and chocolate malt, a bit of smoke, some spice and cinnamon, maybe a touch of coffee and some nut tones as well. The taste is kinda like your classic nut brown ale, but they did a great job moving it beyond that. Starts with a toasted caramel malt front, a bit of chocolate, fairly bitter from the hop, some well blended spices, a touch of cinnamon, nutty, a bit of fruitiness from the yeast, just a touch of brown sugar. Medium bodied and fairly sharp on the tongue."
"This is an awesome little brown ale from one of the best craft breweries in the US. Nice head and malty taste. This beer is perfect for all year long to me but I can see an all fall drinking beer. Great beer to watch football. This is not your normal brown ale. I will be buying more before the end of fall."
"This pours a dark brown color with a nice tan head with good retention and a nice lacing. The smell is more of roasted malts than I expected, a little coffee, a little brown sugar. Feel is medium. Taste is pretty good, I get some brown sugar, caramel, roasted nuts, with a bitter roasted malt / hop finish. Overall this is a pretty fine brown ale, I actually got it expecting it would be sweeter and I could give it to friends when they come over, I don't see them liking it though so I'll just have to drink the whole thing (its good so that shouldn't' be a problem). Another fine beer from a brewery which seldom disappoints."
"SN did it again. Another affordable beer with a lot of good flavor that could prove to be a gateway for folks just getting into trying craft brews."
"Final Thoughts: A really great brew for fall. It's a pretty perfect standby for the season. I very much enjoyed and will be returning to this one."
"O - I used to LOVE Brown ales. With experiencing other styles this has pushed the brown a bit further back on my list. However, I'm talking English Browns.. This is an American Brown and when it comes to ABA, I havent much experience. This is a good tasting brew, but IMO needs to have a little more of the killer flavors it has. More flavor and it'd have been an A+ brew to me."
"O: If this were year round it would definitely replace the Newcastle in the fridge. A great nut-brown with just the right amount of spice to it."
"A solid brown ale. Had this on tap on City Tap House. Served to me with no head in a standard pint glass but I could easily imagine you get some sort of tan foamy head. Appears brown in color with reddish amber highlights. Very malt forward in aroma & taste. Light roast notes in aroma. Somewhat nutty in taste with flashes of caramel, light cocoa, maybe a little vanilla, some chocolate. Light in mouthfeel with nice even bitterness. Better as it warms - please don't drink cold as it was served to me. A very solid beer overall."
"This another exceptional offering by Sierra Nevada, and if it became a regular offering I'd consider making it my go-to brown ale."
"Overall, this is a good brown ale. The roasted malts are balanced nicely by the sweetness and slight bitterness. The beer has a nice complexity which makes it a good choice for the fall season."
"Mahogany brown colored with burnished copper highlights. Thick head of tightly bubbled foam that lingers long. Low ara of toasted malt, hints of coffee and smoke. Flavors of toasted medium dark malts, caramel and oak bark, some brown sugar, dried leaves and leather. Mild bitterness. Firm mouthfeel, full and creamy. Very tasty and drinkable beer."
"Very good fall beer, watch the leaves fall and enjoy."
"O) This is a very good brown ale, and it is certainly worthy of a six pack pickup for the upcoming football season."
"This was a top-notch brown. I would have expected nothing less from such a phenomenal brewery like Sierra Nevada."
"Overall - Not my favority brown ale for fall but its still a decent beer. I guess I was expecting a little more from Sierra Neveda since they usually are top notch for me."
"O: Another good brew from the cats at Sierra Nevada. Great session beer in my opinion, I could drink them year round. I am looking to buy the property that is pictured on the label. Props to gator breath down in Fiji for bringing this offering to the table at a nice price."
"O: A tasty brown ale. Too bad it's only around for a short time. Could drink it year 'round. Pairs well with sharp cheddar on a Ritz cracker."
"O: A very good brown ale. Looks outstanding in the glass. A touch too much malt for my taste, almost like a roasted maibock."
"O: really loved the taste of this brew, drinks light but with deep flavor, i can see where this would be a phenomenal brew on a crisp fall night, i looked forward to those nights now because of this brew"
"On tap. Pours a dark mahogany color with over an inch of frothy tan head. Very little lacing. Aroma is nutty, malty and sweet. Hints of caramel and maybe a tiny bit of coffee. Flavor is much like the aroma. Sweet, malty, and nutty. Somewhat of a hazelnut taste to it. Creamy mouthfeel. This is a solid Autumn beer. Overall, worth grabbing in the Autumn months for sure."
"Overall: Very nice flavor. One of the better browns I have had. Its flavorful, not bitter and less watered down than many browns out there."
"A great brown ale that I would love all year round. Much less hop than you'd think from a sierra, but they are still there more than in most. A very good brown indeed and an excellent early autumn beer, which will be right around the celebration release right?"
"Overall, this is a great autumn brown, heavy with grain flavors and perfect to celebrate the coming of fall. Only the slight over-bitterness of the hops mars what is otherwise a fantastic brew."
"O - A nice autumn session beer. I could see myself throwing back a few of these during a fall bonfire. However, its 85 degrees out. Why do seasonals keep coming out earlier and earlier! Still a solid offering at a great price."
"D- Its a nice easy drinker definitely. The flavour strength and profile just isnt prominent enough for me. Sessionable but just not interesting enough."
"This beer poured out as a clear looking brown color with a decent looking head on to. The lacing was minimal and the head faded kind face. the smell of the beer was roasted and a little nutty. The flavor of the beer is pretty good, it's got a little bit of autumn spice to it with the roasted nuts and malts. There isn't a lot of hops in this one. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth and is almost medium bodied. Overall it's not a bad brown ale. It's worth trying if you like this brewery or this style."
"A brown to amber color with a light beige colored head a half inch high settled on the glass. Malt is the strength of the aroma, with cracked grain and touch caramel, along with a sugary syrup scent. A hearty malt flavor with a dark bread and cracked flavors in there as well. It finishes with a mild grassy bitterness that counters the sweetness. A watery thin feel at the front of each taste, then it grow to become more of medium bodied feel that lasts till the end. It finishes with a light dryness on the back of the palate. This beer is a classic American Brown Ale with the malt being the back bone and the most prevalent characteristic found in the aroma and taste. It stays the line in the style very, very drinkable."
"D. Classy beer, one of Sierra Nevada's better offerings for me personally. Very enjoyable."
"O- A solid brown ale, great when you're in the mood for something rich without being weighty or thick."
"i have tried alot of the sierra nevadas ,the IPA is awesome.So i thought i would give the tumbler a try and it had a nice amber color, close to an amber marzen nice foam! just threw it in a pint glass was pretty good , would defiantly buy it again :D !!!!"
"T: Roasted malts with a touch of nuttiness and maybe a dash of maple. A slight hoppiness rounds things out. This is a good brown, it just doesn't really have anything to it that really makes it stand out."
"Chocolate brown with a tight-bubbled dirty white head. Very subtle roast lends a hint of cocoa powder smoke to the predominately caramel/toffee laced malt bill. Hops are fairly assertive for the style with a great earthy/woodsy quality that is definitely reminiscent of fall. I wanted a little more out of one of my favorite styles from the king of American craft brewing but it still satisfies enough to warrant a sixer or two each year."
"Not too excited from this beer. You win some, you lose some."
"This didn't really leave a particular impression either way on me, but it was not bad."
"The aroma was very sweet. Lots of hints of caramel and especially maple syrup coming through on this one. The aroma though was thin in depth as once you got past this maple like aroma there was not much else to be found. Maybe some slight roasted grains and a touch of nut like aroma but that was about it, still, not half bad. the flavor followed along the aroma very closely and honestly reminded me of another brew, the Tommyknocker maple brown in that level of sweetness. Tons of maple sugar here and alot of nutty flavors as well. Some nice roasted malt notes as well in here. A slightly grassy and earthy hop flavor in the finish, but everything was completely dominated by the maple syrup like sweetness. A bit too over the top for me to be honest. The feel was very carbonated with a load of bubbles racing through giving it a very soda like feel, nice to see coming out of the can for sure. Light in testure without much of a follow through it came in ok for me, nothing really special, but nowhere near flat in anyway, nor did it really feel very thin."
"D and Overall impression: Drinkability is quite high here at 5.5% I could have quite a few. Overall, I was pretty impressed b this brew. CCB Maduro is the gold standard in the style, but this one isn't far behind. Skal."
"Pours a medium chestnut brown with a single-finger off-white head that stays around for a bit before falling and leaving some spotty lacing behind. The nose has some slight nutty character along with a bit of slightly-roasted malt as a backbone. Slightly dry with a bit of earth. The flavor falls along the same lines. There's nothing too exceptional about this one. I would say that it's a bit hoppy, though not along the ""India Brown Ale"" line--it's got more of an earthy kick to the finish that I'm enjoying. Body is medium with average carbonation. Overall, a solid brew but not quite the level I expect from Sierra Nevada."
"A nice brown ale. The earthiness may get old after a couple, and just not interesting enough to want to drink more than one or two, but a nice fall beer."
"Overall I thought it was an excellent brown ale, the bitterness balanced out the sweet malt really well."
"Taste is mild, but thick and chewy. Hints of slightly roasted malts and a gentle hoppy followthrough. Very delicious and will be a repeat purchase next year!"
"D: very drinkable American Brown Ale. If your tongue has an affinity towards bitterness but want to get away from IPAs and travel further down the malt-spectrum , this is a beer for you."
"One of the better brown ales I ever had as I am not a big fan of the category. Had on tap at a bar in Arlington as well as from a 12 oz bottle. Pours a light brown with large camel colored head. Aroma is light nut, little lacing, and thin soft body. Taste is dark toasty malt, medium lightly roasted nut, a hint of smoke, and finishes with some hops. Good for an English Brown Ale style beer."
"D: It tastes like a pale ale with a few fall flavors thrown in."
"D-Very sessionable, a sold fall beer."
"D- This beer is low in the ABV department making it a good beer to drink with all night. The flavor just brings it all full circle. I would recommend this to everyone who doesn't know if they really like browns as this will change their minds."
"D- On a fall night, this might be better off than an octoberfest. I really enjoyed this and will drink plenty more over the years."
"Crystal clear brown at the pour with a big, white head. Slight roast and pale malt aroma. Flavor is well balanced, but I am not crazy about it at all. Malt flavor is muted and none of the malt character stands out. There is a bracing bitterness that is balanced but not flavorful. An ok beer, but not up there with the best of american brown ales."
"D - Leave it to SN to make such a sessionable Brown Ale, I could easily drink a sixer of this on a nice Fall day."
"D - This is not one of my favorites from Sierra Nevada...I forget what their fall seasonal was before, but I don't think I'll be drinking this one when it comes around again...it had a nice malt and caramel flavor along with a nice finish...but other than that it's pretty one dimensional"
"Light brown head of thick foamy bubbles that leave a very clingy lace on the side of the glass. The beer is a nice dark brown, matching a 26 on the SRM beer color scale. Very transparent, even though it is quite dark, with good light I can read through it. Smell of chestnuts, cinnamon, wheat, apples, and malt. Tastes of golden wheat, toffee, citrus, and barley malt. Goodly amount of body in this one as I swish it around in my mouth. Too bad it is seasonal, but I will be looking forward to the next taste come the almost end of 2011."
"This was a rich dark brown with a nice thick head that was brownish in color as well. The scent had lots of roasted malt with caramel and a hint of citrus to it which got me excited. All of this was in the taste! This was easy to drink and very tasty."
"When this beer was poured it was a dark brown color with a nice 2"" white head to it ,the after a little bit of time left some nice sticky lace around the glass. The smell is of roasted malts and hops. The taste is very nice, had a nice balance of roasted malts and hops with a hint of chocolate. Very smooth and is very drinkable. I would drink this on the back porch during autumn while grilling."
"Great Job on this one!"
"D- A very easy drinking brown ale, very true to the style with a nice amount of smokiness. I think this beer would be absolutely perfect with a great smokey barbeque."
"Not too carbonated and very drinkable. One of the better browns I've had."
"D - an ideal autumn beer. would enjoy tasting this again."
"Pours a dark brown with very little head, barely enough to cover the top. Smells of roasted malts, slight hint of chocolate and caramel, hops also coming through. Taste is very smooth, good balance between the malt and hops initially, with a sweet chocolate taste on the back end. Nothing to complain about on the mouth feel either. Drinkable beer, not the greatest, but very good."
"This one is alright, but I know Sierra Nevada can (and does) do better."
"This was interesting. The flavors of roast, earth, and sweetness all had a fall flair to them but I just don't know if the overall package here really ended up coming together for me. Perhaps this is one that works on you over the course of a few bottles. I'd be willing to investigate this again come next fall."
"My girlfriend gave me a sip of this a few months ago and I immediately fell in love with it. Within a few weeks it was already gone from shelves though, and I thought I'd missed my opportunity till I spied it on a recent supermarket visit and swept it up. This beer paris well with all kinds of hearty food and stands well on its own. Definitely going to become a fall staple for me."
"Tumbler pours a perfect dark brown smellign of roasted malt and nutty goodness. First sip is a mix of hops and chocolate, caramel deliciousness. Nice malt backbone and easy going down. Nice drinkable brown ale for session drinking. Certainly worth your money and time to enjoy."
"Understated to a fault."
"This beer pours a brown color with amber hues. The head is a massive two inches in height, and recedes slowly into nice sticky lacing. The aroma is of caramel, and some faint herbal hops. The taste is like the aroma, but lighter. It is almost watery. The mouthfeel is on the ligher side of medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this beer is quite lacking. I can't see myself drinking this again."
"D - The drinkability is awesome. This is a very nice brown ale. It is smooth and goes down very easy. It is quite refreshing, and I would definitely buy this one again. If you haven't had it yet, give it a try."
"This West Coast beauty has the right goods. Deep mahogany brown, though perhaps a bit ""clean"" looking for a proper brown ale, this is a brew that has copious malting and just a hint of hopping; ah but what beautiful hopping it is. It is a slightly warming brew that will not overwhelm you with alpha acids. Well balanced with a nice roasted chicory flavor and a slightly sweet marshmallow aftertaste, this is a welcome addition to the Sierra family and one I would like to see more ofter produced by other talented brewers. Great effort!"
"D - Good brew."
"12oz (355ml) bottle from Ryan's Party Store in Port Huron, Michigan. Pours dark brown with a faint ruby tinge, one finger of bubbly, beige foam, and sheets of lace on the nonic glass. Smell is nutty, bready, and doughy malts, earthy and floral hops, touch of cream, and some tree bark. Flavour is light chocolate, grainy and roasted malts, slight sweetness, biscuit, brown sugar, and a balancing hop bitterness with fruity and grassy undertones. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp spiciness upfront, brief flash of astringency, quick and toasty finish with very little aftertaste. The palate thins out significantly as the beer warms and the nose is pretty restrained, but aside from these flaws, this is one of the better brown ales that I've tried."
"12 oz single from Fred Meyer, S.Salem. Poured unfortunatlly with a huge billowing head..tan in colour..can make out the clear brown ale underneath Aroma i found lacking, mostly bready, cereal and some weak chocolate. Taste is mellow, semi-sweet and welcoming.Coffee and milk chocolate with some hazelnuts thrown in. Nice. Nice smooth palate makes this a drinkable enough brown ale..though not exceptional in any way."
"Brown ale by definition is rather tame, and typically not my favourite style. However, Sierra Nevada does it justice with their version. Fairly hoppy, but not so much as to push the boundaries of the style. I like the super clean character, it brings the malts into focus. Can't really complain about anything here, about as good as a brown ale gets. Not my first choice at the store or a bar, but I sure wouldn't turn one down either."
"This is definitely interesting to see coming from Sierra Nevada. Not their characteristic hoppy IPA or PA. I'm still a little back and forth on whether or not I like this beer. There is something about the aftertaste that I just can't place that leaves a funny slickness / off flavor."
"Never a disappointment with Sierra Nevada. A very good beer!"
"D - though the overall feel was ordinary, the smooth texture and great taste make this an easy and enjoyable drinker"
"In all honesty, the brown ale has never been a favorite style - if I had a ""go to"" brand, it would be Newcastle Brown. Still, this one is done reasonably well."
"A fine brown ale, and a terrific ""autumnly"" ale, more Octoberfestish than the ales labels as such. Have one, or more, in front of a fire on a cool evening. Recommended."
"Drinkability is good. This is a very decent representation of the style and a beer I would serve for a tailgate session!"
"This is one of better browns that come to mind, for sure. Sierra Nevada rarely goes wrong."
"Such a pleasant beer for a pleasant afternoon. Happy Thanksgiving, BA."
"This is a super drinkable and sessionable brown ale and a great addition to the SN seasonal lineup. This one is still drinking wonderfully, even into the winter months."
"This brew pours a reddish brown hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head and some subtle lacing,the smell is very roasty with hints of roasted malts,toffee and some earthy hops too,the mouthfeel is a little under medium bodied which really suits it and has tastes of roasted malts,toffee,molasses and is finished off with a earthy hop bitterness which is quite bitter,overall im not suprised its a decent drop that is very drinkable from this fine brewery and to be honest could quite easily drink more than two of these if it was a regular to our shores."
"Overall an unusual brown ale. The weird medicinal thing is throwing me off. Not my favorite."
"Ok Session style brown ale, nothing I would run out to buy."
"Drink - An interesting beer, but not something I'd have again. Fans of smoky beers might enjoy this one quite a bit."
"I've had Tumbler several times this fall. I think I was enjoying this more a month or two ago. I am over the fall varieties of beer. It's weird how you look forward to different types of beer, when just a couple of them can satisfy your craving for an entire year. Don't get me wrong, this beer is really good. It's very dark brown, and pours with a great head on top that lasts. I like that it is nutty, but not overly sweet or brown sugary. It reminded me of Newcastle, but even better. I'll be ready to tackle another six pack of this come next fall."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, and semi-dry."
"Out of a squat bomber bottle this beer was a rich, autumnal brown color with some bronze highlights that appeared when held up to light. The one finger of khaki colored head retained itself fairly well leaving streaks of lacing. The aroma was of caramel malt, toasted malt, some bread and biscuit notes and a little chocolate malt as well. The flavors were very similar with more of an emphasis on the roasted malt and the addition of enough hops to make the finish quite dry but clean. A little sweet malt lingered on my palate after the last gulp, but in a pleasant way. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation good as well. Very drinkable, American brown."
"Pours nice dark amber- with thin white lace on the sides of the glass. Sometimes brown ales are a bit too sweet and cloying. This one seems to have found the right balance for me. Has a nice brown sugar, molasses on the nose and palate. Very fresh. The balance here is the hops- definetely more than in a traditional brown ale. This beer has a fullness without being too heavy or overbearing. Overall, a very nice brew perfect for fall."
"D - Goes down easy leaving you wanting more."
"The nose is a sweet, malty blend of toasted nuts and vanilla. The flavor is sweet, a solid blend of slightly toasted malt, brown sugar and a finish of subtle hops. The feel is about medium thickness, but that hops at the end really helps crispen each sip, preparing for the next in a very nice way that makes this a fairly drinkable beer."
"D) A decent fall seasonal brew."
"Atmosphere is really solid here. Really nice appearance manifests in a deep, dark body and full thick head complete with some very substantial lacing. Nose is a great balance of malt, hops, and a nice nutty or woody tone. Flavor follows suit. Rich and malt, but with a nice hop note, all wrapped up in a nutty woody bittersweet package. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"D: The beer is extremely easy to drink and is a perfect fall offering that's quite sessionable."
"DRAIN POUR."
"I've had quite a few tumblers throughout this season, and I must say that it is yet another superbly crafted beer from Sierra Nevada that is very easy to drink."
"Not very stong, medium bodied with a rich and creamy consistency. This beer was nice to try, but not a personal favorite brown ale."
"D: Not sure that I would choose to drink a lot of these but i's a good beer."
"D - Not very drinkable to me, it has great flavor but the bitterness takes away from the finish half way through."
"Overall, not a terrible American Brown ale but not one to write home about. Could've gone with more hop aroma and flavor and less roastiness."
"D: A beer perfectly suited for that chilly October night. Warm and malt forward with an earthy bitterness in every bottle that is case worthy to share outdoors along the fire pit with friends."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle (Julian dated September 8, 2010) into my Zatec fluted glass. Glorious 3 fingers of tan head. Deep dark brown body. Smells of toasted nuts, floral and piney hops. Maybe a little bit of dark chocolate. Maybe not. Nutty flavor, dry, bitter hops on the finish. A touch of cocoa comes through as the last flavor. Very light bodied. Mouth drying. Exceptionally drinkable. Great sessionable brown."
"Because of all the contrasting flavors I couldn't see myself drinking more than one or two, but it was very interesting and fun to enjoy once."
"D- Good but left me wanting unsatisfied"
"D: Very drinkable. It's pretty well-balanced, and the alcohol is moderate."
"This beer pours out of the bottle a dark amber, with ruby highlights, topped off with a thick, frothy faintly tan-colored head. The head foams up into a large cloud, but soon dissipates leaving lacing down the sides of the glass as it goes. The nose is fairly faint with a subtle malt flavor coming through, and just a little hop crispness, which only seems to emphasize the malts. The taste mirrors the smell very closely. The main flavor is a smooth well balanced malt character, with just the right hop crispness to emphasize those malts without being too noticeable on its own. This beer has quite a good mouth feel, not too heavy, not too light, and it goes down quite smoothly. This is a very drinkable beer, one I could sit down and drink a few of any time from fall through early spring. Sierra Nevada did a great job with this one, its taste is really reminiscent of a crisp fall day."
"Tumbler Autumn Brown Ale doesn't seriously challenge the best American browns, but it's another solid effort from one of this country's finest (and most consistently good) craft breweries. What better way to watch the autumn leaves tumble down outside my front window than with a bottle of well-brewed brown ale?"
"I really hope SN keeps brewing this one every year, as it is simply amazing. I realize a few hop fanatics out there may miss their fall IPA, but to me, this is much more interesting and a truly memorable classic rather than just a beer to tie me over until Celebration arrives."
"Notes. This was my first beer from sierra nevada. I look forward to trying more after tasting such a great beer."
"A terrific beer even if you are not a huge fan of the style."
"Good beer. Nothing spectacular but a good choice if nothing else is around."
"Dr. This beer is so mild and mellow that you could drink a bunch. Nothing impressive about it, just easy to drink."
"Moderately carbonated and medium in body. This brew is crisp enough to be refreshing, but complex enough to keep this from being boring."
"Drinkability: Most definitely drinkable. Aside from the fact that I wished it was a bit ""stronger"" and pronounced in flavor, it was definitely pleasant to drink. I plan to buy this again."
"D- Really a nice, moderate beer from SN. Nice and well rounded and thoroughly enjoyable. Would make a great grill out beer."
"Nice change of pace brew from SN. Pours a dark copper-brown. Head is about an inch of creamy foam that settles to a nice cap. Smell wasn't all that great---not too distinguished. Taste is quite nice. Malt dominates, with a touch of sweetness, touch of hop bitterness. I do wish it had a tad more body, it is a bit thin. Overall, a pleasant take on a classic English style ale. Glad to have tried it."
"Pours a darker copper color with a thin cap of head that hangs around for a while. A lot of nutty, toasted malt in the aroma, but also some sweeter, molasses notes mixing in. The taste follows suit of the aroma - lots of toasted malt nuttiness with some piney hop bitterness on the back end. More nuttiness on the lingering, slightly astringent finish. Body is medium and creamy and drinkability is good. This is a tasty brown ale!"
"D-Pretty decent offering for the style although not a personal favorite. I definitely prefer a brown ale with less roasted and hop characteristics."
"D - Easy to drink Quality ingredients. Good for the style although I like more aggressive flavors in my brews."
"Im not real big on nut browns, but thisone worked. Good job on Tembler."
"First offering from Sierra Nevada that I've tried and would like to try more."
"Poured into my standard pilsner. Not the correct glassware but oh well. Lovely ruby-brown color with a one inch head and long lasting fluff. Lacing as well. Nice. Smell was sweet malt as was the flavor. Strangely I got almost nothing on the flavor with a nice sweet aftertaste. Malt 70/Hops 30. Mouthfeel was medium and drinkability was great. This would make a great session beer or an introduction to craft for someone you wouldn't want to blow away with a west coast IPA."
"First taste is rich, creamy, chocolatey malts with enough hops to keep the tongue interested. Then pain ensues for me."
"Recommended."
"D-Overall that beer is very drinkable. The balance is even enough to make the a session beer with enough flavor to enjoy."
"D- Its a little bit blah. Easy to drink. A little watery."
"Notes: This is a great example of the style. Hoppier than its English counterparts, but great nonetheless. A simple beer that offers a most excellent drinking experience. Great for fledgling beer drinkers and more experienced BAs alike."
"D: Very well balanced and drinkable brown ale that is very pleasing to the palate."
"D - Easy drinking - abv is in line. The carbonation is probably the only downside - not always a great texture and can be filling. Flavors are certainly appropriate for colder weathers."
"Overall - Good beer. A highly drinkable version of the style. Good, unique hop/malt balance in the flavor profile."
"This keg won't last me long. :)"
"A nice, easy drinkable brown. A pretty clean taste with no objectionable aftertaste. There's a touch of maple or some other sweetness. Maybe my mind is stuck on the label but it reminds me of October, pumpkins, falling leaves and Halloween."
"drinkability is lower because I just can't get over that odd aroma."
"Poured a clear dark brown with a finger and a half creamy tan head. A desent amount of lacing. Aromas of carmel malts and coffee. On the palate toasted barley, chocolate, and dry white bread with a hint of metal finish. Good carbonation with a medium body. All in all I'd give it ""Two thumbs up""."
"The smell has is almost spot on with taste. But the toasty, roasty, and nutty malts are overshadowed a bit by the bitter middle all the way to aftertaste. Still good and very sessionable. I already bought another twelver of this beer. And I will do it again as long as its available."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Poured into a pint glass. The beer is transparent nut brown with a mammoth tan head that leaves tons of soapy lace. The aroma is nutty and grainy with toasted malts, hints of caramel and just a bit of citrus in the finish. The flavor is full of toasted malts and grains. The pallet is coated with a nutty flavor. The taste is also very earthy, I would imagine dried leaves to be an ingredient in this. The mouthfeel seems kind of thick and the carbonation is a bit lower than I would prefer on this one. Overall, this one is acceptable and easy enough to drink."
"Poured up nice and dark in the tumbler but with less than a half-inch of head. The head looked lazy, as if forced there for effect. A young caramelycharcoaly smell made a good second impression. Rich chocolaty taste burst through immediately but fizzled out thinly very quickly. Half way through the glass it thinned out some more, leaving me enjoying a beverage that just as easily could have been something other than beer. Very light carbonation. Overall decent experience, and I had another, but I saw no reason to continue. Would drink it again, but no reason to seek it out."
"Poured a nice clear ruby color with a smallish off white head.This had a musty, earthy moldy kinda scent to it.Taste is dominated by these flavors and lots of roasted malt. Overall while pleasant i found this to be kind of bland. I didn't taste that much in the hops department, i know the IBUs were supposedly at 35. Feel is kinda light and drying."
"Decent, easy-drinking, but not too memorable (especially when compared to Sierra Nevada's many other excellent offerings)."
"Pours a translucent nut brown, hints to some orange-red around the edges when held to the light. Finger or so of white head, fades to a thin layer and bubbles. Leaves some moderate lace. Nose is fairly tame, light notes of nuttiness and molasses, maybe a hint of chocolate. Taste is in the same boat, light notes of chocolate, nuttiness and a prominent malt. Medium carbonation and a relatively light body, quite good drinkability and surely sessionable. Not sure if I'd go out and pick up a whole bunch of this though, a bit tame, unexciting and restrained altogether."
"This beer drinks very easily. I could work my way through most of a six pack easily. It is unlike other beers from Sierra Nevada, but still worth your attnetion."
"D: This was not bitter or sweet - surprisingly dull for Sierra Nevada. The body wasn't great either, but at least it was easy to drink. One of the least interesting or enjoyable beers I've had from this brewery."
"Seemed more like a marzen, and I guess they didn't want to call it their octoberfest since everyone has one these days."
"I'm not the biggest fan of brown ales, but this one does so much right. I could not find anything to complain about. Really well crafted, and I would for sure look for this guy again."
"It's a really good beer, very tasty and really well balanced. It's different enough to give some oomph to a beer line up though. Lovely."
"Flavor is a bit sweet up front with a return of a nutty cocoa flavor. Pleasant feel and finish without the paparazzi, the girl next door."
"This an interesting, very drinkable American brown ale. Earlier today I enjoyed an English brewed brown ale. Both were excellent examples - the English being rather earthy, exotic with lots of subtle flavors; the American being clean,vibrant and straight forward."
"Very drinkable and tasty brown, a great sessionable beer."
"Drinkability is large - with more flavor than the avg ABA, but low alcohol level, this is a winner. And an AWESOME value, too."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a nice dark brown cola color with a 1 finger light brown head with moderate carbonation. The aroma was of burnt caramel, sweet malts, and a mild hop balance. The taste starts off with a sweet brown sugar taste but settles with a finish of slight bitter hops. I have had a few and the more I try this brew the more the subtle flavors become complex. This is really well made and balanced brew. Good carbonation, good flavor and good balance makes this worth a try for sure."
"Clear deep brown color with a solid, medium-sized tan head. Sparse, webby lace. Toasted nutty malt aroma...light coffee bean, toffee, and earthy hops. Roasted malt flavor, nutty like the aroma. Slightly sweet, with a decent hop presence and some mild bitter chocolate. Medium bodied with a moderate bitterness and dry-ish finish. Solid and appropriate for the season..."
"Drinkability: Even for a brewery I like as much as S.N., this is one of their best offerings. Nothing too complex but very very tasty. Very clean, I could easily do a six."
"Drinkability - a great session beer for fall/winter. This sixer was gone in a flash."
"Drinkability - This is a very easy drinking brown ale that is simple, but not boring in that respect. Very well crafted and balanced. A beer I would always welcome."
"Drinkability is good, favorable tasty treat with nothing to complain about. Not a big brown ale fan but this one is quite enjoyable."
"Pours a dark brown/amber with a foamy white head. Pretty good lacing and head retention. Aroma of roasted nuts, coco and some citrus hops, not too strong overall. Flavor basically follows the nose. Toasted nuttiness (almonds?) starts the flavor off. Hint of roasted chocolate follows as a bit of sweetness shine through in the malt. Pretty hoppy for the style as the beer finishes with a good rush of citrus and floral hops. Different, but nice flavor. Medium bodied, above average carbonation."
"D: Good ABV and very good flavors.. Very drinkable brew.... Good fall beer with it is getting a little cooler outside. I think it is the toasted & roasted part. Worth looking for."
"This is a good fall beer and another good one from Sierra Nevada."
"D - This is a very enjoyable beer thats going great with the cooler nights that are happening it has a good taste thats easy to drink its worth picking up a six pack to give it a try"
"Drinkability - Glad I picked up this single. I'm not the biggest brown ale fan, but this is most certainly a great Autumn beer. Easily quaffable and enjoyable on this cool Autumn night."
"Taste is strong toasted barley (faintly caramelly) and clean, clear bread crust. A leafy-peppery-faintly woody hop bitterness just dominates the light sweetness, especially in the finish and lingering in the aftertaste. If warmer, it has a more winey-juicy and zesty-lively character and the bitterness is less sharp. If drunk too cold, the bitterness is a little too sharp. It is not very complex, but it is solid and well-rounded, the flavours clean, firm, clear, and it is pretty well balanced. Feel is solid and firm. As noted, it is more lively if warmer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Just a hair under medium bodied, with pretty nice carbonation. A bit light for my taste. This is a very drinkable beer, one that I would buy again in the future."
"D: I would order a second and probably buy next year again. A pretty good brown, but not stellar"
"A great Fall beer. Very drinkable."
"This is a nice brown ale, pretty simple but with plenty of flavor. A nice, drinkable fall beer."
"D - Not bad, not preferred by any means either."
"D: Great flavor. Not syrupy or overly caramely or sweet. I prefer hops, but if I'm going to go malt then this is very drinkable brew."
"Overall, one of the better browns I've had in a while. It's a bit subdued and watery though."
"The carbonation is pretty low in this beer, which lends to a very nice mouthfeel, velvety smooth. Tumbler definitely highlights the increasingly rare malt flavors that can be found in beers, but SN doesn't forget their hop-centric roots, and have created arguably one of the more balanced browns I've tasted. SN can cross brown ale off their list of ""perfected beer styles."""
"Drinkability: I could find myself drinking this all day without getting bored or overpowered."
"Sierra Nevada Tumbler pours with about 2 fingers of fluffy just off white dense head which leaves nice lacing on the glass. The beer has a distinctly nutty smell with a roasted malt smell and a bit of sweet or caramel smell under that. It has a lot of nutty flavor as well along with a little bit of coffee, and a little bit, but not much, bitterness. It has lively carbonation with a good bite, but maybe a bit light on the mouthfeel for me. Very drinkable. Good cheap early fall beer."
"Not a bad brown ale from Sierra Nevada. This fits nicely in with the porter and pale ale (though I really wish they would get rid of or revamp the Stout). This definitely hits the spot when I have a hankering for a nicely malt focused Brown ale, though there is a touch of hop character here as well."
"This is another solid offering from Sierra Nevada. Can they do anything wrong?"
"12 oz's in a chimay glass. Pours a deep amber brown. nose was pretty exciting. Of course the honey and the toasty malts, but I encountered some smokiness, as well as some spice, clove to be exact. I picked this up for my brother-in-laws Bday. We paired it with some oxtail and potatoes. Excellent pairing! I was surprised at the drinkability. Had like 3 or 4 no problem. Definitley pick this up for dinner."
"This is a medium to light bodied offering with a moderate level of carbonation. Quite easy drinking but a bit unbalanced with the favoring of the hops running wild. Regardless, no problems finishing the glass."
"Pours a nice & clear tea-brown. Looks a lot better than most brown ales, IMO. A thin & wispy, tan head leaves lace around the glass. Smell is a little muted; roasted malts and a bit of mineral funk. Taste is better, though. A mellow toasty malt turns nutty and blends oh-so-well with a tart, hoppy background. Very nice. Fell is nicely carbonated and very smooth, but dry at the same time. Drinkability is good - a fine brown ale by SN."
"DB- Another solid, inexpensive beer by Sierra Nevada. Lots of great malt flavors exist here in one of the better Brown Ales I can think of. Definitely worth getting a sixer of."
"Great interpretation of the Brown ale style, Sierra nevada is always a winner."
"Overall this is a fantastic autumn brown ale. Highly drinkable in that i could have an entire 6 pack at any given time. A wonderful introduction to Sierra Nevada."
"Notes: for a $2.50 bomber, this is well worth it. Definitely a good beer"
"Beer pours a ruby red/brown color with a nice head, a bit soapy, that sticks around for awhile. Scents of toasted hazelnuts, walnuts, etc shine through. Medium body with a roasty toasty, good flavor. Nutty palate, some coffee, and sweetness but not overly, and a good shot of hops balance the maltiness out. Pretty easy drinker here, but what else is new. Sierra Nevada is always a great starter beer for the novice in all styles."
"D: Tumbler drinks really easy, the moderate alcohol makes this easily sessionable and quite enjoyable."
"overall, quite pleasing, a nice brown ale. i very much like the floral/chocolate combo."
"This isn't my favorite brown ale by far, but I would drink it again."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavor is bold but not too bold. I could easily put away 6 of these in a session!"
"Picked up a single to try this one from Sierra Nevada. I don't usually go for brown ales, this one was a pleasant surprise in that it looked like a typical brown but had more of a smoked porter flavor--more muted than a straight smoked porter, but more than the usual brown toast flavors. Interesting to try."
"d- nice, this is yet again a tasty offering from sierra nevada. this is worth trying, i would drink this again."
"D super drinkable."
"Very high drinkability. This is the epitome of an autumn beverage."
"Not bad at all. This would make a great session beer. The flavor isn't powerful, but is plentiful, good, and smooth."
"Delicious beer. Very well balanced and easy to drink. This could be my fall go to beer. I'm not saying it's the perfect brown, but it's just the way I like my brown. Sweet caramel malts with a hint of toffee and some nutty flavors. Hop bitterness is more to balance the beer than to add to the complexity. Medium bodied."
"Unlike other browns ales, Sierra Nevada Tumbler has that crisp hoppy flavor SN is famous for upfront. The hops are assertive, but don't interfere with enjoyment of the malts. As you swallow, your tongue gets the chance to start tasting the lightly roasted malt and caramel sweetness. It tastes faintly chocolately with just a bit of nuttiness that combines well with the grapefruit hop flavor. This can be a complex beer if you want to drink it slowly and pick it apart, but it's also well balanced and easy to enjoy without thinking too hard."
"Not impressed, completely lack-luster. The hop is really bleh."
"Drinkability: Overall this beer is very drinkable since it lacks any overpowering flavors. The brew seems to be intended for crisp fall evenings. Excellent for this time of year."
"I saw this strolling through the supermarket isle, and how I like the good things, I jump in it. 2010 edition, premiere year? Last six-er they had left on the shelf, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top yields a roasted malt with a hint of chocolate. Pours into a trusty ale receptacle to a dark root beer colour, with a foamy multi-sized bubble head. Taste first preceded by a notable mouthfeel, carbonated and with substantial density. The taste then kicks in with a very roasted and smoky maltiness, the smoke is as fresh as if you are standing next to a bonfire. After the malt belt there is a noble bitterness that is more chaulky and dry than bitter. The bitterness then increases and lingers in the aftertaste. A good brew with flavor belt with a relatively clean finish on the end. This as all of SNB brews is unique in itself and highly drinkable. I see new beer from SNB, I jump in it, without hesitation."
"I'm generally not a fan of the American Brown Ale, however this is pretty tasty, it's extremely well balanced, I find many to be far too sweet, this has a very good balance of sweetness while still having a light hop bitterness to it. A bit of toffee and grains, it's good. Mouthfeel is phenomenal, rich and creamy it's quite thick and chewy without going over the top. Nice autumn beer."
"The body was very nice, smooth, full, well-rounded and easy. Drinkability was also good the beer went down easily. Overall, a decent beer, if nothing special. The biggest surprise was that SN restrained themselves from making yet another hop bomb, like most of their brews. Worth a shot if you see it."
"Not heavy at all, don't let the color fool you, this one will pair fine with eating 6 lbs of food at Thanksgiving."
"Had this on tap at Il Vicino in Santa Fe as their house beers were unavailable due to reconstruction of their brewery. Turns out this beer is spot on for a Fall seasonal and very food friendly. Lovely dark brown colour with highlights and a caramel nose with hops in the mix. This is a big brown ale with a rounded mouthfeel and a long finish. SN should just keep this in their lineup as a brown ale year round."
"I've found myself drinking a lot of this one since it's release in August. Tumbler pours into a glass a brownish auburn color with an off white layer of head which has pretty good retention and light lacing. It has a very nice aroma with all of the roasted malts making themselves known along with some cocoa and nutty scents evident as well. The taste is much of the same. The roasted malt qualities come through upfront with slightly bitter-chocolate notes which are followed by a smooth and caramel finish. This is a really well balanced brew with a hint of sweetness at the end and I find it to be delightfully drinkable. It leaves a lingering creaminess on the tongue that begs for another glassful, maybe I should buy a case of this one. Not surprised that Sierra Nevada has another winner on their hands here, perfect for the kind of weather the label suggests."
"All in all, I would and will continue to purchase Tumbler Autumn Brown Ale as long as it is in stores."
"Was enthusiastic about this newer beer as I am both a fan of the brewery and the style. It really wasn't my favorite interpretation of the style but was still enjoyable and a good beer for a crisp fall night with some playoff baseball and chili."
"Since Kellerweis came out, I've been looking forward to anything new from Sierra Nevada. This doesn't disappoint. I'm reminded of Surly Bender and Ithaca Nut Brown for the tasty drinkability. The aroma is a bit like a light coffee roast with toffee and cherries. There's a mix of roasted grains, cocoa, smoke, nutty malts, and a touch of caramel candy in the flavor. The finish has mild citrus rind taste with a clean bitterness that matches nicely with roasted grains. The mouthfeel is on the lighter end for the style and I like that, it's sessionable when so many brown ales are heavy and filling."
"Toasty malt aroma with chocolate. Full toasted to roasted malt flavor with hop bitterness in finish to balance. Medium to full bodied but a creamy texture makes this drinkable. I prefer this style over Octoberfest."
"The flavor was much hoppier than expected as well. But, given the fact that this is from SN, that's not all that surprising. Light caramel notes. Finish was faintly bitter and earthy. The mouth was moderately full. Good carbonation. Easily drinkable pint. I could have a couple of these."
"Final Thoughts: Two Thumbs Up!!! Would certainly buy another 6 pack of this is I can find it. Very nice fall/winter beer!! Cheers to Sierra Nevada, definitely one of the best in their line-up!!"
"The beer pours a reddish-brown color with a white head. The aroma is grain with some toffee notes, but it is fairly faint and certainly less than I would like. The flavor is more of the same with notes of toffee, caramel, chocolate and some earthy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"A great switch up for SN, they just broadened their range ... A solid brown for sure."
"It's odd that the milky qualities would be those that carried across the whole beer. The mouthfeel of this brew has the weight of milk, tempered by a mild astringency that peaks in the middle of a draught and fades out at the end to let sweetness and nuts handle the finish. Feels good to drink and I had no trouble putting this one away. I've always been partial to brown ales and I may make a habit of this one."
"Overall, this beer didn't disappoint. I thought it would be much hoppier, but Sierra Nevada did their best to stay true to the style and created what I consider a gem. I definitely recommend this beer and hope to enjoy it again in the near future."
"Dark mahogany appearance, tan head and plenty of lacing. Roasted malt aroma, earthy with a touch of hop character. Tastes of more roasted malt, slight caramel, and a lingering smoke flavor. A great brown ale, superb maltiness; a great one for just about any meal."
"Tumbler (i like the name) is a light brown color resembling a brown ale, that was simple enough. On top a tan head arose than diminished into some sparse bubbles. A bit of stickage to the sides. Smell is toasted malts, nuts, toasted qualities and not alot of hopping, just some earthiness in the back. Taste is a light brown, pretty simple, toast and the like with nuts and some small sugar sweetness, not all that large. Caramel. Feel is thin and approaching watery but not quite there. Carb is on the low side, not very lively on the mouth. Im not a brown ale type of guy but this remains drinkable, I could have two or so. A simple style from a brewery who knows how to nail down a style. A good one to give to somebody new to craft beer."
"Notes: Disappointing showing for Sam Adams. The balance on this beer was all out of wack."
"I was surprised I hadn't seen this beer before. I had a sixteen ounce draft of this at Rattle n Hum, who were featuring this brewer during New York Craft Beer Week. I'm not a big fan of brown ales and I wasn't crazy about this either. A little more carbonated than I expected and a little light on flavor and aroma. If you like brown ales I think you'll like this one but I'm the wrong person to ask."
"D: Really tasty and wildly sessionable. A fine follow-up to new seasonals from Sierra Nevada (Kellerweis? Torpedo? now this?) plus a bounty of excellent 30th Anniversary beers...I'm noticing what's going on down in Chico and I like it a lot. Already have polished off a couple six-packs in the last month and guarantee more will meet the same fate. Recommended."
"A pretty typical brown ale, quite enjoyable within its context. I would have again."
"While this wasn't heaveable, it was hardly good. Took a little work getting it all down (and I only started off with a half-pint). I'd consider trying this again, but only on tap at happy hour."
"I didn't know about this one till I saw it on sale at the local Rite-Aid for $13.99 a twelve pack. I love their pale ale, it was my first craft brew that I ever had, so I thought I'd give this one a whirl. Brownish amber with a soapy whitish head. Leaves some decent lacing. Smells of burnt caramel and toast. Lots of roasted malts, caramel and a good deal of hops on the taste. It has that Sierra Nevada taste. Good medium mouthfeel and a good sessionable bear. I'll definately look for this one next fall."
"D: Fits nicely in the Sierra Nevada family of brews. Has qualities that are similar to their Torpedo & Pale Ale. A great seasonal release and great addition to the brown ales available in CA."
"Nice mid bodied mouth-feel. Goes down nicely, but at 5.5% that's about what i would expect. So glad to see a nice, low abv, beer that's tasty without being hoppy enough to melt you teeth(not that there anything wrong with hop bombs.) This is the best brown ale i have had, and one of the best beers period. Kudos to you Sierra Nevada."
"The beer is rich, medium brown in the glass, with a head that dissipates fairly quickly. The smell is toasted bread and the taste is also predominantly toasted grain. The mouthfeel is medium-light and the finish is a nice balance of crisp and dry. For me this is another instance of Sierra Nevada taking a style of beer and doing it noticeably better than the ""standard."" Among not-yet-super-serious beer aficionados, Newcastle is the standard brown ale. Tumbler is clearly better than Newcastle."
"Grabbed a sixer of these cause Sierra Nevada rarely goes wrong. This was a solid brown. Lots of standard caramel maltiness with a fruity hop presence as well. Nuts and slight earthiness. A touch of roastiness, but not a stout-knock-off. Body is medium, light, with fairly high carbonation. Highly drinkable, could be a session brew. One I'd grab again, a good example of the style."
"5.50%? Only on the bottle. It's there but you'll hardly feel it as one of these gets popped open and enjoyed during the changing of the leaves. I can't say not to try this but if there are a lot of Fall and Octoberfest beers available where this is found, then you might want to see what else is out there. This can only be recommended for the die-hard SN fan."
"A good-looking medium brown brew with a frothy light tan head and good carbonation. Aroma is light an nutty. Flavor is deep and malty, probably more so than I expected. Well done. A very fine quality brown ale. I have had better, and I have had worse, but this is fairly drinkable with a light fizzy finish."
"Cool label, great Autumn vibe."
"Drink well my friends"
"Mouthfeel was great for a brown ale. Very solid but not heavy. Excellent, highly drinkable Fall beer."
"D- Not a bad session ale. Had I gone into this looking for a hop bomb of a brown I'd love it, but I was hoping for a more malty beverage. I'll have to revisit this when I'm in the mood for an IPA."
"An excellent brown ale and an awesome fall seasonal. Sierra Nevada never fails to impress."
"This is a good looking beer; but don't judge a beer by its cover. I might be somewhat uneducated regarding brown ales, but this ale has the taste of burnt bacon with a pungent aroma. I have always been very impressed with SN but this comes up short. Still a brewery that others should aspire to reach but I will stick with pale ale and torpedo until the celebration ale comes out."
"EDIT- 2/6 bottles in the sixer had this happen. the rest were the same as above without the poop smell."
"Solid brown ale from SN. Just ""nutty"" enough to give you a real sense that fall is in the air but not overwhelming. This is a very drinkable brown ale wheteher during the afternoon BBQ or a quiet, cool fall evening of relaxing. Great offering but would any less be expected from SN?"
"This is a nice beer with a surprisingly more stout-like character than a typical brown."
"Drinkability - This brew definitely gets me ready for Autumn. I really like this beer. Very solid. I'm not one to sit and drink beer after beer during the evening, but I could have a few of these and be quite satisfied."
"From Sierra Nevada, a bit more flavor was anticipated, but this was a good one nonetheless."
"Drinkability: sessionable at 5.5, not boosy, would order again under limited options. Not a bad beer, however easily forgotten."
"I'm not sure if I would buy this one, but if offered I'll definitely drink it."
"Notes: In my opinion this is a well made American Brown Ale and a good autumn release. I can see this beer pairing well with some of the hardier fall seasonal foods."
"D- I'd rather a brown with more malt and less hop but this one is not offensive"
"I could session this one easily if given the opportunity... Very solid and tasty.. A good effort here..."
"Drinkability - I could definitely have a few of these on a cool autumn day, watching the leaves. Very nice fall brew."
"D - I need to give this another try."
"D= Great brew. One of my new favorite browns. Fits perfect with the season."
"D: A great drinking brown ale that is perfect for the fall. Well done Sierra Nevada!"
"The aroma is nice and smooth, with light roasted malt and brown sugar. Flavor is smooth as well with a nice round nutty and malty flavor. Carbonation is low and mouthfeel is on the dry side. Overall I enjoyed this beer very much."
"Sierra Nevada batting average: .999"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer but there are other brown ales that I would choose first."
"Overall a superb brew!"
"An all around nice brown ale."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation...the result is a very drinkable American Brown Ale. Good job!"
"Good drinkability, nice session beer."
"D - After reading all the reviews of this thing I was not too anxious to try it. However, I must say that this is one of the easiest drinking and tasty brown ales I've ever had."
"D- Overall, Sierra Nevada Tumbler is just about everything I am looking for in a fall seasonal. Not too light, not too heavy and a good dose of malt. Recommended!"
"Nutty malts with equal citus flavor gives it a unique taste for this style but I enjoyed it and could down several in a sitting!"
"A dense, massive tan head tops the brown brew. Streaks of crimson pierce where the light hits. Retention is excellent and thick sheets of slightly broken lace are left when all is done. Smells nutty with a big malty sweetness in the background. Has a good mix of hops and malts on the palate, but the hops outweigh in the end. Very faint notes of pine, spice and dried dark fruits exist. Pretty dry for a brown. Has a medium mouth-feel. This definitely an SN brown. The distinctive hop presence proves it."
"Notes - I tend to prefer more malt-forward brown ales, but I have to admit that although it's hoppy, this beer is well balanced. I would recommend it to fans of Brooklyn Brown, Avery New World Porter, or even Cascadian Dark Ales. I probably won't buy another 6-pack, but I might get a pint sometime depending on the available selection."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A bit more tame and watered down than I expected from such a bold brewery. I probably won't seek it out again. That being said, if you're into brown ales, it's worth a shot."
"Tumbler is an interesting release from Sierra Nevada. It's probably one of their more straight forward releases (much like Glissade). While it isn't a bad Brown Ale, it's hardly a stand out. I like the flavor, but nothing about it really stands out. Having said that, there's nothing overtly bad about it either. Ultimately, it needs a little something to spice it up. Perhaps more hops would do the trick. At the end of the day, it's another nice release from Sierra Nevada. Definitely worth a try."
"Something of a Northern English Brown, though I'm left wanting more flavor. More of an Indian Summer ale than a more substantive offering for the arrival of Fall. Rather a poor value too (I paid $10 for the sixer)."
"Taste is nice caramel malts with just enough hops to balance the sweetness. Fairly medium body beer is decently creamy and easy to drink."
"D: Very drinkable, a solid choice for a session beer."
"If you're looking for a nice clean brown ale with not too much sweetness, not too much smoke, lots of balance, and lots of malt, Tumbler delivers. It wasn't really to my tastes, but it wasn't bad either."
"Impression: Sierra Nevada. Another fine beer from the original and still best innovator. Get this. Drink this."
"I'm not much a brown ale person. This is one of the nicer ones I've come across for my tastes. Recommended."
"Really impressed, overall. I won't have a Newky for a long time, thats for sure."
"D - Lot's of flavor, great balance, interesting profile for a brown ale and a reasonable ABV. I'd grab more, but it's all sold out in my neck of the woods until next year."
"The feel is pretty smooth with a medium body and is well balanced with the right amount of bitterness. A fantastic fall, beer this may be my favorite brown ale."
"D - Fairly disappointed with this offering, as I had high hopes for it. The nasty metallic taste was thoroughly off-putting and ruined the rest of the drink. I'll drink the rest of the 6-pack, but only after my palate's already destroyed."
"D- A great sunset/evening beer especially as the sun sets earlier each day. In my opinion a bit too thin and airy to be a bedtime hour beer on chilly nights, but all in all a solid product."
"A fairly drinkable brew. Lacks some character and complexity. I could have a couple, because it is fairly smooth, but nothing I'd load up on either. Still, this is probably pretty good with end of the year BBQ fare, blackened meat, comfort foods, etc. Probably great with a hot sandwich (pastrami, etc). And because of this, it get a bump to 3.5."
"I could do a couple of these. A really nice autumn beer for sure. Doesn't seem like a brown ale to me, not that it really matters. Worth a shot if you're looking for a fall brew."
"I feel this beer is right on style while not the top of the heap brown ale wise, its damn good and the price was right."
"Tumbler is a pretty decent beer, overall. Dogfish Head probably has the best fall seasonal in Punkin that I've had so far. Still, this is pretty good and it's pretty drinkable."
"D: A smooth, very tasty and easy beer to drink. This is slowly becoming my go to ""Fall beer"" Highly Recommended!"
"A tasty brew, but nothing too complex. It does stand out amongst the autumn seasonal releases as being something pleasantly different."
"drinkability - this is a really good Brown ale, got this sixer for $6.99 and I'm glad I picked this up and tried it."
"Not to fond of this beer actually overall but I give it credit for what its worth"
"drinkability: for a brown ale, its characteristics stand out more than expected, the slight bitter spiciness combined with a clean finish give it a slight edge."
"Bring on fall, sausages and football!"
"Solid brown ale that pours a coopery amber color. 1 finger of white head with a limited bit of lacing hanging around the glass. Nice caramel malt flavor with a finish that kind of sits on the back of your tongue. Has a bit of alcohol that I was not expecting from a brown at 5.5% but all in all a solid beer."
"It's not a mind-blowing beer but it's pleasant. There's something that just seems comforting about it. Maybe it's the pastoral picture and autumn colors on the six pack, I dunno, but it works for me."
"Toasted grains and a little tannic bitterness up front. Caramel and cookie dough malts mid-palate. Light sweetness and some woodiness. Flinty, smokiness near the finish joined by some woody, herbal hop bitterness. Lingering caramel. Moderate body with a lively feel (wouldn't mind it being a bit creamier)."
"Appearance is a dark hazy brown with a half inch head that dissipates slowly and steadily. It smells of dark roasted malts with a sweetness. You can immediately taste the roasted malt and hints of sweetness. I almost wanna say there is a slight cocoa hint in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nothing extraordinary, it is smooth and creamy with carbonation on the light side. Drinkability is quite high. Goes down easy and is perfectly balanced. I know it says so on the label, but I could definitely see myself having a few of these on a nice chilly fall day. Sierra Nevada has never let me down. Try one."
"Pours a deep amber brown with a very nice head and huge curtains of lacing. The aroma is earthy and physical with a high note of chocolately malt. The flavor is chocolately and slightly smokey, all malt here. There is dark caramel and cherry, like sitting around a warm fire with a pipe of rich tobacco. The mouthfeel is creamy and solid."
"Pours dark brown boardering on black. Mostly opaque with just the faintest hint of red when held to the light. Modest half inch of light brown head. Looks very much like a porter or stout. Very nice clean, dry toasted malt smell. The taste is also clean and malty. A touch of nutty sweetness with a little bit of a smokey note. Finishes with a very modest hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little watery. I'm convinced that it is imposible for Seirra Nevada to make a bad beer. This didn't blow my mind to say the least, but it is still a pretty tasty offering. Good flavor, drinks easy and captures the season well. Not a masterpiece, but good."
"Drinks really easy, I will have to look at my review & see how this compares to the old harvest brown (or whatever it was called), but at first blush, I'd say I like this better, seems to have deeper malt backbone. Just looked, I'm wrong, still a keeper IMO"
"Overall a solid rendition of the style. I'd want something with a little more brown sugar on the aftertaste, but Sierra Nevada has done well here."
"I am a big fan of Sierra Nevada and this one didnt disappoint. A good brown ale is perfect for autumn so i think they hit the nail on the head with this one. Not only is this beer perfect for the season its also a great brown ale in general. It isnt as heavy as a DFH Indian Brown Ale or Palo Santo Marron or a Samuel Smith Nut Brown Ale and also isnt as high in alcohol content which makes it very drinkable yet maintaining all of that great maltiness that we love about brown ales. This is a great beer to kick back on a patio or deck and watch the leaves come down."
"A moderate head dissipates almost completely, producing the aroma of roasted malts followed by hops. The beer nicely balances flavors of roasted malts, faint and slightly sweet chocolate, and a healthy dose of hops. The beer is light on the palate and is overall a highly drinkable session beer. Great for Fall tailgating or any cool-weather festivities."
"Overall this is a very good, balanced brown ale that is quite hoppier than most other browns that I have tried. Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar remains #1 for me but this is still very good and worth seeking out this fall."
"Pours a clear dark reddish brown with foamy two finger off-white head, fades to a quarter inch leaving a nice sheet of lace. Smell: toasty, nutty, brown sugar, yeasty bread, hops are green and earthy but quite faint. Taste: toasty, nutty, really mild roast towards the end of the sip, (a sizable) earthy hopping. Hops and yeast flavors come together in a somewhat tangy, mildly bitter finish. Feel is a bit thin. A fairly laid back brown ale, not my preference, but enjoyable nonetheless. Bottled 8/26/10."
"Not that familiar with the American Brown Ale, this beer reminds me a lot of the Sierra Nevada Porter which I'll have to try again soon to contrast. My suspicion is there is a similar roasted malt in both. Has a nice head which dissipates, not much lacing, good dark amber coloration. Nicely carbonated with a hoppy then smooth finish. I like this beer more with each sip; overall, another solid effort from SN. Thanks!"
"Drinkable, but a little more bitter, coffee and chocolate like for the style. I think it is a lot like a watery porter rather than a brown. I make it an ordinary fall seasonal."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful dry, roasted malt scent with a touch of caramel sweetness and a moderate hop nose. The taste is great. It has a bitter hop bite up front with plenty of roasted malt flavor to balance. It goes down smooth and dry with a bit of caramel sweetness in the finish. The hop character is exceptional. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good brown ale. It's damn near a perfect American brown."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. The beer is looks like the autumn brown ale it is, think fall maple leafs and you get the color. A nice head lacing sits a top the brown nectar. The nose is bouquet of malty spiciness (chocolate, hazelnut, ect, ect). The taste and mouthfeel are above average, I think the real thing that sets this beer apart is the wonderful balance. The drinkablility of this beer is exceptional+. I am usually not a fan of the brown ale, but this is an exception."
"Drinkability: A smooth, pleasant, easily drinkable brown ale. For the record, I've purchased two 6-packs to date, and anticipate a third one this week."
"D-not a session beer but I could see consuming quite a bit of this during the fall season (if we had a fall season in this god forsaken state of Arizona, but I imagine it looks like the cute little picture on the bottle)"
"Other comments: Pretty exemplary brown ale. Just not my favorite kind of beer."
"Great session brown ale. This beer does not have the most flavor but, is a nice malty brown ale without being overly sweet. The mouthfeel is a little thin and lacking enough carbonation. It has that SN house flavor that there beers have. There is no doubt it is a SN beer. I would prefer DFH Indian Brown Ale to this for a brown with more flavor, but this beer is pretty good."
"D- if I'm gonna go for a fall beer, I'm gonna want something with a little more flavor...this is a little light for my tastes"
"One finger off-white/almost light tan head, quick dissipation with a substantial layer of head retained on top of amber brown clear body, numerous trails of carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Pretty complex malty nose, roast, a bit fruity, and a wee bit of smoke. Taste mirrors the nose, with added attributes of grassy and floral hops, not much bitterness, pretty smooth. Mouthfeel is medium full, pretty good effervescence. While this isn't my favorite style, I do recognize its smoothness and high drinkability. A finely crafted beer for an cool autumn evening."
"drinkability: good"
"The thin mouthfeel is a bit of a let down when looking at the brews appearance. It is an easy drinking very sessionable brown that will not offend at all. Good brew though."
"Great Seasonable offering, will look forward to purchasing every fall. A can't miss Brown Ale!"
"As I get into my second trial this seems a good fit for autumn and it's just big enough to help with the nip in the air. I expected a bigger hop profile, especially considering its a SN beer, but this will do just fine."
"This brew pours brilliantly clear medium brown with ruby-copper highlights and a clingy off-white head. The aroma is medium-high malt -- nutty and sweet with hints of chocolate and just a bit of roast. The flavor is moderately malty and a bit sweet -- quite nutty and some biscuit flavor. The swallow brings a balancing hop bitterness accented by a slightly dry finish. The carbonation and body are both medium. Overall a flavorful malty beer with a pleasantly dry finish and very drinkable."
"Priced very reasonably at about $7 for 6."
"Pours a clear brown with everlasting off-white head. Malty aroma of hops, slight mint, cocoa, some ash and sweets. Cocoa sweetness leads to hop backbone, malty, toffee, slight spice, cinnamon, dry subtle choco notes come through at the finish. Medium bodied brew with medium carb that tickles the palate. Another classic offering from Nevad. A fall sessionable beer that I will be grabbing more than once."
"Drinkability is relatively high. The beer is sessionable, and the flavor profile is appealing enough to consume with ease yet not require much thinking from the drinker. Seems like a solid beer to me."
"D - Although the carbonation can get annoying with too many of these, it's still very refreshing and pleasing to drink and I could definitely have 1 or 2 more. Goes pretty well with food, and is great to just have around if you're looking to relax. Not too expensive either! I don't have much to compare it to, but if this is representative of brown ale as a style I will try many more in the future as I love the malt and the sweetness."
"Dark brown, smells like a porter and when it warms a bit it starts to have some coffee smells. The taste has the same as the smell except with a nice earthy bite from the hops at the end. Its a pretty standard brown ale not my favorite style, but I do like it for the style especially because of the nice hop bite in the back. Only downfall is that the body is just a little bit watery but not enough at all to take away from the quality of this fine Californian beer. Other than that I liked this one."
"D - It's easily drinkable with no offensive flavors but it just falls short in the flavor department. A bit watery overall which was really unexpected."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, nut, hint of earthy malt, hops, hint of roasted malt, slight oatmeal, and slight yeast. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of dry hops, nuts, sweet malt, and hint of yeast. Overall, great aroma and appearance, but lacking in body."
"D_It goes down easy but really does not offer much. Brown ales are one of my favourite styles when the weather gets cold but this really falls flat. A disappointment from a great brewery."
"D: High for such a dark style. This is clearly ""sessionable""."
"D: I like this beer quite a bit for what it is. Not quite sessionable for me but a nice fall drinker for sure."
" D- This beer has a nice hop bite to support a mellow roasted coffee malt flavor but it is a bit watery in the taste as the beer opens up a bit. The finish of full hops is nice."
"Drinkability- It's a decent tasting fall beer and I could stare longingly into it's label all day long. I could drink a sixer of this on a blustery fall day no problem."
"Overall this is a great American Brown Ale! Probably the second best I have had, next to Rogues Hazelnut Brown Nectar. But it is still an American Brown Ale...not a whole lot to get excited about here, but a nice easy drinking fall beer nonetheless."
"Notes: A nice brown ale from SN. At first I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew it would be decently hoppy, but I wasn't sure how it would compare to other hoppy brown ales. It ends up being along the lines of DFH India Brown. Hoppy, but with a lot of roastiness too."
"Appearance is a deep, clear mahogany with a foamy tan head. Head recedes slowly leaving some nice lacing. Aroma is malty, chocolaty and toasty. Taste is more of the same with a nice, and unexpected, hop bit that pops up in the middle. The roasty malty character up front was as good as expected and the hops really set this apart from your run of the mill brown ale. Mouthfeel and carbonation are about what you would expect for the style. Drikability is pretty high with this one too. Bought this on a whim at the last minute and am real glad I did."
"I give this a low score on drinkability, which probably drops the grade half a letter. I don't want to drink much of this."
"I don't know that I'll drink this again, which is upsetting because I wanted to love this beer."
"This is not a ""let's knock back a case of these"" amber. It's more of a ""sit and sip"" amber. A great tasting beer that's perfect for when you want something flavorful without all the ABV. I really can't imagine drinking more than two in a sitting. There's something about it that fills you up and doesn't leave you wanting a whole lot more."
"D: Good brew, I think that this could be a great session choice for an alternative to the autumn regulars."
"Very toasted texture throughout with the right carbonation, it's consistent and medium bodied."
"Easy to drink and pretty tasty. This beer pours a nice medium brown that looks fairly dark in a sufficiently thick glass. The head is beige and creamy and readily sticks to the side of the glass. The aroma is mild piney/floral hops mixed with nutty, caramel malt. Taste is a bit sweet with some gentle hop bitterness and more touches of chocolatey malt than I got from the aroma. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich for the abv. Tumbler hits the notes that I'm looking for in a brown stout. It's easy-drinking with a nutty malt flavor and not too much hops. That said, I'd prefer even less hop flavor/bitterness and more nuttiness relative to caramel, and I'm not really sure that I'd order a second glass. I like the sweetness, but it's probably a bit much for some. Good beer but perhaps a little forgettable."
"Tumbler, welcome to the SN seasonals. A servicable beer that fills the gap in SN's portfolio of beers finely."
"The beer is smooth: good medium/full body with a creamy feel from a carbonation level. The only real complaint is that yeast spice on the finish. It doesn't seem to fit in a brown ale to me. It is almost a bit too harsh."
"D: Not a bad beer, but certainly not one that I would remember."
"D-A good American brown ale, but not quite robust enough."
"Pours chestnut brown with a tall puffy head that sticks around as a thin cap but not much lacing. Classic brown ale aromas, with bready malt, a touch of toast, and some pine from the hops. There is a noticeable grainy sourness as well, sort of like a milk stout. The taste is similar, a bit softer than the nose would suggest, and the hops are a bit more restrained as well. The mouthfeel is soft and creamy, and overall I'd say this is pretty solid. Not rich and deep like some of the better browns, but everything is in the right place and it is very smooth and drinkable."
"D: Darn good brew. Tasty, smooth, and easy drinking."
"(D)- A solid to fantastic brown ale. Smooth, and with a great profile to boot. Another winner from Sierra Nevada and perfect for the fall season. Great drinkability; my fridge will be seeing alot of this in the coming years."
"D: This beer is mostly uninteresting, but it does not offend the palate. As it is now, this beer is easy to pair with food but a richer malt presence would enhance it further."
"Drinkability: A good brown ale, and a very good beer for the fall. This isn't a favorite of mine, but I'll definitely be looking forward to this one when it's out again next fall."
"Not my cup of tea. It's OK, but nothing I'm interested in drinking again. There are great brewing companies that cater to hop heads (Stone, Lagunitas), and then others that can do that but will still brew to style when appropriate (Great Lakes, Goose Island, Founders). This beer and it's brewing company sits uncomfortably in the middle, not really knowing what to do, IMO."
"Pours dark brown, nearly opaque, nice finger worth head, lacing is sufficient. Maybe it's my congestion but aroma seemed weak. Mouthfeel is decent, caramel and nutty malt notes, a bit of citrus hops in the finish, errhhm, Should get this for thanksgiving me thinks.. might go real nice with some turkey and potatoes, and a pecan pie! Definitely nutty.. I dig this one, maybe not a ""go-to"" brown ale but it's well rounded and enjoyable."
"D - High. This one could be a fall favorite around here..."
"Pours a deep amber to brown-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, small roast and earthiness. In the taste, earthiness and a nice fresh hop. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry roasty earth aftertaste. Somewhere between brown ale and oktoberfest with a nice hop."
"Pours medium brown with a touch of dark amber in there, good clarity, and off-white head that was generous on initial pour. Nose is faint, and I'm using a great nosing glass too. Palate offers a dessert like flavor overall with nuts and sweet brown baking spices, with a gentle caramel in there too. Light bodied. Easy drinking, sweet... but not too sweet."
"Th mouthfeel and body have an unexpected extra carbonation and effervescence. I would like a little more solid, rich malty body in an brown/autumn ale."
"This beer poured a dark amber color with a large head. The smell seemed alittle off, a slight metal smell. The taste was a bit heavy, full of flavor and had some sortta nut flavor. Full flavor but not too hard to drink. Overall a very enjoayble beer espically for the fall."
"definitley an american brown ale with the noticeable, yet restrained hop profile. everything is balanced and quite delicious. yummy!"
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation, finishes dry. Has a very earthy feel to it. A decent beer, although not spectacular."
"Brown ales are typically I boring style that's not one of my favorites. This is a good attempt from SN but ultimately falls short of making me want to drink another."
"I have a mixed relationship with brown ales. I like the style but so often I find that they're too sweet or, if not too sweet, just plain watery. This new thing from SN is redeeming, however. I can't comment much on the color because I drank it from a red plastic cup, but the head was a pleasant tan with many loose bubbles. The aroma was akin to a British ale, with oranges and something that came close to those giant SweeTarts you ate as a kid (not the tiny ones in the shiny bags, but the big fat ones you got at Halloween). The body isn't very thin, thankfully, and the taste is neither sweet or overly toasted, although there's a decent flavor of roastiness that fits with the theme of the beer. It's nice and dry at the end, too, without being ham-handedly bitter. It's not a big commitment and you can drink more than one without too much wobble. And it goes quite well with birthday cake and ice cream."
"Overall a superior brown ale. Perfect autumn brew."
"drinkability a wonderful beer for this time of year"
"Drinkability on these babies is high. The flavor is mild enough to enjoy over and over. It's not very filling for how heavy it is. I'm not a brown ale guy, but I'll return to this one each autumn."
"D - awesome for autumn!"
"Overall: Others have noted they wished more hops were present (because this is SN after all). Don't agree with that at all. This in my mind is closer to a English Brown Ale than American. Good indeed!"
"This is a tasty American brown ale. Complex and richly flavored yet nicely balanced and crisp."
"Drinkability: A quite tasty and refreshing brown ale. This is a style that I find difficult to get excited about but Sierra Nevada has managed to create and quite tasty and refreshing one here."
"Notes: This one is a good example for me of Sierra Nevada putting their magic spin on a typical English Brown Ale. Think of an Newcastle Brown Ale with more flavor."
"Nice smooth brown ale, not too hoppy and plenty of flavor. Much smoother on the mixed gas. This is the third sierra nevada to impress me, after not liking the Pale Ale. This is a great beer to add to Sierra's growning brand across the U.S. I cant wait to get my hands on more."
"d - A nice brown ale. Lots of toasted malts in the smell and taste, I feel like this would be a great one to drink in the fall, as intended. Would drink again."
"Good, solid stuff in every respect. I would definitely buy this again."
"Finally found some of this seasonal, really looked forward to Sierra's take on a rather bland ale style. Poured great, nice foamy tan colored head, it dies but leaves a creamy lace. Not much for aroma, kind of light roasted malt or bread odor. Texture reminds me of a lager. Taste is almost hazel nut like. Very mellow roast, nothing too strong here. A better brown for sure, recommended."
"D- This seems like a great beer for autumn. Not my favorite brown ale, but one I would certainly get again."
"Drinkability - Sierra Nevada is a very dependable and usually pretty easy to find brand. That counts for a lot. The Tumbler bottle, however, looks a little like a Thomas Kinkade painting. That counts for less."
"All in all, it certainly isn't bad. It probably won't knock anybody over, but brown ales rarely do."
"I have to say at first I wasn't sure what to make of Tumbler as I am used to more assertive SN brews. Also, due to the fact I haven't been drinking browns in quite some time, I may have forgotten how to appreciate them. Tumbler is a very drinkable and good beer and brings back the appreciation I once had for this often overlooked style!"
"A very satisfying autumn beer, definitely reminiscent of the fall season."
"D - This is a very nice brown ale. It actually tasted like autumn."
"Didn't know what to expect at purchase, but Sierra Nevada really perfected this seasonal. This is stays amazingly true to the brewery's style why also staying true to season. I look forward to enjoying many more of these while they're here, maybe even storing some."
"D: A near session-style English brown made distinctly American with the addition of dry and bittering west-coast hops. Just the right amount of malt sweetness and body to welcome cooler months with enough hop resin to make it a season-long addition suitable even for these waning days of summer."
"Overall, another solid offering from Sierra Nevada. Would buy again."
"I wasnt' sure what to expect, but the chocolate is quite different and pleasant."
"Perfect session for an autumn day.. this could hang out with long trails harvest all day !"
"Jay"
"All in all, a solid fall brew from SN. Very well balanced between malts and hops, make this a great sixer to sit by a fall bonfire. After the first one I reviewed, I lit up a nice maduro and felt the beer complimented the cigar quite nicely."
"24oz. bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Bottled on July 8th. Pours a deep brown. Not opaque. Exhibits good carbonation. Two inches of lumpy head forms and quickly dissipates. Fair amount of lacing. Nutty, roasted malt on the nose with a touch of coffee and dark chocolate notes. Medium bodied and just enough carbonation to make the mouthfeel nice and easy. Definitely sessionable. Sweeter on the palate. The roasted, nutty flavors come across after those of semisweet chocolate. This is the best brown ale I have had in a long time."
"Drinkability - If you're sitting around with your buds, drinking from sixes or twelves, it's definitely a good beer to consider. If you're looking to take your time to enjoy something after a long, hard day of work, pour something else into your glass."
"Pretty dark brown appearance. Some bubbles remain clung to the glass a 1/4 inch below surface of the ale. Smells malty and toasted with a pinch of hops. The taste is much less malty than the smell and slightly more hops. A good blend. Has a spicy feel to it that good be cleaned up a little. A good beer could drink a six pack. Cheers!"
"D- A good fall beer. Not a stand out by any means, but a welcome addition to the Sierra Nevada lineup."
"D- Perfectly appropriate for the slight chill of the autumn evening, I call this one a winner"
"12 ounce stubby bottle. Say what you want about Sierra Nevada, but it's nice to see the company not rest on their laurels in terms of the seasonals and other offerings. This is the first time I can recall them taking a swing at a brown ale. Pours a deep brown with dark ruby undertones that comes out a little bit lighter than the color of Coca Cola. Large bubbly head that goes at least a half inch if not a little bit higher. Moderate lacing. Aroma is all roasted malt, almost bordering on smokey. There's some dark chocolate fudge notes as well. Smells like a smoked chocolate chip cookie. Light and creamy mouthfeel, almost like a cream stout. Beer is fairly assertive, bitterness levels are relatively high for the style. Taste is almost all roasted and toasted malt. Kind of has a sourdough toast or toasted English muffin type of taste to it. There's no real hop character, save maybe some light orange hops in the finish which play well off the chocolate flavors throughout the body of the beer. Solidly constructed, almost like drinking a porter. I like this one quite a bit, and it will be a great autumn drink if and when it finally cools down outside."
"D-Very very drinkable. I'm so glad I bought a sixer of this."
"D - A great session beer and great for just sitting out on the porch enjoying one. Take your pick. You can't go wrong here."
"A decent brew for those who like brown ales. Personally, I don't care that much for brown ales so I probably didn't appreciate it as much as a brown ale connoisseur would."
"After several minutes, there is still a tiny head and great lacing. Like most selections from Sierra Nevada, this is easy to drink. It packs a lot of flavor, and while they're strong, they're not obnoxious or overbearing. Alcohol is moderate making this very drinkable."
"Pours a clear, dark maple-brown color with a medium amount of head. The smell on this beer is kinda nutty and malty. I'm picking up very faint hops, but nothing much. A little wood as well along with very little chocolate. There is nothing bland about the taste this beer has. I'm having a hard time pinpointing certain flavors I'm getting, but this just isn't watered down at all. I'm getting some chocolate notes, some nuttiness, a little roastiness, and a bit of sweet malts. My palate is not very advanced on brown ales, so I'm not really sure what these flavors are that I'm picking up. All I know is that it tastes pretty damn good. The mouthfeel is very pleasant and the drinkability is not bad."
"All in all, this is one of those rare brews that definitely seems to be as it claims. This claims to be an autumn brew and when I take a sip, it reminds me so, so much of the taste of autumn, if that had a taste. Good to try at least once if you like the autumn brews."
"This looks almost red when held up to the light but in the glass it appears a dark mahogany. Both aroma and taste are 100% roasty, but not in a coffee or smoky way, and there is a nice earthy sweetness. The hops have enough of a presence to distinguish this brown ale from the more malt-forward Octoberfests of the season. That added balance kicks up the drinkability for me. Sierra Nevada has nailed it again."
"The beer produces a creamy head and has a beautiful deep brown, almost cloudy color. There's a very nice coffee/mocha/chocolate aroma. The taste reminds me of the old Pilgrim Nutbrown, which was on of my favorites many years ago. There's great nuttiness with just enough bite of hops on the finish. You can even have a few of these without feeling heavy or full. A great beer for the fall season."
"First time seeing this brew. I thouroghly enjoy Sierra Nevada's brews. This one poured a cloudy iced tea color. The nose was dominated buy fresh brewed coffee and a little cocoa power. The taste was refreshing of roasted malts and mocha coffee like highlights with a fine balance of hops and some walnut. A perfect autumn brew to enjoy with a nice turkey dinner and a roaring fire (except not in Florida where we probably won't need a fire!)"
"pours a mostly clear dark amber color with a 1 finger beige head..smell is roasted malts and toffee with hops in the background..taste is roasted toffee/malts some spice hops are present.mouth feel is medium + this is a autumn brown ale with earth notes SN makes great brews this is no exception is the best brown? no it is not.but its drinkable.affordable and just plain good"
"This a a great beer for the fall season. SN has the best labels too. It would be great to be in a nice stone cabin on a stream in autumn drinking this beer."
"Overall a splendid West Coast rendition of a deeply traditional English Brown Ale. The hops give this an added dimension of brilliance without corrupting the tradition of the style. I adore the leather flavor. A bit of tabacco flavor creeps out as this ale is starting to warm towards room temp. I'm very pleased with the complexity of this ale. Great job Sierra Nevada ad thank you."
"Eric"
"A decent session beer, but nothing to write home about."
"I was worried I wouldn't be able to find a single bottle of this guy (call me a commit-a-phobe, but I don't wanna commit to a sixer (or more) if I'm undecided on the brew itself, as in this situation). Luckily, the fine folks at the CK had my back on this one. It pours a clear russet topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises brown sugar, nutmeg, light maple syrup, and a slight tinge of flowers. The taste holds notes of nutmeg, walnuts, flowers, and some light maple syrup. Simple, but effective. The body is a rather light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a nearly dry finish. Overall, a tasty, straightforward brown, a nice bit o' autumnal goodness."
"D- Well this is not my favorite SN beer. Kind of hurt.Not worth another taste."
"The beer pours a rich dark brown with cherry highlights when backlit. A light tan head forms, somewhere between two and three fingers in height, and holds it's ground for a minute before fading away. Lacing is decent, but nothing spectacular. Nose is more caramel/biscuit than more roasted aromas like chocolate or coffee, and there's a bit of hop aroma at the end (one of the nobles if I had to guess, not sure which though). Taste profile is an exact duplicate for Tumbler, heavy on the caramel and light on the roast (for a brown ale at least) with a little floral hop flourish and no real bitterness to speak of. At first I was bothered by a certain perceived thinness of body with Tumbler, but I'm mostly past it and realize that it's appropriate for a relatively restrained brew. Carbonation is nice and low, spot on for the type of brew SN was shooting for. As one might expect, for such a traditional and well executed brown ale Tumbler is very drinkable, in the time it took me to type this review up my glass is almost empty. A great new offering from Sierra Nevada and one I'll definitely come back to this fall."
"Poured out a medium dark amber brew with a nice fluffy head . Has moderate carbonation. Smells like it has a nice malty backbone. Taste is of a dry beer, mildly smoky ,no noticeable hops. Not a ton of flavor, but what is present i like.Very mild session beer.Not a big fan of brown ales , but this one is very tolerable."
"Cheers!!"
"D: Great way to transition from sweet summer ales to autumn beers. This would be great on tap as well!"
"D: A great Fall/Winter Brown ale. Session worthy but a little on the heavy side. I could drink this again."
"D: A very enjoyable, easy-drinking brown ale from Sierra Nevada. Well-rounded and refined, as you'd expect from this brewery. It manages to be both sweeter and hoppier than many American brown ale. It's down to 80 here today in DC, which seems positively autumnal after July and August, and this is a welcome fall seasonal for 2010."
"RJT"
"D- Really nice brown ale; lots of nice nutty and smokey flavors but still balanced to be easily sessionable."
"d: right in the middle of light and medium in body so naturally, the drinkability is pretty good. IMO, it lacks a more robust chocolate/coffee/hazelnut flavor that i've come to expect in most browns. Good beer overall."
"D - I really enjoyed the feel of this beer, it offers a smooth almost creamy texture while still being on the lighter side of medium bodied, which makes it extremely quaff-able to me. I could sit and enjoy 4-5 Pints of this brew! Very good with a decent price, I'll definitely buy this one again, very tasty and I recommend it. Cheers!"
"Its not ""world class," but its another solid beer from the fine folks at SN."
"Drinkability: this is a very easy to quaff beer and for me could be a nice session beer for an afternoon."
"D: A great fall brew, I'll likely have it again once it starts getting cooler."
"A good brown ale from SN. Can't wait for the Fall to arrive here in New England."
"D: An easy autumn brew, but the flavor of roasted malt leaves your mouth feeling a bit dry. Coupled with the overall subdued character of this beer, I find myself wanting something more flavorful and refreshing. Maybe it's still too early in the year."
"Sweet malt and nut flavors up front with a balanced fullness, bitterness from the hops in the back. A very good Brown Ale."
"Overall, I was not too impressed with this one. This hasn't been my favorite brown ale, but it wasn't the worst. It was worth a try, and I may give this one another chance before the year is out."
"D- Not to filling & after the first you cant help but want more, very satisfying & a wonderful beer to kick of fall, which was the first we got at a bar I work at, & could not wait to try it, & now that I did I'm very happy with this beer, great job to one of my favorite brewery's."
"single from Whole Foods, Vienna, VA"
"As part of my boycotting too-early-released Oktoberfests, Pumpkins, etc, I will gladly partake in this alternatively seasonal brown ale offering from Sierra Nevada. It is the first day of September after all... Pours a nice Crayola brown, with a smallish head. Not a whole heck of a lot going on in the nose - a bit musty. Taste is nice though - malt, toffee, and a bit of dusty hops. Pretty straightforward and drinkable, tasty, just nothing particularly charismatic about this one. An extra dimension (maybe a little more nutty, roasty... something) would put this beer in my fridge on a regular basis. But as is, this is a nice alternative to the plethora of other fall seasonals. It is what it is; a solid brown ale."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a light brown in color with a small off white head. Aroma is of bready malts. Good amount of caramel malt, nutty flavors and a crisp finish. Good body to it and makes it very drinkable. Not a whole lot of hops, but very true to the style."
"I poured into my glass to two fingers of tan head. This beer is dark amber in color. The aroma is a nutty caramel. The flavor is mirrors the aroma. It kind of reminds me of Sam Smith nut brown. This is a decent beer. It goes down smooth and has a nice, nutty flavor."
"Cheers!"
"Even so, you can down 3 watchin' a ball game and not fuss about the fine print."
"The body has an unexpected spritzy effervescence. I would like a little more solid, rich malty body in an autumn ale. Something to stand up to creamy, thick autumn stews, perhaps."
"The Sierra Nevada Tumbler Brown Ale pours a clear brown in the glass with a thick, creamy white froth with decent lacing, thick bubbles, & great retention. Aromas of roasted nuts, bitter dark chocolate, subtle fresh espresso, sweet malt, herbal hops, rich earthiness, & soft maple syrup follow through as flavors on the palate. The beer has a rich sweetness up front & finishes with a smooth dryness. There is a great balance on acidity that should allow this to pair nicely with food. (BBQ Ribs anyone?) Overall, this is a pretty decent beer & although it is not one of Sierra Nevada's best, it is definitely worth a try. Recommended."
"O - I don't get the venom directed at this beer in the forums. It's a fairly mainstream brown ale that gets its job done, and the price is right for the most part, especially once it goes on sale in a month or two. I'd have to say that I'll probably go through another six-pack or two."
"MF&D - Went down nicely. Slightly sweet lip feel with decent carbonation. A nice fall session Brown."
"Taste is better than the aroma. Once again consists primarily of toasted grains and some bread, but the coffee notes are a bit more noticeable, yet still subdued. There is a tiny underlying hop presence here that was not noticeable in the aroma."
"EDIT: I originally gave the drinkability a 4.0, but upon further drinking it got harder & harder to drink. I bought a six pack thinking it would make a decent session beer.. But I was wrong.. After about 2, it gets boring and bland."
"Overall: Solid beer overall and a good representation of the style. Very solid choice for a crisp autumn day."
"drinkability: They took an avg style and perfected it. Nice job. Could have used more hop presence but well done."
"D- Great brew overall, not a favorite style of mine.. I don't care much for the thin body waterness. However, the flavors here are very welcoming."
"D - An enjoyable beer but far from memorable. Not one that I would seek out every fall."
"Drinkability: Definitely easy enough to drink with really no weight to it and a pretty minimal ABV -- kind of boring, but certainly solid enough"
"12oz. brown bottle served in a tumbler (how fitting). Bottle code 0 190 110 47 printed on the label. Pours a semi-translucent chestnut brown with a loose, half-inch, tan-colored head. Head eventually dissipates into a fairly consistent skim. Some spatters and swaths of lacing exposed during the tasting. Great nose - caramel malt, a little nutty and roasty and the faintest of hop aromas to cut some of the malty sweetness. Taste follows nose; however, there's also a bit of a roasted coffee character in the mix. All and all a nice well-rounded body with a light hops profile to even out the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an lively carbonation that tickles that palate without being prickly. A very good American Brown that drinks easy and can be sessioned. It actually reminds me a little bit of Surly Bender."
"it's an easy drinking beer. one that non-craft drinking friends can enjoy. i would definitely drink this beer over most other brown ales"
"Well, its highly drinkable in the sense that its completely unoffensive and boring. Its mildly hoppy, mildly roasty, mild medium body, mild mildness, smooth. Its like drinking watered down beer I guess."
"This is quite pleasant and even a little intriguing to one who doesn't imbibe brown ales very often. The smoke adds depth without overpowering."
"This could be one of the most disappointing SN beers I've ever had. In fact, I'd be hard-pressed to name a SN beer I disliked as much as this beer. While I think it's fair to say 'bad' for SN is still far better than some beers out there...I think fans of SN will be less than impressed by this beer...as will fans of Brown Ales."
"Highly recommended, though not very nutty (the hops eat up the parts of the profile where those flavors would go, I feel). If you like nuttier browns this may not be the one for you."
"D: Very drinkable, this is actually crisp like a fall breeze, not a whole lot of alcohol - really well done."
"An attractive ruby-hued brown with a picture-perfect head. Smell is a lovely mixture of coffee, brown sugar, and biscuits. They nailed the texture on this one. That strikes me before the flavor even. It's just amazingly soft, like a nitrogen-infused beer. I'm pretty sure their porter has this exceptional quality too. On to the flavor... It's just solid, from start to finish, and it doesn't hit you over the head with any one flavor. There's just a light roast and light brown sugar sweetness that hit the right amount together. It feels like a light stout, but in no way feels thin on flavor. I really do think I could enjoy this as a session beer. It definitely screams 'fall', as much as I'm trying not to romanticize it. Another top-knotch beer from Sierra Nevada."
"Pours a dark brown color (maybe like coke) with a two finger head light tan head. Leaves some cool lacing on the way down. Smells roasty-malty-nutty, you can smell it, but it isn't a strong smell. Taste is similar, starts off sweeter and finished more bitter. As the beer warms the taste becomes exponentially more potent. Mildly carbonated with a medium body. Its not a bad beer, but its not one of my favorites, maybe i'm just not a big fan of the style."
"A new offering from Sierra Nevada, one of the most consistent breweries out there. Pours a nice mahogany color, nice nutty smell to it... nice looking beer on our hands. Taste is medium bodied, nice mouthfeel to it. Taste has some good maltiness to it, slight bit of hop backbone.. a bit boring overall of a taste though to be honest. Could have used some more nut/caramel type of flavors in there, finish is a bit underwhelming too. Definitely an above average brown ale, but I thought SN could have done a tad bit better.. still pretty damn good though."
"D: Drinkability is pretty good. Generally unoffensive, but also barely keeping me interested."
"A smooth and sessionable American Brown."
"First I heard of this beer was today while I was perusing Save on Beer in Cranberry. Went with it as Sierra Nevada rarely disappoints. The beer is easy to drink and has the making of a great fall session beer."
"drinkability is tumbler's strongest suit. you could session this one with an ease...sit back and wait for the leaves to change."
"High drinkability with no sign of the alcohol present, I was able to drink 3 of the 6 with such ease that I had to stop myself from drinking the rest this evening. Another fine Sierra Nevada product."
"Drinkable enough as a session beer that you can ignore as you BS with friends."
"D: Highly quaffable. I would thoroughly enjoy a couple of these while sitting around a late summer/early fall firepit or campfire."
"Drinkability: A flavorful and infinitely drinkable beer."
"D - easy enough to drink but I'm not a big fan of this one."
" This is a clean and rightous brown ale which i find easier to drink a bit more complex than most Brown's I've had."
"High on the hop bitterness scale for the style, which I like and have come to expect from SN. The initial flavor, although shortlived, features a sweet, mildly caramelized crystal malt. Long lasting bitter hop aftertaste. The body is thinner than I would expect, but it isn't much of a distraction. Overall, an easy beer to enjoy."
"D: another winner from Sierra Nevada. This brown ale features an array of wonderfully balanced flavors and is a welcome addition to the seasonal lineup."
"Clear, deep brown with a short beige cap. Lots of lacing, good head retention. Lots of malt in the aroma, a bit of caramel, toast, a little nutty with a hint of roast. Fairly sweet with low to moderate bitterness. Plenty of caramel and toffee, nuts and faint roast, a little citrus in the finish. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, decent texture. Not bad at all -- a serviceable brown ale."
"D: A nice addition to the SN cupboard - not a world-beater by any stretch, but just a mellow malty brown ale, lightly hopped, with an unassuming but unique flavor. This will be a nice session ale this next 6 months around my house. A malty beer my wife and I will both enjoy."
"Improves considerably as it warms and the flavors really come out. Could maybe do with a touch less carbonation but slides down the gullet with ease. Excellent choice for fall evenings with some football or a good book."
"Served to me with a finger width of head. Color was as dark a brown as it gets with only a little light passing through at the edges. Clarity was good and retention and lacing were average. Smell was muted but decent. Notes of toasted malts and a little toffee. Flavor is pretty average for a brown. Malt forward with a touch of bitter earthy hops and a bit nutty. Mouthfeel is decent. A full body and a dry bitter finish. A drinkable brown ale but is a bit ho-hum for me."
"Though it's still way hot here in NC, this tastes pretty darn good and will definitely work this into my regular rotation, especially when it (finally) cools down. Sierra Nevada does it again, and again..."
"Very drinkable. It's pretty hoppy for a Brown Ale. I was expecting little more malts than hops. Otherwise it's pretty delicious beer."
"D-I generally like SN beers but at first didn't care for this one all that much but it has grown on me a little. Definitely a solid brown ale worth trying."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Pretty solid beer for a style thats generally not my favorite. Pours deep mahogany in color, with a creamy white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is rich of roasted malt, some caramel and a very slight chocolate. Taste again features the toasted grains and roasty malt, slightly dry. A nice caramel presence as well, perhaps a little nutty. Mouthfeel was smooth and velvety, on the lighter side but not too light. Overall a very solid beer and easy drinker. Think this would be great on a nice fall day while watching some football."
"D: A very nice brown ale. A nice change of pace beer for me. Could easily drink several during a nice cloudy brish fall day."
"24 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a copper/brown color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is brown sugar, caramel, toffee and toasted malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some pine hops and a bit of nuts and smoke. There's also a slight lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a little bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and quite enjoyable. It's an interesting brown ale, I certainly didn't expect the balance between the malt and hops in this brew, I thought for sure it would be maltier. It's a pretty decent brew overall, and for $2.99 a bomber I think it's a good deal too. I'd buy this again."
"It finishes more earthy and some more light floral hops, but gets somewhat bitter. A slight hop oil resin taste starts to break through but never really comes out. It dries quite a bit, but leaves a very slight lingering sweetness. A very slight sugar memory and hint of earthy rustic barnyard taste. A nice sessionable beer."
"Overall, Sierra Nevada does an amazing job of taking a beer and brewing it to it's style. When I review any other beer (Brown Ale, Stouts, Porters...) I always use SN as a baseline."
"Great seasonal offering from SN, nice choice for this time of year. Easy-drinking with a balanced complexity, exactly what I look for in a brown ale."
"D - This has good drinkability. Finishes clean and smooth and I could definitely go for another one of these."
"Overall- simple beer, real drinkable. Good, but a bit over hyped in my opinion."
"D - Very drinkable session beer that is relatively light in ABV and carbonation. This beer will set up nicely for the cool fall New England days ahead. A good tailgater candidate!"
"Poured into a wide chalice, Tumbler is a dark reddish-brown color. Not much of a head formed, and what did quickly faded. The aroma is pleasant enough, offering mostly caramel with a touch of toffeeness. The flavor continues the same general theme as the nose, plus a touch of roast. Bitterness from the roasted malt together with moderate hop bitterness offsets the sweetness well. Decently crafted, though generic."
"2010 series marked 021111813. Sampled on Aug. 26, 2010. It has a nice looking mahogany brown pour with a thick, puffy beige head a good two inches thick that leaves a decent lace in its wake. The maltiness is up front in the aroma with a bit of toffee and sweet dark fruits. The taste begins malty and turns bitter with a dry hopped ending. A very nice balance."
"Pours a mahogany with translucent amber hues into a stella glass. Nose is nothing but metallic, even after letting it air out. Head is one finger with slight retention. Taste is way over hopped for a brown ale, watery oxidized nothing and very hard to put much of a malt profile at all on this. Whatever malt profile there is, albeit weak is overwhelmed by the bitter. I'm not sure how this gets marks above a c. This beer is terrible and the worst brown ale I've ever had. No reason for a more extensive review."
"Anyway, tell your unenlightened friend to pick this up instead of Newcastle any day. It's less expensive too."
"D - A nice, drinkable brown. Good combo of smooth sweetness with the roasted malt character. The hop poking it's head up at the end makes you want more."
"D_Very drinkable.Great session brown ale."
"D: all around pretty boring and disappointing. I'm love Sierra, but this one feels forced and uninspired. I would honestly expect more from them"
"Really enjoyed this beer, very fruity from either the hops or yeast, most likely the hops. Malt character is fairly restrained, but works well with the hops. Definitely enjoyed it."
"The flavor is toast, hard mineral earthiness along with cereal grain (duh). A slight sweetness shows up as well and the finish is clean with a lingering sweet bread flavor. The mouth feel is full enough for sure and actually maybe saves this from being purely moderate. Overall a nice addition to the SN line-up."
"Overall: An excellent beer. Well balanced, not over the top. Yeast and ester profile really showcase this beer. Can have several and want more."
"Malt. Dark, rich roasted and--well, I'm getting ahead of myself. Poured rich and dark like coffee, with a very nice tan head that stayed through the first half. Hint of roasted and caramel (sweet, in this case) in the nose, with none of the expected smoky stout-like flavor. Initial taste was a tad sweet, rich and malty and well rounded with a mild hop bitterness. Sweetened as you went along, but no negatives in the flavor department. Might get a little rich after awhile, but these are very (emphasize very) drinkable. Could put them down easily and love every minute. Even the last few drops tasted good. Nice job."
"O: Very solid selection from Sierra Nevada. I would expect nothing less."
"Overall, not a bad brown ale. A good beer to drink while watching football, but not the best brown ale in the world. A decent beer for the fall season."
"pours a dark brown color one or two finger head depending on the pour good head retention and a spotty lace to the finish. faint nutty smell with slightly nutty big toasted malt taste thats light and smooth and slightly dry no hops noted here in my opinion the way a brown ale should taste. a good simple straight foreword dark easy to drink beer."
"Sierra Nevada Tumbler is a clear, red-brown ale with a bubbly light khaki head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a dry, wooden aroma with a green, botanical note. It's medium bodied, soft and smooth with a dry, crisp finish that leaves the mouth a little chalky. It tastes well balanced, resiny and nutty with a green, leafy bitterness. It's very smooth and drinkable."
"D: This is a very nice autumn offering from SN. I'm glad I picked it up."
"Pours a medium brown with a nice 1 finger head that hangs around all the way down. Smell of malty nutty goodness. Taste Malts and nuttiness, very little hop flavor. Medium mouth feel. These go down pretty good, I could have more than a few of these on a night."
"Pours medium brown with a one finger tan head. Nice retention and lot of laceing. Aroma is of spices,and bready malts,and brown sugar. Throw in a touch of hops too.Body is on the lighter side of medium, with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is of roasted malts and grain. Nice touch of hops in the finish. I'm not big on this style,but if you are you will like this one."
"Overall a great fall beer, or all year beer that provides nice flavor and is easy to sip on."
"D - Very easy to drink. Hot or cold day, this one goes down easy."
"Drinkabilty - Its not bad. Its a above average beer. To be honest its not on par with sierras' other great beers. Seems like this is a safe attempt at a brown ale. I would drink again, but i surely wouldnt pick up anymore 6-packs"
"good enough mouthfeel: judiciously distributes sweet toasty-roastiess. tastes like brown! (which means almost no esters). bitterness is strong but hops aroma and flavor are subtle. dry and very easy drinkin"
"D: One of the better brown ales I've tried. Drinkable."
"D: The complexity and balance make this a very sessionable beer."
"D= rather nice, sessionable unless the odd bite gets to you."
"Overall, this was a very good offering from Sierra Nevada. I enjoy their beers and this is another seasonal that I can get behind and have a few in a sitting."
"Served from tap into a shaker. Pours a deep dark brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to minimal quickly. There was nice lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt and a nutty note. The flavor was of roasted malt, pine, and an earthy character. It was light on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was not very appealing as there was not a lot going on in this one really. The flavors were very muted throughout. This one needs a little more of everything to make it enjoyable for myself in my opinion."
"The Tumbler is solid drive right up the middle. Mild applause from the gallery."
"edit: had this again recently and it impressed more. Still malt heavy but noticed some smoke and it was a prefect Autumn beer for a cool night."
"Overall, this is a good seasonal offering from Sierra Nevada, certainly worth bringing to a party that has both beer snobs and beer-phobes."
"A solid Fall offering (is it Fall already?). Sturdy malt body, with abundant caramel notes and a touch of chocolate. No malt bomb here, however, as well-rounded hops follow in quick-step to balance the flavor profile. Much more personality than the run-of-the-mill brown ale -nicely done."
"Drinkability: I'm starting to really dig these newer brown ales (definitely a style that's been neglected in the past few years). This one goes down smooth, mixes well with most robust food flavors and finishes nicely. I can definitely drink these all night long especially come the cooler (maybe not cold, thats imperial stout time) weather."
"A good example of how evolved the SN portfolio has become. Instead of their usual (and majority) hop-obsessed offerings, Tumbler is a study in malts, brown ale style. Especially the use of smoked malt, which gives this a dry dark chocolate profile. Unexpectedly good. The contrast between the dark brown color and the white foam, make this a beautiful ale glass presentation. Smooth with chocolate-mocha notes presents similarities to Schwarz bier. A surprise, and a good one. I can also foresee cooking possibilities. Slightly sweet, but finishes smoky dry, with Challenger hops instead of Cascade."
"A very light, crisp beer, nice carbonation and beautifully balanced, definitely a beer to drink all night."
"Mouthfeel was very nice."
"D- a low abv beer but seems heavy on my stomach. Filling and just not very good tasting make this hard to drink for me"
"Draft at Delaney's. Serviceable brown. Very dark brown, almost opaque. 3/8 inch of white foamy head. Some lace. Neutral aroma. Served a little on the cold side. Very drinkable, on the sweet side. The head looked a little unusual pattern, like mould spores.A tad below average mouthfeel."
"To me its a little early to drink autumn beers,even more so now living in hot NC,but I wanted a outdoor grilling beer and this fit the bill.Poured into a standard pint glass a brilliant chesnut brown with a light tannish colored one finger head that settled into a creamy mass.Aromas are lightly roasted with a fair amount of nut,some caramel sweetness as well,almost like a faint pecan pie element to it.Well rounded on the palate,some caramel and lightly roasted nuttiness along with some roast, a real nice shot of pine in the finish.Its a great blend of roasty and sweetish malt and earthy,piney hop,one of the best brown ales I have had,well done again from SN."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp copper with a nice frothy khaki head that slowly diminishes and leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is slight caramel malts with a hint of pine hops, not much there. The taste is crisp caramel malts with mild pine hops, no where near as hoppy as the bottle I had about a week before this one. The beer is enjoyable, and like I said in my bottle review, a fresh batch of this could be great in the actual Fall."
"Nice body on this beer, visibly viscous when swirled. Smooth and slick feel. This is a great fall beer from Sierra Nevada."
"D - An all around well crafted ale in my book, the malt is full on and the balance is there without neglecting the flavor in any sense - I would happily have this as a go-to , one of the best browns out there - the fresh malt is notable"
"Thanks again to the Market of choice for stocking this beer. Drank from a Highland Hollows pint glass. Pours a medium brown. Very roasty with a very malty backbone. Smells like late-September if that's possible. Hints of hops hit the palate very lightly while staying true to the maltiness."
"D- Pretty good, a solid autumn session beer. Not too strong at 5.5%, good flavors, a solid seasonal brew from the mighty SN."
"Notes: It's a well rounded beer a good offering from Sierra Nevada. Cheers."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, I thought it had some great flavors for the style. I wasn't really expecting the coffee and roasty flavors but they really added to the depth of the flavor and the balance for me. Very nice brown ale overall."
"cheers..."
"I suppose what you would expect from Sierra, nothing bad but nothing that's above average. All around an average beer, but average for this style is pretty darn good."
"Sad that Anniversary was shelved for this."
"Yum. I need more of this beer."
"Unfortunately, this is nothing special from SN. After really enjoying everything I have had from them I am disapointed. Its just a average brown ale. Has a nice little malt toasty flavor with a little bit of that SN hops at the end. But nothing stands out. Its certainly easy to drink and can be a nice session brew, but its not up to the standards of SN."
"Overall I think the best way to describe this beer is ""inoffensive"". There's not a whole lot about this beer that I would foresee BMC and non-BMC drinkers complaining about, and perhaps that is what SN is going for with their revamped marketing. Not worth seeking out, but a solid beer that's worth trying if it pops up."
"drinks ok. nothing repulsive, but nothing attractive either. I have had many better beers from Sierra Nevada and have had many better browns. I would rather an ""above average"" IPA (their anniversary ale) than this any day. I'll finish the 24oz bottle, but probably won't buy another."
"With some real outstanding American-style browns on the market these days (I'm thinking Lost Coast's Downtown Brown, Bear Republic's Pete's Brown, Big Sky's Moose Drool), Sierra really had to distinguish itself here with something special ... and didn't."
"Pours a clear chestnut brown color with a wonderfully puffy khaki head that is slowly settling. The aroma has some mineral aspects to it, brown bread and general nuttiness. The taste is of brown bread, light brown sugar with a hint of toffee. There is some tea and lemon flavors which add some dry flavors and there is a fairly minimal grassy bitterness in the end. I also pick up some roasted malt as well. The ale has a moderate to full body and tingly carbonation which gives an almost creamy feel. Starts off sweet but the roasted and hoppy bitterness come in to balance everything out. Finishes a bit dry and slightly astringent. A very solid brown ale, some nice malty flavor."
"Notes-This is quite simply a quality brown ale, nothing stands out in particular but I feel that is in a way its strength as it rounds together all the necessities of a brown ale and does them each equally well. Perfect for session drinking in my book."
" A good beer, but I'd rather have a pale ale or Torpedo."
"D: Flavorful and balanced. Very enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel is the right mix of creamy and crisp. The body is medium to light and the carb is spot-on. I could drink a lot of this. I find brown ales too often overlooked, but this beer reminds me that they can please my roasted malt fix without being a chore to drink like stouts."
"Pours the color of autumn brown, smells sort of nutty with notes of hopps. Taste is bitter sweet with a bit more emphasis on the bitter. A sort of has some pleasant malty finish with hopps flavor seira nevada is known for. This one is plenty drinkable"
"Pours a dark brown with an off white head that fades fast. Smell is somewhat smoky, a small sweetness, with a nice malt aroma. The taste starts with the subtle smoke, followed by the sweetness and malt flavor, and a nice smooth finish. The mouthfeel is medium, a nice balance in flavor, not a powerful flavor but still deep. This is a great session beer, the flavors are great, I will be drinking this one often."
"D: A good brown ale, try it"
"A solid brown ale and a nice oktoberfest seasonal alternative."
"D-Always looking for a good American brown ale. This one is pretty nice!"
" Thoroughly enjoyable. A nice addition to the SN line of fine beers. Do they ever make a bad beer?"
"D: A really disappointing effort from a brewery that is nearly bulletproof. And it's even worse because it is replacing a solid offering."
"Drinkability: You'd be hard-pressed to find a better American brown ale than this. Unique, flavorful, balanced, and tasty; extremely drinkable. This may have just dethroned Deschutes Buzzsaw Brown as my favorite American brown ale."
"Brown colored beer with rich head that lingers throughout the drink and has an excellent taste added. Very crisp beer. It has a rich chocolate and toffee smell. Pungent for a brown ale. Taste is incredible. One of my favorite brown ales. There is a sweet chocolate start that ends with a bitter toffee finish. It's really a good beer, I wish it was available more often. Lightly carbonated, clean and crisp. I'd highly recommend, get it if you find it."
"""Good night, StonyB."""
"A terrific Brown Ale that has everything that the style perscribes. However, with no real outstanding character, the beer is hard to celebrate."
"Pours chestnut brown with a decent head that sticks around as a thin cap. Classic brown ale aromas, with bready malt, a touch of toast, and some citrus and pine from the hops. There is a bit of grainy sourness as well, which is never my favorite. The taste is similar, a bit softer than the nose would suggest, and the hops are a bit more restrained as well. The mouthfeel is soft and creamy, and overall I'd say this is pretty solid. Not all that grainy, creamy, and a bit less bready and toasty than some, but a well crafted, gentle brown that goes down easily."
"This is an interesting addition to the SN arsenal. Wish it carried a bit more weight in the body and the flavors complemented the nose a bit better. Nonetheless, this a pleasant drinker and not a bad accompaniment to the fall season."
"Pours a very rich ruby brown color with a fluffy hazelnut colored head and a beautiful red hue to it. Has nice lacing and really clear body. The aroma is a tad muted. Has a tinge of roasted hazelnuts and walnuts. Really not much to smell. The taste is very nice and surprisingly refreshing fro a brown ale. Has a slight hop note to it that really sets it off and wakes this brew up. Sessionable and enjoyable. Really nice mouthfeel and great carbonation level. Has a lemony aftertaste to balance out the malt. A touch thin for me and really would be a much better beer if the body was bigger. Overall this is a great brown ale. Really nice addition to Sierra nevada's lineup. I would love to see a pumpkin beer for their fall beer but this will do."
"Overall, a really good brown that I highly recommend. Nice and smooth flavor that has a good balance between the sweet and roasted malts. Very drinkable - an easy session beer. Also would be a good beer to give friends who want to expand past the BMC's. Avail here in TX. Rotation - been in a hop mode these days so brown don't take up much space in the fridge these days but I can see a 6 pack of these per season. Maybe more if sharing with my craft newbie neighbors. [O;O]"
"I'm not so sure about old Tumbler. It has some good things going on but just falls apart at the end of each drink. Maybe it will pull itself together after a month or so. Who knows?"
"Overall: I saw this and could not help getting an early sample of fall brews in general and Sierra Nevada's in specific. It is a nice brew though, to be blunt, not my favorite offering of the fall. I feel the balancing hops are a bit to strong, again a personal taste, I prefer my fall beers to be pretty malty."
"Served on tap, pouted nice and smooth with a soft white head that faded and left a small amount of lacing in the glass. The beer is a nice reddish brown with a nice thin light off white head. The smell is heavy with malt and roasted barley. Very small amount of hops in the nose. Taste is of smooth sweet malt that is balanced at the end by a small amount of spicy hops, with a small biscuit dry malt finish. This beer is more malt than hops unlike most SN beers. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth just enought carbonation to give the beer a nice body. I would say the drinkability of this beer is very high, a definate fall sessionable seasonal. Not a fantastic beer by SN but a very pleasing fall beer."
"Picked up a six pk of this and shared it with some friends. It poured a reddish brown, not what I was expecting, but it still looked alright. Took a smell of this beer and nothing was really standing out. You could barely pick out the roasted nuts, maybe some carmel malts, and other aromas I wasn't able to pinpoint. The taste was a little underwhelming to tell you the truth. Not that is was bad, it just was average. Nothing really stood out! It was very similar to it's aroma. Its an ok beer, but I will probably skip it the next time I'm at the store!"
"D - Kind of on the heavy side, but I would not hesitate to have another."
"Pours an almost clear reddish brown with minimal creamy yellowish head, some sticky lacing. Scent is faint, lightly sweet carmel malts, some roasted nuts, bready yeasts and a hint of char and earth. Taste is slightly more aggressive, with a nice blend of lightly sweet carmel and roasted nut flavors, a more pronounced smokey taste blends with the bready yeasts. Lighter side of medium bodied, decent carbonation. A good beer that doesnt do much to wow, but just enough to please the palate."
"D- Its easy to drink, but it just didn't do anything for me. I thought this one was a bit boring."
"Medium body with medium carbonation and a dry mouthfeel. A very drinkable brown that isn't mindblowing but makes for another straight up solid offering in the SN lineup. This is something I'll probably want to have around in a few more weeks when fall actually comes around."
"D: Decent drinkability, but nothing really jumps out at me saying drink more. It does remind me a lot of the coming season."
"Combining the flavor and the mouthfeel this beer is dangously drinkable. I am not usually a brown ale fan but this one is to good not to have again."
"Overall: Incredible american brown ale! Love this beer. Perfect for autumn. Now I just wish it was actually chilly outside."
"Overall impression: Not as agressively hopped as some American Browns but a solid example of the style. This category tends to leave me wanting for more but SN hits the nail on the head. The only thing I really want now is some cool weather to accompany this fine beer!"
"Overall, a nice brown ale. Nothing too over the top or outstanding, but solid. Great flavor profile for a fall seasonal. The roasted character makes this enjoyable."
"Notes: As the cooler weather rolls in, the drinkability will go up to high. This is a great new seasonal beer that I look forward to drinking more of as we come into the best month: October."
"D. Easy drinking. Good session beer. Nice take on an autumn ale. Can you really expect Sierra Nevada to not put out a good beer."
"D- ah, those west coast hop guys. this is another great brew to go along with recent additions kellerweiss, torpedo, and glissade (the latter being my least favorite). i'm not a brown ale lover but this one has the right balance of hops that i would expect from the dub-c and still enough toasty earthiness to keep it from being sickly sweet. much different than british versions but drinkable on it's own, and this one will be perfect when fall actually gets here."
"Drinkability: Nice autumn seasonal with characteristics of an English Brown Ale, a Porter and a Scotch Ale. I may have liked the Anniversary Ale a tinge better, but I am a sucker for IPAs, so I realize that this is probably the better beer, and certainly better as a fall seasonal."
"Very drinkable, quite tasty - a touch early for the fall seasonals, but excited to grab a sixer off the shelf."
"D: A solid brew. Weird to see a fall seasonal in mid-August, but that's how it goes. Well made, but not super interesting, not as good as the brown ale they made a few years back."
"very drinkable - as it should be @ 5.5abv."
"Pours a dark ruby brown hue with highlights when held up toward to the light. Mocha tan head forms thick with fine even lacing. Big chunky sporadic clumps of laced stick to the glass. Served a bit warm is perfect all kind of malt and hop nose going on here for me to describe. Light coffee dark chocolate roasted malt character with a touch of toasted nut, a bit green and vinous with the hop nose well interwoven with the darker malts. Hops herbal mint with the malts providing a refreshing mix of dark caramel/chocolate/and mild coffee accents. Mouthfeel is medium bodied soft carbonation going on, I guess Sierra Nevada really wants to make a brown ale. Drinkable especially as the beer warms up, I can't wait to settle in with a 12 pack of this as the weather cools off."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"a really nice beer to session, a little refreshing as well. goes down quick and easy. theres not much here that i really dont like. a simple beer made very well. i would buy this again, and for the cheap price, its definatly worth a try."
"This brew will not blow you away but if you are looking for a nice brown ale at a reasonable price this is not a bad choice."
"taste is smooth, with plenty of nut character, aong with some light caramel malts - drinkability is nice as well - this is a drinkable, somewhat refreshing ale."
"This beer is great, straddling the line between an American and English brown, without overdoing the unique aspects of either. The malt character of this beer is admirable, as others have noted, almost pushing into porter territory as far as intensity goes."
"Drinkability- It was really good. Very good brown ale. I will have more of it. They did a great job with this one."
"Dark, roasty aroma. Slightly biscuity, with a presence of chocolate. Deep malty, comforting aroma. Deep amber color with subtle red cast. Light, cream colored lacy foam. Moderate carbonation. no hop presence in aroma or taste. Dryer malty taste, with dry finish. Simple and drinkable. Aftertaste clears the mouth quickly. Sweet beginning with biscuity tones throughout. Good fall addition to Sierra nevadas line up"
"Better than any brown ale I've had from a smaller brewer in recent history. The best from Sierra since the anniversary stout. If you are down on this, you just don't like the style, which is fine of coarse."
"meh."
"D: Tumbler is a simple brown ale that drinks well, but nothing really jumps out about it. Given the price, it's a great alternative to other commonly available brown ales like Newcastle, but I likely wouldn't choose it over the several other more interesting session brown ales out there."
"Verdict: A tasty little brew and solid Brown Ale (though sometimes it feels more like a Porter), Tumbler is a welcome addition to the Sierra Nevada seasonal family. However, I'm not yet quite convinced this was worth the axing of the very tasty Anniversary Ale."
"Pours a very nice deep brown color with some nice head, although very little lacing. Excellent deep scent with wonderfully roasted malt grain aromas; very dark and rich. Great flavor, huge deep grain flavors; a nice roastiness; some nice hops at the end, but just to even it out; a wonderful Ent-draught! Goes down very smooth."
"D-overall a low alcohol, easy to drink and balanced brown ale; I've had other brown ales that tend to be on the hoppy end or too dry, but this wasn't bad at all; I'll definitely be seeking this out later in the season as it will be a great alternative to pumpkin and oktoberfest beers in the autumn nights"
"Another surprise from D. Kurtz. Hey lets try the new ""Tumbler"". ""OK"". Poured into Sam Adams glass, Dark translucent brown. 1 inch receding bubbly head. Not much aroma, maybe a little roasted malt. Taste of roasted malt for sure, and a hint of chocolate on the back. This reminds my of an English Brown. Not as full bodied or Malty as some American versions. Dry roasty, subtle hop finish. I can drink the hell out of this beer. Probably go as far as saying a ""Session""."
"Mouthfeel a bit thin. Not my favorite from Sierra Nevada, but it's certainly better than their anniversary series (which I have always hated, and am glad they retired)."
"I was drinking these the other night at my poker game as well, and don't recall this off-smell; of course, that was straight outta the bottle. Perhaps I shall have to sample this again later in the season."
"Mouthfeel is thin and unexciting; there's not a lot of lasting flavor or body. All of these factors just serve to make Tumbler a miss as far as what I expect from a Sierra Nevada brown ale, especially after enjoying their porter and stout so much."
"D -- Great drinkability. The balance of roasted malts and resiny hops is better in this brew than most (including some of SN's other beers), very easy drinking on cool nights in front of the fire pit!"
"Dark brown with good clarity, this beer has a dense, light brown head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is rather bad, though. Sulfury with rotten eggs and caramel and toast. It would be good for breakfast if the eggs weren't rotten, maybe? A little brown sugar as well. The palate opens sulfury, dry, toasty and has some brown sugar and caramel. Moderate earthy hop character is present. Drying finish with some brown sugar and more sulfur. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this would actually be good if not for the sulfur. I'm going to have to revisit this."
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Overall a rich, roasty brown ale that seems ideally suited for a cool autumn evening. Smooth, and very easy to drink. Certaily will have again."
"Goes down quite smooth for a 'heavy' beer, would definitely drink again."
"D: Good brown ale that isn't short on flavor. I'd probably drink more of these if I was in the mood."
"oh browns, how i love thee. pours a deep brown/ruby/something pretty color with a decent head that dies down to a small ring that leaves some nice lacing. mainly nutty and malty in the nose and much of the same on the palate. but, in traditional SN style, it is hopped more than your usual brown. gives it a nice ""bite"". medium carbonation and pretty smooth. this is a winner and goes down with ease. easy ease."
"Great Job SN. This one and the Glissade are wonderful!"
"It had a clean malty taste with very little bitterness and overall it was simple and pleasing brew. I would buy again."
"Overall, this is a nice offering from Sierra Nevada and a welcome newcomer to the list of widely-available autumn brews."
"Drinkability - exceedingly drinkable, easily polished off a six of this. One of my favorite brown ales from a style that I normally shy away from and find rather boring. A good solid well priced beer."
"Brown ale, smells fresh and tasty. Aroma of sweet malts, nice crisp finish to the sip. Smooth mouthfeel, very drinkable. Hop regiment is really subtle, and there just to make the malt stand out. Malty flavor and aroma really remind me of musty autumn. Great brown ale and absolutely suiting to the season."
"EDIT: Just popped another one. I'm getting some fait peat smoke that is coming through as a tobacco flavor. Pretty good. Boosting taste rating to a 4."
"Edit: I really like this one.. I am not sure about some of the negative reviews.. but I honestly really dig the malt driven brown ale right now... even given the triple digit heat."
"I think this brown ale is well done. It's the perfect fall beer if you're looking for something other than a marzen. I can see myself drinking more of it once it starts to cool off."
"Pours a rich, dark, opaque chocolate brown with a fine-bubbled tan head. Aroma is spicy and malty and has a hint of caramel. Mainly malty flavor has tones of cloves and cinnamon and caramel traces. Lively, fizzy texture leaves a strong tingle as well as a malty and spicy finish."
"D- tumbler is a reasonable shot of a brown ale from the hop masters at SN. It's can be drinken at a reasonable degree. I enjoyed this with going down"
"Mouthfeel is pretty good and I can drink it just fine. Just nothing special. Good beer but I wouldn't get it again when I can get year round browns that are better."
"That part of it erks me. I sitting out here in the early August heat drinking this. I will put the rest away at least until the footballs are flying. It's good."
"I don't really find it special & probably won't buy it again, though I would drink it at a party or something."
"Pours a dark brown with mahogany edges and a khaki head that smells of toasted malts with some chocolate notes whispering in the distance. Taste is malt forward, thoroughly toasty, with earthy bitterness rounding it out. A bit undercarbonated IMO but tasty nonetheless."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty decent brown ale. Very easy to finish but also nothing really that special."
"Drinkability is pretty good but there are better brown ales out there, Legend from Virginia being one of them."
"Taste is sweet, malty and somewhat bitter. Finish is rather dry and there is plenty of foam in the mouth feel. Drinkability is easy. This is not my favorite style but a pretty good example."
"This is nothing all that special, but it is very enjoyable. I wish there was a bigger roasted malt character, but overall a very good beer that is worth a try."
"Nice looking label and hope the brew is just as nice. Pint glass pour and I am met with an amber ale and a beige foamy head with staying power. The aroma first reminded me of some of the adjunct beers but as it warms there is an overpowering malty aroma with orange and some chocolate hints. Taste is good with some roasted malts and a bitter coffee-like aftertaste that lingers on the tongue. A little too bubbly for my liking. The lower alcohol content allows for multiples, but I would be hard pressed to partake in more than one at a seating. Overall I was hoping for something special from this new release, but nothing ""wow's"" about this beer that would separate it from others of the same style."
"drinkability - i am glad to see SN drop an ipa for another style but i want less hops in my browns"
"I can see why Sierra wanted something other than another IPA like Anniversary in their rotation. This is not a bad beer by any stretch, but I think they could have done a bit better."
"Drinkability- extremely drinkable the balance is just so fine makes a great sessioner, could really enjoy a few of these no problem, while they are not complex to the extreme they still have a very great flavor with a beautiful balance, a very well done beer"
"Pours a light brown with a slowly dying head on top of a thick, hearty sweet cocoa malt smell with very minor hops. Taste does not deliver as much as aroma led me it would as there is a little bit of sweetness along with a roasted but bland finish. Minor hopping for balance lead to basically a slightly sweet and fruit OK brown, but given who made it it seems worse."
"I think you definitely would have to be in the mood for this style (which is why it confounds me SN released it so early). But I found this beer to be very tasty and it really hit the spot after a long night at work. I definitely wouldn't mind another one or two more..."
"This is definitely a dinner beer. The flavors are strong enough to hang with good cheeses and thick sauces or juicy meats, but not overbearing. On the other hand This could make a decent stand alone beer, but not a choice session beer."
"Very nice Brown Ale, loaded with flavor, very sessionable and refreshing. Nice one SN!"
"This is a great fall beer, not that I get fall, but if I did, i'd be drinking this one."
"This beer really could've been really great, although it's not bad at all, I REALLY like it. I just wish the flavors were more pronounced.. that would take this beer over the top, IMO. I might have to check this one out again as the weather gets cooler. Nonetheless, if you're into brown ales, definitely check this one out."
"Don't let this new offering from SN draw you in. Unless they just had some bad batches and plan to resolve this matchhead taste, IGNORE this beer like the plague."
"EDIT: Future tastings are leaving me with a little bit of an unpleasant finish. Tasty up-front, but the finish is a little too biting. I've now had 3 different brown ales from SN and none have been up to par with their other beers."
"Tastes a bit better, toast and toffee up front, but also a bit of rotting egg and mineral, along with a bit of grain husk astringency and herbal hops. Mouthfeel is thin, and the finish pretty rough. Yeah, this is pretty bad. This beer should not have been released in its current state."
"Another stunner from SN in the looks department, pours a lighter brown (with nice clarity to boot) with a thick and frothy tan head that retains nicely and leaves beautiful lacing. The aroma is a little more subdued than I was expecting, with toasted bread and caramel notes upfront, along with some dark fruits, slight mineraly hops, some smoke, a little musk and cocoa. The flavor has some smoke and caramel notes initially, along with cocoa and toasted bread, dark fruits, and a little musk. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but drinkability is excellent. Solid brown ale that really opens up as it warms, the fresh malt gives this beer a bit more complexity than your average brown ale."
"The flavor is mildly bitter, with some hazelnut sweetness. Malts aren't very sweet themselves. Medicinal and slightly herbal, metallic finish. Not much to go on here, but a reasonably drinkable ale that doesn't need to wait until fall."
"D'ability - Not overpowering, but the earthy maltiness wasn't my thing. Wouldn't have wanted another."
"Overall, Tumbler is...not bad. Unfortunately, there's nothing unique, or even memorable about it. It represents a swing-and-miss from a brewery with several home runs."
"D- I hesitate to use the word sessionable on this site anymore but this one does drink quite easily. Its just not really my kinda thing."
"Drink: Cant wait to drink a pint of this when the leaves are turning brown, it will make it that much more better!"
"An interesting ale, its biggest attraction is how smooth easy to drink it is. Definitely a beer I will buy again."
"Pours a deep auburn with a gentle head, some fine lacing clings to the pint glass. Nose is sweet: peanut brittle, faint raisin hints, and I swear I smell -- or want to smell -- a very thin trace of, gosh, pumpkin pie. Taste opens up with a bit of a hop kick on the tip of my tongue, smoothed out by the mellow sweetness indicated in the nose. Closes on a very balanced twining of hop bitter and malt sweet. Mouthfeel is just about right, perhaps a bit thin for a fall seasonal. Overall highly drinkable and interesting enough, per usual for Sierra Nevada."
"Overall this is a very easy drinking and enjoyable brown ale, though I was hoping for a little more robust malt and nut notes as well as perhaps a tad bit heavier body."
"Fall Seasonal in July, awesome. Not sure why they ditched the anniversary IPA in favor of this, that was a great beer. This isn't bad if you like brown ales and it is easy to drink. The smell is kind of bland with a hint of maltiness to it. The flavor is a decent brown ale, malty but I'd rather have their porter any day of the week. Still, this was not bad I just don't feel it is good enough to replace the Anniversary IPA."
"Medium-thin bodied with appropriate carbonation. Grainy texture. Good drinkability."
"The flavor is an interesting blend of bitter, earthy hops and bittersweet roasted malts. Tumbler finishes with an English-toffee sweetness and a hint of medicine. I can't really say that it all gelled for me...something...disparate about the whole flavor profile. Mouthfeel is lively with carbonation and the medium body bodes well on the palate, finishing with a crisp smoothness that only Sierra Nevada can pull off. Bottom line: not bad, but not great. Although I wasn't a huge fan of SN's Anniversary IPA, I still think it was a better Fall release than Tumbler will be."

"D: My guide for a daily drinker like this is whether I would get a six of these for a poker game. Nope, the combination of the odd smell and boring taste means I will grab their pale ale before I buy this."
"EDIT: 8 bottles of this 12-er have been ""bad"" (i.e. the same as above). Drain pouring my money away."
