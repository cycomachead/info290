Excited carbonation. Pretty nice aroma too quite sweet and malty, molasses. The hops are definitely coming through as well. It's a very nice drinkable beer. Chocolate, roasted malt, and some alcohol but it's hard to really describe the flavor because it's kinda nondescript but pleasant. When this first hit my palate it came across as quite bitter but I adjusted to it after two or three sips and it becomes quite drinkable. I'm a hop head, this isn't a hoppy beer but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. It's a great brown Ale!","CA_brewster","Oct 14, 2013"

Yeah, a brown pour for this brown ale. The aroma is rather straight-forward, offering a slightly nutty robust maltiness. The taste follows, but with some hops not as susceptible on the nose offer a deep earthy, resiny character that compliments the malts very well. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and gently carbonated, and the drinkability is great. Overall, Bear Republic do a great, fairly traditional brown ale.","shand","Mar 10, 2013"

Touches of caramel as well as a light tobacco touch to it. Really huge brown ale here. Smooth, mellow carbonation, rich, creamy profile with each sip having to be savored time, and time again.

Reddish brown color, opaque with more clarity at the rims as well as an orange cast. The nose much more demure than expected, caramel, milk chocolate, black raisins and cherries, brazil nuts, indistinct roast to it, same could be said for the mixed citrus nuances, little here bespeaks a strong hops presence. Medium-bodied, the carbonation churns and fluffs things up. Malt, carob, milk chocolate powder, caramel and molasses all there but, truthfully, it's not overly sweet. Lower levels of raisin, black grape, cherry, apricot fruit and the orange to lemon citrus drops off a notch as well. Maybe it's an after effect of the carbonation but you get a suggestion of mineral water. The nuttiness holds off but shows nicely through the finish.

Lots of caramel and chocolate come through, roasted malt flavor is negligible. Hops come out more here at the tail end, plays well with the carbonation as it gives a slight tingle to the tongue and adds a slight bite. Has a nice feel as it washes across the mouth, creamy like feel. Overall this is a very easy drinking brew and what I think is a great brown ale - one of my favorite styles.

It's almost like a porter. There's a nice sweet aftertaste that lingers. This beer doesn't have much punch when it hits your mouth, which was a disappointment.

The first impression on tasting was of a very nicely balanced malt with a hint of mincemeat pie filling, muted tartness but not fruity. The texture was silky and smooth with a lingering bitter finish. There was a nice balance here with flavour that didn't overpower, gently sweet but nicely balanced malt and bitterness.

The beer remained simple and pure, but grew on me more and more after each sip. Delicately balanced between chocolate, barley malt, nutiness, and with a touch of lactose. Soft coffee (Sumatra) lingered in the back notes and gave some complexity, but never commanding attention. The beer is agressively hopped and take on the grassiness and herbal notes of English hops. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, and as easy to drink as chocolate milk. Mild alcohols never become an issue. The look of the beer certainly fits the bill with it's solid dark brown hue, light haze, and froathy head formation, retention.","BEERchitect","Jun 03, 2008"

The taste definitely highlighted some caramel with the nuttiness in the background, and hops were subtle. The aroma was a one dimensional sensations of caramelly malt, but the taste branched out a bit. I didn't notice that the abv was over 6%, and it definitely drank like it was lower.

The first thing noted in the nose is the earthy and woody (as in the forest, not the material) hops with a backing of honey and brown sugar. Their estery house yeast character is pretty subdued in this one, but allows for some fruitiness to pair up with the other smells. These esters, however, come out a bit more in the flavor along with some dusty cocoa and a backing of the hops. Malt flavor is a bit thin and the hops do what they can.

The aroma is pleasant: a serious molasses and malt nose, mixed with brown sugar, burnt honey, and bitter chocolate. The taste is sweet, and a little chalky. Theres raisins, smoke, and lots of highly-roasted malts that come out in the taste. Very full bodied, with an almost syrupy like mouthfeel. This is one serious brew.

Mouthfeel just feels thinner than I'd hope. Nutty flavors seem to be the most prevalent. Other than that the sweetness almost seems nondescript. The finish is what really killed this beer for me. Kind of a sour acid yeast flavor. Reminded me of some Alesmith beers I had a year ago. I don't know if this is the result of me buying an older beer (where's the dating?) or the yeast strain just gone funky for this batch.

Plentiful carbonation streams float towards the surface. Aromas of deeply roasted brown sugar and caramel pair with a molasses sweetness which has just a faint note of burnt wood. The aromas translate directly into the flavors. The roasty caramel sweetness is present initially and complimented by an ample malt body with a full molasses flavor. There are just enough piney hops in the finish to keep this from becoming cloying, and there is also some dryness from the roasted malt. A bit of brown sugar arrives as the temperature increases. Medium-full body with a firm mouthfeel and fine carbonation, there is a dry smoothness about this. No problems drinking and enjoying this one.","hopsaplenty","Jul 11, 2006"

The flavor opens with sweetish, dark brown toffee and gooey molasses. Creamy on the palate, thicker than your average brown ale. This brew gathers quite a bit of character at room temperature. Nutty and fruity, lots of complexity, reminding me of a chocolate and walnet cookie, with the little bit of doughy yeast presence.

In addition, there was a pronounced smoked flavor that underlined the other flavors. Sweet and malty with added textures and bite; but a bit too bread-like in the finish. Excellent drinkability.

A little strange, but I enjoy the iced tea aftertaste, adds a level of refreshingness on a hot August night. I always love a good brown to quench the thirst.

4.33,12.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Nice deep, somewhat clear dark chestnut brown color with slivers of orangey red. Solid cream colored finger high head of cappuccino froth, retains for a wee bit before fading to a crumbly collar and lace in minimal strings and spots. Aroma has a solid roastyness to it thats close to coffee, but seems more like espresso, not all that strong, a definate moderate presense with an overall dry quality, it also has a little touch of sweet molasses and chocolate in there mixing with a bit of hazelnut and vanilla. Great subtle nose. Taste is semi sweet malts with a slight roastyness mostly coming through at the finish but withholds throughout and within the ride lies some nice subtle notes of vanila and nuts. The roastyness is quite nice, milding and toasty surrounded by a chocolatey cookie dough sweetness. Quite nice. Ends clean and dry with lingering qualities wrapped up in sweet roasted malts and chocolate. Feel is medium bodied with a clean substantiated roastyness thats mild and well rounded with a small dry finish that holds some lingering sweet yet roasty tones. An excellent drinkin' brown, a bit more boldness and fullness within the flavors and this would be supurb stuff. That said, this is still a very nice brown. One I wouldn't turn down for nothing! Big time thanks to Gusler for throwing this in!!","tavernjef","Beers"
3.7,-4.1,4,4,3.5,3,4,"The beer pours as deep a mahogany as you can get without being brown with garnet high lights, the head is pythonic size, the texture spumous with the color a beauteous light than as it transmogrifies the lace forms a thick and sealing sheet upon the glass. Sweet malt dominates the nose, vanilla, hints of caramel and a nut like tone also noticed, start is quite sweet, nice malt presence, top is middling in feel. Finish is mild in carbonation, the hops pleasing and subdued in their spiciness, somewhat dry with a bit of tartness and a long lasting aftertaste, personally would have expected a bit more body overall, not a bad beer, just a tad light in the wrong places for me. Possibly could be a bit flat, will need to get another bottle and sample as I love Bear Republic, Still would make a great session beer.","Gusler","0"
