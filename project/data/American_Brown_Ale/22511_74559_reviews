"Very nice brown, more characteristic of a porter but delicious nonetheless"

"Deep and complex brown ale.  Rich chocolate hits you on first taste as well as in he nose.  A slight citrus hop punch comes through on the back end.  Medium bodied and well balanced.  Not easy to find a better brown ale."

"Sampler in HF line, second sample tasted (after Edward). Lots of dark chocolate on the nose. Not really a lover of Brown but this was very drinkable. I found that after in warmed up a bit the cacao aroma and flavors really came out and for me it was much better."
""
""
"O: Initially was thrown off by more bitterness than I was expecting, but it mellowed out into a nice sweetness. The roast-y chocolate-y flavors give it a bit of a porter feel."
"Smooth all around with a balance struck between malts and hops that provides both equally. Luscious grains with not roast but some chocolate mixes well with citrus and earthy hops."
"Quite dark in colour, crisp hoppiness in aroma and a fantaatic"

"Brown ales are a bit odd. Sometimes they can be stellar, but often they are a bit dull. I feel like this could actually be hoppier, but for what it is, it is very tasty with a solid malt profile. Would drink again!"
"It's a damn good brown ale. Hopped in good measure and definitely an American take on the style."

"Second brown ale of the evening after a long period of avoiding the style. First one was Phil from  Marshall Wharf. This was better, but not by much. Both were thoroughly enjoyable and extremely drinkable. Reminded me a bit of Tootsie Rolls. Light with nice carmely, chocolaty notes."
""
""
"Intense nose of hazelnut. These are back in mouth and give a strong bitter taste. Quickly, aromas of milk chocolate and hops take their place. Bitterness is strong and dry and chocolate taste remains."

"Pours dark brown with a thick tan head. Aroma is unusually pronounced for a brown ale with tons of chocolate supported by roasty grains, dark coffee and just a hint of hops. Taste is mostly roasted chocolate/ semi-dark grains on the front end with a nice hop balance towards the finish. I may be getting hints of oatmeal in the finish as well. The grains are so predominant that some can be picked out (brown malt, dehusked black, medium roast crystal, maybe some toasted oatmeal) and each one presents itself without muddling the others. I used to think HF was all about the IPAs but George makes me realize that Shaun Hill's dark beers should be as highly regarded as any of his other creations. If you like this you will like Everett and vice versa."

"O-One of the better brown Ales I have come across. Lots to talk about with this one. I love getting to try a Brown Ale with some pop to it. Very well made."

"Notes: Bottled 4/9/14 at HF and consumed on the suggested drink by date of 4/17/14. Poured into a HF 2L growler."
"O. Overall Hill does it again, as someone who does not tend to like many browns i do enjoy this beer. Is it blowing me away, no. but is it a true brown ale that has very solid characteristics, absolutely. I would go as far as to say its the best Brown ale i have had yet to date."
"Dark brown pour with head gradually reducing to fine lacing. Roasty malts, coffee and a touch of chocolate. The flavors are a bit watered down. The mouthfeel is thin but oily with smooth, creamy active carbonation. Quaffable. I'm keeping this short because this is a nice brown ale but not great."
"o: Not sure where the soapy note came from, possibly the tap line or the glass. Otherwise, not as tasty as Everett but with more substance."

"This is truly a brown ale. Probably the best brown ale I'll ever taste, but at the end of the day it is a brown ale. Based off the description, I was hoping this would be a hop forward version, but it's very true to style. Nutty malt dominated the flavor, and the hops round everything out. Hazy brown in appearance, with cascading bubbles rising to the surface. About a finger of fluffy white head when poured and the mouth feel, with the amount of carb in this beer, really helped to push the flavor. Smelled like every other brown ale. Not a huge fan of this style, but based off of all the brown ales I've had, this was by far the best tasting."

"O. Simple, but simply perfectly done. It doesn't excite me but it nails the style down nicely."
""
"Overall- It's a very good brown ale. The style is nothing super special or variable, and this is no exception. No need to take a trip to the moon to get this beer, but if it happens to be available when you want a brown ale, then it's definitely a good one to drink."

"Pour is dark brown with a light tan head. Nose is heavily roasted malt with notes of roasted coffee, hint of vanilla, dark chalky malts. Taste is a touch less roasty, more malt richness with some fudge and a hint of vanilla, fairly clean and no sugars left over. Rich body, not heavy, nice carb, great feel."

"Had this on tap at Blackback Pub, was just ok compared to the other HF brews, great still... was an hard to judge this coming off such great brews. Besides its super fresh and classic great body, nothing jumped out to me. Ironically, had i had this amongst other(non HF) brews it would of probably been mind blowing"

"O - Smell and taste were a little underwhelming, but mouthfeel was very nice. Tried it because I was at the brewery and the opportunity presented itself."
""
""
""
"The beer is mahogany with a small, bubbly, beige head. The aroma offers dank hops and brown bread rolled together as one, caramel malt, sweet chewy candies. The flavor follows suit. Well balanced and flavorful, with caramel and toffee tones. Highly drinkable. A solid example of the style."
""
""

""
""
"Growler. Pours a brown with beige head. Very aromatic brown ale. I get decadent nuts and burnt toast with some light earthy hops. Taste is a nice showcase of malts with nuts and caramel. Some light bitterness. Palate is on the lgiht side. Very well executed brown ale and as good as it can be for me. I do prefer Shaun hoppy offerinf by a mile though"

"O - Solid and awesome, and I'm not a huge brown ale fan. Great brown ale flavors and good hops that don't detract. Go HF Go. 4.25"
"Decadent but drinkable. One of the finest beers I have ever had. Worth searching high and low for."

"I enjoyed the nutty sweetness but could do without bitterness."

"A very rich and satisfying Brown Ale, though not like one that I've ever tasted before. Definitely worth a try, quite interesting and unique."
""
""
""

"I'm actually a huge fan of brown ales in general. However, I have a strong preference towards robust browns that are less roasty with a bigger malt presence. George delivers on all fronts here. Its sweet and not too bitter, with a light feel that is, at the same time, full and very smooth. This is certainly a top tier brown!"
""
""

""
""
"O- a nice brown ale with good flavor, good balance"
"On tap at The Prohibition Pig. Pours a dark brown, almost black color with an inch of frothy head. A lot going on in the nose. Malts, bread, earth, nuts, and brown sugar. Hints of booze. The taste is of malts upfront with earth and brown sugar. Nutty with a slight citrus hop bitterness at the end. Creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a really good Brown ALe worth having again."
""
""
"Overall - Quality beer as always. Nothing out of the ordinary but an excellent brown."
"Medium body, well carbonated, chewy and sticky on the tongue. A well-executed hopped up brown ale - yes, please."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A solid brown ale. The hops mesh well with the base flavors, allowing it to still be drinkable while still having lots of flavor. Great to revisit this one after a few years."
""
""
"O~ very all around well balanced brown. if you're in the mood for a brown you really can't go wrong here!"
""
""
""
""
"Ultimately, this is a luscious beer with a very vague style bale slapped on it, which doesn't do it justice."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a creamy head. Head persists nicely and some lacing present. Aroma is dark malts but nice. Flavor is great with chocolate upfront along with a good mix of malts. On the back it has a peppery spice. Sweet yet somewhat dry. A really nicely balanced beer."
""
""
"o - Overall not my favorite HF beer and not my favorite style, but a good brown ale. Easy to drink and lots of roasted and toasted nuts. Would have it again and would be a great brown ale for people getting into craft beers, but wouldn't strain myself to seek it out like I would most of their other beers."

"O-Wow. A great, well rounded Brown Ale. Great flavors and it has the tad bit of bitterness in the finish to make it a great beer."
""
"O: At first I was unimpressed. As the beer warms, it develops more character in the nose & flavor. I definitely enjoyed it but it didn't blow me away or stand out above the rest of the beers of this style. But that's one of the issues with popular/delicious breweries like HF...expectations are always high going in so when one doesn't meet the high standards, it disappoints. I am trying to be as objective as possible and put all assumptions aside. Great beer."
"Overall: Probably the first brown ale I've ever enjoyed."
"Pours a clear brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, roasted nuts, and some hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a nice nutty finish and a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a solid dark brown, black color with a decent sized off white head that persists forever. Smells of caramel and chocolate malts a healthy shot of earthy citrus and pine to provide some balance. The flavor follows the aroma, sweet caramel, bread and chocolate maltiness with a solid shot of citrus and earthy hop flavor. Light hop bitterness provides nice balance. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a creamy grainy mouthfeel. This is a damn fine brown ale right here. Its tough to get a great brown ale because the style is a bit on the boring side, but this is an exceptional example."

"George is easily the most underrated HF brew. Arguably the best brown ale I've ever had, and I want more."

"O- This was a very tasty brown ale and definitely a good representation of the style, but for a HF beer it wasn't anything spectacular. It definitely had a nice roasted malt and slight coffee presence with a high drinkability. I enjoyed drinking this and would definitely drink it again. I would recommend trying it but not going out of your way to get it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with an odd medicinal feel and weird combination of sweet and roasted malt, spice and citrusy hops.  Hints of licorice, anise, sweet chocolate and vinous dark fruit. Finished slightly bitter with citrusy hops and a lingering unpleasant aftertaste."
""
""
"Overall a superior brown ale. Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
"George is brown, like the style would suggest. He's acually veering towards black with a silky liquid look. A nice puff of tannish/brown foam up top leaving some. Smell is rich with a nice toasted malt base and there is a blast of fresh hops. Some sweet scents with brown sugar and a hint of smoke. Bread with warming. This is quite full of flavor, normal browns don't get this involved. Tastes of roasty/toasty malt with a hit of citrus hops, surrounded by some nuts, smoke, brown sugar and some earthy flavors. I like the body on this, it's richer and fuller than most browns. Nicely carbed, not dead in any way with a full aftertaste that does not linger to long. A nice drinkable brown ale that is good for two glasses or so, not boring."
"This is one of the best Brown Ales I've ever had. I'm going to look for more of their beers."
""
""
""
"A tasty brown ale that improves in flavor as it warms."
"Poured a murky chestnut brown with a decent off-white head that left a bit of soapy lacing. Aroma of nuts, grains and tea-like herbs. Nuts and brown sugar in the taste, roast and bitter cocoa, pine and herbal hops, grassy, with a bit of a wet cardboard sensation that isn't too out of place for the style in general. Better than many brown ales I've had. Medium body, a bit chalky, but still decent overall."
"HF never stops proving they are a superb brewing co and a force to be reckoned with. Get it if you see it...do not hesitate."
""
"Pours a dark, but not opaqure, dark brown shade with a thin head. The nose is just...absent. Maybe my sniffer is operating under less than full capacity, but I don'g get anything at all. Very muted nose indeed. I don't know what it is I'm tasting, but I'm not digging it at all. Very roasty with some dark fruit going on. Figs, plub, cherries. A bit smoky. Yeah, not my bag. The mouthfeel is the bright point here. Smooth, highly carbed, with a slightly bitter finish. Overally, this is a rare miss for HF where I'm concerned. I just didn't think this came together very well."
""
""
"One of the most interesting brown ales that I have had the chance to try, and I am very glad that I did. Hill Farmstead hits a delicate balance of an over-bittered brown ale that didn't just turn into a dark IPA, and their ability to infuse the citrus with the coffee and raisin bread character of the beer is nothing short of masterful."
"O: Of the few ABAs that I've had AND thoroughly enjoyed, George is easily the best. Something about that hop schedule puts it in another league."
""
"Slightly creamy mouthfeel. Overall quite nice although not as lively as some other examples of the style."
"I have a soft spot for this style so usually overlooked. Not too chocolatey or too much in the direction of a porter, George is a solid brown ale and is right up there with Russian River if a bit more aggressive."
""
"O - Don't get me wrong, this is described as a hoppy brown, but it's even a larger dose of Columbus then I was expecting. Hey, I like hoppy beers, but I like my brown ales to have more of a malty sweetness and less hop-focused."
""
"D - The combination of brown ale and Columbus hops just doesn't work for me, and this is by far the least enjoyable beer I've had from Hill Farmstead. The flavor profile is exactly what you'd expect from the description, but the concept seems problematic. Oh well, even Mozart wrote the occasional bad piece - perhaps this beer would pair nicely with the Flute & Harp Concerto K. 299."
""
"This beer pours a nice brown color with a decent amount of light making it's way through. There is a nice light tan head on topmtha fades rather slowly. The smell is earthy floral hops up front with a nice roasted and sweet malt finish. The flavor is pretty similar to the smell with there being a bit more than expected hop profile. The malts come about a bit more as the beer warms up. The mouthfeel on this beer is medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall this beer is refreshing and very drinkable. Shaun said the next batch has had the hops toned down a bit, can't wait to try it."
""
"O - So far, this is my least favourite Hill Farmstead to date. That being said, this is still a great brown ale. Just, perhaps I hold Hill Farmstead to such a high bar that this just falls short for me."
"Pours a clear, dark mahogany with ruby tinged color with a massive frothy cream colored head. Finger thick bubbly head throughout with thin sticky sheets of lacing. Pleasant aroma of brown sugar, molasses, roast malt, earthy hops and light coffee. Strong roast malt flavor in the body with brown sugar and cocoa but the sweetness is well balanced by pine and grassy hops. Dry and bitter finish with a silky light medium body and soft carbonation. A brown ale is a brown ale is a brown ale (generally), but I enjoyed this compared to most and thought the mild bitterness of the hops added a unique turn to this."
""
""
""
"Overall nice, hoppier than expected, tasty though"
"Brown Ales are not among my favorite style, but this is clearly a great representation of the style and one I enjoy. Really happy I had the opportunity to try this. Marc, thanks for sending this along."
"Overall I'm happy I was able to try this beer, especially given its limited status at this point. I'm not generally a huge fan of this genre - brown bitters."
"o - solid brown ale. comes with a bitter blast that is a bit counter to the seemingly great brown ale beneath. if you are a fan of bitterness you will probably love this one."
