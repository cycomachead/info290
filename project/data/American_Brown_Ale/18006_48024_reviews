"Overall: decent brown ale, nothing shines here though I wish there was more hop flavor and aroma. But even the malt flavor was a bit one note."

" serving type: 16 ounces can."

"If I were to sum this beer up, I would probably call it an imperial ESB. It's extremely well balanced and just overall very enjoyable, without being overly complex."

"A clear reddish brown with a thin tan head. Smells of lightly toasted grain. Taste begins with a hint of tart fruit, then some dark bread, and finishing with a flowery bitter finish. Mouth feel is pretty good. Overall a solid brown ale. A nice balance between bitterness and sweetness."
"O) A very good Nut Brown, very English can't wait to have with Fish and Chips."

"Overall: I really like what this beer has going for it in how unusual it is It's definitely an odd mixture of a pilsener and a piney stout in the form of a brown ale. My complaint would be that there is no one thing that really stands out."

"Pours nice. Good nose. Nice flavor profile on this one. Consistent and thorough. I like it. Always refreshing to come across a brown ale that's done right. Suggested."

"Can from Oak Tree, A nice brown, with a little touch of sour finish. Above average mouthfeel. Light brown colour, nicely hoppy.Malty aroma.very good drinkability although not a style I would keep a six pack in the fridge. Toasted malt, and caramel. A tad syrupy."

"O: Brown Ales typically bore me, but Over Ale grabbed my taste buds and had me wanting more. Very sessionable and still complex."
""
""
"I didn't expect a hoppy Brown Ale, but that's what I got. The hop profile is similar to Daisy Cutter and Gossamer, but the hop/malt bill is more balanced and roasty. Nice!"
""
""
"Overall it's not bad, but neither is it great. Its aggressive hop component is not really backed up, leaving it slightly out of balance; but more importantly, it disappoints in that it lacks in complexity."
"This beer poured out as a clear brown color with a very fluffy looking tan head on top. The retention and lacing is decent. The smell of the beer is lightly toasted, sort of sweet and has some fresh grain aromas. The taste of the beer is similar to the nose. The sweetness fades into the toasted finish with a subtle bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and lighter bodied. Overall it's a pretty solid brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good well made easy drinking beer."
""
"Overall (3.75/5): Over Ale is a quality, well-crafted American Brown Ale that features all sorts of good malty flavors, a nice kicked-up hop bite, and a dryness that I personally find very nice. Over Ale won't knock your socks off, but it's a nice departure from the IPAs and Pale Ales and Imperial Stouts. A good representation of the style and a good buy, just don't expect anything super adventurous."

"16 ounce can into pint glass, no canning date. Pours lightly hazy reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, toast, brown sugar, nuttiness, light roast, brown bread, slight pine, and floral hops. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of chocolate, caramel, toast, nuttiness, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, light pine, and earthy floral hops. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toast, light roast, brown bread, brown sugar, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance, robustness, and complexity; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice brown ale! Very nice balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"O-A solid Brown Ale, nothing out of the ordinary, just a good beer."
""
"O: I had no trouble crushing a couple of cans of this. Nice beer!"
""
""
"o - good beer, but nothing really stands out for me. would certainly buy it again if i came across it."
"Overall this is one of my favorite examples of a style that I'm not that fond of. This would be a wonderful match with much of American cuisine."
""
""
""
"A dark brown color with golden edges and a very strong single finger head that's off white and leaves very healthy lacing. The aroma is a solid caramel malt with a mellow grass hop. A bit of brown bread and molasses, not bad. The flavor presents a straight ahead charcoal brown bread with evergreen grass hop highlights. There's a subtle touch of milk chocolate and muted sour dough. This stuff is medium bodied but it's very effervescent with tiny bubble carbonation for a full, foamy feel that finishes just a tad dry. Very decent brown ale."
""
""
""
"(O)- Overall, a solid brown ale. Easy drinking with classic flavors that are melded together nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- good brown with nice flavors and aromas."
""
""
"O: Overall a good beer, but nothing extraordinary. Many newer American Brown Ales are far to hop heavy. While there are good examples of hoppy brown ales out there, this one is more malt focused. Its strongest characteristic is the balance between malt and hops."
""
""
""
""
"It's a pretty standard brown ale and user friendly coming from Half Acre, but nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable. A nice and somewhat-unique flavor that is nice when you want a lighter brown ale."
""
" This is a very nice brown which has some interestig malt flavor which I would describe mainly as biscuit, however there is a subtle spice and pine ting from the hops which adds some depth. The yeast is mainly clean, but adds a little bit of dried fruit to the mix with nice sweetness from the malt keeping it focused. I found this to be a very good American brown ale, not the best of the style, but very solid and a great balance is achieved which makes for a drinkable somewhat stronger ale."
"The Crack & Glug initially netted me better than two fingers' worth of thick, mocha-tan head with great retention. Color was a deep-copper/light-brown with NE-quality clarity. Nose marked it as most definitely being a Brown Ale. it had a very brown sugary malt sweetness to it. Mouthfeel was medium, but it was not as sweet in the mouth as the nose had suggested. Instead, it had a minty hops quality accompanying the chocolate and biscuit malt flavor, adding up to the liquid equivalent of a Girl Scout Thin Mint cookie. Yum! Finish was very minty and not at all what I had thought that it would be. Also, great sticky lacing throughout."
""
"O: Really nice everyday beer. Can get super fresh from brewery for $2 a can, convenient and nice. Perfect for every occasion, just enough hops to satisfy hop heads (as any Half Acre fan is!) and just enough balance to satisfy everyone else!"
""
""
""
""
"Half Acre Over Ale pours a deep chestnut brown, with some orange highlights when held to light. Three fingers or so of cream colored foam rise up to top the beer. Head retention is fairly good, most of it fades away over five or so minutes, but the last bits of foam stick around for a long time. Lacing is left in a nice webbed pattern. The nose is solid, if unspectacular, lots of lightly toasted nuts and crisp biscuits. The flavor leads off with those same two malty notes. Next comes a lighty firm bit of bitterness (yup, definitely an American take on a Brown Ale), along with some earthy and light grapefruit hoppy notes. The slightly dry chocolate that comes in for the close is what takes this beer to the next level. The body is just a little light for the style, which in turn helps the carbonation come off as a little more active than it probably needs to. While it's not quite perfect, Half Acre Over Ale's still a pretty darn enjoyable American Brown Ale."
"Poured from can into my Brooklyn snifter. Pour resembles a darker brown version of dirty rainwater. Not a lot of head, not a great looking beer. Smell- nice. Sweet bisquit malt, some caramel and toffee. What you would expect for the style. Sweet tobacco. Taste- sweet malt, toffee, some mild hop bitterness, maple, tea leaves. Sweetness coats all flavors, really liking this one a lot. Better than I expected. Mouthfeel is nice, this is a really drinkable beer overall. I would have it again."

"M: nice, well-balanced beer, easy drinking"
""
"O -- A nice take on the style. Not overpowering in any of the usual suspects of character traits you expect in an American Brown, plus a good dose of that toffee character you usually only get in English beers. A nice drinker."
"O: A pretty good hopped up brown ale. Very smooth and drinkable."
""
"This is a well-crafted brown with nothing standing out but it's really drinkable."
""
"O: This is a very good beer. It is easy to drink and very flavorful. Just a solid all around beer."
""
"Medium body, well carbonated, a bit chewy and sticky on the tongue. Drinks nice - a well balanced brown ale with a pleasant, yet subtle hop flavor."
""
""
"3.0 D: Tasty beer. I'm always happy to drink a new brown ale. This one seems to be a little rough around the edges though."
"Pours a transparent but lightly clouded brown, decent cap of off-white froth, little retention. Scent leads with roasted nuts and rustic bread, moderate hope profile brings citrus, light sweetness. Taste brings components of scent together, the malt backbone is nutty and bready, could use a bit more heft. Juicy hops give the beer some edge. Medium bodied, moderately dry. Decent brown ale all around, good flavor but malt bill could have been upped slightly."
""
""
"overall an interesting brown ale. nothing special, but very solid."
""
"Overall: A decent brew just too bready for my taste. Maybe if it was less bready and more hoppy or citrus. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's pretty good, not spectacular but easily drinkable."
""
""
"Overall, a nice session ale. Plenty of complexity to keep things interesting. A winner."
""
""
"Tastes not quite as good as a smells. Starts with nutty bread dough, moves into sugared chestnuts blended with citrusy hops, and then it gets a tiny bit weird, with big nodes of boiled veggies like I'm drinking old school Rolling Rock. The veggies linger, surprisingly pleasantly, but they override most of the nice sweet barley that probably would do a better job of balancing out the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very drinkable and a decent example of the style; not something I am likely to seek out again"
""
"Trying the Half Acre Over Ale tonight and it is tasty tasty!!!! The appearance is great a deep rich brownish clear amber with off white head that is lacing!!!! The smell includes molassis malts and hints of roast and perhaps noble hops. The taste is a slightly nutty and molassis sweetness which is very drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium to light in boday with good carbonation. Overall this is a good brown ale!"
"A nice hoppy brown ale. What I like about it is the hops don't dominate the malt, they add a nice bite to it. The only thing I would change is the lingering bitterness on the end, but I think I can deal with it. Overall, a nice drinkable beer that could be enjoyed on a warm summer day or cold winter night."
"D/O: This robust ale from the Half Acre stable bears little relation to their Daisy Cutter pale ale; relatively challenging on the palate, but only compared to that other beer's universal approachability. The smell resembles some other American brown ales, such as Sierra Nevada's Tumbler, but is more satisfying. It almost begs for other strong and savory flavors to complement, making it food-friendly but likely to induce some palate fatigue when taken by itself."
""
"One pint can served in tumbler glass. Pours a clear ruby color with a small, fizzy, light-brown head, good lacing. Aroma is caramel, roasted and toasted malts, smoke, and a small amount of earthy hops. Flavor is caramel malts, wood, nutty, and grassy hops. Mouthfeel is medium to light, dry, and just a touch of bitterness at the finish. Decent beer, nothing special but drinkable."

"Beer is medium to light in body, finishes like a really mild coffee, a very decent little ale here. Mildly sweet up front. Nice finish, not too dry, a well connected a decent little beer. Nothing too special but definitely solid."
""
"I enjoyed this, I like the hoppier style of brown, and I especially liked its not just a brown ale hopped up with a bunch of west coast citrus hops, its hoppy but in a more nontraditional way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Appearance is a translucent mahogany with a healthy head upon pour. Aroma is that of grassy floral hops with a caramel backing. Taste Is malty with notes of grassy hops. Mouthful is sweet with a medium resinous body, leaves an almost sticky mouthfeel. Overall a good canned beer, would be good in the heat. Thanks again gcurlow."
"Cheers!"
"D - Probably the best brown ale beer I've ever had; compliments dark fruits; would go great with a meal, nice and light body but full of character"
"Overall: A damn fine take on the style. It's not quite Surly Bender, but it's got to be cheaper and that goes a long way. Super easy to drink and a nice can of deliciously crafted malts. Well-balanced and well worth seeking out."
"O: In case it wasn't obvious, I'm wholly uninspired by this beer. While it is by no means *bad* I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anybody either. Definitely not the best Half Acre has to offer."
"O: Drinkable, but it didn't really blow me away. A decent beer."
"o - Overall a pretty good brown ale. Very easy to drink and some standard toasted malts and nuts. Would give it another shot."
"This is a tasty and drinkable brown ale. It's deceivingly light at first, but quite flavorful in the end. I could drink a few of these."
"O: Overall this is a really nice brown, good strong character, but still holding on to a light drinkablity."
"O- A unique and tasty take on the style."
"Mouthfeel - medium bodied with a refreshing spike of carbonation."
"Overall: Very nice bitter to sip with a meal, with just the right amount of hop character to balance out the malt bill."
"O - This was quite good. The can provided little description of the ale within but it was a very tasty brown ale."
"Drink- This is a very tasty brown ale. I have only had Surly out of the can and this is right up there as well."
"can't recall having any other brown ales in the can (besides surly bender, which i don't like very much), so this one is setting a gold standard of sorts. very good depth of flavor while maintaining drinkability. roasty and nutty without being excessively dry or ashy. tight carbonation. if i lived in the greater chicago area, this would be a go-to fall beer for me. i wish it had a touch more body, but the drinkability would then suffer."
"The beer has mid-weight heft that seems to work well with the flavors. This is an easy drinking, tasty brown. Well done!"
"Light bodied and well carbonated. Fairly good session beer."
"Overall: A nice, easy drinking brown ale. Smooth and well balanced and I would be happy to have another."
"Toasted malts and herbal hops up front. Sweetish caramel and toffee malts fill in. Herbal, slightly grassy hop bitterness along with some nuttiness. Some milk chocolate and earthy tobacco near the finish. Lingering sweet caramel malt and slightly roasty bitterness. Medium-bodied, with a slightly creamy feel. Pretty tasty!"
"D - This batch seems to be more true to the ESB roots of this beer, as I found it more bitter and dry than a typical American Brown Ale and without the occasionally cloying chocolate sweetness found in that style. Not as session-friendly as Half Acre's other year-round offerings, but a nice beer for those not really into hops (god forbid). I'd prefer Meat Wave, but this is still pretty solid."
"o - at first, it seemed like I was in for a treat, but the bitterness, which isn't too in your face mind you, spoiled this one for me a bit. then I got over it and it was a decent brown ale. nothing crazy, but not bad."
"O - I really enjoy drinking this brown ale but in the flavor profile, specifically the nose, I'm not getting much. Enjoyed this one but not something I'd seek again."
"Pours a clean amber-ish to brown color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet gingerbread like malt, some small hop presence in there too. In the taste, small orange citrus, mostly a lighter roast of grain and some gingerbread like malt. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry grapefruity citrus in the aftertaste. At first I was like eh, but it grew on me. Nice mellow hops, quite enjoyable."
"Poured a dark brown with red undertones and a nice tan head, the nose is characterized by earthy malts with a little bit of--tea? It's weak overall. The taste is malt heavy, a little bit of smoke, a little bit of nutty character, some lemon/citrus hops. It's actually a surprisingly complex taste but I'm not sure how well it all fits together. Mouthfeel slightly watery, and so overall it's a good beer, but not a great one. Would stick with the other Half Acre offerings."
"This pours medium brown with red peeking through held up to a light, a one finger cream head that dissipates, and only a hint of lace. On the nose there is a mix of caramel and roasted malts with a good dash of earthy hops. The piney hop presence is more like dead pine needles in the fall rather than resiny pine. In the mouth there is a good balance between the earthy hops, but perhaps the malts stick a bit too far forward and get a little too sticky to me. The body is medium, carbonation perfect for the style, and the finish is nicely medium length with the good balance lingering. Overall, this isn't my favorite brown ale, and certainly not my favorite from Half Acre, but if this is as bad as it gets for them then they've got a great brewery."
"D: A good bitter brown, I like this."
"Overall a very good sessionable beer. Nothing aggressive."
"Overall (2.5): Not much to it, and pretty watery. Surprisingly 6% as it tastes moe like 4%."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium to high, prickly carbonation."
"O - Worth the buy. I've enjoyed pretty much whatever I've had from Half Acre and was happy to stumble across this one..."
"I know this might be crazy to say, but I think I enjoy it even more than Daisy Cutter. DEAL WITH IT."
"D: really solid and refreshing beer that I am truly enjoying."
"Overall it is not a beer I would seek out again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a very enjoyable brown ale, definitely hoppier then most, but it worked well for it. Very enjoyable and easy drinking beer, wit ha lot of flavor. Another very solid beer form Half Acre."
"Overall - Pretty good, easy to drink. Half Acre continues to impress."
"Drinkability: Good, would definitely recommend and drink again."
"O: For a brown, I can genuinely say I liked this one. Did I love It? No, but I'd certainly drink it again if offered. Half Acre's Over Ale is a good, everyday ""drinking"" beer. It's not overly complex, it's simply a nice can of suds."
"A good representation of a fresh Brown Ale. Nicely done by Half Acre. Good beer from a very good brewer."
"And by dangerous, I mean I could drink pint after pint after pint."
"D- Really good stuff. Easy as hell to drink."
"Thin, yet flavorful pale brown malts glide across the top of the palate and add notes of sweetbread and caramel. A tinge of piny hops, English yeast, and light booze esters ride out into the finish. Mouthfeel is appropriate for the style with a crisp carbonation level and medium-light body. Drinks easily and doesn't dry out the tongue too much. Over Ale: a sessionable, drinkable brown ale in a can. No frills, no shenanigans, just tasty beer."
"Suggestion: Be sure to buy two packs, as the first will disappear rather quickly."
"D: this is a well balanced brown ale with lots of character. This is yet another example of Half Acre putting their own spin on a classic style. Not mind blowing by any means, but certainly worth a try...or a session."
"Conclusion: It was good, nothing aggressive. For the most part it was a tad above average for a brown ale. This had a rounded flavor that was enjoyable."
"Malt forward flavors, again earthy and bready with some apple from the yeast. Some light toast and bitter tobacco. Residual hop bitterness in the aftertaste, fairly light. Bready and crisp like autumn leaves. Easygoing carbonation that lends a bit of bite, a fine local session ale."
"I was actually pretty impressed and can definitely recommend another few rounds."
"The mouthfeel is way to watery thin for my tastes. It would be a good staple beer that I would keep in stock if it just had a little more body and some more carbonation to keep it lively. It still is greatly drinkable though and even though and I had no problem killing a growler by myself over a few hours time."
"a big fan of Daisy Cutter Pale Ale."
"D - Very drinkable. The second bottle was better as my tastebuds adjusted. But it was a nice drinkable beer. I would buy it again."
"Just purchased a half barrel from the brewery this fine evening for my kegarator. This stuff is dangerously drinkable - just finished my first pint and heading back for number 2 in quick order. Very solid brown ale in my opinion. The alcohol is not terribly noticeable and I'm suspecting that it will sneak up on me in quick order if i'm not careful. Although I intended to pick up a half barrel of daisy cutter, i don't regret this for a second. Very tasty and worth the drive from the south suburbs up to half acre for a fresh keg (dated 11/13/2010) of Over Ale. Just in time for Thanksgiving - and believe me when I say I'm thankful."
"The last of the Three Growlers from our Half Acre tour trip. It pours a clear dark sunset amber topped by finger of thick creamy foam. The nose comprises pine, grapefruit, grass, and some light biscuit. The taste holds notes of green tea, melon, cucumber, grasses, and very light biscuit. The hoppier notes seem to strangely overpower the very meek malts for me. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a feel that migrates from fluid to dry. Overall, an okay brew, but a bit unbalanced and grassy for my tastes."
"I've had this before at the brewery and loved it so I figured now was a good time to review it. This pours a nice rosewood color with a good pillow head on the top that is well retained with beautiful lacing down the glass. The aroma is both of nice fresh hop and some caramel malts. There are some roasty and nutty smells in the background as well. The flavors are a nice balance of malts and hops. The hop flavors are akin to some nice orange zest. There are bitter flavors, but they are in the background of the nice roasted caramel and butterscotch flavors. This beer is very well carbonated and aside from bitter notes which are appropriate it was a very smooth beer. This was really easy to drink, it pairs well with most foods and is a definite recommendation from me."
"Draft. Pours a reddish copper color with a 1 finger off white head. SLight roasted malt flavor. Very simple, straight forward, and clean flavor. Slighlty sweet up front with a nice balance of subtle hops. Slight caramel flavor. Medium mouthfeel. A pretty moderate ESB."
"D - Very enjoyable, very very drinkable. This is perfect ballgame brew."
"All and all, a great beer, though maybe not an ESB. I can't vouch for bottles or old kegs, but fresh on tap at the brewery, this is a winner."
"D-delicious. moving on to a 2nd. very drinkable right now."
"D: Pretty damn enjoyable. Make sure to let this get around cellar temp before pouring. It really opens up when it warms."
"Drinkability? I could kick back 2 or 3 of these within a reasonable time and be a happy camper. I think this is an excellent example of the style and kudos go out to Half Acre Brewing and...Jeff!"
"Overall, this is an above average brown ale, not sure how its an esb."
"D - Pretty easy to drink and do a lot of, just a touch sweet to session most likely."
"D-Easy drinking, nice beer that I wouldn't mind having again. I'm guessing my previous review of this was possibly from an old bottle. I will try another bottle and edit my other review accordingly if need be."
"D: Over Ale is an easy drinkin' brew from an up-and-coming brewery, one that I like very much (and is also a block from my house). I'm truly enjoying this- very sessionable at 6%. This beer is also an excellent match for the spicy lasagna. The smooth, creamy mouthfeel is a nice extension of the creamy mozzarella, ricotta and goat cheese in the meal while the caramel and toasty flavors do a good job of balancing out the spice in the hot Italian sausage. The minty/spicy hops, although mild, also kick up the spice while the malt works to balance it out- it's a wonderful little tug-o-war going on."
"Overall- This is a tasty brew! A bit more than expected out of an ESB, but tasty nonetheless. A great beer for when you are feeling like you want a little more than your typical lawnmower beer can offer, but you dont want to be overwhelmed. This is a nice rich, complex, malty brew with an excellent complimentary hop balance. It offers a lot of complexity, but is ridiculously drinkable and makes one heck of a good session brew. One of my local favorites!"
"I had this on tap and I'm looking forward to trying this again fresh from a bottle."
"This is a a beer I'll buy from time to time to support local beer. I wish HABC would bottle some other things instead of this, but it's a nice malty beer. I will continue to pick it up until they start putting a few other things out there."
"D: its no suprise why this sixer disappeared so quickly, a very tasty beer."
"D: Very drinkable. Flavors are a bit muted, but I like the bitter finish."
"D - Easy drinking, neither too complex nor too simple."
"Poured with a full head that went flat quickly, a nice dark brown color promising warmth which I need right now. The smell was all biscuit for me and this came through in the taste too. The biscuit taste was balanced by some spice on the end that evened things out and made this a very drinkable beer on a cold day. The mouthfeel similar to a lot of English bitters left my mouth dry. So I drank more!"
"Pours a reddish, medium brownish, ckear ambe with a nice two finger head to start. No bubbling though. The smell has slightly sweet caramel and bready toasted malts while the hops adda little orange spice to each sniff. The taste is equally balanced with great, touch of sweetness malts and full of bread and biscuits. Then the hops bitter and spice things up to even out the malts a little. Super session ale right here! A little grainy and bubbly on the palate. Just a nice English style ESB."
"D - Moderately drinkable - flavors are not overwhelming, no palette fatigue. ABV is not stated, unknown - hard to judge but a esb shouldn't knock my socks off. This one hasn't so far."
"Half Acre Over Ale poured brown/red with nice lacing and good sized white head. Smell was super citrusy hops. Taste was of dark berries, hints of sweetness, good sweetness, hints of chocolate. Mouthfeel was ok. Drinkability was good. This was a good beer. Very interesting flavors, good hops, and nice sweetness. I enjoyed this beer a great deal, and will buy this beer again."
"D: A solid ESB, but not a great one. A nice, fresh offering for the locals."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and fairly smooth, but a bit thin."
"I will definitely be buying more of this!"
"D: It just didn't deliver like I think it could. The malt profile was a bit weak and at times it had a slight watery taste to it. The hop profile got the better of the malt. Generally though, a nice brew. I'd be happy to drink it again. You could definitely down a few of these. I'd like to try it on-tap."
"I'm quite impressed with this beer. Its solid, well built, and damn tasty. Half Acre is a welcome addition to the Chicago beer scene and I plan on drinking plenty more of these! La Chaim!"
"D - This is a session brew of the first order."
"D - A solid session beer on the maltier side of esb's."
"D- I think the beer should be in the low A level, while it's a great beer, it lacks ultimately unique qualities that many other micro's maintain. I like this beer alot and will continue to purchase it."
"Very good. I like this one better than the Half Acre Lager, the flagship brew. This one on tap is hoppier than the bottle version to me, same as the lager. Go figure. I love hops, believe me, but both half acre brews, for my personal taste, could be, not less hoppy, but more malty for balance. Still good, though."
"This is a fine brew by a new Chicago Brewery and I wish them much success."
"Drinkability: A very sessionable brew but for the price there are plenty with stronger flavors."
"A fairly robust beer that is simple in taste--the varieties of barley overpower the hops flavor, which is nice, but makes me only want to drink one or two at a sitting. I didn't detect any fruitiness, and the smell was on par with the taste--the essence of simplicity unfettered by all the extra additions that abound in so many craft beers"
"Pours a nice clear amber with medium lasting beige head. Smell is kind of fruity and malty with a nuttiness too. Mild, but nice. Taste is biscuity, dusty, and fruity, with a bit of nutty flavor as well. Balanced, and what I'd expect flavorwise in the style, and very drinkable. Medium bodied and good carbonation. I thought it was pretty nice and a very drinkable sessionable beer."
