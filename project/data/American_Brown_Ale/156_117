Bit more going on with the taste as there is a hint of maple and cocoa also. Very smooth and goes down easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste. Medium-bodied though a bit thin. Lower carbonation. Overall a tasty brown ale.","BeerWithMike","Mar 02, 2015"

A little bit of a nutty flavor from the malt along with the maple flavor. A good nut ale. The mouth feel was light and the beer itself didn't weigh me down like some nut ales do, is a good summer nut ale.","Entropy501","Jun 30, 2013"

It's a slightly above average nut brown ale with some characteristics of maple syrup. If that's your bag, definitely try it out. And considering I'm having this beer a month past its drink-by date, it could only (at least) be slightly better fresh. At a measly 20 IBUs, this could be a great beer for somebody that doesn't like to drink anything other than Bud Light because they think it all just tastes ""bitter.""","Alextricity","Apr 30, 2013"

3.12,-8.5,3.5,3.25,3,3.25,3,"Revisiting some Tommyknocker brown-ness now that they've apparently infiltrated the Chicagoland market. This one pours a clear sunrise garnet topped by a finger of relatively short-lived glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises toasted caramel, light cashew (a hallmark of Tommyknocker, it seems), and a pinch of chocolate powder. Things are restrained, as though they don't really wanna be here, but their parents made them. It's character-building, of course. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some maple syrup, some vague and mild fruit tones pervading the background, and an even vaguer sense of mixed greens throughout. This would usually be a decent enough combination, but here the flavors don't meld well, they bicker and argue over who's gonna kill who, with nothing ever getting done in the end, much less anything truly tasty. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wetly fluid feel. Overall, an okay brown, but the flavors just don't work together, and things run a bit too thinly for their own good.","TMoney2591","Feb 20, 2013"

However, the flavor does indeed start out with a light amount of the maple syrup sweetness that was not detected on the nose and progresses through stages of murky nutty and toasted malt, but overall the flavors are ill-defined and not quite as well amplified as the imperial version of this brew is. Body is on the thinner side of medium and carbonation is just a tad sluggish for my tastes. Overall you can really tell that this is better passed up for the much better imperial version of the same thing.

Pours slightly hazy reddish brown color with a good 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toasted malt, biscuit, light chocolate, roasted nut, and maple syrup. Some decent aromas that are on the weak side. Taste of toasted malt, caramel, maple, roasted nut, and a touch of herbal hops. A surprising lack of flavor here, but it isn’t offensive. Really dry finish; but some lingering notes of caramel and maple for a few seconds. Light-medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable as expected, with no alcohol noticed at all as expected for 4.5%. Some good flavor balance for what is present. Overall this is an ok beer. Not offensive by any means, but it really is lacking in the flavor department. I wanted it to be much more robust than what was offered.","superspak","Feb 24, 2012"

Molasses aroma intensifies as the beer warms up. On the lighter side of medium bodied, a bit watery, with aggressive tangy carbonation. Earthy malt flavor is dominant throughout with occasional hints of nuts and an underlying sweetness that lingers at the finish. This was very easy to drink and would go very well with spicy foods.

The nose is mellow, mostly offering sweet roast barley notes, and a bit of maple-y aroma. The flavor is just a bit sweet, and the maple is light (but present); it covers the same territory as the nose. In fact, this tastes a bit like an extremely delicious wort. Hops are present, but very light, adding perhaps a tinge of sweet floral notes. There seems to be a bit of UK ale yeast fruitiness, as well.

Even after 10-15 minutes sitting there, I only got a super-tiny bit of light-toasted nut and definite maple notes. And those elements only barely intensified in the flavor.

Nice malty, caramel and slight coffee taste. Was a little sweet in the beginning but seemed to get more sweet as I continued. Didn't really get to a point of maple syrup though.

I find the overall drinkability of this to be good, but tried to be fair according to the style which may not be accurate according to what I got out of this -a nice gentle brown more in the English style with complimentary maple that doesn't go too far too sweet, just a simple brown that hits the spot.","Slatetank","Apr 19, 2011"

If the beer is brewed with maple, then I'd expect something along that line. Nothing really stood out except for the maltiness you get in most brown ales.

Wonderful maple syrup aroma and just the right amount of syrup added to still taste like a beer. One of my personal favorites. A must drink for Maple Syrup fans everywhere.

The mouthfeel is quite thin for the style, and the texture is watery. Overall, this beer is very odd in that is has some aspects that are very good, and others that are very poor.

Not much for hop aroma though. Wow, taste is very very ballanced. The front is sweet and malty, toasted malt, with a hint of maple sugar. I think I can taste more maple in the after taste as well. Little to no hops are detectable, making this beer extremely smooth and balances (dangerously good). Mouthfeel is watery and refreshing; this could actually get the job done on a hot day.

Starts with a malty nutty presence and finishes with an off taste that isn't very enjoyable. There is also just a hint of hops.

They definitely didn't use much maple, but this could be a very nice session beer, with enough comfortable flavor to be interesting, but not too much to hinder quaffing.

4.15,21.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Never knowing what you get from Tommyknocker (sometimes wonderful, but sometimes lackluster), this Brown Ale shows a lot of promise. Starts with a creamy, nutty, chocolate-ey, malty flavor and develops into a lightly tart, sweet, thinning body in the finish. The maple syrup adds a lot of sweetness, tartness, nuttiness, and accentuates the chocolate malts. Never thick, but remains creamy and finishes a little lighter than expected. Leaves a little residual sugar on the toung and a hint of twangy fermentedness. Not overly complex, yet pleasant and nice. I look forward to having another.","BEERchitect","Mar 25, 2006"

Mouthfeel is shy of medium, carbonation is fairly restrained. Starts out with the maple flavors, a sense of cashews, practically all sweet malt in the impression. Slightly tangy and distracting in the middle with a finish that's kind of chalky and a little on the thin side. Not overly sweet or really cloying, but not that exciting or satisfying either.

Aroma was very meak, with some roasted malts, maybe. The taste is what stuck out the most, with the same general first impression as a watery porter. Rather smoky, chocolaty, sweet and roasted but had that little kick of maple syrup and/or brown sugar that lingered. I did find it pretty pleasant but don't think I could have more than one or two in a night. No carbonation and the sweetness was pretty powerful.

The body is brownish amber, full preparing me for what I expect is an onslaught of maple syrup. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and full bodied. Wow, to my surprise its more of a nutty flavor than anything, and is certainly at the forefront. The maple appropriately dangles in the background and actually acts as a nice compliment. A little bit of a toasted bread feel. It finishes with a little nutty grittiness and some paler maple notes.

Scent of roaster nuts as well as chocolate. Very sweet and very malty as expected. The flavor didn't give me what I was looking for. Maybe thats my fault. Too little of everything. I expected powerful malts, roasted nuts and nice chocolate taste. I got a little roasted malts and a little hint of others. The finish is plain and boring. 2 seconds after my first sip, my mouth forgot what it had tasted. All in all a decent but somewhat plain brown ale.

But the aroma is more impressive than the appearance with a nutty, toasted graininess and sweetish maple syrup. The body is medium, and the carbonation is quite restrained, allowing the sweetness to come through. Maple syrup definitely contributes to the flavor - at least in its sweetness, but the main component is the very nice nutty, toasty, caramelish and slightly chocolatey malt base beneath. Hops are downplayed, and leave just a subliminal bitterness and no flavor whatsoever. It finishes as might be expected, with some residual malt and a clearer note of maple syrup than is evident prior. Surprisingly, however, it's not cloying. It's interesting, somewhat complex, and drinkable although I think it needs to be reserved as a specialty beer because beyond one serving the sugars do tend to start to build on the palate.

The label made me think it would be more maple syrup and more nutty. Toasted malts finish up, An slightly better than average brown ale. Drinkable yes, I guess I was expecting a little more.

There's a nice brown ale wanting to come out, but a friggin wine cooler keeps pushing him back in. The maple notes seem artificial and overlayed atop a nice nut brown ale.
