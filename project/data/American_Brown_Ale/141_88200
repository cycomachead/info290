It seems to fit the description well; A hoppy brown ale, with a nice balance of hops and caramel malts. Id put this behind Dogifish's Indian Brown Ale as my second favorite brown ale to date. Smuttynose makes some of the best beers for the price in my area, at $9.99 a six pack and around $30 for a case. This particular one is 8.4% abv. Huge bang for your buck!","Bone53","Mar 07, 2015"

Color was a deep-brown with cola highlights (SRM = > 22, < 27) and NE-quality clarity. Nose had a prevalent malt sweetness, despite the label calling it a ""hoppy brown ale"". I got notes of milk chocolate, light smoke, and some mild grassiness. Mouthfeel was rather full and creamy. The taste was much more bitter than the nose had led me to expect. It had an over-kilned roastiness to it that seemed to bring its bitterness to the forefront. I do not know how I feel about this as I like my coffee hot, black and bitter, like some of my women. In my beer, though, I feel like there is such a thing as too much bitterness and this was pressing that limit. Finish continued to have an unbalanced, burnt, bitterness that was just more than I could get behind. Frankly, it reminded me a LOT of Black/Cascadian IPA and I do not like them for the same, burnt, smoky reason. Hmm. What shall I review next? ...","woodychandler","Jun 26, 2014"

Worth noting are the wee floaters at the bottom. I wish brewers would tell me when their beers are bottle conditioned. The smell, though, is great. It has a rich nutty aroma with just a hint of the hops. The taste is similar, with a little more hops and some light bready notes, as well. There is a nice thickness to it and overall I find this to be a great melding of a traditional brown with American craft brewing styles.","delta490","Mar 24, 2014"

Fine speckled lacing left behind, the nose gives off a semi sweet roasted malt character with hints of herbaceous hops, citrus pith with the dark roasted malt character. Rustic brown ale heavy hops dank bitterness on the palate rush of herbaceous bitterness with a begrudging kick of alcohol on the palate in the backend I had no clue it was as high in alcohol as it is. Hop particles are floating in the bottom of my glass visually it's appealing and it must add a good bit of flavor. Textures are dark resinous, slightly stick with a healthy amount of hops and natural carbonation flowing forth so smoothly. Overall, I'm happy to be impressed by Smuttynose, recent finest kind IPAs have been slacking with this beer it's really easy to enjoy Smuttynose again.","WVbeergeek","Beers"

Pours murky very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, floral, grass, pine, toast, biscuit, cocoa, caramel, light char, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of bright hops with moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, pine, floral, grass, cocoa, caramel, toast, biscuit, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, pine, floral, grass, cocoa, caramel, toast, biscuit, light char, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance and complexity of bright citrus/pine hops with moderate dark/roasted malt flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome hoppy brown ale. Great flavor balance and complexity of bright hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

This one is no exception, though I do applaud the effort and it wins points for its strength which doesn't detract from its drinkability. I guess I just appreciate the citrusy hops more since every IPA I've had from Smuttynose has been certainly more in the earthy vein.

Head is dense, aprroximately 1.5 fingers and light tan in color and eventually dissipates into a solid, 1/8th inch cap embedded with ringlets. Two semi-concentric bands of lacing encircle the glass. Nose expresses caramel malt, roast and just the merest hint of hops aroma at the back. Wow that's good - coffee, sweet caramel malt, a charred roast character and some medicinal bittering at the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a lively carbonation and some acidity that stimulates the salivary glands and leaves a residual prickle on the tongue between quaffs. I have to say that I'm surprised at how much I like this beer. Perhaps a little too medicinal at the finish, but really top notch.

The smell is very roasty, chocolaty and pretty typical for a darker brown ale. Along with the solid malt profile there is also a good deal of piney and earthy hop. The taste is actually led by the hops in this one with a both bitterness and hop flavor hitting out front. After the hops the malts are there, again mainly roasted and black which give coffee and chocolate notes while there are perhaps less of the caramels and other lighter malts that are more typical for a brown ale. The body is heavy and somewhat chewy this is combined with an incredibly bitter, dry finish that really coats the mouth. Overall this is a pleasing offering, a novel blend of a brown ale and IPA which happens to take the best characteristics of both.","fank2788","Feb 01, 2014"

A classic brown ale with a bit of cheerful hops to carry it off with a decidedly sunny disposition.","utopiajane","Jan 29, 2014"

Lots of different flavors here. Bitter at the finish with more hot cocoa and piney hops. Floral hints. Somewhat of a heavy mouthfeel with lots of carbonation.

The malts trend towards dark-roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, spicy pine, nuts, floral hops, and some grapefruit.

I think these tend to work a little better without the dueling bitterness and astringency of hops and roasted malts. It makes for a much smoother, easier drinking experience and you still get some of the more robust malt flavors. From what I've been told, Smuttynose intends to 6 pack this and roll it into their seasonal lineup. I think that'll prove to be a good decision.","smccann","Sep 18, 2013"

Poured in a shaker pint, the beer is a vibrant, dark, ruby-tinged brown coloring with a tall, frothy, clingy, light tan head that starts a solid inch and a half and slowly settles into a quarter inch with very good retention. The film clings all over the glass. Aromas are very hop forward, with a pine resin richness, and a rich backbone that blends caramel and nut sweetness. Flavors are roasty and sweet on the forward tongue, with a robust blend of nut and toffee. Tangy and resiny bitter hops presence quickly follows, with peppery spices and a touch of smoke. Great lacing all over the glass as you drink, and the beer remains light and smooth in mouth. The aftertaste is rich, roasty, and slightly bitter. The beer is a pretty decent blend of an American Brown and an IPA, which comes off very interesting and very drinkable, despite the slightly elevated ABV. Slick, light, slightly dry finish with a subtle sweet linger. Tasty brew.","GarthDanielson","Jun 30, 2013"

4.78,21,5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a dark mahogany, with a two inch dark tan head that leaves loads of webby lacing. Smell is citrus hops, pine, carmel, and a little bread. Taste just burst with big citrus hops, with everything else in a supporting role, with a hint of roasted chocolate malts in the finish. Body is medium large, with lots of life,not dry, and easy drinking. This is excellent, reminds me of a big, brown version of Zoe Ale. Please make this again, because it is a treat.","SawDog505","Dec 31, 2012"

4.24,7.3,4,5,4,4,4,"Pours a solid dark brown with faint ruby highlights when held to light and a huge fluffy tan head that persists forever before sticking lace to the sides of the glass. I could smell the pine and earthy hops as soon as I popped the cap of the bottle. Pine, earth, resin, and a hint of garlic and citrus make up the bulk of the nose on this one. There's supposed to be some malt here, but my nose can't find it. The flavor holds a bit of toffee and caramel up front but there's enough pine and resin to make that a bit hard to find. This finish actually has a long lingering caramel or toffee, and a chocolate and ash flavor to it. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a resinous almost sweet mouthfeel to it. This is a great brew, I'm glad I was lucky enough to find a bottle of this. Now to find some on tap!","johnnnniee","Dec 21, 2012"

4.09,3.5,4,5,3.5,4.5,4,"The beer pours a surprisingly clean mahogany brown, with a nice finger width head that lasts awhile, and gives a sand-dune white color. Lacing is long and medium in size, sticking nicely to the sides of my glass. The beer sits in the glass rather dark, almost black, with nice carbonation moving through it. On the nose, this beer smells like heaven. Big fat juicy hops, mango, passion fruit, ruby red grapefruit, and a light caramel sitting below everything, and hinting at the malts in this beer. This is a superb smell for anything with hops, though as it warms the alcohol becomes more present and spicy in the smell. On the taste there is some big grapefruit and alcohol with light caramel and nuts dancing on the sides of the flavor. The beer opens with bitter grapefruit which builds into spicy alcohol and grapefruit. As it moves towards the finish, light roast, caramel, and very light nuttiness come through in the taste. The aftertaste is bitter and pithy grapefruit with a light caramel tingle. On the mouth, this beer feels light and fluffy, and slightly chewy, sitting at the upper end of a light body and lower end of medium, and leaving the mouth with a light sticky layer of bitters and caramel. Overall, this beer is tasty. I would love to knock back a six –pack of this on a late summer night or fall night. The smell is definitely the most heavenly part of this beer, hinting far more at a double IPA, and actually reminding me of Wookey Jack by Firestone Walker. This is a great beer that really shouldn’t be around for long (due to its small batch), but if you see it snatch it up. Also, if Smuttynose is reading this review, please throw this in 6-packs and put it alongside Finest Kind at the grocery store so I can by sixers of it regularly. Yes I realize its 8+% but, its tasty, and if you have to then lower the percentage, and still put it in a six-pack, thanks. Drink this stuff.","Maxwell","0"
