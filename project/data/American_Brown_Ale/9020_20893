I taste dark malt with a slight note of spice similar to that of rye.  I'm thinking that is the flaked maize.

A creamy, medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, not a fan of this one at all but not a bad beer from a more objective perspective. To me, this beer was a roastier version of an alt while also reminding me way too much of New Belgium's Fat Tire.","denver10","Sep 01, 2014"

The aroma was particularly bold for a brown ale as the malt was an attention grabber. The taste was watery up front before growing progressively maltier. Notes of chocolate and corn were hidden among the malt selections. In the aftertaste, a mild citrus hop note is detectable among the malts. Because this ale is a little thicker than most brown ales, the aftertaste is allowed to linger a little longer than usual. Overall, this is an above average brown ale.","JohnnyHopps","Aug 24, 2012"

Mouth-filling flavor is this beer's strongest point - rich and malty with hints of caramel, brown sugar and apple and just a whisper of banana. Texture is smooth, but lacking in fizz.

Lots of flavor for such a light bodied but dark beer. Easy to drink.","JayS2629","Jun 12, 2011"

Often this beer is sered too cold as it was last night at The Palm restaurant in downtown Nashville. Order it and let it sit a little and as it warms is choclate notes are more evident and it tastes better. An area this beer could be better is mouthfeel. A little too much carbonation at times.

3.85,6.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a nice light brown, clear, with reddish/ruby highlights. A White head sits on top, kind of thick, at least 2cms, which stays around, leaving nice lacing, and sending a nice stream of bubbles through the beer. Looks good, very good. It smells like sweet caramel, a bit like cola, with some light hints of milk chocolate. Not much of a hop presence, which is kind of normal, but out of the ordinary as far as American styles go - and I can also smell a bit of yeast, mixing with the malts, to make a very bready kind of smell. Something smells almost raw, like unfermented wort. The taste delivers mostly on the cola nots, like a less sharply carbonated Coca-Cola. There's also a hint of creaminess, a tiny bit of spice from the hops I suppose, and a hint of chocolate. It actually tastes a bit like root beer as well, with very low bitterness, no leafiness, just a hint of earthiness is all. Actually, I would like just a little more, no bitterness, not much with dry hops, but just a little earthiness or maybe some herbal flavors to balance with the sweetness of the malts. Almost not complex enough, but still very nice. The body is kind of medium, maybe a bit on the thin side, but knowing the ABV, that isn't surprising. The carbonation is mild as well, no sting, just a tiny sharp presence on the tongue. There are a few thing that could add some body and complexity, without losing the character of the beer, maybe replacing some of the lighter malt with some roasted malts, maybe adding a little bit more hops towards the end of the boil. But still, it's better than the average brown ale by all means. This is actually a perfect sort of session brown ale. I would probably go to it if I wanted to drink one thing for quite a while. It's very pleasant, sort of inoffensive, and you could definitely do worse. It won't blow you away, but this is a beer you should take a shot at if you can.","taylorhamrick","Jul 08, 2009"

The aroma is where this one got me. I'm not one for that charred over the top roasted malt that I've have found in some beers of this style this one was sweet and malty with just enough roasted character and citrus-like hops to balance it out and the flavor was spot on.

The finish was very smoooth with the same malty sweetness that I noted on the tongue continuing to linger. I would mark this one down as a session beer.","woodychandler","Oct 26, 2007"

3.54,-2.5,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Enjoyed at Buffalo Billiards, Downtown Nashville. The beer stood out immediately at an American Brown Ale, without knowing the style. The beer opens with a mostly-malty, but slightly-toasty aroma with slight hints of chocolate, lactose, and a crisp hop character. The flavors are subtle and light, but take on more chocolate than toast or milk sweetness; but rests on a firm, sweet malt base. The hops are also light, sometimes undecernable between English and American varieties -- yet citrus bittering prevails in the finish. The beer has a moderately light body, but does show nice creaminess and does not waiver. A good Brown, but likely gets lost in the shuffle.","BEERchitect","Oct 08, 2007"
3.75,3.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a deep amber, almost brown, with a big ol tan head. Died semi-fast. Aromas of a sweet malty caramel and chocolate were pleasantly found in this bad boy, and in the quaff. Although, I will say the flavor needed a bit more staying power for this to make up to the next level. Bit thinnish body, but a decent drinking brown that would work for a session.","Vancer","Oct 05, 2007"
3.88,6.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a brown color, nice carbonation, huge two-finger plus creamy tannish head, nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, bitter, and a good dose of caramel. The taste is malty, slightly bitter, toffee/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice brown ale, alittle different taste than other's I've had, but still very tasty.","Wasatch","Oct 03, 2007"
3.26,-10.2,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Appearance is a deep amber color, with lots of head retention. Smell is sweet maltiness, nutty grain, very small hint of hop bite, but not much. Taste reminded me strongly of a bock. Lots of caramel flavors, with a hint of chocolate and some very mild hop bitterness. Finishes slightly dry. Full mouthfeel, fairly drinkable. A decent Vienna-stlye beer.","IgnatiusReilly","Aug 15, 2007"
3.3,-9.1,3,3,3,4,4,"Drinkability: beyond the simple flavor profile I found this to be quite easy to drink. Definite session beer, but the flavors are a bit thin to make this an all night beer.","Gavage","Jun 26, 2007"
3.36,-7.4,3.5,2.5,4,2.5,3.5,"A decent beer, basically slightly above average. Its your call as to whether to try it. I could have used two or three instead of a full sixer.","SaCkErZ9","Jun 22, 2007"
2.03,-44.1,2.5,2,2,2,2,"It's drinkable, but not recommended by me anyway. If I ever get the opportunity, I'll give it another chance, probably in bottle form. Not a good showing this time around.","jim102864","Jun 12, 2007"
3.46,-4.7,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"D: This is by far the best Mexican style beer I have had that was brewed in Tennessee. It had a decent pairing with the tacos, the sweetness balanced the spiciness of the taco. I generally like bolder beers but this has good potential for a session beer.","drseamus","Apr 25, 2007"
3.98,9.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, good representation of style, this is a beer that well-worth sticking with for an evening and is the type of beer that can either be a good sipper or a good pounder.","TheManiacalOne","Mar 28, 2007"
4.17,14.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Yazoo's Dos Perros pours a very dark brown body beneath a short head of creamy tan foam. The head retention is average, but it leaves some nice splashes and spots of lace about the glass. A whiff of cocoa greets you in the nose, giving you a hint of what's to come. It's medium-light bodied with a very fine, moderate carbonation that gives a delicate bristle to the tongue. In the flavor it displays a touch of soft milk chocolate, supple dried fruit, a flicker of juicy berries, and a touch of malty toastiness. Its hop flavors and bitterness are limited to allow the maltiness and yeasty fruitiness to shine, yet it's superbly balanced by a delicate acidity that couples with the yeasty fruitiness to give the impression that it's more fruity than it is. It finishes mostly dry with a pinch of cocoa, some lingering apricot-like fruitiness, and the suggestion of some leafy and grassy hops. I found it charming, interesting, enjoyable, and really easy to drink. Highly recommended.","NeroFiddled","Feb 13, 2007"

3.13,-13.8,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours vibrantly, with a noisy, crackling buff colored head consisting of loosely packed small and medium bubbles. The head was quick to settle, leaving only scant remnants at the margins. Deep amber, crystal clear with plenty of slowly rising carbonation streams. The smell is clean and crisp with some hints of roasted malts and corn. The taste is slightly grainy up front with some corn mixing in as well. There is a slight hint of roast malt bitterness perking up in the finish. Gently hopped, this one finishes with only a soft, trailing floral note. Light body, feels feather light on the tongue, and with gently carbonation. This is an easy drinker that is at home with Mexican food.","hopsaplenty","Apr 25, 2006"

2.7,-25.6,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"The brewery was shooting for a Vienna Amber, similar to Dos Equis (hence the play on the name). While I'm in general a fan of this newer brewery, this particular beer falls short. Pours surprising dark, more like a schwarzbier. Flavor profile is a bit grainy, and the bottle notes the use of flaked corn, which is perhaps influencing my perception, but I seem to get a bit too much corn adjunct in the flavor. Dos Equis is certainly not the best of its style, but I have to say I'd choose it over Yazoo's try. In the brewery's defense, they haven't been bottling all that long, and I haven't tried this on tap yet.","Brent","Feb 08, 2006"

4.04,11.3,3,4,4,4,4.5,"Yazoo has just installed a bottling line in the last month. The Dos Perros has a deep chestnut brown color with a disappointingly vanishing head. Rich sweet Malt dominates the nose and the flavor with nuances of hop bitterness for balance. Finish is very smooth. This is not my favorite style but I could drink alot of this. Very nicely done brown ale.","John1985","Sep 28, 2005"
3.85,6.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Had this on tap in Nashville. Pours a standard brown color with a medium head and leaves a little lacing on the glass. Malty aroma, but low on the nut-like aroma. Some spices in there. The flavor is a little weak for a brown, but still good. Well balanced with the hops and malts. Easy to drink, but it could use a little something extra.","clvand0","Jan 24, 2005"
3.68,1.4,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Stopped in Nashville one evening and ordered a Bohanan Vanilla Cream--a local brew. Bartender said the brewery was taking a break but to try a Yazoo as a local option. Nothing other than the appearance reminded me of a classic brown Ale--good balance of hops and malts, no nuttiness of hints of caramel or chocolate. Almost like a heavier Newcastle. Okay choice.","Backer2004","Nov 23, 2004"
