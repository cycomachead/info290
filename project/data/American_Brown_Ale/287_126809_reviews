"Recommendation: Check it out if you're keeping up with the series. Otherwise, feel free to pass on it."

"Taste starts with a faint cinnamon flavor and ends with a hoppy, non floral bitterness."
"Kind of what to expect from an imperial brown. I like the creamy, smooth mouth feel and there is a nice toasty malt flavor. This is better than a lot of brown ales but if you don't like the style you may not like this."
"Mouthfeel is lighter in body than if expect and there is a fairly high level of carbonation that seems to accentuate the bitterness. Overall I'm let down after being sucked in by the aroma."

"O: One of the more interesting brown ales that I have tried recently (this is a style that has definitely fallen out of favor and innovation by brewers in recent years). Pretty easy to drink and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Highly drinkable brown with nice malty smoky flavors but surprisingly not strong flavors from Bells. Somewhat average compared to a few others. The ABV of 8 is barely noticeable. Ok but will not seek again."

"M: moderate to high carb for style."

"O: Overall a decent beer, the aroma is a bit on the funky side, but the flavor makes up for it."

"Overall this is a boozier standard brown ale, probably the least interesting of this series yet, too malt driven for me"

"Bell's Jupiter -----4/5."
"Thin tan head that fell fast but left spotty lacing.  Cloudy murky brown color.  Nose is multigrain bread crust with a touch of sweetness and dark fruits.  Taste is light brown sugar, rich crisp malt.  Juicy middle.  Slight hops bitter for balance.  Finishes malty and sweet and way too easily.  Breaddy. Bitterness lingers for a bit.  Mouthfeel is medium heavy with some chewiness."

"Overall, a fairly strong brown ale from bell's and much better than the other offerings in the planetary series. Recommended."

"Turbid brown pour topped with a fast receding cafe tan foam. It looks like a brown ale. Smells strongly of caramel, along with biscuits, hazelnuts, grain and earth.  Taste is toffee-caramel lightly toasted hazelnuts, milk chocolate and earthy faintly chocolate milk sweet.  Hop keeps this malty dog dry and not overly sweet. Medium mouthfeel is quite creamy but at the same time bright and nearly effervescent, it holds together well. Well I'm glad I re-entered the planetary fray!  I had bowed out after the Venus debacle but hey, this is a great brown ale. 8% ABV!  Not a hint of that."

"O - The is a nice hoppy Brown Ale. Smooth and easy drinking."

"my favorite out of the series.  great brown ale"
""

"Overall I like this more than Venus that crazy blonde. Much more balanced and smooth drinking."
""
"Full bodied, well carbonated ale.  Overall this is a nice American Strong Ale."
""

"Bold, yet very drinkable, brown ale. I find it to be the best of the series, so far."
""
""
"Flavor follows the same path the aroma led.  Sweet and smooth.  Reminds me more of a dopplebock than a brown ale."

"O: Toss up between whether Jupiter or Mars is the best Bell's Planet series beer so far. Jupiter is very smooth and unassuming, bringing a sweet view on the imperial brown ale. Very enjoyable brew."

"Cheers!"

"Overall: A really good imperial take on an American Brown Ale. Good toasty and roasty malt flavors with a nice hop background."
""
""
""

"Smooth and drinkable. That said not much going on here. Not much smell or taste."
""
"Average at best for a brown ale."
""

"A full three fingers of biscuity light brown head is easily achieved with my pour.  Body is a deep mahogany brown in tone.  Nose is a mix of woodsy meets sweet malt that is very nice.  Taste is immediately sweet with tons of toffee and caramelized malt.  There is a richness to this brew that carries the sweetness to a complex balance.  This is unmistakably on the sweeter end of brown ales but is very nice.  Wonderfully drinkable and maybe my favorite of the series so far."

"O - I am not a huge brown beer guy, but this one is awesome.  I will buy it again.  Bells does it again!"

"Nose lacks presents but the flavor makes up for it. Flavor is mildly sweet, biscuity, nutty, and woody. Mouth feel is perfect."

""

"It sure drinks easy for the 8% but the flavors are light and a tad boring. It could really use some extra malt presence."
""
""
""
""
"O- It's a really drinkable brown ale.  Straight forward, if not amped up.  More a bold sipper than a session ale.  A nice nightcap beer.  I'd definitely pay for this beer again."
""

"Well done, true to style, has a bit of hop flavor in the finish"

"From bottle into a snifter, two finger tan head, opaque dark brown beer. Nose is yeast, bread, brown sugar, marzipan, light roast. Medium to full body for a brown, nice medium to low carbonation, enough to ensure the sweetness in not cloying. No hop flavor or bitterness detectable. Long caramel finish that lingers on the tounge. Nothing too complex, but very enjoyable."

"12 ounce bottle, Batch 13923, packaged on 2/14/15.  Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a hazy chestnut brown color with about a half inch light tan head that stayed around a long time.  There's a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like chocolate, toffee, roasted malt, and some light floral hops.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some dark breadiness and herbal bitterness noticeable too.  There's more bitterness than I expected, but that's not a complaint.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with moderate carbonaton.  I think it's a nice brown ale, I liked it.  $12.99 a 6-pack."

"Very underrated in my opinion, Venus and mercury were terrible, this is a nice come back for the series"

"It is decent. The balance between the malt and the hops is good. There is just nothing about this beer that gets me excited."
"OK. I think I'll give this series another try. Not what I quite expected."
""
""
""
"Overall: I am reminded why I am generally leery of brown ales, with the significant variations in hop prevalence that range from ""sweet dessert beer"" to ""dark IPA"". While I was able to finish this bottle, I will assuredly not repeat this one. Much like the Carson's Brewing Brown Cow, the description of which spoke volumes about its seven types of malt while including a throwaway line regarding supporting hops, this is hop-forward enough to not be for me. It just doesn't do so to the point of drain pouring."
""
""
"Flavor is on the sweet side, accented by high alcohol esters and muted malt fruitiness. The toasted character is to the point of being overdone, and when combined with the earthy hop character, it robs the palate of flavor at the harsh finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this isn't too interesting, but it is what it is. This is your traditional brown ale, just amped up."
""
""

"For as hard as it is to get its kind of a let down.  If anything I'd say its a slightly below average brown ale."

" Not good. Not bad. Unremarkable."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 2/15/2015. Pours hazy reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light cocoa, light nuttiness, herbal, light pine, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light cocoa, light nuttiness, herbal, light pine, and toasted earthiness. Light herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light cocoa/nuttiness, light pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and slightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice imperial brown ale style. All around good complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O - Confused Identity is what this beer is all about, when I first started on it i thought it was a decent brown ale then once it climbed a few degrees in temperature it tasted pretty much a winter warmer kinda beer. Lots of spice"

"This group of planet beers has not been one of my must have. I keep looking for one to be great but has of this date no luck....,"

"Nicely done imperial brown ale."
"As others have said, this tastes like an amp'd up Best Brown. Not sure what this planet series is going for anymore."
""
"Definitely ought to be more liked than both Mercury and certainly Venus. Mars is still the best in the series in my opinion, but Jupiter is a good brown ale. I'm disappointed that I had to drive around as much as I did to make sure I got a bottle (actually wound up with two), but I told myself I'd make sure I got to try every beer from the series."
"O- Pretty average as far as brown ales go. Good bitterness, decent malt backbone but not a whole lot of complexity despite the higher ABV. I would go with Bell's Best Brown over this 10 times out of 10."
""
""
""
"It's ok, but not too impressed . . . Maybe because I consider Bell's Best Brown par for the course."
""
"Medium-full on the palate, the beer works hard to retain its creamy taste and texture, but the abundance of alcohol and woodsy hop bite give a sprucey finish. Aftertaste of pepper, wood and coffee grounds remain and gives the ale a surprising drinkability."
"Not sure why this isn't getting rated well... An exceptional brown ale."

"This beer had a lot of potential, but I think it was all ruined by the metallic aspects which tainted the whole beer."
""
"O- A pretty solid beer, I actually think this would be pretty good in bourbon barrels, kinda just tastes like a sweeter version of Best Brown. I enjoy the light chocolate on the finish."
