"awesome brown ale, definitely the smoothest brown I have ever tasted"
""

"Overall:  I generally find brown ales pretty boring but the flavors here caught my attention; that's about as good as it gets with this style"
""
""
""
"This is a refreshing medium body, medium to medium low carbonation session beer."
""
""
"Nutty earthy taste. Maybe some caramel in there too. Dark brown color. Creamy white head. Ok beer. One of my least favorites from ale asylum."

"I have fond memories of Madison. ...That doesn't have any bearing here, I'm just sayin'. Anyway, this stuff pours a surprisingly swampy sienna topped by a finger of lightly-sandy off-white foam. The nose comprises lightly-toasted wheat bread, honey, oats, a sprinkle of dirt, and a vague notion of even vaguer fruits wafting in the breeze somehow, as though they were spirits of their former, earthly selves. The taste brings in more of the same, that odd fruit sensation remaining, but even more ephemeral, like the memory of the above description. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a decent little brown ale, nothing to write home about, and, unfortunately, with things like Moose Drool and Sam Smith out there, probably nothing I'm likely to see again (though I wouldn't shun it if handed to me somewhere)."

"Overall- Decent, overly sweet brown ale that doesn't bring a lot else other than sweetness to the table."

"This is the first beer I've ever tried from this brewery and I'm already a fan. This was a really good nut brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - good nut brown ale here. Nothing exceptional, but definitely drinkable."

"It hits the style on the head. A rich malty smooth that is sweet, but balanced. Caramel-ish, nutty, slightly chocolaty with a smooth texture. I had a second bottle with leftovers from Thanksgiving, and it went well with the free-range turkey and the gravy!"

"O- I'd like more from the body of this beer, for some reason, and I think the taste could be a little bolder."
""
""
""
"I was not ""mad"" about the Madtown Nutbrown. Definitely di not rank in my top ten for brown ales. The beer pour a nice brownish amber with ok head that did not lace. The scent carried earthy and malt aromas but nothing out of control. The taste was more like a watered caramel coffee. The mouthfeel was light in body with decent carbonation. Overall it was just ok....definitely worth a try."

"O - A tasty brown ale, worth a try and well worth picking up."
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer."
"O - Nut-rich and earthy, the dry toasted notes seem to overwhelm the sweetness of this beer for a significant balance shift to the ""nutty"" side. Madtown is certainly not a bad beer, by any standards, it's just not my cup of tea when it comes to brown ales; the sweetness hides providing minimal balance and it's dryness becomes cloying."
""
"This is a nice balance of floral hops, medium-low bitterness, and a touch of a slightly roasted malt. It's not too bitter, not too sweet, but a great all-around brew."
""
""
"Nice brown. Easy drinking. I'd buy it again."
""
"This poured out as an orange brown color with a tan colored head on top. The retention was decent, the lacing was minimal. The smell of the beer is lightly roasted and sweet smelling, plenty of malt on the nose. The taste of the beer is malty as well with a decent roasted flavor as well, not bitter at all. The mouthfeel is creamy, nicely carbonated and smooth. Overall it's a very good beer in my opinion. Worth checking out."
""
"O-a plain brown ale. Tastes more like an English version. Not much character here but drinkable"
"O) Brown Ales don't get a whole lot of love, but this is a good one. It's quite flavorful, and easy to drink. Glad to recommend this brew."
""
"Overall- Although brown ales should be malty, this one misses the mark entirely. To me, it is too sweet and because of it, I missed the subtle malty nuances that a traditional English brown has."
""
"Overall - Smells like its going to taste better. Not awful, but not worth looking for."
""
"New Glarus is not making Fat squriell this year but that is ok because we have this, good stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a really good brown ale. I liked their porter a twinge better but very nice and easy to drink, with a lot of nuts and malts to it. Worth checking out."

"M: Good carbonation bite, malt toasty, and a fair aftertaste."
""
""
"I absolutely love this beer. The best compliment I can give it is that in no occasion would I not want to be drinking one. If you can find it it's even better on tap, and unfairly good when dispensed at the brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: great beer with rich malt character, not a must have for the style but bashes a newcastle over the head and buries it."

"Pours a solid translucent brown with subtle amber hues, with a nice two finger head and light retention. Nutty malt aroma accompanied by a fair amount of hops. Citrus and grapefruit in faint amounts with that typical and characteristic ale asylum aroma (hard to explain exactly what that is other than a gingery hop smell). Sweet caramel up front, cocoa, nutty malts, grapefruit, and white grape in the faintest amount. Slight tartness to it, medium body, the finish is a bit off, but still very drinkable and still very good."
"This wasn't anything revolutionary, but was well-balanced and an easy drinker. Simple and enjoyable."
"Brown ales are mostly not an exciting category, and this one on-tap at the brewery is no exception. It was however beter than average for the style because of its rich malt and creamy mouthfeel. Too sweet. Light brown colour with creamy head. It looks like its on nitro, which it is not."
"Poured from a stubby brown bottle with some kind of date code that is smeared off of the bottle. A good looking beer for sure. Clear chestnut brown with a few floaties that lead me to think this one could be a tad past it's prime and a massive khaki head that settles slowly to soft peaks. Roasted almonds and barley in the aroma..nice. Roasty and malty flavors with pecan-like nuttiness and plenty of rich malt that is well balanced with mild floral hoppiness. Medium lean bodied and creamy with smooth carbonation. A tasty brew."
"Overall very good for the style."
"O - A very drinkable beer which pairs together the carmel and nut flavors very well. It doesn't leave too much of a lingering flavor, but that helps with the overall drinkability because of how smooth it feels as it is going down. The sweetness is also not overly demanding and thus it goes on the top of the list."
"0=Nice option when wanting more than one, but you want the experience of a darker beer."
" ~ This is a good brown ale and one that any of you brown ale fans out there should give a try. This Madison brewery has a knack for brewing some quality brew."
"D/O- Slight lack of taste makes for ""mad"" drinkability. This one was kind of all over the place as far as my individual ratings went. On the plus side, Mad Town Nut Brown looks great and goods down either whereas the aroma aspect and taste leaves some to be desired. Would recommend to brown/session ale fans."
"This beer pours a dark amber color, with a small tan head. The smell was weak, but had some maltyness. The taste was malty, no nut flavor as the name implies, and a bit light for a brown ale. There could have been more flavor, but easy to drink. Overall not a bad beer, but not a good beer either."
"Perfect for those times when I want something that's just easy to drink without the complexities of the Belgians & RIS that I normally drink. A good representation of the style & one I'll buy again."
"This American brown ale pours a dark brown color with a slight scent of hops. It has a slight hops taste as well but a more overpowering nutty flavor that reminded me of pecans. For being a more flavorful beer it drank rather smooth. Definetly a must try!"
"Overall - Despite my general preference for scottish-style ales, this brown has seen more glass time than the Lake Louie Warped Speed Scotch I bought at the same time. It's inspiring me (along with New Glarus' Fat Squirrel) to brew a brown next."
"A really nice example of a brown ale. No problem drinking several of these. Another good brew from Ale Asylum."
"Pours a nice cloudy brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacy to follow. The nose is malty, with some nice caramel notes. The taste is malty, sweet, with some caramel notes. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, a nice thirst quencher, enjoyable."
"Another winner from AleAsylum...you'd have to be in an asylum to not try this Madtown nut brown."
"Great tasting American Brown Ale....a unique aroma with a toffee like smell....also perhaps some dark berries and a good dose of sweet cocoa powder (think hot chocolate mix)...the taste is a nice blend of the toffee and cocoa....some nuttiness as well....a muddied texture which is fine...low carbonation....highly flavorful and easy drinking."
"Enjoyed on tap at Ale Asylum in Madison, WI. Poured a very dark ruby red body with an off white head that falls to a cap. Aroma is of sweet toffee. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with flavors of brown sugar and a very sweet finish. Decent drinkability."
"Clear auburn body. Thin and dense beige head. Lacing is quite full. Aroma is nutty and malty (toffee). Flavor is nicely rounded, if not inspired. Nutty and malty flavor with ghostly notes of roast. Mellow and agreeble in flavor and body. Decent enough beer."
"Drink a mild but smooth drinkable beer."
"D: Well, most beers that are just average are still pretty drinkable. I dunno, I don't think I'd go back to this one, but I'd do it before a lot of others. Simple average."
"It didn't really make the greatest head, not the most aromatic beer. Smells like it tastes kind of caramel in taste color and smell. Its really a pretty good beer and is something that I think that I could make. Nice mouthfeel and its nice to drink. Not stunning but certainly not bad. Its something good to drink."
"Pours a hazy, brown color with a lighter amber along the bottom of the glass. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of nuts, sweet malt, caramel, roasted malt, and slight toffee. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, nut, toffee, cream, slight hops, and slight sweet malt. Overall, a really good brown."
"Pours a slightly hazed brown with a thin creme head. Flavor is kind of slightly sweet with nut tones and wood tones as well. Slight tangy edge, but it doesn't overshadow the slightly sweet nutty tone that is there. Feel is smooth on liquid. Quite easy to drink. Bump up the nuts and bring down the tangy just a wee bit and I am happier."
"drinkability is solid. very fresh and satisfying nut brown with a very drinkable aura. the brew works on all levels: drinkable, well proportioned, nicely concentrated and delicious. another great brew from Ale Asylum. cheers!"
"Overall, a good, easily drinkable brown ale."
"It pours a dark brown color with a minimal head. The smell is malty with a nutty coffee tone. The taste is a mix of coffee and chocolate. Very malty and rich. It has a nice full mouthfeel. The carbonation is low so it goes down really smooth. I will be picking up a sixer of this next time out."
"This beer is essentially everything I want in a nutbrown ale. Nutty, check. Malty, check. Carmel, check. Smooth, check. Poured a deep amber color and smelled somewhat like an nutty amber. I'm from Milwaukee and have been loving everything out of the Ale Asylum of Madison. It's great to see some brewerys outside of New Glarus make a good name for themselves in Wisconsin. We're known for our watered down sh*t beers, but brewerys like this will definitely help to change that."
"(D) A well brewed nut brown. I'd have another."
"Had this on on tap at the brewery. When poured it looks like nothing special but the taste offers a lot for a saturated beer style. Nice and hoppy at first sip, but the malts really come through at the back end. Very strong flavor for a brown ale while still being mellow. Easy to drink, but gets filling after a while. Nice beer to have sitting around in the winter."
"Pours a cloudy honey/amber with a nice tan head that leaves some lacing. Smells just like the name, a nice malty scent with some nuttiness and some hops in the background. First taste reveals a wonderfully light but flavorful malt with some roasted almonds and a very mild banana flavor in the background, followed by a milder hop note and a fairly clean finish. Very easy to drink and somewhat lighter-bodied, this brew is surprisingly refreshing and very much fits Ale Asylums solid full-malt style. A perfect beer to enjoy while out on the town in Madison."
"I thiink the first time I tried this beer on tap, I was a little off-put byt he strong hop flavors. Well, give this one a little time in the bottle and when the hop oils mellow out, LOOK OUT. This is one of the only lighter ABV beers I can say gets better with age."
"Not being the biggest fan of Nutbrowns, this is the one I buy when I'm in the mood for one! And it's local which is great!"
"D - A great nut brown ale. I wish I had more."
"This beer pours a semi-clear brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of milk chocolate, caramel, and a firm nuttiness. The taste is nuttier, and has more caramel than the aroma, and only had a hint of chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice brown ale. I could happily drink this again."
"Notes from 7/23/07"
"Overall, a nice brown ale. In retrospect, taste reminds me of Fat Tire."
"Not bad. While the aroma and flavors were pretty tight for the style, I wish that they could have been a bit more assertive and the overall feel could had been just a touch beefier to help support them better. This was my first beer from Ale Asylum and I look forward to better selections from them down the road."
"Pours a chestnut brown with unfiltered particles floating in suspension of the beer's body. Nose consists of sweet malt, breadiness - like a baked pie crust, and brown sugar. The mouthfeel is medium and soft. Taste consists of caramel and malt. That ""baked pie crust"" aroma is featured again here in the flavor. Not much else is going on here. Overall, this was a huge let down."
"Aroma, just like the taste is pleasant but not complex; malts, mostly caramel, in a light to medium bodied brew. Decent, easy to drink, but nothing special here."
"It's not a terrible stab at a brown ale, but there are things here that don't quite mesh. It's easily the weakest link in Ale Asylum's bottled line. I'd vote to bench this and put Big Slick Stout in mass production...or Sticky McDoogle...or, really, anything else."
"Poured on tap into a pint glass this brew had a nice acorn color with about a 3/4 inch white head. Once settled there was a nice cap with good lacing down the sides. There was a mild bitter smell with a backbone of nutty tones. Nothing was overly noticeable with the smell of this brew and that followed suit with the taste. This was a thin beer with mild carbonation and only a slight nutty flavor. Some hints of roasted malts in the aftertaste. This was a forgettable beer. Not great, but ok...with the prices there were better choices to make in the AA line-up."
"D-The least satisfying collection from this brewery I've yet had. The overall taste is enjoyable, and it's fairly smooth, but the lightness doesn't do justice to the flavors, and the ale has no equilibrium."
"D- pretty good but not all that great, drinkable"
"this was somehat underwhelming. pours a mostly clear ruby brown but with no head to speak of. toffee, roasted nuts, caramel, and rum in the nose. suprisingly thin malts in the taste. almost no residual sugars. some bitterness in the finish but mostly astringent, like cold tea. minimal carbonation. perhaps this one was a bit past it's prime even though i purchased it a few months ago and it's been in the fridge ever since."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy from the fast moving carbonation. It's somewhere between light and medium bodied making it easy to drink. Overall, it's an easy drinking brown that just seems to be a little lacking in the flavor department to me. Nothing really grabs me in and makes me want to come back to this one."
"Pours a nice brown color with an off white head. Lacing is decent all the way through. Mild aroma of creamy carmel, with just a hint of aroma hops. Taste is very good creamy and carmel dominate the flavors. Mouthfeel and drinkability is excellent, smooth creamy feel and very well carbonated, I will definately be drinking this one again."
"This beer pured a nice red color with a tan head. Aroma was a bit of light caramel but was not overly odoriferous. Flavor was a bit light and a bit of toffee and caramel. Body was light and there was not a tremendous amount of mouthfeel. Not bad, and recommended, but far from spectacular."
"Man, this is a good beer! Poured with a nice light tan head and some lace. Hazy brown color. Very nutty characteristics. Absolutely a session beer. Malty and light hop. Not too sweet. Great mouthfeel. Quite satisfying. Finish is a bit dry at first, then slightly sweet."
"Nice white head with tight bubbles that lasted for awhile. Looks ok in the glass with a mud brown color. But for me, the smell isn't all that pleasant. Some solid malt but the spiceness of the hop doesn't compliment for me. Overly sweet malt has a thin mouthfeel and not a lot of additional depth to it, though the aftertaset isn't bad. This beer just doesn't do it for me though reading some of the reviews online, I seem to be in the minority on this one. Oh well. I would pass it buy for every other Ale Asylum beer I've tried."
"Smoothness reigns here. And flavor is in abundance. Moderate carbonation, medium bodied, and the sweetness is tempered with light hops at each sip."
"Grape-nuts comes to mind, so there must be a good amount of barley in this. There's a nutty sweetness, with a sour apple tang that i'm guessing is from the yeast. Tastes good, but it feels muddled and could use more definition. One pint was enough, doesn't seem much like a session ale."
"I've heard good things about Ale Asylum. I wish I could have made it to the brewpub on my most recent trip to Madison, but I was able to locate a few bottles to ease the disappointment. If Madtown Nut Brown is representative, I'm even more excited about drinking the rest of their offerings than I was previously. This is good beer."
"Overall: Like all the beers at the Ale Asylum, get it. A good beer, maybe could be jacked up a little."
"Sweetness may hinder its drinkability a bit, but it's quite welcoming and accessible. Nicely done!"
"Had a nice tight foamy head that laced graciously down the glass as it was consumed. Had quite a bit of hop character for nut brown, it almost seemed as I was tasting a dark pale ale. It did not have the malt to backup the hops. Besides that it was a delicious beer to the last drop. Much prefer their porter or stout."
"Very flavorful. I found the nuttiness drowned out by the creamy butter and caramel. I'm just not sure about the flavors melding together well, or being top notch individually to begin with. This is also their first attempt at bottling, so I will definitely try it on tap next time."
"Drinkability: Ok, but not my cup of tea."
"drinkability: good"
"Drinkability: Great session brown, but one that has plenty of flavor. Full-bodied, with a great balance of nuts, fruits and chocolate. Simply awesome."
"D-This beer is a work of art. Must nut brown ales are very bad and the malts taste watered down and stale but this beer has fresh flavors with an actual dry nutty note. Good complexity but very easy to drink."
