"This is exactly how a Coffee beer should be... If you didn't know you would swear it's coffee not beer imo"

"Nice brown color very clear.  Nice head to this beer with good head retention.  Very nice coffee aroma followed by malt.  WIsh it was easier to get this in Va."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, it doesn't taste like beer in the slightest. I feel like I'm drinking black coffee whipped up and served cold. I rarely say this but I would love to try a BA version of this. I love coffee beers and this is up at the top."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light shade of brown with a white head.  Aroma of fresh coffee grounds and malts.  The taste has big ground coffee flavor and light malts.  Coffee all day.  Creamy, with a delicate nutty flavor underneath the coffee  Medium bodies, fair carbonation.  I love surly beers and coffee so this was a win.  Very delicious."
""
"Smooth and rich. Coffee is dominant here but it's not over the top either. Which is a surprise from something with coffee right in the name."
""

"Tasted beery, smelt very much like coffee, overall a good beer, I look forward to drinking it once again."
""
"Doesnt appear very big, but it packs a solid coffee punch!"
""
"Big thanks to @Alexander for this one.  Unquestionably the best non-BA coffee beer I've ever had."
""
""
""
"woah.. this is great coffee flavor.. top notch brown ale"
""
""
"This 'American brown ale' style brew pours a very deep mahogany in color with some reddish highlights. A good 3-finger foamy beige head is seen after the pour. A good amount of sticky lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the inside of the mug. The aroma is of freshly roasted coffee beans for the most part. You can smell this across the room even. Pretty much is said for the taste also. If you like black coffee, then this is for you. Lots of flavor. Does finish slighter bitter as would be excepted but doesn't last long. Medium-bodied and perfect carbonation."
""
""
"First beer I had the first time I ever went to Minnesota. Will never forget you, coffee bender. So much coffee!!!"
""
""
"If you like iced coffee,  this is for you!  And I do like iced coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours from the can a dark brown with an off-white head that reduces quickly. The aroma tells you quickly that it's coffee, coffee and more coffee. So it tastes like, well, coffee. There's a bit of chocolate and roasted malts. Medium mouth, and it goes down pretty easy. I taste very little of the Bender base. This reminds me more of a porter or thin coffee stout. It's good, but not what I expected."
""
""
""
""
"Very good flavor. Some coffee beers taste like a coffee filter. Not this one."
"I didn't care for this as much as the regular Bender. More bitter than a plain brown, but not from the coffee. Too much roasted flavor for my palate. Bent Paddle's Cold Press black is the coffee brew to beat these days in Minnesota."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Served at fridge temp from can. Dark brown with tan foam. Ban huge ground coffee nose. If you have ever had iced coffee in southeast Asia, this is what it smells like. Big coffee taste, bit of mocha. Mouthfeel is pretty thin when compared to the big coffee stouts, not in a bad way. Bitter coffee. Pretty one dimensional for me but fine since that's the ways it's advertised. Very good quaffer."
""

"My favorite non-barrel aged coffee flavored beer!"
""
""
""

"Got this coffee beer in 16 oz cans as a souvenir while travelling in Minnesota after having had Surly's Furious.  Pours a chocolate brown with a beige head.  Aroma is fairly intense fresh ground coffee with a little sweet grass background.  Nice and smooth coffee, milk chocolate, and sweet grass taste.  Goes down easily calling for quaff after quaff.  No sipping here: down the hatch!  Classed as a American Brown, I think of it more as a coffee porter, and even more so as Awesome.  Nice job Surly."

"A real unique coffee beer in comparison to the others on the shelves these days. Very easy drinking and an outstanding breakfast beer - especially if you had a long night. Pairs amazing with pancakes and real maple syrup with a side of bacon!"

"Pours a deep amber brown with a thinner slight off white head atop.Full on coffee in the nose,not beerish at all really,if your into coffee this is it.The beer is good...very good but the coffee is dominant and it maybe leaves the fact that it's a beer behind,besides the coffee on the palate I get some chocolate and mild caramel.I have had alot of coffee infused beers this cuts the cake as far as coffee goes,is it caffeinated?That's the question."
""
""
""
"The body was pretty nice, just a bit thinner than I prefer in a Brown Ale, but smooth, except for some coffee bitterness at the back end. Drinkability will totally depend on your view of coffee. You can figure out where I'm at. Overall, a solid brew, and one that a lot of people would love. I'm not one of those people. I just didn't enjoy the beer, but I'm thankful for the gift, and for the experience for having tried it. YMMV."

"Good coffee stout with a big coffee taste, if you want one of the better coffee stouts, grab some of these."

"Coffee Bender is unique, enjoyable and quite delectable.  If you are in Minnesota, you really need to try this one."
"Had it on tap at the Tipsy Cow. This beer tasted just like drinking black coffee. It was good, but I like coffee stouts and porters more."

"This brew just smells like freshly brewed coffee, and tastes almost the exact same way. Probably the most coffee-forward beer I've had, and one of the best beers I've had as well. This is an absolutely phenomenal beer that needs to be purchased if you see it, even at the price I got it for. Lucious, fabulous amounts of coffee... damn, I just wish I could get this in Michigan. Wow, wow, and wow."
""
""
""
""
"O – I want to like this a lot more than I do, but the cold pressed coffee is a little too upfront and pushes the beer out of balance.  That characteristic could certainly be appealing for some drinkers.  Would love to taste this base brown ale with no or more balanced coffee addition."
""
""
"Overall:3.25"
""
""
"I enjoy this beer quite a bit once I get past the initial reaction to the thin body. The flavor is coffee-heavy but offers enough malty flavors to be multi-layered. 4.05"

"O: I am impressed, but not chomping at the bit to get my hands on more. This is definitely a cool beer and I'm glad I tried it, because I've not had anything quite like this."
""
""
""
""
"O - The bitterness is a nice counterpoint to the dark, sweet molasses bread taste.  I will seek this out whenever I'm in an area Surly is distributed."
""
"Good appearance, much like the regular Bender, deep dark brown, but still clear when held to the light; a medium-sized off-white head held for a few minutes and sank to a ringlet, leaving a few dabs of lacing on the glass. Nose full of coffee, with lesser notes of caramel malts. Taste was pure, straight-up bitter black coffee and nothing else. Just blew me away and made me cringe. There's a good way of using coffee in a beer, but for me, this isn't it. I pretty much hate coffee, unless it's in beer, then I actually like it a lot. But when I do have a coffee beer, I want a coffee beer, not a cold can of pure coffee. This was bitter, acrid, one-dimensional, and lacking any sense of balance. I literally could not drink this. But if you love cold, bitter coffee, get as much of this as you can."

""
"I cannot really compare this beer to anything else. Open you mind and give it a go!"
""

"i drank from the can and from a tulip side by side. can lends a more creamy mouthfeel. big dissipation on the pour--too watery. i find no difference on IPAs from can vs. glass but i preferred the can here. give it a try, be interested to hear what other ppl think"

"Overall: In case you haven't figured it out, this is a beer for coffee lovers (or at least coffee beer lovers), so if that's not your thing, you should definitely stay away. That being said, while this is a pretty one dimensional beer (which did effect my scoring), it's done about as well as one could imagine. If you like coffee beers, you need to seek this out."

"Really was expecting more because of the hype. What you get here is a palatable coffee brew. Not a fan of the base Bender mainly because of the lightness of it. This follows the same thread but in this case quality coffee has been added to make it a gem in its own right. If you love a coffee brew then this is one you will like."
""
""
""
"I absolutely am ashamed for not having enjoyed this beer as others apparently do, so I may blame this review on an off can or something. I'm actually a casual fan of iced coffee, but there was something really wrong and burnt tasting about the coffee profile at hand. It's ability to overpower the (good) base beer didn't help the cause any further, however. I'll gladly revisit this if someone pushes for it, but this really wasn't for me at all."

"An incredibly satisfying coffee infused beer. This is without a doubt one of my favorite beers, the fact that I am willing to drive 3 hours to get it should tell you something. If you're able to get your hands on this, there is no reason you shouldn't!"
""
""
""
"568 ml. can sampled. Pours a dark brown with little head. Smells straight-up like coffee, the real grounds, the actual stuff, roasted, just pure intense actual coffee, no beer ingredients, interesting. Taste is straight up iced coffee, like a glass of iced coffee with some ice cubes & carbonation, roasted, grounds, coffee beans, light chocolate, caramel. Easy to drink. This is more coffee than beer. I am not a coffee drinker but one doesn’t need to be that to enjoy iced coffee & I quite liked this. Cheap & in 4packs, I would buy this regularly, it is quite easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes really nice, one of the best if not the best coffee beer I've had. I don't drink coffee, so this is the only way I get coffee, and I'll have some of this anytime. Hard to say much bad about this beer. Enjoy it if you can!"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is the most coffee I've ever tasted in a beer. That's a good thing. If you even remotely enjoy coffee, you would love this. I know I did."
""
""
""
"O: I love this beer! It is a perfect change of pace beer that is well-balanced, with just the right amount of ingredients. This will not be my last."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is possibly the best brown ale that is brewed with coffee. Surly hit a homerun this this beer. Nuff said! Dont hesitate to buy this beer, even at $15 for a 4pack of tallboys. You wont regret your purchase, I promise."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - really nice to go back to this one. The one and only other time I had this was a few years ago when Surly was in the Chicago area on tap only. I wonder what this would be like as a nitro tap. Just a thought."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really dig this beer. Obviously coffee forward… doesn’t leave much for the standard beer drinker. I’m not a brown ale kind o’ guy… but this Brown Oatmeal Coffee Ale is tops… also best coffee forward beer I’ve had. I absolutely MUST have another."
"O. A very nice experience. A well crafted blend of coffee beans and ale. It strongly resembles an iced black coffee with beer. A great combination. This is not an everyday beer but when the time is right, this ale hits the spot. I find this does wonders for hangovers."
""
""
""
"Can from trade and forget who. But thanks! Pours to my tulip brown with some ruby red showing through in the pour. As it accumulates in the glass it ends up very dark brown with a one finger khaki head that's looks very creamy. Aroma is a giant smack of coffee beans, maybe a hint of nutty brown ale in there. Flavor comes in with, SURPRISE, big coffee, earthy and spicy as can be and nearly like liquid espresso beans. There is a light nutty and malt character mixed in there but it is certainly subdued. There is a small hint of bittering cocoa powder as well. The mouthfeel on this is on the thin side and it would have been nice to have either a bit more thickness to this, or more carbonation. As is, the carbonation is a low medium to low. It makes it sort of sit deadened on the tongue. Nevertheless the coffee flavor here is massive and this is rather enjoyable."
""
""
"O - I enjoyed it and will have it again."
""
"what i love about coffee bender is its drinkablity, and intense coffee smells and flavors. its more coffee heavy than any other beer ive ever had, yet it drinks real easy, and could work as an all day beverage. the color is dark brown, but lighter than porter, its got some transparency to it, and has a fading inch of off white head. the nose is all coffee, earthy and bitter, even a little fruity like blueberries, but there is very little acidity. there is also some brown ale style chocolate malt, but the coffee dominates. same in the flavor, its all coffee start to finish. just enough beer here to give some backbone, but this is almost indistinguishable from a cup of coffee, at least in beer terms. the cold pressing really helps the feel stay light and refreshing, and the caffeine is detectable. clean though, not long bitter in the finish, just sharp enough. carbonated well, medium body seems lighter. a four pack of these would be a nice dose i think, a good beer to start a big night with as well. i have loved everything from surly, and i love this too!"
""
""
""
""
"The taste is of perhaps the most coffee tasting beer I've ever had. Unlike many other coffee beers, which are often stouts, this is a lot thinner and really just seems a lot like an iced coffee. I read about how it's made, and it is apparently steeped in coffee beans for 24 hours. It certainly shows. If you're looking for deep complexity in a coffee beer, I'd say to keep looking. If you want a beer that's really a dead ringer for a cold coffee beverage that you'd get at a coffee shop...here you are!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- My first Surly offering, and I think for a coffee brown ale, they did a great job!"
"Overall: Really outstanding beer. As I stated it is a bit light on the ABV. But this is an excellent year round beer. I could imagine drinking this in the summer considering how light, refreshing, and crisp it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Wasn't super impressed with Bender but Coffee Bender is a beautiful brew. The genuine coffee flavor is impeccable. I loved this beer."
""
""
"Bottom Line: Buy if you like coffee, Surly, or experimental beers. Taste or buy a single if you're unsure of any of those things or are just getting into brown ales. Don't buy if you have any problem with coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-loved the coffee in this beer more than any other I can recall, would definitely drink this againa"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Like drinking a fresh, cold growler of coffee. The nose reminded me a lot of spicy, used coffee grounds. Bender was a great fit for this beer in that it’s the perfect creamy, nutty base beer. I just wish more of it would come through. My only real complaint is that odd veggie smell/taste that threw off all the nice coffee complexities. Nice creamy body thought it could have used a bit more heft. Overall, a recommend ale for all who enjoy coffee in their beer. If this was local to me, I can see myself picking up a four pack off and on."
""
""
""
"O - I love coffee. From the first smell to the last drink, it lived up to its name. A very fun play on an American Brown Ale. It was really one note for me though. The smoke was a fun surprise, but it lacked a rounded out flavor. I searched and searched for a nuttieness or balancing sweet note but came up short. The slight toffee taste was less than redeeming."

"O: One of the best all time coffee beers. Very critical of coffee beers, and this delivers big time. Only down side is that I did not buy more."
""
"Notes: Not a brew for the ages but this is quite nice. One needs to be in the mood, and liking the coffee edge, and it sure works for me. With so many coffee ales not getting it right this is quite notable."
""
""
""
""
"Yep!"

"Surly Coffee Bender ---4.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Nice beer. I'd like the flavor to have a bit more complexity to it and the body would be better if it was a bit thicker. Worth trying if you're a coffee lover."
""
"Pours nice dark brown with a small white head. Smell is coffee and coffee, hints of hazelnuts and vanilla. Taste is like the nose coffee, very nice coffee flavor that doesn't taste artificial. Medium body with lower carbonation that works well with this beer. Overall a very good beer, flavors work great together.A must try for coffee lovers."

"O: A classic example of a well executed brown ale, and the coffee only makes it that much better. Nice job Surly!"
""
""
""
""
""
"One of Surly's best beers, in my opinion. This is the coffee drinker's choice in beer. Its wonderful mix of coffee and Ale give it a very distinguished taste. I've affectionately named this beer the Minnesota paper maker, because I'd often find myself sipping on one while writing long winded political science essays. The caffeine gets your mind going, while the smooth 5.1% get's you loosened up just enough to ramble, but not enough to get you Surly."

"Clear brown pour with a ruby hue and a one finger off white head. Aroma is 100% dark iced coffee. Taste is exactly as billed: brown ale and coffee. In the background are aromatic hops and a touch of smoke. Bitter cold coffee flavor lingers in the back of the mouth. It’s bitter but not astringent. I would have liked a touch more sweetness and mouthfeel, but that may just be personal preference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very enjoyable, and very flavorful. Clearly proves that you don't need an alcohol bomb to have big, bold flavors. A must for anyone who loves both coffee and beer."
""
"O: A full flavored, fresh smelling coffee, brown ale kept at a nice ABV to keep it very drinkable. I would gladly take this over many of the double/imperial/RIS Coffee stouts i've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, never had a beer that had this much Coffee flavor before, it is delicious, I drink my coffee black so this beer floats my boat. If you do not like coffee steer clear of this beer, it is not like FBS where you could like the beer and not coffee.... If you do not like coffee I can garuntee you will hate this beer with a passion!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The aroma on this beer is great, unfortunately the flavors weren't as complex. I like my coffee beers to be chocked full of complexities like FBS. However, if you are a coffee drinker it's worth a try, because that's exactly what it tastes like. I actually prefer regular Bender a bit more, with it focusing more on traditional brown ale flavors"
"O: Coffee, coffee and more coffee, sweet and intense without being acrid. This is the perfect accompaniment to a late brunch."
""
""
"Taste integrates the deliciousness of the Bender with a strong coffee flavor...but the coffee never seems bitter or over-the-top. Well done indeed. It is definitely a little one-dimensional compared to Bender, but still delicious. This might just be up there with FBS as one of the best breakfast beers ever. Personally, I like the Bender better, but I can see where serious coffee lovers would find this more to their liking."

"Overall, I don't think I have ever had a beer that has this much coffee flavor. If I tasted this blindly without knowing I was drinking a beer, I would not recognize it as such. I would classify this as a specialty beer for coffee lovers. Maybe I will swap out my morning coffee for this on weekday mornings working for the man."
"Overall: Aroma nails it, flavor doesn`t quite live up. Tasty but not in my top coffee-flavored beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It is what it is - carbonated black coffee with a splash of beer. It's so simple, yet so unbelievably satisfying. Those looking for a more balanced approach to a coffee beer would be better served by FBS or Wake-N-Bake, though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Despite the wonderful aroma and flavor, this beer I guess could benefit from being slightly bigger. Not like Victory at Sea, but in the middle. I could imagine this beer blowing my mind with some bigger malt backbone. So in that sense, it’s disappointing slightly, but at 5.1% ABV, I couldn’t imagine a beer really doing coffee in a brown ale better for its ABV."
"O- Finally, a coffee beer that actually tastes and smells like black iced coffee with no frills or extra flavors. Very drinkable to boot. Not my favorite coffee beer thus far (since I like my coffee with cream and sugar) but man, do they nail that unadulterated coffee flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has my approval, too. I am sure Sheryl likes this. She better. Man, this is good. If you like beer, grab a can. If you like coffee, grab a can. If you like beer AND coffee, grab a case. It's worth it to the last drop. Cheers, coffee craft beer drinkers. Yummy!"

"O - A wonderful beer that manages to blend coffee and beer together in a delicious way. If you're a coffee drinker, specifically espresso drinker, this beer will leave you very happy. Highly recommended. Cheers."
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a mouthfeel of light foam and general smoothness. Closes with medium dryness and astringency from coffee, with little residual stickiness."

"My tastebuds hated my sense of smell. My nose was the one that got the most delicious coffee out of this beer. Despite that, this was still a pretty good coffee Brown Ale. I'd drink it again if given the opportunity again. I know my nose would love it if I got another can."

"Got some fresh cans of this beast. I cracked one in Vegas in the morning in my room because there was no coffee maker present. Damn this stuff is good. Just like drinking straight up black coffee. Thin mouthfeel, which makes it seem more like an iced coffee drink than a beer, which is kinda cool. One of the best brown ales i've had!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.5 - another great beer from one of my favorite breweries; this is a wonderful blend of coffee and beer that settles into a really complex aroma and flavor profile that's as smooth as some of the best iced coffees; I find this beer really refreshing, and I cannot think of another coffee beer that fits this profile; well done as always, Surly!"

"So damn drinkable it's silly. Perfect in warm or cold weather. A nice blend of coffee and a solid base beer. Coffee definitely shines, but Bender isn't lost in the mix."
"Overall: Enjoyable, sessionable, and very flavourful. That's the story of the Surly Bender beers. It goes down easily, is refreshing and a pleasure to drink. Overall I like the Bender better, since that's a beer where the actual hops and malt are showcased, while this one is dominated by the coffee. But I don't mind today when its 86 degrees outside in Wisconsin and I want something refreshing. This happens to satisfy that quota. (4)"

"Coffee Bender pours a dark brown color, with a nice lacing white head. The aroma is similar to that of a cup of coffee. The taste has a very strong profound coffee flavor, very rich. Strong flavor, as easy to drink as a cup of coffee. Overall a very strong coffee beer."

"O: One of my favorite coffee beers. I don't really care too much for the regular bender, but this is a whole different beer. It smells like a french press and tastes like an iced coffee."
"Overall this might be the ultimate coffee beer. If you do not really enjoy a well made cup of coffee, then I would strongly encourage you to not buy this beer. If you do, get it now! In the big picture, this almost doesn't feel like a beer so much as it does a mixed coffee drink, which is why the score, while high, might not match up to the amount of gushing i'm doing here. Still, this is a very unique beer experience which I greatly enjoyed. If I could get this locally I would get it quite often."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is quite a beer. I love coffee beers, though I have only had coffee infused imperial stouts up to this point, which I prefer because there are other elements balancing and enriching the coffee flavor. This is just straight coffee. Would be great in the morning"
"Final Thoughts: I really feel this beer is served well by focusing itself as a brown and not a porter or stout like most coffee beers and I think the slightly milder roasting might have something to do with it. It's just an all around well done beer, but if you don't like coffee, you'll want to pass."

"O- The perfect before noon beer for me and my taste buds. I try to go to the Blue Door Pub every Sunday to get my fix after my morning cup of coffee and the gym. I really appreciate that I can drink more than one of this beer. As opposed to most coffee stouts this is a brown ale and isn't as thick and filling. I may be biased but I love Surly. Cheers"

"O - There is only one coffee beer that tops this, but it is only brewed every 4 years or so. If you like beer and coffee, this is a big coffee beer that you should try."
""
""
"This beer poured out as a deep brown color, might as well be black. The head was tan and creamy looking. There is a thin scattered lacing on the glass with a pretty good retention. The smell of the beer has a great coffee aroma with a subtle malt sweetness in there too. The taste follows the nose, a very nice coffee flavor from start to finish on this beer with a touch of bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth as hell, and has a soft carbonation to it. Overall it's a great beer, no surprise there because it's from Surly. This is a killer brew, well worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This works out to be one of those beers that I'm technically impressed with, but don't particularly enjoy. They've packed an intense amount of coffee flavor into this beer, but it seems to have lost any subtlety or balance it might have had. Ultimately I'm not sure how different this is from taking a cup of cold brew and adding a shot of vodka to it."
""
""
"O - This is a delicious, relatively low ABV beer. The coffee aging adds a pronounced flavor; probably closer to the actual flavors in coffee than most any other beer I have had. There are a few out of place nuances to this beer, almost a staleness, but I would imagine this one is best consumed fresh. My first Surly beer and I am pretty impressed. Drink this if you can get it."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Good stuff, but can I get some beer with my coffee? I love coffee infused beer, but this is more coffee than beer. I would have liked more complexity."

"O - For a light coffee beer, I have had no better."
""

""
""
"Surly really hit the coffee character on the head with this brew. The huge coffee aroma/notes really make you wonder how much coffee they added to this brew, but as long as it tastes good and maintains its beer characteristic/abv I have no problem with that. I really likes the fact that the hops really shine on the finish. This is a unique and drinkable brew that really works. Could this be pulled off by another brewery? Probably not. Try it!"
""
""
""
""

"Edit: Just wanted to add that this beer is 10x better than Founder's Frangelic Mountain."

""
""
"Final Thoughts: I tend to like real coffee and hazelnut flavors in beer, so I like Coffee Bender. However, I don't see why it's a year-round offering. Would I drink it again? Yes, but I wouldn't take it over the regular Bender."
""
"O: One of the best brown ales I've had, especially with the coffee addition lending some complexity. My only real complaint is that I wish it were a big stronger (ABV and taste-wise) to give it some real heft. It would probably be 4.5s across the board at that point. Don't let me take anything away from it, it's still great! Top-notch drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, if I could drink this every day I would! This would be one of the beers I'd like to keep on hand at all times if I could. I'd rate this very close to Founders Breakfast Stout, maybe slightly higher. I love it! So much depth to this! I can't get enough! Damn it I need a Surly local now...FML"
""
"A coffee or a coffee bender in the morning? Me being not a big coffee drinker, I'd take the latter 9 out of 10 times. This would actually make for a legitimate alternative to a coffee any time of the day. This is hands down one of the best beers I've had in a long time. At 5.1% ABV, this packs a punch in every category. The only question I'm left with is why did I only order a 4 pack of this."
""
"I like regular Bender way better than this. The coffee just doesn't work for me - it overpowers the rest of the beer, and the coffee could be smoother and richer. I know lots of people really like this beer, but for me, it's decent, but a bit of a disappointment. Bender plus Coffee could be amazing, but this just isn't. Perhaps my least favorite Surly beer."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color with a reddish hue when held up to the light. Medium, light-tan head that disappears quickly. Scent is quite malty with a hint of coffee. As the beer warms, the coffee makes itself more know. Roasted coffee with some nuttiness as well. Taste is just as it smells. Starts off with a nutty maltiness, then fades to roasted coffee beans. Dark malt finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a very drinkable coffee beer. Very user-friendly to those who don't feel comfortable jumping into a coffee porter or coffee stout. Quality beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Surly compares to a starbucks iced coffee in a can, almost like one of the starbucks energy drinks. A very strong potent smell of coffee and beans, but a very weak beer. It's almost like a light beer with color additive. Overall I would drink it again b/c I am a coffee fan, but I truly believe the ""coffee"" added makes it like left over coffee from the pot in the afternoon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A much better beer than FMB, and perplexing at the same time. Truly very much enjoyed, but wish it was more substantial. This beer reminds me of the direction Breakfast stout should go in flavor, but what FBS makes up for in body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Lots of coffee and a touch of toasted hazelnut upfront. Some roasted malt in the middle followed by some faint raisin skin. A touch of acidity and just a hint of caramel on the finish. Mouthfeel is on the light side, but I like how the coffee works in this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty decent brown ale, but overall I'm not sure it deserves the high rating it holds here on BA. Perhaps I need to spend a little more time with this one, but I am not in love with it."
"O: Well done. I want another and will buy again. i like it better than regular Bender. Not quite Breakfast Stout, so I'm glad I live in MI I guess, but that's comparing apples and oranges. Drinkable and full flavored, sort of a session."
""
""

"Overall. A really nice and easy drinking coffee beer. When I think coffee, I'm used to it being in a pretty big beer. Not the case here, and it works great!"
"O: Very enjoyable, great beer for a wet coast fall day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very good brown ale. Coffee works very well with base brown Bender. Not overpowering coffe just enough."
"O: Bottom line, there is no way I won't load up on these whenever I'm in minny for work. I love how natural this tastes compared to many of the artificially tasting coffee brews I've had before."
""
""
"This is just as advertised and I enjoyed it."
""
"O - Different from any other coffee ale I've had. Maybe it's from Surlys' cold extraction process of the coffee. It just has a natural/organic coffee flavor, not artificial or synthetic. I would definately purchase more of these...if they were sold in Vegas. Either way, Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm not usually a fan of coffee-dominated beers, but the coffee in here is dominant without being too acidic. It makes for a very pleasant coffee experience."
""
""
"O- This was a very flavorful beer that had a very nice coffee taste to it. If you like coffee beers I would definitely recommend this beer. The aroma was very nice and the taste was very good but the finish was slightly too bitter. Very easy to drink, tasty, would love to drink this on a regular basis."
""
"great beer. Glad Surly made this a brown instead of a coffee stout."
"O - Overall this was a very tasty brown ale. The coffee really jumps with this one in the nose and taste. Only complaint would be the coffee overpowers the brown ale aspects of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A pretty nice coffee beer, very tasty and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"If I was a coffee drinker this would be my beer of choice or at least one of the finalists. Surly seems to be doing some pretty good things up there in Minnesota, can't wait to get back and watch the Twins or Vikings choke while I drink some good beers from Surly, Summit and a host of other pretty good breweries in the area."
"O: As an avid coffee drinker (and lover of coffee + coffee flavored things - also, Guatemalan coffee is one of my favorites), I find this beer to be extremely enjoyable. The combination of great flavors along with the lighter body make this beer easy to drink. This beer is definitely sessionable and one that I would thoroughly enjoy drinking many of in a session. Not sure if there is any caffeine in this beer but it almost seems to give a little buzz."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall? An excellent coffee beer. Don't drink it if you don't like coffee."
""
""
""
"Overall: A well designed and executed homage to coffee with a pleasant kick of 5% alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is definitely one of my new favorite coffee beers. I think the brown ale pairs well with the coffee. It's a welcome change from the more traditional stout-coffee pairing."
"O - This is the second beer I have had from Surly and I have definitely been impressed. They did an excellent job balancing the flavors and it tastes damn well close to an iced coffee. I need to try their brown ale now to see what the base beer tastes like before they added the coffee. A great buy."
"Feels like a malty cup of coffee, honestly. I like it. The only thing you can compare it to is maybe Cubano Espresso Brown from Cigar City. Matter of fact, theyre pretty close (and both tasty as hell)."
""
"O - I actually prefer coffee beers over actual coffee. If its possible for coffee to be understated it is here. There is just enough to really enjoy but not too much to overpower the exceptional quality brown ale. If you like this style, porters and/or coffee seek this out. Maybe not earth-shattering but a damn drinkable beer. Wish it was easier/cheaper to find. Good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: cool to have a ""brown"" coffee flavored brew. certainly drinkable, more of an early day beer imo. like i said above, could be hit with even more coffee to be the biggest flavor/aroma factor. right now that and chocolate are pretty much even."
"This brew was incredibly drinkable and didn't sit too heavy. I'm not a huge fan of coffee in general, but I do dig on some coffee beers. Coffee Bender had enough coffee to keep things interesting, but it wasn't overbearing."
""
"Kind of weird and kind of a disappointment. I love Surly and I love coffee beers, but this one isn't for me. A little one note and kind of tastes like cheap coffee as opposed to something gourmet. I'll stick to the regular Bender."
""
""
"O-A must have for coffee lovers, a tad too much coffee for me. Still a wonderful beer."

"This makes for a great ad... “Tired of boring American Brown Ales? Try Surly Coffee Bender. You’ll love it.” Will I? You betcha."
"O. Well blended and balanced. Very nicely done."
""
""
"One of the better coffee beers I've sampled - very aromatic and well balanced with an unexpected delicacy as well. Well worth hunting down."
"D - Brewers did a really good job of combining coffee and brown ale; perfect blend, not too much coffee and not too much mild brown ale malt taste; good stuff!"
"Overall I am kind of glad I didn't love this since I shouldn't get it in the first place. Could have been the sculpin or 120 heightening my hops preception but it wasn't a bad beer overall."
""
"O - Its like a lighter version of Founders breakfast stout. Its pretty one dimensional, but works really well as a coffee infused brown ale. I wish I had another so that I could have drank it out of a mug alongside some bacon and eggs..."
""
"It's an extremely drinkable beer. It's predictable in being a brown ale with coffee, yet it's put together with perfect harmony."
"O: Definitely a good beer, and one you can start your morning with."
""
""
"O - One of my favorite brown ales. The cold steeped ground coffee works to great effect. The coffee flavors are not overpowering, creating a brew that's really smooth from start to finish."
""
"Terrific beer by Surly, the coffee really comes through enhancing an under appreciated style. The balance is held throughout as the bitterness of the coffee delivers just as the caramel and chocolate tone become too sweet. Would be happy to crack another one soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is an interesting beer. It has tons of coffee flavor, but it is thinner than most coffee flavored beers. I like the taste except for the finish. It is bitter, and that bitterness lingers on the palate. I'm glad I tried it but not overly impressed. I prefer the coffee stouts and porters."
"O - A very delicious year round coffee beer from Surly. It is a nice balanced beer that brings a good, balanced coffee flavor. I wasn't the biggest fan of normal Bender; however, I'm a big fan of this and will try to seek anymore. I could see this as a good beer to have first thing in the morning. I don't think I'd have it as much with dessert as it might be a bit light to stand up to some of those richer flavors."
"O: A delicious coffee beer, like rich, strong iced coffee."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pure brown with an average size beige head. Aroma is sweet, nutty, and coffee filled. The taste is much more coffee oriented than anything else. It’s got a coffee and cream type of thing with some cocoa, and roastiness. I guess the iced coffee cited in the description is pretty accurate. I would like to try the regular Bender, so I can taste more of what the coffee aspect did to this Brew. Great for Coffee Lovers."

"The four loko of craft brews? No, just a great brown ale with coffee (caffeine) added."
""
""
""
"Body is medium-thin and carbonation is lively; crisp and dry, refreshing. Not over-the-top in terms of flavor or aroma; just a well-made, very drinkable brown ale with a decent coffee hit."
"O: Very drinkable Coffee infused Brown Ale, I like how the can states, ""Your only dilemma will be whether to finish your day or start it with a Coffee Bender."""
""
""
"Overall I really like this as a coffee beer. The aroma isn't quite as good as the taste. In fact, the aroma is a little lacking when compared to the taste, but the taste definitely makes up for that. This is one that I could, and actually did, have in the morning on one of my days off. Awesome. It's never too early to get Surly! Must try if you like coffee beers. Big thanks to TIMMYJ21 for this in our recent trade! You're awesome Tim!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall; probably the best brown I've ever had... Drinkability is superb, flavors are outstanding... Definitely a winner from Surly and I would drink this daily if I could... I also think it would make one hell of a beer bread..."
"o: pretty nice coffee beer, not my favorite, but up there. wish there was other flavors to compliment the coffee, just too much like a cold cup of coffee to be my favorite."
""
"O: This is more like drinking a cup of coffee than a beer. Don't put this down too late at night or you won't be doing much sleeping. I do wish there was a little something else, the coffee wore on me after a while."

"O: Although lacking in aroma this might be the best brown ale I've had. Very flavorful."
""
""
""

""

"O- Surly has created one of the best brews I have ever experienced. The iced coffee attributes that are cloaked as a brown ale is unyielding. Coffee bender is a brew that I will always want and enjoy. What a brewery, what a beer. How I wish, how I wish they were here. I'd be one lost soul swimming in a bowl of coffee bender year after year"
""
"O - Nice beer overall, expected a bit more with Bender as a base."

"Very unique brown ale. Highly recommended. Another nice Surly brew."
"Overall : this is my favorite coffee flavor brews. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a coffee brew"
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Pours a dark brown with a two-finger light brown head. Mild lacing and retention. Dark roast coffee aroma, hints of sweet cream and vanilla. Flavor profile pretty much follows the nose. Nice sweet and creamy vanilla notes, bit of nuttiness with maybe a touch of hazelnut. Dark, semi bitter coffee beans and a touch of hops balance this one out nicely to close. Everything that is right with a sessionable coffee beer. Really nice way to vamp up this style and one of the better browns out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D-Overall i was very impressed with this beer. If you like coffee beers you will like this one for sure. I was happy to catch a little hops in there as it made it memorable. This is something i would stock up on if i was in MN for sure. ID love to get this one again. Def pick some up if you can."

"Overall: Great coffee brew. Nice medium bodied. Drinkability is really good as much coffee beers are. Highly reccomended to coffee drinkers. Cheers."
"O: This is just a wonderful beer for coffee lovers, as well as anyone who appreciates a very well done infused beer. Coffee haters need not apply - everyone else, you gotta try this one."
""
""
"O - this is a very nice coffee with a beer feeling.. does that make sense?"
""
""
""
"This is a nice malty/coffee beer that is still heavy on the beer character, which I like a lot. It is easy to drink and satisfying."
""
""
""
"This is really damn good. I'm a fan of fresh tasting coffee beans (no stale ones, please) and this delivers. I love that it's a low ABV beer and that this is a Brown Ale base. Considering its one of my least favorite styles, Coffee Bender is seriously making me rethink that."
"Overall, a good try and a well made beer, but underwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"dark dark brown with mahogany highlights. almost-tan head that had pretty good retention and left a little lace. nose is coffee intertwined with toasty, roasty, malty, malt and a kind of chocolate/coffee malted milkshake scent? taste follows suit with a nice chocolate/cocoa character that is sweet, but doesn't translate as anywhere near cloying or out of step. great harmony here. also a pretty healthy hop character that blends right in. hops create a bitter sensation as well that melds with the bitter of the coffee perfectly. the malted milkshake thing comes through in the middle very nicely. medium body that is soft and borders on slick. mild carbonation. abv is undetectable to me. overall, a great twist on an already very very good beer. quite a pleasure."
""
""
"O. A very good beer. Well balanced thickness and chewiness, the flavors are very well balanced and compliment each other well, the coffee is not excessively dominate. A great anytime beer, I might have one with breakfast :)"

"What a great coffee beer. As the name implies, you expect coffee, and that's what you get. Lots of it. The most 'coffee' coffee beer I've tasted. Has the coffee roast bitterness on the finish, but its balanced well by some mild sweetness. Could drink this with breakfast."
"Mouthfeel: Has a great mouthfeel and drinkability. Decent carbonation level and very smooth. Lighter bodied than you would expect, especially since it has such a big coffee flavor to it. Bitter finish on the end. Very good beer, a must for any coffee lover or coffee brown ale fan."
""
""
""
"I've criticized some coffee beers in the past for being more like coffee than beer, and I must admit that Coffee Bender is very close to that line. Yet somehow I love this beer. I think a major reason is that I really love the coffee that they used."
""
"A delicious way to start my beer drinking (morning)."
""
""
""
""
"Cost: $11.99 for a four pack of 16 oz cans."
"Little room for improvement in the mouthfeel and drinkability. Good carbonation level and very smooth. Lighter bodied than one would expect, especially since it has such a big coffee flavor to it. Nice bitter finish as well. Very good beer, a must for any coffee lover or coffee/beer lover."
""
""
""

""
""
"16 ounce can, canned on date of 12/09/11. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch tan head. Both the head retention and lacing are good. Aroma is coffee, roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, and some nuts. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's also a bit of vanilla noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick and is well carbonated. I think this is a pretty good overall brew, I liked it a lot. It's heavy on the coffee in both the aroma and taste, and that's a good thing for me. It's certainly worth trying, I know I'd like to get more of this brew in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"You could probably get away with justifying drinking this with breakfast, it's so coffee-forward. I love this beer."
""
"This may be my favorite out of the Surly beers maybe even my favorite coffee beer. Pours with a billowing tan khaki head and forms fine even lacing down the sides of the glass. Their infusion process really makes the beer, body is a deep dark brown color with ruby highlights. Aroma has dark nutty notes of coffee, with hints of cream and sugar, really it's like the best iced coffee you've ever had with a strong earthy coffee nose. Flavor is excellent the most intense and flavorful coffee beer I've ever tasted, this beer tastes great. Creamed coffee, chocolate, dense creamy vanilla highlights within a dark brown ale just tastes great. Mouthfeel is creamy textured and I'm burping up coffee beans this is an intense beer experience. Mouthfeel is slightly acidic with coffee bean notes, and goes down easy loving every second of it. Drinkability is creamy texture is awesome and the beer that I've dreamt of when it comes to coffee beers thanks again Ryan aka Schlais, if you need anymore White Rajah let me know!"
""
""
""
"Big thanks to Stu for hooking me up with this beer. This is a pretty awesome coffee beer. Definitely the best coffee beer I have ever had. The aroma smells like iced coffee with small hints of chocolate. The beer starts with a nice coffee burst and bitterness at the front of the mouth followed by some sweet milk chocolate notes and more coffee at the middle of the mouth. The finish is very smooth with a big coffee like aftertaste. Very drinkable also. I'd rather have this beer than my morning coffee every day!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Dr: Not really drinkable. More of a tame sipper, which is inexcusable at this low an ABV. I wouldn't have it again, but it's okay for the style. Coffee beer fanatics might be the only ones that will truly like this. Give me a Black Damnation II Mocha Bomb any day of the week, but leave this one be."
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyed it a bit more than regular Bender but still don't find anything about it that stands out. Balanced but not very complex. I'd like to try it again but wasn't extremely impressed this time around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like what the coffee does with this, but i don't like how it erases the caramel and nut influence of standard Bender. Decent, well worth seeking out and drinking regularly, but not as good as the base beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Have been very excited to try this beer. Pours a dark brown color with almost no head. Aroma smacks me in the face with coffee. It smells like iced coffee and coco powder. It is everything I could hope for and more from a coffee heavy beer. Flavor is a bit toO much like a cold cup of coffee. It is very nice, with of course, tons of coffee, a bit of mocha. Very nice, but a bit too much coffee for me here. Mouthfeel could have been a bit fuller, a bit creamier. Mild carbonation. Overall this is a damn good beer, but I am a bit confused by it. Seems much more coffee than beer, but if that is what you are looking for there is nothing better."
""
""
"O: Someone below me said it best “I fucking love this beer” “Very sessionable”. This is a brew I could easily enjoy on a daily basis all winter long. Surly truly did a stellar job with this one and I pray they duplicate it well next year."
""
"O - Really enjoyed this one. It was a nice jolt of fresh coffee to the base beer, which made for a nice enjoyable treat. Looking forward to trying this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A single fingered head formed atop this brownish red beer displaying good retention and some lacing. Roasted coffee notes dominate the smell. Taste follows the smell, literally tastes like fresh coffee beans. Relatively light mouthfeel from this dry brown ale. Overall, I found this beer to be enjoyable, still amazes me how potent the coffee flavors were. I would recommend to friends and will definitely drink again in the future."
"O - This was really good. Very inviting and warming. 5% alcohol and 45 IBUs... really nice balance in flavor and quite sessionable for me. So much different and more pleasant for me than Bender."
""
""
"Coffee Bender though delivers on that promise from wire to wire from the first rich coffee scented whiff to the ultra smooth rich coffee taste that is the closet actual beer I've had to drinking coffee. It is quite incredible what they managed to pull off with this one!"
""
""
""
"O: This is basically the regular ""Bender"" with a nice coffee kick. I dug it!"
""
""
"Overall: Easy drinking beer, with good coffee flavor and sufficient maltiness. Being both a coffee and beer lover, I like all the flavors, but always feel a nagging ""do they need to be together?"" feeling about coffee beers. In this case, it works very well, because the (rich, distinctive) coffee really does play off the base beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is almost exactly like drinking an iced coffee , a little on the thin side but tasty non-the-less , worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/ drinkability- feels at first thin- not in a bad way, just not heavy and filling like some beers. The beer is refreshing because of how well balanced it is. The coffee/roasted taste lingers and is quite pleasant. The complexity deepens as the beer warms and more caramel tones come through."

"Canned 25SEP11 A: dark brown with a transient finger or so of off tan foam which falls quickly to a scattered surface. excellent clarity and spotty lace. (2.5) S: Smells like breakfast coffee. Plain and black with the slightest hint of burnt nuts. Maybe a little bit of a cinnamon tone. (3) T: coffee is present, but seems stale. The beer itself seems a bit stale with a bit of soil and bitterness. Again, a hint of nuts. (2.5) M: Thin with moderate carb and a semi dry finish. Sadly, this so far has been the best part. (3.5) O: Not impressed with this offering. Like the regular version much better. (2.5)"
"Thanks to woosterbill for the cans!"
"Very nice - a bit of an acrid, kind of sharp, hoppiness,... but I liked it. It didn't have as much of a coffee smell that I was expecting. A rich, dark color and a cleaner, yet rich taste. A friend brought some down from MN and was a nice part of the celebration. The mouthfeel was good and proper."
"Overall- Bender with iced coffee is exactly right and the only way to market this beer. What really makes it great is that the coffee never completely dominates. It leaves just enough room for the creamer, hop, and sweet malt character. A really fun and delicious beer."
"O: An amazingly fantastic beer. I couldn't write this damn review quick enough to get back to drinking it. Surly can do no wrong. I have one more offering from them - a year old Smoke - that I'm going to have to fight hard not to drink tonight. Surly kicks ass."
"O- Probably the most coffee forward beer I have had. I really like this and found it better than regular Bender. Very happy that I have more cans, definitely will seek out again."
"O - One of my least favorite Surly beers. I get what they are doing, just wish it had a bit more complexity. If you are looking for an iced coffee with a bit of alcohol then this might be the beer you've been looking for."
"O Nice stuff. Coffee dominates the taste and is great. I like my Surly."
"Also, don't try to compare this to a stout or porter because it's just not. You're doing yourself a disservice with those expectations."
"O- tasty, but not overbearing. Easy drinking and refreshing, which isn't typical of a coffee beer."
"Cheers..."
"O- Never had a brew that can rival an actual cup of coffee. I can probably put this in a coffee mug and drink it all day at work!! Great brew, would defintely have it again and again and again!"
"Overall a pretty good beer. Obviously the coffee dominates, as it's supposed to. Excellent beer for coffee lovers but not overpowering for those who like it less. Light body seems to be at odds with the flavors sometimes. I'd enjoy it more if the coffee was dialed back just a bit to let the brown ale characteristics compliment it better."
"D - this is almost like drinking an iced coffee without some of the bitterness that iced coffees usually have. Really fresh coffee dominates everything about the beer. Recommended if you like coffee, otherwise I would stay away from this one."
"Poured from a can into a wine glass. I bought the four pack this past weekend in Minneapolis. It pours a hazelnut brown in color, pretty light in body, with a one finger beige head that turns to lacing around the glass. The aroma is of very fresh coffee grounds with light chocolate. The grounds are very pungent and bitter. It's not very complex and is on the verge of being completely one dimensional. It's just so much ground, yet not much actual coffee. The flavor too is in your face coffee grounds with some slight sweet roasted malt and a light bitter finish. It's ok, and easy to drink, but it's just ok. I just wish it had more complexity. It drinks light and you can tell it's built for a can the way it poured and due to how light it is. Overall it's just an ok brown ale without much complexity. I'd say this is the first beer from Surly I'm not overly impressed by."
"Overall, a good coffee beer. I think I prefer the regular bender to this one though."
"Overall, I do love this beer. It perfectly combines 2 of my favorite styles: brown ales and coffee stouts/coffee ales. Highly recommended...just wish they distributed outside of MN."
"Overall...I love this beer. The fact it's a brown ale lets the coffee shine, unlike some heavy handed coffee stouts. Thanks to LostCook for bringing this back for me. I missed out on trying this when I was in MN. Never again."
"This is for folks who like some beer with their coffee. This is like nothing else I have had. A true ""coffee"" beer. Outstanding and well worth the price and shipping."
"O: A good coffee beer that really grew on me. I really like how the good Brown Ale characteristics come through and blend with the coffee. Nothing seems overpowering with this brew."
"O - I like this and my wife likes it even better. She'd probably give it one higher grade. I've not had a bad Surly beer yet. Good stuff."
"O - This is an incredibly drinkable, bold ale that shows great characteristics of the style alongside some nice coffee and espresso notes. Next time I'll be grabbing a 6-er of this stuff."
"O - big coffee flavour lives up to the suggestion on the can, that does take away from the brown ale aspect but that is not an inconvenience here ... unless you're not a coffee fan"
"O: This is the first time trying this beer offering from Surly and I would have to say that it did not disappoint. I was expecting the coffee to overpower any brown ale beer taste but it merely enhanced a style that I already really love. I would definitely drink this one again."
"O- An enjoyable beer. My brother and I split a 4 pack on the night I reviewed this. I little spendy in my eyes for a 4 pack (equivalent in oz. to a 5 pack) but good nonetheless."
"Who's your fuckin' daddy? This shit is SO good. Seriously though.... Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours a rich, dark brown with a nice cappuccino like head. The nose is straight black coffee. It's such a lovely scent. The taste is just...outstanding. Very coffee forward flavor with a slight hint of cherry. This is so slick. I love this. The mouthfeel is a bit thing and acidic. The coffee and slight bit of cherry lingers throughout the finish. Overall, this is a marvelous beer. I wish I had regular access to this. Good shit."
"D - while this one left a bit to be desired in the mouthfeel and taste department it is very drinkable overall - thin body and light carbonation make it go down easy with a nice light, coffee/candy bar flavor; what's not to like right?"
"O: another win for the Surly boys. I really really like it. A- to A beer."
"Overall this is a truly well done and interesting brew. Whether you like the coffee flavor or not is obviously individual. I really liked it and will being drinking this on many a fall/winter Sunday morning. Skol Surly, cheers!"
"Pours a nice dark brown with this tan head which persists. Smell is unmistakeably coffee. It actually smells more like coffee than beer. It was difficult to detect any hoppiness, malt or any other beer characteristic. The taste is a bit more balanced than the nose. Behind the coffee is a well balanced brown ale (though I wish I had sampled the regular Bender so that I would have had a base from which to understand how much of the original shines through). The mouthfeel was a touch thin. Overall it is an interesting beer, though a bit one-dimensional, I would have preferred a bit more balance rather than the coffee taking such an overwhelming role."
"This ended up reminding me of some kind of coffee-flavored soda. Not bad, but not particularly good."
"D/O: While this beverage represents a remarkable showcase for honest coffee qualities, it is fairly mediocre as a brown ale. Its beer qualities remind of Sierra Nevada Tumbler, a little too dry to be compelling. Expect it to lose some of its coffee focus as it warms, becoming more like a beer but still fairly lacking in distinct qualities."
"The mouthfeel is slightly less than medium bodied with average carbonation. Pretty drinkable for the given level of coffee flavor. Overall, a good brew, but the standard Bender is better in my opinion. The complexity is ok, but not great. Still worth having one or two."
"Very much a coffee beer, its not bad, but a big to heavy handed with the coffee for my taste."
"Drinkability: Solid. 4.3 if i could so I'm rounding up a bit."
"(O) Very quality brew. This is one of those that is a treat to enjoy as it needs to be shipped in from out of state."
"This is THE coffee beer. If you love both, you'll enjoy this."
"O: A top-notch brown ale with a great coffee-infused flavor. Drinks way too easily."
"O: What a great beer. While the nose slightly disappointed me the taste and drinkability more than made up for it. Nicely integrated flavors and no taste overpowered the other."
"Overall - Very tasty coffee flavored brown ale. Glad I got a chance to try it. Surly makes awesome beers."
"Overall, I gave it good smell and taste scores as it does deliver the coffee but, for me, the lack of other non-coffee flavors really limits my enjoyment of it. If I want straight coffee, I'll brew up a batch. Needs more balance. Not available here in TX - got from Ummagum who got it at the brewery during his last MN trip. Rotation - glad I tried it as it's been on my list of ones I really wanted to try but one is enough for me except if I could try on-tap. [N;O]"
"It pretty much dominates the flavor. Some sweet caramel at first, but the nuttiness of the Bender thwarted by the coffee. And this coffee seems thin. Too bad, some nuttiness would provide some more smoothness. Seems a bit hollow, and not like a Brown ale much at all. Still, it's not a bad beer...just not a two-canner for me"
"o-great mainstay of the Surly line up. Was really impressed with the balance between coffee and brown ale."
"O- A very, very good brown. I find it significantly tastier than regular Bender. Just a bit more body and it would be tremendous."
"This one was shared by StayWhatYouAre2 with beeruser, funkydelic, 67couple, others, and myself at a recent tasting graciously hosted by beeruser! Served from can into a Duvel Parra tulip. Poured a deep dark brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, cream, coffee, and subtle caramel. The flavor was of roasted malt, coffee, subtle caramel, and cream. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a very good brew. I had been wanting to try this one for quite some time and finally got the chance. I was not disappointed at all in this one. I don't even drink coffee and loved this thing. Can't imagine how much more I would have enjoyed it had I been a coffee drinker. Really worth trying and the effort to get your hands on it. Nice job Surly!"
"O- I personally really enjoyed this offering. I could see how the coffee could be overpowering if you're not into it though. I'll definitely buy again, and I'd recomend this to any heavy java drinker. Perfect fall beer."
"O- An above average brown ale. The coffee addition is nice for a change of pace."
"Overall- This is one of the most elegant, flavorful, and impressive beers I have had in the 5% abv range. I can drink these all night long in any kind of weather."
"O – A tasty brew that’s almost more akin to a carbonated iced-coffee than a beer; but that’s still delicious in my book."
"Received in trade from GPHarris, thanks for the opportunity! Pours a deep brown with garnet highlights when held to light. Tightly bubbled beige head shows moderate retention and lace. Smells like freshly ground coffee beans mostly. I try to find something else in the aroma but the coffee is overpowering my olfactory system. Taste really follows the aroma. Upfront I get bitter roasted coffee, midway through I get a hint of sugary sweetness (cream maybe?) finish is a long lingering acridic roasted coffee. Did I mention this tastes like coffee. Medium body and carbonation level, acridic bitter mouthfeel. I will preface this by saying I don't drink coffee. I enjoy some beer with coffee flavors or with coffee added, but this one is to far over the top for me. I can't find the beer underneath the coffee. One and done on this one."
"Basically, this beer was bender hiding behind a bunch of fine coffee. I was hoping for something more like bender with the coffee subtlety just a little more accentuated, but instead it was overwhelming (perhaps the most straight up coffee taste) coffee with the subtleties of bender hiding deep behind the flavor. Not bad, and if you love coffee much preferable, but basically just bender with a twist that isn't necessarily praiseworthy. If I could only choose one, still stick with classic bender."
"O - Taste is disappointing, compared to the rest of the brew... Worth finding and giving it a shot. Thanks for the trade David!"
"o - this beer isn't trying to fool you, it's coffee all the way. good stuff."
"O: Great coffee infused beer. If you want a beer with just the coffee flavors and non of the stout qualities many coffee infused beers have, this is the one!"
"O: The beer is deceptive in that it has strong aromas and flavors of coffee beans for not that full of a body, but this also makes it very easy to drink and go down very easily. I would have no problem drinking several of these in one sitting, although it would probably to do so in the afternoon or you’ll be up all night with a coffee buzz."
"O - Very good brew with delicious coffee notes that are not too overwhelming. Great overall and all around. Great version of Bender that IMO is more enjoyable."
"O - A nice lighter coffee beer. Stout like flavors without the heft."
"A really great beer. I like the coffee flavour here which is the star of the show without being a diva. Really nice."
"Pours a medium brown with some lacing and a ring of head. TONS of coffee hits in the nose even after it's semi aged. Most coffee I've ever smelled in a beer before. kind of mono dimensional in the nose, but I have to say it's pretty wild how much flavor is packed in. The taste has some lactose and brown sugary notes but after that its all coffee all the way. Medium mouth with lots of roast."
"Narrative: “I just don’t understand why the early Seinfeld episodes look\ so dated, look at what they are wearing-” Uncle Adam droned on. “Keep it together Jonah, keep it together” he told himself as he clicked the rhythms from Vengaboys songs along his jaw line. He didn’t exactly mean to supplement all of his caffeine habits with coffee alcohol but, such is the way of things. “Jonah are you cold? You’re positively shaking!” Aunt Beatrice exclaimed grabbing an afghan rug. “Yeahbut you know who really- I mean always touching the thermostat? Who says that? Seinfeld, you know what I meanyeahyeah, notevencoldthough seriously.” He attempted to break his repartee into at least dactylic hexameter for his relatives to try and understand. Jonah was a man converted to the alcoholic coffee beast, and now he was dropped as though he should have invented the rain coat."
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the watery side...oh wait. i'm reviewing a brown ale. Forgot that this wasn't a stout for a second. For a brown ale, expectional. Coffee stout brewers take note, this is how you do it. This is not only a great example of coffee in beer, but also how to make an already great beer greater. Still waiting on the Bender experience, but I can tell I'm in for a treat."
"This was enjoyable but in my opinion did miss in some areas to make this a tremendous beer. (Needs more of a kick)"
"An excellent Brown Ale. The coffee is part of the supporting cast and is not the star of the show like some other coffee beers. Exceptionally tasty and drinkable."
"Overall: For me this is a breakfast beer. I think this would go perfect with my eggs and bacon or some biscuits and gravy. I really like the flavor and hope to get my hands on some more soon"
" Overall I loved this beer. Big coffee in this which I love! Just to damn bad I cant get this all the time. If youenjoy coffee in your beers Get ahold of some of this for sure."
"Beer pours a dark brown color with nice sized tan head. Tremendous lacing throughout. smell is big coffee, complete with cream. Taste is just like Surly describes it: great iced coffee flavor. Slight chocolate notes, but mostly just that nice taste of fresh roasted iced coffee. A tad bit dry like black coffee. Nice light mouthfeel that goes perfect with the taste. I'm a huge fan of coffee beers and only recently have had low ABV brown ales brewed with coffee, and I have to say it's a refreshing (literally) change from big, huge coffee stouts at this time of year. The big difference between this one and a lot of coffee beers is it tastes more like ""brewed"" coffee, whereas others seem to taste more like the beans themselves. Summer is when I switch from hot coffee to iced coffee and this is the perfect ""dark"" summer brew. I've heard great things about Surly and this first offering lived up to expectations."
"Good but not great, got some other surly beers to try in the coming week"
"Pours deep brown with a touch of red and a medium tannish head. Looks good. Smells straight up like strong cold coffee. Pretty substantial, with only a hint of malts or anything else. The taste is basically just a carbonated cup of cold coffee with a slight bit of malt sweetness. Tastes shockingly like coffee. Not really anything else going on, Medium thin on the body with good carbonation, seems a bit light for the coffee flavor. This beer is really interesting, but the beer element is lost. It's like drinking a cup of cold coffee that has had enough sweetener added to make it not too bitter. Kind of tough to grade. Would have again, though not a favorite."
"Cheers!"
"O-This is a great coffee beer and I feel it's better than the original Bender. It's a great beer with an outstanding flavor profile along with great balance. Easily one of my favorite beers right now. I could easily drink this daily and wish I lived in MN so I could get it more often."
"Pours an almost opaque dark reddish-brown color with a 1 inch khaki head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Smells of dark malts and coffee grounds fresh from a machine. Taste is of carbonated black coffee and maybe some dark malt. Extremely coffee forward with a lingering bitterness on the palate. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the coffee overpowers any other smells or tastes that may be present in this beer."
"I tend to love beers with coffee added but this one was just gross. I guess I could have gotten an off can but I tend to think this beer is just not for me so take this review as you will."
"canned 6-8-11, opened on 6-29-11. Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a barely cloud dark brown color. about 2 fingers of off-white head recedes down and leaves only a ring surrounding the glass. Smell- iced coffee, straight up. Hard to smell anything else here. Maybe some mocha notes as well, but this one is all about the coffee. Taste- roasty espresso, dark coffee flavors here. A little sweetness from the malt. Am I drinking coffee, or beer here? Very hard to tell, only thing that really sets them apart is the carbonation. Mouthfeel- nice, silky, smooth. Drinkability- if you love coffee, you will love this. If you don't love coffee, I can't see how this could possibly be enjoyable. But, I love coffee, so there you go. Nice job Surly."
"O- very solid brown ale. I haven't had the regular Bender to compare, but I'm a fan of this"
"Pours a dark brown color, letting some light in around the edges, cap of stiff creamy off-white head with decent retention. Scent is of fresh brewed black coffee on top of a carmely sweet and nutty brown ale base. Taste is a bit deeper then nose lead towards, coffee is fresher, more bean then brewed, and mingles perfectly with a rich nutty, light chocolaty, fresh grain and malty sweet brown ale base. The hallmark of Surly beers continues to be the smooth creamy body all of their beers acheive and the oats in this beer only continue to contribute to that. Overall, well balanced between coffee and brown ale."
"O - Overall, this one was a homerun for me. I think I said it in a past review, but I've been in love with everything from Surly that I've tried. This is a very flavorful and easy drinking beer. Like my new mug says, ""It's never too early to get Surly."" I could seriously see myself drinking this with breakfast."
"overall: as a lover of coffee beers, this is definatly at the top of my list. one of the more memorable beers of the night, which included almost the whole surly lineup, including darkness, four, and smoke."
"O: I really like the beer and would probably select it over the original Bender, but just barely. They present different features, both good, but the coffee flavor is very well done and very enticing."
"O- Decent. Not great as I had hopes for, but it did save face in the end. I look forward to trying regular Bender to get a better grasp on the base beer before trying this again"
"I'm really digging this beer right now. It's not too thick to drink in the summer. Should make for a great early morning camping beer."
"Liked this one quite a bit. I was expecting the coffee to be a little bit stronger in this one, but that would've taken away its insane drinkability so I can't complain. Surly needs to find a way to make their selves available in SoCal. They continue to impress me, and I expect the impressing won't end any time soon."
"Overall this is a great beer. Much better than anticipated. Normally I wouldn't buy a canned beer. This beer by no means screams out "" drink me, I'm delicious"" like alot of bottle beers do. In fact my wife thought I was drinking a root beer. But thanks to Dearthvader for the gift I got to experience and enjoy this lovely canned beer."
"Extremely drinkable, call this one ""Founders Breakfast Stout Light"" ... or FBS Lite... whatever, you get the picture. Great beer, here."
"Coffee Bender is a great beer on a warm summer afternoon or on a colder fall evening great for all occasions."
"O- so after reading this is billed as a brown ale, I'm quite impressed as I thought it was a porter...!"
"Really nice beer! After drinking both Bender and Coffee Bender in consecutive nights, both are great examples of a flavorful and aromatic brown ale, something that can be hard to find at times. I look forward to trying some more Surly offerings if / when I get the chance."
"Thanks to bstyle for leaving this pounder behind!"
"O- Very drinkable. This was my second beer from Surly and it was another success in my book. I just wish I could go down the street to my local liquor store and pick up a 4 pack of any of their stuff (especially abrasive). Another great job Surly!!!!"
"Another solid Surly brew. I think while the original Bender does lend itself to some coffee flavors with the coffee additions here you lose a lot of that great mouthfeel from the oats and a sort of tart bitterness takes over. Would definitely have another but would prefer to stick to the original really."
"Overall, I prefer bender. They are both great brown ales, however the coffee takes over a lot of the nuances in bender."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one, def one of my favorite ""coffee"" to date, at $11.50/4pack it might carry a little heavfty of a price tag though.."
"A lighter, more drinkable beer with a great coffee profile. I like that it is 5% ABV and you could easily pick up a pack and drink a few. I am used to very big stouts infused with coffee but this breaks that trend for me."
"This was an odd beer for me that reminded me of a homebrew brown ale I added coffee to just to see which process for adding the coffee worked best. This beer was very drinkable, but the coffee and beer did not seem to meld together. You tasted the coffee and then the brown ale, as opposed to some of the better coffee stouts where the flavors blend in together and you get a more cohesive flavor profile. Carbonation and mouthfeel were good, nice and dry and drinkable as well with good body for the style. The nose was coffee, slight roastiness/toasty grains, and no hop aroma. Overall I would like to try this one again, maybe then I'll 'get it'."
"O - Overall Surly gets an A for effort. I'd drink this again and I'd recommend it to others, but I'm thinking there's a reason that you don't see too many coffee-flavored brown ales. It's good, but won't win any awards."
"Love the CB and always have a few in the fridge."
"O - I enjoyed this one, but not as much as I thought I would. The coffee is not the star in this beer but rather a player of many in this brown ale. Great brown ale, but I feel like they missed the mark with the coffee a little bit."
"o: I've only had 2 brews from surly though both have been utterly fantastic. Glad I got to try this and hope I can acquire some more sometime soon."
"O: Love it and the name serves it well. If I were coming off a bender this beer would be ideal. Definitely worth seeking out from the MN BAs although it is a bit pricey."
"This is morning breakfast beer right here, lots of great fresh brewed morning coffee without a giant big stout like body. Superior win right out of the gate."
"Overall- Really just muddled. If it's going to be s coffee beer it might as we'll go for it. The hops don't play nice in my book. Just missing a little something."
"Overall: Again, I'm a sucker for this style. I love the balance of this beer and I really hope that I'm able to get some more in the future."
"O- Very nice beer, easy drinkability, if you love coffee this will hit the spot. Love the coffee taste mixed with the sweet maltiness, very well balanced. Highly recommend trying this at least once."
"This beer pours a beautiful dark brown with a small light tan head. The smell of this is pure coffee as you might expect. A little bit of sweet notes but pretty much all coffee. The taste is really great on this. Lots of coffee but not as much as the smell would suggest. Just a great brown ale with a compliment of coffee. Good carbonation and and a good medium body. Overall a very tasty coffee brown that I would drink all the time if I was in Minnesota."
"D - Very drinkable. The added coffee flavors are really strong and excellent on top of the brown ale. Everything feels right in place and mixes very well together."
"O ~ It is Surly. Always worth trying, and continual replenishment!"
"Overall: This beer improved on Bender and I really enjoyed it. Good coffee flavors and very drinkable. Worth seeking out if you enjoy coffee infused beers."
"Poured from a can into my ccb pint glass. Dark brown in appearance with a paper thin head. Aroma is all coffee, wow, so much coffee. Taste follows the nose, coffee takes over and knocks out the complexity of bender. Light carbonation and somewhat thick. Coffee bender isn't as good as it's big brother. The coffee takes away from what makes bender so complex. I like coffee beers, this one just might be a little too much"
"O - I would drink it again. For the price and the alcohol content, it's a tasty beer to not get blasted off of."
"D- the coffee comes through with such strength that it almost seems like a novelty beer. i dont think i could have more than a partial can without getting sick of it. its exactly what the brewer had in mind, its just not really my thing. check it out if you cant seem to get enough coffee."
"Now I really want to try the regular Bender. I also find myself wishing that Surly would commission this recipe for a clone kit through Northern Brewer. While I don't like using kits anymore, I'd likely buy a Coffee Bender clone kit in a heartbeat."
"Overall - its unlike any brew I've had in San Diego. I'm very impressed."
"However, overall the beer is an average sampling in my book. I would definitely try it again, recommend it to a friend, and could easily sip this beer all day."
"D: This is extremely drinkable. Very flavorful, very well balanced, no hint of alcohol, and an appropriate mouthfeel make this really easy to put down. I'd have another one or two if I had any more of this. Delicious!"
"The mouthfeel is a touch watery, but the carbonation is spot-on. And the drinkability is absolutely exceptional, this is very easy to drink. This is just a super solid coffee beer. It's not a stunner, but absolutely a delicious, solid brew. Highly recommended."
"This is a great low ABV beer for coffee lovers. Unfortunately, I am not a coffee lover hence the low ranking here. Poured from fresh can into a tulip glass. Pours a dark brown body with a few reddish hues. Inch thick, dense and creamy, brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma has lots of fresh coffee up front. When this warms up a bit, some nice roasts, caramels, and toffee brown malts come out. A light chocolate, nuts, and vanilla. Flavor is similar. Lots of fresh, espresso coffee with a nice, rich brown maltiness. Caramel, chocolate, roast, vanilla, some biscuit, and a light earth. Finishes dry and lightly bitter with lots of coffee and a nice earthy roast. Lengthy aftertaste following a medium, somewhat watery body at times and a moderate, creamy carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, same as the original Bender but the flavors are exponentially better in this beer. Overall this is one of the three best coffee beers I have ever had. Maybe a bit too tilted to the coffee side but the drinkability is off the charts especially for the ABV. Sessionable, definitely. Recommended, definitely. If I was given the choice of this compared to the original Bender, I would take this 10 times out of 10."
"Overall this is one of the finest and most unique coffee beers I have ever had. I can safely say that this is also the only sessionable coffee beer I have ever seen and would love to seek this one out again."
"O: A very pleasant, supremely refreshing, sessionable coffee beer if there ever was one. Glad I bought two 4-packs instead of one; I'll be ordering this again very soon."
"Overall: A very solid ale that almost seems more iced coffee than a beer. A very interesting and tasty brew."
"O: I wish I lived closer than six hours to MN so I could get this beer more often. It's absolutely delicious, and may be one of the best year-round beers anywhere. Easily up there with Two Hearted. Really nothing to complain about with this great offering from Surly."
"Overall if you like coffee- you need to try this. If you like flavored, fake coffee--stay away."
"M/D: very carbonated, had an interesting iced coffee thing going on. The coffee flavor did not seem to be of the highest quality, but it was still tasty nonetheless."
"Pretty good beer. Easy to drink for sure, and I like that it's in cans."
"D - I would have another one but I wouldn't seek this out on a regular basis. Tasted too much like an iced coffee."
"O: Overall, not a bad beer, but almost indistinguishable from a typical coffee stout. I pick up on a slight nuttiness in the finish, but that's about the only brown ale characteristic this beer has. You could put it in a lineup of coffee stouts and likely not be able to pick it out. As a brown ale, it's almost unrecognizable and as a coffee stout it doesn't really stand out from the pack."
"Somehow the addition of coffee seems to have taken away a bit of Bender's complexity. It's neither the best coffee beer or the best brown, but the can is still disappearing down my maw pretty quickly."
"O: Really good light flavor of coffee that isn't overpowering or too potent. Tastes just like an iced coffee. Thanks again Chris!"
"O: Another solid beer by Surly. This is average to above average. Nothing here really wows me but then again, there is nothing to complain about either."
"O - If I could get my hands on this, I would be all over it. This beer is super tasty. It combines two of my three favorite beverages in one can, and does a fine job of it. The abv is also low enough to make this a beer you could have a few of in a session. I would love to take this camping, would be a great way to start the post dinner camp fire huddle."
"Mouthfeel is the same as Bender (slightly watery, smooth and with creamy moments) but with these flavors it works so much better. Drinkability is helped a great deal by the balance on the coffee, as it isn't just raw beans with no sweetness added - the caramel and toffee from the nose mist be doing it, even if I can't pick them out specifically on the tongue. Great, great beer, and a confirmation of why Surly has the reputation it does."
"Overall maybe this style just isn't up my alley. A tasty beverage at any rate. Definitely recommended."
"The highlight was the overall smoothness of the beer, it's good, but as far as coffee beers go not one of the best. Not much complexity."
"The CPJ"
"If I want a coffee beer I would chose a coffee stout instead of this. The brown ale and coffee just seems like an odd pairing to me. Not my cup of tea at all. The only beer from Surly that I have disliked thus far."
"D: Enjoyable for its style. The coffee is slightly overpowering but I was still glad to try a tallboy of it."
"M,D: Warms real well in the glass, creamy and rich on the palate. Very drinkable."
"D: Pretty good. A little more watered-down than you'd expect, but decent flavors for the lower alcohol."
"D- Damn fine beer, if I didn't have an aversion to caffeine I think I could down a few of these. Compared to a couple years ago I really get the balance in this beer."
"D: A very nice blend of flavors with a light body that makes this beer quite easy to drink and enjoy."
"Smooth and substantial in the mouth, not some some of the thinner ABAs I have had. All around a solid brew, and my first from Surly."
"quite drinkable. nice to see a beer that infuses coffee without being over the top with alcohol and flavor. nicely done, very well balanced. probably my favorite coffee beer ive had to date."
"Poured from a 16 ounce can into an Efes tulip. Moderate beige head sticks around for a moment atop a murky dark brown body. Sticky, soapy and mainly clear lacing lines the glass. Aroma includes malty sweetness, coffee, caramel and a touch of chocolate and vanilla. Taste is loaded with good things happening. Coffee dominates but again, notes of chocolate, vanilla and maybe praline. Really impressive."
"D - I could do 2 in a row at max. But I will be picking it up next time I see it."
" The mouth feel is my only slight complaint. It's just slightly more carbonated than i would like and slightly on the thin side but again, very small complaints. This beer is very drinkable and over all pretty tasty."
"Drinkability: One of the few times I don't think coffee makes a beer better. I find it a little bit overwhelming, especially in the aroma. Maybe it was the type of coffee that I just did not connect with."
"Coffee Bender pours out a very dark shade of brown appearing mudy black with a inch or so of bright tan semi mocha colored foam that left some stickies. This smells like some dank ass coffee and tastes like it as well. A nice roast in the middle finished by more coffee. Beans upon beans. A hint of vanilla and a bit of nuts so the base brown is not completely lost butnthis one is all about the coffee. Feel is very slick and feels thicker than it is with all that roast. About lightish in body with a ample carb. This is a lighter version of breakfast stout with a lower ABV making it much more drinkable. This one is a winner."
"Drinkability: This is a great beer, and definitely one which will appeal to the coffee fans among us. This beer seems to have a lot going for it, and i would certainly seek out future trades for more!!"
"D/O- Very drinkable brown ale, even with the coffee flavors."
"D: I love this beer. Another great brew from Surly not much else to say. If you are a fan of coffee beers this beer should be on the top of your list."
"I love coffee, even more so i love beer. was kinda nervous that i was going to be upset with such a mix but knowing the Surly's rep i figured id give this coffee bender a crack.I was W.O.R.N.G. this was a supurb balace of beer and coffee flavor. not sure how this works but it was acully very refresing wich isnt the first thing that come to mind when i think about coffee. this could very easily replace lineys berry as my new moring beer. this beer opened up a new ave for me to try diffrent beers Great work and cheers to the lads at Surly."
"Another winner from Surly."
"Other brews might fulfill your coffee-mocha-chocolate longings better, but this is one great beer. It is a Surly, so I guess you expect that."
"Overall a very nice brown ale if you love coffee. Not your typical brown ale by any means. Very nice."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Drinkability - I like it, I would definitely have another, but I don't know about more than one more. I feel like I'd fill up on this pretty quickly, given the flavours and the heavier mouthfeel."
"D - A unique beer. Definitely had its brown ale characteristics which is a nice change from typical coffee-infused porters and stouts."
"D- yes I would like to go on a bender with this bad boy. I enjoyed its base beer very much but this one is amazing. So easy to drink but you could spend hours on it picking it to pieces. One of my new favs. Damm surly not a bad beer yet."
"This is a fantastic beer for 10:30 am on a Sunday! I want more! If you like brown ales or coffee-- or both-- you must try this beer!"
"Much thanks to Justin for this extra! Poured gently for a 1-finger head, reduces quickly to thin film, and has that familiar smooth Surly lacing! Color is deep brown. Aroma of very fresh roasted ground coffee beans....and that's it. Taste is exactly the same, with maybe a touch of chocolate. This is certainly different from any other coffee beer I've ever drank. It's like an iced coffee! I'm not sure anything else can be said. This is a smooth session beer for those that are obsessed with coffee like myself."
"Overall it is a nice beer. Enjoyable and not overly aggressive."
"Thanks Jon!"
"And there's the coffee! The initial taste is still chocolate malt, but the coffee bitterness jumps in and finishes strong. The transition from dark malt to coffee bitter is smooth and well done."
"As a beer geek and a coffee nut, I could drink this all day. I've definitely had it with my breakfast before. It's lighter than a coffee stout, and as a result significantly more drinkable."
"D - It's solid, but not that interesting. If I were local, I can see it being better than my average local, but I probably wouldn't seek it out again. But it's very easy to drink in general, didn't have any problem putting this one away."
"D:This was so tasty and easy to drink I couldn't get enough of it, had take it away from my woman because she wasn't gonna volunter to give it back after a taste. If you dig coffee search this one out"
"Medium bodied with some tight carbonation up front that smooths out mid-palate. Very roasty wiu a huge coffee bean presence but this beer is never to acrid or dry. There is planety of rich chocolate maltiness as well as some caramel, toffee and nut to balance things out. Well balanced, complex, delicious and very quaffable. Recommended, especially for breakfast!"
"D - Really easy to drink. I wouldn't mind drinking this in the morning with my breakfast. Its not quite coffee and its not quite beer, but a nice mixture of the two. If you're a coffee drinker, this is right up your ally."
"Drinkability: Very high. This is a coffee lover's beer as the name suggests. This isn's an espresso bomb at all, rather the coffee is very nicely integrated with 'Bender' which is a fabulous brown ale of it's own right. Thankfully it's readily available to me down the street at my neighborhood liquour store."
"D - Drinkability is high. An incredibly balanced coffee beer that brings a ton to the table. Easy to drink and very enjoyable. I could imagine tailgating with this all morning if only I could find it around here!"
"D: Absolutely loved this one. The only beer I know of rivaling this one in the coffee dept is Terrapin's Wake n Bake. A must try for anyone that enjoys coffee."
"Notes: Pretty good. Very intense coffee tastes. A bit too carbonated and light in body though. The intense coffee flavors feel a bit out of place without a nice full mouthfeel to back them up. This is a beer that I'm very glad I tried, but I wouldn't jump through hoops to get more of it."
"Delicious! And highly drinkable. A perfect way to start a Sunday morning."
"D: For this style and flavor profile this is about as drinkable as they come. I could easily session this delicious coffee brew!"
"m/d-A bit watery but counter balanced with the bitterness. Slides down the gullet quite easily, but leaves a bit of an unpleasant overly bitter drying vibe in my mouth which fades to a much more pleasant chocolate bar feel."
"Pours incredibly dark. A bit of head but fairly settled. Not too carbonated. Smells strongly of coffee and malt. Very pleasant on the nose. Definitely tastes like coffee coffee coffee... not much else to it. The malt profile peaks through a hair but the coffee overpowers. Great smooth mouthfeel but overall not much of a brown ale taste through the overly coffee flavoured beer"
"D - The acidic coffee bitterness hangs around for awhile, but I could definitely pound a few of these back to back."
"D: Very redrinkable. I bought a 4 pack of it and I guarantee it won't be the last 4 pack I buy of it. The first one tasted like more. One of the best dark beers I have ever had."
"(66th)"
"Reveal is.... Surly Coffee Bender!... wait.. really? Huh... I was expecting something... I don't know... better?"
"This beer pours a nice reddish brown color with a good finger of coarse beige foam to top it off. The aroma is damn fine. For obvious reasons the main aroma is a robust coffee, but surprisingly I was able to detect a bit of flower notes from the hops as well as a nice caramel glaze and some brown sugar. The taste has the distinct notes of coffee in it almost as the one and only flavor. The background notes to the palate are some aggressive hop bitterness that I must admit doesn't really work here however, if you can tell your mind that this is just an alcoholic strong coffee (not moonshot, lol) it actually goes down rather smoothly. The body is a lot thinner than I would have imagined it being, but this beer is still a damn fine drinking beer. It was initially too strong for me but honestly the more I drink it the more I really am loving it. A really nice beer. God I wish we still had Surly down in Chicago."
"I have to laugh at the fact Surly classifies this as a 'Brown Ale'. I've had reputable porters with less balls than this. This is one pronounced and articulate coffee infused ale for sure. Not one tasty facet of this brew tastes contrived or out-of-balance. Imagine a roasty, chocolatey, coffee inspired beer of your dreams, and you've got it right here - in spades!"
"D - For a coffee beer I could drink a lot of this. Very easy drinking beer. Definitely more than a coffee Stout or Porter."
"D- This stuff has to stay on my wants list. I could have used a second can."
"D- Good drinkable beer. Gets a little boring halfway through with the flavors to it. I would prefer a stout rather than brown ale with coffee where there seems to be more substance to it. Still not bad, could drink more if had some."
"It's also low enough in the ABV to sip morning noon and night and the fact that it's secretly still a wonderful brown ale under all that coffee makes it uber drinkable."
"Poured into a shaped pint with a chestnut brown body and a big foamy tan head that leaves good lacing and a nice ring of foam in the glass. Smells nutty and like ground roasted coffee, slightly bitter. Tastes like cocoa and hazelnut with roasted coffee. Slightly acidic/bitter and creamy sweet. Feels viscous due to moderate carbonation and it has a thicker body. Very nice drinking and very tasty, glad to have a few more of these to enjoy!"
"Smells like a dark roasted coffee and a can of mixed nuts. Which pairs pretty good imo. How does Surly maintain the complexities of Bender yet still add all of that rich coffee flavor? It doesn't matter to me...What does matter is that this is one tasty beer. Sweet malts. Pecans and walnuts. And of course a big fat cup of joe. Smooth mouthfeel maybe to thin for some but it's a 5% beer. So I feel it's supposed to be thin. Very easy to drink. I love coffee beers and this one is right up there with the best of them."
"D-- Very drinkable, easy to have two or three. it is on the thin side but it is quite good. Not as much coffee as had hoped but very workable."
"If only it made me younger and not sore from football. Then it'd really be a beer."
"Overall, one of the best browns out there. Many browns are bland, Coffee Bender has solved that problem."
"D: drinks well for a coffee ale. I tend to find my taste buds burnt after one, but I could easily have 2 of these guys!"
"D: This goes down easy but I have to say I prefer regular Bender. Coffee stouts too often taste like cheap gas station coffee. I get it, you used coffee but work on the balance and the bean a bit."
"Moderate to light body that plays to a cold coffee feeling. Carbonation is not weak, but not biting. Plenty of bitterness with no astringency."
"Crack & Glug time: Two quick fingers' worth of thick, deep-tan head with great retention and a wafting odor of coffee greeted me on the pour. Color was a deep, rich brown with ruby highlights. Nose was a knockout - it was like walking into Starbucks and taking a deep breath. I am not a big fan of their coffee, but it does smell deelish! I had some coffee earlier this AM, cowboy-style (warmed up in the microwave from yesterday), and I wanted to see how this would measure up. Mouthfeel was creamy with a VERY roasty coffee flavor up front, followed by a dark chocolate bitterness behind. Wow! Iced coffee was NEVER this good. Finish was bitter, I mean good, coffee bitter, but not for the faint of heart. Holy heart palpitations, Batman! I was more jittery than a long-tailed cat in a roomful of rocking chairs. Zounds! More, please, sir! F**k Joose or Four Loko, this is all the caffeine and alcohol you'll need."
"Poured from can into a shaker glass. Color is a deep mahogany brown with a small head that lingered for a few sips. Aromas of roasted malt, a little chocolate, and lots of fresh coffee. Full bodied and nicely carbonated. Taste was like drinking sweetened iced coffee in a can. And with the alcohol content not being all that high, I could do two or three of these over the course of an evening. Great job, Surly."
"Thanks Dan (and Megan) for bringing this one over last night. Pours a rich dark brown color, with a smallish light tan head. Huge freshly ground espresso on the nose, along with roasted malt and dark chocolate. Full bodied, creamy and rich, like cold canned coffee, with rich milk chocolate and roasted malt and a lingering coffee finish. Very good."
"This is the best brown ale by a longshot in my book."
"d- really nice, i opened this to drink during a sunday afternoon eagles game, and it went down very easily. this was my first surly, and definately won't be my last!!"
"D - a delicious brew with a sessionable ABV that I could sip all night."
"Darkness Day Notes: If you had to pick a beer to be served to you at 8AM in a cold, dark industrial park in MN, this is definitely in the top 5."
"YUM!"
"Good drinkability, but 1 or 2 would probably do the trick for me in a sitting."
"just not as smooth and drinkable as original, which i like much better."
"OMG! This stuff is amazing. Poured in a pint glass. Nice dark brown with a lovely tan head. Take of whiff of this stuff. Amazing. Says coffee through and through. First sip is nice and creamy with a great finish. Didn't take too long to finish it and open another but before I did I smelled the last of the first one. In a blind test I bet a lot of people would say it is just coffee. Just coffee? I think not! An amazing beer"
"Cheers..."
"4/4.5/4.5/4/4"
"D - maybe one, depending on the other choices."
"Absolutely dynamite fusion of coffee flavor and beer. A must try, and re-buy."
"D: I could have this breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Very easy to drink. Love this beer. ISO MORE! It's never too early for Surly!"
"Drinkability is a really good although seems a little boozy (if that can be at 5 ABV) when cold. As it warms it changes in a real way...just different not worse or better overall. A very interesting drink..."
"Drinkability - Quite so for this type of brew. A damn impressive brown ale for sure."
"D: Easy drinking, but seemed to be lacking something. Enjoyed the beer, but wish the coffee had a bigger presence"
"Finally, I get to try one of Surly's regular brews. This one pours a lovely ruby brown topped by a finger or so of light ecru foam. The nose is dominated by a light coffee breeze, while some chocolate, toffee, and maple syrup form a sturdy foundation beneath. The taste is very similar, though the coffee doesn't assert itself as much until the finish. Instead, it shares the spotlight with cocoa and maple syrup, the latter two spiraling into the wings to allow for the coffee's final aria. The body is a staunch medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat fizzily smooth feel. Overall, a very nice beer. I can now understand how this thing has such a strong reputation 'round these parts."
"Poured this into my pint glass. It's a deep brown with a thin off white head with decent lacing. I love the smell of this one. It has a nice nutty wooden aroma with a big coffee smell. The coffee is really well done. It comes through predominantly but doesn't overpower anything. The taste is a bi coffee flavor with hints of brown sugar and nuts. It finishes slightly bitter. It really reminds me of an ice coffee with just a bit of cream and sugar. Really good stuff. Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated with a smooth medium body. I really wish I had this stuff local, probably my favorite brown ale."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Cheers!"
"It would be nice to pour this from the Coffee pot every morning. Great beer."
"My 2nd favorite of Surly's regulars...very good beer here. If you like coffee and/or brown ales, try this already."
"Overall - A very good coffee beer that isn't big/overpowering like a stout. I somehow feel this was actually made better by drinking it out of my Surly coffee mug. Maybe it is never to early to get Surly..."
"My first Surly beer and I cant wait to have another. Great flavors and really drinkable."
"D - Goes down easy. I like how subtle the coffee flavor is. It really integrates well rather than dominating. One of the better coffee beers I've had. If this was available near me I would drink a lot of this."
"can 1/3 brought back from MSP"
"All Surly beers I have had the pleasure of drinking to date drink fast and smooth. This is no exception. By definition this is not quite a session beer but I could definitely enjoy a couple pints (or three) of Coffee Bender without getting tired of it. This isn't a mind blowing beer by far but its so intricate, complex and interesting that its going to be on my wants list permanently along with regular Bender. Highly recommended."
"O - This was a huge disappointment for me after having such high hopes for it. It's possible I just got an old can of it, so I'll be seeking this out again to give it another shot, and I'll come update this if there's any difference."
"D - Good for a coffee-infused brown ale. Dryness and clean finish make it a smooth beer, suitable for multi-can sessions."
"http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/photo.php?pid=4801444&fbid=429853478843&id=543268843"
"The feel of this beer is medium with a moderate level of carbonation. Long lingering aftertate of coffee and dark grain bitterness is left on the tongue that at times comes across like chocolate but mostly coffee. It also finishes with some citrus hop character and a bit drying that makes you want to sip this brew more and more. Overall a wonderful brew. Being a coffee lover, I thought this beer was fantastic."
"- Fantastic brew all around, very balanced and one I could surely even drink for breakfast!"
"D - Like a mix of brown ale and iced coffee."
"All in all an impressive brown ale from Surly. Very unique and well-executed."
"Received as a extra from SpeedwayJim. What a good guy. Poured a nice dark brown with a tan head. Smelled like a dunkin doughnuts hazelnut iced coffee. Very impressive. Tastes the same. I am blown away how an ale can taste like an iced coffee. The coffee beans are so rich and vivid and yet the brown ale is still dominating and skillfully crafted. I've only had the furious and this offering and would love to try more from surly."
"(D)- A great brown ale made even more dynamic with the addition of coffee into the mix. A great beer for the fall time."
"A great beer. Would have this in my fridge on the regular if Surly distributed to CA."
"drinkability: good"
"Drinkability: I think this is a very amazing beer. I really liked the regular Bender, but the Coffee Bender is a completely different beer. Amazing coffee aroma and flavor, I wish I had more of this on hand, it's that good."
"D - I could easily drink a couple of these, if only Surly distributed to GA. Great melding of coffee and beer and another great example of an ""exciting"" brown ale."
"at 5.1 abv, this one's very drinkable."
"D-This is a really easy drinking coffee beer and one where the coffee component doesn't overwhelm the other flavors in the beer."
"Overall it is decent, kinda gives you a stomach ache."
"D- Good, I could drink a couple of these and with the mix of the coffee complementing the original Bender so well it made this one hard to put down."
"Poured a 16oz can into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a muddy brown with amber highlights when held up to the light. A massive 4 inch brown cap leaves mild lacing down the sides of the glass. Surly really knows how to make a pretty beer. I stuck my nose down in the glass for the first whiff, and bam, a full frontal attack to the olfactory by freshly ground, roasted with love, coffee beans. And nothing with else. Even as I let it warm, nothing else really comes through. Its like the coffee has completely drowned out the Bender aspect. The flavor is only slightly better. Fresh ground, artisan coffee. The best type of coffee you can buy, but that's really all i get. Hints of chocolate come through on the tail buy really nothing else. The coffee has overwhelmed everything that makes this beer great and turned it into a one dimensional monster. I'm not saying its bad, Coffee Bender tastes like great coffee. Like i could drink it warm, out of a big mug in the morning, but its really lost every other aspect of the beer. The mouthfeel is soft and creamy leaving a little coffee astringency lingering on the palate. I really like the beer. Its tasty. But its one dimensional and not as good as Bender is."
"M/D: could easily replace a cup of coffee in the morning, nearly no carbonation, smooth feel down the throat."
"When I drank this, I couldn't stop smiling. Simply one of the most delicious and interesting beers I've ever had. If I lived closer I'd drink it regularly. I expected big things out of this beer, and wasn't even close to being let down. Long live Coffee Bender!"
"Deep, deep chestnut color. Smallish off white head. Nice, mellow coffee aroma. Mildly nutty. Great, great flavor-very malty with an evenly balanced coffee taste. Somewhat nutty-just a whisper of hop flavor. Bitterness comes more from coffee and roasted grains. Very full mouthfeel. Boy I could drink this all night. very drinkable and nice to see a coffee beer that is not a porter or stout. Damn good all around."
"M/D- Light-medium bodied with lower carbonation. easy drinking. would have liked a little more in just about every department from this beer."
"Mouthfeel is nice and medium bodied. But the carb is a touch high for me. Overall, I love this beer and would drink a ton if I had access to it. But it's not stunning to me, more like a well rounded and unique beer that tastes really good!"
"D-smooth and thin, more like a strong ale, some balance and a light coffee notes."
"Overall a wonderful beer that you can easily enjoy from morning until night."
"Taste is somewhat acidic, derivative of low quality, unsweetened coffee. Theres not enough malt to balance out the raw nuttiness - it needs to be a little sweeter and more well rounded. Goes down a little rough!"
"My absolute favorite thing about Coffee Bender is how it showcases the coffee flavors so well by setting them against something contrasting. It's like having complementary versus contrasting flavors with a meal in that one isn't necessarily better than the other."
"Very tasty to drink. Can't wait till I get my hands on more of this!"
"Yum"
"Glad I got to try it and recommended."
"D = First thing I want to grab when I wake up in the morning."
"Light mouthfeel and a strong carbonation. This is an easy drinking brown ale and as an added bonus in a can."
"D- very good. I could drink it all night long and be happy."
"D - Surly needs to get distribution here in Florida. This stuff is great."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it was a pleasure to drink. Overall it had some great flavors and the coffee really enhanced the overall flavor instead of taking it over which was great. Very enjoyable beer."
"M/D - Another excellent brew from Surly, great blend of malts and coffee. Well balanced for a twist on the American brown ale style. A for sure must try and comes highly recommended!!!! Love to start my mornings with a cup of Coffee bender but I don't think I can have just one"
"Toasted malt hits the palate first, with coffee not far behind. The coffee character obliterates a lot of the depth and subtlety that regular Bender has, but the coffee character in itself displays a lot of complexity; it's earthy, roasty, lightly acidic - one of the most rounded and complex coffee profiles I've detected in a beer. The finish has equal amounts of toast, roast, toffee and coffee. It finishes coffee-forward, slightly bitter and decidedly dry with a coffee grounds finish. This is stellar, up to Surly's usual high standards and pretty unique to boot."
"Overall, a very good coffee beer if coffee in your beer is what you want. Coffee coffee coffee!"
"Too coffee forward, its not my thing."
"I kept the score a little higher on the flavor, because though it lacked the coffee I was expecting, this still was a damn good brown. Better than many. I'd have another, and even another. But they could ""bold"" it up a bit more IMO. Thanks again for the opportunity, Andy."
"Overall this was a great coffee-infused American Brown Ale and another fine offering from Surly. Thanks again Meagan and Nate! Recommended."
"D: If you like coffee this is very drinkable due to its excellent flavor and low ABV. If you are not a coffee drinker you probably wont drink more than one. If I ever drank a beer in the morning Coffee Bender would be my choice."
"Some reddish notes on the edge. The head is creamy, beige and quite dense. The aroma presents notes of coffee with some chocolate. The coffee aroma is typical of coffee grains. The chocolate aroma is the one of a dark chocolate. The taste is like crunching on coffee beans that are coated in dark chocolate. The bitterness is what you usually found in an espresso coffee. It lingers in the mouth. Medium body with carbonation. The head sticks well to the glass. A very good beer for everyday. Not too heavy for a beer, and quite sessionable."
"Mouthfeel was thinner than expected. Mild carbonation. Not a favorite."
"The body and somewhat simple flavor profile coupled with a low abv make this easy to drink."
"D- This is a nice, light, drinkable coffee brew. Not my favorite by Surly but still a very solid, well put together brew."
"D- A great, great beer. Surly hits a gold again with this brew. Drinking this beer sincerely improves the quality of my life. I can certainly get through a few of these in one session."
"The almost overwhelming coffee aspect of this one cuts the drinkability down some. Compared to many other coffee infused beers, this one seems a bit off balance. There's a bit too strong of a division between the beer and coffee in this beer."
"D: This is very much dominated by coffee and if that is your thing then this will not disappoint and hence will go down very easily--almost too easily; a nice ""anytime"" beer"
"An absolute revelation! Walk, no run to acquire such a masterpiece!"
"Pours a brown with ruby highlights. Clear enough to see through. Off white bubbly head. The smell I recognize initially is that fresh brewed cold coffee smell, but at the same time there is a similar yet slightly different roasted note coming from the malts. As the beer wears on the chocolate becomes more apparent in the nose. The taste starts off with a nice chocolatey sweetness but finishes roasty bitter. The taste of actual coffee is noticeable, but not overpowering. The brew is on the thinner side, maybe evening having a watery aspect despite its robust flavor."
"Overall this takes the cake for coffee influenced beer styles. Besides DFH india brown ale, its up there as one of the best brown ales I've tasted. Kudos to surly for an awesome brew."
"J"
"4.5 D: If the mouthfeel was a bit thicker, this would be pretty close to a perfect brown. The way it stands, it's still very good and I could go through a number of these with no problem. Man do I love Surly brews."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Well carbonated and it's got a nice body to it. It's very smooth and very soothing. I could sip on this all night. I was really anticipating this one and it lived up to my expectations."
"I could drink this one for days. If it was more readily available in my area, this would turn into my session beer. Like I said, it's like a stout light. All the taste, half the alcohol. Don't know the algorithm for ratings, but this should be getting an A+ from me."
"D - quite the unique one here...drinks more like an alcoholic coffee energy drink than anything else. i am a huge coffee-head so i find this rather enjoyable, just missing the well-roundedness of classic coffee + beer flavors."
" D- This beer is like eating chocolate covered espresso beans and the hops let you know that there is a great beer base underneath. Delicious."
"I have to be honest I was not sure how I would feel about this beer. I have been a Surly fan for a while now and still was somewhat reluctant. Well, I shouldn't be surprised that they know exactly what they are doing."
"Medium-full body. Plush carbonation. This beer, like everything else I've tried from Surly thus far, is an absolute joy to drink."
"Can't wait to try Furious next."
"The beer has a medium body. A fairly nice feel as it roles across the palate, not too carbonated. The flavor has a touch of sweetness but is quickly taken over by the flavor of coffee. Bitter as the beer exits. This has some nice flavor. The amazing thing about it is that it has a strong, truly coffee-like, flavor, but it does not become overwhelming--making this a drinkable brew."
"Cardboard box lovers may love this."
"Overall, this is one of the best coffee beers I have had and is a nice change from the typical coffee stout. Coffee Bender is a bit lighter than most coffee beers you typically come across, but still packs a lot of coffee flavor. I wish this was easy to get a hold of on the East coast. Definitely worth grabbing a four pack of, or more."
"All in all, this one is good. If you're a coffee drinker, as I am, then you will love this brew. It's one of the only beers I can picture having during breakfast, haha. Very much like drinking a coffee. Tasty!"
"D- This beer I would get into trouble drinking all the time. I had no problem drinking all of it in a quick fashion. I will be looking to get more of this as soon as I can. Coffee drinkers and coffee beer fans should do all they can to try this out."
"D - I definitely would like access to this more often too bad it is only available in Minnesota, would like to try more of Surly's beer."
"D: Fantastic coffee beer! This one really just tastes like a cup of coffee, and is just so easy to drink, especially with the lower ABV."
"Pours dark brown with a tan head. The aroma is straight coffee with nothing else coming through. The flavor is coffee with some roasted malts. There is a nice bitterness at the end, either from the coffee or from hops. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. One of the best, most interesting brown ales I have tried."
"Drinkability: Nice, fairly easy to drink Coffee Ale, but I prefer the complexity of the standard Bender. Also, not quite in the same league as Founders Breakfast Stout and Bell's Java Stout, but very good nonetheless."
"It pours a semi transparent brown cola color with minimal tan head. The smell is just smooth black coffee, not r=a lot of roastiness and no detectable bitterness, like an ice coffee made from a french press. Really pleasing and inviting. The taste is just the same. I think I've had french press ice coffee that tastes just like this. There is very little beer character in here which I think is what the brewer has intended. I haven't had the base beer but now I'm wishing I picked up some so I could compare. The absence of bitterness and high roastiness is what makes this beer unique and one of my favorite coffee flavored beers. I could put this in the office coffee pot and I doubt no one would be the wiser; although the day would be more interesting. Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery but that is my only complaint. I'm sad I only picked up a 4-pack of this from my MN trip."
"d - The can really doesn't like about this one; it really tastes just like an iced coffee. I liked the creamy coffee taste it gave off and the smell is one of straight coffee. Definitely look forward to getting more of this stuff."
"Roasted iced coffee and Bender mix. Balance leans towards the coffee. Becomes more balanced as it progresses. I'm thinking that this could have replaced one of my weekend morning coffees. Certainly one for coffee (and of course beer)lovers to try!"
"D: This is a phenomenal beer. Damn the beer gods for teasing me with this! Truly though, this is a great beer, not filling, beyond tasty. If it were distributed to me, it would most definitely be my go to beer!"
"D: Honestly, I could drink this with breakfast, lunch and/or dinner. This is refreshing iced coffee beer. If you like coffee and beer, this is your session beer."
"D- This beer tastes good and goes down smoothly. If I were tailgating I would start the morning off with this one. The ABV is high so it makes for a good session beer. Too bad you can only get this in Minnesota. Another good beer from Surly."
"D - This is a fantastic beer with a great coffee taste. I'm glad I got my hands on one."
"D_Very smooth and easy to drink but with a big bold flavour. Slightly over sessionable I still could make one out of it. If this was in my area I would always have it on hand"
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of the coffee-flavored beer segment, this is an excellent darker but milder beer that is worth drinking for an entire evening."
"D: If you like coffee, amazing."
"Drinkability - I could drink a lot of this. Unfortunately I didn't really get to experience it warm up a lot because it went down so fast. A really good beer, I wish we had Surly in Michigan, I would always keep some in my disc golf bag."
"Solid black body with a one finger khaki head. Solid lacing initially. Nose is a chocolate milk shake from two feet away, or hot coco. I want to warm this up dramatically. Taste isn't as bitter coffee as I was thinking from advertisement, more of a bitter sweet chocolate. Almost a metallic sting in the taste too, bitters come out more in the finish too. This is one brew that could probably easily work with more alcohol in it. The flavors are interesting and strong enough to conceal more than is in it. I don't think I've ever said that about a beer. :) Body is a bit thin, and mouth is probably a bit too bubbly, or fizzy, for me. But over all a sold coffee brown ale. Almost completely solid lacing to the end on the side of the glass the brew didn't 'wash' over."
"D: high drinkability. I would be happy to sub out my morning coffee for this"
"Overall: An excellent example of coffee flavors and aroma adding to the complexity of the beer. The bitterness coming off the coffee marries well with the hop and roasted barley qualities in this beer. I feel like I'm saying it all the time lately but the mouthfeel is a little thin, it moves toward watery in the end but I suppose this leads to a crisp and clean finish."
"this is damn good, much better than i remember it last time i had it. a nice touch of sweetness really rounds this out. if you like coffee, you will love this."
"Purchased from Blue Max Liquors in Burnsville, MN. Pours a black body with ruby red corners and a big, pillowy tan head. Aroma is mostly coffee beans and also some chocolate and floral hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Flavor is tinny, grainy, dark roasted malts, with a good coffee flavor and bitterness from the coffee, which also intermingles with the hop bitterness. The relatively low alcohol content is a nice touch since this is so tastey that I had to grab a second one!"
"D - Superb. A sort of cousin to Peak Organic Espresso Amber. Sometimes it's nice to have a coffee beer without roasted malt and a huge body. Definitely worth a try."
"As it warmed up I got a better taste of the brown ale and the malt really started to balance out the coffee and enhance the smell. This is nearly sessionable at around 5%."
"D: Very highly drinkable. This is one of those stand-by go-to beers that I feel like I want to be able to have at all times. Great light body, good character, and super tasty!!!"
"I enjoy trying non-stout coffee beers and I like the base beer Bender so I have high hopes for this. Appearance wise everything is as expected, looking similar to bender, dark browns, relatively clear, frothy mocha head with nice retention and lacing. Aroma is also very nice, a strong malty, nutty base with what smells like fresh coffee beans, not overly sweet, but not bitter either. The flavor and mouthfeel is where I miss the original bender or some of the bigger coffee stout beers. Not to say this isn't well made or enjoyable, but I feel like it's splitting the difference between the two without hitting the peaks of flavor or mouthfeel from Bender or something like Breakfast Stout. Unlike the stouts, the body is less chewy and full, but still a robust medium-full. The most disappointing part of the beer is the finish which has a nutty, dry Bender like flavor, but is overall rather thin and has a watery character. The body has a nice fresh brewed coffee characteristic with mild malt and nutty background, but not much sweetness or roasted flavors. Overall, a very drinkable, enjoyable coffee beer, but I don't feel like the coffee adds that much to the original base beer, nor does it satisfy me if I'm looking for an intense coffee infused beer fix."
"Great beer overall and yet another star in Surly's lineup."
"Drinkability - Keep em coming! This is a delicious, delicious brew and I am pleased to have picked up a 4-pack!"
"This is one tasty and sessionable Coffee Brown from Surly."
"Reviewed on: 12-16-2009 02:35:50"
"The beer is light-to-medium bodied, crisp and well carbonated. The low abv makes this something I could multiple cans of over a long day. The can claims the beer is as refreshing as an iced coffee, and they aren't far off. Another good beer from Surly."
"D - A great coffee beer despite it's lack of depth. One I wouldn't hesitate to have again!"
"Coffee is the dominant flavor here. Overall smooth and medium bodied beer. A lot of sweetness in this beer, kind of tastes like a coffee beer. Interesting, second taste. There is a slight roasty aftertaste with this beer. Mouthfeel is good, the sweetness and coffee add a lot to the connectivity of this beer and normally i'm not a big coffee beer guy but this was great. Drinkability high."
"Drinkability is off the charts. Though we are entering a season in Michigan where I prefer my coffee piping hot, it is wonderful to enjoy a coffee beverage from the warm comforts of my home. Goes down remarkably easy, it will take some will power to hold on to the rest of my stash for very long. Thank you to Mothman for providing this wonderful opportunity."
"D - I'm a huge fan of the Coffee Bender and from everything I've had from the Surly Brewing Company thus far! This brew (along with the Furious) puts Surly in my top 5 favorite breweries. I would recommend this to a friend any day!"
"I've gained much respect for Surly after trying Furious, CynicAle, Bender, Darkness and Coffee Bender. They are not mindless hop-packers but can brew a well rounded beer that is worth the hype."
"O: This is my new favorite everyday beer. Light enough to drink solo on a hot day (like an iced coffee), but a flavor profile that goes great with a dog or a burger, and still manages to satisfy on a cold December night in Minnesota."
"A really good coffee infused brown ale. Something I would recommend, and wish I could get more of."
"Drinkability - a fine session beer, at the top of the list for an American Brown. Thanks to MPLS and SkyDoc for setting me up with some of these gems at DLD09. More is better!!!"
"An OK beer but not a complicated one. An OK sample but not a mainstay beer."
"D - Overall great easy smooth drink abv is low so no issues there can't wait to have the others that I got."
"The beer felt quite nice, with low carbonation and could easily be drunk quite regularly..."
" I really love that there is a coffee beer that is so drinkable and sessionable. So often coffee is added to beers that are already huge stouts and that makes them, by default, one-and-done or bottles to share with friends. Thats what makes this brown ale so nice. Now I just need to trade for more."
"The taste is a bit less complex than the smell. Here, coffee takes an unambiguous lead. The sugar and bread flavors that were promised by the smell are there, but they play a background role. Tasting blind, I'd be hard-pressed to differentiate this from an above average coffee stout (except perhaps for the lighter mouthfeel). Don't get me wrong, I love coffee flavors in beer and its presence here is appreciated. The problem is that none of the other flavors that make a brown ale are allowed to shine. This is a tough one for me: I love the flavors, but they don't belong in this setting. I'm rating this one to style, but if you love coffee as I do, bump it up a notch or two."
"pored very dark brown with thin beige ring with little head it did have some nice sticky lacing smell was all coffee and some vanilla some burnt malts..the taste was coffee first strong coffee it overwhelmed the bender with roasted somewhat bitter taste.. the malts and the hops could not be detected..overall i did not enjoy this one like say Peruvian morning it was not balanced between malt hops and coffee..ill stick to plain bender for my brown ale fix"
"Again Surly comes through with another great beer, and quickly becoming one of if not my favorite brewery"
"D - It's not hard to drink, but it's just not particularly pleasant either, not going to do much of this."
"The mouthfeel is heavy and lasting but because of its blandness its not very drinkable, not because its filing but because its just bland."
"D and overall impression: I am a coffee lover, so drinkability is high. Overall, this is one tasty brew. I think I like CCB's Espresso Maduro a little better, but if I had access to this, it would be a staple in my fridge. Skal."
"D - Great coffee-infused beer with a lot of earthy hop character. I'm glad to have finally reviewed this one. Thanks Kramer!"
"D: A great coffee beer. Very easy to drink and expresses what coffee beers should taste like. The best part of waking up is Surly in my cup!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly smooth."
"Poured a clear dark brown with a small lingering brown head. Smelled of coffee, roastiness, mocha and light vanilla. Tasted of coffee, roastiness and light cocoa with a lingering coffee finish. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth finish."
"Good complex brew."
"Deep brown body topped by a thick tan head. Head throws a lot of nice lace. Aroma has a strong fresh ground coffee note with a hint of malt and vanilla. Flavor is also very strong on the coffee, like a nice mild roast, supported by caramel malts and a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but tends to support the whole coffee vibe. Drinkability is good. I would want another someday, but not immediately following. A very enjoyable coffee beer."
"Might wake up with one of these tomorrow."
"An interesting and craveable brew. If you enjoyed this, give Furthermore's coffee beer a try, which this reminded me of."
"This dark brown brew foams up big with a tan head, looks nice. The aroma is wondeeful...rich malt with sharp espresso scent. The coffee flavor is integrated perfectly in this highly drinkable brew. I love that the coffee flavor comes in a session beer, since you can watto keep drinking this stuff. Very well done."
" ~ I want to call this brew complex but it really is straight forward and to the point. This is definitely something every beer drinker must try. You will not regret it! Thanks again ""drizzam""!"
"Final thoughts: Yes, this is much more beer than coffee, unlike most of the other coffee beers. And it's blended really well with the roasted malts, coffee, and good hop bitterness. The finish is pretty bitter and tastes great. Can't wait to have another sip."
"Pours a very deep dark brown/black color with a good sized tan bubbly head. The smell on this beer is coffee, there are some other things going on as well, but mainly coffee. Taste is like the smell, coffee. Hops are present as well as a cocoa flavor. Goes down smooth and viscous, very nice mouthfeel and drinkability. I could probably drink a billion of these, although I am also a coffee lover. If you like coffee you will love this beer, if not you won't, simple as that."
"Poured a deep brown with great caronation and big tannish head. Nose is big coffee beans and very yummy. taste is a good. It has one of the best tasting coffee flavors I have experienced. It tastes like fresh, natural coffee beans, more so than any beer I have had. Very smooth, not over the top. Also has some oats and vanilla. Mouthfeel is thinner but the fresh coffee roams in the background."
"The mouthfeel is light bodied for an American brown, and really light for an American coffee beer. Light carbonation fits just right in this beer. I'd love to try this one again, shouts to Ineedabeerhere for the can."
"D- Good drinkability, but I wouldn't call it a session beer. The caffiene gets to me after one can, kinda fun actually. Great beer!"
"Drinkability: This beer has some outstanding drinkability. It's refreshing, smooth, not overly heavy, and (most importantly) very tasty. I'm glad I finally got to try this bad boy, it's a shame this is my only can."
"Overall, probably one of the better brown ales I have had. Very glad to have finally tried this, highly recommended for a session beer."
"Dark chocolate molasses brown body. Thick finger of dense, creamy, dark sandy brown head. Great lacing and retention. Sweet brown sugar, molasses, milk chocolate, and graham cracker malt aromas mix nicely with funky (Sumatran-esque), roasted coffee. Bright, roasted, coffee bitterness up front. Scorched caramel and chocolate malts follow. Strong roasted bitterness stays throughout. Nutty, with vanilla and molasses notes. Finish is coffee bitter with lingering caramel. Medium-bodied, with a slightly oily feel. Delicious!"
"D: A very nice, if not unique, brew that anyone who enjoys a little coffee in their beer should take a chance on. There is a reason why Coffee Bender (and its kid brother Bender) rock the top of the American Brown Ale charts. They are that good."
"This is one of the best coffee beers I've had, and equal kudos go to Surly and the roaster. The result is a coffee-focused beer that is harmonized with the beans it is juiced with."
"D: The coffee is a bit overwhelming for too many, but the can my wife and I shared was gone rather quickly."
"This is a very good beer, and the nose is just out of this world. On the whole I think I like the original Bender better, but this would be a wonderful change of pace to mix it up every now and then. If the sweet malts came out a bit more I think it would be truly superb. Still, a great beer."
"Thanks again to Dansting for this one. 16oz can served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear dark reddish brown with a finger of light tan head. Nice aroma of coffee and cocoa. Coffee flavor was restrained and not over the top like a lot of coffee beers. The coffee didn't add to the bitterness, which I find distracting. Decent amount of hop bitterness. Chocolate malt. Dry finish from hops as well as lingering malt. One of the better coffee beers IMO."
"Who would win, a Bender or a certain coach Ditka? What if the Bender's name was Coffee Bender?"
"Very high on the drinkability for me. I have been trying to decide whether its a beer best in summer or winter months, early in the morning or at night, and came to the conclusion that it can do the job almost anytime I desire a good beer."
"dont get me wrong i love coffee beers...peche mortel and valdez are two of favorites...just didnt think this one quite lived up to it..its halla good just not one of my favorites.."
"Heavy smell of coffee here, reminds me of a few of the local Midnight Sun coffee brews. MSBC Brewtality has sort of ruined me for other coffee beers, but this one pours up nicely. Tastes of strong dark black coffee. I don't get much of a heavy beer taste - the alcohol is very underlying for me, and it smacks more of an iced coffee drink without any kind of cream or milk. Goes down very smooth, and as one who really likes coffee beers, and big brews, this one is a good addition to my regular quaff list. I'll be trying this one again for sure!"
"Drinkability: It's good, and I will definitely have another, but not for session drinking due to it's strong flavors. It's a delicious ""one-and-done"" brew. Another creative and interesting brew from the excellent brewmasters at Surly."
"Medium bodied, silky smooth and ultimately refreshing. A solid coffee-infused beer and a stellar brown overall. Only downside is the price, and the way Furthermore Oscura hits the same spot, it's a bit easier on the wallet to throw down for the local Wisco brew... but I would still trade up for this any day."
"Really easy to drink. Refreshing, but coffee dominates. I am not a coffee drinker, but this is actually pretty good. I could even do a couple of these at a time."
"Overall: they went too far with the coffee"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: While the beer is certainly enjoyable, I can't help but believe that the coffee overwhelms some of the more interesting aspects of Bender"
"A top tier beer from a top tier brewery. Always jump at the chance to have one of these!"
"The weak body certainly wouldn't keep me from drinking this one, alot. Damn, I wish Surly had better distribution. Nicely drinkable."
"Oveall: For me the coffee is just too much. I can't taste much else past it. My prefence would be more subtle coffee aromas/flavors that better blend w/the brown ale. But just MHO."
"Overall, If I could only have beer in cans, I could survive off this and ten fidy. A truly excellent beer. Pity I don't have regular access to it."
"Can courtesy photomike. Pours a clear ruby brownish copper with a nice light tan head. Not exactly a 'brown' brown ale. Aroma is straight up coffee grounds. I wish I could say more but that's pretty much it. Flavor is iced coffee with half and half. Slightly green coffee beans with light acidity and moderate astringency. Body and mouthfeel are otherwise fine, and if you like coffee beer, this is pretty much the definition of it."
"For all its merits the acrid finish really turns me off. What is otherwise an eminently drinkable beer becomes a bit of a chore to finish. And while I give it largely positive scores for the rest of its character, I can't help wishing I just had a glass of regular ole Bender here instead."
"A very interesting brown ale indeed. Nice to see that there are now more and more good beers available on can."
"Thanks jctribe25!"
"Flat out great beer... Not quite on par with FBS, but damn close."
"Drinkable? You betcha. This cup-a-joe is easily in the upper echelon of coffee beers. (Central Waters Coffee Stout, Founder's Breakfast Stout, and Bell's Java Stout are it's only peers) Pert near sessionable which few coffee beers can claim. (NG Coffee Stout)"
"overall, this was an excellent beer that i thoroughly enjoyed"
"My first Surly, and I now understand why people love them so much."
"Not quite a Peche or a KBS but dang, this is pretty good."
"I would very much recommend everyone try this beer. Especially if you are a regular coffee drinker like myself."
"Thanks to Dyan for tossing this my way. Poured from a 16 ounce can into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a hazed chestnut brown color with about two fingers of creamy ecru foam. Nose and flavor are of medium roasted grains, caramel mocha coffee, toasted bread, pleasantly bitter earthy and fruity hops. Great balance of bitter and sweet. Nice mouthfeel for the style with light to medium carbonation. A wonderfully session-able brown ale. Thanks again Dyan!"
"This is the first 'craft' beer that I have had from a can and I was interested in how that might alter or affect the taste. As far as I can tell there is no difference from bottled beer. This is a decent offering but not something that I would get again. Jeff sent me various stuff from Surly and I can't wait to try out the other stuff. I am sure they will be solid beers just like this one was."
"D- Quite drinkable despite being a very dark coffee beer. One of the best, if not the best, from Surly."
"This beer has pre set high expectations as I had sampled it from a growler a couple of years ago and loved it. Pours to the darkest blackish brown body. Head is a biscuit like tan tone and considerably rocky standing at nearly three fingers. Tons of wavy lace is left as it very slowly fades. Coffee is immediately evidant on the nose, like cold but fresh coffee. I love the nose on this one. Coffee comes first and quick with the initial sip but quickly yields a bitter dryness as it slides back. Malt profile is mineral based and adds a slight sweet feel for just the right amount of balance. Refreshing, yet bold and truely enjoyable all around. Mouthfeel is so attractive and really beckons the next sip. True drinkability that is hard to beat."
"D-I could drink this all morning, all afternoon, and all night. So easy going down and so drinkable."
"Very easy to drink. The coffee makes this brew seem so dark to look at but it's certainly nice to realize that it isn't too heavy or overly filling upon drinking. Maybe that's why they went with a brown ale rather than a stout for this coffee beer; but, whatever their reasons were, kudos to them for making this delicious concoction."
"Very good overall and very easy to drink. Excellent flavor and a healthy 5.1% abv means you can have more than one in a night. Looking forward to more of these!"
"Pours like an iced coffee, clear with a BIG foamy light tan head that leaves a good amount of Belgian lacing behind. The smell on the timid side, but classic lightly roasted malt and caramel topped off with coffee. I really appreciate the big mouth feel on this one. It works really well with the malt and coffee flavors. It's very smooth and creamy; finishes with a touch of sweetness and a light coffee note that lingers nicely. I also appreciate that the roasted character isn't over done. It's been a while since I sampled Bender, but I think that I prefer this one over the original. At 5.1% ABV, I recommend that you fill your coffee station at work with this stuff...if you can get it. Hell of a drinker...had a lot of fun considering it. Many thanks to maximum12 for this opportunity!"
"D: The roasty bitterness takes this down a notch for me, but overall this is a great brew that seems to be exactly what Surly was going for with this coffee flavored beer...easy to drink and no alcohol picked up in the flavor."
"D: Pretty high. I'd like to try the regular Bender, if not get more of this. The most enjoyable coffee beer I've had."
"I could drink these for breakfast."
"Draft. Pours brown with a small head. Aroma of sweet malt and light coffee grounds. Flavor is sweet initially with a coffee ground finish. I would have liked to see a stronger malt backbone to balance out the bitter coffee but perhaps that is expected when using a brown ale as the base instead of a porter or stout, which I am more used to. Anyway, it was very good for a brown ale."
"D - Very easy drinking - the coffee flavor is a bit direct after a full can, reducing the drinkability for me. Not filling nor overly abusive in terms of ABV."
"The drinkability is very good considering coffee is such a strong flavor. This beer would be appropriate in many circumstances whether sessioned, on a cold Minnesota winter night, or even at a cook out."
"D- Good stuff here. Mouthfeel and taste keeps this one going. Surly is the real deal."
"Cheers!"
"D--Another rock solid brew from Surly, and one that I would surely drink a lot of if it was available."
"16 ounce can recently acquired in a trade with mikesgroove, thanks again for this Surly brew, poured into my Hangar 24 pint glass tonight, color was a dark brown, 3/4 inch off white creamy head that lasts a few minutes, minimal lacing, aroma consists of coffee beans, mild vanilla, roasted nuts, sweet malts, caramel, and grains, flavor starts off with a dry coffee taste, nutty in the middle with some sweetness lingering right afterwards, stays the same as it warms but gets easier to drink, like how the coffee dries out this great brown ale, dry, slightly chewy, and malty mouthfeel, medium bodied, taste lingers, moderate carbonation, could drink a few cans of this no problem, smooth and light for what it is, coffee is not overpowering, hit the spot tonight, would like to drink again, recommended"
"Drinkaility? Give me a cup of coffee...one cup, and I'm done. Well made coffee inspired beers seem to defy any sensible reasoning, given my ""stand"" on coffee, as I find them very damn drinkable. This is one of the easiest coffee brews to quaff. 'nuff said."
"D: This is a damned easy drinking beer. I could easily kill 3 of these if I was in a coffee mood, but I would have to want coffee. This is straight up a good iced coffee type flavor and it mirrors an iced coffee almost perfectly. Like I said on the flavor, not exactly the most dynamic of beers but it all works greatly together and creates an amazing beer. Flavor is spot on and very enjoyable. I could easily drink this at any time of day. Morning, noon, or night. Fantastic. Thanks, Andy."
"D - Extremely easy drinking...I might be able to have this one for breakfast instead of the morning coffee. Alcohol is not detectible. If you like coffee, you could have this one all day long."
"Drinkability: While brown ale's really generally aren't my favorite, this one was very, very good. The coffee worked with the other flavors in the beer spectacularly. I could easily put down a few of these, and would definitely pick it up against if it was more accessible to me (or accessible at all)."
"Very dark brown to black in color. Some light passes through to create brown spots. Thick frothy head that clings to the glass as the head settles down. The head has a tannish color to it. Nice coffee nose that is like sniffing coffee beans. I call it ""good"" but can't be ""exceptional"" because its more coffee than beer (it seems like nit-picking). Gentle malt attack and coffee notes throughout. A little smoky at the finish due to the presence of the coffee. Very much reminiscent of a dunkin donuts iced coffee flavor to this beer. I haven't had dunkin donuts in a while since they aren't prevalent in the Twin Cities, but its how I remember it. Some mild bitters on the surface of the flavor. The coffee tones are gently interwoven into the beer but they are definitely the dominant flavor. Coffee in the title is right. It seems this should do well locally when you consider all of the coffee shops. Maybe they should ship some to Seattle for sale too. Different and worth a drink. I can see some purists turning their noses up at it however."
"D- A very good solid brew that is really easy to drink."
"D: Still quite drinkable and tasty. I just drank my first Bender about 30 minutes ago, and adding Coffee to it certainly works well. The impressive thing is that they pack so much flavor into a lower ABV, lighter bodied brown ale."
"This beer isn't as drinkable as some because the high level of bitterness I would not want more than two of these large cans in a sitting. I did enjoy the beer and would love more in the future. Great brew!"
"D: It's alright, but not a knock-out like some of the Surly brews."
"Cheers Bryan."
"Pours a dark brown with a silky tan head. Excellent lacing. Nose has coffee, chocolate, roasted nuts, and bready malts. Taste has more rosted malts and sweet coffee beans up front followed by cocao, molasses, a hint of hops and earthy cocoa with bitter espresso through the finish. Nice creamy body is well carbonated. Good to see another quality beer in a can."
"Looks just like regular Bender, except just a bit lighter. Thin head that has decent retention, some nice lacing. Smells a whole lot better though. Instead of just some sweet malt, lots of awesome coffee smell. Tastes just like an iced coffee, strong coffee flavor without being overbearing. Also helps to balance out the hops. Perfectly carbonated, lingering on the palate, great mouthfeel, and an amazingly drinkable beer as it warms. Like Bender, but better. A great beer!"
"Taste is akin to having your cup of coffee in the morning. Bitter roasting coffee, a slight sweet smoothness in the body, just the hint of roasting malts. Again, more Folgers coffee than premium but still amazingly tasty. A faint herbaceous hop quality in the finish that leaves a slightly dry finish. Smooth mouthfeel, amazing drinkability. At such a low ABV, this is a coffee lover's session beer and I wish it was available a little easier. Really nice."
"If Coffee Bender was available in New Jersey, I would buy it frequently. (Do you hear me Surly?) This is an eye-opening brew, in more ways than one. A winner. Highly recommended."
"D: Quite drinkable. Would love to drink this with a slice of good cheesecake. . .excellent job."
"Drinks pretty easy for all the flavor this is throwing out. Not a huge coffee beer fan, but I love this & believe this is the bench mark for Coffee brews. Another winner from Surly!"
"Drinkability - Would make a nice session beer. Another solid offering from Surly."
"A nice concept, but its not for me. The stale coffee was not a desirable characteristic in my opinion."
"This is my Birthday Review!!! Yeah Me...Yeah Beer..."
"To me your average brown isn't the easiest drinking thing in the world...but this is not average by any means. Very solid - a little brighter than usual for style from the nice tangy hop bite. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to try this one."
"This is an incredibly drinkable beer. Although, I'm not sure if it should be considered a true American Brown. It really seems more like coffee with alcohol than beer but still delicious."
"Drinkability: definitely would drink this beer again. coffee and beer, great combination."
"Overall a different take on the style that does work. I'm not a huge brown ale guy, but I enjoyed this can."
"The mocha notes in this seemed a limited more muted than when I had previously had this from a growler, allowing more of the Brown Ale qualaties to come out. Never the less, this is still a great coffee fix, complete with an awesome feel and super easy drinkibility. Glad this one is in cans now."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. This is truly a treat. If this wasn't as expensive as it is normally (when it's not on special) I would order it more often. Top notch brew. Kudos Surly, again."
"Got this brew as an extra with a trade from Skinnyguy. It pours a nice dark brown color with two fingers of foamy off white head. It smells exactly like a pot of coffee, but with sweet undertones in the aroma. I don't really know what to make of this beer. I can't tell if I'm impressed with it or not. Very strong coffee flavors with a bit of sweetness that I detected in the nose. I really can't explain the taste of this too well, if I had to take a stab at it I would say that it's like a Newcastle with a cup of coffee poured in it, buty obviously with more flavor than a Newcastle. Overall, not a bad brew, and I'm glad that I got to try it. I always look forward to trying new beers, especially ones that I'm unable to obtain in Massachusetts."
"D - I wish I could drink one of these in the morning to get my coffee fix. Screw Starbucks, I want Coffee Bender!"
"Drinkability; It's not bad, but the mouthfeel really let me down a bit and I was hoping for a stronger coffee presence in the mouth and not just the nose. I'd definitely drink it again, but I'm not sure I'd really go too far out of my way to get ahold of a can."
"D - Low ABV, delicious flavor. Can't really fault this one except for the strangeness in the thin mouthfeel accompanied by the coffee flavor. Really interesting take on a brown ale with great results."
"By the time I finished it, I had to go back and bump up this review on the appearance. I actually had a couple (maybe a dozen) very small coffee grounds in the bottom of my glass at the end. That's just awesome."
"Drinkability: Moderate for the style as the hops knock it somewhat off-balance. I'd definitely love to drink this for breakfast on a day I didn't have to be at work."
"Poured this bad chicken into my 1845 pils pint. Coffee bean hued plum color with raging little bubbles everywhere. Thick rich head with wonderful retention and thin lacing. Smells like a bag of fresh ground coffee beans with a touch of sweet malt. I wish the coffee shop would serve this to me blended with ice on the way to work. Coffee up front then a bitter touch of raw beans followed up by an nice vanilla malty finish. The mouthfeel is a tad thin and watery, but the taste pays dividends. 5%, this is my new early morning fishing beer. It says coffee on the can, so it must be good for you!"
"D: Easy and smooth. This is the ultimate coffee lover's beer. I can't decide if I should drink it at the end of a long day or for breakfast. I can easily drink more than one and would recommend it to many."
"So, is it better than Bender? Well...maybe a little. Despite this being an incredibly tasty beer, I can't ignore the fact that Bender is too. I think the coffee flavor gives it a slight edge for me. I find it a little more drinkable as a result. But, there's not a real material difference. They're both spectacular beers. But, I believe coffee fans will find just enough to give this one a slight edge...just like I do. Thanks, Brad. This is excellent stuff."
"I feel like coffee beers work better when a big creamy stout is used as the base (Southern Tier's Jahva remains my personal standard-bearer). Even though this isn't my favorite Surly beer, it's still a quality quaff and a fairly unusual one. Long may they brew (and can). Thanks to mnwags for the opportunity!"
"16oz can, courtesy of sonicdescent. Interesting beer. I should preface this by saying I usually like about 1/5 beers I try with coffee added. Call me a purist... Anyway - pours a robust brown color, edges of ruby. Not unlike the regular Bender, but I think it's a little lighter if that makes any sense at all and not as nice of a head. Nose is all coffee - really great clear coffee bean aroma. Unfortunately that's pretty much all I'm getting, besides a muted cry from the roasted malt trying to be heard. This is a tasty beer, I just find it a bit one-dimensional. If you like coffee beers, this will surely do the trick. I really like the coffee flavor I'm getting here but I just wish there was more to go along with it in this case. I had the regular Bender the other night and thought it was actually more full and more complex than this spiffed up version. Mouthfeel came across as a bit thin and watery, I don't know why. All in all this is a fine beer, it just might not be my thing. I've loved everything else I've tried from these guys so this beer was definitely worth the try, especially if coffee is your bag."
"Shared a can of this courtesy of Grant. Thanks for the opportunity. Pours a brownish/black with little head, but nice color. Nice big coffee aroma, quite fresh smelling, and earthy and a little vinous. More lively coffee makes an early appearance in the taste, slightly sweetened. Very balanced, and this is coffee black, done well. Very smooth and only slightly sweet. Very nice, and very full flavored for the very reasonable abv."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sugary, with a bitter coffee ground sting being felt along the palate during the finish."
"Overall, a stretch for the style: most beers with this much coffee in them are sturdier brews. For Surly to add this much coffee to a style as easy-going as a Brown Ale really brings the coffee all the way to the front. Go get some! Oh, and, yeah, I love the 16-ounce can! I want more beer in this format."
"Guess what it smells like coffee ;-) Probably no surprise there, but it also has a nice sweet aroma a well. The flavor mimics the nose with a light bitter finish. Comparing it to other coffee brews I have experienced this is a lot more like a Ice coffee flavor and feel in my mouth. I like it, I could easily see myself kicking back a few of these on a hot day and feel quite refreshed. If you are into ice coffees you got to give this a try"
"The beer smells, exactly like a cold coffee with a slight bit of chocolate. The beer is poured dark brown, with a off white fluffy head. When drinking this beer you get a nice hit of coffee, but sweet chocolate and hoppy flavours come through. The beer is so tasty. The balance after the coffee flavours are quite flavourful. The mouthfeel is light, but quite drinkable. I could drink a lot of these. What I love about this beer is that by the end of the beer, you don't taste as much coffee, but the hops and the chocolate sweetness from regular bender come through. This is an outstanding beer."
"They say it's a brown ale but it looks black. Nice tan head and lacing. The aroma is almost all 'dark roasted blend'. It is almost like I am smelling an iced coffee. The taste is much the same. Has a great refreshing coffee flavor, plus a ton more roasted malts. Goes down with a smooth mouthfeel and is as drinkable as a cup of joe."
"Drinkability is great. The hop bitterness is a bit more than I like in a brown ale, which is probably the only thing holding it back from 5s in taste and drinkability, but that's a minor quibble. Bender is very good, Coffee Bender is superb."
"Pours a dark brown with some ruby highlights here and there. A khaki colored two finger head rests atop the brew with very little webbing clinging on the sides of the glass. Aroma is coffee with a good dose of cream and sugar. Roasted malts, toffee, caramel and a touch of earthy hops...just a great beer to stick your nose into. More bold coffee flavors on the tongue with a sweet malty backbone. Midway some hops and vanilla emerge with espresso as well. Aftertaste is pretty nutty with a touch of cocoa powder. Light body with a soft but bitter feel. I wish it was a bit smoother, but the light body definitely is a plus. The drinkability suffers only slightly from the sweetness, but this is still a killer coffee brew. You rock Todd, thanks again for throwing this one in as an extra!"
"D - This was a very good, well crafted beer, as my first official Surly review, I must admit that I can't wait to try more of their beers"
"D- This is very flavorful for the amount of alcohol. I personally felt the acidity and raw coffee flavor was a little too much to handle but i'm sure coffee lovers will get their fix on this one."
"D: Like all Surly beers, HIGHLY sessionable. With the 5.1% ABV, I could put these back all night. Very enjoyable."
"I really enjoyed this, and is I every turn into a raging alcoholic and need to start my morning off right this is definitely the beer I would go to."
"D: Drinks like iced coffee, I like it. This one is all coffee, which is fine with me. Yum!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the cloudy reddish brown brew. Head falls gradually, with heavy and leggy lacing. Aroma is rich coffee and ample sweetness. Taste follows the nose, more acrid from the coffee, closes with evident hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is reasonably smooth, and drinkability is good as well. Nice one."
"Overall: Awesome beer. Try it and savor it. It is truly unique!"
"I love that this beer doesn't play it safe. It's not going for a ""hint"" of coffee to bring out ""highlights"" in the beer, no sir. We've got a distinct coffee-ness here, but it works. It's really something different, but you've got to commend the brewery for giving something like this a shot. When you take risks like that, everyone once in a while it works out. This is an example of it working out."
"This is _coffee_ beer. This is my first coffee brown ale and color me impressed. Tasty, tasty."
"This is an incredible beer, period."
"Beer may come from a can but you must absolutely drink it in a glass..."
"D= As stated above, we did beer floats. This made the experience more fun and added a unique dimension as the coffee up front was followed by rich, sweet cream. On it's own, I would be hesitant to have more than one at a time."
"D - I'd love to try one of these for breakfast!"
"I must say this coffee-flavored beer is excellent. It's really nothing like the original Bender, but that is fine. This Packs alot of flavor into a really sessionable brew. Highly recommended..."
"Flavor begins with a creamy, almost milk-like espresso note that quickly gives way to dark roasted coffee and chocolate. Hints of vanilla, fig, and pine thrown in the mix, and the aftertaste is laden with a potent hop & coffee bitterness. Body is a tad thin, but well carbonated, and finishes with a slight dryness. All in all, an exceptional beer that ""bends"" the style guidelines, but tastes so good it can afford to."
"I'm not huge on coffee, but when I have it I'd rather have iced which makes this a wonderful choice. This may be the best part of waking up...if only it were acceptable to drink in the morning...at work...from a coffee mug."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for a beer that seems to be a porter or stout. Refreshing to drink and very nicly done."
"Poured a deep and dark amber color (almost brown) with a an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of coffee, roasty, pine, earthy/diirt, and nuts. Tastes of coffee, roasty, vanilla, and caramel. Light lacing left on the glass."
"this brew pours up a dark brown color with crimson edges and a big frothy tan head. the nose is straight coffee, big malts, not much else but DAMN it smells good! the taste is coffee bitterness, nice malts, light to medium body, medium carbo. A very nice brew but I wish that it could have had a little bit more of a chewy malt characteristic that I so love in Brown Ales."
"Overall a coffee bomb. Don't think I will trade for this one again but I was glad I tried it."
"Aroma of lots of coffee, dark malts and the faintest hop aroma. A very nicely smelling coffee beer. Flavor was full of coffee beans, some chocolate and a got that nice malt brown ale flavor. I really like how smooth this beer is, its very creamy and very drinkable. This is an awesome coffee beer. Too bad i only have one can, and its impossible to get here in NY."
"Overall, amazing and easy to drink. I definitely want more surly. I highly recommend this beer, as it is all-around amazing."
"If you like coffee beers you will most likely find this appealing. If you are looking for bender with subtle coffee notes you will be disappointed as this is a coffee bomb."
"This is a great drinking very rich and complex beer at only 5.10%. Most beers with this much flavor also have a super high ABV leaving you pretty numb. I love it. I need more low ABV coffeee brown ales!!!"
"Slightly more head than the standard bender, and somewhat darker. The coffee flavor is strong, but the malt base still comes through a bit. Expected carbonation. Not much for hops. I like this a lot, I'm glad they made it a standard offering."
"I acquired this through a trade with wery0001. I poured from a 16 ounce can into a standard pint glass. It pours a deep reddish brown with a fuzzy white head. It has great aroma. It is sweet, dark roasted coffee. The flavor follows. It has great balance, a great combination of beer and coffee. The beer has medium body and just the right amount of carbonation. This is better than my normal cup of morning joe."
"Drinkability: As touted on the can, this is an iced coffee for adults. Smooth and immensely drinkable, it is also very flavorful. Another hit from Surly. I hope they eventually expand their distribution, but will give them time to do it right."
"D - Great breakfast beer, coffee flavor pairs well with what is a very well-balanced, drinkable American Brown Ale. Wish I had a sixer of this."
"Note to self: #1 American Brown Ale when I tried it."
"D: Nice and light. You forget your a drinking an alcoholic beverage after a few drinks. Very little to no lingering aftertaste. Very easy going beer, drink it till you can't sleep! Surly does not make a bad product."
"Ok so another good offering from Surly, but definately not my favorite. Appearance is good, nice deep brown color, lots of life to it. Smell and taste are quite similar, unfortunately, I'm not a huge coffee fan and that kind of overpowers the rest of what is going on. Some malt and rather sweet for the style. Mouthfeel is nice and medium in body. Drinkability is good, but again coffee is not really my thing so a bit much for me."
"I don't like this quite as much as regular Bender, as the coffee masks the hoppiness that I really like and gets a bit tiring after a pint or two. It's still a nice, lighter, coffee brew."
"Pours a slightly murky dark reddish orange, light brown hues, very thick tan head forms, drops a ton of lace chunks on the glass, slowly settles down to a thin layer, good retention, looks nice. Smell is yummy, caramel, toast, floral and grapefruit hops, nice and earthy, light coffee roast, fruit, pineapple, biscuity malt, coffee plays real nice with the normal Bender. Taste is just as nice, caramel and biscuit, dry toasty malts, light chocolate, coffee, grapefruit and pineapple although not as pronounced as the aroma, earthy, light bit of sour fruit, more coffee roast, nicely balanced finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, very smooth and drinkable. Still think I prefer the regular Bender, but the coffee gives this a pretty cool dimension, just enough to make it interesting. Really nice stuff, thanks Scotty!"
"Future outlook: Sigh....I love all 3 of the Surly brews that I've been lucky enough to try...BUT....I cannot purchase Surly here in Ohio....so I'll enjoy the few I have left, and then start wondering when and from where my next fix will arrive...."
"D - goes down smooth and easy, it's just a matter of how much coffee taste the drinker can stand, personally 2 in a sitting is enough for me."
"Easy and enjoyable to drink."
"I honestly didn't know that Coffee Bender would be this good. Then again, with Bender as a base beer, it would pretty hard to go wrong no matter what was added (within reason). The original is still the best, but damn!... this is outstanding ale."
"D: I'm enjoying this, though I prefer the non-coffee version more."
"Ultimately I believe bender from futurama would truly be proud to share a name with such a fantastic beer."
"D: I really enjoyed this. Just a really great coffee beer. Not the best I have had but a damn fine beer. I would be putting away cans of this on the regular if it were available near me. Again thanks go out to pepsican for the opportunity to try this."
"Pours a translucent brown in color with a good inch of head forming on the pour. To be honest it looks a bit thin. Smell is subtle but well done coffee. Taste is good. A near perfect balance between brown ale and coffee. The coffee doesn't dominate the underlying beer and is a complimentary flavor to the overall offering. Very well done. Easy and very smooth drinking for a coffee flavored beer. Another great one from Surly."
"Overall: Amazing beer, great mouthfeel, well carbonated and light-medium bodied. Not as drinkable as Bender though, the taste wears you down a bit."
"Thanks just the same to Joe for including it as an extra, I'm always looking to try a new beer."
"Poured into my Surly glass a very nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger creamy tan head, with lots of thick/creamy sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with a good hint of coffee. The taste is bitter, malty, very nice touch of coffee notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, another excellent brew from Surly."
"Surly Coffee Bender pours a finger of creamy tan foam over an almost opaque coffe-colored brew. The nose is fresh brew and mocha. The flavor is esspreso bean dominating toasty malts with a sharp grassy/herbal hop off the back. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and crisp, finishing dryish. In my opinion it's not as rich and complex as the original Bender, but on the other hand the original Bender isn't made with coffee either. Iced espresso plus alcohol equals satisfaction!"
"The coffee is very pronounced, in a good way. I didn't expect to like it this much. It's very dark, and has a healthy amount of foam when you pour it, but it goes away quickly."
"M/D - medium bodied and nice carbonation, overall a very nice tasting beer and I'm glad I have a six pack sitting in my fridge."
"Courtesy of DbHog. Served in my SA Sensory Pint. Poured a deep brown that appears maroon when backlit. Frothy one inch head slowly receded leaving behind thick bands of lacing. Robust, roasted coffee nose; incredible aroma with no charred characteristics. Taste follows nose but also detected a nutty quality in the mix with a touch of char at the finish. Mouthfeel was creamy, light to medium in body, with a mild carbonation. Incredibly easy drinking and flavorful. What an amazing session brew. I am quickly becoming a Surly fan."
"D. Quite drinkable from a ABV standpoint and overall feel. I love coffee but more ""beer"" here would be nice - one or two of these would be my limit."
"D - Would tire."
"D: Extremely drinkable, I am sad I shared this with my friends since I can't get it up here."
"As the beer warms up, it starts taking on a less bitter, more sweet flavor. The feel is still thick and almost chewy, but very refreshing. This beer couples well with a lot of desserts I make and also stands alone as a fine testament of alcoholic beverages. To sum it up in one word: yum."
"D: A very good and very drinkable brew. If there is any knock against it, this one is not as complex as most Surly offerings. Still, a very fine beer from an excellent brewery. Seek it out!"
"Coats your tongue like a frappe. Good ass beer. I think I can taste the cigarette's and early winter morning chill when drinking this beer. Excellent brew."
"Wow...I had to come back in and amend my review...this beer really hits me in two distinct ways....I feel like I just pounded a triple shot espresso of dark Italian roast...and like I mainlined some 180 proof...feel great...all to the head...very clean...feels very nice!!"
"Overall, a very nice beer from Surly!"
"Glad I got to try this one.. I'm not sure I would buy this one regularly but its a nice novelty..."
"D-Lower abv makes this a very easy drinking beer.It would be a tough call between my morning coffee or a Coffee Bender on the weekends."
"Drinkability is awesome. I'll be picking this up again. Highly recommended."
"16oz can thanks to vwcraig. Dark brown, red tints, smells like a handful of roasted beans. The flavor nails the coffee aspect and reminds me of a truly enjoyable morning cup as opposed to a lot of the other coffee beers that taste more like old grounds than fresh coffee. I don't usually like coffee beers but this one is an exception."
"I like the interplay between coffee and maltiness, but I think it could be better. I'm guessing that mixing coffee and beer is just difficult to get perfect, but given Surly's dedication to making great beer, I'm sure they will keep improving."
"Big ol' kudos to jjanega08 for the 4 pack. If only I could keep my s.o. from drinking the rest."
"Drinkability: At 5.1%, this is one very sessionable brew, flavorful, rich, aromatic, and smooth while still being assertive. A definite recommendation, especially if you like coffee, which just so happens to be true for me."
"Dark ruby body. Fluffy brown head has great retention. Lacing is quite full. Nice mix of roasted malts and coffee on the nose. Coffee is the domineering aroma as it should be. The flavor is very nicely integrated. I love the Bender, and even though this has a heavy coffee influence on the buds, the Bender traits are still perceptible. Almost like a coffee milkshake. Nice creamy body and light carbonation. Quite drinkable. A good beer breakfast or desert. I can only think of 2 coffee beers that I've liked better, Bell's Java Stout and Central Waters Coffee Stout."
"Another winner in a can from Surly. A very drinkable brown ale with some good coffee character."
"Thanks Jason for passing along my way. I appreciate your generous trades."
"Quite drinkable, although not recommended for those who arent into coffee. Perhaps too bold and complex to be a true session beer, but i could easily see knocking a few pints of this back at a sitting. Im thinking this would be a perfect brew in front of a fire after a long day. Im happy they are canning this one, and will be drinking this again very soon. Highly recommended for fans of coffee."
"I will purchase this again, but I will purchase much more Furious to just keep on hand."
"This beer pours nearly opaque deep brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into nice rings of lacing. The aroma is of coffee beans, with nutty caramel malt beneath. The taste is a little maltier than the aroma, but there is still a ton of coffee. There is all the malty depth of regular Bender, but it seems more accentuated by the coffee. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a great beer. I have a feeling that I will be drinking this beer a lot."
"This falls under the novelty COFFEE (uppercase) beer (lowercase) category. Not that I don't like this a lot, but I'd like to have a coffee beer that is more beer and less coffee."
"Pours a dark red/brown color with ruby highlights, a nice fluffy tan head, and good lacing down the Surly coffee mug. Nice, bitter coffee aroma, some good hop smells coming in at the end all mixed with some light chocolate. Very nice coffee flavor here, silky smooth roasty malts, and a light bitterness on the finish. This is a very tasty brown ale as it is, but the coffee brings it to another level. I've had it on tap before (Darkness Day) and I think I prefered the tap version. It's seemed a little creamier and more silky than from the can, but it's still delicious nonetheless. Very nice Surly. You've done it again."
"The tap has a bit more creamyness and smoothness to it, from what I remember. Time to experiment and find out where I might find any real differences..."
"HV"
"poured very dark brown with minimal head. Strong smell of coffee!!! Taste is wonderful, strong coffee taste with roasted malts. Perfect carbonation is very light from look expected a little more thickness to it. I could sit down and drink a couple of these, very smooth!"
"Wonderful coffee flavor but it seems unbalanced in this relatively light body. Other coffee beers have more substance to them. Does not look as nice as regular Bender as a head never really forms and there is minimal lacing left on the glass. Coffee dominants the aroma and flavor. I do not get anything to even come close to balance or compliment the coffee. I just feel coffee compliments bigger beers than a brown ale."
"From a can poured into a smaller tasting glass and shared with others. Appearance is a murky amber brown with a tan head. Decent lacing. Aroma smells awesome of freshly ground high-quality coffee and some citrus hops in the background. Taste was....a little disappointing compared to the aroma. First off was the thin mouthfeel which surprised me considering the line-up of big beers that Surly makes. The flavors were rather thin, too, and was dominated by the coffee with little malt or hop flavor to balance things out. Too much carbonation in this beer probably allowed the mouthfeel to seem a little thin. I'll try it again, but I've had much better coffee beers than this."
"Dark black, head fades rather quick. Aroma is very pleasant- like a good black coffee with a noticable back. I'm pretty impressed with that aspect. Taste is good. The original bender is still apparent, but it's accented with the wonderful coffee flavors, and either more chocolate, or the chocolate flavor is also created with the addition of the coffee. I'm getting a kick out of these Surly brews. Worth a taste for sure."
"D: Pretty damn drinkable considering how much coffee I drink. Low ABV and plenty of coffee smoothness to keep enjoying. yeah this beer is very refreshing and I wish it came in 6 paks."
"This is a MUST TRY for anyone who likes coffee and likes beer. Costs about 12$ for a 4 pack, $3 a beer aint so bad, if you consider that last week the only place to find this was at the bar."
"It's awesome to have another Surly brew in cans. I have never had this beer on tap so it was new to me. I was a little surprised that it wasn't more coffee-like. Good stuff though I think I may like regular Bender a little more, as the original seems to be a little sweeter than this one."
"D: Usually I don't find coffee beers that drinkable, but this one is very easy drinking. This is surprising giving how much coffee is actually present."
"This was a great coffee beer. One of my favorites. Lighter then others in feel, but the freshness of the brewed coffee flavor was soo spot on. I am very happy to have a good supply of this one."
"D= very high. Screams session!"
"I was leery of trying this beer because I am a huge Surly fan and because of the hype did not want a let down....no worries, it was a great experience. The smell of coffee is much more prominent that I expected. The chocolate flavors really come thru as well. Very good drinkability...not sure it would be a good session beer, but I would maybe alternate between a Coffee Bender and Furious. Cheers!!"
"D: Pretty damn drinkable considering how much coffee I drink. Low ABV and plenty of coffee smoothness to keep enjoying."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite brown ales and a great release from Surly. I am very happy this is now in cans and I will do my part to make sure it pays off for Omar and every one else at Surly."
"Very nice pick me up after a very long day at work. Maybe I'll have on for breakfast?"
"Overall: This, in my humble opinion, is a world-class coffee beer. And that's what you can expect from Surly, world-class beers. When I first had this beer it seemed a bit more coffee forward but now, out of the can, it seems a lot more balanced. I used to tell my pals that enjoy good beer to try this brew even if they didn't like coffee; well now that rings more true than ever. This is the perfect balance between beer and coffee and I am practically giddy that I have three more cans in my fridge. Obtain this, however you can."
"Mouthfeel is great for a brown ale, but this isn't a brown ale, it is a little thin for a porter, but this isn't a porter, oh, I am confused. This is way too easy to drink and I can see the caffeine and alchohol fighting out which should win."
"D- Extremely drinkable. Will definitely have this gem again."
"D-My only regret with this beer is that I had it after having several other beers, I would love to try this beer as my first of the night...oh and get a growler(hint, hint). Very good beer and as always...I'm impressed with Surly."
"9/4/7/4/17/4.1"
"D: Coffee Bender is crazy drinkable. I probably wouldn't be able to put down more than a couple pints at a time, but those pints would go down very smooth. Another winner from Todd and Surly."
"Surly knows how to do it, and they've done it again. This is fantastic beer, and I would get myself a ton of this if I lived nearby. I had two pints on tap and felt like moving on, but my sister gave me a 4 pack of regular Bender and I've been leaving a cup or so of coffee in my press each morning to stir in with my beers that night. One to go!"
"D-As the mug stated, ""It's never to early to get surly."" I could easily see myself enjoying this brew with breakfast (don't know if that's good or bad...). I thought it was tasty, maybe not overly complicated, but enjoyably different."
"had it out of the can about six months later. proves to be a bit more of an american porter style to the porter part of the beer. chocolatey... with a nice coffee. coming to realize that this is a fantastic midwest opportunity."
"the more I have it, the more I like it, so maybe it's better than I think. Read some other reviews, I'm flailing here."
"I have always enjoyed Surly products and was excited to enjoy this one while at Flossmoor Station. This beer pours like and looks like missippi muddy water. While a dark beer, it doesn't have the presence of an oil-colored stout. The smell is about average and brings a nice aeroma of coffe and malt to the nose. As for drinking it is quite tasty without an overbearing taste of coffee. Because of some of these charactoristics, I find this beer to be very drinkable and several can be enjoyed in the same sitting without doing too much damage."
"Pours a muddy, murky brown, looks almost creamy. A good frothy head forms and holds pretty good for so much froth. Good lacing. Tons of coffee. Maybe a bit of toffee or cocoa in the back but mostly just big time coffee. Taste reminds me of a great iced coffee with an adult twist. Very nice raw flavors deeply roasted coffee with a nice harsh touch. Sweetness balances things out a bit. Body is actually only medium and has a great creaminess. Drinks every good and went great with my brunch."
"On-tap at Barley John's. The aroma is coffee-ih. Good looks, black with lots of white head. Better tasting than Town Hall's coffee stout, average mouthfeel. Appropriate carbonation. Just too coffee, what is it about these local coffee beers?I just couldn't take more than a couple sips. Overated."
"On tap, pours a deep brown with half a finger of mocha head. Nose- huge waft of coffee rinds, very fresh and medium roast, some chocolate just beautiful. Taste- fresh coffee in forefront, with nuts, caramel and light milk chocolate. freaking delicious! Mouthfell is medium bodied with carbonation on the low side to made it go down like melted butter. Hops show up in the finish to help clean away the strong coffee flavour and make you go back for more."
"Today was my first dance with Coffee Bender and hopefully I see this one around more often. Bender is very unique and enjoyable brown ale all by itself, the addition of coffee just adds to the depth of the original."
"Drinkability- This is by far my new favorite brew and probably favorite of all time. I think it edged out the ABYSS and Alaskan Smoked Porter. I drove all the way to Minneapolis to drink as much Darkness as possible and ended up have two glasses of it and probably ten glasses of this. Obviously I love my coffee. I also loves me a good Brown Ale. Well, Bender + Coffee = Amazing! Seek, this, out."
"For a coffee beer this stuff is very drinkable. You kind of have to like coffee to really enjoy this one to it's full extent as it's bursting with it."
"D= Decently good drinkability, though the big coffee flavors make this one I wouldn't want to drink all night. Definitely worth a try though!"
"Drinkability is great! Coffee and beer - I love it! Surly hits another home run here."
"as with some of the other nuts on this site i also had this wonerful concoction at about 8:00 am at darkness day when they set out a keg for all to have a verry classy move if i do say so my self anyways on to the reveiw most delicious with the smell of fresh coffee just the kick i was looking for the flavor of a nice french press cup of good coffee (not to be comfused with the crap i drink all day at work) an exceptionaly smooth feel and man oh man could i drink this all day long but the keg was dry soon after no appearance decription as i drank mine out of a 20 oz dite coke bottle i found in the back seat of my car"
"M/D: Very smooth to drink, but i'm not very sure how much of this I could drink, as I'm not much of a coffee drinker to start with. It's good to have on occasion, but I wouldn't want to session this."
"Goes down like water, even at 8 AM. Thanks for turning my cute little drinking problem into full-blown alcoholism, Surly."
"For coffee lovers, a very nice treat indeed."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp and smooth. This is really an easy drinking coffee brew and very damn enjoyable if you ask me. I would have like to have ordered another but I had to run. One of my favorite Surly offerings from fests and I'm glad to see it on tap in my area."
"D: I could have this all day long, which was unexpected from a coffee-style beer. Absolutely another great Beer from Surly."
"Big coffee flavor, high quality, freshly ground. Acidic fruitiness, long lingering bitter/dry finish. Nutty almond flavor, lightly malty. The coffee really dominates, but it's balanced enough to drink quite a bit. Easy going with light carbonation. This is a unique and flavorful coffee beer, not too under/overdone...just right!"
"Nice coffee flavors really meld with the brown ale characteristics and subdue the hop somewhat until the very finish. Hints of milk chocolate, burnt malts, dark breads, roasty caramel tones, with a good amount of light coffee showing in the middle that leads into a piney earthy hop finish. Not overly complex with a mouthfeel that shows spicey carbonation. Very good and easy drinking but something has got me."
"D: Yet again another beer I could drink all day and all night, if you put this under my nose with a blindfold one I would never ever mistake this for a beer, I dont really see how that description fits into the drinkablility factor but thinking about it makes me want another one of these beers so bad it makes my brain hurt just thinking about it."
"I've noted this before, but I like flavored beers more with brown ales than porters. I like the blending better and the drinkability. This is a good drinking experience."
"D: Another tasty brew from Surly, one I'd want to find again - perhaps at the source? (I found it good, but not as outstanding as many previous reviewers). Coffee flavor grew a little heavy and bitter, but I am a fan of dark roasts and drink my coffee 'black', so I was still pleased. Not the type of beer you'd want to have every day, but certainly a nice addition to the lineup - I'm glad Surly finally made an appearance in Oregon!"
"After drinking a can of furious last week, this beer more then any other was something I was looking forward to at the OBF. All the more reason it was the disappointment of the festival. Maybe it just didn't travel well from Minn. to Portland. Oh well..."
"I had this on tap at the Map Room in Chicago. Previously I've had the standard Bender from a can several times thanks to my brother in Minneapolis, but it's been a while and I can't compare it easily with this coffee-infused version. Anyway, the coffee style is really good. The beer is very dark, almost black with a thick creamy tan foam. The aroma is coffee and chocolate, a little sweet malt also. Very appetizing, and the taste is just as good. Lots of coffee, a solid malt base, and a little chocolate sweetness as well (maybe my imagination). I've liked just about every coffee beer I've tried, and Surly does it well."
"D-This is a wonderful coffee beer. A ""light"" bodied brew wtih gobs of coffee...I love it!"
"Glad I had this beer. I would not drink it all night long, but it was a great way to start the night."
"D: This left a wonderful high quality coffee aftertaste in my mouth. So sessionable. I could start with this one in the morning and drink it all day!"
"Had this at the tasting last night at Common Roots Cafe. This was my first coffee infused beer and it was quite enjoyable. The appearance was a little muddy but attractive. I'm curious to know if it's difficult for the coffee to completely meld with the beer. The smell was of what else, coffee - a nice, dark, rich coffee. It was the taste that really got me. The bitterness of the coffee and hops seemed to compliment, encourage and smooth each other other as if they were always meant to be together. Nice creaminess and very drinkable - especially during the extreme cold we're having now. It's not something that I would want to have at any time but it is very good."
"Poured out black with a nice head that retained well. Smell was of old coffee, maybe a little cream to the nose as well; wasn't good. Taste was full of old and not enjoyable coffee. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and medium carbonation levels. Drinkability is not good. I didn't even finish my first glass of it. Surly makes good beer, but this was disappointing. Give me the regular Bender."
"Roast beef, Chocolate, maybe some game."
"A superb coffee beer in all aspects. Really glad I got the chance to try this one. I find myself anxiously awaiting them to can/bottle this..."
"Upon first taste, I realized this was the perfect beer to this even... 10AM, sitting around with a bunch of folk who've been up for hours. Coffee, rich and glorious roasted coffee paired with that beautiful brew Bender, sweet toffee, chocolate, all those fine qualities plus the added dimension make this one special brew. The body and carbonation are the same as normal Bender, very creamy smooth. Three cheers to the Surly crew for one fine beverage."
"D - Defiantly a nice drinkable coffee beer. This beer is very nicely balanced making it more enjoyable than standard coffee beers in my opinion."
"Probably the only chance I'll get at this beauty. Glad to have been given the opportunity."
"Overall, I really liked the beer, but it's certainly not an everyday beer. Tip of the cap to Coffee & Tea Limited, who apparently provide the coffee for the CB. I'm sure you will benefit from this partnership."
"The drinkability was very good, this is one fine easy drrinking coffee brew. Prosit, MK"
"D- Very easy and simple to drink not hard at all as some coffee beers can be."
"D: This is the second best coffee beer I've had next to the legendary Speedway stout. But the Speedway didn't ""focus"" on the coffee like this one does. T-R-E-M-E-N-D-O-U-S. This is so much better than the standard Bender its ridiculous."
"One of the best beers I've ever had the privilege of drinking. The friends who shared the growler with were also very impressed and the beer went faster than I thought. For such a flavorful beer it was extremely drinkable. In fact I wish I was drinking it right now."
"a big caffeinated thanks to my sis for procuring a growler of this for me at x-mas."
"It would be nice to pour this from the Coffee pot every morning. Great beer."
"This beer has a remarkable scent. It smells like Starbucks coffee. I think that it is a bit overcarbonated and that the body is a bit thin, but the smell and taste are absolutely wonderful, and I could drink this all night."
"Just tried the canned version and this is beer is more balanced, but hardly less tasty. You can still taste the malts and hops here. Delicious."
"Same dark brown as regular bender, identical until the nose. Massive rich, fresh brewed coffee, its rare that a coffee beer smell this fresh and deep, I could smell this beer all day, perfect. Taste is much more like the standard bender at first, but with a little more warmth the coffee really stands out and is great with the roasted and hoppy flavors of the Bender. Great, rare, yet worth seeking out. Keep 'em coming Surly"
"This is one hell of a beer, not for the faint of heart. Alright, so the regular Bender by Surly is one outstanding beer, it's tough to put your finger on just what it is, porter or brown ale, but there is Belgian malts and its quite hoppy. As Feloniousmonk, the first reviewer of this beer, said Bender's more 'subtle' qualities definitely get wiped out by this coffee infused treat, but who cares?! This beer is awesome! If you didn't tell them, some people might not even know there was booze in this right when you handed it to them. It is dark, rich, and bitter just like espresso. When we finally got to try this at the Blue Nile, we just sat around smelling this beer for probably 5 minutes or so before we even tasted it. It was almost like putting your nose into a bag of fresh ground coffee, delicious. The taste was rich and bitter like espresso, but oh wait, the edge gets taken off because it's actually a beer! A deep creamy beer at that. Perfect combination, thank you Surly. This would be a tough one to have more than two beers of, its just too rich and dark, but the two you do are damn good."
"Medium to full body, long, coffee-tinged finish, unflinchingly flavorful, and still an easy treat to drink down. This has met with near unanimous praise among those I've witness enjoy it, and I can only hope it's attempted again and again, so that more may discover this jolt of joy for java freaks, and beer geeks alike."
