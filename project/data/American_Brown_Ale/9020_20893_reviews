"carbonation kills it...partly. toasty/nutty aroma & taste. but overall a strange taste complexion, just doesn't work well. the sharpness of the carbonation does not help. looks nice though"

"The beer does not taste good."

"This beer would have received a higher review had been in the correct category as per a brewery rep it is an amber ale"
""
""
""
"O - I like it. More flavor than a Yard's Brawler with more flavor. Impressive for a 3.5% brew. Rating to style yields good marks for this brew."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, bready, nutty. Taste is the same, lots of bready malts, nutty, light hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."

"Dark brown to mohaghony in color with a fingernail of off white head.  Light Brussels lacing.  Aroma is comprised of dark malt and isn't very strong.  I taste dark malt with a slight note of spice similar to that of rye.  I'm thinking that is the flaked maize.  The mouth is creamy with that slight spice note at the back of the palate."

"Pours reddish brown with a slight off white head. Aroma is bready, nutty, and roasty giving off some mild chocolate. Flavor follows suit with a very mild grassiness in the finish. A creamy, medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, not a fan of this one at all but not a bad beer from a more objective perspective. To me, this beer was a roastier version of an alt while also reminding me way too much of New Belgium's Fat Tire."

"Overall, a pretty nice, easy drinking beer. There is not a whole lot going on here but enough to keep a very light beer interesting."
""
""
""
"O - Really solid brown ale - I am shocked the the amount of flavor when it is only 3.5 % abv - really packs a big flavor punch for low ABV."
""
""
""
"The feel was also deeply influenced by the high carbonation. Airy and expansive the bubbling caused a small bit of sharpness in the throat."

"Great beer year round! Recently tipped 2 back with a Porterhouse Steak..Phenomenal The way the Perros paired with the porterhouse. Definitely worth a try with or without the steak. This Yazoo brew will always do....Seriously though this beer is pretty good you need to try it if your able to do so"

"A medium brown in color with a thin tan head. Aromas of light milk chocolate. Taste is quite sweet caramel, and some toasty bread. A hint of hops to balance. Mouthfeel is amazingly rich. Overall this beer is remarkably flavorful for a mere 3.5% abv. I would certainly get this again."
""
"After seeing some of the higher ratings I was expecting more. Worthy for sure but, for me, that is as high as I see this one."
""
"O: This one surprised me. The look just had me a bit cautious but for a 3.5 brown this is very drinkable and could work on a hot or a cool day. good work."
""
"This beer pours a light bodied brown in color with a good amount of carbonation and a beige lacing around my glass. It gives off aromas of light chocolate malts, caramel, and toffee. It finishes with light bitterness. You can definitely tell it's Munich dark malt. All are very light and well integrated. It tastes of light chocolate malt and again is very heavy on the Munich malts. It it lightly bitter and subtly sweet. It tastes like a less nutty Altbairisch. It drinks very light and is as refreshing as a brown ale can be. For a smaller beer it has solid flavor and is a solid choice."
""
""
""
"A nice malty treat that you could enjoy over conversation with some friends."
""
"Had on tap at Buscuit and Blues, Natchez, MO. Pours a light amber brown with thick foamy head into mug. Some roasted malts and slight coffee aromas. Taste is crisp lightly roasted malts, with subtle coffee and chocolate. Some bready malt finish. Its easy drinker especially under 4%abv. Its a good brew, not amazing but the best (only)craft brew on tap here. But I did get a second..."
""
""
"this has a bit too much coffee flavor for my personal taste, but it's easy to drink with a great mouthfeel"
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good tasting beer, I wish I had a few more of them, quite a few more and some limes."
""
"Poured from the bottle, this ale was a thin brown color with an half inch head. Any head quickly disappeared to leave trace patterns of foam on the top of the glass. The aroma was particularly bold for a brown ale as the malt was an attention grabber. The taste was watery up front before growing progressively maltier. Notes of chocolate and corn were hidden among the malt selections. In the aftertaste, a mild citrus hop note is detectable among the malts. Because this ale is a little thicker than most brown ales, the aftertaste is allowed to linger a little longer than usual. Overall, this is an above average brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Like I stated before, this won't please everyone, but I tip my hat to Yazoo for making a Dos Equis-style brew that is at least twice as good as the afore-mentioned brewski."

"It was okay, not my particular favorite and not on par with some of the other brews from Yazoo."

"O- A flavorful brown ale that is very drinkable"

"Overall - very interesting beer in its concept. I just wish it could dome out a little more in the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance looks much like iced tea - dark brown and transparent around the edges with a small quick-fading head. Malt and floral scents are weak. The taste is a bit sweet, bready, and a bit herbal. Mouthfeel is on the thin side. Not bad, but not great either."
""
"o - Overall a nice session beer and a nice brown ale; I liked this one much more then their Pale Ale. The nose and taste are a nice mix of nuts, roasted malts, and caramel, and it is very easy to drink with the smooth body and very low ABV. Worth checking out and would have it again."
""
"O – Little thin for my liking but it has a nice easy drinking flavor. Could absolutely have a few of these sitting around. Good not great but well worth a buy."
"Palate is bubbly and dry but super sessionable. Wish they had this on tap by me in IL."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is okay, really doesn't seem like a brown ale. I would not mind trying this again to see of the tartness was a bad or out dated bottle. Maybe 10 months old is too old."
"Overall a solid session beer."
""
"This is a real thirst quenching beer. It's mild and enjoyable. I could drink a lot of these and be happy. However, the flavor isn't strong enough to be a really good beer. Nothing to write home about."

"On a trip to nashville how can you not get some yazoo? This poured a serious dark auburn. Light white foam head that had mostly faded by the time it got to me. The aroma was a nice combo of sweet malt and a touch of roast with some corn in there too, but it works. The taste was super sweet but had almost a faint smokiness in the background. The mouthfeel was akin to boston lager, and overall that's the beer it most reminded me of. Though it was a half step above. Overall good and clearly a brewery that nashville is proud of and from what I've tasted it seems appropriate."
""
"P – Great affinity for TexMex and BBQ."

"Taste is sweet up front, with a light roast and more caramel tones. I get a little coffee, too. Finishes with a slightly acidic citrus hop zest. Somehow, this one seems a little off-balance. I get too much sweet and tartness. Not one I'd pursue again."
"Overall Impression- This is one of my first drain pours of the Fall... For some reason, there was such a great aroma but nothing in the taste or mouthfeel... Like water with a bit of sugar and hop added. May need to try this again to see if the Bottled date was too long ago..."
"O- A nice Yazoo offering, and one of their staples. Nice out of the bottle, but better on tap."
"Overall impression - not too shabby. To its credit, Dos Perros does open up well, and the carbonation is tamed some. Worth a shot. I'd drink it from time to time if Yazoo were in Ohio."
"OK at best...okay not really...pretty mediocre as there are some odd notes that just don’t do it for me here."
"Really a interesting beer and it drinks bigger than it's supposed 3.5% abv."
"Overall: This is a frequent go-to for me. I highly recommend giving it a shot if you're in Tennessee or North/Mid Alabama."
"The mouthfeel of Dos Perros is both smooth and crisp and just like the taste, there is no syrupy or processed mouthfeel that is left because of the good malt nature of the beer. The offering is rather crisp in nature and all told is a nice balance of complexity. In terms of drinkability, the Dos Perros could be a very nice session beer as the ABV is a low 3.5% and when coupled with the smoothness and crisp nature of the beer you are left with a good tasting beer that is sure to not let you down."
"This beer pours a light bodied Pepsi brown in color with a good amount of carbonation and a beige lacing around my glass. It gives off aromas of light chocolate malts, caramel, and toffee. It finishes with light bitterness. You can definitely tell it's Munich dark malt. All are very light and well integrated. It tastes of light chocolate malt and again is very heavy on the Munich malts. It it lightly bitter and subtly sweet. It tastes like a less nutty Altbairisch. It drinks very light and is as refreshing as a brown ale can be. For a smaller beer it has solid flavor and is a solid choice."
"Overall Impression: I wasn’t sure what to expect from this beer, and it was definitely different. The aroma left evidence of a flavorful beer, but the ABV indicated that it was a session beer. It was very drinkable, and it had a little more flavor than most session beers. However, I felt that the light flavors were a bit of a tease, and it felt a bit watered down in the follow through. I’m not opposed to light session beers, but the lighter flavors left me wanting something a bit more bold."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a smallish tightly bubbled khaki head that quickly dissipates to a ring on top. Smells of caramel, brown bread, applesauce, brown sugar. There's more in the nose than I was expecting. Taste is light and sweet malts with a hint of tart and astringency. Watered down brown sugar water with hints of fruit and bread kind sums up this experience. Thinnish body medium to high level of carbonation, watery prickly mouthfeel. This smelled a whole lot better than it tasted. Average beer at best."
"Got this in a trade. It pours a nice dark cola brown, with a fizzy off-white head that dissipates rather quickly. Malty aroma has a fruity undertone and a hint of caramel, and is very inviting. Mouth-filling flavor is this beer's strongest point - rich and malty with hints of caramel, brown sugar and apple and just a whisper of banana. Texture is smooth, but lacking in fizz. Overall, this is a truly worthy ale. If ever you are in Nashville, look for this one - and its siblings."
"A lovely session brown from Yazoo. I'd never guess the ABV was so low from the taste, but really appreciate that I can have a decent beer without worrying about a buzz. The flavor is a simple and balanced bready and nutty caramel, sort of a like a cleaned up Newcastle. There's a pleasant little kick of toffee and the end and the beer finished slightly sweet."
"Without the lime, Dos Perros is very drinkable - a good option for filling your growler - and a great place to start sampling Yazoo's lineup of standard styles before moving on to some of their more adventurous varieties."
"From the sampler flight at the brewery. Dark brown with a light tan head that has descent retention and soapy lace. The smell is of chocolate malt, a touch of roast, coffee notes, and light earthy hops in the back. The taste follows with some dark fruit hidden under chocolat and roasted malt, and a touch of spicy, earthy hops. A bit watery, but it is a low gravity beer. Lots of flavor for such a light bodied but dark beer. Easy to drink."
"A staple beer for anyone living in middle Tennessee. Dos Perros is a good beer which presented with very little head. Often this beer is sered too cold as it was last night at The Palm restaurant in downtown Nashville. Order it and let it sit a little and as it warms is choclate notes are more evident and it tastes better. An area this beer could be better is mouthfeel. A little too much carbonation at times. Try it if you get a chance - one of my favorite Yazoo beers.."
"D-very drinkable. Taste was gone in no time. Very respectable that I didn't expect."
"Pours an orangish brown with a bit of white head. No real lacing to speak of. Smells sweet and roasty. Lots of malts on the nose and a nice roasted smell. Tastes pretty sweet and malty. There is a nice roast across it that blends well with the malt profile. A bit sharp on the tongue due to high carbonation. Pretty drinkable but at 3.5 percent I would hope so!"
"*Trader's note: Many thanks to CurtisMcArthur for the fresh bottle."
"Very easy to drink. Very light overall with a clean finish. Sessionable."
"Good..wouldn't turn it down...wouldn't buy an entire 6 pack of it either."
"Paying homage to the Mexican/Vienna beers. Enough head to get by, clear reddish brown color. Smells of German dark bread, subtle floral hops and cocoa powder. This ale has some body for a smaller beer, but still leans toward the dry side. Milk-like sweetness form the maize adds some depth to the clean, toasty maltiness. Light peck of hop spice and floral bitterness level this beer out. Of course, we have to use ""session beer"" somewhere in this review--a damn good one at that."
"Carbonation is medium with a medium light body. The lighter body really adds to the drinkability. I've enjoyed this beer several times and just wish some of the coffee noted wouild transfer to the taste."
"D- This beer was very drinkable. It's nothing special at all and I can respect that as just a easy drinking brown ale. ABV is low that you can make this a nice session beer. Not bad from a company that I look forward to trying more of in the future."
"After drinking this beer I'd like to try more of Yazoo's beers, especially their Irish stout and APA."
"Drinkability is high. It's not a bad beer, but It's not a very good representative of the style either."
" The taste is ok. Sweet, darkened caramel flavor that seems to be a little washed out by the watery body and light carbonation. The finish is ok, but leaves me wondering where the beer went."
"Beer is thin and has an odd late bitterness / aftertaste that tastes like wheat and roasted grains. There is little in the forward palate and its not a very desirable beer."
"This is my favorite regular offering from Yazoo."
"Im eating 3 meat, spicy spaghetti and this beer is going down great...a great big food beer!"
"I love Yazoo, I don't think I've had a beer that I haven't liked from them."
"Not too too bad, but nothing really to write home about. The appearance is light and transparent with a brownish color and thin off white foam head. The aroma is somewhat nutty and malty but nothing too big sticks out. Has good carbonation. The flavors were very distinguishable."
"Overall, I'm impressed. Nice surprise."
"At the Flying Saucer in Memphis, TN. Poured a cloudy chestnut brown, with one finger of off-white head, and good retention. Smelled malty, with hints of caramel and toffee. The taste certainly revealed a nice malty, caramel/toffee balance, dissolving to a modestly sweet finish. Thinner than it looks, with modest carbonation, but definitely sessionable."
"Drinkability? Fantastic. Agreeably flavorful, easy on the alcohol, beautifully balanced, tasty and moreish. Underrated gem from Yazoo in my homer opinion."
"Dark coppery-brown in color. Smells richly of chocolate and vanilla. Taste is milk chocolate, light hops and considerable roasted malt. Medium-bodied; Good drinkability & quite tasty!"
"D- Easy to drink, not too light, bitter aftertaste that dissapates quickly"
"D - fantastic! this is one of my favorite beers to drink on a regular basis."
"Taste is really enjoyable, but not the best brown ale I've ever had. Sweet chocolate malt is a definite highlight here, but there is just a hint too much hoppiness in this one for my liking - but not enough to tip the scales too far. Overall this beer has a nice sugaryness to it. Medium body, very smooth, and a pretty good drink. Just doesn't finish as nice - a little bitter."
"Overall, I loved this beer. I haven't had much form Yazoo, but this is one beer that has me loving the brewery so far. I found this be an exceptional brown ale, my favorite of the type I would venture to say at this point in my life, actually. Everyone must try this beer..."
"Now this a different take on an american brown ale,and I kinda like it.Poured a deep tawny brown with a thinner white head atop,deep roast in the nose,along with some brown sugar and a mineral scent.Flavors are roasted with some bitter chocolate, nut and earth round out a soft finish that the flaked maize had a hand in I am guessing.Hmm I had low expectations,but I gotta say it has a uniquness thats pretty good."
"Clear reddish brown in color with steady carbonation and medium head that slowly fizzes to a ring, leaving spots of lacing down the glass. Really like the smell. Toasted malts, chocolate, toffee. Lightly sweet and bready. Even seems to be a bit of spice to it. The taste is less explosive than the nose. Still a nice toasted flavor with bread. Not as much chocolate and a tad more sweetness to the flavor. Light dryness in the finish, steady smooth carbonation. An easy drinker for sure. I like it. Thanks to ckeegan04 for this extra!"
"Drinkability is well its different slightly then most browns but good enough to make me wish i had another."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a clear, brown color. 1/5 inch head of a pale tan color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, yeast, toffee, caramel, and slight nut. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hops, yeast, dark citrus, and slight caramel. Overall, a good blend, body, and complexity. A rather surprising and pleasing american brown ale."
"Drinkability: A pleasant, easy-drinking brew from good ole Yazoo out of Nashville. I should, the Good Lord willing, have no trouble clearing through the remainder of the six-pack."
"Now for the bad news; it's so overly priced I cannot see how they can sell it. There are better beers for a much more affordable price."
"A good, but average Brown from the folks at Yazoo."
"Pours dark brown with an redish tint and very little head. What there is is a thin swirl that eventually disappears completely. Smells earthy, a bit roasty and a touch of piney hops. The taste is sweeter and exhibits some cookie like malt, and a touch of adjunct sweetness, with some fruity flavors up front as well. It drys out a bit toward the end and becomes roastier and earthier. Pretty light overall, but nicely flavorful for the low abv. Smooth and easy to drink, although its a bit club soda like in body right at the beginning. A nice session option."
"Easy drinker and one that brown ale fans should give a try."
"If you can find some, check it out."
"Pours a nice light brown, clear, with reddish/ruby highlights. A White head sits on top, kind of thick, at least 2cms, which stays around, leaving nice lacing, and sending a nice stream of bubbles through the beer. Looks good, very good. It smells like sweet caramel, a bit like cola, with some light hints of milk chocolate. Not much of a hop presence, which is kind of normal, but out of the ordinary as far as American styles go - and I can also smell a bit of yeast, mixing with the malts, to make a very bready kind of smell. Something smells almost raw, like unfermented wort. The taste delivers mostly on the cola nots, like a less sharply carbonated Coca-Cola. There's also a hint of creaminess, a tiny bit of spice from the hops I suppose, and a hint of chocolate. It actually tastes a bit like root beer as well, with very low bitterness, no leafiness, just a hint of earthiness is all. Actually, I would like just a little more, no bitterness, not much with dry hops, but just a little earthiness or maybe some herbal flavors to balance with the sweetness of the malts. Almost not complex enough, but still very nice. The body is kind of medium, maybe a bit on the thin side, but knowing the ABV, that isn't surprising. The carbonation is mild as well, no sting, just a tiny sharp presence on the tongue. There are a few thing that could add some body and complexity, without losing the character of the beer, maybe replacing some of the lighter malt with some roasted malts, maybe adding a little bit more hops towards the end of the boil. But still, it's better than the average brown ale by all means. This is actually a perfect sort of session brown ale. I would probably go to it if I wanted to drink one thing for quite a while. It's very pleasant, sort of inoffensive, and you could definitely do worse. It won't blow you away, but this is a beer you should take a shot at if you can."
"D= This ale was quite different in bottle than it was on tap (previous review). I still liked it though and consider it to be extremely drinkable and sessionable."
"D - Pretty good, easy drinking."
"Drinkability: A highly sessionable beer with lots of great malty flavor. Nicely attenuated. A good brew."
"Poured a standard brown color with a medium head Nose has a malty aroma and tad but hoppy but no nuts or anything like you would expect from a brown. Taste is a little weak for a brown, not much going on and this could be due to a low ABV, but still good. Well balanced with the hops and malts. Easy to drink."
"While on a recent visit to Nashville, I picked up a 6er of this at a local gas station for a very reasonable price. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a nice deep yet clear brown color with a thin, effervescent brown head that quickly dissipates. The smell is malt dominant with lightly toasted notes, chocolate and caramel. The taste reflects the same maltiness, carefully balanced with a light citrus hopping - still slightly sweet but not sickeningly so. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a chewy carbonation and goes down very smooth. Overall a very drinkable beer, I'm glad I picked this sixer up, sad I didn't visit the brewery while I was there!"
"Malt and toasty aromas. Hops aroma is present, but not overpowering. Dark malt character is robust. Light tan head and nice dark brown color. Medium malt flavors with some hop bitterness, but it's very light. Had a good aftertast that was malty sweet, but didn't linger. Overall, this is a good beer. I've had this in bottle and on tap at the brewery."
"Wow...I will admit my beer drinking brethren that I have strayed from the path. I've been enjoying wine quite a bit lately. I'm not sure if it was a skunked Bass or that Milwaukee's Best Ice that gave me the desire for a change of scenery but this one sure brought me back. Had it at Rose Pepper's in Nashville on Tap. Came in a pitcher, great head when poured into my frosty mug and great color somewhere between a Stout and a Nut Brown in color head is a nice creamy off white with streaks of brown. The aroma is where this one got me. I'm not one for that charred over the top roasted malt that I've have found in some beers of this style this one was sweet and malty with just enough roasted character and citrus-like hops to balance it out and the flavor was spot on. This is my first Yazoo and damn am I happy to be so close to Nashville."
"D - Not a bad beer but just not my favorite. Not one I'll seek again but I will be trying their other offerings."
"Another Yazoo beer in a recent beer trade with fsvan. Pours wonderfully, into my Sam Adams sensory glass. I love to smell beers and this one has a distinctive smell, maybe chocolate or coffee, but there's definitely something here for the nose to enjoy. This might be even better than Yazoo's Hefe, which I reviewed previously. If possible, the taste and mouthfeel are even better than the smell. Not thin like a lot of brown ales -- sweetwater in particular. I really like this sampling of Yazoo Dos Perros and would definitely look to pick up a six pack in the near future."
"Nice dark color hinted at what was to come. Distinct chocolate aroma. I enjoyed the slight creaminess of this one. Could taste a chocolate or even hints of coffee as it finished. Nice full flavored yet not overly sweet, which I like."
"Overall, very balanced and drinkable, and exceptionally clean. Quite a well-crafted and rather distinctive brown."
"D- Not a bad drinkability. This is probably an underrated beer, but is very refreshing and easy to drink. I will definitely drink this beer again to support another fairly local southern brewery."
"A nice, but not spectacular brown ale."
"Pours a somewhat dark brown colored body with an off-white head. An aroma of nuttiness, lagerness. Pilsner-like. Chocolaty smelling. Somewhat creamy but mostly watery body, nutty taste, malty. Pretty tasty. Some light chocolate. Sweet tasting."
"Grabbed a glass with the Dos Peros logo from the brewery. My wife loves it..."
"From a 12 oz bottle sent to me from a friend in TN. Aroma is malty with a touch of coffee/bitter chocolate. Color is a deep rusry orange/brick red. Almost no head. Some malt is present, but not overwhelming, with a touch of caramel and a hint of coffee. Bitterness just balances the sweetness, no real hop character, just a little earthy/floral in the background. Body is light for a 5.5% beer. Clean, dry finish with a slight lingering bit of malt."
"Decent brown color, a little light though; a bit of initial head and almost no lacing. Very sweet scent, a bit of malt and a little cocoa, and maybe rice. Adjunct flavor, hints of rice or corn with the usual barley, although the taste is fine if very sweet from this; some hints of a deep flavor in there if they could pull it out. Goes down fine, actually fairly smooth."
"Very good beer. I've had it both draft and from a bottle.I live in Ind. and its not available where I live but my son brings it home from Nashville on the holidays. I have yet to get a bad reaction from anyone that I've provided the beer too. Excellent session beer, light and refreshing."
"PS: The side label goes to some lengths to describe how 'many Mexican beer styles' descend from 'old Austrian styles', citing the late 1800's Austrian rule over Mexico (a fact I did not know, quite frankly) for such influence. I bring this point up because the 'American Brown Ale' designation seems incorrect; not sure where these Two Dogs should lie, but Brown Ale?"
"This is a dark brown beer with a decent head and a mildly malty aroma. It is nice and refreshing with a well carbonated but light mouthfeel. The malt is slightly toasted, and finishes with a bit of sweetness that settles into a subtle hoppiness. Not a bad beer for an afternoon break."
"Solid example of the style, enjoyable and easy to drink."
"A dark brown color with a bit of red. An interesting take on an Austrian/Mexican hybrid style beer. A guinness-esque aroma. The taste has bits of coffee and chocolate latter is more noticeable in the aftertaste. Again, always a pleasure to support the local Brewery."
"D: Let's see--it's got a light body, subtle flavor, and low ABV. This is definitely a sessionable brown ale. Maybe not the best choice if you're looking for an absolute flavor bomb, but that's not what it's trying to be. I prefer to session with hoppier beers, but I'll definitely be bringing some of this to my brown-ale obsessed father."
"Dark newcastle brown with a small white head. Aromas of dark malt, bread, a bit of coffee/chocolate, and some faint hops. Taste follows suit and is non confrontational with a nice caramel breadlike maltiness and subtle hopping. Mouthfeel is very good and drinkaiblity is nice as well. A perfect bottle to chug on a hot Nashville afternoon"
"Drinkability is ok; I would order a few of these at a bar. I was looking for a little more from this one considering the writing on the label said it was a Mexican style, to me it was a good nut brown"
"Rather drinkable. It's pretty good. Nothing to write home about."
"D- Not too bad of a beer to drink."
"pours an amber that borders on brown, i taste strong carmel and toffie malts and a light hop presance that kickes in in the very last moment. their is also a sour presance in the middle of this beer, all the flavors work well with outher. this is an avrage beer that i would drink agan if it crossed my path, this is worth a shot."
"(Thanks Jed!)"
"d - very drinkable and a decent albeit nondescript offering."
"The flavor matched the aroma well, something I like to see with brown ales. Notes of sweet molasses and caramelized bread hit first, while a slight chocolate/roasted nuttiness finished off the taste. Mouthfeel was a little lighter bodied than I would have liked, with a slightly lower than expected carbonation level. Still, this was an excellent brown ale, and one I'll surely be looking to try again."
"This was a good beer, it is nicely balanced, achieves a good blend of malt and hops. Give this beer a try."
"D: Pretty drinkable. I would have had another pint but I had to sample some more of what the J. Clyde had to offer. Very nice and makes me look forward to trying more from Yazoo."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very crisp carbonation. Easy drinking beer."
"D: Very good drinkability. Refreshing and flavorful. This was the third of three Yazoo beers that HollyAnn brought back from Nashville and I liked every one of them."
"This is quite a drinkable beer, that should be served, in my humble opinion, more like a British beer, slightly below room temp for best results. A nice tasty that I will have again the next visit to TN."
"Mouthfeel was a bit thin. Carbonation was mild. Pretty drinkable, especially since browns are not a favorite style of mine."
"I do know that the owner is slowly trying to get Yazoo beers distributed to a wider area, as long as it is presented well enough."
"D - I didn't really care for this one too much."
"O- It is a very solid beer. Another good choice from Yazoo with plenty of flavor to make it worth a try."
"This is a nicely made beer with balanced hops and malt. It was not quite up to what I was hoping for but would definitely not turn down another."
"Mouthfeel redeems it some, it's got good carbonation and a nice chewyness to it, but a little thin. Overall not my favorite brew ever, too sweet, and not enough dimension in the flavor department. But I can see it going well with certain food styles. Not a bad beer."
"D - decent session beer. I'd be curious to try it with a spicy mexican dish."
"Excellent session beer here. Not too strong, but very tasty and easy going down."
"The label doesn't mention a style, but does claim its roots in Austrian-inspired Mexican beers. Despite being fermented as an ale, this is a European amber lager by recipe, not an American Brown. It's got the color of a Maerzen with greater bitterness and hop aroma of a Vienna style."
"This arrived with a not-big head, but a really thick one with a beautiful mocha-brown color and evidencing lots of CO2 bubbles. The color was a deep, cola-colored amber with NE-quality clarity. The nose was light, tending towards sweet. The mouthfeel was medium with a light, malty sweetness on the tongue. The finish was very smoooth with the same malty sweetness that I noted on the tongue continuing to linger. I would mark this one down as a session beer."
"Notes - My wife loves all the beers from this brewery"
"Enjoyed at Buffalo Billiards, Downtown Nashville. The beer stood out immediately at an American Brown Ale, without knowing the style. The beer opens with a mostly-malty, but slightly-toasty aroma with slight hints of chocolate, lactose, and a crisp hop character. The flavors are subtle and light, but take on more chocolate than toast or milk sweetness; but rests on a firm, sweet malt base. The hops are also light, sometimes undecernable between English and American varieties -- yet citrus bittering prevails in the finish. The beer has a moderately light body, but does show nice creaminess and does not waiver. A good Brown, but likely gets lost in the shuffle."
"Poured a deep amber, almost brown, with a big ol tan head. Died semi-fast. Aromas of a sweet malty caramel and chocolate were pleasantly found in this bad boy, and in the quaff. Although, I will say the flavor needed a bit more staying power for this to make up to the next level. Bit thinnish body, but a decent drinking brown that would work for a session."
"Pours a brown color, nice carbonation, huge two-finger plus creamy tannish head, nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, bitter, and a good dose of caramel. The taste is malty, slightly bitter, toffee/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice brown ale, alittle different taste than other's I've had, but still very tasty."
"Appearance is a deep amber color, with lots of head retention. Smell is sweet maltiness, nutty grain, very small hint of hop bite, but not much. Taste reminded me strongly of a bock. Lots of caramel flavors, with a hint of chocolate and some very mild hop bitterness. Finishes slightly dry. Full mouthfeel, fairly drinkable. A decent Vienna-stlye beer."
"Drinkability: beyond the simple flavor profile I found this to be quite easy to drink. Definite session beer, but the flavors are a bit thin to make this an all night beer."
"A decent beer, basically slightly above average. Its your call as to whether to try it. I could have used two or three instead of a full sixer."
"It's drinkable, but not recommended by me anyway. If I ever get the opportunity, I'll give it another chance, probably in bottle form. Not a good showing this time around."
"D: This is by far the best Mexican style beer I have had that was brewed in Tennessee. It had a decent pairing with the tacos, the sweetness balanced the spiciness of the taco. I generally like bolder beers but this has good potential for a session beer."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, good representation of style, this is a beer that well-worth sticking with for an evening and is the type of beer that can either be a good sipper or a good pounder."
"Yazoo's Dos Perros pours a very dark brown body beneath a short head of creamy tan foam. The head retention is average, but it leaves some nice splashes and spots of lace about the glass. A whiff of cocoa greets you in the nose, giving you a hint of what's to come. It's medium-light bodied with a very fine, moderate carbonation that gives a delicate bristle to the tongue. In the flavor it displays a touch of soft milk chocolate, supple dried fruit, a flicker of juicy berries, and a touch of malty toastiness. Its hop flavors and bitterness are limited to allow the maltiness and yeasty fruitiness to shine, yet it's superbly balanced by a delicate acidity that couples with the yeasty fruitiness to give the impression that it's more fruity than it is. It finishes mostly dry with a pinch of cocoa, some lingering apricot-like fruitiness, and the suggestion of some leafy and grassy hops. I found it charming, interesting, enjoyable, and really easy to drink. Highly recommended."
"This is pretty easy drinking if you happen to be in the mood for a sweeter brew."
"Worth a try."
"Pours vibrantly, with a noisy, crackling buff colored head consisting of loosely packed small and medium bubbles. The head was quick to settle, leaving only scant remnants at the margins. Deep amber, crystal clear with plenty of slowly rising carbonation streams. The smell is clean and crisp with some hints of roasted malts and corn. The taste is slightly grainy up front with some corn mixing in as well. There is a slight hint of roast malt bitterness perking up in the finish. Gently hopped, this one finishes with only a soft, trailing floral note. Light body, feels feather light on the tongue, and with gently carbonation. This is an easy drinker that is at home with Mexican food."
"Drinkability- Decent brown ale here. Worth picking up to try once. My first beer from Tennessee!"
"The brewery was shooting for a Vienna Amber, similar to Dos Equis (hence the play on the name). While I'm in general a fan of this newer brewery, this particular beer falls short. Pours surprising dark, more like a schwarzbier. Flavor profile is a bit grainy, and the bottle notes the use of flaked corn, which is perhaps influencing my perception, but I seem to get a bit too much corn adjunct in the flavor. Dos Equis is certainly not the best of its style, but I have to say I'd choose it over Yazoo's try. In the brewery's defense, they haven't been bottling all that long, and I haven't tried this on tap yet."
"D = pretty high. this is not my favorite type of beer, but it's still something I'd drink every now and again."
"a solid beer all-around...i like the subtle spiciness and smooth dextrin body. it is unoffensive with a good mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: A refreshing and slightly different flavor profile; ""dark beer light"""
"Yazoo has just installed a bottling line in the last month. The Dos Perros has a deep chestnut brown color with a disappointingly vanishing head. Rich sweet Malt dominates the nose and the flavor with nuances of hop bitterness for balance. Finish is very smooth. This is not my favorite style but I could drink alot of this. Very nicely done brown ale."
"Had this on tap in Nashville. Pours a standard brown color with a medium head and leaves a little lacing on the glass. Malty aroma, but low on the nut-like aroma. Some spices in there. The flavor is a little weak for a brown, but still good. Well balanced with the hops and malts. Easy to drink, but it could use a little something extra."
"Stopped in Nashville one evening and ordered a Bohanan Vanilla Cream--a local brew. Bartender said the brewery was taking a break but to try a Yazoo as a local option. Nothing other than the appearance reminded me of a classic brown Ale--good balance of hops and malts, no nuttiness of hints of caramel or chocolate. Almost like a heavier Newcastle. Okay choice."
