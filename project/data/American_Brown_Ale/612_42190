The taste offered more of the same, plus an almost salty flavor that at first seemed out of place. The salt-like flavor mellowed and there was just a tasty and well malted brown ale. This one hits right where I like brown ales: smooth, creamy, almost a bit chewy, with a dry finish. Really solid beer.","Daktah","May 15, 2014"

4.03,1.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"22oz. bottle courtesy of 2BDChicago and the never-ending SS BIF box. Served in my SA Perfect Pint. Recipe No. 128 indicated on the label. Pours 90% head to start - off-white/tan, dense and frothy. As the head recedes, a chestnut hued body is revealed with ruby red highlights evident when backlit. Thick, textured swaths of lacing are exposed as the head slowly recedes. Nose is malty with a slight nuttiness and a suggestion of artificial sweetener and lactose. Taste is fantastic - malty, molasses and a pleasant roasted character - extremely flavorful without being overly thick or cloying; however, there is a residual lactose/artificial sweetener character that lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation and silky/creamy texture. Overall, I have to say that this is one of the best American Brown Ales I've had the opportunity to try, falling somewhere between a brown and a Porter in my opinion. A top notch beer that demonstrates that a high abv is not necessary to impart flavor.","Jwale73","Beers"

3.69,-7.1,3,4,4,2.5,3.5,"22 ounce bottle for $6.49. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a huge tan head. Pretty much as soon as I poured the beer into the glass, it started bubbling up like crazy, and it took a while for the head to settle down enough for me to pour a somewhat full glass. Aroma is nice and malty, it smells like molasses, chocolate, brown sugar and some coffee. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of a nutty flavor. Also, I think the roasty coffee flavor comes out stronger in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick but has way too much carbonation. I'm not sure if this is a bad bottle or not, but at least the taste wasn't affected. Other than the high carbonation, I think it's a good brew. I'd try this again in the future.","bluejacket74","Sep 09, 2011"

3.98,0.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This is a dark, dark brown beer with a large, compact, very dense head, over an inch thick (poured into an English pint glass). The nose provides a nice rich caramel aroma, with a dash of roastiness and a touch of hops. The flavor offers plenty of black patent cocoa flavor, moderately roasted, with dark chocolate notes.

Slick burnt sienna roars into the glass, a finger of ecru foam recalling the steam at trainstops of yore. The air abounds with light maple syrup, cedar, brown sugar, and a soft breeze of roasted malts. Maybe it's this air, maybe it's the beer running into my mouth (it's hard to tell sometimes), but I can distinctly taste brown sugar, roasted malts, light maple syrup, light molasses, and a brief fling with oak. Okay, I figured it out: It was the beer, which went down nicely thanks to a medium body and a light moderate carbonation. While I watched the Fighting Sioux get taken down by the Gophers on ice, I didn't want to put this one down. Things are boding well for this day at the brewpub.","TMoney2591","Dec 11, 2010"

Minimal lacing, but the retention on this was phenomenal, kept a solid half finger of head on this throughout. Just gorgeous. Aroma is nice too, bouquet of milk chocolate, caramel, molasses, sweet and rich malts. Taste starts with the rich warm malt base striking the tongue initially, then coating the tongue with a fairly simple and delicious combination of molasses, caramel, toffee and a touch of coffee. Mouthfeel is full, low carbonation and a smooth, creamy finish. Bit of bitterness at the end of each sip, but the IBU's on this are only low 30's from what I can recall from the bottle.

It leaves a little lacing, and remains as a nice ring throughout. A little darker than expected, but overall, about average looking. The smell is of sweet chocolate, with a hint of cola. There is also a smell of earthy, slightly herbal hops. There are notes of roasted malts as well - coffee, etc. The molasses isn't present in the nose much. The smell overall is very rich and interesting - with all of the usual suspects present. The taste is really nice. Upfront, there is quite a taste of bittersweet chocolate. There's a nice sweet and bready malt presence paired with a beautiful earthy hop presence. Also, a a floral hint in the finish. There's a slight taste of tobacco, and a nice lingering taste of molasses in the finish. The flavor of coffee and cola comes and goes in different stages. Everything is in there, in quite a nice balance, and is really enjoyable and rich. This is a very nice brown ale. Full-bodied and sweet - I'm not big on dryness is darker beers. The carbonation was pleasant - about low-medium which provides a prickle with no sting. I really enjoyed the drink - but maybe 1-2 would be enough for me.

The roast character did dominate the taste too, but there was a definite cideryness, that would be most likely caused by the molasses. The cidery character was not unpleasant, but perhaps a tiny bit unusual. Finished roasty, it seemed definitely black-patent for the malt.

So when my brother in law pulled this beauty from his fridge to present to me as a gift, I said let's split it three ways and wow, what a magical experience that was. We sipped, smelled, let sit, then smelled, sipped and did that over and over again. The taste of dark, unsweetened coffee, like espresso, hit our palates, a silky smoothie, pure decadence are just some words to describe the one-hour of beer bliss.

3.8,-4.3,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Poured from a silk screened bomber I got at Flossmoor Station a few weeks ago. Pours an opaque deep brown with cola colored edges. The dark tan head slowly dissipates into a mocha tinged ring around the glass leaving little to no lacing. A deep inhalation brings coffe, a little chocolate and the molasses to the front. A taste and you know why the smell of molasses stands out. The taste does as well but not in a bad way. The bitter chocolate compliments the sweet molasses to make for a complex yet enjoyable palate. The mouthfeel is what gets me. I'm not a fan of the bitter aftertaste. It's not overwhelming but it's there. Know what I mean??? Pretty drinkable. Share with a friend.","tiger88","Apr 30, 2008"

3.83,-3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Very dark brown with almost no head. Scent of molasses with brown sugar, coffee, and a bit of almond. Initial taste of almonds with a hint of cocoa and molasses, brown sugar and roasted coffee beans round this one out. Mouthfeel is clean, a little thick with a soft bite, very nice. Very drinkable, goes down nice and easy.","paco1029384756","Jan 07, 2008"

It's nicely balanced and really drinkable Flossmoor really has something here. Great brew and I can't wait to visit the brewpub!","younger35","Nov 01, 2007"

4.68,17.9,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Freshly tapped at my house, poured into a standard pint glass. The brew fills the glass a very dark brown color with a finger of head that settles to a small head over top with a mild carbonation in there. This brew is nice and dark, but light comes through at the top around the lip. The aroma is roast with a solid brown sugar, toasted nut and chocolate. The smells are moderate in force, but well blended and nice for the style. The flavor hits first with a solid roast that moves to a nice nutty quality, quickly transitioning to milk chocolate and finishing with a moderate pine hop that gives a light impression of coffee and a mild to moderate bite on the finish. This one hits all the notes I want in a brown. It has a robust flavor with a mild nose and awesome drinkability. Mouthfeel is moderate with a nice mild carbonation of fine bubbles. It has a nice velvety smoothness that really works well. Drinkability on this one is outstanding. Though the flavors are big, it is easily a session beer and will not be on my kegerator very long. I really like the lingering hop flavor on the finish. This one is damn good!","kmpitz2","0"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Very dry and again full of dark bready flavors, over cooked caramel, somewhat burnt, brown sugar, cane sugar bordering on mollasses, dark fruits, chestnuts, dried berries and a freak show of other happenings. Nicely complex with a nice bittering hop adding depth and balance.","mcallister","Mar 19, 2006"
4.55,14.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Murky dark chocolate brown with a thin burnt-orange head and very respectable lacing. Natural hazelnut and roasted almond scents mingle with heady cocoa and soft floral hop aromas -- very enticing. Deep chocolate flavors spiked with roasted hazelnuts and a lovely soft yet bitter dark coffee taste. Floral and ever-so-slightly spicy hop notes appear here and there. More cocoa flavors as it warms, with an almost cinnamon-like character peeking through, very reminiscent of nut-infused, lightly sweetened Mexican hot chocolate. It's rather close to a Dark Mild Ale in my estimation, but its nutty character definitely marks it as a Brown. Medium-light body with a soft chewiness to the mouthfeel. Super drinkable. If ever in the Chicago "Southland" area, it is certainly worth your while to seek out Flossmoor Station to pick up a growler of this stuff. It's always on tap, and it's a ridiculously drinkable session brown. In fact, I'd say it defines the last four words of that sentence.","orfeu","Jul 25, 2005"

3.53,-11.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D- I feel like this beer is more of an American Brown Ale or a Porter. It has nice big hops that would make me think that it is a ABA but the awards on the wall are for best Porter. It is a nice beer but I'm not sure why it had an alcohol warmth to it. Maybe it was served to young and needed time to age?","rhoadsrage","Dec 02, 2003"
3.85,-3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This was dark enough brown to pass for a porter in my book. Nice nuttiness, but also has a little chocolate and roast that really makes the whole thing qualify as a good porter instead of a great brown ale, but who cares. It was tasty and as long as it's tasty, I don't care if it's pushing stylistic guidelines. I don't review by style guidelines anyway.","aracauna","Jul 27, 2003"
4.3,8.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Well, after sampling everythig Flossmoor currently had on tap, this is the beer that went home in a growler with me and a friend. Good English-style hop bitterness and complex shades of coffee, nutmeg, maybe even hazelnuts and prunes... it's just a different taste with each sip. The glass I'm having out of the growler right now has a burnt coffee taste to it. Chocolate malts apparent, a roasty malt smell on top of a hop aroma and a warming alcohol presence, this one is a winner.","DrunkMcDermott","Dec 29, 2002"
3.94,-0.8,5,3.5,4,4,4,"This brew pours a medium head of light brown colored fine to medium sized bubbles that were mostly lasting and left a fair lacing. The body was an opaque brown color. It had a coffee malt aroma and a nutty mild coffee flavor. Another one of my favorite brews from the fine folks at Flossmoor Station!","TheDM","Nov 20, 2002"
4.2,5.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Dark brown in color with a tan head that disapates rather quickly. Light to medium carbonation. Very malty aroma with hints of mollasses. Pleasant hop taste to balance the malts. Very smooth & drinkable.","cretemixer","Oct 31, 2002"
3.55,-10.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"The beer pours a dark garnet to almost brown color with a light chocolate semi-creamy head that is modest in size, the residual lace a fine sheet to coat the glass. Roasted grains and light hop aromas dominate the nose. Start is slightly sweet, top is middling in mouth feel, the finish pleasantly hopped, pleasingly acidic, malt dry long lasting aftertaste. My bottle says that it was bottled and brewed by "Riverside Brewery" at least this is a drinkable beer, the previous Riverside beers IÂ’ve sampled were totally without merit, and donÂ’t really need mentioning.","Gusler","Jun 05, 2002"
