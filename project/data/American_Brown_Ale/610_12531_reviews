"Crystal maple, toffee head. Roasted, slightly doughy, effervescent. hoppy brown for sure, but nice."

"A nice example of the style overall, not just specific to American Browns. I would argue that despite being a west coast brew it really borders on the English style if you swapped out the nuttiness for sweet sugar, but no real hop presence I could detect."

"Overall: a good combination of rough coffee and smooth chocolate, with some sharp molasses and brown sugar. The only thing holding this brew back for me by far is the price of AU$13 a bottle. A bit steep..."

"The flavor is rich and interesting. It mixes the tastes of caramel, coffee, and nuts in a very smooth drink with a wonderful aftertaste. The alcohol content is also pleasantly high."
"Can't recommend this one at all."
"Overall: Very solid brown ale. Very tasty, nicely balanced and very easy to drink. I’d be very happy to have this beer again."

"Poured this brew from a 22oz bomber. Its a dark ale with a quickly dissipating tan head. In the light this shit is a beautiful dark red. Really amazing color. Excited carbonation. Pretty nice aroma too quite sweet and malty, molasses. The hops are definitely coming through as well. It's a very nice drinkable beer. Chocolate, roasted malt, and some alcohol but it's hard to really describe the flavor because it's kinda nondescript but pleasant. When this first hit my palate it came across as quite bitter but I adjusted to it after two or three sips and it becomes quite drinkable. I'm a hop head, this isn't a hoppy beer but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. It's a great brown Ale!"
"T - The taste is not like the smell. In a good way though. The taste is unsweetened chocolate and burnt molasses. The hops presence is not overwhelming. It is full bodied and creamy."

"overall, I like this. while I was into the Belgians for a while, I really think my favorite style is a nut brown, or just brown (as classified), ale. this is really standard for a brown ale, but is still darned good. which makes it so good. little bit o' brown sugar, some nuts, maybe? but just a really tasty drinking brew."
"Overall- Very nice, some of the malts and brownsugar/molasess could be more pronounced from one another, also not sure how fresh this is. Not sure I'd get it again but I am glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent beer that poured to a very dark brown with little head. Smell was a mild malt with a not a lot of hops showing. Once again it was the malt that generated the flavor -- hops were not a major player. Mouthfeel was ok thru the finish. Overall a good beer that I would not buy again."

"Overall: this one seems under flavored and watery but I guess it's fine for the style. Low ABV but still barely tastes like alcohol is even in this one. Drinkable and better than most in the genre."
"D - Nicely done, this isn't an India brown ale by any means, but it is a bit hoppier and better balanced than most sweeter brown ales. Nothing over the top going on here, but it is flavorful and quite drinkable."
"O: It's put together well, and no real flaws...but nothing exciting either."
""

"On cask at Rattle N Hum. Pours a dark brown color with over an inch of frothy head. The aroma is malty and boozey with some brown sugar and caramel. Tastes malty with a nice alcohol presence which is surprising since the ABV isn't all that high. Some sweet brown sugar. Creamy mouthfeel. Works well on cask. Overall, nothing special but a good Brown Ale."

"I've already firmly established that Bear Republic handle hops well, but how will they fair on a maltier style? Very well, actually. Tribute Ale pours brown. Yeah, a brown pour for this brown ale. The aroma is rather straight-forward, offering a slightly nutty robust maltiness. The taste follows, but with some hops not as susceptible on the nose offer a deep earthy, resiny character that compliments the malts very well. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and gently carbonated, and the drinkability is great. Overall, Bear Republic do a great, fairly traditional brown ale."

"If there was ever a beer brewed to my passing away, if it a quarter of the worth of this amazing ale I will rest easy."

"Poured from a 650ml bomber bottle. Poured a light brown with red tints. Lots of enticing chocolate, caramel, toffee and vanilla notes on the nose. The mouthfeel is nice and round and balanced. The palate offers flavours of strong dark fruit, coffee, toasted marshmallow with a good bitter backing."
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a really good brown ale; really glad I got to try it. Some nice nuts in the smell and chocolate in the taste, with caramel throughout, and easy to drink. Would definitely order it again."

"overall one of the better browns I've had. recommended."
""
"O: a very solid brown ale. it has great flavor and nice complexity. Pretty happy I picked this one up and it was priced very well for a bomber."
""
""
"Atmosphere is really good. Appearance characterized by dark body, nice carbonation, and a frothy top. Lots of sticky lacing. Nose is simple but well done. Flavor is pungent and woody, with a medium hop, and some sweet and bitter components. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- An okay Brown ale. Is missing some of the complexity of the world class brown ales but still a good drinker."
"O: Very flavorful and easy to drink brown ale. Malty, sweet, and pretty straightforward. Would drink again."
""
""
"Overall this was a pretty successful tribute ale. Nothing too revolutionary and a bit too hoppy for my tastes as a brown ale as I lean more toward the English style, but I would revisit again considering the decent price point."
""
""
""
"O: Overall a polished brown with a big flavor that was silky smooth and easy to down. Flavor flowed nicely together, enjoyable drinkability and worthy a try."
"Pours nice dark brown color. Good quality head and decent lacing when poured in a glass. Smell has brown sugar and caramel with a hint of alcohol. Taste is great with strong malt and nutty notes coming through. Overall a quality beer that would probably be even better in season - fall to winter."
"O: An easy drinking beer, as is typical for style, but richer and slightly darker in flavor than average. Easily recommended, although perhaps a little closer to an average brown ale than I expected from this outstanding brewer. Do not serve very cold."
"Pours a depp copper tinted brown, lets some light through, big soapy light khaki head, decent retention. Scent brings fresh roasted and toasted nuts, hints of caramel and dark crusty bread, firm hop presence with some earthyness. Taste follows suit, nutty and bready with hop bite. Medium bodied, smooth and lightly creamy. Enjoyable all around."

""

"o - a fantastic brown ale, i could drink quite a few of these. given the price ($4.50/bomber), this should be on everyones must try list."
""
"O - Was not expecting the hop flavor... pass"
""
""
"O: Decent, drinkable beer, but not something I'd recommend or regularly purchase. If you get it, try to find it on tap."
""
"D/O: A really great american brown."
""
""
"This a tasty beer. It has good flavor, it's drinkable, it's balanced, it's a great concept beer. If for no other reason than to offer tribute, I will inevitably be getting another bomber."
"Unfortunately the taste is part american brown, part oxidised/sweet tasting dark malts. Also quite watery and a leaves a bit of a coca cola twang on in the mouth. Drinkable."
""
""
"Not quite what I'm looking for from an American Brown Ale, but definitely drinkable. By the end of the bomber I think it'll have grown on me a bit."
""
"Average US Brown Ale which dips its lid to the English. Plenty of nut which works, the booze or alcohol heat doesn't help, but still a decent brown ale that is PB the sweeter side."
""
""
""
"Body feels slightly watery, could use more carbonation."
""
"Pours a deep reddish brown with one finger of splotchy light brown head. Taste is lightly earthy malt, some brown sugar, and some subtle hops. Also a bit of molasses and coffee. Medium, creamy mouthfeel with a dry earthy finish. Overall a good brown ale, but nothing that really sticks out for me. A bit to earthy."
""
""
"I love my American Brown ales so hopefully this lives up to it and it pours a dark cherry hue with a two finger head and sporadic clingy lacing,the smell is molasses,brown sugar,golden syrup and dark cherries,the mouthfeel is just medium bodied and the tastes are pretty similar to the smell with hints of golden syrup,brown sugar,dark fruits,molasses,treacle,caramelized figs and the finish is mostly sweet with a touch of bitterness to make it real and overall very drinkable but not the best American brown around cheers."
""
"Overall after so many hoppy beers tonight I finally got a solid malt forward beer with great nutty flavors, chocolates, and a slight hop finish. Good stuff!"
""
""
"Overall: Simply put, one hell of a brown ale. A worthy tribute ale, and I wish my fridge was full of this all year round."
""
""
"O- Alright. Well executed but nothing crazy good."
""
"Taste-Toasted malt, brown sugar, toffee, coffee with cream. Very well-balanced. Creamy, roasty, semi-dry finish. Many subtle flavors add up to great character. Softly sweet but not overly so. An excellent Brown. Highly recommended."
""
"Wow, really good brown ale. Served a bit too cold for my personal taste, with a medium sized light tan head that soon settled to a light cover and loads of lace. Color is a clear, deep mahoganey. Aroma is malt, toffee, cocoa, slight roast and mocha. Flavor is very similar to taste with a little carbonic tang and extremely well balanced, very true to style. Body & carbonation are faultless. Finish is short to average in length. Deceivingly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like the balance of sweet and the rest of the flavors of the beer. It works well for savoring. I enjoyed this beer. I really appreciate the effort put into making it."
""
"22 ounce bottle, no bottle date. Pours slightly cloudy reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with excellent retention that reduces to a nice cap. Fair amount of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of caramel, toasted malt, cola, spicy hops, nuttiness, and light chocolate. Decent aromas here with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toasted malt, nuttiness, molasses, cola, and spicy hops. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, nuttiness, light chocolate, and spice. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming after the finish. Nice flavor balance. Overall this is an excellent and robust brown ale with a great flavor profile."

"More malt and less hops would have made this even better. Like many fine coffees, the taste cannot beat the smell, but it still tastes damn good."

"Cheers..."
"O: I liked this, but couldn't have it all the time. I think Bear Republic really knew what they were doing here, however, I think I prefer a straight ahead brown ale. Different strokes I guess...."
"Overall: One of the best brown ales I've tried. Cooks well with red beans and rice and tastes great on the side.I'll definitely be trying more of this one. Just right for fall."
"O: Very well done brown ale, but not my favorite. Decent flavors, but kind of light."
" Definitely worth a try and comes highly recommended."
"dark brown in color with a wonderful tan head on top. Very nice robust look to it, almost a cedar hue to it. The aroma was a big suprise. Rich cocoa and hints of roasted malts. Touches of caramel as well as a light tobacco touch to it. Really huge brown ale here. Smooth, mellow carbonation, rich, creamy profile with each sip having to be savored time, and time again. Lots of rich caramel malts wash across the tongue with the very first sip, and so it begins as the smooth, mellow cocoa notes start to come together and mixed with a light, earthy bitter hoppines"
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style but darker than most, this is a solid beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 1 inch puffy tan head that fades to a small cap. Tight patterns of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, molasses, and chocolate bars. Taste is of roasted malt, brow sugar/molasses, and a bitter hop finish. There is also a slight nutty flavor I am getting. The bitterness sits on the tongue after each sip. There is a pretty good level of carbonation with a somewhat crisp and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good brown ale but nothing too special on this one."
"O - Good brown ale, not over the top but definitely crafty brew. Might need a little more alcohol kick or bitter hops to bring it to an imperial/double status but a great drinker for a brown ale fan. Personally I would like it a little more sweeter on the brown sugar side of things."
"Overall – The beer has a fantastic balance, and although it is sweet is highly drinkable. It's definitely one of the better brown ale's that I've ever had and I'd buy it again for sure. Worth seeking out."
"O- Solid,decent and good."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and goes down easily; I could definitely drink a few of these in one sitting and would consider it to be sessionable."
"The flavor mirrors the smell--lots of cocoa. There is a light hop presence in the swallow. The aftertaste is short but resembles a semi-sweet chocolate. The body is rich and the carbonation is low. This is a good chocolatey Brown Ale."
"Mildly sweet, but quickly turns dry behind the roasty malts and piney hops. Body is a bit too thin; slightly high on the carbonation front. Good drinkability, and an excellent value at $5/bomber."
"A straight forward simple American Brown. Good flavour and nicely balanced."
"Overall Drinkability - More expensive than iced coffee."
"Prost!!!"
"O- This is an excellent brown ale. One of the better ones I've had recently"
"Overall this is a Great beer. A perfect representation of the style. Only the second Bear Republic beer I've ever had, I think, and both have been very good. This is a must find and I look forward to trying more of their stuff."
"O. Bear Republic have come up with a very nice brown ale here. Seriously well balanced with more flavour than you can shake a stick at."
"Final thought - at $3.50 a pop, upside of 6% ABV, its like McDonalds, I'm loving it"
"Pete Brown and friend you have done it. Now i just have to go out and find where I can buy a 22."
"Rest In Peace, Pete."
"Pours a rich cola brown with red highlights and a thick and creamy mocha coloured head. Quite frothy on the pour and disapates to a thin creamy cap. There is a great roasted malt scent combined with nut and boozy mollasses. Light mouthfeel up front with a roasted malt taste that is not too sweet. Then a slight sourness followed by warm alcohal and molasses flavours. This fades to a nice roasted semi dry finish that lingers. Maybe too rich for more than a couple bombers but at over 6% thats about right. Delicious. If this is your tribute Pete, its aa good one."
"I wish I could find this beer again. I will be finishing the bomber by myself with no problems."
"Flavor is heavy on the roasted malts, with the hops peeking through briefly late with a citrus and pine finish. To me this is a dry malt backbone rather than sweet, or the hops could be balancing more than I thought. Texture is a bit thin. Although the balance is nice, I feel it maybe simplifies things a bit. This is drinkable and enjoyable, but not really memorable."
"A delicious brown ale dominated by roasted malt character, bready flavor characteristics and plenty of hop bitterness. A lovely beverage."
"This is interesting. It's a decent brown ale, and I bet it's great on tap, but the kiwi fruit tang has me worried and throws this brew off-kilter. Despite the similarity in nose, I would choose Bell's Best Brown over this."
"Overall, it's drinkable, but it's missing something—maybe it's depth, or maybe it's fullness of palate. Overall, it's good, but I was hoping for great."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but nothing special."
"Solid. Nice to see a delicious brown ale."
"Very good beer, not sure when it comes out, think its seasonal as I only see it every now and then. Get it."
"Verdict: pretty decent beer, not something I'd drink all the time, but well done and good value."
"Pours a black with an off white head. The head is frothy and lasting. Laces well on the glass. The aromas are faint but I get brown sugar and a touch of molasses. Has a good carbonation. The mouthfeel is excellent. Flavor is nice with a good mix of sweet malts and lightly hopped. Has a watery texture and a medium body. A good hearty finish with a good aftertaste. This is a smooth drinking beer. Very good and full of flavor."
"D - This has got to be one of the best Brown Ales Ive had in a long time. It's very drinkable and I really like the fact that it's not over carbonated. This is a beer I could kick back and have a few of for sure. I definitely recommend this one, go check it out. Cheers!"
"Wow, what a session-able brown ale. All the flavors i expect are there but not so much to make me sick of it. The perfect hybrid of a drinkable pub beer and a sipper/night cap at home beer."
"As a person who doesn't normally like brown ales, or hoppy beers, I can say that this is definitely a good beer, despite my biases."
"Im glad I bought this beer and I doubt they will but I hope they keep making it!"
"Color is a very pretty brown, quite fizzy head that dissapates quickly. Aroma is bready/malty with a nice hoppy back end. Flavor is ok, not great...again, not a huge brown ale fan. Drinkability is also a little questionable as I felt the alcohol very quickly and almost couldn't finish the beer."
"D- A good sweet brown by Bear Republic give it a try!"
"Pours dark brown with a tall tan head. The smell is wet tree bark, molasses, sweet curry spice. The taste starts off with a vinuous tang, moving into coppery elements, some meaty notes, a little citrus twinge, and finally a clenching, tannic finish. It's quite thick though not syrupy, moderately carbonated, and fills and coats the mouth quite well. Easy to drink -- not a sipper, but given this ABV, not a gulper either. Closer to a Yorkshire brown than most other American browns I've had -- very nice."
"D - Highly drinkable; makes me wish I had more then one. This is a brown that's made to last, and one that you won't get tired of drinking halfway through."
"Two finger light brown head, medium-slow dissipation with good lacing. Clear dark brown body, lots of visible carbonation rising to top of glass. Nose is pretty complex, nutty, some roast with chocolate up front and grassy hops on the back end. Taste is fairly chocolaty with other malt aspects pushed into background, though the brown sugar and molasses notes became more prominent as the beer warmed. Medium-full mouthfeel, noticeable but not aggressive effervescence. Drinkability is good, nice autumn quaffer, ABV not noticeable, one of the better ABAs I've had."
"D-A very serviceable American brown ale, but not excellence achieved by many of Bear Republic's other beers."
"A dark tan head dense with fine bubbles tops out huge over the dark reddish-brown brew. The bubbles pop slowly to and fro, making for a nice little wait before the froth fades, leaving a nice sheet of lace behind. smells sublimely sweet and slightly nutty. Tastes of sweet malts mixed with bitter dark chocolates. The big carbonation gives it an airy but somewhat creamy mouth-feel which makes for some very smooth drinking. Great balance and great taste make for a great brown here."
"(probably not for a couple of months)"
"One of the best American Brown Ales I've had. Bear Republic delivers again with one of their lesser known beers."
"Fairly drinkable, and certainly a better example of the style than other ones that I've had."
"Good drinkability, especially for fans of malty beers. A solid brown ale that's worth trying, and I'm not huge in the brown ale world yet. I find most brown ales on the boring side, but this one was one of the better browns that I've had and well above average."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a solid American brown, a style that is way under-represented, especially on the West coast. Cheers to Pete!"
"D: One of the best malty brown ales around. Avoids the sourness of some and brings dense flavor of the sweet and delicious kind."
"The full flavor is reflected in the mouthfeel, it's full-bodied but seriously extremely smooth to drink. Creamy, sweet savory and just extreme mellow qualities in this beer have combined for a great brown ale. If you're the ""new castle is too sweet for me"" type then give this one a shot, you won't regret it."
"D-One of the better browns that I have tried lately, but in fairness not a style that I buy much. Kudos to Bear for not killing this with hops, but I haven't met a Bear Republic beer that wasn't top notch. Buy again? Sure..."
"Pete Brown Tribute Ale was a good, not a great beer (not that there are that many great brown ales). It was quite drinkable and I liked it, but it was not memorable."
"Far from the malty brew I was expecting but well crafted in its own right. Good balance and drinkability."
"I do believe that I could put away a few of these, but this is indeed darker on the brown spectrum. The carbonation is just right, it seems, and serves the style."
"Drinkability: Very complex and tasty. I'd love to try this beer again!"
"Bear Republic Tribute Ale is a very clear, very lively, deep crimson brown berr with a huge, lumpy, beige head. Wowza! It has a green, hoppy aroma like grass. It has a smooth, medium body with a slightly gritty finish. It's pretty bitter and green tasting. It tastes like a home brew. There is a slight note of chocolate but no sweetness is detected. This is almost like an India Brown Ale."
"Two fingers of camel tan colored loose foam which possesses enough larger bubbles to speed up the dissolve, slight dimpling, a decent amount of stickiness creates more lacing than usually found in the category. Reddish brown color, opaque with more clarity at the rims as well as an orange cast. The nose much more demure than expected, caramel, milk chocolate, black raisins and cherries, brazil nuts, indistinct roast to it, same could be said for the mixed citrus nuances, little here bespeaks a strong hops presence. Medium-bodied, the carbonation churns and fluffs things up. Malt, carob, milk chocolate powder, caramel and molasses all there but, truthfully, it's not overly sweet. Lower levels of raisin, black grape, cherry, apricot fruit and the orange to lemon citrus drops off a notch as well. Maybe it's an after effect of the carbonation but you get a suggestion of mineral water. The nuttiness holds off but shows nicely through the finish. Not bad at all but no aces hidden up its sleeves."
"D: Very nice to drink. Very palatable. This one gets an overall ""noms"" from me."
"Notes: A fitting Tribute to Pete Brown."
"D-Enjoyable and goes nice with smoky flavors. I enjoyed it, and would consider having it again, but I'm not sure I'd count it among my favorites."
"Brew pours to a nice brown color with some ruby like highlights. The head is big, light tan with pretty good retention and what is there has left great amount of lacing down the side of the whole glass. The aroma is of roasted malts, caramel, maybe molasses and chocolate. Nutty aroma comes through as well. Hop presence is minimal, at least compared to the malt profile. Big and malty! Lots of caramel and chocolate come through, roasted malt flavor is negligible. Hops come out more here at the tail end, plays well with the carbonation as it gives a slight tingle to the tongue and adds a slight bite. Has a nice feel as it washes across the mouth, creamy like feel. Overall this is a very easy drinking brew and what I think is a great brown ale - one of my favorite styles. Ill look for this one again, not sure why it took so long for me to pick it up."
"A really enjoyable and good brown ale. Nothing special, just nicely done."
"D: It's quite nice, but halfway through the pint, it got a bit boring. It's solid, quite flavorful, but I wasn't clamoring for a second."
"D-its got a nice sweet malt taste, some aspects of balance that are pretty well done, straight forward and to the point. Mouthfeel was too thin for me and it seemed to have a little too much carbonation"
"Overall, this is a more than adequate brown ale but definitely not the star of the category."
"Split a 1 pt 6 oz bottle with my wife (who didn't like it and ended up giving me her half....the beer was ""too full""). It pours dark with just a tint of red coloring. Nice little head with lacing that lasts throughout. Looks good. There's a lot there in the smell, but nothing that really stands out. It's got the earthy smell of a Brown and I'm catching a hint of something sweet. Maybe that's the brown sugar talked about on the bottle. This has a smoky front end on the taste. It's almost like a porter. There's a nice sweet aftertaste that lingers. This beer doesn't have much punch when it hits your mouth, which was a disappointment. The drinkability on this is pretty high, all things considered. I've found this style to be pretty drinkable in the past and then have it sneak up on me. Be careful with this one!"
"high drinkability not real high ABV its smooth and pretty drinkable."
"Poured dark brown with a very small light brown head. Nice thin sheets of lace are offered, the foam is frothy and creamy. Light brown sugar and roasted malt in the nose along with a milky, creamy sweet character. Light molasses, brown sugary crusted sweet bread, milky chocolate, mild vanilla notes and cocoa nibs in the finish. Nice bubbly and wet mouthfeel even thought the finish is somewhat dry. Nothing amazing, just a good brown ale. Definitely worth a try."
"I would recommend this beer to those looking to try something different, and to my buddies that are brown fans, I would highly recommend they at least try it."
"excellent autumn brown. looks just like a coca cola in pour with a tighter head. very little lace. nose is toasty. lot of molasses and a gentle smoke and yeasty bread. palate of toffee and mollasses, smokey mild sour... chestnut and clove quality. pumpkin pie malt and mild bitter finish. pumpernickel... a tad leathery. great for thanksgiving season."
"fantastic brown ale with chocolate and roast on top of a solid malt backbone. restrained hops provide a soft bitterness without much flavor or aroma. Alcahol on the mid 6's makes for a firm beer but still very drinkable. loved this with grilled steak. Reminded me of a bigger moose drool."
"Highly, deliciously, drinkable. Nicely balanced while showcasing maltiness (that doesn't become too sweet or overroasted). A great rendition of an American brown. Another winner from this great brewery!"
"-high on alcohol for a brown, but it is a very good beer"
"Pours a solid mahogany with a thick, creamy, off-white froth...nice lacing. On the nose are aromas of caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, toffee, subtle raisins, roasted nuts, a touch of smoke, and roasted malts. Tastes a little sweet with great carbonation and all of the characteristics from the nose. Overall, a solid beer that very smooth and easy to drink."
"Not a huge fan of Bear Republic, and this is probably their weakest beer in their lineup. Definetly not a bad beer, but lacking compared to their other efforts. Worth a shot, especially if you are a Brown Ale fan, just don't expect the best of the best."
"This beer poured a very dark clear burgundy color and formed a huge light tan foamy head that left latticed lace as it slowly subsided. An aroma of malt, chocolate and coffee. The flavor was of malt, coffee, anise and a hint of chocolate. The body was medium light and the finish was slightly sweet. A very nice brown ale."
"Drinkability: Very easily one the the best porter/stouts that I've tasted. Goes down very smooth."
"NOTES: BDBS"
"D - This beer is one of my favorite Brown Ales, nice flavor profile, and easy to drink, this brewery has done it again"
"Excellent beer worth seeking out."
"Sweet, nutty and chocolate flavors with a well balanced and steady carbonation. A light hop bitterness on the close with a long subtle finish with a hint of peppery spice. The beer does tire a bit as the carbonation lessens, so refresh the pour regularly."
"Approximate 18oz serving size. Poured a deep chestnut brown with ruby hues at the edges when held to the light. Foamy tan head held good retention with a sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Sweet aromas of brown sugar, toffee, and toasted grains, with a hint of chocolate fill the nose. Tastes are of toasted grains, brown sugar, toffee, and notes of nutty milk chocolate and molasses with a slight hint of caramel. Hops are present, but not overbearing allowing the malt profile to keep its presence. Balance seems good. Mouth-feel is rather light with moderate carbonation. Finishes mainly sweet but somewhat bitter; more roasty than anything - there is also an odd nutty character in the finish. Overall, not a bad brown ale, and fits the style well."
"This is what American Brown Ales are supposed to be. Pours dark brown with a frothy beige head. Smells sweet and bready, but not heavy. Tastes as it should. Rich, light but present hop with mellow and taste bud pleasing sweetness. Medium body, great mouthfeel. If you love brown ales, British or American, enjoy this gem."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head that is short lived. A little lacing is left on the glass. Aroma of milk chocolate, molassus, nuts, and herbal hops. A departure from highly hopped American brown ales. Sweet, chocolatey, with just a hint of earthyness in the finish. It is sweet without being cloying. Toasted malt is noted as well. The body is a little thin but combined with nice carbonation gives a nice soft texture. Nice, easy drinking brown. A change of pace from high hopped beers but still does it without being overlysweet."
"Mouthfeel seemed a bit lighter than expected, maybe even somewhat watery but was also very smooth. Not too heavy and no real alcohol presence make this very drinkable. Not sure why but I wasn't expecting too much from this one, maybe because I've always thought of Bear Republic only for their hoppy beers but they continue to impress with this one."
"Bottle, courtesy bulletrain76. Ruby tinged brown color with a watery beige head, no lacing. Cocoa powder aroma with some bread crust and a light orangey hop note. Flavor is dark and bready with pumpernickel, wheat bread crust, and an even roasted note than leads into a moderate bitterness. Semi dry finish and smooth overall. Pretty good brown."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one. Keep 'em comin."
"As for drinkability, I will say there is not that much. Not offensive, but also not inviting. I will not willingly be back to try this one again."
"D - Easy drinking... A very solid and respectable brown ale... More sweetness was expected on the palette and would have been appreciated..."
"Final Thoughts- Substantial and pleasing in all designs and methods, but really doesn't transcend the Brown Ale style. Still one of the best sweet brown ales you can get."
"D: I'm not the biggest fan of browns, but I figured I'd give this one a try, given that it's a Bear Republic. This is a solidly drinkable beer that goes down easy."
"A 22oz. bomber bottle purchased at The Beer Stop for $4.50. Poured into my nonic pint glass and appears a clear deep chestnut brown color with about two fingers of creamy tan lingering foam. Smells and tastes of floral hops, hazelnuts, bittersweet chocolate, mocha, brown sugar, mildly roasted coffee, caramel, a lot going on here, nice. Smooth mouthfeel with ample carbonation. Glad to have easy access to this. Check it out if you can."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, this is a rich-tasting beer that is not too filling."
"English Browns are one of my favorite styles and very difficult to find with any kind of freshness on our side of the pond. But, this is a good one that I will be seeking out again, if possible."
"D - Very drinkable, great stuff here."
"D: Very easy to drink. Excellent for a stronger session beer."
"This poured a very dark brown but when held up to the light it looked more like a very deep red. I expected this beer to be much heavier than it was based on that appearance but found it to be much more medium bodied with nice carbonation. The wife and I both enjoyed this one."
"D: ok, not my favorite brown, but I could drink a few of these if someone else bought them"
"The aroma is incredible on this beer, but unfortunately it is far and away the best thing about this beer. Boost the crystal malt to give it some body and sweetness to round things out. The flavours are great, but I feel like I have to strain myself to taste anything."
"Another solid brew from a great brewery. I have never been disappointed with any of their brews."
"Pours a reddish brown colored body, with a foamy off-white colored head. Has a nuttiness to the smell, and coffee aroma. A very watery palate. Has a nice coffee taste. There is some nuttiness here too. A somewhat creamy mouthfeel."
"Enjoy..."
"Dark, reddened brown color. Small, creamy off-white head leaves some thin sheets on the glass. Rich malty aroma immediately brings to mind the soft smell of a fresh vanilla bean. Sweet chocolate, cookie dough, flowers, and some fruity yeast. Tasty mocha-like flavor with brown sugar and hops. Creamy and nutty. The hops begin to stand out a bit more as it warms. Smooth and medium bodied. Very good brown ale...maybe more of an American/English hybrid."
"Pours a deep, dark brown that glows reddish at the edges under a lamp light, with a big, frumpy tan head with excellent retention. Smells of sweet toffee and dark fruits. Taste is very rich and satisfying: molasses sweetness with a good amount of toasty malts backed by earthy hops. A long, bittersweet toffeish finish. Medium to full-bodied, iminently drinkable. Not the most complex English Brown on the market, but very delicious."
"The nose really got my expectations up but the taste was just OK. Still good."
"good drinkability."
"Opinion: Well, this is a pretty decent beer. I am definitely going to finish my glass, so it doesn't suck by any means. I am not a big fan of the balance. I like sweet beers, Bock is my favorite style, but this beer doesn't really play well on my palate. It has some flavor in the beginning with the fresh hops and sugary sweetness, but then fades to mouthfeel pretty quickly. I don't know what it is, but I won't be seeking this beer out again. If I want an American Brown Ale, I will stick with others."
"M/D - Light bodied and a little thin on the feel. A very good beer though and easily drinkable."
"M/D: Nice mouthfeel. Smooth, full bodied. Decent drinkability. A little lackluster at times, but it's good."
"This beer poured an attractive reddish-brown color with a generous off-white head that dissipated fairly quickly. The aroma was of chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt. The flavor was a combination of all of these with a coffee flavor that also came through. The mouthfeel was good with proper carbonation. Drinkability was high. I liked this and will have again."
"Pete has a big, foamy, lasting head on top of a clear, deep dark russet body. Aroma is full of brown sugar and molasses along with an earthy smell. Flavor is mostly sweet chocolate, but overall very light. Finishes slightly bitter with an aftertaste of sour cherries and iron. Alcohol is noticable, but not overpowering. OK, but not anything I would buy again."
"The drink is medium-bodied and nicely carbonated with superb quaffability. An excellent brown ale from a brewer that is quickly becoming one of my all-time favorites."
"D - Could go for 2 or 3 pints."
"(3.3/5)"
"D-Very solid beer,good smell and taste.I would purchase this again and again!"
"D - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit it would make a good dessert beer worth trying sometime"
"A good drinker. Recommended."
"Clear, dark amber with a medium tan head. Nutty, toasted malt aroma, blended with caramel and cream. More hoppy than expected for a brown ale, lots of caramel, cocoa, with some licorice and brown sugar. Its good, but I wanted more from these guys, especially for a tribute ale."
"Dark leather brown color, hues of orange glow at the bottom of my mug. Smells like a brown: Pie crust, a bit of pine of tropical notes, mild hop aroma, toast. Taste: more pie crust and toast flavors. A pinch of toffee. Solid presence of juicy, fruity hops, with a burnt astringent flavor in the back. A hoppy brown ale I like?....that's usually not for me, but this did the trick."
"D - Easy enough to drink. Reminds me of a Porter."
"o:drinkable despite residual sugar. more like a stout in flavor to me but not out of style. for me the b.r. yeast profile dominates and overwhelms all their beers. i enjoy them less because of it. i cant describe what it is but it is unmistakable. that being said, i still drink alot of their beer so it cant be bad."
"Medium bodied, medium carbonation, and medium drinkability due to the hop/alcohol/roast bite."
"Pretty clear brown pour. Whitish head. Aromas of some roast malt, nut, piney hops. Tastes roast malts with light molasses/tofee. Something a bit metallic maybe, more hops than I would prefer in a brown ale. Lively mouthfeel. Very clean finishing. Overall pretty good, another good brew from Bear Republic."
"I'd like to compare this back to back with Lost Coast's Downtown Brown and see which I like better."
"Bear Republic did a nice job with this English brown. Every sip was better than the last."
"Overall, this is one of the better brown ales I can remember tasting. Definitely give this one a shot if you see it laying around."
"The taste also has caramelly whole wheat, nuts, light sweetness and balancing bitterness. It's very well balanced and smooth, tasty, and drinkable, a solid beer, yet not really exciting or overly interesting."
"This poured an opaque mahogany with a bit of light tan head. It smelled like alcohol and roasted barley with wild wheat and sweet lemon hops. It tasted like burnt barley and sweet molasses malt, with rusty copper hops and a bit of coffee and licorice. It was fairly thick with moderate carbonation, and had a bitter licorice aftertaste. Overall this was almost like an imperial porter. It had a very interesting flavor that was clean and drinkable. It was fairly enjoyable, but it was missing something special to really captivate me."
"D - Good for a mile, but flavor could improve with less hops and earthiness."
"Solid dark brown chestnut hue that revealed hazy yeasty suspended particles under sunlight (this was also the last pour of the bottle). Gentle but persistent small bubble carbonation produced a steady thin, tan head that coated the surface throughout the tasting. Decent lacing and it sure looked promising. The smell was an understated sweet molasses, ginger cookies, a faint hint of cinammon. The first impression on tasting was of a very nicely balanced malt with a hint of mincemeat pie filling, muted tartness but not fruity. The texture was silky and smooth with a lingering bitter finish. There was a nice balance here with flavour that didn't overpower, gently sweet but nicely balanced malt and bitterness. It came across as very drinkable although a little gassy and it really hid the alcohol well. Overall, a really nice example of the style and thoroughly enjoyed. Thanks to biegaman for sharing."
"D - This is a nice brown ale. Easy drinking and tasty"
"Pours a dark mahogany color with a small tan head. Aroma is nutty with molasses and cocoa. Taste features some nice bitersweet cocoa, a touch of molasses, toasted nuts, and some noticeable hops in the background. Nice medium-full, smooth mouthfeel. A very good brown."
"Drinkability: Well balanced between malts and bitterness, reasonably flavorful, sensible ABV... An 'a little bit of everything' kinda brown ale."
"D: Smooth and refreshing, and easy to drink."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a standard pint. Calm, easy pour produces a one-finger creamy brown-white head atop a dark reddish brown body. The aroma yields dark chocolate mainly, with some caramel and earthy, grassy hops. The taste brings out some pf those hop characters in the finish, along with roasted malts. This definitely could use more body, but it is a smooth drinker. Nice offering from Bear Republic. Brown ales are definitely an underrated style."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance seems ok, but overall I find this one indistinct and a bit tasteless. Based on that, can't say I'll seek it out again."
"Pours a ruby brown color with a nice soapy tan head that left a sheet of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a caramel roasted malt, brown sugar and honey, and some light milk chocolate notes. The taste is of a roasted caramel malt, some burnt sugar, milk chocolate, hint of rust, light hop presence. Nice solid brown ale. The feel has a moderate body with tingely carbonation, smooth and a tad chewy, finishes with a roasty bitterness. A very nice example of a brown ale. Not as hoppy as some American versions but has the smooth malty presence that I expect."
"D: Definitely easy to drink, especially for the alcohol percentage. Would be a good session beer."
"Not much into American brown ale much but this is Bear Republic so why not? Poured a decent head with some pacthy lacing. The smell of brown sugar and wet bark was nice. The taste had alot going on some mocha and brown sugar with a dark woodsy funk that balanced out the sweet malt driven beer just a hint of hops also came on at the finish to give this brew some kick."
"Pours brown in color with a nice half inch of head. Smell is fairly hoppy for a brown. No problems with that. Fairly big on the mouthfeel as well. Plenty of the brown malts and sugars to make this good, but then hits you with some more hops. Easy drinking and very tasty. Good beer."
"D- This is one that I wish that I had a lot more of, but sometimes you have to settle for a taste if you need to move on for the night."
"Drinkability is A+ for sure, one of those beers that can just as easily sipped as gulped by the pint, I definitely savored this 22 ounce offering more so than when I drank the growler around a camp fire earlier in the summer. I like the fact that a brown ale from Bear Republic adds some diversity to their lineup, I love all of the Racer brews, Hop Rod, Red Rocket, and XPA but their styles all border each other for me. The Black Bear and this brew hold their own and are unique in their styles."
"Silky and very drinkable brown ale... nice roast chocolate aroma .. some nice flavours too, but in truth, doesn't wow me ... abv is hidden nicely .. drinkable and respectable but nothing that special... 'where are you gonna run' 9:05 - greg packer 'unknown'"
"D: This was a lot better on tap. Fine for the style, but as with so many brown ales, flavor and body are lacking."
"My pour resulted in a finger's worth of thick, mocha-tan head with good retention. The nose was very chocolaty, like cocoa powder. Color was a deep, dark brown with very little light penetration. Mouthfeel was thick and creamy with a definite chocolate taste on the tongue. Finish had a smokiness to accompany the chocoalte. This was a darned good brown and that is high praise from one who usually disdains the style."
"After a small sample, it would have been easy to pass this beer up for something more exotically flavored, but I decided to stick with it for the full pint. I'm glad I did. The beer remained simple and pure, but grew on me more and more after each sip. Delicately balanced between chocolate, barley malt, nutiness, and with a touch of lactose. Soft coffee (Sumatra) lingered in the back notes and gave some complexity, but never commanding attention. The beer is agressively hopped and take on the grassiness and herbal notes of English hops. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, and as easy to drink as chocolate milk. Mild alcohols never become an issue. The look of the beer certainly fits the bill with it's solid dark brown hue, light haze, and froathy head formation, retention."
"Would buy again, but not a super deal at $4.88 a bomber"
"It's initially rather sweet, but the crisp mitigation is timely and well crafted, lending a pleasing balance that works along with a mellow ABV to derive a drinkable nature. Too many tribute beers leave you wondering why the honoree didn't deserve a better beer as an honor. This one makes it clear that Mr. Brown must have been a worthy recipient of the kudos implied."
"Got this as an extra in a trade from someone and sadly I can't remember who since it has been a while. Pours a beautiful brown with a solid head that fades to a ring. Darker than most browns. Smells rich, roasty and creamy. Taste is similar but with a coppery finish as well as some cocoa notes. Quite rich and roasty. Mouthfeel is fairly robust and quite creamy. Delicious and deeply flavored, whgich keeps you interested, but also nicely balanced and easy to drink."
"D- Have to say this is a super easy beer to drink. Listed on the tap as 7% it was a bit bigger than I expected it to be, but the smoothness and the taste allowed me to get this one down really fast. If I didn't have a 30 min drive home I woulda had a 2nd half liter easily."
"A tasty brown ale."
"Appearance- dark brown/ruby with good clarity. Foamy two finger off white head. Smell- sweet crystal malts. Taste- real mix here- first off fizzy metallic mouthfeel which I wasn't expecting that thins out quickly. Some chocolate flavours and hops on the finish. Medium roast coffee and molasses as well. Flavours blend together better after half a glass. Not a bad brown ale."
"D - this isn't as heavy as I thought it would be initially, so I could probably drink the entire pint. I split it with a friend though, so I only got half, but I still enjoyed and would drink another. Another good Bear Republic beer (seems to be something of a trend)"
"Dark brown color with lots of nice ruby highlights on the edges. Smells sweet, there's some coffee notes in there, too. Nice malty taste, some sweet molasses, and some burnt coffee on the back of the tongue. This is damn tasty. Creamy, medium-bodied....this is a solid beer. Bear Republic is just amazing."
"-Oelergud"
"D - good alone or with a hearty meal."
"drinkability is good. solid and interesting malt presence. good balance. quite enjoyable overall."
"A nice, rounded smooth beer."
"It was thin and gave a slight hoppiness that didn't last long in the mouth. Overall a pretty good beer and though I am not a huge fan of brown ales I found this quite an enjoyable brew."
"Poured on tap at the Hop Devil Grill in the East Village of Manhattan. At the moment, they have at least 6 beers on tap from Bear Republic, although this was the only one I tried. I do love a good brown ale and I found this one to be among the best ever. I used to love Sierra Nevada's offering, but, I think this one does it one better due to it's mouth feel and overall balance. I like that it has extra body, something lacking in other brown ales. I could drink this one all night!"
"Definitely recommended..."
"Pretty easy to quaff with the mouthfeel but the diverse profile wants me to slow a bit, it's nice to just enjoy the malty qualities of a good brown ale by sipping and swirling. I can't think of a brown ale I've tried that beats this one. Nice job Bear Republic, Peter Brown would surely have been proud of the work you've done in his honor."
"Drinkability is good. A bit high on abv for a session beer but tastes like a good session beer."
"22 oz bottle poured into 2 pint glasses. Clear mahogany color with 2 fingers of light tan colored head that dissipates slowly leaving some lacing. Aroma is nutty with hints of brown sugar and bread. Taste is somewhat subdued, again nutty and malty, somewhat chewy. A bit lacking in the hops, but I guess that comes with the style (I've really been digging the west coast hop bombs every since my trip to Portland, OR). Medium-heavy mouthfeel somewhat reduces drinkability on this one."
"I think sometimes the nuttiness of the browns are a turnoff and this avoids that. Sure it's plenty of chewy malt in the backbone but it has a sweetness that is welcome."
"Pours an almost opaque deep brown with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is brown malts, cocoa, and subtle caramel. The taste is a mild blend of cocoa, brown malts and some slight nut flavor. The beer is light and smooth with hidden alcohol. While not nearly as impressive as the other brews I've had from Bear Republic, this one is still enjoyable."
"An all around good brew that is up to the caliber of Bear Republic. This is on the heavier side of a brown ale, but still very good and worth getting a bomber."
"Drinkability isnt really there for me. It's to heavy and sweet. There seems to be a bit too much sugar/molassas in the aftertaste, as well as up front."
"Drinks alright, but the dryness does slow me down. I expected a little more from this one from Bear Republic"
"This one may be on the heavy end of a brown ale, but it is definitely a great beer. Light poter, heavy brown ale, whatever, it's a highly drinkable beer that's hard to put down. Recommended."
"A fairly drinkable brew, perhaps a bit strong to be sessionable. It remonds me more of a porter or stout than a brown ale. Not the easy drinking brown some might expect, but it smells and tastes good, and is certainly drinkable enough."
"Dark brown pour, with a lightish tan head that didn't last. Smell is of slight roasty malt, a bit nutty perhaps and a touch of brown sugar. Taste is rather ordinary light roast malt, typical of browns, with a just a hint of brown sugary bitter sweetness too. Still, flavor is on the light and mellow side. Mouthfeel is moderate. Not too thin, but not substantial either Alcohol is barely perceptable if at all. Very drinkable, but not too incredibly unique or interesting. Worth a try if you like browns, I suppose."
"This beer has a nice creamy tan head, it is a little small but it is there. The body is mahogany with some ruby highlights. A good roasted malt smell along with some molasses and a hint of grassy hops. The taste is kind of subdued compared to the smell, there is a bit of chocolate and then some bready malt with hint of grassy hops. It ends surprisingly dry, maybe not that surprising since there is very active carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, the dry finish makes me want to drink more and more I drink it the more I like it."
"D: At this point I'm probably just rating the drinkability of these brown ales lower than they deserved because I'm not very enthusiastic about the style. Regardless, this is one of the better ones I've had recently, very easy to drink and enjoy, just not remarkable (which isn't a bad thing)"
"Very drinkable, not terribly complex, but well balanced. Would be downright sessionable if it dropped a point or two of ABV. Not hoppy enough by far to show off as an example of the American Brown style, but definitely a bit non-traditional as an English Brown (it took gold at GABF in the Brown Porter category)... it's definitely worth a taste, but nothing to get too excited about."
"This was a pretty decent brown ale, but it was definitely bordering on a porter, me thinks. It reminded me of deschutes black butte porter, except a tinsy bit more rich and nutty. The color was dark brown and the head was vanilla and rather full. The taste definitely highlighted some caramel with the nuttiness in the background, and hops were subtle. The aroma was a one dimensional sensations of caramelly malt, but the taste branched out a bit. I didn't notice that the abv was over 6%, and it definitely drank like it was lower. I would easily go back for this if I could get it on tap."
"D: Very drinkable, easily sessionable. A nice straightforward brown, although not a lot of complexity and not all that interesting."
"As I keep drinking it I notch up the taste from 3.5 to 4.0. It's a good transition beer between an IPA and a Belgian."
"D: A nice suprise, as I really don't expect much out of this category, I've had a lot of mediocre ones, but this one is right up there with Alesmith as the best in California."
"I love bear republic for many reasons. Every offering I've had has been solid, hit the marks and shown some imagination. Prices are reasonable. I'm not a huge brown fan but this is one I'd seek out when the mood strikes."
"D - A tasty brown full of flavor, potent but not a beer to take lightly since is is not a session brown, but certainly fits the American brown category well."
"One of the most drinkable american brown ales that I've ever had. Bear Republic can't miss I guess."
"Pours out like a dark maple syrup with a thin head of bubbles of various sizes. Leave some spotty lace. The first thing noted in the nose is the earthy and woody (as in the forest, not the material) hops with a backing of honey and brown sugar. Their estery house yeast character is pretty subdued in this one, but allows for some fruitiness to pair up with the other smells. These esters, however, come out a bit more in the flavor along with some dusty cocoa and a backing of the hops. Malt flavor is a bit thin and the hops do what they can. Mouthfeel is kind of light, chalky, and dusty. Decent brown all around. I wasn't expecting (or hoping for) some hop bomb, but I expected a little more from this brewery."
"I'd call this one a crowd pleaser with its smooth molasses and chocolate flavor. Really, smooth is the word to describe the overall experience here. The beer has a mixture of sweet, dark sugar tastes that melt into the cocoa flavor without being overly sweet from malt or overbalanced by hops. A little heavy for the style, but a great all around beer."
"This is a good beer, and I might be inclined to purchase it again if I were conducting an assorted brown ale tasting. But it's not my favorite brown ale by any means. Still, I think Bear Republic has done a nice job here, and at 6.3% ABV, it's a solid session beer with a little bit of a kick. I think this would go just as well with a bacon burger as it would with a Mexican dish of chicken mole."
"Falls off a little on the flavor. Very straigtforward lacking depth. Sweet malty character milk chocolate in character. Thin mouthfeel with some bittering hop on the finish. Some nutty, dried fruit again. A decent beer but just nothing to set it apart."
"This was a really good brown ale. While they are not my favorite style, I can say that I definitely enjoyed this beer. Another victory for Bear Republic."
"Solid, not thick, mouthfeel, leaves a little astringent character in the back of the throat but otherwise is a genuinely pleasant drinking experience."
"Very decent beer, though in a Bear's lineup of big very flavorful beers, it doesn't especially stand out."
"Overall Impression: Brown isnt one of my favorite styles, but this was easy drinking. If you like Browns, its one not to be missed."
"D: Tailgated with this today and was happy that I brought multiple bottles for the 8 hour party to drink and share with others that put down Bud Lights and tried a bigger beer. This helped get a few converts over from the dark side!"
"D- Smooth and easy-drinking brown ale that falls in the session range, I could easily drink several pints in one setting. This is a surprisingly complex and well-balanced brown ale (one of my favorite styles), and I would definitely order this up again in the future"
"Worth trying once to say you did"
"This looked and smelled fantastic. Medium to dark brown pour with a khaki coloured foamy head that became craggy and ""chunky"" as it slowy died down. Smell was huge cereals and grains and was rather nice. Taste, though, was very forgetable. It wasn't that it was bad. This is *not* a bad beer. It is just that there was a sour taste here that I didn't care for. Not a sour taste that would lead me to believe the beer had gone bad; this tasted like it was supposed to be here. Perhaps it is just me. Nevertheless, I didn't really care for the taste. Not a bad beer, just not for me. As always, though, glad I got to try it."
"D- complex, easy to drink, absolutely delicious, awesome american brown, highly recommended."
"Overall a flavorful brown ale. Very good drinkability."
"D- Another winner for me from Bear Republic. Grabbed this beer as an afterthought and did not reget the call. I keep waiting for the clunker from them, but they continue to amaze. Get any thing you can from this great brewery!"
"Bottle. Poured a clear brown color with a thick light-brown head. Some lacing. Sweet aroma of brown sugar, malt, and caramel. Excellent mouthfeel. Flavor is coffee like, with roasted malts and a faint brown sugar taste to it. A good beer, but not at the same level as other Bear Republic brews."
"Dark Brown with a huge tan head, this beer makes a statement with a big malty body with caramel notes. Smooth finish with a pronounced malty backbone. A nice food friendly beer that maintains a good balance. It should be noted that the largest chunk of brown sediment fell out of the bottle. very strange"
"Drinkability is sub-par because of the sharp, acidic flavors. I hope this was just a bad bottle. This brew was certainly not up to Bear Republic standards."
"This is not a bomb of a brew, light notes of stout-esque flavors and essence reward the mouth and nose; not a blockbuster brown ale but nevertheless a good ol American Brown Ale; warm multifaceted and complex through warming, very drinkable and enjoyable."
"The feel is thick and chewy. It's like a porter but milky instead of dry. Oh and it remains in the mouth long after. It's really thick, sweet and balanced. Tons of flavors to choose from (coffee, caramel, milk, malt), take your pick. I'll just have to keep it to one at a time, please."
"Pours a nice clean dark brown color, nice carbonation, very nice two-finger plus creamy tan head, lots of sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is malty, slightly roasted, toffee, coffee, and some caramel. The taste is malty, nice touch of roasted malts, some toffee, coffee, and caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a tasty Brown Ale, another tasty brew from BR, highly recommended."
"Still wondering if Bear Republic makes a bad beer. If they do, I have yet to have tried it."
"Good mouthfeel for an English brown, and a very drinkable beer. Recommended."
"Solid brown ale...nothing spectacular. Wouldn't mind drinking this for a change of pace every once in awhile."
"This is my kind of brown ale. Big creamy flavors at an abv that could easily handle a session. I've sampled all Bear Republic's readily available beers and every one is either close or at the top of their respective styles. High quality brown here."
"Two thumbs down."
"Drinkability: I was impressed by this one. My idea of what a session beer should be. Not massively complex, but with some definite discernable, pleasant, and balanced flavors. Very nice offering. Bear Republic can do no wrong, I'm convinced."
"Highly recommended."
"Into a nonic, pours a dark brown with slight ruby hues, a nice, creamy, plump head of off-white color and nice lacing. Pretty nice nose, lots of malts and chocolate, brown sugar is apparent. maybe some faint molasses, lots of stuff, pretty good. The taste I can't quite appreciate, its just too damn sweet. As per the label description, lots of brown sugar and molasses, some chocolates and nuts playing in the background, but its just too sweet and there is some lactose that makes it really difficult to drink. The mouth is decent otherwise, but man it was almost difficult finishing this one. Overall, I""m a big fan of this brewer, but this one just rubbed me the wrong way."
"Drinkability: A light and easy beer, the mouthfeel threw me off. Good balanced flavors, went well with my chicken panini."
"The taste is pleasant enough, though maybe not my favorite style, so drinkability is pretty good for those who like brown ales. I prefer it warmer than the recommended temperature as it allows for the more pleasant & complex smells & and tastes to come forward."
"I've got to say, this is one of the better browns that I've had recently. Well made, and deliciously malty, this is a fitting tribute to anyone. It's not the best brown out there, but it is a damn fine one. I'd highly recommend this to anyone, and it is worth seeking out. This would also make a damn fine session beer."
"Looks appropriately brown with a large cream-colored head. Caramel and butterscotch come through strongly in the taste and smell, with a slight roastiness and mild hop presence. Somewhat overcarbonated for the style and perhaps a bit thinner than I'd like, but overall very drinkable and nice."
"Good, but not great. Somewhat pricey for the overall quality."
"Found this hiding in a small store locally. 22 oz bottle. Pours a rich brown with red highlights and fat tan head and good lacing. Big nose of roasted malts, and citrus hops. Mouthfeel is rich and pleasant. Slightly bitter finish. Well balanced and well crafted brown ale."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer that I wish was more readily available. Definitely recommended."
"A balanced and very drinkable brown ale; pleasurable, but lacking in distinctiveness."
"Drinkability: Nice. Strikes me more as a wannabe stout or Baltic porter, but I'd certainly drink another."
"From a 22 ounce bottle, this brew pours a dark brownish-black color, dense, with only a slight reddish-edged hue when held to the light. The head is a whitish tan, presenting beautiful lace. You can tell just by looking that his is a full-bodied and hefty beer. The aroma is pleasant: a serious molasses and malt nose, mixed with brown sugar, burnt honey, and bitter chocolate. The taste is sweet, and a little chalky. Theres raisins, smoke, and lots of highly-roasted malts that come out in the taste. Very full bodied, with an almost syrupy like mouthfeel. This is one serious brew. Id go out of my way for another one of these."
"Drinkability: This is probably the best brown I've had as far as balls and complexity without going over the top and making it more toward an Imperial or anything like that. I sure wouldn't mind having a beer like this named after me, and at around $5 a bomber it's certainly worth a shot, especially for the fall season right now (which I suppose is almost ending) in Richmond."
"Overall very drinkable but could be an excellent beer with an inprovement in MF."
"Notes: The nose and flavors of this beer were very good to excellent, and other than that way-active carbonation, it was a nice-looking beer.. But that carbonation really killed the mouthfeel and IMO detracted from the beer. This is one beer that I think could really benefit greatly from being served on cask. But from the bottle, it's still a solid offering and a tasty brown ale."
"Overall: This is a good beer. I will buy it again."
"Not an everyday beer. Surprisingly substantial. A better candidate for cold weather drinking than I thought it would be."
"After my last two Bear Republic's I was hoping for another something special. Sadly let down here. Flavors lean on the sweet side but nothing's really there to me. Mouthfeel just feels thinner than I'd hope. Nutty flavors seem to be the most prevalent. Other than that the sweetness almost seems nondescript. The finish is what really killed this beer for me. Kind of a sour acid yeast flavor. Reminded me of some Alesmith beers I had a year ago. I don't know if this is the result of me buying an older beer (where's the dating?) or the yeast strain just gone funky for this batch. Maybe I'll try again, hopefully I can sample this on tap somewhere."
"Mouthfeel is thin. OK, but not great. Drinkability is good, I could drink a few of these, but I don't really want to. I'm not a big fan of the nuttier brown ales, so this didn't do much for me."
"An unusual brown ale, and not a bad one at all. My first beer from Bear Republic, and I was sufficiently intrigued by this to try others as they become available."
"Sparkling deep garnet. Short, quick to fade tan head of small bubbles. Subsequent vigorous pours did manage to generate a bit larger head, but it did not last too long. Plentiful carbonation streams float towards the surface. Aromas of deeply roasted brown sugar and caramel pair with a molasses sweetness which has just a faint note of burnt wood. The aromas translate directly into the flavors. The roasty caramel sweetness is present initially and complimented by an ample malt body with a full molasses flavor. There are just enough piney hops in the finish to keep this from becoming cloying, and there is also some dryness from the roasted malt. A bit of brown sugar arrives as the temperature increases. Medium-full body with a firm mouthfeel and fine carbonation, there is a dry smoothness about this. No problems drinking and enjoying this one."
"D: I've heard people bag on this beer, I thought it quite good. A good english brown ale is the most under rated style IMO."
"Very smooth in mouthfeel, this brew has a nice milk stout flavor to it. Coffee overtones coupled with sweet cream nicely cut through a slight hoppy bitterness. Well balanced, and nicely masking the 6.3% ABV. A good beer, but not what I would call a brown. More like a stout. Nice price too at $3.59 for the bomber."
"Poured a very ddep brown color with prominent tannish head. Smell is excellent with a strong roasted nut aspect mixed with rich darl mollasses and coffee. Taste delivers every promise of the smell with very rich roasted notes and a strong coffee flavor. Finished rich and creamy in the mouth with a sensational refreshing fullness. Truly an excellent beer."
"Pours a dense, dark brown, topped with a mountain of khaki head. Opaque with the yeast pour. Great head retention, keeping forever, the foam lacing on the glass in large blobs. Big, sweetish aroma. Roasty, caramelly malt, with syrupy molasses and nutty overtones. Hazelnut and walnut. The flavor opens with sweetish, dark brown toffee and gooey molasses. Creamy on the palate, thicker than your average brown ale. This brew gathers quite a bit of character at room temperature. Nutty and fruity, lots of complexity, reminding me of a chocolate and walnet cookie, with the little bit of doughy yeast presence. Bittersweet roastiness into the finish, a bit of floral hops, ending off balanced and fairly fry. Nice, sessionable stuff. A surprise from these folks, light on the hops!"
"Tasty. A bomber goes down rapidly."
"Drinkability: Pleasant enough to drink but a few flaws keep me from enjoying it more"
"Poured a lovely opaque brown with subtle hues of black and amber and a thick, flowing off-white colored head leaving behind rings of lacing. Aromas of grains, roasted sugar, and burnt toast seemed to come to mind. The taste was just incredible with a dominating malt flavor that had hints of mint, pine, and caramel. In addition, there was a pronounced smoked flavor that underlined the other flavors. Sweet and malty with added textures and bite; but a bit too bread-like in the finish. Excellent drinkability. To me this tasted more like a well designed porter or stout which I really like rather than an EB ale."
"Drinkability: one of the most drinkable brown ales I have had. Worth seeking this one out."
"This brew pours a cola brown with a nice head that has sustained nicely. Nose is malty, a bit nutty, and has a hint of chocolate. Taste is very good, just a right amount of sweetness to start, a bit chocolatety, malty, and nutty, and finishes with a dry hop. Complex yet subtle! Mouthfeel is medium bodied, nice for the style. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a nicely crafted brew that is a good representation of the style. Another nice brew from the folks at Bear Republic!"
"Tributes taste touches upon cinnamon stick or allspice. The mix of robust malts with a hint of spice is compelling. Brown ale is a fickle style that can taste like shoe leather if not executed with some agility. Tribute is a fine tribute to a departed friend and a hearty beer style."
"Overall: This is the first Bear Republic beer I've had that only seemed okay. It's not a bad brown ale, but it's not as exciting as their pale ales or stout, and the thin mouthfeel really got in the way of things for me. More boring than anything; not one I'll buy again."
"-UF"
"I find this quite enjoyable....not a true 'big"" beer but a very flavorful brown ale....sweet without being sticky...nice brew...would drink gladly again..."
"Dark maroon body, the head is moderate, then fades to a think layer of tan head. This one smell very chocolatey, like frosting, maybe a hint of hazelnut thrown in there also. Sweet and brown sugary in the nose, smells very good. Taste is rich and sweet, slightly nutty, but this beer really sufferes from it's thin and watery mouthfeel. A good brown ale, except for the watery-aspect."
"I don't know Pete Brown or anything about the circumstances of this tribute beer. But I raise my glass to his inspiring this truly fine beer."
"just outstanding. one of the best brown ales I have had."
"Pours a deep brown, with ruby highlights and a large, light tan head. Aroma of roasted nuts, sweet malt, caramel and some dark fruitiness. This beer didn't really do it for me. No outstanding flavours. Just a blend of non-commital flavours, none to define this beer. Some spiciness, malt sweetness and slight hop flavour. Medium bodied, ok drinkability. I've had better from Bear Republic."
"The initial flavor is great however the lingering metallic grapefruit, orange, and resin flavors may limit a session."
"Tasty and mild brew here. Super drinkable. The only flaw if you can call it that is that this is very basic. No real subtle flavors or scents to discover. It is super drinkable. Got to wonder about the style seems to be really a good porter than an English Brown ale."
"clear with nice red wine highlights. not much foam left at the time of review.. some lacing. aroma leads off with a mild cocoa note and follows through with a nutty beeriness. mild overall aroma. taste is crisp and somewhat fruity, with a distinct wood profile backing it up. some worn leather flavors. slightly metallic. crisp hoppiness hides any of the chocolate/nut flavors here. this beer is a bit too 'green' for me, but emerges extremely drinkable for the 6+%. why does the label call this beer 'strong'? is 6% strong nowadays? anyway, a tribute beer consumed as a tribute to an old friend.. can't really complain about that. i would have no problem adding this to a short-list of session browns."
"Body is a touch thin."
"Pours a very dark mahogany brown, almost opaque, which is interesting for a brown. Nice tall tan head that impressively sticks around for the entire glass with good lacing to boot. Aroma is delicious, nutmeg, cinnamon, nuts, toffee and roasted malt. Taste isn't quite as tantalizing, but still quite good. Roasted toffee malts, holiday spices, nuts, with an iced tea aftertaste like Newcastle. A little strange, but I enjoy the iced tea aftertaste, adds a level of refreshingness on a hot August night. I always love a good brown to quench the thirst. Mouthfeel is a little thinnish, but that also adds to the drinkability. Even at 6.3%, definitely session material. A very tasty brown and another solid offering from Bear Republic."
"Pours a deep cherry-red/brown color with two fingers of beige head. Delicious roasty smell with strong notes of nuts and a sweet molasses lurking in the background. Taste was not as good as the smell--roasted nuts and brown sugar upfront followed by a strong milk-like sweetness with a moderate hop bite. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish. This beer is solid for the style, but just isn't to my liking--too much sweetness and not enough roasted flavors."
"Poured out of a 22 oz bomber a deep brown with some reddish highlights thru ou with a rather thin off white fizzy head.Love the rich aromas here deeply roasted malt and caramel with a nice raw nuttiness in there as well.A bigger than normal brown here and packed with flavor,milk choclate and caramel up front but a dry,earthy raw nut finish make this quite complex and very drinkable.I have to say this is one of the better browns I have had,heres to ya Pete Brown!"
"Dark, deep, reddish brown colour, fairly clear, topped by a dense light brown head with good retention and lacing. Nutty and toasted malt aroma with a moderate hoppiness as well. Some chocolate in there too. Carbonation seems a little high. Starts on the sweet side with malty and nutty flavours. Fairly strong bitterness appears at the mid-point, along with dark chocolate. It finishes roasted and malty, a little on the short side. Hop flavour is present, but subdued. Moderately creamy texture. Quite a tasty brown ale and almost like a little brother to the Big Bear Black Stout. Another winner from Bear Republic."
"Drinkability is fairly good. The slightly over-the-top roastiness shine as it warms and is a little bit of twist on the style. Good solid brew."
"I could enjoy a bomber of this easily and would enjoy again if given the opportunity, especially on tap. Not my favorite style, but a nice offering and tribute from BR."
"Dark brown/red, nice tall tan head that sticks around and makes an interesting shape. Smells very roasty, with some hop presence and sweet malt. Damn, taste is insane malty and roasty, best brown ale I've had. It's more of a porter with all the roasty malts. Really bitter roasted malt/hop finish, this beer is mighty tasty. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel, with perfect carbonation, I really recommend trying this beer. Thanks northyorksammy for the trade."
"What a solid tribute beer. Dont be gentle with the last pour. The flavors pop more when getting to the depth of the container. Fantastic."
"Another winner from Bear Republic! This beautiful brown ale has a great appearance and the typical brown ale nutty/toasty malt aroma and flavor that's expected with a small handful of extra hops thrown in. It's very well-brewed, clean, balanced, and highly drinkable! Of course it's still a very basic beer - brown ale is! - but it's a good one! I'd love to try in cask-conditioned!"
"A clean dark brown beer with amber highlights. Has a big foamy light brown head. The aroma has a good malty nose with a rich nutty character and a hint of hops in the bacground. The flavor starts with arush of roasted maltiness with a hint of molassess on the back of your tongue just before a light roasted malt bitterness finishes things off."
"Pours a deep brown color. No real head to speak of. Somewhat bready aroma other then that not much there. Malty flavor-slight hop bitterness. Very one dimensional. Nothing really stands out. What flavor is there is somewhat soapy. Ok body. A very ho hum beer. Im sorry to say not much of a tribute. Im suprised since everything I have had from Bear has kicked ass."
"Pours a deep brown with a rather thick tan head. The smell is a very nice mix of brown sugar, caramel, and a hint of nut. Expecting good things, I was disappointed in the taste. It seemed a bit one dimensional and never lived up to the promise of the inviting aroma. Although it seemed on the verge of exploding with flavor, it wound up retaining a somewhat flavorless dryness. Based on past experience with BR, I expected great thing but was a bit disappointed. This is the first time I've rated a BR brew under 4.0."
"Deep brown, Ok in terms of taste. Malty sweet more than hoppy, both significant malty and hoppy. Mollasses, brown sugar. Grainy, nutty. An average ale for them, drinkable. They make better.Courtesy of the Buffalo contingent at Radekfest Rerate May 2005"
"Pete's Brown is a wonderful beer and is one of the best of the 25 brown ales that I've had to date. Bear Republic does not disappoint. While it doesn't rise to the stratospheric heights of their hoppy beer, this tribute to Pete Brown is a fine tribute indeed."
"effort by Bear Republic."
"Very thin, porter or dry stout fining head with a half crescent in it. Dark brown with just a touch of ruby to hue. Very sweet nose; like raspberries dipped in caramel, or, like Duncan Hines brownie mix. Gargle of peanut butter cup on tongue with a whisper of burnt character in its tailing; seems almost closer to a rauchbier; nice malt foundation. This is a palatable offering, though a little off-kilter for a brown."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful crystal and roasted malt scent that is almost perfect for the style. It also has a nice floral hop aroma that balances it well. The taste is perfect. It has a creamy and sweet crystal malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and earthy with a hop flavor that is present, but secondary to the malts. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a f@#king great beer. I love the taste more than anything. It has so much going on; the hops, malts, etc. This is my new favorite brown ale."
"On tap at ';bones. Very dark brown when served, with a low head. Aroma-wise, there is some intrigue from roatsed cocoa nubs, and then some vegetal notes take over. Medium in body, the flavor is all about being roasty. It starts with some initial grainyness, then there's some vegetal notes, and then the roasted flavor takes over. I don't think I've ever used this word in a beer review before, but: this was a weird beer. Not awful, just may have been in weird shape."
"Everywhere else, this is a great drinking brew. The mouthfeel kicks ass, on par with the rest of the Bear Republic brews I've had to date. Both light enough and heavy enough, ya know?"
"Drinkability- For me, not at all. If it were up to my girlfriend this beer would get a 4+. So, I guess brown ales lovers should give it a go. It is bitter though."
"Bomber bottle with no freshness dating. Leaves alot of creamy and thick lacing. Malty, cocoa nose.The bottle talks about this being a ""strong American Brown ale", but this one really tastes more British in style. Its tastes are fairly muted and reserved. It does show off a well developed and lucious sweet,malty backbone. Notes of vanilla, caramel, light chocolate. Medium bodied, easy to quaff, a pleasure to swill with food. Tasty and very drinkable Brown ale."
"($4.04 / 22 oz.)"
"Poured into a pint glass, formed a 1"" medium tan head over the deeply reddish brown brew. Head is dense and lasting, with good lacing. Aroma is of toasted malts, mainly, with some hops notes. Flavor follows the nose nicely. Mouthfeel is good, although for such a full malt flavor you'd expect a bit more substance over the tongue, almost comes off a bit thin, but good nonetheless. Drinkability is great. Nice brown ale."
"Supreme fruitiness, mainly dark berries, with an inappropriate syrup taste of maple and fruit and an underlying taste of caramel and other toasted grains. This is very tasty for the style but I wish the toasted malt would shine through a bit more."
"Pours a deep chestnut brown color with a tan head. Rich, roasty chocolate and malt notes, nutty, and a healthy dosage of lower alpha hops, too. Very pleasant array of flavors without being overwhelming in one aspect. Husky and chocolaty and vastly nutty in the malt. Mouthfeel is kept to a minimum without sacrificing its intention of being a grandiose English brown. Finishes a bit on the drier side mith almost a macadamia nut-like residual flavor. Very good."
"Pours a foamy, solid light cocoa colored head. Dark chestnut colored beer. Rich dry chocolatey aroma that is just barely nutty. Woody, chocolate flavored beer. Easy drinking, moderate bodied beer. A solid nut brown, but you can do better for the price."
"Really nice."
"22oz bomber bottle with a label stating this beer is a tribute to sales manager who passed away. This one pours a dark brown color with a reddish highlights and a light tan head with decent size. The smell is of nutty malts and coffee flavors with notes of hops as well. The flavor starts of with a nutty sweetness and espresso/coffee notes. There is a roasted taste as well throughout with piney hop notes also. Mouthfeel is full and rich and it goes down very smooth with a slight sweet aftertaste. One of the tastier brown ales I have ever had and another good beer from Bear Republic."
"Pours an opaque brown coloor with ruby highlights when held up to the light. It is topped by a medium colored light brown head. A wonderful aroma jumps out of my glass, it is a mix of nutty malt flavors, espresso, and fresh hops. Hoppy flavors up front yield to a dry roasted malt finish. It is slightly sweet up front and has a certain nuttiness that carries throughout the beer. I get notes of sweet caramel, toffee, and a certain huskiness in the finish. This is a fine example of a Brown ale, and I definitely recommend it."
"Notes: Mouthfeel is a bit soft, and thats about the only negative I can find on this one. Good beer. Flavors linger for a long time, but they're not too harsh for a brown."
"This is very well crafted, and nicely balanced. I'm just not a fan of American brown ales, and this one doesn't change my mind, in spite of my affinity for Bear Republic."
"22 ounce bottle."
"This brew is a deep, clear burgandy. Thin light beige head has great retention. Lacing is better than average. I like the aroma. Nice west coast induced piney hop tones mix with the chocolate and nutty tones of the malt nicely. The flavors are more subtle than the nose led me to believe. Nice low key chocolate and roasted malt tones. A little hop bitterness. And a little nuttiness. Could use a jolt of something though. I'm not sure why the bottle calls this a ""Strong American Brown"" ale. It's not strong in flavor or alcohol. Would do for a session ale though."
"I'm a sucker for tributes and such, so I had to buy it. Great stuff I was lucky to find on a whim in Richmond, VA, it went well extremely well with a dinner of barbecue ribs, baked beans, and slaw. Definitely above average."
"Still, while not cloying in flavor, the beer is a bit sticky in mouthfeel, and less sticky as a result. This is more noticeable as you work through the beer and the carbonation dies down. A decent beer from a great brewery."
"Dark brown color. Large foamy head. Aroma is fairly mild, but its nutty with a touch of brown sugar. A medium bodied brown ale. Malts are nutty and sweet. Hops are grapefruity and piney. Hoppy for a brown ale, but Bear Republic makes it work. The dryness contrasts nicely with the malt and brown sugar sweetness. Nicely balanced. Very smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Drinkability gets a low score because this brew is a palate wrecker, and has a deceptively high ABV."
"Comments  My newer bottle showed a big jump in ABV, from 5.1 to 6.3."
"Brown ale is one variety I don't have much experience with. When I saw this offering from the stupendous Bear Republic, I had to try it. Very dark porter like color that had a thick tan head. Lacing was in rings that went all the way down. Slight roasted smell and some sweet malt. Very smooth slightly roasted taste, malt base solid and as aroma indicated, on the sweet side. I found this ale quite drinkable and not heavy at all. No surpise to me that I liked another Bear Republic beer."
"Not one I would recommend to others."
"Nice deep, somewhat clear dark chestnut brown color with slivers of orangey red. Solid cream colored finger high head of cappuccino froth, retains for a wee bit before fading to a crumbly collar and lace in minimal strings and spots. Aroma has a solid roastyness to it thats close to coffee, but seems more like espresso, not all that strong, a definate moderate presense with an overall dry quality, it also has a little touch of sweet molasses and chocolate in there mixing with a bit of hazelnut and vanilla. Great subtle nose. Taste is semi sweet malts with a slight roastyness mostly coming through at the finish but withholds throughout and within the ride lies some nice subtle notes of vanila and nuts. The roastyness is quite nice, milding and toasty surrounded by a chocolatey cookie dough sweetness. Quite nice. Ends clean and dry with lingering qualities wrapped up in sweet roasted malts and chocolate. Feel is medium bodied with a clean substantiated roastyness thats mild and well rounded with a small dry finish that holds some lingering sweet yet roasty tones. An excellent drinkin' brown, a bit more boldness and fullness within the flavors and this would be supurb stuff. That said, this is still a very nice brown. One I wouldn't turn down for nothing! Big time thanks to Gusler for throwing this in!!"
"The beer pours as deep a mahogany as you can get without being brown with garnet high lights, the head is pythonic size, the texture spumous with the color a beauteous light than as it transmogrifies the lace forms a thick and sealing sheet upon the glass. Sweet malt dominates the nose, vanilla, hints of caramel and a nut like tone also noticed, start is quite sweet, nice malt presence, top is middling in feel. Finish is mild in carbonation, the hops pleasing and subdued in their spiciness, somewhat dry with a bit of tartness and a long lasting aftertaste, personally would have expected a bit more body overall, not a bad beer, just a tad light in the wrong places for me. Possibly could be a bit flat, will need to get another bottle and sample as I love Bear Republic, Still would make a great session beer."
