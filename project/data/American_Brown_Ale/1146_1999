4.25,12.1,,,,,,"Pours a dark brown in color with a 3mm beige head that settles down to just along the edges of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen. Sediment is seen at the bottom of the bottle. The aroma is like a good seasonal Christmas/ Winter brew with holiday spices, brown sugar, caramel, dark fruits and dark bread. The taste is close to that with lots of tasty flavors mixed in for a good balance. Good mix of spices as you can taste some cinnamon, nutmeg and others spices as well as some toffee. Very nice and no bitter or harsh finish. Medium to Medium+ bodied with perfect carbonation. Just makes you wish for cooler weather since it has been in the low 80's for most of September. Overall a great brew.","BeerWithMike","Sep 27, 2014"

I'm not sure this will "develop in the bottle for up to 5 years." Still, this is a fairly complex brown ale, which is saying something for most brown ales.

Seems like a lot of work. Anyway, not the best brown ale I've had. It had a nice nutty flavor to it, but there was an overpowering sour/sweetness to it that I didn't love. Hazy brown color that wasn't super appetizing. I prefer their Sixth Day around the holidays I think.","MarkQ617","Dec 25, 2013"

The base liquid is clear, however, there is a huge amount of sediment floating about creating an overall opaque appearance, red brick to orange clay in color, can’t see any bubbles with all that muck. The nose is rum cake to fruit cake, baking spices, sweet vanilla and caramel, surprisingly boozy and alcoholic, has more subtly present orange citrus, bread crust and burning caramelized brown sugar notes, the fruit muted. Full-bodied, on the heavy side even if generally creamy in texture, just feels like it’s running with ankle weights on. More dry than sweet, the grittiness of the sediment an obvious factor in impeding flow. The carbonation is mild but sufficient. Piles on the chocolate, caramel, butterscotch and ginger, clove spice with pine sap and orange citrus, here the hops get more assertive. Not that yeasty nor bready, the fruit is kind of cherry to mixed berry, the sort of thing you’d find in a chocolate and fruit dessert. Not as boozy as the nose but you do perceive some heat and imbalance. Despite the above it’s really a pretty good brew – three previous bottles consumed before this write-up were better suggesting earlier consumption for optimal pleasure (sediment too a concern).","farrago","Jan 08, 2013"

3.55,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"2012 vintage poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, opaque, amber brown coloring with some unfiltered suspensions throughout. Sparse, filmy white surface coating with a slightly thicker ring around the glass. Aromas of nut sweetness, tangy caramel, sugary sweetness, old world fruits, and a floral hops presence. Pretty unique nose, and well blended, as it was hard to tease out specifics. Flavors are a solid lead punch of old world fruits, including date and fig, with a subtle ribbon of tart fruit sweetness, as well as tangy caramel and rich hazelnut. Very strong, deep, big, sweet flavors on the palate. Cloying is just cut short by an overpowered bitter hops profile, but that, too, is eventually overpowered. The sweet, earthy tones begin to overrun your taste buds. Dark cherry and oak characteristics come into the aftertaste, giving this a wine-like feel at the end of the drink, especially as you continue to drink and characteristics build. Rich, robust flavors on a mid-bodied brew lead to a rich, slightly cloying finish. Interesting, big brew, and great for the cold weather, but this one has a lot going on.","GarthDanielson","Dec 04, 2012"

3.33,-12.1,3.5,3,3.5,4,3,"Pours a hazy chestnut-brown color. A tan head leaves just a trace of lacing. The nose is predominantly malty -- some nuttiness atop a bed of caramel. Some slight spice notes... maybe cinnamon and/or nutmeg. It's faint, which is fine by me as I'm not into spiced ales all that much. On the palate, this follows the nose somewhat closely. Rich and malty, bitterness subdued but present enough to lend balance, subtle spice notes that are hard to describe but definitely take the flavor in a different direction than a pure American brown. Mouthfeel features a soft carbonation akin to a good stout, and it works well here too. All in all, this hits all the right marks, but it just doesn't wow me.","gr0g","Nov 23, 2012"

The flavor is sweet with lots of dark sugars and melanoidins. Light fruit flavors mixed with a bit of hay and I'm getting chestnuts? as well. Light spicy citrus bite and a touch of ethanol keeps everything on balance. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel.

Pours a deep mahogany, lots of floaties, and a nice really off white head, that leaves lots of lace. Smell is carmel, nutmeg, toffee, and bready. Taste is much stronger, very little nutmeg with loads of carmel and toffee and some dark fruit, this is going to be a staple this Holiday season. Body is on the larger side, plenty of life, not dry, and really drinkable.

The smell is sweet, lots of caramel, maple and very malty. No hops aroma just very soft and malty. The taste of the beer is almost fruity with some spice and brown sugar.

Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, pepper, clove, toffee, nuttiness, pine, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, pine, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors with good complexity. No cloying flavors at all after the finish.

It's definitely an excellent winter beer, but can easily be enjoyed in the summer (as I have chosen to do).

3.63,-4.2,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall I thought that this was a good American Brown Ale and so far the best beer I have had from Goose Island. It had a nice malt profile, it wasn't overly spicy, and it had a nice amount of hops. It tastes like a mix of a hoppy American Brown Ale and a Winter Warmer. This beer had OK drinkability I could probably go for another one but after that I think the sweetness would get to me, it also goes pretty well with a meal. What I liked most about this beer was the way it's look and it's complexity in the aroma and taste they were a lot of balanced flavors going on. What I liked least about this beer the higher amount of sweetness and the high amount of carbonation, both would be pretty good if they were turned down a little bit. I would get this beer again when looking for a good holiday ale, it is a little different from your normal holiday Winter Warmer and I like that. I recommend giving this beer a try, it's a nice change of pace from the average Holiday Ale. This was a good attempt at a drinkable beer for the holidays and it has a good mixture of flavors and aromas that suit the season well, Goose Island manages to impress me a little with this beer.","StoutHunter","Dec 26, 2011"

The nose comprises caramel, dark greens, black pepper, very light hard water, and light rye bread. The taste brings in more of the same, along with more black pepper, some mandarin orange, and a pinch of nutmeg. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick, fluid feel.

The beer poured a dark copper, a lighter shade of mahogany perhaps. Finger and change of offwhite head, having modest retention and some lacing. Nose has toffee, fruity malts, some dark berry notes and some distinct milk chocolate. Hint og some spicing as well. Taste has an interplay of rich toffee and carmel, more milk and dark chocolates. Finishes with a bit more spice and roasty character, yet remains fairly sweet throughout each sip. Low carbonation with a medium full feel, being fairly creamy at times. Good drinkability, a nice brown ale with light spicing. This has aged moderately well I'd think.","WoodBrew","Dec 22, 2011"

Taste is fantastically smooth for the style with a nice, crisp finish with a nie lingering taste in the back of my gums towards the throat. The caramel malt and spices blend well together, a touch of quality hops are detected, a touch of ale yeast.

All kinds of tasty malts and a touch of honey. Taste is rich and full; a roasted feeling lasts the entire time, with an added bonus of spices which also linger in the finish. It's tight and sweet, yet fulfilling. Its richness prevents a long session, but this beer does exactly what a warmer (even tho it's not..) should do - satisfy the taste buds and stomach in a short amount of time.

Single-finger white head to begin, quickly falling into a thin white collar and a few bubbles around the edges. The nose brings a bit of caramel sweetness and a mild dark-fruit presence. Somewhat dry and not too spicy; not sure if it ever was. The taste is nice and moderately-sweet with a pronounced caramel presence. No real spice, but there is a mild, understated hop character there. Medium body and a fairly-dry finish.

The flavor is much more complex and a big improvement over the aroma. I get a lot of caramel and toffee malts, but there is also a nice hop component to the flavor. I get some grass and pine hops which provide a nice bit of bitterness to balance out all of the malt sweetness. I also get some cocoa in the flavor and maybe a little bit of spice, but if it is there, it is very subtle. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

The citrus part is interesting because it's a sweet citrus scent that I can't quite put my finger on. The taste is pretty stellar for an amber. It has some hoppyness that makes your mouth water to accompany the subtle malt flavor. Being over a year old it drinks very, very smoothly but still has good crispness when it hits your palate.

The flavor is definitely not faithful to the style, but that's our affectation and not the brewery's. It's relatively sweet and malty with lots of malt fruitiness on the palate. This is a good and interesting beer, but it lacks complexity and a real hook. That seems a bit contradictory, but the beer is interesting as being malt fruit dominant but boring as these flavors are easily appreciated and don't really go anywhere. This is a nice Christmas ale that avoids the common holiday beer pitfalls, but it doesn't really have a big enough backbone or enough soul to grab me.

Brew poured to a nice russet brown color with a somewhat thinnish head, but the retention was good leaving some nice lacing. The smell is nice, it does have properties of a brown ale, slight coffee with a nice nut like aroma but also perhaps a slight spiciness. The aroma works for me, more on the brown ale side than spiced holiday brew. Some bread like aromas as well. The flavor while a little odd is very good. Biscuit and a slight cocoa flavor that breaks to a mild hop spiciness. Hop flavor lingers at the back of the moth for a bit. Don't think I would want more than a 22 in a sitting but it is a good brew and one I would get in the future.

It's a bit too hard for me to discern what spices are lurking there, but they come out more in the taste: hints of allspice, clove and maybe even cinnamon. English tasting (read: Goldings, Fuggless) hops are tasted and give the beer nice balance, especially in the finish. This is full-bodied which I appreciate this time of year.

Strong carbonation can barely be seen through the darkness. Strong biting mouthfeel, real creamy and good. Flavor is rich and complex. Roasty with almost a burnt quality countered by a slight sweetness, dark cherries perhaps. A touch of strong coffee makes a quick presence. Nice bittering hops really attack the senses.

The color is dark brown almost reddish, light and easy to see through. A slightly spicy, alcohol-like, and hoppy smell. Spices and hops fight each other for dominance. The hoppy taste is prevelent and the spicy flavors are in the back ground. It's good as an IPA, but as a "christmas ale"/brown ale it doesn't fit the description of the style. I still enjoy this and will review it as is. There is a brown-like sourness in the back ground. So it's a hoppy brown ale that's pretty drinkable. Goes down good.

Don't get me wrong - its tasty and I recommend it - but it is a steady decline from start to finish. A good Winter Warmer, but not in the league of a Sierra Nevada Celebration or a Great Lakes Christmas Ale. That said, its still much better than a lot of cold weather beers, and pairing it with some good, sharp cheddar (or a cheese soup) or a nice, hot deli or bar sandwich would probably help it a lot to balance out the dead spots, and I would recommend as well as drink it again.

4.13,9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"'Tis the season for Christmas ales! I was excited to try Goose Island's Christmas Ale - it's been a year or two since I last had it. Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with a 10/16/06 packaged-on date. Pours a lovely ruby red with a medium, tan head. Excellent retention. Smells of sweet toasted malt, bread, caramel, hints of citrus (maybe orange), clove, cinnamon, plus some nice piny hops. Warm and spicy. The taste surprised me, as the hops really come into play. The spices and malt are present at the beginning of the taste, but the hops bloom on the middle and back of the tongue. Very good mouthfeel - just right for a winter warmer - medium thickness that complements the flavors. A highly drinkable beer - excellent example of the style.","ndekke39","Dec 16, 2006"

Has a heavier feel in the mouth, and not a whole lot of carbonation. Overall, a pretty good beer, but nothing too special.

Strong vanilla notes in the nose, along with faint roast barley and herbal english hops. Flavor is sweet with dextrin, pale malt, and dark kilned crystal. Dry aftertaste, some weak holiday spice flavors become present, including musty vanilla beans. Timid english hop bitterness somewhat balances the malt sweetness. Medium in body and lightly carbonated, the mouthfeel is silky and smooth. Finish is a bit residual with a hint of vanilla, but mostly clean. At 5.4% ABV,I doubt this is suitable to age for 5 years, nor that it is bottle conditioned as the label states. The spices seem a bit too subdued, and the overall flavor is borderline bland. This would be more interesting with a greater malt/hop/spice depth, and consequently achive a higher drinkability.","PBRstreetgang","Oct 05, 2006"

There was definitely something odd in the smell. The taste was of deeply roasted maltiness, along with a hoppy/piney flavor. Again, chocolate lacings.

The first sip reveals a milder malt base, flecked thoroughly with coffee, diminishing quickly before the hops. A bittersweet mocha flavor shrinks into the finish, overtaken by citric, herbal hopping. Nice and hoppy in the finish, the bitterness more than enough to balance the malt. Hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste, along with a powdery, dry cocoa malt flavor. Yum.

The beer poured a dark brown with ruby hues and just a coat of head over top of the beer. The nose was very deep caramel with notes of coffee. There was deep, deep hop in there. Damn it smells good. The flavor was great. Full of huge flavors, big well blended hop, big caramel sweetness and hints of coffee. I love it. The feel was big and thick, coating my mouth. The beer is overall very good.

Nice caramel roll malt base starts out and gets accented by those sprucey, scotch tape hops. Hops aren't huge, but the finish is bitter with residual cake batter sweetness.

Taste is dominated by sweet caramel malt, with cinamon and nutmeg in the background. As it warms up, there seems to be an abundance of fresh, green hops that lend a citrus balance. I've gotten this fresh, green, hoppiness from other Goose Island brews, as well, and find it very pleasant.

There's very little spice that I notice - maybe a dash of cinammon or nutmeg, but mostly this tastes like an average version of an IPA, because there's plenty of hops in this beer.

Well settled brew with a mild herbal tea and fake caramel. Not terribly well spiced as far as I can tell. Derives a lot of flavor from roasted malts -- bready, caramel, chocolate. But they're not really distinct flavors or even significant impressions. It's more of a stew of flavors. Finishes with a unique hop footprint and a malt-driven sweetness.","marburg","Dec 30, 2003"

Flavors are muddled, and earthy, they don't seem very crisp and none really stand out. Medium bodied, and easy to drink.

The flavor takes an interesting turn with a sweet fruitiness and some citrusy and piney hops atop a lightly syrupy maltiness. A distinct caramel note is revealed as it warms in the mouth, and some chocolatey character remains but it also picks up a roasted edge that combines with a firm bitterness in a dry and lingering, mildly roasty finish.

Wave of smooth malt sweetness upfront yields to a combination of moderate hop and perhaps citrus rind bitterness. Mellow roasted barley bitterness persists as an undertone. A bit light in body, but this allows for excellent drinkability. Citrusy hop flavor and dryish biscuit malt nudge in mid palate. Finishes smooth, clean and lightly sweet.
