"O - A well done brown ale."

"Clear brown color, lots of malt smell. Great malt taste, earthy kind of nutty. Right amount of hops. I could drink a few of these."

"Poured into a Voodoo bell tulip, dark brown in color, with a finger of tan head that retained as a thick collar and laced the glass. Aroma of chocolate malts and caramel, some dark fruit notes going on as well. This beer can be a bit inconsistent I've found. This particular bottle I think may have been off. There was the typical characteristics of a brown ale here, dark malts, somewhat roasty, caramel sweetness, but also an underlying fruity taste that was sort of in the acetaldehyde / cidery range. Not really sure what was going on here, and it's been a while since I've had this beer, so I can't really compare it to past tastings. Medium body, pretty smooth, but again, a bit messy, off, inconsistent. Worth a try, but definitely not one of Voodoo's best."

"O - This is a fine example of a brew that is better than the sum of its parts. A brown which combines a creamy body with some good flavors, without being overly robust."
""
""
"Surprizingly good with desent flavor."
" The taste is very good with malty toasted taste with sufficiently toffee-like and caramel sweetness with light coffee/cocoa and hint of dried fruit in the light woody realm with mild roast in the finish. Overall a pretty enjoyable brown, plenty of malt and a nice amount of alcohol. Very easy to quaff."

"D: a good drinking, strong brown ale. good/great aroma, good flavor. the astringency is almost too strong as I wouldn't hate for a little softer malt profile to keep things biscuit and a bit rounder. not bad non-the-less."
"Pours a darker brown with a full head that disappates to mostly a rim around the glass. Clean filtered. Aroma is darker malts, brown sugar and maple syrup. Flavor is much of the same - good quality brew. Good balance - not too thick for the beginning of spring, but not too thin to give some heartiness to it."

"Good flavor and drinkability, nice balance in the coffee and hop elements, would definitely have again."
""
""

"More good stuff from Voodoo..Go get it."
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ A rather enjoyable brew. One to try if the chance arises as it has a nice flavor profile and just the right amount of booziness to give it a nice warming feel but yet maintain great drinkability."
""
"O: This quickly became one of my favorite brown ales. This isn't a style I typically enjoy, but this beer really impresses me in all factors. I wish Voodoo had wider distribution! This should be coveted by all."
""
""
""
""
"This is certainly a superior Brown Ale that should give other brewers something to shoot for. The nuttiness with just enough richness, and a good dose of hops is totally drinkable. From Food and Friends in Philadelphia, in the 12 oz bottle."

"o - a Great Brown ale... One I would definitely drink again. And a again."
""
"Pours a dark brown. Medium sized dense persistent off-white head. Mild malty smell. A little chocolate and some sweetness in the nose. Taste is mostly toasted malt. Some chocolate notes again. Fairly low sweetness. Just a little herbal hop flavor. Some bitterness throughout from the hops and maybe some roasted malt. Somewhat creamy mouthfeel but not too heavy. Extremely drinkable. Pretty good stuff overall."
""
"O: This is an easy drinking brown ale that would make a good accompaniment to food, particularly a burger."
""
"O: A very enjoyable beer. A good representation of the style. Would pair very nicely with a beef stew and some sharp cheddar cheese."

"Overall - I got this as an extra in a trade and so happy i did, you can't find these in boston. This reminds me a lot of palo santo marron but about 2 steps down. Which to me is a good thing. I love palo santo, but if i saw this stuff around i would probably pick it over it. Really a great offering, and my first Voodoo beer. Good job guys, will be looking for more in the future!"
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle date. I got a gusher. Pours crystal clear dark brown color with a nice dense 2-3 fingers of light tan head with great retention that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap that lasts forever. Some nice lacing clings around the glass as well. Aromas of roasted malt, caramel, bread, apple skin, light dark fruit, chocolate, and some molasses. I think it is safe to say my bottle might be a bit infected. The apple skin aroma just throws everything off. Taste quite a bit better: big caramel, toasted malt, biscuit, chocolate, bitter coffee, molasses, nuttiness, and spiciness. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, molasses, bread, nuttiness, and spices. Nice balance of flavor and bitterness. A bit of a metallic flavor is present as well. Medium bodied with big full carbonation; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel with big prickly carbonation. Overall for probably being infected, this is an ok brown ale. I will definitely give it another shot sometime, the bomber is only 6 bucks."

"M - Medium body, moderate carbonation."
"O: This is a well-crafted brown ale that pulls you in and makes you want more. I find it to be very well balanced and flavorful. If you like a American-style brown ale this one is for you!"
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O-This one left me a bit flat. I was expecting more in the taste department. Pretty lackluster brew that will not find a space in my cellar."
"O: Maybe a little bit too roasty for me, but not too shabby."
"O: A great example of a style that is often ""mailed in"". This isn't your daddy's brown ale. This is a complex, enjoyable, well-crafted brew that will hang in there with a porter or IPA any day. Great job!"
"Overall a fantastic brown ale end of story."
"O - a most enjoyable brown ale."
"O: A little too much bitterness and coffee flavor for my taste. I prefer more nutty brown ales. But overall, this wasn't bad. The mouthfeel was very nice."
"Wow, I'm guessing a bad bottle based on the other reviews. First things first, pours deep brown with a head that explodes. Smell is all bitter coffee and metallic. Not good and the taste follows. Very bitter and ends with a metallic aftertaste. The mouthfeel is totally over carbonated and just not good. Can't really pull a whole lot of positive out of this one but I'm guessing it is just a bad bottle. Maybe I will try again and hope for a better bottle."
"a solid brown ale, coffee flavors and brown malt are the the highlights here. bigger and better than your average brown. if your ever have the chance to try this, i definatly suggest you do."
"This beer has a lot of coffee going on in it. The beer is a deep brown color, as it should be. The beer didn't have much of a nut flavor to it because the coffee strongly over powers it. The sweetness that a Brown Ale has is also muted for the same reason. This beer is now on the bitter side like cold black coffee."
"O - Certainly the maltiest, and also most bitter, brown that I've ever had. Lot's of characteristics that remind me of stouts and strong dark ales. A very tasty brew."
"Pours an amber brown with yeast floating around. Very little head or carbonation. Muted aroma of coffee and cola. The taste is of caramel and malt. There is almost no bitterness or after taste. I enjoyed this beer and would have it again. I look forward to tasting other offerings from Voodoo."
"medium bodied. this beer is weird. i feel like i could drink a decent amount of it. it's just really different."
"Voodoo has crafted a historic ale at a weight for contemporary palates; it lumps all the habitual hoppiness and monster maltiness now so in vogue and rallies it into the framework of an old timey classic. And, in doing so without compromising the style's traditionally agreeable, quaffable nature, it serves as a resounding example of the craftsmanship and intuition of this brewery and the American craft scene in general."
"D: I am not sure if this is a bad bottle or not as I have not seen anything posted anywhere. Voodoo makes very tasty brews, this one is a miss for me."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a higher than expected amount of carbonation that is a bit prickly on the tongue. I could not finish the glass and don't think I would risk trying another one if I had to pay for it. This just doesn't taste much at all like the Wynona's Big Brown I had before that inspired me to recently pick up this bottle to review. The sample I had before had much more residual sweetness and a much brighter hop character to it. Perhaps this is just an old bottle? Who knows, there is no way to tell how fresh it is since there is no date code. However, the excess carbonation and off character to this brew makes me suspect something might be off with this bottle. I don't know if it provides any benefit since there is no bottle/date code, but this particular bottle had a gold cap."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability set this beer apart. The flavors are very well presented but come clean in the mouth, nothing off balance, good carbontation. An exceptionally drinkable beer, tough to tell it clocks in at >7% abv."
"I have only had two Voodoo beers so far and they were both pretty solid. Hopefully I will get my hands on a Big Black Voodoo Daddy that is if the bar still has it on the menu."
"Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It really is a superb example of a Brown ale for an extremely reasonable price. Packed with numerous flavors and tastes it is one to be enjoyed during a nice chilly day or even a warmer one because it is so dynamic. Because it is so delicious I could pound this but it shouldn't be, just because it so amazing. Voodoo is a great brewery that I have yet to have a bad offering from."
"Wynona's Big Brown Ale is a bold Brown Ale that is rich and full flavored - thumbs-up Voodoo."
"The beer is medium bodied with more than adequate carbonation. Too much carbonation. Sparkles like champagne. That's the big bummer here. If the carb was dialed down and the sparkle subsided, we'd be looking at one of my favorite new Brown Ales. As is, I'd give another vintage a shot the next time I'm out in PA. Another pretty impressive tasting beer from Voodoo!"
"This is a good, drinkable beer. However, due to carbonation level, may lead to a full gassy feeling, that would not lend itself to being sessionable. If not for that, this would be a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: A nice big brown ale that could be a staple for me. Excellent beer."
"Overall, it is a decent brown. A bit roasted, but I like the chocolate and cocoa. Decent drinkability. Fairly solid brown in general."
"Cheers..."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It has a deep brown pour with way,way too much head. The head does sticks around for a while. The nose is full of sweet roasted malt. The taste follows the nose. The roasted malt really shines. The beer is medium/light in body and is very drinkable. A very good brown ale, IMO it drinks more like an Irish stout."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Poured dark brown with a one inch head. I had a ton of flakes floating in the beer but didn't stop me from drinking . Smelled just like brown ale should, roast malts with chocolate and toffee hints. It was not overly carbonated and did not feel too thin like some brown ales I have had in the past. I could have a few of these in one night. A good beer, one that will be on my drink when possible list."
"D - Well not the best brown ale I ever had but still highly drinkable. Pretty nice brown ale."
"Overall, this brew was very disappointing due to what I obviously already pointed out. I will have to revisit a fresh 2010 bottle of this brew, but for now I am very underwhelmed."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, a bit of warmth going down, but pretty drinkable."
"drinkability is great. nice balance. big and tasty. a nice brown ale."
"Very tasty beer."
"This one pours a very dark brown that looks black until held up to the light. There is a thin mocha head that is gone in a flash. The smell is mostly roasted malts with chocolate and a little bitterness from something, maybe some hops. The taste is more roasted malts with chocolate and coffee. A little sweet with little to know hops present. This tastes like an American Stout but the mouthfeel and body are a little thin which bring it back within the Brown Ale style. Drinkability is low for a brown ale but still rather tasty."
"Pour into victory pint glass. Dark brown almost black color. American hops burnt choclate nose. Followed by thin body. You can really taste the american hops and burnt chochlate slight etoh. overall solid brown ale would drink again. Proably my second favorite hoppy brown but prefer Brooklyn Brown"
"Pours a dark brown color with a slight off white head. The aroma is of maple syrup and chocolate with a roasted malt backbone. The taste is of a sweet malt and roasted malt backbone. In the middle there is a chocolate and coffee flavor with a small hop bite, the hops seem to be earthy hops. The mouthfeel is slick and smooth with almost no carbonation. The drinkability is good, slightly above average. The hop bite in the middle ditracted from the nice malty notes. You would go back for a second or third but i cant see you drinking a six pack of these."
"This is a tasty beer and the drinkability could be better if it wasn't so overly carbonated. Overall this is a good beer and i would drink it again."
"D- Drinkability is high in this one. Really smooth, easy to drink brown ale. I liked this one a lot. A good offering from a great brewery."
"d: I automatically compare big browns to DFH's Indian Brown. This is very good, but it doesn't quite measure up."
"Never again."
"Wow...and to think this brewery is only 30 min. from my house. This is a class brewery, and this is a big American Brown Ale, Malty, hint of creamy Chocolate, and nutty. Med. body, and a nice finish, maybe a splash of hop on that finish? The rest of the beer from this brewery is also pretty good, but those I had on tap, Wynona's was from a bottle. upick6 in Erie PA has these regularly on tap and in bottles."
"Pours a hazy dark brown, thinner khaki colored head, decent retention and lacing. Smell is dominated by delicious dark roasted malts, slight earthy, nutty and smokey notes, some faint carmel sweetness is in the back end. Smells bolder than you average brown ale, bordering on porter territory. Taste follows the scent, once again bolder and more assertive than a typical brown ale but not as aggressive as the smell dictates - dark roasted malts, roasted nuts, earthy, slight hints of carmley sweetness. ABVs hidden well. Medium bodied, good carbonation. Another very good brew from Voodoo. Almost infringes on english porter territory with its bolder brown ale profile."
"D - An excellent brown ale... I'm a sucker for beers named after the songs of my youth (this may be the only one) and I wasn't dissappointed. A wonderful introduction to Voodoo Brewing... If the rest of their creations are this good, I can't wait to try them..."
"D-Solid, rich and full flavoured. I loved Matt's big brown beaver, and I would drink it all the time."
"D - Matt's got himself a Big Brown Ale and he shows it off to all of his friends."
"Pours a great deep brown with fantastic head and nice lacing. Excellent deep scent, very dark and malty. A wonderful ent-draught with fantastic deep malt flavors, earthy and dark, with a slight hint of nuttiness. Goes down thick and great, with no hint of it's high (for a brown ale) ABV. Fantastic!"
"Thank god for the Big Pour, on tap in the Burgh!!! I didn't even know they kegged their beers but Bocktown is pouring Wynona's Big Brown Ale and Pilzilla right now. this one pours a deep mahogany brown hue with some ruby highlights peaking through, dark cola like head reflects well through the somewhat dimmed lights of Bocktown. Aroma has the dark semi sweet cocoa and coffee blend with a nut bread edge to it. Herbal hops reach out and grab your senses as well. A touch of anise black licorice grabs ahold as well. Flavor carries it out nicely with complex black roasted malts and chewy brown ale notes, mild coffee with herabl rolling hops and again more of the black licorice kick in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied tight even carbnoation this is much better than the carbonation issues they've had in some of their bottled offerings. Drinkability is all around excellent one of the best brown ales I've tasted in the past few years of getting deeper into beer."
"D: Really great, big brown beer. I feel like it could use a touch more sweetness to fully achieve greatness. I thoroughly enjoyed this!"
"Wynona's Big Brown Ale is a pretty good, novel brown ale. It could use a couple of tweaks. I don't say this often, but I think less hops might really improve it. That aspect of it just doesn't gel extremely well with its malty base and seems to mask some of its other flavors too much. Carbonation could also use a tweak. It's excessive as it is. All in all, I like the concept and the overall result is a success. The execution isn't perfect, but it does the job. As a side note, any Primus fan will appreciate the opportunity to try this beer. I am...on both counts. Thanks, Josh."
"On tap at Capones. This one just did not do it for me. The color was a dark off brown that was somewhat clear with a good tan head. Light lacing with a burnt roasted malt smell. There is a nice hop aroma. But I could not get the burned malt out of my nose. Surprisingly I tasted coffee hints. This beer seemed tilted, unbalanced. The hops and malt did not blend well. In the mouth it seemed to bubbly for this style otherwise it was ok. I had a 4 oz sample and that was enough for me. I wish I dug this beer as much as I dig Primus. Later"
"Recommended - I LOVE ME SOME VOODOO BREWING!!!"
"On-tap at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. Oh man, this is a brown ale for brown ale lover, big rich, and just drinkable enough to get you in trouble. We're talking milk chocolate, caramel, and toffee also with a balance of bread roast that reminded my of dark toast and crust. Surprisingly smooth. Really, watch out for this beer."
"So I reduced the beer to about 1/3 it's original volume on high heat(watch out for boil overs!) added fresh black pepper and buckwheat honey little dijon and fresh tarragon. Marinated for at least 4 hours 3-1 veal breast-pork butt cut up small. Then ground it, mixed in carmelized onions and apples, and adjusted seasoning to taste. My secret recipe I'll only share here, Cheers!"
"Wynona is brown and dark and has a thick like look to it. A nice dark tan colored cap sat on top of the liquid for a while as it warmed up. Minimal lace once again off the tap. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate candy and a dose of hops which are not drowned out by the darker scents. Taste like a big bold brown with a good amount of flavoring hops. Getting some nuts and grain as well plus some chocolate and even less coffee from the roasted malt bill. The body is even bolder than I expected for a typical brown ale so there is no problems there. I had a small sample of this and I could of went for more easy. Delicious off the tap."
"Notes: One heck of a Big Brown Ale. Looking forward to my remaining two Voodoo beers and then to seek out the two that I do not have: Big Black Voodoo Daddy and Black Magick."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful caramel and roasted malt scent as well as some hop aroma in there as well. The taste is decent. I like the concept here; a big malty beer with a shit ton of hops to boot, but it's a bit scattered and unbalanced. It's a very bitter brown with excellent malt character. I almost wish it wasn't so hoppy. Anyway, it's bold and in your face. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a full bodied beer with too much CO2. I can't say Les Claypool and the boys wouldn't like this beer, but it's like their music, some love it, but most can't stand it. I'm somewhere in the middle."
"Of course I had to Blip Big Brown Beaver by Primus Wynona's"
"Pretty drinkable, I like this one. A solid beer."
"trade via jwc215"
"Good complex beer."
"Drinkability: As you can tell, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. I like dry roasted Ales and this one was all about the roasted flavors. Sometimes this beer did get a little too nutty. If you like your Brown Ales heavy on the roasted nuts and slightly sour from all the roasted flavors, then you'll definitely like this beer. Hell, this beer was worth the money just by writing that the label shows a woman riding a big brown beaver. You'll get chuckles when you tell people that."
"Had again in 2010 fest and it was a lot better. An attack of hops and then sweetness overwhelms."
"very good to drink so far the best brown ale I've had"
"It's easy to make a malty beer, but this is an example of a well crafted, deftly blended malt-bomb with a distinct complexity. The hops bring in just enough to let you know that balance isn't utterly abandoned, just biased. It's rocking a beat of alcohol but it still goes down smooth and clean. Finding this in front of me will always bring a knowing grin to my face."
"HV"
"Drinkability: nice flavorful beer that several pints can be consumed in a session. I enjoyed two bombers in one evening with interest level high at the start and the end."
"A big thumbs up to this big brown ale."
"Super high carbonation off the pour, there was a 3:1 ratio of foam to beer initially. The beer was quite dark with a mahogany hue and the overly generous cap was fluffy and tan. Clumpy, sticky lacing with great head retention. Lots of maltiness in the aroma, caramel with a little bit of dark grains, mild chocolate, more burnt than roast, with just a hint of smoke. Hops stayed in the background, but were definitely present. Solid bitterness both from hops and a little from the dark grain. Malty without being overly sweet, but with plenty of caramel and toffee throughout. Sour cherry became a bit overpowering towards the end as it warmed. Some bitter chocolate. Seemed a little unfocused with the flavours not completely in sync. Lingering cherry and burnt malt, light smoke. Carbonation was way too high. Slight dry astringency from the dark grains. The body felt lighter than it should due to the carbonation. Certainly an odd beer. Although the aroma was very promising, the flavour didn't hold together that well and the overcarbonation was a problem for the overall texture and drinkability."
"This is a nice brown ale that is on the roastier, darker side of the style spectrum, with a nice nutty character mixing in and a nice amount of balance. Had the second half with some roast beef - worked nicely with the charred edges and medium-rare juiciness of the meat."
"Pours a very nice dark brown color, very nice carbonation, very nice thick, creamy, one-finger tannish head, which leaves some nice thick/creamy sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, nice roastiness, toffee/caramel. The taste is malty, slightly bitter, roasty, with nice notes of toffee/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, Thanks Joe."
"D: pretty good, a nice dark roasted brown that packs a big but smooth dark roasted bitterness. Worthy."
"I am a sucker for a big, flavorful brown ale and this one does the trick big time."
"Drinkability/Notes: This beer needs some QA done at the brewery. Way overcarbonated. The carbonation really does the beer a disservice because I think there is a pretty decent beer somewhere in my glass. It has some nice qualities, chocalte, roasted dark malt, citrusy hops but the carbonation issue almost ruins it. You really need to let this one warm up a bit as well to really get a good feel for it. Worth a try? I don't know, would like to try it again if Voodoo gets a handle on carbonation."
"Drinkability: If it weren't for the overcarbonation, this would be a fine drinker"
"We got a gusher here. Pours dark brown with a ruby hue and a massive tan head. Nose is muted. Flavor is very hearty. Lots of malty goodness and some roasted aspects in there as well. Feel is nice. Drinkable, yes. The over-carbonation definitely is a kill-joy as it takes a long time to get this thing to settle where you can take a sip of it. Nice and robust though."
"Murky dark almost black brown appearance. Huge head that forces you to pour this one over 5 minutes or so. Once it's in the glass the head sustains nicely and forms crater like mounds and lumps. Smell of faint chocolate and somehow a chalky note. Mild citrus hop notes but very faint. Taste is what it is. Malty, little bit of chocolate. Chalky off taste. A little thin on the mouthfeel that may be caused by the huge carbonation level and the airy feel that gives. I see potential in these beers but they aren't quite there yet."
"Yeah. This one tastes a heck of a lot like the pilzilla. Golly. Must be the yeast or some other funkiness in the brewery. Only the pilzilla is a lager, isn't it? Whatever. Let me try another one or two from the brewery before deciding if they all have that same flavor to them... Still... Pretty unbalanced. Fizzy. Way too much chocolate. Like... It's like... Well, it's like homebrew - the first time brewing a recipe (before you tweak it). That chocolate would surely mellow with age but I'm not keeping this one around long enough for anything like that to happen..."
"Drinkability: Extremely enjoyable. I recommend everyone give it a try. Some will moan about the cost, but given how big this beer is, I felt it was well worth it. Additionally, drinking the beer slowly allows the beer to warm which only improves the ability to enjoy its complexity. (4.5)"
"Overall- Aside from some serious over carbonation, this was a definite sipper! Another good beer from Voodoo."
"Bottom line.. not sure if I just got an overly carbonated bottle or if all are like this, but after allowing to sit it was a very tasty brew."
"D: Pretty good. Definitely a ""big"" brown ale, though."
"When VooDoo by Rusted Root came on Sirius I knew it was time to get down with the brown. Glad I did."
"D - A nice brown ale with an assertive roasty character. Nice drinkability. I dont know what the ABV is on this but it doesnt drink like a beer over 6%."
