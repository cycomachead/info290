"Nothing really stands out about this one. I'm not tasting any oak barreling. It's OK. My nephew sent me a bunch of these 3 months ago as part of an NFC championship wager. At the time I really liked em . now It's more like, ""What was I thinking ? "" This last one was sitting in my fridge waiting for me to review it. Perhaps it went bad?"

"Dark brown in color with plenty of light seeping through when held up to the light.  A moderate amount of minute sediment is suspended within the body.  A fingernail of off white to light beige foam covers the vast majority of the top.  Light Brussels lacing.  Aroma is of chocolate, hazelnut and dark malt.  The flavor is muted than the nose would indicate.  It is mostly dark malt and hazelnut.  I do detect a hint of the sweet bourbon in the aftertaste.  The mouth is dry and sticky."

"12 oz stubby poured into rocks glass. Mostly clear brown body with red highlights and a tan head. Some retention and a bit of patchy lace. Barrel notes of bourbon and vanilla, roasty and caramel malts, a touch of chocolate. Taste is bready with caramel and roasted nuts, some vanilla and cocoa powder. A good balance between these sweet and bitter components. Medium body, moderate carbonation, creamy texture, bitter oak and roast finish."

"O- It's alright. A bit different than the other stuff on the market, but really nothing exceptional."

"Murky brown with a nice foamy head.  Nice nutty malt smell with just a hint of the barrel smell.  Taste is normal malty nutty with a hop finish.  I catch on to the vanilla which blends well with the bourbon.  I am not a fan of this style, but I like this combination.  This company keeps surprising me.  The finish is extremely smooth.  Do I detect cinnamon?"

"this is better than its ratings. people should know, that according to the label only a portion of this beer was actually aged in bourbon barrels, then blended in, so its intentionally subtle, and i for one like and respect that approach to this. its got all the vanilla and bourbon character you could want in the finish, but it doesnt dominate the whole experience. it lets all the chocolate malt and a hint of coconut come out. lighter in color than expected, it is indeed a brown, not anything darker, and the roast profile is moderate at best. i like its lightness though, and think it shows another side of the bourbon barrel thing, which is the complimentary flavors of the spirit and the chocolate malt. its so often lost to the oak itself or the heavy roast or the alcohol content, and i think this beer does a nice job with all elements together. a little more body would be alright by my, but the carbonation is nice and the finish is appropriately long and mellow. its a little something different, and i like that."

"Not really brown this pours a more auburn like color. The nose is a light divide between barrel and brown. I catch some barley malt, chocolate malt, creamy coconut, vanilla and brownie batter. The flavor is light and the feel a bit thin but it tastes quite good. Coconut is prominent with chocolate malts, brownie, light vanilla, butterscotch and an oak wood. Not a bad choice when looking for a cheaper barrel aged beer."

"Pours a clear brown.  1/4 inch head of an off-white.  Good retention and great lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, hops, hint of roasted malt, hint of biscuit, hint of pine, and a hint of alcohol.  Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation.  Fits the style of an American Brown Ale.  Tastes of sweet malt, slight caramel malt, hops, hint of pine, hint of alcohol, hint of liquor, and a hint of wood.  Overall, decent appearance, good aroma, good blend, and good complexity."

"The beer is a beautiful mahogany hue with tinged of russet and ruby. Small beige head. Aromas include oak, bourbon, wet wood, vanilla. Light sweetness with a gentle bourbon character and vanilla. Perhaps toasted almond cookies with a splash of chocolate and brown sugar. Thin body with fairly low carbonation. Lots of flavor packed into a <6% abv brew. Tasty."

"Not a world beater as far as a bourbon aged beer goes, as it is lacking the complexity of the best ones. Still, there is a decent amount of flavor, and it goes down very easy. This is my first offering from this brewery, and not a bad first try."

"Descent brown ale. Not the most complex I have had but still pretty tasty. Would pair well with caramel-pecan French toast."

"Pours a slightly reddish brown with about 1/2 inch head, nice lacing.  Smell is a muted caramel with hints of vanilla and just the slightest bourbon.  Taste is very Scottish ale like, not much bourbon at all (which I like).   Overall I really enjoy this beer, it is smooth with subtle flavors that make it immensely drinkable."

"Medium bodied with light carbonation. There is an earthy malt aftertaste, with a hint of Bourbon. Not bad, but nothing special either."
""
"It's worth trying - decent to good."
""
""
"Trying the Rocky's Revenge from Tyranena Brew Co....the beer pours a nice clear brownish amber with thin slightly off-white head that is not leaving much of a lace. Dealing with congestion right now so the scent for me is faint....certainly the presence of biscuit/bread. The taste carries maple syrup, touches of oak, and bourbon. The mouthfeel is full in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a good easy going beer."

"This marks another beer from Tyranena that I enjoy. I'm not normally a brown ale fan, but this had flavor aplenty. If they made an imperial version of this with 8-10% ABV as a winter warmer or Christmas beer, it would be off the hook."

"overall - nice, drinkable brown ale, but nothing too special"

"O - With such a mild ABV for a barrel aged brew (at least partially), the main knock here is that it is not terribly complex, sort of a two-note of malt and barrel.  The barrel is out front in the nose, the malt in the taste.  This was a go-to brew for me for several years, and I still come back, though I've found other browns that satisfy and offer greater depth."
"Mouthfeel: This tends to be a bit on the thin side compared to others I have had but still a good version of a brown ale."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good but nothing incredible, seemed fairly well executed but I think the style just isn't a great fit for a bourbon barrel. I would drink it again."
""
"Final Thoughts: Yet another interesting beer from a brewery I'm just beginning to discover. Tyranena never ceases to intrigue with their offerings. Would I drink it again? Maybe on-tap."
""
"O: A subtle bourbon beer and one that's perfect for enjoying a couple of pints of--which is different for a bourbon-forward beer; the flavors complement each other nicely--nice beer"
""
""
""
""
"There are some really great things going on here, but there's also just too much of a metallic presence coming in and out to allow this to reach its full potential. If the metallic aspect were gone, this would get a score bump of a full point."

"Rocky's Revenge pours a brownish color with a small lacing head. Their is a oaky aroma, with a nice malty backbone, and hints of coffee. The taste has a nice malty backbone, with hints of oak, and coffee. Nice full flavors, just a weak carbonation. Overall a nice flavorful brown ale."

"O - Not a bad beer at all...pretty decent American brown ale if not overwhelming. Bourbon notes are mild - very mild. If I didn't read it on the bottle I might attribute the flavors to something else. A slightly fuller body and turning the dial up on the bourbon a click or two would do wonders for this beer. Glad to have picked this up on a recent trip to the midwest."

"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It starts off a bit awkward and then the barrel presence comes into play which is nice. However, this brew doesn't seem to come all the way around and form a cohesive package. I am not that impressed with this but it isn't a terrible brew by any regards."
""
""
""
"O- Nothing special. A pretty easy drinking beer despite some acidic and astringent flavors. The beer could have benefitted from a fuller body and a greater balance. Definitely hoping for some more bourbon from a bourbon beer."
""
""
""
""
"overall this is a nice bba porter. sweet, malty, and not too overwhelming on the bourbon. honestly, pretty sessionable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty much as described, as standard Brown Ale with bourbon, which elevates the good, but not great, base beer. Nice to see bourbon used for a lower alcohol beer."
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a really good BA brown ale; the bourbon comes through but doesn't dominate it, and give the taste a lot of vanilla and sweetness. Lots of flavor and easy to drink, would love to have this one again."
"Huge disappointment. The bourbon flavor completely overwhelms the beer. I would suggest a bolder brown ale base to this beer. I have to give them props, I love a good Brown ale, and bourbon could definitely jive with the style, I just don't know if there is a brown up to the task."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice!"
""
"O - I am a big fan of the bourbon barrel-aged beers and was looking for a little more bourbon here. The color and the scent made me optimistic, but the taste and mouth-feel left me feeling as flat as this ale."
""
""
""
""
"Tyranena Brewing Rocky's Revenge ---4/5."
"O: An interesting effort. No bourbon character despite the advertisement. Very vanilla but not a complex flavor. Mediocre effort overall."
""
""
""
""
"O-Had at a tailgate and I finally found it to do a formal review, a solid brew. Nothing amazing but I just enjoy drinking this beer."
""
""
""
"O: Not impressed, not bad but probably would not drink again. Besides the poor carbonation and muddled flavors it was not bad."
""
"Pours almost cola brown with burnt orange highlights and a modest off-white head that soon recedes, leaving a thin layer of froth on the surface. Aroma smells mildly of brown sugar and milk chocolate, with a touch of alcoholic heat. The flavor is a blend of both caramel and roasted malt, with a solid hop presence and a noticeable oaky, bourbon accent. The sweetness is most present up front before being subdued by the hops. The bourbon presents most prominently in the finish. Some black coffee can be detected as well. This beer has a number of elements working for it as far as the taste is concerned, but the downside is there is not a great deal of cohesiveness, as each aspect appears to assert itself in sequence as opposed to in a balanced blend. The carbonation may be a shade too prickly as well. Don't get me wrong, as this is still a very drinkable brown ale, but it lacks some polish that could elevate it to the next level."
""
""
"Rockys revenge poured a murky brown with some ruby highlights with about a 1.5 finger head. It smelled of sweet malt with a little vanilla. The taste was just like it smelled. Malty sweet with vanilla notes. Not much bourbon taste though. There was some alcohol heat but not much. I was expecting more barrel flavor, but was let down. It's not a bad brew, but it could have been much more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall- Bottom line is that it is a very blase beer with not a lot going on. Would I rather have it then a Miller Lite? Yes, but would I rather have it then a PBR? No!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Overall a nice blended brown ale. 40% barrel aged mixed back to the original base. It is easy drinking and lower ABV, but always tasty. Great beer to drink drink in the fall months."
"Overall: One of the best beers I had on my recent trip out west. I love the complexity and there is a bit of a taste of coconut that really makes this stand apart. This one reminds me almost of a good candy bar mixed with beer--may not sound good but is fantastic. This would be a regular staple in my fridge if I could get it here. Fantastic beer."
""
""
"Rocky's Revenge is a refreshing surprise. Brown ales are far from my go to style, but I like to drink them from time to time; this one seemed interesting, so I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did. I think the portion-aged is key with this one; the barrel adds depth and integrated layers."
"O: an alright beer overall, tbough nothing apecial. It's a bit too simplistic and undercarbonated."
""
""
""
"O: The bourbon level reached with the partial blend was good, but I didn't really like the beer itself too much. Sort of a flat brown."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T,M. The flavor has a more mild bourbon level than the nose would indicate. Dry caramel malt and nuts get joined up with the gentle bourbon tones and some milk chocolate tones with the finish allowing the nutty tones to dance on the palate nearly solo long after the bourbon has faded out. Body is somewhat thinner and spritzier than expected, carbonation is slightly sluggish for the flavors."
""
""
""
"Appearance is brown with close to finger of auburn head. It has a smell of malts, toffee and bourbon. Taking a sip of this and I taste vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, some roasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium, a dry finish to it, some of the sweetness lingers too. A more interesting brown ale than most others in my opinion and one that is certainly enjoyable."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good- creamy but still light enough to drink easy. I'd be happy to work through several bottles."
"D - Very good beer; I like the whole brown nut bourbon barrel aged concept; could use a little more bourbon taste"
""
"Different, and while the barrel aging adds a nice dynamic to a style that can be hit or miss for me, but still, not the best brown I've had."
"Overall - I've been a huge fan of Tyranena ever since I tried their Painted Pumpkin Ladies ale last year, and decided to stop in Lake Mills as I moved to Chicago this past weekend. I was very impressed by Rocky's Revenge and even bought a 6 pack there just so I could take it with me. I love Tyranena's beers and I look forward to even more of their offerings in the future!"
""
""
"The feel was pretty good, medium body and carbonation, somewhat smooth and creamy. But I can’t say it was particularly enjoyable or tasty or that I’d seek this one out again."
""
"O: I'm rating this a bit high just because I really like the idea of a beer that gets some good bourbon, oak, tannins in at a moderate abv and in a 12oz format to boot. These give the beer a pretty damn good ""drinkability", even if it isn't such a great example of a brown ale or a barrel aged beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It's a good malty beer that got the most out of the bourbon flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M/O - Body is a little light for me but carbonation is done well. Clears from the palate sort of quickly but leaves a dim bourbon flavor. Very easy to drink and a light sipper. I paid $2 for a 12oz bottle and hard to find something else as good for that price."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad brown ale. Quite nutty and toasty with just a hint of bourbon."
"Pours a dark chocolate brown color, with a decent beige head on top. The aroma is fairly common for a brown ale, with a lightly sweet and nutty malt base, some light milk chocolate characteristics, and only a slightest hint of the bourbon addition. The flavor is largely more of the same, but the bourbon contribution is much greater, especially as the beer warms, with a woodsy, smokey whiskey character that creeps into the flavor at first before overtaking the finish. The texture is a bit thin and watery and doesn't prop up the flavors like it should. Overall, this one is a pleasant, mild brown ale with a bit of a twist that is interesting enough to make you want to try it the first time, but it is not so interesting to want go back again often."
""
"I really am not a fan of most Brown Ales but having a portion aged in bourbon barrels took this to another level. It was just enough to give it some depth of flavor without going overboard into a bourbon-bomb; not that there is anything wrong with that but for this beer it worked well not to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- It's alright, and worth trying, but I had a tough time finishing the 12 oz., and I don't think I'd try it again. Flavor-wise, it's actually quite good, but if you're looking for a brown with a rich bourbon palate, I'd look elsewhere."
""
""
"An interesting take on a brown ale. It's a little boozy for my tastes - I think the bourbon overpowers the rest of the beer. But it's pretty good despite that."

"So I've noticed a weird thing happens when you bourbon barrel age a lighter <8% beer. The bourbon seems to take on a new character that is not always great flavoring. This is interesting, but not great, not nearly what I expected it to be. Still tasty and drinkable, some nice bourbon characteristics, some weird ones too esp aroma, nice brown sugar and molasses, caramel, toffee, etc, a nice brown ale, but just too weird."
""
""
""
"12 oz into a Duvel tulip...should be interesting because American brown ales are definitely not a favorite of mine and I don't really like bourbon barrel beers. Appearance is a rich reddish brown with a goodly sized head. Tons of bourbon in the nose, but not sickly sweet like some beers that emerge from a bourbon barrel. Balanced. Lots of bourbon on the tongue too and a refreshing medium malt backbone. Mouthfeel is excellent. Recommended. Within the confines of the style, this is an excellent beer."

"All in all, heartbreakingly close to great, but still pretty darn good."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Not a great one, but a good one."
"O: Very nicely done, balanced and a bourbon drinkers best friend."
"When I buy a bourbon barrel brown ale, guess what I want? Not this fucking beer."
"O- This is a nice, basically average beer, glad I was able to try it, wish I could try more from the brewery, as it is I need to rely on traveling friends to bring more my way."
"Pours a deep brown with minimal head and retention. Smell is mostly nuts with some roasted notes and just a hint of bourbon. Mouthfeel is creamy and mildly thick, mild carbonation although I don't know how old the bottle is. Taste is roasted nuts followed by a very subtle bourbon sweetness. I really like the balance on this. Finishes fairly dry and sweet with some hop bitterness. Overall, interesting brown ale concept executed well. Would drink this again."
"Probably should have had this fresher, but still good none the less."
"Had on tap at the UofC pub. Very rich dark brown with a beige head that faded quickly and the smell of, well, bourbon. The taste is nice--nutty, cocoa, dark roast and drying figs and wood, all with a smooth undertow of bourbon. It's smooth and silky and the bourbon is obviously present without being overdone."
"This beer makes an excellent intro for those getting into the bourbon aged beer trend. It is not an overwhelming bourbon flavor, but it is accessible and very tasty."
"Overall : this was a good beer overall. I would definitely would like to have another one"
"While certainly not perfect, Rocky's Revenge is an enjoyable, medium-bodied beer that is smooth, drinkable, and complex enough for the palate to appreciate. A brew I will enjoy again."
"On the pour and smell I wasn't so interested in this beer. It looked a little placid and flattish, and the smell was very much a generic-brown smell with a slight kick. The taste though, packed a pleasant surprise. A nicely concentrated generic brown taste profile makes up the core but there's a great bourbon aspect and an unexpected floralness to the beer. Very sessionable with strong, unusual, and well-integrated flavors. Would knock out a six pack of this pretty easily and very happily."
"O-for such a bourbon taste when I first opened the bottle I was amazed at how it disappeared after breathing for just a few minutes if you like the bourbon my advice is drink it quick"
"O-Wow, a great BA beers that gets no love. Very smooth and subtle but flavorful"
"O: a good brown ale, and the bourbon seems to be a nice added touch, very likable!!"
"Cheers!"
"I am conflicted with this beer, because I am not sure how to feel about it and maybe that's because of how I normally envision barrel aged beers (ie. thick, black as night, and boozy as hell) so when I encounter a beer like this my balance is thrown off and I think, maybe if I had the opportunity to review some lower ABV barrel aged beers the rating might change, but until that day comes the beer gets the rating it gets."
"Pretty good beer. I was given an outstanding recommendation not sure if I agree."
"Poured maple brown with no head. Aroma is of oxidation, rather dull and weak. Not much to speak of here. Slight fruitiness in the flavor and a bit of caramel. Body is light and slick with a bit of carbonation. This is a perfect example of a beer that isn't offensive, but simply boring. Bland and boring. I couldn't find any hint of bourbon at all in here. Unveiling of the beer left us scratching our heads."
"I enjoyed this beer. Have never had a brown ale with bourbon barrel aging. I would have liked a bit more bourbon flavor."
"D/O- Drinks bigger than 6%abv. While bourbon beers are generally alright with this guy, this one just didn't tickle my fancy. It wasn't overpowering, just showed more than I would have liked in a ""sessionable"" beer. Better browns out there."
"O: I was really happy with this one. I've been trying a lot of bourbon-aged ales lately, and this one is up in my top 3. Very well done. I'd be happy drinking this one again and again. In fact, I just might."
"Overall - For an American Brown Ale, it's a very good example of complexity and something interesting/a bit different from the norm. For my overall I think it's just above average. 3.5 for this one. Definitely worth a try if you like the style or Bourbon or both or if you're just looking for a complex drinkable beer."
"O- Pretty decent beer. I could definitely throw back a few of these. Another good brew by Tyranena."
"Edit: Now that my nose and pallet are growing, I smell vanilla, and it has a slight vanilla on the pallet as well. I like this better now than I did before. I'm changing the smell, taste, and overall to a 3.5 and apparently I did buy this dude again. It is now my favorite go to beer. Whoda thunk it?"
"Tyranena has better beers, specifically the Bitter Woman IPA. This is not bad, but I was hoping for something better. It pours a nice brown color, pretty much what I expected. Not much head. It has a really sweet wang to it. It's not terrible though. It is a very malty beer, not much hops flavor, not that I would expect that. I wonder if it really has bourbon...hmmmm."
"Overall: Tasty, unoffensive, and sessionable. Balance leans toward malt. Would have liked a bit more body and flavor, but, again, not a bad beer."
"O: Decent, but brown ales don't really benefit from a barrel really. Still has a slight hint of alcohol. Plenty of fruits on this - indicating to me that the beer wouldn't age particularly well. This is a good attempt, but theres something missing. At 6% abv, the beer doesn't really hold up."
"O: Good, tasty beer. Would definitely try again soon if I can find it on tap again. Tried at Il Gatto during happy hour in Minneapolis. The coffee notes/tastes surprised me and the bourbon (toned down from full bourbon taste unlike other bourbon beer I've had) was pleasant."
"M,O: Wonderfully drinkable bourbon aged beer. I wish there were more beers of this strength put into a barrel. A brewery closer to home has to make a beer of this ilk."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I wouldn't seek this out in the future. It was okay, but there are plenty of other browns worth drinking over this one. If the bourbon had been a bit more prominent, it might have taken a little step forward, but it wasn't."
"The CPJ"
"O: well balanced brown ale with nice flavor. The blending provides some of what I love about bourbon aged beers, but everything stays light and drinkable"
"Overall, worth a try. Flavors really seem to change as it warms."
"Overall was very average, the beer itself isn't enough to stand up to the barrel aging and it dominates the flavor to a very large degree."
"Drinkability is pretty good, I really like the bourbon barrel treatment on the brown-ale, notable in that both the beer and the barrel are both more restrained then usual, which makes it satisfying without punishing! Yum, I might have to have another."
"Ultimately, the biggest issue I had with this beer is that the style just couldn't stand up to the barrel, and the flavors it imparted. Nevertheless, this was an enjoyable beer, and paired to a stronger base, it could have been great."
"EDIT: I had a bottle that had aged for about 6 months and I drank it because I figured this was a beer that didn't age well and needed to be drank before it went bad. I actually thought many of the flavors were more pronounced now especially the bourbon. I will have to pick up another six pack and compare a fresher one to this one that was a little older."
"NOT A MUST HAVE, BUT STILL SOLID!"
"The mouthfeel was thinner than I expected. There was a decent amount of carbonation."
"Overall: This is a very tasty, sweet treat. There is a lot of great flavours here and the bourbon is used in moderation: enough to give character, but not too much. A nice little beer."
"Maybe my mistake with this brew was starting off with Tyranena's brewer's gone wild series and Down n' Dirty stouts, both fantastic in their own ways. This brown ale, on the other hand, not so much."
"D: Pretty darn drinkable. The alcohol is hidden very well and despite not being quite what I had hoped for, it has some nice characteristics and is pretty well balanced. Overall, it goes down pretty easily and I'd have another if I had another bottle."
"D:Over all a good beer, and im not a fan of brown ales, or a big tyranena fan! the only fault would be that only part of the beer is aged in bourbon barrels...hum...maybe they sould save some and age IT in bourbon barrels!"
"It seems Rocky has had his Revenge. On my palate."
"3.5 D: Not a bad beer, but I'm not sure that the bourbon barrels added anything. I prefer the bourbon components to supplement an already tasty beer, but in this case, the bourbon isn't even a player."
"Pours an orangish red. Not much head dissipates quickly. Smells a bit oaky and vanilla heavy. Tastes not so strong. The vanilla is pretty prominent on the tongue as well. The brown ale flavours come through in the back of the tongue. Overall, interesting and fairly drinkable"
"Overall, kind of a disappointment from Tyranena. It would have been nice if they had aged this longer in bourbon barrels. I think they sacrificed the bourbon flavors for drinkability."
"D - This is a very enjoyable beer, but I feel a little shortchanged because I want more bourbon. I don't know anyone who wants to play just the tip/hint of bourbon, do you? Give me some more damn bourbon! That said, these are easy to drink, tasty and quite affordable, will buy again."
"I hate being so negative in reviews,but I really can't rave about or recommend this. Incredibly average offering. One would be fine but I'm stuck with five more."
"If I want this taste, I'll just make a bourbon and water."
"D - this is a reasonably drinkable beer. The long I spend with with it, the more I notice and odd dry sweetness that doesn't make me want this beer in my mouth. But it has a nice mild warming finish, and that's good."
"D - Good, easy drinking, with lots of flavors. Pretty good."
"D - I'm not very excited and probably wouldnt go out of my way to drink this again."
"Overall- This used to be one of my favorites, but my pallate has since expanded. I like it every now and again, but there are better bourbon influenced beers and this has a fairly thin body."
"Drinkability: For an American Brown Ale, this is about as good as they come. No doubt time and care was put into this brew, compliments to the brewer on a job well done. Got this from a friend who traveled to Wisconsin and its sad I never would had heard of it otherwise."
"Overall I really like this beer, it's one of my ""go to's"" for something darker with a nice flavor and not too expensive. It could benefit from a little more body and a stronger scent but it's still a great beer."
"D - I'm pouring this down the sink after I finish typing this. If you are going to attempt bourbon aging, do it right."
"I got a six pack of this from a nearby grocery store called Green Grocer in Chicago with tons of regional (Midwest) brews. This beer is a perfect combination of bourbon strength (pure alcohol taste) and a brown roast malt taste. It is not as strong as other bourbon beers, which makes it even better."
"Not bad drinkability, but not something I'll be likely to revisit since there are brown ales out there that I much prefer."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are good. I would have no problem drinking a few of these any time of year. Could make an interesting BBQ beer."
"D - I will definitely pick this one up again in the future. Its hard to say if the Bourbon notes in the finish may get a bit trying after 2-3 of these, so I am just going to have to buy a 6 pack and find out for certain."
"D - Very hard to do this one justice with poetic waxing; you've just got to drink it."
"The mouthfeel is characterized by low carbonation and a medium body. Some lingering sweetness, whisky and water end the experience. This beer falls short of the mark for me, but is still much better than many brown ales out there."
"Very nice, deep copper color-some killer lacing on the glass as it goes down. Somewhat nutty, decent malty aroma. very solid malt flavor. Nice touch of toasted malt going on. Enough of a barrel aged flavor but not overwhelmingly so. Mild malt sweetness. Nice body and a damn easy drinkability. Could be a nice session beer even at 6% for this kid. One of the better browns I have had. Yummy..."
"This pours a dark brown but still translucent. The aroma is malty, slightly sweet, a bit of caramel and a hint of bourbon. The taste is exactly like what this is, brown beer with a taste of bourbon from the aging. This beer is an American brown ale with a portion aged in bourbon barrels."
"Pours brown with a bit of an off white head. The pint shows a bit of lacing on the way down. Nose brings brown sugar, caramel, bourbon, and some sweet malt. The taste is somewhat sweet with some boozy bourbon notes and some light caramel and bread. A bit of a nutty characteristic. Medium body with good carbonation and integration. Drinks quite well and is a nice low ABV brown ale, considering all that goes into it."
"D: An easy drinking brew. but flavor make it a bit hard to finish or even consider coming back to."
"D - ultra drinkable most drinkable BA beer ive ever had, gulpable"
"Vigorous pour yields 2 fingers of dark tan head. Beer is a medium reddish brown. I smell slight alcohol, a very little bourbon, some sweet caramel malts and faint hops. I taste sweet malts, a little hop and slight green apple in the middle and very little bourbon. The barrel taste is present, just not overwhelming or in your face like most. Has a nice finish. Feels a little watery for this style, but drinkability is pretty good as it goes down smooth."
"Toasted malt and nuts briefly up front. Big caramel and light maple syrup sweetness quickly follow. Bourbon and fruit mid-palate, with notes of vanilla and oak. Light tannin bitterness in the finish. Lingering caramel and bourbon. Medium-bodied, with lushly carbonated, smooth feel. A touch on the sweet side, but the bourbon and wood notes help balance it out. Delicious!"
"D: I see why so many people I've talked too when I bring up Tyranena mention this beer first as sort of their bridge beer. This is a damn fine brown ale....I'll go out on a limb and say it is one of the best."
"I had to snatch this away before it was sniped by a buddy of mine. (Don't get me wrong, sharing is awesome, but I wanted this bottle for my very own.) It pours a dark ruby-tinted brown topped by half-finger of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises oak, bourbon, dark wheat, and some watered-down roasted malts, with a kick of alcohol looming in the background. The taste lightens the bourbon, adds a healthy helping of walnuts and greens, and continues the watering-down of the roasted malts. The body is medium, with a light carbonation and a liquid-y feel. Overall, a decently solid bourbon brown, but it falls a bit too short for me to really get excited about it."
"This cloudy brown ale I'd never seen nor heard of, but it packs a wicked punch. Starting with the endearingly cool ""sea monster"" bottle art with local legend on the label doesn't hurt. But what matters most is the taste, and ""Rocky's Revenge"" hit me straight away with a strong nutty, hoppy kick. There's some chocolate notes, too, most definitely, but none of the coffee-like tones of a porter. It's sweet and malty, but, like, heavy, man. A real winner and a unique beer."
"A great beer all around. The thick brown appearance is crucial. Just the right amount of head. Smells malty. Taste of nut and has wonderful mouthful feeling. Great tasting for a drinkablity to go along at any event. Would recommend this beer to the casual beer drinker for a good time."
"Based on my expectations, I was slightly disapointed. The description just sounded so good to me. But, this was still a very good beer, and a unique twist to an american nut brown. Very enjoyable."
"drinkability is good. for those that like bourbon barrel flavor, this is a good alternateive to high ABV BA stouts."
"Overall a solid beer from Tyranena. Maybe not quite sessionable but damn close."
"Very tasty, can't have too much though."
"Light while being satisfying on the tongue; very drinkable. Barrel aging came through later in the pint, perhaps as it warmed. The bottle says ""potions"" were barrel aged: I'm wondering if there are new and barrel aged beers mixed for bottling? I've got to wonder what all barrel-aged beer would taste like!"
"D: Still can't believe this has been in bourbon barrels - now I understand everyone's statements on this being one of the most drinkable bbl aged beer out there. Smooth and easy drinking brown ale."
"D- This brown ale is very good. There is a certain non-barrel age flavor to it but the ABV on this doesn't make this beer less drinkable. I'm not the biggest brown ale fan but Tyranena makes one that I have a hard time putting down!"
"D: Very tasty. I really enjoy this. Good flavor, nice finish, well rounded."
"Overall a touch underwhelming. I've had this in the bottle many times and seemed to have more heft. Still drinkable."
"I really liked this beer, but it isn't for someone who is looking for a little bit of beer with their bourbon. Instead, the bourbon is subtle. It is used as a background flavor to add another dimension to a malty American Brown Ale."
"Pours a reddish brown with a one-finger head that settled to a frothy coating that lasted. There was decent lacing throughout. Nose was maple, vanilla, bourbon, molasses, and caramel. The taste included some oak, vanilla, caramel malt, molasses, and brown sugar. The finish is sweet with some alcohol tinge. The moutfeel is on the light side of medium, decent carbonation, creamy and a little sticky. This wasn't a bad beer but not one I would go out of my way to have again."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a DFH goblet, the beer pours mostly brown with a tinge of red, along with a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is roasted malt, brown sugar and toffee, along with some nuts and molasses. I don't notice any bourbon at all in the aroma, but it's still a nice smelling brew. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there is a little bit of a woody/oak taste too. But with a beer that's partially aged in bourbon barrels, I expected more bourbon to be noticable in both the aroma and taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK enough. I think it's a solid, but not impressive overall brew, it's certainly worth a try."
"This is fairly drinkable. A little more bitter than I expect in a Brown Ale, which would be fine if the bourbon was more prevalent, but it's not, it's subtle."
"Tyranena doesn't seem to make a bad beer in my experience so far. Wish we could get these here in TX."
"M/D: Creamy. Medium to light body. Silky soft carbonation. It does seem a bit thin though. Decent drinkability. I would get tired after 2 or so."
"I will stick to the rest of the Tyranena line-up, which is fantastic!"
"D- It seems like the barrel aging manifested itself mostly in the mouthfeel, which isn't really where I would like it. The aroma and flavor are good, but underwhelming and not complex enough for my expectations."
"D: This beer makes a good recovery from the initial bad first impression that the nose gives. Appreciably complex yet with a nice, smooth body that helps meld the flavors together. An above average brown ale but all in all, nothing to get too crazy over. A solid offering nonetheless though."
"D-not a bad beer, light notes of bourbon but lack of any barrel, some maltiness to it but falls a little short."
"The beer pours a clear light brown color with a tan head. The aroma is grain, caramel malt and little wood. The flavor is caramel with some chocolate and toffee. I don't get much bourbon in the aroma or flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Poured into a shaker, a deep, rich reddish-brown color, with a nice cap of light brown foam. Nice nutty aromas, along with milk chocolate and just a hint of oak. The alleged bourbon barrel aging is not all that noticeable, as this tastes (after 3 bottles) exactly like any other good brown ale--nutty, slightly chocolately and a little bit sweet."
"M/D: It has a mild/moderate carbonation. It seems a little watery. It isn't a bad beer, just not really what I expected. I was hoping for a little more. Guess I'll just have to try the chipotle porter next..."
"Overall, I was a little disappointed ! Still a great beer and now that I can get it in Indy I'm sure I will be drinking plenty of this quality brew."
"I have to say this is one of the Best Brown's I've had and a breath of fresh air to a style that is generally pretty much a snoozer."
"D - Rocky's Revenge is certainly a beer that merits regular revisits. It's one of the top American brown ales I've tasted and it must be close to Bender for tops in the region."
"Drinks very well. Maybe a bit lower than a typical brown ale because of the bourbon, but I still enjoyed it and so did my wife. I will be picking up some more of this one. A very nice and unique brown ale."
"D: A very good sippin beer that is not on the heavy/""I can only drink one"" side. I would definitely buy this again if it was distribute in KY. Highly recommended, even worth seeking out."
"I like it. Its a nice brown ale with an added element that sets it apart from the crowd. Cheers!"
"D: It's an interesting brew at first, but the sweetness may seem pretty one dimensional after more then one. i think with this one hunting the Wood & Bourbon out is the game, which is hard, and leaves most dissapointed."
"D: Well, not a fan. I understand it's a bouron barrel ""blend", but just not there. Goose Island's Brown Goose kicks this brown in the ass. Won't seek this out again, Tyranene makes much better brews."
"D - I get a slight sense of oxidization and sourness with this. Perhaps its slightly infected. It wasn't offensive, but something just didn't sit right for the style. The carbonation was a little too heavy for a BA Brown Ale. I'd like to try this on tap at some point."
"D: Not so high on alcohol, but would not consider it a session beer as it settles in the stomach and the complexity of flavors. Good price for its value and would definitely recommend it for brown ale lovers"
"D: Oddly drinkable, most bourbon beers aren't blended as well as this. Not overpowering, not off the radar, compliments the beer nicely. Not filling, goes down easy, this is a damn good beer with a different take on a brown ale!"
"A bit light for a brown ale, and the bourbon character doesn't seem to fit in all that much. Not that I didn't enjoy it..."
"Drinkability:This was definitely a tasty beer. I'm kind of a sucker for BBA brews although this was only ""partially BBA'd"" keeping the vanilla like tones or anything else extremely sweet to be extracted into the brew. This was most likely a good thing because it would of probably overwhelmed this. I'd definitely recommend trying this. This will most likely find its way to my fridge again sometime soon."
"I may be extra thirsty tonight, or this beer aged somewhat well. Been sitting about three months for me, and it's tasting a lot better than the first day I cracked it. I think it says something positive about the beer that I had a GI BCS last week, and this still seems like it has a full bourbon character after that. Probably ranks up there with Ellie's Brown Ale as one of the few brown ales I'd order at a bar or think about buying packs of somewhat regularly. Excepting of course the Imperial Brown Goose, which is on another level. This is a good choice with a variety of meals, especially at Kuma's, where they have had bottles lately. This has stoked my interest in Tyranena again after I found the last couple of their brews to be misses."
"D This was a nice drink, and I will compare the taste and mouth to my (old time) favorite Guinness Draft minus the foam. I did like it and will buy it again."
"D - While this is a drinkable beer, I wish this beer would have pushed a little bit more of the envelope here, and more along with what I expected"
"D- Unique beer, and more complex than I was expecting from a twist off. Drinkable but I could not drink more than one."
"Very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is a tad fuller than medium with lots of soft carbonation. This is a very nice beer, and right up there with Surly Bender in terms of American Brown Ales."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is on the lighter side of medium. Low carbonation works well with the beers body and flavors. This was a very easy to drink beer and it left my glass far too fast. I wish I had a bunch more."
"drinkability is excellent. the brown is well balanced, and balanced well against the barrel. this is no heavy handed in-your-face bourbon barrel, more mellow and definitely at a complimentary level. look away for a moment and you may start to lose it, but it's definitely there, filling out the edges and adding a nice depth. good stuff."
"Drinkability is high for me with this beer. It isn't massive, yet has plenty to keep your interest through multiple pints. Damn, I miss being able to drink this one regularly. Also I really think this beer belongs up there with the best of the ABA's."
"I enjoyed this. I think that the fact that some of the bourbon aged beer was mixed in with fresh really helped get the flavors across without overdoing it. This was a pleasant one to sip at. I really should have grapped a six pack of this instead of just a single."
"D. This stuff is infinitely drinkable. The barrel aging is just right - imparting a nice twist to this ale. Two, three, four in a night? Wouldn't be a problem. It's nice to have access to a barrel aged beer that isn't over the top and sky high in ABV."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Body could use a bit more beef but the bourbon barrel worked great especially with the low ABV. I think I might have another!"
"Frothy and heavy, very drinkable, not quite a winter warmer and a bit high for a session-able beer, I could have several of these and be very happy."
"Poured into my conical pint glass. Pours a clear ruby-tinted brown with a small tan head on top. Little carbonation present. Smells of oak, bread, and whisps of vanilla. The mouth is creamy and smooth. This is a very pleasant sipper. The vanilla notes are more pronounced in the flavor. Big toffee, caramel and vanilla sweetness. Finishes lightly bitter. Not boozy at all, which is nice. I like the addition of the bourbon notes to this style. It's a sweeter take, but it's good. Good job Tyranena! Recommend."
"D: I'm not sure what was wrong with the first bottle I had: it was significantly less carbonated, and apparently the ""proper"" temperature suppressed many of the subtle flavors. But the second bottle is a winner. Great beer."
"Medium brown body, very clear, topped by a sand colored head. The head shows good retention and clings nicely to the sides of the glass. Aroma is mostly caramelized brown sugar, molasses, and malt sweetness with a touch of vanilla and mint. Flavor is amazingly smooth, with a surprising amount of vanilla-inflected bourbon coming through. Herbal bitterness cleans away any residual sweetness on the finish. More and more malt sweetness that again follows the caramelized, nearly burnt sugar notes form the aroma becomes more evident with subsequent sips. Mouthfeel is a bit thin; a slightly heavier body would enhance the experience. This has the components of a big beer in a slightly smaller format. Drinkability is OK. A nice, somewhat unique brown ale. Thanks to Tim at Heritage Liquors for the recommendation."
"well...bourbony, but mostly oaky. plenty of vanilla, for sure. i think the risk run by whiskeyoaking a brown ale (as opposed to a porter or stout) is that the brew may not hold up to the process. the bottle says that a ""portion"" of the batch is aged, so the brewers have acknowledged as much, but the oaking dominates the beverage. a brown ale does shine through"
"I can honestly say this is my favorite beer at the moment. This is a Wisconsin beer that I have never seen in Ohio. I would love to have this on hand all the time, unfortunately that is not possible. I strongly suggest picking this up given the opportunity. If you do not like it I will buy it off you. And if you feel the desire please BEER MAIL me this in exchange for Great lakes or something."
"D - Gets too sour for me, but starts out really nice, I like the subtlety of the bourbon on this, but it's almost to the point that I wouldn't call it a ""bourbon beer."""
"Very smooth and velvety feel to the beer. Perfect carbonation. This was one solid broubon brown. I havent had a bourbonized brown but this was certainly a wonderful beer. I havent made up my mind if I want more bourbon in the nose, but the way this one is, it tastes and smells great. Thanks Nate."
"D - Not too heavy of a bourbon style beer, seems a little too subtle. Wished it was a little stronger."
"Enjoyable beer, would gladly drink another."
"Nice brew. Easy drinking, decent."
"(D)- A straightforward but enjoyable brown ale that has a delicate creaminess to it that is rather nice. Really sweet though; more dessert- like in my opinion. Good stuff."
"D: Very drinkable, would go nicely with some foods. A good compromise also for those who do and don't like sweet beers I think."
"D: I think I could drink a lot of this if I really wanted to."
"Overall, not a bad beer. I enjoy bourbon beers so this would be a nice session as it isn't that big. However, I wish it had a little more bourbon in it."
"D - Definitely one of the best brown ales I've come across, I wish I had a six-pack at my disposal. I'll need to go get more. This would be a fantastic fall warmer on a cool, crisp night with the leaves rustling in the trees. Yeah, I really need a six-pack."
"Pours a perfectly clear amber with a brown hue on there. Head is tan. Flavor is interesting. Kind of a tangy, earthy and sour edge on there. Inky a bit too. Get a slight burn from boozy tones. A nutty edge seems to be peeking from around the corner. Feel has nipping carbonation and the liquid is thick enough. Interesting to drink. The flavors don't seem to be meshing all that well as there are some unusual things going on here. But it's not undrinkable. Interesting enough to try once I guess."
"Drinkability- Not really what I was expecting but it's hard to say that this brew doesn't go down pretty easy. It's very drinkable but I was hoping for a bit more 'potency'. Either way worth trying and a tasty brew if you're in the mood for a plain ol' Brown."
"A very good brown, and one that I will definitely be buying more of when the weather cools, but one of these in a sitting is plenty."
"Pours a dark translucent brown color with a shallow head that fades rather quickly with little lacing left behind. The smell is sweet choco-malty with a nice hint of caramel-bourbon. The visible effervescence winds down quickly, the mouth feel has a light body that is complimented nicely by the same rich caramel malt and bourbon in the nose. The sweet taste lingers nicely and finishes on the smoky side. A real nice drinker. Many thanks to maximum12 for this opportunity!"
"A brown ale with very little head, Rocky's Revenge is a sweet, malty beer that packs a pleasant bourbon barrel twist. While my score isn't too high, this is a really nice example of two styles that I normally dislike: small bourbon barrel-aged beer in normal styles and brown ales. My main criticism of the beer is only that it's all a bit mild, which is definitely unexpected. The brown ale is fairly nutty and spicy. It has a big, sweet malty backbone. I wouldn't want one every night, but it's good stuff. The bourbon barrel aging has been done with a light touch. Within its specifications on paper, I'm not sure that I would change anything. It just doesn't amount to enough for a higher score."
"D= pretty good. Based on the apperance and smell I figured I woulda hated this one but the taste is phenomonal."
"Easy drinker that is not too complex, yet still has a very good flavor."
"D- Pretty good, the bourbon isn't overpowering and it's a pretty easy-drinking beer."
"pours is amber with a off amber yellow head. an odor of caramel sweet vanilla and molasses. not particularly sweet but a very broad and one dimensional vanilla flavor. a nice vanilla none the less. surprisingly consistent for the alcohol content. bottle states ""a portion of the beer is aged in bourbon cask"". the malt mellowed out the heat of the bourbon well. a well balenced brew that doesn't forward a complex palate for whiskey lovers. this beer is simple but quite enjoyable. subtle nice and a bright autumn style. not particularly sour at this one either."
"Pours a reddish amber with sparse lacing and ok bubbling. The aroma is a lovely toasted,medium roasted malt. Combine this with a littl would and some bourbony vanilla. Simple mild roasted malts start the flavor off right. The faint bpurbon and wood add a smooth, yet soewhat grainy palate. Flavorful, subtle, and quite drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable as the flavor is nice, but that little bit of bourbon flavor and bite might keep someone from downing a ton of this...only a slight deduction there."
"D - I could session this with no difficulty"
"This beer isn't very strong by the standards of most bourbon barrel aged beers I've seen and I think that the beer would be better if it had a little more to go with the whiskey. So much boozy flavor I can almost feel my face getting red even though it's only listed at 6%. Not available anywhere near me so buying more isn't an option. Very glad I got to try it."
"D- easy to finish, and its nice to try a beer aged in bourbon thats sessionable. something ill definitely work into the rotation every so often."
"I dig this beer and would drink it regularly if I had access to it. I guess it will have to wait for trips to WI. Lucky Sconnies!"
"The appearance of thsi was pretty dark, but not completely dark. Taste has a definite bourbon flavor, but was not overpowering. Drinkability is good, probably my favorite year round Tyranena."
"It is a little light bodied which makes it easier to drink than some other, sweeter browns. Not too much sticky aftertaste on the tongue."
"Drinkability - Didn't really detect any bourbon barrel character as promised. This one falls short in a lot of areas. Not much to excite here."
"Overall: A solid brown ale. Not too heavy on the bourbon. If it's going to be advertised as a bourbon brown ale then that aspect might need to be stepped up a little. But this is a pretty solid brown. Nothing spectacular but good beer."
"(D) A good brown ale with some nice flavorings."
"This beer poured a translucent brown with a thin 1 inch head. The head died quickly and left a little lacing on the glass. The smell of bourbon is prevalent, as is caramel. I found the taste matched the smell. This beer was very thin for me and I didn't enjoy that aspect of it. Overall, this beer is a great session beer and nothing more."
"Upfront sweet malty caramel taste. Bourbon comes out but is followed/paired with wood smoke. Smooth and drinkable, hops at the end. Light, almost fizzy mouthfeel."
"Medium bodied with pretty good carbonation. An easy drinking beer."
"Overall: A very nice brown ale, but I didn't think the beer lived up to the bourbon ageing advertisement on carrier. Would purchase again if given the opportunity."
"Bottle: Poured a deep burgundy color ale with a small foamy head with average retention and great lacing. Aroma is dominated by vanilla and bourbon with some light alcohol ester also discernable. Taste is also a mix between some vanilla and some bourbon. Medium body with Ok carbonation and some alcohol was discernable. Probably one of the most complex and satisfying brown ale I ever had if you can truly categorise this beer as such."
"Flavour, Mouthfeel, Drinkability: A little caramel sweetness, round in the mouth, enough bitterness to carry it. Well done."
"This is easily the most drinkable bourbon-aged beer I've ever had; maybe too much so, since as much as I enjoyed it, I was left wanting more bourbon flavors and a bigger beer. With that caveat, it's a very tasty beer and (at least in Wisconsin) a readily available one."
"Definatly a very good Brown and I think this one is spot on for the style. I will definatly keep some of this around."
"D - I could have a few of these in the sitting, especially during the winter."
"D- This is, with the exception of the Devil over a Barrel, in my opinion, Tyranenas best beer in the lineup. It's got some nice balance of malt and the bourbon flavor. Even at 6%, this can be sessionable. Needless to say, will have again."
"Very good beer. This is my first review after a long pause, and I am not disappointed that I've chosen Rocky's Revenge."
"Good, not great. A nice change of pace from your typical brown."
"Easy drinker, pity about the smell, a nice brown otherwise.."
"Very nice and drinkable - and for a buck sixty nine a single, you can't beat it!!"
"Mouthfeel is light and thin, unimpressive."
"Tasty, but the bourbon character is quite subdued, and the base beer is a bit weak."
"Pours a dark woody brown with a silky head. Some lacing. The nose has bourbon, roasted malts, oak, vanilla and dark fruits. Quite impressive for a brown ale. The taste is a bit lighter. Mostly the same components, juts a little less impressive. Medium body is well carbonated. A very nice ale indeed. The bourbon really compiments this well."
"This feels really good in the mouth, starts out thin but really thickens up on the tongue after the first gulp. Really nice subtle carbonation. I gotta say, I really like this and could certainly drain a few."
"D: Good drinkability. A little bit underwhelming but enjoyable."
"Can you say SMOOTH?"
"Overall a very good brown ale. One of the better I've tried in the category."
"A good brown ale, but no significant contribution from the bourbon barrel aging."
"M/D - A little thin and very dry feel. A good brown ale but not a spectacular beer like so many of the other Tyranena beers I have had."
"Drinkability: A bourbon beer that is not over the top; nicely balanced"
"Pours a clear nut brown with a 2-3"" tan head. Aroma is slightly metallic but sweet malt, some toasty/roasty oak, and a hint of bourbon sweetness. Taste is straight up brown ale, some moderate bitterness, but the oak gives it a deeper, rounder, drier finish than others in its class. This one is subtle, but very solid, and probably the most drinkable barrel aged beer I've had."
"D: There is something about barrel-aged beer that gets me every time. I love that oak flavor/aroma. It makes me think, as I am sure others do as well, that the finished product is somehow more refined than other beers. Now, I know that is just bullshit, but one could say that the bourbon is imparting the beer with some of its mystical qualities. With that said, I enjoyed my six-pack."
"Pours a cloudy brown with a minimal off white head that doesn't stick around for very long but leaves some lacing on the way down. Aroma is a bit vinous, maybe I'm picking up a bit of the barrel. I smell some caramel and a little roast deep in the back. Taste is an oakey, boozy, malty affair. Finishes with a bit of bourbon and vanilla. Finished dry, medium to thin in body. Certainly an interesting brew although I think my bottle may be a bit old. I'd love to revisit this one fresh because I think it may be fantastic."
"D - a very tasty brew that's highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: This one was interesting, but not that impressive overall. Without the bourbon I think it might have been a rather bland, substandard brown ale, and the bourbon only did so much for it."
"Pours dark, dark brown with a small off-white head that dissipated to a ring fairly quickly leaving decent lacing. The aroma is great with a ton of dark fruits, raisins and grapes, and molasses on top of malt base. The bourbon is definitely present as well in the nose. The taste doesn't quite live up to the nose for me and tastes a little bit like a grape soda mixed with tea with the huge sweetness of the dark fruits. The first taste is is of sweet malts and nuts up front before giving way to the fruity sweetness and a slight bourbon burn through the finish. The finish is creamy and very carbonated which just coats the mouth. This is a good American brown, though the sweetness was a tad overwhelming for me. Still very good."
"Picked up a single of this beer and was not disappointed. Nice mix of flavors without too much of the bourbon coming through. I'll have to try some more of this sometime."
"Brown Ales aren't particularly my favorite, but there's something addicting about the mid-sip transition between solid brown ale and bourbon mellowness that I love in this one. I could probably put down a few of these before I realized it."
"Overall I have to admit this was not bad at all. I was really impressed that the bourbon tones were not overblown, but were in fact nicely put together as more of an accent to a already solid beer. Really a very well done brown ale that I would be happy to try any day!"
"D-Very enjoyable. I tried this on tap today before picking up some bottles. For some reason I prefer the bottled version."
"Brown in color with light wispy head and above average prickle. Smooth malty nose. Smooth sweet attack. Nice flavor with sweet tones tempered by a ""roasted"" flavor and mild hop like character at the finish with actual hops presentation. As the finish turns to aftertaste it leaves you wishing there was more taste in the sip. Excellent by my count. No real bourbon notes, but I really like bourbon and would welcome it so its possibly understated to me. Incredibly complex beer in a great way. It is on a short list of my favorite beers I have tried in the past few years."
"This one surprised me!!! The vanilla and smoke undertones were excellent...I like !!!"
"While not a preferred style it's certainly worth a try."
"Pours maroon to brownish with a malty browl ale like toasty, caramel, and vanilla malt. Taste is somewhat mild however, and while good, I got no indication of bourbon, but some tart, bitter brown ale like malt. Some bittering hops playing a part in the taste to balance. Drinkable, but not one of Tyranena's better brews."
"Palate is great, with brown sugar, dark honey, caramel and vanilla. Bourbon presence is mild, and is noticeable mid palate. The finish is dry with notes of vanilla and bourbon, with some light brown sugar. The lower level of carbonation works for the beer, but the finish is a little watery before the presence of bourbon and vanilla is felt. 4+3.5+4"
"The beer is drinkable but wish the body had more umph and carried the beer a little more versus the heavier bourbon notes."
"Food Notes: Pairs well with a half-dozen Delaware Bluepoints."
"Notes: Thanks to mully for yet another great extra."
"Poured this into my Duvel tulip. An aggressive pour leads to a light brown head for a nice amber brown beer. It leaves little lacing in the glass. The smell is of roasted malts and a little bit of the bourbon. The taste is really nice for a brown ale. I get plenty of roasted malts and a great accent of bourbon and vanilla. the mouthfeel is a bit above average and its a nice and drinkable beer."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy brown head, which does leave some nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty, nice little touch of bourbon for a 6% ABV brew, with some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, big malt flavor, bourbon (very nice), with some caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this was a treat to drink, very nicely done. Love the brew's from Tyranena."
"Ovr: I actually like some Tyranena beers, especially some of their ""brewers gone wild"" series, but this in't one of their best. It just seems like a relatively weak beer what cannot stand up to againg. I could only fins this as a 12 pack, so I'll keep trying it and see how it ages."
"They got their revenge allright...on my tastebuds."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Pours a deep mahogany color with a nice dense creamy off white head. The aroma isn't as strong as I'd like at all. It featured a touch of bourbon but was pretty faint overall. The flavor is a great blend of bourbon and beer though. The flavor of the bourbon comes through very nicely but isn't overpowering at all. There is a good amount of maltiness and a touch of nuttiness from the brown ale. The bourbon adds a bunch to the mouthfeel, giving a sharper edge than a brown ale normally would. Pretty good drinkability all around."
"Served in a twist off bottle bought in Madison, WI. Pours with a nice head, which reduces down to a light lacing. Looks light for a brown ale. Pick up some malts and slight hop smell. Taste is the same, but has a heavier hop presence and a little vanilla. Mouthfeel is light. Could drink alot of these. Definitely a good beer and interpretation of an American Brown Ale."
"Overall very drinkable, & I like the bourbon sneaking up in the back of my throat the more the beer disappears. I'd put this one in the category of one of my favorite browns, which puts it in the middle of the pack beer-wise for me."
"Drinkability: Great drinkability thanks to the lower ABV. Very easy to drink and enjoy."
"D-Decent tasting, pleasant mouthfeel, and a lower ABV make this easily sessionable and highly drinkable."
"Overall an enjoyable and approachable barrel-aged beer."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Pours very dark amber with small head. Smelled was light chocolate/caramel, may have been the bourbon. Too light to really say for sure. Taste was typical brown ale, medium bitterness, with sweetness at the end. Felt slightly fizzy. Pretty good for an amber, not usually my favorite style."
"Rocky's Revenge is a damn solid brown. I didn't pick up on much bourbon, but it's still a damn good brown."
"D - This is a fun session ale. I would want quite a few more. Wish I could get it here."
"This is the 3rd time I've had this brew, 1st was when I visited Madison in July of '05.. my notes say about the same thing, but I liked it more this time around.... Really a pretty good beer.. nice complexity.. reminds me of a West Coast brown."
"I'd recommend this beer."
"D - This is a very good American Brown. I really like the nutty/malty flavor."
"Well tastes like carbonated tea as well. Only traces of bourbon noticeable with some nutty character and fine malts. Lacking in complexity but the good carbonation and tea flavors help out drink ability somewhat."
"Drinkability: Pretty decent beer. Another good outing by Tyranena."
"Overall: pretty good. Its not a big beer you might get from a local brewpub or brewery where the entire brew was aged in a bourbon barrel and there is gangbusters of bourbon flavor. That said, it is a quite drinkable beer, not a session ale, but close with some hints of bourbon on top of a decent brown ale. A fair amount of complexity if you look for it, but the biggest player is still the brown ale malts with the bourbon notes right behind it."
"Drinkability -.One of the best beers from a fantastic local brewery. This stuff needs to be drunk by the growlerful. Typically fun marketing."
"This was interesting brown ale. I did not get the fuller body I was expecting but sweetness and slight, slight syrup were present."
"I'm not the biggest fan of all the barrell aged beers, but this one is worth trying."
"The feel is creamy and smooth, a nice, warm, buttery sip. There isn't too much carbonation but there's a lot of buzz in your mouth - hard to describe, sort of tangy in a way. I really like this beer. It's taste is great, feels wonderful in your mouth and doesn't have much of an alcohol presence in the taste. It leaves me comfortably warm and reaching for another. Great stuff."
"ale."
"EDIT: 2011 Tasting. Noticeable caramel. Sweeter, less dry, than I noted earlier, but still nicely balanced."
"It is a very drinkable beer that would be a good warmer on cold fall or winter night."
"Without having a lot of Boubon aged Brown ales, I always thought this would be a very good idea. This beer is a good example of why. The beer looks... ...well, brown, with some ruby highlights mixed in, and a slight haze. Low levels of carbon dioxide release a dainty foamstand, that did last the duration and laced well up front. The aromas give a solid chocolate malt scent with some emphasis on sweetness in the range of caramel, vanilla, and a little lactose. Tastes give much the same with a higher emhasis on the vanilla notes. A mild wood flavor eminatats through the sweetness and balances well with the timid hops and toasted grains. Any boubon flavors remain light and come through late in the finish / aftertaste. The body feels a bit heavy (due to lighter co2), but offers a velvety, milky texture. A really good beer, on the verge of being great. Thanks again Nathan15."
"D- a solidly drinkable brown ale with a nice bourbon note"
"D - Overall a very simple beer, nice and tasty."
"drinkability is decent, due to the complexity of flavors and aroma present. this is a unique brew that will take any palate for a ride. cheers!"
"This brew pours a dark brown color. The head is large, thick and light tan in color. The aroma is of oak, bourbon, chocolate malt, and a hint of caramel. The taste is like the aroma, but more pronounced. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a nice velvety texture. Overall, I really like this beer. The bourbon flavor is not as overpowering as it has been in other bourbon barrel aged beers I have had, and I think that adds to its drinkablity."
"ps: had it on tap at the brewery a week ago, and it maintained much more of the booze flavor, which was abrasive due to the limpness of the brown ale.. but was preferable over this bottled version."
"That said, this might not be the best beer to be bourbon aging. The bourbon dominated the aroma and flavor, yet wasn't that strong. Sure there was a little vanilla and oak in there too, but this beer was surprisingly low-flavor. That's not to say it isn't tasty or highly drinkable, because it is, it just has a lot of potential in my mind that it doesn't live up to."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer, well-balanced and interesting, but for some reason it just doesn't hold my attention that much. That said, it's perfectly drinkable and I wish I had more than just one bottle. And it's very versatile with cheese; try it with sheep's milk Manchego, aged Emmental, and aged Gouda."
"I like anything bourbon barrel aged, so I like this beer. With that said, this is a nice example of what barrel-aging can do, but not particularly exciting. Pours a nice deep brown that's revealed to be red when you hold it up to the light. Good head with good staying power. Nicely caramel-malty and some nice bourbon notes, with some buttery notes near the finish. Lingering bourbon aftertaste is pleasant."
"Pretty good! Could boost bourbon character and it would be better. I enjoyed it, but probably wouldn't rush back to it."
"Good beer!"
"This one poured the color of a watered down cola with a nice pillowy head and nice lacing. Head retention was very good. A nice subtle sweet aroma with maybe a hint of citrus. Light carbonation, medium body, nice balance in the taste with a little more hop bitterness than malt sweetness. Didn't really taste the alcohol, but could feel the warmth going down. Very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability - I would dig this anywhere, anytime. Thanks jj!"
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my Sly Fox shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a medium dark brown color with a finger of light tan head. The bourbon is evident in the nose as well as some wood (oak), and vanilla. Tastes of toasted coconut, a hint of almond, vanilla and alcohol. A notch above medium in body and carbonation. Recommended."
"Taste and mouthfeel: Dark chocolate taste with a nice hint of caramel and 2 row malts and a taste of northern brewers hops not bad but not great overall and appealing beer that should be enjoyed by all."
"Pours out a chestnut brown- woody smell. The taste is quite sweet, must be the vanilla being picked up from the bourbon. Carbonation is appropriate for the style. Quite a nutty/fruity taste, with low hop levels . I thought the bourbon was quite well done- definitely a bourbon twang on the finish but certainely not in your face. Its an enjoyable brown ale. I'm glad I had a chance to try, but wouldn't be first choice if I ran into it again."
"D: Few bourbon beers are as drinkable as this one. The soft bourbon buttery notes are very enjoyable."
"single from Star Liquor in Madison"
"I would love to try this beer on tap to compare bottle vs tap. While a good beer, it did not integrate the heavy presence of bourbon into the brown ale as well as I had hoped."
"Bottle thanks to the generous jpm30. Rich brown colour, but unique to get it that way. White head that lasts a while. Bourbon aroma, and bold bourbon taste. We Canadians are not normally into bourbon, but a good effort at it. Sourish by-product, well malted."
"Drinkability is ok."
"It was bottled conditioned, or at least had sediment in the bottom. Medium brown color. Aroma of ripe fruit esters, toasted mellow aroma. This was followed by a rich malt flavor, a bit roasty-toasty, medium bodied, nicely balaced by the bourbon flavor. Just missing the vanilla & wood notes that would have really launched this beer, but perhaps the present balace is more important."
"Dvery good, Id have another but its pretty boozy in the flavor so one more would do it for me."
"Drinkability: Not being a big bourbon drinker, I have to admit this beer was more of a sipper for me, took awhile to finish. I liked the flavor, very interesting, but not an everyday drinker."
"D - Very smooth and easily drinkable has a slightly hoppy finish and is a great beer to sip on."
"A very nice looking brown with a creamy tan head, and it smells good too, with some creamy chocolate and kentucky bourbon and oak odors. And it tastes fine too...its as it should be.... nothing amazing. a regular brown with the advertized bourbon and oak flavors...hints of vanilla, a bit of strange hoppiness, some burnt flavors...a bit thin. its not one i would buy probably but its pretty good and i'm actually pretty glad that tyranena is making this as one of their regular offerings."
"Mouthfeel is a little creamy, medium body. Bourbon flavor is very nice, but clean water dominates. This brew has good direction and a good goal, but overall I wish they pushed the flavor a little farther. I'm NOT a bourbon drinker, but I like the effect the aging has done in this brew. Decent brown ale."
"Poured this amber colored ale down the center of the glass, and got very little head at all, and what tannish foam was there disappeared quickly. In a strong light, the color is more gold than amber, very light looking, as is the mouthfeel. Watery, but a little something there with the distinct bourbon taste in the beer. It has the nutty, malty flavor of a brown, but not a lot there. Slightly astringent, and maybe a little diacetyl butteriness. Not bad, and the taste is the best part of the beer. Not crazy about the smell--bourbon in an old sock--bit staleish, but again--not excessively bad in any way--just not good or great. I wish I had traded a few more of this six pack for other beers."
"Slainte!"
"D: This beer was unbalanced and could have been much better. Certainly not bad though, I"
"The body is light to mid feel but a little wispy with a watery finish. The flavor is good and unique. I will have to take revenge and trade for this again."
"Very interesting beer. It pours a nice brown amber with a nice head. It smells of Jim Beam primarily with ""brown ale"" grain notes. The taste is of root beer, cherry candy, caramel, molasses, butterscotch and cola. Very complex, sort of hard to get used to, but it gets better as you drink it. Mouthfeel is good and velvety. Drinkability is good, like I said gets easier the more you drink it. Great idea, unusual to find experiments like this bottled in six packs."
"This poured with a thin, light-tan head that very quickly reduced to wispiness. Color was a clear, deep-brown with ruby highlights. The nose was malty-sweet with undercurrents of bourbon. The mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant sweetness on the tongue. I could definitely sense the bourbon in the mouth, but the finish was unmistakably bourbon. I liked the taste, despite not being a distilled spirits drinker. I would drink this again, but it would not be my first choice. Warming, the bourbon presence began to give off vanilla notes in the nose and then became even more evident in the mouth."
"Update - 4/17/13 - finishing off a 6 pack. This is a nice drinking beer. The bourbon is balanced nicely with a consistent presence that is not too much or over-powering."
"Overall an interesting brew. I would imagine that this would appeal to a bourbon drinker."
"D- This beer has good depth, nice oaky flavors and some good sweetness also."
"-UF"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Lots of fast moving carbonation smooths it out on the way down. An easy drinking beer that just falls off a bit on the flavor profile for me. I don't think I could have more than one or two in a sitting personally. Overall, a unique brown ale that steps outside the norm a bit."
"Pours dark brown and clear with reddish hues in the light. Initial smells are sweet vanilla with caramel malts. A peppery alcohol taste is up front with some wheat bread and light vanilla flavors as well. Fairly smooth and creamy with a little tingle from the alcohol in the taste. Fairly drinkable brown."
"Bottle from Bodega in La Crosse. Dark amber/brown color with a medium off-white head. Good lacing throughout. Aroma of bourbon, malt and nuts. Medium body with an earthy texture, and the bourbon aging is apparent throughout. Malty, nutty flavors as well. The finish is nutty also with a light alcohol burn left behind. Good all around."
"Dark brown clear body, head rises and fades befoe i take a sip, leaving moderate lacing. Light roasted malt and some bourbon scents are evident, somewhat woody. The taste is very interesting. The bourbon aging is obvious, something that is usually only seen in larger beers, and different styles. I like it. The malt plays pretty much an equal role as the bourbon flavoring, giving some very nice beradiness in the background. It is a unique beer, and I think the sum of it's parts exceeds the individual compontents. Well above average."
"Aroma was mostly just a sweet malty affair with a bit of nuttiness and the barest whiff of wood and bourbon. Light brown/red in color with a thin white film of a head. Fore is low intensity sweet malts, light nuttiness and little else. The finish is all watery bourbon and wood. Not much in the way of range, but not bad tasting and I usually dont like bourbon."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable i would say"
"Drinkability: Quite good, higher than most bourbon beers."
"overall: first of all, i'd like to thank mlh1227 for the try here. however, this is not my thing. i'm not overly attracted to bourbon flavors. the coconut was a hinderance to me as well. a nice try as i always enjoy trying something new, but i can't give my recommendation."
"Tough to swallow this beer."
"Pours a thick amber/garnet color with smallish tan head but good lacing. Smell and taste are pungent and delicious. Like a cross between a nut brown and a wee-heavy...a brilliant mix in my opinion. Caramel malts, bourbon vapors, a nutty bite, some floral hoppiness, a lovely bouquet. Mouthfeel is typical of an American brown, a little thin, but substantial enough. Drinkable to no end. This was a pleasant surprise without a doubt. Another solid offering from Tyranena which puts out some surprisingly good stuff."
"Interesting, enjoyable, and not overdone with bourbon-barrel character."
"Drinkability: It's pretty good, and different than your typical brown, but not THAT good."
"A very solid, brown ale. This one pours out to a dark brown in the glass with an average-sized head. The aroma is of a light malt with baking bread dough thrown in for good measure. The taste is straightforward, brown ale, with roasted malt goodness shining through. This one isn't a ""chewy"" brown, but very drinkable. This could be a session brown and I can seen the fine folks of Wisconsin doing just that with this one. Thanks to fantome for hooking me up with this one."
"Comments  Thanks to BuckeyeNation for laying this one on me."
"Only my second brew from Tyranena...I am impressed so far."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" light tan head over the mostly clear reddish brown brew. Frothy head hangs around nicely, and lacing is very nice. Aroma is lightly of grains, but more or less too sedate for me here. Taste is upfront with brown malts, moving into some fruitiness, and a bourbon flavor at the close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. I'm not a real big fan of the extreme browns, which this one seems to almost aspire to, but it's an enjoyable and interesting brew, for sure."
"Thanks jeffboo!"
"Dark copper color with a fizzy head. The aroma is malty, but unremarkable. The flavor is sweet at first, then there is a little oak flavor, but not many bourbon characteristics. Aggresive carbonation is a little annoying on the tongue. Pretty good drinkability. This isn't bad, but here are a ton of beers similar to this but better, so why bother."
"Chestnut colored liquid capped with an oatmeal colored lid of sea foam. The head grips the sides of the glass and slides down, leaving a uniform ring around the inside. The smell is very faint, do I smell bourbon or am I imagining it? I'm picking up some sweet malt, some brown sugar and molasses, but I have to try hard. A creamy mouthfeel leads to a thin-flavored wash of syrupy flavor of sweet malt and caramel, and definite bourbon overtones. Although I think the bourbon detracts. It doesn't mesh well with the other elements, and leaves a sharp and bitter aftertaste, with a metallic linger. Thanks to BuckeyeNation for sharing, but as I glance at the review below, he appears as enthralled as I."
"Rocky's Revenge Bourbon Brown is a disappointment, but that's only because my hopes were sky high. It's still good beer, even if the pint of Bourbon Barrel Porter that I had at my local Rock Bottom last month is its clear superior. I'm not sorry that I bought a sixer, but no tears will be shed once I've finished the last one."
"Interesting, but not overly interesting as far as bourbon aged beers go. This could have used more malt backbone, but I did like the subtle bourbon flavor. Perhaps a bit too subtle, but the levels worked for this Brown Ale. Just enough to seep into the palate and let you know its there."
"I've had this a few times and it just gets worse and worse to me. Now, it really reminds me of jack and coke. Really fake sweet and really, really whiskey strong. The recent bottles need some barrel control or something like that."
"Drinkability has to rate high...a lower weight tasty brown ale....not a lot of Brown ales better than this one (except the full blend).."
"Good beer!"
"A good beer to savor."
"Drinkability is very solid. sort of one-dimensional and I would rather see the whole beer barrel-aged rather than just a blend but its a very pleasing brown ale."
"Superb! Cheers Mate!!"
"Thanks for the splash of bourbon cokes."
"Much thanks to cokes for the bottle!"
"I've tried the non-blended version, and its a bourbon bomb....tasty as hell, but more of a spectacle than a constant drinker. This one shows the restraint it needs to fall into heavy rotation."
"One of Tyranena's best. Glad to hear that this will be a staple in their lineup and not just a seasonal offering. Miles ahead of their other Brown ale, and it seems that the key here is only parially aging this in bourbon barrels, rather than doing the whole thing. Well maintained flavors, a real winner."
"This is a bourbon lover's delight (although hardly a substitute for a good bourbon), it makes a delicious beer. The bourbon flavor is prominent upfront, in addition to oak, in which the brown ale aged. Vanilla and caramel emerge in the midtones. Just a touch of tabacco toward the back. Dry oak flavor returns this finishes with a burnt brown sugar taste."
