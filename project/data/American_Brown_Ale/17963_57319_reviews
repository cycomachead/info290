"Delicious brown ale made with hemp. Has an earth taste that was enjoyed very much."
""
"Very smooth.  Very different from anything I had before.  The color looked like a standard brown ale and there wasn't a really distinct smell from what I could gather.  Taste wasn't bad, but isn't something I would crave a lot.  Good beer to mix it up with, but not something I would consistently buy.  Worth buying if you want to try something unique."
"For the most part I'm generally disappointed with American Brown Ales.  No exception here, either I really hate the taste of hemp or this is just a bad beer. Bitter with a poor mix of hops and malt."

"Pours a clear medium brown producing 1.5 fingers of frothy, tan, shortlived head that leaves a slim surface ring & a thin wash of pasty lacing. Aroma dark malt, toast, chocolate, toffee & faint roasted nuts. Taste is fronted by toasted brown bread, a hint of cocoa, roasted nuts, caramel & dark fruity notes at mid-sip & finishing with a note of toffee & bitterness. Aftertaste is burnt malt bitter cocoa & cola caramel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, smooth & creamy with a nice prickly bite."

"Pours a medium brown color with a white head.  The aroma is full of caramelized malts and a bit of herb,  The taste is malty but with some herbal, seedy, rooty flavor from the hemp.  Bitter and rooty, with a nice nutty malty sweetness. Even a hint of fruit finds way across seed and grain. Medium bodied, well carbonated, enjoyable and drinkable. Overall, a very good ale.  Ya Mon!"

"A ruby red sea is capped with a foamy, tan froth.  Has a caramel, nut, help and medium fruit aroma.  Tastes sweet and smooth with some grain, candy and fruits that mingle with a metallic nuttiness.  Somewhat mineraly in the aftertaste.  Reminds me of Pynchon's Vineland for some reason...  A true underdog beer that deserves better than it's lot."
""
"Overall (3.77) : This brown has hop presence, there's no denying that. It's a good beer overall. I don't think I'm swayed enough to buy a six pack, but it is a pretty decent beer. I would have it again if offered."

" The flavor is a mix of woody hops with raisin-like taste from the malt and yeast mixing with a strange herbal element that comes of as nutty and slightly earthy with subtle fig-like aspect which is more like dark toffee but not that sweet. The flavor has a mild yeast taste I can't place or perhaps it is the hemp. Overall I like this but would probably not get this again, there are many brown ales I prefer to this in the same abv range."

"O: 2012 bottle probably past prime; revisited with fresh bottle in Nov. 2014 -- rating upgraded"
"Overall: I really enjoyed all of the malts and chocolate notes on this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty, but not really a bold Brown Ale, partially due to expectations given the unexpected ingredient. I did like the rounded spicy profile."
"Dark brown-amber, clear, small sudsy head that fades pretty quickly. Smell is very light: faraway nuts and fruit. Taste is crisp and nutty, with oily pine, but is mostly a cloying rose flavor that im not digging. And I don't see the hemp or pot influence at all."

"Pours a hazy deep reddish-brown in color with just a thin off-white head. Some decent lacing was seen with each sip. Average carbonation. Lots going on with the aroma with some roasted malt, caramel, floral and toffee. The taste has even more going on and is hard to describe. A sweet dry aftertaste is noted but isn't harsh. Not bad at all and is a different brew"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 4/16/2013. Pours slightly cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, biscuit, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and light hop/hemp notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown sugar, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown sugar, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and robustness of dark malt flavors with light hop/hemp presence; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice brown ale. Good balance and robustness of dark malt flavors and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O: ""Okay"" works well to describe this one- nothing is offensive or particularly good, so I didn't mind drinking it but also wasn't particularly enthused."
"O- It's drinkable in its mildness, but could use a flavor boost."
""
""
""
""
""

"There is something like a dry chocolate or rather carob flavor. Some odd sweetness lingers in the aftertaste. This seems well made but the taste gets a little tiresome. It doesn't seem to have either the crispness of a more refreshing beer or the roasted malt of the better Browns. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bine & Vine in San Diego."

"OVERALL: Nicely done Brown Ale from Nectar. I cannot say that the hemp changes it too much, maybe I just don’t know what I’m looking for, but it certainly does not take anything away from it."
"O: I have no idea what hemp actually tastes like but it didn't add much flavor or aroma to this brew. Not a bad brown ale but nothing remember-able."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent malt complexity, but lacking a bit in hops for the style. The fruity notes were a bit offputting. Not a big cola fan, either."
""
""
""
""
""
"There's a bit too much spritz, but otherwise the medium body holds together well."
"Date tasted: May 24, 2013... Glassware: Victory Hop Devil nonick... Occasion: recognizing baseball coaching season is almost over... Appearance: dark brown body with a monstrous brown two-finger head that foams significantly--welcoming!... Aroma: lightly toasted, brightly hopped--a bit of mild sweetness too... Palate: smooth--too smooth?--with mild effervescence late, and little more... Taste: quite mild and unassuming--mellow to the point of nondescription; I recall having a Hempen Ale and wondering the similar thought--hemp doesn't seem to alter much... Overall: a pleasant, easy-drinking brew that has little in its complexity (it is a brown, after all), and yet its promise to be anomalous doesn't quite pan out....but for its price point, about right."
"The aftertaste is not particularly outstanding. So I would not seek this out again."

"O: A solid brown ale, but nothing exciting. Still, for the style it's fairly well-done, and I wouldn't hesitate to grab a couple more if I'm ever in the mood."
""
"Overall – Not my type of flavours found in a beer, but it still tastes well crafted and interesting. It has a touch too many earthy notes for me but still worth a try."
""
"Pours a dark brown to black yet still can see a bit of light coming through this beer. Some head at pour disappates to almost nothing with no lacing present on the glass. Aroma reveals some earthy tones - grass (no pun intended) and dirt (on the good side). Flavor is mild and not as interesting with a mostly consistent flavor from front to back. Relatively light."
""
""
""
""
"The metallic and vegetable taste did not work for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"This ale brewed with hemp isn't to bad, sort of tastes like a slightly washed out Newcastle or something along those lines. I don't know what the purpose of adding hemp but what the heck give it a try."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Not a fan of this one at all."
""
""
"D - Not bad, it is pretty standard brown ale with a decent malt presence and a pronounced nutty character presumably from the hemp."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I wish that there were more hemp in this. If this had been billed as a garden variety brown ale I think I might've like it a little more. I'm glad I tried it but I probably won't have it again. It's worth a try."
""
"O- Very drinkable but certainly not very exciting. And, if you're looking for something that comes even a little bit close to tasting like marijuana, steer clear of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured out as an average looking brown color, good clarity and a white fizzy head. The retention was minimal as well as the lacing. The smell of the beer some sweet malt with a touch of coffee and an herbal note. The taste of the beer is lightly roasted, it's got a subtle chocolate flavor as well as a bitter finish. The mouthfeel of the beer was light, decent carbonation with a soft creamy finish to it. Overall it's not a bad brown ale. It's not the best but it's still worth trying."
"This beer is a fun, delicious nut brown that is great to drink at 3am if you can't sleep."
""
""
"Appearance is a brownish color with ruby edges. There is a thin layer of head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. In spite of the thin head, there is fizziness that remains. The nose is light – some malt and a touch of nuttiness. The flavor is mild. I am not sure what hemp is supposed to taste like, but this just tastes like a basic thin brown ale."
"M: Medium bodied."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice malty brown ale. Good mix of flavors and balance."
"Not as thick as it initially seems. I am usually not a fan of darker brews just because a lot of them seem to be too 'meaty', after one beer the sound of another doesn't sound too appetizing, but Humboldt Brown is actually very light. The top note still has that classic brown ale flavor, but it dissipates into a very smooth, refreshing middle, leaving an equally refreshing aftertaste. Its light with a robust flavor and yet maintains a 5.7% alcohol content. I really enjoyed it. It seems to go well with everything(food, other drinks, etc.)"
""
"Review from 6/2010 notes. Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a deep ruby amber with a small, fine head and light lacing. Roasted malt and light hop aroma. A bland, slight malt, slightly fruity taste with an abrupt finish with slight hops. A light earthy, interesting flavor in the background, but it stays far enough away to not catch my interest. Kind of boring, really. Adequate."
""
"Overall - It's drinkable, but I don't think I'd buy it again unless my options were severely limited."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is amber, quite dark and on top of it a good beige foamy head. Dense and sticky. The aroma is dominated by hops. Piny. Some caramel malts too. I notice also some roasted malts. Good. The taste I get some nuts, hazelnuts. The finish is slightly bitter. Refreshing and very sessionable. This one I would buy quite often for day to day drinking. A good beer overall."
"Not boring. Just not interesting enough to write home about"
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink but there’s nothing overly special about the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm pleased with this beer. The thick, creamy taste is backed up with roasted malt and nutty flavor. I didn't notice many hoppy characteristics, but this is a brown ale, so I'm looking for more of a malty flavor."
"O: Not sure the malt, hops, and adjuncts really worked together on this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fairly average for the style."
"O- I honestly avoided this beer for quite a while because I didn't want to drink a glass of marijuana. This was pretty good though."
"Great Taste all the way thru the beer! Just what a brown should be...!"
""
""
""
""
"nutty quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a decent beer. one i'll probably not revisit but would certainly drink if it was handed to me."
"pretty average brown ale. wheres the hemp?"
""
""
""
"pours a slightly heady clear brown color that smells like a light chocolate malt and some agricultural produce. earthy and mild, tastes like a basic brown ale with a bit of organic matter. not composty per se, but not hempy either. mouthfeel is thin and only moderately carbonated. not as good as some of their other brews, this one didnt amaze me"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This brew is pretty uninspiring and has some weird things going on. Too many other good browns out there..."
""
""
""
"Dark brown pour with a lighter brown head to it. Sticky lace was left all the way down the glass. Nice roasted aroma in the nose. Malts mostly prevalent along with some light cocoa notes. A little something extra at the end that makes you wonder what the taste will be like. At first the flavor follows the nose. Roasted malts, slight cocoa and coffee flavors mix well together. Earthy taste to it, with a bit of spice dotted here and there. The spice comes out a little more at the end with a decent hop bitterness. Not sure what the spice is, but meshed well with the other flavors to create an enjoyable beer for sure. Medium body with good carbonation. I enjoyed drinking this and would have another if the opportunity arose."
"Not a bad American Brown, starts slow but comes around"
"Not the strongest brew I've had from these guys... Servicable? Absolutely! A masterpiece? Nope..."
"Pours deep coppery brown with a mediocre head. The aroma is slight and woody. The flavor is thin, with a woody, brown sugar flavor that fades away essentially to nothing. The finish is watery, with a faint bitterness. The mouthfeel is slick and watery."
"The taste is malty and bready, with a small hop bite in the middle. Caramel malts give it a balanced sweetness up front while the breadiness comes through in the back end mostly, giving it a full body, almost too full for the style. A little bit of spiciness, probably from the hemp, adds a bit of character to a sort of bland brown ale. Somewhat creamy in the feel in the back, but tingly on the top of the tongue. Definitely leaves and unwanted and lingering mouthfeel that actually makes the experience much less enjoyable. It seems to be the main problem with a decent beer, definitely docking points in my book. Overall, I probably wouldn't buy this again, but worth a try."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a 1 inch foamy tan head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. A latticework of lace lines the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, slight cocoa and coffee aromas, and a nutty quality. Taste is of roasted malt, roasted nuts, cocoa powder, and slight coffee beans. A nice roasty bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some nice roasty and earthy flavors. I tried this a while ago in the bottle and didn't care for it too much, but on tap this is most excellent."
"Overall - A refreshing brown, both in taste and in being a different player in a tried and true field. Again, this beer really is close to style, with all of the elements of a solid brown beer. However, the tweaks on the formula - a noticeable hop profile (part of which perhaps coming from the hemp) and altered body (in taste and feel) are worth a go. Really enjoyed this one."
"Standard brown ale flavors dominate—lot of malt, light carbonation—with a bit of what I am guessing is a hemp aftertaste? Not entirely sure as it's not hoppy but there's definitely a distinct flavor that comes across in the finish. Drinkable, enjoyed it as a shared bottle, but otherwise just there. No complaints, nor cause for celebration."
" The Hemp must add a certain complexity to the herbal and maybe even spice-like effect.Enjoyable brown."
"Overall a good beer, If someone really enjoys Hemp Beer this is one I would say give it a try."
"Overall: Nice little brown ale. I truly think that is one style that it is hard to make good but this one is pretty close"
"Overall Impression- How can you pass up a Tap Handle that has a Marijuana Leaf on the front of it!?!? Had to have. I did feel that it not only didn't have enough body behind it, it also was weak and could have used more ingredients. Sweet, malty, and had good tastes but lacked some. I'm not dissing this brew by any means, but just simply wouldn't go back to it.."
"O: Decent brown ale. Glad I tried it... May have to drink one on a cooler night.."
"Humboldt Brown pours out a clear brownish/orange hue with a light head. The aroma of this beer is deeply earthy and exceptionally unique. True to the American Brown Ale style, this is a richly malty beer. You get a nice blend of chocolate and caramel malts that play nicely with the toasty quality that the hemp seeds add to the beer. On the swallow you get a snap of hops that lingers throughout the drink. Overall, this is a sturdy brown ale."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark slightly red brown that was slightly translucent. A one finger bubbly head appeared that didn't cling, and only lasted for a few moments. Aroma was a tad acidic, with definite hints of a milk chocolate, and a tad of brown wheat bread. Taste was slightly sweet, hint of lactose and burnt dark chocolate. Finished with a roasted flavor in the mouth. Felt ok in the mouth, tingled the tongue a bit much for my liking. Coated well but just felt a little thin at time, with just a tad of carbonation could be felt. Overall a reasonable brown. Fairly solid middle of the road."
"3.5 D: If they upped the mash temp of this by a good 4 or 5 degrees, this could be a very good beer. Nose and taste are both pretty good, I just want more of it."
"Dry and husky grain, toasty and mellow. Pretty easy going with moderate carbonation and a lighter body. Residual dry roast malt, pretty smooth and not bitter. Lingering toasted malts in the aftertaste, dry but fairly pleasant. Whatever hemp seed is in here, it doesn't lend much, some woody/earthy flavors perhaps, but it would be hard to pick out and isolate from the dominant malt flavors. Overall not too bad, a fairly simple but decent brown ale. Simplicity is underrated."
"O) Overall true to brown ale style."
"I hadn't realised this was a brown ale from passing it by on the shelf at albertsons. However it was on sale and a closer look revealed it was infact a brown ale and not the pale ale one might think of with a green cardboard cutout. So since I usually like browns I decided to try it out. Looked pretty thin, not a lot of head on the beer. Slight hempness smell though not like the weed smell you get from some green bottles- more of a foresty smell. Flavor was not good and not bad- just rather lacking. Made me wonder why they called it a brown ale. This one does go down pretty easily but that's about it, not much flavor to speak of and hardly a brown ale."
"Overall-- I won't be getting this beer again. It simply isn't a pleasurable experience."
"Will I drink it again? Yes, because there are still four left in the six pack! Was it worth the money? At $12; not a chance."
"Pleasant enough--there's light cocoa malt flavor, some balancing bitterness. Relatively mild flavored. The body is a bit thin; the carbonation average. The aftertaste is more bitter than the taste."
"I don't quite know where the hemp came into play in this one, it just seems like a sub-par nut brown ale to me."
"Overall - pretty tasty. Decent brown ale."
"A nice Brown Ale with a good balance of rich flavors. Unique flavors from what must be the hemp, worth trying for anyone."
"Overall a good session beer that would not sound any taste alarms to the presence of hemp it would seem. Almost watery body makes it pretty easy to session. Although some flavor makes up for the lack of body."
"Overall not bad, nothing special, some weird bitter and mineral flavors I think from the hemp, could have been a bit maltier, decent, bit of briny minerality."
"This is an underrated beer and I hope to see more hemp ales maybe combined with different styles such as a pale ale or india pale ale so the hemp flavors stand out more. I understand why they chose a brown ale to showcase the hemp seeds because the nutty grassy flavor they seem to give off blend in perfectly with the roasted chocolate caramel malts. Highly recommended."
"Fairly easy drinking brown ale. Overall, enjoyable, with flavorful caramel malt being the highlight, but not outstanding."
"Pours clear, dark amber color. 1/34 inch head of an off-tan color. Slight retention and slight lacing.  Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight citrus hops, hint of toffee, slight roasted malt, and hint of pine. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, roasted malt, hops, hint of alcohol, slight toffee, and a hint of spice. Overall, good aroma and body. The body is subtle, but the blend and complexity make it a good beer."
"O: A gimmick? Maybe - but it's reasonably good session drinking none the less. I like how incredibly different Nectar's Humboldt Brown is, and that it all kind of comes together. Is this something I'll reach for often? No, but I'll certainly recommend others give it a shot."
"O: Very easy to drink, enjoyable brown ale. Will for sure get some more to keep around."
"o - Overall a good brown ale, slightly above average, Would have again if I were in the mood for a brown ale, yet wouldn't seek out."
"Overall this is a great tasting Brown Ale to be drinking. Would have again no problem, good stuff!"
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, not a bad beer but there are others in the style that I would pick first."
"Overall, pleasant, tasty, unexceptional."
"Take home scale, I'd leave this one on the shelf."
"O - This is a nice brown ale. Easy drinking and tasty."
"D: Overall a nice brown, but I really find a pine hop flavor, not too much hemp, but I expect this just adds to overall texture."
"D- meh, this was mediocre at best. nothing in here really separates this from the other examples of this style. i wont be seeking this out again, and im glad i opted for the single and not a full sixer."
"don't bother."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is not a bad beer, worthy of a try."
"Drinkability -- Finally tried it, but could honestly take it or leave it, really. Nothing too special with the base, plus the hemp addition was a weakness rather than an asset."
"Not a bad beer here, it has some things going on. Poured into a tumbler pint a clear reddish brown with head that reaches the top or the glass and dissipates fairly quickly, leaving some lacing. Dark malts and hops present in the nose, the taste has a bit of a hemp-y flavor, not too strong, and a tinge of metal with a nice roasty aftertaste. I'd say the beer has moderate body and is a good example of a brown ale."
"I like this beer. I don't know what the hemp really adds to it. But if nothing else, it makes for some nice conversation."
"Very light and drinkable with some nice twists on the usual brown ale formula. Doesn't come across as excessively ""hempy"" but its presence is definitely notable and makes for a nice brew."
"D - It's a light feeling beer but the taste wouldn't bring me back for another."
"Two fingers of nicely frothy deep tan foam, mostly larger bubbles yet has decent retention, more sheets of lacing than streaks, you can see it slowly slide uniformly downwards. Light gauziness deepens the otherwise clear reddish brown colored liquid, takes on a zinc orange cast at the rims and glass bottom, pleasing to look at. The nose has a casual softness to it, mocha, cocoa, molasses and cinnamon, ginger spice, spiced orange peel, then a moss, herbal element which one assumes is hemp derived, abbreviated burst of apricot and peach scents, there's a mineral water to tonic water component which lends additional stiffness to its posture. Medium-bodied, chocolate, caramel and butterscotch first into the pool, albeit not in a very sweet manner, more cinnamon and nutmeg, more like a cake than pie, perhaps due to the quiet peach, apple, apricot fruit. Raw Brazil nuts. The lemon, orange citrus dryish and more pulp than peel. Same minerally, earthy ""organic"" character to it, brings freshness but not flavor. The carbonation is not that big but arguably higher than needed given the lightness of the flavors. Smooth texture and easy to quaff, but where's the beef?"
"drinkability is good especially because of the low abv."
"D: I probably wouldn't drink this again, just like I wouldn't drink the Hemp Ale again. It just isn't the same as the real thing."
"Pours a crystal clear brown color with a small tight khaki colored head. The aroma is of brown sugar and a touch of an herbal spice. Has a bit of a multi-grain bread aroma. The taste starts off with a brown sugar sweetness, which is quickly cut off by a ropey herbal note and lemony twang. Has a bunch of tea like flavors. The feel is light to moderate with pleny of fizzy carbonation; sweet to start but finishes slightly tart. Too much of a lemony tea characteristic to this brew for a brown ale. The malt profile is so-so and the brew is a touch over carbonated. It does drink quite easy."
"Rich ruby red color with a one-inch white frothy head that dissipates fairly quickly. Tastes like root beer, almost Dr. Pepper. Creamy and fizzy mouthfeel, more like a sweet soft drink than an ale. Overall, pleasant and distinct, not bad for a gimmick beer, worth trying once, no reason to try again."
"Pours a fairly-dark brown color with a light tan head and a light touch of lacing. The nose is a bit of light brown malt with some brown sugar, caramel, and a touch of citrus hops. The taste is mostly malt that is slightly bready with a bit of sweetness. Pretty good feel. Not a bad brew, but nothing special."
"D- Im not a big brown ale fan and I'm thinking that this is just another brown in my book, which it is, but I still like it, so I hope this company makes it to Philly soon. What are you guys/gals waiting for?"
"D: The look threw me off on this but the drink is good"
"I would never buy this again. I'm glad I was able to pick up a single bottle of it for $1.30."
"So, okay, I did pick this up because the ""ale brewed with hemp"" seemed like a cool novelty, something to check out at least once. And I like it, but all I'll do is once, because other than the earthy herbal qualities on the tongue, which are pretty enjoyable despite their lack of staying power, the plant doesn't really differentiate this very much from other everyday browns. Mixed feelings, for sure."
"This is what I would hope for from a beer like this. A solid base beer flavor, and a smack of hemp. Worth trying if you're into trying new things."
"It wouldn't be hard to have more than one in a sitting, but I still wouldn't categorize this as a session beer. I remembered in California backcountry last year and trying this for the first time, the vibe of the region seemed to be perfectly reflected in this beer. It won't win any awards but it has nothing to hide and is pretty easygoing. Like the other Nectar Ales that I've tried, this shows what a nicely crafted brew is capable of and is worth a go once because there isn't anything out there quite like this."
"And the Leaving Falls Church uber-bender continues to proclaim its greatness. This conspirator pours a clear ruby brown topped by a finger of short-lived ecru foam. The nose comprises brown sugar, very light sugar-free maple syrup, graham crackers, and a touch of flowers. The taste is similar, though the brown sugar doesn't stick and water pervades everything else. The proceedings are too fluid to allow the 'buds to really savor anything. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, an okay brown at best, too light and watery to really maintain anything."
"Drinkability: An average brown ale at best. The hemp helps make the beer super dry. While present towards the end this really does not distinguish itself. I will pass in the future."
"taste is a little flat, malt, some sour, caramel, brown sugar, nuts, spice, and pepper, ends somewhat dry."
"D: A decent malt based beer, residual which was a sweet desert style by example. The hemp was no doubt a marketing gimmick which truly lends little if any to the overall factor of the drink. Like mentioned earlier, a marketing gimmick that will ensure that if you brought a six-pack over to a party will no doubt gather the interest of all the pot heads willing to help you drink this who evidently dont know the difference between the two."
"Light in body, okay carbonation, very low in bitterness, and clean in the finish. I'm glad I used half the bottle for cooking, cause there's not a lot here to go around."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Decent brown, though that's not one of my go-to styles."
"Poured a reddish-brown hue into a pint glass, with a finger of off-white, poor retention, and spotty lacing. The nose only revealed biscuit, yeast, and malt; nothing else. The taste revealed no additional flavors, with a semi-dry finish. A little underwhelming. Medium-bodied and more carbonated than the appearance would suggest; sessionable but lacking in flavor profile."
"Drinkability isn't too hot. It's certainly not offensive, there's just nothing particularly redeeming about it, with a mostly acrid character that certainly doesn't beget seconds. Not even worth the novelty."
"Wont drink it again."
"There is just enough here to keep you interested, without overdosing your palate."
"Nectar Ales--Firestone Walker Brewing Company--Humboldt Brown All Natural Ale--Ale Brewed With Hemp--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.70% ABV. 32 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) Thickish pour. Thin light lace fizzy tan head. Clear dark bright red brown color. Herbal soft cocoa mild hop front. Crisp somewhat zesty dry sweet thin textured soft toasted brown biscuit body. Soft clean hop spice end. Tasty refreshing with herbal hemp hint. Sampled 2/14/2011. 6-Pack purchased for $9.99 at Sharif's Deli, Ballard, Seattle on 7/31/2010."
"Decent in all areas, spectacular in none. I'm happy to drink this on tap or on bottle as an alternative to BMC beers, but would much rather drink a Red Nectar or Nectar IPA in almost any circumstance, not to mention beers offered by other breweries."
"D - A pint went down easy enough, although I can't really see the point of drinking more than one unless you are just looking for a simple brew. Meh... next!"
"The beer is a bit too thick and syrupy, but pretty quaffable."
"12 ounce bottle, w/o freshness info. Purchased as part of a sixer at DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Pours a familiarl brown ale brown, light khaki head, loose and frothy, leaves ample spotty lacing. Earthy, nutty nose. Pleasant brown, malty, nutty, more earthiness picked up. Musty light chocolate note also detected. I'm not exactly sure what Hemp smells like or tastes like so I cant comment on how much of a hemp character this beer exhibits. Balanced, drinkable, sessionable and quite pleasant brown.I'd like to try this one as the base for a marinade for chicken/pork tenderloin, cuz of the moderate sweetness and earthy notes. Nice new offering from Nectar Ales."
"Overall, an interesting take on the brown style. Some research reveals that hemp has only about 0.3% THC, compared to marijuana's 6-20%, so no high. But its resiny darkness was just what I needed as a nice 4/20 celebration."
"M/D: Light in body, pretty fizzy. Low ABV but interesting flavors. I would like to have this again."
"I like that this beer was not too sweet, and that the bitterness lingered, not in excess, but enough to keep me drinking it. It has this lager-like clean flavor, making it less interesting perhaps, but at the same time almost sessionable. Worth a try..."
"Drinkability: This isn't the most exciting ale out there, but it showcases the hemp seed well and is nicely balanced. I'm sure I'll be buying this again."
"Overall, a decent brown ale. Nothing particularly distinguishing but not bad."
"D: Smooth and drinkable and crisp. Nothing to complain about..."
"Dark but perfectly clear brownish-amber in the glass with a finger of off-white head that dies down to a ring somewhat quickly. The aroma is caramel malt and toast, breakfast cereal, mineral water, and a touch of citrusy hops. Taste is heavy on the crystal malt, toasted grain, caramel. Sweetness is fairly well balanced by a mild bitterness and leafy hop note. There's an interesting herbal, nutty character that I'm guessing comes from the hemp, but I could be mistaken about that as I'm not a dirty hemp-eating hippie. Finishes sweet and nutty, biscuit and caramel flavors lingering on the tongue for a while. Pretty decent beer, to my surprise."
"D: All around nice ale. Well-priced and tasty, would be a good purchase anytime for me."
"Nose is sweet and hoppy. Dark amber brown pour with a small off white head. Mild hoppy citrus flavor with caramel overtones. It has a medium light body. Very easy drinkability. All around a decent session beer for anytime - very simple and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: This is highly drinkable and almost a session beer but because of its simplicity I would pick another brew over this one."
"Full and rich mouthfeel, nice and creamy. Tasty and drinkable, thanks to barleywinefiend for sharing."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I would drink it again, the lady kept giving us free pitchers"
"Overall this is a middle of the road beer that certainly has nothing disagreeable about it, but I'm not sure I would order this again."
"Had this about a week ago after work. Poured a reddish brown color with little pearl head that left a small amount of lacing. Smelled of malt and fruity yeast. Tasted of deep malts and fruit. Smooth but a bit fizzy. Could drink if it was the only option, but probably won't reach for this one at the store again."
"I would't session this beer almost to rich of a flavor after two or three."
"The Hemp Ale poured a dark amber color with not much in the way of foam head or lacing. The smell was of spice and malt. The taste was pretty well balanced as far as it being a malt all the way beer with a slight tinge of bitterness on the finish. It was lightly carbonated and you felt a little on the back of the throat. Overall a pretty middle of the road brew."
"Something tells me this beer does better than it would do otherwise because of its name and its gimmick. There's certainly no noticeable impact from its supposed adjuncts, and while it's not an unpleasant brew to drink, it's certainly quite dull."
"Tastes like it smells, in that there just isn't a whole lot going on. Finishes with a bit of chili powder/red pepper. Nonetheless, to call this an herbed/spiced beer seems a bit of a stretch. There is no hemp in here and hop presence is minimal. Spice consists of a subtle pepper heat. Thin in body and offering moderate drinkability. A bit sweet and viscous with little carbonation."
"I was surprised by the dark, red-amber color. nice off-white/tan head. initial taste reminds me of a brown ale, and malty, then the carbonation comes in which helps. but finishes poor for me, sour carmel lingering a bit too long. tastes fine at first, then leaves me disappointed (only because i really enjoy humboldt brewing company's other brews so much)."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, interesting to try it at least once, but I could think of many other beers in the same class with higher drinkability."
"Decent beer. I'm probably drawn to it more by the name than anything else. Sweet taste, followed by some hops, but pretty thin. This tastes like a macro brewed version of a beer that desperately wants to be micro brewed. Overall, just decent, nothing special."
"It's what an Amber light might taste like."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0901-Tim"
"Drinkability: Hemp Ale was better than I expected, though I'd never know it was brewed with something distinct unless it was spelled out. The hemp failed to deliver something unique (for the first time in my life), but it does make for good drinking. It's a well-balanced beer. I think I'll burn a little Nag for the hell of it."
"Not a bad beer, but just not my style. Glad I got to try it though. Was a nice extra."
"(rated May 3, 2007)"
"Good for a one time review, but nothing great."
"Tap @ Clocktower in Mammoth. Pours murky brown with an off-white head. Dank malty aroma with the noticeable vegetable-hemp aroma. Same goes for the taste. BIg caramel malt flavors mixed with peppery hops. The straw/vegetable/hemp flavor is throughout, but doesn't really add anything in a positive way."
"To conclude: An enjoyable beer that will surprise you if you expect anything related to the name. A smooth crisp drink with a bit of an after-bite. Good in moderation."
"Overall: Better then a macro...but not much more then that."
"D: Honestly, better than I thought it would be. I would have this beer again. But not something I would break my neck to find."
"Overall:decent"
"The taste is almost porter-like in a way, dark toasted bread with leaves, a little chocolate, light hoppy-herbal bitterness, and hint of grain. It's smooth and mellow, but blurred, very soft and subdued, and half-way through becomes tiresome. i could see how someone might like it, but it's not really my type."
"D: Not a bad beer, but a novelty item to say the least. The flavor tends to get old after a while."
"Draught at Woodstocks IV. Dark brown with a medium beige head that laces the glass. Roasty and toasty aroma with some herbal quality. The flavor is between a brown ale and a porter, with some chocolate roasted bitterness showing, but remaining pretty smooth. The hemp is subtle, as has been every example I've had, but it adds a nice dimension, and makes for an interesting and drinkable darker ale. medium to lighter body and lighter carbonation."
"Drinkability is not so high due to the flavor profile, but certainly glad I got to try it."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a thin head. I detect a whiff of hops and a little spice. Taste is unique, reminds me of Dr. Pepper? Malt and hops are in balance-neither are significant, I get more spices than hops and malt. Finishes with a little roast? Not sure, mouthfeel is medium and I think the hemp gives the mouthfeel a certain amount of oiliness. Drinkabiity is high."
"Interesting, but nevertheless a novelty. Offers very little as a beer. I'll pass in the future. Anyone want the rest of my six-pack tonight?"
"Typical brown ale with garnet hints and a frothy head that dissipates quickly. Average malt nose - not picking up too much else - dark fruit? Taste was average - I didn't know what to expect from a Hemp Ale in taste or mouthfeel .... sticky icky? Thiner body and average taste - nice very sublte nuttiness not much else. Maybe something for someone new to craft beet to try - great label. Interesting ingredient (hemp) but I didn't get much of it."
"D- I could drink a couple of these with a meal, or on a hot Oakland night."
"D - Would make a great session beer."
"Dark pour that looks basically black, with head that didn't hang around for long at all. Smell was a different sort of dark ripe sweet fruit, and roasted malt-ish. Taste was more nutty and kind of like a nut brown ale, and has slightly low carbonation, making it a touch watery since its body was on the thinner side as well. This wasn't bad, but not what I was expecting, and nothing to go out of the way for, I thought"
"Final Note: I was looking forward to trying this 'novelty' beer, but the 'novelty' quickly wore off"
"I think this the hemp infused beer I have had,poured into a standard pint glass a mix of deep brown and amber a thinner wispy white head atop.Very light aromas I pick up a little spice and brown sugar but really not much going on,flavors are malt tilted no doubt and quite mild a hint of chocolate and roasted nuts with a lingering earthy finish with a cola quality as well.Not much complexity to the beer and very faint hops glad I tried it but to me its just a standard brown ale with a touch of ""herb""."
"If I could get more, I certainly would. This seems like a hype or 'shock' beer marketing wise, but regardless it's a very good beer. I'll look for others from this brewery."
"Great brew. If you see one (especially on-tap), go ahead and give it a try. You just might like it."
"Could drink a whole lot of this stuff, has nice abv and thickness to it"
"It produced a nice, foamy, deep-tan head over an unexpectedly dark beer. The color was a cola-brown with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. The nose was sweet and malty with a slight nuttiness, almost caramelized. Mouthfeel was medium with a lot of sweetness becoming readily apparent on the palate. The finish had more that nutty, roasty, even smoky quality that I had noted on the nose. I wonder how it would go with Hempzels from Lancaster Co. ... Not a bad beer, but a bit sweet for my hophead taste."
"This is not a bad beer, it certainly has an interesting ingredient, but I can't really see this being added to beer on its flavor merits alone."
"22 oz bottle courtesy of srandycarter. Many Thanks! Pours a clear, copper body with a small beige head that leaves some minimal lacing. Aroma is subtle, notes of chocolate and herbal hops. Mouthfeel is light medium with moderate carbonation. Taste is cola and chocolate with some nuttiness and restrained earthy and leafy hops. Didn't really notice any hemp character. A fine drinking brown ale here, but nothing hempy about it."
"Hazy brown in the glass with a smallish head with decent lacing. Smelled of caramel and figs and a little toasted nuts or seeds (I suppose that's hemp seed I'm smelling). Tasted nutty with hints of raisins and nutmeg. Overall a good brown ale and I could definately drink more than a few."
"This is a great session beer that can handle it's own as a micro. Pours a lighter amber (although it actually looks fairly substantial), and follows up with a foamy lingering off-white head. This beer has an unique floral, hoppy smell that translates right into the herbal, fairly aggressive hop character that finishes with light spiced fruit. An ale with a very nice, semi substantial body, that when paired with deli sandwiches laced with herbed mayo, can be a real treat. Makes an interesting appetizer combo with assorted imported olives...Enjoy"
"Md body with a bit too much carb. Average drinkabliltiy. A fairly easy drinking brown."
"Drinkability: It's vaguely interesting... once. I'm thankful that I had the opportunity to buy a single bottle."
"A bit like a brown ale. Nothing special."
"Overall, not as dry as I'd like out of a hoppier beer, but then again this reflects it's growth under of the early American Micro Brown ale stylings with a ton of crystal malts"
"This beer poured a very dark mahogany with a tannish head that dissipated rather quicly. Not sure what I'm smelling...roasted hemp seeds? Definitely a roasted aroma. Taste of roasted malt reminds me of a black beer...but watered down. Mouthfeel is thin which could make this fairly drinkable, but the actual taste leaves nothing for me. Nice to try, but I probably won't be seeking this one out in the future."
"Just a minor step above a macro, IMHO."
"Mouthfeel is spicy and carbonated. A very drinkable ale, nice and fun on a warm spring day."
"D: OK beer I guess."
"D - Even with all the flavors, they blend together well and make this quite drinkable."
"I'm a big fan of spiced beers and have always defended chile, spruce, and other herb beers in the face of aspersions (""they're made for tourists;"" "they're a gimmick""). Humboldt's Hemp Ale hasn't convinced me that those criticisms should be ignored for hemp beers."
"There are no marijuana flavors to speak of and really not much of any flavor. Pretty dull beer that I will pass on in the future."
"As bland as a beer gets. I bought it for the novelty, which is all it was worth."
"D- The malt characteristic has some good depth and flavor but the hop component were singular in flavor. It was interesting as a novelty but with a bit more enhancing it has potential to be a good beer."
"It's none the less drinkable...just not really flavorful."
"This brew definitely suffers from a lack of hops balance. Despite the lack of hops present the brew is not terribly sweet either. The malts are tasty however--whisps of roasted and black patent."
"This is one of those beers that I found tasted better as it warmed up a bit. More flavors came out and I thought the complexity actually was in there it was just hiding....reccomend you try it cold and then let it warm up and note the difference."
"Humboldt Hemp Ale is nothing more and nothing less than an easy drinking, harmless little quaffer that fits squarely into the pale ale style. 'Shock and Awe' it ain't, but it did manage to find its way into my good graces by the second half of the bottle."
"I didn't have much enthusiasm for it, but...it's a serviceable ale, though not to hoop and holler about."
"Starts off with flavors of whiskey-apple malt, and a touch of sweetness. Tinny, resinous hop bite comes in to balance it out. Reminds me of a toned-down Jubelale. So, I like. Medium-bodied feel, coats mouth wellperhaps a little too much carbonation."
"Consumed in October 2004 at the Toronado in San Francisco, CA. Came back from the restroom and said to my best friend. ""Hey, I thought I told you to get me a Hemp Ale"". He said. ""I did""?!?! Confused as I looked at the brew and saw a deep dark red brown beer in front of me. Hell, it almost looked like a dark brown ale in front of me. I didn't expect such a dark coloring. I didn't see the pour, but it still had a considerable head on it and some lacing creeping down the side after a few sips. Tasted a bit bitter. Some heavy malt tastes as well as some fruityness and some hops in there too. Nice carbonation. Didn't really stike me as a great beer. Maybe a decent ot good beer. Wouldn't waste my time with a pint of it on tap again, but at the same time, I would think about it if it went on sale for a good price at the local Safeway. Moderate beer that I am glad I tried."
"Except for the label I didn't notice anything 'hempy' about this ale at all - it's just a pleasantly drinkable dark ale. While it wasn't anything near outstanding it was quite tasty and I'd certainly drink it again. Considering how well they've done with this ale, I'd be very interested in trying their ""Red Nectar"" amber..."
"The beer was very dark, looking a little like a Scottish Ale. The nose is not very noticeable but it looks good. This is a malty beer with a nice bitterness to the aftertaste. I just tasted this after a Road Dog from Flying Dog( a Scottish Ale) so I have to say that this is really a Scottish ale with Hemp. There is a nice balance that almost makes this fall into the Brown Ale category."
"Let's clear up one thing right now, kids. For those of you who think you're getting a ""hemp"" (wink wink!) beer, there is zero chance this brew contains any herb and/or THC. For that to happen, the brewery would have to have on hand hundreds of pounds of buds--no one is going to spend 25 years in the federal pen so you can catch a buzz. On the other hand, if you're looking for a suprisingly drinkable brown ale, this is a great choice. Much better than it has to be."
"It's an interesting beer and it's pretty drinkable."
"I think this is a gimmick brew, despite that it is a good dark ale."
"A simple beer -- not too bad."
"I had this one a few years back. I don't think you are allowed to put hemp products in any food or drink now. I could be wrong. This beer was just a great drinking beer. High quality with great ingredients. I've had a few other things from Humbolt and I think that's the point of this beer. To honor all the hard working rebel farmers who make the best there is."
"Overall I would not drink this on a regular basis. I think it is well made and has some interesting qualities. I would not turn down a free one."
"Poured a frothy white head which didn't last very long. Color is a rich red with a brown tint. Aroma is a creamy malt toastiness with a floral hop balance. Taste is sweet and dark from the malt flavors but there is a nutty character that i believe to be the hemp seeds which is very pleasent. Body is medium which allows the nutty character to come through but the slight hop bitterness leaves a clean finish. Very drinkable and quite pleasent if you are in the mood for a nutty, rich and not roasty dark ale."
"Dark brown color, medium head. A medium bodied brown ale brewed with hemp seed. Nice and malty mellow hops. Did not notice the hemp, but it does seem a little smoother than most brown ales. Nice flavor. Full taste. Mouthfeel is full and round; there is a slight sharpness to it. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty. There is a very slight lingering bitterness. Nice beer."
"Originally sampled on 29 December 2001. I am writing this review from my notes. A slightly sweet flavored, light bodied ale that is, as another reviewer noted, a good session beer. Nothing spectacular, not too bad either. If it were offered to me, I'd drink it, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"The lack of any detectable sound upon opening the bottle was a bit disconcerting. Fortunately, a nice, healthy tan head appeared when it was poured into the glass. It's clear brown. The smell is malty with a fair amount of hop and a bit of spice. The flavor was an enjoyable mix of malt and hops, but it has a fairly strong flavor that is close to tea, leaving me with the feeling that I was drinking a glass of carbonated iced tea with a little hop kick. It's not bad, but it's nothing spectacular."
"Nice color of medium dark amber brown when poured with very little foam and not lace. The smell of roasted malts was pleasant to the nose. The taste was of mild roasted malts and hops. Little on the bitter side. Wish I knew what hemp tasted like so I could pick up the hemp flavor. This beer was just average overall, but still a pleasant all around brew."
"This is the darkest hemp ale I have tasted. Pours a dark clear amber-brown with a might tan head. A malty aroma hints of toffee and toasted malt. Initially the roasted flavor steps forth with a buttery edge. A significant bitterness charges in after the malt an sets up shop for the long-haul linger through the finish. Not as mellow as some other hemp ales, and with a bit less of the buttery character."
"Ale Brewed with Hemp Seed, is what it says on the Bottle. Pours with almost no head, yet had medium carbonation and was my no means flat. Beautiful stunning deep red color when held up to the light. Malty taste to begin with, but has a great hoppy finish, that lingers for sometimes. Really full of flavors that develop as you work your way down the beer. I would say this is as close as you will get to a Herbal/Spiced Red Ale. I like this beer, bags of taste and mouthfeel, and I will definitely buy it again. I have only tried this and the Humboldt Red so far, but 2 hits out of 2 is good enough for me to try all their other beers."
