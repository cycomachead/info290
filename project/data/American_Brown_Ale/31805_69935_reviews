"It really tastes exactly like peanut butter and jelly and toasted bread. Amazing and perfectly crafted.  So good!"
"Very impressive effort here, just tried a bit at EBF15, but clearly a legit take on PB&J ale - sounded off to me at first, but it's actually very well done. Would absolutely seek this out if it were ever available in Maine!"

"EBF sample. Have wanted to try this beer for ages! Finally. Pours a clear, light brownish color. Smells of peanut butter and jelly. It truly does. Simple brown malt bill sort of adds backing to the peanut butter and sweetness of the jelly flavor. The flavor starts off with some malty sweetness and then it turns into peanut butter and jelly sandwich liquified in my mouth. Finishes with a really neat peanutty finish. Lighter bodied. This beer is wacky. How do they do this without using all this artificial flavoring? Or do they use a lot of artificial flavoring? Who knows and sometimes...who cares."

"Chewy, savory entrance with a sweet jelly finish. Are you kidding me?"

"I am a major peanut butter freak (every morning for breakfast) and was all over this when i saw it. Has more of the jelly than the peanut butter in the aroma and flavor. I like the creaminess of it but the body could have been fuller to better showcase the flavors. Interesting mesh but once again, lack of peanut butter makes a brew less than what it is advertised as."

"O - Overall, this beer blew me away. Absurd here..I really wanted to not like the taste after smelling how good it was (just because this beer isnt exactly easy to get) but my goodness. The base is basically lost (a 'brown ale') so one really cant base if off of that. Goodness was this awesome...and it was over 2 weeks old!"

"Such an interesting beer. I've had several things from Funky Buddha and I'm looking forward to my first sip of No Crusts. I have heard fantastic things about it. I had the Bonita Applebum for the first time yesterday and I was blown away by that; and people were saying 'It's great, but it's no No Crusts'."

"O: A very odd beer and glad I was able to try it. Much better than the Short's take on it as everyone I've had by them as they had a faint plastic note to them. Pretty well executed, but the small pour I had was enough for me. Thanks, Todd!"
""
"O - Good beer that tastes just as advertised. Imagine someone spreading grape jelly on top of a nutter butter and you get this beer. It is good but just like the Kuhnhenn breakfast beers about a glass of this is enough."
"Overall: I'd drink this till I die."
"Pours a murky dark honey brown with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, peanut butter, jelly, and bread aromas. Taste is much the same with peanut and jelly flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a spot on peanut butter and jelly sandwich aroma that doesn't exactly translate the same to the taste."

"O- I wouldn't say this was my favorite beer I've had or something that I would drink all the time, but definitely one of the more unique and enjoyable ones I've experienced. I think the execution on this was superb and they nailed the peanut butter and jelly smell/taste right to the tee. The best comparison I could make with this is with Jelly Belly jelly beans, it' amazing how they can make it taste so much like the real thing. I wouldn't say this beer is for everyone but I definitely recommend checking it out especially if you are looking for a unique interesting beer or you just like PB&J sandwiches."

"On tap at Churchkey. Served in a mini snifter. Pours a moderate brown color with a short head and a bit of lacing. The nose carries some peanut butter and jelly. Surprise, surprise. The peanut butter component takes over, with just a bit of berry in the background. Flavor has mild fruit and more peanut. A bit one-dimensional, and not my favorite dimension at that. Medium body with a semi-dry finish. Just okay."

"Medium bodied with a nice balance of toasted peanut, sweet, slightly tart jelly and fresh bread.  Roasted with lots of peanut flavor up front along with slightly smoked malt undertones.  More peanut than peanut butter but it still replicates the flavor pretty well.  This is followed by fresh baked bread (including  crust) and a really prominent sweet, tart jam presence in the finish.   The jelly portion of the beer is really overpowering after a few ounces and provides a lingering unpleasant aftertaste.  The subtle roasted malt notes were the only element that made it taste like a brown ale.  Other than that it tastes more like a  good alcoholic dessert drink than a beer.  Decent but nowhere near as good as some of their other experimental beers."

"Peanuts with minimal salt compose the flavor. Grape jelly is an afterthought, serving as an accent to everything else going on here. Quite interesting, unique, and enjoyable. Can't drink more than a few oz of this, but it's a great experience in a glass -- particularly if you home brew."
"The beer is russet brown with a half inch of head. The aroma is shocking and hilarious. I would literally think one was holding a PB&J sandwich under my nose if this were a blind test. Very impressive. The flavor follows suit. I wish I could go more in depth, but this is a straightforward brew - it smells and tastes like a PB&J beer. Light to medium bodied. Not something I would drink in quantity, but I highly recommend trying this if you have the opportunity."
"The feel is slick and decent in body, overall this beer is good in small doses but there is no way I could have drank more than the taster of 6oz or so that I got."
"O: Not quite the stunner I was expecting. There's nothing directly wrong with the nose or flavors here, yet this isn't as expressive as I would have liked. A decent gimmick beer, no more."
""
"Beer tastes like peanuts, salt and dirt. Nope, not loving it. I get it but not every concept makes for a good beer. Too much peanut, too much salt, too much of everything. There is already a Short's brewing company out there making horrible beers, give up."
"The mouthfeel is thin and a little watery with low carbonation. Overall, it was a cool and interesting beer. It tasted exactly like peanuts to me which wasn't bad, but maybe a little odd. It was nice to try once but not something I'd want to drink often."
""
""
"An interesting beer, no doubt, but I just didn't really find myself digging it. Still glad I was able to try it..."
""
"Pours a dark brown with a thin off-white head. The smell on this beer is absolutely phenomenal - as pretty much everyone has said, it smells exactly like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in an incredible way. The flavor isn't quite as impressive, and I wish there was more jelly going on. The peanut really takes over the flavor and mixes nicely with the bread-y malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer earns an A+ for creativity. It's not a beer I'd want to drink a ton of, but a 4 oz. pour was perfect. Honestly, if it had more grape in the flavor, this beer might be amazing, instead it was an impressively successful experiment."
"Dark coppertinted brown, full fluffy khaki bubbles, decent retention. As advertised, leads with a combination of fresh roasted and ground nuts, creamy peanut butter, notes of dark berries solid but not as in force as the nuttyness with a bready malt backbone. Taste brings a more balanced combination of nuts and fruit, bready malts still present with some moderate toast charachter. Medium bodied, creamy. Another fantastic food-centric brew from these guys."
""
""
"No Crusts looks semi black but is dark brown in color with a small amount of off white foam on top leaving small splotches here and there. A brown ale indeed. Smell is peanut butter and jelly. A lot of nuts in the scent with some jam backing. small hint of roast with malt backing. Taste is all nuts with some jelly/jam. Not your typical brown ale, but the base is not totally lost. Feel is pretty light with some bubbles but not super carbed up. I could go for a pint of this and enjoy every drop. Not your typical flavor from a simple style, but what's advertised is delivered so I deem this a success."
""
"O- if you're looking for a PBJ beer, this will do it for you. It's a nice novelty, but I'm not sure I could really drink more than one in a sitting"
"O-an interesting brown ale with novel flavors but wish it had a little more body"
"My only comparison to a PB&J beer is from Spring House Brewing Company and they're both awesome incarnations of the classic childhood sandwich. An absolute must try if you get the chance. Thanks for sending the awesome beers to Philly guys!"
"This was definitely my least favorite of Funky Buddha's brews. Still good, but my least favorite."
"O - A nice beer but out of the four offered, I had this number three of the four and that is only because I am not a hop person so the ginger IPA ranks fourth by default. A great event today, thanks Matt and the gang frm FB. Please come back again!"

"Pours a dark amber with a thin white ring. Oh my goodness. Straight-up PB&J. This is sick. Earthy peanuts, roasted malt, baked bread, and grape jelly. You can make out every distinct aromas in this beer. Wonka-esque. Taste is similarly impressive, and once again you can taste each individual component somehow. Roasted peanuts, sweet grape jelly, toasted bread. Insane. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly sticky, with a medium body and good carbonation. Hands-down the highlight of the day. Amazing doesn't even begin to describe it. I want more."

"Overall: Really enjoyed the way this comes together in the finish, balancing out both the peanut butter and jelly elements; as unusual a beer as you will find"
""

"Medium body, well carbonated, a little sticky on the tongue. This was another ""whoa, are they serious?"" moments for me at the Funky Buddha table during the fest. Such an awesome beer experience."
""
"Overall: This is an awesome beer. I wouldn't want to drink it every day, but when I'm in the mood for a beer that tastes like peanut butter and jelly, this would be my go to."
"o - Overall I thought this was a really cool beer. A bit of a ""gimmick"" beer, but it works well and was one of the cooler beers I had at EBF. Nose really smells exactly like a PB sandwich, and it's easy to drink. Would love to have it again."
""
"Overall very nice, nice jammy preserve mixed berry grape thing, nice bready notes, nice peanutbutter although I wish that was a bit more, on top of a great base beer, which is still preserved so well done!"
""
"This beer poured out as a really nice looking brown color with a light tan head on top. The smell of the beer was loaded with Peanuts Butter aromas and some minimal grains. The taste of the beer was just out of this world really. I can't stress the fact that this beer tastes like a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich. It's got the bread, it's the PB&J to the fullest level it possibly can. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich. Overall this beer is just great... It's something that you need to experience for yourself. I'm very glad to have tried this and I hope that one day I'll get to visit FBL to have more."

"O – Had big expectations here and this lived up to the hype. Retained a beer taste but still had a great PB&J taste. Very nice offering from the guys at the Buddha."
"This is what I imagine Short's was aiming for when they brewed PB&J. If they could ever release a batch that wasn't infected, maybe I could confirm that."
"On tap at Funky Buddha - This beer is great!!! I never like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and still do not like them. However, this beer makes me want to like them. Lot of peanuts and jelly in the nose. The taste is just how wish a peanut butter and jelly sandwich should taste like. Keep up the solid work, Funky Buddha."
"Overall: The flavor is good, but the aroma is unreal. I couldn't take my nose out of the glass. Great stuff."
"O-Great beer. Would love to get some more bottles."
"dark brown pour, just menacing looking with a huge tan head that just towered over the top of the glass. Fading slowly it left behind tons of side glass lacing and a huge amount of spider like webs. Aroma was sweet and spicy at the same time. Notes of rye, brown sugar, molasses like touches and hints of coffee are all coming through very clearly. Each sip now seem to get a bit more complex then the one before it, really very well done here. Rich chocolate notes blending well now with huge malts and a touch of rye that are just fantastic. Light suagry finish with a touch of hops in the back, just enough to push it over the edge for me. ABV is very well hidden and had no issues at all with polishing this one off."
"O - really interesting, and not at all bad."
"3.5 D: Good beer, but the mouthfeel is far too light and the taste is lacking power."
"Overall, the beer I am drinking is just not that good. I would love to try a keg at the source though."
"O-very good. Nice representation of the name."
"Overall, I can see what they were going for. I personally didn't like it too much, but I applaud them for their creativity. I'm glad I got to try this beer and see what all the hype is about."
"For what it's worth, I thought this absolutely crushed Short's Uber Goober. The incorporation of fruit into this beer is masterful, and though this could have easily veered off into novelty territory it is harmoniously balanced. Ryan, you are a gentleman and, just as important, an alchemist."
"Disappointing given how amazing maple bacon was but then again... not everything can be a hit"
"I wanted this to be good, I really did. But it wasn't. It was easily the worst beer at the share. Hopefully the other Funky Buddha beers are worth a damn. Not that I would trade for any of them."
"Even though this bottle was bad I am rating the beer as I had it. If I get another in the future I will re-rate it. So for now, this is one awful beer."
"Served in a Chimay glass filled to the brim (so no head). Aroma of roasted peanuts is prevalent as well at the front of the taste. When you swallow it switches to grape jelly - pretty unbelievable actually and the reason behind giving it a 5 for taste b/c it does what it says. The flavors are so right on. Mouthfeel is average with light carbonation. This is a fun one, but I wouldn't buy it on a regular basis b/c I want a beer, not a sweet liquid snack."
"O - Smells like peanut butter and tastes like jelly. Good for what it is, but it's still a gimmick."
"I know this brewery is getting a lot of hype right now... I hope the hype carries them to expansion, because I want to try more of their beer. This beer is good enough to be a fridge staple for me-- not ""I would gladly buy this again," but ""I would make a serious effort not to be without it this in my fridge," which is not light praise. If I lived in Boca Raton, I would be a fixture at Funky Buddha."
"On tap at the Funky Buddha. Murky reddish brown pour with a small white head. I thought the MBCP nose was incredible but the No Crust is down right insane. Total freakin’ chunky roasted peanut butter with undercurrents of dried berries. The taste is so cool. Massive peanut butter flavors offset by mixed berry jam, apricots, and blackberries. Kudos to Kevin, Ryan, and the rest of the Buddha crew...."
"Maybe I had a bad bottle? I dont know, but from their other offerings i have tried and rated, this was a huge letdown."
"O - Very enjoyable! Destroys the Short's version of PBJ. Like I said, I prefer a liquid lunch, so no crust works for me! A must-try if you're into unique beers. Not something to have over and over again though."
"Massive thanks goes out to my boy beeruser this one as a part of my birthday weekend! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured red-brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, peanut butter, jelly, and bread. The flavor was of sweet malt, peanut butter, jelly, bread, and subtle fruit. It had a mild feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. If I am honest, this thing really did taste and smell like a PB&J sandwich... Almost scary how close it was. The peanut butter flavor sticks to your palate well after you sip is taken (almost like it is stuck to the roof of your mouth). No a lot bad can be said about this beer in any way, shape, or form. Really glad I got the chance to try this one!"
"D - It's a gimmicky, but an excellent one. Much better than Short's PB&J or Uber Goober. I'm curious to see how this will age, as I can imagine the intense peanut aroma fading quickly. I was sad about how fast we finished the bottle and wish that I had bottle of my own. Hopefully Funky Buddha will make more down the road."
"O - For what this is, a PB&J beer, it's fantastic. I imagine this is hard to pull off and they hit a winning combination. Unique and definitely worth seeking out and trying, particularly if you are into trying unusual beers."
"Thanks to Casey or this bottle. Nice dark brown with light lacing. The smell is as described, peanut butter and jelly. Peanuts is stronger than the jelly which is more hidden. Taste is roasty, buttery, with a light tropical jelly taste. Lighter mouthfeel than would have expected but still good. Overall the beer delivers as expected for a specialty beer. Would gladly drink this again and recommend for those who seek the unique styles."
"Thanks to Casey for this... pours a nice dark amber brown, decent tan head... the nose is all roasted peanuts, salty, really great authentic peanuts, the jelly is hidden, don’t get much but there is a sweet fruity note, smells great... the first is all roasted salty peanuts, its awesome, after that the taste dies down a bit, becomes a touch watery and dead on the finish, a touch of alcohol... really crushable the best pbj and beer I’ve had, destroys Short’s version... for this type of beer, this is one of the best ones out there"
"This beer is perfectly carbonated and very drinkable. All in all, this is a treat. No problems polishing off the bomber and I would drink again if the opportunity arises."
" I don't feel that I could drink more than one of these in a sitting, but it is definitely a nice treat for a change. I will take this beer over a PB&J sandwich any day. The Buddha definitely nailed this beer spot on."
"O - It has been awhile since I tasted a beer that floored me just on one sip alone. The creativity in this beer is amazing and I wish everyone could taste this just once. Nice job, Funky Buddha!"
"Overall I'm supremely impressed with this beer. As a homebrewer I've just found my next challenge. Great job guys!"
"Deep brown body with mahogany edges and a thin off-white head that quickly turned to lace. The aroma exudes peanut butter and bready sweetness. Reminds me of the PB&J sandwiches I lived off of in Middle school. Flavor delivers a bold peanut butter note with a fruity strawberry-like finish. Plenty of residual peanut flavor in the aftertaste but the flash of fruit comes through nicely. Sweet underlying toasted grain and maybe some subtle caramel. Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Juicy mouthfeel with a slightly dry finish. Absolutely spot on in flavor. PB&J in a bottle. Simple and not as cloying as I thought it might be. Amazed at how well put together this is. Funky Buddha does it again. "
"I missed this the first time it was served a couple of weeks ago, so I was excited to have a second opportunity to try it. First, let me say that if I had been blindfolded I would not be able to tell this beer from a PB&J sandwich based on smell. It was that spot-on. For a brown ale named ""No Crusts PB&J", this beer is everything I expected. The only reason I gave it a 4 for tast is because I am not a PB&J sandwich fan. However, I would definitely have No Crusts again, though not in large quantities."
"No carbonation, head or lacing, the reason for average on appearance. Something about bubbles and head, takes my eyes to a happy place. Seriously tastes and smells like a PB&J sandwich after coming out of a blender. Incredibly unique. Not thick making it easy drinking, until the sweetness in it creeps up. Somewhat difficult finishing the last bit of my second one. A must try for any beer drinker, even if liquid PB&J is not your speed..."
"Ok i'll write a little more. The nose on this beer is beyond belief 10 years ago of what I thought a beer could be. Go to a store that has the machine that grinds peanut butter in front of you and stick your nose as close as you can to it, that is exactly what this beer smells like and tastes like!"
"O: The only knock I can give this beer is the drinkability. Probably couln't have more than a couple due to the sweetness, but overall this is outstanding. One of the more original brews I've had. The Buddah is brewing up some kick ass originality. Skal."
"O: first beer I've reviewed from them. It may sound weird, but this tastes amazing! This tastes exactly like a PB&J sandwich! Definitely try if you get the chance. Quality coming out of this small operation!"
"Delicious until the end, the beer indeed offers the taste of PB&J (smooth and sweet) without the crusts (no roasty/malty/wheaty/bready flavors anywhere!). Great beer to try, but how many could I drink? That's a good question. How many PB&J sandwiches could I eat? I think its rich flavors might overwhelm me before I got to a second pint, no matter how easy to drink the beer itself is."
"A friend of mine told me that there was a beer that tasted just like peanut butter and jelly. Part of me thought that it would be terrible, but a much larger part of me wanted to have a glass. It is exactly what you would expect, the aroma is mostly peanut, but there is a fruit taste well blended with the peanut taste. In other words, it tastes exactly what you would want a peanut butter jelly beer to taste like. Personally I wouldn't have it as a session beer because I'm not a huge fan of jelly, but I think that everyone should have at least one glass of this beer. If you like peanut butter and jelly this beer is a must have."
"This review is dedicated to my good friend ""Pete""."
"Overall, if you like semi-sweet beers this could be a solid session beers. The ABV is not too strong and it is a very drinkable. I am sure they will tap out of it today so If you are in the area head over and give it a shot."
"While I wouldn't be able to drink a bunch of these in one sitting, I will say that there isn't a single thing I would change about this beer."
"This beer is just redonkulous. People were telling me that it was exactly like a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich, but I was still a little skeptical. I'm now a true believe that everything about this beer is straight up a PB&J in a glass. The aroma and flavor is just so spot on that is nuts, literally. The peanuts are pretty dominate here but once you take your first sip you get the sweet jelly flavor as well. Needless to say this beer is awesome and I highly recommend it. Takes you right back to childhood."
