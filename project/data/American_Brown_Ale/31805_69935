4.26,1.7,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.5,"EBF sample. Have wanted to try this beer for ages! Finally. Pours a clear, light brownish color. Smells of peanut butter and jelly. It truly does. Simple brown malt bill sort of adds backing to the peanut butter and sweetness of the jelly flavor. The flavor starts off with some malty sweetness and then it turns into peanut butter and jelly sandwich liquified in my mouth. Finishes with a really neat peanutty finish. Lighter bodied. This beer is wacky. How do they do this without using all this artificial flavoring? Or do they use a lot of artificial flavoring? Who knows and sometimes...who cares.","VelvetExtract","Mar 22, 2015"

Smell is of malt, peanut butter, jelly, and bread aromas. Taste is much the same with peanut and jelly flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a spot on peanut butter and jelly sandwich aroma that doesn't exactly translate the same to the taste.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 24, 2013"

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer earns an A+ for creativity. It's not a beer I'd want to drink a ton of, but a 4 oz. pour was perfect.

3.76,-10.3,3,4.5,4,3,3,"Served in a Chimay glass filled to the brim (so no head). Aroma of roasted peanuts is prevalent as well at the front of the taste. When you swallow it switches to grape jelly - pretty unbelievable actually and the reason behind giving it a 5 for taste b/c it does what it says. The flavors are so right on. Mouthfeel is average with light carbonation. This is a fun one, but I wouldn't buy it on a regular basis b/c I want a beer, not a sweet liquid snack.","Delraypete","Jul 29, 2011"

4.52,7.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"I know this brewery is getting a lot of hype right now... I hope the hype carries them to expansion, because I want to try more of their beer. This beer is good enough to be a fridge staple for me-- not ""I would gladly buy this again," but ""I would make a serious effort not to be without it this in my fridge," which is not light praise. If I lived in Boca Raton, I would be a fixture at Funky Buddha.","Pahn","Jul 23, 2011"
4.24,1.2,4,5,4,4,4,"On tap at the Funky Buddha. Murky reddish brown pour with a small white head. I thought the MBCP nose was incredible but the No Crust is down right insane. Total freakin’ chunky roasted peanut butter with undercurrents of dried berries. The taste is so cool. Massive peanut butter flavors offset by mixed berry jam, apricots, and blackberries. Kudos to Kevin, Ryan, and the rest of the Buddha crew....","dboon","Jul 12, 2011"

4.15,-1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"O - Very enjoyable! Destroys the Short's version of PBJ. Like I said, I prefer a liquid lunch, so no crust works for me! A must-try if you're into unique beers. Not something to have over and over again though.","Sean9689","Jul 10, 2011"
4.42,5.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Massive thanks goes out to my boy beeruser this one as a part of my birthday weekend! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured red-brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, peanut butter, jelly, and bread. The flavor was of sweet malt, peanut butter, jelly, bread, and subtle fruit. It had a mild feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. If I am honest, this thing really did taste and smell like a PB&J sandwich... Almost scary how close it was. The peanut butter flavor sticks to your palate well after you sip is taken (almost like it is stuck to the roof of your mouth). No a lot bad can be said about this beer in any way, shape, or form. Really glad I got the chance to try this one!","thagr81us","Jul 10, 2011"
4.49,7.2,4,5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"D - It's a gimmicky, but an excellent one. Much better than Short's PB&J or Uber Goober. I'm curious to see how this will age, as I can imagine the intense peanut aroma fading quickly. I was sad about how fast we finished the bottle and wish that I had bottle of my own. Hopefully Funky Buddha will make more down the road.","MasterSki","Jul 09, 2011"
3.93,-6.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"O - For what this is, a PB&J beer, it's fantastic. I imagine this is hard to pull off and they hit a winning combination. Unique and definitely worth seeking out and trying, particularly if you are into trying unusual beers.","AgentZero","Jul 09, 2011"
4.29,2.4,4,5,4,3.5,4.5,"Thanks to Casey or this bottle. Nice dark brown with light lacing. The smell is as described, peanut butter and jelly. Peanuts is stronger than the jelly which is more hidden. Taste is roasty, buttery, with a light tropical jelly taste. Lighter mouthfeel than would have expected but still good. Overall the beer delivers as expected for a specialty beer. Would gladly drink this again and recommend for those who seek the unique styles.","spycow","Jul 04, 2011"
4.34,3.6,4,5,4.5,2,4.5,"Thanks to Casey for this... pours a nice dark amber brown, decent tan head... the nose is all roasted peanuts, salty, really great authentic peanuts, the jelly is hidden, don’t get much but there is a sweet fruity note, smells great... the first is all roasted salty peanuts, its awesome, after that the taste dies down a bit, becomes a touch watery and dead on the finish, a touch of alcohol... really crushable the best pbj and beer I’ve had, destroys Short’s version... for this type of beer, this is one of the best ones out there","jrallen34","Jun 30, 2011"

5,19.3,5,5,5,5,5," I don't feel that I could drink more than one of these in a sitting, but it is definitely a nice treat for a change. I will take this beer over a PB&J sandwich any day. The Buddha definitely nailed this beer spot on.","TheCervezaChica","0"

4.9,16.9,5,5,5,4,5,"Deep brown body with mahogany edges and a thin off-white head that quickly turned to lace. The aroma exudes peanut butter and bready sweetness. Reminds me of the PB&J sandwiches I lived off of in Middle school. Flavor delivers a bold peanut butter note with a fruity strawberry-like finish. Plenty of residual peanut flavor in the aftertaste but the flash of fruit comes through nicely. Sweet underlying toasted grain and maybe some subtle caramel. Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Juicy mouthfeel with a slightly dry finish. Absolutely spot on in flavor. PB&J in a bottle. Simple and not as cloying as I thought it might be. Amazed at how well put together this is. Funky Buddha does it again. ","electrobunny","Jun 27, 2011"
4.42,5.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"I missed this the first time it was served a couple of weeks ago, so I was excited to have a second opportunity to try it. First, let me say that if I had been blindfolded I would not be able to tell this beer from a PB&J sandwich based on smell. It was that spot-on. For a brown ale named ""No Crusts PB&J", this beer is everything I expected. The only reason I gave it a 4 for tast is because I am not a PB&J sandwich fan. However, I would definitely have No Crusts again, though not in large quantities.","bbqdude","Jun 27, 2011"
4.78,14.1,3,5,5,5,4.5,"No carbonation, head or lacing, the reason for average on appearance. Something about bubbles and head, takes my eyes to a happy place. Seriously tastes and smells like a PB&J sandwich after coming out of a blender. Incredibly unique. Not thick making it easy drinking, until the sweetness in it creeps up. Somewhat difficult finishing the last bit of my second one. A must try for any beer drinker, even if liquid PB&J is not your speed...","polisanl","Jun 26, 2011"
5,19.3,5,5,5,5,5,"Ok i'll write a little more. The nose on this beer is beyond belief 10 years ago of what I thought a beer could be. Go to a store that has the machine that grinds peanut butter in front of you and stick your nose as close as you can to it, that is exactly what this beer smells like and tastes like!","calcio360jrd","Jun 25, 2011"
4.54,8.4,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: The only knock I can give this beer is the drinkability. Probably couln't have more than a couple due to the sweetness, but overall this is outstanding.

4.59,9.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: first beer I've reviewed from them. It may sound weird, but this tastes amazing! This tastes exactly like a PB&J sandwich! Definitely try if you get the chance. Quality coming out of this small operation!","steve8robin","Jun 12, 2011"
4.52,7.9,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Delicious until the end, the beer indeed offers the taste of PB&J (smooth and sweet) without the crusts (no roasty/malty/wheaty/bready flavors anywhere!). Great beer to try, but how many could I drink? That's a good question. How many PB&J sandwiches could I eat? I think its rich flavors might overwhelm me before I got to a second pint, no matter how easy to drink the beer itself is.","vdoz3","Jun 11, 2011"
4.74,13.1,4,5,5,4,4.5,"A friend of mine told me that there was a beer that tasted just like peanut butter and jelly. Part of me thought that it would be terrible, but a much larger part of me wanted to have a glass. It is exactly what you would expect, the aroma is mostly peanut, but there is a fruit taste well blended with the peanut taste. In other words, it tastes exactly what you would want a peanut butter jelly beer to taste like. Personally I wouldn't have it as a session beer because I'm not a huge fan of jelly, but I think that everyone should have at least one glass of this beer. If you like peanut butter and jelly this beer is a must have.","emeister1","Jun 11, 2011"

4.87,16.2,4.5,5,5,4,5,"This beer is just redonkulous. People were telling me that it was exactly like a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich, but I was still a little skeptical. I'm now a true believe that everything about this beer is straight up a PB&J in a glass. The aroma and flavor is just so spot on that is nuts, literally. The peanuts are pretty dominate here but once you take your first sip you get the sweet jelly flavor as well. Needless to say this beer is awesome and I highly recommend it. Takes you right back to childhood.","dimenhetfield","0"
