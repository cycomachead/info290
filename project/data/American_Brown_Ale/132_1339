This is a great smelling beer, if you like hazelnut. The taste is very nice, reminiscent of hazelnut flavoured coffee, which so popular in the early 1990s. This is a good beer, for sure, but I'm not sure if it is any better than other traditional Browns like Moose Drool.","Bunman3","Feb 16, 2015"

Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped that leaves some small 'circle' spots that stick to the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts, hazelnuts with some brown sugar. Bit more going on with the taste as the hazelnuts and malts are right up front with the sip followed by some light caramel malts. Lots of flavor and goes down easy.. A very tasty brew with lots of great flavor. medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Great job Rogue!","BeerWithMike","Jan 15, 2015"

Maybe I'm used to drinking beers that are a bit more full bodied, or maybe I'm just not a huge fan of this beer; I don't know. I would drink it again, I just wouldn't be in any hurry to do so.","TheItalianStallion","Sep 16, 2014"

Nice nutty aroma, with hints of coffee. Sweet flavor on the palette but not too sweet, nutty caramel and toffee flavors. Smooth and unobtrusive mouth feel. An outstanding beer in an under appreciated style, would definitely recommend anytime, but especially as a lighter desert style beer.","fitzIPAtrick","Jul 27, 2014"

4.57,12.3,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.75,"A personal favorite of mine. The appearance is a dark brown with a very thick head. The smell is great with sweet notes from the malt paired with the earthy tones from the hazelnuts. The taste is great, with such a delicious combination of sweetness and heavy nuttiness. It works well as both a desert beer as well as something to drink with spicy food. The mouthfeel is just the right thickness for me, has a big body but is not syrupy. Love this one.","WhiteHillsStore","Jun 30, 2014"

A very sweet beer, if that 's not your thing look elsewhere. Not bitter at any point, smooth, nutty & sweet throughout. This is an amazing beer, could have one with your oatmeal or your pork chops.

It might be a little on the sweet side for some people, but it's a great brown. A nice honey flavor can also be detected. As always let it warm up a little from ice cold and it'll really blossom in flavor and smell. Love the mouthfeel also, a nice level of carbonation and a flavor that doesn't stay forever in your mouth.","AUGRAD06","Jan 13, 2014"

That might just be my opinion based on how hoppy the beers I have been drinking recently are. Dark brown, this ale is not translucent in the slightest. Didn't get much on the smell. However, the taste I remembered being not quite as delicious as this the last time I tried it. The hazelnut is coming through really nicely, and for not having enjoyed a beer this dark in a while, I am pretty happy with this one. Malty sweetness with the hazelnut flavor is just divine, and its backed by a nice hop presence. Carbonation was meh, no freshness date on this bottle, probably the only drawback to Rogue. A great ale. Can see why it is so popular","laglocal","Oct 24, 2013"

4.08,0.2,4,4,4,4.25,4.25,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its feel and drinkability. While the aroma and flavoring were both nicely inclusive, rich in depth, and agreeable, what really stood out was how quickly it disappeared from our glasses. All of the notes you would expect to be there are easily found, with sweet and sour brown malts, chocolate roast, and rich hazelnut extract. These are found repeatedly across the spectrums of both aroma and taste, and are consistent throughout the tasting. Then the slurp hits you. It is velour, popping like cotton, pulling each sip further down into bubbly ease and happiness. This helps to make up for slightly lesser explosiveness in the aforementioned arenas, keeping it flowing and extremely drinkable. This is a great, easy beer for the style, and one we’ve really enjoyed.","TheBrewo","Sep 07, 2013"

The body doesn't quite match the flavors - I'd like things to be a bit thicker, but maybe I'm asking for too much from a 6.2% ABV brown ale. Not a bad beer, but not a very good one, either. Even minus the oxidation, the flavors weren't working for me the way they seem to be for others. Would've liked a touch more hazelnut and a bit more sweetness.

The Shakespeare, FestiveAle, Chocolate & Double Choc. stouts, Dead Guy and Glen were great, too. The American Amber, XS Imp. Porter were very far from. The rest are middling offerings.

Pours slightly hazy deep reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big caramel, hazelnut, chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, light floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of the malt notes with the big hazelnut presence. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, hazelnut, brown bread, light floral, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; and lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, brown sugar, hazelnut, and brown bread on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with only a moderate amount of hazelnut; not nearly as robust in flavor as I expected from the aromas; and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that was good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good flavored brown ale. Good balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering. May have been an old bottle, but there is no way to know for sure.","superspak","Apr 30, 2013"

It lacks any head to speak of and leaves no lacing to the glass. The nose is a good strong, sweet malt with some woody, earthy hops undertones. It has a strong smell of toasted cereal and just a hint of that hazelnut. The flavor is just too much hazelnut to me. The hops do a good job of cutting down the double whammy of malty sweetness and the hazelnut, which in this case tastes almost like Starbucks hazelnut syrup has been added. Finishes dry with a pretty good palate feel. I hesitated to review this beer due to my growing distaste for hazelnut purely because I'm sick of all the flavored syrups at coffee bars. Therefore, I really tried to review this one with the style in mind first of all, and my palate second of all (which is what I try to do no matter what). I even when back for a second round just to finalize my thoughts. I really think that overall, the hazelnut was just too much and overwhelmed the natural malt goodness of a good brown.","estlinska","Apr 07, 2013"

Smell is a blend of carmel, brown sugar, roasted malts and nuts. Very inviting. Taste follows the nose and adds a level of complexity that makes this beer special. The carmel notes on the front give way to a nutty, coffee, roasted malts flavor that is spot on. A nice hop finish and this one is tough to set down. Feel is spot on as well. Creamy, silky on the tongue and the perfect level of carbonation. Overall- One of the best, if not the best brown I have had. Great combination of malts, nuts, carmel, sugar and hops. So easy to drink, very sessionable and a great effort from Rogue. A must have-","TheDinger","Jan 21, 2013"

The flavor is to my liking but I found it just a tad too dominant. I would've love some more balance here. Nevertheless, a good solid brew.

A playful hazelnut and maple syrup nose hints at the powerful hazelnut and hop flavor in the brew. Silky smooth caramel aftertaste with a bit of bitter toffee as well. This is an amazing fall/winter brew that matches with the changing leaves outside, making me reminisce on the whole experience. As far as brown ales go, this is one of the best i've ever had, not being overly hazelnut-driven and definitely sticking to its category. Definitely a recommendation!","shigg85","Sep 25, 2012"

One of our local pubs has a constantly rotating tap, but this one has stayed on as long as I've been going there. It's a flavorful beer but because it's not overwhelmingly bold, it's a great beer to pass off to your friends, especially those who often reach for a Newcastle.","TheRealBigC","Jul 28, 2012"

Light and sweet. Slightly dry, but only enough to even things out. Light hazelnut flavor which hides the sweet base. Finishes nutty and sweet.","VncentLIFE","Jun 30, 2012"

The nose is somewhat sweet and malt with a touch of nuttiness, almost in a syrup type of manner. The flavors are a big improvement. It's malty with hints of caramel, toffee, and light butterscotch with a lot of hazelnut. The hazelnut even flows into the after taste and doesn't leave for a couple minutes. It has great, great flavor for the style. It drinks light and sweet with a subtly dry finish. This is one of the best brown ales you can find in my opinion. This beer may be an acquired taste but if you like coffee or nutty flavors this beer is for you.","aasher","Jun 02, 2012"

Served in a tumbler pint, the beer pours an amber-caramel coloring with a low profile, filmy, small bubbled head that clings to the edge of the surface. The nose is just as amazing as I remember it being in the bottle, with a creamy, buttery blend of rich hazelnut, caramel, and an overall roasted quality. Flavors are a light, smooth blend of Nutella and a biscuity backbone. It almost tastes like caramel popcorn soaked in a hazelnut blended coffee. Super smooth flavors that remain light, and the crisp body make this a ridiculously easy drinker. The aftertaste is nutty and sweet, with a sugary kiss at the very end. The finish is subtly sweet, with a sugary and rich hazelnut linger that entices the palate to continue drinking. This is a tremendous beer, and one of the better Browns I've ever had.","GarthDanielson","Mar 27, 2012"

The hazelnut addition adds a excellent flavor and is enough to set it apart from the rest. Maybe a little more malt and hop woudl be nice cause this beer still is 6.2%, so its not like its a light 4-5% so a little more kick would work well.","wvsabbath","Feb 16, 2012"

4.55,11.8,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a medium brown color with a cream head that stands 2 fingers tall in my duvel tulip. Head recedes to a film with a ring around the edge of my glass. As I drink it leaves some rings of lacing in my glass. Smell is of bread, toffee, hazlenut; not particularly roasty smelling, but smooth and malty without being too sweet. In the taste I get the hazlenut flavors and then a clean pop of caramel. The end of the taste has a slightly deeper, darker malt profile, maybe a tough of chocolate in there. Only a touch of roasted flavor comes out. Body is on the thicker side, just right for a brown ale, and the carbonation is not too agressive; making this a very smooth beer. I really loved this, I think it has become my favorite brown ale.","gkunkle","Feb 16, 2012"

It's just a hair on the bitter side. I'm not a huge fan, but I've had worse. This is obviously a personal preference, so I'm not going to dock it too much. It has a nice feel to it, almost a little creamy. The texture and the ABV lead to a highly drinkable beer.

It is a bit on the sweet side, but I think it adds lots of character to the beer. It is not too sweet like other beers I have encountered. It is also not too bitter.

They don’t sell this as a porter, a stout, or even an imperial ale; it’s a brown ale or a “nectar,” as the bottle puts it. While this may not be the thickest, most jaw-dropping beer you’d ever have, they do work the flavors out really well. It’s a very pleasant drinking experience, especially as a accompaniment to food; if you need something sugary enough to satisfy your sweet tooth during a meal, but light enough to be refreshing, this beer’s for you.","BarryMFBurton","Aug 06, 2011"

The brewer went for balance here, but I think it would have been interesting to go for richness instead. I don't think the hazelnut flavors complement the hops very well, but they do complement the malt. Combining hazelnut with a sweeter, richer beer that has more residual malt would be interesting.

Poured out very brown, almost like a wood stain of some kind, little head that tried to hold on till the end but left some lacing. Right off, the smell sucked me in, it was very sweet, nutty, chocolate, coffee and some malt. You can definitively tell there is hazelnut in there...the first sip was astonishing. Sweet, but not too much, lots of hazelnut with some chocolate and coffee. The thing that made this beer stand out is that it was paired with a final bitterness that didn't cover up the sweetness. But rather complimented it just enough so you knew you weren't drinking an iced mocha morning shit, but a BEER!

The aroma was of a nutty caramel malt and a doughy yeast with a nice note of hazelnut, brown sugar and a ever so light touch of coffee. It tasted lightly sweet with hints of caramel and coffee in the beginning. Then it matured into a very malty-nutty flavor with the hazelnut being the most pronounced at the finish, although the flavor could of lasted a little longer on the taste buds. Mouthfeel was medium in body and creamy yet slightly watery in texture as alot of brown ales can be with the carbonation being ever so perfectly soft.

The palate opens lightly sweet, with caramel, brown sugar and quite a bit of hazelnut flavor. Again, I get a strange soggy cereal flavor, rather off-putting.

A bit of honey and brown sugar on the nose also. Pretty much the best smelling beer ever. The flavor drops off for me a bit as it's extremely dry and get a hint of astringent flavors. Really nutty and malty with very little hops. Also a bit thin for me. Nice lingering sweet flavors of roasted hazelnuts but the carbonation is a bit high for me and this really would be better if it was creamier or had nitro.

I highly recommend drinking Brown Nectar in a bathtub or in the hot sun, highly refreshing, crisp, sweet, nutty taste. From my experience this seems to be the case with Rogue, they don't make any crazy zany beers of experimental styles or in the hazy realm of deep palate tasting notes.

The head is silky and tan and about a half-inch thick. The hazelnuts in the brew are evident in the aroma and because of that, it is one of the more unique aromas I have tried. Other than hazelnuts the overall characteristic is sweet and sugary. There is a nice full-bodied texture followed by a prodigious mix of caramel malts, hazelnuts, bread, and maple in the flavor.

The understated flavors in this brew from the coffee to the nuts to the sugars are all in perfect blend and lead to a very modest yet over achieving effort. Great wintertime brew to be eaten with my steak and squash.","ArrogantDeadGuy","Nov 06, 2009"

The taste is loaded with roasted malts and the very clear and convincing hazelnut came through from start to finish. There is an ever so slight lightish coffee taste in the background, lots of nutty flavors, with the hazelnut the most pronounced. In what should be the standard among brewers, the bottle lists the ingredients to the beer and there are tons of different malts with two hop varieties present. They even comment on the water used. If only other brewers did the same. The beer is modestly carbonated and slightly light and watery and a bit less substantial than I would have assumed. The mouthfeel is quite light with not much of an aftertaste in either case. This is a good beer, a change up because there aren't that many clear hazelnut varieties out there, but it isn't brilliant, and part of the problem may have been the lightness and watery consistency that left me wanting something more dense and thoroughgoing.","albern","Jul 02, 2009"

Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation isn't overactive but it is very persistent throughout. Mineral water feel to it, helps keep the nuttiness fresh and raw. On the dry side, any sweetness in the brown sugar, molasses, caramel or dark chocolate more inherent to the definition than immediately expressed. Mutter of apricot, peach fruit.

3.95,-2.9,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Nectar might be the exact word I would use in describing this beer. A chocolatey, maple syrup, ""nectar"" that tastes very similar to a Porter. Head definitely follows the two-finger rule and shows a brownish-yellow color. Appearance in the glass in dark brown and lovely looking. The taste is great. Maple, chocolate, and hazelnut with a sweet coffee tasting finish and after taste. It is very smooth and easy to drink. My only problem would be drinking a lot of this beer. It is very rich and a little too sweet. However, I am drinking a 22 oz bottle and it is just what the doctor ordered! I couldn't choke down much of this beer because it is soooo thick. Very good beer though.","ruck304","Nov 07, 2008"

It has the awesome chocolate wafer flavour mixed with a some more bitter chocolate flavours. The taste is quite sweet, but the bitterness balances it really well.

Looked tasty, smelled tasty too. There was obviously the hazelnuts, but there was also some other roasted dark malts in there, maybe some chocolate or coffee, plus a soft touch of sweetness. The taste was excellent: as you would expect, there was plenty of nutty taste, but the beer was overall very well balanced. I could pull out dark, roasted malts in addition to the lighter nut flavor, plus toffee sweetness, and a splash of bitter hops. The beer was creamy and smooth.

Aroma is completely dominated by the hazelnut and roasted malts. Nothing else is detectable. The taste is the same, and just as delicious. Roasted malts, coffee, and tons of hazelnut flavoring. Smooth thick mouthfeel. Exceptional flavor, not too high alcohol, and smooth finish amount to a highly drinkable brew.

Really easy to drink.","illidurit","Mar 09, 2008"

Strong scents of hazelnuts and brown sugar out of the bottle, but mellowed considerably in the glass. Flavors similar to nose, but much less intense. Hazelnut flavor detectable at finish as well as a hint of wheat. Well-balanced mouthfeel with a touch of carbonation and a smooth finish; alcohol was well-hidden.

I have to say i was a bit dissapointed in the strong bitter taste and mild hazelnut flavor. Unfortunately, the burnt taste i was afraid of was here. Id give it another shot, on tap if i can, or maybe a more fresh one. I suspect that the place i got it, not only overcharges, but may not sell alot of them.","blatherbeard","Feb 11, 2008"

Terffific toffee flavor, with a distinct hazlenut, dark-coffee, dried-fruit, fig, nutty flavor that really hit home and was very powerful and pleasing without being overbearing or cloying... just about perfect taste with an exceptionally smooth, velvet mouthfeel, very creamy, nutty, and rich, near-perfect drinkability, went down like sugar-water, no bitterness or alcohol essence detected, just a wonderful nutty flavor... another winner from Rogue, certainly one of their better brews...

I've had this several times before and usually has a more robust head so this one may be off slightly. The aroma was awesome - malty with a great hazelnut front. Gets your mouth watering right away. The taste is perfect. The hazelnut adds the right amount of flavor and sweetness without being cloying. I imagine without the hazelnut this would still be an awesome beer.

Lightly carbonated. The aroma was very nutty alright with some milk chocolate association. The taste reflected the dryness of the hazelnut, malt, a nectar-like silky mouthfeel. This beer had some body to it with texture and density, with a plum or prune influence alongside the persistent nuttiness. The finish is again hazel or brazil nut dry, bitter, some astringency, but again the nuttiness dominates with malted-milk yeasty backdrop.

A deep sweet peanut brittle just billows out of the glass with buttery highlights and a touch of chocolate detected. A beautiful smell that is good enough to eat. There is a touch of malt hidden in there too but it doesn't present itself much like beer. It just smells good enough to skip the drinking part! The hazelnut influence seems more apparent in the flavor of this brew but there is still plenty of that peanut brittle phenomenon. Sweet butterscotch and malt come through and there is a slight charcoal finish. Although there is a slick feel to this stuff it kept bugging me that it was pretty watery. These kinds of flavors demand more creaminess and body, and more carbonation would have helped as well. You could drink this pretty easily because it is fairly thin stuff but it is probably too sweet to get carried away with. It is a unique and tastey beer but I almost feel like it was a shame to drink away that great aroma, sort of how I feel about pipes/cigars.

3.58,-12,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours clear reddish brown with thick head that dissipates quickly to 1/8"" thick and eventually to a thin film. The smell is strong malt with a definite nutty overtone that comes across as an extract - so much so that I looked on the bottle ingredients and noted that they use almond extract. I feel that this is a little overwhelming both in smell and especially in flavor. The initial flavor is strong malt with notable hazelnut oil flavor. The malt is complex enough, but the nut flavor is a little over the top, in my opinion. The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied with active carbonation. This is an interesting beer, but I prefer browns that are a little mellower and smoother. Rogue's is worth trying, but if I wanted a beer with this much flavor I would crack a different style altogether.","walshclimb","Jul 31, 2007"

The aroma is very nice malty, sweet, nutty with very little hop aroma coming out very characteristic of a nut brown ale. The aroma is complex but melds very well together no one element overpowers another. The flavor is very sweet up front, almost a little cloying which is why i docked it a little in the taste category. A lot of malty, bready, toasty notes in the flavor, also some roasty flavors come out in the back of the mouth. Medium bodied with some good carbonation to scrub the palate with the low level of bitterness. With all that said a very nice brown ale probably one of the best I've had, very complex only complaint is that it's a little sweet.","tigerdoc","Jul 25, 2007"

The taste of this was quite pleasing to me with a complex caramel / hazelnut flavoring and a sweet malt flavoring.

The taste is different than the smell lets on. Sweet, as was expected, but there is a strong nutty taste that hits from the second the brew touches your lips. It finishes very smooth and slightly bitter leaving hints of hazelnut taste on the pallet. It is carbonated fairly highly and I personally think this takes away from the mouthfeel. I would have enjoyed this style more with less carbonation but regardless, it was thick and smooth. This is a great beer to enjoy as a desert or to taste but I couldn't see myself drinking more than a glass or two in a sitting. Regardless it was a delicious brew that i thoroughly enjoyed.","Lothore","Jun 23, 2007"

I first noticed some espresso-fumes and cream, then hazelnut, then butterscoth, then toffee. A splash of hops come in to keep this from being too sweet. A very well-made brown ale with plenty of flavors to choose from.","DoubleJ","Jun 20, 2007"

3.95,-2.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured with a minimal off-white head and with minimal lacing, almost to the very top of the glass. Very clear and a coppery medium-brown in color, with average visible carbonation. Nose offers up indistinct fruit, along with broad strokes of hazelnut (natch) and vanilla. No hop presence on the nose (and minimal hops throughout), and a very light touch of diacetyl. Big notes of vanilla, hazelnut, and cocoa across the palate on the first sip. Root beer notes, and some light butterscotch. The indistinct fruit on the nose is about the only fruity quality I detected here . . . maybe light berry notes? Sweet, rich, and not at all dry . . . it's a bit fuller-bodied than an English brown ale, too, leaning more towards a robust porter. Alcohol is fairly buried by the hazelnut (extract?) in this one, and at 6.2% is pretty firm, so given that fact the drinkability is quite good. Body and mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, which is to be expected from a Rogue brew in good condition (fresh), this leans toward full-bodied due to its higher level of sweetness / dextrose. And when I say sweet, think confectioner's sugar, cane sugar, treacle . . . marzipan. A bit of spiky, oily hop would actually improve this brew in my mind, but I prefer balance in a mid-strength brew. A bit too sweet for me overall, but with good drinkability nonetheless. Definitely a dessert beer and one to pair with desserts and sweets. Served chilled (tap-line cold) in a tumbler.","Chaz","Jun 11, 2007"

Nose of sweet malt, some slight soapyness and perhaps a metallic note..hmmmm, any way this one is smooth enough, notes of some caramel and nutyness in the finish, but I do pick up some funky off notes, more soap?

It smelled damn good, like hazelnut (obviously), vanilla coke, prunes. I thought it tasted artificial, though. Too sweet, it could have used some more of those bitter flavors that Rogues was famous for. Everyone's saying that this is a dessert beer -- I don't find that acceptable for a brown for some reason. It's got a full body, but I think that its finish should be drier to balance the heavy roasted malts and sweet hazelnut extract. One is enough for me.","jbsteiny","Apr 28, 2007"

The carbonation, color and flavor all resemble cola in a weird sort of way. I like cola so I enjoyed drinking it, but it's not the Rogue experience that I am used to. Is it REALLY 6.2% ABV?

It was a bit one-dimensional for me. Definitely very heavily presented toasted nut and oat flavors. But something was off, like I was looking at the tap and THINKING hazelnut but really I was tasting some horrible nut extract with a heavy emphasis on walnut/pecan.

4.1,0.7,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"My third beer from Rogue, and after the Mocha Porter and the Chocolate Stout, I am looking forward to this sweeter and less roasty offering. 650ml, tasted at cellar temperature. Poured out, wow, quite dark for a brown. A nice, solid-looking deep tawny chestnut. Held to light it shows some nice near-ruby, light purple hues. The head is oatmeal-coloured and left full but fast moving lace. A definite beauty of a brown ale to look at. The first aroma...mmmm...butterscotch and creamy hazelnut. Sweet and big on the caramel malts, almost like coffee flavouring, vanilla and hazel. The prominent notes here are the toffee, butterscotch and caramel, and it's really quite delicious to smell. Better than the Chocolate stout and Mocha porter for me. It really reminds me of a flavoured coffee, because it does have a milky, almost buttery profile as well. The malting is strong and balanced, and the hops are really hard to find behind all the sweetness. Other sweet notes: candy apple, chocolate raisins, prunes, some rummy sugariness, and even a little spicy phenol. A real pleasure to inhale. Taste? Rummy sweetness and butterscotch on the tongue right away, a bit mild but sweet in the middle, and leaving with, yes: hazelnut and more coffee flavour than the nose suggested. Light chocolate and a less full-flavour than the aroma might have led me to believe, but this is still extremely tasty. A lovely aftertaste that lingers full with nuttiness and caramel, vanilla and cinnamon bread. Very creamy, with coffee-flavouring. A brown sugar flavour here too that (almost) reminds me of some Belgian dubbels. A ton of toffee-candy sweetness. Awesome. The mouthfeel is the only nitpicking territory. I found it a little weak and watery at the finish--it could use just a tad more body, because the lack of it adds a hard-water flavour the beer could do without. Low carbonation. I could drink these all night, and give me this over their Chocolate stout anyday. Solid.","Cwrw","May 05, 2006"

Big malts with overtones of - the name hits it - Hazelnut rides through the nose. The beer itself tasted sweet, perpetually teetering near the edge of being overly so, but never becomes too sweet for my taste. The beer is big on the slightly roasted malt flavors along with the nutty flavors. The low level of carbonation aids in giving it a rich, full mouthfeel too. A slight, nice bit of bitterness comes at the very end as the beer roles of the mouth. This is like a nice dessert in a glass. It's a drinkable beer even with it's sweetness.","edmundfitzoil","Mar 26, 2006"

As a result of not being to fond of the style, I though this was a great beer. The deep amber color is complemented by a milky thick body of tiny bubbles. Ive never had an amber be so complex. It has a strong caramel taste and I get hints of smoked bacon. This would be great with a ham. The nose has a strong sent of brown sugar. The finish leaves a great sticky smoky brown sugar taste in your mouth. Mouth feel is very impressive. It feels a lot lighter then it looks making it go down maybe a little too quick.

Every bit as good as the Morimoto was, maybe a bit richer. Almost like drinking a less chocolate laden nutella. Very rich and a bit sweet. Makes a wonderful after dinner drink.

Starts off well enough; malty, nutty, smoky, and strangely refreshing. As the beer warms, however, it develops a sticky sweetness that begins to overpower the palate.

This is almost a bit too ""tasty"" for a beer, if that makes sense. The taste is of course great, don't get me wrong, but it's almost like I'm drinking a cappucino. A little too much artificial flavoring if you ask me. I like my beer a little more beerish, with more emphasis on the malts and hops. However, there's a great smooth mouthfeel to this. If they reduced the cappucino flavor a bit this would be a classic beer, although as of now it's a bit wimpy due to the flavoring.","twelvsies","Apr 18, 2005"

There is also a slight chocolate taste to it. This beer is creamy and smooth. It is carbonated just right. This beer is medium bodied. It is a very good beer.

It's good, it just doesn't live up to the aroma. The brown sugar is there momentarily up front, and the hazelnut flavor is alos apparent, but this quickly dissolves into a relatively thin and astringent finish.

Taste is mildly nutty, however I was expecting it to be a little more intense from the aroma. Note: Let this beer warm up a little to unleash more nutty flavor.

There is a bit to much of hazel nut flavor for my taste, if it it was a bit more subdued i would like the taste more. There are definate nut/vanillia coffee taste to it. Mouth feel is great, thick and creamy. It ranks low on drinkability due to the overbearing hazelnut flavor. A good overall beer, not something i could drink all the time, but could go very nicely as a desert beer, though the bottle has a picture of a cow and a pig, i assume suggesting to be drank with those two meets, but for me i could see it going real well with coffee ice cream with hot fudge on and nuts on top. ,aybe a beer float with some vanillia ice cream, the thick texture would lend well to that.","MediocreatBest","May 24, 2004"

I'd guess a low abv, as nothing comes through to stop this from sailing back down the hatch. 22 ounces disappeared before I knew it. Really, very good.

The smell translates cleanly to the taste--nutty, caramely malts dominate. Aftertaste is particularly pleasant. Exceedingly smooth, though a bit too watery.

Smell is light roasty chocolate and a big time hazelnut extractness to it, some wiffs have more hazelnut then others where others were nearly empty. Taste is about as smooth as the other hazelnut beer with some lightly favorable chocolate tones and hazelnuts, slightly roasty and a touch of quick sweetness. Nice airy nut-like dryness in the finish, yet stays sweet. Perhaps a bit too much in that regards. Again with some sips the extract is more evident then others. Seemingly off a bit comparingly to the original. Still, a nice creamy medium body encompasses it while it maintains an overall smoothness and drinkability.

Not floral at all. The initial taste is very malty, low bitterness. It really is pretty nutty. Then you get roasted malt and chocolate flavors. The finish is nice and dry, so dry you feel it creeping up the edges of the inside of your mouth. However, you're also left with a clinging, cloying thick feeling in your mouth.

Melted, buttery toffee in a pot of hazelnut infused liquid chocolate is the dominant malt impression. Malt sweetness is well integrated and controlled, and is of a stately, simple dark lovibond caramel nature. Hop bitterness is mild and serves only to taper residual sugar to prevent cloying sweetness. Trace minty noble esque hop flavor jives well with the obvious cocoa and hazelnut presence. Subtle, inobtrusive, brown malt derived singed biscuit tones arise as the beer warms. Medium bodied at best, with a mouthfeel ample in dextrins, but shy in proteinaceous viscosity. Finishes buttery with lingering carob and oil roasted hazelnut hints. A very tasty brew, yes, but seemingly not quite as balanced as its predecessor. It's more of a dessert beer or ""beer cordial"" now, due to the lower perceived bitterness. A fine brew, regardless.","marc77","Jan 04, 2004"

A sweet nutlike malted aroma dominates, hints of vanilla, quite fresh and clean, start quite sweet with the top a bit thin for my liking.

Soft, creamy and chewy palate. Tremendous malt/hops balance, more on the malt size, but hops is noticeable, especially toward the finish where I noticed a woody/herbal hops flavor and a roastiness that added to the complexity.

Unfortunately, not being a big fan of hazelnut in any form, the taste didn't really capture my fancy. It's a nice beer and I'm sure better than most ""flavored"" beers out there.

Aroma is of a coffeeness blended with sweet dark carmel and a distinct nutty aroma. Flavor is smooth and thick with very little malt bitterness and more of a sweet coffee flavor with a very obvious nuttiness that could never have come from malt. Hops are present but are here just to balance the malt character. Body is very heavy and goes well with this beer as there is little bitterness from hops or malt so it dosen't linger too much. Smooth flavor is very refreshing and is a nice break from the usual Brown ales I have tried. The only thing i have to say after drinking this beer is that if you want to try it be prepared for an unnaturally strong nut flavor.

The taste is a lot like chocolate covered hazlenuts, and it even has that slightly sharp nut aftertaste. Good coffee notes and some chocolate as well. Not as sweet as I expected, but still very good. Lack of sweetness probably actually helps the drinkability and the overall enjoyment of this beer. The mouthfeel is solid, but not as rich as some other browns.

Overall the flavor is too sweet, and the mouthfeel is decidedly slick and oily with low carbonation. The body of the beer is not appealing to me. I would not choose this one again.","far333","May 03, 2003"

They ARE, however of good quality, and very drinkable. If you've been curious about the fuss, you shouldn't be wary, as they are deserving of at least some of the accolades. Worth seeking out, at least to see and taste for yourself!","WaltTrombone","Apr 27, 2003"

3.91,-3.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"It was hard to review this beer, at first it was hard to drink because of the large amount of hazelnut. Of course I was expecting it to be hazelnutty but the first few sips were a little bit too much. Once the palate settled down the true flavors came out, revealling a sweet flavor with a mild bitterness that is masked by the hazelnut flavor. The first part of the sip is sweet with a light hop aroma that eventually becomes bitter as the beer hits the back of the mouth. Great color and taste. Overall a very good beer!","Elemental","Apr 09, 2003"
4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep mahogany color with a medium sized off-white head. The froth quickly fades down leaving a light lace on the glass. The nose is full of different aromas, such as hazelnuts, coffee, molasses, and roasted malt just to name a few. The taste is just as complexit contained many of the same properties as the aroma, with a hint of bitter hops at the finish. This is a very smooth and rich beer, its excellent to drink on a cold winter day.","Scooter77","Apr 07, 2003"
4.01,-1.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A bit thin in the mouth, but it's nice to see how many flavors can be packed into the beer nevertheless (especially for those of us who are accustomed to flavor coming only from thick, heady beers). Nice tip of tongue hops burn, a slip of honey down the middle, and a nutty aftertaste that adds wonderful character. So easy to drink... smooth and just complicated enough to inhibit gulping!","Darkale","Mar 29, 2003"
4.13,1.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"I could not pick up much in the nose, probably due to the smoke in the bar. There was the obvious slight nutty aroma, with a bit of coffee as well. The beer was a dark shade of brown with a thin tan head on top. The taste is quite unique. A roasty bitterness arrives at the start, followed by hints of toffee and a mild hop bite, and ends with an overwhelming nutty finish. The nut flavor is somewhat sweet, but certainly not overpowering, and is delicious. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy...reminded me of a cask conditioned ale. This is a great ale from Rogue, and a very interesting one at that.","IrishRedRock","Mar 16, 2003"
4.43,8.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Ahh I love bombers. This brew poured a very deep brown color with a very creamy tan head that lasted for almost the whole brew. The lacing was in thick sheets around the glass. A good looking brew. The aroma was mostly sweet malt with some toasted malt as well. There was also some chocolate trying to make itself noticed. The taste was just as nice. Sweet malts is what hit me first being pretty sweet but not overdone. The middle has a sort of buttery taste, what is that Diacetyl (sp?). The toasted malt is also very noticeable in the taste. The aftertaste has a bread flavoring and maybe a little bit of chocolate. This beer has great balance to it. The mouthfeel is medium and goes down easy. Overall I really liked this brew. It's the type of brew I could drink all night as it is not very filling. Next time I'll have to grab a couple of bombers.","Bruiser81","Mar 11, 2003"

4.01,-1.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The first thing I thought when I tasted this, was Newcastle Nut Brown Ale. I guess the only thing different, is that it is better! Sure, I really like the Newcastle, but this is a level above. For one, the taste is a little more complex. It is light, but at the same time, it has a stronger taste of roasted nuts. It's also a little bit lighter on the alcohol taste, so it doesn't overpower your tastebuds. Has a little bit of a dry taste in the end, but it's not too dry. All in all, it's a good ""ittle"" brew. Could this be the nectar of the Gods? Nah, mead is.","JISurfer","Feb 22, 2003"
3.48,-14.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This one just isn't doing it for me. After having two excellent beers from Rogue (Shakespeare stout and Dead Guy ale), this comes as a bit of a disappointment. The appearance is a very rich dark brown with no head at all. The smell has a very astringent quality to it mixed with the hazelnut extract. The flavor is of dark roasted malts, hazelnut coffee, and dark chocolate. The hops provide a nice dry aftertaste. Normally the flavors I've just described would have me foaming at the mouth, but the body of this beer is so thin, the roasted malt and coffee tastes seem more suitable for a porter or a stout.","HossMcGraw","Feb 21, 2003"

4.07,0,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a mahogony brown with ruby highlights. A caramel colored head fades fast to a thin collar. Sweet malty aroma with a hint of (surprise) hazelnut. I smell mollasses and bitter chocolate. Very smooth. The usual Rogue bitterness isn't there, very little hop bite. It tastes like a decadent dessert, nutty & chocolaty. A little thinner than I had hoped with carbonation fitting the style. I will by this beer again. A real treat!","cretemixer","Jan 28, 2003"

4.22,3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5," The taste is impressive and complex. The roasty dark malts hold the reigns for the most part, but the hazlenut also has a nice kick. The finish is dry and almost everything jumps in at the end including nuts, chocolate, and coffee. It is smooth and rich, and i can see myself getting this one many more times. This is one brew i would not be happy without.","ElGuapo","Jan 26, 2003"

4.4,8.1,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Decent head - settled pretty quick. Malty nose. The balance of Hops and malt in this one gives it a very unique nutty flavor that makes this one (In my humble opinion) the best Rogue I have tried. This is a real interesting beer to drink. The flavors seem to change as you drink it. The beginning was shockingly good with that wonderful nutty flavor being the first and most prominent flavor. Toward the middle of the beer the flavor seemed almost like pure hops and got rather bitter on the palate. As I finished it though the nuttiness returns to have a sweet finish. I highly recommend this one.","AtrumAnimus","Jan 15, 2003"

4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured with a slight head that dissipated quickly. Muddy brownish red in color, fairly opaque. Distinct nutty aroma. Nutty flavor comes through in the taste, and is followed by a twinge of hops. The maltiness and nuttiness combine nicely. Smooth, very nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I expected, but good for a brown ale. I especially like the fact that it's not overly sweet either. An excellent brew.","LarryV","Dec 07, 2002"

4.85,19.2,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"The bottle proclaims this to be the ""World Brown Ale Champ."" Impressive claim, though it doesn't specify the awarding institution. Ayways, it was enough to whet my curiosity. Pours ruby in color with a medium-tan, creamy head. The aroma is enticing -- roasted malt and hazelnut. Not too strong, just enough to increase my excitement to taste the beer. And wow. The taste. First thing that struck me was the incredible creaminess of this beer. Hazelnut lingers in the background behind a chocolate malt body. Decent hop bitterness to the beer, but very unassertive. Just enough to keep the finish from being cloying. Hazelnut reasserts itself in the aftertaste to a very pleasant effect. All in all a terrific beer -- sweeter than many browns but complex and well-balanced enough to keep it interesting all the way to the bottom of the botle.","mzwolinski","Nov 18, 2002"

Hazelnut aroma, along with sweet and earthy scents. Mouthfeel in a bit thin, taste causes you to expect more body, but it is still rich and creamy. Starts malt sweet, and then the slight hops come keep the malt in check. Finishes with a delicious hazelnut taste. One of the best aftertastes I have experienced. Very easy to drink, a real treat.","Lupe","Oct 26, 2002"
4.55,11.8,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Deep brown... almost opaque, with a thin tan lace.  Aroma of coffee, bread and hazelnut.  Flavor begins with bread and coffee, ends with hazelnut and a some hop bitterness.

3.53,-13.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"While there is nothing objectionable in the aromas or flavors, it does seem that that the ingredients of the beer stand out obtrusively. I take it as a cardinal rule of cooking, as well as brewing (or any art for that matter,) that if you can sense the conscious work of the producer, then they added too much. Call it ""contrived."" Bam! chocolate malt. Bam!, hazelnut extract. There is very little integration to this beer. No zen. No bliss. Nevertheless, for anyone craving overt stimulation, this is a sound beer, and entertaining. In a loud bar it might be completely appropriate. While it does nothing to hurt Rogue's deserved high reputation, it doesn't help either.","putnam","Oct 02, 2002"

Wonderful rich nutty aroma, hazelnut of course, along with creamy malt aromas, mostly with roasted character. Kind of a nutty coffee aroma. ""Delicious"" is a good one-word description of the taste, but is also an understatement! Excellent hazelnut and roasted malt flavor with a small but easily detectable spicy hop backbone. Chocolate maltiness also plays a big role (originating from the chocolate malts used, of course). Just a touch of wood flavor as well. Medium body, but with all of the flavors it doesn't matter. Creamy mouthfeel that makes your palate cheer joyfully, and a dry, nutty finish. So drinkable it's gone before you know it. 22 oz. is almost not enough! Excellent and truly worthy of the word ""nectar", my only wish for this beer is for the head to stay all the way through.","hyuga","Oct 01, 2002"

The smell is of caramel-ish malts with a dose of hops and is rather sweet. This is a tasty brew. Notes of sweetness - hazelnut, caramel and that subtle touch of hops - are present. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, and this is an easy drinking brew. A definite must try for fans of the brown ale style.","Jon","Sep 22, 2002"
3.58,-12,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Opaque, deep ruby in color with an aroma that is all nuts.  The flavor had a little coffee aftertaste and slight malt, but they were way overpowered by the nuttiness.  It was very smooth and full of flavor, and they certainly achieved the desired result of hazlenut, but it was too simple for me.  More malt and less hazlenut might have made this a more balanced beer.  Not a bad beer, just not one of my top choices.","ryanocerus","Aug 28, 2002"

Reminiscent of root beer or cream soda, especially in mouthfeel. Some nice caramel malt flavors accented by the hazelnut, with hints of coffee, cream, and chocolate -- but in all honesty, that's about it. Little in the way of hops which is good for this brew... but there's just not a lot going on here. Still pretty tasty, but sadly flat in my glass. Like a soda that sat out too long.

The scent was of sweet caramel and a shade of coffee (hazelnut perhaps?).  A rich, nutty and caramel flavor swirls around in a velvety coat.  The only drawback is that its richness, nut flavors and nearly-heavy body make it one to savor in moderation and as an everyday thirst-quencher.  Regardless, another great brew form Rogue, they always do you right!","BillyBrew","Jun 16, 2002"
3.93,-3.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This beer poured out a nice very dark amber color with a tan head, that did subside with some lace.  Nice faint malt smell to it.  Slight hazelnut smell to it, some coffee aroma to it.  The flavor is what hits you.  Because of the hazelnut, you would have to put this not only as a brown ale, but a spice beer.  The hazelnut taste was very good and quite pronounced.  It was so heavy with that taste, you wonder if that adds to the body to it as well as the mouthfeel.  Good flavor, but the strong hazelnut and carmel aspects to this might throw some.  Worth checking out.","Wildman","Jun 13, 2002"

Great desert beer for everyone.","beernut7","Jun 04, 2002"
