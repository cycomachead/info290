"A very good brown ale"
""
""
""
"O: A very good Brown Ale. All the flavors are there from the earthy roasted malts to the nuttiness. However there are some well masked subtleties to it like the bit of chocolate and black coffee on the back end. Exceptional beer to look at with some good flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Some people would love this.  I am not a coffee drinker.  I'm getting a nasty, bitter, black coffee bite that I don't care for.  There are a lot of interesting different flavors here, but it's not my cup of coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my favorite beer of all time!"
""
"12 oz. bottle. Nose of caramel and yeast. Taste of mild chocolate, caramel and brown sugar with a little nutty finish. The hops provide a low-key bitterness to nicely offset the sugary sweetness. Smooth with good carbonation and balance. Not earth shattering but tasty and drinkable. An exemplary brown ale."
"Smooth finish but not lacking in flavor."
"Pours clear brown. Coffee and something bright, maybe lemon, on the nose. Chicory, nutty malts, and an earthy finIsh."

"Meow beer."

"O: Overall a delicious and thoroughly enjoyable brew. If there were a bit better head retention, it would have scored even higher. Nevertheless, Ellie would be proud, indeed."
""
"Very good balanced beer, one downside is the head retention, the tan head disappears quickly. The ale makes up for it with a taste that lingers long after the mouth feel disappears, bringing once forward nut flavors to the back of the tongue. Semi spicy hops with nice dark floral tones that really compliment the medium malt tastes. Could have a fuller body for a brown ale, but seems like the mouth feel of many american brown ales. Traditional english browns are deeper on the malt but this one still carries through a lot of the flavors you come to expect from an old school brown but with stronger emphasis on the raisen tones throughout, both in the aroma and taste."

"Avery has generally been a disappointment for me so this was nice surprise.  Nice malty flavor that had me licking my lips between drinks, this is a good thing for me.  Sweet on the finish that almost seemed like candy.  Low on the bitter which is also good for me.  Lacks a lot of complexity or character.  Overall I felt is was outstanding beer that was smooth, easy to drink, and hopefully one I will have again.  Not the best brown but very nice."

"I love this beer. The six pack I got recently tasted a little old though"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bright, Malty caramel and toffee. A bit of dark bread crust moderate to low hop bitterness with low spicy hop flavor. A slightly sweet, creamy finish."
""
""
"Poured into glass mug. Finger of head disappeared somewhat quickly. A little lacing. Dark almost black. Roasty, some chocolate, malty. To me the best overal brown ale I've had this far."

"Very tasty beer.   Poured dark, dark brown with little head.  Nice maltiness to it with a bit of hops.  Would definitely enjoy another!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding brown, one the best I've ever had! Poured with a tan head, some lace and a very dark almost opaque Black brown color. Aroma is malti nutty slight hint of hops. Flavor is like aroma little on the Sweetside very drinkable. Perfect body. Super tasty."
"Overall - A pretty damn solid brown. Probably doesn't crack my top 10 ABA's, but I could stand to drink a few more. If only the flavor matched the strength of it's aroma... oh well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Malty and bready, with just a bit of hops.  Thick consistency, with an impressive amount of head.  Brown sugar flavor.  Dark and translucent pour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium body, medium carbonation, a smidgen too sweet up front, a little more roast than necessary."
""
"Great flavor, not too heavy, fantastic beer."
"simple brown, easy drinking."
""

""
""
""
"Very drinkable, good brown ale"
""
""
""
""
"Overall very simple but very good and super drinkable. Not a whole lot going on but if you like sweet chocolate and cream/vanilla, a very good and drinkable brown ale. Worth checking out for sure."

"This brown ale appears to have roots in within a traditional, malt-forward type of ale. The malt sugars are the key: rich, slightly charred in flavor and aftertaste, and with the hops providing a low-key bitterness to nicely complement the sugary sweetness. Robust and delicious."

"O - Good brown ale, I would only change the hops in this, they have a more of a part in this beer than is really needed, and kinda outshine some of the more ""savory"" if you will, aspects of a brown ale. Still a solid one though."

"O: This is a nice beer. It has a bit brighter malt flavor than the typical brown ale, the hops are not overpowering, more like an English brown. The hops seem to be of a domestic variety which adds to it's complexity and uniqueness. I'll have another!"
""
"Dark brown in color with a quarter inch thick khaki colored head. Light Brussels lacing. Aroma of dark malt,caramel,and toffee are very enticing. I get coffee,dark malt and chocolate in the flavor. This is smooth and creamy. The finish is very dry and there's a light smoked malt note in the aftertaste. You could drink a lot of this and there's a lot of flavor packed in here. This is definitely on the sweeter end of the spectrum."

"Overall: Very nice and gently nuanced with flavors that meld together well. Easy to drink."
""
"price Point - $2.10/12 oz can"
"From the pour rises a creamy 2 1/2 inch tan head. Beer is dark brown in color. A strong smell of toasted malt. Taste is walnuts, chocolate, coffee. It has a bitter finish which leaves a earthy nutty aftertaste in your mouth. This beer has everything I like in a brown ale."
""
""

"Pour from can purchased at Distellers Outlet in Poway CA. Dark brown with a big off white head. Nice lacing. Smell is incredible. Vanilla, brown sugar, honey. Taste is very pleasent. Malts and a nutty tinge with hints of vanilla, defintley getting some chocolate too but its very faint. I purchased just one can, next time I'll get a sixer of this, really enjoyable."
""
""
"O- Solid American brown ale. Not cloying. Very pleasant on a chilly evening."
""
""
""
""
""

"I much prefer Upslope Brown to Ellie's. Probably won't have again."

"o: Rating this was difficult because it was excellent, but...not my idea of either a malty English or hoppy American brown. This ought to be labelled Ellie's Porter or even Ellie's Stout. Have a bottle of their New World Stout which I am now anxious to compare to this."

"O-I have used this beer for years in my BBQ sauce, I put it on my ribs and other pork, because it has the flavors and taste I seek for that purpose. To drink this beer on a cold winter day would be nice, but it goes well with BBQ also."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not my favorite brown ale, but it's up there, only DF head IBA surpasses this to date in my book"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice, straight forward example of the style, though not my favorite Brown Ale. Very easily drinkable, you could probably session this beer with no problem."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep dark ruby reds and chocolate browns with an off white persistent creamy head. Nose is very light; baking chocolate and cooked sugar. Easy drinking with sweet cocoa and light morning coffee up front, delicate hop finish coasts with a lightly caramel flavor in the finish. Thin mouthfeel and carbonation seems very mild. Suprisingly nuanced and balanced, not at all assertive or bold. A very easy drinking session brown that just replaced Moose Drool as my new favorite ABA, also superior to Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar. The best American Brown that I'm aware of."
"This is a killer Brown ale. Not like any other. Drinks like a Brown should. Very drinkable and palatable. Highly recommended, should be considered a must try."
"Overall, it's a brown ale, and if you like brown ales, you'll probably like it. I'm just not so crazy about it."
"O - One of the best examples of the style I have had. Nothing revolutionary or mind blowing here (it's a brown ale after all), but a really well crafted beer all around and a great ""everyday"" kind of beer. Outstanding."
""
"O - This is a tasty brown ale. Could easily drink a few of these. the malty flavors are great"
""
""
""
"Overall, good to very good. I do prefer a stronger brown ale but for the style I think this has been very well done."
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
"Leave it to Avery to brew such a fine dark ale. Not my everyday brew, but I probably will add a six pack in to my rotation of beer purchases from time to time."
""
""
""
""
""
"If you love traditional British brown ales, you must try this excellent brew.  It is tops! Someday, I will visit the brewery."
""
""
"A plainly drinkable, and little more, brown ale, the expected Yankee hops and old-world biscuity character both conspicuously absent. There's enough going on to recommend this, however, but it comes off as a bit weak, when put up against this brewer's more heady offerings."
"Overall: I really, really like this brown ale. I love the roastiness and the maltiness of this beer as well as the slight creaminess. Ellie’s Brown Ale is certainly one of the better brown ales that I’ve had and I’ll certainly be getting more of it."
""
""
"O- Very tasty brown ale. Lots of flavor, which is what a lot of browns lack."
""
""
""
"O- Slightly lacking on flavor, but a very drinkable brown ale that has some good qualities. I bet an imperial version of this beer would be killer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep, clear brown with creamy tan head. The head has great retention and leaves sticky lacing here and there. The aroma is mild, mostly darker roasted malt and a little earthy. The taste is a little bit more robust, with nice nutty flavors and a hint of coffee in the background. There is also a little earthiness to the whole affair. It has a nice weight to the body and a smooth, silky feeling. A solid brown ale."
""
"A pretty good brown."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Eh, just another brown ale. In fairness, this really isn't my style. Basically it does everything decently without doing anything impressively. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'd say Ellie's is the best brown I've had, and I'd also say that those who like the traditional brown ale style will really dig this one. Cheers."

""
""
"O/D-I wanted more from this but I did enjoy my pint. I thought it had more potential in it, though."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark reddish/brown that is close to black. Very small tan head but left good lacing when sipped. The aroma is of of nutty grains and chocolate. Very pleasing to the nose. The taste is the same and very pleasant with no bitter aftertaste. Perfect carbonation. Really liked this brew and the first I had from this brewery."
""
""
""
"Super smooth and a treat to drink. One of my favorite brown ales...a truly under appreciated style and beer. This one nails it."

""
""
""
""
"O - I do like the Avery brown but I personally feel its a touch under done and the brewer is leaning more toward a session brown instead of fulfilling its class with more of the great flavors it has. Overall Avery is one of my favorites and Ellie's brown has some incredible traits that the feel doesn't live up to. I will continue to enjoy these but really this could be the best brown ale in the world given a few upgrades"
""
""
""
""
"Tasty beer, well balanced between drinkability and complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As would be expected from Avery, this is a well made and well balanced brew. I would say it is much less harsh than many ""American"" style brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like it. It may haves some weaknesses but it is what it is, a good brown ale."

"Overall a very nice brown ale."

"Poured this American Brown Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured dark brown color, produced a huge tan head, lacing and retention was excellent. The aroma consisted of toasted malt and carmel. Medium bodied, there was a foundation of roasted malted grain, sweet caramel and nuts. Semi dry finish. Overall this is an awesome American Brown Ale- It may be my new standard bearer- Awesome aroma and flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent sessionable brown ale. There's enough flavor going on that I would give it a recommendation, but it's not something that's going to knock your socks off."
"Deep dark brown mud with coffee with cream head. Cookie aroma with chocolate chips, earth, and brown sugar. Tastes of cookie, chocolate chips, brown sugar, earth, some vague herbal notes, and spices. The mouthfeel is where there's trouble: a bit light in body with medium carbonation. A nice brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: my husband really likes this beer, he refers to it as his ""easy, everyday drinking beer"". I however, think its just ok. It is an easy drinker, but it is slighty disappointing. I would like to see more depth to the beer. Overall, I would drink it again, but its just ok."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good toasted malt character, a touch of hops, but definitely malt focused, as it should be. No off flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very solid beer, that has some complexity while maintaining that easyy to drink feel."
""
"O – Very nice, good balance between sweet light roasted malts and some nice nutty complexities as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Tasty brew that I could drink for hours. Didn't blow me away with flavors or complexity, but still a solid beer."
""
"Brown with fleeting loose light tan foam and evident carb with large bubbles. Smells of coffee, cocoa, some soil and leather. Some bits of tea and metal. Flavor is biscuity, chocolate, coffee, nuts, roasty malts. Much better flavor than the nose - which is bland. Medium bodied with moderate carb and a wet finish with long aftertaste. Much nicer than I had expected."
"O - Impressive. Flavorful robust malt profile delicately balanced by light hops. Great drinkability."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, nice head developed, tan in color, lasted with good lacing. Appearance was dark caramel brown with an aroma of malty sweetness. Taste was nutty and malty with a slight caramel / chocolate finish. mouthfeel was full and creamy with a dry. slightly caramel aftertaste. A really great brown ale."

"overall, a very clean finish to a tasty and nutty brown. i really liked this one. it left a great aftertaste, wasnt bitter, but had some great qualities such as the earthy, roasted nuttiness. i could do several of these in succession."
""
""
""
""
""
"I prefer Avery's IPA."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O-There is nothing special about this brew, but it is a solid, drinkable example of the style. The chocolate smell and flavor are a little simple (as is the mouthfeel), but on a relaxing fall evening that calls for a few beers, you could do far worse than putting down a few of these."
""
""
"O - Excellent example of the style and easy to drink. I'm getting this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: While it might not do anything amazing it is still quite a well brewed example of a brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've enjoyed this beer in a bottle and a can, as far as I can remember, and know it's good; the beer is a moderate brown, good hue but not too dark; quarter inch head; a lot of lacing, particularly from a brown; light ale on the nose; delicious light chocolate flavor; small hints of brown sugar; really good sessionable brown ales; in fact, one of the best I can remember"
""
""
""
"I rather liked this one -- a lot of brown ales look good to me but disappoint once you actually taste them, but this one delivers on the flavor."
""
""
""
""
"D - A pretty run of the mill brown ale, perhaps a touch darker than most. Malt focused with little in the way of hop character but a balanced finish."
"Overall: the complexity is nice for the style and its not too bland."
""
""
""
"This is beer review number 1000 for me, thus completing the smithj4 (Jazbo) challenge - 1000 unique beers in one year. Enjoyed this beer with metter98, my wife (Ellie), and my brown dog (Tsuki). Thanks to my wife, Ellie, for supporting me in this challenge which I completed in 9 months and 4 days just before the birth of my frist child (daughter). Also, important that I got to have it in a can since that is my favorite serving type."
"The body was the typical smooth, even and full you look for. Drinkability was very good, the beer goes down easily, and having multiples would be easy. Overall, a nice take on the style. Nothing about this beer is really notable, but there are also no real flaws. If you are in the mood for a nice Brown Ale, you could certainly do a lot worse than having one of these. Plus, I love Labs, so any beer with one on the label will be showing up in my fridge on a regular basis,"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Diamonds are forever."
"O - I really do like a quantity of beers from Avery, namely their top shelf IPA's. This is a solid brown that I continue to revisit. Could be a bit more rounded but a good showing overall."
""
"Overall – A decent brown, but nothing too-too extraordinary. Worth a try if you have never had it."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Quality stuf"
""
"O: This is a very nice example of the style that has a bouns of some hop aroma and flavor - very nice. I would buy this agin."

""
""
"Dark brown - almost black - in the glass with a healthy head and good lacing on the glass. Aroma is of caramel and some chocolate malts. Hops are mild and offset by the malt. This beer is almost a dessert with carmelized brown sugar flavor. Can fall a little flat on the tongue but overall well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a light to medium effervescence. Aftertaste is a bit ashy with malt, wood and peat lingering. A good brew."
""
""
""
"overall I'd give it a 3.5..."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is a very strong example of the style. It is also a great example of a beer that needs to be served at the proper temperature. When cold, a lot of the flavors are masked, but as it approaches 50 degrees or so a lot more comes out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's pretty good. What's the difference between this and a stout? They seem so similar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great brown - while I'm not a huge fan of the category, I would most certainly buy this again."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear dark brown with a thick, light tan head. There's just enough light passing through to make out some tiny bubbles rising from the bottom. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. There are aromas of dark roasted barley malt, chocolate, and coffee. It also smells a little nutty. With the taste, I pick up the roasted malt very strongly with some accompanying sweetness. I also detect the chocolate, coffee, and nutty flavors I found in the aroma. The body is medium with plentiful carbonation. The beer is smooth and highly drinkable. This is an excellent beer. It is a brown ale I would recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Ellie's Brown Ale is a really good brown ale that I am glad I revisited. Inspiring me to try a homebrewed brown ale."
"O-Very good brown ale. Porter/stout like in flavor. Very sessionable."
""
""
"Medium bodied with medium to slightly high carbonation. Super drinkable and tasty. I was impressed! Sometimes you need a nice brown ale to remind you how good this basic and mostly unheralded style can be. A lot more subtle and artful than most of Avery’s over-the-top offerings in my book."

"O - A nice malty brown but pretty simple for an avery brew."
""
""

"O: A great brown ale. A solid core beer in Avery's lineup. Glad to have finally tried this one back in March. It was a pleasure to have once again. I'll come back to this one quite often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a tulip glass. This pours a dark brown color with a large tan head which leaves a lacing. The smell is of caramel malts, bread malts, a little nutty. The feel is medium to light. The taste is okay, its not very strong, you get some caramel and bread malts with a very mild hop bite."
""
""
""
"On-cask at the Avery taproom in Boulder. I have a soft spot for brown ales so when I saw this on offer in cask form it was easy to pass by some of the more exotic taproom offerings. Well-made, easy-drinking, and perfectly balanced. Cocoa, roasted nuttiness, toffee, anise, and caramel backed by an earthy hop element. Seriously smooth with a gentle carbonation. Thoroughly enjoyable."
""
""
""
"o - nothing fancy here, just a well built brown ale that goes down easy."
""
"Overall: B+. Brown ales are not usually my favorite but this is a good one. Drinks like a meal. Drink it too fast and you might miss out on some nice flavor notes. This is one to take down slowly and enjoy."

"Good brown ale - can definitely taste the darker malts. Didn't have much head but was adequately carbonated. Also had in a can and didn't enjoy it as much as there was too much carbonation in the can and but couldn't realize the full taste until it warmed up a bit (which of course is more drinker's error). Would drink again, but would drink out of the bottle or glass."

"Overall I would drink this again. A nice flavor and affordable price."

"Picked up a six pack of cans from GBX as a flyer. Had never tried this before and always looking from new Browns. Got home and poured into a snifter. Beautiful mahogany and medium brown with a generous head and good lacing and spotting. Smell was a surprise. Carmel and nuts took over the aroma and it was a nice blend of the two. Perhaps some brown sugar on the end as well. Taste was what really caught my attention. Very smooth blend of malts and hops. Like the carmel mixing with the hops to give a little complexity to this brew. Feel was a little heavy carbonation, but not over the top. More toward the thick end for me. Overall- A very nice surprise. Sessionable brown with tons of flavor and a great blend. Avery got this right and it's growing on me. A very solid Brown that will find it's way into regular rotation-"

"Big finish on this beer. Rich chocolate and caramel nuttiness throughout. The beer delivers a punch of well blended rich flavors in one quick sip. Big full body. Despite the heavy carbonation, the beer holds up. Lingering nutty and tannic finish with drying bitter cocoa flavors. Hop presence kicks in just in time to separate the start of the brew from the finish. Complex with a certain layered depth yet extremely concise at the same time. Big flavor for such a small brew."

"Pours a very silky, creamy dark bron color with a nice head. Right at the first smell you can smell lots of vanilla, roasted barley, almost a porter like aroma but more fruity. It has a nice medium body creamy body with touch of roastiness and molasses. A bit of chocolate in the after taste! Overall its a very nice brown ale. Definetly a most!"
"Review from 2/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a dark, somewhat cloudy brown amber. Minimal head and no lacing. Toasted malt, some sweet malt and caramel aroma. Light toasty malt up front, a dry grass, nutty finish. Light bodied. A nice low ABV brown ale. Somewhat light flavored and not very complex."

"This is a very smooth, flavorful beer that has great balance and drinkability. I would definitely have this again."

"Overall, this is just a really well crafted brown ale. It goes down really smooth at 5.5% ABV and makes a good session beer. Great complexity in the taste profile."
""
"Ellie's Brown Ale brew pours a deep, dark brown with a minimal light tan head, that provides some decent lace throughout. Sweet malt aromas dominate, with hints of caramel and chocolate very noticeable. The sweet maltiness in the nose is also present in the flavor, with the pallet being able to pick up some brown sugar, light vanilla, and some nuttiness, in addition to stronger chocolate and caramel favors. Lighter amounts of carbonation help make this medium bodied ale smooth and creamy. A GREAT Colorado example of a classic."
"Served on-tap in a tumbler pint, the beer is a light, clear, chestnut highlighted brown coloring with a foamy, frothy, light tan head. Good head retention with a solid cling while you drink. Aromas are light coffee, cream, and nutty highlights with a toffee sweetness throughout. Flavors are smooth and super easy to drink, with a nutty, creamy backbone that is similar to peanut butter, with some fruity sweet highlights. Roasted characteristics bring the beer back down to a close, leading to a slightly sweet, nutty aftertaste. The finish is kept light and somewhat crisp by the carbonation levels, but still manages to give off a slight filmy linger on the roof of the mouth."

"D: While it's not excellent, this is a solid representation of the style. Because the flavors are smooth and relatively subtle, as the bottle suggests, this one is quaffable indeed."

"Poured from a 12 oz can received in a beer of the month six-pack from Vintage Cellar into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a darker head of about 2 fingers. Dissipates slowly. Light malty smell. Roasted nutty taste, but not really strong. Nice chocolatey malt taste appears later as drinking it down. Carbonation is fine, and it goes down smooth, but has a little bit of an aftertaste, but it is not really unpleasant. Overall, an ok beer, a slightly above average brown ale."

"Review #2200. Been revisiting a few of my early-career brews, and I've looked forward to this one, remembering it as one of the better browns of those days. Let's see if it still holds such a rank: It pours a clear ruby-sienna topped by a finger of wan ecru foam. The nose is a blast of caramel, with maybe tiny corpuscles of mild cocoa and lightly toasted biscuit floating in the deep background. The taste brings in more of the same, though some roast does indeed make it through at times, even if only at Tebow-level consistency. There's some light buttered-biscuit and dark greens notes in there as well, but they also constitute tiny minorities. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a very nice brown, nothing overtly special, but something eminently drinkable and enjoyable."

"First uo tnight is Lab Tested Ellie's Brown Ale from Avery. The beer poured a deep clear brown amber with off-whtie head that lacing nicely. the smell carries carmal malt. The taste has a sweet malt start followed by roasty slight bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium body with average carbonation. Overall it is a very good brown ale."

"MF- Light to moderate body with flavors that don't last too long on the palate."

"O: One of the more outstanding Brown's I've had. The only ones I can think of off the top of my head that I would take over this would be Smutty Old Brown Dog and Abita Turbodog. What is it with all these dogs?"

"Overall I thought that this was pretty damn good American Brown Ale. It had a pretty nice malt profile to it and the extra nuttiness in this beer was pretty good, it was so nutty that I think it should be called Ellie's Nut Brown Ale. This beer had very good drinkability for an American Brown Ale, it went down really smooth, had a good mouthfeel, and it had enough flavor to keep me wanting to drink it. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor and the mouthfeel, the malt profile was dead on for an American Brown Ale, and I really like the extra nuttiness in this beer and the mouthfeel was right where it should be. There wasn't really anything I didn't like about this beer, no complaints here. I will buy this beer again, the extra nuttiness makes this a good beer for late fall or early winter. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes Brown Ales, and if you like them nutty then you will really like this beer. So far I have been pretty impressed with the beers that Avery puts in cans, they have all been pretty exceptional for their style. I am having a fun time checking out Avery's beers, I just picked up a bottle of their quad so I hope it is just as impressive as this beer is. Great job Avery, keep it up."

"as good a brown as ive had anywhere. pours a translucent dark copper color with a gorgeous head lacing the glass every sip. smells malty and robust, but not that english newcastle type of way. its a more textured laid back malt profile, with notes of vanilla and molasses in the finish. body is just a bit thin for me here, my only critique of an excellent beer. carbonation is perfect and the finish is great, slow and a little smokey even. resonant and memorable, this is a well made beer, perfect with a grilled duck breast and cabbage"
"O: I tend to like a hop finish that few brown ales provide. Ellie's Brown delivers a flavorful experience with drinkability that makes you go back for more. Avery likes to push the hop envelope. I find hoppy brews best enjoyed from the tap."
"This is a very nice beer. A nice malty alternative to typical canned swill."
"The mouth feel is also a little bit of a let down, but it is still decent enough as is. That's what this beer is: decent enough as is. It's a little frustrating that Avery looks like they about did something really special."
"Avery rarely dissapoints, and this is one more tasty style to come from them. Give this is a Newcastle drinker, it should chnage the way they look at the style."
"Overall, an enjoyable brew...I would drink it again."
"This poured out as a clear looking brown color with a light tan head on top. The lacing was minimal and the retention didn't really do too much either. The smell of the beer has a light roasted nut aroma with some sweet malts in there as well. The flavors of the beer was roasted, some light flavors of some coffee and nuts. The mouthfeel was a little watery and dry. Overall this brew wasn't terrible but I just wasn't too thrilled about it."
"3.0 D: This would be a pretty good beer if the mash temp was a good bit higher. The mouthfeel is weak and brings down the whole experience to ""average."""
"O: Nice beer, good complexity and a solid example of the style. Worth seeking out."
"O: A decent little brown; refreshing with some great roasted malts; it's simple but still quite solid"
"Pours a clear dark brown with a puffy 1 inch light tan head that fades to a thin cap. Thin broken rings of foamy lace stick to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and roasted nuts. Taste is of roasted malt, roasted nuts, cocoa powder, and some vanilla flavors. A nice roasty flavor lingers on the tongue after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a bubbly but smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good brown ale with some very nice aromas and flavors. I usually don't like brown ales too much but this one is great."
"A very nice drinking brown ale, very smooth and flavorful. Well worth getting if you like brown ales."
"D - Extremely well built and drinkable. You'd be hard pressed to find many widely available examples better than this one."
"Overall: A little but it taste good. I like this ale all around. Plus I love dogs and like the story behind it's name. Cheers!"
"Very dark brown w/ red highlights. One finger beige head that stuck only slightly to the glass. Smell is all chocolate with some English hops (I guessed Goldings, but the their website states Bullion, Cascade and Fuggles). Taste is roasty chocolate with a nice amount of sweetness that ends semi dry. Carb is mild giving it a creamy quality. At this time I'd say it's probably my second favorite American Brown. If you enjoy Browns at all you should definitely put this on your must try list."
"O: Average in many ways, more brown sugar than normal."
"O - Wow, a great brown ale! One of the best that I have had. I will be drinking this much more frequent in the future."
"O: very tasty, very dark brown ale. This is so easy to drink its almost like you're not drinking a beer. Wish I could get a 12 pack of this."
"Overall, this is really great. It is a straight-forward American brown ale that is as easy to drink as a good American ale should be. I could drink 6-7 of these at a sitting. Correction: I would like to drink 6-7 of these at a sitting."
"O: Great brown ale. Smooth and recommended. Good value, would drink again."
"I've never been the biggest fan of American Browns, having generally found that the hops overwhelm the malt. Not here, in fact I would suggest that Ellie's Brown Ale is closer to the Northern English Style. All the better for it in my opinion - a truly lovely beer."
"Don't drink and review."
"Very nice a smooth slightly burned malty smell."
"Still easily one of the best American Browns out there, bar none. So thrilled to have this as a canned beer option"
"Taste-Toasted malt,milk chocolate, cocoa. Nice subtle flavors, nothing overpowering, just pleasant and very drinkable. Session-worthy, and can convenience make this a ""take-anywhere"" brown ale. Nice."
"O- A local favorite of mine, and a great session able brown in my opinion. I will buy again and I would reccomend this beer."
"Poured a rusty brown with a nice frothy white head that left some beautiful, thick lacing. Aroma was nutty and sweet with caramel and chocolate. More of the same in the taste: nutty, sweet, Caramello-y, and a mild earthiness from a light hoppage. Medium-bodied, smooth, and quite good."
"Not sure if I'd repeat, but it's certainly a complex and interesting beer."
"12 ounce can, no dating, but it can’t be too old. Pours slightly cloudy reddish brown color with a dense 2 finger off white head with great retention that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap. A small bit of lacing clings to the glass as you drink as well. Aromas of caramel, roasted malt, chocolate, nutmeg, and molasses. Very nice aromas, but a little muted. Taste of huge caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, nutmeg, vanilla, molasses, and a bit of citrus. Small amount of bitterness present on the finish that lingers with caramel, chocolate, and light citrus flavor. Medium carbonation and body. Very nice and creamy mouthfeel with maximum drinkability. No alcohol in the taste or finish as expected. Overall, this is definitely an outstanding brown ale. Tons of flavor, complexity, and smooth drinkability."
"O: I really like this brown ale. Of all the ones I've tried, this has definitely been one of the best looking. Refreshing, nutty, and coffee-like. One of my new favorites."
"comes out a deep dark brown (almost black). nice thick coffee colored head recedes slowly to a ring with good lacing. nose is coffee chocolate and nuts. taste is pretty much the same coffee chocolate and nuts. bit of a hop bite thats not overwhelming but noticeable. it comes on slowly and mildly but lingers well. carbonation is moderate. overall this is one fine brown ale."
"O: This is what a non-hoppy brown ale should taste like. I do wish I know how fresh this was, though."
"O: Overall this is a pretty good brown ale, would try again."
"Roof!"
"carbonation rolls easily, and it goes down smoothe. I got it because it was one of the few at the local marketplace that I hadn't tried that looked like it might be up my alley, and indeed it was. I like this brew, though I've had better. I would absolutely buy it again if the mood struck, but it wouldn't be the first one I would grab for in a hurry. A well crafted beer, and one well worth at least checking out."
"It's similar to an amber but better, not bad but not great. And it's brown."
"This brew pours a deep chestnut brown crested with a finger of head that sticks around for quite some time. The aroma is nice, there's a full, roasty, nutty maltiness to this. There's also caramel, cocoa, and coffee in here. A robust aroma. The taste is a robust caramel maltiness, with a bit of chocolate and roasted nuts. Not quite as alluring as the nose lets on, but still quite good. The mouthfeel is nice, it's got a body on the lighter side of medium and is fairly briskly carbonated, and the drinkability is about average for style. Overall, a great brown ale. A solid choice."
"Pours dark brown with little to no head. Smells of caramel, malts and molasses. Tastes much the same, very smooth and pretty tasty. I could drink a few of these, but there are better brown ales out there."
"T: medium body, sweet notes, a very nice toast flavour, malty flavour too, dry finish, and some hop aftertaste"
"A very nice brew in the brown ale line! This brew poured up a dark mahogany-colored body sporting an amazingly thick, cream head with good retention and lacing. Roasted malts and chocolate combine to make a medium-bodied, very smooth, creamy, malty, sweet brown ale with subtle hints of robust coffee with a finish that’s only lightly ‘hoppy’ and not bitter tones."
"Overall I like it, but it's quite different from the regular brown ales I have had."
"This a good beer and very drinkable ranks up there with DFH India brown ale and Bell's Best though Bells is more of a traditional brown."
"Pours from the can with a deep, nearly opaque chestnut brown and a billowy beige head that laces nicely against the walls of the glass. The aroma is light and clean, with some dry nuttiness, a hint of sweet milk chocolate, and a bit of a mineral-like character. The flavor is slightly more substantial, but still not dense, with a pleasant combination of light caramel, candied cashews, and a bit of mossy hops and smoldering firewood to balance. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but that does help this one go down even easier. Overall, this isn't the boldest or most flavorful American brown, but it is an easy-drinking selection that isn't going to turn anyone off."
"Glad to find this one in cans, my preferred serving method at home. Poured a dark brown color, with a nice cap of light brown foam. Good chocolatey nose, with hints of coffee and roasted nuts. On the palate, rich and medium bodied, with flavors of with roasted malt, caramel and milk chocolate."
"... garnet/ruby/russet (add that to the data bank) with NE-quality clarity and cola highlights. Beautiful. The nose was immediately rich with vanilla notes and leaning in, I also got milk chocolate and an almond nuttiness. Was I drinking a beer or having a dessert? Mouthfeel was medium, but on the upper end, approaching creaminess. Lots of flavors going on in the mouth, but you had better like sweets. I got got milk chocolate, almonds or peCANs, and even a light smokiness. Fantastic! Finish was somewhat on the sweet side for my taste, but there was nothing wrong with it stylistically. I would definitely put some in my cooler for the malty beer set."
"Overall - not a bad brew at all, but a little plain tasting in my opinion. However, it's not bland at all, I just don't pick up anything super special about it. Still tastes good, just not interesting."
"Rich, transparent brown color with a medium sized, frothy off white/tan head. Sweet brown ale malt characteristics in the nose, some tame leafy hops as well. Light/medium in body, the beer is creamy while still remaining crisp and refreshing. An awesome brown ale."
"EXCELLENT, MUST TRY!"
"Overall: A pretty decent version of a brown ale. On the sweeter side but has enough balance to make it a pretty good brew."
"This was a very nice take on an American Brown Ale from Avery, with the type of full flavored profile that seems to be sorely missing from this style lately. I really dug this one and I’m really glad that they have this available in cans now."
"I love these little cool 12oz cans and also when someone loves their dogs as much as i do especially when i see they named their brew after her cos firstly it shows passion and honestly if i had my own brewery id do exactly the same and it pours a deep mahogany hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a nice two finger head and clingy lacing here and there,the smell is sweet bready malts,dark plums,brown sugar,a touch of vanilla and a very subtle light fruity hoppiness,it has a light-medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of vanilla,light chocolate,brown sugar,hazelnuts and is finished with just a touch of subtle light fruity hops that really evens out the tailend of this drop to make it a very sessionable ABA and i will buy again without doubt."
"Appearance is a brown color with a good sized off-white head to it. Its` smell is faint overall, but has some fruit along with some malt. The taste is roasted malts on the lighter side for the most part, well balanced. MF is medium, ok carbonation. Ellie`s is a pretty nice brown ale."
"Not sure where I stand on this beer. Enjoyed, but not savoured."
"Drunkability: Great smell, and good taste. Parts of the palate are very complex but others are rathar lifeless (mineral water)."
"Not my favorite brown, but it rates in the top ten for sure. Easy to drink and tasty. Mmmm."
"This is a good beer, but what exactly is the difference in a porter and a brown ale? Cause this honestly tastes more like an american style porter than a brown ale."
"Overall a beer I will look for again. Enough flavors to keep you guessing and enough heft to make you appreciate the flavors. To bad the aroma is lacking"
"The brewery makes several beers on my want list so I thought I'd give it a try. I was hoping it would be a little more stark, more porter like, but it's definitely a brown ale, a thin one at that. There is a bitterness too, detracting from the overall experience, in my opinion. I taste nuts, dried fruit -- that's about it."
"Dark red-brown beer with about a finger of bubbly head that dissolves pretty slowly. Plenty of lacing as the glass is emptied. Roasty caramel and chocolate aromas with some slight citrus and coffee. Tart coffee and dark chocolate seem to be the dominant flavors, with some fruit and spices on the back end. Great balance of bitter and sweet. Nice, full-bodied ale, but goes down easily. Overall a pretty enjoyable drinking experience."
"Yeah, that's a very enjoyable sweet, yet sessionable, beer. I'm a fan."
"O – One of the better Browns I’ve tasted. Quite drinkable, but a little too sweet for me as a session beer. 3.5"
"Overall this is a nice brown ale, not as thick as I really like but definitely a brew worthy of trying in the brown ale category."
"The beer pours a clear, dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is full of roasted malt and chocolate. It is not overpowering, but it is a very nice aroma and exactly what I expect in this style of beer. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of milk chocolate with a little toasted malt and caramel malt. There is a little bit of pecan or hazelnut flavor and quite a bit of brown sugar and sweet malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very easy to drink, very nice brown ale."
"Caramel and molasses seem to be in the mouthfeel, bitterness wanes as more of the sweet and smooth side finally come out. A little more complex than your average brown ale."
"I figured I would give this one a straight up pour since I usually tilt the glass and go for a smaller head, then read about them in the other reviews. Ended up with a good 2 finger or so head, tan in color on the very dark brown beer. The head was slow to dissipate, and the lacing stuck around for a while. Smells nice and thick, with a caramel hint and what I would call more cocoa than chocolate. It has a deep malty taste and the cocoa really stays with you throughout, with the beer almost clinging to the sides of your mouth. Not bad, but a little strong with the cocoa. I've had other brown ales that I would prefer over this, though it isn't one I would push away. Call it an average brown ale from my standpoint."
"Excellent showing for the style."
"Very nice Brown Ale."
"Overall: I like it. This is a great beer. In my top 2 American Browns. Will flip between this and Smutty's dog!"
"Sampled from a can with no freshness date. Deep mahogany in color with excellent clarity. Started with a fluffy, light beige head that reduced to a wispy cap and a few wet lacings on the glass. Sweet molasses and nutty aromas are prominent, with hints of dark roasted malt and floral hops. Medium bodied with pleasnant carbonation and a smooth feel. Sweet caramel malt and nutty flavors in the beginning with nice floral hoppy flavors through the middle and a clean finish. PLeaant floral hoppy character seems to creep back in after the finish. Not your tyical brown ale. Lots of flavor and aroma complexity."
"Mouthfeel goes from creamy to sour really fast. Smooth carbonation let's the malts shine but a bitterness that reminds me of burnt coffee is present. Still a great beer and one that's easy to drink and vey satisfying."
"O - a good brown ale that's well worth a try."
"Not the best brown I've ever had, but very well done. I'll return to this one if I run across it again."
"Dark brown color with a nice thick, tan head. Promises lots of malt and delivers... too much. This beer was cloyingly sweet for me. Needed a bit more balance for a brown ale. Not too much body to it, pretty thin for an ale as well. Malt is not overpowering at all, but somehow the sugar is. I'm sure there are some nuts in there as well, but all I tasted is sweet."
"Overall: A definite winner and one of my favorite brown ales."
"Smooth, creamy mouthfeel that goes down easy. I enjoyed this very much."
"Taste is excellent, firm and deep character with nutty-chocolate toasty bread, lightly sweet caramelized barley yup front, then more balanced and drier finish with light woody-peppery-earthy bitterness. Feel is nice, full, lightly creamy. Overall, this is excellent."
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured red with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of roasted malt, caramel, dark chocolate, and subtle wheat. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this wasn't too bad of a Brown Ale. The bitterness and sweetness in this one were quite well balanced. With that, this was not the best Brown I've had but still pretty good. For me, if the roastiness was toned down a little bit to allow some of the other elements to shine through this one would have been much better. I would definitely have this one again though."
"O: Very solid brown ale. Probably one of the better I have had so far. Could easily sit back and drink a few of these. Liked how it was a bit lighter than most browns, but didnt lose anything in terms of flavor."
"Overall, a great brown ale, with a nice balance between the roasted sweet notes, and the light bitter crispness. Great sipper, and something good to have on standby in the fridge if you like brown ales."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty good, straight forward Brown Ale. Nothing over complicated, just easy to drink and enjoyable. Would make for a great session beer. Worth a try if you see it. This beer reminds me of Fall, but could also be enjoyed in the Winter and on into Spring."
"On the beer take-home scale I would grab a case and keep this one as one of the staples."
"Dark brown with ruby highlights when backlit and a fine mocha head that leaves rings of crusty lace on the glass. Coffee, chocolate and nice floral hops make for a tasty smelling beer. Cocoa powder and java with some nice fruity hoppiness to balance nicely. Medium bodied with slightly stinging carbonation. Easy drinking and delicious, a really good brown ale."
"Overall a nice bold tasting brown ale, typical of the style. Smooth, creamy and easy to drink."
"I am hooked from the first taste of Avery Brewing Ellie's Brown Ale. A gorgeous light mahogany color with a sticky light tan head. Very nutty and roasted, but not much smoke or charring. The finish is dry, woody, and earthy. Lots of bittersweet chocolate and maybe even some brown sugar in there. An average 5.5% ABV, but that's fine, because this is one you'll want to drink all night."
"Very enjoyable and drinkable brew, I could easily put away a sixer of these, I'd like to try from the bottle to see if it improves carbonation and erases that tart aftertaste."
"In all another good american beer, I'll put it on my grocery list next time in the states."
"This is a very good brown ale that is a good representation of the style."
"Drinkability- Wow! This was extremely good! I'm wondering if it was a good idea to switch to Goose Island and 312 or should I have stayed on this beer to see if it really was drinkable. I say it was enjoyed without a struggle at all! Try it!"
"DRINKABILITY: This beer would make a good session beer for watching a football game or for a long-lasting game of cards, but otherwise is not particularly distinguished in any way. It's easy to drink repeatedly over the course of a night and has decent value. All in all, I'd buy, and drink, it again."
"Pours a brownish with some nice red tint. A good amount of white head. Lots of lacing and an okay look. Smells sweet and malty. Fairly non-descript. Overall, not very impressive. The taste leaves a lot to be desired. Not very tasty but not bad in any way. Highly carbonated. Sweet and a bit bitter from the roast. Pretty drinkable but overall not very impressive"
"D-very drinkable. Done with my taste in no time."
"Nothing barn-burning, but a decent ale all around. Highly drinkable and well-brewed."
"Cocoa and toasted biscuits, lots of chocolate notes and hints of coffee and earthy, ashy notes. The color is the same as chocolate milk, and there is a muddy, dirty consistency. Quite chewy and thick brown ale. Easy to drink this, but a bit on the thick side for its style. A little chalky and heavy. Nice complex flavor and armoa profile."
"Another craft brewery starts producing some of their year round products in cans. Ellie's Brown pours out a chestnut brown color, with a large, creamy white head. Coffee and caramel come to mind upon smelling, followed by some herbal tea characters, and a hint of smoke. More of the same from the flavors, with the mouthfeel being medium and creamy. Drinkability is superb, as it is loaded with complexities, yet still easy and approachable. This brown has session ale written all over it."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a good level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good brew, and is one of the better brown ales I've had. It goes down easily and is something that is definitely enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Very good beer, it seems like it is almost a chocolate stout masquerading as a brown ale. Could probably have this multiple times in one night."
"This is a fantastic brown ale-enormous aroma, great flavor, silky smooth, and easy to drink. I could sit around and drink these all night."
"Not too shabby. The Pils was better, but this one is not bad either. A little bit better balance of the malt and hops would be welcome."
"Pours a deep amber to brown-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, chocolate and roasted malt. In the taste, just like the aroma, chocolate and roasty malt, with a small hop presence. A small bite and a medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry roast of chocolate. More a porter than a brown, light body, but ok."
"Flavors are pretty simple but very appealing light coffee, chocolate and roasted grains with a light/medium bitter end palate and finish. Simple but appealing and drinkable."
"D- Very drinkable. At first I did not enjoy the bitter roastiness, but it has grown on me. It balances the sweetness and leaves me craving the next sip."
"Notes: A solid brown ale. Nothing like the ""classic"" brown, but definitely preferred to it."
"Would I buy more of it? - I definitely would, although my wife would probably drink it before I did. She loves brown ales and she loves dogs."
"Taste is roasted malt primarily, but a slight bit of sweetness and a tinge of hops. I get a bit of chocolate, but its not really predominant at all. Overall its just a medium bodied standard brown ale, that makes for an enjoyable drink."
"Pours a murky light brown with thin spots of off-white head, little retention and lacing. Scent brings lightly sweet malt and roasted nuts, some earthyness and well and a somewhat defined hop charachter, stronger than most in style. Taste is nutty and lightly sweet as the scent would dictate, earthy hop qualities and some breadyness as well. Lighter side of medium bodied, its only major knock, decent level of lower carbonation, somewhat dry. A decent beer undone by its weaker body."
"D- A servicable brown. A decent offering worth a try."
"This brew pours a muddy brown one finger head that dissipates to a ring. The nose is of dark fruit and a sort of sour with dark chocolate. The taste is dark fruit bitter chocolalte. The mouthfeel is creamy light. Drinkability is good. This is a good one to enjoy ona regular basis."
"Overall this brew is very drinkable, even with a low ABV it still has rich flavors that make this a very drinkable."
"D- i find this to be an under appreciated beer in a style that usually isnt one of my favorites. easy to finish and im happy that i decided to go with the whole sixer instead of a single."
"This is a much darker brown ale than I'd expected. It has some great flavors"
"-Bye"
"Avery Brewing Company--Ellie's Brown Ale--2011 12 oz. Bottle. 5.50% ABV. 17 IBU's. (2.5 / 5.0) Thin pour. Lacy foamy lasting off white light tan head. Clear bright dark ruby edged black brown color. Soft cocoa mild hop front. Thin dry sweet fully fermented thin textured crisp light toasted cocoa biscuit smoewhat bland brown ale body. Slightly herbal mild hop spice clean dry end. Weak flavored too dry too thin Brown. Remember it being better. Sampled 2/16/2011. Purchased 6-Pack for $6.99 @ The Greenwood Market, Seattle on 2/16/2011."
"M - medium/medium-heavy; creamy; noticeable carbonation."
"D - This brown is very drinkable, I could order one after another with this one, even have a sixer of it. That being said the flavors seem to be very subdued causing me to drink more for the soft flavors that it offers. I think it's good but I do prefer a richer American brown than this, but I did enjoy the buttery flavors in this one and i'd drink it again. Worth a try for sure. Cheers!"
"D: Well enough on drinkability. This beer offers nothing special though, which isn't bad but should be mentioned."
"Ellie's Brown Ale, on tap. Pours a dark brown with a small off white head and no lace to speak of. Malty aroma, which is also there in the taste. Nutty, roasted malt and a very small hop presence. Medium bodied, a bit thin. Drinkability is very good, a nice sessionable brown with no frills, but thats not necessarily a bad thing."
"Pours dark brown with a nice brown long lasting head. Aroma of caramael, cacao, dark malts, light hops. Taste of caramel, toffee, some cacao notes. Palate is nice full body, nice carbonation. Taste is caramel, toffee, cacao. Nice malty, nutty, toffee finsish. A smooth easy drinking Brown Ale. Very nice"
"12 oz bottle. Pours light brown with a short lived off white head. Bready aroma, with notes of brown sugar, molasses and piney hops. Medium, creamy body. Flavor is of nuts, roasted malt, dark fruit, and brown sugar. Some hints of hops. Long dry finish from roasted malt. Very tasty brown."
"I dont think Id drink this beer again but it was nice that it was light because I just had a big lunch!"
"Medium bodied, creamy, with moderate carbonation. The low-ish ABV akes this sessionable - glad I bought a can, though a pitcher would be fine too!"
"Poured a deep brown with a feathery two fingered tan head with a fair amount of lacing the entire glass. Aromas of roasted malts, carmel, and chocolate. Complex on the palate with coffee semi-sweet chocolate and molasses tones. A smooth medium bodied ale with nice carbonation. Two thumbs up!"
"Nice Red/Brown color. Had a thick head when i poured it into a snifter. Malty smell. Has a malty taste with hints of chocolate coffee and caramel. Good mouthfeel and finishes with a bit of sweetness and a nip on your tongue. Very interesting beer in that the taste evolves from start to finish."
"Ellie has a russet brown look to it with a very thin off white cap that bounced immediately, and this is from a hard pour, no lace. Smells quite roasted and malted and choclated and browned. Taste is quite refreshing a big blast of chocolate, some brownie batter and roasted malts and some nuts at the very end leaving me very satisfied. The feel is smooth and less than medium and is just nice, no blockage. This is perhaps one of the better regular browns i've had recently. Hail everything that is brown, all hail brown."
"D: Good example of the syle. ""Well behaved", goes down easy. Just a bit sweet for my taste, but still good for as couple. Worth a try."
"vanilla. The flavor has notes of semi-sweet chocolate, toast, and sour cherries. The mouthfeel is medium giving way to a filling, minimal drinkability. Avery Ellies Brown Ale is an okay beer with a curious mix of aromas and flavors. Slightly recommended."
"Pours a deep russet brown color with a minimal white head and a little residual lacing. Smells of roasted malts, burnt stuff, and a little hop aroma. Tastes of roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, and some faint caramel notes. Mouthfeel is medium with mild carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"I am not a big fan of brown ales, but this one is quite nice and easy to drink."
"D - Great stuff here. The style may not be 'exciting' but the quality is."
"Love this. For mine this is right in the sweet spot for the ABV."
"Drinkability is good. ABV is just above sessionable. This is a tasty brown that is a good representation of the style."
"A medium bodied, dry brew that's still almost got a porter thickness. Probably couldn't put back so many of these."
"The carbonation seems high and helps to lighten the body and mouthfeel is nice and smooth. This is a great autumn beer."
"Pours a moderate brown color with an off white head and a bit of lacing. Nose is caramel, hints of roasted malt, and a bitt of toffee. Some dry hops. Taste brings a bit of earthy, dry hop bitterness along with a good dose of caramel and toffee with some slightly roasted malt. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. Drinks pretty well, but they don't do it like the folks across the pond."
"D: A nice nose to this beer, but the flavor was not quite as good and well rounded. A little too much bitterness for an English brown, too."
"A solid beer from a great American brewery. Brown ales can be boring -- and I've shied away from them as of late -- so this is a great example of a well-made brew in this category."
"A very good brown ale. I have gotten away from brown ales because of their strong nuttiness or extreme tastes that are not a usual favorite of mine. Ellie's Brown is definitely a well-balanced ale that would be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates quality beer."
"D-very drinkable, low ABV but with rich flavors makes this a very good drinkable beer"
"I need to revisit this again, I think I got an old bottle of this, it was at the store on the shelf unrefrigerated."
"Avery Ellis Brown Ale is a dark wet leathery brown. It has some redness to it and not much of a head. It was one finger thick and disappeared instantly. The nose is rich with malts and burnt peanuts. The malts carry over to the taste. I pick up a lot of sweet malt and some brown sugar. The finish is subtle but lingering. Some smoke sticks in the back of the throat. Definitely a food beer that would complement anything off the grill. The first thing I think of are some shish kabobs with pork, venison or beef smothered in molasses and sweet bar-b-q sauce with cherry tomatoes, green peppers onions, and maybe some seedless jalapenos."
"The body is on the extremely drinkable side of medium. Crisp carbonation accompanies and a slick feel and a dry finish. Never too cloying for a beer lover who doesn't necessarily enjoy browns, and certainly not too much for a novice. Could session this one all night."
"D - High. Lower ABV, and a malty but not cloying Brown Ale from Avery."
"Overall/notes: Certainly, this is a well-made beer. It's hard for met to enjoy brown ales, and only drink them when in the mood. This served me quite well. I won't buy it any time soon, but should the mood strike me, I don't see any reason to avoid it."
"D_Very delicious plus low ABV = Extremely drinkable and session able ale."
"Had this a few times, but basing this rating on the draft I had at the Griffon (21Aug10). Pours a beautiful mahogany brown, with a light tan / chestnut head that manages nice retention. The smell is pretty fantastic... hazelnut, light roasty malts and some toffee / caramel prevail. Taste is more of the same - a little bit of roasted malt, with a good bit of hazelnut and some chocolate malt, too. Hop bitterness provides balance to the malt sweetness, and nothing more - nothing too crazy going on, hop-wise. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, creamy and smooth... very drinkable. Seems like it would be a good fall / early winter brew - will probably stock up when it starts getting cooler."
"D: Perfectly ""quaffable"" as the bottle mentions. It's smooth with a great array of flavors, none of which is overbearing, and all of which work together in great complement. This is my standard-bearer for English Brown."
"D: yes, please! I could enjoy this all day!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. It starts sweet but finishes slighty dry. This is a session beer for people who hate session beers. Easy drinking, low alcohol, but lots of flavor and not too bitter. Just as an English brown should be and so much better than that Nukey brown we used to drink."
"Taste is somewhat complex. Some sweet roasted malts and heavy dark chocolate....some raisin/plum....and a bit hoppiness at the backend. The malt taste is actually a bit richer and heavier than I would have expected from style. Chocolate and sweet roasted malts stick around for a while. Definitely a brown ale with some kick."
"D: I will definitely considering having this beer again because its flavors are rather interesting and the low alcohol content makes it very sessionable."
"I'd recommend it as a good beer to relax with."
"A lower ABV makes the beer thoroughly drinkable, and sessionable besides. I wish I had another six pack. This is a heartier brown ale than many, and is one of my top five browns out of several dozen I've tasted."
"Pours a dark brown with reddish highlights. Smells of ripe fruit, and a hint of hay. Taste is light brown bread up front, with a very herbal, leafy bitterness defining the middle and finish. A hint of smoke in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good, low carbonation. Decent drinkability, I would get this again."
"D: A wonderfully drinkable brown ale."
"The body is pretty full, but the carbonation level is moderately high. Could tone this aspect down a smidge. Giving me the hiccups. Great warming flavors of caramel, syrup, toffee, and hints of bittering hops on the finish. Well done. This carries great character of sweetness, with just a touch of bitterness. Very good Brown. Recommend."
"Pours a great dark mahogany with a off white low but steady head. Smells absolutely wonderful. toffee caramel chocolate roasted malt. has a thin a slippery mouthfeel, not heavy or overwhelming at all. tastes of brown sugar roast malt chocolate sweet but well balanced with a medium-high dryness. exceptionally drinkable. love this beer!"
"D: Drinks fairly well for a brown, but it's still on the heavier side of the spectrum."
"D - An easy drinker well balanced brew with dark roasted malts and sweet caramel taste hints of orange peel. I recommend this brew and would get it again!"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint. It appears a dark amber brown color that displays decent clarity around the edges with some ruby and brown tints. Head appears more than a finger strong with fair retension and a tanned appearance that clings with legs of lace about the glass. Aroma is a pleasant mixture of caramel malt sweetness with a note of chocolate, citrus hops and a bit of a mineralish sulfur like scent in the back. Taste includes some toasty malt character with a flavor a bit like toffee and some notes of a seemingly musty coffee. A bit of citrus hops are on the back with a slight bitterness that lingers with a noticeable amount of alcohol character for less than 6%. Overall it has a fresh grainy taste that blends well with the other flavors. Medium to light feel with a moderate amount of carbonation with this one. Pretty decent example of the style, I would drink this again."
"12 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Dark brown colour, moderate cream-coloured head. Aroma and flavour of lightly toasted malts, brown bread and nuts. Notes of burnt bread crumbs in the finish. Fairly dry beer. Drinkable, but I'm not overwhelmed."
"Overall, a descent brown ale. Flavors are well balanced and also more roasted character than I usually experience from the style."
"Impressions: Man, this was delicious. I'm surprised this isn't more popular, not that I'm complaining. This one will please any brown ale fan, but do note that this is not a very hoppy (Indian style) brown ale like the kind that have become so popular now. Malt profile is definitely at the forefront."
"Drinkability: As far as brown ale goes this one is not exactly as I'd expect it to be. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing, sure it's pretty hoppy when it comes to the aforementioned style but overall I'd say it's worth at least one-two-five tries."
"Drinkability: it's alright,"
"d-super easy drinker. I can see this one entering the cooler anytime I'm looking for some easy drinking tasty beers for an afternoon."
"This is a solid beer, and is even worth having once at least; it has some unique flavors, and while you won't be blown away it certainly could be a good session beer (especially at the price)."
"D-Really easy drinking, solid brown. A little on the dry side for my tastes but that's just me being a little fussy."
"There's lots of brown ales out there, but this is certainly one to have again."
"It is not bad, but just a bit too sweet for me."
"D-great complex malt profile. Smooth drinking. I would drink this again."
"I haven't found a bad Avery. Nice session brew."
"D - A good brown ale to be sure, it compliments the fall-like feel of the day. Delicious and fairly complex. Nicely crafted and good as a session beer too!"
"D - Very refreshing beer. Even though it is technically a dark beer, I would not be opposed to drinking this on a warm day in the sun. It is just refreshing enough to pull off a great balance."
"Overall: Overall, I'd say it was an average brown ale with nothing too special coming across."
"D: Could easily knock back a few of these, a definite session beer in my book. I'll admit EBAs aren't my favorite but this one is high on the list when I'm looking to switch things up."
"This beer pours a very ""ruby/brown"" color and forms a tan head. It has a toasted head aroma, along with hints of woodsy, floral, and an almost fruity smell. As far as the taste goes, it comes across with a sugary nuttiness and with bits of caramel and very clean barley taste. This is one of the better English Brown Ales I've had in quite and some time and I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes EBA's."
"It's a good beer to drink when you can smell your dog, but she is out for a walk."
"D - I can drink a few of these no problem, very drinkable, not my favorite brown ever but rates pretty darn high."
"A very tasty beer that is spot on for a brown ale, and is very drinkable with the nice sweet malt flavors coming through for the entire drink in a nice variety that beckons the use of the word robust. I recommend trying this beer, as it was another solid offering from Avery."
"Hops are present and help provide a dry finish."
"D: A nice offering from Avery. I'm glad I picked it up."
"I am a big fan of English Browns, and I must say, this is a very very fair representation of the style. The smell doesn't draw me in quite as much as say, a Sam Smith's brown, but the taste is spot on and definitely delicious. I have to agree with the Bros- I'm not sure what's up with browns and dog references on the label...it's a bit tiresome at this point. But, I will definitely forgive this ""lab-tested"" brew since it is very tasty. Very easy drinking and definitely a solid brown ale. Will be having this one again without a doubt, although it is not widely available in Chicagoland. Received this as part of a mixed 12 pack from World Market if I'm not mistaken. On another note, this would be a good stepping stone for a novice beer lover. Newcastle or the like for starters, then something like this, and then on to some serious brown ales! Hey Avery, how about a bourbon barrel variation? (which could exist and I'm ignorant to its existence!)"
"Poured a filtered light brown (slightly red when held up to light), with a very thin off-white head that didn't lace very well. The smell was very, very feint; roasted malt and brown sugar. The taste didn't yield much flavor at all, just very feint hints of roasted malt. The mouthfeel was very thin for a brown ale, but I guess it did help its sessionability."
"Aroma is simultaneous coffee, chocolate, and malty nuttiness. Fairly strong and pleasant, providing a nice introduction to the similar flavors. Full body, warm and nutty with mild roast evoking chocolate and mild coffee again. Just rich enough and flavorful. A nice session brown ale."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Stella glass. Beer pours a deep brown color with cobweb style good lacing that eventually disippates. Taste is of roasted malt and slight coffee with a bit of toffee, nice slight hop finish on the back of your tongue. Smell is sweet, again of toffee, and brown sugar, mouthfell is good with a nice amount of carbonation and a hop bitterness that keeps you coming back for another sip. Drinkability is very sessionable, but can be a little rich for some. Try it if you see it"
"This beer is light to medium bodied and goes down really well. It also has a bit of a refreshing aftertaste as well."
"Drinkability: a go to for a highly drinkable brown ale."
"Drinkability is very high. I was impressed with this one. One of the better brown ales I have had in a while. Lots of great flavors, and an ABV level that makes this one sessionable."
"Overall, this is a fine brown ale, especially for fans of nut browns."
"D: Respectable and it certainly is easy to drink. Not one of Avery's best offerings. Nothing to complain about, but nothing too memorable either."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet. Very lustrous appearance, frothy creamy light khaki head and big crimson brown body. Leaves moderate lacing, aroma consists of brown malt, brown sugar and maple syrup with heavy cream. The taste was all brown sugar and brown malt, not a very complex beer but it doesn't need to be. Vanilla extract adds a lighter cream character with birch in the finish. Mouthfeel was light and fluffy with a medium body. Very drinkable, the definition af a session brown ale."
"D- Delicious brown ale. I'd recommend it."
"the flavor is nice, but wow they have done a number to make this more hiccup-inducing than soda pop. the body's mouthfeel and accompanying appearance issues are too much for me to recommend this as being drinkable."
"Drinkability: Incredible brown ale that I would probably go back to again and recommend to friends."
"Overall, a very good brown ale that sides toward the malts more than the hops. Highly enjoyable, the one I had went down way too fast and left me wanting another."
"Drinkability: while this beer is not bad at all, it really just doesn't float my boat. It's not a bad thirst slaker, though."
"Mouthfeel is good and very drinkable."
"Overall, I really was excited to try this beer. Just doesn't seem like something Avery would intentionally brew. I'm blaming this review either on its age or the fact that the sixer tipped over in my trunk (although they didn't spew upon opening). There was way too much carbonation in the head and in the mouthfeel. I believe Brownies should have a good, full malty body and you can't attain that with this amount of carbonation."
"I can't give it good drinkability - I'm not going to finish the one in front of me. Too fricking bad I bought a six pack! Dang! I wonder what this is like fresh - what other hop aromas and bitterness is going on? Well, being in NY and not inclined to buy another I guess I'll never really know, will I?"
"This is an American brown ale."
"D: A solid brown ale for the money. I could easily have a few of these after a long day."
"This went down quite quickly actually. I would like to note that it looks almost as good as it tastes. The lack of head actually gives this a water downed look because the head is so thin it just looks like a slim layer of water on top."
"The mouthfeel is full, smooth, and creamy."
"Pours a clear, deep ruby-brown with a finger of off-white head that's slow to dissolve. The aroma is toasted nutty goodness with some chocolate and brown sugar notes. The flavor is nutty malt forward with some more brown sugar, burnt toast crust and a little chocolate. This brown ale is medium bodied with a strong amount of carbonation. This is everything a brown ale should be. Packed full of malt flavor with a nice body. Didn't let me down."
"On tap at Smoken Joe's. Served in a 16 oz mug. Extremely dark brown color. Minimal amount of head, but a good amount of lacing on the glass. Smell reminded me of a nice rich porter. Flavor was much lighter but just as savory. Chocolate and malt wash over the palate. Very light and smooth, and easy to drink. Pairs nicely with the rich bbq sauce on my ribs. I could have drank this all night long."
"A great English-style brown ale. As I come to appreciate this style more and more, I find myself picking this up at my store fairly often."
"Tastes mild with a soft toffee, coffee aftertaste. Overall it is very easy to drink and a good session beer. I am a sucker for chocolate labs so the artwork is a plus."
"D - Excellent, the body and balance of the flavors make this a great session beer."
"M/D-This wonderful offering from Avery goes down so creamy and smooth. And it has a very big body for the abv. It's sweet but dry in the finish. Very nice beer indeed."
"Notes: Hmm, nice beer but not one that I will be drinking at home. But if it is an available choice on a medium selection bar I´ll sure could pick it up happily. It might be good to keep a couple of bottles at home though, to offer them to guests willing to try a good craft beer on the malty side. It´s a nice standard."
"Poured a dark brown with a two-finger almost tan head that left some lace down the glass. A sweet, even spicy malt base makes up the aroma as caramel, roasted and some bread along w/ minor hops are all in there. Taste is more of the same, although slightly sharp on my tongue. A smooth, almost creamy medium-bodied beer with caramel and hints of chocolate malts along with a touch of bread malt that not only lets the beer be sweet but balances it out and gives it a slightly dry backbite. Hops are minimal although there are hints of fruit in this beer. Just a great sessionable ale that is nice to have while at a bar and having something to eat."
"From bottle on August 8, 2009. Pours a clear, dark brown/amber with dark beige head, mostly diminishing. Aroma of caramel, chocolate, malts, nuts. Well-balanced with smooth finish. Just a wee bit sweet for my liking, but a good offering of the style. Lacing remained throughout. Have to admit this would probably be more inviting around fire on a crisp late autumn evening."
"Got a sixer of these. Really nice brown color with a solid head on top, leaves a touch of lacing. Flavor is exactly what you're looking for in a brown. Nice caramel malt, with some fruity hints. Toss a bit of chocolate and cookies in there as well. Well balanced with a nice hop presence. Really feeling this one - would definitely grab a bottle of this again."
"Taste is of chocolate richness up front, malt backbone to it, finish has quite a bit of bitterness though it is a mixture of hop bitterness and bitter chocolate in the finish - quite tasty! Light to medium body, moderate carbonation - little light for the style, but finishes rather clean, goes down easily and is a perfect nightcap!"
"Like most of the Avery stuff I have tried, now time for one of my more liked styles. Pours a nice dark brown, moderate head/lacing to it. Nice caramel/biscuity smell to it. Taste is nice and full with a nice mouthfeel, medium body to it and some nice nuttiness and caramel malts, also with a hint of chocolate possibly? Subtle hopping gives it a nice kick... nothing too crazy here but definitely an above average brown ale."
"Mouthfeel is too watery and thin. Avery is a bit of a hit or miss brewery for me."
"Taste has a great malt-hop balance with mild citrus hops in the forefront, which has me thinking of DFH's Indian Brown. As a result of the hops, however, mouthfeel isn't as creamy as I like in a brown. Not bad, but not my favorite. Overall, each category is a winner except for mouthfeel, which hinders the beer's drinkability for me."
"This is one of the best English-style browns on the block and is definitely a wonderful addition to Avery's sampler pack."
"Drinkability: This is an OK brown ale, but I'm not really interested in having more than one and will probably not seek it out in the future."
"Drinkability: This is a decent brown ale and a one trick beer. Not a bad one, but nothing that jumps out. I would just as well pass next time."
"Drink an easy drinker."
"Pours an orange brown with fast fading head. Smell: roasted, sweet caramel, a little cocoa and hazelnut, leafy hops. Taste: caramel, roasted flavors, a bit of milk chocolate, just as it seems like it's going to just be sweet, earthy hops kick in. Medium bodied with ok carbonation. A nice brown, very sessionable."
"The drinkability is pretty good as well, this is my least favorite Avery offering to date, and it isn't bad at all."
"Drink ability is above average. Brown ales are my favorite session beers and this is one of the few local browns i've had. I would drink it again but its nowhere near my top picks for a brown ale"
"S -"
"D: Nice flavors good ABV... leaves you wanting some more... Very nice English Brown Ale."
"12 ounce bottle poured into my shaker glass. Appears a clear medium brown color with about a finger of light tan head. No lacing to speak of. Smells and tastes of mild nuts (hazelnuts), a touch of milk chocolate, lightly roasted grains and a hint of caramel. Medium bodied with ample carbonation. A decent brown ale to have on hand."
"pours crystal dark brown with a 2 finger head that fades very fast but leaves notches all down the glass. not much nose on this one but some faint grassy hops? tastes hits you upfront with the bitter hops then moves to sweet roasted malts. mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. if you enjoy a nice sessionable brown this is a great full flavored beer. i could put down several anytime of year"
"D- Delicious brown with a unique hop profile"
"The taste and mouthfeel on this are about what I would expect from an English brown ale. Very, very mild with no remarkable characteristics other than a touch of sweet malt. Avery does a fine job on this beer that I just don't care for from a style standpoint. Works well with pizza."
"Not much to say in this review. Pours dark brown, sticky lacing, nice biscuity head that lingers. Smells mostly of sweet dark malt, with a bit of nuttiness. Taste is sweet malt tempered by nuttiness, and just enough hops to be refreshing. Medium body, bready and filling without being overbearing. Good carbonation, maybe a bit thin. Superb drinkability, a great session beer all the way through."
"D=very drinkable have had a few longer sessions with this beer at a local pub."
"If the ABV weren't where it was I would call it sessionable but seeing as how big we are all becoming, maybe our session beers need to increase in size as well. A remarkable tasty brown ale that goes down easy, does not ask questions and does not want any questions asked about it."
"I wasn't expecting much from this one, but boy, am I glad I tried it! The flavors blend so well and it feels so smooth, I couldn't help but love it. Definitely give this a shot if you can get it."
"12 oz. Solid brown pour, surprisingly sturdy cream colored head. Smells of light roast malt and nut. Very slight chocolate, otherwise nice molasses and roasted malts flavors. Just enough hop bitterness finishing out. Drinkable for sure. Pretty darn good, maybe one of the best browns I've had."
"Very drinkable. Might be too sweet after a bunch, but no less tasty."
"Got this one based on seeing it highly rated on the best of listings. Brew poured to a nice brown color with some red highlights. Good sized light tan head that broke down quite quickly tonight there was a steady film of foam that left some nice lacing. Real nice malt aroma here, solid chocolate aroma comes out, sweet as well, roasted, slightly nutty. Wow, at first I can see why this brew is listed as one of the better Brown Ales, simply fantastic malt flavor. Very similar to what we saw in the aroma, chocolate flavor at first then a caramel like finish. Some nut like flavors seem to poke through. Slight hop presence at the later half that is nice and goes along real well with the malts. The only detractor that I have on this one as I am nearing the end of it the sweetness or chocolate just seem to be turning me a bit. Overall I think this is a good brew, would clearly get this one again but feel that I have some browns that are just as available or more and a bit better."
"Poured a deep brown/mahogany color. Smelled roasted malts and some sublte hops in the background. Taste is of sweet malt and is very smooth, may even be a tad thin.. Beer is carbonated appropriately and medium bodied bordering on light bodied. I think this is a nice beer to drink all night long."
"An enjoyable style, though not my fave, from a wonderful brewery. For what it's worth, I had this at RFD in Washington, DC. (See My Review)"
"Pours a pale reddish colored body, cloudy. small off-white head, diminishing. Fruity aroma, roasted. little aroma. Light malty chocolately taste. some smokey porter taste. Somewhat watery. some roasted taste. carbonated. somewhat skunky taste. very malty."
"Overall: I was really surprised with this beer. Browns can be real hit or miss for me but this one really stands out. According to BA this is an English brown, could have fooled me because I thought this was pretty hoppy. Either way, it's a great brown ale that's definitely worth picking up."
"Prosit!"
"These go down pretty easy. Got a single/orphan bottle on the discount shelf, which is a bummer, as I think they won't be restocking anytime soon. This one isn't perfect, but is worth finding and trying."
"Reminds me why I love brown ales."
"Conclusion: This is a nice, straightforward brown ale; it's especially nice because it's not overly sweet; this is one of the better Avery offerings I've tried so far!"
"Tasty, but a bit sweet overall."
"It's a little too sweet and the finish is more assertive than I like in an English Brown."
"D: Some holes in the smell and feel, but this beer tastes really good. Hey, there's certainly nothing offensive here. I want to try it again, but a warmer serving temperature and maybe try a more vigorous pour."
"Drink: Goes down pretty well, pretty drinkable. Nothing special though in my opinion."
"The aroma was nutty and a little chocolately. The taste was semi dry with a nut brown flavor throughout. There was a little bit of bite of bitterness on the finish. Overall a solid brown ale that should be sold more in the NW. I am not a huge brown ale fan but this is one of the better ones I can say i have had in the past year. Picked it up a Belmont Station."
"Rich ruby red, with a thick cover of tan foam. Dark fruit and toasted grain nose. Smooth, medium body with a low-ish carbonation. Light toasted bitterness along with lots of fruit and molassesy sugars. A hint of alcohol shows through adding a bit oomph. Overall, a solid brown ale with a rich mouthfeel and decent flavours."
"Drinkability: A decent beer belonging to a style I could do without, though it wasn't unenjoyable. Avery's regular brews don't quite seem to live up to their bigger ones, though I do have to say I think this is one of the better ones in their regular production lineup. Sessionable, if that's your thing, and also nutty, if perhaps it's that."
"Notes: An excellent beer worth buying a six pack and having a good session with burgers and fries. As a brown ale fan of both US and UK I have to say this was great."
"Clear brown coloration with an amber tinge, above average clarity for the hue, the head a good 1-2 fingers deep at first with a steady dissipation thereafter. Roasted coffee beans, heavy cream and raw dough and nuts blossom first in the nose, while the toastiness of malts seem in charge, the more bitter hops quietly insinuate themselves into the arena, unrolls slowly as you sniff. Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation noticeably roils things up from the first sip and gets them flowing. Caramel, coffee bean, vanilla, pecans and brown sugar don't become too sweet for this reason, in turn this also permits the hops to blend grain, oat and mineral water accents into the mix. Does thin out at the end, however, this fits with the overall mouth feel. Requires a touch more decisiveness."
"D = This was kind of a mixed bag as I didn't like the smell and was ambivalent about the mouthfeel. However, the taste really was enjoyable and after each drink, I found myself wanting to take another, so it's hard to say it has anything other than good drinkability."
"D: Very drinkable beer. All the tastes are subtle but there and they all blend really well together. Excellent beer."
"D: This is extremely drinkable and would be a nice session beer. If I see this on tap at one of my favorite watering holes, I might open a session."
"D- Overall a nice brown ale with character but not too showy."
"This is a solid sessionable brew. Straightforward if not exceptional."
"Dark brown colored beer with rapidly fading head.Aroma is nutty.Taste is almonds,sweet bread and caramel.This is one of the best beers I've had in a while.There is absolutely nothing negative to say about this beer.I feel if you haven't tried at least once then your missing something special.Highly recommended and you can bet your sweet ass I will be buying again!!"
"Drinkability: A very, very good brown ale. Great flavor and very drinkable. A well crafted a tastey brew."
"Pours with little tan head that quickly dissipates. Clear darkish brown with a hint of red. Big taste up front with peat and smoke, caramel malts and a bit of butter. Really big initial flavor that disappears remarkably quickly. Some coppery mineral aftertaste, otherwise very minimal and light. Some oily mouthfeel. Quite easy to drink. Overall, some interesting flavors and easy drinkability make for an enjoyable brew."
"D- very nice, a relativly low abv beer that finishes well and does not let down, fans of brown and even stout fans would really dig this beer"
"Seems like a decent session beer."
"M/D - Medium bodied with a very easy drinking feel. Decent carbonation."
"The taste has nutty and molasses hints with a good firm malt character. The finish is smooth with a slight acidic taste. Has a Medium body. Enjoyed very much"
"Once I tasted it I was sure it was an Avery, very nice. One of the better brown ales available. Very nice sweet chocolate, coffee, and floral hops aroma. Flavor of toasted malt and chocolate. Caramel malt aftertaste. All the flavor I wanted out of the style."
"It has a very roasty smell. There is an off white head with a decent amount of retention and tight lace. There is a lot of carbonation in the dark brown body of this beer. The taste is also very roasty with slight chocolate esters. It has a little bit of charred aftertaste. This is a very drinkable beer."
"Notes from 2/20/05"
"it pours up a reddish brown color with a small off white head. the nose is nutty, slight roasty malts, yeasty, bready. the taste has a big nutty flavor, slight smokey malt, downright delicious, medium bodied, low carbo, Ellie the dog..."
"Pours dark brown with a thin, lacing head. The aroma has some good notes, but it has an unpleasant funkiness to it. The flavor is good for a brown ale. Not too sweet, with enough earthy hops to keep it interesting. Avery usually has a good interpretation of styles, and I can see where they went with this one. I look forward to having a few more of these to see if the ""funk"" can be overlooked."
"D: Drinkability was enjoyable, very slick going down and left a sweet quick fade."
"First time I had seen this brew around so I grabbed some, really enjoy Avery and this was no exception, dog on the label looked just like my chocolate lab at home, would drink again, recommended"
"The second smoothest beer I've had to Samuel Smiths Nut Brown Ale. Rich brown color, with scent of nuts and malt. Amazing malts with a perfect nutty caramel combination flavor. Goes down so easy with the best aftertaste which leaves you wanting more. Can't say to much about this beer other than it's awesome!"
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer, though the mouthfeel could use some work."
"The brew is very refreshing and the taste is well balanced. The 5.80 ABV may sneak up on you a bit. Overall a highly drinkable beer due to its balance of hop notes and malty sweetness. These flavors are subdued and not overbearing."
"Stay thirsty my friends!"
"I'd say this is on the positive side of the Brown Ale ledger."
"I felt that as far as brown ales goes, this is pretty good. Not a huge fan of the style but this was a rather enjoyable brew. Great balance, satisfying, and it went well with our pizza dinner."
"I want to drink more and more of this. I believe this has just become my preferred Brown Ale (unless I find something even more amazing)."
"D: Overall, this isn't a bad beer. It's not exactly the best example of this style, but it's drinkable."
"Not one of Avery's best...that being said, still quite quaffable and a pretty good representation of the style. Probably wont buy again considering the $9 price tag per six-pack at Spec's"
"Fine example of an English brown ale; this one gets it right with the malts & sweetness and smartly tones down the hops."
"Do the dog! This beer is one of the best browns I've ever tasted."
"Drinkability: Not bad! You done good, Ellie. Who's a good doggy? Who's a good doggy?!?"
"D: This is a pretty good little brown ale by Avery showing they can make a good beer and not be over-the-top as they can be, but I love 'em for it. First time seeing this beer in CA, I'd love to try it on-tap."
"Ellie's Brown Ale from Avery pours a deep dark brown with tan head. Chocolate/nutty (think hazelnut and almond)/roasted malt aroma, similar flavor. Very strong coffee notes as well. Brown ales have a reputation as being underwhelming but this manages to pack some flavor. A bit too easy to quaff, one of my favorite beers ever."
"Poured a deep, dark brown with some ruby hues, and a nice head that sits forever as lace across the top. The smell is nutty, obviously, but specifically it reminded me of roasted chestnuts. Plus there is a strong presence of dark, roasted malts, and no trace of hops. The taste is a bit darker than most brown ales I've had, but I was expecting it based on the smell. Chocolate roasted malts up front, combined with the flavor of sweet (but not too sweet) nuts, which finished off with a ligh sweetness from brown sugar and toffee and even a very faint hop bite. A smooth beer with a fairly light mouthfeel, it was very drinkable, flavorful, and refreshing."
"Overall: A solid brown ale and a style that I normally do not enjoy. Could see myself sipping on a few of these in the fall right before it starts to get cold..."
"Drinkability is very nice. This is a good brown ale with a very nice amount of taste with a good nut finish."
"D- Very good beer and easy to drink."
"Poured into a pint glass. Definitely looks and tastes the part of a brown. (Got to love the chocolate lab on the label, btw). Reminds me of the Sam Adams Brown which is actually very tasty. Unfortunately this brown tasted a little thin to me - but I must say that there was some crust around the rim of the bottle where the cap was so I will probably try another one in the future and hope that it's in better shape..."
"Smooth with a medium body that leaves me chewing the aftertaste a little; refreshing and delicious with nice drinkability."
"light body, good carbonation, smooth. sweet flavors, chocolate and carmel. finishes with a breadiness and hoppy flavor. nice maltiness with a little bite."
"Medium body, light carbonation Cery easy to drink. What a session beer."
"Drinkability- Very nice drinking brown ale. Would pick this up more often if it were easier to find. Pretty much clones the Messiah Bold I had last week."
"The mouthfeel is nice and smooth, and the drinkability is excellent. One of the better beers I have tried lately."
"D - Good session beer and interesting complexity."
"Mouthfeel was medium with appropriate carbonation, a bit zingy on the tongue. Not my favorite style but i'll bet it is good with pizza."
"Re-review in Sept 2008. More lacing, retention, and head this time around. I added a half point to the appearance. I would have expected a tad more from a beer as creamy as this. One other noteable comment is that there is a slight bit of chalkiness in the finish. But this is a very fine brown ale."
"Very nice brown ale from Avery I compared this with Tilburg's a true Dutch Brown and liked it a lot. Pours a lucid ameretto color with a decent head. Smells of almonds and a hint of caramel. Tastes well balanced with roasted nuts and a hint of hop bitterness. Served chilled with in a pint glass."
"While it ain't spectacular, this is a very nice beer that I would not mind enjoying anytime."
"Pours a clear brown color with a nice thick egg-shell colored head that left a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is lighter than expected; some roasted nuts and a touch of toasted grains. The taste is of toasted malt, lightly roasted peanuts, and light tea-like hops. The feel is moderate with a fairly balanced profile, perhaps slightly bitter. A solid brown ale in the traditional English sense. No outstanding flavors but no off-putting flavor either. Worth a go."
"D- Its an ok session brew,but would pair nicely with a bacon wrapped fillet(fire up the grill!)this is an above average beer and a nice display of the style"
"D- Certainly not my favorite beer. It was better with some food."
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear brown color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of nuts, toffee with some light molasses. Taste is also dominated by some nuts, light toffee with some huge caramel and molasses malt notes. I didn't discern a large hops presence which surprises me considering this is a brewery known for their extensive use of hops. Nicely done for the style."
"I've had this beer many times in bottles and a couple times on tap at the brewery. This is a great example of a brown ale. Very carbonated and malty with a good amount of hops to keep me interested. This is a very drinkable ale, and I recommend this brew to all."
"Drinkability is good, this is a fine session ale, although perhaps some might find the bitter finish too biting...."
"Not a big fan of browna but this one was nice. Poured a clear dark brown almost black color. The head is flat, and very light tan in color. The aroma is roasted and burnt malt, chocolate, and cream. Very nice for a brown ale. The tastes has both porter and brown ale qualities. Burnt malt and chocolate come across first followed by a nice mild caramel and cream finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation."
"Sorry from the glum review, but sometimes I need to express my feelings about average beer."
"This one ranks in near the bottom of my favorite brown ales. Good flavor but it is just plain lacking in other catagories."
"The body is between mid and full. A nice but light carbonation enhances the earth and body of the beer. Smooth and easy to drink. Overall a good brown."
"Pours a medium brown with reddish hues. About a finger of white head. OK retention, not much in the way of lacing. Aroma is toasted and chocolately malt. Very nicely hopped brown. A nice nutty character along with some bittersweet chocolate. Finish is dry. Medium bodied. Similar characteristics to DFH Indian Brown, but not as good. Still a solid beer."
"I'm not a huge fan of the brown ale style, but Ellie's made me go back to the fridge for a few more."
"Had this one at Moan and Dove. It had a dark appearance when poured and settled with a thin head. There was some amber overtones when looked through in the light. Aromas were overall light malts and some nutty odors. It was a pretty tasty beer, sweet and light. It had a medium body which was great after a night of drinking nothing but stouts. Overall this was a pretty good brown ale."
"Pours a ruby, light garnet red with some ard brown notes. Good head and no bubbling. The aroma is a sweet, yet medium roast and strong toasted malts. The taste is a smooth roast, toast, and bready malt bill. Myabe veen a hint of pecan somewhere in the middle. Great after work beer. Smooth, flavorful and a great English brown ale for a long session."
"D - I can see why this is named after the brewer's chocolate lab...I imagine that the doggie was gentle, easy going, and likable if not all that bright. This beer is a good reliable companion for a session, but it's no AKC champion."
"Pours a clear Coca-Cola color in the glass. I have described the nose as ""brown"" -- hops and malted grains mixed to near-perfection. On the tongue, it's a bit sweet perhaps, but truly great. A smooth, heavenly finish that has in the past moved me to remark, ""This is beer!"""
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured the color of root beer with a 1/2 inch off-white head. Decent head retention left a solid ring around the glass after each sip. Lacing was somewhat thin, but consistent. Nose was sweet, malty and nutty. Taste similar to nose, with a somewhat slick mouthfeel and just enough carbonation to create a good balance in the mouth. Nice malty finish makes this a very sessionable english brown."
"Another great sample from Avery - an American brewery that is perhaps one of the better ones out here in North America... all of the brews I've tried from them have been top-class, and this one continues with the trend... an absolute terrific example of the style, pouring a dark, ruby-red, brown color with minimal head and no lacing... smell is typical brown ale, with slight malts and nutty caramel flavors... taste complements the aroma, with a butter, caramel taste full of sweet, slight brown sugars and an awesome, slightly malty, refershing taste... very good mouthfeel and easy drinkability make this a terrfic depiction of an English Brown Ale... up there with some of the best... Avery's IPA and their White Rascal were great, and this one is up there with them... Awesome sample... Definitely recommended..."
"Best American made English Brown I have ever had. Poured up a nice, rich brown colour with a thick, creamy froth on top. Definitely looked nice. Smelled heavily of various cereals and roasted malts. Perhaps very, very faintly of gingerbread. Very inviting. Nearly bereft of hops as malts dominate almost every facet of flavour here. Very well done. Mouthfeel is smooth and easy to drink and a good weight for the style. Highly drinkable."
"Pours a dark copper-brown color with a frothy tan head. Head is short lived. The aroma is not strong, but a light, sweet malt. The taste follows suit with a very slightly sweet malt flavor. Theres a light bit of roasted malt with some toffee in the background as well. A slight hop bitterness comes through in the aftertaste. This is an easy drinking beer with no over powering flavors. This is Colorado beer is easy to find in the East, and is one we try to keep on hand."
"Truth in advertising; Ellie's pours a nice shade of brown. Not a lot of carbonation, not a strong aroma, but this is what I expect from a brown. Not an IPA, not a stout, something right in the middle. Goes down smooth, a few hints of malt, no fruits nor sweetness, with a light aftertaste. Again, what to be expected from a brown. A nice solid choice is you're looking for a brown ale."
"Nose is a bit leafy and it's strong enough to be noticed, but not so overpowering that it kicks your nose. Flavor is hearty with a kick of tanginess. Robust, but not brutal. Firm but mature tones of malts slide over my tongue. If only that slight zing weren't there, it would be all the better. Feel is nice. Good level of carbonation and a slightly thicker liquid feel. Overall a very good one here. Well made and worth trying. The only detracting feature is that tangy aspect that hits you."
"D: as it says on the bottle, mild mannered, but still enjoyable and very sessionable"
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice foamy head with lots of lacing and great retention. None of the flavors or aromas are particularly strong, but it's a nice balance of sweet malts, nuttiness, and a clean, lightly hoppy finish. Overall sweet quality. Light-bodied, but not watery. This to me is a classic Brown Ale - a wonderful session beer. I could have drank several of these and been satisfied. Good balance, very drinkable. I will definitely return to this Brown Ale again!"
"D- Very good drinker. It was a nice foul weather beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, worth drinking for a while, but it wouldnt be my first choice."
"So here I have another one of the lesser regular lineup Avery brews that I had not had the pleasure of trying yet. I was thrilled to pick up an entire mixed case when I was up in Knoxville of a lot of the brew I cannot get down here. This being one of them. This poured a great caramel color brown with just enough light getting through to give it a sort of off reddish tint. The smallish tan head quickly faded and left behind only traces of itself. The aroma itself was lightly smoked almost, full of roasted malts and a touch of caramel. The flavor was light bodied but nicely roasted with a touch of a bittering finish and a flavor full of earthy grain like tones. A nice subtle bread like base was quaintly masked underneath. Overall this was a decent brown ale. It was nothing spectacular, but I do not think it was designed to be, but rather it was a very nice interpretation of the style. I could see myself drinking this on a session basis as it was very nice and very full of flavor without being too heavy or filling. A quality sessionable brown ale is what it should be and it definitely succeeds at that."
"Ellie's Brown Ale is good all around, a solid and tasty, if unspectacular, contribution from Avery. The head was thin but durably frothy atop a medium brown body, nice. The aromas were full of chocolate, with a modicum of coffee and caramel, all of which appeared in the taste. I must add, though, that while I enjoyed the firm malty taste, the flavors didn't deliver as much in taste as they did in smell, to my disappointment. It's a fine, smooth brown ale, just not one that knocked my socks off. Overall, worth picking up and a good, smooth brown. A solid brown ale, but apparently not everything that Avery produces is five stars. Still, Avery has provided a sturdy, smooth brown ale worth the effort. Kudos."
"i would definetly like to get more of this one. Very nice beer. Seems like Avery is right on with a lot of their beers. Never had a bad one from them and i hope i never do. Thank you Avery Brewing!"
"D-This is a very drinkable brown ale. nice rich malty beer with enough of a hop bite to round the whole thing out. Another winner by Avery."
"D - A nice quaffable English brown. The ABV is a tad higher than some might want in a session brown like this, so watch out. Just"
"Pours a light brown color with a foamy head that leaves just a little bit of lacing. Smell is of a nutty malt, roasted notes. Taste is sweet with some caramel malt and sweet cocoa notes dominate. Smooth, almost watery mouthfeeling. This was paired with Seared scallops, lima beans, pomegranate, sweet potato, and jowl. Phenomenal dish!"
"this beer is a pretty good beer overall it just barely misses the mark of being great would probably recommend a few other brown ales over this one"
"D: Extremely drinkable. This is now one of my favorites."
"Dark brown-ruby color, like Coca-Cola. A thick, foamy head, bits of lacing left behind. Pretty nice looking beer. A bit of hops in the smell, notes of caramel and cherry. The taste is mostly grapefruit/citrus hops with a strong malt presence too. Caramel and toffee, little alcohol too. A kind of chocolate flavor mixes in as well. There are bits of cherry in the taste and maybe a bit of orange zest too? This was slightly syrupy feelings with a medium body and a crisp, dry finish. Great taste and very smooth. Surprising little beer right here."
"D-As above, i have been searching for the perfect brown ale, and this is my new favorite by far. Not too heavy, not too light on the palate, i can 't say more. I had come across this beer, due to the fact that there were not DFH india browns at the store, and this was my substitute. this beer is at the top of my brown list from now on."
"Good solid beer, something I would like to brew. If you like brown ales give it a try."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a glass. The beer pours a medium brown, with ruby hues showing through when held to the light. 1/2 inch head that quickly fades to a thin layer, leaving medium rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is of sweet malts creating a nice nutty aroma. The taste is a nice mix of sweet malt up front, a hint of hops in the middle, and finishing with a dry nutty flavor. Medium mouthfeel. Exceptionally drinkable brown ale! IMO this is what a brown ale should taste like. Full delicious flavor and average abv. makes for the ideal session ale!"
"Drinkability: A very balanced brown ale with lots of flavor. I personally like this style in the fall to mix in with all the octoberfests that I drink. This is my first beer from Avery and it has me looking forward to trying more."
"Poured a chocolate brown color wsith a thick tan head that lingered. Very nice roasted caramel malt aroma. Very balanced flavor with a slight chocolate and graininess up front and just a hint of sweetness at the end. One of the best brown ales I have had."
"[Served chiled, in a tumbler.]"
"Good flavors I guess, but nothing out of the ordinary to my palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and good for style. I can think of many beers similar in style I'd choose over this--am I missing something? Overall, not a special beer, especially not for $10 a 6-pack? For a dark brown, I can't imagine many people choosing this over DFH Indian Brown Ale--a much more intense, unique, enjoyable beer. I have to say this was overrated, and a disapointment."
"This beer works well with beef and game, works well throughout the year. This beer is as yummy as a $10 donut, yummm!!"
"Beef Notes: Maybe I'm boring but I like my browns a bit a more tame than this. That being said, I still enjoyed it and appreciate attempts to push the boundaries."
"It all adds up to a drinkable, refreshing brown ale that is quite nice in all compartments. Its good taste and refreshing quality make for a sessionable brown ale. Another solid brew from Avery, and one I will gladly revisit some other time."
"This offering by Avery pours a nice, dark brown. A thin off-white head formed, but dissolved almost immediately. The aroma is a little on the lighter side, with sweet dark malts and dark chocolate present. I found the flavor to be quite nice: it tasted of caramel and chocolate, with some dark maltiness and nuts as well. My only complaint is there was a definite metallic edge to the flavor, and that stunted the smoothness that I prefer some from brown ales. The texture was good, but a little too much carbonation for my taste. All in all, it's quite good, but there are some I may prefer. I would choose it over some other similar browns."
"I was disappointed by this one overall. The aroma is very weak and fades in and out, the taste has some promise but is bland overall and it's just not something that I'd go back to. A surprising thumbs down."
"Good looking in the glass. Nice dark amber brown that tries not to let the light through. I got two fingers of head (aggresive pourer) that was nice and fluffy pale hay colored. Smell was sweet with caramel and roaste roasted malts. Mouthfeel had a real tingle to the tongue that grew less as the beer warmed. Taste ok and sweet rounded with malt, unsweatened chocolate, and a slight floral taste."
"D - Another great brew from Avery. Nice sweet Brown Ale."
"Clear, reddish-brown with a thick, tan, foamy head. Lacing is also thick, clumping to the side of the glass. Carbonation appears vigorous and head settles very slowly. Smell is fairly bland without much character. Aroma is of mild malt with a soapy smell that I typically associate with a pils. Taste is good and malty with a faint hint of bitterness; typical for the style. Mouthfeel is warming with a bite owing to the carbonation. However, this effect flattens out after a few minutes and the beer becomes more mellow. Very easy to drink with a flavor that improves as the beer is consumed. I thought this was an average brew at first, but it actually grew on me."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown color with a nice off-white/light tan head that has really nice retention/lacing qualities. The aroma is slightly toasted malt, a hint of chocolate and charcoal. The taste is delightfully malty with a hint of bittersweet chocolate and a really nice finish provided by the hops. Overall, this is a really nice Brown that I thoroughly enjoyed. Recommended."
"Smooth, but a bit thin. might do better with a little less alcohol."
"Aroma is an attractive red-brown with copius amounts of loose cumulus-looking head. Aroma is a nice sweet caramel-ness. Flavor is as I mentioned above. Mouthfeel is unremarkable. All-in-all quite solid and highly recommended."
"Pours a dark lacquered cherrywood with a khaki head that makes lacing that appears to have faces in it. Smell is of light berries with sugar, cocoa powder, and a touch of roast. Flavor is rather fruity with some nuts and chocolate mixed in. Finishes dry with a roasty lingering. Oddly, I've been finding in the finish, what tastes like wet dog smells. Weird, but not too strong or off-putting. Mouthfeel sits between light and moderate. Carbonation is adequate. Decent enough brown all-around."
"Poured into my pint glass a dark brown with mahogany highlights and about an inch of tan head, which dissipated to a solid ring with a light lace in the center of the beer. Excellent retention all the way down, leaving rings and lace on the glass. I don't think the nose is all that, despite Todd's rave. I get molasses, toasted and roasted malts, and that's about it. The flavors, though, are wonderful. Definately chocolate biscuits up front, roasted malts throughout, slight hops for balance, and a rasiny finish. I think it's a distinct and very flavorful brew. A creamy mouthfeel to boot makes this a great session brown ale, in my opinion."
"pours dark brown with a light tan large head and very good lacing from top to finish. nutty, caramel, dark chocolate smell. lots of roasted malt with chocolate on the slightly bitter side very smooth on the palate good carbonation and easy drinkability. but i was expecting a little bit more from this beer."
"This brown ale pours a very deep ruby-brown into my pint glass. A nice ruby glow when held to the light, as well as a nice frothy off-white head with nice lacing and retention. The aroma is chocolaty, a little bit of roast, a little nutty, and some caramel sweetness. The flavor is a lot like the aroma. There is a light roasted character as well as elements of smokiness and chocolate. The hop bitterness is low, but combined with a bit of bitterness from roasted grains, the impression compliments the grain bill perfectly. The carbonation is moderate and mouthfeel/body is medium. Overall this is an enjoyable brown ale. I would recommend a try."
"Pours with a huge head, I actually had to wait for it to settle before I could finish the bottle. The head settles to a thin layer and leaves a surprisingly small amount of lace. The nose is a little light, but the taste is very nice. It comes across as a creamy, slightly bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel is just right, not thick tasting but not watery. This is an excellent brown ale. For what it is worth, this is one of my wife's favorites."
"drinkability: I don't excited over english brown ale's but this american counterpart version shows very well. This brown ale being more roasted malt driven with a hint of dark fruit would be a backyard bbq. favorite!"
"it pours very dark, with a hint of a copper color. the head is also a tan color and is nice and foamy. I could not pick up a lot of aroma but this could just be me. There is a prominent roasted taste. This is the overwhelming sense you get from the beer. It has a solid mf maybe medium body. i would say its worth a try but isnt a cant miss brew."
"Pours a clear, dark brown with lots of head and medium carbonation. Some initial lacing that does not last. Faint scent of roasted malt, but forgive me for my nose is a wee bit stuffy! Taste is not particularly full as it goes down, and only a faint malty aftertaste remains. I'm finding nothing particularly interesting about this one."
"If you're looking for a sweet brown ale with depth and character, this is a great pick. The ""English"" character really comes out, too. A good brown ale."
"Cheers!"
"Cheers!"
"Pretty good. Subtle undertones make it decently complex. Nice chocolate notes play with the sweet notes."
"Pours a deep ruby-brown, almost mahagony color, with a fat 1.5 finger head on top. The head settles down after a bit and leaves a decent amount of lace on the sides of the glass. Held up to the light it's a pretty beer. The smell here is nothing special in my opinion. Faint malt and chocolate aromas permeate, but nothing jumps out and grabs you. The taste is nutty. A bit too carbonated here, but it does settle down a bit and mellow out. Notes of chocolate, coffee, and black cherry exist as well. Nice coffee bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is solid enough. Overall, it's a pleasant beer. A worthy session beer for sure. Pairs well with Beauxfort cheese."
"A decent Brown Ale most memorable for its appearance than anything else. Not an ale I'd try again, but not an offensive offering either."
"Dark cola brown with cocoa brown edges. Lofty, stubborn (won't dissipate!), khaki brown head. Nose of sweetish, charred fruits, multi-grain toast, licorice, molasses, and spicy hops. Nice. Semi-sweet chocolate flavors up front with light roasted notes. Nutty, dark fruits and molasses follow. Finish is dark chocolate bitter and mildly citrus hops. Pretty dern good! Medium-bodied, with a dry, minerally feel. A good brown to have around."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating system into a pint glass. The color was a nice and clear dark mahogany. The head was a couple fingers and had a light beige tone to it. It settled into a constant thin foam that left some lacing throughout. The aroma was of gently roasted malts with a hint of chocolate. Not a strong smell but very pleasing for the style. The mouthfeel was nice and solid and not watery like others in the style. The taste was really good with a good balance of the roasted malts. Overall, I really enjoy this beer and find myself getting a 6ixer every few months. It's not a complex beer and doesn't stretch any of the 5 categories above but just really hits the spot. For me, it's the textbook rating of 4 and will always have a home in my fridge. (4, HR, T, Y)"
"Poured from bottle into tumble at 45 degrees. Had to let warm up a little before really tasting. This beer was kinda Coke a Cola colored with a tan lumpy head. Toffee smell oozing out of the head with a sighly sweet smell. Taste was sweet of sorghum but not so that it screwed up the beer. I thought this was a delicios brew and will certainly buy again."
"Ellie's Brown Ale has dark red and chocolate reflections underneath it's quickly dissipating head. It has a mildly chocolate scent to go along with it's color. It has a medium body with a slight aftertaste. That taste is composed of mainly chocolate, but not so much as to overpower the beer. A very balanced and drinkable beer."
"Totally drinkable, semi-creamy mouthfeel. I feel heathenish and unworthy of beer advocacy for heaping such praise on a brown ale but I love this beer! Maybe Im in a f_cking weird mood, but I have to say this beer rules."
"Pours a beautiful dark nut brown color with a medium brown head. The smell is dry and roasty with a slight burnt caraway note. The taste is nice balanced malt and hops up front, followed by chocolate and then a late hop astringency. Dry, creamy and balanced in the mouth, this a pleasure to drink and a nice session beer. One of the nicer brown ales out there."
"D: A very nice well balanced American brown ale that is quite drinkable. This beer recenty won best brown ale in the US Beer Tasting Championship's Rockies/Southwest Divison; it is well deserved."
"Overall- A nice tasting Brown here! I can't believe I haven't had this 1 yet. Quite tasty!!"
"Overall, I think this is a very solid American brown ale. Thanks to LB for the hook-up."
"I liked this one, I would drink it again."
"This ale poured a clear, deep chestnut color with tan foam that settled to a film. The smell was malty and yeasty with a touch of caramel. The taste was malty with a background assertive hoppiness. There was a light caramel malt flavor, and a touch of yeast as well. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium-full body and moderate carbonation. Nicely hoppy. This was a very drinkable and enjoyable brown ale."
"For a brown ale, this is extremely chocolaty and sweet.. I can see people who have never tried a micro or real beer enjoying this. This is a fairly sweet ale, and may not appeal to people who don't like that kind of brew, but I know I certainly do. Brown ales are one of my favorite styles, and it's easy enough to make a mediocre one -- which Avery has decidedly not done. This is a great beer, and probably my new favorite brown ale. Another win for Avery."
"Pours a clear cranberry brown with thick frothing head on top leaving behind some patchy lace. Rich, malty aroma: nuts, caramel, and vanilla along with floral-like hops. Full toasted malty sweetness on the palate...nutty chocolate. Hops show up in the second half of the flavor but the malts run the show. Medium and slick in the mouth, drying in the finish. Good brown ale."
"Drinkability: An easy beer to drink in fall weather. I will look to try some more avery beers."
"D - Wow. Not holding back with flavor. It's very exciting with the abundance of flavors the roasted barley brings forth. Not too chewy, so it goes down smoother than you would think when first looking at it. I need to get more of this!"
"A nicely concocted English brown ale. Has all the right ingredients and is certainly one of the more appealing brown ales I've had."
"Pours a very dark brown, close to black, that only gives up amber brown highlights when held to direct light. The head is delicate and just off-white, sticks around well. Aromas are principally grainy, very toasty and showing little fruit. On the palate, very bready first off (reminds me of the breadsticks you used to get at faux-high end restaurants), then a bit of English ale sourness before finishing dry. Carbonation is mouth-filling and prickly throughout, and bitterness is substantial for the style, provoking lots of activity on the sides of the tongue. Overall, a very satisfying, very sessionable brown ale. Well done."
"D - This is by far the least English Brown-like English Brown I have had to date. Granted, that isn't an awful thing in this case. This beer has a lot more flavor than most brown ales while still remaining a delightfully quaffable brew. Brown ales should never be screaming, but this one could actually be heard."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a giant tan foamy head. The lacing is great and the head lasts forever. This is a very good looking beer. The smell is a little light,but you could pick out roasted malt,coffee, and I swear some cinnamon. The taste is roasted malt,coffee, some spices,cinnamon?, and hops. This is almost porter like. The m/f is medium creamy and the flavors mix very well. A damn good beer that could be a session beer. Cheers."
"Pours brown with red highlights, creamy light tan head with lots of lacing on the glass. Great head retention. Aroma is hops. Flavor is roasted malts and hop bitterness, maybe some citrus flavor in the finish? Medium bodied. This is a good beer, hops seem a little prominant for a brown ale, but it is good."
"D: Damn drinkable brown--not suprised in the least. Keep em' coming Avery. Definatley worth a shot if you can pick it up."
"A good malt flavor with good background of chocolate and citrus. Some nuttyness is present at the end but there is very little aftertaste to this brew. Not bad on carbonation, just right. This is a good quality, easy drinking beer for anyone."
"One of the best brown ales I've tried."
"Not sure about this one. I was expecting something a little better. It presented itself well but didn't come through. Maybe I'll try this one another time some day to see if it is any different."
"Pours a dark brown color, some carbonation, tiny head, some lacing afterwards. The scents are of sweet malts, and caramel. The taste is pretty much of malts, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad of a brew, but I doubt if I will buy it again. Would recommend thought YMMV."
"A very nice mellow brown ale. Light chocolate malts with a slight dry, bitter edge. A touch nutty and smells quite nice. A definate session beer. I wish I could just get growler fills of this. Despite the 5.8%, this beer has a delicate flavor unlike many of the Avery's I've tried."
"Got this one on tap at Dewey's Pizza today. Nice brown color with tan head... a brown ale indeed. Creamy with lacing all the way down to the bottom of the pint glass. This beer has a nice malt/hop balance with great mouthfeel and a slightly dry finish. The citrus decided to come out also. I liked this one. It had some real APA characteristics. Nothing about it jumped out at me but definitely a quality beer worth anyone's time. Four's across the board."
"Crystal-clear chestnut with a big, pock-marked khaki head. Doughy hazelnut and biscuit aromas mostly, with a bit of leafy hop scent. Full-flavored biscuity malt taste at first with a leafy-soapy ""English"" hop flavor and slightly sour vinous character midway; rounding toward home I get a nutty sweetness with a roasty mocha-espresso finish. Effervescent, spicy mouthfeel, medium-to-light body. Like all well-made browns, Ellie's got a sure-fire sessioner here. Will definitely buy again now that Avery beers are commonly available here in WNY."
"I like the flavors and the balance of this drink. Not sure why the carbonation was such an issue, but it was."
"Pours a nice mahogany color with very impressive lacing. A nice malty, chocolate nose. Very crystal malt. The taste doesn't quite do it for me. Malty, mildly sweet, with light mineral and herbal hop notes. Just not enough oomph for me, but I guess that falls well within the style, a style I've never really loved. This beer has a substantial but unobtrusive carbonation, but it has an unfortunate lack of body. Maybe better for sessioning, but I like mine more hearty."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable."
"Note: the first time I had this beer I wasn't that impressed. This is probably my 3rd or 4th sampling of it, and tonight when I sat down to it my expectations were pretty low based on my recollection. I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this beer as much as I did."
"Overall, an average dry nutty brown ale."
"The handsome dog on the label aside, this is the middle class man's choco-coffee stout (of which I am the lower dregs). As opposed to say a New Holland's Poet or King's Pontiac Porter this is a smidge watered-down as is their intention according to their label rhetoric. I approve of this but only wish that the taste was more in the body than in the aftertaste. It comes across as a medium Lite Dark as opposed to the black tartar morass that I am and crave more of. A mysterious shadow whom intrigues moreso than a dark figure who leads you away to unknown places."
"Not terribly impressed with this beer. I was looking for a full, rich, and moderately textured beer. But Ellie's shows up a little weak, leaving behind a big grain flavor that I found distracting. Initially, the aromas and flavors are promising; beginning with a solid, but medium malt, nutty, and lightly chocolatey character. Charred grains quicly shows up with a lighly burnt, astringency that was unexpected. From there the beer looses its flavor intensity and reveals a grain flavor and texture. Close to becomming something special, but not there yet."
"A surprisingly good nut brown. Unfortunately this style seems to be plauged by mediocrity. This beer is exciting and interesting."
"Easy to drink, nice session brown, with a bit more complexity than the normal beer of this style."
"Generally unimpressive and not my favorite for the style as there was a little too much sooty smoke to it. Sadly, it gets a lot better when you gulp it. Dont be afraid to pass on this one."
"Nice nutty quality, but it also possesses a sense of soapiness that make it somewhat unpleasant."
"This isn't one of my favorite styles but within the style this has very good flavor, maybe because it is does not conform to the standard. The bittersweet finish doesn't encourage me to grab another though, so I'll probably pass by this one next time."
"Overall another good beer by the Avery crew!"
"Dnot a bad brown ale, very mild and drinkablemight be a good transition beer."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer isnt a bad beer drink. The beer is slightly thinner than I prefer, but I still wouldnt turn my nose up at this beer."
"Generous, pancake-batter head on this one. The color of a cherry coke, with lots of bubbles tracking up the inside of my mug. Smell is striking--yeasty and nutty notes hit my nose and, as is not unusual, start me salivating. Pavlov was my master. It's fizzy and medium bodied, and has a rather tart flavor, with a bit of metallic edge to it. Definite roasted nuts too, though. The finish is a bit short and abrupt, but that blast of tart, roasted flavor is really very tasty."
"I was hoping for something better since this was going to be a mild, easy drinking beer. Unfortunately, this malty mixyure has the consistantly dull feature of Avery brews... a sticky malt flavor that lingers unpleasently on my pallate. Some don't mind it I don't like it."
"Bottom line: Avery Ellie's is a brew that I can easily recommend as it's one of best of its style that I've tasted to date."
"Light to medium body, with low carbonation. Everything is medled together nicely, no one flavor overpowers another. One of the better brown ales...good session beer."
"Pours a rusty dark garnet with a finger of rocky oatmeal-tinged head. Nose is surprisingly lively for an English brown, notes of musty, toasted malt, winter spice and milky caramel. Taste starts off like a subtle winter warmer - spicy and malty, rounded out with a cocoa finish. Mouthfeel is thin, lending to its drinkability. A richly flavored, yet lightly bodied brown. A true sessioner here."
"This brew pours a clear dark brown almost black color. The head is two fingers in height, fluffy, and very light tan in color. The aroma is roasted and burnt malt, chocolate, and cream. Very nice for a brown ale. The tastes has both porter and brown ale qualities. Burnt malt and chocolate come across first followed by a nice mild caramel and cream finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a very good and sessionable brown ale. I certainly see myself drinking this quite often as it is the best brown ale available in my area."
"Mouth feel is medium to full bodied, but the carbonation level is a little low."
"Poured a deep reddish brown color with massive tannish head. Nice lacing as the head feel to a thin coating. Smell is roasted malt combined with a nice dark fruitiness. Taste is a sweet fruitish malt with some caramel background. Finish presents a bit of hop and complimets the malt perfectly. A nice well-done beer."
"Drinkability: easy drinking and a nice brown ale. Avery beers push the limits, and it was nice to get a brown ale that was as lively as this."
"Ruby. Mild nose with a touch of earth and a hint of rhubarb, sweet malts, nuts, caramel and coffee beans. Grainy malt feel throughout. Sweet, dry malts possessing notes of nuts, vanilla and spicy hops. Lingering finish. I have had several brown ales and still don't understand why the style exists."
"Only drawback is the smell, there isn't any. But..the taste is terrific, a quality brown ale, rivaling Dogfishead's Indian Brown Ale. Roasty malts, slight hops, nice head retention, extreme drinkability. This is what NewCastle is supposed to be! A terrific effort by Avery!"
"Overall impression: As I would expect from Avery, a bit more hops than an average brown. Still very drinkable - nice roasted flavors would do well with some BBQ."
"Very drinkable brew. One of the better brown ales I've had."
"Pours fairly dark, but not quite opaque, with a kinda weak off white head. The smell is slighly nutty with heavy roasted malts and a very slight hop sting. The flavor is very roasted and malty, slighly sweet, and has a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little bit slick and sticky, but almost over-compensated with carbonation. Overall this beer is above average."
"Very solid as both a session beer and a one-at-a-time deal. I'm very glad my local shop just started carrying this."
"Smooth and fairly drinkable but nothing that stands out in that category."
"Overall: I was extremely impressed. This beer in itself is an excellent example of why it's so fun to try as many different brews as you can. Some are average, some good, some awful. But every so often you find one like this that totally blows you away. I highly recommend this one to anyone, whether or not you like brown ales."
"Overall: I like this brown a lot. For its style this is an exemplary beer."
"The best Avery beer I have had yet. Everything else was a disapointment but this one exceeded my resigned expectations. A very dark brown slithered out of the bottle; yeilding a tan-white head and laced with eat sip. The smell was much more intense than I was enticipating; ful of nutty and sweet malt reverbs and even a little citrus hop blosoms. A full taste of nutty, biscuit flavors, and a bitterness in the end to add a little balance. Good mouthfeel and great carbonation, I would drink this again anytime."
"Nice and easy drinking, but like almost every other brown ale I have ever had nothing really jumps out at ya. Sweet malt profile is enjoyable and it is better than many browns but it is still missing enough roastiness to be outstanding. Though it does deliver that comforting and safe nuttiness."
"A very solid and sessionable/drinkable brown ale. Another Avery keeper. On a style choice note: this seemed much more like an American Brown then an English Brown. But what the hell do I care, its damn good either way you put it."
"A personal note--in general, browns are one of my least favorite styles, just simply because I find them to be less dynamic than a number of other beer types. Ellie's is, IMO, on par with Bell's Best Brown as one of the best examples of this style I've seen on the US market."
"Watch out for the almost 6% if you drink more than a couple."
"Amber brown color with a tan head. Nice lacing. Steady stream of bubbles make for a lively appearance. Smell is sweet malt. I caught the faintest hint of piney hops at first sniff but it's covered by the malt sweetness almost immediately. No nuttiness noted at all. Sweet taste with almost no bitterness. Mostly caramel malts. Would maybe expect some nut flavors but really just a basic malt dominated beer. A nice drinkable beer that is worth a try. If avery was local i could see enjoying their beers on a regualar basis."
"Final Thought: It's different than most, but not all that great."
"D- The depth of grain was not really there. Very soft smooth brown ale."
"A solid amber beer."
"The color is dark brown with a bit of ruby glow. A creamy head is light brown and average-sized. The aroma is awesome. Full-on malt smell, toasty with a bit of chocolate and some nuttiness. The taste is more of the same: lots of great malt flavors. Biscuity chocolate malt flavor is strong and enhanced by an underlying toasty flavor. Nuttiness pops in and out. A dry roasty flavor joins the party towards the finish. Hops are soley for balance here, with sweetness reigning supreme. This is easily one of the best American browns I've sampled, highly recommended."
"Pours a deep brown color, mildly hazy with a thick fluffy head that shows great retention, and a n ice lace as it finally recedes. Mild toffee in the nose, just the barest hint of citrus orange. Oddly, I find a bit of sherry in the finish. Mild caramel flavor with a light citrus bitterness. This had an interesting nose, but the flavor is not nearly as attractive. The mouth feel is just a little thin, OK drinkability,"
"Pound for pound, this might be Avery's best."
"Ellie's poured a great brown color, not too dark but certainly a brown ale. The head was off-white and hung on throughout the entire glass. The smell was that of an English brown ale, very malty but well balanced with hop bitterness. The roasted and chocolate undertones were very enjoyable and the aftertaste was reminiscent of a great cup of coffee. Not too overpowering but definitely enjoyable; the medium bodied brown ale went down smooth and was very satisfying."
"Easy and smooth to drink. A nice brown ale."
"A thousand ""thank yous"" to George and Tom at Andy's Corner in Bogota for giving me the opportunity to sample this fresh."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a dark amber color with an inch of light brown foam. The aroma is mainly malty, but some hops also come through. The tasty starts out sweet and malty. Then a little bitter, roasted malt comes in, along with some nut flavor. The sweetness is also balanced by some spicy hops. The hops are not weak, but still restrained for an Avery beer. This beer has beautiful balance. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Good brown ale."
"Orange-tinged dark brown appearance, transparent. Decent tan head of over 1/4 of an inch in height and with better-than-average staying power. Widely spaced dripping laces, incomplete rings. Fruity aroma, cherry, some nuts, more hops than some. Mouthfeel is lighter, carbonation weighs in about the same to start. Some small amounts of caramel, nice bit of walnut, a hint of berries, and subdued hops that still stick out slightly at the back end. Seems to go away too much at the close, almost like a flat root beer, probably the biggest flaw for me. Decent beer, good drinkability, one I can see drinking out of a bottle at a party."
"D: Smooth mouthfeel, light to medium body. Way more interesting than Newcastle without being a hopmonster."
"Had on tap at 'bones last night. Brown Ales normally don't make me turn my head, but I thought: I've heard good things about this one, so decided to have one. Glad I did, this brew turned out to be pretty satisfying. Cola colored, no head when served. Low but rich malt in the aroma. Medium + bodied. There's some malt sweetness which is kept well in check. Flavor is nicely well rounded with some earthy notes a well. Don't know if I would make this a session, but it was definitely a nice solid brew."
"The beer is amazingly smooth and very easy to drink. A great session beer!"
" Aroma is nutty It has a sweet crystal malt scent with a toastey/roasted finish. The medium/heavier body and dextrinous mouthfeel expands to fill the mouth. The taste is sweet and creamy with a dark malt flavor and reserved amount of high Lovabond crystal malts followed by a dry roasted finish."
"reddish brown and clear. Tan froth looks like a linen shirt that slowly unravels. Smells of leather, frozen berry juice concentrate, and toast. Tastes like toast and raspberry jam. Great Quaff!! I mean, come on it's not complex, but it's really delicious. Sounds like a quality brown ale."
"Good mouthfeel, good carbonation level. Very drinkable, but I wouldn't think of this as session beer necessarily. It doesn't make a good summertime quaffer, but I could easily see myself grabbing a sixer or two as the calendar swings towards fall and early winter. I could just as easily reach for this as a good porter or stout. As brown ales go, it was quite good."
"Good mouthfeel. Medium body with medium carbonation. Consumes the palate through the whole sip. I think this is a good beer and highly recommend it."
"Rich dark brown colored body, nice creamy head, much darker than most BA's. Lots of sweet milk chocolate in the nose, very frosting-like. Taste has a lot of chocolate malt in it, although still very smooth, and none too sweet. Hops are present, and very good for the style. A very nice example for the style, good drinkability."
"Nice mouthfeel that benifets from the malt and has minimal tingle from the carbonation. If I'm in the mood for sessioning with a roasty beer that isn't as full as a porter or stout, this is what I would reach for."
"Opinion: I really like this beer, and think that it is most drinkable. It is not for the faint of palate, as this beer is really aggressive on many aspects. The fact that all of the flavors are turned up, gives this beer an unusually pleasing balance for a brown ale. It is not meant to be a ""crowd pleaser", but one that will satisfy the palate that thinks it has seen it all."
"The flavor delivers some yeasty fruitiness and chocolate upfront; warms to become more caramelish; and then delivers a roasty punch. Hops appear at the swallow, and it finishes dry with a lingering bitterness and some dark malt acidity."
"Bottle obtained from Total Beverage (Colorado) and consumed the next evening in July 2005. Pours a thick one-finger tan head over a clear dark brown/ruby red liquid. Smells chocolate and toffee with a gentle floral hop. Tastes nutty, chocolate, toffee, and a volatile hop flavor (tastes cottony and sorta like Fuggles and sorta like First Gold). The hops are not tremendously bitter, but they have a potent grassy co-humulone character that contrasts with the sweet of the chocolate nicely. This beer is not tremendously complex, but the flavors that are present are well-balanced and cooperate well. Medium to med-light body with moderate carbonation. There's still a thin layer of head over the liquid and the lacing on the inside of the glass is stupendous."
"Appearance is, indeed, brown, with an impressive beige head that melts down to a sticky lace. Aroma is very complex and pleasant. There are notes of flowers, crackers, malt, brown sugar, and even some hops. Initial taste is a loamy sweetish ale with malt and raisins, followed by a nicely dry aftertaste. Excellent."
"Thanks go out to mportsch for allowing me to try this great beer."
"Taste is dry but full malty with good bitterness in the back. Probably from both hops and darkmalt. Quiet a good brew but could have had some more body. Also missed in mouthfeel but further more then ok with good carbonisation and no hanging taste. Good brew IMO that was a pleasure to drink."
"Beautiful deep auburn color with a full head. Wonderful biscuit and bready aroma from the generous crystal malts. The hop aroma is slight and allows the malt character to shine. This beer is delicious and feels wonderful on the tongue. Full body flavor, full of malt flavor and a hint of spicy hop flavor. Slight aftertaste showing bitterness from both the hops and the remaining dextrins. The carbonation is perfect at about a medium level. This is a great beer to pair with a meal, even apple pie. I love this beer, its everything great about brown ale."
"Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: A nice brown ale that is refreshingly tasty"
"This was a decent beer but I've had much better from Avery. It's a little thin for a brown ale in my opinion, and not quite tasty enough. Being and English style I suppose it's supposed to be a little mild though, but I think I was expecting a bit more. A decent murky brown color, little head. Smell is a tad hoppy for a brown ale and has hints of chocolate, roasted malts, but nothing really unusual or particularly intriguing. Taste is much the same, light and hoppy, and not as malty and roasty as your traditional brown ale. Almost like a simple APA with some toasted malt thrown in, not really a brown ale. Like I said, the mouthfeel was a little thin, which I usually like but in this beer something was lacking. Drinkable beer though. Not bad, don't get me wrong, but I was expecting a bit more. Try their other stuff first..."
"Pours with small thin head with little to no retention. Has an elegant ruby red color. Smells of mocha, cocoa and sweet malts. A bit more bitter than I expected, but a nice smooth creamy lathering mouthfeel nonetheless. This is a very easy drinking brew that I enjoyed very much."
"Plentiful plume of fluffernutter head that subsides to a thin film with white archipelagos. Crystal mahogany hue with some gently ascending carb. Butterscotch goodness with some slight burnt oak crunch on nose. Ahh, nice and complex malt character with some very light hop additions; a complete and not-too-sweet brown."
"Pours a light tan, two-finger head, fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Nice clear, deep amber color. Nose is malty. Starts mellow and sweet, finishes with a touch of hops and there is a very slight bitter aftertaste, nice brown. $1.65 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"This is a tasty ale. In my favorite style, this is one I'd have again."
"Cheers to Chris (clvand0) for sharing this. The dog pictured on the bottle looks just like mine! Anyway, 12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a very deep semi-hazy brown color with one finger of head. Not much lacing. The smell is very malty, with sweet caramel and a nice bit of nuttiness. The taste has lots of caramel flavor as well, and a hint of toffee. Nutty and hoppy flavors on the finish. The body is nice and thick, yet smooth. The drinkability is nice as well. A solid brown ale."
"Thanks to clvand0 for this beer. It pours a nice rubied brown color with a finger of head that falls to ring hte beer. The nose is nice and roasty. That's about it. The flavor is not bad. Very nice roasted tones that moves towards nutty on the finish. The feel is just at moderate. Avery is really keeping me happy here. This is a nice solid brown ale."
"Brown is pretty low on my style list - this one scores very high for the style in my rating scheme."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head above the reddish brown brew. Head lfades, but holds with a layer of foam, with lacing minimal to average. Aroma is deeply of grains, almost what I hope for in a brown. Taste is upfront a bag of grains, and comes with a slight hoppiness at the end. A bit one-sided, but I like the grains in my browns, so we'll stick with it. Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are good. Not a bad brown."
"I didn't expect this to be such a good beer, but it has pleasently surprised me. If you see this, and like darker beers, please give this a try!"
"Clear, ruby-brown in hue with a slight tawny influence, it is a lovely color, very shiny. It is too bad there isnt any noticeable animation to liven up the liquid or replenish the head. The foam reached about a half finger in height, the beige bubbles collapsed quickly to a soapy cap. Subsequent lacing was spotty and unorganized; it looks respectable in my glass. The nose is malty with pleasant chocolate undertones, sweet buttery notes. Potency is modest, there is good malty depth, I wish there was some hops in the nose. I couldnt find any. The nose is too fatty for me; I like my Brown Ales to be sharper. The nose is decent; it is inviting, just not noteworthy. It makes me want to take a sip; Im just not rushed. I love Brown Ales and this one is good. The palate is malty with depth that fits the style; chocolate malts, very weak hints of coffee beans, flashes of toasted bread. The sweetness plays much nicer than the nose indicated. Flashes of heat are oddly enjoyable if not misplaced; it acts nicely towards some nuttiness. Noticeable spicy hops find a home near the end, only to be interrupted by a dry, chalky cocoa powder-like taste. Modest bitterness. The finish could be stronger, more organized. I dont want to say this beer falls apart because it doesnt; it just fades a bit. Dry, astringent aftertaste. Overall the palate is good, it is tasty enough for me to consider drinking this again. Ive had better, so what it is good at the moment. Around medium in body, the carbonation is moderately low but workable and the mouthfeel is slick. Id drink this again with cheese and crackers. This is a decent Brown Ale, drinkable but not groundbreaking. Still no complaints from this simplistic offering from Avery, my lone bottle was purchased in Brookfield, WI. Try one."
"Overall though this is a very tasty brew. It is quite smooth and creamy with just a bit of astringency in the finish. If the astringency was taken care of this would be a tasty beer, as it is though it is very good, and one which I will be happy to have any time."
"Dirty copper color with a thin off-white head that sinks quickly to fine cap with lace rising up the edges of the glass. Light shows through as amber highlights. Smell is more roasted malt than expected, some raisin and fig, and some cocoa. Seems more like a dark ale just from the aroma. Flavor is also less sweet than expected for a brown ale, more caramel and toasted malt. Also some fig, a bit of molasses, and a hint of bitter chocolate. Hope profile is low, very understated. Very full and smooth mouthfeel, which I'm noticing consistenly from the Avery beers. Not sure if I would consider this typical of the English brown ale style, but it's very tasty. Thanks to Brent."
"A deep red pour from the tap, with a full inch tan head that laced decently, if not great. The smell is nothing to note. It smells like beer. Slightly malty, no hop aroma. The malts dominate the taste. Chocolate comes to the front, and stays the entire way through. Smooth, but with the acidness that you expect from a brown ale. The chocolate coats the tongue, and you relly taste this at the back of you mouth, taking away from the beer."
"Ellie's Brown Ale doesn't win 'Best of Show', but it is a faithful companion that deserves respect and admiration. Good dog!"
"I have had this a couple of times, last taste seemed much better...I think I would still try it again."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet crystal malt scent with a toastey/roasted finish. The taste is good. It has a sweet and creamy dark malt flavor that boasts of crystal malts and a dry roasted finish. It goes down smooth and finishes creamy, yet dry. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking brown ale. It has good flavor and awesome mouthfeel; a fine sessions ale."
"12 ounce bottle, pours a healthy dark mahogony brown, slightly off white head settling into a tiny bubble film and leaving respectable lacing. Malty nose, medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Notes of sweet, smooth malt, nutty. caramel, honey. A slight bitterness picked up late. Classy brown ale, Avery knows what they are doing and it shows with this fine take on the style. Subtle, refined and suprisingly complex. As with all the Avery products, worth seeking out and enjoying"
"Again, I admit that I wasn't looking too forward to this one as another brown ale, but this is surprisingly good. A lot more flavor than the average brown ale, and this is one I'd have again."
"Whitish-beigeish headish. Dark, dark brown beer is garnet against the light. I get sweet, burnt chocolate in the nose and a milk chocolate inhale. Tangy toffee and chocolate up front. It then sours a little and thick, buttery chocolate emerges. A hoppy bitter finish sports roasted nuts. It's tangy. A good, intense, chocolatey, hoppy brown."
"I could kick back one after another of these. After my first impression, I thought, ""I'll have to buy a 6-er of this the next time."" Good girl, Ellie. Good girl!"
"Pours a deep brown with some reddish tint thru out not much head though,aroma is of cocoa powder and roasted nuts,pretty appetizing.Nice flavors melding together here,some unsweetend chocolate some raw nut/earthy flavor really dominates the finish and aftertaste.Sweet but not cloying an easy drinker,a well made brown ale here."
"Pours out a solid brown color... shows some reddish highlights when held up to light. A delightful (although slightly too thin) head graced the glass, then slowly disappared leaving lots of lacing. Smells faintly of sweet malts. The taste is quite good. Sweet malty flavor balanced by some bittering hops that come in more towards the end. Finishes dry with some lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is just a little thinner than I would like for such a dark beer, but definitely not unpleasant. This is a highly drinkable beer that I would gladly have again and again. Not something that is going to hit my ""A" list, but definitely a worthy beer for taste tests and when the mood strikes!"
"Beer is good. Happy big brown beering."
"Poured a very clear brownish amber color and has a just a tint of orange. A small, but creamy tan head of foam topped this beer off. The aroma has a sweet and buttery nuttiness about it with hints of chocolate and licorice. Very alluring and soft. The taste is mildly roasty and full of all sorts of rich and nutty flavors. Good malt body at its core with semi-sweet chocolates and roasted chestnuts floating around. An easy drinking and fine brown ale that ends with a perfect finish. Very nice."
"this beer was but a B- experience for me. Now it seemed to be a fair representation of its style, which is not a style that I am overly fond of, but I found the beer lacking in both mouthfeel and taste. the beer seemed thin with not much foam or glass lacing. taste of burned malt very strong and I felt also a bit overhwhelming and not subtle enough for my taste. Would be a fine session beer, but again this style is generally not to my preference. thought that color and clarity were both quite good."
"12oz Bottle No Date. Poured a clear brown with a thick and fluffy head that seems to have legs. Has a doughy malt aroma with notes of caramel, nuts, brown sugar and a subtle hop pesence. Medium bodied and smooth with light carbonation and a dry finish. Flavor is of chocolate malt, and a light hopping with notes of vanilla and brown sugar. Overall a good brew from a great brewery."
"Nice dark brown with a hint of red with a modest but resilient head. The smell is very malty, sweet and roasted. Nothing spectacular, but everything you would expect and not be disappointed by. The taste is similarly malty, slightly smoky with a bit of chocolate flavor but not overly sweet, good brown ale stuff. The nice medium body and good level of carbonation compliment each other nicely and make this a very drinkable brown. Ellie's brown ale is a very solid brown ale and well worth getting if you are a fan of brown ales."
"Ellie's Brown poured a dark brown with deep red highlights. It had a light brown head that quickly went to a thin skim that left some nice lacing. Its aroma is of toasted malt and chocolate. It has a nice smoth and creamy mouthfeel. The taste is big on malts (which I like). It starts with nutty, toasted malts and a touch of caramel, and has a subdued bitter finish which balances the beer nicely. Overall, a wonderful brown that is very drinkable. This will definitely become a regular in rotation in my beer fridge."
"The taste is malty, with a nicely balanced hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is surpisingly thick, and the alcohol notes blend in quite well. Didn't taste much that made me think this was a brown ale, but otherwise it was easy to drink."
"Overall Impression: The roasted malt flavor was a bit too heavy and overall just a slight astringency to the beer. An ok brown, but no nuttiness was noted, and just nothing that really sparked my curiosity."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Excellent overall flavor and smooth taste make for great tast."
"Rich brown looking color with a tan head and reddish hues that make this a very pretty beer. The smell is a roasted nutty charachter with an earthy sense. Hops are there but not overally powerful. This is a tasty brown ale with a solid body and very smooth crisp taste. The flavors are of a nutty caramel and finish with a dry roasted note. I was impressed with this beer and would buy it again in a heartbeat."
"I've yet to have a brew from Avery I didn't like, this one I liked the least...eh, but that's me...and thanks aplenty to vitriola for sending it out!"
"This one pours a light brown color with a medium head that doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is somewhat grainy and has some hints of caramel malts. The flavor was very standard but well balanced. Has the standard nutty character, but not too strong. Solid brown ale."
"Light brown color. Very clear. Pours into a straight-sided pint glass with little foam. Roasted grains are evident upon the first sip and detectable in the aroma. Very grainy aroma. Not much body or mouthfeel. Finishes with a bitter combination of dark malts and hops, almost coffee-ish finish. A decent brown ale, but I don't know that I would need to drink it again."
"Pours a dark brown with maroon highlights and copper highlights. Minimal head retention with minimal lace that sticks around. Aroma is light chocolate, slightly lactic and sour. Taste is sweet chocolate with a minimal bitter aftertaste. Not overly complex but very drinkable."
"Medium dark in color with a large tan head that took a bit to settle. This was one nice easy going beer that wasn't too weak or too strong. Good balance of malts upfront and hops in the background. Solid mixture of nutty flavor with some slightly sweet chocolate. The body was a little weak but that was fine for this style and this beer in particular. Nothing great but it sure was nice. This would be a great session brew."
"Pours brown with definte garnet hues. Seems redder than it should be. Creamy off-white head that leaves plenty of lacing along the side of the pint. Pleasant aromas consists of chocolate & caramel malts and roasted nut. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied. Very satisfying flavors of toasted malt, caramel, bittersweet chocolate flow over the palate. Finishes has a lingering nutty dryness to it. It's only detraction seems that the finish seems to flatten out a bit. Something in the initial taste gets lost at the end. Maybe it's the sweetness that fades out or something. Other than that though, Ellie's Brown would make a great session beer."
"Appearance: Now this is a great beer, I can say that after one look, sniff, and taste that this beer is one I would love to have at my reaches whenever I wanted. Pours deep amber brown hue with a nicely formed moccha tan head leaves full collar of lacing great mix of speckled lacing from the side I have been sipping from while the opposite side has a bar about an inch wide of coated bubbles clinging on my pint. Aroma: Chocolate malts are evident a nutty appeal is also present along with a soothing current of mild hopping, but I will say the soft chocolate tones is what sold me on this beer much like some mindless drones can be sold by the dropp eyed lab on the label I assume it's Ellie. Taste: Cap says small brewery - BIG BEERS yep that's about right not a huge west coast hoppy big but very flavorful and fulfilling. Tasty chocolate splashes the palate followed by a very nice dose of bittering hops that blend so well together the toasted malts bring out mild hints of coffee and nuts pretty damn good. Mouthfeel: Medium body solid brew can't complain nothing bad to say very smooth and drinkable brown ale. Drinkability: Wow, what a great brown possibly one of my favorites of all time up there nearly surpassing Brooklyn's Brown that's pretty good."
"Taste starts out dry with a slightly sweet malt caress on the tongue. Quickly followed by a rush of toasted malt, peat, and even mocha flavors that are a welcome addition to a brown ale. The smokey finish is very nice, and the flavor is certainly unique. Well worth the somewhat high cost, and the dog is adorable."
"Quite a bit of personality for a mild brown ale. Nice walnut color. Aroma hints of coffee and brown sugar. The aroma suggests that the beer will be too sweet, but sweetness is actually quite well moderated. Faint coffee flavors, very smooth and drinkable. Quite nicely done for the style."
"-Cute dog, too!"
"Ellies Brown Ale is one of the more English Brown Ales out there, IMO, even with the use of Bullions and Cascades. The clear, deep ruby body is topped by a thin, almost splotchy head of beige, lacing head. The aroma of sweet, chocolate and crystal malts mingle with the coolness of American hops and the Fuggles. Between the chocolate malts and the Fuggles, the medium body is very earthy, after the initial sweetness. Then an almost piney coolness almost mitigates the maltiness. The two opposing flavors linger momentarily in equilibrium, but the earthy maltiness wins out and the beer sours ever so slightly in the finish due to the imbalance and the resulting, left-over sugar. A solid offering, but by Avery standards, this ones a bit weak and uninteresting"
"Medium brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and nutty. A medium bodied brown ale. Malts are very nutty and very sweet. Hops are slightly spicy. Nicely balanced. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"Final note: as this beer warmed to near room temperature it definitely began to taste like a mild porter and the nose strengthened significantly. Very nice indeed."
"This beer pours a beautiful clear brown with deep reddish-orange highlights with a massive fluffy vanilla colored head. The aroma consists of a roasted malt and a slightly earthy grain. Might I add the massive head is hanging in there nicely. The taste is a nice buttery on the nose fading into lightly roasted malts with just the right amount of hops to balance this brew. It has a light to medium body and finishes with a light bitter and slightly sweet end. Very solid beer! Cheers!"
"ABV 5.5% per the website."
"The pour a translucent sanguineous color, the head mastodonic in size, frothy in its texture, and the color a light tan and as it dissipates it leaves behind a glutinous sheet of covering lace. Nose has light floral hints, but the malt wins the day, sweet, clean and fresh a real treat to the senses. Ambrosial start, lots of malt, the top skimpy in feel with the finish having a delightful hop spicy bite, the carbonation moderate and the aftertaste droughty and long lasting. As I sample more of Averys beers I become a bigger fan than the last time, and a must try brewery for the serious beer Geek, or if you just like good beer!"
"Pours a dark brownish color with a thick and foamy tan colored head that fades into a bubbly and sticky lace. Nose is sweet roasted malts, milk chocolate, caramel, and some floral notes. Very smooth and creamy mouth feel. Taste is sweet caramel, earthy malts, and a bit of a toasty nuttiness. Just a faint touch of hop bitterness in the end with an off-dry finish. Brown ales arent my favorite, but if youre a fan of the style, then this is a must-try."
"I had to pour this one in two increments to contain the head. This cloudy brown ale pours with a voluminois light tan head. It very slowly fades to a rocky layer of foam that you must suck the beer through. It leaves about a quarter-inch collar of foam at the top of the glass. For those of us with mustaches, the head wants to collect on the upper lip. The aroma is sweet caramel and a hint of chocolate, with just a touch of hops showing through. The taste is mild and sweet. Chocolate covered caramel and some nice maltiness, followed by a touch of bitterness. A very light sourness creeps in on the finish, but it cleans up the palate very well and prevents the sweetness from hanging around. The mouthfeel is slightly overcarbonated and a tad thin. Drinkability is excellent. If they could just create a little more body for this beer, it would be a real gem. As it is, it is very enjoyable, and I will not hesitate to buy some more if I see it again."
"Lacking in texture."
"Could not find one bad thing to say about this beer and think of it along the lines of a Robust Porter."
"Pours a spectacular mahogony brown with a huge tan head that a pint glass can hardly contain, lots of lace.  Rich aroma of toasted malt, nuts, and bitter chocolate.  Taste is quite complex for a brown ale, begins with sweet toasted malts, which yield to earthy flavors, bitter chocolate, coffee, and hops with a slight sweetness at the end and a dry finish.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.  A truly superb example of this style."
"My second experience with a sixer of an Avery product.  After reading the other two reviews and the BA review, I've gotta wonder if I'm drinking the same beer.  My first bottle was way too heavily hopped for the style.  The beer looked good with a good brown color and small tan head.  Fairly light mouthfeel that's just about right for an American brown ale, but the smell and taste -- hops galore!  Almost as much as their IPA, my first experience with Avery (and one which rated far better).  Don't get me wrong -- I like this beer, but I have a hard time calling it a good example of a brown ale.  Maybe I just got a bad batch . . ."
"Pours a dark amber/ruby color with a creamy off white head.  Roasted malt, slightly wooody/smoky, slight chocolate in the nose.  Some sweet darker and roasted malts are present with a nice balancing hop flavor as well.  Faint chocolate on the tongue.  Smooth and creamy mouthfeel and very drinkable.  I am really starting to come around on brown ales.  This is a real nice one."
"Many thanks to Arctic Liquors for the sample."
