4.25,10.7,,,,,,"From bottles dated 07/15/14, part of 'Fall Pack Seasonal Sampler' 12-pack: Notes of mild chocolate and roasted grain; rather sweet malt; little hop presence.  Drying finish with a slight tang of hop spiciness.  Flavour reminds me of some chocolate stouts, but with a thin body; I'm imagining this is what a sweet and mildly chocolately Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale would resemble.  And it does have an earthy flavour of what I imagine autumn leaves to taste like (in a good way).  While I haven't been enamoured with Brown Ales in general (I think it is often the burnt-sugar taste that puts me off), this is one of the most palatable I've had.  â€”Reviewed 26 October 2014","BubbleChamber","Oct 26, 2014"

A bit of nuttiness -- almost like a chocolate covered nut (of non-descript origin) toward the end. Very smooth, a bit creamy, and has a medium dry finish. Medium body. Delicious autumn ale. I love that is has a lot of flavor but a low abv. I'm not a cigar person, but if you were looking for something ""lighter"" to enjoy with your smoke, this could be it. I could see this with meaty stew or, for a different route, some spicy jambalaya. The spice would round out the sweetness of the beer nicely.","Zraly","Sep 20, 2014"

Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, nuttiness, brown bread, floral, light pepper, and floral/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with moderate earthy hops; and good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, chocolate, brown bread, nuttiness, floral, light pepper, and floral/toasted earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, brown bread, nuttiness, floral, light pepper, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of dark/toasted malt flavors with a moderate earthy hop balance; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent brown ale. All around great balance and complexity of malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 10, 2013"

Sierra Nevada is usually a little hoppy for my taste, but this one goes down real nice and should be everyone's go-to beer for the fall season, but watch out, it tastes totally different out of the tap at a bar!!","austin_page","Sep 03, 2013"

Taste is very malty with the aforementioned aromas present in the flavor. Nicely balanced by hops. Appropriately carbonated and well structured, and a lot of flavor packed into this 5.5 abv brew. As I said, I welcome its arrival each year with the autumn seasonals, and recommend!","BeerWizard","Aug 15, 2013"

The taste is sweet, a bit too sweet I feel, but there are some nice flavors here, specifically brown sugar, bread, and nut. I couldn't taste the hops but I'm sure they're there somewhere. The mouthfeel is light but satisfying, and for as sweet as this is, it's not sticky. Overall, I like this, but it would work better as maybe a dessert beer, say, with some pumpkin pie. As it is, it's a little too sweet but otherwise quite tasty.","DeFaz","Aug 05, 2013"

4.09,6.5,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Overall: A marvelous beer in an underrated and usually poorly done style. Sierra Nevada presents a beer with soft roasted flavors while still conveying just a pinch more of the sweet maltiness of mid-colored beers compared to the often more bitter and overtly roasty porters and stouts. A really excellent beer and one that's great on those cool, crisp fall nights, where you aren't looking for a huge imperial stout nightcap, but don't want something light.

Perhaps the things most people look for in a brown were missing, hence its middling reviews, but for me it may have been these very factors that elevated it above others for me in particular. Absolutely worth a try, as Sierra Nevada has firmly established themselves as a reliable brewer of great craft ales.","Greywulfken","Feb 01, 2013"

It's ideal for someone who is new to craft beer and fears ""dark beers"" I suppose. Would I drink it again? It's unlikely.","JamesMN","Nov 04, 2012"

Drinking this beer brought intense feelings of nostalgia. I eventually stepped out onto my patio and I could smell wood burning stoves filling the autumn air. Great beer and very sessionable! Throw back a couple! I think this beer should be available throughout the winter, too. It is not just a great brew to sip while watching th leaves change, it is a great brew to sip on a cold winter's eve watching the snow fall (if snow will ever fall in the Mountain West!)

Taste has hints of biscuit, caramel then to a lighter chocolate. feel is nice and crisp, with a nice balance that would taste great on a colder night. toasty malt taste lingers in the back of the throat.

Aromas of campfire, hazelnut coffee, and roasted nut. Smells very ""autumn camping"" right off the bat. Flavors are rich and malty, but balance is maintained by the light, carbonated body. Heavily roasted with a hint of the campfire charcoal, the nutty blend is sweet and slightly dark at the same time. Overall, this comes off slightly bitter from all the roasting and firey characteristics, but the deep, rich sweetness balances very smoothly.

Taste is of slightly bitter roasted malt, sourdough, and it has a beautiful nutty aftertaste. I think the smooth aftertaste that is reminiscent of walnuts and peanuts is the most redeeming aspect of this brew. Relatively thick mouthfeel for a brown ale, overall pleasant.

3.98,3.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a pretty amber brown like light grade maple syrup. The head is big, fluffy and smooth, with a nice light tan coloring and it lasts for a little while at a fingers width leaving sticky lacing splotches behind. The beer smells strongly of nutty roasted malts. Hints of roasting bread, earthy hops, and bready yeast can also be found in the nose. There is also a phenomenal whiff of decaying leaves which reminds me so heavily of fall and my childhood that it sends shivers of nostalgia through me. The beer tastes nicely sweet and nutty, with nice roasted notes and hints of nut bread, and earthy hops and leaves. This beer tastes of the fall. It is cool and crisp yet warming and sweet. Slight candied notes reminiscent of maple syrup are also present on the tongue. The beer opens with nutty sweet malt and then transitions into roasted bread before the taste closes down into a roasted nut aftertaste with slight coffee hints. The mouthfeel is kind of prickly with the carbonation, but the beer is smooth and slightly creamy with a nice light chewiness to it. Overall this is a fantastic seasonal brew, and a wonderful autumn brown that stylistically echoes the season in taste and smell. Another great offering from Sierra Nevada, and definitely worthy of a taste.","Maxwell","Oct 05, 2012"

4.09,6.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Creates a frothy two finger head on the pour, quite airy and thus dissolves down swiftly, deep tan in color, the lacing appears sticky at first but only a few streaks persist. Very clear brown hued liquid with a metallic orange tint, some yellowing around the edges, the bubbles are so tiny at first you hardly see how many there are. While the nose has a crisp mocha to cocoa toast to it along with coffee notes, behind that is sweeter caramel, nougat, glazed nuts and honey, gains stiffness from surprisingly strong lemon zest, cut grass and dried flowers, not much fruit, more of a slugger than a glider. In the mouth itâ€™s medium-bodied with a good deal of fizzy carbonation to assist in relieving its weight. More of the nuts, roasted coffee, cocoa and general toastiness, here with more pumpernickel to sourdough bread notes. The roast tends to keep the sweetness in check, allowing for some toffee and butterscotch. The hops have a bitter oiliness to them which is actually for the better as they create a herbal pucker at the end and continue the drying sensations so the mouth feel is not overly creamy. Well-balanced and sessionable, its lack of decisive direction may be offputting to some. Should prove a versatile food beer.","farrago","Sep 24, 2012"

The body poured a beautiful deep brown with lots of active visible carbonation. The nose had a lot of nuttiness on itâ€¦Iâ€™m going with hazelnuts. Maybe even a hint of maple? Although Iâ€™m a total hop head, this smells like fall to me. On first sip, Iâ€™m impressed with how good of a brown ale this was. It had the nuttiness that was apparent in the nose, coupled with sweet malt, and then a minor hint of bitterness. All the flavors work together in concert. The body was on the thinner side with moderate carbonation making it an easy beer to throw down after raking leaves or some other appropriate fall activity. The finish was quick with some bitterness to it, albeit mild. To me, this is a great session beer for the fall and I could see drinking it while sitting by a firepit. This will definitely be a seasonal go-to brew.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"

It delivers. Nice smooth flavor profile with a rounded tone to it. A lot of brown ales I try tend to be too fruity and vibrant, but this is not one of them. It's even. I like this one. It's rare that this style does it for me, but this beer delivers. A pleasure to drink.","RblWthACoz","Aug 23, 2012"

A pleasant malty flavor with light toasted malts and caramel. I thought I caught the cinder flavor similar to Cinder Cone in there at one point. A nice low ABV brown ale.","LiquidAmber","Aug 01, 2012"

Hopping is also reigned in, though there is still a pleasant level of florality in the dryish finish.

Pour produces a creamy and fluffy head -- almost looks like it was poured from a nitro tap -- but there is no lacing to be found. Hints of peaty smoke, earthy hops and yeast, along with light fruity esters. Overall, well balanced and flavorful, but the complexity falls short as the smokey notes take over the beer.

Very nutty, toasty, malty, nose with hints of caramel, and just a touch of coffee and metal. Roasty malts dominate the taste along with an earthy nuttiness with hints of chocolate, toffee, caramel, and just a bit of hoppy bitterness and metal. Very nice balance between the bitter hops and sweet malt. Too many times these types of beers are sickly sweet. Slightly thick mouthfeel with a nice dry, stout-like finish. Another great beer from one of my all-time favorite breweries.","beerdrifter","Nov 07, 2011"

3.78,-1.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Color is dark brown with maroon highlights when held to light. The generous tan head is long lasting and leaves lots of lacing.

3.4,-11.5,4,4,3,3,3.5,"This is a moderately dark, reddish-brown ale, transparent, with a fizzy, short-lived head. The aroma is very inviting...malt and nut, earthy and slightly smokey, a little toast, and a fleeting touch of fruit. Some slight hop scents as well. The taste is moderate in its intensity, with a malt-centric bend. Fairly low in carbonation, and a little lighter in body than I would have preferred. The bottom line is that this is a fairly good and drinkable beer...but not exceptional or really remarkable.","Suds","Oct 15, 2011"
3.88,1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a standard pint glass. Color is deep, deep mahogany, like a dark ruby red. Head is a one-inch thick fluffy, creamy pillow of froth. The head dissipates to an even film of bubbles across the top. Pretty decent sticky lacing. This beer tastes solid, a more richly flavored brown ale. Toffee, caramel, and roasty malts are present. Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated, but really nice, this beer doesn't feel watered down. Overall, this is a fine Autumn beer. It's easily sessionable. It's along the same lines as a Breckenridge Autumn Ale, for comparison. Great for a chilly evening, I'd recommend trying this one if you like Autumn Ales.","JuicesFlowing","Oct 15, 2011"

English style mineral undertone firms up the dryness while leaving a lovely toasted brown bread in the finish. A bit of butter and sweet mild molasses. Feel is crisp and lightly creamy with a lovely suppleness to the light medium weight. This is super drinkable and goes with pizza as well as traditional hearty fall fare. A great American brown.

3.82,-0.5,5,3,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good American Brown Ale. Everything about this beer was pretty good with nothing seeming off or out of place about it and the drinkability was really good, it just had the right combination of flavor and smoothness that made them go down quicker then expected, a six pack during a nice fall bonfire would for sure hit the spot. What I like most about this beer was the appearance, it looked exactly how I would want a Brown Ale to look, and the nice flavor was also very noteworthy. If I had to choose something I liked the least about this beer it would have to be the aroma, it was good, but the sweet dark fruits seems a little weird, but that really wasn't a big deal at all. I would for sure buy this beer again, there's a good chance I will be getting another twelve pack before it disappears for the year. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone, and if Brown Ales are your thing then they don't get much more drinkable then this. This beer makes my top three Brown Ale list but I still think Indian Brown is my favorite. This was another good beer from Sierra Nevada, every style I try from them always seem like a good drinkable representation of the style and this beer is no different, thanks for sending your quality brews to Michigan Sierra Nevada.","StoutHunter","Oct 08, 2011"

The flavor is malty and nutty, toasted almonds again, toffee, caramel, cocoa and milk chocolate linger in the shadows. Very nice finish, mouthfeel is creamy and balanced, velvety and slightly sweet, very sessionable. This beer is not complex, just an excellent example of what a brown should be.

3.76,-2.1,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"It came in a brown bottle. It gave a two finger rootbeer like head. The color is dark brown with inviting red highlights. I could see almost nothing through the mug. There was some transluscence but the beer borders on the opaque.The head maintained for a few minutes more then half its initial thickness. There is a moderate amount of carbonation bubling apparent. It smells hoppy and yeasty to me. The malty sweetness is quite evident without beeing overpowering. The thickness is moderate. There is light to moderate short bunchy-lined lacing. There is a nutty chocalatey taste. After becoming acclimatized to more hoppy beers I can tell the hops are there but the bitterness is more ballanced. It seems well buit.

Taste is very thin and dry from what I was expecting. I'm wondering if the tap line was clean, because this beer really disappointed me based on the glowing reviews I've read. Mouthfeel is dry, w/ a little hop bite/malt smoothness. Overall I wouldn't look for this again.

4.13,7.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"After the pour this one is a great deep mahogany brown with a nice and thick light khaki head. Great ruby red highlights when held up to the light, just a touch shy of clear. The smell is of beautiful roasty malts. Nice caramels and a bit of toffee with a touch of west coast hop and some light yeasty ester. The taste reminds you that this is an american brown without overdoing it. Sure there are some west coast citrus and pine hops in there but the focus remains the malt and the balance lies a touch to the malt side. Granted this beer has way more hop than an english leaning brown ale but there it is clear it's a brown ale. The mouthfeel too is pretty good. A moderate body and and medium levels of carbonation with a finish that is slightly drying with a lingering roast malt character. Overall this is a very solid brown ale. The low alcohol and great taste make it good for a session. I've always been a big brown ale fan and I look forward to this one every Autumn.","fank2788","Sep 05, 2011"

Tastes of sweet toasted malt yeast and oats. Touch of hop bitterness near the end. This is the only brown ale besides Dogfish that I have had that I like. While not quite up to the level of DF it is probably a better representation of the style. I find most brown ales to be too sweet, but this one gets it right.

Flavor, like the aroma, is a bit subdued. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a high amount of carbonation. Tingles a little on the tongue. Drinkability: Good drinkability.

4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear dark iced tea color with a 1 inch puffy light brown head that settles to a thin cap. Nice rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, slight caramel, and some spices. Taste is of toasted bread, burnt caramel, and a spicy flavor on the finish. There is a bitter spice taste that lingers on the back of the tongue after each sip. The carbonation level on this one is good with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good brown ale that is very appropriate for a Fall beer. The toasty malt smells and flavors remind me very much of the season.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 27, 2011"
3.6,-6.3,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"After being impressd by Ovila on tap and a huge fan of British Browns I figured I'd try some other SN. This beer looks good nice head with lacing. The smell is toast, caramel, and almost a cross between a german dunkel and a nut brown. The taste is not bad, and the hop used are an interesting twist on the style. I guess that is the explaination for an ""American"" Brown Ale (american hops). Seemed a bit over carbonated. The beer kind of explodes in your mouth. I prefer more mellow carbonation for the style.","OttoPeeWee","Aug 27, 2011"
3.53,-8.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I like the way this beer looks. Big fluffy head, tan colored, and it leaves attractive looking lace behind. The beer itself is a warm reddish brown color and clear, letting light pass through casually. Aroma is wholesomely malty and comforting. Kind of like freshly baked pumpkin bread minus the pumpkin. It is also a little bit buttery, with decomposing leaves, and apple cider. Nice mix of scents. Taste is malty and a little darker than the scent. More leafiness, some dank bitter hops, with both nuttiness and woodiness. This beer is fitting of its name. The body is medium, with moderate to mellow carbonation. Somewhat slick texture with an added grittiness. Overall a solid brown ale, fitting of the fall season. Also rather sessionable making the 12 pack a good choice.","tastybeer","Aug 27, 2011"

4.37,13.8,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,"Tumbler Autumn Brown Ale is a very dark brown, almost black, cola colored brew. When held to the light you'll notice the body is mostly dormant, I just saw a lone carbonation bubble rise up. Topping the beer is a large, pillowy, tan colored head, with a lot of lace left in its wake. The nose has a lot going one, caramel and chocolate malt, a bit of smoke, some spice and cinnamon, maybe a touch of coffee and some nut tones as well. The taste is kinda like your classic nut brown ale, but they did a great job moving it beyond that. Starts with a toasted caramel malt front, a bit of chocolate, fairly bitter from the hop, some well blended spices, a touch of cinnamon, nutty, a bit of fruitiness from the yeast, just a touch of brown sugar. Medium bodied and fairly sharp on the tongue.","Tballz420","Aug 25, 2011"

The smell is more of roasted malts than I expected, a little coffee, a little brown sugar. Feel is medium. Taste is pretty good, I get some brown sugar, caramel, roasted nuts, with a bitter roasted malt / hop finish. Overall this is a pretty fine brown ale, I actually got it expecting it would be sweeter and I could give it to friends when they come over, I don't see them liking it though so I'll just have to drink the whole thing (its good so that shouldn't' be a problem). Another fine beer from a brewery which seldom disappoints.","DavidST","Aug 25, 2011"

This is an American Brown and when it comes to ABA, I havent much experience. This is a good tasting brew, but IMO needs to have a little more of the killer flavors it has.

Somewhat nutty in taste with flashes of caramel, light cocoa, maybe a little vanilla, some chocolate. Light in mouthfeel with nice even bitterness.

It finishes with a mild grassy bitterness that counters the sweetness. A watery thin feel at the front of each taste, then it grow to become more of medium bodied feel that lasts till the end. It finishes with a light dryness on the back of the palate.

Maybe some slight roasted grains and a touch of nut like aroma but that was about it, still, not half bad. the flavor followed along the aroma very closely and honestly reminded me of another brew, the Tommyknocker maple brown in that level of sweetness. Tons of maple sugar here and alot of nutty flavors as well. Some nice roasted malt notes as well in here. A slightly grassy and earthy hop flavor in the finish, but everything was completely dominated by the maple syrup like sweetness. A bit too over the top for me to be honest. The feel was very carbonated with a load of bubbles racing through giving it a very soda like feel, nice to see coming out of the can for sure. Light in testure without much of a follow through it came in ok for me, nothing really special, but nowhere near flat in anyway, nor did it really feel very thin.","mikesgroove","Feb 25, 2011"

There's nothing too exceptional about this one. I would say that it's a bit hoppy, though not along the ""India Brown Ale"" line--it's got more of an earthy kick to the finish that I'm enjoying.

It is a slightly warming brew that will not overwhelm you with alpha acids.

Smell is nutty, bready, and doughy malts, earthy and floral hops, touch of cream, and some tree bark. Flavour is light chocolate, grainy and roasted malts, slight sweetness, biscuit, brown sugar, and a balancing hop bitterness with fruity and grassy undertones. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp spiciness upfront, brief flash of astringency, quick and toasty finish with very little aftertaste. The palate thins out significantly as the beer warms and the nose is pretty restrained, but aside from these flaws, this is one of the better brown ales that I've tried.","cratez","Nov 30, 2010"

The aroma was of caramel malt, toasted malt, some bread and biscuit notes and a little chocolate malt as well. The flavors were very similar with more of an emphasis on the roasted malt and the addition of enough hops to make the finish quite dry but clean. A little sweet malt lingered on my palate after the last gulp, but in a pleasant way. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation good as well.

The nose is fairly faint with a subtle malt flavor coming through, and just a little hop crispness, which only seems to emphasize the malts. The taste mirrors the smell very closely. The main flavor is a smooth well balanced malt character, with just the right hop crispness to emphasize those malts without being too noticeable on its own. This beer has quite a good mouth feel, not too heavy, not too light, and it goes down quite smoothly.

Half way through the glass it thinned out some more, leaving me enjoying a beverage that just as easily could have been something other than beer. Very light carbonation.

Medium carbonation and a relatively light body, quite good drinkability and surely sessionable.

Last six-er they had left on the shelf, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top yields a roasted malt with a hint of chocolate. Pours into a trusty ale receptacle to a dark root beer colour, with a foamy multi-sized bubble head. Taste first preceded by a notable mouthfeel, carbonated and with substantial density. The taste then kicks in with a very roasted and smoky maltiness, the smoke is as fresh as if you are standing next to a bonfire. After the malt belt there is a noble bitterness that is more chaulky and dry than bitter. The bitterness then increases and lingers in the aftertaste. A good brew with flavor belt with a relatively clean finish on the end. This as all of SNB brews is unique in itself and highly drinkable.

It has a very nice aroma with all of the roasted malts making themselves known along with some cocoa and nutty scents evident as well. The taste is much of the same. The roasted malt qualities come through upfront with slightly bitter-chocolate notes which are followed by a smooth and caramel finish. This is a really well balanced brew with a hint of sweetness at the end and I find it to be delightfully drinkable.

There's a mix of roasted grains, cocoa, smoke, nutty malts, and a touch of caramel candy in the flavor. The finish has mild citrus rind taste with a clean bitterness that matches nicely with roasted grains.

Taste is a light brown, pretty simple, toast and the like with nuts and some small sugar sweetness, not all that large. Caramel. Feel is thin and approaching watery but not quite there. Carb is on the low side, not very lively on the mouth. Im not a brown ale type of guy but this remains drinkable, I could have two or so.

Taste is a bit sweet with some gentle hop bitterness and more touches of chocolatey malt than I got from the aroma. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich for the abv. Tumbler hits the notes that I'm looking for in a brown stout. It's easy-drinking with a nutty malt flavor and not too much hops. That said, I'd prefer even less hop flavor/bitterness and more nuttiness relative to caramel, and I'm not really sure that I'd order a second glass.

This new thing from SN is redeeming, however. I can't comment much on the color because I drank it from a red plastic cup, but the head was a pleasant tan with many loose bubbles. The aroma was akin to a British ale, with oranges and something that came close to those giant SweeTarts you ate as a kid (not the tiny ones in the shiny bags, but the big fat ones you got at Halloween). The body isn't very thin, thankfully, and the taste is neither sweet or overly toasted, although there's a decent flavor of roastiness that fits with the theme of the beer. It's nice and dry at the end, too, without being ham-handedly bitter. It's not a big commitment and you can drink more than one without too much wobble.

Large bubbly head that goes at least a half inch if not a little bit higher. Moderate lacing. Aroma is all roasted malt, almost bordering on smokey. There's some dark chocolate fudge notes as well. Smells like a smoked chocolate chip cookie. Light and creamy mouthfeel, almost like a cream stout. Beer is fairly assertive, bitterness levels are relatively high for the style. Taste is almost all roasted and toasted malt. Kind of has a sourdough toast or toasted English muffin type of taste to it. There's no real hop character, save maybe some light orange hops in the finish which play well off the chocolate flavors throughout the body of the beer.

Both aroma and taste are 100% roasty, but not in a coffee or smoky way, and there is a nice earthy sweetness. The hops have enough of a presence to distinguish this brown ale from the more malt-forward Octoberfests of the season. That added balance kicks up the drinkability for me. Sierra Nevada has nailed it again.","coachdonovan","Sep 05, 2010"

Luckily, the fine folks at the CK had my back on this one. It pours a clear russet topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises brown sugar, nutmeg, light maple syrup, and a slight tinge of flowers. The taste holds notes of nutmeg, walnuts, flowers, and some light maple syrup. Simple, but effective.

4.1,6.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The beer pours a rich dark brown with cherry highlights when backlit. A light tan head forms, somewhere between two and three fingers in height, and holds it's ground for a minute before fading away. Lacing is decent, but nothing spectacular. Nose is more caramel/biscuit than more roasted aromas like chocolate or coffee, and there's a bit of hop aroma at the end (one of the nobles if I had to guess, not sure which though). Taste profile is an exact duplicate for Tumbler, heavy on the caramel and light on the roast (for a brown ale at least) with a little floral hop flourish and no real bitterness to speak of. At first I was bothered by a certain perceived thinness of body with Tumbler, but I'm mostly past it and realize that it's appropriate for a relatively restrained brew. Carbonation is nice and low, spot on for the type of brew SN was shooting for. As one might expect, for such a traditional and well executed brown ale Tumbler is very drinkable, in the time it took me to type this review up my glass is almost empty. A great new offering from Sierra Nevada and one I'll definitely come back to this fall.","axeman9182","Sep 04, 2010"

Taste is nice though - malt, toffee, and a bit of dusty hops. Pretty straightforward and drinkable, tasty, just nothing particularly charismatic about this one.

Some spatters and swaths of lacing exposed during the tasting. Great nose - caramel malt, a little nutty and roasty and the faintest of hop aromas to cut some of the malty sweetness. Taste follows nose; however, there's also a bit of a roasted coffee character in the mix. All and all a nice well-rounded body with a light hops profile to even out the finish.

Especially the use of smoked malt, which gives this a dry dark chocolate profile. Unexpectedly good. The contrast between the dark brown color and the white foam, make this a beautiful ale glass presentation. Smooth with chocolate-mocha notes presents similarities to Schwarz bier.

I also pick up some roasted malt as well. The ale has a moderate to full body and tingly carbonation which gives an almost creamy feel.
