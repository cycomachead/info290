4.12,-4.8,3.75,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"Overall, initially it was hard to find exactly how to differentiate Cacao Bender from Coffee Bender.  From the aroma alone it smells like walking to a Starbucks.  Straight up.  To say otherwise would be a stretch of the truth.  With warmth, the bittered cacao does begin to seep through the cracks of that coffee wall.  The taste, on the other hand, is much more amped up.  You get so much of that coffee, and it’s raw and black as ever, up front, but the kicker is that this is bolstered by equally as raw, dark, and bittering dark chocolate.  With each sip it dries you out a touch more, and clamps down just a little bit harder with that chalky, bittering puck.  Ultimately, the cacao doesn’t seem any more robust than the coffee, but together, and coming fresh off the tap, it is pure enjoyment.","TheBrewo","Feb 10, 2015"

Nice and deep dark brown with a thin, but long lasting cocoa colored head. The smell is slightly sweet at first, like a milk chocolate bar, but some dark cocoa and roasted malt notes come in stronger as it warms. Initially it tasted sweet, but in the back of the palate it becomes slightly bitter and roasty. It is silky smooth in body with moderately low carbonation. Really a top quality beer. Definitely worth seeking out.","jsprain1","Jan 05, 2014"

4.48,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"First time trying this one. On tap at the brewery. Had Moe's many times and all except the last time in which it was syrupy and cloying it was a superb beer that managed to be so flavorful at such a low ABV. Anyway this similar version to Moe (without the wood aging) is also a fantastic beer. Tons of flavor yet not filling and easy to drink multiples of. Rich cocoa powder flavor on top of the already solid coffee taste and the rich roasted malt backbone of Bender with a fair amount of vanilla to top it off...this is so tasty. The mouthfeel on this version is lighter than Moe's but still has a rich, silky mouthfeel upfront that quickly dissipates inviting that next drink. Similar to Moe's I would love to see Surly make more of either one of these beers. Just takes Coffee Bender to the next level. What a beer that is so flavorful yet very drinkable!","deebo","Jul 24, 2013"

Aroma is predominantly lightly roasted coffee with notes of toasty cocoa, chocolate and roasted peanuts. There is a hint of vanilla as well. Flavor is a bit thinner than the aroma. Dry cocoa, peanuts, slightly bitter coffee and a tiny bit of sourness. Medium mouthfeel, a bit thin for the style. Moderate bitterness.","Florida9","Aug 11, 2012"
