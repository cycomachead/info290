3.69,-5.9,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a good example of a Brown Ale, the aroma threw me off a little, but once I got to the taste I enjoyed it more and those aspects that I look for in the style started to show up.  This beer had nice drinkability, It was smooth, pretty crisp, slightly prickly, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these, especially in the fall time.  What I like the most about this beer was the taste, it was pretty nice and true to style.  What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it was just a little unbalanced with the yeast being too dominant.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I  would recommend trying it if you like Brown Ales.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it wasn't the most impressive Brown Ale I've had, but it was still nice and in the end I enjoyed it.  It's not a favorite of the style and I would say it's right on the same level as their Finest Kind IPA.  Nice job guys, this was a nice Brown Ale, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Feb 23, 2015"

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, chocolate, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, chocolate, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent brown ale style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 09, 2015"

4.42,12.8,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Pours copper brown with light haze and a stubborn, full head of foam. Lace coats the glass. Nose is sweet toasted malt, toffee, nutty with a touch of chocolate. Has some herbal hops in back, lightly fruity that give a touch of earth. Taste is rich malt and lightly sweet. Velvety smooth and buttery biscuit with subtle, herbal dark fruits. Hops show up mid palate with some bitter, fade quickly and the malt opens up with some roast and coffee. There’s a malt dryness and a slight alcohol dryness that’s stately yet devil may care. Aftertaste is lightly sweet and bready. This is a very original brown ale with a rousing and robust malt character. Fantastic.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

The beer’s body is dark, but relatively clean with a very light haze. On the nose, the beer smells of a nutty roast, similar to lighter porters that I have smelt. Hazelnut coffee comes to mind, though there is a very faint bitter kiss to the nose suggesting hops, and some semisweet chocolate notes. The beer tastes lightly roasty and nutty, with some lovely light complexities playing on the tongue. The beer begins with light sweet caramel malts before opening into very light roasted flavors which eventually introduce nutty and chocolate flavors that smooth through the finish alongside the returning caramel malts. The aftertaste is of sweet malt coffee, almost like bittersweet chocolate. As I sip it more, I notice a certain bitter quality building in my mouth, though it has no discernible flavoring to it. On the mouth, the beer feels medium of body, with a nice chewiness to it. The mouth is left a little roasted dry on the tongue, but with a good sheen of saliva sitting over the tongue to dampen it down. Overall, this is a really nice brown ale. I’m actually really digging this beer right now. It doesn’t blow you away in any category, but has an all-around balanced flavoring that is excellent to sip on. This beer is a great fall beer, I imagine, and is surely excellent for sipping on as you watch the world blow by. This beer is the next step up from sessionable. A good beer from Smuttynose for sure!","Maxwell","Jan 01, 2013"

I can't quite pick out all the aromas, but it is pleasant and appealing. Taste is very well balanced. Lucious and sweet upfront seamlessly giving way to a mild hoppiness on the finish. It is a mild flavor, yet a full flavor as well. Nothing is quite in your face, but it is loaded with understated flavor. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with a small aftertaste that is similar to dark chocolate. I wish I had bought more of these. Maybe next trip.","Mojo","Nov 11, 2012"

Taste is malty sweet with a distinct bit of dark fruit and ethanol. Lots of toffee and brown sugar and luckily not much butter survives. Light earthy hop flavor helps balance the malt. Medium body and level of carbonation with a sweet earthy mineral mouthfeel. Don Henley said "Don't look back you can never look back."

Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good enough. Aroma is nice and malty, the brew smells like bready and caramel malt, nuts, bittersweet chocolate and toffee. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also a bit of dark fruit flavors noticeable (cherries, raisins). Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and coating with good carbonation. I think this is a good overall brown ale, I'd buy this again in the future. I liked it.","bluejacket74","Dec 29, 2011"

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Found this poor little doggy in the back of my fridge, a few days after his best-by month. Hope he's still a good boy! Pours a red-brown color with a modest head that quickly shrinks to a cap. Aroma is roasty maltiness, with some cocoa powder underneath. Standard, but solid. The taste is a nice, toasted malt with earthy aspects. There's a bit of hop on the finish. A dry brown ale. The mouthfeel is well-carbonated and medium-bodied, and the drinkability is about what you'd expect for the ABV. Overall, a good brown ale.","shand","Nov 13, 2011"
3.88,-1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Attractive rich brown pour with 1+ finger of off white head. Minimal lacing that vanishes quickly. Smell is of carmel and nuts. Perhaps a note of malts/bread grain. Mild on the nose. Taste is quite smooth with only a minimal hops bite on the end. Some bitterness, but more on the malty end of the spectrum. Taste follows the nose with carmel and a nutty/earthy tone. Feel is a good mix of carbonation and silk. A little dry, but not watery. Overall- A pretty solid brown, but nothing outstanding. Could use a boost on the flavor with more rich/complex notes. Pretty straight forward brown. Will drink another without a doubt- Pretty tasty-","TheDinger","Nov 12, 2011"

A reminder of what a simple, good, malty brown ale tastes like. If nothing else, it'll help you appreciate your alpha acids and IBUs when you return to the bitter side. This beer is completely at the other end of the spectrum. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. And I know I'll buy it again.","UnderPressure","Nov 10, 2011"
4.07,3.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"O - A nice roasty brown ale. Not dark enough to be a porter, but more hop presence than an English Brown. If you like brown ales, this is a very good representation.","mckajd03","Nov 09, 2011"

3.73,-4.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"M - Not too much carbonation, which makes the initial mouthfeel quite nice and smooth. Tingles only slightly, which is what I look for in a brown ale.

No ABV printed on bottle that poured a rich caramel color w/no head but lil bubbles. Hoppy, malty and a lil typical but NOT smooth goin' down...kinda had to choke her down, before I split the rest w/the sink drain.

I've never had a tastier brown ale besides Dogfish Head's IBA but thats not really a brown ale because of it being a hybrid beer. So on its own this is my favorite brown ale to date. The kiss of hops on the beginning and after taste balances this beer out so well. The doesn't takes away from the malts at all and the dry finish really compliments the cocoa like chocolate malts. The earthy herbal aftertaste also really gives this beer an excellent score in the taste department. I got this in the Smuttynose variety sampler 12 pack and its definitely worth buying.","thebrood1987","Jul 15, 2011"

Aroma is a moderate malt nose with notes of toasted biscuit, toffee, and a light but sharp pungent earthy fruit spice. Mouthfeel is a pretty gentle malt sweetness with hints of roasted pistachio, light caramel, and a light but outstanding hop note.

A touch of sweetness. The taste starts off with some decent hopped bitterness, then blends into some sweet and very slightly sour roasted/toasted malts. Decently cocoa-like. Nicely complex, in all. The finish is smooth and bitter, actively carbonated. More leaf litter for the aftertaste, but that seems to be a constant among the Smutty's that I've tried, and it's not a bad thing.

The nose is kinda faint, with notes of light brown sugar, dark wheat, light roasted malts, light maple syrup, and a touch of greens sliding up the nose eventually. The taste is also subdued, but the walnut, rye bread, biscuit, brown sugar, maple syrup, and greenery notes come through nicely, in a rather pleasant blend. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel.

3.58,-8.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Conclusion: I'm honestly not sure how I feel about this one. It's kind of got the dry, nutty character of a Samuel Smith's Nut Brown, with the fruity esters of a Newcastle, with stronger minerally notes and a pretty stout dry hoppiness on the finish. I'm not really sure if that all comes together to make a good beer. It's interesting, and a different take on the style for sure, but it's only moderately successful IMO.","BedetheVenerable","Jan 06, 2010"

It pours a chill-hazed coppery brown hue with a thick finger of tan head. Chocolate malt and light caramel in the nose, with just a touch of hops. Tastes bready, with notes of Munich and chocolate malt, and a light sweetness on top of a medium body that finishes dry, and has a bit too much carbonation for my liking. This is a simple but delicious brew that is very forward with the chocolate malt and is well-worth a try.

The taste is more of the same, except less sweet than the nose suggests and there's anearthy bitterness on the finish, along with a little bit of dark fruit. There's a little bit of a musty cardboard taste coming in late that I don't care for, but it's mild and easy to ignore. The nutty character seems to build after several sips.

A bit of noticeable warming alcohol, particularly as it comes to room temperature, despite of its relatively pedestrian ABV. An excellent, no-compromise everyday beer, particularly when you feel like taking a break from the hop-bombs that we all seem to enjoy so often.","parkeak0","Aug 11, 2009"

The head dies down to a thin coating, leaving a coating on the sides of the glass. There isn't much aroma to this beer, jsut a hint of something toasted. There are some hops and bittnerness to the taste, but nothing overpowering. I can also detect toasted molasses. The best way to describe it is that it tastes like a brown ale (who says you can't use the term you're defining in the definition). It has an average amount of carbonation and a light-to-medium body. I'm not generally a fan of browns, but I like this beer.","ToasterChef","Jun 09, 2009"

Nice shiny amber color with a decent, fluffy head; marvelously malty nose which anticipates a mildly toasted, lightly smoky taste. Plenty of malt, of course, but not too much and there's just enough alcohol to make it taste a tiny bit tart. Affordable and definitely one to keep on hand.

The smell is a good representation of the taste; strong malty backbone with the toasted malt and light coffee flavor dominating, with a solid hop augmentation to make for a smooth tasting, easy drinking beer.

In the mouth it's medium-bodied, the carbonation strongest during entry, as this recedes the butterscotch, toffee, fig, date flavors come forward.

The flavor is superb: it contains elements of roasted malts, intense nutty flavors, a mild, sugary sweetness, just a trace of hoppy bitterness at the finish, and a lingering malty aftertaste. Honestly, this is one of the best brown ales I've ever come across. Period. So many tend to focus on the darker, dry style; this one is sweeter and has a stronger "brown" essence.

Just a touch, not offputting, of band-aid. On the palate, surprisingly thick on the tongue, with light carbonation. The first impression is of sweet malts, followed by a crusty baked note and a parting note of herbal bitterness.

Flavorwise, much the same, a robust bready and chocolaty mouthfilling flavor dominates. Carbonation is medium low and the finish is malt heavy, but not very sweet. Very little in the way of fruit esters, which is more indicative of an English style and abv puts it out of style as well.

The taste is very malty, with coffee, roasted and toffee malts all seemingly coming out. Caramel and/or honey in there too to round out the medium/slightly heavy body. Goes down smooth with a semi-sweet finish as the hops appear to add a little fruitiness(apples or cherries) and on the backbite for slight dryness.

A medium bodied at the front, it gains a more hefty feel as it rolls across the palate.

The carbonation has a smooth medium mouthfeel and is great right out of the bottle. Pairs excellently with anything roasted as the caramelized flavors match while the carbonation and lime citrus clear the palate for the next bite. A dessert match would be chocolate pecan pie. Also a great beer to session with and stick to for the length of any party, bbq, boat trip, camping trip etc. etc. etc.... Very consistent whether sampled on-tap, bottled or growler.

This aroma is subtle, but really nice. The taste follows suit, serving up some subtle nut and coffee flavors, with a slightly fruity (cherries and raspberries) background. Mouthfeel is layered, but smooth, with a nice bitter finish. An exceedingly drinkable beer. I am so glad that there are some fine American craft breweries out there doing styles like this very well. This is a great brown ale, and both fans and skeptics of the style should give this one a try.

A fair bit of alcohol comes through as well. The mouthfeel in nice great full body with a pleasant finish that is not too dry or too sweet.

The taste is definitely the strongest aspect: a very reserved and well-crafted nuttiness melds with chocolatey malts and a modest leafy-earthy hop bitterness. The finish is both biscuity and restrainedly-hoppy -- a very "English" flavor. Smooth mouthfeel, slightly carbonated. The finish isn't long, the body is just about dead-on medium.

Pretty well balanced first taste, almost hard to get a read as all of the above mentioned flavors take their turns vying for dominance. Actually makes it fairly interesting. Malts became more pronounced in the aftertaste followed by the hops. Both were fairly strong in their own right. A nice creamy mouth feel as well. Definitely not a killer alcohol-wise and I feel as if, though strong in taste, it doesnt blow your taste buds. I could have more. All in all, definitely more hops than I expected, bordering on weak IPA levels. This is a tasty brew and the hound on the label is quite handsome as well.","BabaJohn","Aug 16, 2006"

Starts like a hoppy amber ale, then morphs into a bit of nutty brown flavor, and then leaves a husky ghost note of dark or roasted malt as it fades. It's balanced, but still leans toward hops, and the type of hop used is a little dominant making it taste like a strong amber over the browner, nuttier subtleties. Mouthfeel is on par and medium bodied, balanced, and lively. Invites drinking. I'm torn if this is too hoppy to imagine friends drinking it or not.

Can't get too much smell, but it may be a little cold so I'll need to wait for it to warm a little. Hint of roasted malts in the nose. Really nice example of a brown ale - dark amber in color. The roasted malts come in the beginning of the sip and the hops carry the beer through nicely to the finish. Not overwhelming in the hops department, just enough to balance the beer. This balance, coupled with the creamy mouthfeel make for excellent drinkability. An English Brown I would recommend and will remember the next time I am in the mood for one.","willytime","Mar 26, 2005"

There is this taste in several of the Smuttynose beers that I can't quite put my finger on (if you have any insight, beermail me) but my best explanation is a non-hop piney woodsyness, with some raisons or something.

The aroma is a stately melange of singed biscuit and carob, accompanied by mild earthy hops and mellow toffee. Understated figgish esters and butterscotch surface as it breathes. Agreeably well rounded aromawise. Judicious dark brown sugar - like sweetness bathes the palate incipientally in flavor; it is promptly complemented by a partially drying combination of grainy, crumbly, lightly salted biscuit and well integrated, calm hop bitterness. Earthy, tracely woody hop tones emerge mid palate concomitantly with subtle notes of buttery chocolate to lend a subtle, but relishable impression of fresh pipe tobacco. Lightly bodied, but appropriate and well matched to malt character in its softly dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes trim and mostly dry, with a transient snap of dried date sweetness yielding to quickly fleeting notes of faintly buttery oak. Although ashen in hop presence and simple in its malt profile, Old Brown Dog exhibits sufficient depth of overall character to both satiate and tease the palate for more.

Aroma wasn't to strong but there was a presence of malts and raisons. Mouthfeel was smooth and little to no carbonation. Taste of caramel, malts a slight raison flavor mild bitterness to this beer. Almost no hop flavor present here. Overall a tasty beer....","Running4beer","Jul 31, 2003"
3.55,-9.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Reddish brown pour, with a small white head. Aroma is sweet malt, with hints of caramel. Body is closer to medium then thin, with light carbonation. Taste starts malty and moves to a very sweet caramel with very subtle hops, finishes sweet and slightly buttery. Not a bad brown ale, not to complex, pretty drinkable.","fattychubs","Jul 16, 2003"
4.09,4.3,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thin white head that provides good lacing. The smell is of rich chocolate, crystal, and roasted malts.; a true brown ale. The taste is smooth and balanced. The complexity of this brew is what I like the most about it. It signifies what a brown ale should be; amber/brown in color, good malty aroma, a complex balance of specialty malts, and a smooth finish. The mouthfeel is low to medium which makes this a nice sessions beer.","WesWes","Jul 11, 2003"
3.85,-1.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"A nice,cloudy orange/brown color with a slight tan head. A little toasted malt and earthy hop on the nose followed by a nicely balanced caramel malt and earthy hop flavor. Some toasty malt flavor comes out in the finish along with a bit of nuttiness, a decent brown ale.","jeffboo","Jul 08, 2003"

3.85,-1.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"I found it to be similar to Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale, but not as complex. Other reviewers have noted more malty sweetness, but I didn't notice any. Assuming the beer didn't get skunked, perhaps it will mellow out in the cellar. If the brewing date was indeed March 2003, it may need to sit awhile. Good dog!","WaltTrombone","Mar 23, 2003"

3.8,-3.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This ale poured a reddish amber brown with very, very thin white foam, and almost no carbonation evident. There smell was modest (sweet malt). The taste was sweet and malty with a bit of bisuit and nutty flavors. There was low but noticeable hop character. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with very low carbonation, but with a fairly thin body. The drinkability was good, but the body was on the thin side for this brown ale.","UncleJimbo","Feb 28, 2003"
4.02,2.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This is one of my favorite brown ales due to its drinkability. It's a cloudy reddish brown color with a foamy tan head. I was a little disappointed to see the head disappear so quickly after I poured the beer into a glass. Even the lace slides back down into the beer in short order. The malty and nutty aroma is pleasant and not overpowering. The mouth feel seems a bit thin, however this allows each sip to go down easy. The taste begins malty and is followed by flavors of caramel and nuts. I find a very slight bitter flavor in the finish and aftertaste.","WanderingFool","Jan 25, 2003"
3.95,0.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer spills from the bottle a somewhat hazy mahogany color with the head mountainous and the consistency that of whipped cream, the color a nice light tan and the lace a smothering sheet. Nutty sweet, a touch of yeast and the hop flowers present, clean, fresh, and quite sniffable. Sweet malt at the start, top middling in its mouth feel, the carbonation mild, the hops apropos to the style, the aftertaste droughty and long lasting, and a nice quaffable beer.","Gusler","Jan 17, 2003"
3.63,-7.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a dark amber color with a light creamy tan head that does not stick around. A fine bubble lace is left behind after the first sip. A copper nose and taste hits the palate on the first to the last sip. Chocolate and carmel malt hints are present along with earthy flavors. This is a nice brew but the best brown ale that I have had.","kunzbrew","Jan 13, 2003"
3.86,-1.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a truly beautiful deep mahogany color with a transient head that just coats the top of the glass. Malty sweet, caramel aromas filter into the nasal passages. Flavor continues the malty procession, with a "toasted malt" flavor dominating. Mouthfeel is defninitely creamy that floats over the palate. Finishes with just a trace of hoppiness to balance nicely.","OldFrothingSlosh","Jan 13, 2003"
3.95,0.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Interesting. Although a brown ale, this definitely pushes towards the range of winter warmers/strong ales. Dark brown with reds blending in, a slight head. Malty, with a strong caramel malt flavour that is lightly balanced by a few hops. A little alcohol kick and warmth is inherent. I liked it.","the42ndtourist","Jan 05, 2003"
3.62,-7.7,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Found at Jungle Jim's in Fairlfield. Pours a dark amber with very little head and minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet malt and a little fruit. Flavor consists of malt, nuts, and caramel and tasted better as I let it warm. Overall not fantastic but a solid Brown Ale.","Dogbrick","Dec 18, 2002"
4.1,4.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Brown/mahogany coloring with a thin, fine-bubbled off-white head. Burnt caramel and sweet malt aromas, with tea-like hops as well. Light carbonation; smooth mouthfeel. Masterful balance to this brew: toasted and almost brown sugar-like malts are offset by a pleasantly floral hop flavor. Dry, pretty short finish. I admittedly don't drink enough of Smuttynose's beers, considering their easy availability here in Boston. They don't disappoint.","doerickson","Dec 17, 2002"

3.3,-15.8,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"I usually like this one a lot.  This brew today was not up to par.  First of all, it was served too cold.  Can't taste anything that way!  Caramel/copper color, clear.  Smooth, fine head.  Slightly picky mouth feel, medium bodied.  Mild malt nose.  Has a malt and caramel like taste with a slightly bitter finish.  This one is usually more drinkable.  Maybe was a bit too young?","Alewife","Sep 15, 2002"
4.82,23,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Very rich creamy brown, the color of wet shoe leather. Thick rich creamy tan head. Smell is a burst of carmel sweetness, rich brown sugar smells, like a box of chocolates. Taste was a combination of rich creamy carmel, chocolate malt, and yummy hop kick. Medium bodied, slightly syrupy sweet, but in a good way. Very good, very drinkable, I can't wait to get my hands on more of these. Right up there with Rogue's Brown Necter. My favorite beer of all the ones I tried on my recent New England vacation.","StevieW","Sep 09, 2002"

On the palate there is a caramel malt sweetness, dark fruity notes, toffee perhaps, slight graininess, and a touch of brown sugar, little bready... The mouthfeel is smooth. Emmm, I love this old brown dog...good brew","WilliamPhilaPa","Jul 30, 2002"
3.65,-6.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"All in all pretty good. I had high hopes for this beer and was (probably inevitably) a tad let down. Very sweet malts, caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup hints. It not only looks brown, but tastes brown. I would have liked a little more hop bitterness, perhaps the grassy hints could be embellished into a stronger flavor to balance the sugary malts. Nice mouthfeel but ultimately too syrupy. Am very envious of those who have tried it on cask - I'd imagine this would be a real winner in that format.","Thrasher","Jul 05, 2002"
3.45,-12,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"A nice brown ale.  It poursa nice and bark brown with a respectable head.  The aroma was a bit nutty and somewhat sweet.  The first sip is about what you would expect from the aroma.  Relatively easy to drink.  All in all, nothing to write to momma about.","goindownsouth","Jun 26, 2002"
4.35,11,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Semi clear amberish brown with a bubbly lace that fades slowly. Rich malty aroma with hints of butterscotch and ripe dates. Big toasted maltiness with an underlying fruitiness and buttery flavours. Tad estery with a noticeable alcohol, hops are vague a only aim to balance with virtually no flavour. Finishes with a touch of sweetness and toasted grain all over. A great brown ale to have around all the time.","Jason","May 26, 2002"
3.88,-1,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This one is a keeper.  Real deep, but not hazy dark brown color, head doesn't stick around too long.  Aroma of dark malts and vanilla.  Light carbonation and medium body. Rich, complex flavor with just the right amount of sweetness.  Hard to have more than a few, though due to the richness of it.  Quality all around.","beernut7","May 07, 2002"
