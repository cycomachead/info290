"Overall - Eh, one of the more disappointing craft browns I've had. What's with the sourness? Best by date was still well within range, so it's somewhat baffling."
"Overall- This is a good beer, starting to build a lot of respect for Brooklyn Brewery."
""
""
"Kind of a dark maroon color with a big frothy off white head. Has a dark malty smell with trace amount of hops. Taste has hints of chocolate and roastiness with a tad bit of sweetness. Overall pretty good beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel: Pretty smooth, with a medium body."
""
""
""
""
"O: This needs a bit of sweetness or a bit of hop complexity to step it up a notch. Perfectly drinkable if simple now, but it seems like it's a good base upon which so much could be added"
""
""

"O-I really enjoyed this beer.  It was great with food as well as without. Very versatile. One of my more favorite browns (upslope is good, too). I'm a bit confused by The Bros rating here; I think this is a solidly ""good"" beer (mid 80's score worthy). JMHO"
"Rich malt aromas with traces of chocolate and graham cracker. Pours brilliant brown under a 2” finely bubbled tan tinted white foam cap. Light caramel flavors with traces of chocolate and light grains. Medium carbonation and body with a bright, crisp finish."

"Brooklyn puts their nuts in your mouth."

"This is an all around good beer.  I visited the brewery and was amazed by the dedication to the specific styles of beer the have embraced. The beer itself is worth the effort."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent classic Brown Ale taste."
"Was an ok beer, not much of a brown ale fan"
""
""
""
""
""
"Love it, classic Brooklyn,  one of the staples"
""
"Overall: For me, this is a welcome antidote to the almost relentless hoppiness of most current American beers. The hop-heads will no doubt hate it, but for those who prefer things a bit maltier (ie. people like me) this isn't bad at all. Not sure I'd want to have a session on it at nearly 6% ABV but it's not something I'd actively turn down either."

"Great brown ale with lots of toasted flavors almost like a porter but as smooth as other browns."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty average brown ale. On a cold evening I'd rather have their winter ale."
""
"O- A perfectly fine American Brown.  I wish it was a bit bolder in aroma and flavor, but quite sessionable and easy to drink.  Decent but nothing to write home about. (3.43)"

"Overall: This is more what I think of when I think of a brown ale. In fact, this is nearly a porter. Very much like Turbodog, but less sweet, and having that Brooklyn ale yeast. They seem to have a house style. Interesting that this has a little wheat in the grain bill."
""
""
"O: Solid beer. Not the best Brown ale I've ever had, but still good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured this into a glass, it has a Mahogany color body with thin head. The aroma has roasty malt and a little hop coming from it. The taste has a roasty, chocolaty up front and a little hop towards the back. The malt is more dominant than the hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and overall a good beer."

"Chez Woody's kitchen is much like the alley at the beginning of each episode of ""King of the Hill"" - nothing happens until the CAN is cracked, the bottle cap is popped, the keg is tapped and pouring, etc. The bottle is like my Old Lady at this point - sweating in anticipation of my touch and ready to pop. Boom! The rush of liquid into my glass was fascinating, creating a big, rolling pseudo-cascade as I watched. Like most males, I am a very visual learner and I was transfixed by the creation of two-plus fingers of dense, light-tan head with great retention. I held it up to the naural light of the day to behold and I was not disappointed. I fully agree with ""mahogany", but I might substitute ""garnet"" for ""ruby"" (SRM = > 27, < 34) as I need to put my own stamp on this review. Otherwise, I might just do a cut 'n' paste and call it a day. Did they mention clarity? No. I will classify it as ""button-bright"" and leave it at that. The nose was malty, sure, but cut with a minty, grassy hoppiness. Remind me, why have I not reviewed this until now? Mouthfeel was full and creamy and the taste was like Baby Bear's Brown Ale - just right! The malt was present, but not cloying and the hops were in the mix, but not overwhelming. I have had English Brown Ales that were sickeningly sweet and American Brown Ales that caused me to wonder if the brewer knows when to take his foot off of the gas when it comes to hops. Finish was smooth, semi-dry and eminently drinkable. I do not often drink Brown Ales, but when I do, Brooklyn Brown is my choice. Stay crazy, my friends."

"The brown ale had a pleasing dark brown color with respectable foam retention. The aroma was very mild, but a nice malty-chocolate combo. The taste was great! More noticeable coffee and chocolate notes that I have tasted in a brown ale before and a great heavy dose of the malt. This sounds more like a stout, but Brooklyn made their ale more drinkable with a background of hops, a reasonable alcohol content and a mouthfeel that is certainly full-bodied, but not overly thick and exclusively wintery. A solid brown ale in my book."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a decent sized bubbly off white head that slowly dissipates to a cap. Aromas of caramel and brown sugar with a hint of chocolate and a bit of minty earthy hops to balance. The flavor is malty sweet with just enough earthy hop flavor to balance. Nice malts caramel and hints of chocolate round this one out nicely. Medium body and level of carbonation. Its been a while since I've had a brown ale, but this one is quite serviceable."
""
"Like most Brooklyns, is it the best type of the style you can find? No. Yet the Brown Ale remains a very tasty beer and a strong representative of the style."
""
"Overall: Pretty standard brown ale."
"O-Great brown ale, deep and rich flavors"
""
"Overall: this is a great, well balanced beer. Deep, rich, malty with a nice bitter finish. Solid beer, definitely worth a try."
""

"M: Medium bodied, well carbonated, smooth and good for sipping"

"O: Well balanced; a really nice brown ale. One of my favorites."

"Poured a hazy brown with a medium thick light tan head. Light toasted malt aroma. Flavor was slightly nutty with a little bit of sweetness and just a little hint of tartness. Thinner in the body. Overall, not as rich and robust an offering in the brown ale category as others."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I hope this beer could be less light too, it is too much light!"

"O-nice American brown ale. I prefer the English browns more, but this was good. rich chocolaty flavor with a nutty taste that isn't too in your face. solid beer from Brooklyn."

"Poured into a Sam Adams glass it produced a small head that disappeared quickly. Appearance was brown as promised. Smell was mildly porter like with more malt than hops, ala Oktoberfest. Taste follows smell, red fruit, coffee and chocolate. Somewhere in the realm of a Porter and Oktoberfest or a Stout. Malt and hops are perfectly balanced. I'll need lots more of this for St Paddys."

"Brooklyn Brewery has yet to go wrong in my book, with some solid lagers and pale ale family offerings tried to date. Here we try the brown ale, a reddish brown brew with a few fingers of frothy tan head, poured from the bottle into an English pint glass. This one has a nice malty aroma, brown crust, light molasses, and dark fruits with a fragrant cola-like brown spice, herbal licorice, and hints of citrus zest. The palate is also malt-forward, fruity, and spicy, with some orange and grapefruit rind from the more aggressive American brown ale approach to hopping. Tastefully done. Starts with some chocolate chips and light roast coffee, after which a plum and raisin-like fruitiness emerges, followed by cola and a tannic astringency like black tea. Moderately chewy but dries out the mouth a little, finishing long, earthy, and spicy ... Reminds me of an English pale ale or IPA in this regard. Well below a porter or stout in terms of roasted flavor but I appreciate the fruit and spice notes receiving top billing here. Brooklyn has a real knack for combining tactful but assertive flavor hopping with some great old world malt flavors."

"O: need to get this one in my fridge. seems like a good standard English brown ale that in this particular case paired very nicely with some good food. i'm not big on drinking beer during meals, but this worked out really well."
"Overall - Seems adequate to style, but the aroma had me anticipating more malty richness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brooklyn Brown pours a dark brown color with a small head. The aroma is rather metallically, and copperish. The taste has a nice bold malty backbone, with strong yeasty like flavors, with a bit of a nutty flavor. Good bold flavors, nice carbonation, but the metallicallyness is hard to overcome. Overall its a nice bold brown, with some off flavors, but overall its decent."

"went to a non local shop with selection I would rate as below par. couldn't find anything cold that I would usually buy. decided to try Brooklyn brown ale. usually buy stronger browns but none to be had. 5.6 abv figured it to be fizzy watery brown ale. absolutely right . smells bad, tastes bad, not something I would waste money on. there are plenty of better brown ales out there . no reason to buy again."
""
"It's Brooklyn, so even if it's not stellar, it'll still be tasty.. This one is no exception."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell has a good bit of malts to it, a touch of nutiness. Taste is malts up front, some hops, nuts, a little bit of caramel, somewhat mild for the style. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."
""
""
""
"Going a little on the mundane side for my newest mixed-sixer from Total Wine, but, hey, it's all new to me. This stuff pours a clear sunset russet topped by a finger of pale khaki foam. The nose comprises toasted malts, thick toffee, a hint of cocoa powder, and a vague sense of light greens. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a bit of vague breadiness and a touch of dry molasses. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little brown ale, nothing all that special, but something I could see drinking again (though Moose Drool remains my go-to)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good go-to beer if you aren’t feeling adventurous. Also has a pretty good distribution, so you might find it in a liquor store that has a limited craft beer selection."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Layered malt and hop characteristics are enjoyable, but the sour quality and slick mouthfeel are distracting. While not bland, the lack of complexity is disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty good brown ale right here, might not be the best that I've come across but its darn good. Quite affordable too. Would recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A serviceable brown, even if it isn't the most well put together beer. There's nothing that really stands out about it though, and no real motivation to re-visit if other options are present."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Not extraordinary but this is tasty brown ale. A notch above average for the style, more hoppy and less sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is initially sharp almost medicinal but quickly converts to s slightly sweet nutmeg clove vibe. a lot of roasted flavors, coffee. Hoppier than English versions I've sampled."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
""

""
"Overall: Average. Maybe slightly above par. A nice medium bodied beer but not much else. Not a bad anytime beer but far from special"
""
""
""
"O- This is a tasty session beer with nice fresh flavors that are distinct but work really well together. Rich flavor but easier to drink that a stout. I would love to try this on cask as I thing it would really bring out the wonderful depth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A hint of pecans and slightly buttery. Slight hoppiness in the aftertaste gives an interesting edge. Quite rich and lively, especially for a Brown Ale. Thoroughly quaffable. A 12-oz bottle from the mixed 12-pack bought in Lubbock, Texas."
"Overall: I wanted to like this more, because I love Brooklyn Brewey, but it was just ok."
"Went down very easily and I would say that, along with mouthfeel were the beers biggest selling points. A beautiful, creamy and well carbonated feel with some hint earthy caramel and toasted malts coming through in both the taste and smell."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This Brown ale is a lot darker and thicker than most other brown ales I have had. The creamy and smooth texture combined with the balance of flavor really makes this a complete Brown Ale. I got this in a mix-a-six, but would by a 6 pack all by its self. One of the best Brown Ales I have had thus far!"
""
""
"Drinkability : a good beer in the American Brown Ale style."
""
""
"Food match: Dry turkey would be a mistake, apart from that though anything is fair game(meat)."
"O- Nothing out of the ordinary, but pretty tasty. I could definitely session this."

"Brooklyn Brown (bottled) is a solid brown ale that never ""wows"" you, but it's a good representation of an American brown available in a sixer at a good price. It's likely that this is even better in draft form as opposed to the contract-brewed bottled version, as I've found that this has been the case with other Brooklyn Brewery offerings."
""

"Very easy to drink and one that could be enjoyed in multiples. Nothing about this screams amazing, but nothing screams red flag either. A good example of an approachable, enjoyable brown ale."
""
""
"I usually love a good brown ale. I like most of what BBC puts out, but their brown ale left me a poor taste in my mouth. It poured very well. Good dark brown to dark amber color. The nose was of good aroma. It smelled like a brown ale should. Good malt qualities, but the mouthfeel was not there at all. Now I tried it from a bottle served in a pint glass so I will would try it again off a tap (if I could find it in indiana), but until then I would not suggest this for a bottle purchase. Get it on tap otherwise go with something else."

""
""

"Overall- A tasty American Brown Ale from Brooklyn. I liked that it wasn't nut or caramel heavy as other American Brown Ales can be. It could use a tad more sweetness but otherwise the flavours are pretty well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Brooklyn really needs to amp up this offering or just discontinue it altogether. They could probably market it as an English Dark Mild and have better results."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before March 2013. Pours crystal clear reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, toasted malt, roast, light coffee, toffee, herbal, and light dark fruits. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, toasted malt, nuttiness, toffee, roast, light coffee, and light herbal spiciness. Slight herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, toffee, toast, nuttiness, and light herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance, complexity, and robustness; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice brown ale! Nicely robust and full of balanced flavors; and very smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one."

"a good beer, but thats about it, servicable but nothing stand out. the pour is a clear copper to bronze color with a short white head. the nose is plenty of european malts, caramel, pale, and something a little darker. not much hops, but a little sweetness and some earthy tones. flavor is quite good, very wintery, with the sweet form the malt taking center stage in front of a mild english hop backing. not sure what the alcohol is, but i can taste it a little, especially in the finish. still a drinkable brew though, with great carbonation and only just a medium body. i think i like this because its a bock without all the sugar, and not as heavy as some of the spring bocks, its perfect for the season. not the star of the winter 12er, but a beer i will happily consume again."

"O- A really good beer. I've had mixed feelings on the Brooklyn beers I've had in the past but this one is quite tasty. Very chocolaty in character, almost to the extent of Young's Chocolate Stout."
""

""
""
""
""

""
"I will not purchase in quantity but would drink if offered or even order as the first beer in a steak or barbeque restaurant if better options are not available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a beer with some appealing flavors but for my money could use the volume turned up a bit and the carbonation dialed back. A smoother, creamier mouthfeel would aid this one greatly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really nice brown ale with complexity and full flavor. Easy to drink and very accessible. Nicely done"
""
""
""
""
"Very odd beer from a usually reliable brewery. I think it looks fantastic, just like a brown ale should -- a very dark mahogany brown with a creamy head that lingers. Unfortunately the nose is just routine: some cherries, some chocolate reminiscent of very rich sweet milk chocolate, a whisper of hops. The flavors are even more restrained than the nose -- chocolate malt and some hops, mainly, with a very light cherry finish. This beer is interesting in that I think the problem lies in a criteria I usually blow past when I do one of these things -- the mouthfeel. I think the beer is so disappointingly light because I think the mouthfeel is too light, like most brown ales it does better with a heavier mouthfeel (to support the stronger flavors). Not Brooklyn's best."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – I am not really a huge fan. The flavors never really meld well and the transitions are quite abrupt."
"Light bodied with soft carbonation, and a slight aftertaste of cherries. This could be a very nice beer, if the taste and aroma were stronger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its good beer, but I thought the profile on the palate was a bit disjointed, and suggested room for improvement. Overall, a good standard brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle purchased as part of a mixed 12pk at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a clear dark-copper brown with pretty much no lasting head to speak of. Coffee, dark chocolate, and caramel comprise the aroma. Dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, and a strong herbal hop presence. Medium-bodied with low carbonation. Not bad. Reminds me a lot of some of the older craft beers and of the brown ales I used to drink when I lived in Maine years ago. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fair to good beer, just not as multi-dimensional as I like in my brews. However the semi-low- ABV and easy drinking might make it a good choice for a dinner party or cookout. I might throw one in a mix-n-match 6-pack from time to time."
""
"Overall - This is a decent beer, and a decent brown ale. Its smooth enough to be drank by the handfuls but the aftertastes keeps me rating this one low"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a brown color with an off-white head. The aroma has some caramel and toffee malt, as well as some pine from the hops. The flavor is more of the same. I get some nice roasted malt and caramel notes up front, with a decent amount of bitterness and some piney hop notes also coming through. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""

"This may be the best brown ale I've ever had. It leaves me licking my lips and wanting more. It's a little too heavy for a session beer, but definately an outstanding beer. This is my first Brooklyn brand beer and I look forward to trying more."
""
""
"It's an all right beer, but not one of my favorites from Brooklyn at all."
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer, I'm usually not a brooklyn fan but this was quite the brown ale."
""
""
"This is a decent, easy drinking, well balanced brown ale. I like the heavy roasted malt notes throughout. All around refreshing and enjoyable."
""
"Overall not something I would buy again but a better than average brown ale."
"Elite brown ale. One of the best. 4.5"

"Tastes of burnt toffee, caramel malt sweetness, with light astingency. Finishes dry with slight coffee hints"
"Quite enjoyable."

"Poured from a bottle and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, slightly translucent ruby-brown coloring with a short stacked, off-white, light head that quickly settles down into a filmy coating with a ring of bubbling around the edge of the surface. Aromas are rich, roasted, and nutty, with a touch of toffee throughout. Smells sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Flavors are blended well and smooth throughout, with a roasted nut backbone that has touches of hazelnut as well chestnut and peanut characters. Sweet buttercream highlights keep all of the flavors playing along together, leading to a light, creamy aftertaste and a quick, clean finish. The increased carbonation and light body keep the beer from becoming cloying or overpowering. Very easy to drink with a very decent flavor profile overall. Tasty."

"D: with most of the examples from the american brown category getting more and more beastly, it is nice to have an example that can deliver flavor without an overbearing body. not a bad ""session"" american brown."

"M/O: Light medium bodied feel, well carbonated. Overall, without the weird twang this would be a great brown ale. If I get a better sample I will re-review, but the bottle was fresh."

"Overall I liked this beer and I thought it was a good example of an American Brown Ale, it had some nice complex aromas and flavors that were more robust then the average American Brown Ale and that made this beer stick out a little and made it memorable. This beer had pretty good drinkability it went down pretty fast and smooth and had enough flavor to hold my attention, I could see drinking two or three of these in a row if I was in the mood for a Brown Ale. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it was really nice, roasty, and complex, I thought it was really well done. What I liked least about this beer was the slight tartness on the finish of this beer, it just seemed out of place, and it was unnecessary. I would buy this beer again if it was available, but since it's not I doubt I will be having it anytime soon. If you like American Brown Ales I for sure recommend giving this beer a try. This was my first beer from Brooklyn Brewery and I have to say that I was impressed and that it made for a pretty good first impression for this brewery and I am interested in trying many more beers from this brewery, there are more then a couple that I have my eye on. Good Job guys this is one solid American Brown Ale."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Nice rich brown tone with an adequate off white head and decent spotting and lacing. Smell is rich malts, chocolate and a hint of carmel. Taste follows the nose and is a straightforward ABA with a little coffee and nice blend of hops and malts. Easy drinking and refreshing. Feel is silky and creamy with good carbonation and medium body. Overall- I'm a big fan of Brooklyn and think they did a good job on their ABA. It's not out of this world, but it is very solid and is a good interpretation of the style. Solid blending of malts and carmel, good feel and I will be hitting a few more of these-"
"O - Really nice character brown ale, hoppier than the usual brown."
"Overall- A pretty solid brown ale with a little more emphasis on the hops than other brown ales, which is just fine IMO. Good effort."

"Comments: Brooklyn Brown Ale is the benchmark for the American brown ale style with good reason. It is a beer that you can enjoy roast malt and American hops characteristics in, yet still have more than one without it being too much."

"Overall a good brown ale from a brewery that I like in general."
"Overall, OK - but won't buy again."
"So this is supposed to be good until July 2012? Really? God only knows how rank it'll be by then. Best rethink your packaging code, Brooklyn Brewery. Oxidized and infected is not a great combo, especially four months before the best-by date."

"Poured from bottle to glass. Decent enough beer, not a personal favorite. Smells particularly sweet, with a strong caramel scent. A clear dark brown appearance with a nice head that gives way to a ring around the beer. A nice taste as well, sweet a first with a very strong bitterness ending with nutty notes. Distinguishable coffee flavors. Overall a decent beer, but I’m not fond of the bitterness and be careful what you eat with it! Anything sweet before or during ruins it."
""
"O - Nice offering from Brooklyn Brewery. Flavor is complex and pleasing. Drinkability is high."
""
""
"A nice one"
""
""
""
"The taste right of the the bottle is crisp, malty-sweet, with a bit of nuttiness. However, as the brew warms up it loses some of its sweetness, and becomes a little more bitter. Goes down a little dry, and would make a nice pairing with a meat dish."
""
""
""
"O: Solid, but unexceptional, brown ale. Bit on the sweeter side then standard, IMO, but it's a nice session beer."
""
""
"O - This was a nice surprise...Brown Ales are hit or miss for me and this one was a hit...nicely balanced with chocolate, toffee, and a nuttiness leading the way"

"A good beer, but needs the hoppiness to be a true US brown ale. I'm guessing faded as it has just 4 months left on the Best Before and is a legitimate import."

"What an excellent brown ale! Poured a wonderful deep brown with great head and good lacing throughout. A wonderful deep and dark malty aroma, with wonderful woodiness and roastiness. It's a great ent-draught flavor, with a deep dark malty tone and wonderful slight earthy finish. Goes down deep and thick, quite wonderful indeed!"
""
""
""
"This beer pours with minimal just off white head that recedes to a thin film. No lacing. Dark brown, but definitely not stout black. A bit of light can still get through. Aroma is a bit nutty, mildly roasty, but mostly fruity from the yeast. Flavor is similar, but the fruityness is a bit more subdued and there is some earthy hop flavor. Nicely nutty with some nice mild caramel. Definitely tastes more English than American to me. Mouthfeel is good and smooth. About medium with low carbonation. Very nice. I definitely think this beer is much more English, and I like that a lot. Enjoyable beer."

"O - This is a very nice brown ale. More hop bite than most of this style."
"O - A pleasant and interesting beer. More sour and tart than I want from a brown ale, but still good. The tartness is just so surprising and unexpected. It's sort of a novelty. I could see myself ordering it now and then if it were on tap at my local, just for the peculiar and distinctive experience of it."
""
""
"Poured a 2"" velvet foam beige head with pretty good retention. The boday is a dark burnt umber brown but held the light its a transparent rich amber. Both the smell and the taste are a nice roasted malt. Body is fairly light. I'm not really getting any sort of hops or bitterness from it. To me this is a fairly typical brown, middle of the pack."
"Pours a dark copper hue which leaves a two finger head and nice lacing,the smell is sherry,dark fruits and chocolate,the mouthfeel is just under medium bodied and very sessionable with tastes of chocolate coated cherries,caramel,dark berries and finished with a nice expresso finish and overall its nice and very sessionable without being great cheers."

"O-if this was available around here it could be a regular in my fridge"
"The appearance of this beer is a nice dark brown with red/mahogany highlights. The head was big and lingered slightly for a long time. The smell is sweet caramel and toasted grains, but very mild (although the beer is a little colder than I would like it to be.) The taste is syrupy sweet with an accent of hop flavor and bitterness in the middle and then blends into a smooth mocha finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied. This is a pretty good brown ale, but I think the flavor either needs more malt flavor and backbone or a bigger hop profile. It is seated right in between and while it is good, it is not amazing."

"Brooklyn Brown pours a brown chestnut, amber hues. There's just a thin cream colored head, retention doesn't hold very well. There's an aroma of toasted bread and chestnut, leaning towards more nuttiness. The flavor is a bit more powerful, and adds a healthy swirl of caramel to the nutty notes that carry over from the nose. Almost chocolate-y. There's a sweet, cream edge to it, adding definition and form. Lightly carbonated, but is enough to keep the beer from turning syrupy. Better than most browns I've had, but it does represent more of an amber than a brown ale. Definitely can drink this several times."

"O/D: The taste to abv ratio is just right. Nothing overpowering, but a beer to grab a sixer of, instead of just one."
"Overall, a decent, solid brown ale"
"Definitely one of the better brown ales I have had. Worth a try."
"Body seems a little light on, carbonation a bit high."
"Drinkability: Wow. Really tasty and complex. Too bad I cannot get this locally."
"Overall a great brown ale from the first NYC Company to use 100% wind powered electricity."
"Overall: The color is appealing, the smell makes you want to drink it but the flavor lets you down. That said its a decent brown ale but i've had better."
"O-Overall it is a solid beer but it is just to flat. A little bit more carbonation would have been superb."
"O/D-A good drinking brown ale. A bit too bland for me but there is nothing wrong or off about the flavor here. The light body allows for a six-pack to go back easily I'd imagine."
"Deep brown color in glass, reddish glow when held up to a light. Tan, frothy head laces the glass nicely. Aroma is roasty malt with a hint of coffee. Taste is a bit bitter at first, followed by dry, watered down malty finish. I don’t really taste any noticeable hop notes. Mouthfeel is smooth... this beer appears and pours like it might have a bit of viscosity to it, but doesn’t deliver. It’s ok...not great."
"Pours mahogany in color, clear with a brown head. Aroma has low hops and mostly consists of roasted, nutty, slightly burned notes. Taste has dryness of roasted malts (a bit bitter too). Not too much, but enough to counter malty sweetness. Actually, somewhat refreshing (I think those are the hops coming through). Very pleasant aftertaste (drying bitterness lingers a bit). Medium body. Low carbonation. A bit sweet on the lips. Suddenly I want to reach out for vanilla ice cream. A solid brew."
"D"
"O - A beer full of flavors. Nice beer, well balanced ingredients! Almost perfect to pair with anything."
"Had in tap at J&R steakhouse. Pretty unusuming brown. Loojed solid with great head and lacing. Thick and foamy. Smell and taste were a nalt bomb with some brown sugar. Mouth was good and somewhat standard. Overall a bit watery. Nice example for the style but by no means a standout. Pretty unassuming and somewhat standard or safe for the style."
"O - A nice ale and a good choice as a fall seasonal to mix up with Marzen"
"Brooklyn Brown pours a solid brown chestnut, with plentiful clear amber highlights shining through. There's just a thin cream colored head, not even enough foam to really allow for much head retention or lacing. The nose is just a little bit weak, but there's still the aroma of toasted bread/biscuits, as well as a distinct nuttiness. The flavor is a bit more powerful, and adds a healthy swirl of caramel to the nutty and bready notes that carry over from the nose. A little bit more roast in the form of chocolate or coffee notes would have really topped things off nicely. The body is appropriately sturdy for an average sized brown ale, with a nice creamy edge to it. Carbonation is barely there, but it is enough to keep the beer from turning syrupy. It almost tastes a bit like a dark amber than a brown ale (splitting hairs, I know), but this cask offering of Brooklyn Brown Ale was solid."
"Poured this American Brown Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The brown ale poured a nice mahogany color, produced a decent tan head, poor head retention and left an ample amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of sweet roasted malt, chocolate and caramel. The ale is medium in body, smooth, sweet nutty, caramel, chocolate, coffee, and piney hops. Very nice session beer, finishes dry, wouldn't hesitate seeking this one out. Shot out to my boy the ""Reale Deal"" for hooking me up with this fine specimen."
"Brown/red color with only a small amount of tan head. Roasted molasses in the nose but not much else. Flavor is a light roasted malt with some caramel sweetness finishing it off. No real hop notes just a light, crisp, body with small amounts of roasted, caramel sweetness. Decently drinkable."
"The Brooklyn Brown Ale pours out a cola-colored brew, which reveals a nice ruby color when held up to the light. There is a fair amount of rising carbonation bubbles which support a very soft and foamy tan head. Large amounts of lacing. The aroma is pretty big, chocolate malt with a touch of spiciness and some roast. The taste starts off with that brown ale malt taste which doesn't exactly send me to the moon. There are some nice chocolate malts, some toffee, fair amount of nuttiness, just a touch of hops. The mouth is pretty thin."
"O: I didn't really enjoy the taste of this brown ale. Overall, it was okay. Kind of comparable to New Castle? Not one of my favorites."
"O: Pretty good drinkability. Nothing special, but still very well made."
"Overall: This is fairly drinkable and the sweetness is just right. At the same time, it captures the brown ale taste."
"Draught @ Headkeeper: This one pours a fairly clear, darker brown color. There was only a wisp of a tan head on mine and it left no lacing. Nice nose. Mainly caramel malts, with a hint of chocolate and plum. The taste is very good. Caramel malts, a hint of fruit (plum?), with a faint sweetness. Nice."
"Brooklyn Brown Ale is an enjoyable American Brown Ale."
"O - This is actually one of the more flavourful Brooklyn ales I've had to date. If it were a bit sweeter, rather than bitter, it would've taken it up a notch on the ratings. Easy drinking brown ale."
"From a 12oz bottle. Pours a hazy dark chestnut with a large, fizzy beige head. Overly sweet aroma, with brown sugar, malt, some caramel. Flavor is better, as the sweet quality is rounded out slightly by a little bit a dry finish. Slightly roasty, nutty, pretty nice."
"Not my brown ale, but maybe yours!"
"O: Very good brown ale that I'd have again. I think it'll shine in cooler weather, but don't let the summer sun stop you from having one."
"Reviewed from notes; Smell of malt from bottle poured into pint glass. Dark brown color w/quickly dissipating head. Malty flavor w/a nice full mouthfeel and a clean nutty, coffee like finish. Among the recent ABA's I've had Bell's, Smuttynose, and this I think I'd grab this as a sixer over the other 2..."
"O: Browns aren't something I intentionally seek out but I'm really happy I got a chance to try this. Not a perfect beer but one with some very interesting characteristics. Brooklyn Brewery got another notch of respect from me for this striking brew."
"O: Fairly impressed with this brown ale. Has more of the taste profile of a porter instead of a brown ale."
"The taste follows the smell, with roasted malt and a touch of nuttiness. I get just a touch of chocolate on the back end. This beer is almost a porter, which isn't a bad thing. But because it reminds me of a porter, the mouthfeel comes up a touch light. I think I'd like a touch more viscosity in this brew. Nonetheless, this is a solid offering by Brooklyn."
"As for whether I LIKED this beer ... I did. The flavors are well balanced and very tasty. My only personal criticism is that I did not find them to be very strong, so I found myself wanting more intense taste. This problem might be solved if I drank it at a temperature about ten degrees warmer, so I will have to review it again at that temperature and see. But overall this is a good beer that I will not turn down unless a nut brown with stronger tones were available. But this beer is an enjoyable, high quality brew. I've come to expect this from a solid, respectable brewer like Brooklyn. I would recommend trying this beer if you're trying the style out for the first time or if you don't want to be overwhelmed by the taste of your beer."
"BROWN ALE FROM BROOKLYN YES PLEASE"
"Brooklyn Brown Ale gets a thumbs up, and in a style that usually doesn't even get a thumb from me."
"Overall it's a little sweet, and the dark fruit flavor of it reminds of some sort of weird Dubbel/Brown Ale cross or something. It's not particularly malty or roasty either, but it's easy drinking and can do in a pinch."
"Tap was an attractive pour of translucent brown liquid with a cap of off-white foam that left a bit of lacing. Smell was subtle hop and nutty malt. Taste was a bit more hop forward than what I think of a typical nut brown ale. Interesting. Easy to drink, but not an impressively tasty brown ale."
"Brooklyn brewery keeps impressing me with their smooth and inexpensive beers."
"Descent carbonation and smooth enough."
"Overall Drinkability - Started off strong, and went crashing down hill after the 2nd sip. Would not have again."
"All in all, not a bad brown ale, good flavors and smell, and easy enough to drink a couple. Nothing groundbreaking though. Still worth a try."
"Overall I really like this beer. It's well-balanced and easy to drink. It's a good example of an American Brown Ale. As long as I live in the area it will continue to be one of my go to beers when the whether is cool or I want a good brown."
"O: This is tasty and semi-robust and a gem amongst Brooklyn's mediocre stable of brews."
"Brooklyn Brewery's Brown Ale pours root beer brown, with a thick, two-fingered head that dissipates quickly and leaves behind only spotty lacing. The beer's smell is very mild, with really only roasted malts and a certain sweetness evident. The taste follows the nose, and Brown Ale is full of roasted malts, followed by some caramel and chocolate notes, and the beer finishes with a certain dry hoppiness. This is a very straightforward brown ale -- not my favorite, but I wouldn't turn it down, either."
"I think the brewers tried to liven up this style a bit by trying to give it some porter-like characteristics. I'm not sure they were successful. This brown ale is very good, but a little too thin and bitter to be great."
"A nice example of the style."
"I'm a fan. A great post mt. bike/hike/camping session beer."
"This is quite good-one of my favorite American brown ales. I would personally like some more hop character, as I feel that this is what distinguishes American from British browns, and I think it might give the beer even greater versatility with food, but that is a minor gripe. Smells great, tastes great, and pairs well with a wide variety of foods. Need I say more?"
"D- 3.5 All in all, this is a fairly drinkable ale. It has a great look and a balanced flavor. It lacks a ""wow"" factor but is solid enough that I could put several down with ease. Worth trying if you're a fan of browns; there's much worse out there."
"O- a tasty brown i like the citrus and fruit notes in this one with chocolate and toffee..its good will visit this one often"
"O: I like this one. It has some of the dark, roasty characteristics you'd find in a porter without being too heavy to drink a few of. I like the hint of nuttiness in the aftertaste as well."
"Mediocre at best, as mostly every brown ale I've ever tried. Poured mahogany with quickly receding whitish head. Mostly malty nose. Taste is thin, nutty and malty, watery, with a bit of sweetness. Light mouthfeel, and not very drinkable...just not my style."
"O - mostly recommended for its fine aroma and rich malty flavor."
"Overall: Nice, everyday Brown Ale with a little more hops than I expected. My only gripe is the slightly thin mouthfeel. After having four of their beers, Brooklyn clearly knows how to elevate traditional beers and make them better."
"Back in Johnstown, Pennsylvania AGAIN...for business. Had dinner at the Boulevard restaurant...AGAIN. This night they had the Brooklyn's Brown Ale....ON TAP! The color was a deep rich brown amber with white head that laced well. The nose had a hint of brown sugar or molassis. The taste was a little sharp, but decent. Certainly had rich malt subtle sweetness. The mouthfeel was good thank to the light ABV. This beer is worth a taste and definitely a SESSION!!!"
"Poured a dark brown/mahogany with some chestnut highlights. Transient offwhite head head fades to a thin film, some lace. Nose is hoppy, some chocolate and roasted notes. Taste has some good hop flavour. Roasted and mild nutty notes, again a touch of chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium low, borders on thin at trimes. Residual chocolate and nuttiness in the finish. Decent drinkability. Hoppy brown ale, but leaves me desiring more out of this."
"Even though I have had this a hundred times , a first for rating it so here goes!"
"This beer pours a brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly nice lacing. The aroma is of toffee, roasted malt, and hints of chocolate and citrus. The taste is considerably hoppier than the aroma. It is full of citrus with the roasted malt and toffee backing up the hops. Bitterness is moderate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a really nice beer. I am usually not a fan of hoppy brown ales, but this one works for me. I like how the hop presence is mostly in the flavor while the bitterness is still relatively mild. I will certainly drink this beer again."
"O - A typical brown ale that is pretty enjoyable."
"Overall: pretty good and much better than I remember it being. I remember it being quite bland. Maybe I had a stale bottle or something like that, but on draught it was pretty good. I recommend it if browns are your thing. Cheers!"
"D A good beer, good brown, nothing stands out. 3.5"
"Overall: A tasty version of a brown ale with a nice mix of malts, nuts and hops."
"Overall a very flavorful and easy to drink beer. I remember it being a little hoppier the first time I had it about 2-3 years ago. I like the malt bill on this beer not being too sweet and with just the right amount of roastiness for the style."
"Overall I'd say this is a decent representation of a brown ale. the flavors could use a little tweaking though. good but nothing special. the dryness makes this a bit harder to drink."
"Finishes with malt taste but not a ton of body. Great for craft. Easy to drink more of."
"Overall I think this is a good beer. They're better browns out there but I would still rank this in my top 5 favorite brown ales."
"Bought a bottle of this when I was in New York City and slipped it in my suitcase. The beer poured a pretty brown as described with a highly carbonated head that dwindled away quite rapidly. Overall the beer lacked taste and mouthfeel. It was missing the thicker body and taste I have come to love in brown beers. I had not had this beer for a couple of years and now I remember why. Better to me than a Budweiser but rather low in the pecking order of brown ales."
"O - I may have to rewrite this, but not a great experience with this Ale, I have heard great things about Brooklyn brewery, so I will be trying more from them."
"O - A nice session beer with a nice flavor."
"O - A decent brown ale but pretty one dimensional in its scent and flavor respectively. Still worth a shot."
"A nice dark brown ale with frothy head that fades fast and leaves spiderweb lace. The smell is of roasted malt, caramels, and a hint of cocoa. The taste follows the nose. Almost a porter taste. Lots of roasted malts, caramels, toffee and a hint of cocoa and coffee. Medium bodied though slightly watery and chalky. Very easy drinking."
"Pours a nice brown color with a very small amount of head. Does leave a bit of lacing on the glass. Get a lot of caramel and roasted malts in the smell. The caramel malts dominate the taste and hints of hazelnut and walnut. The beer didn't have as much body as I would have liked- seemed a bit watery. Easy to drink and enjoyed it with a good sandwich for dinner."
"Looks like Brooklyn Brews are invading these parts of Michigan. Living here in Michigan our local brews are some of the best on, earth full of flavor. It seems when the new guy comes to town they seem to have less flavor or a bit water down. But this beer was new on tap and the establishment was promoting it or just trying to get it off the tap. Look all right for a brown ale. Tones of caramel, coffee and nut so that is good. Nice clean taste like it smells Very drinkable beer. Not bad for $2.50 a 22 oz. glass."
"This beer has a little more carbonation than I really like, and is on the thin side."
"Overall a really tasty Brown Ale with a slightly sweet bold middle and nice light malty, hoppy finish."
"D - Easy drinking, refreshing enough, seems to pair well with lunch."
"Lacks complexity, needs more hop character."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, but has a nice dryness."
"Definitely wasn't a bad beer at all but I personally probably wouldn't seek it out again."
"Pours a clean deep amber to brown-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a small caramel roast. In the taste, sticky sweet caramel and a small roasted malt. A small bite and light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry sticky caramel in the aftertaste. Not much nose and mellow, a good stand by."
"This beer is my go to. It has a great taste and is easy to get anywhere for the reasonable price. I have had this on draught as well and its even better. If you are an ale fan this is one to try or retry. I would like to try and make my own personal brew similar to this one."
"Overall impression is that of an English brown ale due to the minerally finish and dryness."
"Brooklyn Brown pours dark amber with 1 1/2 fingers of foamy head. I don't pick up on a lot of smell, and the flavor is pretty hollow as well. It has some nice toasty after tastes that identifies it as a dark ale, but nothing to go crazy about. It has a nice overall mild taste, but again, this is not something that I would seek out. It is medium bodied and drinkable, but I don't see myself have more than one of these in a row."
" Quite drinkable."
"Good flavor beer, very enjoyable mix of tastes in a good balance. I would come back for another one, but after a meal as a dessert beer."
"Quite well balanced, and not too sweet - that's nice. Enjoyed at Grill's in Stockholm."
"Best before May 2011. Pours deep, dark brown with medium off-white to tan head. Good head retention and some lacing. Malty aroma, raisin and dark fruit notes. No hops detectable. A hint of ethanol in the background. Caramel flavor with a touch of roasted malts. Slight sweetness and fruitiness - raisin and cherry. Somewhat astringent. Thin mouthfeel, watery, not overly sweet but no bitterness either. It's an decent beer, good with food but not one to savor on its own."
"Just a typical Brown Ale, nothing really spectacular."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. I'd get another, but not session it. Its easy to drink because it isn't heavy and doesn't accost my tastebuds. After taste leaves me wanting another sip. Something to enjoy in colder weather."
"I really like this one. Had several great tastes and good drinkability. I will be getting more."
"A nice brown ale, not the best i've had but it's still very drinkable."
"This beer is just further proof that Garrett Oliver and his boys know a thing or two about brewing, and I'm surprised this doesn't get more love."
"D: A decent brown ale."
"Dark Mahogany as the label suggests. Head didn't stick around to long. Smells like a porter - lots of coffee. Tastes like a very weak porter with not much after taste. Its not bad, but its not fantastic either Mouthfeel is quite watery and lacks carbonation. Drinkability is good only in that it would not be too filling if you were having a couple of these. I probably won't seek it out again."
"DB- A nice roast malt and cocoa flavor support what I usually get out of a Brown Ale. Flavorful and rich, I wouldn't drink a ton of these but it's a nice beer for sure."
"D - i really like when brewers try to add a hop character to a brown ale, and this is a nice example of when it works, along with the light chocolate and licorice/cola like flavours it is balanced and complex enough to keep me interested"
"Poured dark, mahogany brown with good clarity and a healthy off-white head. Good head retention. Reduces to a healthy cap for the duration with ample wet lacings. Chocolate and nutty aromas with hints of coffee and molasses. Medium bodied with a smooth buttery feel and pleasant carbonation. Sweet chocolate and molasses flavors dominate with nutty and coffee hints in the background. Builds to a brief hoppy middle that quickly tapers to a dry, clean finish. Very drinkable. This would pair very well with spicy food."
"D - Drinkability is good. This is a very easy going beer, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It went down easy and it has good flavor. I really like the big nutty flavor it has. I think this is a pretty good brown ale, and I think it's worth trying for sure."
"Has a medium mouthfeel and a decent drinkibility. This is a solid brown ale and the first of the Brooklyn Brews I have tried. Def impressed."
"Nice looking brown ale, with amber edging and good clarity. Full cream colored head with a hard pour. Smells quite sweet with alot of caramel and brown sugar. Just a bit of roasted malt and coffee scent to balance out the nose. Also noticed a bit of a metallic note. Taste is alot more balanced, with the roasted flavors coming through. Even a little dark chocolate and some earthy hop flavor, balancing out the caramel and molasses. The metallic element is a little more evident in the palate. It's not harsh, but not pleasant either. Mouthfeel is creamy on the tongue with a mildly dry finsh. A likeable and drinkable brew from Brooklyn."
"I don't know, the Brooklyn Brewery has been slipping for me lately. The IPA wasn't too hot, and this one is a disappointment, too. Color is good, brown/amber, average head and very little lacing. Smells of raisins, prunes, black tea. There is an odd balance with funky lemon/bitter hoppiness blended with roasted malt, and stale prunes (if that's possible). It just doesn't quite work. Dry, metallic, sour, a bit watery. Tastes mostly like over-steeped tea. Mouthfeel is average to thin. Brooklyn Lager does the job, but these other offerings are usually dicey, this being no exception."
"Overall: See drinkability."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle to a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Deep brownish red appearance with a big white head that disappears in no time. Not much going on in the smell department for me, very faint malty scent if any at all. The taste however is much better, sweet chocolatey, caramel on the tongue almost a bit fizzy going down the hatch. The beer is definitely drinkable for one or two."
"Drink - I enjoyed this beer much more on draft than from the bottle. It found it had more of a harsh bitter aftertaste from the bottle. Still a decent beer however."
"Exeptional for an American beer, definately one of my new favorites. Try it."
"Very solid brown ale staying true to the style.. no gimmicks. Recommended."
"I didn't love this one - it seemed to have a rather unpleasant flavour. It would perhaps benefit from a greater addition of hops to the recipe to balance out the malt, which seemed overly sweet. A pity, as I've enjoyed the other beers I've tried from this brewery."
"12 oz bottle. Pours mahogany with long lasting off-white head. Aroma of sweet malts, bread and brown sugar. Light to medium body. Flavor of earthy hops that are balanced by sweet fruity malt. Some coffee and citrusy notes are in the background. Finish is long well balanced and pleasant. One of my favorite browns"
"taste is classic Brooklyn malty threw and threw starts with a sweet buttery mouth and carbonation builds. The taste mellows out with crystal malt and caramel finish. the finish is smooth."
"D: I enjoy a nice variation on the typical brown ale style and this beer doesn't disappoint. Not what one would normally expect from the style but pleased overall. Will purchase again."
"D: As I said, different than other browns, but still very drinkable."
"Nice body on this American brown. Smooth despite relatively high carbonation. Great winter drinker, and I'm sure any other season as well."
"The flavor is roast-like without being harsh or grating in the least bit. The mellow malt sweetness really comes up under the roast flavor and the chocolate provides a bit of bitterness as well as complexity to this malty goodness. A kind of sharp breadiness comes in towards the end as well. Overall a very nice drinking brown with subtle complexity and all proper flavors present. Drinkable and thought provoking for Brown ale."
"drinkability: definitely a strong example of a brown ale, could come off as too heavy for some, but its not overpowering."
"D - Drinks easy, but nothing impressive about it. I'd buy it again as a fairly sessionable brown ale."
"If you're in the mood for a brown, this is a good one. :-)"
"Poured into a tumbler. Nice brown ale with a nice brown body. Wan head that reduces to a thin foam layer that laces well. Smells of nice malts with a notable good hop aroma, the taste follows consistent with a bit of warming alcohol taste. Crisp in carbonation moderate body. Nice passable brown ale."
"D: I know a lot of ABAs that taste better and are easier to drink."
"Poured into a pint beer glass. The beer was a nice dark brown with an off white 1 finger head that did not last very long. Lacing was good on the side of the glass. The beer had a carmel nutty smell. The taste was nutty with a carmel hint, sort of coated the mouth, and leaving a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was medium, and drinkability was not real good as it did not leave me wanting another. Thought it would be great with a burger, my burger was late coming out and was eating fried cheese with this brew, and that is not the food you want to go with this beer as the cheese brought out the alcohal taste to the max..."
"A decent lager. It goes down easy."
"A less than stellar pour by the bartender, so the head wasn't exactly all it could have been. Quite thin in this case. Color is a nice dark brown. Smells of malt and roast. A good brew with lots of malty and roasted flavors to it--some chocolate, some coffee. Slight hop aroma for balance, but it didn't really come off in the taste. Mouthfeel was smooth with a wet finish. Easy to drink for a Brown Ale as well, which is nice if unusual."
"Overall pretty good, I am not big into browns, but this one is pretty good."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty decent brew. I wouldn't turn it down. Good session brew for the Fall season. Not quite as warming as I was hoping, but not bad. The smell was the best aspect with the evidence of the dark chocolate."
"O - It's a good beer. There's nothing really wrong with it other than the fact that there seems to be something lacking. Maybe a lingering aftertaste? I want to like this beer a lot more, but there's a watered down factor to the taste."
"Very drinkable -- could almost be a session beer."
"Update: Had a draft version on 5/13/11. A tad bolder than the bottle version - good nutty malts and earthy hops in the nose and taste."
"Drinkability- extremely easy drinking, had it both on tap this week and in bottle after being impressed and both were very good maybe tap was slightly better but could just been atmosphere cuz both times was quite tasty, beautiful balance and very rich easy drinking brown ale, one of the best i have had of the style, enjoyable and will seek out many more times, had it once about 3 years ago when just trying new beers and my appreciation for its is far great now then it had been at the time"
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - Good, this could easily make a session brown ale. Goes down smoothly, since neither the flavour nor the body is too strong."
"Drink well my friends"
"D I liked this one a lot. I. Could session on this one all night."
"D: I'm just bored. There's no real subtlety, here. This beer lacks the creamy feel and nutty flavor of better brown ales, but it's also entirely inoffensive. It's not hard to drink in any way, and this review sounds more negative than I actually feel. This is an okay beer."
"D: not too sweet and not too heavy, the carbonation is a little much but it is very suitable for an autumn beer"
"Chestnutty cola brown, with a pretty lame head. The aroma is delightfully cocoa-forward, nutty as hell, and really heady with caramel, like a flan. A bit of hops - just a bit - add a sorta-floral, kinda-herbal, ever so slightly soapy aroma like lavender or lemon thyme. Thin on the palate and perhaps unnecessarily well-attenuated, with vivacious carbonation and a crisp, dry finish that almost comes across as harsh. It does no favors to the flavors, which are all toffee and walnut and resin and mocha and require a bit more viscosity and a little less fizz to really express themselves. This is like a really good version of Newkie Brown, or a middling version of Sam Smith's Nut Brown."
"D: Easy drinker. More refreshing than I expected. A good representation of this style."
"Nothing really impressive to me about this. Not bad, but not something I would seek out or buy again."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a true brown in color and has a soapy, creamy-white head. The nose is nutty; caramel, toffee, chocolate and coffee all come to mind also. Hops are there too but not strong enough to lend a definite smell. The taste is more of the same, nice rich malty backdrop composed of the aforementioned flavors, slight acrid bitterness and more perceived hop bitterness but not a whole lot more hop flavor. The mouthfeel is medium to full in body, the carbonation is thin but enhances the feel. Overall, a drinkable beer, good but not overly remarkable. This could definitely be a regular drinking beer on a Friday night."
"I'm not normally a big fan of Brown Ales and interestingly enough when I bought the Brooklyn Mixer pack that this came in I also bought the new Sierra Nevada Tumbler(Autumn Seasonal that replaced the Anniversary Ale). The Brooklyn was head and shoulders above the SN(which breaks my heart cause I'm a huge SN fan). This brown ale may have changed my view on browns...I will def seek them out more now."
"Color: reddish-brown, medium translucency. Beige foam. Aroma of roasted malt, caramel, nuts and citric hops. The flavor follows the aroma with sweetness and bitterness. Mild carbonation. Hop balanced beer. Dry and bitter end. Very easy to drink! Fine beer!"
"Drinkability: this is just a classic realization of a brown ale. I rather enjoy it and am finding this a pleasing drinking experience; I'd definitely get it again."
"This isn't a bad sipping beer, but the generally weak flavor and thin mouthfeel don't make for the most enjoyable session. Though certainly glad I checked it out, I probably won't seek this one out again; it's a little to mild across the board for me to get too into."
"I've enjoyed this beer for many years. Used to be my favorite brown - the ""house"" beer at my home. Having come across better browns since, I still regard this as a great, inexpensive go-to."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink, which makes it very sessionable."
"D - A great American Brown Ale. It goes down easy and has some great layers to the flavor."
"Notes: A great American brown ale. I have been reading a business book by Steve Hindy and Tom Potter, the co-founders/owners of Brooklyn Brewery. It is a great read, extremely informative, and inspiring; especially to someone starting a brewery like myself. I grabbed a 6 pack to drink as I finished the book off."
"D - A well crafted brew, with quite a bit going on. A appreciate the moderate ABV and depth of flavor achieved. I got two in a variety pack, and will happily drink both. I may have a new favorite Brown Ale."
"Poured a mahogany brown into a pint glass, with less than a finger of sepia-colored head, modest retention, and good lacing. The nose consisted of caramel, hazelnut, milk chocolate, and coffee, with a hint of herbal hops as well. Definitely a sweet, nutty, malty balance throughout, with a hoppier than expected essence as well. While some may find fault with the latter, I think it actually worked nicely; especially in mixing with the sweet finish. The feel was a little on the thin side for a brown ale, and also a little over-carbonated. That being said, it made for a highly sessionable beer. I found this beer overall to be a pleasant surprise."
"D: Not bad not good but average."
"D: This is a solid example of a brown ale. Don't look for any bells and whistles, just expect another classic example from a brewery who's year-round offerings are consistently true to style."
"Drinkability: A pleasant, sweeter brew. Not the best or most complex (even as far as malts are concerned), but still a solid, enjoyable beer. Very sessionable and something I wouldn't mind having again."
"d - A nice brown ale. Some nice roasted malts and chocolate in the smell and taste. Would have again"
"Pours a darkish brown color with a one finger head. The aroma is faint and of caramel malt along with a slight dark fruit. The taste is of a caramel malt and roasted malt backbone with some nuttiness to it. In the middle there is a slight dark fruit character and it finishes with a slight citrus hop bite. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and slightly creamy. The drinkability is good, a very smooth and easy drink. The nose was a little disappointing but the flavor really comes through to make you want another."
"D- Overall this is a solid beer, a simple, yet well done brown. To some degree I feel like the malt and hop flavors didn't quite mesh together right for me, but it was still a solid beer."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"Overall, nothins special, easy to drink but doesn't bring much to the table. I would drink hammered but that's about it."
"D. Brilliant American version of an English brown ale. This has a really good complexity for a beer of only 5.6%ABV. Really nice to drink on a regular basis."
"This beer had it's weaknesses but I liked the flavors and it's easy to drink. I wouldn't mind getting it again."
"This is one smooth drinking beer, but it does not do much for the senses."
"And I could have sat there all evening drinking it without feeling bloated . . . ."
"Overall, I really love this beer. American Browns either tend to be too out of balance (either too sweet, or too hoppy). This one is perfect. I could drink this all the time with a nice piece of grilled meat. Never had a beer that had such a long and distinct finish. Wonderful!"
"This was actually pretty drinkable, especially for a low ABV beer."
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Had this one once in a bottle a while ago, and was underwhelmed, so I was hoping a draft sample would prove to be better. As before, though, I found this to be too basic, and somewhat bland. I don't get any of the coffee, chocolate, or hop elements described in the literature for this beer either in the bottle or on draft."
"overall i would have this again, but its just a decent brewed beer."
"D: High. Refreshing beer. Good quality beer as expected from a Brooklyn"
"Overall, a moderate beer. Nothing too great or too lousy. Relatively inexpensive, which is reflected by its qualities. I would say in terms of brown ales this one is about on par or a half-step below New Castle Brown Ale."
"D: Paired nicely with a broiled shell steak at the recommendation of the Brooklyn Brewery head honcho..."
"This is one of the better Brown Ales I've had, although it isn't one of my favorite styles..."
"darkish brown color with a reddish hint to it. Small head, not much lacing. The smell is of a lot of caramel, malt, and bready grain. The taste is caramel, caramel, caramel with noticeable brown sugar as it goes down. Way too sweet for me. Average mouthfeel and too sweet to be very drinkable."
"Overall: Overall the beer was decent. Too much alcohol hits you up front, but the lingering flavors are very enjoyable. For $1 it was a good tasty bargain."
"d- while this isn't the best brown ever. it is one that I could drink I 6pk of with ease. a very easy drinking beer with soft inviting flavors."
"M- Smooth and semi full body."
"Still, highly drinkable, paired well with grilled meat."
"Notes: This beer had promise, but it didn't live up to what I was expecting. The hops in the flavor need to be more like the aroma. It should be a malt dominated beer, which it is, but the hops need to be better. The malt that is there in the flavor make up for the hops though. If they were more in line, the score would go up."
"d-smooth bitter after taste"
"drinks easy like a black lager and taste very moderate. not too light and certainly not too heavy. taste has a nice sweetness . hints of coffee to it yet with the clarity of a lager."
"nice chocolaty color and smell. Someone said it's nice for someone who wants something darker than Newcastle but not a porter or stout, this is a good choice. I'd agree with this. It's much hoppier than I expected. I tend to drink these types of beer when I want something nutty or a little caramel-like so the hoppiness is a surprise. It's pretty good but not great. I won't seek it out but I'd be willing to try it on tap."
"D- Its not a bad beer. The hops might be a little much for people who buy it for the color, but overall, its enjoyable. Wouldn't be my first choice for a brown though."
"This beer is a dark brown, with a creamy tan head. Smell is of milk chocolate. Taste has a lot of dextriny sweetness up front, mild chocolate middle, and a hint of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, low carbonation. Excellent drinkability, the mild flavors and low carbonation make this a fine beer if you are having more than one."
"D: Nice flavor, some hops presence and 5.6% alcohol make this a nice session beer. Goes very well with pizza!"
"D - A nice after-work beer; I would recommend giving this a try if you want something a little darker than a New Castle, but not willing to take the leap to a stout."
"Where's the hops? Not punched up like I'd expect, and too many sour notes. Brooklyn can do better."
"Definitely an English-style brown ale, better than but similar to Newcastle. Not as much of a roasted nut, brown sugar, coffee and chocolate flavor as in many brown ales. A good beer, but not fantastic. wouldn't turn one down, but wouldn't seek it out, either."
"Pours a very dark, slightly reddish brown with a small slightly tan head which quickly dissipates. Aroma is nutty, chocolaty, malty and herbal with a fairly prominent British hop character. The taste is similar to the aroma and somewhat surprising. I guess I was anticipating more malty and roasty character, but this beer has quite a lot of grassy, herbal and slightly lemon hop flavor. Malt is definitely there, but it is not the star of the show, more of a supporting cast with its malty, slightly roasty and brown sugar notes. They flavors definitely go together, but it seems somewhat blah overall. Mouthfeel is medium with a subdued, yet prickly carbonation and a finish that is slightly dry but with a lingering sweetness. Quite drinkable but, I would want another one about as much as I would want a second date with a plain, boring woman."
"d - yeah it's sessionable, but not a beer that i would seek out. it's worth a try if you come across it, but i probably won't revisit this one."
"Will not be purchasing again, but I never turn down trying something from Brooklyn."
"I enjoy this beer a pounder with a little more flavor than usual. Good stuff."
"Overall, this was drinkable and enjoyable. A beer I'd never order if I wasn't doing the beer tour but a nice experience and one I would have again."
"I can't quite figure out what this beers missing, I do like this brew but it could use just a little something"
"I picked up a 1/2 keg the other day hoping to find a Newcastle Clone. This is not a new castle clone but something better. It is not as sweet as Newcastle, but it has a lot more going for it. Its smooth, sweet, roasty, and slightly hoppy. I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"I bought this beer as part of a mixed six at Party Source in Bellevue, KY."
"Had this on tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Burlington. Came out a very dark brown with a thin tan head on top. Decent retention; left nice sticky lace on the glass. Scents of brown sugar cookies, some toffee, and mild hops. The mouth was crisp with a moderate amount of carbonation. Not a lot of roasty flavors in this. Some mild bready flavor and lots of ethanol. For such a low ABV, I can really taste the alcohol on this one. Unpleasant. I didn't really care for this like I thought I would have."
"Not the best brown ale - but it does some things better than the best examples do. I like it."
"Pours deep dark brown with a very dense head. Aroma is roasted but a bit raw, as if the beer needed more time to mellow. Flavor is cherry like, with some wood and dark caramel. The flavor is not deep, though. The Mouthfeel is slick. Not excellent but not bad."
"Drinkability: Despite my scores this is growing on me. I think this is a beer for pairing with a meal (indeed I'm seeing this now) rather than having by itself."
"M/D: Light alcohol and quite medium. Easy drink, without any bitterness, you can have a few more of these he average brown ale."
"D - Not too thick, and something I could easily sit down and drink without feeling bloated. This is a great tasting ale, and I just absolutely love the combination of the coffee and chocolate along with the malts in the background."
"D: The thinness combined with the flavor make this a rather drinkable beer, something I imagine improves with freshness."
"I prefer Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale because it has a thicker feel and more complex flavors. Then again, it is less drinkable."
"Just recently started getting into this style so my review may not be fair. The aroma is malty with a caramel burnt sugar note. The beer has a good body to it and nice finish. I drank this beer immediately from the cooler at the store, so I think the coldness has diluted the flavor. i would feccomend serving at cellar tempature of 55 degrees to get more out of this beer. Overall a decent brown ale that I could drink as a session beer."
"Brooklyn Brown Ale is a nice take on the style. It's a little different, and I'll probably buy this one again."
"D: Not a complex brew but a solid drink. the bitterness is perfect and this is a well balanced beer it is highly drinkable and there are alot of food parings that would work with this one."
"Drinkability: I've had better brown ales, but this one was respectable. A touch more hoppiness and complexity would do this beer wonders."
"Definitely not a crappy beer, but far from Newcastle Brown Ale (to me that's the benchmark brown ale.)"
"All in all, Dogfish Head's Indian Brown is superior in my opinion but it's not a 'straight' brown ale, but rather has spices and other stuff going on. Sam Smith's Brown is still my favorite, but I'm still seeing why I bought that case in Brooklyn several years ago."
"D: I could try it again."
"A fairly typical brown, but on the more flavorful side than others I've had. Overall - as with many brown ales - this is a great session brew."
"Color is impressive, luminous copper and perfectly clear. Dried fruit and some pungent spice on the nose. Pretty light on the front of the palate, leading into the dark, almost roasted, malty taste I was hoping for. Nice bitterness emerges on the finish, but unfortunately it has to contend with an awkward citrusy note as I swallow. I guess this isn't a style I know too well, but I was hoping for something a little more soul-warming than this session quaffer."
"This is another decent but not overly impressive member of Brooklyn year-round lineup."
"Easy drinking, and refreshing."
"D: Quite drinkable, for some reason I hadn't had this Brooklyn offering even though it was one of the first offerings to come to North Texas. Browns are not my favorite brews but if the mood strikes me I wouldn't mind at all having this again."
"M/D: A respectable brown ale. Nothing mind-blowing here. As has been said before, a bit watery, but very drinkable."
"This beer is unimpressive. I've seen it around for some time and thought I'd give it a try. It has decent appearance, and color, and has an average mouthfeel. The taste leaves a lot to be desired. Especially the overly watery backend. Doubt I will buy this one again."
"Dark amber with a creamy tan head that leaves som nice lace deposits behind on the glass. Bubblegum and weakly toasted malt with no noticeable hops in the nose. Pretty average flavors, lightly toasted grain and candy sugar, not nearly enough malt for my tastes, more English than American in style. Light bodied and effervescent. A mediocre beer at best from a normally great brewery."
"MF/D: Light in body, smooth finish, not bitter at all...good session beer"
"Quite easy to session and work through a six pack. This is a nice choco-malt shake for big boys in the fall and winter months."
"M/D-a light to medium light body, very refreshing and is without a doubt a beer that can be enjoy all night if desired, overall while it may not be the top pick for the style it is definitely one I would turn to again and again for its balance of malt and hops and it's high drinkability"
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, hint of alcohol, a burned grain smell, citrus, and slight yeast. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, a woody flavor, and finishes with some citrus. Overall, a rather interesting blend and body, but in a pleasing way. Props for a unique brew."
"Smooth on the palate with a medium-light body that makes it really drinkable. Very solid northern English brown ale overall. A great session beer (I know, technically it's not one, but it drinks like one)."
"Drinkability: Could have four to a sixer. It is my favorite beer in the variety pack. Despite having two dominate tastes it is a nice multi-layered brown. A solid effort."
"Not bad, but not very exciting. It's a little bland apart from the nose, but undeniably drinkable."
"The taste reminds me of a pale ale with lots of crystal malts. Pleasant hop finish--still this is a malty beer with light chocolate malts. Relatively thin liquor."
"This beer poured darkest brown with an off white head. The nose wasn't incredible, it offers notes of brown sugar, molasses and roasted malts. I have to say that while this example is not very complex, I appreciate how it sticks to the style well. What I mean is-I have had quite a few browns lately that while more complex-stray a bit into other styles adding flavors that weren't originally associated with the style back when it was first brewed. This Brooklyn Brown goes back to the old school and tastes like the Belgian Brunes. Caramelized brown sugar, molasses, dark fruits and roasty malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is too carbonated, they could tone that down to give it a creamier feel which I think would enhance this beer much more. Worth it just for the authentic taste."
"This is a good beer, although not my favorite in the style."
"Has a sweet smoothness to it that is not over done at all. Medium body would drink this all day."
"Drinkability: Very, very drinkable. Put a sixer in front of me and that thing will be GONE. Highly impressed and will buy again."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable Brown ale. I will buy more."
"The aroma is weak and malty with a bit of brown sugar. Flavor continues the aromas, with some coffee and nut flavors and a bit of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, pleasant and dry. Nice and easy drinking."
"D: Not a bad beer, though could have been blended a bit better. The sharpness in tastes and carbonation make it a one and done kind of beer for me."
"Not my favorite interpretation for the style. This really complimented my meatball and spaghetti dinner, but consumed by itself, the ale was not well balanced. Worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin. Overall a good but not memorable brown ale."
"Overall, this is a good, drinkable beer. While it doesn't stand out in any one way, there isn't anything it does poorly either. A mild but good nose is in my mind, it's strongest point."
"D - definitely drinkable. I'm a fan of brown ales and a fan of this one."
"This is a consistent and well-crafted brown ale and I would without hesitation rank it among the better American Browns on the market. Although thin, its a nice roughened, smoky taste with coffee and caramel maltiness. A fig and floral nose, cakey bouquet of pecan and pumpkin give this beer great drinkability for late fall dishes. Akin to many porters in color and smokiness, this beer goes down well and rounds out in the mouth as it progresses. Begins to get better and more flavorful as it warms up a bit, too."
"Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. 1/2 inch, slightly tan/white head that fades pretty quickly. You have to pour straight into the bottom of the glass to get any head; pour along the side and you get nothing. Smell is good, kind of roasty, pretty faint though. Taste is very much the same, slightly roasty, chocolaty. Seems a little watered down though. Goes down very easy, I guess by definition this would be a good session beer. I found it's best when you have two at a time! Honestly, I was a little disappointed this didn't have more kick than it did. I like Brooklyn's beer and I felt they kind of phoned it in with this one. Don't get me wrong; it is good, but compared to what their other beers taste like, this is pretty mediocre."
"Slightly watered down body with hints of toasted malt, hazelnut, chocolate maltiness, a slightly roasted toasty presence with subtle hops and a slightly dry finish. Very well balanced and easy drinking session beer."
" Very drinkable offering from the Brooklyn Brewery."
"D- Not really what I was expecting. A flavor that really didn't work that well for me."
"D- This is not really my sort of drinkable beer. I like what they are trying to do here but I do not enjoy the outcome at all."
"Brooklyn's Brown Ale is neither my favourite Brooklyn Brewing beer nor my favourite brown ale. That being said, it is further evidence that even this brewery's most undistinguished of offerings still rates well above the average. Consistency and craftsmanship are not to be overlooked; I'll take Brooklyn's mediocre over many other brewery's best."
"D: Smooth, easy and pleasant. I knocked this one back in about 5 minutes. I'd easily buy another!"
"Pretty much sub par. I probably will not by by this again, and would not recommend it."
"Review from notes taken on: 8/26/09"
"Overall a nice session beer, nothing I am going to seek out, but nothing I would turn down."
"Sorry."
"Pours a reddish brown with a moderate head that quickly reduces to a collar. A slight coffee aroma is all I get. The taste is nutty but a little watery. The feel was medium bodied and fair carbonation. Drinkability was good. Not a lot here, but it is OK and drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"Frankly, I am currently not in a good mood towards the USA, due to the extorsively behaviour of the IRS against our banks ... however one has to be fair and with a brew like this I am almost reconciled ... by far the best american brew I had in quite a while (there are not many micro brews availably here) ... very nutty and wood, very dry and smoky, full bodied like a stout, but lighter ... I must say, there is quite a master behind this one, for sure ..."
"A decent enough brown ale, I suppose, but like a lot of the ladies I see every day waltzing up and down Yonge Street, it could definitely stand to gain some weight, which would go far in masking the multiple minor deficiencies so endemic here."
"Tasty brown. Lots of going on here. Solid malt backbone. Bubblegum esters. Dry very herbaceous leafy floralities dominate the hop build and add balance. Some chocolate notes pop through. Hints of toastiness, with a slick addition of buttery caramel. The flavors work together well, creating definitely more of the Americanized Brown Ale style. Complexity is there, however flavors are a bit subdued at time. Still a great beer, still excellently drinkable. Good job Brooklyn."
"Overall, not bad. I'd still like to try their other offerings."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a chesnut brown with red highlights, and a sticky white head. The aroma is a bit bready, a bit light. The toasted malt comes through, giving it a pleasant nuttiness. The beer is medium bodied and is an easy drinker."
"Brooklyn Brown is a lighter looking American brown. The aromas are roasty and chocolate malts. Not a great nose on this beer. The hops add some character, but certainly not a bitterness. The flavors are run of the mill brown ale. A bit bigger than most English browns, but a bit weak for an American. More malt would do this beer some good."
"D: This is a nice session ale. It isn't outstanding in flavor, but it is similar to the Northern English Brown style that are easy drinking."
"Personally: One of very good brown ales available - I also really love that they include this with their variety cases. A fine hoppy brown ale. One of my favorites."
"A pleasant beer, well made, and one you could back to. The 12 pack mixer does it right by focusing on the lager and pennant ale, both of which are better brews."
"D: An medium american brown ale, maybe a bit above average. This won't make you unhappy."
"Eh. This is a bad example of a bad beer. I like brooklyn because it's local but i'm not sure about this beer. I typically don't like brown ales to begin with but this one really has nothing to distinguish it from anything else. Color, smell and flavor are all nothing to get excited about."
"Brooklyn produces some great beer. This one is a staple in the beer fridge,"
"Quite drinkable and balanced, and a well-made example of the American version of the English brown ale that makes generous use of American hop character. Decidedly drinkable."
"D- Damn drinkable with a good balance of flavors and a light body"
"Overall, I'd say it's pretty average. I'd hoped for a bit more boldness but it's certainly drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable. There are better ales with more complexity, but this is super good to drink."
"Overall, a very drinkable medium bodied brown ale with a very pleasant flavor profile."
"I've gotten some six packs of this maybe 3 or 4 times over the last couple of years and really liked it, but it didn't always seem fresh. I got to try it for the first time on tap today. Pours a dark, deep brown with a slight tint of red when held up to the light. You can see the clarity of the beer as well, which can obviously be tough with a dark beer like this. It had a decent head of froth with a little bit of lacing. It smelled great, I tend to have a tougher time smelling the hops in brown ales, but no problem with this one, had a nice hoppy smell as well as the caramel malts. It tasted nice as well, starts with the malts and a nice hoppy aftertaste. Full bodied and full of flavor. My only knock on it is that I've never found it very drinkable for an ale, it almost drinks like a porter, but it makes up for it in everything else in my opinion."
"Paired nicley with a fillet mignon lunch outside on a sunny summer day. Time and place really can do a lot for a beer. I like this beer enough to really look forward to it in the next brooklyn mixed pack I buy."
"Drinks quite easily, and as noted earlier, similar to a lager. Even a refreshing quality, which isn't what I'd expect for this style. Overall a worthwhile endeavor."
"Drinkability: extremely dry, taste is bit off putting and its oh so filling. Not something I'd want more then one in a sitting. It leaves the mouth exceptionally dry. A nice modern day brown ale, but too dry."
"Notes: Over all this is one very tasty brown Ale."
"Overall: I have had better browns, more complex browns, maybe even more nuanced and balanced browns -- but I'd be hard-pressed to find a more agreable liquid companion on a blue afternoon. Try with homemade french onion soup, but don't neglect the joys of drinking this one unaccompanied, either."
"Not a bad brew. In particular, I think, it pairs well with food, but stands alone just fine."
"d- very drinkable, i could drink a few back to back."
"Nice dark mahogany color almost two finger head with modest lacing. Modest smell - more hoppy than most brown ales for certain. Smelled some roasted malt and sweet brown sugar, too. The taste is, well, lacking. It's not an especially bad flavor, but it seems watered down - even after waiting some time for it to warm up (which helped, but only so much.) There is a little bit of malty sweetness and little bit of bitter hops, but not much of anything and not very exciting. Very, very carbonated and a medium body. This is a step up from a domestic macro lager, but I can't say much more. I'm a big fan of other Brooklyn offerings, so I was pretty disappointed in this one. I won't be buying again."
"Not feeling this beer."
"D-I suppose this could be sessioned pretty well. I think I could have a few of these in a night. So I highly suggest this one. Brooklyn Brewery is not bad at all."
"M&D: I find the overall body thinner than desirable and the texture somewhat artificial and thin (by the standard of craft US beers) as the carbonation is slightly OTT upfront, although, fortunately, it softens as soon as the malty and chewy-hoppy elements tune up a bit in the aftertaste. The label says it's ""richer and hoppier than its mild and malty English forbearers"" - well, I beg to disagree, as a hoppy English brown ale served on cask could be more all the more lively in all departments and still smoother and balanced than this filtered (and pasteurised?) bottle can offer."
"Drinkability: Certainly drinkable, but it's not as flavorful as I would want a darker ale to be. It could be that it doesn't travel well - I enjoyed this bottle in Scotland, so it had a long way to go. Still, not a bad beer."
"D: Can't see myself enjoying more than one of these at a time. I can with others (e.g., Newcastle) because they aren't as heavy as Brookyn's version."
"Pours brown (surprise!) with a smallish head. Smells slightly nutty, mild caramel and a pinch of floral hoppiness. Tastes of some caramel, little bit more nuttiness, balanced out by a touch of hop bitterness. Slightly dry, good carbonation. Solid brown ale."
"12 oz bottle poured into a shaker glass. Appears a clear deep chestnut color with two fingers of creamy light tan foam. No lacing to speak of. Hmm, quite hoppy for a brown ale, but not overdone, nice. Flavors and aromas of lightly toasted grains, toffee, caramel, and a hint of milk chocolate are also present. This ale has ample carbonation for the style and is medium bodied. Certainly worth a try."
"Pours dark brown with a fluffy tan colored head. From what I could tell, there were toasted malt, toffee, and a little hop in the aromas. I had a hard time getting anything, not a very strong smell to this one. An interesting mix of flavors, cofee and chocolate mixed with grassy hops. The finish is a little bitter and maybe a little tangy and metallic. The mouthfeel was a little thin."
"Overall- Tasty but the sweetness could become to cloying after a few. Good regardless."
"Pours attractive dark amber with slightly reddish head that slowly dissipates. Smells very sweet and malty, with a hint of honey and toffee. Sweet off the start, though it turns sour and has somewhat of a metallic taste to it. Slightly thin in the mouth, with almost too much carbonation. Still a nicely drinkable beer that I could see sessioning."
"D = It's thin nature and low ABV make for an easy drink in that respect. But the taste and feel keep me from seeking another."
"I havent typically sought out Brown ales for fear of them not being as flavorful as this one. Maybe it is time to adjust my buying habits. I enjoyed this one and thought it was very sessionable. Moderate carbonation - nice hop flavor - full flavored beer - not overly powerful in any specific area."
"Would be a drainpour if it weren't 9 bucks, and if it weren't so nice looking."
"Mouthfeel was watery; not a thick beer by any means; carbonation is moderate and the finish is quite refreshing."
"Drinkability: Not filling at all - definitely a good session brown. A good beer to hand to a girl that is looking for something other than a light beer. A gateway brown ale for the beginning craft beer drinker."
"Great beer."
"D- 5.6% aint to shabby and on the smaller end of some other browns i've tried. In fact i've been seeking out lighter ABV brews recently and this one fits perfectly. A good representative of the style and great for beginners."
"This could definitely be a session if not for the 5.6"
"Drinkability: What can I say. This beer is an immensely drinkable example of a pretty middle of the road style. Nothing crazy here, but that is how a brown ale is supposed to be."
"Pours a clear dull brown with a decent white head. Very mellow, like a British Brown, but not a lot of flavor. Easy to drink and sort of a mid range microwbrew kind of flavor. Not a lot of character or distinctness. Just sort of brown beer with an average flavor. Not super impressed."
"Brooklyn Brown is a very good beer that starts out with a creamy head, and has a nice malty and hoppy flavor combo, combined with a coffee and/or chocolate taste that is slightly sweet, roasted grains, nutty, brown sugar, herbs like tea leaf or a dry floral hop and peat moss. Complex and yet malt dominant with a hop balance to make it smooth. Mouthfeel is average, with a medium body, average carbonation and a nutty finish that is sweet and trails off with chocolate malt. This beer goes down very smooth and is full of taste. I will enjoy it again and recommend it."
"D Very good. This could easily be a great session beer."
"Forgot about this beer. Roommate brought home a six pack. Nice swill while watching the game. Good brown appearance, nothing special on the nose. Tastes malty with a little hops. For some reason I had low hopes for this beer's taste, but surpasses my expectations. very light in the mouth, almost watery. I would have no problem with drinking more."
"drinkability: brown ales are one of my favortie sessions but I could not session with this. Alchol aftertaste is too prominent"
"I think this is one of the first beers I've had in a while that evoked a mental ""meh"". Looked decent enough, the head filled my Vintage Vinyl pint glass and then receded to a small cap. The smell was nothing but hops. I was hoping for malt, maybe dark bread, something else, but it was just generic hops. Pretty watery overall, this beer lacks a malt backbone. Hops dominate the palate, along with a bit of ale fruitiness. Other than that... meh."
"The taste was partly nutty (perhaps even a caramel taste) and partly bitter. I normally don't really care for Brown Ales, but despite the fact that it's a bit dry, it's definitely a solid brew."
"D- A very nice beer, not overpowering. It is very smooth and goes down easy with small aftertaste. I would buy this beer again. This is the first of four to be tried from the Brooklyn sampler."
"Brooklyn Brown looks good when you pour it. It's a medium to dark brown color. Very little smell though. And it's a very malty beer in my view. So this is good or bad, depending on your tongue. I thought it had some nice earthy coffee notes in the background though. And, sure, it could have been an A class beer, but the foam dissipated, and then I started to think that it was just a little thin in the mouth. It was a damn decent beer, but it left me wanting something a little bolder."
"However, as always, out of the tap was entirely different. I noticed the pour was poor, 1/2 the pint was foam. But that was fixed and received the pint with a nice head. Came off as a dark red, brown coloring. Didn't take a lot from the smell, malt and oak. The first sip was perfect, exactly what a brown should be. Carmel, malts, nuts, etc. Excellent. It did fizzle out as I worked my way down, but that's more or less expected. Since it couldn't maintain, that drops it but I'll keep just a step above Newcastle."
"The body is medium/light leaning more on the light side. Medium carbonation. Quite drinkable and enjoyable for a fan of brown ales."
"I would definitely recommend this if you can get your hands on it. Brooklyn brewery comes through with another quality effort here."
"Dark brown colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is sweet malts.Taste is sugar cane with a slight chocolate and coffee backround.Another beer from this brewery that I find average.Boring ,bland and tasteless.I would not recommend there are too many other beers out there to try!!"
"D- Nice roasted malt profile as expected but the floral hopppiness in the finish seems a bit out of place. Nevertheless, an interesting flavoursome ale."
"Pours a dark rich colored body with a small creamy tan colored head. Has an aroma of hoppiness, and some sweetness. Has a creamy nutty taste, and s ome lager taste. Some hotness, alcohol. Eh, not a fan. Carbonated."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and quite smooth. It's quite drinkable and a pretty solid session brew. Certainly one I don't mind having on occasion."
"Drinkability- clearly this beer is designed to cater to this category, while making compromises with the others. It is very drinkable, the aftertaste, while unusual, does lead to another drink, and the lighter body of the beer does make it ""quaffable."""
"Pours a dark mahogany with a big tan head that quickly drops to a film. Sweet aromas of toasty and roasty malts with a smattering of brown sugar. Flavor is biscuity with an earthy hop - pretty simple and straightforward but solid. Not the best in the its class but a respectable craft beer from one of my favorite East Coast breweries."
"D-very good for a session beer. Maybe a little too dry for the style but great beer to drink all night. Not out of this world but very fine taste nonetheless."
"Over all is a good beer. Chocolate and roasted malt go very good together. Would buy again"
"Overall a very enjoyable beer!"
"Notes - Brooklyn makes some damned solid beers."
"I had this in the bottle several times prior and now on-tap. It seems to be quite a bit better on-tap. The stricking difference is that the complexity of the beer really shines through more so on-tap than in the bottle. It has the dextrin sweetness, a touch of diacetyl butteriness, the beer is a touch creamy, and it has a nice hop balance. The maltiness, caramel flavors, and a touch of chocolate malt are also present. The beer is just so much more interesting and multilayered in this format. I wish I ordered another, not realizing what a pleasant surprise was in order. This is worth seeking out in this format. L'Chaim."
"This is a nice brown ale to try for someone stretching out their beer palette."
"Notes from: 9/8/04"
"this beer pours a dark translucent brown with red highlights. the dark malt comes through clearly in the nose, with a bit of hos in the background. the taste is surprisingly well balanced with a nice malt sweet malt taste and a good bit of hop bitterness. the medium body is well accentuated by the aggressive carbonation. a very drinkable beer."
"Light black (!) body with thick brown two-finger head that softens nicely into the glass... malty presence undeniable... sugars tantalize while the hops balance nicely at the nose... smooth, almost perfectly ""brown"" in its presence, with the liquidity of a stout and the hop body of a pale ale--easily drinkable... sugary impressions early, with some chocolate, smoky something (?) and toffee to sweeten the deal... satisfying--especially on a snowday nightcap--with the smoothness of a Newcastle and a flavor that sets BBA a step above Sam Adams et al...."
"If you like malt this is a good beer to try. The color is a rich brown with a deep tan head. It doesn't have much of a nose but it has a nice mix of malty sweetness and soft hop flavor. It is a friendly and unassertive beer that you can drink thought the evening. My wife who is really fond of Dog Fish Raisin D'Etre liked it a lot."
"D - I really like this beer. It is extremely drinkable."
"this a mild well done brown"
"not great, but not bad."
"Overall: Thanks to TheodorHerzl for the generous hook up. This beer was pretty good. Mild, and non aggressive. It might be just a little boring though. Worth a try."
"(rated May 3, 2008)"
"(D: Good enough to beat out any macro. I'm happy with the results. I learned a lot from brewing this and I'm confident that my next batch (a weizenbock currently fermenting) is going to kick ass. - 4.0)"
"This one pours a clean brown color with smells of sweet malt and a hint of grassy hop. The taste is brown sugar with a slight hop characteristic that doesn't allow the sweet to get carried away; I also tasted a bit of dried fruit in this one. I generally lean towards the reds when I want a malty beer but this one was very good."
"I like this beer, because I'm a big brown fan. On a scale of browns, though, I wouldn't put it at the top. Worth a try, but don't expect to be blown away."
"Pretty drinkable. Being mild flavored and light makes this one a beer that is easy to put down."
"The beer is of a medium body and goes down very smooth. I can see drinkning a few of these in a sitting."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer overall. I like the overall mouthfeel and impression that this beer gives. There isn't much about it that stands out, but that would make it less drinkable. This isn't as sweet as other Brown Ales, but I like that. It has a good overall impression, and I would certainly drink this beer again."
"Out of a bottle this beer produced a one-finger head of tan foam atop a copper liquid with some mahogany highlights. The retention was decent as a skim and collar but the lacing patchy. The aroma was of sweet malt with some sourness and floral hops elements. The flavors were good but nothing amazing, just well balanced caramel and chocolate malt, hops and a nutty character. Don't get me wrong, a good balance is highly desirable, but I still found this one a little bland. The body was medium and the carbonation right on. A solid example of a solid style."
"It pours a handsome mahogany-brown with a good supply of puffy, beige head and adequate lacing along the pint glass. I noted an aroma of hops and malts. A medium mouth feel and not watered down. The hops are more evident in the taste and I can find a hint of something nutty. I have been drinking this beer for a while and it is one of my favorite go-to beers."
"I just tried this beer tonight. It was at a place called paddy's irish pub in rochester, NY. Had a couple of the brooklyn brown ale on tap. I thought it was awesome. Very smooth brown american ale.They sell it at our local wegmans. Wegmans Just opened a couple isles full of micro brews in rochester. There must be at least 200-300 different beers."
"The taste is lightly roasty with chocolate hint, caramelized prunes, light tart fruit, leaves, hint of sweet wine and a faint citrusy bite plus a little nut. It is mostly sweet with faint tartness and a little bitterness, mostly leafy with hint of citrus, and the finish is lightly dry, toasty, and leafy."
"Has a maple aroma when poured. Medium carbonation, tastes like autumn. Slightly sweet, almost fruity. Medium hops, and a mild malty taste. Crisp beer with a tad bit too much watery and metallic aftertaste. With more grains, this could be a righteous beer."
"D: Some nice flavors and reasonable complexity. It comes off a little too dry for the style, in my opinion. I'd drink it again, but it's nothing remarkable."
"D: Overall an easy drinking brown with a decent nutty flavor upon warming and is nicely hopped and balanced providing for a good session brown."
"Smells of sweet toffee and caramel and tastes the same. Good hop balance. Fairly light, drinkable. A good representation of the style. Would come back to this every once in a while if available in my area."
"Drinkability: At 5.50, this is generously a pretty sessionable beer. Not only is it easy to drink, but the flavors don't kick you out after 3 or 4 of these. A nicely crafted brown ale, if it was a tad bit thicker, I think Brooklyn would have hit this on the head, besides that, it's defintley one you shouldn't miss out on."
"It's mostly thin-bodied, but the yeast gives an ale thickness. Very nice overall, and bready. Sweet ale, with not a hint of bitterness at all."
"Completely average brown."
"Not my favorite Brown Ale."
"This beer is great, it is really drinkable and similiar to a beer I love by dogfish Head., It pours brown (obv) and isnt too thick though, which makes it nice and drinkable. Nice caramelly roasted malts and color, try this one if you are into nut browns or similair types."
"Verdict is a pleasant to drink brown ale but not a remarkable one. Note that this was reviewed right at the best by date (Sep 08) and may be better fresher."
"Got this in a Brooklyn Beer Party mix pack and this was one of the better ones in it. Had a nice nutty smell and taste to it and had a lot more flavor than the typical brown ale. It also poured much darker than most brown ales I've had. A very solid beer and one of the better brown's I've had."
"D - No. No sir. Brooklyn has really disappointed me with this offering; glad I won't have any more staring me down in the fridge. It's not quite offensive to be a drain pour, but it is far from passable."
"Medium body, decent carbonation. The flavors are light enough where you can have a few of these. Decent beer, but in the middle of the pack as far as brown's are concerned. Some much more inferior, but some far superior. In all, worth trying and trying in clumps of 2 or 3."
"Highly drinkable beer from Brooklyn, one of their better beers."
"Bottle at 515 in Santa Cruz. Poured into pint glass. Clear brownish red with a finger of tan head that leaves some modest lacing. Aromas of burnt grain and brown sugar. Flavor is sweet, with nutty dark malts. A touch of cocoa and an even smaller touch of hops. Mouthfeel is dry with a little roasty bitterness. Smooth but a little too roasty for my tastes. Good drinkability, solid beer."
"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy brown color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of huge caramel malt with some toffee notes. Taste is also a mix between some very rich caramel malt with some notes of toffee and no major discernable presence of hops. Body is full with some average carbonation. The best-by date was April 2008 but still very drinkable and more enjoyable then I had expected."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a deep brown with 2 cm of off-white head thats slowly diminishing. Aroma of malts, sugar, and nuts. Initial flavor malt and nuttiness. Flavor balances out and becomes hops based for a while. Medium body, light lacing, light carbonation, and limited alcohol presence. Overall, the best beer offered by Brooklyn, a great brown ale."
"Pours a copper red color into a pint glass with about a half inch of sandy-colored head. Head dissipates into a cap which leaves scant lacing throughout the drink. Aroma is of dark fruit, raisins, caramel, brown sugar, with some roasted maltiness. Mouthfeel is a little thick with lots of carbonation, a little rough, but good. Taste is raisins, chocolate, brown sugar, and some roasted coffee. A little milder than I expected, but otherwise very tasty and balanced well. Drinkability is high due to the overall good yet fairly subdued taste, even though I was expecting something a little bolder."
"I must say that for a brown ale i find this beer somewhat lacking in depth and body. It looks pretty good (if rather pale for a brown ale) in the glass and the nose is promising but the beer just doesn't deliver much after that. In fact I might almost be drinking a soda. No, that's unfair. It does actually have a beer taste and pleasant dry finish, but the carbonation is too much and the flavour really could be a lot better. I suppose you could call it subtle... I prefer to call it thin."
"great buy. I enjoyed myself. Not really what I had expected in a brown as far as the hops are concerned, but it works."
"Like a good brown ale, dark looks and sweet, roasty aroma. Weak on the carbonation though. No head at all to compliment the color and the taste is nothing special either. The beer lacks richness that a brown ale should have; it tries for all the right characteristics but comes up short. Light malt, light coffee flavors, light roast = weak beer."
"heavy malt and carmel flavors, not much hops to speak of, i taste slight traces of choalocat. this beer tastes good and is readly avalable to me but i havent tryed it untill this morning, this. this is a beer that i will get more of soon. you should give it a try, it is worth it"
"Overall this is a good beer, I just don't think it's a good brown ale. Too fruity, and not enough robust malt flavors. By no means is it a bad beer, but I probably won't be drinking this again unless offered."
"D - This is a highly drinkable brown ale- several could be drunk in a night. It lacks the complexity of other brown ales, but is smoother. One of my favorite brown ales so far, and for $6.50 a six on sale, one I'll likely be coming back to."
"Mouthfeel is a little to thin and watery for my tastes. I could enjoy two, but likely no more. Not bad, but nothing grabs me. Good representation of the style, but not its pinnacle. Makes me think of the impending fall season. Pairs well with steak and beef stew."
"Not bad, I am sure I will find myself face to face with another one of these down the road."
"Still a very nice and drinkable beer from Brooklyn. I'd have this one again for sure."
"Overall, it's a good Brown Ale. I find it a little too sweet to be a regular in the rotation but I wouldn't turn one down if offered. Need to try again to make sure that the shipping didn't screw up the sample."
"Pours a medium brown with an average head working down to some moderate lacing. The smell is mostly of medium roasted barley and a slight hint of chocolate. Toasted grains make up the backbone of the flavor with some bitter chocolate flavor and just enough hop bite to know its thier. The mouthfeel is good and complimented by the carbonation. I could drink a few of these in a sitting."
"Overall, this is a really good brown ale. Not complex or demanding, yet with enough here to keep you interested. Very easy to drink, and better yet, very easy to *want* to drink. Recommended when you're in the mood for a good beer without having to have your taste buds put on their thinking caps."
"I had this one after the Samuel Smiths Nut Brown Ale. A great beer but didn't match up to Samuel Smiths. A good pour left a nice head that smelt of malts and hops. No hops in the taste though. A great smooth brown ale, just the right malts. Went down easy and no sorry aftertaste. I'll be looking for it again. Try it."
"A decent brew. Good pairing for any brown stew or soup. Yet another solid effort from Brooklyn. A very decent fall beer with a meal on a chilly night."
"I'd recommend this one without qualification."
"This one is a darkish brown with orange highlights and a large head that reciedes quickly leaving some lace and a nice frothy covering. The nose is mainly toasted bread and nuts with some sweetness and very slight grassy/spicey hops. The taste is pretty much the same with toasted bread as the frontrunner. Mouth feel is good as is drinkability. Maby I was looking for a little bit more, but still a very worthy brown here."
"This brown ale's coloring is more red than brown in some lights. The amber-brown beer contrasts nicely with the minimal light head. A whiff of this beer conjures aromas of vanilla and brown sugar. Delightful smell. The taste, not so much. There is a distinct bitterness inherent here, with a real whallop of malt flavor. I sense nuttiness, specifically walnut. The mouthfeel really is overly light and nondescript. There is a sticky feel from the drink. However, the beer goes down smoothly enough. Not terrible, but not a smash hit."
"Extremely popular beer in our house. As American Browns go, this is a great craft rendition of the style--in fact it doesn't get much better from a bottle. Beautiful brown color in the glass, with a nice head and soft bubbles on the glass. A caramel malt scent as you raise the glass, but a nice hint of hops there too. The taste is similar--nice balance of rich caramel malt and hops (something Brooklyn does very well). Definitely worth trying."
"D = This one is definitely drinkable but it just doesn't stand far enough out from the crowd to be highly recommended. Not a bad standby all purpose beer though."
"Pours a chocolate brown color with an average cream colored head that dissipated into a ring. The aroma is of rich caramel malt, honey, and a light butter/nut smell. The taste starts off with roasted caramel malt which is cut by a lime-like acidity. A mineral water presence runs throughout. There is some light nut flavors towards the end as well as some stale hops. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation; it finishes kind of sour and bitter from the lime presence. Not the feel I expected from a brown ale, I expected more of a smooth malty feel. I was disappointed in this brew, definitely not my favorite Brooklyn brew. The tartness seems out of whack for a brown ale."
"Drinkability: This one's pretty solid across the board, if not outstanding. Low in alcohol, tasty, attractive, and nothing distracting or cloying about it. A good outing from Brooklyn."
"A very nice beer: Refreshing, drinkable and complex at the same time!"
"I respected this beer very much for the way it was crafted, but did not enjoy drinking it. I just don't like the style."
"Rich and full mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, finishes full, not bubbly. Very drinkable, good session beer."
"Poured into a mug it's brown a little bubbly at first and a light brown receding, rocky head. Smells like chocolate malt and a light bittering hop. Tastes similar to the smell, fairly balanced with a sweet chocolate malt and a bit of bittering hop. Fairly simple but good, tasty. Finishes fairly clean, starts with a moderate mouthfeel but cleans itself from the palate with a thinner more watery finish. I really like this stuff, very drinkable."
"Overall it's a very drinkable brown and one of my personal favorites. Could benefit from a bit more hops but it's still a great example of an American Brown. Nicely balanced, well-varied malt character. Easily could drink a few pints."
"The bitter aspects of this beer are very well highlighted without being overpowering. Great brown ale."
"Notes: Got this from dyan in our last enormous trade. Thanks!"
"Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable offering as my first try of the Brooklyn Brewing Co. I will certainly seek this beer out again, and could see myself easily having multiples if I'm in the right mood."
"drinkability: I have had this beer several times and I enjoy it. It's not one of my regulars but I could see this becoming my BBQ beer. I think it's highly drinkable. Hell it's chuggable but's also sippable, if you wanna think about it you can if you don't it's not so intrusive that it demands attention. Not a superstar but a damn good beer."
"It's a great american brown and I would like to have this again. Good session beer."
"Nice complexity in here. A very enjoyable brown ale."
"Smooth and light in the mouth with nice carbonation. Lasting hint of a dry oiliness...is that an oxymoron? Excellent drinkability."
"This was a bit of a disappointment as I had heard many positive things about this ale before buying it. The color is a pleasant dark amber, which is about the most positive thing I can say. The smell has some very faint malt and coffee, and the taste is almost indistinguishable from flat Coke. It's generally lighter than I prefer for this type of beer, and has almost no carbonation. I'll pass."
"Not real impressed by this one. The flavor is a little blah, and I don't appreciate cola in my nose."
"D: A really nice ""comfort beer"" that tastes better from the bottle at a little warmer temp than would be served at most establishments. One of my favorite, widely available brown ales."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is medium-light with low carbonation and a lingering finish. More carbonation might have helped the flavors develop here. It's moderately filling, but the taste isn't good enough to justify wanting to drink more. All in all, this is just a bland, boring beer."
"this beer is certainly worth giving a try. but again. its not one of those beers i can picture myself coming back to time after time.. but thats not to say it isn't good"
"this one pours a deep red-brown w/ a thin tan head which dissipates quickly leaving a decent lacing in my nonic ; a subtle smell, cereal grains with some nutty caramel/raison notes and faint alcohol ; a deeper malt flavor balanced well w/ hops, some more nuts and raison here, finish is a bit fusel ; a med-light bodied beer, yet still feels creamy, moderately carbonated ; a drinkable brew indeed, i could have a few of these easily..."
"Pours a dark brown color with ruby shinning through. The head is dark tan and thick...it doesn;t leave much lace or have good retention. The nose is heavily of oak with hops and toasted malt coming through as well. The taste is also very oak-y - very nice - with notes of caramel and chocolate appearing as well. Moderately roasted malt and hops continue to surface throughout the sip. Very good beer...nothing outstanding, but you can tell the Brooklyn quality is present when drinking it."
"Drinkability was quite good. This is a fairly intense brown ale that does not seem to get the respect it deserves. Try pairing it with some nuttier cheeses. An aged cheddar or a gruyere would work perfectly."
"M/D - pretty good here. I would love to get this fresh to see if mine had dropped in quality a lot, but even as it was it's very good."
"A nice summer sipper for those who don't want something too hoppy or too light. Very drinkable."
"D: Very easy to drink, could have several in a sitting without any problems."
"Color is a dark rich brown, with plenty of tan head. Smells mildly of coffee, chocolate, malt. Tastes as it smells, but not quite as intensely as you might hope. A little more flavor and it would have been on the money. A bit of coffee bitterness on the finish. A very drinkable beer, but could have been a bit stronger."
"D - Very enjoyable... Very much a session beer... It's a shame it would have received stellar marks had it been a little stronger in terms of scent and taste..."
"Could easily replace Yuengling for a backyard brew for my summer."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is full, but not particularly heavy. Carbonation is moderately light which matches the flavors nicely. Although not a great fan of brown ales, this one is rather good. I found this highly enjoyable and would seek it out when available. Very nice."
"D - Sessionable, but versatile at the dinner table as well. Recommended."
"Nice, easy drinking session beer. Pretty tasty."
"D - A very drinkable and flavorful brown ale. Easily one of the best examples of the style that I have experienced."
"Drinkability is not to bad, could have a few more but would rather an EBA."
"A nice session beer. Served in a pint glass, it was a reddish/brown color with a moderate sized tan head. A sweet, cherry aroma, some malt, and a tiny bit of chocolate. The taste was sweet, with a little chocolate, and some hop bitterness. I really enjoyed the 6pack, and will drink it again."
"D - This is and easy to drink and smooth brown ale. What's not to like?"
"Bright amber appearance with immediate lacing. It was pretty hoppy with some caramel flavors, but there was also some spice mixed in. It was a bit fruity, with a mix of sweet malts supplementing it well. Crisp carbonation helped make the sweetness of the drink stronger and more potent. Overall, it was a bit too powerful in some flavor dimensions but it still got the job done."
"D- i don't usually go for sweet brown ales, but this one is nicely balanced and as it warms the hops really begin to stand out. it's full bodied enough to keep my attention and make me think with every gulp, trying to find new flavors. oddly enough, the first time i had this beer was in 2005 in manhattan/hells kitchen (sadly not brooklyn) but for me that adds sort of a nostalgic feeling that can't be replaced. while right now it's a good beer, at that time, it was amazing."
" From the source it was a bit heavier than the bottle version and even the ABV felt stronger. I do recall the bitterness it left on the tongue and how it was the only beer I could have that night. As one can tell my mouth waters at the mention of this beer,but on tap more so. This beer is best served at 52-55 degrees. Too warm and too cold and it loses something for me."
"Good beer definitely worth picking up. I would definitely like to try this on tap. I think this might be a little heavy to put into the session category, but I would definitely have more than 1 or 2."
"This is one heck of a drinkable American Brown."
"The body is closer to mid than light. Looking for more body as there is a watery, wispy flavor. Overall really the cardboard flavor is just obnoxious."
"Thanks to davehoward for the bottle! Pours a dark brown color with ruby edges on the glass. Light tan fizzy head. Smell is toasty, semi roasty malt. Hint of chocolate and coffee round it out and a mild roastiness is present in the taste as will along with a slight sour bitterness. Very thin body I thought. Not bad, but just not impressive especially for what I was expecting."
"A nice dark carmel color. Not too much to smell but a nice mouthful to taste. A full beer, with a hoppy taste as well as a full malt taste. Slight carmel taste with some bitterness which leaves the mouth slightly dry. Not a very full heavy mouthful, a little thin but enjoyable. Nice creamy head after it is poured. Overall a very nice beer; I like it!"
"I expected a little more from this beer after someone recommended it to me, but I was not at all disappointed by its overall taste or drinkability. An above average beer."
"Overall an easy drinking brown ale."
"Much better out there to choose from... Wouldn't recommend this one..."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, some toffee/caramel. The taste is malty, nice touch of toffee/caramel. The finish has a slight bitterness to it. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brown ale."
"This is a pretty good Brown Ale that is easy to drink."
"Taste: Like the aroma, starts out hoppy (more than expected, but not in a bad way). This is quickly balanced with a chocolatey, roasty malt note. Finishes balanced with a good, bitter coffee note."
"Pours a dark ruby color with a quarter inch of off-white head, great retention. The aromas coming off this beer were quite roasty with a strong chocolate presence, along with a bit of citrusy hops, not the best match. On the palate, things improve with the chocolate and toasty flavors dominating in a mesh of bright hoppiness. A bit of coffee to finish. Overall, I'm not digging the amount of hops in this beer. Mouthfeel was medium thin with medium carbonation and a slight heaviness in the mouth. Overall, this wasn't an extrordinary, but one I could return to."
"D - Decent, not at all what I was expecting however. I could go for another, but I'd have to be in the right mood, not exactly something I'll be seeking out again. Worth a try."
"Notes: Definitely a good drinking session beer."
"Overall, its pretty average. Its something that would appeal to a non-BA pretty readily. After drinking something like DFH's Indian Brown Ale, it just doesnt compare though. The aromas and taste are solid, but seem to be almost light and watery (respectively) when compared to something of the DFH's caliber. I know these are slightly different, but if given the choice, i would go for the DFH. This beer has a pretty good drinkability, and i could see it being nice in the springtime. This beer seems a little unbalanced, but could be appealing to a novice BA."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer has a medium light body with lower levels of carbonation. This is a fairly drinkable beer, but not something that I'd be in a rush to drink again as previously stated, worth a try but thats about it."
"The taste on first sip and plenty of flavour here. Mild roasted malt along with some nutty tones followed by a nice earthy flavour and a bit of hop bitterness in the background. I even get a bit of chocolate. It's light bodied(at times) bodied and it finishes with a semi sweet twang but right at the vey end, it's somewhat watery. Still, that's not going to spoil it for me. This is a *good* Brown Ale and I'd drink it again."
"Pours a light brown color that tapers in light to dark from the bottom to the top of my sam adams glass. Head all but disppears from sight. Smell is malty sweetness with a touch of honey and a slight bitter earthy hops. Taste is sweet and again a slight earthy hops. Mouthfeeling is a little watery, but not too much. This is a very good example of a nice Brown ale. In my opinion a very underappreciated style."
"Quite drinkable and enjoyable. Not earth shattering but tasty for sure."
"pours a dark brown with a large beige head that quickly settles to just cover the beer. initial aroma smells of banana then caramel and cherrys. taste is sweet, fruity, mostly malt with hint of caramel. mouthfeel medium, carbonation is very weak with this beer and takes away from the overall taste. came in a variety pack and not sure i would buy it on its own."
"D - A brew that is easily quaffed and enjoyable, could have had several pints if I had the time"
"D - overall a decent brown ale but not one that is even close to blowing me away. I would probably pass on this one if I saw it again. I got it out of a Craft beer mix pack and think it is just a bit too unbalanced for my taste plus i'm kinda surprised by the sourness of the beer, A big disappointment from Brooklyn in my eyes."
"D: This is apparently a rather popular purchase here, and in some regards I could understand it. If anything, it is a reasonable introduction to dopplebocks... but only if that's the purpose it served. The dopples can be quite a wonderful style, and it would be a shame if potential fans were turned away by something they expected to be bigger."
"D: Hard for me to find anything great or bad to say about this. Always reliable when found on tap and very easy to drink"
"*NOTE: The bottle was contract brewed by F.X. Matt (Utica, NY) and bore the inscription, ""Best Before February 2007."" Make of this what you will."
"Drinkability is very good and very smooth with just a hint of alcohol warmth noted. A good solid brown that would make a fine session beer and shines as it warms."
"Final thoughts: Damn that was a good brew. Too bad I haven't found it in New Mexico..."
"Brooklyn Brown Ale pours a dark red tinged brown with a light tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is malty that strikes me as being carob like. The flavor is malty, and I do get the carob note in the flavor too. Quite mild, hardly any hops, but I prefer a nuttier flavor profile when I drink brown ales. Still, a quite well made beer. Sessionable."
"Final thoughts  Quite smooth and easy drinking. Ive had much better brown ales."
" The 5.50% ABV is fitting for this, even though I could detect it during my first few sips. During my late-night drinking sessions in cold weather, I usually prefer stouts, winter warmers, or winter wheats. This suffices nicely, but after sampling nearly everything that Brooklyn brews, I had high expectations for this. This is enjoyable, but there's just a certain something missing here. Nevertheless, I'm glad they have this on their roster - I wish I had this style of beer more often."
"It's a nice medium bodied brew, with a light amount of carbonation.Overall a pretty good beer, not hard to put down at all and has a decent amount of flavor."
"Overall- More chocolate tones than the brown ales I'm used to drinking. I'd drink it again."
"D: I put down 3 over dinner rather easily. I had this during a Veterens day cook out, and let me tell you it was a fine drinking brew, will be even better as the weather cools."
"D- I was rather impressed with this one. A very solid brown ale."
"Poured a slight muddy head, deep brown with red hues. Smelled of coffee grinds and... (bananas?). Can't really tell what the smell is, but it's slightly sweet and decent enough. Tasted of some coffee, caramel and a little chocolatey. Somewhat sweet. Doesn't have the aftertaste that leaves you wanting more, but nothing offensive. I've only had this and the Lager from the Brooklyn brewery. I keep hearing they have such a good line up, hopefully we can get some of their more unique brews down here in FL."
"Brooklyn Brown Ale pours a dark espresso brown with a generous mocha colored head. This brew presents a nose of roasted malts with a smoky aftertaste. Sweet malts alongside soft hops; well-balanced and very drinkable. Interesting in that Sam seems to be trending to utilizing a smoky component to some of their products recently, this adding a needed complexity to some of their otherwise typical products. No complaints here!"
"Not the best, but better than most. It looks like a brown ale - do you know what a brown ale looks like? It has a slight nutty, caramel depth like an English brown, but the added component of more roasted malts make it a bit more assertive. This is the great go-to pitcher at my local watering hole. It goes well with stews and roasts. I read Garret's book. He can make you hungry, and reconsider his approach to brewing - not the most pioneering in America, but the most assiduously tradition-respecting and precise brewer."
"Excellent drinkabilty. Flavorful, but still sessionable and fairly light."
"This is a really nice brown ale. It pours brown from the bottle with a nice light caramel colored head. The aroma is of roasted malts and a sweet hint of chocolate roasted malt. It tastes just as good with the sweet roasted malts coming through over hints of chocolate flavor. The carbonation was excellent and had a really nice mouthfeel. It's aftertaste is nice with hints of chocolate and the overall beer is really good. This is one of the best brown ales I have had. Pick this up, it is worth it."
"Straight from the Brooklyn Party Pack, 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Sweet Lord, this brew looked so good. It looked like rich redwood furniture in a prestigious library. Smelled of sweet, sweet malts. Tasted of a hint of roasted malts and the tang of citrus, but mainly caramel malts. Not the greatest tasting beer, but definitely enjoyable. Overall, I'd take one any day and it is a beautiful-looking beer. Hold it to light, and try it yourself."
"Served in pint from a bottle, freshness marked on side as good until 10/2007 so I hope this does not have much affect on the taste. Nice creamy head with a medium brown ""nut"" like body. Smells sweet, malty, with notes of caramel. Smooth drinker. Sweet and dry, it does not overwhelm the palate. Solid nut flavor throughout with a decent hop bite. Good for drinking and good as a crossover for macro drinking friends open to suggestion."
"A nice 3 finger deep tan head shows fat bubbles and decent lace after a strong pour. The body is the blackest brown you can get, only showing hints of brown around the edges. Nose is a soft roasty malt feel with a zesty nutty backbone. Oddly soured malt feel enters the mouth with a slight shock. This does mellow out quickly though. The what rawness comes through all over the palate. The overall taste is a little sour dominate and not quite developed. Lacks the even richness of what I would expect from a brown ale. Mouthfeel is soured and sharp. Not all that enjoyable overall."
"D: Medium - don't think I'll be buying more. Doesn't down as smooth then the alcohol tastes so potent."
"Thanks to limesmut for a nice extra in a great trade!"
"Overall, a solid brown ale. I will have to pick this up in bottle to better assess it."
"Bottle. Clear, mahogany pour, topped by a small, beige head. Quite fruity nose, with pine and citrus, but it has a solid malty background. Definately malty flavor as well, but they blend with a good dash of bitterness, citrus and pine. Medium body. Bitter finish with pine and fruit. Not what I expected from a brown ale, but it sure is a nice one. (070801)"
"This is a good brown ale and one of the best I've had. Another winner from Brooklyn."
"D- A very drinkable beer, one of my ""go-to's"" when I can't find anything new! Let it warm up a little!!"
"Had this one on draft at the Emerald Coast Brew Fest in Pensacola, FL. Poured an attractive mahogany brown with a good head. Aroma and taste are both malty with a little sweetness that is offset by a subtle bitterness at the end. Very smooth beer. Drinkability is very high. Mouthfeel is good."
"Aroma is malty with a strong molasses component and spicy and hoppy hints. Flavor is malty with some hop undertone, a whisper of sweetness, and just a touch of bitterness. It pours a rich, transparent mahogany brown with a fairly thick off-white head. It feels just a shade thin, but otherwise is very tasty. This ale is very smooth and leaves a surprisingly hoppy but not bitter or nasty aftertaste."
"Overall, not a bad brown ale at all. Brooklyn is pretty much good at everything they do, and this is no exception. I do, however, prefer Wolaver's Organic Brown as an American Brown, but the style is better than English in my opinion, which tends to be a bit too nutty. Would probably pick this up again."
"Drinkability: Average."
"The brown ales are a bit too sweet for me, I do not find them to be a session type beer as two are plenty."
"This was my fault for not giving Garrett the benefit of the doubt earlier. Awesome, so of course, highly recommended."
"Cheers"
"Overall this was very drinkable but not really what I would consider something I could drink all night; I've said it before and I'll say it again: the style is very difficult to make well, and balance is key. This was almost too sweet and hoppy, but a good try nonetheless."
"D- Yes this is a good beer and has been a personal favorite since my early days. It was my session beer when most of my friends were drinking BMC at tailgates and the like."
"This one is an American classic most of my non-beer nerd and less adventurous friends have drank and loved."
"One of the better brown ales out there. It's not a favorite style, personally, but if I'm going to drink a brown ale, this is one of the first ones I'd reach for."
"Dark brown, more so than I'd expect for the style. Hazlenut and roast dominate the smell. The flavor follows suit. Coffee roast dominates but it gives way to a subtle malt that banishes any thought of bitterness. Wow. Really, truly impressive. Mothfeel is silky and ribbon soft. Just enough carbonation to add interest. Drinkability? Barkeep, hit me again!"
"Drinkability: Not impressed. Too sweet when it first hits the palate, too bitter afterwards. Lacks complexity in flavor. Wouldn't buy it again."
"A non-offensive brown ale that I would definitely suggest to a newbie friend, but I like mine with a bit more body and flavor."
"My first Brooklyn Brewery brew. Didn't quite match the hype but worth it."
"Overall: Serve cool, not cold; much of this beers complexity is lost if overly cold. Served at fridge temp into a cold pint glass at the bar, it took half an hour for its character to unfold. Still and all, it strikes me as a kind of American extreme brown; over the top and in many directions rather than subtle and competent. As such, it is OK, but within the broader realm of more drinkable brown ales, it gets lost in the clutter."
"A pleasant brown ale. Nothing overly special but very nice and highly drinkable."
"Overall a nice and drinkable brown ale."
"A very drinkable session ale. It's not something that is going to blow your mind and I don't think it's meant to be. It serves it's pupose as a good sessionable beer."
"D: Not bad. I could come back to this once in a while. Worth trying."
"A deep brown reddish color with a beige colored head forming about a half inch thick forms. The sweet scent malt, carmel and some nuttiness, followed by a sweet spicy fragrnce. That malt dominates the flavor all the through to almost the very end, where smack of bitterness hits the palate. A medium bodied feel, very smooth, with a hint of carbonation at the back of the palate. This is a solod beer very good flavor, easy to drink, great for with steaks on the grill, plus it makes a good session beer."
"The texture was heavier than expected, a nice surprise. Some creamy smoothness and moderate carbonation that cleans up the finish."
"Pours a delightfully brown hue, in accordance with the name, with a taupe 2-finger head. Smell is of earthy tones, tree bark, with roasted malt. Overall taste was really good: malty sweet with just a touch hops. Smooth, enjoyable beer. This was really a pleasure to drink. My first chance at a Brooklyn brew and this one did not disappoint. Highly recommend giving it a shot."
"D-This is a damned tasty beer, one that is quite refreshing."
"More character in the pour than is found in most brown ales--rich, dark brown color with cherry highlights. Average amount of foamy tan head falls away pretty quickly but leaves fine sheets of light lace. The nose is predictably malty but, like the appearance, has more character than expected. Caramel and lightly toasted nuts give the malts some complexity, and fruit and hops round things out nicely. These notes all carry over into the taste, where the hops are actually more pronounced. Starts firm and malty, with more fruit and hops in the middle, and a dry, lingering finish. Nicely drinkable, though I would like the mouthfeel to be a bit heavier, so the flavors would linger more. This is a pleasant version of a style that I typically think of as middle-of-the-road OK."
" Drinkability is reached for me for its not a big nut only beer. Well balanced, leaving a slight dryness to finish."
"D- Excellent. The combination of good flavor, light body, and malty goodness that's well-balanced make this beer an all-nighter. cheers!"
"So I'm in the second store of the day wandering the beer aisle and I see that brooklyn brewery has made it's way into NH with 6 packs of their brown ale. Ok, I'll try that. As of this writing there are 356 reviews so rather than write another version of ASTMD I'll limit my sojourn to this being a slightly above average brown ale. It went nicely with an aisan garlic beef dish for dinner. I applaud their entry to NH and look forward to some of their more robust brews."
"Drinkability: I'm good for about 4-5 of these.... I recommend this fine brew."
"D- The flavor I thought was delicious and nutty, but the wateryness of this beer turned me off slightly. All things considered the lightness of the beer probably was better for drinkability than an overly heavy nut ale, but I would love to see some improvement in that department regardless."
"Overall, it's definitely one of the better examples of a Brown Ale that I've had."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied and very drinkable. I'd gladly session this. Overall, it's a pretty nice offering from Brooklyn Brewery. Try it."
"Mouthfeel was somewhat thinner and lighter than anticipated -- especially compared to DFH Indian Brown. But pretty drinkable at only 5.5 and fairly sessionable on a warm night."
"Drinkability is very good. I found it perfect at cellar-temperature (approx 13-14C). Too cold and you don't get to seriously see what this beer is about."
"B""ham UK"
"D - enjoyable beer drinking experience, a few of these can be had in a sitting."
"Solid brown color, a little head, no lacing at all. Looks alright. Nose is mild malt and nuts,not a whole lot there. Taste is spicier, nutty malt, some brown sugar, hop bitterness at the end. Quite a nice surprise with the fairly subtle nose. Feel is good. Overall, this is a quality beer, especially on-tap."
"Paid 1.29 for a 12 oz. bottle. Looks flawless in the glass - deep dark cherry/mahogany stained color. Very deep brown, but clear enough to let some light through. Smell is fantastic - coffee, chocolate, gentle hops. Taste isn't quite as good though - burnt coffee, toaster crumbs, pinch of rough bitter from the hops. Mouthfeel is creamy and nice, but carbonation a bit spiky."
"DA: This is one of my favorite's of this style, i'm not a huge fan of this style overall but this one is pretty diverse and easy to drink."
"I have heard good things about this beer and would say that they were all confirmed in this bottle-definitely a beer that I would look forward to drinking agin. When will they distribute directly to Ireland?"
"Overall: Good beer. Not great. Seems a little over hopped for a traditional English Brown. Definately an American interpretation of the style."
"I poured this beer from the bottle to a 50 degree tumbler. The beer was a nice mahogany color with a fine tan head that just looked very good from the get go. It had a slightly hoppy smell but the tase of over hopping was not there thank goodness. The beer is a nice blend of roasted toasty tasting malt. I will buy again"
"D- This is a very drinkable brew. I enjoyed it and will probably have it again."
"Drinkability: Tasty and goes down pretty easily, I could see having a few of these in a night."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, good representation of style, this is a good beer to stick with for an evening and overall is pretty good beer."
"Cheers!"
"Medium-dark amber brown body with a finger of creamy khaki-brown head. Nutty, chocolatey aroma with notes of caramelly sweetness, biscuit, and fresh herbal hops. Toasted malt flavors turn to caramelly sweet with notes of mild chocolate. Nutty middle with hints of dark fruit. Tobaaco and tangy malts before an herbal hop finish. Moderate bodied with a creamy feel. Another nice Brooklyn beer."
"Nothing special here, just a very, very well done, solid beer. Won't blow your mind, but a great example of the style and a wonderful session. One of my go-to beers when I want to enjoy drinking without thinking."
"D - An all around drinkable and enjoyable brew from Brooklyn. Alcohol is not noticeable and this could be very sessionable if you are in the mood for a brown ale."
"Poured brown like a a Coke and a nice smell of fruits and malts filled the room. There was not much foam. The bitter taste was perhaps fuller than that of a normal brown ale with sweet caramel, chocolate, and licorice. It had a lot of bubbles and an almost syrupy mouthfeel."
"Very sessionable. I look forward to drinking this again on my next trip to ny."
"Notes: I really dig brown ales and this is a real nice example of one. Tasty and balanced, an ideal session beer, despite the ABV being a little on the high side."
"Pours a lighter brown that is pretty clear around the edges. No head to speak of. There are a good amount of hops coming through in the nose. This is a pretty good brown. The hops are a nice compliment here. The mouthfeel is a little thin and too watery for my taste. But this is still a very good beer. Would have again."
"I'm not always sold on the dump-more-hops-into-every-style way of thinking. I find in this one it feels out of place. Not bad, but doesn't work for me."
"D: Very good drinkability. Well balanced between bitterness and smoothness and sweetness. Something between northern and southern english brown ales with an american accent, according to Brooklyn Brewery. I'd say a typical american brown ale. I like it a lot."
"A well-crafted American brown. The balance leans a bit to the hops rather than malt or sweetness, and the body is a bit lean and dry for my malty tastes, but that doesn't affect it's drinkability in any major way. In fact the moderate ABV and fine flavor makes it a good choice for session work."
"really really solid. pours a slightly cloudy brown with a khaki colored head. smells sweet and slightly roasted. you can smell slight hop notes as well. very smooth taste. mellow nut like flavors, slight chocolate. very sweet, not too sweet. very well rounded. awesome american brown ale, one of the better one i've sampled. i guess it doesn't hurt that the brewery's from my hometown. sessionable beyond belief."
"D: A very drinkable brown ale -- this is one of my favorites of the style."
"Pours a nice ruby brown, but with little head or lacing. Smell is dry and lightly malty with a grainy note. Taste is slightly deeper with the aromas echoed in the flavor, but there is also a slightly roasted note and some hops at the end. There are also some slight dark fruit notes. Mouthfeel is well balanced and somewhat creamy. Really a nice beer, very drinkable and a pleasure on a spring or fall day."
"Poured a nice dark brown with a one inch head. Qucik fade left a decent lace on the top. Smell was light, but very nice malted grain and caramel, sweet and well rounded. The taste felt much thicker then I thought it would. Taste was grainy with some nice english bitter hops rounding it ou. Very nice. It was smooth and slick, very easy going down with a decent bitter hoppy finish. Great carbonation made for a nice smooth mouth feel. Overall a nice classic brown ale and an excellent session choice."
"A light mouthfeel with some creamyness and grainy textures. Easy drinking a good session beer."
"D: I was sort of disappointed in this beer. I like browns and this one fell short for me. Still not but but simply not great."
"Drinkability - this is good ale and quite sessionable."
"Overall impression: Very drinkable brown - a bit bolder than others I have tried."
"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights and no head to speak of. Aroma is nutty, toasty, carmel. Taste is lightly roasted malts and carmel. Little alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is fairly thin for the style. Decent pairing with hearty meal at this price point."
"Mouthfeel was rather thin. Smooth, rounded."
"An ok drink but I have had better."
"Drinkability: Decent brown ale. Very drinkable and a good comprimise for decent flavor and being not too powerful."
"Overall, a very light and easy to drink, and that's pretty much where its ends. This would be a good choice if you were looking to drink something different, but weren't in the mood for something extreme."
"Beer poured an opaque light brown with a well sustained tan head. Nose is strong of grassy hops with a slight hint of the chocolate roasted malts.Taste is of roasted malts, hint of chocolate, and finishes with a pronounced dry grassy hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly lively on the palate. Drinkability is pretty good. This is an interesting take on the brown style. Much hoppier than most I have tried, This is definitely worthy of a shot!"
"Apparently the owner of the liquor store in Brooks gets this in because he's the only one that drinks it in SE Alberta...not any more fella"
"This is a very drinkable brown. There are notes of roasted nuts, burnt chocolate, and dark coffee. Hops are thankfully kept to a minimum. A solid, caramel malt backbone is certainly present. Finish is a bit dry. This is a very quaffable brown ale from Brooklyn, and perfect with some BBQ."
"I was not impressed by this brown ale. I have had alot better. I was disapointed. This ale had very little taste and the color could have been darker. Its not an ale I would have on tap for a party when I have frieds over. I was expecting more form this ale."
"very drinkable beer, but nothing overly spectacular."
"Pours dark brown, with a redish hue. Thin tan head, with decent retention,and lacing. Smell is weak. Toasted malts mostly. Body is thin, with some carbionation. Taste is weaker than I expected. Toasted malts, up front,with a hoppy finish. Not awful, but I think they missed the mark a bit."
"A promising brown, needs a little bit more of a flavour kick, but would make an ideal session ale for sure, a pleasure to drink. Great to see Brooklyn Brewery beers here in Alberta."
"12 oz bottle from my beer of the month club. Poured into a small snifter. Dark, dark, dark brown with orange highlights in areas that are able to allow more light through. Nice cream colored head that diminishes into a thin ring where beer ends and glass begins. I can pick out the smell of sweet caramel malt and some light brown sugar. It does not taste sweet at all, however. Nice balance of malts and a good balance of bittering hops. Nothing too crazy going on with this one. Just a decent brown."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown with a small tan head that leaves some decent lacing. Not much aroma going on, just a bit of malt. The taste is a nice nutty malt with some hops at the end. This is a good tasting beer but not great. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied. Drinkability is quite good as I can easily drink a few of these. Overall, this is not my favorite brown ale but it's still a nice example of the style."
"Smells very malty with a hint of hops, taste is sweet, a bit of chocolaty sweet malts. A hint of hops are are present at the end. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, but the brew is very drinkable because of this. Overall a pretty refreshing yet tasty beer."
"Had this at The Big Hunt the other night. A deep rich burnt-amber and mohogany color. This is an extremely pretty beer. Sharp orange and reddish hues burst from the sides and bottom when held up to the light. Pours a fat two-finger head which leaves a thick lace along the sides of the glass as the beer recedes. The aroma is a bit muted. Some malty, chocolate, cherry notes, but all very dulled. It tastes much like the aroma, but a bit more forceful here, in a pleasant way. Malty, with a nutty coffee and chocolate presence. But it also presents a nice fruitiness as well as it finishes with a hoppy cherry taste. Some slight hints of banana aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but does not detract from the overall experience. This is a very drinkable beer, and I would have no problem making it a session beer. Sets the bar for American brown ales, in my opinion."
"D - Easy to drink, One of the best brown ales I have tasted..."
"I was pleasantly surprised since I bought this as a ""I've never tried that before"" beer."
"Taste was a bit sweet and definately malty, chocolate and some type of nut (macedamia?). Need to try this again in seclusion, the atmosphere was a bit distracting. Decently light and bubbly mouthfeel, a bit too dry for my liking though. Definately went well with the burger...liked that about the drinkability."
"Label on bottle says best before March 2007. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear brown color with about an inch off-white head. Lacing is good. It smells like caramel, chocolate, malt and even some grassy and citrusy hops. It tastes like caramel, roasted malt, chocolate, nuts and a bit of grapefruit. It's hoppier in the finish than I expected it to be. Mouthfeel is on the light side, but not in a bad way. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a pretty well balanced brown ale. I'd drink it again, I think it's a pretty good beer."
"Pours a coke brown that allows the drinker some sight at this beers bubbling. Which is very sporadic and light. The Head is a light tan that retains throughout the whole beer. The aroma is very malty. Giving the impression that there is some chocolate bronies inside the glass. Lots of toasty and roasty goodness. The taste give the balance of roasted and toasted malts equal time time. Along with some very lght English hops. Creat a great melange of English meets American brewing styles. Great to drink in mass quantities. Great session beer."
"Notes: I had this on tap recently after doing some Christmas shopping -- a big 23 oz draft -- and it was excellent. May have been a little bit better than the bottle, or it could have been that I really needed a break from shopping at that point."
"This is a really nice brown ale. Pours a ruby red color with decent lacing. Aroma not overpowering but some maltyness and a slight hint of fruit. Taste is mild malty, incredibly smooth and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is good for a brown ale. Drinkability is great. I could easily swill many of these over the course of an evening. A very nice smooth beer, much better than Newcastle."
"I had this beer on tap in a pint glass. It poured a nice coppery brown hints of an amberish red as well. A nice fluffy off white head capped the brew. There is a just a hint of hop aroma, nice and malty in the nose. Tastes of malt and carmel. Very even and tasty beer. VERY drinkable, high on my list of browns."
"Deep mahogany, maybe from the lighting with a nice two finger head that lasted. Smells of malt and almonds. Taste was the same with a very slight hop bitterness at end. I definately thought nut brown ale for style of this beer."
"Copper brown hue, dense khaki head, and webby lacing. Leafy hop spice scents on top of caramelly bread aromas with maple and walnut notes. Doughy. Mellow ""English"" hop spiciness up front, followed by a caramel and dark poundcake (almost cocoa-ish) middle. Demure bitterness at the finish. Tasty! Smooth mouthfeel, overall, with a slight chewy quality throughout. A very drinkable brown, particularly when fresh. After many samples, I've decided this beer shines brightest from the tap. A high-quality session brown for certain."
"This was great beer. All the subtle flavors worked marvelously together."
"Good finish with moderate mouthfeel. Very nice clean beer."
"Pours a dark tea color with a good frothy head. The aroma is supurb! I'm not a stout/prter fan, but the hint of roasted malt works perfectly with the sweet malt and hops. Like I said earlier, I don't like a lot of roasted malt and that characteristic is more pronounced in the flavor than the aroma. The mounthfeel is good. It's a well balanced beer from I brewery I had never heard about."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the taste."
"d - has a clean and slightly metallic finish. overall a decent beer but not one of my favorite brown ales."
" Poured a dark brown with nice fluffy head. Smells malty with slight hint of hops.Taste thick and creamy with a little sweet malt flavor with a bit of bitter hoppyness. Not to strong but definitely not weak good all around flavors and something I'll buy and enjoy again."
"I kind of like this, and will give it another go...but right now, I can't say it is that drinkable. This is a really weird, off taste that is drinkable, but not quite enjoyable."
"5.5 abv., so it could be a great session beer but the taste is just a bit weak. Still pretty good though."
"The mouth feel is light to medium boded with a miniature carbonation. This felt oddly dense and sticky."
"Drinkability: Not too complex to hold back, nice and clean."
"Overall a very flavorful brown ale with lots of character. Nothing timid or ambiguous about this beer. Everything is pronounced and well balanced, except maybe just a tad sweet - but I really enjoyed it. I can imagine pairing this with cream cheese stuffed French toast, mmm..."
"Medium body with moderate carbonation. Slightly sticky. The mouthfeel is spot on what I want from a brown ale and drinkability is high. Very disappointed I only bought a single. Probably the best brown I have ever had."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable. Tasty, but no one flavour is overpowering, making it very true to style."
"D- Nice to hang out and have a couple. Nothing to drink all night."
"This isn't a bad brew by any stretch, but there are brown ales I enjoy much more and there are other Brooklyn brews I enjoy much more so those are two lethal strikes against this one. Would I have another one? Sure, but as mentioned if the options are a plenty, I'll likely be leaning toward another Brooklyn offering or a different brown ale if I see one to my liking."
"D: Really tasty. Not the kind I could drink 6 of in a sitting, but this is one of my favorite American brown ales. It blooms wonderfully."
"Drinkability: Very average. Far too bland and ordinary for me to seek out again in the future."
"D: Drinkable brown ale. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Good session brown."
"Bottle, best by August '06. I missed it by two days but took my chances. Poured it into a paper cup, so I missed some of the visuals, but it had a decent rust-brown color with a lingering cream-colored head. In retrospect I wish I'd poured it into something nicer (not that I had any options at the pizzeria I was in) since its appearance was the best thing about this ale. The aroma and taste were both simple and overpowering, with a huge roasted malt flavor, strong and saccharine, with caramel highlights emphasizing the cloying sweetness. There were hints of coffee, chocolate and nuts in the taste as well as a bitter punch to start off but all of those were drowned out by the caramel and malts. Fairly high carbonation smoothed it all out a bit by distracting the tongue. The aftertaste was equal parts sweet and bitter, but, again, poorly blended and overpowering. A pretty simple beer with some promise, if it could just be toned way down."
"A fantastic American Brown Ale that doesn't hold true to the halmarks of the nutty-rich and sweeter style; yet hits home with a formitable nutty flavor to back caramel sweetness and suble hop character. Good, just lacking identity."
"This is a brown ale with a real easy to drink character. Not as hoppy as say Dogfish Heads version but still well balanced and malty on the finish. I got a sense that BBQ friendly sessionable beer was the order of the day. Nicely made with a solid backbone this is a welcome addition to my fridge."
"the malt flavors have promise but are interrupted by a sharp cascadey bitterness and there might even be some bitterness coming from the roasted grains. the mouthfeel leaves something to be desired"
"Drinkability was good and better as it warmed. A fine well balenced brew all-around. MK"
"D: The beer is worth another look just to confirm or deny my thoughts."
"This beer was sold to me by one of my favorite vendors, and he said ""Brooklyn's Brown is about as good as they get."" I must say it did not meet this high status. Pours a dark translucent brown color with a moderate head that disappears quickly. Smell is great, very malty and sweet. Taste is good, but its hard to find anything about it that really sets it apart from other browns. The first taste is the malt with sugar, then the carbonation kicks in and amplifies both these tastes. In the end there is really more of the same, with little variation. A good beer, but I would say there are better Browns out there."
"Certainly an above average brown ale...not thin like many of the others. I like it."
"Not a bad brew by any means, just not my favorite brown ale."
"D: Maybe because its on tap, but this really goes down easy. There is a lingering bitterness but it is pleasant."
""
"Drinkability: A world cup beer - meaning I drank five of these watching Portugal play England in the 2006 World Cup and enjoyed each one more than the last. Sessionable, with the hops and malts sours giving a nice finish to an unusually complex beer."
"Pours a rich mohagany color with a nice sized tan head. Moderate lacing and a nice ring atop the liquid. Aroma is great. Really chocolately with toffee nutty undertones and a bit of spice. Flavor does not transcend the aroma however. A bit thinner in the body. Slight caramel but there's an astringency in there. A nail polish remover type taste. Hops are there but not assertive, more fruity. I'd like a bit more bitterness. High hopes but this beer kind of fell apart in the end. Still, it was decent and I'd have another but I wouldn't buy it."
"A little disappointing....I like most of their other beers very much."
"This beer was a deep brown with a decent head. The smell was a bit nutty. The taste was fair for a brown ale. There was no harshness. A pretty smooth beer. I could drink these again on occasion. This beer favored a nut brown ale a good bit. One of the better Brooklyn beers I have had."
"Fantastic beer, a great brown ale to drink in all occasions"
"This beer is smooth, and nicely balanced between the maltiness and the bitter burnt flavors. This was one of the first beers that turned me on to craft brew and its the brown ale by which all other American brown ales should be judged, in my opinion. I mean, some are better, some are worse, but Brooklyn Brown Ale is the standard. Highly recommended."
"Notes: Not too bad but a lackluster beer as far as an AMerican brown when compared to offererings from some other breweries. Better versions of the style (IE Smuttynose and DFH) come readily to mind."
"a decent beer but i liked the brooklyn lager i had earlier better. i would also note i probably served this a bit on the cold side--this beer will do much better i think if served on the warm side. I waited a while after taking from the fridge to open, but more flavor comes out around 60 degrees or so, i'm guessing. the only thing i really didn't like was the finish."
"Brown body with hints of ruby showing when backlit. A nice tan head with decent retenton. I think the aroma is different for this style. Kiind of hoppy, not nutty. Fairly thin mouthfeel, some hop tingle on the tongue, and some nuttiness in the finish. Good carbonation makes it somewhat refreshing. Not a bad beer, just not my favorite style."
"I was a little disappointed in this one. Not much head retention, way too much chocolate for an American brown. A little short for me, especially in the body. Carbonation was good, taste isn't bad and except for being too coffee/toffee/chocolate loaded, it is drinkable. Not one I'll be coming back to anytime soon."
"D - A nice complex brown. This is one I could easily drink several of in one night."
"Overall it is still a beer that you can rely on with a very easy taste to enjoy and clean finish."
"While not exceptional, it is certainly a good American brown ale."
"Drinkability: Very moderate in almost every way, allowing it to be easily quaffable, but the hop kick that i mentioned earlier turns the nice cruise through town into a scenic joyride."
"poured a deep mahogony color with boisterous tannish head. Left very impressive lacing on the side of the glass. Thin surface coating retained throughout. Smell is malty with strong dark fruit essences (plums, prunes, raisins). Taste starts off very fruity with some roasted malt but a distinct hop bitterness begins to come through. Each subsequent taste seems to show hoppiness. Excellent balance. Nice creamy mouthfeel with a firm dry ending. Extremely drinkable. Truly an excellent beer."
"Upon opening the bottle the smell of hops penetrates the air. Dark reddish brown in color with a thick beige head. The first taste is chocolately in flavor. Next comes the malt and hops with a sweet aftertaste. Slight mettalic aftertaste. Highly drinkable. A solid beer. I have a feeling that I would really fall in love with this beer if I had it on draught."
"tried the brew just for the sake that the cooler broke at the local beer store and this was 4 bucks for the sixer. I was pleasantly surprised at the slight coffe and chocolate tastes that this brew has. the head was average and of course darker than the pale ale i usually drink. a wondeful mouthfeel simply because it has a little sweetness and a lot of hopness. not bad to drink at all."
"very nice beer! good any time of year. has more body and flavor compared to new castle. purchased a six pack from a local six pack shop. can easily drink 5 or 6 in session! next time i will definately pick up a case. would also like to try this one on tap!"
"I originaly liked this beer in bottle and regular draft but on cask brings this beer to another level A+ to Brooklyn Brewery"
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. I like alittle more head on my bears so I worked up a nice inch of frothy head on the top. The head holds up for about half of the drinking experience and lets off a beautiful malty aroma. The color is a beautiful dark mahogony. very clear, yet dark. The mouthfeel is clean, not too heavy, a little sugary but not in a bad way. The first thing I noticed is that the flavor wasn't nearly as complex as the aroma made me hope it to be. Caramel maltiness to begin with and leaves a clean citrus hoppy flavor in the mouth. For the price, this is an amazing beer. Its nothing spectacular, but it is a solid brown ale. Very enjoyable and just as drinkable."
"This is neither a poor ale nor an exceptional ale: it is descent brew to give a try if the offerings are slim, but not worth searching out or forgoing a brew you know from experience that you will enjoy. It pours a copper-amber color, with minimal head formation, The smell is hoppy and the taste malty, rather a thick feel on the tongue. There is a stickyness to the palate that is not bad but a bit distracting."
"Overall not bad, but certainly not my favourite of a style I've been drinking a lot of lately."
"12 oz. bottle pours a dark brown that holds a ruby character. An off white head quickly comes and goes. I could not notice much of an aroma, but that may be due to outside factors. The taste starts off with a good roasted malt flavor, hints of hazel, and a carmelized finish. A nice mouthfeel. It has a good, and if not unexpected, flavor for the brown ale variety, but I'm not sure if I could have more than one or two per sitting. A nice beer as usual from those I have tasted from Brooklyn Brewing."
"Biscuitty, coffee, caramel, nutty goodness with the floral hops from the aroma coming through on the finish. Very nice, but being more chewy than normal brewpub clones. The carbonation was more aggressive than needed, making it go down a bit smoother than the malty breadiness would usually lend. Medium bodied and very drinkable."
"Apperance is a medium/dark brown with a half-inch head. The head eventually stays at a thin layer and there is some lacing on the glass throughout. The smell is slightly sweet with traces of chocolate. The taste is a mix of slight chocolate/coffee and subtle nut. Not much bitterness and it's lightbodied, which makes the drinkability high. Love the roasted barley/malt flavor. So robust! Really enjoyed it."
"In all, this is a smooth drinking beer that simply tastes good. It's a good beer for session drinking, not too high of an ABV but good tasting to boot. It's not a great beer to have if you're only having 1, since it doesn't bring a big flavor bat to the plate. Yet it's good, which is as much as you can ask for in a beer."
"This beer was quite unlike what I expected, pleasantly so. I guess I'm not too familiar with American Brown Ales, only English ones. Brooklyn Brown pours a cherry brown with a substantial head that dissipates to nothing in a few minutes. Smell is largely caramel, with a bit of grainy malt. Taste adds some fruity flavors to the caramel and the malt. There's an initial burst of hops, but it's pretty small, and that quickly gives way to the malt. Mouthfeel is pretty light, and the beer overall is highly drinkable, as you might expect from a brown ale. Easy drinking, mild, but not as boring as some of the English browns. This has just enough character to be interesting."
"I won't let the not so great experiences hold me back from trying this beer again, I would like to have it on tap."
"Overall: This is a full-flavored brown ale."
"D - It is drinkable. Definitely is not a bad beer. On the other hand it is not anything exceptional or distinctive. I guess we need average beers to help us appreciate the extraordinary."
"The beer pours a dark brown with a thick off white head with average retention and lacing. The smell is primarily of dark roasted nutty malts. The taste is pretty much the same also. The mouthfeel is also nicely thick with decent carbonation. Overall it is a good brown ale that I would drink again."
"Absolutely nothing wrong with this beer, but nothing special either. This is like Fat Tire to New Belgium or Honkers Ale to Goose Island."
"A Brown with a different flavor profile than most of the style. Unique, pleasant, but not one that I would cite as completely indicative of the style."
"Early on, I wasn't overly thrilled with Brooklyn Brewery beer. The two that I had prior to this one (Pilsner and Lager) were excellent, especially Lager, so my hopes were on the high side for Brown Ale. It's definitely better than average, but better browns shouldn't be that hard to find, no matter where you happen to live."
"As for drinkability, I'm not overly impressed with this. I wouldn't turn down a free glass, but I'm not sure if I would order it again if there were other options."
"4.0's all around for a ""good"" brown ale. Really brown bordering on orangeish red, but still quite attractive. Smells like brown sugar and rum, but not cloyingly so. Nicely browned caramel flavor, everything a brown ale should be, finshing with a very straightforward pure burnt grain flavor and just a kiss of herbaceous hoppiness. Good mouthfeel, and about as good as it gets when drinking pint after pint. This is better on draft IMO, but good in the bottle."
"Coppery brown with a short, rocky, white head that quickly recedes to a ring. Some lacing. Grapefruit hop aroma melds nicely with the doughy malt. There's a bit of brown sugar and chocolate in there too. Malt sweetness dominates, with bitterness rising like a wave in the mid and lingering in the finish. Caramel and molasses fill in the malt flavour and chocolate shows up in the finish. There seems to be a bit of an acidic twang at the end as well. Some dryness, medium-light body with moderate carbonation. A good brown ale. Hops definitely round out the aroma and provide enough bitterness for a bit of balance. But the malts really carry this beer. Nice work!"
"Drinkability: This beer is pretty drinkable. I have little experience with brown ales but this is a good introduction. I would definetly buy this again."
"Pours a dark brown color, with somewhat crimson highlights when held to the light. Theres a blanketing tan head that produces an agreeably pretty lace. The aroma is of caramel and grain. Its notably roasty, with nut, toast, and chocolate characteristics. It's actually a fairly dry beer, more so than I remember. Slight hop aroma. The dryness really emphasizes the roasted malt flavors. The beer has a medium body and a dry, satisfying finish: very drinkable. It doesnt have much of a wow factor, but it certainly is a solidly good brew thats very enjoyable."
"D - This beer is quite easy to drink, thanks in part to its lack of distinguishing character. However, given the rash of ""big"" beers on the market today, Brooklyn does a nice job holding the line and making a true-to-style Brown Ale that's an easy drinker."
"This beer has an additional flavor that I can not put my finger on that does not agree with me."
"12 oz bottle from the winter sampler. Pours a nice looking mahogany red with a finger of beige head, quickly subsides to a ring, little lacing. Smell is very nice, a slight roast, chocolate, caramel with nice floral hops in the background. Taste starts out with nutty and coffee tones, has some nice bready malt, and a slight hop finish. Caramel and chocolate comes through as well at times. Body is on the thin side and carbonation moderate. This is a solid beer from Brooklyn, pretty flavorful for a simple brown ale."
"Cheers!"
"D - I could drink this many times over. It is a bit sweet for a lot of foods, would wash down some stroganof fantastically though. The brown ale is another delight from Brooklyn."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Well carbonated but not in the least detracting... this will work wonders with a burger or other simple beef dishes. A fantastic alternative to lager or pilsners at the next barbecue... Summer can't get here fast enough."
"Pours a fairly deep chestnut color with a 1 finger head and good lace. Smells of a slightly smoky roasted caramel malt. Nutty, vanilla and some slight fruit smells as well. Tates of caramel malt with some hints of brown sugar, vanilla and some rasin and plum. Decent hop flavor and bitterness. If any negative its that it is a bit watery. Finishes dry and I could drink a bunch of these. A good solid beer, but not a great one."
"This is a good American brown ale."
"Drank smooth and had some caramel like flavor with a very lightly bitter after taste that fit the beer quite well. I think I detected some light fruity tones as I finished. Quite satisfying."
" Another solid product from Brooklyn and a solid beer year round but especially in winter. I can see downing a few of these in the ski lodge or after hockey on the pond..mint"
"Brew pours to a dark brownish amber color with a nice sized tan head that has some retention and leaves some lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is of sweet malts that highlight both chocolate and caramel. Very rich and malty smelling brew, very enticing. The taste is of malt, which has a sweet taste with some roasted characteristics. Notice some hop like characteristics at the end but mostly the malt flavors are what I catch. Over all this is a great aromatic brew with good tastes and high drink ability. Fantastic brew, and one of my favorites from Brooklyn Brewery."
"Slàinte!"
"Brooklyn Brown is another great Brooklyn beer - possibly the finest of their year-round brews. Not only does it taste great, but it brings back memories of college and $3 Brooklyns at the Blue and Gold in the East Village. Nice combo."
"I must admit, this isn't what I was expecting, but it's pretty good. The flavors are very slightly watered down a bit, especially the malt character. The hop character isn't out of style, but it IS different. This beer also improves in character as it warms. This is a refreshing beer for a brown ale. Recommended."
"The aroma at first is hoppy, followed by a medium malted smell. There are also tones of nut and citrus. The smell was surprising for a brown ale, but the label states the facts. I expected the taste to be hoppier than it is, but, it was not. In fact, the taste is not hoppy or very bitter at all. There is mild to medium malt flavor along with nuts, followed by a lite hop flavor on the backend. Pretty good flavor and a good beer."
"Drinkability: An excellent American Brown Ale that I would buy again and would also make a nice afforadable session beer."
"Once we nailed the settings it poured a rich mahogany brown. Nice little head. Smells very nutty to me. Taste is wonderful, great balance little hops. Smooth mouthfeel, especially as it warmed up a little. Carbonation was just right. Ideal session beer. Great while watching a game."
"This is a great brown ale and I'd gladly have it again. Recommend for any malt lover. I could drink a lot of this one, it's damn tasty and satisfying."
"A great beer for trying cask-conditioned if you get the chance; bottled Brooklyn Brown - much more common obviously - is good too but never as great as a fresh cask."
"This is a very dark brown ale with a big three finger head.This has a nutty smell with a few spices.The taste is very full.It has a very strong coffee and chocolate flavor,not as nutty as other brown ales.This almost tastes like a porter or stout.This has a real full feel and I can say I will try this again."
"Had 20 ounces of this last night at MacGregors Perinton. The head was nowhere to be seen after it was poured but from bottle experience int eh past i assure there is a nice head. Good lacing. It is a nice cloudy brown color. The aroma was malty and sweet with a decent amount of hops. THe smell mirrors the taste which is of roasted coffee, malts and nuts. It also had a sort of smokey porterlike taste to it. The mouthfeel was moderate and very creamy. Not too heavy though and very drinkable."
"Had this beer in a 12 oz bottle. Brewed in Utica(hate when they fool ya) as said on the label. Also noted that the label read that this Brown is hoppier then its British counterpart, I was dissappointed in that statement. So I moved on hoping for the best. Cracked the bottle, and got a wiff on hops over all. Pours a deep rich brown with nice head fading down the pint glass. First taste was that of hops, bitter on the back of the tongue moving to a carmel malt taste. The hops(as you can see I can't get over) seemed to overpower what I thought was going to be a great Brown. The mouth feel was lighter then that of a Brittish Brown, not one bit creamy. A little weak and dissappointing. Overall, not what I had imagined. I was looking for a great session beer, and got what seems to be a overhyped over hopped typical micro. I will pawn the rest of the case off on some company, maybe that will make them leave earlier."
"Overall = A solid brown ale. Nothing spectacular but drinkable and well brewed. I certainly enjoyed it and would order it again."
"Had this on-tap at Mahogany on Walnut in Center City (Philly). The only brew on-tap and once I tasted it I thought they made a good choice. This brew pours dark brown with a tan-colored head. Good lacing. I instantly detect a nutty chocholate smell with a touch of brown sugar. Very appealing. The taste is not as complex as the smell leads me to believe, but it is still good and enjoyable. As the beer warms, it's nutty character starts to take on different dimensions. Quite smooth for it's style which makes for an easy drink; I could have a few of these without problem."
"355 ml bottle, bought in Denmark. Deep brown colour, large light tan head. Pleasant aroma of dark and dried fruits and caramel, hints of chocolate, tobacco, oak and leather. Nice malty and nutty flavour with some caramel but not too sweet, well balanced with sufficient hops, hints of spices. Easy drinking, refreshing, decent mouthfeel. Moreish."
"Not bad, but not as good as the other Brooklyn Brewery beers that I have had."
"Head is small, dense, thick, white (a little bit cream-colored), frothy. It's almost a little nitro-like. A clear, dark, brown beer with red highlights. Nose is faint, fruity with some toffee. Big toffee taste. Roasty caramel and toffee, toffee, toffee malt! Some chocolate, sweetly fruity and full. A fairly bitter chocolate finish makes this a very nice brown. A little sour fruit at the end, too: nice!"
"I strongly recommend this beer to anyone who is interested in the Brown Ale style. It tasted like the cousin of the Porter, which is one of my favorite styles. The high drinkability of this beer makes it an excellent choice."
"Pretty smooth finish, although drinking 22oz. was a bit much as it started getting a little too warm towards the end."
"cheers"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Roasted malt on the tongue, with a moderate hop presence. A slight sweetness is in there, maybe bittersweet is more accurate. The finish is slightly astringent with some hop bitterness and a little coffee flavor lingering."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. I really enjoy this beer everytime I have it."
"Thanks to RealityDeviant for sending me a few bottles of this."
"12 oz. bottle, best by Sept. '05 - served chilled in a mug. Pours a nice mahogany hue with a 2 finger tan head that takes some time to recede and leaves nice pits and leaves nice rings and patches of lace on the glass. In the nose are almonds, green hops, and chocolate. On the palate there is coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, with a green/piney hop kick that gets more bitter as it warms. It is kinda thick and heavy for a brown but it has a smooth carbonation and feels very nice. An interesting take on a brown - one made for hopheads like me."
"very nice brown."
"As you can see, I'm quite happy with this beer and find it quite drinkable. Goes great by itself and even better with well made food."
"Flavor is sweet with the same thick caramel and chocolate flavors. The hops are a little understated; I felt that the malt was almost too much to not have more malt to hold it in balance. If you dig the caramel flavors, you'll like this one a lot; I just thought it was okay."
"A very nice session beer. A really like all the prominent dark malt tastes in such a lighter bodied beer. Not quite the classic English style brown, but a great beer none the less."
"This brew has quickly become my favorite in the Brooklyn line, which, by extension, makes it my favorite beer in the whole entire universe. Yeah. Soooo, it's packed with flavor and is medium to dark in color. Some say it's drinkability prevents it from being a session beer but I disagree. Drink it, and drink lots of it."
"Body is a tad too light, with a slightly chewy mouthfeel from the dark toasty flavors. Highly sessionable. I bet it's been more than ten years since I had this for the first time, and it still tastes good to me. That is not an easy statement to make with a lot of beers out there."
"Now American/English brown ales have never been my favorite style, but this one is one of the better ones out there. Pours a fairly dark brown, bout 1/2 inch of head on tap. Smell isn't all that special. Taste... some roasted malt/chocolate up front, slightly sweet, slightly hoppy finish. Maybe a tad thin on the mouthfeel but not bad. Quite drinkable, a good session beer for sure. Brooklyn makes much more exciting beers, but this is a solid option that is located in many bars just starting to open up to better beer."
"Taste is a bit one dimensional. Caramel malt and some hops in the finsih and that's it. No depth or richness to the malt and I just don't think the hops mesh well with it. It's a little thin. Not too enjoyable this one. I'll give this Brooklyn offering a miss."
"Pours from the bottle with a small white head. The beer is a dark brown/mahogany/deep amber hue and leaves virtually no lacing on the glass. The aroma is of caramel malt mostly, with undertones of fruit perhaps dark currant and a small amount of milk chocolate and even some lightly roasted coffee. The taste really surprised me because i dont normally expect much complexity or layers in a brown ale but this one is definately not your average brown ale. The taste starts with a caramel malt flavor as well as some dark fruit flavors maybe prunes, currants, grapes or raisins as well as a hint of roasted coffee and ends with a bittersweet dark chocolate like finish that lingers in your mouth for a few seconds. Really a well structured brown ale, I'm surprised I liked it as much as i did because i havent really been a big brooklyn fan until now but this beer is like newcastle with balls. One of my favorite brown ales."
"My only qualm with this was that the alcohol wasnt hidden a well as I wouldve liked. Overall a good brew."
"Drinkability: Certainly a decent Brown Ale, but I would like to see a bit more body"
"Drinkability: It's a little sweeter than I'd hoped, which makes it more of a dessert-type beer for those who don't enjoy stouts as much as ""lighter"" beers, if that's the right word. Maybe ""lighter"" beers I suppose. Overall it's definitely worth trying, for either the curious or the brown ale fan."
"Reminds me of a darker, sweeter Brooklyn lager. Definately worth a try but once you have had it you'll probably want to experiment with other things or go with beers that fall in with your old standards."
"Nice looking brown colour, not much taste and from a bit of bitter and malts. Aggressively carbonated. Ok with food, medium mouthfeel with a spot of nuttiness.Skunky aroma, it may have travelled about but was always kept at good temperature, and before expiry date."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but light as per the style. A decent example, would be better if not for the slight acrid aftertaste that leaves it just a little unpleasant. I like my brown ales more on the ""brown"" side and less on the hoppy end. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for sharing this one."
"Ill say up front, this beer surprised me. The color is deep brown with garnet highlights. A medium head settles quickly and leaves virtually no lace on the glass. The aroma is caramel and toffee delivered via the malt. The caramel character comes strong in the flavor with some fig. Very malty brown ale. The malt flavors reminded me of a good Oktoberfest. Smooth rich flavor with a mild citrus grapefruit hop kick. Very smooth mouth feel very drinkable. Im not a brown ale fan, but this is a good representation."
"Pours a medium dark brown with some head that dissipates rapidly. Very slight nut notes in the aroma. Taste is light, with some nut or coffee undertones. Slightly sweet. Mouthfeel was quite thin, with all the sweetness it would have been nice to have a little fuller feel. Drinkability was fine, though the flavor might irritate after a few. I usually have Brooklyn Lager and then a Brown Ale when I'm watching a game and don't want to dip into the high end brews."
"One of the better American brown ales I've sampled, but I still don't favor the style. This one exudes quality, and would be excellent with blue cheeses."
"Overall: This is an excellent beer, possibly my favorite brown ale that I have tried to date. If you're a fan of the style this one's a must. Even if you're not give it a try."
"Halfway between a dirty peanut and an earthworm. Muted musty cedar. Splash of weak caramels and cheap black tea. Thin sweet nut-skin finish. I just don't get it. Thin, bland sweetness. I have tried this one on a number of occasions and although it strikes me a little differently each time, and is usually better on draft, I never really enjoy it."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with a freshness dating of ""best before Jan '05."" Good thing I opened this the first week of January. The beer pours a dark reddish brown with a light head on it that rings the glass. Even with swirling a true head does not develop. The aroma was just messed up on this beer. I don't know if it was a bad bottle or what, but it had a funky blue cheese smell to it. I love ripened cheeses, but not when they are eminating from my beer. It was about as attractive as a big piece of spinach stuck in between a woman's teeth. Luckily this beer had some redeeming flavor to combat the off-putting aroma. The flavor is sweet wiht alcohol flavors up front followed by a soft, smoky, and almost Belgian malty flavor. That blue cheese did creep into the flavor a bit though. Too bad. There was very little contribution of hops to celebrate. This beer was soft on the palate despite being offensive to the nose."
"Drinkability: 2 to 3 bottles in one sitting. After three, you won't be able to finish the rest of the sixer."
"Notes: Amazing aroma, but the beer was fairly bland. Body could use some work too."
"Thanks to css for providing this beer!"
"Nothing especially exciting, easy drinking and easy to drink several of, however."
"Boy is this one good on cask. Mouthfeel is awesome. Smooth and creamy on the palate. Well hopped which is typical for american brown ales but this brew kicks butt. Warming alcohol is definitely there but it just goes down so smooth. Dry finish. A good beer from the bottle but excellent on cask."
"A good barbeque beer."
"This is not at all what I expected. New Castle is sweet and light, and Dogfish Head is dense and too dry. Nice happy medium. Pours a nice garnet-red-brown with a creamy three finger head that leaves plentiful lace as it recedes. Smell is of malt, with a little yeast, barely any hops. Taste is sweetish with coffee and chocolate and a dry finish. This is a balanced beer that I could quaff regularly. A good session."
"A very solid brown ale. Pours with a dark, ruby color and a nice head. A lovely beer to look at. The taste is a mix of malt, brown sugar, coffe and a hint of chocolate. The drink is smooth, almost velvety and has the perfect amount of carbonation. More than worth a quaff or two."
"First imperial pint glass pours with a dense tan 1 1/2"" head, which was slowly dissipates, leaving heavy lace/foam along the glass. Clear and deeply reddish brown in hue. Well-balanced aroma, with medium malts pairing with a pleasant hoppy tinge. Taste is nutty malts, with slight hops character in the mouth. Some light fruit and citrus notes finish the picture. Mouthfeel is smooth, oh so smooth, and the drinkability is excellent as well. Nice represenation of the style, and I would search it out again."
"Clear and dark brown color, with thick, artificial-looking foam. Sweet, gingerbread malt nose, potent and sharp. Taste jibes well with the smell, sweet and malty, with some gingerbread spiciness and body. Full and flavorful taste stops clean before significant dryness sets in. Seems very well developed and consistent. Excellent beer to have more than one of, like many of Brooklyn's offerings, great balace of taste, drinkability, and value."
"This brew is light/medium in body, and has a smooth and mildly crisp start with a smooth finish. The caramel tone lasts briefly on the tongue. Extremely drinkable - a great session brew."
"If you don't like sweet, malty brews you will certainly not enjoy this one. I consider myself to be a ""maltophile," and I really would like to pick up some more of this soon. Another winner from Brooklyn."
"This brown ale did not have the characteristics I prefer in this type of beer -- hints of nuts and chocolate, nice lacing around the glass, and very easy to drink. A little too hoppy for my taste with malt flavor. Appears nice on tap and at $2.50 a pint, I would continue to purchase, just not on the top of the list for brown ales."
"This is very complex for a beer of such modest strength. An outstanding choice if you are in search of a brown ale."
"The pour is deep chestnut with a solid two finger head-generous lace and solid stick. Aromas are at once sweet, sticky hop with a bit of toasted malt for balance. In the mouth the beer is a bit flabby with sweet hoppy, sticky malt flavors as well as roasted undertones never quite getting cleaned up. Flavors are generous with fruity notes followed by caramel, toasty malt and tangy hop. A rather complex brown that with a bit more zip would be quite tasty."
"Brooklyn Brown was served from a 12oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a rich mahogany color and was adorned by an ample tan head that left nice lacing. The nose was mildy sharp with raisiny-cocoa coffeeish maltiness. On the palate, a sharp, lightly roasty tasty coffee malt profile released a zingy toffee-like edge in the transtition to a nicely astringent, roasty-bittered finish that left lingering sweet coffee flavors. The body was a bit light though smooth, and the vigorous carbonation lent a good energy to the middle flavors. Brooklyn Brown is a tasty brew that I would enjoy again."
"I haven't tried very many brown ales beyond Newcastle and Dogfish Head, but this is a very good beer. A little on the sweet side for my taste, and could be a little more balanced, but an awesome one to bring out on friends who ""don't like dark beers."" Another strong offering from the Brooklyn Brewery."
"Bender Factor: This poor example was on sale recently for $2.50/ pint at my local watering hole, I wonder why. Never again."
"Nice amber/rootbery medium dark and clear. Not much head, tiny bit of white rint around the edge with a dusting in the center. Mainly malty scents, lightly dark.. Tastes of roasted malts, darkened toast, bit of merlot. Med/highly carbinated, almost soda-like... just a step below maybe? Or as if you let your soda sit for a bit... carb is just a tad high feeling on this for me... Easy drinker though, not too heavy at all, and the flavors are very nice and not too intense, just very good and highly drinkable."
"I don't care for brown ales as a general rule but this was definitely worth the purchase. It may be good as a transition beer for beginners."
"Nice brown color with a slightly foamy head. Smell was pleasant, a slight roasty overtone. Taste was smooth, maybe even a little nutty, well balanced and quite pleasant. This would be a great brew for a keg-based function or as a session choice. One of the better brown ales out there."
"Pours a copper to brown color with a beige head. Some caramelly malt aromas, nutty and inviting. Hops are reasonably fair in this beer, working to balance out the sweet and roasty malt aromas. Nutty and smooth, with some residual sugars and a slight hop bitterness in the finish. Dead wet leaves, and other earthy notes come to mind. Reasonably thin tasting and pleasantly drinkable. Probably on of the better brown ales from the U.S."
"This poured an attractive dark and burgundy brown color. Clear, with glowing cherry-mahogany highlights shining through when held up to the light. A creamy tan head topped the beer off. The aroma is rich and dark with caramel, chocolate and roasted grains. Theres a slight alcohol spiciness and a sweet roasted oats bran note. Warming and inviting. The taste is sharp and rich with bittersweet chocolates, and full of roasted notes. Light to medium in body. The finish is clean, complex and satisfying. This still remains the quintessential American Brown Ale."
"Final Thought: Not too shabby, a heavier tasting brown ale that works..."
"Overall: A very decent brown ale. This is one of the better beers I've had from Brooklyn Brewery. This is a very flavorful beer, yet very accessible as well. Recommended."
"This is my least favorite style, but truly....this is acrid, horrible stuff. This qualifies as ""down-the-sink"" material. Stay away."
"This brew looks rich. Poured a deep mahogany, a bit darker than the other browns I've tried. Finger thick cream colored head that lasted a few minutes. Rich nutty/raisin scent, dark fruit. Reminsent of a few doppelbocks I've had, which got me to thinking if the two weren't that different stylistically. Of course this an ale and the other is a lager.. Mouthfeel was sufficiently carbonated, slightly syrupy. Seemed to fit the style. Taste was quite complex, way more flavorful than I expected. Initial raisin note turns crisp as alcohol warms then ends with a bitter hop presence. Very drinkable. This one ended up being a real treat."
"This beer pours a clear deep brown/mahogany with a small tan head. The smell is not that strong but I can pick up a toasted nuts/ coffee scent if I try real hard. The taste is great. Hints of coffee and dark cocoa. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich. The drinkability is outstanding. Very tasty and easy to drink."
"12 ounce bottle, best before dating of August 04. Pours almond skin brown, clear, off white head, leaving some lace. yeasty, bready nose. Soft caramel, nutty, coffee flavor notes. Nice subtle maltyness. Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation. Hops well in background, mellow , with a slight grainy texture. Very drinkable, pleasant quaffer."
"Light tan head falls upon clear brown liquid. Soft, fresh Cascade hop nose. Nice roastiness mixes with the flowery hop character creating a nice bittersweet flavor profile. Finishes a little thin, with pleasant roasted malt flavor but the thinness doesn't detract from the enjoyability of this great brown ale."
"my overall impression of this beer is good, but not great."
"Almost thin palate with sweetness on the finish."
"On the palate it is very dry. I gather this is the result of some virulent, hyperactive yeast strain that wants to leave not a trace of sugar in the broth. This is vanguard, indoor beer, for intellectuals. Lingual pressure and warmth elicit a sliver of citrus peel sweetness, but it never comes close to rewarding the punishment of the powdered bone-like, dry hop tannins."
"Overall, a nice, drinakable brown ale. It reminded me of a cross between a New Belgium Abbey and a porter."
"This is a very smooth beer that went well with my dinner and was very easy to drink. I will buy this one again."
"Good Brown Ale. I could pound a few."
"This is one I can drink all night, and have."
"Starts a bit thin despite the obvious malt flavors and the mild roasted presence. Builds character as its story develops across the palate. Almost American Pale Ale like in its acidic, piney hop finish. Roasted bitterness and toffee notes compliment. This is originality to be sure. Obviously, this beer's been around for a while, but I can't see how this wasn't a trendsetter when it was first released. It's not going to knock any big Belgians off the top of my all-time faves list, but this is immensely quaffable and surprisingly interesting."
"Hazel color with reddish hues and a decent foamy head. Smells of earthy tones and a overall nutty character. Very smooth tastes of roasted malts backed up with a bite. There is a slight hop bitterness to round out this beer and it finishes with a mellow nut fell and again earthy malts. This goes down fairly easy and is a pretty well done brown ale but maybe at bit dry in the aftertaste."
"Beef Notes: This is one of the beers that I was into when I started drinking better brews. I still like it and have a bit of a soft spot for it, but it's not like I remember it."
"Poured a beautiful cream colored head that fine and froathy and left a coat (cant call it lace without holes can ya?) Deep dark brown in color, almost black towards the top of the pint glass with a slight cola glow. Rich coco aromas with a caramel malt backdrop. Coco flavors up front followed closely by a mild coffee bitterness and finishing a with a bit of caramel. The mouthfeel is mild, nothing at first and then towards the end its kind of cloying, coating your tongue with flavor as the beer disappears. Doesnt seem to be as hoppy as the bottles, but I could drink this all night long."
"Pours out to a dark brown in the glass with a decent, sized, light, brown head. Aroma is that of malt. It smells fresh. The taste is excellent with malt exploding in the mouth. Not as hoppy as some other Brown Ales (Bell's Best Brown comes to mind), but the malt sweetness really shines through. This is a very easy-to-drink beer and a definite credit to the style."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It is rich in roasted and crystal malts. It has an intense chocolate smell as well. The taste is good. It is smooth and creamy with a great ""brown"" flavor created through the use of multiple crystal malts. It also has a decent hop taste that peeks through the malts. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an awesome brown ale with real malt character; a great sessions ale."
"A very nice refreshing brown ale that is a great example of the American style."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability: A good beer, not my favorite brown ale, but definitely worthy of attention."
"Bitter, but not too earthy, and very drinkable."
"Medium feel, smooth and pleasant. A good, not too-simple, not too-complicated session beer."
"The taste is average, which for another brewery is ok but not Brooklyn. They have set the bar quite high with other offerings and this doesn't measure up. It has a nice little blend of toasted and caramel malt, but then it just does nothing. No character to me outside of that first wave of malt. I'm bummed. At least they have about six other beers I love."
"The bottle pours a lovely color brown like a chocolate labrador retriever into the pint glass. Nice foamy head that stays the whole pint. The nose is adequate, but the tatse of nuts, like a Mary Jane candy, linger well after the first mouthful and makes me want to guzzle another. I choose to drink slowly and the aroma and flavors improve as the beer warms. When the glass is empty, I am looking forward to hitting the fridge for the next bottle. I could easily poich off the whole six, but work tomorrow prevents it. Well, I'll wait until tomorrow to finish them off."
"An excellent brown ale. Probably my favorite american interpretation."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head into my 16 oz Brooklyn Brewery pint glass. Decent sized head settles down leaving a small layer of foam on top which leaves some nice lacing down the side of the glass. Smell and aroma of chocolate and slight coffee. Solid roasty, malt background balanced nicely with a good hop finish. This medium-bodied beer is very drinkable. This was Brooklyn's first holiday beer back in the late '80's and was soon added as the second beer in their line-up."
"Thanks to 36LbLoveChild for this one."
"This beer poured a mahogany brown color that when held to the light it showed hues of ruby. It was crystal clear and well carbonated. The head that was produced was a mix of light tan and beige colors, fairly thick, dense and fluffy at first pour, then fell to just a ring on the edges that seemed to be fairly thick as well. The lace that was produced was a sheety consistency. The aromas that came from the glass started off with a plum/berry fruit like aroma mixed in with a sweet malt, then it dried out and scents of ash, cocoa powder and some roasted coffee became noticeable, it finished with a hint of grain on the end. The flavors that I tasted began with roasted malt with tads of sweetness, in the middle it waived with some dry ash and sweet fruit, close to the finish cocoa powder, light hops and coffee and it finished with a barky leafy grain taste. (Hard to explain, as it warmed the finish became a mix of the 3). The after taste was of roasted malt and light hops. The body was on the medium side. This is a clean crisp, complex and at times dry beer. As it warmed the flavors became more pronounced and complex. They melded together well and was a pleasure to drink."
"On draught at Winking Lizard (w/ a logo glass!). Dark mahogany color with a thin beige head. Thin and slow lacing. The aroma is roasty and malty. Medium body with a nice smooth malt and caramel flavor. There is a mildy nutty aftertaste with a bit of hops thrown in. All in all this is a smooth and drinkable Brown."
"poured with a deep brown color with a good thick light tannish head. chocolate malty aroma with a little bit of hops. very well balanced with a thick chewy mouthfeel, has a little biscuity taste too it. the body isn't overly thick or heavy though just the right balance to keep this a very refreshing brown. the hops are very well balanced with the malt, gotta say that this might be the best brown ale I've tasted so far."
"Medium brown color. Foamy biege head. Nice looking beer in the glass. Toasted carmel malt smell. Taste is much the same. Very good toasted malt up from, then toffee. Kinda like hard candy. Attention grabbing hop bite for the middle drinks, then fades. Wierd but good. Medium bodied, very drinkable beer. A solid, tasty brew, one I look forward to having again soon. But for now, I'm out again."
"This is a beer that I like to keep in the fridge for any ol time. It has a good head (about three quarters of an inch) with decent staying power. A thick, somewhat sticky lace eventually forms on the surface and also lingers for quite a while. The beer pours a clear dark copper brown and has a medium body with not too much carbonation. The aroma is nice and malty sweet with notes of caramel and chocolate. Hops are in the aroma also, but are much more restrained. There is a smooth malty start in which the caramel and chocolate notes from the aroma are quickly noticeable on the pallet. Some roastiness is also noticeable towards the end. Again, hops are fairly subdued, but noticeable in the finish, yet the malt base is still strong with a smooth end. The lingering aftertaste is of both hops and roasted malt notes. At times the end seems smoother, while at others it seems have a bit more of a hop bite. A very well balanced and drinkable beer."
"Flavor: This brown ale is quite a bit more hoppy than most. However, it's nicely balanced and tasty."
"An above average brown ale that carries the trademark look and feel of the brown ale style. Lovely brown body with a creamy, but small head. The aroma is light but thoroughly malty and the flavor is mild and a bit on the sweet side. The feel tends to be a bit thin and watery. Overall, this is a solid if not great beer."
"Very nice chocolate appearance with nice bubbly head, Smell was balance between malt and hop aromas. Taste had hints of coffee with a light watery aftertaste. Mouthfeel was a bit odd, starting medium and ending somewhat light and watery. Not bad on a drinkability scale....a hint of a stout here."
"Pours a deep ruby color with a slight head. Aroma is malty and slightly chocolatey. Taste is of caramel and molassass up from with a hoppy finish. Definately an American brown ale. The mouthfeel I feel is a little overcarbonated for the style. There is also some warming alcohol in the mouthfeel which I feel makes it seem a bit strong for the style (although 5.2% is hardly strong, it seems so for this particular beer.)"
"Notes: A good alternative to the Newcastles of the world, and would make a beautiful bridge beer for that potential BA we all know."
"It's a brown ale for crying out loud. There's nothing too impressive or oppressive abouth this beer. It's light brown color and medium body is full of malts in the first few sips but it quickly fades as the beer warms and the flavor seems to subside and become one brown mass. Low ABV leads to a good session beer as it almost runs the gamut of being a mild ale much like the British ales."
"This beer was a dark brownish color with a moderate tan head. It had a bitter taste to it and had hints of coffee and chocolete in it. The head disappears rather quickly and leaves some lace on the glass. This beer was ok, but I probably wouldn't get it again soon."
"It just seemed very different then what I am used to in brown ales, not very sweet, very hoppy. As it warmed up the hops dominated even more and I liked it less. Not horrible though, just not what I was expecting."
"To me, had the exact mouthfeel for the style: thin in the British session ale tradition. Thus, it's excessively drinkable as adherence to the style should dictate. Great on tap in NYC, good in bottles. A good beer to always have around, and excellent for wooing the ignorant into beerdom. This is my standard for the style."
"I got this with a sampler case so I could try a couple styles for the forst time. Pours a rich, dark brown with a nice 1/2 inch head. First taste the rich maltiness, nutty, coffee flavor. Enough hops to balance without being overbearing. Very drinkable any time of year for me. On my list of ""must stock"" beers."
"Clear, ruddy deep chestnut in hue. Thick, persistent, dense tan head leaves lace. The aroma is predominantly of dry baker's chocolate and stately toffee along with faintly floral hops. Tame. Biscuit and burnt bread upfront in flavor ensued by mellow cocoa and an herbal tinge of hops. Salty, lightly mineral notes mid palate along with hints of whole wheat cracker. Mild hop bitterness. Light, crisp, with well calculated attenuation and residual dextrins. Finishes mostly clean and dry, with fleeting hints of molasses and savory biscuit. A no frills drinkable brown with enough character to keep the palate interested. Tasty, but mostly unremarkable."
"the mouthfeel is decent in that it is thick enough of the slight richness. drinkability is good, it's nice and easy and not too rich."
"Dark brown color, with a reddish tint. The head goes away quickly, but provides decent lacing. Smells very nutty and complex. Wonderful aroma. Tastes clean, a little light, but very, very drinkable. One of the best ""all night"" beers made by Brooklyn Brewery."
"Best by July 2002 about a year ago, so I will take this into account. Just I will not pour this beer out, must sample and see how it holds up. Appears a very deep amber ruby brown with a cream toffe head very nice looking full three finger sized head that as it dwindles leaves even pattern of trickled lace. Aroma consists of pine cone like hops and a slightly burnt malt character. The two aromas blend fairly well, to form an overall pleasant aroma. The taste is a bit worn by the age, but I can still detect a slightly vinous grap character blended with a mild chocolate/coffe tone and the hop bitterness works well together. Overall one very nice session beer that I will try again due to the age of this one."
"""The Pre-Prohibition Beer."" Shiny cordovan in color with a nice off-white head and trails of sticky lace. Sweet malt and hops aroma with a light fruity bouquet. The malt is caramel sweet and slick. Abundantly hopped with citrusy bitterness and some back of the throat bite. A hint of chocolate and coffee peek through the velvety texture making for an easy to drink brew."
"Darkish, reddish-brown, good depth, smallish beige head, a little less than a fingers worth, soapy retention, some unorganized lace. The aroma seems a tad muted, nicely hoppy, spicy, floral, malty, unsweetened chocolate. Awesome palate, it makes you rethink what a brown ale can be, bittering hops establishes the flavor profile with subsequent toasty malts, floral, pine, spiciness very well constructed. Unbalanced, leans towards the hops but the caramelized influences create a nice linger aftertaste. Dry finish, leafy. Ideal carbonation, excellent mouthfeel, medium-bodied. This is a very impressive brown ale, recommended thanks stegmakk for the sample!"
"A deep unblurred sangrineous color on the pour, the head portly in size, spumescent in texture, a winsome light beige in color and a thick sticky sheet of lace to conceal the glass. The nose is sweet malt, crisp and slightly floral, a real treat for the old schnozzle with a rich malt start that is somewhat sweet, and the top fair to middling in feel. Finish has a perky acidic bite, the hops pounce on your palate, like the Brooklyn Dodgers did the Yankees? Quite dry aftertaste and a real sweetheart of a beer and a real keeper in my book."
"One of the first things that struck me about this brown ale was that it looked almost predominantly red, rather than brown. The actual combination of these two colors makes for a rather impressive appearance, along with the small but consistent head. A sweet, alcoholic odor mixed with a subtle roasted fragrance. The same sweetness, coupled with a caramel or toffee flavor comprised this ale's particularly complex taste. Bitter hints were also present, along with a bit of a yeasty or grainy taste towards the end. This ale could have been fuller, however, especially to complement the more complex taste. Nothing beyond average in the mouthfeel of this beer, unfortunately. Overall, the Brooklyn Brown Ale had a good, sweet, somewhat roasted taste that allows for a continuously pleasurable drinking expereince. The beer tastes good, and will not disappoint fans of a darker ale."
"This brew has a wonderful flavor. Sweet maltiness precedes mellow caramel and chocolate flavors. I could and would drink this all night. Great aftertaste as well, as others have mentioned. Possibly my favorite brown ale...however this does not surprise me as I have only had one other brown ale on tap...Newcastle. Eh, right? Brooklyn's effort is applauded! This is a smooth, malty, flavorful beer. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
"Pours a medium brown with ruby hints to it, medium white head, minimal lacing. Aroma is doughy, chocolate, some nuttiness showing through, and a very minimal hop note towards the end. Flavor is mainly chocolate, some caramel, mildly hoppy finish. Fairly thin in the mouth, feels smooth due to light carbonation."
"A thing of beauty in the glass -liquid mahogany. A little more hopped-up than the English variety of brown ale, but still retained a fairly mineral crispness. I think brown ales in general get shortchanged because they strive for a certain balance, rather than grabbing attention with excess or novelty. This is a well-crafted brown with good drinkability - I would happily drink more."
"Poured a dark amber/copper with a little hazy color a thick white head that is gone within seconds. A sweet malt aroma is giving off. Taste is similar to the smell sweet malts a slight hint of hops and some caramel. A bit of carbonation on the tongue a smooth taste with an easy going drinkability. A good beer but nothing special about this. Was expecting a little more from this."
"Pours a real dark orange. Gives off a decent off white head. Doesnt leave much of a lace. Aroma was a bit nutty but mostly malt, somewhat sweet. Taste was the nose. A nutty malt flavor. A bit dry and bitter at the finish. Nothing to crazy but over all an OK beer."
"This cask conditioned ale poured a clear, dark, chocolate brown color with good, creamy, light tan foam. The smell was modest and was mostly floral hops. The taste was initially floral hops, but then chocolate malt and sweet caramel malt flavors poked through. There was a bit of floral hops in the finish. The mouthfeel was very smooth and clean, with a slight chocolate aftertaste. This was a very drinkable brown ale from cask!"
"A tasty brown ale with nice maltiness, and a very good hop load....pours a cherrywood in color....tan creamy lace...nose is spicy hoppy...leathery...tobacco....medium bodied for the most part but at times it feels a little thin.....soft caramel malt backbone but the hops are what really stand out.....same as the nose...spicy...leafy...leathery...very nice hop flavor....finishes on a dry note....a very good Brown Ale that leans more hoppy than malty...."
"A well-presented chocolate brown brew with an off-white head that stays very well and leaves lots of lace. I'm glad I poured this perfectly, it's the only bottle I've got and it's not available in my area. I was only able to get this thanks to francisweizen! Anyway, on to the aroma. Certainly smells like a well-hopped beer, I'm getting hints of earthy and leafy hops. Chocolate malt makes itself known quickly, combining very well with the hops. A bit of grainy malt character is detectable under all of this. As for the flavors, it looks like we've got a winner in this department too. Hops are really leafy throughout, hitting their peak in the middle of the palate. Chocolate malt is the major player on the sweetness side, making itself known best at the front and back. Rind-like hop bitterness balances things out. Crisp, dry finish. Nice medium body, but flavorful. Not much complexity, but this is a good, solid beer that will satisfy your palate well. Easy drinking and refreshing, it would make a good session beer. I'd definitely get this again."
"A good product. Not overwhelming in any sense--good or bad-- but a beer that you can drink any time. I brought a six-pack over to 2 different friend's houses (people who don't understand good beer-- and they were both against trying it, preferring their Amstels or Buds) but they were both like ""wow"" when they tried the Brooklyn Brown. It will not turn off those who normally drink tasteless from beers from the big breweries. For fellow beer advocates: don't look for this beer to knock your socks off but it will satisfy and quench your beer desire."
"This is very well-balanced and drinkable; as others have said, it would make an excellent session beer."
"Many different people have selected this beer from the store I work in, and I figured that it was just a trendy thing, since not too many people actually pick good ones, but I am glad I finally got it. A friend said, you haven't had this, Give it a whirl, so I did. You gotta have this one."
"and nice hop character for a brown. Well done for an American brown lower alcohol brew, easy easy to drink. Thanks to Francisweizen for the bottle."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It seems a lot more assertive than most other browns I've tried. Vey dark amber/ruby in color, with almost no head at all. Aroma is dominated by rich caramel malt, with a nuttiness than becomes more assertive as the beer warms. The flavor is quite terrific. Starts with a sweet caramel malt, develops some chocolatey notes mid-palate, then gives way to a satisfyingly bitter hop finish. Just when you think it's over, a surprisingly roasty aftertaste kicks in, lending an extra dryness to the finish and leaving you yearning for another sip. Medium-full in body, this was quite an enjoyable beer."
"I would highly recommend this beer to just about anyone: from BA to swill-drinker. It's also a good bargain at $5-6 per six-pack. Just one of the best beers you can ever get at that price."
"Drinkability: Slight alcohol taste, but drinks very easy. I would have no problem drinking this all night."
"Nice color very little head,nice chocolaty aroma.Nice malty/cocolate flavors with earthy undertones just like a good brown should be.Finished nicelel didnt thin out towards the end like alot of brown ales do.Really enjoyed will have again,hopefully soon."
"F"
"Coper brown beer that poured with a minimal head. Looks like it may have been off white in color. The aroma is sweet and nutty, inviting you to take a drink. The atse exhbits a strong citrus hope note, then the malt, somewhat dry background. As the beer warms, chocolate notes are evident on the finish. The mouthfeel is solid and enjoyable. The hoppiness adds to the drinkability, and creates an original brown offering for Brooklyn that represents the style, but duplicates nothing I've had before. Nice beer that I will buy again."
"Reddish brown color. Slight white head. Sweet malt nose. Medium to fuller mouth for a brown . Big roast malt flavor that coats the mouth and throat. Slight cream flavored finish to the taste. Nice and Roasty Brew!"
"Brown with generous ruby edges that work well in towards the center. Off-white head that lingers as it should. This has a good thick taste, malts, some hops to balance, and an appropriate nutty flavour. It's less nutty but tastier than Newcastle. A ""good"" beer, entirely deserving of its rating. I've had better, but it's easier to find worse than better... so this is a recommendation."
"Mahogany color with zero head (maybe a bad pour by the bartender). Aromas of caramel malt and floral hops. Medium carbonation. Sturdy body. Very, very well balanced. Brown sugary malt offset by a leafy hop presence. Clean finish. Another winner from the Brooklyn Brewery."

"One of my favorite Brown Ales and the one that I use to introduce most people to the style."
"Clear. Deep russet brown with ruby highlights. The frothy, light tan head holds fairly well and drops to a decent collar which leaves some good lace. The aroma is surprisingly full, loaded with rich, bready maltiness and spicy, floral hops. The body is medium-light with a gentle carbonation that makes it lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor displays a gently fruity, lightly toasty, and toffee-like malt that's well backed by bitterness and a light piney hop flavor. The finish is dry and lingering with hop bitterness, chocolatey maltiness, a soft roastiness and a light nuttiness reminiscent of wanut or almond. It's unfortunate, but I've had better versions of this. This is also a fresh bottle, but that's the way it goes with contract brewing. I highly recommend the draft version over the bottle."
"Deep dark brown with a frothy, light brown head. Excellent lacing - clings in sheets to the glass. The nose is malt sweet, with some hop floral tones. Starts malt, the middle is medium, the finish is dry and hop bitter. There are also carmel and nut flavors, plus a slight herbal taste. Nice and flavorful."
"Pours a nice copper / amber color with tan head. On the nose there are aromas of toasted bread and caramel malt.Pretty dry/smooth mouthfeel. On the palate there is more toasted bread, caramel, chocolate, sweet/but no overly sweet, nutty, slight hop bitternessemm good. Nice full flavored brown ale"
"PS - If this is what beers tasted like before prohibition, damn us all to Hell for what this nation's beer has become!"
"Brown Ale:  maple syrup aroma, and look.  Very little head on this tapped beer.  This beer had a substantial malt sweetness, that did remind me of Mrs. Butterworth’s in the aftertaste.  Great with spicy jalapeno poppers."
"Pours a dark ruby with a nice creamy head. There are some nice malt tones in the aroma as well as hop accents. Some chalky cocoa powder on the nose as well. There are some nice tastes present. Like chocolate malt, cocoa and hop bitterness. I have come across few brown ales that make me stop and take note....and this isn't one of them. It's an o.k. beer from one of my least favorite styles."
"Pours a nice amber/brown with a creamy head and a nice clinging lace.  Smells of light chocolate, caramel, and some malt.  Sweet malt taste with some caramel and some faint bittersweet chocolate.  Light earthy hops provide a nice bittering compliment to the sweetness.  Creamy and smooth on the tongue and very drinkable.  I really like this beer.  A great session brew.  Also, it has just the right amount of body that it is light enough for the summer and heavy enough for the winter."
"I don't know if it is the hops or what, put basically, for me, this beer is just too bitter. It smashed me over the head with bitterness, no balance, and not the usual good bitter taste that I find in so many other brews. I could be talking out my ass here, but I think they used too much roasted malt which imparts a rather bitter taste to begin with, then made the all too common American mirco brewer mistake of WAY to much hop bitterness. It's over the top and in my opinion it is too much. Definitely not what I expected. I think it could be more balanced. Not my style."
"Just had this on draft.  Much more flavorful than the now-toned-down Pete's Wicked.  Good balance of maltiness & hops - very full taste."
"Very mellow,  great malt flavor.  Has enough hops to keep it interesting"
"Notes: A nice modern day American Brown Ale. On the dry side, but packed with a fullness of flavours."
