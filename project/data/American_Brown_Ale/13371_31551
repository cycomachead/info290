Aroma of chocolate malts and caramel, some dark fruit notes going on as well. This beer can be a bit inconsistent I've found. This particular bottle I think may have been off. There was the typical characteristics of a brown ale here, dark malts, somewhat roasty, caramel sweetness, but also an underlying fruity taste that was sort of in the acetaldehyde / cidery range. Not really sure what was going on here, and it's been a while since I've had this beer, so I can't really compare it to past tastings. Medium body, pretty smooth, but again, a bit messy, off, inconsistent. Worth a try, but definitely not one of Voodoo's best.","Rifugium","Mar 26, 2014"

Pours crystal clear dark brown color with a nice dense 2-3 fingers of light tan head with great retention that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap that lasts forever. Some nice lacing clings around the glass as well. Aromas of roasted malt, caramel, bread, apple skin, light dark fruit, chocolate, and some molasses. I think it is safe to say my bottle might be a bit infected. The apple skin aroma just throws everything off. Taste quite a bit better: big caramel, toasted malt, biscuit, chocolate, bitter coffee, molasses, nuttiness, and spiciness. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, molasses, bread, nuttiness, and spices. Nice balance of flavor and bitterness. A bit of a metallic flavor is present as well. Medium bodied with big full carbonation; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel with big prickly carbonation. Overall for probably being infected, this is an ok brown ale. I will definitely give it another shot sometime, the bomber is only 6 bucks.","superspak","Nov 14, 2011"

I could not finish the glass and don't think I would risk trying another one if I had to pay for it. This just doesn't taste much at all like the Wynona's Big Brown I had before that inspired me to recently pick up this bottle to review. The sample I had before had much more residual sweetness and a much brighter hop character to it. Perhaps this is just an old bottle? Who knows, there is no way to tell how fresh it is since there is no date code. However, the excess carbonation and off character to this brew makes me suspect something might be off with this bottle. I don't know if it provides any benefit since there is no bottle/date code, but this particular bottle had a gold cap.","stakem","Dec 11, 2010"

Aroma has the dark semi sweet cocoa and coffee blend with a nut bread edge to it. Herbal hops reach out and grab your senses as well. A touch of anise black licorice grabs ahold as well. Flavor carries it out nicely with complex black roasted malts and chewy brown ale notes, mild coffee with herabl rolling hops and again more of the black licorice kick in the finish.

That aspect of it just doesn't gel extremely well with its malty base and seems to mask some of its other flavors too much. Carbonation could also use a tweak. It's excessive as it is. All in all, I like the concept and the overall result is a success. The execution isn't perfect, but it does the job. As a side note, any Primus fan will appreciate the opportunity to try this beer.

Getting some nuts and grain as well plus some chocolate and even less coffee from the roasted malt bill. The body is even bolder than I expected for a typical brown ale so there is no problems there.

Lots of maltiness in the aroma, caramel with a little bit of dark grains, mild chocolate, more burnt than roast, with just a hint of smoke. Hops stayed in the background, but were definitely present. Solid bitterness both from hops and a little from the dark grain. Malty without being overly sweet, but with plenty of caramel and toffee throughout. Sour cherry became a bit overpowering towards the end as it warmed. Some bitter chocolate. Seemed a little unfocused with the flavours not completely in sync. Lingering cherry and burnt malt, light smoke. Carbonation was way too high. Slight dry astringency from the dark grains. The body felt lighter than it should due to the carbonation. Certainly an odd beer.
