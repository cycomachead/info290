"love it great beer. not for everyone very strong and heavy taste"
"Good carbonation on tongue. Starts heavy with light malty finish."
""
"Overall - I think some aging should serve this beer well (like it says on the bottle) to mellow out the high ABV. Good thing I have two put away for awhile :)"
""
""
""
""
""
"After recently trying a series of light, caramel-colored brown ales, this was a revelation.  Palo Santo Marron comes across more like an imperial doppelbock than a traditional brown ale.  It wouldn’t be hyperbole to say this tastes very much like a barrel-aged Celebrator.  It has definitely earned some of my respect for what I’d previously considered an overrated brewery."
"Big, dark, sweet.  Great winter brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty and I love the unique wood aging though the alcohol is a bit strong"
""
""
"Nice. Can't drink more than 1.5 in one sitting but that's my problem"
"Overall:  tasty big, smoked beer.  Will buy again."
""
"Wow. Complex isn't the half of it. Caramel notes, a subtle vanilla under it. A big malt finish."
"This is easily one of my favorite year-round offerings from any brewery available to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as pungent or acrid as beers of this style and ABV usually are. Has the same malty flavor you'd get from a milder stout, which I appreciate."
""
"Damn fine brew... I've recently begun to step back back a bit from the big stout/porter beers that beat you about the head and neck regardless of how much I love them (see my review of Avery's Mephistopheles for where I stand)... Nevertheless, this brew is up there on my charts. Thick, big and black; it is a force to be reckoned with (keep your smartass racist/phallic interpretations to yourself). This is quite a departure from what I've come to expect from the guys at Dogfish, for sure. Definitely worth a try if you're thinking of a brute of a beer on a cold winter night. Not recommended for the hop-friendly types that would be offended by a malt-heavy, sweet and severely alcoholic brew... Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Smooth, potent, well-rounded and balanced. Glad I took the time to let it open up."
""
""
"Dark Brown. Great carbonation. Fantasic Caramel flavor and vanilla tones. Sweat with a smokey finish."
""
""
""
""
"Love this beer. The nose and taste of this beer is very complex. Loaded with Vanilla and Caramel. The mouth fell is nice as well."
"Real craftsmanship, but just too sickly sweet and syrupy for my taste at the end of the day."
""
""
"Incredible beer. Thanks DFH for this masterpiece:)"
"This is definitely a slow sipper, a dessert beer. A triple imperial brown ale."
""
""
""
""
"A little too bitter for my taste. Nice abv though"
"Aged 6 months and it's worth it"
"But the beer is damn good."
""
"Superb brown ale.  Plenty of caramel, vanilla and almost cedar?"
""
"  Overall, a 4.75   for Palo Santo Marron - Dogfish Head Brewery. A great savory sipper to reflect on the day with during a nice film. I will probably pick this up again."
""
""
""
"I never knew what a brown ale could be tell now."
"A bright and vibrant kick in the nutty"
"Overall- Wonderful creamy flavors come together nicely, caramel, vanilla, butterscotch give beer a decadent richness and delicacy. Slight roastiness and oakiness come through and balance out sweetness, while also adding a spicy complexity and depth. Alcohol does show, but doesnt detract from the main flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First drain pour. Not a fan of this."
""
""
"Poured from a 06/2012 bottle, never had a fresh bottle"
"A very nice beer from Dogfish Head once again, this one had an enjoyable taste to it and went down a lot easier than I had imagined going in. The nose could have been a little more pronounced with some notes proving a little difficult to detect but once given some time to open up things started to be a little more noticeable. The alcohol was fairly well hidden with only small amount coming through and the sweetness in the taste was very nice. A great beer overall and definitely one that I'd like to try again, hopefully I can get my hands on another bottle somehow."
""
"This is my god damned go to beer. My regular. It's delicious and different. It's for people who think stone brewing makes weak tasting beers. Propers to dogfish head. This beer is the pinnacle of brown ales. Period."
"Drank one and it was delicious.   Put the other three in the cellar to enjoy over the years."
""
""
""
""
""
"The fact that this particular bottle was aged for six months gave this dogfish "" holy tree""  beer a full  masterful taste of caramel and smooth flavor. I will have this one ranked in top 3 in the dogfish line."
""
""
""
""
"This is DFH at its finest. Had the good fortune of picking up three bottles of the first batch ever released 2/11/08. This is definitely a fantastic beer to age. I've never had a 12% beer taste so smooth. Hints of toffee, caramel and chocolate all imparted by the Palo Santo wood. It's such a dark beer you forget it's a brown ale and not a stout. A ton of respect for DFH -- it cost them $140,000 to make the vessel made from Palo Santo Wood. Yet, this is the ONLY beer that's made in that vessel and it's nowhere close to being their top selling beer."
""
""
""
"Bottled date 8/13/12. Age has made this beer more complex. Fantastic beer"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a great beer. Firstly, I was a big fan of the Palo Santo wood. It basically took oak taste, and removed some of the aspects of that taste which I didn't like, thus making an even better wood taste. I love the dark, opaque appearance, something that most brown ales lack. The feel of this beer in my mouth was incredible as well. So smooth and creamy, with just the right amount of carbonation (almost). Definitely recommended. I will definitely be picking up more of this in the future."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Really good, one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
"For an everyday available dogfish this is amazing. Super dark and tons of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brown ale....whatever. Drinks more like a stout to me, but they could call this American Brown Dishwater for all I care. Simply one of the best new (to me) beers I've tried in a long time.  Would love to age a few...if I can exercise the patience."
"One of my all time favoritesI"
""
""
"Remarks:  this is a great beer; I'll definitely have it again, and again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  I can’t believe I haven’t reviewed this beer earlier because it has always been one of my favorites from DFH.  It surprises and delights me every time I come across this treat.  Being unique is great, but to be this different, yet still so well put together is exceptional.  It is not every day that a year-round offering from any brewery deserves a 5 in any category, but Palo Santo most certainly does.  It is greater than the sum of its parts."
""
"This was a stunning beer and a glaring reminder to me as to why I enjoy craft beer. Not only was it super unique, it was very well crafted... what else should I expect from Dogfish Head? I'll be snagging a bottle of this next time I see it so I can try it again -- it is definitely something one-of-a-kind and special."
"As with many brews from Dogfish Head this is a very unique beer with a unique after tasted that is highly impacted, almost dominated, by the high alcohol content (12%). It has an array of flavors and the after taste comes across as almost tart, certainly more than most brown ales. From the look of the beer as you pour it you expect a very full mouth feel as the beer appears very dark and thick, but surprisingly it has a rather light to moderate mouth feel. I personally really like one bottle, but would not enjoy drinking multiples at one sitting."
"One of my favorite go to beers."

"probably my favorite brown. great"
""
"Glass- Snifter"
"Notes:  Totally worth trying.  Have an average brown ale before you try this one, so you can appreciate how special it is.  A total winner."
""
""
""
""
"A little too strong for me - couldn't even finish it."
"O- This one has incredible depth. The wood casks really impart a lot to this one. It should be considered an Imperial Brown Ale, as well. Strong and heavy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was not a fan"
""
"What stands out most for me is the taste and feel of this brew at the end and how it lingers in my mouth. Need to pick up a new bottle to compare."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not what i was expecting."
""
""
"Complex with a nice balance of flavors.  The wood is very present with toasty, nutty malt notes, a little alcohol burn, and some vanilla sweetness. Very light body and drinkable for 12%.  I think the wood gives it a drier finish for a beer this big."
""
"Strong but fantastic. Pour in your favorite vessel and enjoy."
""
""
""
"Note - this is best fresh as the vanilla and other woody characteristics from the Paraguayan Palo Santo fermentation tanks is noticeably faded after 6 months (see bottle date on the neck of the bottle) and the beer becomes unbalanced and overly sweet. Not recommended for cellaring despite the high abv and wine like characteristics unless you want this to become a barley wine after maybe 2 years or so. I'd drink fresh myself."
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic. Maybe the best brown ale I've ever had. It's a shame I've past this by so many times, thinking I wouldn't enjoy it. Very stupid. Great sipper, gets much deeper as it warms!"
""
""
""
""
"An interesting American Brown Ale"
""
""
"Excellent look with fine head, not much aroma perhaps it's weakest point, smooth feel and smooth taste with hints of vanilla and caramel (which I admit I am partial too).  One excellent winter warmer with a good book, salted pretzel and warm blue cheese dip :-). Having on tap at the Malted Barley right now."
"Super dark in appearance.  Coffee brown head that dissipates fairly quickly.   Smells like it tastes:  chocolate (slightly tootsie roll-ish),  black licorice, fruity and nutty.  Unless you like a good buzz, don't drink more than 3!  Great beer-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottled on 7/21/14, served at 55 degrees.  Poured almost completely black into a tulip with about an inch of creamy khaki head that dissipates nice and slow to a thick film.  Smell is underwhelming, but I pick up fig, raisin, malty sweetness and alcohol.  Medium thick and creamy mouth feel with flavors that blend so well it's difficult to single out any one in particular.  It tastes like the Philharmonic orchestra sounds.  Definitely hides the 12% ABV well, but to me this seems like more of an imperial stout.  Someone likened this beer to Oskar Blues Ten Fidy, but this would be like the caramel raisin brother to the chocolate charred coffee that is the Ten Fidy.  Overall, this excellent beer has claimed a spot in my top 5 cold weather beers."
""
"Tastes like the Phantom Menace of deliciosity."
""
""
""
""
"Black, viscous, and boozy, with a brown head. Nominally a brown ale, it's highly reminiscent of Ten Fidy, only even more potent."

"The best brown ale I've ever had. Very malty, with enough sweetness to satisfy my wife, but still sufficiently bitter for me. Definite vanilla taste. Dark and thick - a very rich brown ale. At 12% ABV, one ten ounce pour is enough for one night."
""
""
""
""
""
"It is truly a unique beer and the wood is a flavor of its own. Vanilla and barrel-y boozy flavors follow. The ABV will get you on this one. If I drink one of these other beers become not as necessary. It's worth tasting the difference slightly cold to warm. Holiday dark fruits are there and very nice. I haven't aged this one and I wonder how it would do?"
""
""
""
""
"Dog Fish Head's Palo Santo Marron is outstanding.  One of my all time favorite beers. So many favors.  This brown Ale has an earthy taste that must come from the wooden containers it is aged in  The vanilla comes through with just the right amount of sweetness.  Very smooth and easy to drink.  No bitterness and even though it has a high ABV (12%) it doesn't taste like I'm drinking pure alcohol.  If you have never tasted this beer, take my word for it, it's worth a little extra $."

"This is an excellent beer, although it strikes me as a precurser to today's spiced stouts than a brown ale.  Really, really excellent brew."

"Very good tasting beer with strong notes of Coffee, Chocolate and Vanilla It has a pleasantl alcohol burn finish! It'll make you smile coming in at a whopping 12% ABV!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very bold taste, doesn't give me the feel of brown ale. It's more along the lines of barley wine, the flavor is so intense. You can pick out some vanila and coffee flavors. It will knock you on your arrs if you're not carefull"

"Very creamy mouth feel, almost like syrup.  Low carbonation.  Great beer to have on a cold evening or special occasion.  Not a session beer just a slow sipper.  My favorite to date"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Tastes similar to a delicious stout like JO Oil of Aphrodite. It's too bad this beer has gone unnoticed for so long. Great winter brew."

"taste: At first i was distracted by the mouth feel being very thick and then by the alcohol. as it warmed up i got notes of a very sweet vanilla and caramel after tones."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a very dark brown, almost black, with a big two finger thick tan head. The aroma is nice, with dark fruit, vanilla, roasted malt, chocolate and lots of booze. The taste is also lots of dark fruit, vanilla, followed by dark chocolate and some coffee. The alcohol is pretty well masked up front, but really stands out in the back end, along with some nice oaky type flavors- very complex, but nicely balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others. The beer has a medium/thick mouthfeel, just enough to linger on the palate nicely. Overall, this is an excellently made beer- very complex, but nicely balanced."

"Palo Santo pours a black color with a nice long lasting and lacing tan head.  There is a strong okay aroma, with whiskey like notes.  The taste is very big and creamy.  Big sharp malt backbone, good hints of of the palo wood, vanilla, and a whiskey like after finish.  Good strong flavors, nice body.  Overall fantastic."

"O: A big bruiser of a brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: pretty good, it's a real heavy brown, i'd say it is somewhere in between a Belgian dubbel clone and a brown ale that is woody."
"Really nice thick, brown creamy head.  Super dark, nearly black.  The aroma is super complex.  Burnt, smokey, roasted malts some sweetness.  Can certainly taste the uniqueness of the wood that is used.  Lots of smoked malt, mild bitrerness.  Really fantastic."
""
""
"Overall: Couldn't wait to try this one, and my high expectations were blown out of the trub. Gives the best of any big beer a of any type a run for its money without succumbing to that ""you either love it or hate it"" description most beers of this size and complexity call forth. Just a tiny touch too sweet in my opinion. Otherwise, it's superb. 9/10"

"Poured into a snifter. Color is dark black with almost no head. Very boozy smell. Kind of like a woody whiskey smell. Most alcohol I've ever smelt in a beer. Oddly, and delightfully, the taste isn't boozy at all. Nice warm taste of sweet fruits like plum. Raisin and caramel too. Would have given it a 10 for taste if it was a little more carbonated, but I understand high abv beers have less. Nice warm mouth feel. Makes you smile when you sip it. Would be a great sit in front of the fireplace on a cold day kind of beer."

"I enjoyed this beer. Do taste the vanilla and wood. Quite unique. Could see drinking it to cap off a particularly long or challenging day.  But it's just way too boozy tasting for me to drink casually. The thought of having two in a row makes my stomach churn."
""
""

"Overall a tremendous and unique beer.  I think mine is fresh, and it expect age will bring out softer vanilla flavors and tame the spicy/peppery flavors and hide the alcohol better."
"Packs a punch, that's for sure. Really smooth going down which is suprising for 12%. I'm a fan but not a huge fan of this style but this one could change my mind. Really tasty. I think I'll have another.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Doesn't know whether it not it it wants to be a brown ale or an imperial; but either way it's delicious."
""
""
"O – Tried this beer a few months ago and it had some balance issues. Held on to this bottle for about five months and it has paid off handsomely. Tons of flavor imparted by the wood with great offsetting bitterness. Every place it touches the tongue gives a different bit of flavor. An excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As with many high ABV beers a preferred this warmer. Once it warmed it really opened up and presented a load of complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - good, easy drinking. Scary, eh?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer. I feel like the booze will mellow with some aging, so I do plan on aging a bottle for a little. Waiting to see what happens."
""
"Dark Brown Ale. Deep, almost black in color. Imperial heft and potency. Liquorish nose. Faintly acidic. Lacks vanilla undertones reported by some. Wood curing readily evident. Hint of sea salt. Complex, but not great. 10 ounce goblet at Reboboth Beach Dogfish Head restaurant."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
"O: This is a huge beer. It's a little too hot for my tastes, and it's the end of the night. But it's very good overall. Complex and flavorfull- also unique in style."

"O- very big beer. I have enjoyed world wide stout and 120, but this one is too big for me. The alcohol festers in the back of your throat and causes an overwhelming burn and bitterness. Not for me."

"O - Complex and rich. Has a few minor flaws; slightly to ""hot", and not all the flavors come together in total harmony, but all in all a really solid offering."
""
""
"Overall a worthy addition to my DFH samplings. Haven't tried many Brown Ales but this was good. Probably would not purchase multiples of this again. But I would buy the occasional single bottle as a variation to my usual stout selection."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The unique smell and taste notes, presumably from the non-standard wood, give it a character that is different but not unpleasant. That being said, I will not be having a second one."

"O - A great brown ale if not the best I've had. Highly recommended! Cheers!"

"O: A fantastic brew. Could easily be mistaken for a Stout, but I don't know that I've ever had a Stout this easy to drink. Wonderfully balance in the taste, fantastic aroma. Can't go wrong with this one."

"Jet black in color with a faint wisp of fingernail thin head that is barely at all present. This looks more like an imperial stout. Plenty of dark malt and and lots of wood like aroma. The flavor is loads of dark malt and a nice woodsy flavor of palo santo wood. Think along the lines of oak with a bit more of an earthy almost rye spiciness. The mouth is very thick and chewy."
"Probably the darkest brown ale I've ever tried. High complexity and we'll balanced. I love the idea of a barrel aged brown ale and this one hits the spot."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. I let this bottle sit for a wile in the basement its about 1.5 years old and it has seamed to mellow out over that time, lose some bite and sweetness. This beer is good to have one to sip on after diner or before bed."

""
""
"O: I completely enjoyed this. It was a wonderful birthday treat. The aging did well for it, and after a flight of beer, this about did me in. Grab a four pack. Drink one now, and every year thereafter and see the taste mature. This beer is one more reason DFH is one of the favorites."

"Overall: Much more mild with a year on it. I feel this beer fresh has a very strong flavor, almost spicy making it difficult to drink. With a year of age, It's perfect and drinks like an imperial stout, rather than a brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: well. definitely the most intense brown ale i've ever had. the woody flavor is incredible in here. minus the alcohol in the flavor (which id expect for something at 12%) everything in here is blended really well. a mix of malts, wood, and that cherry-like flavor really come together to create a beer that is something you'd end your night with. but be careful - this is a sipper for sure"
"O. There is an appeal to this beer that makes me want to try it again. It is not too heavy for such a strong brew. I am not sure why but I really like it. Its easy to drink and not overbearing in any way. Simply good."
""
""
""
""
"A big beer that goes down oh so smooth and will have your body feeling tingly in no time. This tasty treat defies characterization."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a unique, complex beer. The wood used in aging plays a big part in this beers outstanding, overall quality. I will drink this beer again and will keep my eyes out for more of it in the future."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Still, this beer has beautiful complexity and should really be sought after like some of the other barrel aged brews."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good brew. The price doesn't reflect the quality though. I'm glad I tried it and would love to have it again sometime but it's too costly to be a regular."
""
"First thing I noticed was the cloudy, deep/dark brown appearance and the fantastic carbonation. Smelled the vanilla and earthy characteristics from the oak barrels. Taste was great...a bit boozy on the aftertaste but that's to be expected from such a big beer (12% abv). Easy beer to drink if you don't mind a little alcohol in the aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"O) This is delicious, a sweet malt bomb with woody finish. At 12% this one is good to share with a friend or spouse!"
""
""
""
"O: This beer was fantastic, lots of character and slight hints of the wood from the barrels its held in, I enjoyed this brew very much."
"Overall: Excellent beer. At this price point ($14/4pk in WA) its a very compelling offering from DFH that can compete with both strong ales, brown ales as well as lower ABV RIS. I would love to pour one of these at a RIS blind taste."
"O: Personally not been too impressed/excited for dogfish head in a few years but this one was a solid offering. not like the norm of this style and really pushed the outer bounds. I will look for this one in the future as it was an awesome surprise."

"O: Exceptional! This brew left me craving the next sip! It was almost as enjoyable to look at as it was to drink. If anything, I wish they had bolstered the aroma a bit, as it seems the rest of its attributes tend to overshadow the aromatic profile. Would highly recommend."

"This was thoroughly enjoyable. A touch boozy, but so well balanced, as it warmed the booze did not heighten. Thick and chewy, this beer had hints of vanilla and dark fruit twisted amongst the caramel bittersweetness. I didn't get any wood from this, but the mouthfeel and carbo just danced up and down my palate. Will absolutely have again. Might be my new DFH fav. If your a RIS fan looking for a touch of variety, try this, you will thank me..."

"O) Extremely delicious, great body, pleasant finish. This is a winner."

"O- Very solid imperial brown here. I haven't had many beers of the style to compare it to, but the one that comes to mind is Prairie Okie. A bit more contained and less complex to that one in comparison. A unique and well done effort"
""
"O - Not your standard brown. This is a beer that comes in big, with huge sweetness, alien wood elements, and underlying booze notes. It is a beer that is greater than the some of its parts, managing to meld disparate elements into a pleasurable drink. Sip and ponder the wild ride."
""
"Overall: Its a great beer, a dark brown ale, nice head and dark as night. I love it."

"6/21/2014 Edit: Just cracked opened this beer again with a brewed on date of 6/19/13. One year later and it's still a wonderful looking dark brew with a nice foamy head. Smells as wonderful as I remember with the vanilla seeming to be more pronounced. The flavor is still so unique with an emphasis on the molasses and the aged wood tones. Very smooth and oh so fantastic. If you can age one, do it!"

"Overall- I did not like this beer that much. It's drinkable, but not by much. The sweetness and the high solvent alcohol character on this beer is too overwhelming for me. The 9/2012 bottle was even more disgusting as it was just even more overwhelmingly sweet without any alcohol presence to cut the sweetness. The price point is also not helping this beer any."

"This beer is a constant in my fridge. It's so good that I enjoy introducing it to as many friends as possible. This is perfect with dessert or while relaxing on the couch at the end of the night. Rich flavor with pleasant mouthfeel for such a high alcohol ale."

"Overall, very much enjoyed this Brown Ale."
""
""
""

""

"I think that this is one of the best beers made year round. The color is a super dark brown with a nice coffee colored head that lingers after you pour. The smell of the wood and the alcohol are easy to find and then come forward at the first sip. In the middle and end you get all the little nuances. The earthy tones, mostly nuttiness, from the brown ale compliments the overwhelming wood flavor. It's a filling beer that coats your mouth from the first sip. I absolutely love this beer and would recommend it to anyone within earshot."
""
""
"A unique and delicious beer, I strongly recommend Palo Santo Marron."
""
""
"O - Really good and hits the spot for the complex stout and aged stout area even though this is a ""brown ale"". Price point is a bit steep but that's Dogfish head."

"I've never had a beer in which i was so confident giving a 5 in any category, but the smell of this beer is out of this world. It pours like a black daemon with very little lacing. As mentioned before the smell is perfect. You can smell the rich oaked flavor that makes you feel like your out in a majestic wild forest. It tastes almost as good as it smells."

"Overall: A really good and unique twist on an imperial Brown Ale. Rich and strong but still nicely creamy and smooth. Lots of good dark fruit flavor."

""

"O - All I can say is WOW! This beer is a must try. DFH really nailed it here with Palo Santo Marron. I really like the complexity, it takes you on a journey of flavor and creates a true drinking experience."
""
""

""
"O - Great beer than I really enjoyed. I'll have to get a hold of more some day. Do yourself a favor and pick some of this up because it is very tasty. Thanks to deadonhisfeet for sending to me."

"Hell yeah! Had on draft first time. Review is the bottles in forced me to purchase. Had a year old bottle. The brown ale label is debatable. I get a little of that style, but it is it's own beast. Honestly it tastes similar in many ways to Bourbon County Barleywine, but kind of comes across as a strong, dark Belgian and stout too. Very unique. Has a booziness to it, but not that would indicate 12%. Wouldn't have been able to tell you that till I was done. Smell is awesome. I get molasses, fruit/fig, brandy/wine, some other shit I can't even begin to describe so I'll go with ""complex mo fo"". Taste follows all that jive. Don't even know what the hell kind of wood Palo Santo is but I may have to build a bourbon cabinet out of it. A very unique and fantastic beer. May not be for everyone, but owe it to yourself to try it."
""
""
"Overall: Unique, complex, really good. LIke sitting under a tree somewhere you can see the stars."
""
""
"It tasted very similar to bourbon county. It just takes a little bit on the tongue to enjoy the complexity of this beer. You get some awesome dark fruits, a ton of milk chocolate, some bourbon, vanilla, and toffee. You can see how the wood they used adds a great amount of soft sweetness. The flavors goes deep down into your taste buds. I am confused as to why this isn't rated a 100 on here, but it is definitely an easy 10 beers for me. WORLD CLASS BEER. I will cellar this and see how much better it gets a few years down the road."

"Tastes like an oaky burn, with a creamy mouthfeel and a cognac after-effect. The dark fruit is in the upfront taste. A big type of brown ale, a fine after-dinner drink to sip. Not my favorite DFH beer, as ""oak-age"" isn't my favorite beer attribute. But this is still unique as far as the taste and style. Some very nice dark wood-like and boozy smoke flavors come through as this warms. Intriguing. Won't seek regularly, but will definitely revisit."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is an interesting take on a brown ale. There is an incredible amount of complexity going on here. A brown ale on steroids and PED's. It takes a minute to process the flavor blast and come to grip with what you are tasting. This is truly what I have come to expect from Dogfish Head. Not ordinary by any means."

"I was impressed with the first two categories but the rest was downhill. I keep trying these beers from DFH and am continually let down. Perhaps, I have learned my lesson. At $16 for a 4-pack, I will not be buying this one again."

"O: Definitely the best brown ale I've ever had, if you can call it that, but even then, that's not saying much. The brown ale isn't very compelling to me. This is. Definitely worth a try."
"I actually bought this beer not really reading the label thinking it was the 90min IPA. I have to say I am so glad that I made this mistake. This beer hit you right in the mouth as soon as you open it. It has a hint of vanilla and almost a coffee stout aroma. The first sip is almost like a porter with a blast of hops. Its mild carbonation makes it very drinkable for a 12% beer. It has a unique aftertaste that is hard to describe other than that of a oatmeal porter with a hop mix. Overall a great beer that needs to be tried."

""

"Slight alcohol finish but overall this is a very well-rounded beer."

"bought a 4 pack for 16 bucks from the local store and thought it would be phenominal just based on the price... great thinking that was, lol I don't know where that logic came from. cool concept, and history behind the beer I found after I googled it. not bad overall, but DEFINITELY NOT WORTH MORE THAN 10 BUCKS FOR A 4 PACK."
""
""
""
"O: Really a unique tasting beer. Almost (but not quite) a smoked porter. The wood adds a element of complexity that is really enjoyable. I wouldn't drink it every day, but am glad that I tried it."

""
""
""
""
""

""

"O: A very interesting and impressive beer. The wood comes through, but the base beer seems very well crafted and unique. A pleasant big, cold weather beer that is a really cool change of pace from stout/porter/barrel aged what-not. Really good."
""
"This beer starts sweet, but ends bitter. It does make me think of semi-dry wine. It has a bit of an alcohol bite...similar to bourbon barrel beers. It has a beautiful, rich, dark color. The mouthfeel is great. Would probably drink it again, but won't buy it myself."

"Picked up a four pack of this for my birthday. Poured black with a slim mocha head into a Chimay goblet, and looks completely frigging awesome. Nose is dark fruit, super-malt, and boozy. The bottle indicates there should be some vanilla and caramel notes. I get the caramel, not picking up on the vanilla, but definitely some dank wood. Flavor is like liquefied raisin, and boy is this thick. So good, and the vanilla really comes through in the flavor (maybe as it's warming), as does the wood, giving it real winelike character. The mouthfeel as I said is thick, alcohol level is up there with a wine and gives a similarly tongue-numbing sensation, and low carbonation. Overall, completely badass. Now going to chase this with something a bit lighter. I honestly can't see drinking more than one of these at a sitting, two tops. Awesome, awesome beer."
""
""
""
"o-A bit too sweet for me and it seems to be more a stout than a brown ale. This beer could benefit from a more roasty malt or some kind of bitterness to balance the sweetness. A plus for this beer is that at 12% abv there is a low alcohol presence, which makes for an easy drinking sipper. (76/100)"
"This is a really complex beer. Drinks like a stout for sure and a lot is going on in these 12oz. The 12% abv is there but as the multiple flavors within decide to take turns upstaging each other, the burn quickly subdues. I had one of these 2 yrs ago when I got the 4 ok and thought it was overly boozy. The age really did this one good and glad I have another left to enjoy again. DFH hit the mark with this one."
""
""
""
""
"O - For as heavy of a beer as this is, the finish is smooth and it is enjoyable to continue sipping. I could see having two or three bottles of this back to back, no problem, providing I wasn't leaving the house for a while!"
""
"From my tasting notes: It pours black as used motor oil and looks and tastes like an Imperial Stout. The wood aging gives it a bitter but complex taste that hides the alcohol well. It had a thick and heavy mouthfeel that lets you know you are drinking something substantial while many of the flavors and aromas introduced themselves as it warmed. Not something I could drink all the time, but a dynamic and powerful beer that I thoroughly enjoyed."
""
"Overall - Somewhat similar to Bitches Brew with no raisin or chocolate. Very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful complex heavy sweet sticky winter beer"
"Had this beer a few times and decided to do full review. Beautiful looking beer that has a great smell, the smell has me salivating, malty and rich. The beer is not quite as tasty as it smells, which is perfect, but is outstanding, also thick and smooth. Bonus points for the ABV which is 12% but not at all boozy. Outstanding beer that will be a regular in my fridge."

""

"Easily one of the most ""interesting"" experiences on the palate, but I just don't like it."

"First sip is glorious. Definitely taste like it was aged in bourbon barrels though I know it hasn't. You also get hints of vanilla as well. Mouthful is silky smooth. It strikes a perfect balance of sweetness and and roasty bitterness. No alcohol burn can be detected as this beer has turned almost into a fine liquor with age. Again completely different beer with a good amount of age on it. Almost reminds me of a kbs sans the coffee overtone. shocked the hell out of me that this beer got THIS good. With the age on it, this has turned into a top 10 beer all time for me. Just wow!"
"I couldn't stand this beer. Normally I love a strong Dogfish IPA, but this is just too much alcohol which is overbearing. Some how I need to make my way through the last two bottles, bought some blue cheese/crackers to have something equally as sharp to be able to off-set the taste a bit. Tasted to me more like a a whiskey or something."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I will say that it's big but I can't remember having a imperial porter or stout with the depth that it has. The opal color and rich, brown lacy head make an excellent presentation. On the front end you experience strong wood flavors with notes of licorice and prunes, then you go through a warm alcohol mouth feel, finishing with a carmel-like, chocolate/coffee surge from what seems to be a good amount the darker crystal, chocolate and roasted malts. Hoppiness is moderate but some drinkers could confuse the complex malt profile for hop bitterness. Its an extremely well crafted sipper. If there is a down side, it would only be the burn from a 12% ABV and waiting for that to clear to experience the depth and complexity? Worth the wait. Thanks for a unique experience Sam!"

"Saying a beer is perfect is saying there is no better beer anywhere, but this is the best I've ever had. It's thick and chocolaty, with a bite after the swallow. The bite is almost spicy at first, but ultimately confounded my taste buds. The 12% ABV wastes no time and puts me into a nice state of mind. That, after all, is what beer is supposed to do."

I'll have to try it fresh some day to see if it's the same, but almost a year later, this beer held up quite nicely and offered a fairly unique experience when it comes to brown ales. A lot of things that are aged in wood barrels have just a hint of wood, this thing was covered in it. It was a great beer!"
""
"O - I've always found this to be a VERY BIG beer. More so than a lot of other 10-15%ers than I've had. The alcohol is more than present but still not off-putting. Very much a sipper though."

"I cant say what this beer tastes like fresh, but I imagine its a bit hot. This, which a year and a half of age on in, is really, really good. There really isnt much to compare it so style-wise, but this drinks more like an imperial stout than a brown ale. Hopefully i can get my hands on some more of this though, because its really good."
"Dang. That's all I know to say. Definitely not a “regular” drinker, but I would say this is one of the cornerstone beers for both Dogfish Head and the American craft scene."

"Overall: Awesome brew. An excellent dessert beer but I don't think I could put away a 4 pack in one sitting. I feel like this would almost be better off as a bomber or 750. Regardless, this is a smooth sweet beer with a moderately complex and very nice flavor profile. Hard to compare it to beers of the style because it's really nothing like any other brown ale I've had but great all around"

"Overall: By far my favorite done by DFH, and I love alot of the work they do. This is just brilliantly done from beginning to end, and at 12% I have no idea how they made the alcohol completely undetectable. Must get for anyone."
""
"Overall/Comments: I thought this was tremendously good. Another great original concept from DFH that didn't disappoint. A big beer with great flavor. Classified as an American Brown Ale @ 12% ABV. Consumed 4/17/2013."

"Overall: What a cool, unique beer. You certainly get a tiny bit of the hop characteristics of a brown ale, but with a much thicker mouthfeel and a lovely vanilla tone that lasts for ages. This is a seriously great beer."

"O - The 12% abv doesn't bite you or scare you off, it's tasty. It's well disguised for how high it is, but ever present. Caught me off guard when I read brown ale, as it drinks more like an Imperial brown or a Belgian strong dark ale."

"O- I really enjoyed this brew. This one is a sipper at 12%, but it's quite easy to suck right down. I would love to get my hands on a 4 pack of the stuff."
"Overall: This beer is fantastic, its pricey but if one has the patience to age this beer!!I really like it!!"

"O: Not really my favorite style of beer, but I'm digging this one. I was going to write that it was a sipper, especially with the high ABV - but the glass is already half-empty. Not a beer that I would go back to often, but it is solid. Recommended to try, and expand what you think a Brown Ale can be. I believe I may have a new favorite Brown..."
"Notes: overall a very complex, sweet and malty beverage - enjoyable sipper, aperitif or after dinner desert beer. tasty!"
"O: Delicious beer. I had this years ago and loved it. I still really enjoy this beer. It's not something you'd pick up every day, but it's damn delicious. In fact, I might grab a few more bottles and throw them in the cellar for a few years, because why not?"

"Really dark for a Brown Ale, leaning to a coffee black color, with some coffee aroma also. Comes out of the bottle beautifully thick and viscous, with a very thin head, but the right amount of carbonation overall. Definitively some taste caramel and vanilla. The bourbony taste of alcohol also comes out strong."
""
"For being a rich beer, this was incredibly smooth. It pours a smooth dark brown, with a small amount of lace on the glass There are smells of wood, toffee, caramel, and malt. The taste follows with a rich mouthfeel, yet it does not coat the mouth. Many flavors present themselves, but in such a well balanced manner. This is certainly one of the best Brown Ales I've tried and is a testament to the talent of the Dogfish Head brewery."
"O-really really nice beer. Definitely alot going on. Thinking about picking up another bottle to age."
"Overall: One of my favorite DFH brews. I could have sworn this was an RIS. A solid curve ball that I will have to look out for again soon."

"O: I don't love this beer. There are things I really like about it, but the mouthfeel is pretty off-putting. I think I'm a little disappointed because I've been waiting to try this for a long time. I'm putting two bottles in the cellar, maybe it'll improve with age."

"O- It's complex and a very tasty sippin' brown ale. I can't say I've ever had one like it. It seems to be more like an imperial stout to me. Great beer overall though."

"O- a heavy, dark beer that is enjoyed best sipped on. Well balanced brown ale on the heavy side that can be enjoyed by any dark/stout beer lovers. Boozy but what can you expect with 12% ABV. ...not for the feint of heart. Delicious"

"Very underwhelmed by this. Pours a very dark brown, almost black - looks like an imperial stout, and very promising. The aroma is that of a spicy coffee porter - nice but no complexity and barrel character. The taste is very similar - kind of syrupy chocolate in this, pretty bitter but with a coffee molasses sweetness. Feels very this for a 12abv beer, amazingly well hidden in every way. This is not a terrible beer, a decent one that left me wanting a hell of a lot more."
""

"D/O: A challenging strong ale, this beer stands out because it is an (extremely) high-gravity example of its style. In fact, it forfeits most distinctive brown ale qualities, instead coming across as interchangeably Baltic porter/imperial Russian stout. It is not an especially delicious version of either due to cloying alcohol and acidity that diminishes its smoothness."
""

"Smooth taste of Roasted Coffee and raisins. Alcohol after taste on the finish. Medium to medium heavy mouthfeel. The wood imparts an unique taste which is quite good. Would be a great after dinner , savor it by the fireplace type of beer."

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 10/22/2012. Pours almost pitch black color with a small foamy dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the small head. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, molasses, raisin, fig, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, light char, wood, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and wood aging notes. Taste of big raisin, fig, molasses, brown sugar, caramel, toast, dark bread, wood, roasted malt, light char, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, molasses, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, wood, roasted malt, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of very robust dark malt flavors with fruitiness; and hardly any cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial brown ale. Very nice complexity and balance of flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Purchased at BevMo. Gorgeous to look at. Dark brown almost black with a thin tan head. Looks and smells much like an imperial stout. After tasting I don't think I'd call this a brown ale, imperial all the way in my opinion. Smells of vanilla, touch of booze. Taste is creamy and smooth. A little woody, definitely barrel aged. Delicious. Body is heavenly. Lightly carbonated but a heavy full mouthfeel. Booze is amazingly hidden for 12% ABV, noticeable still but well masked. Love this, recommend for sure."

"Simply put, too sweet! The sweetness many times overpowers the delicious and light flavors I have come to love from Dogfish Head."

"O. I have passes this beer for a long time not realizing how great it was. I hope the fresh lives up to the vintage, but I could drink this all the time. I seem to get a bit of coffee (typical right) but this beer has really aged well not knowing what a fresh one taste like. Gets better as it warms and is everything I want out of this style."
"Overall - Drinks much closer to a barleywine than it does a brown. Does nothing to hide it's boozy nature. Good, but for the price there are comparable brews I'd rather purchase."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am liking this beer with some age. It's not perfect, but there are some good things going on."
"Appearance was great- a great dark maroonish-brown with a small head. I found the carbonation to be just a bit light, and I found it to have a cloyingly metallic aftertaste. Based upon the 6-pack I bought I cannot recommend this. I usually really like Dogfish Head, but this one missed the mark for me."
""

"A good flavorful big ale. Fruity elements add a uniqueness and a balance to the more savory sweetness of the base malts. Hides it's strength well enough, but still a sipper. Another winner from DFH."
""
""
"O- A top notch beer, but I was expecting the wood to add something a little more exotic. I don't really know if I notice the difference between this and just typical oak, but perhaps if I had them side by side I would. A solid brew, though, perhaps my expectations were a little too high."
""
""
"Pours a very very dark brown. Half a finger of dark brown head that dissipates quickly. Smells like figs or raisins with a hint of alcohol. Has a smooth wood/vanilla flavor with dark fruit and a warm boozey finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and heavy. Because of the sweet/malty nature of the beer the heavy mouthfeel makes it seem just a bit syrupy."

"Hard pour yields no head, but at a hefty 12%, I wouldn't expect much anyhow. You defintiely get a woodsy vibe in the aroma. I'm not sure the beer needs to be so strong, but it is rather tasty! That aging process really gives it a unique character. It's sweet, but balanced and you feel a slight bitterness in the middle that's rather nice. Not an anytime beer, but one to try, obviously."

"Poured this American Brown Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a midnight black color, produced a deep tan color head, great retention and left an outstanding amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of this American Brown Ale was pleasing, full of dark roasted malt and chocolate malt. Full bodied, like most Dogfish offerings, this American Brown Ale was heavy on roasted malted grain. That super malty foundation set the tone for the rest of the session. Perfectly balanced, there are not alot of complex flavors in this brew- and that is just fine with me- its everything a craft American Brown Ale should be,...Heavy on the Malt, super smooth, full bodied...well balanced. There are some suggestions of caramel and vanilla but they are faint. I can't say that I can honestly detect the Palo Santo wood- either from the aroma or the taste- but I also wouldn't know the aroma or it's flavor if it were right in front of my face. In this case I will just chalk up the San Palo experience to this...This is a damn good American Brown Ale- If South American San Palo wood refines this beers character, then so be it- If it doesn't, it is at least a great story and exemplifies all that Dogfish Head Craft Brewing is about- Off centered Ales for off centered people! Prost!"

"O - wow. Had high expectations, but this truly floored me. Wonderful."

"A medium to full bodied mouth feel with a soft carbonation."
""
""
"Is this the best brown ale in America? If not it's close. Huge head that flowers into an billowing light brown cascade of foam. Lots of lace and sticky bits. It fades into a dark brown liquid that is not shy about the alcohol and integrates it well. Hefty malt body massages the nose with coffee and dark chocolate as well. Cherries and oaken vanilla. Taste is thick and lush. A bar of mocha that features oaken notes of cherry and vanilla. Smooth and malty with a sophisticated bittering that gives an light and Velvety feel with a big OG that drinks superbly.Superb overall. Luscious, thick, and drinkable."

"Overall: this is a very unique beer, and should not be confused with other brown ales, American, English or otherwise. Perhaps this is really a porter? The combination of malt, fermentation and hops makes for a very good beer that must be tried to be understood. It is hard to know where one component ends and another begins, the mark of a well-balanced beer. I would suggest sharing (or recapping) the bottle, since you'll want to sip this one slowly."
""
""
""

"O: For a Brown Ale? Awesome. As a beer overall? Equally awesome and impressive."
""
""

""

"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, was black in color with no light visible through the liquid. Aroma was heavily of malty with chocolate, earthy notes. Taste was roasted malt and chocolate, sweet and spicy. Mouthfeel was full bodied, like a stout (reminded me of some sweeter English stouts). Aftertaste was sweet and lingering, seemed to leave a tingling sensation. Good Stuff,"
"I like this and definitely recommended."
""
""
""
"I think we saved this beer too long. This was a 2008 bottle. Despite the ABV the beer was totally skunked. Last year, this was still a great beer. Did not continue to age well. Very disappointing. I wish we had reviewed this earlier, because this was truly a great beer."

"O: honestly, the immense sweetness reminds me of GI BCS. But unlike, BCS, it is not as well balanced (and it lacks the bourbon aspect). The heat is felt as it warms the lips and the stomach. Its a great brew. The Palo Santo wood is an interesting twist, but I honestly don't if its appealing or not."
""
""
""

"The beer just glides down the gullet. It is thick and oily and all around smooth. The mild carbonation lends itself wonderfully to the feel. It lingers on the palette and dries it out leaving a nice woody aftertaste."

"O - this is an interesting brown from DFH. The first bottle I opened took some getting used to, but the next was a excellent experience. For me most of DFH is a bit overrated, but this is a brew that is done very well. I think this will be fantastic after it sits awhile in the cellar which I'll review again. In terms of American brown ale this is one of the best and has a bit of everything for the snob who appreciates complexity and a unique high abv brew. I still prefer the Indian brown ale personally but this is another excellent brown from Dogfish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Instant ""must have"". Nice brown/red color, funky little beige head. Very roasty without the overly burnt notes. Dark cherry/plum/woodsy aroma maybe a touch of vanilla. Carried through in the taste with maybe even a pleasant hint of prune and other dark fruits. Thought it quite earthy. Creamy, a bit thick and sticky, not highly carbonated. Smoky/oaky/woods flavor. Great drinking beer, exceptionally smooth, nice sweetness, flavors very well melded and balanced. The ABV does sneak up - I didn’t find it obvious that this is a 12% beer."

"O: This is a great beer; and, it is available year-round. This beer is a style onto itself. It has the sweetness of a barleywine, combined with the complexity of black ale. The malt sweetness and the vanilla come very close to becoming cloying, but just in time the toasted grain, wood, a smooth booziness, and a few hints of dark dried fruit join in to add balance and complexity. Fans of sweeter beers should put this n their “must try” list. DFH really nailed it with this one."
""
""
"O- An awesome beer that I think all craft beer fans should try in their lives. Great to sip on a nice chilly night. I want more."
""
""
"O - This beer is incredible. There's so much going on flavor-wise, yet it's so easy to drink and the high ABV is almost nonexistent. No doubt this is the best brown ale I've ever had."

"Overall, this is a complex sweet, woody treat. More complex than I remember it being, but I need to try a fresh one. The spicy wood character is interesting. No hops noticeable, but could be beneath the wood and spicy. Not too sweet. Nicely done. Makes we want to put a few more away for even longer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had this beer several times in my life, just enjoyed it again. What a nice beer. Very deep brown, bordering on black with a great reddish brown color to it. Fair retention throughout. Aroma is warm, with hazelnut, chestnut, and vanilla. A faint amount of caramel comes through. I would say the predominant flavors are nutty, vanilla like, some smoke and bitter chocolate and honey. Alcohol is present for sure especially on the finish. Full bodied to match the full flavor, but finishes well and is nicely attenuated. Again there is alcohol on the finish. Overall this is one of my favorite dogfish head beers, if not favorite. Its a great sipper and an interesting take on a brown ale."

"O – Yes. So much yes. I don’t know what’s going on with this ridiculous wooden barrel that is larger than any created since the prohibition, I don’t know what Palo Santo wood actually tastes like (but if I’m ever on vacation and a tree gets pointed out to me I’ll be sure to take a nibble) but I do know a glorious beer when I drink one. And ladies and gentleman, you want to know, is this good beer? Well, in response to your question I have a question myself: is the space pope reptilian?"

"O - I'm excited to age my remaining bottles, but in the meantime I'm pretty disillusioned. I'm actually kind of surprised that this is a regular offering from DFH."
""

"O - Definitely an extreme example of the style (could be confused with an Imperial Stout). Off-centered as claims DFH's moto! Excellent drinkability for 12%ABV with a rare complexity of aromas and flavors. I just love this brew! 5/5"

"O - This is flat out original, big, alcohol heavy and a super smooth drink. This beer is one of the many reasons to love craft beer. It's 100% original and fantastic... not what I'd want to drink every night by any stretch.. but the perfect sip for a cold and rainy Pacific NW evening!"
""
"Pours an opaque super dark brown (almost black really) with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, slight soy sauce, wood, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick and a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has some nice flavors and aromas but it's quite strong and definitely something you have to take your time with."
"Overall: One of the best beers I've had. Not my favorite ABA but it packs a punch and tastes really good. DFH has better offerings, but at a whopping 12% this can work up a nice buzz."

"Bottled 02/22/11. Poured into a Stone IRS snifter (my Dogfish glass was dirty :( )Pours basically pitch black with almost no head that dissipates very quickly. Nose is super woody with notes of vanilla, figs, chocolate, heavy roasted malts, slight booze and something sticky like molasses and burnt brown sugar. The taste is soooo damn smooth. I haven't had a Palo Santo in a while but I don't remember them drinking like this. Amazing what 20 months will do. There are some fruity notes right up front like dates, figs and maybe some plum. There are heavy tones of wood, it has notes of burnt sugar, dark chocolate, raisins, booze, molasses, some dark cherries and vanilla all wrapped up with a sweet (but not too sweet) finish. The carbonation is really low, the mouthfeel is silky and surprisingly light for this beer. A couple of years took an already amazing beer and made it even better. Now I need to find another 4 pack and put them away for even longer. Great dessert."
"Overall- An incredibly solid brew here. Liked it very much"
"D) Why haven't I had this one before? I'm a big fan. More Brown Ales should be like this. :)"
""
"O - Nicely ages after 15 months. I'd think these continue to age nicely and I will continue to cellar a few."
""
""
""

"The 12% really starts to show about 2/3 of the way through the beer. It doesn't kill the beer but makes it a slow sipper. Complex and big with a great roasty Brown Ale, almost Strong Belgian feel."

"D: Not easily chugged, but easy to drink for 12% ABV for sure."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. Another great beer from Dogfish!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Dogfish was my gateway to craft beer so I bought up everything I could get my hands on. This happened to be one of their only beers I didn't particularly like, so after drinking 3 bottles, I stashed the last one away until now. I remember specifically not liking the flavor the wood gave to the beer, but now it's fairly subdued. With four years on it, it resembles more of a barley wine or old ale than a brown ale. Unfortunately, I've never been a fan of dark fruit flavors in my beers, so it wasn't really for me, although I'm sure many others would really enjoy it."
""

"Overall – Pretty boozy but it is nice and warming and has some wonderful flavors. This is definitely a sipping beer."

"A brown ale, eh? Call it what you will but this is thicker, richer, roastier and more complex than a lot of stouts out there. I'm a Dogfish Head skeptic but this is some mighty fine work. I'm happy to have tried it, will definately buy/ drink this again and I'm looking forward to seeing how this ages. "

"I must say this is a very interesting tasting beer. It has a lot of the same tastes that other barrel aged beers have but this one has it's own little twist. It is so much like a wine in taste and smell but it does still keep it's beer profile. Just a very interesting twist on a beer and something I think you should seek out and try for yourself."

"Big ass, like an RIS. Heard that before, I'm sure. Brown still prevails. Brown sugar and root beer candy. Big-ass malts. Black malts. Licorice. Chalky malt, whoppers. Dark fruits. Big wood. Slightly tart and a hint of metal. Creamy. Hearty. Oatmealy. Booze is hidden well. Good thing it's a tad filling, because this thing, at 12%, could get out of hand."

"Overall, this is the best brown I have ever tasted - it just seems to have more... well, brown-ness to it than any other brown I've had, although I haven't tasted too many aged browns. Certainly one of my new favorite beers."
"Overall: Fresh, it's harsh, but tasty. A year might really help this beer. In typical Dogfish Head fashion, it's aggressive, a little bit messy, and hot. It works."

"Just glad I only purchased a single and didn't pony up the dough for the full 4-pack."
""
""
""

""
""
"O: well, not at all what I anticipated. I'm trying to review it as a brown ale, not just a beer, and I've never had a brown ale this dark and dense; I'd say it's a good beer, but a little bit heavier than I'd expected. I might have scored it differently (higher?) if it were a double stout or even a black ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hides the 12% abv pretty damn well. This is a huge, malty monster of a Brown Ale. The Palo Santo wood is apparent and tastes like cedar covered in fresh saw dust."
""
"Review from 1/2010 notes. Poured into a flute glass. Pours a deep, deep red brown with a thin off white head. Aroma of caramel malt, dark fruit and wood. Flavor of caramel, roasted malt, cherries, dates, unidentifiable dark and light fruit. Woody, similar to oak, from the Palo Santo. Rich mouth feel. Surprisingly subdued aftertaste; a bit boozy. A complex and very interesting brown ale."
""
""
""
"O: I've heard of porters that think they're stouts, but a brown ale that thinks it's an imperial stout? In its current state, it's pretty enjoyable, but still too young and hot. This could become great with a year of age, and it's readily available/cheap-ish enough (for what it is, $15/4 pack isn't chump change) to make picking up a 4 pack to age a worthy endeavor."
""
"O- So what if the SRM is off the scale for a brown ale. DFH consistenly pushes the envelope and this is a great example. So many ways this could go wrong but it doesn't. A good one to offer to non-beer lovers as an example of what great beer can taste like."

"This is not your father's brown ale, this is something else altogether (in a very, very good way)."
""
""
""
"Update: I tried a second bottle the day after and this time noted some additional nuttiness. it's possibly that I missed it because of the lower temperature I had it at the first time. This is just an awesome, complex beer. I think I'm going to age the other two and see how they taste several months from now."
""
""

"O. Love this beer. For me, this resembles a stout more than a porter. I suppose it shares elements of both. Looking forward to obtaining more for aging."

"O: I'm not huge on DFH, but this is great. My only problem with it is the price. I can't see myself buying this again soon for that reason alone. If it were cheaper, it would be a staple for me. Very nice woody brown ale."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a thick, obviously opaque, brown with very little head. The smell is that of Home Depot or a cedar tree. VERY woody. I like that, but I'll admit it's a bit excessive. But that's just the smell. The taste is fantastic. The wood is present in appropriate amounts to add some serious complexity to what is otherwise normal, boring unfiltered brown ale. The unfiltered brown backbone of this is not something I'm generally a fan of. I feel like the thick oiliness of the lack of filtering can actually hurt the flavour of a brown ale sometimes by making it too thick and masking flavours that can present themselves in a thinner concoction. However, this particular ale is fantastic. It takes that thick brown, malty ale with all the stuff a beer can have crammed into it and it adds a nice woody texture to make it a VERY interesting beer. Sadly, the unfiltered yeast covers up A LOT of the alcoholic bite that should be present in a 12% beer, but most people reading this will probably like that. It's still got enough bite to keep me interested, but it is VERY disguised. So, be prepared to be hit hard. The complexity here is not as amazing as a good quad or a Samichlaus, but it's not far off. I will continue to be enticed by anything aged in wood. Such beers have yet to disappoint me."
""
""
"This is pretty much a stout, with dark brown almost black pour and a light brown half finger head. Aroma of roasted grain, dirt and some light chocolate notes. Taste is bitter chocolate with serious booze on the back end, warming going down, and nicely integrated. A strong sipper, but very nice, with roast, light wood, and chocolate. Full bodied, medium carbonation, and crazy strong for a brown ale. A pretty awesome brew."

"Pours a dark brown with a thumbs width mocha head. Could easily be mistaken for a stout. Very noticeable alcohol in the aroma, roasted malt, chocolate, wood, and some burnt sugar. Quite a bit of heat to this one that flows into some nice sweetness of vanilla, there's some woodiness, and some sugared breadiness. Not much activity, a nice fuller body. Overall, there was clearly no effort made at hiding the alcohol making this a definite sipper to slowly enjoy throughout the night. Lots of great flavors alongside the alcohol though, making this beer a definite winner."

"O - Dogfish Head is just so damn unique. I've had this beer a few times, including a bottle that was about 3 years old. I think I prefer it fresh. So much is happening, and the aroma is just perfect and so enticing. World class example of breaking the mold in the beer world."
""
""
""
"One awesome brew! Probably my favorite from DFH!"
""
""
"This is like an amped up version of Palo with more robust vanilla notes and the addition of roast coffee to the mix. Highly enjoyable fusion of new flavors."
""
""
"Overall: Really good brew. This is the first imperial brown I've tried, so I was hesitant to give this a 5, but with every sip I was reassured. A sipper for sure. Pretty cool to read about what Sam did in order to get this out to us, efforts alone make this worth while."
""

"Pretty good but the taste really brings it down... The alcohol really dominates and I feel the more subtle flavors. Certainly not a bad beer but not spectacular."

"I had this in the summer. I have to get more. This beer makes me want to curl up in front of a fire on Christmas."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer is pretty easy to drink but you would be better off sipping it - you can more greatly appreciate the subtly of the flavors and the high ABV will really sneak up on you otherwise. There is some light alcohol hints but not nearly as much as you might expect from this strong a beer. Not sessionable."
""
"Reel ahead 6 months later. I finally got up the nerve to pull another one of these out of my storage closet...shazam! What a wonderful smell, mouthfeel and aftertaste. Molasses scent, black licorice flavor and the aftertaste is difficult to describe, perhaps because I constantly want to try another sip! Chewy comes to mind, but not quite accurate, because it's not thick. Incredible flavors and I love the mouthfeel, foamy, rich and chocolatey."
"Overall: the booze are well hidden. This one is actually well balanced. I think the wood cleans this one up and smooths it up."

"Poured into a 10 oz. snifter glass. Pours s deep dark brown, with a huge, tan head. The smell is mellow roasted malts, with notes of the wood barrels and vanilla. Taste is strong roasted malts, mild wood notes and a nicely balanced hop spice. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall a decent beer, but far from DFH's best."
""
""
"O - This beer pushes the limits of a brown ale (I should know better with Dogfish Head) but is definitely tasty. Kudos to Dogfish Head for barrel-aging a beer other than a stout or a sour. You know it’s different as soon as you pour it. This is definitely a sipper due to the presence of alcohol throughout. I bought another bottle for my friend who loves brown ales and I have a feeling I’ll have to give him a heads-up before he cracks this one open. This seems like a nice introduction to barrel-aged beers for him."
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Very easy drinking for a 12% abv beer. Although it smelled a little bitter, it tasted great with no bitter aftertaste. A big surprise!"
""
"D - Very drinkable. Different and excellent take on a big brown ale. I like the smoke and wood flavors in the beer with the complexity of the rest of the flavors."
"Overall: An interesting and enjoyable brew, quite the sipper. It's good, but its a bit too boozy and quite expensive. Definately worth a shot, but I'll stick to DFH's Indian Brown Ale"
"O-- Slow drinker. Some nice things about it but too sweet and not balanced enough. Worth having here and there but not all that often."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Quite nice, an I wasn't really feeling or expecting the 12% which they balance quite well. Kudos Dogfish Head."
"This is a good beer, and probably my favorite from Dogfish Head. I don't always like their experiments, but this Palo Santo wood was a good move. It tastes more like a porter or stout than a brown ale, and it's like your typical barrel-aged offerings--but only kind of."

"Pretty solid beer that is expensive, but fun to drink."

"Rich, deep, mocha head with elegant lacing. Dark cocoa appearance. A bit weak in the nose, but very pleasant hints of caramel and wood. Satin-like mouthfeel with a mild, coffee finish. An ever so subtle booziness that is common with DH. Overall, another outstanding beer from Dogfish Head"

"They go to the extent to explain that they are very excited about this beer and it's woody housing, and that that are bearers of such wood. ""It's all very exciting. We have wood. Now you do too."" Always a classy presentation."
""
""
"All in all a very delicious beer. Definitely one to look out for."
""
"O: A robust, imperial American brown clocking in at 12% ABV; leave it to DFH to corral the chaos. A deep sipper, this would go really well with a blackened Angus burger topped with Stilton, a flourless chocolate torte or a smoky selection from the humidor. This versatile, oak-aged beauty is bets suited to be sipped and analyzed on its own, though."
""
""
"O: Def a very enjoyable beer. Bit on the heavy side so its more of a beer i'd drink after a meal or with a good dessert while relaxing. Would def drink again, and def like to try it on tap. DFH boys impress me yet again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Reminds me more of an Imperial Stout, but who cares about names? This is an amazingly robust and complex ale...worth every penny, especially at 12%abv. If you like a complex sipper of a beer, do yourself a favor and check this one out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not my favorite Dogfish brew, but not bad. You have to understand what they try to do and go with it 'Off Centered Ales for Off Centered People'. Worth a try, but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
""
"O - nothing too special. Had this beer a few times but the taste and alcohol presence doesn't excite my palate. I probably won't try this again unless it's aged at least a few years."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is almost jet black, with a tall, light, fluffy brown head. Aromas are subtle, with caramel and vanilla highlights and some woody characteristics. Flavors are booze forward, with a hard, roasted backbone to balance, and a blast of vanilla and oak throughout the palate. Heavy hitter for a brown, but this is a damn good beer! The aftertaste is surprisingly smooth and light, with a touch of booze and some nutty sweetness. Clean, slick finish that has a touch of drying from the increased ABV. Easy enough to drink that you could get into some trouble."

""
"Pours a very dark brown with a dark beige two and half finger head. The smell of wood, light roasted malt, and subtle dark fruitiness are present. Fig and plum with a bit of wood on the nose transitioning to toasty malt and boozy slightly sweet syrup with a hint of vanilla. The finish is dry with malt and warm booze. Exceptional mouthfeel, gentle but abundant carbonation which blankets the inside of the mouth, very full-bodied. Really an extremely original and very enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- While the drinkability of this one is poor, able to enjoy over a long period of time and really get all the characteristics within. Wish there was more of a burnt flavor and more hops included... Very strong and tough to finish! Would definitely like to age a bottle of this."
""
"Update on 3/21/13: had another bottle from the same 4-pack. Bottled on date of 2/2/12. Drinking over 1-year later. Smells more cherry-like, a tad sour, with notes of wood oil, brown sugar & molasses, and pine tar. Has some solventy alcohol. Roast & char seems evident. Tastes like a full, vinous, dark mother of a brew. Competes with any RIS. Still tastes good. Developing interesting complexities, but I wish I had aged this one for at least 2 more years."
""
""
""
""
""
"My opinion hasn't changed much with the Palo Santo Marron, but there's no doubt this is a very unique beer, especially since it's classified as a brown ale. The only complaint I have is that I think the booze intrudes on it a bit too much. Still, it's delicious and a beer I'd recommend everyone try at least once."
""
""
""
"A wonderful beer. Quite intense and a slow sipper. My favorite from Dogfish."
""
"12oz bottle, pours dark chestnut with an oily but creamy tan head that holds good retention given the massive ABV and leaves some chunky lacing on the glass. Aromas are oaky with vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and a nose full of booze. Tastes are boozy up front and tremendously sweet with complex notes of burnt brown sugar, caramel, oak (Palo Santo wood, but it resembles oak), vanilla, and roasted malts. Mouth-feel is creamy, smooth, and boozy enough to leave a peppery prickle on the tongue. Overall, this has always been a favorite of mine. Always love going back to it every once in awhile. It is a sipper and can be cloyingly sweet at times, but still very enjoyable."
""
""
"I aged this beer for 2.5 years, and it was AWESOME!so my rating for the 2.5 year aged brew is 4.5. This truly was good with a ton of aging. Otherwise it's a decent brew."
""
""
""
"O - I was very impressed by this offering from DFH. The aromas and flavors are a top notch combo of sweet, woody, fruity, and chocolatey. I can't think of another beer with this ABV that goes down quite as smooth as this. It is a bit pricey, but I suppose that is the cost for such a unique, barrel aged brew. Bonus points for the groundbreaking vessels they made to age this brew. I don't give DFH as much credit as they deserve, but they continue to impress me with great beers. When I am looking for a delicious, smooth, sipping beer, it doesn't get much better than Palo Santo Marron. I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was extremely impressed by this brew. Straddles the line between an imperial stout and a strong brown, with the wood and alcohol integrated very well. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden for 12%, and when it comes out, it's for the better. Best DFH beer I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A big and delicious beer. Complexity is outstanding in this beer and it is really quite a challenge to nail down exactly what is going on. (I think I couldn't even do it..)"
"O- A very innovative and tasty beer. Not something I can drink more than 1 of in a session (can I even finish this one?) but very interesting and something everybody should try at least once."
"This beer is off the charts! and by far the best 'new' beer I've had in the past many months. Almost a dessert beer, this smooth and creamy beer doesn't give away it's high alcohol content via flavour. Smooth and creamy with a caramel-malty character."

Really well balanced."

"Nose features bits of raisin, earthy notes, candied sugars, hardly any discernible booze. Pours a near pitch black with a healthy finger of mocha head that dims down to dimples. Nice lacing. Taste is very, very intriguing. Really like nothing that I can remember. Sweet fruit and malt initially. You really get the woody characteristics right in the middle and it makes for a perfect transition into some sweet heat. No complaints with the mouthfeel. Overall, this is absolutely splendid.

"Pours a deep dark brown, almost black with a thin tan head that dissipates quickly. Looks very stout-like. Aroma is filled with caramel and chocolates, a bit of vanilla and oak-like flavor, some alcohol it there too. Tastes Great. Lots of roast and dark fruits, vanilla, more wood flavors and alcohol burn in the finish. Very creamy in the mouth. Thick and full bodied. Light carbonation. This a damn fine brew, but I’m not sure I’d label it a brown. Got this as an extra, so I will leave my 4 I have cellering alone."

"O -I get this one at the brew pub in Rehoboth all the time because it's one of my favorites. This beer is so flavorful it gives me wood...chips deep down in my soul."
"Received in a grade with Slvrmon82. Reviewed from notes. Pours a very deep brown, almost black color. Body is the beer is very thick as I can't see much through it. Head is tan, stands 3/4in tall after a fairly aggressive pour. Retention isn't great, but that is to be expected. Smell is of sweet caramel malt, vanilla, roasted malts. Taste is relatively comples, from the malts I get a nice smooth sweetness. I also get some dark fruit, vanilla, woody flavors. I can taste just a hint of alcohol, but wouldn't have guessed that this was 12%. Body is thick, with subtle carbonation, this is an enjoyable beer, pretty drinkable considering how big it is. Really a great beer to share with a friend."
""

"O: Typical DFH beer. They stress the uniquie, crazy Palo Santo wood but it really only adds a nice complexity to a well-crafted, balanced beer. The alcohol is a little too present for me, but I still really enjoyed this beer. I feel like I drank this beer a little green, and it will only improve with age."
""
""
"Final thought - 12% abv, nice $3 price and may I please have more"

"Poured into a 20 oz tulip, aggressively. Pours the darkest brown ever, with a huge 3 inch head, that slowly settles into a nice eighth of inch of thick foam, with very attractive minimal amount of lace. Smell is pungent vanilla, burnt brown sugar, prunes, molasses, and booze. Taste is not as powerful as smell. Huge vanilla, wood, and alcohol, are most dominant. Body is massive like no brown ale I have ever had, good amount of carbonation for large abv, not overly dry, and a slow sipper for sure. This is a beast, but very unique and really a special beer. Don't let the first sniff scare you off, because not nearly as scary as the first impression."

"Overall: Not what I thought it would be...If I had not seen the bottle I would have not known the level of abv by taste; dangerously well-covered by lots of great flavors and depth. Appearance is lacking but Taste is what matters and this brew's got it. Pretty much everything I want in brown ale."

"Overall, I wasnt sure how this would be going into it due to the abv. However, there is so much flavor that comes through and many different layers. The wood flavor combined with the sweet caramel and the bittersweet chocolate are a great balance. Highly recommend this."

"O: Very interesting beer, definitely not an all occasions beer. This is meant to be drunk slowly and to be savored. I like it, its not exactly what I thought it would taste like when it said made with Brown ale base but it was tasty and powerful."
"Thanks to Donnie BB on the trade. Pours a gooey thick vicious black into my chalice. Darkest brown ale on earth? Very small head with minor lacing. Smell is not the most prominent feature of this ale but the taste is great. Nice and woody and malty flavor with sweetness like maple or honey smoothing the throat. Very nice mouthfeel. Very thick like eating a meal. Overall a great version of brown ale but don't try to session this. Two beers is like polishing off a bottle of wine on your own. Cheers!"

"Overall: I can't believe I've gone this long without picking this beer up; I will definitely be getting some more to throw in the closet to see how it continues to do with some time on it. Due to the high ABV, I feel that it has to be a little bit lower, but this beer is like a meal unto itself -- a fine desert beer that would probably good paired with a rich chocolate cake, or maybe even some vanilla ice cream to offset it."

"Amazing smooth ale and the last of my stash since DFH stopped distributing here. I guess I'll have to hunt some down on the next road trip as it's definitely one I want in my cellar."

"Of course at 12% this is not a session beer. One is good for a sitting. This beer is fantastic and definitely worth a slow sip to end and evening."
""
""
"O: I'm not exactly blown away by the taste, but everything works great. It gets better as it goes along. The uniqueness of the wood comes into play over time. Dogfish Head never disappoints. They've set the bar really high with other brews so it's hard to give this a 5 or 4.5 overall, but I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability - Absolutely delicious. Well balanced, yet bold as hell."
""
"O- this was a very interesting beer. I would like to try more of it. It was one of the most complex brown ales I have experienced. I would really like to see what age does to this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I thought this was another good take on the American Brown style from Dogfish Head. Indian Brown is a better beer, in my opinion, but there are not a lot of 12% brown ales out there. It's definitely a compliment that Sam can brew a big, tasty beer in a category that normally sees more mild releases."

"Overall: This was an interesting beer to make my first review. I debated going small and doing a gateway beer for those readers who haven't had the experience that I have... but then I said screw it. Go big or go home! This isn't a beer for beginners so if you aren't sure about it then I'd avoid it."

"O: This is simply a drink that I needed to be warned that it should be drank at completely room temperature. I have no problem enjoying a drink at room temperature, but please throw it on the label. After many hours it finally became decent to me, different but nice nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"D - Good drinkability, seems to me more stout-like than brown ale. Definitely could not have more than one at a sitting. Good offering from DFH, I'll let the other bottle age another year or two and see if it mellows a bit. This beer fresh would be interesting as well."

"O: Honestly, I've never really understood the obsession with Dogfish Head, most of their beers are mediocre at best, but this is the one beer of theirs' that I get excited about. It's very unique, bringing qualities of a sweeter imperial stout and stuffing them into a brown ale's body and then aging it on a unique wood that gives it a great flavor. Dogfish Head, I'll never be a devotee, but I sure will keep buying this beer."

"O: A wonderful beer. Probably wont buy this as a four pack again though; one goes a long long way."
"o - a pretty fantastic brew. definitely not drinking more than one bottle a night at 12% though. seems a bit hot when it's fresh, but at about a year and a half old, it has mellowed out just fine. more beer should be aged on palo santo wood. highly recommended."
"O - This is an excellent beer, which goes through a multitude of flavors while not failing on any of them. Lightening on the sweetness would improve this, but not much. Another great DFH to add to the list."
"a $20 12oz bottle from 2008 poured into a huge snifter. almost no head on a melted chocolate velvety sludgy soil colored liquid from the heavens. smells of booze right away, vanilla, and some kind of sappy wood. one of the most alluring aromatic impressions ive ever come across in any beer! taste is magnificent, strong, definitely wood aged, not sweet as i thought it might be, earthy, possibly raisins or even dried black currants in a nonfruity way. so many subtleties here, need more of these to disect it better. wow. awesome mouthfeel, perfect after a big meal as a slow sipper, warming up to room temperature is a must for this baby. i wonder if the vintage makes much difference here? only one ive ever had, but wow is this good. big alcohol warmth in the finish, and almost caustic if held in the mouth for awhile. 12% all the way. would love to get my hands on some more of this one!!!"
"Overall: I truly love this beer...but drinking too many in a row will definitely cloud your judgement. DFH has done a incredible job with this beer, maybe it's lust or love doesn't matter you will find a winner with Palo Santo Marron."
"Cheers!"
"O- I think I need to age a case and it might become an amazing beer."
"o - this is truly a treat for a beer. i tried my hardest to take tiny sips while reviewing so i didnt drink it all right away. only half remains though... and im feeling the kick that this beer delivers already. if you are up for a 12oz glass of wine (in terms of ABV) disguised as a beer, look no further."
"I like all the flavors of this beer individually but as a whole, I don't think they really meld together. The wood aging is also way too strong. I'm not a fan"
"Overall - This is one of my favorite Dogfish Head beers, not only is it pretty widely available but it is one of the best they brew. This is the kind of innovation you would expect from them but nothing over the top like other things they have done. That being said i had no idea how to review this one, it deserves a category all of its own, definitely not a brown ale. Great brew!"
"O: exceedingly rich and delicious. Absolutely a sipper. It's bold and beautiful. One of DFHs brews that knocks it out of the park for me."
"O: Very pleasant beer, reminds me a lot of the Dragons Milk from New Holland...definitely the most unique 'Brown Ale' I've had to date."
"96."
"O: I enjoyed it, but I don't think it was worth the price I paid for if I'm just enjoying the flavor. In terms of abv, it's not a bad deal though."
"Overall: Very complex; its wine nose is followed by a very sharp biting first sip that manages to evolve to creamy when held on the palate. Fairly well done. While it is the most complex Dogfish Head beer I’ve tasted, the balance leaves a lot to be desired. The nose and taste are very alcohol-forward, and leave little room for the bitterness and softer cream, oak, and smoke that should be at the heart in this beer."
"O: This is certainly one of the best brown ales around in my opinion. From beginning to end, I have been impressed by this one. This is very enjoyable."
"Overall, would I buy this again? Absolutely. I'm gonna have to buy a few four packs and age them. I'm sure this beer develops beautifully over the years"
"Overall, this is the greatest brown ale that I have ever tasted, period. I think that it is extremely well put together. I wish it wasn't so GD expensive but definitely money well spent. Cant wait to age the rest of my four pack and see how it matures. Well done Dogfish Head... Well done. *Starts slow clap*"
"Overall a very good beer and I'm glad I was able to try it. Not sure it is worth the price, though."
"O: This beer is just amazing. It is really expensive, but well worth the money. This is one of the best beers I have ever had in my life."
"O- One of my absolute favorite DFH brews. Amazingly unique, and really, really enjoyable."
"I've been a fan of Palo Santo Marron ever since I had it on tap in Portland in 2008. It's easily my favorite DFH beer. I reviewed a bottle in 2009 but at the time I didn't feel I did it justice so I scrapped it. When I came across a growler, I figured I might as well get in a proper tick."
"O: Glad I tried this."
"nice stuff thats got some nice complex flavors. I'd like to cellar a few and see hoe the age. real nice"
"o - Overall a good beer, but very strong. Lots of alcohol, especially in the taste. Not my favorite DFH heer, but not bad at all, and I'd be interested to see how this one ages over time. Would give it another shot."
"D/O - Drinkability is high. I think this has held up pretty well both in the way it developed in the bottle and my expectations and memory of it. It's a bit sweeter than I remember, I'm not sure if it was like that the first time I had it or if the two years of age brought it out a bit. Still, insanely drinkable for 12%, a bit of alcohol heat but if anything, it's the sweetness that would be the limiting factor for this beer."
"D - Drinkability? “Sippability” would be a better way to rate this. It has so much going on, but it's all incredibly tasty. A truly world-class beer, even more so when on tap."
"Holy lord this is one complex beer. Everything is kind of mingling around, and its kind of like a ground war. Sip this thing, and enjoy each flavor, but dont let it get too warm. The solvent alcohol flavor will start to dominate."
"O: This is one hell of a beer; it really is. I wasn’t quite expecting it, but the wood aging makes a huge difference. It’s right up there with World Wide Stout and Raison D’extra as my favorite DFH beers. Plus, for some reason, this has given me more motivation to homebrew than I’ve ever had; I guess it’s just because I’ve seen the brewing process for this beer, and tasted how awesome the result was. Great beer, great backstage videos, and now, great inspiration…Dogfish Head, you rock!"
"O: Other than the rather harsh finish, this is a good beer, although not really what I was expecting from a brown ale. I enjoyed it fairly well, but don't think it was worth what I payed for it."
"O - one of my favorites it's so great. And so strong for a brown ale."
"Stick a very thick chewy beer, it's a bit too sweet and malty for me but it's an interesting brew, definitely couldn't have more than 1. not bad though."
"O: a very enjoyable dark, heavy, angry brew, great complexity, taste and smell are really nice, overall a great one from DFH and i can see why it is ranked so highly"
"Overall: A nice complex and heavy brown ale. the smell is very refreshing. The taste is thick and complex. A great sipping brew. Cheers!"
"o - this one is a keeper, a special occasion beer, a great cellar dwellar (had a two-year old one a few weeks ago that blew my mind), a great gift. Unique and artfully done."
"Overall this is a good beer. A different flavor from the Palo Santo wood. A little on the sweet side, but very drinkable for a strong beer."
"o: I don't know how this beer isn't considered a stout. Dogfish Head's barrel aged beers are always winners."
"This is delicious. Noticeably potent, but well balanced and smooth. This drinks more like an Imperial Stout than an American Brown Ale, but that aside it's worth trying!"
"Wonderful beer. A sipper and something special. You want to linger and enjoy this. I like the fact that they made this much more accessible and put it in a 12 oz. bottle. I'd love to have this again, and it was only about $6. Worth every penny."
"O: Overall a very tasty brown ale , a bit pricey but enjoyable non-the-less, Will have this again."
"This is a real category-buster, I found this differentiated from other brown ales and superior to most of them. At the price, it will be a while before I try it again, but really, it's worth it."
"silly me why do I care about to style."
"o: would of sworn this was a stout until i read the side of the bottle and was educated. very smooth for 12%. reallly wish dfh was readily available in my neck of the woods."
"O - One of my favorite beers. Everything about it is near flawless. The only issue I have with it is being labeled a brown ale. I don't think it follows the style. It is more similar to a full bodied barrel aged imperial stout."
"O - Very good, but for the price and high abv, probably won't buy it again. But damn, packing a buzz"
"This is obviously not a traditional brown ale along the lines of Samuel Smith, but it is very unique, flavorful and worth the high price once in a while. I see myself picking it up once a year."
"Overall: The fact that this isn't overly sweet really surprised me. I thought it was complex and very interesting. The year of aging was good for this beer, but it is still a bit hot."
"**Bottled on date: 04/19/11"
"O/D-I have been putting this off due to the fact that I a) do not like much from Dogfish Head besides 60 Minute IPA, and b) Its about $16 dollars for a four-pack of this. When I saw it on tap I knew I needed to try it out. Cool beer. Not the right time of year, and a bit too alcohol ridden for my taste. Most Dogfish brews leave me tongue awkwardly too dried up from the booze; this one is no different. Good but not exceptional in my worthless opinion."
"Cheers!!"
"Pours a deep dark black color with coffee color head. Smells of olives, espresso, wood and alcohol. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, alcohol, dates, soy sauce, molasses, tobacco. Light carbonation on this and a very thick mouth feel from the high ABV. If there was like a 9% ABV style of this I think you would be able to taste more of the flavors. This stuff is STRONG.."
"Out of the bottle comes a very dark, murky brown that, once in the glass looks more like an opaque black. Very little tan/brown head developed, and what did appear dissipated back to a ring of bubbles very quickly. Smells of light woods (cedar, pine), alcohol, dark fruits, cane sugar, caramel, and faint vanilla. Tastes of the aforementioned woods, caramel, vanilla, sugar, date, plum, and a touch of grape. Not any kind of sour grape, just a faint red grape flavor. It’s balanced quite well, with only a subtle alcohol presence in the very end. Mouthfeel is great, with the carbonation cutting through the otherwise viscous fluid. I was surprised to notice the carbonation after watching such little head development in the beginning. Overall, a delicious brew that I regret not having more regular access to."
"O: Excellent sipper, but never gets bogged down. Drinkability is good. Always a treat, easy to forget that its 12%."
"O: As a special occasion beer, there are few of its equal. Drinking Palo Santo Marron is like tasting the air after waking up in a mossy glade, with the thinning fog revealing the rain-stained trunks of oak trees."
"D- This one is a whopper, it is so strong I would not have another for a while, if ever. A fun experience but not the greatest and certainly not for most."
"Overall- This beer is nothing about this beer is ordinary. I picked this beer up in a mix your own six pack. I did not look much at the label. I didnt know until after drinking that it was a brown ale and 12% abv. You would never know that it is 12%. It is hidden real well. This is definitely one of the best brown ales Ive ever tried and without knowing."
"Overall, this is not your average brown ale. Like most DFH beers, it is in its own category. But very good. I would buy this again."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the stark woodiness. Not only did the nose explode with notes of a unique woody character, but the taste correspondingly lived up to the nose’s name. What we were presented with was an epic “brown ale” which looked, smelled, and tasted more the part of a fatty stout. This being said, this was a great beer, but it seemed a little out of proportion for the style. Again, this doesn’t really matter, except for classification’s sake, but this was quite a surprising beer, and a robust one at that."
"M: Bold and dark, the brown ale is easily one of the most complex wood-aged beers I've had. Glad it was on tap when we arrived."
"I gave it a pour, comes out as a really thick dark brown color with a thinner light brown head on top. The smell of the beer is full of wood that this beer is aged on. The aroma is also kind of sweet smelling and rich with brown sugar I think. The taste of the beer is a big, it's got some of the biggest flavors I've ever had from a brown ale. There is the wood flavors, some dark fruits and a touch of coffee in there. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, decent carbonation and oily. Overall this beer is really nice, if you like strong ales this one is impressive."
"D: i wouldnt call this a brown ale, or even a strong brown. more of an american strong or something else entirely. once i get past this the fact that this is a non-styled brew, its delicious. sipper. great dessert beer with great complexity."
"O - A very good beer with great wood flavor from a wood not often used in the brewing world. The flavors work nicely and makes for a nice sipper."
"O- This is probably around the 15th bottle I have had, but I decided to review it tonight. Palo Santo is a great beer. Much more complex and stronger than anything in the traditional ""brown ale"" category, it almost deserves a category of it's own. Must try if you find it."
"O: Goes down easily, VERY tasty, not overly filling, ridiculously well hidden kick, crazy representation of style. Yea - BIG BIG BIG fan of this beer. The oak and wood notes are solid and just are amazing in my opinion. The 12 % is so ridiculously well hidden ... yea wow - if you don't' love this oaky goodness, you need to check yourself!"
"Full bodied with decent carbonation, this beer coats your mouth well but is a little sticky. The carbonation is not extremely noticeable but is just enough to help make this beer drinkable. For a brown ale, this beer is thick, but for a dark beer, it is smooth."
"O: I was expecting a brown ale with unique character. When I took my first taste, I had to double check the ABV. I didn't realize originally that it was 12%. I would say this is too strong to be classified as a brown ale, but I still really enjoyed sipping it. Not bad."
"Booze takes the cake on this one for me. A definite sipper. Other than that, it was very unique with its wodd flavors. Would try again."
"I'm quite astounded by this beer, both for its audacity and craftsmanship, as well as the melange of flavors that is at once beer and cognac, and always complex and imaginative. Some may find this brew overly sweet or sugary, but to say so takes away from the many layers of sugars (in itself quite amazing), as well as the coffees and grapefruit bitters that lie just underneath. Five stars."
"The tangy (wood?) flavor is well developed-- curiously also some iron and spice as well. Textured held up well with age. While it did improve, it's still not outstanding."
"Also, American Brown Ale. Really? Maybe American Strong Ale is a better fit for this brew."
"Virtually no head to speak of, resulted in a thin circle of head in center of glass. Dark brown opaque body, no visible carbonation. The wood aroma is somewhat balanced by caramel malts with little hop odors and a overpowering booziness. Taste is overwhelming boozy, not any balance at all. Pretty full mouthfeel with little effervescence, significant alcohol heat. I didn't like this at all and won't have any in the future. One of my least favorite beers I've had the entire year. Perhaps the issue is the Imperial Brown category, not a big fan of this, lacking in balance and nuance. Evidently I'm not an Off Center Person. Avoid."
"This was good but, as I remember from before I started formally writing up reviews on BA, this wood-aging doesn't impart the flavors I've been typically enjoying. I'd like a little less of a burnt boozy taste and that's what is memorable concerning this beer."
"O - Every once in awhile it's nice to splurge on a nice 4-pack of Palo... Plus, it ages amazingly!!! A must try if you've never, very unique! Nice work DFH!"
"Overall really tasty beer."
"I paired this with some barbecued St. Louis ribs and it was great. The alcohol was nowhere near as pronounced a I'd thought it would be. That proved to be a little dangerous and after one glass that was enough for me."
"o) this is a great beer for a night cap, so much going on I do not see myself getting tired of opening one of these, you can taste the higher ABV slightly during consumption but it definitely can sneak up on you afterwards, 2 of these and time to go to bed!"
"This brew pours a dark brown hue with very average carbonation that leaves behind a quarter finger head and no lacing,the smell is oak,brown sugar,maple syrup and boiled candy,the mouthfeel is silky smooth and creamy and the taste starts off sweet with hints of brown sugar,maple syrup,jarrah honey,a tinge of wood and is finished sweet with a sticky date pudding finish and overall even though the high 12% ABV is very well hidden this brew is way to sweet for the anyday brew and is definately more of a nightcap brew suited to sticky sweet deserts cheers."
"O: Fantastically balanced beer. I wish i had a couple more to cellar for a few years. I'll buy another one for sure."
"O: This is my favorite Dogfish Head brew. On the pricey side but definitely one I pick from time to time."
"This is a tremendous ale and it is a privilege to drink. It was an expensive case at $85 but considering what you get it is actually a bargain. Ales of this power and complexity are rare even in this “Golden Age” of the Craft Brewer. This cannot be considered a session ale, but that being said I find it quite easy to drink three of these over the course of 1 ½ to 2 hours."
"Overall probably one of the top 3 beers I've ever had. Has the initial appearance of imperial stout. The aroma is fantastic with the aged wood really standing out along with hints of vanilla. The taste picks up right where the aroma leaves off with the warm malty flavor with a high alcohol kick. At 12% you've gotta be careful with this one as it can be very easy to have one too many. By far the best beer in the Dogfish portfolio."
"What a surprising beer this was. I bought this on the DFH name alone, as I'm a big fan, but hadn't previous tried this. It's a dark beer, given the time of year, but I had to give it a whirl. I freely admit this will be infinitely more enjoyable when the weather cools down. It wasn't until I drank my first two that I realized this was a 12% beer. While it has a nice strong profile to it, the alcohol content is marginally noticeable. Be careful with these. LOL Wonderful woody/vanilla/bourbon profile. Interested in aging some of this."
"O: Great beer. Even better with a couple years on it."
"O-Another great beer from Dogfish Head. Can wait to have again"
"O- I really like this beer. It is complex and has a lot of character. Easy to have one too many. I would buy this again, but in small quantities."
"*For the record, I would consider this an Imperial Brown Ale if anything.*"
"When i poured this beer, it has a black body with a 1"" tan head, which lays down slowly to a thin lace. The smell is woody and roasted malts comes through. When i tasted the beer, my first taste was smokey, roasted malts. Then some sweetness hits the back of the tongue This beer has a thick mouth feel to me. Overall this beer is not for me, a little thick but i'm glad i tried it."
"O: good beer, will probably improve with age"
"O- This is a very good, widely available brew, and probably the best I've had from DFH. Of course it's got high abv but they masked it well. The berry and wood flavor blend so well in this. I highly recommend this and would certainly have again."
"O: I didn't expect such a widely available beer that only gets peripheral attention to have so much unique character and be so bold. I really liked this, and have 3 more from my four pack laid down and aging. I can't wait to see what aging will do to this and can't wait to revisit it. Absolutely worth picking up, as I'm sure it's somewhere around you. Few so widely available beers near as good as this."
"O: This beer needs more time, but man it's not drinking so bad right now. I remember trying this quite fresh before, and it was a hot mess. This is much better, and progressing at an impressive rate. Right now it's hard for me to assess what the potential cap of this beer could be, and at 12% abv, it could be quite a while. The complexity of the Palo wood is going to take this to new and exciting places; I anticipate that mellowing the alcohol with the wood will take this to incredible heights. This is certainly a beer to revisit every 6 months or so. What a joy it is to be able to get this in 4 packs. I'd give each bottle 6 months more than the last."
"Overall, a very good sipping beer (seriously, it's 12%!), but not your stock session brown ale. I am going to age some and see if the heat mellows as well as some of the sweetness."
"O: an absolute pleasure to drink. The year and a half has done this one well. I have some fresher bottles so it will be nice to see the change."
"An interesting beer with an interesting story. There are strong flavors in this beer but I can't get over the taste of alcohol. The alcohol is warming as it goes down. I'm glad I've tried this beer but will probably reach for something else the next time I'm in the mood for a brown ale. I would be very interested in trying this out of the tap however."
"O- enjoyed this as it warned lots of barrel aged syout qualities is a very drinkable brew"
"O: Overall this beer has taken a year of aging very well. This is a very unique beer. Not really your typical brown, but a true stand out in the style."
"So worth the 15.00 for the 4 pack. If you want something that is hard to put your finger on in a good way pick this up."
"O- I am not a fan of big boozy beers and this beer was pretty boozy and left a good amount of burn. This beer had some good flavor, but just a little too boozy for me to buy this one again. I think I would have liked this beer a lot more if the booze was turned down some."
"I agree with BeerGut4Life. I bought it in a store where you can make your own 6 packs and on the wall of bottles I saw this beer out of the corner of my eye. I saw on the description that it was a Brown Ale but even though I've had some of the other DFH brews, the 12% ABV made me just grab 1 bottle. I was prsently surprised that it was syrupy, almost like a porter. Sorry I bought just one. Pricey at about $13 for a 4 pack. Will definitely pick up some more. Good long finish. The ABV had a delayed reaction on me - not something you're going to sit back & knock off afew while watching the game"
"Not quite what I expected for the style, but very interesting and complex. A nice compliment to grilled steak."
"O – Definitely not what I expected from a Brown. It's almost stout like in look and flavor. Nevertheless, it is delicious, and I'll be saving some to review in a few years."
"Smooth, well balanced and brilliantly complex. A fantastic beer!"
"This is a well crafted, complicated, sipping beer that is great with a cigar or for a night cap."
"This pours a black color, I did an aggressive pour it ended up with a pretty brown head, it leaves a nice lacing and thick legs. The smell is roasted malts, there are some sweet scents, vanilla, caramel, a the booziness is present also. The mouth feel is thick and creamy, its wonderful, one of the most smooth and creamy beers I've ever had. The taste is great also, caramel and roasted malts, a hint of vanilla and some alcohol burn on the way down. Overall this is one thick creamy tasty boozy beer, very good stuff, one of my favorites and its beers like this which cause me to continue to search out new brews."
"Drinkability: Smooth. But, honestly, if you don't enjoy a red wine..you may not be so keen on this brew. At 12% alcohol (more comparable to wine than beer), there is a relaxing buzz. Good for a mellow afternoon/evening."
"O: Such a pleasure to drink this beer, it's expensive but worth it if you love bold, thick, dark, malty ales. Also it's worth mentioning that I got this from beersofeurope.co.uk a few weeks before Dogfish Head announced they would be stopping exports so i'm quite lucky I have had a chance at trying this (plus I have one more left which will be saved for a cold winters evening!) Dogfish Head are truly a credit to the US Craft Brewing industry."
"This brew was darker than I expected pouring from bottle to pint. The wood notes were strong but also vanilla notes stood out adding a dessert-like feel to the beer. There was a bit of punchy finish with the higher ABV, but I found the beer to be refreshing for the summah times in ME. Although, I have a feeling I would love one, or a few, in the snow!"
"I think we need a new category for this beer. How about we call it an Imperial Brown Ale? The flavor of this beer reminded me a lot of Bourbon County Stout. Even with the faint booziness, it's hard to believe this beer is 12% alcohol. According to the label, this beer should be aged to allow the flavors to round out a bit. I concur. I think I'll go back to the store tomorrow and buy a few more bottles so I can age them."
"overall: very well done, the unique character of the wood enhances the basics in a unique and complex way, abv is high and what you would expect from a barrel aged beer/malt beverage, heavy bodied and wholesome, very pleasant to drink, only reservation would be a bit more carbonation could be desired just to enhance the mouthfeel and liven up the appearance."
"O- It’s a big beer, complex, as it warms up the beer definitely begins to taste better, Im glad I was able to try it, but it’s not a beer I would seek out again."
"Overall- I am really pleased with this brew. Wood taste is surprising but in a great way. I am glad I picked up four of these to put a little age on them and see what happens."
"As far as drinkability goes, there's some heat on the tongue, but it's fairly far from the taste buds."
"This beer pours a dark brown with nearly no light getting through, the head is dark tan to light brown in color and it recedes fairly quickly. The smell is slightly roasty with hints of vanilla and an interesting woody aroma. the flavor is similar to the smell, the different woody aroma is p front in the flavor with the finish being slightly burnt and malty. the mouthfeel is medium bodied with lower carbonation. overall this is an interesting beer not ad, but would not buy it often"
"O: Easily one of the best year round dogfish head brews. This brewery never seizes to amaze me. What an exquisite beer."
"Overall...I love this beer. It's a complex sipper that always wakes up my palate. ""Brown Ale"" is deceiving, but you have to call it something. This would be in my top five desert island beers. I never get tired of it."
"I do suggest seeking it out.... if the flavors described are your thing. However, this beer is worthless greeen. Aged two years it should be impeccable."
"O - Very complex and interesting beer overall, definitely one to sit and enjoy, particularly since the 12% ABV wouldn't really work as a session."
"Smooth/velvety mouthfeel, medium bodied with low carbonation. More similar to a porter in body than a brown ale."
"Serving type: bottle"
"A creamy flavor but a but on the bitter side and a bit hard to swallow down due to the alcohol content and its carry through on the flavor."
"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 02/22/11B. Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a very thin ring of light brown head. Aroma is boozey. Raisins, dark fruits and earth notes. Hints of chocolate and burnt coffee. Flavor is a boozey mix of some coffee, raisins, and earthiness. Vanilla as well. The finish is a mix of alcohol along with the vanilla and caramel flavors that come from the wood barrels. The high ABV and the overall boozey flavor to this one hurt its drinkability but all things considered you can still drink it at a decent pace. This beer has similar flavors and qualities to it that some of the other high octane DFH beers have, like WWS, Olde School, etc. Overall, its a solid beer and a nice twist on the style. Worth buying."
"Overall - very tasty and interesting brew! Another good one from these guys!"
"An aggressive pour yields only a half-finger creamy mocha head. The beer is a dark, opaque chestnut brown. Wonderful aroma, full of vanilla, hints of warming alcohol, sweet toffee and dark fruits--much like a stout but heavier on the dark fruit and a lighter roasted character. This sure comes as a shock to my IPA-laden palate--layers upon layers of malty goodness. Roasted/nutty malt is much more apparent in the taste with some chocolate as well. Lots of caramel/vanilla sweetness, the wood aging seems to be doing great things. Warm finish with the alcohol helping to dry it out. Aftertaste is highly reminiscent of a nice rum. Full-bodied, low carbonation, this is a unique beer that deserves to be slowly sipped and treated with respect."
"I just tried this for the first time at new local hot spot “La Birreria at Eataly” on 6.11.11. Served in la birreria’s signature chemistry beaker-esque wine glass, this yields the darkest brown color, crosses into black, and sits under a light cap of tan foam. The nose carries a solid aroma of deep dark roasted sweet caramel malt, fresh brewed espresso, vanilla cream, and alcohol. Mouthfeel from start to finish is a crisp and complex malty one with well pronounced and pleasant notes of dark roasted cocoa, caramel and what I suspect to be the “holy tree” wood accent of the Palo Santo. This has Dogfish Head written all over it with its deceivingly hidden abv and friendly finish. I’d love to pick up a four pack or two and immediately start aging these guys…"
"Rum hits the mouth followed by plumb and raisin and then a chocolate coating. Finishes dry and smooth at the same time, weird but delightful. It has an overall earthy character that ties it together. An excellent brown ale - royal and over the top - but damn good."
"It's been a while since I've had this beer and it far exceeded my memory and expectations. Get this beer if you have the opportunity."
"0- This is a nicely balanced beer, the flavors taste great..the vanilla and molasses are nicely complemented by the smoke, oak and alcohol. The oak and alchol flavors become more intense as the beer sits, so if thats what you are into, i'd recommend that...really enjoyed this and will certainly be having a few more in the near future."
"O. Wow. Dogfish Head is my favorite brewery, but as this is the first time I've had their PSM, I am surprised and impressed. The flavor gets better as I drink it, it smells great, this beer is just awesome."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer much more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant surprise, but I most likely wouldn't have more than one per evening."
"The mouthfeel is on the thinner side of full-bodied and has the right level of carbonation. The drinkability is fairly good for such a huge beer, this is a sipper that reveals complexities as it warms, but surely isn't hard to drink. Overall, this is a great brew. I know Dogfish calls this a brown ale, but I'd easily call this an imperial stout. It looks like a stout, smells like a stout, and tastes like a stout."
"This beer keeps getting better. This review is of a bottle ive had since march 2009. If only the smell were a little more interesting and it were slightly less sweet. The sweetness comment applies to pretty much every dogfish head beer, though. I think i will have my ladt two bottles each year for the next two years and then buy four more..."
"O- I think you have to be careful drinking this because it is 12% ABV, but you don’t taste the alcohol. It will sneak up on you. I found it easy to drink, it has a complex taste with so many flavors that come out while drinking. I enjoyed this beer a lot. I don’t know how often I would drink it, probably more in the winter time. It reminds me a lot of an Imperial Stout."
"Overall, a suprisingly easy drinking brew; good interestin flavors nearing a an aged rum with caramel/vanilla/ester notes. A little knock on the mouthfeel and appearance as this is a touch cloying on the finish and very dark for a brown."
"Bottle dated: 10.13.10A"
"Overall - This is not a horrible beer, but definitely is not one of my favorites. The bite may be too much for me."
"Amazing and well worth tasting if you want to try a new kind of wood flavor which is rare/unusual."
"Overall: A very good brew. Above average for the style, and impressive taste considering the high volume of alcohol. I could easily make this a weekend sipper (one or two bottles ought to do the trick...three if I didn't have to get up in the morning)."
"Full bodied, and thick. One beer is plenty, with this one."
"O: tasty beer, the wood helps make the beer."
"Poured into a DFH Signature glass. This brew pours a near black and produces only a slight tan head. It is a big and bold Imperial Brown ale that can hang with some Imperial Stouts. Wonderful aromas of plums and raisins and black cherries. The sweet fruits smell delicious.The carbonation is low and the mouthfeel is medium thick.  Flavors of blackberry and burnt cherry are immediate along with dark fruits and chocolate and hints of expresso and malt. Dark and sweet fruits go back and forth and lay down the flavor profile. This brew is amazingly complex with a slight licorice and bitter black coffee finish. The alcohol presence is there but not overwhelming. This brew is delicious,of my absolute favorites. "
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and puts a very dry feeling onto the palate. Sweet malts and a touch of smoke stick to the palate. Overall, what a fantastic slow sipper. This will age so well."
"I'm a little weary of Dogfish Head in that I would like to enjoy everything they make, but some of their brews just don't impress me. This is probably my favorite of their beers that I've had so far."
"O- Glad to have finally tasted this one. Have passed it over for far too long. If I had two...sheesh. Sneaky, potent stuff. Will have again. Yummy!"
"Overall, I wouldn't reach for this too often, but it's a nice one to have around. Quite drinkable yet complex."
"O- This is an excellent beer. On bottom of the bottle is 3110 B2 1750. I'm assuming that this was bottled 3/1/10 and batch/barrel 2???? Consumed the bottle on 5/19/11. Anyways it was excellent and I highly recommend it."
"O: This beer an intrigues me. Like a Lay's potato chip, I can't have just 1. It says 12% but tastes more like 6-7%. Definitely a creeper. Other beers have come and gone but this beer has a permanent residence in my fridge."
"O: This is an interesting beer. You cannot sit down and drink one. Its like an entire night of drinking in a bottle. Incredibly interesting and wild. An experience that is worth having."
"An absolute must for anyone who enjoys adventurous ales."
"Do yourself a favor and savor one."
"A good brew, one of the better ones from DFH. ABV is pretty well-hidden and I like the uniqueness of these barrels. A definite winner."
"Overall, I had one of these when it was fresh and a little bit of age surely does this one justice! The alcohol eased up a bit and the flavors have melded together very nicely. A better beer at 6 months and a great beer in general."
"it pours a deep dark brown with a gorgeous light brown head. it smells rich of vanilla and something dark and fruity. leaves a good amount of lace and legs when swirled. the smell also greatly increases. the taste is sweet and smooth with the vanilla, chocolate and what tastes like liquorice mix then leave you with a nice bitter ending. the mouthfeel is super smooth though somewhat oily. Haven't had this one fresh, but aged 6 months is very very good."
"Cheers ~ !"
"O: Wonderful, delicious beer. Taking a brown ale to this height without falling apart or exhibiting flaws is a real accomplishment. Well done!"
"O - i have been enjoying this brew for a while now, and it continues to grow on me every time. I love it and it has earned a permanent residence in my beer fridge. i do wish the carbonation was a bit less but other than that, I love lamp. As it warms it improves dramatically. Drinkability hard to determine"
"Just did not like this beer at all. Poured a thick, dark, sludgy black color with an off-white head that quickly dissipated. Smells like...wood and alcohol. You can't really get a sense of the malts or hops in my opinion, and I was not impressed by this beer, especially for the style. Tasted like I was licking a piece of freshly cut wood. Not cool. Mouthfeel was thick and unpleasant. DFH has much, much better offerings!"
"Pours a stout-like coffee brown with a thin cap of foam which dissipates pretty quickly. Lacing is minimal. Nose is not at all what I was expecting: a strong candied banana and marshmallow (?), which recedes to the secondary as it warms, transitioning closer to the usual coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, plus some fruitiness. Taste is similar, with now some caramel and some astringent oakey dryness. Other than this, the oak is not at all evident. A nice medium-full body with a fitting high carbonation, with some but not a ton of heat. Overall, I'm a little ambivalent: this was interesting and unexpected, but I'm not sure I would reach for another."
"O- Brilliant!!! (insert standing ovation!) This is one of DFH's finest, and being that it's a year round brew... I can't wait for it to show up on shelves near me again soon!!!"
"O: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer - there are certainly some very strong flavors that I could imagine being perceived in many ways, but it worked for me (though did become slightly overwhelming by the end). I love all the earthy notes that come from the wood and for all of the flavors it was extremely well balanced."
"O - I have loved this beer since it came out and am so glad that it is in the regular line-up. Such a great concept for a beer and one that actually comes all the way out in the beer itself."
"Overall – Just a superbly well crafted and well balanced beer. It falls into the category of a “must try” beer in my opinion."
"Drinkability - Great comfort beer, nice warming feeling goes with this beer, would be great on a cold night (Have to get some for the winter) Goes awesome with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream."
"There's something evil about this beer, in that you don't know quite what you're about to get until you pour it into your glass and you see the devil. It was thick brown/black, like 10W30 oil, with a head that once you got it out was a cap. The smell was powerful good, something from a wonderful beer dream...forget the fizzy lager smell you associate with beer and take a giant whiff of this potent mamma. Roasted malt and alcohol were present, along with what seemed like dark fruits. The flavor was also roasty with a warming alcohol, and finished with a long lingering burnt sugar. Very thick in the mouth and down the gullet, not something you'd want to (or be able to) have a 6'er of anytime. Overall I'd say aside from the thick feel, this beer is something to save when you have no heavy machinery to operate anytime soon. A very good experience."
"This one is a very thick and heavy with soft carbonation. Not bad here, I think there are other browns I would pick over it but a unique beer worth trying."
"Poured a dark, opaque brown with very little head. Sweet malts in the nose, with a bit of hoppiness coming through. More malts in the taste, with some nuttiness and caramel, with a tinge of dark fruits evident in the background. Medium mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable. I'm not a huge fan of brown ale, and this one wasn't too memorable."
"O- A solid beer with a lot of complex spicy and roasty flavors. Aging it on the wood gave it some really nice characteristics."
"I like what they were trying to do, they just went a bit overboard. Then again, that might be precisely what they were trying to do. It's a decent sipper anyway."
"This was a powerful beer, giving me an instant headache from all the smoke and spice - but in a good way, like some holiday porters do, y'know? It had sweetness to it, but also a spiced bitterness that worked to really cover up the 12% factor - I really couldn't tell it was that high of an ABV. I had it on tap a few weeks later at Howie & Sons, and it tasted pretty much the same as it did in the bottle. The color is beautiful with little head and it is fairly viscous, but somehow that didn't bother me because it had enough spice to brighten it up."
"This does not taste like a brown ale per se - if anything it should be called a black ale. It pours thick and dark with very little head. It reminds me more of a porter than a brown ale. It has heavy chocolate and fig overtones with a slight hop finish. I have never tasted anything like it. It is not too sweet and not all too dry. There is a strong alcohol presence but not in the least bit over powering (unlike the strong Bastard American ales, of which I am not a big fan). This is a great beer and one that is definitely worth a try."
"It pours very dark and thick into the glass. The smell is a strong liquorice and leaves a mocha foam that dissipates quickly. The first taste has some sweetness and dark fruit, but it mellows out and finished slightly dry with a nice roastiness. The alcohol is hidden by lots of flavor, but this is a big beer. Interesting and well balanced."
"Overall I thought this was a very good and unique brew, really different from your typical American Brown Ale, I never see one this strong. From my experience it seems like Dogfish Head has a thing for making unique and extreme Brown Ales, you usually don't see much creativity with this style. To me it seems like Shorts and Dogfish Head are leading the way in making unique browns, I like it. The taste of this beer was pretty good and complex, the Palo Santo wood imparted some nice flavors that I liked and I thought they worked very well with this beer. For being 12% this beer is dangerously drinkable, they did a great job at toning down the booze and making this seem much lighter then it really is. I would buy a four pack of this too keep in the fridge. If you like browns but want something bigger and unique, give this a try, you might be surprised. This was another great beer from Dogfish Head, you guys keep on impressing me."
"Overall, I'd say this is my favorite beer out of Dogfish Head. I love their 90 minute, but this is just so unique and different."
"This beer has serious wood flavor, not to mention a very high alcohol level. I am an avid DH Indian Brown Ale drinker so I had to try this, but prefer the original. Would definetly order again though since I don't find often at bars. Plus with twice the alcohol it could save some cash."
"Overall, this is great. One of my favorite from Dogfish Head, and a wonderful, unique beer all-around."
"- Overall I am impressed. This is certainly another to buy again. I openly admit I am not the biggest fan of this brewery... but this one changes my mind.. a little ;) Go get it!"
"I think Baton Burton is dogfish’s best beer, but this is a very close second. These guys made me a beer lover, and this is proof I was right to follow their ways."
"O- Great beer. Seems a bit more like a porter or stout to me. But, still a great beer. At 12% though..."
"This one reminds me a lot of a bourbon barrel aged beer, but less bitter. It has a sweetness I wouldn't have expected from how dark this beer is. It does have a big of an alcohol burn to it. and the high ABV makes this one a sipper, but a really nice beer. Glad I took a chance on it."
"This is a really really delicious beer. Rich dark malts, wood, a bit of fruit. It's shockingly un-boozy for the ABV. And just like that, my glass is empty. As with some of my other favorite ""brown ales", it pushes the boundary between this style and porters/stouts. Shortly after Dogfish Head officially pulled out of Wisconsin, I passed up a 4-pack of this on a trip over there. I'm really regretting that now."
"Poured a dark dark brown almost black color with very little head on it. Smell is decent enough. Not a whole lot coming through, but some sweet malt and alcohol coming through. Taste is not really to my liking. Quite a bit of caramel malt flavor with the alcohol coming through on the end. Not picking up the fruit notes that I see others writing about. Relatively full mouthfeel, this beer is pretty syrupy and thick. Overall an OK beer, but not incredible in my mind. I probably won't buy it again, but it was worth trying for sure."
"Overall - Not very pleasing. The pour looked good and smelled ok, but I did not enjoy the taste at all. I had a hard time finishing this one, and poured out the last inch or so of my glass down the drain. I usually like the DFH beers, but this one left me a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended!)"
"Drinkabillity: Dangerous. I wouldn't be pounding these back all night, but at 12% it's dangerously drinkable. It's not quite the palate wrecker that some beers this caliber and strength are though so you could theoretically transition to lighter fare if you'd care to."
"A great sipper or desert brew. Though Id like this round after round, that could be trouble."
"The Rest: Body is very full. Another very unusual one from DFH. I'd put this in the same category as ApriHop and Midas. All very interesting beers, but not ones I really feel the need to try again. Although, if I was offered one of these three, I think I would go with the Palo Santo."
"This complex and spot on ale hits the spot everytime. 12% doesn't even leave a trace. So do yourself a favor and go pick some up today!"
"O: A complex and potent brown ale."
"O- Awesome beer. A bit heavy for most, but personally I would love to have 1 of these rather than 2 or 3 of another beer. Not for the light-palated."
"Drinkability – A smooth sipper. Mysteriously complex and expertly crafted."
"A truly terrific brown ale. I can't comment on how much the aging from the wood barrels has improved or changed this beer, but it's certainly good as is!"
"O: I'd consider this one to be the little brother of Worldwide Stout. It's a little more enjoyable than the stout to the average joe, as it's not as alcoholic and sweet, so it'll match better to a wider variety of occasions and meals."
"Drinkability is great for 12% abv. You only pick up a touch of booziness. Palo Santo Marron is definitely an end of the evening sipper and a good one at that."
"O: Didn't even realize it was 12% until I read AgentMunky's review. And I agree with him. Dangerously drinkable. Highly recommended."
"D- Well done beer by dogfish. Not the most drinkable beer tho."
"O: Overall I would say that this is a very nice beer. I enjoyed the spicy notes in the beer which gave it more character. It's 12% and it doesn't overpower the flavor which is awesome. I can't give it 5.0 but it was really close."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish Head snifter. Minimal lacing and excellent head. Pours a deep dark maroon/brown. Aroma is slightly medicinal, of some licorice, cherries, chocolate, wood, and vanilla. Tastes of chocolate, cherries, vanilla, slightly medicinal and metallic, and woody (Palo Santo?). Excellent lingering aftertaste. This is one of DFH's best."
"A very nice beer that would go well with dessert or sitting by a fire on a crisp evening."
"Not a beer I drink regularly, but it's decent enough to try again."
"The beer certainly contains alcohol and will let you know it right away. Yet it is very drinkably and is therefore of the dangerous kind. I love this beer and certainly will recommend it as a secret specialty, because a specialty it is. I really start to like the experimentations of Dogfish. Great job."
"But don't worry Sam, we get it. You are a pioneer in your field, seeking new and innovative beer flavors. I respect that, and appreciate your contributions!"
"YOU MUST TRY THIS, BUT GO SLOW!!"
"Overall this is a solid beer. A definite sipper due to the richness and high alcohol content at 12%."
"Stunning drink after sitting down for a long, long time. It's definitely held up after resting for a couple years!"
"O: I'm pretty dissapointed by DFH's effort on this one. This isn't a multi-dimensional brew and leaves quite a bit to be desired."
"I can't lie. I'm not man enough to handle this. The boozy ether flavor is way too strong. It tastes like a stout with a shot of scotch in it. The smell is great, looks great (ultra dark), no head, good mouthfeel. The taste of bitters plus malty booze is overpowering. I bought a 6 pack, I don't know when I can finish this."
"Overall, I think I was distracted by the fact that this beer was allegedly a brown ale. I didn't find it to be similar to any brown I have had, but it was still pretty good."
"Pours a deep brown, near black with a big soapy tan head. Smells of dark pitted fruits, molasses, bananas and cloves. Slight woody/vanilla notes as well. Big caramel malt sweetness, brown bread, figs, chocolate and vanilla/wood. Alcohol well perceived, but doesn't distract from the brew. Finishes very sweet and sticky. Full bodied mouthfeel with moderate-to-low carbonation. I haven't had this beer in a long time, and I must say it is much better than I remembered. Very solid brew."
"Not really a beer that really fits into a category but it's meant to be off centered right. Rather complex mix of flavors, like a dark earthy dessert. A definite sipper which I feel hurts the drinkability a bit since you get that alcohol kick more often. Bold and uncompromising, a strong ale with good complexity, not the kind of thing you'd want to session but a unique offering."
"O - This is a very good and unique beer. It's got the color, some notes and mouth feel of a strong stout but with some unique earthy sweet notes. I'd get a few bottles to let sit for a while. I'd also order again on tap, maybe once a year."
"D. Deliciously dark beer. Let's you know that it is a BIG boy!! A real pleasure to sample, so glad I have a few more of these to go at."
"This is a wonderful beer. A definite slow-sipper, nightcap kind of beer, due to the richness and high alcohol content."
"The beer pours a very dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is very strong and very spicy. I get a lot of woody notes, which I presume is from the Palo Santo wood. I also get some dark fruit notes in the aroma. The flavor is very similar. I get a lot of oaked and wood notes, as well as some caramel and roasted malt, vanilla, spices and dark fruit. The alcohol is definitely present, but it is not overpowering. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very well done beer."
"Further notes take 2-I had a bottle of 2010 and 2008 tonight (3/1/13) for my birthday. Both were very smooth without any hot alcohol taste. I really want a few fresh bottles to compare with these that have some age on them because the alcohol seems to completely have mellowed out. If I had to pick, 2008 was a little better than the 2010 as it had a little bit of sweetness that added a nice element. I have five bottles left of the 2010 and I plan on letting them sit for awhile."
"overall: No way i would guess the ABV from the taste. A wonderful concoction. One of my favs. Thank you DFH."
"Overall - Right on par with other dogfish head beers, too many flavors, too sweet and intense. It almost works but its too much to enjoy. I like the dark fruits in it, but too much alcohol and sugars. I would love to try this again at around 8% and less sweetness. Its not bad, id drink again but nothing to seek out."
"T: Very hard to believe that it's so high in alcohol. A bit syrupy, but this is one delicious beer. It shows some nice hints of the aging in a bit of an earthy/smoky flavor. The finish has a bit of espresso and there's a lot of sweetness upfront in the form of molasses/raisin. Tasty."
"O: Great sipper - can't get through it quickly but it's good offering from Dogfish Head."
"D: Although delicious, not very drinkable. Between the complexity, medium viscosity, and the alcohol content, this is a sipper. It's one that you will really enjoy sipping on, though. I wish I had a few more of these to enjoy on a cool evening."
"I was really quite impressed with this, enough to hope others try using this Palo Santo wood too. Poured a slow to emerge 2"" head. Looks dark as a black ale. Taste is like an exotic Imperial Stout with vanilla, caramel, coffee, plus what I'd describe as slightly over-ripe canteloupe. Quite rich, and a long finish. I could gladly substitute this for the majority of Imperial Stouts on the market."
"D - High ABV is hidden well, good brew to sip, would only want one a session as is very rich in taste and at 12% isn't a beverage I'd want to drink a lot of at one sitting. Another interesting creation from the folks at Dogfish Head."
"Overall this is still quite good and really masks the high abv somewhat too."
"D - Not a bad sipper, but this isn't something I can drink much of over a given period. Still, it's nice to keep a sixer around just in case the mood should hit. Finely crafted brew from DFH!"
"Overall another different take on a beer, just like DFH likes to do. This is very different that they get props for that, but it just seems like they tried to hard on this. An ok beer, but I won't seek it out much again. Enjoy in small quantities."
"For a 12% beer, this is very very drinkable. However, make no mistake, the booze does start to become noticeable. I wouldn't go through this too quickly.... but it is tasty enough that I have to be careful to take it slowly."
"Pours a deep brown, burnt caramel color with a a dk. cream colored head. When it dissipates, it's hard to tell this beer apart from flat cola in a glass. The smell is great, woody, smoky, pipe smoke. The taste is kind of similar, with a hint of roasted dark fruits (cherries, figs). I also love the sweetness of this beer. It has that ""sticky"" quality that's great."
"I guess ""epic"" isn't a bad word to use to describe this beer, so long as it isn't confused with ""excellent."" That said, I really do love it, and I'm tempted to buy some from time to time just to have it lying around. Still, it's a little too strong to really be enjoyed to the fullest (in my opinion) and I can't see how aging it even longer would change the flavor/make it better. After the first few sips, the taste gets a little monolithic, but it's still appealing. Kudos to DFH for giving it a shot."
"Love the rich deep mahogany color of this brew. A brown top with long legs to match. Awesome. But that's where the goodness ends. A beer that is overpowered and buttered with Palo Santo wood is one that attacks the palette. Not a fan of the hints of sweetness here either. Mouthfeel was average, but feeling over carbonated for this suite of flavors. Overall a disappointment for me. The 12 alcohol on top of all this just makes this whole brew seem like a marketing joke. Sorry, normally enjoy dfhead. Not this time."
"Had this at Beer Bistro in Toronto. Pours a very dark brown colour with creamy tan head. Really nice head retention, lots of lacing down the glass. Smells very woody, I suppose like palo santo wood (though I have no idea what that smells like). There is also a chocolate and fruity aroma. Flavour has more bitterness than I expected, though the wood seems to dominate the aftertaste. Nice thick mouthfeel. I didn't know this was 12% alcohol until I came here to enter my review, so it hides it well."
"the CPJ"
"Full-bodied and with decent carbonation as well as a warming sensation from the alcohol. Overall, this is an interesting brown and somewhat enjoyable, but the alcohol flavor gets a bit overwhelming after about half-way through the pint."
"A dark brown brew with a fair light brown cover and modest lacing. The aroma suggests a light citrus hop over malty licorice. Nice. The flavorm comes on with much the same in addition to some very definitive raisin. It's pretty intense with malt and an almost minty licorice idea with a vanilla alcohol edge. It's near full bodied, somewhat cloying in its intense combination of sweetness and tasteful bitterness. Carbonation is mild and drinkability is marginal due to the thick character and alcohol presence. There's a slight peaty, almost seaweed-like base in the malt side of this quality brew. A real tasty treat but not something for the sessioning."
"Drinkability - To take a brown ale, age it in wood barrels and have something like this come out is true artistry. This tastes like a bourbon-barrel-aged offering, but it isn't. Drink it close to room temp and you will enjoy it as the flavors further opens up. The presentation, the flavors, the sipping quality of this beer makes me come back to it on both chilly evenings and non-chilly evenings alike. One of my ""top 3 beers"" from DFH. Well done."
"D: Easy drinking but no more than one. Turn down the heat, start a fire, throw on your favorite sweater and kick back with this. A really great beer."
"D - I got this back in April of last year dated ""July 2010"" so after six months this beer is just perfect. Was really avoiding it because of the ABV but it drinks the best I ever seen for the style and volume. Recommended!"
"So, pretty intense beer. Just finished one with dinner and I'm still enjoying it's aftermath. Pours smoothly with a dark, uniformly dirty coloring. Smells like booze - the alcohol comes through in the smell as much as, if not more than, it does in the taste. Ultra malty beer with maybe a touch of caramel. The label mentions something about vanilla, but I think that gets quickly picked up by the more molasses-y tastes. Sweet leather, that might be a good way to describe it. Maybe not. The paolo santo wood notes come through though, quite strong. Overall I recommend it, but I think the tastes might be more muddled than usual for DFH."
"I found this beer very drinkable and easy to sip on without hesitation. Not something I would enjoy more than 1 of at a time though."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkablility: This beer is slightly over medium bodied with incredibly fine carbonation. Super smooth and creamy; I don't think a brown ale gets any better in this category. This is a huge beer for the style at 12% ABV. That being said, I'm a total sucker for it. It combines most of my favorite beer qualities into a somewhat random style, and the ending result is phenomenal."
"Drinkability: Fantastic session beer, best enjoyed in good conversation with good people."
"D - Highly drinkable for such a powerful flavor and alcohol content."
"Really like this one!"
"This combined great with my shepherd's pie dinner - both were very substantial."
"Having a second bottle from the same batch a week later. This one sat at room temp for a few hours before I opened it up and I'm enjoying it quite a bit more as the sweetness does not seem as cloying."
"D: Great sipper! No need to rush this one. Well balance and very good representation of the ""ABA"" brews. Aging 3 more from 2010. Time will nake this even more complex."
"Definitely a sipper. Enjoy every minute as the 12.0% ABV warms the soul..."
"O: Very heavy and flavor-intense beer, great for sipping after dinner. I dont think I could drink more than one 12oz bottle at a time. I'd also like to add that this beer feels and tastes more like an imperial stout than a brown ale, and if you enjoy a good stout then you will love this beer. Overall its a very good brew, but not worth $15 for a 4-pack."
"Very dark brown, almost black and opaque. Smallish dark head that dissapates to not much quickly, not much in the way of lacing. Aromas of bourbon and booziness are prevelant, smells like the inside of a barrel maybe? I don't know but the tastes like it was aged in a bourbon barrel and after the initial alcohol-y pow you get from it, there is a delicious barleywine with booze covered dried fruits. Definitely an alcohol driven beer at 12 percent. Thats true for most good barleywines of course though. Creamy mouthfeel backed by mild carbonation and an alcohol twinge. If you like barleywines, this is a good sipper and one that you can enjoy as it warms up."
"D: A wonderful sipper, but the sweetness is a bit much for me, personally. A very nice, big beer, though."
"As I type my final thoughts, I can still taste the wood in this beer. Incredible! Almost like licking a board... in a good way that I never knew was possible!"
"Mouth feel with thick and not overly carbonated. Drinkability was pretty high for a high ABV and sweet, thick beer."
"D: As mentioned above, I found this a lot easier to drink than similar high gravity beers. I especially like how pleasant and 'soft' the finish/aftertaste is."
"Overall a fantastic beer. Dogfish Head scored a winner!"
"Overall: A very original and tasty brew! I like this one, but can't quite put my finger on what it is that pops out. Overall, this is a unique and damn tasty beer!"
"Dec 2012 update (after 25 months of aging): the primary characteristics are a big coffee roastiness and a vinous quality. the mouthfeel seems none the worse for the wear, a little lusher actually. the alcohol does not seem as prominent (but that could be due to palate change from sipping a lot of spirits in the meantime), but the lack of complexity is disappointing. the beer is good, but certainly not great. currently drinking around a 3.8 - 3.9, and the dominating roast is discouraging me from planning on buying more next time i'm in dfh country."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with a thin khaki color head which gives way to some decent lacing. The aroma has a nice big vanilla smell up front with hints of dark fruit and a nice oak and woody smell. The taste has a nice malt backbone with a nice vanilla flavor that is rounded out by dark fruits and a nice woody taste. The mouthfeel is low to moderate carbonation. The drinkability is high a nice complex taste but also an easy drink with the alcohol well hidden."
"I'm surprised that I can actually taste some hops in there as well especially when it states that it's a malt beverage. Don't let anyone tell you this beer doesn't have hops in it... they say it in their Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron documentary video on youtube that they use Glacier, Palisades and another hop that I can't remember. Wood in beer especially with the caramel rich dark malts is a perfect pair. Really, this beer is the most unique tasting beer I've ever had."
"D-probably can't have more than one at a time, but the one is pretty good, I especially like that the alcohol isn't in your face"
"D- Really impressed with this one. Can't do more than one in a sitting, but will certainly return often"
"D: This is a little hot but it has plenty of flavor and goes down surprisingly easy for its strength. It would probably be a little better at colder temperatures."
"Not a session beer but an exquisite beer for the discerning beer fan. This has got a very strong, rich taste which is best savoured. For such a strong beer the alcohol taste is well hidden (but not completely eliminated) by the distinctive flavour. One to try if you're looking for something different."
"Verdict - I have had this twice now; once bottled and once on-tap. I wasn't a huge fan of it either time. I think that the ABV is simply just too high and not blended correctly for this type of beer. This is probably my least favorite Dogfish head beer."
"D- this beer vanished in no time, very drinkable for the ABV"
"Wood is very present, with definite pecan undertones. Vanilla and caramel present themselves in the finish. Moderate alcohol warmth present in the finish. Brown sugar and smoke."
"Found more alcohol in there than I expected given comments from other reviewers. Didn't stop me from making short work of it though."
"Overall an absolutely fantastic Brown Ale that sits on the palate and lets one enjoy the complexity of it, without a heavy alcohol presence."
"Pours dark brown, nearly black, slight tan head that settles at the edge of the glass, a little lace shows up towards the end. Smells of roasted malt, caramel, alcohol, vanilla and bittersweet chocolate and all those notes were in perfect harmony with each other and easily detectable. The palate is very roasty with flavours of vanilla, bourbon like notes, alcohol, rich malt and coffee flavours as well as some caramel. Very complex and well balanced. Medium to full mouthfeel, slightly creamy and a nice amount carbonation. For something so strong it drinks very well, though the ABV is notable it feels nowhere near 12% it is a slow drinker but I handled the bottle with ease. would have this again every so often as a nice little treat."
"Drinkability- this beer is super complex and has much going on in the flavor profile overall there is a lot i like about the flavors of the beer, it has just the right balance of sweetness and alcohol that stop both from becoming to out of line, certainly very interesting beer thats one slow sipper to savor on cold winter night,"
"D - This is a SLOW drinking beer, at least for me. The strong flavor, somewhat atypical to American brown ales, may not appeal to everyone. It is worth stepping outside your comfort zone to give Palo Santo a try."
"D: Not very drinkable in my opinion. I shuddered on my first taste...something I never do with beer. As many others have said....I wanted to like this...gave it a lot of sips...but it just was not happening for me. This literally tasted like the vile cough syrup I used to take as a kid. Why would I pay $3.50 a bottle for that sensation? Well....I won't ever again! This dog was a drain pour."
"The taste is boozy, woodsy, sweet, and nutty. The 2008 is also sour. I wouldn't let this one sit around for longer than a few months - the 2010 is considerably better than the 2008. Both are thick with very low carbonation and have a low drinkability. I prefer my brown ales to be lighter and more drinkable. I like this beer, but I don't love it. If I want a big strong beer, I would prefer a Russian imperial stout or a barleywine."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a huge rocky tan head. The taste is unlike anything I have had before. Starts with sweet vanilla and caramel followed by wood. Finish is long and dry with a bit of cherry and alcohol warmth. Superior lacing. Incredibly creamy, too."
"D: Dangerous. This is one of my favorite beers of any style."
"Along with 90 Minute, this is one of the best all around beers from DFH, which manages to be memorable without the unnecessary addition of tomatoes or snozzberries."
"Strong, but enjoyable enough. Couldn't have too many of these though."
"Other bottles i've had have been in the 4.5/A+ range, this one only earned a 4-ish, but this beer is usually the best Brown out there. Love it."
"Pours a jet black w/ thin caramel head that quickly dissipates. Woody smell, and I actually said ""Wow"" when I smelled it. The taste is really good. Woody, chocolate, fruity, and I think I taste almost a hot spicy taste in there too. Can't quite put my finger what that is. Not a trace of alcohol in the taste, and a great mouthfeel. 12%, so 1 beer and I'm feeling it. Sneaky. This is a really good beer, and one that I've bought on numerous occasions."
"This drinks pretty easy for such a high abv."
"Mouthfeel is very good. Nicely carbonated - creamy and smooth. Finishes relatively dry for how sweet it is."
"Overall I'm very happy to have tried this beer and hope to have it again in the future, next time with some age on it."
"They packed a lot of flavor into this one and although it is a bit sweet and cloying, the wood mellows it and it becomes a fine beer."
"I definitely liked this better on tap, but it's a very good beer in either context. The woody character comes through strongly in the smell and taste, and there are some other complexities as well. But this bottle sample is just a little too dry and bitter to call wicked smooth. I wonder how it ages. If I had reviewed what I had on tap I would surely have scored this higher."
"ps - Hopefully in the future we can see Dogfish make a beer as intense as the 120 Minute IPA or World Wide Stout aged with this Palo Santo wood. Just wish thinking!"
"A decent brew. It doesn't do anything astounding, however."
"Full bodied, sticky and chewy, lighter carbonation. Pretty drinkable considering the richness and abv. The wood aging gives this an interesting flavor profile that I've enjoyed a number of times."
"Other than slowly sipping this for a cool 45-60 minutes, it almost has zero drinkability. The high alcohol content (12%) renders this brew an ""only one"" endeavor."
"D - Its a bit overwhelming to do more than sipping."
"M/D: Thin but the ABV definitely comes through. Dangerous because it's nice and smooth."
"Poured from the tap a dark ominous brown that could be called black. Small rose color in the bottom of your glass when held to the light, small one finger tight off white head that laced for most of the beer. Smell is roast malt, wood, dark fruit, cofee, chocolate hint of vanilla and a lingering warming alcohol. Taste is fantastic complexity, warm bittersweet chocolate with a bite of wood from the san palo wood, coffee and roast malt mix with sharp hops that fade into more roast and a sweet big malt bill finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and heavy very large body but fills the beer out nicely. Drinkability would be much higher if the abv weren't so high. That being said please pass me another!"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter glass. Pours very dark brown, almost black with a small brown head. Reduces to a whispy covering and leaves a little spotty but short-lived lacing. Aroma is roasted malts, brown sugar, vanilla, and the wood is big on the nose, also some spice. Flavor is vanilla, molasses, malty, and spicy. Long spicy finish. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, medium carbonation. Interesting beer though I won't seek out for it again."
"Overall this is a decent beer, but I was expecting more from it. I was surprised how much of the alcohol came through in the smell and the taste, but other than that, this is a really good beer. I recommend it."
"Overall: Very good overall. I would definitely have it again, maybe closer to the source next time."
"Dogfish really knows how to stretch the boundries with their brews, definitely seek this out."
"I was excited to find this beer on tap on a recent trip to Sacramento. Because of the alcohol content, this was served in a 8 oz stemmed glass. Very dark foam that laced the glass well, otherwise looked much like a stout in color. I picked up some hints of coffee and a little sweetness. A very nice finish and not the strong alcohol presence as I was expecting. Very enjoyable beer to be savored."
"Mouthfeel is nice, but perhaps not as thick and smooth as I'd appreciate. Very drinkable, though. Tasty stuff."
"Found this gem at Whole Foods in Chicago. It's like a cross between a barley wine and a coffeehouse porter. I don't know if it I would consider it a brown ale. A little smokey and delicious. The high alcohol content (12%) will calm you down after a long day :)"
"Wow - A very complex beer that just gets better and better with each sip. Flavors definitely change as the beer warms. I noted flavors of coffee, chocolate, and woodsy vanilla. At 12% abv, this is a sipper for sure. I am fortunate that this beer is almost always available in NC. I've had it before and will have again many times. An excellent winter warmer."
"A well hidden alcohol presence makes this a sipper."
"D - good very strong brew so you might not want a bunch a once but definately wont turn it down either."
"Drinkability: Definitely a slow sipper due to the high ABV, and with the higher alcohol bite, I feel that this has to be paired with a meal, and the right meal at that. Stand alone it's a bit much and I seem to remember as a bit more drinkable when on tap. Not a bad beer at all - just something I have to pace myself on and ideally, I'd prefer to have something like this with something else to balance out the high alcohol content. I enjoyed it, but it's definitely one and done by itself."
"This beer reminded me a lot of the (512) Bruin. Definitely a double brown. It poured a dark color, almost a stout... But still definitely brown. The nose was darkly fruity. Thhe taste was along the lines of dark fruits, mellowed by the wood they were aged on. I didn't pick up many wood notes, but my palate might not br adjusted to those. This beer was crazy drinkable for the ABV. It hit a lot of great notes and it was definitely the better of the double browns I've had... even though I loved the (512) version."
"Full body, a little chewy, and a sticky finish with lingering sweetness and alcohol vapor. Incredibly smooth and an absolute pleasure to drink. I wish I could have a constant supply because it is a gem of a beer. Definitely fits Dogfish's ""off-centered"" idea, because this is nowhere close to a standard beer, let alone a regular brown ale."
"D: A smooth and drinkable beer. I could throw a few of these back in a sitting. Not bad in the least."
"D - sneaky strong, I sip this one slowly though. Reminds me of something I would want to drink warm in a whiskey glass..."
"EDIT-Did a side by side tasting of this fresh and at a year old."
"Feel is pretty full, poppy and the mild carbonation is perfectly balanced. Coats the tongue with a warm alcohol burn. Booze is def presence, and while I might not be able to drink a bunch of these, the one is def enjoyable."
"Well done dogfish head."
"M - Medium bodied. Sure of itself. Proud of its mouthfeel."
"Definitely a different beer. Love the light-burnt wood thing. The chocolate and cherry nuances are very nice. When it's on, I could drink this anytime/anyplace - inviting. like a good wine - fine anytime. Best sipped, though you surely could pound these down - ask Papa."
"M-full and creamy. the chewiest brown i've had. i'm getting a fork and knife to finish this one."
"Colors, carbonation, even smell don't matter if the beer tastes bad."
"Taste is roasty, and a little smokey, balanced with a spicy fruit trickling underneath. Raspberry? Kumquat? Anyway, quite good, surprisingly drinkable, and not quite like anything I've had before. Will be on the lookout for more."
"D: Not something I could drink a six pack of but one every now and again is a must."
"Appearance - very dark maroon brown color, very pretty but little head retention"
"Thanks cam!"
"Pours a very dark brown with very little head. Smells very spicy and woody. It's a very unique smell. Tastes very strong. Sme bitter herbalness going on. Spices and wood. Very interesting. A bit boozy and sharp but very tasty. A fairly drinkable beer for the percentage but it's potent with the different flavours. Petty unique brew"
"D-Although heavy and strong, each sip of this beer leaves you wanting another. Highly drinkable."
"D-With my preferences it is not the most drinkable brown ale. Nice to have one or two but that's it."
"An excellent beer, my absolute favorite from Dogfish Head"
"D: Dangerously drinkable. Pair the surprising 12% with the sheer drinkability and soft mouthfeel of this beer, and I'm not sure I would it ever occur to me to stop drinking. I can't decide whether a 12 ounce bottling is prudent or tragic -- I want more. Absolutely recommended, and I hope to acquire another sooner rather than later."
"D - tasty. an interesting and well put together beer. I wouldn't be drinking very many of these though, as the ABV and sweetness limit the drinkability. but I am glad that I tried it."
"a very drinkable complex beer, there is a lot going on here and if it wasn't for the 12%abv. could be enjoyed 3 or 4 at one sitting."
"D: gosh, I want to drink like a dozen of these, or at least continuously have the sensation that I'm drinking one. But I'm sure I couldn't."
"Very complex. Not as much vanilla as I thought would be there. Aftertaste is a multitude of varying flavors. This is of course a sipper. The drinkability is pretty high for the alcohol. A fun beer to explore."
"Drinkability - awesomely drinkable, dangerously so. While writing this review I've finished mine and it is pretty potent. Very interesting beer from an interesting brewery give it a try."
"seved in a tulip glass cellar temp."
"D: Its better pouring into a snifter O tulip style glass. Enjoyed better in small sips. grows bigger as time goes on."
"It's a sensation but I'm not super anxious to have it again."
"The beer is very nice. I like it a lot. I don't know if I can drink a lot of it as the abv is still 12%, but it is definitely tasty. Who knew a brown ale could be this. Dogfish did well with this one; a nice change of pace."
"As I sip this dark concoction I pause to roast the recently departed Brewmasters, a show that had so much potential, if anything from Sam's endearing and likeable personality. But alas the powers that be (i.e., an ice cold bitch in a dark suit) have pulled the plug and moved on to other projects of less moral value and with fewer white rappers. So let us take a moment to bow our heads and remember the show about beer that finally got picked up by cable, only to be tossed around time slots and eventually killed, like our old friend Mr. Belvedere. Fare thee well Brewmasters, and may we perhaps be lucky enough to see your Season 1 DVD set in our Christmas stocking next year... along with some Burton Baton. Amen."
"This beer is smooth and a bit thick. The feeling is pleasant, but the drinkability is limited by the booziness and the intensity of the flavor. I enjoyed it a lot, but I'll be waiting quite a while before I crack open another bottle."
"**As a side note, I'm rating this beers drinkability as a 4.0 because though I surely enjoy one, and maybe two, this is not a beer to drink all night."
"Maybe I just wasn't ready for this one. Not your typical brown ale. I will revisit it."
"D - I'd classify this as a sipper. It tastes good, but some of the prominent tastes are kind of strange, and it's a strong beer. Drinkability is ok."
"Overall, I was very impressed by this beer. It is definitely the best brown ale I've had, although it is unlike any other brown I've tried. As usual, Dogfish Head continues to impress me."
"Palo Santo Marron pours like a stout. It's totally black with a milk chocolate crown. It comes to about three fingers in height. Retention is off the charts, the head just won't fade. Lacing is solid, but holding the beer back from true excellence. The nose is good, but could stand to be a bit more punchy. Lots of milk chocolate, and a hint of herb/spice in the background. I find a bit more going on on my palate, most notably some vanilla, though caramel also shows up. The slight warming sensation from thew alcohol folds in very nicely with the notes I'm getting from the herbs and spices from the hops (and possibly the wood). Palo Santo Marron is just as rich as I'd expect a 12%, all malt driven beer to be, which is extremely so. Carbonation is spot on, enough to cut through the heavy body, but still restrained enough to let the malt shine. Dogfish Head's beers are sometimes hit and miss for me, but fresh Palo Santo is in the running for my favorite of their beers."
"D - I had one and I was DONE. No way I could have more than two really but it TASTED very drinkable.. my brain knows better though - changed rating to overall instead of drinkability"
"D: There is too much weight and complexity to this one to drink too much back-to-back, but very tasty and I would not hasitate to have another or reccomend it."
"One of the better crazy brews by DFH in my opinion. Definitely does not taste 12% and is remarkably balanced. If not for my preference for session beers then this one would rank higher."
"Drink: One 12 and I was done. Very big beer. Might try and age a few."
"Rich, warming, full-bodied, this is a serious sipping beer. Lightly effervescent. Extraordinarily good. DFH hits another monster hit for us ""off-centered"" imbibers with this 12% ABV brew."
"Solid wood-aged offering by DFH. A bit on the safer side as far as their experimental brews go, but this one will definitely keep me warm on a winter night."
"I cant believe this beer is 12%. It is well disguised for such a high ABV. I may go pick up a 4 pack for aging purposes. Would love to try this again in a year."
"I really liked this. I just wish I had it again or had put this review up earlier so the experience was more fresh in my mind. Overall, I want to drink this again, definitely."
"What a beer..."
"Perhaps this is the beer world's answer to a fine port. One of my favorite late night sippers. I generally don't drink more than 1/2 to 1 bottle, and it lasts for quite a while, but I like to have this on hand for sipping over a long evening. There's not much better. Life is good..."
"This is a big beer that I would enjoy on occasion. Very bold beer."
"For a 12% the goes easy"
"And maybe that's what these reviews all come down to in the end. Context. Regardless, this A+ has gone to an A- for me. Still - it's a hell of a beer."
"For it's high abv it is quite drinkable, but need to be careful. Price will keep me away from it somewhat"
"Smooth and creamy in the mouth, most peculiar brown ale I've tasted. Still though, well delivered and well done."
"Thanks to a good bud I got to try this one. Palo Santo pours a deep dark brown with a tan head that dissipates quickly to leace a nice ring. I might be crazy, but I really smell banana right up front. Also smells of vanilla, and a red wine, Very Interesting. Tastes of roasty coffee, molasses and vanilla. Mouthfeel is creamy with a nice nip of carbonation. Im drinking it quite easily now."
"D - At a year+, this has really turned into a nice beer. Mouthfeel is wonderfully thick and satisfying, booze heat is entirely gone, the flavors have really mellowed and melded together. A great sipper which gets better as it warms."
"drinkability - price brings it down a bit as does the ABV, but this is a really great beer that you should try if you get the chance"
"D: A sipper. Big boozy flavors and some heat, but its really tasty."
"Pours a very dark brown with a nice creamy brown head. Definitely as a vanilla and malt aroma to it. The taste is malts up front fading to caramel and vanilla and a slight tart aftertaste at the end that's present but pleasing. ABV is 12%, but it doesn't taste that strong. A creamy, velvety mouthfeel."
"D - High ABV is fairly well masked, though it's tough to really hide 12%. Some very unique and delicious flavours on this one. I could easily drink a couple of these in a sitting, though would not want to get too carried away. Another winner from DFH!"
"D- Its something to try. Not a session beer and might take awhile for some individuals to drink. It will not appeal to everyone."
"D- I'm glad this beer comes in four-packs and I look forward to trying another one in a year or so. I can imagine the wood notes putting some drinkers off, however I find the unique flavors in this beer fascinating."
"D- Heavy beer strong booze taste, if you like knawing on wood you like this brew... it is pretty dam good... i may just start chewing on trees"
"something bold, try it - just might win you over."
"Slick body, the carbonation could be higher."
"I bought the bottle at the brewery in October of 09 & it's been in my cellar untouched since then... Pours a deep brown basically black with a small espresso swirl head and some small fleeting lace. The aroma is raisin and plum with a fair bit of booze in a rich almost wine like way, not like the cheap vodka booze aroma you get from many high gravity beers. This blends well with the whole bouquet and compliments the notes of vanilla and aged rum. The flavor is nutty and a bit spicy, quite a good bit like the spices in anchor Christmas ale (woody, zesty, potpourri like in a way) As the glass progresses dark fruits show up with some nice roastiness and a good bit of heavily toasted French oak. The palate seems a tad think for as big as the flavor/abv is. Really a very nice sipper."
"D: I would love to make this brown one of my regulars, but the 12% on this baby limits that chance quite a bit"
"Not a bad beer, not an everyday beer and worth a try."
"D: Unlike many high abv beers, Palo Santo goes down easy. It's not heavy like many stouts. If anything slows you down, it's the flavor. This is a unique beer. Not for everyone. Palo Santo presents a taste like no other."
"This bottle was dated 12/1/08. It poured a motor oil viscous black with a dark khaki head. The aromas are very woody and sweet. Two years on it kind of smells like a barrel aged baltic porter. It has this very subtle sweetness that I can't quite put my finger on. I'm totally digging it right now. The taste is very, very woody. It tastes like it's a cedar aged American strong ale. It has good smokiness as well. It's very Beer Geek Bacon like in everything but body. It's definitely thicker. It's exceptional really. Two years have done this bottle well. It drinks so well. It is exceptionally smooth and has a good, full body to it. It drinks thick but smooth at the same time and is really top notch in all facets. This would be more drinkable if not for the content. This beer is superb with some age on it."
"D: This is a sipper for sure, but there is a lot going on with this on. Very interesting beer. Glad I picked this one up. Would highly reccomend this beer."
"Seems like a mutant version of a good port ( I mean it in the best way) it would go excellent with spicy food( I had mine while eating Mapo-Tofu)Great smell reminded of good espresso from Kona, toasty woodlike finish balanced dark fruit medly, could not attribute to any particular one. Great mouthfeel has nice chewy feeling to it. Would love to try with a nice piece of stilton cheese. Like the Midas Touch its not an everyday beer."
"UPDATE: Should definitely be consumed young in my opinion. Just sampled a year old version and all of the above flavors were much more muted and less enjoyable. Around 6 months of age is all you need on this brew."
"Pours an almost jet-blackish brown. A tan head forms, but soon becomes a ring. Not a lot of stick, but this a pretty heavy beer.. Smell is sweet and medicinal. ""Dark"" comes to mind in both fruit and malt. Definitively sweet, but with a rich, mocha dessert-like taste that really compliments the complex woody qualities. The feel reinstates this, and as much as there thinness and heat to the equation, just as much is taken out in the dryness and flavor extract qualities on the finish. I am taken into those wooden containers, and that is both an exhilarating and strange experience."
"m: The alcohol is very dominant. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated."
"D: Something I would definitely buy more of. It's got a very nice blend of bitter and sweet. Tastes great."
"The alcohol is readily available on the pallate and that makes for an extremely desirable taste."
"Pours a viscous black with a thick two-toned tan head, labyrinth-like webs of lace trail almost artistically around the glass. Malty, woody, boozy sweetness with hints of vanilla, coffee and toffee. Refined and rich, at 12% this is a big boozy sipper I'd save for the coldest of nights."
"poured a very dark brown almost black with brown highlights that had a thin head and left very lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was pretty roasty and woody alongside chocolate, vanilla, toffee, and slight coffee, notes. The chocolate was more potent on the palate with oaky wooody roasty accents and some boozy character to help out on the balamce but definitely had the tree flavor. The brew was medium to full in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, roasty, slight astringent, woody, creamy, finish. It drank decent and was a beer that I could sip on all nite."
"D- Might improve with age, but should be more drinkable fresh. I will probably try it again with two or three years on it"
"it's pretty heavy, but not too boozy right now. 12oz is plenty enough for me."
"D: medium"
"Overall, this is an incredibly complex beer that I would like to pair with a meal. It drinks almost like a wine. I will drink this again."
"D - Fantastically one of my favorite beers thru and thru. This is a rich complex very creative beer infused with many different complex flavors and smells. The alcohol content is 12% that complements the rich complexity of this brew. A masterpiece...just wish it didnt cost so much o.O"
"D - Good beer; another well-built unique ale from Dogfish Head; this is definitely a sit-down & sip beer; touch of class and distinguished flavor"
"D - Ha ha ha. Would love to have a lot if I could."
"(D)- This beer woud have been perfect for me but ths only thing that stopped it from being a 5 was the high amount of alcohol. All in all, another ""Off Centered Ale"" from Dogfish Head that does not disappoint!"
"D- Not sure, this is so over the top for a brown ale and the 12% can be tasted and felt. You wouldn't want too many of these, its a sipper."
"Would certainly recommend aging the Palo Santo Marron."
"D - hiding all 12% of the alcohol would be impossible, but they did a damn good job trying, the vanilla aspect makes this a unique brown ale, very well done. Oh, and the AGLC can kiss my ass!"
"Overall--interesting and enjoyable sipping beer."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A solid sipper to say the least. Although this is a beer I would probably only want to drink in the fall/winter months. If you're looking for a nice sipper, but are tired of Barleywines and DIPA's...this just might be your huckleberry."
"This beer doesn't throw any punches and doesn't hide what it is. It is very robust and strong and is not something to drink every day, this is definitely one to savor and experience. I don't really like the syrupy mouthfeel but it makes up for it with lots of flavor. The one flavor drawback is the strong alcohol aftertaste. Otherwise it is a very enjoyable beer."
"D: Not meant to be gulped down, however a nice brew non the less. I do not typically go for brown ales, but this one is nice."
"D: It goes down well and the abv is well masked. I have a hard time drinking multiples of this style, but I do enjoy them from time to time."
"Drink: One of my new favorites. I will drink this again"
"D: Would not want to drink to much of this too quickly. Drinkable enough to sit down and split a few bottles with friend now that winter is here."
"Pours a dark black with a dark brown head. Very little head retention or lacing in my case. You can definitely smell the 12%. The vanilla also comes out in the nose as does the roasted chocolate. Big flavor. A little vanilla and unsweetened chocolate malt to start. Then the big wood flavor takes over. Huge roasted notes as well as some alcohol to finish. Taste reminds me of a camp fire. Well done. Thick mouthfeel and good drinkability for the ABV."
"Pours in thick. Its black in color like a porter/stout. Has a healthy brown head and there is a lot of lacing going on evenly around the glass. Smell is sweet and alcoholic. There is a lot of vanilla in the nose. The smell of vanilla extract and alcohol come together to create a bourbon scent that is very pleasing. Smells exactly like Jack Daniels oak bbq chips. There is toasted malts, berries and alcohol present in the taste. The sweet malts are right up front hinting to you flavors of berries. Then the alcohol comes in and dominates, then ends with a nice toasted coffee finish. Has a smooth mouthfeel. Its a little thiner than i anticipated but not bad. Carbonation is just right, not too much not too little. I don't think i could drink more than two of these. Its a delicious beer but at 12% wow. This is a big beer. Its a sipper for sure. But a very enjoyable one. That being said I would definitely buy this beer again."
"D - Probably have to keep it to one on this guy. Good beer, but very overpowering."
"Serving type - 12oz Bottle to oversized brandy snifter"
"The smoky flavor is just great and is the long and short of this beer."
"D: An incredible beer, definitely making my favorites list. Should be enjoyed slowly and decidedly. The high alcohol content blended so smoothly I didn't even notice until I was nearly finished enjoying."
"A great offering from DFH."
"M/D - Wanted to try it since I love the Indian Brown so much. Glad I did. Probably won't come back, but ya never know. I thought I'd never come back to a 120 or WWS and I have. Big beers are fun, but not something you pull out when you are having a session night."
"A very interesting beer that all should try at least one time. I would pick some more for those dark, cold winter days to come."
"Dark stout like appearance but the nose doesn't give you the whole story of what an amazing beer this is. I really think that I am in love with this beer. Words cannot describe just how gorgeous it is. Go and try it for yourself. If you love Big Dark ales with the slight sweetness of a Russian Imperial then you too will be in for a real treat!"
"Drink- Wasn't too overpowering and if it wasnt the 3rd beer of the night. I'd run to the store for more. But after a combined 28% in 3 beers. Im cool in front of the comp typing my reviews."
"D- sip this! While it's tasty, you gotta be careful. It's just a stellar brew that will make you appreciate the artisan aspect of beer"
"Despite the woodiness, the beer drinks insanely smoothly for 12%. It is a slight bit boozy, but it's not unbearable. The perfect beer to enjoy as the weather grows ever colder all around us. My wife drank three glasses of this in less than 90 minutes."
"D: One 12oz bottle is perfect to be split between two people . Very powerful beer and meant to be sipped."
"D - A busy beer, innovative and a decent drink. A sipper for me due to the booziness of it."
"I really liked this beer. Reminded me a little bit of Dragon's Milk from New Holland Brewing Company. Pours thick and tastes even thicker. A rich blend of flavors, light carbonation, subtle hops, somewhat sweet. Delicious! This ranks in the top 10 of all beers I have tasted."
"Anytime you have a beer this strong, there are a couple of things to expect going in: a lot of sugar, low carbonation, a general likeness to syrup or wine, and the inescapable presence of alcohol. That said, this was one of the better high proofers that I have tried. The carbonation was surprising recognizable, the barrel aged smokiness provided a good offset to the sweetness, and the boozy factor was not a deal breaker. Palo Santo's intense substance might limit you to just one."
"Neat idea from Dogfish but not one of their better ales."
"This is a hard beer to get around. The flavour is okay but the balance is all wrong and the alcohol too high. This would be a much better beer if it was 7% instead of 12%."
"O: Not quite the meal in a bottle that brown ales typically provide, but it's definitely a sipper."
"Had this one in the cellar for 3 years and the aging really dried out the beer and allowed for the wood notes to come more. It poured dark brown with a nice hoppy nose combined with the smell of the Palo Santo wood. I liked how it tasted like a brown ale on steriods combined with Porter like notes. It also had Barley wine flavours with the aging . Unique beer that showcases a distinctive barrel flavour"
"very enjoyable but no more then one do to the dry mouth"
"Drink-ability - Great for sipping"
"earthy big ass beers often work well for me and this is no exception, other then the triple vision and my inability to convince my girlfriend that I'm cool this ones a winner"
"D. I love this beer. I love the creativity of Dogfish head. sometimes they fall flat other times they hit a homerun. This is a winner!"
"D - Less booziness than expected from a 12%. Certainly would not cal it quaffable, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Drinkability is pretty good for 12% abv as it drinks like 7% and some mild light sticky finish but mostly clean and bit of lingering hops."
"Pours a very dark brown with a brown head. I had no idea this was such a dark beer. For some reason I thought this was going to be an amber colored ale. I had no idea what type of beer this was when I got it. Smells dark, hints of caramel, and some alcohol notes. You can definitely taste the alcohol. There are really nice tastes of dark malts, caramel and toffee notes, a little hop presence, and it tastes surprisingly creamy. Mouthfeel is good, like I said, creamy, medium-heavy bodied, with nice carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good for this beer. I drank this surprisingly fast for a 12% brew. Good job DFH you never disappoint."
"The Palo Santo Marron has a high drinkability for a 12% beer. Great for pairing with food. A canidate for one of my top ten all time brews."
"Drinkability- It's scary how drinkable this beer is. I could probably drink enough of this delicious ale to put me into a very, very deep coma. I will be on the lookout for this on tap pretty much anywhere."
"Overall: This is a very good beer. It's not what I would consider a brown ale but Dogfish Head doesn't fit within typical categories most of the time anyway. I would recommend checking this out if you have the chance."
"At the price this sells for I would not recomend this to a friend."
"Pours an EXTREMELY dark brown with a nice medium brown/tan head. Scent is lots of wood, vanilla, light espresso, slight alcohol, and cherries. Tons of aromas coming outta this beer. Taste is quite delightful. Initially I get strong vanilla and cherry flavors followed by some great wooden flavors. Then it end with a bit of molasses, espresso, and chocolate. The booziness is pretty noticeable in this beer though, which isn't necessarily always a bad thing to me...but I would like this one a bit more well-balance with the rest of the tasty flavors. Mouthfeel is creamy and not too thick. Drinkability is fairly high due due how tasty it is."
"D - I remember trying this a few years ago and I really liked it...maybe the bottle was aged because this keg was pretty fresh...really strong wood aroma and flavor with minimal sweetness...alcohol is there but somewhat hidden in the flavors...but watch out"
"Full bodied beer drinks very easily, but the nice flavor profile encourages sipping. Would definitely look to have this again."
"I had it ice cold, as cold as they come. Although I'm not a huge fan of this brewery, I did enjoy thier pumpkin. Not worth the $3.75 I paid for the bottle, but I guess since it is triple the alcohol, I guess it was a deal."
"D - Just outstanding to drink. Great with food and you don't feel too much alcohol at all."
"Mouthfeel is full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"Nice deep brown pour with some tan head. Aroma is sweet malts with a hint of vanilla. Flavor follows the nose closely - very very tasty. Smooth and creamy - this is amazingly easy to drink considering the 12% ABV... you really don't even notice the alcohol. Very very tasty. Will definitely be drinking more of this."
"Unique offering to me and I like to sip one regularly. Pairs good with a mild cigar."
"#4- Graveyard"
"Good beer, but a bit too boozy for me. I like this as a sipper, but not my favorite DFH offering. Nice flavors and a good brew just the same."
"D: a deeply intriguing brew from Dogfish. It really sticks with you, there is so much going on there it's almost hard to sort it all out. It's definitely for sipping only, I can't imagine having more than one of these a sitting."
"A real dark brown appears in the glass, a few shades of black. Shit is deep. Finger or two of chesnut head, settles to a think collar and an even layer of head rests on top. Retention is real nice here. Nose is nice an complex, tons of nuts, vanilla, wood, some brown sugar sweetness. A quick whiff brings some alcohol and dark licorice here too. Loads of chocolate, some coffee notes, roastiness, and some dark fruits. Maybe a slight hint of smoke? Some vanilla and wood flavour lingers on the tongue, as the alcohol pops his head in to say what's up. Mouth is silky and smooth, full bodied with some moderate-low carbonation. Relatively filling and quite a sipper. Alcohol is somewhat masked, and makes this one dangerous."
"pours dark with one finger carmel color head, depending on how you pour it. there is a slight hint of alcohol on the nose. aroma is a nutty vanilla with hints of carmel. Taste is clean, hint of citrus and spice. its quite different than a traditional oak aged brew. malts seem to dominate, as there is only a slight hop's bitterness on the finish. this is a great brew but at 12% ABV, its quality over quanity."
"D. With a year on it, it's not surprising that it hides the 12% pretty well - still detectable but not overly hot or boozy. I'd definitely accept this if offered, but I'm not sure I'd pick it up myself."
"Pours a deep dark mahogany brown, nice cap of stiff khaki head and good retention and lacing. Scent is dominated by wood, like smelling the sound hole of a high quality acoustic guitar, alcohol and earthy spices dance across the nose as well as roasted and toasted grain. Taste brings all the great qualities of scent - this is about the wood more tthan the beer itself it seems, which is a very good thing. Full bodied, wood aging smooths the body perfectly, great carbonation level. Pleasently suprised that the draft version of this beer was so much more agressive yet focused than the bottle version."
"Drinkability: Strong ABV; slightly overwhelming. Excellent ""sipping' beer, but unless paired with hearty food, 2 pintsEasy to drink, but will drink better older..."
"Dangerous if you ask me."
"Drinkability -- A quality beer that's more akin to an RIS than a brown ale. Very unique, lots of good stuff happening and it's especially drinkable for 12% abv, but the wood is quite overwhelming, as if someone dropped a cone of sandalwood incense into my glass. I can easily grasp the appreciation, but I may hold off on drinking another until I forget all about what Palo Santo tastes like."
"Overall- This has a very strong woody aroma and flavor, so I can see where some people may not go for this at all. But I really like it every now and then, its a great one to keep in the cellar."
"I really can appreciate this beer. It's big...very big. The drinkability isn't wonderful obviously, but it's something that needs to be sipped on and appreciated. This would be a fun beer to let a newbie to craft beer try."
"D- this is a 1 beer night type of beer @ 12%, probably won't go back for another, but it is another very nice beer from DFH."
"Decent brew but ive come to expect better from dogfish especially for that price."
"Serving type: on tap (Al's Pizza of Hampden)"
"Overall: This is my favorite DFH beer hands down. An amazing amount of complexity. I can honestly say I love this beer. And the fact that it's a yeAr round release is awesome. I don't think I'll ever be without a 4 pack of this on hand at all times."
"D: This is one helluva brew and it shows why people keep buying Dogfish Head beers. Kinda crazy but totally approachable. Be careful with this one though, the high abv could sneak up on you."
"Overall, I'm not terribly let down. I was really looking forward to this, and it's a lovely drop in many respects--the taste wasn't as outrageous as expected, though. A great quaff, still, and worth the price."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent beer, but it's very assuming, and flaunts it's 12% ABV. Very potent."
"D - Another interesting beer from Dogfish Head. Wouldn't drink more than one but I'll probbaly be being some more."
"D_Definite sipper. One will probably do it for me. Pretty boozy."
"American brown ale doesn't quite cover this. Really quite special."
"D: Friggin' Good sipping beer. Way too potent to drink every-day, but for a special occasion, as a nightcap or with a hearty tempeh steak."
"I enjoyed drinking this beer, the extra deep brown body intrigued me and the smell had my mouth watering. The alcohol may have been a little too prevalent of a taste but I still really enjoyed this one."
"D - tasty but not something I could drink a lot of"
"D - wonderful, one of my favorite DFH beers. a year has mellowed this out a bit, need to pickup a 4pack and hold onto some others even longer. held back a bit by overwhelming alcohol at times, but the other flavors are really starting to make their way out."
"This is yet another one of those extreme brews from DFH. A very heavy dark brown ale with definite potential for aging. Although it is a great beer it is very strong and i wouldnt suggest drinking more than one or two. That being said, it is a very rich and malty brown ale."
"D: Pretty good."
"D: Sure, but this one is a big beer, so I can not see myself pounding these."
"The mouthfeel is thick and has average carbonation. This finishes dry, and has a good aftertaste. The beer is very drinkable for a high ABV brew. It goes down smoothly, and doesn't overwhelm you. The only thing that turns me off slightly is the alcohol taste that shows up in the middle of each sip. Overall, a high quality brew."
"D: Of course it can be hard to drink because the alcohol is so present, but the taste really makes this beer a pleasure to drink and after that alcohol diminishes you want more simply because of how good it is."
"A very rich, creamy feel in this beer. The lack of carbonation lets the heavier flavors shine a little more to me. There is a nice warmth in each sip without the usual booziness that comes with that which is surprising considering the alcohol content. This feels like a real home run to me, strongly recommend."
"This beer has a lovely black/brown colour. The head lasts about a minture, which is decent for such an alcoholic beer. This beer smells of smokey malt. The taste of this beer is strongly malty with hints of woodiness. The alcohol really shows itself in the bitter aftertaste. This beer is nice and thick in the mouth, but doesn't have much carbonation. It's very drinkable for such a high-alcohol beer, you may find yourself drunk pretty quickly if you aren't careful."
"D- A top notch beer. As per DFH tradition they take a style and make it something new and insane. I really enjoyed this beer. Very little to critique it on. With that in mind, it was a bit hot for me. This is a beer that needs to be aged. As fresh as it was, it was too hot for me to give it high drinkability marks. Did I enjoy it? Absoltely. If you want the pinnacle of browns, buy this, age it for a year or so, and then drink it. Hot fresh, but still top notch."
"M/D: Its creamy and heavier than expected, more like a stout or porter than a brown ale. For a beer that is 12% it is extremely drinkable. A great beer from DFH."
"I had cellared one 12 oz bottle with a bottling date of 2/19/09. I cracked it open today, and I swear, it only go tbetter! Smoother, not as boozy, with plenty of caramel, vanilla and bready flavors. Hard to call this a brown ale, especially with as well as it has aged. I'd bet it would have lasted another three years just as well!"
"This stuff makes Guinness look like water. So thick! So rich! So much alcohol! It has a very powerful malt flavor up front that fades into a taste similar to that of a red wine. This isn't a barley wine, but it does resemble one. This is an all around excellent beer! It is hard to drink to many of these, but with such a high alcohol content, that's not an issue. This beer might be the definition of what malt tastes like."
"I've had quite a few different DFH brews over the years but for some reason always passed by this one. I finally picked up a 4 pack today from Bevmo. I poured a 12 oz. bottle into my Bruery tulip glass. It poured a deep black/brown color with a small thick brown head. Good lacing. One wiff of this and I knew I would love it. Smells very malty/sweet with coffee and a slight alcoholic presence. Tastes delicious - sweet, super malty, a bit of vanilla and lots of coffee and chocolate. A nice smokiness to it with a good amount of hops that balance it out a bit. Not as thick as it first seems, but still has very little carbonation for a brown ale. Alcohol is well hidden. It's a great beer, I can't believe I passed by this so many times. I'm sure it had something to do with the $14 4-pack price. All in all, I loved this beer and would pay too much for it again."
"Really dark brown to black pour with pretty caramel head of tiny bubbles. Great lacing. Surprisingly sweet smell, but a solid roasted backbone. Sweet and creamy in the mouth. Huge and bold, not unlike alot of Dogfish offerings. Alot of smoke in the finish, which was interesting and set this beer apart kind of. Huge malt and sugars. Very good."
"Taste: Has that woody/nutty taste and that balance between bitterness and malty character which seems to characterize many of many Dogfish Head's brews. This one's a bit reminiscent (I think) of Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. Overall, very drinkable. I'd welcome a repeat in the near-future."
"High in alcohol. It is not well hidden, it is there and this is not a session beer. But, full of flavors. Rich and heavy. A great, slow sipping drink."
"A bit raisiny, a boozified raisin. And at 12 abv, you notice this quickly. It becomes quite difficult to drink warm, which perhaps is not the point, but I barely taste all the things I'm supposed to. Just malty alcohol making me wish I had two 6%ers instead."
"Despite the strength of the flavors (and alcohol), the viscosity of the body and balance of all involved make the mouth-feel suburb and the beer itself a phenomenal drink. Great as a dessert beer or served with roasted or dried meats."
"I found myself drinking this one slowly, not because of the high ABV, but because i simply did not want the beer to end!!"
"Malts range from chocolate to dark bready grains to burnt caramel. Lingering licorice flavors and the wood is very unique and noticeable. Some raisin fruitiness comes out as it warms. I like the 08 better in the taste...it has a mellower wood influence and the alcohol is very smooth. Incredible drinkability for a 12%'er. I can see this one getting even better with a couple more years on it. Oxidation is quite low for a 2-year old beer, nice. I'll buy it again, even with the steep price tag - that is for damn sure."
"D: this is a large sipper, i could see this catching up to me if i had a couple."
"How can they get this so right and fail so epically on the Theobroma? Sort of like Ford coming out with the GT500 but also producing the Xr4ti. Different design/marketing teams? If this is their winner then they are allowed to fail (once) on something else."
"My wife was given a sample of this at Barley's. She liked it but it was a bit much for her. So I finished the sample. I had to order one up as soon as I finished my Racer X. I then went a bought a 6 of it to have one every now and then. Very good change up for a complex, big 12% beer. Flavor is big and bold. Very drinkable for 12% brown (black) ale."
"First taste is thick, like drinking a beer smoothie, rich and alcoholic mouthcoating. with hints of plums. Develops as it warms in the glass to have an almost sherry quality. Finishes with lingering sweetness. High in alcohol, so not good to quaff multiples."
"D: A big beer with lots of booze in the flavor, a very good beer with some serious bite, at 12% be careful because it is delicious but could be deadly (in a good way though)."
"All and all, another solid beer from Dogfish Head. Always impressed with what they continue to churn out down there in Milton."
"Also, I consider this more of an American Strong Ale than an American Brown Ale. Rating this one against other ASAs."
"This beer just coats my mouth in sticky thick beer. The flavor lasts and lasts in my mouth. Carbonation is on the low side which works well for this beer. For a beer this size it's still only average drinkability. I had some trouble finishing the whole bottle because of the sweetness."
"Bottle. Bottled on 6/21/10. Pours a DARK brown alomost black color into my tulip glass. This has got to be the darkest brown ale I have ever seen. Very slight dark tan head. Big roast notes coming from this one. Big whiffs do burn the nostrils a bit with the booze. Much smoother in the taste than I would have thought after the aroma. Notes of coffee and dark chocolate come to mind. Alomost an iron taste to it as well, not sure where that is coming from. Woody and earthy too. The alocohol is surpisingly not that noticeable in the taste. This could be an IRS judging by the looks, so dark with a slight head. The wood flavor becomes more apparent as this warms a bit and tastes like a mix of oak and very subdued cedar. Very much a sipper type of beer. Medium/Heavy mouthfeel."
"I had this one on my ""To-Drink"" list for awhile, and I am glad to have tried it at last! Definitely one to sip by a fire on a cold winter's night. Will drink again!"
"The taste of red wine, of the communion wine, is only made more illuminating because it is a beer you hold in those plungered hands. And though you have a long way to go, and many mounted men chasing you, worry not for this fine liquid will last long into your journey, and leave you with the desire to continue your quest."
"Well it's big and boozy, what else needs to be said? Drinkability is about as high as a 12% brown ale can get."
"This was a fantastic brown ale, great complex flavor, not necessarily easy to drink more that one or two, but it is greatly enjoyable."
"D: A great beer to share with someone, although, since it does go down quite easy, considering it is 12%, you could enjoy one all to yourself, as well."
"D: I bought a 4 pack for $12. This will be my last. Not bad, but not good."
"This is one of the most outstanding beers I have ever had."
"The feel is really enjoyable and is pretty smooth. It slides down the pallet and has a nice drinkable feel."
"Won't buy this again but have been wanting to try it for a while so... not disappointed."
"It's too strong to be very drinkable, but it's a very intense, complex, and eminently enjoyable drink."
"Notes: It's big and complex with a bit of bite, which should mellow nicely with age. This is a big winner in my book."
"Overall this is a great beer. Very complex and becomes very aromatic as the beer warms up with the wood really coming to the forefront."
"Drinkability-Not sure how to rate it on this scale, it's not really a beer to knock back and pound, it's intended to be savored and drank slowly. For what they were going for, I think the drinkability is pretty solid."
"D - Very Drinkable. Strong so be careful you can overdo very quickly if you don't watch out. Nice to have to just sip and enjoy the moment. Definitely not a session beer, but easily a special moment beer."
"D - A very good and unique beer. Easy to drink for 12% ABV."
"D - A great sipping Imperial Brown. It is smooth but at the same time the alcohol is not hidden. A great first beer of the night or a great one for a single beer evening. I would definitely drink again."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable for a syrupy brown ale with a thick, rich flavor. I am currently on 3, and could go for the fourth, if not for work tomorrow. Very strong at 12%, so 2-3 would set you off fine, aka, handcuff yourself to the couch if you drink more than 3!!!!"
"Considering the 12% ABV this beer goes down with resolve. At $18 a 4-pack it is on the expensive side but well worth it if you're looking for a dark, complex brown ale."
"Overall, I found this to be a satisfying beer. I will definitely buy it again, but in limited quantities as I wouldn't drink more than 1 at a time."
"I loved this beer the first couple of times I had it, but this time, its just ok. I will revisit again in a year or so, I'm sure."
"This is very drinkable for its ABV, but the sugary feel will keep me from having more than 1."
"D - I could only handle one of these per sitting. High abv. I thought was apparent making this a sipper for sure. But an interesting beer none the less, always worth a try."
"This brew is absolutely fantastic, has all the big flavors and taste with mouthfeel you could want. The only reason it would be hard to session would be because the high alcohol. World class."
"I recently had this at DFH Restaurant in Rehoboth Beach, DE and I believe it is a bit better on tap, but to be honest - this is one heck of a brown ale. You can definitely feel the abv here, but there is just so much going on in terms of flavor that if you have not tried this, it is well worth a try. As a souvenir, I bought a 4 pack of this at the restaraunt. Sadly, there are only 3 left at this point and I do not see these too often."
"D- If it wasn't 12% the 4pk wouldn't last me the night. This really is a remarkable beer. I was sad when my glass was empty."
"Definitely a sipper, chugging this thing would be quite dangerous haha. But the type of tastes that are backgrounded in this one make it drinkable enough to say hey, I could possibly chug it."
"If I did not know better I could pass this as an Imperial Stout from the way it taste. For a brown ale this is really good and something I would like to try again."
"Notes: I bought this bottle 2 months before I drank it. I was saving it to try on Father's Day. Not only am I a father-to-be so it is my first of many Father's Days to come, but also my father is a wood artist, who makes pens and other fine pieces; so I wanted to split a bottle with him. A great beer for a great day!"
"D - I would imagine it's better than this would be fresh, but I think it could still go quite a ways with a bit more time. Still, the beer feels like it has actual direction, something that a lot of DFH beers seem to be lacking. The wood adds to the drinkability as well since it cuts back some of the sweetness."
"jd"
"Update: This was the first beer I reviewed on BA. This beer still ranks as one of my top-5 beers I have ever had even after having a lot of different styles and varieties through the years."
"The carbonation is much more apparent than I expected given how it poured. This is nice, since it lifts the otherwise heavy mouthfeel. I wouldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting, but I am thoroughly enjoying this one. I think it would do well with some age on it."
"D: This beer definitely needs to be sipped because it has an intense flavor and the alcohol will quickly catch up to you (the alcohol is noticeable but fairly well masked from the taste)."
"I'm sorry, but I could NOT drink this beer. I had been looking forward to it so much, too. All I could taste was wood and alcohol, which overpowered the finer flavors. An assault on the tongue. It's just not my type of thing. I don't think the higher ABV helped this beer."
"Pairing Score; B+ The bowl of goodies was much better than the beer and it helped refocus my palate."
"An unbelievably complex yet drinkable brown ale, Palo Santo Marron takes the standard brown ale in a completely new and different direction. It makes a fantastic desert beer or night cap."
"This is very drinkable, and has become one of my favorite go-to beers. I also love that this is offered year-round."
"taste confirms the delicious: smoky and woody notes swirl around sweet roasted malt, hints of coffee, chocolate, molasses, and vanilla; and at 12% abv, there's definitely a kick of warming alcohol. this a big, unique, and very tasty brew, full of flavor and complexity. smooth, medium-full bodied mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. drinkability is good for a beer this potent, you have to remind yourself to sip. really enjoying this one."
"D. Different than any other beer I've ever had, I will definitely have another. Not a daily drinker for me, but a good one still."
"D - Wow, 12%? Never would have guessed, because it is hidden so well. So smooth and creamy going down, perfectly balanced, complex tastes make this a stellar brew."
"D: It's good, but I wouldn't drink more than one of these. You may also consider sharing a single bottle with someone else."
"D= amazingly this went with everything that I was eating, mostly a mixed seafood plate with homemade potato chips. Would be spectacular with a dark chocolate dessert but unfortunately I would fear that this beer would diminish the enjoyment of the dessert!"
"Notes: Not sure I'd classify this one as a brown ale, as it really seems to head more into the stout territory for me, but this is one tasty beer and I don't really care what category it's in. This would be a great sipper on a cool evening."
"Not a session beer, one of these and I was good to go. Nice beer though."
"D- Enjoyable and easy to drink, alcohol could be hind better. If you like beer aged in wood barrels this is a must have."
"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet. Bottled on date of 12/28/09. Palo Santo Maroon appears a very dark brown color with some redness around the edges when held up to the light. The head appears less than a finger strong with a creamy dark brown color that retains quite well for such a high abv. Lacing appears and sticks in spots about the glass. Nose has a strong dark sugary aroma much like a mix of molasses and brown sugar. Some nutty date-like scents come into play as well along with some noticeable alcohol. As the beer warms, the nose indicates some previously hidden scents of caramel and vanilla. The taste of this brew has some bold malt character coming across much like the aroma indicated but not as sweet as the nose suggested. Flavors full of dark sugary notes riddled with alcohol and a contrasting bitterness of dark grain slightly chocolatey. The finish of this brew leaves a lingering taste of woodsy flavors much unlike the usual contribution of oak. It is peculiar with a flavor I never experienced before but very much enjoyable. For such as high abv brew this is a chewy full bodied brew but very smooth in the feel and quite drinkable considering. At times the alcohol comes across a bit astringent but understandable so. Wow I bet some age would make this taste even more wonderful."
"Every time I have this beer I marvel anew at how damn tasty it is. As thick and chewy as it is, it's about as drinkable as they come; I have to restrain myself from guzzling it. A truly exceptional brew - far out of style - from a brewer justly celebrated for breaking style guidelines."
"D- great relaxation beer. Even at 12% its extremely drinkable. Definitely recommend it if you can find it."
"I was really looking forward to this, and I'm a bit disappointed. It's not a bad beer, but it's nothing I feel compelled to have again soon. Maybe in a couple of years."
"D: Huge beer meant to be shared with others!"
"D- Really rich, this is like a dessert beer for me. I don't know that I could have more than one or two of these in a sitting. This would go well with any kind of chocolate dessert or even cheesecake. I recommend trying this beer when you get a chance. Keep up the good work dogfish."
"flavor is excellent but the hints of alcohol detract from drinkability."
"I hear so much about this beer but rarely try it. Apparently I had a growler of this recently, but don't really remember. I agree with my original review that it's by no means an american brown. However, you could say it's an american brown on steroids. Very intense in the flavors you want from a brown. Good dark malt without being too roasty. Amazing aroma that is, again, not too dark but very malty. Overall, this is a great late evening beer or winter warmer."
"D- I like this a lot but all in all its a palate crusher and 12 abv is no joke. Either way I think I'm having another."
"Have been on a DFH kick latley, and this beer is another great example of their take on this style."
"!!!young, inexpensive, high alcohol by volume beers could almost alway use a bit of aging. This beer was very fresh. I hope they let me do a second review after aging the beer for a year or two."
"The overall effect is something very much akin to a fine sherry, and it should be consumed in a similar fashion -- slowly, deliberately, and luxuriously."
"Pours the darkest brown with a half finger dark tan head that dissipates quickly. The smell is very unique and mostly of the palo santo wood and booze. The taste is wonderful, like drinking a log. There is a sweetness to the wood that is quite pleasant. There is a boozy finish even after a year of aging, but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel suffers a bit from the flavor intensity, and after about 8oz I'm done. Best DFH beer I've had."
"Pours a thick oil-black with a medium head. Olfactories pick up hints of fruity esters and a sweet vanilla punch. The taste is consistent with this before a brisk burn of alcohol takes over. Fans of bourbon barrel stouts will be interested in this uncharacteristic brown ale, aged in Paraguayan Palo Santo wood vessels. Certainly a unique and delicious brew."
"Taste: Sweet with a taste very similar to the smell. Because of how dark this is I expected a toasted taste but there is nothing like that in this beer. Good and still surprising it has as much alcohol as it does."
"I first tried this beer in fall 2008, and loved it. Picked up a 4-pack last summer, and then never got around to trying one until today. Though I quite liked my first taste, I was in no hurry, as I knew this beer would hold up well. It could still stand to lose a bit more alcohol heat, but regardless, this is a top notch drink. I have been underwhelmed by many offerings from DFH, but this is possibly their best."
"This unique ale pours very dark brown--nearly black with a moderate tan head. The aroma is rather complex--moderate-high bittersweet, caramel malt with hints of earthy peat and a bit oaky. The flavor is intensely malt--bittersweet, caramel with a smooth acid earthy undertones and a bit of vanilla. The hop bitterness is moderate and provides balance. The body is exceptionally smooth and very high ABV is hidden in just subtle warmth in the throat and belly. The body is full and carbonation moderate. Overall a very flavorful, complex brew--exceptionally smooth. Interesting wood--I could never pick it out of something different than say oak, but certainly makes a tasty beer."
"Bottle (Bottled on 5/27/09) Thick and vinous and hardly carbonated. The mouthfeel is somewhere between a nice cabernet and a good single malt. Chocolate malt and a volitle alcohol warmth dominate the aroma and it leaves an interesting tabacco flavor on the back of the throat as the warmth from the alcohol subsides. Its not the first beer I'd reach for or would i call it a social beer but I commend the effort."
"The malt and wood are on the nose even. DFH has this effect with a lot of their beers. Like the 120 min. Could smell that on the other side of the room by just opening the cap. The lack of hops is accentuated by the smell of cherries and ...what's that...oh wood! Surprise! There is a thin tan head atop this Adonis of a ..brown ale? Chocolate wood and fruit on the mouth and a lingering sense of wanting more. The 12% alc. isn't even noticed. Another sly beer from the kings of high alc%. Must buy if ya got $17."
"Drinkability: I could drink this beer a lot, but not in small quantities due to the high abv. Trully an artisan ale."
"Super dark ruby-brown in color. Tan head. Roasty, woody aroma (cedar-like, which I presume to be the Palo Santo wood profile) along with dark chocolate & vanilla. Without knowing the style beforehand, the aroma might lead me to believe I had an imperial stout in my hand. Flavor is huge dark chocolate with a smoky, barrel-aged likeness. Vanilla as well. Full bodied with a smooth booziness. Drinkability low, but this is a seriously tasty beer. Curious how it would taste with a bit of age on it."
"Poured to a one inch head. Head was dark brown or chocolate in color. Beer itself was black in color. There was no light getting through this brew. Head hung around for a little while. A little lacing but not much. You could smell chocolate as soon as the bottle was opened. Also could smell the alcohol. Almost smelled like whiskey. Tasted of heavy chocolate, alcohol, whiskey, caramel, slight vanilla flavor, malt. Also had that alcohol burn. Felt thick in the mouth. Carbonation was about right. To heavy for me. Also to boozy. I dont think you could enjoy a few. I had a nice buzz after one."
"This is a very fun beer to drink. Sweet yet dry, a lot of flavor and an interesting mouthfeel make this a great sipping beer although it's balanced enough you don't have to sip. Wood flavors are nicely subdued so you don't feel like your sucking on beer flavored wood chips.I really felt like another one immediately but at 12% I don't know if that's a good idea... yes I do."
"Pours black with mahogany head. Carbonation is a little uneven. The smell is actually not too great, there's a metallic quality to the smell. The taste is rather nice, however. The beer has a chocolatey edge to it and something else I can't quite pin down, perhaps something to do with the Palo Santo Marron wood that they mention. Mouthfeel is sticky, and the beer is pretty smooth and drinkable."
"Served from tap into standard pint. Poured a dark dark brown (almost black) with a one-finger off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout. The aroma contained a nutty hint with malt notes as well. The flavor of this one was malty, nutty, and sweet. This brew was medium on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a nice stout with a nice welcomed sweet flavoring. Very nice stout and was not aware of the ABV until checking here on the site."
"Another experiment from Dogfish that's ended well. Glad I tried this, though I prefer their regular brown ale."
"Bottle pours a very dark black, almost stout like. The taste is heavy on the wood and dark chocolate. A little vanilla and dark fruits lingers in there as well. Overall, the 12% is well hidden and it goes down quite smooth. Kinda wishing I picked up a second bottle of this."
"M/D - Despite being a big beer it's easy to drink. A sipper for sure because of the ABV and because you have to savor the flavor but you could easily drink a few if you wanted to get into trouble. My only issue is I'm not getting he wood thing that hard, which is fine, it's done tastefully but if you gave this to me blind I wouldn't know. For the price I feel it's a bit hype despite the backstory to it being awesome. Always respect DFH."
"Drinkability is low. Taste wise this is easy to drink, but at 12% ABV... one is enough."
"D: Finding this one highly drinkable, thought the alcohol presence would make it hot, but it is definitely hidden well. Well crafted, yet dangerously drinkable beer."
"This is an extremely good ale"
"Good job boy and girls of DFH!"
"Update: consumed a 06/2008 bottle in 07/2011. Three years in the bottle really smoothed out the flavors and further concealed the alcohol. Just a slight hint of cardboard oxidation but nothing severe."
"Really remarkable."
"This could very easily be called a stout, or at least a porter, and no one would blink. There's enough nuttiness and hops to give away its brown ale roots, but the aging on the magical South American wood transforms this into something very very special. Worth seeking out if you're into big dark brews at all."
"A dark muddy brown color pour with a small soapy tan head , short lasting , leaving loads of lacing all the way down the glass , lively carbonation . Aroma is malty and sweet , caramel , wood ,toasted nuts , brown sugar , spicy hops and a hint of alcohol . Flavor is big and malty , lots of caramel,toffee and earthy roasty nutts , just enough of the wood coming through , light smoke , vanilla and alcohol notes with a nice warming effect . Full body with a creamy smooth mouthfeel , slightly boozy finish . An all around great brew very drinkable and enjoyable , nice work DFH ."
"Hell of a beer. Four Stars. ""****"""
"This is to brown ales as Lou Ferigno is to actors; you kind of like him but don't actually think of him as a real actor, more of a bodybuilder."
"enjoyed this beer and very interesting take on a brown ale. the flavor profile is unique... plus I really enjoy the boozy taste."
"Notes: Bottled on 05/27/09. Definitely an interesting beer that has a strong wood presence. Really this beer was a bit of an enigma for me whether it was trying to determine the aroma or trying to determine if I like it or not. At times I was really enjoying it, and at times I wasn't so sure. It's a beer that I'd really have to be in the mood for to have again. The wood/peat and alcohol were a little strong for me, but at times they worked. Those being so prominent reminded me of a whisky at times. Definitely worth a try to see how you feel about it."
"D: One 12oz bottle is perfect to be split between two people unless you don't mind sipping on this for a very long time. Very powerful beer and meant to be sipped."
"dinkablility is good."
"D-I think the hotness of the alcohol really could've been hidden better. If it was, then I think it could've gotten an A+."
"pours a solid black color with spare tan head and spare lacing. Chocolate wood flavor which was also apparent in the smell. heavy syrup like feel with caramel and vanilla hints. very sweet and just a very tiny bit bitter. full body with a creamy oily texture. alcohol was well hidden. to me this beer was completely average, i was not the least bit impressed, and had been left feeling slightly used and abused."
"Price = $3.49 at Joe Canal's"
"D: This is an amazing beer. It could go well with spicy appetizers, or with rich desserts. Sip and savor."
"When I bought this, I told the guy at the shop I'd never had it before and was looking forward to trying it. He told me ""it's like chewing on cedar chips"" . I've never chewed cedar chips, but now I may have to try that too."
"A full body, a viscous mouth feel with medium carbonation."
"Bottled on date of 12/28/09, pours awful black for a brown ale. Truly epic in appearance. Red tinged around the edges, though it is a struggle to see any hues other than pitch blackness. Virtually no head to speak of, though there are a bit of tiny brown bubbles that cling to the edges of the glass. Minute lacing present also. Smell is big wood and the major alcohol punches you in the nose. Surely smells like a big ass beer. Also tastes heavily of the wood. The alcohol warmth of this is crazy. Almost has a bourbon characteristic to it. A very unique tasting brew, unlike anything I've ever encountered. Feel is light and smooth for such a monster beverage, burning sensation on the way down, though it is a good burn. I have to rate the drinkability of this a bit low, due to the heavy booze content. One of these is fine for me, may have to move on to something not so ""epic"". Great candidate for aging, as this is what I'll do with the rest of the pack."
"Drinkability: this is rather tasty, but due to strength in both flavor and alcohol I don't think I'd want to session this. Call it good."
"D - With the 12% ABV and the very complex flavor it's not the kind you'd throw back socially. It really kind of calls for your full attention. I bought a 4 pack bottle stamped 14 months ago, and will go back and buy another to stash for a while. I suspect it will only get better with age."
"D- well pretty drinkable for the 12% ABV, just a bit sticky sweet and that spice thing kinda slowed it down a bit for me, otherwise a damn drinkable beer"
"Drinkability is pretty bad, this beer is so hot all you taste is the burn of alcohol. I appreciate what they were trying to do here, but this reminds me more of liquor than beer."
"D: Damned interesting and satisfying beer... quite easy to drink... at 12%! Take your time and sip on one... but leave it at one."
"Pours jet black and oily, creating a beautiful thick tan head (somewhat short-lived, however). 12% ABV noticeable up front. Malty aroma, very estery. Licorice, chocolate, and (very subtle) raspberry flavors appear in the middle. Finish begins sweet with mild bitterness when that subsides. Like eating bittersweet chocolate. Big and thick mouthfeel. Think brown bread"
"joyous occasion. I absolutely love this beer."
"Drinkability: Very delicious, but this one is meant to savor. Break out a spicy snifter and melt your cares away!"
"drinkability - this is a huge beer, wouldn't have more than one in a sitting, very enjoyable but fatigues the mouth with time"
"The beer is served in the proper glassware with a dark brown color with a small caramel colored head that settles on top. The hearty malty aroma is striking at the front, that blends to sugary fragrance and ending with a soft woodsy scent. The malt gives off a sugary taste, with a caramel sweetness; a touch of brown sugar is in there as well. A woodsy and earth flavor takes over halfway and finishing with a mild citric and earthy bitterness. A thin syrup feel is at the start then it thickens up and finishing an oily slickness towards the back. Wow, a unique take on a brown ale; the sugary and hearty malt flavors and aromas are almost like candy. The dark color is inviting, along with the sticky and slick feel make this a beer to savor. This would be great with a tart dessert or maybe for the last beer for the night."
"Drinkability: Palate fatigue may be an issue here, as well as that alcohol presence wears on you over time. This brew will take a hit now, but with a bit of age under its belt it could be deadly."
"Pours black, with a nice mocha colored head, which dissipates rather quickly, leaving a slick oily surface dotted with bubbles. Smells boozy and woody, with some bourbon, rum, vanilla and alcohol. The alcohol is very present up front, along with swirling hints of coffee, molasses, dark fruit and bourbon. Nicely balance, slightly oily and dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is there, but well integrated into the flavor profile. Highly recommended"
"[Drinkability]: It's a sit back and relax beer, perfect for a cold winter's night."
" The aromas coming off of Palo Santo are so complex I want to call Yankee Candles and tell them this is the next big thing. Oak, vanilla, coffee, sweet caramel and topped of with a shot of brandy.The taste fall almost directly in line with the bouquet, fruity yeast characters are evident in the first sip. Raisins, roasted coffee, caramel and vanilla. The alcohol comes across smooth not boozy for the 12% ABV. I am impressed to say the least. There appears to be some sort of ashy finish I find to be quite pleasant. The body comes across a tad on the heavy side. Carbonation is on mild side. I could have another tonight if I was not hoarding them."
"This is not the most drinkalbe beer with huge over powering flavor and 12% ABV it stands out as a sipper but a very good sipper."
"D-wow its very good; high alcohol and price doesn't allow it to be an every day type beer, but its quite good. its a one per day beer. I would love to try this beer with a bit more age time on it. I generally don't prefer brown ales, but this is very unique and delicious."
"D: This is a one and done sipping beer. It's complex enough to match a cabernet and would be great paired up with a big steak or roast."
"Still, a wonder."
"D: With the high a.b.v. and tannin feel on the palate, this one is just a bit of a challenge to drink. I really enjoyed the beer, but I think it's more of a once in awhile sipper."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Thick, slight carbonation, and scarily smooth. Quite unlike any brown ale I've tried thus far. With the level of alcohol and the way the beer hides it, I am glad it's quite complex or I could drink these much faster than I probably should."
"This is without a doubt one of the most unique beers you can experience. At this point, a year into the bottle the flavor has so much depth, it will be a fight to keep these aging. It has the character of a imperial stout, but not as thick and sweet. Anything else you drink in the same evening will be mute and meaningless."
"D - definitely drinkable for something so high in alcohol. you have to be careful to sip and not gulp. Very smooth."
"D- Overall a great ""big brother"" of a traditional brown ale that packs quite a punch."
"D: definitely not a straight brown, while the beer hides the alcohol relatively well the high ABV comes through a bit, generally a very enjoyable beer with exceptional MF"
"Looking forward to the other bottle once is gets dusty."
"Pour was deep brown bordering on black. Mouthfeel was creamy and stout-like. Huge sweet malt with brown sugar, caramel and vanilla. Prominent alcohol flavor, but not nearly so hot as one might expect. Finish was bittersweet. A style-bender for sure. I'm going to put a couple away and see how they do over time."
"Libation: Like many Dogfish brews, this is an extreme beer that could be considered an experiment. I can't actually say what exactly Paraguayan wood does for this ""stoutish"" brown ale, but it works. For such a heavy beer with such a high ABV, I'm impressed at how smooth and subtle the flavors are. Palo Santo Marron is incredibly complex, but enjoy these slowly."
"Overall: The Palo Santo Marron is absolutely unique. It probably won't change your life, but if you like dark ales I think you should try it."
"This is definitely one of the more interesting beers I've ever tried. I was surprised by the look of it, thought perhaps my server got the order wrong. It was dark and thick, looked like a nice porter with a half-inch, dark brown foam head. The smell is of sandalwood, very nice and relaxing. The taste was not the best, again like sandalwood, which I prefer in a candle as opposed to a beer. It was also very syrupy too. Hard to finish."
"I will not be purchasing this again unless I have had a terrible day and need to get wasted. Actually, the more I think about it, I would rather drink liquor straight than drink this."
"A surprisingly strong, surprisingly drinkable brown ale."
"While super-smooth and flavorful, it also seems to have been tamed a bit too much. I think I prefer this beer fresh, when it's vinous, un-cigarette-like, and has more teeth."
"D: 12% is not noticeable in the least. With no alchol heat at all I could probably drink this all night but I'm pretty sure after about two or three I'd be done for. A very unique brew with some interesting flavors imparted by the palo santo. A one of a kind for sure."
"D: Big in flavor and well-balanced. 12% hardly noticeable."
"Overall, this is a really nice and unique beer. I can't recommend buying an entire 4 pack without trying it first, but if you find this in your store's single selection, grab one and see what you think."
"D: Most likely one a night. There's Shakespeare's rub about a beer like this: wonderful in so many different ways, yet something about it is holding you back. Don't get me wrong, it's a damn tasty beer. Could I plough through an entire sixer? No. But I could easily savor one to three of these given the proper situation. Deep-dark-smokish-rich-heavy... this is a beer for advocates to savor once a night over the course of an hour to really take in what makes this one crank your motor. One will be just dandy... three and you're asking for a wake-up next to someone who shaves their legs with less frequency than you do. Careful. All-in-all, the Palo Santo makes for a terrific pairing with certain courses... like the seared tarragon-basil-garlic lamb chops we just did over a fingerling potato and onion hash with a roasted veal bone/vanilla bean foyot reduction... yes... be jealous... you should. Guess I'll stop rambling now. Is anyone even reading all this?"
"D - have one during your night out, but the ABV could get very dangerous."
"I really love the appearance on this one: not black, dark brown, nutty looking with nice head and medium carbonation. The smell is of malt, vanilla, and a formidable ABV. Taste is nutty/vanilla/wood and more un-put-yer-finger-onable goodness. I really enjoyed this. The ABV is sharp on this though making the drinkability a task. This is a great brew and I would love to have another, and another, but not one after another. Dogfish head always nails it."
"D - Smooth, smooth, and smooth. The good balance and delicious flavor make a persuasive case for a second, and a third. But the high ABV and richness are most conducive for a slow, leisurely pace."
"this beer is great. What a very different brew that I wish I had sooner. A beer u want after a good fall or winter hike, this one is rich and complex with a roasted malt character followed by a lingering hop presence. At 12 percent it packs a punch The finish is of like a cedar wood. Quite different and unique. Try something very different and pick this one up today."
"Nicely drinkable for a huge brown ale, enjoyable especially with its unique properties."
"D- 12% ABV plays no factor in this. It is a bit boozy, but the flavors and aromas coming off this are phenomenal, I love this beer. Each sip makes me want more. Thanks again Dan, much appreciated!!!"
"Well after the pour I didn't think this was going to be very good, but after the smell I had hope. Smell was different, sorta spicey but sweet notes. The initial taste was like a deep dark brown ale, but it finishes with a peppery bite that comes out of nowhere. Man this is awesome, I love the bite at the end of this. Good beer."
"Pours a rich black with a light head atop it. The nose on this beer is sensational, with licorice and molasses dominating. The flavour though is utterly sensational. Molasses, licorice, roasted malt, a slight nut & coffee flavour are all evident in a beer that doesn't taste half of its actually ABV. The beer had low carbonation which contributed to a chewy mouthfeel. This is a beer I felt I could sip at forever, and never get bored of it. One of the best beers I have ever tried."
"Palo Santo is usually the first beer I look for when I head to the Dogfish Head Alehouse. So for all of those who love a rich, strong beer, this is the one for you."
"The complexity was excellent, and it was all bottled in a potent but smooth and easy to drink package. DFH masked a 12% alcohol beer as good, if not better, than anything I've tried before."
"Being fairly finely carbonated, this one has a silky texture and goes down much smoother than would be expected at 12% alcohol. I enjoy this one more and more each time I try it. Simply delightful."
"D: Another ""creeper"" by DFH. They have the knack for making beers with a high alc. content that you can drink more than one or two at a sitting. I'll be looking to have some of these for the next time friends are over."
"The bottle has a nice burgundy color and bears the Dogfish Head logo on top of a tree stump in the front. I enjoyed it, its cute. Has a very nice vanilla smokey smell to it. I think it taste best if you take a sniff then drink. The beer itself also has a nice smokey vanilla taste to it. There is caramel undertones in there but the vanilla and wood flavors really shine in this beer.This is a very bitter beer, then finishes very smooth, I however, could not drink more then a couple due to the richness of the beer. I also think that this beer taste best after warming up a tad."
"It may be some time before I pick it up again"
"All in all, this, to me, is like a ""poor man's"" Dark Lord. DL has a heavy raisin flavor which is hidden in this brew. 2 different styles, but similar flavors mixed in. Awesome brew. If you like Dark Lord and big beers like that, then this is for you. If you want a refreshing brew, this one might not be a good choice."
"D: 12% ha no way, this one goes down great and could easily drink 2, but laid the other 3 down to enjoy at some point down the road this one is an excellently crafted beer that will age well. so worth the 14 dollars. This one caught me off guard at to how good it was; i thought no Imperial brown ale would be this good."
"D: ""It is what it is."" Not planning on ever having more than one at a sitting... but will have several more in the future. Like it."
"Fantastic brew, and probably my favorite from DFH. I'll be throwing some more bottles in the cellar, that's for sure."
"Palo Santo Marron is a wonderful and complex after-dinner sipper. It's heavy, boozy, and sweet without being overbearing. A great experience."
"Dangerously drinkable, very smooth & tasty. The alcohol is not hidden, but still doesn't taste or feel like 12%. I don't know if this will make sense to anyone but me, but this is like the biggest little beer I've ever had (or maybe vice versa) -- full flavor, but leaving me wanting me more, doesn't feel full, but packs a punch with booze."
"Overall another great brew from the guys at DFH. I can drink 2 in one session without problems more than that I think the high abv would catch up to me."
"p.s. as i stated in my review for the draft version, the brewery's 'sample-meister' gave me a sample of this mixed with the 90 minute IPA....again, i recommend trying this....it somewhat wakes things up by mellowing the ABV factor, but hopping it up a bit. TOO RECOMMENDED..."
"D: Intriguing brew definitely worth the experience but not really an easy drinker. And definitely not for everyone. Since I drank my bottle within a month and a half of it's bottling, I will have to buy another to age."
"I go back and forth on this beer a lot. I think it's a quality beer and a unique twist on the style. At times the wood can be a bit much, but other times it's a very enjoyable sipper."
"D: A very sessionable beer, would recommend a 4-pack for a buzz one night."
"D: A very interesting beer to say the least. I really don't know what style this fits in to. Supposedly a brown ale but way too complex for the style. Glad I got to try it but nothing I would search for."
"Uncompromising, unyielding, unbelievable. Dogfish Head just keeps doing it. Dark, sweet, nutty, toffee, coffee, lingering. If you're looking for a session beer, look somewhere else. This one's a monster. The body and punch of this one is on par with Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout. It's simply huge. But it doesn't sacrifice nuance or subtlety. Don't drink more than one without a safety word."
"Na Zdravje!"
"overall another interesting take from DFH, but i think one bottle per winter is my limit."
"holy shit. so f*ing good. perfectly balanced, more rewarding with every sip. Transcendent. need i go on?"
"Happened to stumble on this beauty! Norrmal looking Dogfish head bottle, pop open and the magic starts. The appearance on the pour is a rich color that starts the mouth to water knowing something special is about to happen, Sam and the crew at Dogfish dont usually let us down. The smell is almost Brandy like, sweet and beckoning. Taste is warm and oakey with a mild hop.Tiny bubbles wash over the mouth and make this a very special drink. At 12 % you dont and should not drink many I enjoyed this very much with a med rare ribeye off the grill. Seek this out and enjoy."
"I found this beer to be amazingly rich, and flavorful. Great fruit character, along with intense smokey malt that complement each other. This is a winner."
"The dawn is dark, deeply brown nearing a light black (...if such a hue is possible...), almost too dark for the circumstances, but lovely nonetheless. Spirits are high. A communique intercepted from the aroma warns of maltiness with an oaken support network. But the message was improperly decoded: the palo santo brigade leads the invasion, with reinforcements coming from squads of malts. The assault complete, the beachhead encampment is not very heavy, and the mood is rather laid back, especially considering the alcohol."
"D-the flavors are pretty big but the alcohol shows through a little more than i would have liked. it takes away from the flavors, didn't like the addition of the smokiness at the finish and the wood brought a taste i wasn't too into. overall it wasn't bad; it was nice and thick, but the flavors didn't blow me away."
"The guayacol (oil of guaiac) in this tropical wood is an incense and perfume ingredient, and when oxidized it imparts a different characteristic on a beer, where as the White Oak brings an ale its creamy vanillin and oak lactones, and when the oak is toasted, rich coconut flavors."
"D - Delicious and satisfying. This is highly drinkable in moderation. I don't actually want to stop drinking it. Given its price and availability, this is a drink for special occasions. I highly recommend it if you get the chance."
"D - must be sipped, made the mistake of taking a generous gulp and almost spit it back out. Not my style, but interesting. Don't know how you can call it beer."
"quite thick, syrup, medium carbonation, chewy."
"-I'm not huge on dark, thick, syrupy beers, but this one drinks fairly easily. Though, I can bet it's much better with a meal, not alone."
"This beer is fairly sweet and quite alcoholic, making for a substantial body. In my opinion the sweet, woody and smoky flavors overpowered this beer. I would like to see this mellow and balance out a bit as it ages in the cellar."
"D - Rich and full-bodied, this ""brown ale", if you can even call it that, comes across as a stout. A great sipper!"
"Overall: very nice, the 12% can catch up to you quick. Very good beer, drink it slow and let it warm a bit it gets even better."
"Mouthfeel is on the syrupy side of medium-bodied. Alcohol is well hidden but comes up a few seconds as a warming sensation in the throat. Definately a good brew that confused me. i was expecting a sweet brown with maybe some wood notes. Another innovative Dogfish Head brew that keep me coming back."
"Overall, this beer is great. Tons of flavor. This is a new favorite of mine. I will definitely be getting more to cellar. Pretty drinkable and a fine taste to it. I highly recommend."
"You really have to like syrup and wood to get into this."
"For me The Dogfish Indian Brown Ale is a much better beer and a better value as well, but I'm a cheap prick so don't listen to me find out for yourself."
"Having been to Paraguay a couple times, I just had to seek this one out. Poured out as black as night with a moderate head. Aroma was sweet, like caramel. Taste was wonderful- thick, malty, full bodied & with moderate sweetness. The alcohol was fully integrated. This beer can get you into trouble. Really should be sipped, but goes down so easy. a wonderful find."
"This is a very nice brown ale. Was bottled in July so had half a year or so to age which is good for this brew. Pours a dark brown w/ great head and lacing. Has a woody scent due to the barrels it's aged in. Lots of molasses and a touch of roasty expresso. Dash of chocolate is present. It has a nutty flavor w/ some vanilla tones. Very creamy! The alcohol is present so this is definitely a sipper. Great beer from DFH."
"Side Notes: It's aged in wood, but I don't have wood after drinking this. Its good, but not an amazing beer that others make it out to seem."
"Pours a very dark opaque brown, almost like a stout. Light carbonation and no head, though I did start pouring on the side. One sniff and you can tell that there are some crazy notes added by the palo santo. I smell brown sugar, maybe some gingerbread, caramel and also some earthy notes. Also get a whiff of alcohol. Taste is very complex. Lots of brown sugar/molasses with wonderful earthy tones and some toffee caramel notes. Really can't perceive much bitterness. You get the warmth of the alcohol in the finish as well as a very pleasant, slightly roasty and woody aftertaste. I would say this beer is somewhere between medium and full bodied with a fairly smooth mouthfeel, and quite sticky sweet finish. Definitely one to savor. Not my usual cup of tea, but a well made and intriguing beer."
"Pretty drinkable, especially if you consider the strength, but it is still a big beer, and I don't think I'd want more than one at any given time."
"Interesting. Pretty good, but I'm not sure if it's worthy of the high price. However, it's intriguing enough that I think it would be great with a number of years on it, so I'll probably pick some more up to cellar."
"D- It came in a 4 pack and that would take a lot to handle"
"Man, this is only my second beer from Dogfish (because they just recently started distributing to SC and their beers are mostly by the coast), but they did it right again. The label's correct; I now have wood."
"D: still very much a sipper."
"Worth the $14 for a 4 pack, but not something that I intend to always have around."
"D: One hell of a brown ale, flavors pack a punch especially as this beer warms, would be a great one to lay down for a few years."
"12oz bottle, bottled on 2/17/09. Pours a very dark black with a tan head, it looks like a stout. Has a sweet aroma with vanilla, dark chocolate, spices, and earthy smells. The taste is quite complex with wood flavors, roasted malts, sweet chocolate, and molasses. This is very boozy, but the alcohol doesn't overpower the flavors. Medium-thick body. The alcohol does limit the drinkability a bit. This is a very interesting beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Viscous and sublime, the rich liquid is gently nudged with a rolling, easy carbonation that creates a velvety, almost silky texture. This beer is so huge, so packed with ingredients and flavor that it must be respected and enjoyed properly. I am basking in the joy of each sip, and cannot wait to sample this again with capicola and fennel... ahh, the joys of being a foodie and beer lover."
"Just would like to say that brown ales aren't one of my favorite types but Dogfish nailed this one. At 12% alcohol you can't go wrong. Alot of flavor (mostly that classic Dogfish malty bite with a lot of alcohol). Pretty common among craft beer stores so buy one next time your out, definitely worth it. Cheers!"
"Pours a jet black, with a dark brown head. Smell is strongly of alcohol and sweet malt. Taste is of cherries up front, smooth malt in the middle, and a woody, smoky, earthy finish. Amazingly smooth considering the ABV. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, low carbonation. Considering how strong it is, this beer is quite drinkable. You can barely taste any alcohol, and that is quite a feat for a beer over 12 percent ABV."
"This beer pours out a syrupy pitch black with a thin tan head. Smell is of sweet plums, raisin, and some smokey alcohol. Taste is of dark chocolate and caramel and finishes with a dark chocolate and coffee bitterness with some of the smokey, woody alcohol to boot. It's thick and creamy in the mouth with a slightly oily feel. Though this beer is super strong and heavy, it's a great sipper and worth a try."
"Expected a lot from the label and the price and it delivered. Pours a rich, very dark brown to black with a thin brownish / whitish foam. Aroma mainly chocolate with fainter vanilla, cherry, and wood. Great flavor with chocolate, roasted, caramel, toffee, slightly warm and boozy aftertaste. Smooth, creamy feel. Surprisingly drinkable given the ABV. PS -- the label made me laugh."
"Pretty drinkable for such a big beer. Great complex flavor profile and mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: This beer packs a strong punch and should not be taken lightly. One or two at dinner with a medium rare piece of red meat (beef, lamb, goat if you will) would be lovely"
"Hello to my beer advocate family! this is my 1st review and i gotta tell you from the gate...I am an enjoyer ...not a reviewer; but i will give it a wirl! picked up a 4 pack from beverage world today @16.99 DFH glass included...woohoo...love those free glasses! put it in my kegerator for several hours to reach optimum temp. before cracking open. anyway since i am a lover of most big beers vs normal beers;is there such a thing? this one did not disappoint. enjoying now with some goodies i picked up from arthur ave. in da bronx...bottled on 05/27/09; gotta love dfh for that info. the nose is full of fresh malt and rum. the creamy light chocolate looking head was a little on the small side probably due to the lower carbonation mouthfeel of this brew,but it did leave nice sticky lace on my new beer clean DFH glass. my taste buds picked up raisins,lots of malt and a hint of vanilla.the AC came in midway...well hidden for 12% in taste but not the buzz. overall another tasty treat from one of my favorite brewerys!"
"The mouthfeel is a bit creamy for the style but still good. Overall this is a very hefty brown, which makes it seem a bit stoutish. It's a drinkable beer but the high abv slows things down a bit."
"D - Except for the ABV, it is extremely drinkable. A taste sensation, for sure."
"Pours very dark for even for a brown ale, almost completely black. Produces a light tan head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. Smell is of strong malt and sweet caramel. Makes the mouth water just a little bit. Taste is smooth and somewhat sweet with it seems just a hint of smokiness. Mouthfeel is easy and a little bubbly. Alcohol is not very present in either scent or taste which is nice at 12% ABV. Very tasty brew and good for these cold winter nights in SD. Drinkability is good as far as taste but I'm not sure I could drink these all night. Nonetheless good for something different. Definitely worth the money."
"i find myself on the boat with the overall dogfish is a hit or miss brewery but when they do hit a home run it is a great one..and this is a great brew.."
"[D + 0] - 12% abv. is hidden exceptionally well. Perhaps the best example of hiding a high alcohol content that I've ever seen (Tasted). A bigger and more interesting example of a (IMO) boring style (Brown Ale)."
"I've recently read a lot of posts online about Dogfish Head being an overrated brewery. I guess when you make beer this good, it's inevitable that you'll be called overrated given the high likelihood that you'll be widely praised."
"D - about average for a 12%. While hidden better than many similar gravity beers, the addition of strong dark flavors keeps this from being remotely sessionable."
"Cheers,"
"D- The large presence of alcohol takes away from this being more drinkable, but it is a very nice sipper."
"Opinion: This is an excellent and well crafted beer. I like the depth of flavor and regardless of how he got it, Sam has a winner with this one. A wood aged American brown ale is a good description for this beer, but it has the typical super-hoppy ""American"" character to the side to let the malt and the wood accents shine through. I think that is a good thing and I would definitely recommend this beer. It is an adventure for the palate any way you look at it."
"Shazzam! Whoaaaa, nelly bell! Stupendous beer! Not exactly a brown ale as friend Euel says, it's brown and it's an ale. Ok. 'nuff said on that. But it pours with a small tan head and some lace. Color is an opaque dark, almost black, brown. Aroma is very rich and earthy, fecund, licorice, old leather, and bittersweet. Flavor's the same but more full and luxurient. Kim Jong Il would love this beer. Hail, feerless leader. Body is velvety smooth and enticing. Almost too rich. Not a session beer. Atlantic Monthly had a great article on brewmaster."
"D- this beer is definitely a slow sipper, it would be much more drinkable with a year or two in the cellar"
"Pours a nice brown without much head and some fizziness apparent in the body. Smell is basically all booze, and maybe a hint of piny hops if anything. Taste is initially very rich and roasty, but the booze overwhelms the entire brew eventually. It tastes like a brown ale with a few shots of vodka mixed in. Its very hard to drink this beer."
"D: Surprisingly well. One of the better brown ales I've had. Probably would only have a few in a sitting as I'm sure the 12% alcohol would catch up to you, although I didn't really notice it with one bottle"
"Live Oak Market. Wow is all I can say about this one. Have been reading about it for a few years and wanted, no, needed to taste it. It was everything I wished it could be. Good ABV. Good IBU. Taste was thick with a bourbon hint to it. The high ABV made for that. So very smooth and has a few similarities to the Life and Limb."
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass. Deep brown, almost black in color with a dark tan head that disapates quickly. Little to no lacing but the beer seems to cling to the glass. A great combination of sweet with bitter. Flavors were ever changing as beer warmed up. What a unique and delicious beer. At such a high alcohol level this beer could be deadly if I could afford to buy it in bulk. A sippn' beer if ever there was one."
"D- Truly decadent beer makes for a sweet, unique treat"
"Very drinkable for a 12% ABV brew. Alcohol is essentially masked, and the interesting depth of flavour holds the attention of my palate. Was glad to find this one, certainly recommend it, and will enjoy drinking it again someday."
"D: This beer is delicious, but definitely a once a night beer. Also, I am looking forward to the other three bottles I have from the same batch. I think I'll space them out about 3-4 months and see how they age!"
"O: Much better with a little bit of age on it opposed to fresh. I know my palate has changed a lot since I first had this beer a year and a half ago, but I remember it being a bit rough. Not the greatest imperial brown out there, but I think this will get even better with even more age on it. The longer you can wait to open this the better. (Scores adjusted to this review)"
"D- don't know how to feel about this one. without a doubt it's well crafted, and i can always appreciate coloring outside the lines. the woody resinous spicy sweetness gets to me in a strange way and i'm on the fence that divides like and dislike. i'd turn down another, but i'm glad that i tried one."
"D: For me, usually barrel aged beer I can enjoy one or two in a sitting, but I think I could drink this all night. A very different but quality beer."
"Though very sweet and a heavy-hitter as far as ABV is concerned, I could drink a lot of this brew and can't help wondering what sorts of roasted meats would pair best with it."
"Overall Impressions: Really a lot going on here (more than I can pick out). It is similar to other barrel aged beers, but very different as well. A very good beer for sitting in front of a fireplace at the end of an evening or enjoying after dinner with a cigar. Would have served it in an oversized wine glass and likely will for the next time. High alcohol for style (4.3%-6.2%), if it actually belongs in this style."
"drinkability: without a doubt the most sessionable beer i can find above 10%. fairly affordable too."
"I would probably have rated it higher overall without the whole spit thing, which I must admit is a huge turnoff."
"D- Big burn of alcohol here. Its also quite rich and hard to drink fast, but thats a good thing."
"Palo Santo is big and rich with a burning finish. This is a very slow, hour plus long sipper. I'll probably stash my other bottles for 5 years and see how it does."
"Overall, it's a surprisingly drinkable beer: creamy, hoppy, and packs a punch. Palo Santo ranks as one of my favorite Dogfish brews, though I wouldn't quaff it often."
"D - Very complex taste that is perfect for a cold fall or winter evening by the fire but the alcohol will catch up to you so be careful. My beer has been cold aged for a year but still tasted very smooth. I would imagine that the fresh version of this beer would have more of a bite to it."
"D: Two or three of these would make most, if not all people call it quits. I'd venture to say that after two of these bad boys I'd be good to go. A sipper that is not meant to be quaffed quickly."
"Drinkability - perhaps one of the most unique beers I've had and just as great as I would expect from Dogfish Head. However, the 12% does take effect fast and is in the taste so in terms of drinkability 1 in a night and I'd be done."
"Palo Santo Marron I thought wouldn't be too drinkable because of it's high ABV but it is the exact opposite. It is dangerously drinkable as it warms and the flavors smooth out into the alcohol. This bottle was less than a year old so I fully intend to buy some more of these to set aside as I can only imagine it getting better with time. Highly recomended!"
"Drinkability: A sipper. Very nice and will have again!"
"Overall: Will buy again. I understand the hype and the praise now and damn, is it ever right on."
"12 oz bottle to pint glass. Pours dark brown but by no means opaque, with a healthy tan head that fully dissipates over the course of a couple minutes. Brown sugar, raisins, molasses, and fruity, peppery alcohol make up the aroma. Flavor is burnt raisins, maple syrup, sugar, alcohol, dark fruits, and some chocolate. Rather sweet. The booze is obviously noticeable but actually not that distracting. Mouthfeel is sticky and thick, drinkability is above average."
"Drinkability: For the high alcohol, I thought this beer was easy to drink and I enjoyed the complexity of flavors and aroma. I thought the palo santo wood added a depth of flavor that was very intriguing."
"This was the first ""extreme"" beer I ever really had, and coming back to it over a year later this thing still blows me away. Easily one of DFHs best brews I've ever had. It's for sure on my top 10 beers list."
"This is an incredibly dark beer, essentially black. The head is deep tan. The beer had a rich, complex, and slightly woody aroma. Some prune, raisins, molasses, and vanilla are also in there. Little hop smell, and a decent curtain of roasted malt. The taste is exceptional. Very intense and full in flavor. Behind some alcohol warmth, there's a very earthy malt taste. The warming is intense, although the beer doesn't really get 'hot'. Fruits come out more in the flavor. The beer has a decent amount of residual sweetness, and a lot of alcohol in the finish. Full in body (actually, quite heavy). Drinking this beer is a very enjoyable experience."
"Drinkability- For high ABV, this beer early on has an almost unnoticeable booze taste to it, becoming very dangerous for someone such as myself. However, as I said earlier as it warms the booze overpowers the other flavors. For this reason it's a sipper for sure but almost a ""quick sipper"" so to speak. Also a little pricey, but for DFH it's worth it."
"Very nice pour with a super complex nose, figs, vanilla, ripe raisins, heavy molasses and brown sugar. The taste is complex to say the least with dark jammy fruits, vanilla bean, chocolate smothered raspberries, blackstrap molasses and caramelized brown sugar. You can pull different flavors every time you take a sip. The finest Imperial brown I've tasted, a sipper with incredible mouthfeel. Heavy, yet still bubbly-the finish is like the Energizer bunny."
"This is definitely a sipper. Perfect for an evening drink."
"This one should definitely be sought out."
"if you like brown ales with some punch you will like this."
"O - Try it. Very interesting and unique. Will definitely purchase again."
"Deep, dark brown color with a medium brown head. Sweet aroma with roasted malty smell. Definitely a boozy, sweet alcohol aroma that carries over slightly to the taste. Also a lot of sweet dark fruits and chocolatey bitterness. This is kind of a big beer but pretty drinkable I thought."
"D: This is a big beer and it is tasty, but it does fill you up pretty quick and packs a punch."
"Dark dark dark beer, decent head for such high alcohol. The carbonation is minimal in the taste though. Smell is caramel-esque. Deep thick flavor, almost stout-like but a lot sweeter. Not sure if I can taste the palo santo, but I do sense some oak like flavor reminescent of a bourbon barrel or the like. The after taste is the best part of this beer. Leaves a nice rich slightly woody/smokey flavor that lingers nicely. The alcohol does come through a bit, but it's not overwhelming."
"Smell is strong with alcohol and roasted malts. Didn't taste as boozy as it smelled. Very complex taste, I enjoyed the one glass of this beer I had. The wood added some very interesting flavors to this."
"Dark brown, oily, almost black with good initial carbonation that settles down to a lazy bubble trail. Looks more like a stout, really. Smells sweet, like brandy and wood. Taste wallops you up front with dark roast, then smooths to a smoky woody taste and sweetness that is really nice. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel is oily and lightly carbonated. Drinkability is good but the whack of alcohol makes this a sipper. I think I'll go see how this holds up to a spicy pepperoni pizza now."
"D - for dessert perhaps, limit to one bottle."
"Cheers!"
"D - A sipping beer to be savored. Very enjoyable."
"Pours an opaque dark brown color. A tan head rises to over two fingers. The tan foam recedes to a ring and stays throughout. Some lace is left behind. A surprisingly reserved aroma. Sweet malt, chocolate, coffee, and boozy alcohol. All the good stuff is there, I just wish the aroma was bigger. I have to stick my nose in the snifter and and take a deep breath to get anything. The flavor is huge however. A rich malty flavor. Chocolate, vanilla, creamy espresso, and some rum like alcohol. A full body that is low on the carbonation. Very rich, creamy, and velvety smooth. The alcohol shows, but it is a great beer to sip"
"A great beer; I'll be buying this again."
"Taste is as complex as the smell. Any hint of booze noticed in the aroma is absent on the palate. Lots of complex malt flavors. Slightly roasted, caramel, vanilla, burnt sugar, a bit of spiciness, bittersweet cocoa, some fruit (kind of berry like), and there is also a very faint, scotch-like, peat smokiness. About as perfect of a mouthfeel as you will find. It is full bodied and creamy with a perfect carbonation level. A very complex and interesting beer. A high price tag will keep me from purchasing this a lot, but I will pick it up again at some point."
"Verdict: I had high hopes for this beer, and they certainly didn't go unfulfilled. Palo Santo Marron is a big, bad brew with plenty of complexity and personality coming from the wood and booze. A twelve percent Brown Ale aged on exotic Paraguayan wood is the kind of madness we've come to expect, and the result is just as good too. I can't wait to see how this ages in the cellar."
"This beer reminded me more of a porter than a brown ale. Personally, I think this was a good beer but I probably would not have again."
"Upon sipping, flavors of rye bread, dark fruit, and shelled nuts are most evident. About a quarter into the glass, I figured out that what Palo Santo most reminds me of is a Belgian dubbel. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, almost like syrup or cream on the tongue. Alcohol leaves the mouth tingling, but it's nowhere to be found in the taste, much to my surprise. While it does sip like a bigger beer, I found it extremely drinkable. Nicely done, DFH!"
"The pour into my pint glass revealed a very dark beer with tan head. As I took a whiff of the beer I noticed a port like smell which lead me to expect a very sweet wine like taste. The first taste that I took, I got the initial kick in the teeth that a 12% beer gives. But after the initial alcoholic burn gave way, I started to taste a depth of flavor...vanilla, woody, slight roasted-ness. It ain't yer average beer. Especially as the temperature of the beer warms do the flavors really start to come out and the initial burn of the 12% starts to mellow greatly. 3/4 thru the pint the flavor of this beer is really popping and there's such an earthiness to it which really masks the potency; hardly any semblence of a high octane beer here. It's a very full bodied beer with layers of flavor profiles. The mouthfeel is obviously on the full bodied side but isn't like syrup. This leads to the drinkability of this bad boy, despite it's high percentage of alcohol, this beer is very drinkable as it warms in temperature. The balanced complex flavors and undaunting mouthfeel make this beer worthy to frequent consumption however moderation should be taken into account. A good beer and a very nice surprise for a beer which on paper seems very eclectic."
"Drinkability- excellent, will buy more"
"D: definitely high on the alcohol content, but given the way it tastes i wouldn't have guessed more than 9%. This is a very unique beer that I would like to drink a lot of, but its richness and price make it more of a special occasion beer."
"D: Drinks like a fine wine at 12.0%abv you'll feel the dark vinous nature and warmth this has to offer as well a deep layering and complexity. Warm this up in a chalice for best results. A slow sipper that will have you excited with every sip until the last when you realize that you are out."
"D: wow, this is a good freakin' beer. I can imagine enjoying this brew with some high-end chocolate or some smoked gouda or havarti cheese, maybe a nice aged cheddar. This is very likely to become a fall/winter staple at the jhoban19 household."
"Drinkablity/Overall: I could really get used to having this often. I love the smell so much that I don't want to finish this glass off. I'm smelling it more than my girlfriend smells her hair after she showers with a new shampoo. This is my last one, but I will definitely be picking it up again if I see it."
"all and all a great beer I highly reccomend it in dogfish head glasses the wood itself lets it to making the 12% beer more smooth just as in a 12 year old scotch is more smooth."
"D- Very enjoyable. I'm glad I bought a 4 pack. Due to it's heavy feel and alcohol content, though, I dont think I'd want more than 1 at a time."
"Picked this one up at CBX, had to get a growler of it. DFH has finally arrived in Chucktown! For a beer that's 12%, there's hardly any trace of alcohol in the taste. That has all the makings of a dangerous beer, if your not careful. I do like the taste though. Had a kind of a molasses/mutty/smokey malt taste going on. The smell revealed the alcohol a bit more and also had a nice molasses base to it. Def not a beer for someone who's new to ""the scene", but something a geek can appreciate."
"D: A drinkable beer, but slightly different from most American Brown Ales. A well done beer."
"Poured into a New Belgium goblet black with a thin off white head. No lacing. The nose has a strong alcohol burn to it. Once you get past that, there is a grapefruit scent to it. The taste is very complex, so complex I can't really describe it well. There are raisins and grapefruit flavors along with carmel and a touch of liqorich. The mouthfeel gets a cut in score because of the high alcohol burn that you must get over on the first taste. It's very overtaking. I also have to put the drinkability lower because of this same problem."
"I gave the drinkability a maximum of 5, despite the 12%, as I figured this brew would be worth the sore head had I drank more than 1 bottle!"
"The smell wasn't that appealing. As for drinkability, definately drink cold. There is a bite when drinking, and aftertaste. And its there at 6th one just as 1st one."
"The mouthfeel was light with a silky smooth texture. Drinkability was good although the alcohol over powered a lot."
"D- Oh man I could have a few of these easy but at 12% I probably would be floored! Overall this is one great beer. All the tastes described in the label are there and with great potency. Go grab this one."
"Drinkability - Wow...this is a great beer, but I'm seriously sweating due to the alcohol. Definitely a serious brew to sip on over a long period of time....but damn I'm enjoying every second of it!"
"D-Surprisingly drinkable for 12% ABV, but glad this is only a 12 oz. bottle. If they could learn from Samuel Smith's how to get a lot of flavor into lower ABV beers, this would be an amazing beer."
"How did they get this beer to be 12% abv with absolutely NO heat? I'm forgetting to slowly sip this beer, y'know .. to respect it, but really this is one of the most drinkable high abv beers I've had. A malt masterpiece."
"D: I love this beer soooo much, I have never experience a taste like it anywhere, however as much as I like big beers I wish the alcohol was a bit more reserved so I could drink a few more at a time."
"I am enjoying this a lot. Without a doubt one of the better Dogfish Head beers I have had. A great after dinner drink, or a winter warmer. Something I would recommend."
"Was not expecting this from a brown, I've never really liked browns from smuttynose, saranac, sam smiths or anywhere else but this one is close to an Imperial Stout, which puts it in a different league. It's like if sam smith's took its imperial stout and aged it in wood barrels and made it twice as drinkable with a bit more flavor. This has wonderful coffee and caramel smells with vanilla and chocolate in the background and an ever present wood smell that makes it all come together. Taste is more of the same with a bit of burnt sugar and raisins added in. mouthfeel is a bit syrupy but extremely smooth with a slight carbonation and a pleasant bitterness on the tongue. I could drink maybe two of these but no more, still a wonderful beer that i will most likely buy again."
"It's a big beer, and its flavorful impact inhibits overdoing it. You're not reaching for two in a row of this one, but you want it on hand for appropriate occasions like sharing with friends. It's so neat and so good. Its power, in regards to every component that constitutes it, however, hampers the frequency with which you'll grab the Palo Santo. It is, nonetheless, a very good beer."
"Drinkability: As you would expect from DFH this is a very unique beer, I haven't tasted anything like it before. The taste and the aroma seem to be from completely different beer, it's very surreal. Unfortunately, I think this may be a touch heavy on the alcohol, and this comes through strongly in the taste, meaning the drinkability does suffer slightly. 3.5"
"Finishing off the last of a 4 pack I bought ages ago. Pours an EXTREMELY dark brown, might as well call it black. Not too much head, but I'll attribute this to over-chilling (woops.) Delicious looking blanket and frothy ring around the top of the beverage. Smell is pretty crazy: a bit malty, dark fruits, some vanilla, spice, and a couple other things I can't label. All this is accompanied by an almost harsh woodyness. The beer does a good job on the wood flavors, with the sweet fruits on deck, followed by some lighter ideas of chocolate and malt. The beer has some bite too it, but not because of the alcohol, although it does have a warming effect that is enjoyable. The mouthfeel doesn't stray far from the style, maybe it's a bit heavier that other brown ales I've had, but that lines up neatly with the other characteristics of this beer. A nice brew to enjoy once in a while. At the price it's at I can't afford this one too many times a year, and given the way it drinks, although delicious, I wouldn't want to have too many in a short time span."
"Pours a lovely dark brown with a fluffy, 2 finger head. The smell is an unusual woody fragrance, extremely rich and inviting. Delicious! The taste follows the scent, woody with fruity undertones. No harsh alcohol or astringent flavors. Incredible. Definitely not something to chug, you want to take your time and enjoy every sip. Truly a masterful creation from Sam and the folks at DFH."
"This one pours dark dark brown with one finger of tan lumpy head. Smells of malt and coffee. Tastes of coffee, malt, syrup, and a bit a chocolate. Feels more like a porter than a brown ale, with carbonation just a little bit less than I'd prefer. Hard to drink more than one of these--it's fairly heavy and the alcohol makes itself felt rather than tasted, but it's definitely there. Damn fine beer."
"Poured a dark brown with a one finger head with that quickly faded to a collar. The aroma was very malty with maple syrup. The taste was very sweet without the syrupy thickness. Feel was medium with modest carbonation. Drinkability was good. This was a poorman's ((but certainly not in price), Robert the Bruce."
"Overall, an excellent beer that should be tried and sought out. The appearance score suffers for looking like a stout instead of a brown ale. If this beer were called a stout, I couldn't see anyone disagreeing. A must try."
"On tap. Served in a goblet. Color is a very dark brown, almost black. Thick, soapy head that kind of looks like maple cake frosting. The never never goes away. Real malty in the nose...smells sweet, like molasses and fruit, and some wood aroma in there too. The taste follows the nose. Sweet, followed by oakiness. Tastes like vanilla, molasses, figs (?), and almost chocolaty. Real nice mouthfeel. Creamy smooth with only a hint of carbonation. Leaves quite a bit of stick behind, but drinks real easy for such a strong dark beer. A real nice drinking experience."
"Conclusion: This was damn good; I'm glad I got to try it. Just another example of DFH pushing the envelope and another one of their successes. I really wish I'd bought two (this was from a mix-a-six) so I could see what a couple more years in the cellar would do to this."
"Thick, oily mouthfeel that I really enjoy, but it does hurt overall drinkability a bit. This is more of a sipper."
"Drinkability: This one is a sipper. Goes down like dark rum, and sometimes it makes me cringe a little. The flavors are faint compared to the thick body and slightly overbearing alcohol presence. I'm not sure how often I would drink this one; it could probably replace a trip to the liquor store."
"Overall: This is a very boozy brew but not in the 'hot' sense but rather in its warming effects. I really like the woody notes in this but it might be overkill considering all the complexities it has regardless. Would be curious to see how this would fair without the added woodiness from the vessels. Certainly not a go-to brown for me but as a sipper over a nice cigar like a fine cognac I feel this would pair nicely."
"Overall: This beer isnt the best ever. The overpwrering alcohol content and the aggressive flavor dont sit well. I wouldnt want to drink more than 12 ounces of this one."
"Beer served on draught in a snifter. Dark, black brown head, diffuse and tight, some lacing on the glass. Roasted malt smell, obvious alcohol in aroma. Some smoke in the flavor, mellow, can taste earthy wood, also lots of alcohol. Almost no aftertaste beer finishes clean. Mouthfeel is average, a little tin. Alcohol builds on you. A good beer."
"D: Really strong beer to drink, but well worth the price!"
" All that being said, If you were already tanked and had smoked 3-4 cigars throughout the evening (I'm talking some heavy Ligero bombs here) this MIGHT pair nice with your 5th stick. Then again, if your that deep into it, your better of going to bed than consuming this potent elixir."
"Drinkability: One and done for me. As mentioned above it is very boozy which detracts from the flavors for me."
"D- Drinkable to the fact that it is a great beer no doubt... but one for me would be more than enough. Would recommend."
"On draught at Pazzo's in Lexington, KY. This one pours a very dark brown color with a very small head and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is ... wow. Molasses, wood, fruit, vanilla, all kinds of stuff. The flavor is equally complex - lots of great dark malts such as chocolate and caramel with a complex sweetness that lingers and plenty of vanilla and wood character. The body is somewhat thick and I think the drinkability is good."
"A 12 ouncer, bottled on 2/11/08. More than likely one of the first batches of this beer. Poured into my Adnams Imperial pint tumbler. The ale appears a deep, dark brown color with about an inch of dense, creamy ecru colored foam. The head leaves no lace to speak of. Nose and flavor consist of alcohol, candied dates, figs, prunes, molasses, sweet and tart green apple taffy, wood tannins, earthy, tingly and spicy on the tongue and throat. Nicely carbonated and nearly full bodied for a brown ale. Very tasty and worth a try if you see it at your bar or bottle shop."
"I could have a few pints of it easily (if it wasn't 12%) but I wouldn't be entirely excited about any of them... just let me smell it all night."
"This is a tremendous ale. Rich, complex and luscious."
"The finish is a bit sweet and a bit tart, but carries the fig, chicory wood, and mushroom smokiness with it to the end. There is an underlying intensity and seriousness to this beer that is invigorating. The alcohol is present in the finish, but not prominent. Extremely smooth and extraordinarily well-structured."
"D) Yes. No kidding, that was all I could think of to type up for Drinkability. Tasty, well balanced, complex, but it doesn't blow your face off."
"This is a highly drinkable after dinner sipper. Nice."
"while it is everything DFH said that it was. This is not an easy beer to drink. if you have some of this, please share with a friend. you will both enjoy it more."
"It is at first there is Vanilla and some faint cinnamon and chocolate but there is also something else and it does get sickly after a while - its not aniseed but similar, it s nor the same cream soda taste you get in Stone IRS but similar - I DONT LIKE it sorry folks ruins the beer."
"There is a strong alcohol presence in the flavor that hurts the drinkability a bit. I would be curious to see how this one ages and mellows out. There is a slightly tart dark fruit presence as well with a very prominent wood/oak characteristic. Hints of dark fruit, candi sugar, vanilla, smoked malt and grape. This beer is very vinous with a bone dry finish."
"Had a malty, coffee, toffee smell with hints of vanilla. Tasted slightly bitter but with a sweet aftertaste, definitely something to enjoy and savor. The beer got better with every sip and probably would be incredible in the dead of winter. Good stuff."
"D - More enjoyable than I expected, I still don't think this is more than a treat beer, to have one before going to bed. Would go well with some food I bet, but still to dense and strong to see drinking multiple."
"D: Considering the abv this is a highly drinkable brew. I think the mustiness of the beer detracts from this slightly, though the sweet aftertaste brings you back for more!"
"D - Taste-wise, could drink this all night. But that alcohol level will really get you. I love the hints of wood in there and would love to have this on hand for cooler nights."
"Overall A great beer from a great company."
"Notes: They can call it brown if they chose to do so, and I understand style wise why this is not a stout, but this is a dark brew. It must be the darkest of browns and a delight to be had. Great inspiration behind the beer that gels into making something rather special."
"D - Very particular taste and very alcoholic. Would tire."
"Little to no carbonation to this brew, and yet it still seems to go down smooth even though the strong alcohol content (12% ABV) is obvious and the beer is heavy with a lot of body. The burnt malt and smoky wood flavors repress the alcohol taste and make this like a nice stout, almost leaning towards a port wine experience. This is definitely a tasty beer meant for sipping and savoring and I highly recommend it as it's quite unique. An outstanding beer!"
"The warmth hits well and welcome and makes this a wonderful sipper and a dangerously easy drinker. This stuff will sit well around the chilled months of the year."
"Very tasty, however, unless your goal is getting tanked, I recommend enjoying sparingly. An 8-9% would be much more attractive to me. Nevertheless, a quality brew."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied with fine carbonation. Smooth finish and drinkable."
"D) A well crafted beer. Thoughtful and creative. I'd drink another... slowly."
"Mouth is thick and quite viscous. quite nice. Very full-bodied. Drink is very fresh and crisp. Tasteful and good. Not too heavy. It seems a little smoother and noticeably fresher than from the bottle. The wood tone isn't so smokey and is instead earthy."
"Try it just for the experience."
"Thanks Bobsy!"
"An interesting beer, but the high ABV is a bit much for me."
"Draught @ Rehoboth: served in a tulip glass. This one poured a very dark, inky brown color. There was a small brown head on it, but it dropped off almost immediately. Very nice aroma. There is an overall richness, with some aromas poking out. I get whiffs of vanilla, chocolate, anise, some alcohol, chocolate, as well as a mix of fruits that is difficult to distinguish individual notes. The taste is a definite ""Oh Wow!"". The flavor is very rich, with some roastiness on top. A faint sweetness, and a huge collaboration of flavors, with a hint of bitterness at the end. Dark fruits, vanilla, chocolate, a woodiness amongst many others. Very Nice!"
"mouthfeel is great. nice and thick, nicely carbonated. at 12% abv., and given the fact that it has the sweetness of most brown ales, the drinkability takes a hit."
"Mouthfeel-Medium bitterness gives way to a very rich malty flavor. Initially sweet like a milk stout but the heat from the alcohol creeps in and warms the palate-in a good way. A froth on the palate intensifies the sweetness and much of the same flavors. The wood aging has given this brown ale a very mild edge. There is a lingering bitterness that is somewhat woody. I enjoyed this one."
"Drinkability: I would like to try this beer out of a bottle to fully wrap my head around it. I love wooded beer, because they have so much complexity within them. A great digestif for sure."
"Poured one shade shy of black with a half inch head that settled into a quarter inch, consistent skim. Intense and decadent nose - Coffee, toffee, cocoa, peppery, a little woody and some dark fruit in the mix. Taste follows nose - tremendous complexity. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, lightly effervescent and a little prickly. Initially, it was served a little too cold; however, as it warmed, its true character came out. Really enjoyable - tremendous complexity with a very well-hidden abv. I have to say that I prefer bottle to tap on this one."
"D= I liked this beer a lot, and I may even like it better on tap than from the bottle. For having a huge ABV and a very boozy finish, I still found this to be pretty drinkable and could drink at least two in a sitting if I wanted."
"This beer has some very complex flavors, compacted by a wonderfully dense aroma. The alcohol is warming, but not overpowering. Clocking in at 12 percent, this is surprisingly drinkable...which could be quite dangerous. The mouthfeel is excellent, bubbly and warm across the tongue, opening all the wonderful flavors involved here. The story behind this beer is quite interesting, and the beer seems to stand up to the hype. Good stuff."
"mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. some astringency. little carbonation but more of a stout mouthfeel than a brown ale. this is a dark brew."
"A sipper, wouldn't want one more than every several weeks at best. Good, but too much for me on the regular. I will be looking for this come winter..."
"D: Another winner from DFH, this is a truly original and incredible Ale (mucho credit to the brewers). This is on part with Indian Brown Ale and is a must try for all true beer fans. The best part is that this is not just some unique jumbled mess that you have hold your nose to finish but a fantastic brew that I truly enjoyed. Try this now!"
"This is a great beer, it coats the palate with a great depth of flavor that is pretty strong for a brown ale. A brown ale on steroids."
"I have been wanting to review this for quite some time. I poured into a pint glass to a thin film of dark brown head. It is very dark brown, borderline black. It smells of dark fruit with a hint of alcohol. It tastes divine. It is so smooth for a 12% ABV. I taste dark fruit, dark chocolate, and coffee on the back end. I get a little bit of the alcohol. This is just a good beer. I am very impressed. I would love to sip this all night, but I fear the alcohol would sneak up on me. This would be great on a cold winter night, very warming from the alcohol. I like this beer a lot!"
"D- Insanely high for the ABV. This beer is a god among mere mortals. This on tap was a sublime beer experience, Do not sleep on this beer!"
"I think I have discovered my favorite Dogfish Head beer. Palo Santo Marron is easily the best brown ale I have ever had. A must try."
"D- It might take a while to get through, but it is definitely a treat...one of my favorites"
"Well-crafted, interesting beer. I can't see buying more of this, but that's a personal opinion. It is very well done."
"Taste is better at hiding the alcohol. The caramel and chocolate go back and forth until a slight bitterness strikes ever so quickly followed by alcohol and metal. Aftertaste is weak whiskey, some vanilla. Yet it's fairly drinkable considering the abv."
"Wow, looks like an oil slick in my glass. Very surupy and viscious. Smells of booze, booze and brown sugar. First sip is very warm. Feel and taste the heat from the alchohol, but then there is more. Vanilla, brown sugar and dried fruit. Gets better as it warms. Mouthfeel is very slick and coating. This one will be much better come November, when its time to warm up while tailgating."
"Could have sat longer in the cellar."
"Overall, I definitely like it enough to keep coming back despite the high price. Yet another good beer from DFH."
"D - a real sipper, but it does a decent job hiding the 12%ABV"
"Poured from a 12 ounce glass with a bottled on date of April '09, so this brew is still pretty fresh. Poured into a snifter with about 2 fingers of dark foamy head. Appear as dirty motor oil. Smell denotes some dried fruit. Up front dark rich flavor biscuit and chocolate notes pretty well balanced. The booze is noticed in a warming relaxing feeling. The feel of this brew is remarkable in the light weight and drinkable nature. Great double brown ale."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipper, not a gulper. Couldn't have more than 2 in a sitting. All in all, a decent beer, not my favorite. Although its classified as a brown ale, I don't know if I personally would consider it a brown."
"Drinkability: The anti-session beer. The alcohol is noticeable on the way down and the weight of the beer alone is significant. Split a bottle with a friend if you're drinking a number of different other beers during the night. You'll enjoy it though!"
"Drinkability: This stuff is scary. It doesn't drink like a 12% beer. Delicious, complex, different, highly drinkable. I love what DFH is doing with browns."
"An interesting beer, an imperial brown ale. Definitely gets better as it warms. The alcohol starts to hit a bit harder. A decent beer overall, no flavors that shoot out at you though. I'd have it again."
"This is pretty far from drinkable. The sharpness does help. The alcohol is a beating, not to mention covering and sometimes down right searing. I can't do better than sipping, which is nice if it's due to complexity, but that's not the case. Or my palate is just not sensitive enough. Things seem to even out a bit toward the end, but not nearly enough."
"The taste of thick roasted malts, smokey oak, vanilla and a hint of coffee was a very pleasant surprise on the flavor. You know that there is a high alcohol content, but, it blended in with the flavor and the balance of all the components in this Brown Ale is just perfect! I will have to buy more of this bottle of gold ale!"
"Drinkability is one of the most interesting aspects here. There is a noticeable burn that is well mitigated by the woody aging, but to some it may be hard to get through, but I had not problem, thought it was great!"
"CHEERS"
"edit: Just figured out that the metallic taste that I was referring to was the extremely high 12% ABV. It is not covered very well and distracts from the other tastes the brown ale offers."
"This is very smooth tasting heavy beer, can't believe its 12%. There is slight taste of chocolate, notes of smoke and wood. Incredibly drinkable for its alcohol content."
"This is a drinkable brew; it's an American Brown on steroids. It reminds me of a sort of stout/belgian dark/brown combination. Watch out for that 12 percent ABV because it'll sneak up on you. Looking forward to the next 200."
"Drinkability:Too alcoholic for my taste. It has all of the workings of a strong beer: complexity, smoothness, and fragrance. The alcoholic bite really ruins it for me."
"D: So many big flavors and a good hit of alcohol make this one a great sipper so enjoy slowly. One of Dogfish Head's best!"
"d-despite the high ABV this sucker is pretty tasty and doesn't seem to overdo it with each sip. I could probably have 2 or three of these babies, but I would fear for my walking ability afterwards."
"Pours syrupy thick and wonderful. VERY dark for a brown ale, I would say it was a stout if I didn't see the label. About ¼ inch of foam that dissipates quickly. Nose is strongly of vanilla, alcohol, and chewy malts. Reminds me of bourbon stouts, etc. There also seems to be something spicy/Belgian smelling in there. Heavy bodied feel with initially sweet taste, caramel comes out quite strongly. Second taste brings out the Brazilian wood. Wow. Nice complexity with a bit of single barrel bourbon coming through. Mouth feel is much more like an imperial stout than a brown ale, but I wouldn't expect anything else from Sam and the guys at Dogfish Head. Finishes much sweeter than I anticipated with a strong taste of wood, vanilla and nice, roasted nutty caramel goodness. Great beer."
"Probably one of the best Dogfish Head brews available. Since they don't have a traditional Imperial Stout in their lineup, this is the closest thing to it. This isn't a beer I would buy every week, but it is enjoyable every time I have it. Recommended and worth the cash."
"DFH are cornering the market on 'different' brown ales with this one and India Brown Ale. This was very enjoyable!"
"D=very potent, though not like some other DFH beers, though it hinders sessionability"
"A brown ale that's been fed a whole lotta protein shakes and has gone through gladiator school, and comes out in the end larger than life yet refined, they must have snuck in some debutante lessons as well. Classify it as a strong dark ale or even a barleywine, I'm convinced. A Dogfish Head experiment worthy of the effort, and definitely worth the cost of the wood vats, definitely a worthwhile investment. After one of these I've had enough, although it's most certainly worth revisiting."
"Bottle Pours a deep black with a decent light brown head. The heade seems to last well. Produces some real excellent lacing. Has a great aroma of chocolate, roast, and alcohol. Has a good carbonation. And a swell mouthfeel. The flavor is good. Has an alcohol bite but it is good. Looks like a stout but the flavors a sweet and smooth. Has a thick texture and a full body. This one hits you in the lungs with the burn, I love that. Great finish and the aftertaste may be with me for a week. This beer flat out rocks."
"Pours a dark black color which lets no light through. Has a small foamy, tan head. Smells of molasses, caramel, oak, alcohol, and chocolate. The flavor is also molasses, caramel, oak, alcohol, and chocolate with coffee. This is a wonderful, sweet malt bomb. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, full bodied, with low carbonation, and very good drinkability. Not a sessionble beer, but a great one."
"D- High ABV and robust flavor makes this a sipper. It's good though, so I'll keep drinking."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is a half inch of tan foam that recedes very slowly leaving good lacing. The aroma is of perfumey wood, caramel, toffee, and more perfume. This is a very appealing aroma, and I can't really see how it could possibly be made better. The taste is a little maltier than the aroma, but there is still a large and pleasing perfume presence. There is a significant alcohol presence in both the taste and aftertaste. The finish is all wood, and perfume. Again, like the aroma this I can't find anything here to improve upon. The mouthfeel is full bodied with light carbonation fitting this style, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a great beer. It is utterly and completely unique. Not only is it an extreme beer in that it is twice the strength as other brown ales, it is an extreme beer in that it is aged in Palo Santo wood. I think the later is what makes this beer so enjoyable. I would love to sip away at this on a frequent basis. Very good work Dogfish Head."
"MF/D: Much heavier than I thought in the beginning. Very chewy, oily, and velvety...very nice mouthfeel. The drinkability is pretty high despite the ABV and body texture"
"Drinkability: One in a sitting is definitely enough. I love this beer, but man it is a sipper. It is a beer I would definitely buy again, but it would have to be a rarity that I always have stocked in the fridge but rarely break out."
"Can a classic beer experience be rated this ""low""? A really interesting and rewarding beer, but at this size and ABV, how do I have more than one. Maybe in the winter I will pop the drinkability up to 4"
"A lot going on in this beer, sip it like a fine scotch, more flavors come out as it warms. There is enough hop bitterness and alcohol to counter the sweetness, a fantastic beer."
"(D)- Man, one of these will be making you feel pretty good! Its richness/sweetness lends it to being a great after dinner beverage as dessert. Great flavors and complexities to enjoy via sippage. Also, I am looking forward to see how this turns out after a few years or more of aging!"
"It took me a few of these to learn to love them, the more I had of them, the more I liked them. Awesome beer! I love it."
"Overall, this is a fairly drinkable beer. It is hindered by the intensity of its flavor and the high EtOH content. It is definitely worth it and something I will continue to purchase if/when available."
"Man do I love this beer. In the bottle: fantastic. On tap: fantastic. Calling this an American Brown is just mean, cause it puts the entire style at a disadvantage (with a possible exception being the DFH Indian Brown, which is likewise amazing). Huge choclately deliciousness, with caramel, light coffee, dried fruit and roasted malt. Body is thick and delicious, creamy and full. This one slips into RIS territory, in my book. One I could drink for hours (or until I passed out, whatever came first)."
"Notes - I had to special order this one, but it was worth it. I've never had a beer quite like it before."
"Poured from bottle with a brew on date of 4/17/09. Poured in to my Portsmouth Tulip glass, pours an extremly dark brown almost black. Light can not shine threw and the head takes a little bit of work but can form nice. The aroma is very powerfull and full of scents. Firstly a roasty mollasses aroma with a hint of coffee and dark fruits hits your nose. In the background for some reason I get a smell of cherries, though in the background still strong. The taste it's self is very interesting for a brown ale. The brew has that ale taste to it with the dark fruits but the mollasses and others make this brew more of a stout imo. The consistancy is pretty thick also for a brown ale. The mouthfeel is very smooth and welcoming. 12% alcohol is strong and when you finish your first glass you should probably have only one more afterwards. This drink hits you hard after you finish me. Really like this brew and will keep it in the fridge for sure."
"D - This is a late night fireside brew for a quite time when contemplation and retrospection are in order. Definitely not a summer time fun brew by any means. Buy a case and sit on them until the time is right to break one out and spend some time reflecting on how good life is!"
"D: Eh...this one is tricky, a little too complex, and entirely too boozey to drink a lot of. Good beer, but it's a sipper, and a pleasure at that, but not something to drink more than one of. Just simply too huge. Too many things going on. I'll definitely be seeking this out again, and throwing a four pack away to age indefinitely."
" This would make a great nightcap or dessert beer. Not much of a session beer. In fact I'm rather glad it's sold in a 12oz bottle rather than a bomber. That would be too much of a good thing. The last few new DFH beers I've tried have seemed a bit gimicky. This one's not gimicky, it's damn tasty."
"Color is a deep, almost black mahogany. Head is thin and dissipates quickly, an indication of the amount of alcohol: a considerable 12%. The menu says the beer began as a big brown and that's how I'll judge it, even though I've never had one this robust. The aroma is cocoa and burnt brown sugar and something that reminds me of pecans. The taste is chocolatey malts and some hop bitterness, alcohol (not unpleasant), and coffee. This beer is delicious. The mouthfeel is thick, allowing a light espresso aftertaste to stick around for a bit. I will be buying a pack of this wonderful beer whenever the opportunity presents itself."
"notes and comments- blast of aroma as soon as the cap came off. strong beer that goes down pretty smooth. it wants to be a stout or some hybrid. not sure how to characterize this beer...there are disjointed components at work here."
"Notes: This is the most unique American Brown ale I have ever had which is a good thing. I would highly recomend this brew for any fan of American Brown ales. Cheers"
"Very thick mouthfeel. Not a beer you drink at the lake with your friends, more like put on some good music ( mozart's Requim atm) crack open a good book ( i recommend atlas shrugged) and take about an hour or more to sip this beer."
"This beer is very dark brown, nearly black, with a large, thick brown head. I can detect bitter hops and chocolate scents. There is a coffee bitterness to the taste, along with some alcohol. The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I expected. My notes on this beer are fairly sparse, but I don't think it is because it is a bad beer, I just don't think it is for me. Personally, I wouldn't seek it out, but I probably wouldn't turn one down if it was offered to me."
"Really drinkable for a big, weird beer. Love those casks!"
"D - Very good and complex beer."
"D: I would drink this again for certain, but would probably take it easy. I am sure the liquid baseball bat that is this beer would catch up to you quickly."
"The best beer DFH has made."
"For being 12%, I expected this to be more of a sipper, but it isn't. PSM is worth sipping or enjoying with restraint to allow it to warm slightly, and to bask in its rich complexity, but it's not hit-one-over-the-head strong. One of my favorites from DFH without question, Palo Santo Marron is well worth the try and will no doubt age well."
"D- Definitely a sipper, though it does hide the alcohol pretty well considering the 12% ABV. That being said, I wouldn't want more than one in a night."
"Another incredibly ambitious beer from DFH. Possibly my favorite of theirs so far. A brew high on imagination and execution."
"overall this is the most complex dfh beer i have had to date and cant wait to see what time does to this world class brew"
"Overall, a great beer and definitely my favorite selection from DFH. I don't know if I would call this a brown ale, but certainly a great, complex beer. Extremely enjoyable."
"Overall: I have had this twice now and boy does it hit hard. Over the top alcohol content means it drinks very harsh. The flavours are nice but package this in a 6 oz bottle and I would be happy."
"Drinkability - hmmm, you can't easily drink more than one. And because I was trying to really figure out exactly what I was tasting, I was sipping it frequently, which quickly made me buzzed. Drinkability is not high, but that's just because of the style, not the quality."
"Poured a two-finger brown head on top of a blackish body that contains a strong malt base in the aroma, mostly dark chocolate and sweet caramel. Smooth, creamy and medium-bodied with a great balance of chocolate and caramel malts, along with toffee, toasted, and some buttery notes. Slightly sticky but not syrupy, has a mild fruit taste from hops and figs to round out the beer. The 12% ABV is well-hidden and makes this a dangerous sipper. I recommend this ale to anybody."
"This was way to peppery for me to enjoy. I seem to have some real enhanced perception of peppery flavors, because the same thing keeps me from enjoying some Grenaches."
"I have no idea if I'm going to buy it again."
"Could definitely only have one of these and still feel good after."
"Very appealing on many levels and very nice. This is a great one to try with some age on it for perhaps some really wonderful nuances. I'll keep coming back for more!"
"This poured a very dark mahogany color with a short, but creamy and dark head. The aroma is a malty combination of woodsy chocolate, vanilla, and toffee. Also, there is a general smokiness to the scent. I felt that the sweetness seemed quelled by this woody hint. Generally, beers with an ABV this high are just too sweet for me. This was not the case here. Very rich and creamy mouthfeel. I think I would rather have had this on a cold winter night though."
"Goes down remarkably easily for its strength and depth of flavor, but with the alcohol manifesting itself so early and leaving its mark behind on the head after its gone, this is a hefty brew to be certain, and certainly a one bottle, two max digestif or a perfect nightcap. Highly unique and worthy of world-class status, certainly worth seeking out."
"EDIT: After having this more frequently, I have to raise the drinkability a notch."
"Price raises the expectations for this brew, but it does live up to the hype. Aroma includes earthy oak, caramel, brown sugar, fruit, molasses, the list goes on. I couldn't stop sticking my nose in the glass. The taste is what you would get if you mixed a dopplebock and a big brown ale. Bitter enough, but mostly malty sweet. Mouthfeel is excellent, 12% alcohol it is hidden well. I saved one for 3 months and the wood aroma/flavor dissapated slightly. Nice sipping beer at room temp - don't drink this cold please."
"D- I had three of these and realized why you should not have three of them at a time when I stood up. I got it together and would love to sip on another sometime soon."
"Out of my normal price range for an everyday drinker. It did nicely for getting me out of a mediocre beer funk. I would gladly consider this for a special occasion drinker, or recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it."
"Drinkability: Sip it slowly. I poured at 46 degrees F. As the glass emptied and the remaining ale warmed, I wished I had savored it even longer."
"One hell of a slump breaker, this beer reminds me what got me into craft beer in the first place...the beer. DFH has pushed some crazy stuff, and may that always be so."
"Drinkability: Sipper for sure. The 12% ABV pushes this beer into the after dinner drink/night cap category for me. Savor this one. Age it if you have the will. This is a beautiful brown ale - people who love brown ales will really enjoy this one. If you are new to brown ale - don't start with this one - work your way up to this beer and you'll find that you'll appreciate what Dogfish Head has done here."
"Of course, any beer that 12% ABV is going to pack a wallop and this was no exception. The taste of the alcohol isn't strong, but the presence and mouthfeel of it was there after each sip went down. It didn't detract from the beer at all since everything is very well-crafted here. I'm not sure when this would be good for, as I tend to drink Brown Ales in the fall, but this has to be the best one available in this part of the country. Worth a try if ya like your beers smoky, full-flavored, and solid top to bottom."
"Drinkability: Another winner from DFH. Probably my third favorite behing 90 minute and Festina peche..Wonderfully complex..everything you would expect from the brewery, I would gladly have this again."
"D. For 12% extremely drinkable. Has a bit of a boozey quality, but it works. This is a very good beer."
"Ive been really waiting to try this one. Finally found it and bought a single, 4 pk was a bit pricey. Pours very dark and thick. Tan head that doesnt stick around long. Very powerful scent of chocolate and some sort of sweet rum. Lots of complex flavor. Supposedly flavored with the palo santo wood. This was a definite sipper for sure but definitely worth the effort. Drinkability is a little low due to heavy mouthfeel and high abv but still a great beer."
"Drinkability: DFH knows what we want, bold ales that can be enjoyed time and time again. This beer is a DFH staple in my book, right behind the 90 Minute its a favorite from my favorite brewery."
"D: The ABV catched up to you. A very unique, ""big beer"" approach to a brown ale. Very sweet from huge maltload -- drinks more like a very sweet stout. DFH keeps it fresh no doubt about that."
"D- Definitely not a session beer like some American browns, but definitely a good nightcap."
"Drinkability is selective to certain crowds and will store well."
"this is a sipper for sure....high ABV and interesting tastes/scents that make you think about what you're drinking makes this one a beer for a special occasion"
"D- Id say a sipper."
"Pretty good beer. I'm not always down w/DFH, but I like this one. It's got some near RIS qualities. Including the appearance, some of the malt, and the mouthfeel. It also has some wine qualities. Reminds me a little bit of a Ten Fidy, actually. It's certainly worth a try. But for the price, I'll probably pass."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle with the marker: Bottled on 07/24/8 E. Sampled on April 29, 2009. The pour is dark and slow like molasses. The head is thin and tan but it never completely dissolves. The aroma is of chocolate malts and hops. It is distinctive in that way. Heavier mouthfeel. The taste is very much like cocoa, chocolate, and hops. Ends on the dry side. Quite marvelous."
"I'm not sure what Palo Santo Marron (Marron is Portuguese for 'brown') tastes like fresh, but it's simply sublime after almost 15 months in the bottle. Without a doubt, this is one of Dogfish Head's best. If they keep brewing it, I'll keep buying it."
"Taste: I'm surprised by how much wood flavor this beer still has even though it's just three months shy of a year. Definitely a robust and flavorful beer."
"This beer was bottled in September of 2008, tasted in April 2009. It is very dark... both the look and smell remind me of an imperial stout, nowhere near a brown ale. But who cares? I'm loving it. The taste is delicious; lots of malt, some vanilla, syrup, and smoke. It's way tastier than any ordinary brown I've ever had and every sip reveals more nuances. The alcohol is noticeable but never gets in the way of the enjoyability of this brew. It's very smooth and leaves me wanting more. This is definitely the best beer I've had from Dogfish Head and no other brown ale I've had can touch it."
"O: This is a beer for the true beer geek only. The average Joe would pour this out. A very complex beer with alot to appreciate. For anyone who like to drink brown ales, they are in for a big surprise with this one."
"D: Definitely one to sip. Glad Sam sort of went crazy with this one--it really worked out."
"On-tap at The Pit in Raleigh served in a Gouden Carolus chalice a nice almost opaque black with a nice tan head that dimininishes to a thin layer. Aroma is a nice amount of brown malts and wood balanced nicely together. The taste is a nice amount of brown malts, caramel, and hints of chocolate dancing nicely with the wonderful wood taste. The beer is medium bodied with a decent alcohol presence that's there, but not too overwhelming. I must say this one is truly amazing on draft."
"Mouthfeel is quite good. Drinkability is the one weak point here, due to 12%ABV and the strong/sweet flavors. Overall, fantastic unique and original brew."
"Drinkability ... err, based on what I have said does this sound like the kind of beer you'd want to drink too many of? Thought not. Interestingly, I would oblige in three or four of these if I didn't care about the fact that I would be really entirely too drunk. really interesting, original beer."
"Not really drinkable beyond one at a time, but that's not what it was intended to be. I could definitely see this as an after-dinner drink to linger over."
"D: This is certainly a dessert beer. I personally enjoy having just one at the end of a meal. However, a number of my friends have reported continued enjoyment through a four-pack! Regardless, this could never be a session beer - it's just too rich."
"Can't drink more than one of these in a sitting. Not solely because of the 12%, though the alcohol is noticeable, but it is such a sipper it takes a long time to get through."
"Pours brown-black, completely opaque with minimal head. It's a good thing they put ""malt beverage"" on the bottle, because this only vaguely resembles beer. Like their World Wide Stout, this is viscous, sweet and boozy like a port wine. Mixed in with the gobs of dark malt I detected a bit of the woody flavor that makes this brew special. Unfortunately I could not finish the glass because it was just too heavy for my palate. I'm glad I tried it though, and I have to give DFH creativity points."
"A bit oily in the mouth for me, but was extremely smooth and lacked much carbonation, surprising paired well with some spicy Mexican food I was eating. Drank pretty good for such a high ABV."
"well, this is the only aspect that was bound to suffer. at 12% it's not really something you can do much of. a slow sipper. nice for after a fine meal, or chatting around a fireplace i would guess."
"I really liked this beer. Wasn't sure what to expect after all the New Yorker hype, but this is a good one. Very unique with lots of dark brown flavor and mild sweetness, but not cloying. Just fills your mouth with flavor."
"D: This brew is not particularly drinkable IMPO. The color and flavor is betrayed a weak mouthfeel and flatness. Don't get me wrong, I like a good cask ale, but this isn't the same. Especially for the price ($4.39 here), I just cannot recommend."
"d - again, I didn't expect a stout as I'm not a big stout guy. But this gets a slot on my small list of tasty stouts. At 12% ABV one bottle is plenty. I think this is better chilled than near room temperature when the ABV starts getting louder in the taste and the masking starts to fall apart."
"D/O - A very interesting beer to say the least. Not a traditional Brown, but good is good. I couldn't really drink more than two of these in a night, but other than that it's a great beer. Another tasty brew from DFH. Cheers!"
"D: From the look to the smell to the unique taste, I do surprisingly like this beer. It's aggressive, but I like the concept and the execution. Imperial brown? Yes, sir!"
"D- I was going to give this beer a 3 on the drink because when I first opened it the alcohol taste was too much for me. It's still not my favorite but it got better. The 12% abv is a kick in the balls to by the way."
"T: Rich, dark roasted up front that brings a bitterness which undercuts all the way through. The bitterness is pleasantly balanced by a creamy mouthfeel. The combination of those two + a mild sweetness results in a dark chocolate like experience. Lingering woody bitterness in the finish."
"What a beer. Had to review this one again when I was ready for it. Smell mellow sweet and malty, almost reminiscent of the celebrator. Can't really smell the alcohol despite the 12% presence of it, instead more prominent smells are bready, chocolaty, molasses. Taste is as full as a beer gets, strong woody taste, almost like chewing on wood chips, in as good a way as it can ever be, slightly bitter finish. Really complex, sweet to bitter taste. Feel it balance out and get so smooth from the wood againg and feel the alcohol come out of your nose and warm your mouth. Very nice. Feels so smooth and great, what a beer. If you see this in a store pounce on it."
"Black in color with a mildly frothy foam head upon being poured into a pint glass. The foam is a mocha or tannish color. Strong malt nose with some sweet sensations almost like a booze presence. Thick and robust attack with a classic barley wine type of flavor. Mildly sweet flavor that finishes with an alcohol burn. There is a mild but lingering aftertaste that is made up of sweet malt and perhaps wood. Thick and rich mouthfeel. Some smoke notes. I am glad to have tried this, but wouldn't sit around drinking a few of them."
"Future outlook: American Brown Ale? I'd swear I was drinking a big barrel aged RIS if this were put blindly in front of me. Is there such a thing as an ""imperial brown ale," because if so, this is it. That being said, I'm beginning to think I'm not fully a fan of most wood-aged brews. This was an interesting offering, but I don't see much need to revisit in the near future."
"Drinkability's OK. This is an interesting and complex beer, but the ABV and strong raisinish flavors limited my enjoyment a bit. I would probably split this one with a friend next time."
"A very very good beer that is well made and complex. Definitely worth a try."
"Mouthfeel: Velvety and slightly heavy on the tongue. Nice low carbonation."
"This is a very unique beer, but if booziness is not your thing it may turn you off. No matter what though, it is unquestionably impressive."
"Kudos to DFH for this tasty number!"
"It was nice to drink a beer of this style which didn't taste like I was drinking a cup of coffee laced with alcohol as so many others do. I can't say this is a beer I'd care to have more than one of in one sitting, but it was enjoyable and one which, in the right situation, I'd have again."
"M/D- Soft and light. Nice sipper but watch out they can hurt you. I picked up a growler of this beer on my way out. Liked it alot."
"This beer had its ups and downs. I liked the smell and taste, perhaps the 2 most important parts, but wasnt huge on the rest. Pours dark with thinner mocha head. Good retention, no lacing. Smell was strong on vanilla, alcohol, toasted, and dark caramel. This was one of the ""woodiest"" beers I've ever had, the whole wood/oak flavor really comes through in the taste. Also notice the vanilla, caramel, burnt grain, and dry malt. A very warming alcohol burn as it goes down. Medium mouthfeel with a velvety texture and plesant aftertaste. Overall a good beer but the ABV was just too high and the alcohol came through quite dramatically on this beer."
"D: This may be classified as a brown ale by DFH but it has no business being called a brown ale. It's more like a strong ale but can come across in some ways like a RIS. I loved having the opportunity of trying it. It is definitely a great beer but it's too sweet and tangy and heavy in alcohol for my personal taste. At 12ABV, the beer is in the drivers seat - not the poor fool who is sipping it. You have to give it a try. It's one of those beers that makes you re-evaluate what beers are and can be. DFH may be surrounded by ridiculous hype but drinking a brew like this reminds me that their brand reputation is built on some real beer making prowess and pioneering spirit."
"D - So very drinkable, but such a high alcohol content, I may need a taxi after a few of these."
"D= Pretty good. Nice beer. I'm really happy I got to try it and I will be seeking it out again soon. Great beer."
"D: This beer is very unique and extremely complex. It is very enjoyable but the 12% ABV is easily the limiting factor. Not so much in an overbearing taste but in the compromised ability for me to continue standing."
"Drinkability: 12%? Really? Did not notice or taste it at all."
"I tried a 12 ounce bottle of Palo Santo Marron brewed by Dogfish Head. As soon as I opened the bottle an overwhelming aroma of wood enticed my flavor sensors. The appearance was the same as any aged brown ale, but the aroma was absolutely incredible! The Paraguayan Palo Santo wood truly made for a unique ""Holy"" experience. This is yet another great beer from the definition of American Breweries, Dogfish Head. The initial almost over barring flavor of burnt sweet wood hits the tip of your tongue. Then as the alcohol starts to tingle a wonderful caramel, and vanilla flavor comes out. This beer would work perfectly with a nice steak."
"Drinkability: Well, one was definitely enough, but this isn't the type of beer you'd want more than one of at a time, anyway. Great sipping beer, and one I very much enjoyed. This would make a great substitute for when I'm craving a stout anytime. Glad I had this."
"very nice dark brown.. deep in color.. scent was sweet to the nose .. hints of vinilla and sweet malts..taste was powerful.. reminded me of a after dinner beer.very sweet and smooth.. no more than one flavors start to be over powering.. one thing that stand out was a nice head for a bit to good lacing on my glass.. cheers"
"D: Definitely don't want to drink more than one of these at a time due to the ABV. It's a bit hot but not as bad as you'd expect with the 12%. I loved the story about Sam Caglione building a giant barrel out of this exotic and aromatic wood."
"Seek and consume. Bring WWS and 60 Minute to CA please! Cheers!"
"D: Could be dangerous."
"I think this aged well and rounded some of the edges. This becomes a very drinkable brown ale"
"Two more sips. The warmth accentuates the beauty of the flavor, the darker, wine-like notes expand, the fruitiness and vanilla morph into a danker representation . One more sip. I close my eyes. The flavor becomes even more robust and seductive, it is like an acid trip for my tongue and nose."
"Overall, it's a very good beer even though it's something I'd really only want every few months."
"Drink is decent at 12% I really couldn't see to many drinking more than the four recommended."
"This beer pours very dark, near stout territory with a small tan head, a little lacing and low carbonation. The smell is big of chocolate covered raisans and orange zest. The tast is big and bold which I come to expect from DFH, some chocolate notes, definately getting a little raisan flavor as well as caramel and a hint of alcohol... this beer could use some more time to age. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy with a low carbonation level and for 12% this is ver drinkable."
"This is one I can spend almost an hour enjoying which I routinely do at their pub. There is nothing better than spending an hour watching a game and nursing a glass of this stuff. Best sipping beer of all the DFH in my opinion except maybe the world wide stout. This beer is so good and so expensive it is going to be my ruin."
"D - Although this is good, drinkability is low. Much like other DFH beers, the alcohol is very high for the style. This makes it a slow sipper."
"Overall impression: Interesting example of what wood flavor can impart to beer - this beer has an interesting story behind it, and plenty of flavor to back it up."
"Feel was big and thick, very coating, took my time with it. Drinkability was good for what it is, I wouldn't want another right away but I will get it again."
"Surprisingly drinkable even given the high alcohol. I have 7 more so curious to see how they are over time. This is what makes me want to be a brewer."
"D: The hugeness of this brew and its insane abv make it a definite sipper. But its amazing complexity of rich flavor and aroma, accompanied by warming alcohol, make every swig different and interesting."
"This beer pours so dark that light cannot penetrate it. I literally took a flashlight to the glass to see if the lght could me give a glimpse of the beers true color. It is an extremely dark brown/red. Almost no head at all, what did form was very thin and dark. Pours thick. Smell is pleasant,- I detect an undestated smokey malt scent, although not overwhleming. I expected more woody aromas, especially considering the hype around the wood tanks I read so much about. Taste, to this drinker, was very similar to a porter- earthy, malty, but you defnitely get some wood flavoring and a subtle spice on the tongue and throat. Mouthfeel was suprising- very complex- almost oily, with light spice, sort of coats the mouth and hangs around- the taste lingers a long while. Drinkability is not high, at least not for this beer guy. While this is a very well crafted beer, I found it very tough to drink more than 1 in a sitting. It's got a strong personality. A good beer, very well crafted, but not my personal favorite style."
"This beer is simply amazing. Its is almost totally opaque, which for a brown ale is a little suprising, and has little head. The nose is somewhat subdued, there is a strong woody note there which is interesting but not overly evocative. The real strength here is in the taste. This beer is big, oily, dark, and woody to the extreme. I have never had another beer that covers the mouth in the way that this one does, it literally seems to coat your palate for a good few minutes. An exceptional beer, one of the tastiest I have ever had. Well worth the price and a definite re-buy!"
"Whoa. This is a sipper of the highest order. Each sip demands your attention as you work through the flavors and the alcohol. This is not a complaint and the beer is quite a good one (and quite unique) but more than one (edit: ok, maybe 2!) of these would have to be quite the night."
"Like most beginning beer drinkers I was first drawn to Dogfish Head because of the big bold flavors and their reputation for ""off-centeredness"". I still think they're a great company but over the years I kind of got sick of the 90min, the 120 and WWS and all their zany ingredients in general. I guess I was feeling anti-extreme, and I just wanted a well-crafter beer with 4 ingredients. A friend recently suggested this beer to me again and it's renewed my interest! Pours a thick-looking opaque brown with head of small bubbles. This beer has so much character. Initially sweet and malty with brown sugar and licorice notes. Not much bitterness to this beer at all, but it's rounded out by a very bold and robust woodsy-ness imparted from the Palo Santo barrels built specifically to make this beer. This is the main attraction here. Carmel, nutty, and almost a bit smoky. Lush and smooth on the palate. A really interesting beer that I tend to drink towards the end of the night. Quite relaxing. Also it's worth checking out the video about this beer if you can find it online, pretty cool. Cheers."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable but with this ABV I'm not having more than one an evening. This beer should be in a style category by itself."
"drinkability: i realize the palo santo wood is the feature of this brew, unfortunately it's not my thing. i am glad i tried this one, but won't be revisiting it."
"Love this beer. Steep price, but have you ever tried to build a barrel out of Palo Santo wood? Pricy endevour right there."
"First impressions are huge, and this beer looks gorgeous. Shine a flashlight on the other end of the glass, and I'd bet that you wouldn't get any light on the other side. It pours and looks like a great stout with a dark tan head that stays around. The smell is slightly tinged with alcohol, but that's to be expected from a 12-percenter. Other scents I get include sweetness, almost like an orange, and vanilla. When I taste this, it's very reminiscent of a very strong sweet stout. The sweetness compliments the alcohol very well. Drinkability is slightly low due to the thickness and high alcohol, but this obviously was never intended to be a session brew. Overall, this is an excellent beer among the best I've had from Dogfish."
"Drinkability: For a brown ale, it's very bold beer with a lot of flavors. I like the flavor but it's strength keeps it to one or two before moving on to something a bit lighter. Definitely a good choice to have with some pub food."
"The first time I had this beer I loved it so much more than the second time. Maybe I was just so caught up in the story of the beer, I swore I could taste the wood, which was much less apparent this time. Still liked, just not in love. boy 250 characters is a lot."
"Pretty bold flavors from this beer, which i like. Definitely could only drink one or two at a time though, but at this high abv, thats prolly all i would need."
"Overall - An excellent brew for casual sipping. It's thick yet smooth, dark yet mild, something yet...well, something else. Just try it, dangit."
"Had this on tap at the Rotten Apple in Grafton. This is really dark for a so called brown ale. It had a rich smell and appearance but it was much sweeter than I like. It would have gone well with food as it was almost wine-like. A good beer, just not my style."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass, beer is darker than I was expecting from a ""brown ale", looks more like a porter or stout. A very dark brown on the pour, appears black in the glass with a thin, effervescent head that quickly dissipates to a thin bubbly ring around the rim of the glass. Nice lacing as I gently let the beer slide around the snifter walls. The smell is very apparent and complex. Underlying sweet malt comprised of dark fruits, black licorice, star anise, bourbon, and roasted notes like bittersweet chocolate and lightly toasted coffee. The alcohol is there but not in an offensive fusel alcohol way. The flavor matches the smell and then adds a whole new layer of complexity. The dark fruit component is represented by dates, figs, raisins and anise. Once you get past the initial sweetness, there is a good bitterness balance but no hops are evident. The bourbon-esk flavor produced from the wood is apparent. The finale is a big hit of alcohol that really wakes you up and reminds you that you're drinking a 12% abv beer. The ethanol tends to linger as well as the dark malty flavors but in a much more subdued role than the alcohol. The mouthfeel is what you might expect from a beer this big - full bodied with a creamy, rich carbonation. There is a definite warming effect from the alcohol. Overall, a very drinkable beer from the aspect of being likable but definitely one you would want to sip and enjoy. Also, for nearly $16 for a four-pack you may be encouraged to drink it a little slower anyways!"
"Notes: This is one kick-ass Brown Ale! Great flavors, good complexity, an intriguing depth and an outstanding mouthfeel. What the hell else do you want? This is everything I hoped it would be, and more. The best Brown Ale I've ever had! Highly recommended"
"drinkability: very slow, brandy like sipping action"
"3.5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4"
"Drinkability was low due to very high ABV, and too much of a wood flavor for me. One and done."
"D: Pretty high ABV, but despite that the booziness isn't as intense as I thought it'd be. Definitely not a session beer. Should be sipped and enjoyed slowly. Another great DFH beer."
"I would drink this on for dessert. Glad I tried it, but not sure how much I could drink and still walk to the fridge for more."
"The drinkability is moderate, the alcohol does not stand out in either smell or taste, but the thick body and minor carbonation hurt its drinkability a bit."
"I was pretty excited about trying this beer, and I'm still unsure what to make of it. For originality and intrigue, I give this beer 10/10, but I wouldn't drink this on a regular basis. I also would not offer it to a friend and expect them to like it. Maybe it was the strange medicinal character of the wood that I'm not used to. I'm definitely going to age the rest of my DFH PSM for a few years and come back to it."
" Yes, My lips are sticky, but it's a long, long dry, hot bitter finish is rather unpleasant, yet interesting. Bitter chocolate and high earthy PH balance-earthy hop with big alpha acid's really takes it's toll on the palate. Fun to contemplate, hard to drink. The 12% abv is a sneaky devil. BEWARE the snake-oil salesman!!!"
"If this is brown than I'm purple...pours black as any export stout with a tiny brown head that rings the outside of the glass. Smell is very complex. Notes of sweet warm vanilla and wood are the most dominant. A sip reveals a smooth sweet maltiness with just a bit of hot alcohol. Alot smaller alcohol profile that the 12% would suggest. Mouth feel is easy and thin. Overall I would guzzle this down and go looking for some hops! A really great beer,just not my style or especally price range. I bought a bottle to try and a bottle to lay down. So I'll get to that other one in a year or so. Hopefully the country hasen't gotten any worse by then!"
"This is just what the doctor ordered for a snow day afternoon. I'm glad I have more of this!"
"Overall - My first DFH brew and i wasn't let down... an outstanding turbo charged brown ale... highly recommended..."
"Overall, a very original brew by Dogfish. Well done."
"D - oh yes it is!"
"This is my favorite of the 3 DFH offerings that we get in Northern California. Price for a four pack ($14.99) puts a damper on how often I will revisit this beer, although to me, one is enough in a night."
"D- This is an excellent beer to sip on. Definitely one to savor however I just don't know how much I enjoy it. I find that big beers can be really hit or miss for me and this one was a little off target from my taste."
"This is a little too unique to compare to other ""American Brown Ales"". If I were classifying it, it maybe should be called an Imperial/Double Brown Ale. Whatever it is, I'll come back to it again. DFH is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"HV"
"I want to like this beer, but I just can't bring myself to give credit where none is due. The boys at DFH need to rethink this one."
"This beer goes from above average in some areas to excelling in others. I'm not a big fan of some of DFH's beers, like the IPAs, i find them way to busy for what I'm looking for. But now, it is what I'm looking for in this, and it does not dissapoint. A top notch experimental brew, and everyone should give this one a shot. It shines in several areas."
"Smooth and well balanced. A nice combo of upfront sweetness with a dry finish. It's hard to pull out a distinguishing characteristic of this beer. I imagine the wood aging plays into the equation. Possibly the smoothest and easiest drinking 12% beer I've had."
"D: If it wasn't so hard to find and so expensive, I'd keep this on hand at all times. It's very tasty and 12% ABV aside, it'd be easy to drink several."
"Pretty close to transcendent. While the mouthfeel or appearance didn't blow me away, there's nothing wrong there. The nose and especially the flavor are freaking out of this world. Even the 12% alcohol is incorporated well. Another thing I like about this is that even though wood (specifically, Palo Santo wood from Paraguay) is the main reason for this beer's complex character, wood is far from the most notable flavor characteristic. For an exotic high quality sipper of a beer, and one that isn't really like any other beer out there, you can't go wrong with this. One of DFH's absolute best."
"Overall, a beautiful - and different - beer. Thick and complex, this beer is all about showcasing the rich malts and the Palo Santo wood. At 12% ABV, which is certainly a surprise in itself, this beer is delicious as a after-dinner sipper or just something to relax to. Split a bottle with a friend and sip slowly. IMO, one of the most interesting beers out there right now!"
"Overall- This is one of the most interesting beers I have ever drank. I love it but I am not sure everyone would."
"12% ABV? I've tried this a couple of times and had no idea that this beer was this strong. I would have guessed in the range of 8%. That along with a great flavor makes this one dangerously drinkable. A great beer overall for sure."
"This beer definitely killed me; the 12% alcohol more than shows immediately, and goes straight to the head. BEWARE of this one. I'm glad I tried it but it might be a while until I have it again."
"Generally a good beer, I'll certainly seek out more if I can. Also, definately NOT a session beer, but mostly because the 12% would do you in and it's probably a little overly sweet."
"Tasty and interesting."
"It's a very nice beer, but it's a sipper. Couldn't see drinking more than one of these at a sitting."
"This is a serious brew. I don't know if it doesn't need it's own category like an Imperial Brown. It almost has to be judged on it's own merits rather than against the American Brown style, IMHO. It is way above and beyond any brown I've ever had."
"I have mixed feelings on this. On one hand, I love how aggressive and unique it is, on the other hand, it is borderline overwhelming, and completely pushes the envelope, yet I crave more."
"D- This is such an impressive beer. It display great complexity on the nose and in the palate. Not something to have more than 2-3 of but definitely one of the best wood brewed beers out there."
"I've lapsed in my ratings, and this one brought me back. I've had prior, but just now became available in east tennessee in liquor stores. Pours almost black... brown ale? depending on the pour you either get a thin cappuccino head, or just an oily black beer. Either way, you know you are in for something good. Aroma is sweet and roasty, with notes of bootshop (more on this below). Mouthfeel is something to write home about... thick and creamy. In wine tasting I've always heard the ""Leathery"" descriptor, but this beer is accurately described as ""leathery", and I mean that in the best way possible. The wood they age this in must be magical. Gives a tannic pinch to at the end of the swallow. Drinkabililty might not be high due to the alcohol, and how thick, rich, and complex this is. For me, this is world class."
"Overall the best 'brown ale' I've ever had. I know the last one is always the best but this is no joke. Pick it up quick! I'm booking my Delaware beach house for the summer now!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth, heavy body, low carbonation, sticky."
"No ignoring the three finger+ head when poured, compresses steadily but the froth can be spooned out by hand before gone. Completely black in color, hard to find any variance in hue. Nose drips black, golden raisins, dates, rum cake, pan-seared molasses, very boozy, malted milk balls, sticks like glue to your nostril pores, some notes of sharper green apple, thick enough texturally that you enjoy it more just getting steamrolled than trying to pick this apart from that. Full-bodied, as in the nose you feel the warmth of the alcohol but no burn nor bite. All about roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, molasses, rum, and French vanilla ice cream flavors. Green grape, fig, raisin, date, plum fruit alternate between freshness and dried fruit sweetness. Carbonation is sneaky strong, anything which can stir this brew has muscles. A touch of orange or grapefruit at the end reminds you that hops must be a component of the finished product. Can't say I could put down more than one bottle at a time, the beer equivalent of vintage port."
"Highly reccomend."
"may need some time in the cellar to calm things down."
"cheers!"
"Overall: The beer is super rich dark brown ale. The beer mouth feel is carbonated and warming. The finish is bitter with a full finish. I can taste the hops in the beer but the malt is a bit more powerful. The alcohol is very strong but mellowed out in the beer. The beer is very flavorful very well made and deserving to any beer enthusiast"
"This beer was bottled on 10/23/08, I guess it is the third or forth batch through the tanks. It pours a deep dark brown with a dark tan head that quickly disappeared. The smell is a little boozy with sweet brown sugar dominating and a hint of vanilla. The taste really hides the alcohol, brown sugar then quickly followed by a slightly bitter piney flavor. The bitterness hangs around more than the sweetness, I like the way the taste keeps going even after it is swallowed, normally this is a bad thing but here it is very good. A very good beer, the smell was muted, the taste was awesome, mouth and drinkability very good. I tried it when it first came out and there was more sweetness, now it is on the bitter side."
"Drinkability- A flavour intense experience-hides the alcohol very well though."
"Drinkable? I drank it!"
"Good drinkability albeit the 12.00% ABV. This beer left me baffled, I don't know if I had a brown ale or a RIS."
"Smokey malt dominates the front end of this bottle with chocolate and alcohol to follow. In between there is some almost tart flavor I can't identify but I like it. Has a great mouthfeel that is complex but yields to the alcohol. This is one of the few really interesting beers I've had in a while. I'll keep a few in the basement to see how they do over time. Too expensive!"
"Came out much darker than i expected. Black in glass with zero clarity. Tan creamy head. Not much lace. Smell is acidic in a good way. Dark coffee and some fruit with some woodyness showing as it warms. Taste is bitter chocolate up front with some smoother cocoa notes to follow. Some earthyness as it goes to the back of the throat and it finishes slightly bitter. Alcohol is well hidden, I'm guessing that it shows in the some of the dark fruityness. It does have a warming feeling as you drink it down. A real sipper, with one being enough for a night. Well worth a try and I'd have to say that overall it's one of the better brews I've had from dogfish."
"D- I wish I was more familiar with Palo Santo wood so I would be better at detecting any noticeable flavors. Nice brown ale, with a wonderful taste and aroma. A bit high on the alcohol, but it isn't too noticeable."
"D - This beer is great, while I don't get the Brown Ale classification, I can't take that away from this great beer"
"Tastes of Vanilla and Caramel remind wallowing in my mouth. Finishes very well and is quite a drinkable brew that I know this guy will continue to still enjoy."
"Wow, the mouthfeel of this one is superb. Very thick, smooth and sticky, coats the mouth. Very nice."
"D - Oh I would most definitely order another one of these without the least bit of arm-twisting."
"Notes: My first perfect score, a 5.0 all around and easily my favorite DFH beer."
"Thick, rich, and creamy in the mouth. Definite viscous feel to it. Full bodied. Carbonation is spot on - one aspect I think completes this brew. Alcohol is warming but definitely not anything crazy. A fantastic dessert sipper - it's incredibly complex and enjoyable."
"Overall, an OK beer from an overrated brewery. While I appreciate their creativity, I find their beers usually aren't for me. Heard really good things about this one so gave them another shot. Don't recommend unless you can ""borrow"" one from a buddy. One and done."
"D- Wow, this is some beer. DFH really knows how to make a beer that is completely different, and this one is a raving success. Each swallow is another adventure for your palate. Great stuff. The only thing that would keep me from having too many would be getting very hammered. I'm going to cellar some of these; this is definitely a beer that will grow with age."
"This is a very nice sipper on a cold day. Not a beer to entertain several of in one sitting, but a perfect nite cap. Sweet like a sherry with a good balance of flavor. A very enjoyable beer. A hefty tag - I paid $12/4 pack but I've seen as high as $18/4 pack. That notwithstanding, worth seeking out and enjoying. This is not what many would consider your typical brown ale, but then, few things from DFH are ever typical, and my taste buds don't seem to mind. The information on the lable and the ABV should dispell the notion this one would be ""normal."""
"I love brown ales this is much more like a stout. A good effort, but not my favorite form DFH"
"A syrupy backbone with an intense amount of malt flavors. Dark fruit mixed in there too, perhaps prunes or raisins with light chocolate. A complex beer for sure with some alcohol heat. A tad unbalanced, but interesting nevertheless."
"My expectations where met."
"D: Amust have for any extreme beer fan. Though the gravity is high, the alcohol doesn't interfere with the deliciousness of this brew."
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, very strong kick, good representation of style while leaning toward being a stout. This is a nice high-powered beer to drink for a while if you're looking for something different."
"To summarize, this beer probably has a very devoted cult following, but other than that minority, this is a one-timer, or at best, a once in a while when the mood is right."
"Pours a nice dark brown, almost black color with a thin tannish head. Smell is of vanilla and some slight alcohol can be sensed. Very unusual taste.. bit very good taste as well. Some brown sugar and more vanilla, slight alcohol taste can be tasted but it is quickly subdued by the sweetness of the malt. Nice mouthfeel to it and good finish. You can really feel it warming you up, as it's about 3 x the strength of the average beer. I've been dying to try this beer and a long day of shoveling seemed to be a good opportunity to enjoy one. A great sipper beer that is an enjoyable 12 oz experience.. a little pricey tho ($12-13 a 4 pack)"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle..Poured deep reddish brown, almost black, with a thin cherry red/tan head that disippated to a thin film and left little lacing. Strong aromas of sweet malts, chocolate and cherries. Complex flavor profile featured chocolate and dark fruit, mostly cherry, and included licorice, caramel and a distinctive fresh wood sensation as expected. Medium body, minimal carbonation, and a pleasant malt aftertaste. Very little in terms of hops bitterness, but it's there if you look for it. Alcohol is evident and warming. The palo santo wood is a very interesting addition and makes this a very special treat. Definitely on my top 5."
"Enjoyed on-tap at Tailgaters in Orlando. Pours a dark gown color with a light tan colored head. The aroma is very malty with hints of chocolate and oak, very nice aroma that gets better as it warms. The taste like the aroma is very malty with some wood-like notes and some alcohol in the finish. This is another awesome beer from DFH that is recommended!"
"D - While I will praise Palo Santo Marron for being another unique offering from DFH, it is almost undrinkable. Alcohol aside, the wood is just too much. Judging from the nose there are other things going on in this brew, but once it hits the tastebuds the wood overpowers most anything else."
"Not exactly fit to style this is still an interesting beer."
"I'm not entirely sure one could call this a brown ale, but it definitely tries to redefine the boundaries of the style. It's a sipping brown, not a standard, easy-drinking brown. The complexities brought on by barrel-aging are enjoyable with this brew, and best savored slowly. Thumbs up to DFH on this one."
"Truth be told I did not care for this during the first bottling but I have grown to it and love Palo Santo. This is even better on tap and i will never pass up an opportunity to try it that way. Great innovation by DFH once again, i'm glad this is a seasonal now."
"The Palo Santo Marron is a grand experiment in the micro-brew world. Fortunately, the resulting beer is quite tasty indeed, and definitely not like any other beer. The perfumey aromas of the wood leap out of the glass and the vanilla-coffee-toffee-caramel notes weave nicely into the richness of the strong brown ale. The one point I would state against it is that there was a whiff of something solvent-like nailpolish remover that was a bit off-putting. This is a fresh new avenue for brewing...just because a particular wood isn't traditionally used for making barrels, doesn't mean it wouldn't give a good flavor to beer."
"The body is big and sweet. Sure its big but there is a linger sweetness that just lingers into the finish. Carbonation is a bit light which might help the balance out. I suppose this is an ager but really there is a lot going on here. And why a US brown?"
"Big, sweet, medicinal, woody. I'm a little put off by the sweet medicinal flavor in this beer. That's my main thought, but I probably had too high of hopes for this one. Palo Santo Marron isn't a bad beer, but the unique woody flavor suffers from its sweetness for my palate. There is some dryness from the wood, but the mouthfeel is still fairly cloying for me. The flavor is complex, and there are some good notes in there. It's just all a bit too much. The alcohol is a bit forward for the sweet syrupy feel. I enjoy the beer, but at the price, I probably won't buy one again soon."
"overall another great off centered ale that seems to have no real style but is in its own category of greatness. i really enjoyed this beer and recommend it to anyone who loves beer."
"Drinkability - While the flavors seem to mellow with time, the bitter taste seems to move forward on the palate. While there is a complexity to enjoy, the beer dominates and it is difficult to imagine having two in one sitting."
"This is a fantastic, unusual and unique style. $20 for a four pack is pricey, but you would pay $10 a bottle in the restaurant or bar."
"A very interesting beer we have here. Very dark in color, almost black but not impenetrable. Medium creamy tan head rises and falls to a ring. Wow, big nose on this one. Woody and soaked in vanilla in a complimenting fashion, not overwhelming by any means. Caramel, chocolate, nice coffee presence that becomes more apparent as you drink. Sweet and lightly tart fruit, cherry being most apparent and possibly even raspberry. Very tasty, here. Surprisingly low level of heat for such a monster of a beer. Wide range of flavors and well balanced. Nothing is distracting or in your face. Woody character becomes a bit more apparent, imparting a slight dryness to the beer. Personally, I'm enjoying it. A moderate sweetness compliments with vanilla, caramel, and coffee most apparent. Fruit here still also. Damn, this is great. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy but again has a dryness to it thanks to the wood. A little tingle on the tongue after each sip. I easily finished a single 12 oz. serving. Might consider two. Intriguing beer, as are many that DFH tends to put out. Thankfully, this one works well. Might be time to pick up a 4-pack and set a few aside. Recommended."
"Drinkability- very good considering the 12% goes down easy with a good pinch in the aftertaste."
"But really if you read and remember one thing about what I've said in this review, just remember 'I should try this if I've seen it and never had it'."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: The beers body is full and creamy. The alcohol is present and announces itself with authority. I love the experimental beers Dogfishhead makes. This was a very enjoyable beer experience. Thanks!..."
"I want to get a bottle or two of this to cellar for a good length of time, to see how this changes. I imagine that it will become extremely tasty."
"It took me awhile to warm up to this one. The pour offered very little head, which quickly dissipated. The aroma was that of almost a dry wine, with a hint of a woody and fruity smell. After about three or four sips, I came to the conclusion that I DID enjoy its drinkability, but wouldn't rush back to have another. All in all, enjoyable but not worth the hype."
"well..its drinkable but by no means a session beer...one or two is enough. nice dessert beer. great to share. :)"
"Drinkability: Yes indeed."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
" If i had the patience, this would have been aged."
"This beer pours a deep, dark black, with reddish tints, and a single finger of tan head, that disappears readily. The smell is prunes, dates, and an intense wood essence, that I admit I cannot identify (beyond the description on the label). The taste is floral hops, heavy black fruit, caramel, vanilla, and an acrid woodiness, again hard to describe. The carbonation is quite low, and the finish carries on the heavy woody sweetness. The body is very thick and viscous, with obvious alcohol warming. It sticks to the palate, making this a slow, if exotically tasty tipple."
"this bottle was about 4 months old. stout-dark, small brown head. smells very sweet, some black cherry fruitness, and the palo santo woodiness. Taste teeters on the rim of an imperial stout. Nothing like any other brown ale I've had. sweetness is thankfully much subdued by the hop bitterness, but still finishes nicely sweet. The beer ends very dry with the pleasant taste of the wood. Pretty chewy mouthfeel but not as thick as bells expedition for example. medium carbonation. i used this beer as chaser for some speyside scotch i dont think there could have been a better pairing. one of DFH's best."
"I am very happy they have a lot invested in the regular production of this beer. I will buy it frequently and serve it to others with confidence."
"It is very, very strong. I could not emagine having more than one. It was nice to try a creative beer such as this."
"I would likely not buy this one again, not that it is bad, just not for me."
"This is definitely one of the finer wood-aged beers that I've had. I can't help but wonder what other beers could gain from some time against this type of wood. The simplicity of the beer, and complete extravagance of production make this an excellent buy and one to remember."
"Taste reminds me of an is RIS from the get go, guess that's the ABV talking as this is an extreme Brown Ale. Not as sweet or chocolatey as an RIS however, instead offering more subtle flavors of raisin and dried cherry with complex malt undertones. This might be interesting with some Belgian yeast thrown into the mix, hint, hint. Smooth feel and drinks easier than most beers of this weight, yet there are few beers of this weight."
"Pours deep brown with a small tan head. Some lacing on the surface. Aroma has notes of chocolate and wood with a hint of alcohol. Taste is very rich and chocolaty. Sweet but not too much so. Again there is a definite wood note- obviously from the aging. Some nice earthy herbal hops in the finish along with a bit of warming alcohol. Tasty, well balanced, smooth and very very good. Full bodied. Very drinkable for the strength. A unique and excellent beer."
"Wow. A lot of heat and sugary syrup in this one. One to be re-evaluated in the future after it gains some age."
"Date consumed: 24 July 2008"
"D - This is sipper for sure b/c of the high ABV. It is mighty tasty... my ears are strangely warm."
"T/M: Very smooth, thick body with strong carbonation. Strong alcohol presence, but lacks burn, just a warming presence as you finish the bottle. Flavor isn't overly complex, but very rich. Strong alcohol presence and body has prominent flavors from the wood, light dark fruit flavors providing a little bitterness, some vanilla and light roasted malt. When you let it warm up and sit in the mouth a stronger nuttiness and almost spicy, hot peppery flavor starts to come through. Very nicely balanced, and alcohol is certainly present at 12% but not overwhelming. Comparing this to traditional brown ales is kind of pointless. Another interesting, unique beer from DFH, but not one I'm motivated to seek out at this price frequently."
"D - for the amount of alcohol, its not too bad at all...don't see myself having more than a few in a night but nonetheless its damn good"
"D: Not really sessionable, but I wanted more after finishing it."
"Pours an extremely dark black brown colored body, tan colored head, somewhat lasting. Alcoholy aroma, dark fruit like plum and raisin. Very strong aroma. Coffee aroma too, wood and toffee. Sweet spiciness. Coffee taste with a strong roasted coffee aftertaste. A little alcohol, wood and roasted flavor, some chocolately sweetness."
"Seriously viscous pour with a think dark tan head that fades quickly. Delicious smell of alcohol, alcohol soaked dates or figs and molasses. Dark malty think mouth feel, yet a clean finish with touch of alcohol. Molasses and chocolate malt flavors with a touch of the alcohol soaked dates or figs. This is an amazing beer. It seems described best as similar to a Russian Imperial Stout but without any of the bitterness or sharpness. Whatever that ""4500 on the Janka scale"" Palo Santo wood did to this beer, it was well done. I look forward to what those giant beer barrels help produce next."
"Overall this is a fine beer. It's very drinkable, considering the 12 percent alcohol level. I bet this could sneak up on you, though. Well worth trying, though a little expensive for regular drinking."
"my wife even commented on the smell being like 'that stuff i used to drink from those blue bottles"" - and hey, i liked sipping the satb- this tastes more like a beer, though-and a tasty beer it is - better warmer than colder - nice flavor complexity - good stuff here."
"Taste is delicious, pretty intense and full bodied. Lots of sweet malt and molasses, some roastiness and dark fruit on the aftertaste. Heavy yet slippery mouthfeel, if anything it's slightly too soda-like in the carbonation, but that doesn't take much at all away from the overall flavor. Strong at 12%, but pretty well-hidden and smooth. I think the Palo Santo wood aging has something to do with the smoothness of this brew. But as for woody flavors I'm not detecting a whole lot. There's some spiciness though. This beer is really an Imperial Brown Ale, which makes it pretty darn close to an imperial stout, though I guess not as roasty or bitter. All in all a great Dogfish brew."
"D- Outstanding, this may be next on my home draft list, for the ABV and the intensity this brew is exremely drinkable, this is the best from DFH that i have had to date.."
"Another great beer from Dog Fish Head. I look forward to what they come out with next."
"Less than a finger of head when poured into a Duchesse goblet. Tan foam that recedes slowly, and leaves a ring. Lactic aroma with some banana ester from the yeast, and slightly roasty. Reminds me of a Bells stout. Rich, creamy feel, earthy roast and lactic taste. Not getting much of the advertised wood-aging. Abv is well disguised. Similar to Bells Kalamazoo Stout or Double Cream. Good, but not worth paying a premium for."
"The alcohol is a bit much so you have to take this one pretty slow."
"In addition to the vanilla, I would think that the wood imparts a subtle smokiness that really helps to round out the flavors, holding it all together through the drink and then following for a number of minutes. Probably the best brown I've ever had, though not my favorite style."
"Overall I'd heard a lot of good things about this beer, and it certainly did not let me down. Be sure to give this one a shot."
"Drinkability is good as I will buy again bad as wouldn't have too many at once. Defiantly worth hunting some down to try though."
"Quite a complex beer, to be as thick as it is, it's quite drinkable. Still complex is the best way to describe this one, well worth a try."
"D: Very good. 12 percent, kind of tough to justify another one, but almost have to. Most definitely an extreme brown ale."
"Much more a stout than a brown ale. Notes of molasses, wood, caramel, apple, and a bit of heat from the alcohol on the finish. A fine winter beer. Poured black and oily from the bottle. thin head. Finely carbonated. Abundant flavors, with plenty of sweet that is nicely balanced by the hot bitter finish. A very nice beer, but one is enough."
"I doubt that I'll give very many 5's (especially to domestics) but I wish there was a higher score available for this."
"Of course, we all know about the specialized wooden tanks that are used in the brewing process; certainly much logistics in the process, but worth it. While I would never consider this to be a daily session beer (way too much complexity), it is one I would break out for special occasions."
"One is plenty of these, and I doubt I would buy it again, but it is a complex, interesting beer with a good story."
"A dark mahogany pour with a tight tan head. Lacing and retention struggle to survive the high abv. Rich smell of raisins, malts cherries and rum. As the beer begins to warm, caramel, chocolate, rum and raisins come alive in the flavor. Tastes very similar to a RIS, but is lighter and more fruity. The mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy and smooth. For a 12% abv, this feels very tame. A masterpiece from DFH. Could be their best."
"Last quater of the brew was a drain pour=("
"9/4/8/3/16 (4.0/5)"
"Great beer, I will enjoy this again regardless of the high price. 5"
"I'd love to age some."
"WOW!"
"As I continue to drink it, I'm impressed by its substantial body. But it's got no hard malt bite to it. Just a big soft body...okay, that sounds funny."
"This is an exceptional brew, the complexities are amazing and only increase as the beer warms. I think the last sip is the best in the bottle. It makes me want to open another immediately but at 12% I might wait a couple minutes."
"Whoa! So strong and tasty, but alcohol is well hidden. I would love to sip on more of these!"
"poured black w/some dark brown when held to the light into a DFH goblet. clear. minimal light brown head. nose was raisins, molasses, cocoa, roasted nuts, and aged rum. taste follows suit with big malt sweetness dominating. minimal hop presence yet somehow manages not to be too cloying. warming alcohol in the finish. mouthfeel is hugely thick and viscous. very lightly carbonated. smooth, lingering finish. this would make a fine pairing with a big, meaty cigar. definitely a sipper, a bit much boozy alcohol and slick for me."
"The taste resembles a local porter that I enjoy with some coffee aftertaste and plenty of awesome. A larger pull from my glass punishes me with a little bit of an alcohol taste, but I'm not complaining. I'd definitely recommend it to a dark beer lover."
"Are you gonna finish yours?"
"Solid brown pour, just a tiny bit of brown head rose up. Not much in the nose of this one, after it warmed a little, slight roasted caramel/nut/whisky barrel. Pretty malty, but not too much so. Roasted, slightly sweet nuttiness going down. Warmed me up, but the alcohol was not apparent at all. Pretty darn good. I'm cellaring 2 of the bottles, curious to see what happens."
"Finally found this beer at the local liquor store, snatched it up quickly and made my exit. Been looking for this for a while. The pour... Holy crap, this stuff is darker than I first thought- pours like motor oil as the aroma fills the room. Dark, solid black with a thin head- one of the darkest brown heads I've yet seen on a beer. Leaves a nice lacing down the glass that dissipates over time. First smell, so many different notes that I have to take multiple sniffs. Aroma is of roasted coffee, vanilla beans, ginger, lots of wood, nuts. With a scent like this I can't wait to taste it. First sip... very malty, a bit sour, lots of brown ale taste and some toastiness of a porter in there as well. Sweet notes, and a lot of spicy ground pepper feel on the finish that leaves the mouth a bit tingly. This is a fantastic experience. Going in depth with the flavors... Lots of sweet ginger, toasted woody malt, roasted coffee, chocolate, some hop bitterness there as well as I get acquainted with this beer... Fruit notes- plum, raisin, other dark fruits that I can't quite put my finger on. There is so much to talk about, this is by far the most complex beer I've ever had. The kicker for me is the spicy finish along with the severe alcohol warming effect without any semblence of an alcohol bite whatsoever even at 13% ABV. This is a superb, perfectly made beer. I have yet to try one better and it will probably be some time until I will. This beer is as close to perfect as I've ever tasted. I can't gush enough about this beer."
"As a dark beer fan, this one was right up my alley. Dark hue like a stout, flavors similar to a coffeehouse porter, but more mysterious. Every sip was a new adventure in taste. The 12% ABV put me to sleep, but I had sweet dreams, like visions of sugar plums dancing in my head."
"Pours a dark black/cola brown with a creamy head. It was almost like a blend of a brown ale and an imperial stout. The aroma was of coffee, slight chocolate, a woody earthiness, and very strong alcohol. The more I drink DFH beers, the more I realize I have a problem with them when they go above 9% ABV. To me and the other person I split the 4 pack with, the booze was not hidden very well. The mouthfeel was nice and thick. Drinkability for me, was low."
"D: Sessionability at 12% ABV is questionable, but this is still a good beer. When I had this on tap at the 2007 Extreme Beer Fest, my girlfriend and I both felt this beer won the night. In the bottle and mass produced though, it seems to have fallen a bit."
"Very tasty, but definitely a one bottle sipper."
"poured into a conical pint. nearly black appearance with a faint brownish head, which dissipated quickly but not completely. smells of malt and earth, alcohol comes through even at cooler temperature, nearly overwhelms once its warmed. taste is big on sweet malt, followed by wood and stone fruit. mouthfeel is amazing, rich and silky, if this beer was at 7 or 8% abv it could be a favorite, but the high alcohol does take away from overall drinkability."
"This one is strong, malty and high alcohol; it's definitely a sipping beer, and isn't meant to be sessioned. Overall I found it very enjoyable. The Palo Santo gave the beer a woodiness that was distinct from other barrel aged beers that I've had before. If you can get your hands on a bottle give it a try. I'll probably pick up a couple more bottles to see how this one does in the cellar."
"This was very complex and tasty. It might benefit ffrom 12 months in the cellar."
"The head disappeared very quickly leaving no head almost instantly. The smell is coffee, caramel, chocolate, slight wood and alcohol. The flavor was very heavy coffee upfront, with hints of brown sugar, finishing with light smoke and oak. Mouthfeel is full bodied with out being to gummy. With the high alcohol content of this beer, drinkability in my mind is maybe one snifter at a session."
"This brew pours up very dark brown with a small chocolate colored head that disappeared in a matter of seconds. the nose is big malts, subtle chocolate, spices, some alcohol spice, wood. Wow. A very different beer.... I taste earth, wood, lots of spice, malts, very dry, full bodied, medium to heavy spritzy carbo. Not a bad beer. Just different..."
"Drinkability is very high. This tasted great and went down very smooth."
"This beer arrived at my table with a thin brown collar and a skim of fine bubbles coating the top. It was very dark brown with faint edges and put a lot of fine lacing on the glass. The aroma was quite fruity, lots of fig and prune with a bit of red wine, roasted malt, chocolate and toffee, plus a bit of vanilla. Sturdy bitterness yet still balanced towards sweetness with lots of dried fruit and toffee throughout. Quite rich overall. Nicely integrated wood and tannin character. It finished with dark chocolate and alcohol. Full bodied, a bit heavy, with lowish carbonation and mild warmth. Very smooth with fine bubbles giving it a pleasant texture. Pretty tasty stuff and I'd have never guess the abv based solely on the beer in my glass. Knowing DFH, this shouldn't have been a surprise."
"Drinkability is hurt by the overt booziness and lack of nuance. This was painful for me to finish even a 12 oz bottle, by the last 1/2 it was really burning me up, I could feel it from the tip of my tongue to the bottom of my belly. I'm sure tomorrow morning will be real fun! Maybe I'll get one or two for long term cellar, just to see if it softens up enough after 2-3 years, but I'm unimpressed enough that I'm in no hurry to do so."
"Tap @ O'Brien's. Pours black with red highlights. No head. Aroma of chocolate, vanilla, wood, and earth. Flat mouthfeel. More wood and earth in the flavor, but a very nice malt backbone, carob, and some smoke make this very pleasant. Definitely a sipper."
"12% and it's fairly easy to drink. So be careful. A great twist on the American Brown Ale style. There's a lot going on in this beer."
"Overall: pretty interesting and unique, but drifts almost into the realm of imperial Stouts. Not as unique as I was expecting, and is pretty off style for an American Brown Ale (although that is to be expected from DFH)."
"Many of these ratings started off lower, but as I picked apart the aspects of this beer, I realized that I could not in good conscience rate some of them less than perfect. This beer surprised and amazed me very much. I highly recommend it to everyone. Get your hands on this crazy thing."
"This is simply one of the most unique beers I have ever consumed. I'm honestly still not sure if I think it is really good or merely above average. I am going to give it the benefit of the doubt for now simply because it is so unique and I think must be tried by beer lovers. It give a new meaning to beer!"
"Overall I liked this beer and would drink it again, but wouldn't want to invest in a whole 4-pack on an often basis."
"Cheers to Dogfish for a truly mind-bending beer unlike anything I've ever had!"
"This beer stands up pretty well, I'd go for it again."
"Drinkability: Low at first, but it improved as the beer warmed up. This was a great beer to pair with turkey and stuffing, and most definitely a sipping beer."
"Overall: Really unlike anything else. I gave it a half point for originality. I very much enjoyed this beer, and I look forward to seeing what a couple of years in the cellar will do for it."
"Can only drink one of these bad boys."
"From a 12 oz bottle this poured a rich motor oil black with a moderate brown head and thick gluey lacing. Big nose of ripe fruit, oak, alcohol and raisins. Very rich and creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is very rich is well with molasses, vanilla added to what was in the nose. Dry finish. Very drinkable. Simply fantastic stuff. Glad I have three more."
"Great twist on this brew by DFH. Very enjoyable, quite drinkable for the abv."
"Great example of wood ageing, a must try!"
"Overall: a dud as far as beers go. If I wanted something that can only be described as ""Wine Syrup," I wouldn't look for it in a beer. Not sure what the brewer was trying to do with this one."
"This brew pours dark brown (nearly black) with a medium thin and fizzy light brown head that recedes quickly. Spotty lacing. Lots of roasted malt in the aroma, along with plum, oak and alcohol. Rich body with flavors of burnt malt, hops, toasted bread and dark fruits. Alcohol is present but not overpowering. The finish is oaky and leaves a lingering malt and liqueur aftertaste. Very good from start to finish."
"D - This one is too sweet for me. Luckily it was a small pour so I'll be moving on soon."
"D - Good but not something I would seek out again. Might get better with age. Interesting as a desert beer. Also reminds me a little of fort which isn't really a good thing."
"Not as thick as the taste and aroma would suggest. Pretty drinkable for 12%"
"Once again, I'm very impressed by DFH's desire to push the envelop and try different things."
"Okay. Drinkability. What does that mean??? Does that mean I can drink seven of these? Or is it, ""I love this beer so freaking much and want to tell everyone about it and its crazy story?"" If it's the latter, we got perfect ""drinkability."" If the former, you will die of alcohol poisoning. Cheers."
"Served in a Tall sniffer glass, it revealed itself as a trully dark brown liquid. carbonnation appears to be small as practically no head formed. The thin lace of yellow/brownish lace of foam that was formed disappeared quickly. Despite that this beer is aged in/on wood, no nose of wood at first glance as expected. Leaving it aside for a couple of minutes, a very faint nose of wood came up. Really complex nose of caramel, vanilla and coffee developed. The high alcool content of this beer betrayed by it's fruity smell and not by it's mouthfeel! So bewared, because it is still very drinkable. a roasted grain, faint wood, chocolate and coffee after taste persist quite a long time. A complexe beer that have many many subtilities and flavor. Should be drink not too cold, around 10-12 oC. Ageing would be a plus."
"Once again, Dogfish Head prevails in the category of extreme beer. Well worth the purchase."
"Palo Santo Maron is truly an outstanding brew. It is definitely a ""must try"" if you are a fan of sweeter and/or woody/oaky extreme-style beers. Dare I say this is Dogfish Head's most impressive release to date?"
"I look forward to the next offering from DFH."
"The only thing keeping the drinkability down for me is the ABV. That being said, ""drinkability"" could mean how often would I drink this beer, as opposed to how many would I drink in a single session. The latter would be low, maybe 1 or 2. But as to how often, well, just as often as I can, so I'm going to rate this a bit higher than I normally would. Semantics maybe, but I'm very impressed by this beer. I have never found a Brown Ale I even kind of liked until today. This is just an amazing beer. I'm going to cellar some, and try to knock of some of that alcohol bite, and enjoy this for a long time. Cheers!"
"im just kinda branching out to brown ales, and I will check it out another time"
"A: Dark brown to black, espresso like foam, opaque - 4.50, S: Fusil alcohol that gives it an almost solvent-like smell, sweet and heavy on the grains which is really an afterthought given all the alcohol, as it warms more of the beer-like qualities start to come through - 3.75, T: Reminds me of a sweetened espresso, the wood is noticeable and adds a nice element, some overly ripe heavy fruits, reminds me of prunes in a way - 4.50, M: Exceptionally smooth and quite heavy - 4.50, D: Dogfish Head is almost always a brewery I can count on and this beer fits that mold, extremely flavorful, a standout Brown Ale - 4.50"
"D - Very Drinkable. This is the type of beer I want to keep and age forever!"
"I'd get it again, it is pricey though (only got one bottle , not the 4 pack)"
"D- Very drinkable but a sipper for sure. Major complaint is that is rather expensive. Oh well, I'd drink this all day if I could."
"D: As this beer warms, it becomes extremely drinkable. I'm not sure that it is representative of an American Brown Ale - could be closer to an English Barleywine....regardless, it is tasty."
"Notes: To be honest, there was a time when I thought DFH was absolutely awesome. I still love their 60 and 90 minute IPAs and their Indian Brown Ale, but their experimental stuff I've had in recent years didn't do it for me. This I like, however. I've accidentally aged their Indian Brown Ale and in some ways this reminds me of the result of that -- port-like with dark and dried fruits. But this has even more going on, all in a 12% ale. Worth checking out, even at the advanced prices (I bought a single bottle myself, but in hindsight wouldn't be kicking myself had I shelled out for the 4-pack)."
"Dessert beer."
"D- Dogfish high alc. pretty drinkable but then my other perspective is that I also had a Surly Bender last night. THAT is a very drinkable brown ale. The marron is of course a different type of brown so I'll give it a pass."
"Not a beer I would buy often, but I like it as a single in a mix sixer."
"M&D - as long as you can get past the up front alcohol bite, its pretty smooth and quite refreshing, a nice mix of flavors, and a strange flavor lended by the wood its aged on"
"Well worth the $15.00/4pack. Great stuff!!"
"I'm not sure I'd even call this one a sipper except that it's so strong that sipping is necessary. Really quite drinkable for the strength, and very complex and tasty. I'm glad I finally picked a bottle of this up."
"Pours an impenetrable jet black with about a 1/4"" of brown head that lingers briefly, really looks more like a stout than a brown ale. I'm just going to stop reviewing this strictly as a brown ale right now and base my rating of this mostly on my enjoyment of this brew. The aroma is complex, unique and wonderful. A deep, perfumey alcohol character is what I detect first but vanilla and an assortment of spices are very prominent. There is also a distinct caramel sweetness and a heavy dose of vinous fruits. There is also a very unique character that I assume must come from the time spent in the Palo Santo wood vessels. Taste is fairly sweet. Healthy doses of caramel and molasses that dominate throughout are complimented by a more moderate vinous character and relatively restrained spice flavors. Theres lots of booze in the taste too. It's not overwhelming but is noticeable and an important flavor component. Very full bodied, slightly syrupy, quite sweet. Carbonation is moderate and alcohol presence is strong and warming. Drinkability is a bit above average. I don't really know that I need a whole 12 oz.of this brew. That being said this beer was still incredibly complex and enjoyable. The aroma on this brew was unique and enticing. In my opinion this is worth a try and best split with a friend."
"Decent mouthfeel, perhaps a little undercarbonated. I didn't realize this was 12% when I started drinking it."
"was VERY surprised by this beer. although I don't know why, as DFH does that quite often with most of their beers. very nice - almost in the stout category. well done."
"D - Very, very smooth, rich beer. No idea what the wood actually contributes, but on the whole a fantastic flavour."
"Good and enjoyable, if not complex. Quite easy to drink for the ABV."
"Drinkability: I didn't like this beer as much as a lot of people seem too, but it wasn't bad. I wasn't crazy about the taste, and I hate having a beer in my mouth that starts to burn like I just chugged a glass of ginger ale. Overall its not bad, and if you're into this kind of beer you might want to check it out. Just don't expect anything mellow."
"D: Well, this beer certainly packs a punch. Lots of depth of flavour and aquite an alcoholic bite. I don't think I would ever want to drink more than one of these. And that's a good thing because this one should be sipped slowly and savoured. Its expensive, yes, but, I plan on working through this 4-pack slowly; only reaching for one on a special occasion. I look forward to sipping on one on a cold Christmas night in front of the fire."
"Drinkability - While it was certainly not the greatest wood aged beer, it is worth trying because it has some interesting characters probably due to the special wood that was used."
"If you like IPA's or Guinness, this is not your beer! On the other hand, if you like Celebrator, give this a shot, You will love it!"
"Pours a very dark brown color, almost black. A thin creamy tan cap dissolves to a bubbly ring. Bold, rich aroma...fruity, wooden alcohol dominates at first before giving way to the more ""desert-like"" qualities. Sweet chocolate, vanilla, and berries along with raisins and spices. The flavor starts out surprisingly chocolaty, not as boozy as I would have expected. Smooth sweet vanilla and wood, light coffee...increasing cherry and purpley fruit esters. Definitely a sipper, but it hides it's hefty ABV well. The longer it sits in the mouth, the more chocolate comes out. Creamy but not heavy. Mmmm...wow, let it warm up for a while and it's a delicious, chocolaty, malty treat. Despite what it looks like on paper, it's not completely overdone. I like that."
"Definitely like this beer and recommend it to all to explore."
"Intense aromas of wood, alcohol, dark fruit and malt sting the nose. Opaque pour with dark tan head and some lacing. Creamy, hot and complex. Lots of wood, but not in an unpleasant manner. This has a lot to say, and I am all ears. Seek one out."
"Notes: This is more of a strong ale then a brown."
"As the beer warms the alcohol becomes less apparent and easier to drink with moderate carbonation and a nice creaminess to it. I think this beer should labeled as American Imperial Brown Ale."
"D: This beer is good but it is really thick and high on the ABV. It doesn't go down to easy and you really want to sip this sucka. Don't get too crazy with it because I am sure this will catch up with. A good late night brew that can warm you up and wind you down. Just what I needed."
"Nevertheless, I plan to revisit the Palo Santo Marron experience without hesitation."
"this is one of the most unique beer that i have ever tasted. The color is black with a tan head. I drank this out of a snifter. The aroma is of coffee,toffee,weird oaky kind of smell. Nice legs like a port. This had a rich flavor. The best brown ale ive ever had. It is sweet with a strong malt bitterness. A slight presence of alcohol but it gets better as it warms. Sweet and syrupy on the mouthfeel. good drinkability, id want to sit around a fire drinking this beer all night."
"pours very much like an imperial stout. in fact I had a rogue RIS right next to this and they look exactly the same. dense black with tan head that never got thinner than a quarter. nice rich slighty malty with a mild sweetness to it. well balanced and a very good aftertaste."
"D - Good. Searching for a cigar right now. Surprised alcohol not more present in a 12.0"
"Poured from bottle to pint glass black with reddish hues and a minimal ruby cream head that diminished quickly with no lacing. Smelled of berries, red wine and alcohol. Taste was a strong alcohol and berry with a sweet tart finish. Almost like a bubbly Merlot very highly carbonated. I was glad to try this but it is not my thing. I would not have another as this is not something I could enjoy more than one of. Leaves me with a very warm alcohol feeling and a nice buzz."
"A big Brown Ale with some unique flavors; namely: vanilla and licorice. While this offering is a treat, at 12% abv drinkability is somewhat compromised."
"I like the mild woodiness, but I'd rather see it in something a little less intense, where it can present itself properly. Although it's a hefty 12%, it drinks like something just shy of 20%. The booze really kills this one, and the sweetness gets to be a bit much halfway through. If you're looking for something in the 12% abv range to close out an evening, I can immediately think of a half dozen that are far more easy going."
"D- too boozy and potent to have more than one of. a very interesting beer that i look forward to seeing how it changes. one bottle of this is plenty."
"D: The alcohol really kills any shot you've got at drinking a bunch of these."
"Out of the bottle this unfiltered brown ale was a deep, dark, nearly porter colored brown that actually let no light pass through it. The head was also a woody brown, one-finger-thick cap of tight bubbles that retained well and laced in a pattern like torn curtains. The aroma was robust and rich, roasted malt, hints of wood and spices, alcohol esters, toffee and brown sugar too. Very complex on the palate as well living up to the aroma; caramel, vanilla and toffee sweetness first hit my tongue followed closely by the Palo Santo wood flavor, some alcohol heat and some hints of charcoal fading into coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Nicely balanced and impressive in new ways as it warmed up. For a beer as potent as this one was I was amazed how approachable it was. The mouthfeel was exceptionally creamy and smooth with a light carbonation of the medium to full body. An exceptional and unique beer and very drinkable for 12% (!) making it well worth seeking out."
"I had this beer poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Great pour, not much carbonation at all, nice medium body. Exceptional smell. Hits you on the back of the thought. Woody, bourbons, Smokey, nice warm alcohol taste. This beer is a winner. I paid $13.00/4 pack after deposit. Worth it all day long if you like beer. In a dogfish head world, I think this one is my favorite."
"Aroma on opening sends forth a nice smoky woody note...interestingly, woodiness receded after pouring and there was really only a hint of smoke among the other layers of aromas an flavors. Roasted caramel malt, some coffee and chocolate notes, rich creamy mouthfeel. 12% ABV surprisingly drinkable. Definitely a rich beer to savor after dinner, better at warmer temp. Not as complex as many Imperial Stouts but quite good."
"MF&D - Thick and syrupy. Strong Imperial Stout feel. If you like BIG BEERS, give this one a try."
"Overall impression: A big, well balanced, well crafted wood-aged ale. Too big and dark for a brown. More like a robust porter bodering on imperial stout. Nobody does big, extreme beers like Sam C! Nicely done."
"Very black in color, similar to a fine stout with very little head. Very complex smell of cinnamon, vanilla, alcohol and perhaps some nuts as well. Taste is very warming with vanilla, caramel, molasses, and brown sugar. Overall a good, complex brew, but a bit too warming."
"Different than anything I have had before. Kudos Dogfish Head and Sam Caliglione (sp?) for pushing the limits."
"D - Despite the high ABV, this is a fairly easy-drinking beer. One of the more unique brown ales that I've ever had."
"Never had this and did not know what to expect. Nice Surprise."
"Put this in a bomber, drip some wax on the top, and limit production, and this would be a top 25 beer to a lot of people. Pitch brown in color (not pitch black, if you look around the edges in the light), head completely dissipates after a while. The smell and taste are really unique. Bourbon, smoke, sugar, and a bunch of stuff that isn't easy to put in words. You can definitely taste the wood in this one. I guess it's not oak, but the Uruguayan wood used to age this. Very boozy, the alcohol is hot, but I don't care. Really awesome stuff overall."
"Great beer. Good warmer for the upcoming holidays."
"D: Like I said earlier, its very good, but one's enough for an evening."
"D - At this ABV, I switch from my ""would I have another?"" mode to my ""how long am I going to want to milk this beer for so it doesn't go away?"" mode. The answer? All night long. It's 9:00 PM, and I don't think I want to take my last sip until about 11:00 PM. Dogfish Head is hit or miss for me, and this one is definitely a hit, despite its hefty price tag of about $16 a four-pack."
"Vanilla waffers with some boozy barrel wood,has a borbon like taste and strong bitter chocolate tastes with mocha/coffee has a very dry woody/sawdust-like finish. Lots of complexity at the finish,surprizingly light with a bit of a cloying chewyness.Interesting beer,not a beer i would drink a lot of,yet still very enjoyable."
"D: Had this a few times prior to trying it again for this review. Drinks like a brown ale but is strong and thick like an imperial stout. This brewery always comes through with something impressive. Doom Metal + Dogfish Head = Score."
"O: Very good, very impressed, probably wont buy again for sometime seeing it was $15 a 4 pack."
"Overall, pick this up if you see it. It's certainly unique and expected from Dogfish Head (not that's a bad thing)."
"Not a beer I would drink mor than one of in a sitting. Heavy alcohol and a bit filling, yet I still wanted more."
"Drinkability is pretty high for this one. Could use some mellowing from a cellar but as long as you sip it slowly, it's a nice hybrid of a brown ale and stout in my opinion. I definitely plan on buying more to age."
"This was the highlight of my trip to the DFH brew pub. Real nice to sip as I sat and watched the world go by."
"Pours from the 12 oz bottle a deep, dark, thick. almost syrupy-looking dark brown (almost black) with a small, light tan colored head that dissipates quickly into patchy lacing. The aroma is smoky, woody, and boozy! 1st sip reveals a LOT going on! Malt, wood, coffee, dark fruit, a tinge of vanilla extract, and yes, alcohol. The mouthfeel is roust, but silky & creamy all at the same time. Overall...WOW!! This isn't a beer, this is a sensory experience!! I got the last 4pak on the shelves and I put one up to age. I'm gonna have to go get more!! I can't wait to see what a year of aging does to this baby!! Note to Anheuser-Busch: forget the Beechwood, start aging Budweiser on some Palo Santo blocks!!"
"This beer could have tricked me as an adventurous imperial stout. Mine poured a dark brown with almost red wine edges. No head, even with a rough pour. The smell was strong of black cherry and alcohol/cough medicine. To be honest, this taste was a little bit like cough medicine as well. Some currant maybe, cherry, little bit of smoke undertones. The mouthfeel was a bit like syrup. A bit of alcohol burn. Not a very drinkable brew."
"Overall: An outstanding offering from DFH, really pushing the envelope of the ""brown ale"" style with lots of complexity, flavor, and plenty of alcohol oomph. Definitely recommended."
"I really wanted to like this beer. It is truly unique, but it isnt quite right. A near miss by Dogfish Head, but definitely worth a try."
"I liked this one. It's certainly a twist on the traditional brown ale, and a nice one at that. Would I drink it often? No, but I'd definitely revisit it and gladly drink it again. It makes for a very nice sipper on a relaxing evening. An easy recommendation."
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavors are fine, and although the alcohol is high and apparent, it seems fitting. Not awesome, but not bad either. I dig it. I'd like to rate higher, but it's difficult when viewed in terms of brown ale. There's really no designation for a barrel aged Imp Brown ale, which is basically what this would be."
"The feel thick and chewy -- and outstanding. It's a burn at first, and then a cooldown. I'll tell ya, this is one challenging beer. Really strong and ruthlessly thick, but extremely balanced: brutally burnt and yet smoothly sweet."
"Drinkability- Easy to drink and flavorful. Went well with the homeade meat loaf I had for dinner."
"The aroma is full of molasses with a bit of dark chocolate. he flavor has more of the chocolate (reminds me of 65% cocoa) and wood, I guess I can't call it oak, but its kind of like oak but earthier. There's also a little fig and allspice, clove, and pepper. The body is medium thickness, relatively light for a 12% brew, and pretty drinkable, albeit a sipper. And though its not the most complex brew, its something different and certainly worth trying."
"Man, I love this brew. One of my personal favorites for a sipping beer. Wonderful warmer on a chilly night. Well worth the high price tag."
"Drinkability: Entirely doesn't show its 12% despite its monster status. Approach with caution, but this is well worth drinking one or two."
"True to its name, there's no question this is all about the wood it's aged in. At points, it's almost as though I was chewing on aromatic twigs, and that's in no way a bad thing, at least not in this instance. The ABV and sweetness present a bold face combined, but the uniqueness helps it to flow ably. I'm not sure what Sam has up his sleeve next, but I'm glad I finally got ahold of this one."
"12oz bottle. Reviewed at home. Review from notes. This one is a dark chocolate brown with a small/thin head of tan foam. It looks good. Aromas are all sweet sugary alcohol and sweet candy coated malts. Faint green hop oils are in the back of it all. Taste is sugary candy syrup sweet and extremely one dimensional. Not bad but not impressive. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit cloying with all of the sweetness. It makes me weant to scrape my tongue. Still the drinkability is not bad as it is one dimensional sweet and boozy. Really, not bad at all...just not my bag"
"Drinkability - For how high its ABV it is a very easy to drink beer. this is one every one should at least try once."
"Drinkability is good but this is a sipping beer, not designed for mass quantities!!! Very tasty. I would like some more of this one"
"D - One serving in a night is all you want. Still, pretty special stuff....and take it from me - these massive dark beers aren't even really my thing. It's difficult to not be a big fan of this, though. A 4-pack will set you back some $$$, but it's worth it."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into an oversized chalice. The beer pours a dark black with a thin brown head. There are red highlights and there ain't no light getting through this brew. The smell of this is somewhat woody with chocalate and vanilla notes. The taste follows the nose. This beer is wonderfully complex. The body is medium to heavy, mdoerate carbonation. This beer drinks remarkably well considerating its 12% abv. This is a great beer! It is a bit pricey($12 a 4 pack) but it is worth it."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black with a thin tan head that dissipates quickly. Looks very stout-like. Aroma is filled with caramel and chocolates, a bit of vanilla and oak-like flavor, some alcohol it there too. Tastes wonderful! Lots of roast and dark fruits, vanilla, more wood flavors and alcohol burn in the finish. Very creamy in the mouth. Thick and full bodied. Light carbonation. This a damn fine brew, but I'm not sure I'd label it a brown. Defiantly not what I was expecting, but great nonetheless."
"a murky opaque brown with a small tan head. smell of alcohol, oak, toffee and caramel, a light coffee, and esters. the taste is thick and goes down warm. very woody. dark fruit and alcohol blend to give a port like consistence. caramel, oak, malt, and hop blend well. opens up as it gets warmer. light cocoa and chocolate in malt. one of their best. i couldn't drink more than one if i tried. not made for a hot day. great beer. but not a regular for me."
"Don't drink and review."
"This is a Brown ale like I've never seen. It pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a 1/4 inch tan head. Aroma is of coffee, roasted malt and charred wood. Taste is exquisite and rich. Lots of coffee flavors, wood, ripe fruit and plum. Alcohol is there, but not overly so. A full bodied mouthfeel along with the rich taste makes me wish I'd held onto this bottle until winter. Very well done beer and one that I'll be seeking out more often."
"Drinkability- Terrific. The abv demands respectful sipping, yet this brew had the potential to go down like a session stout (but don't-if you gulp it you'll miss out on the complexity that slow sipping will reward)."
"Murky opaque brown with minimal head. Nose- very fruity- plums, raisins, figs, vanillla. Taste- same fruits in the taste along with roasted coffee, sweet fruit cake malts, some chocolate and a little booze heat to tickle the nose. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Wood shows itself more in the finish helping to dry out this malt monster"
"brown ale on roids. looks more like a porter than a brown ale. a ginger of head that faded wuickly but left decent lacing. smells like dates and prunes with strong candy sugar as well. taste is malty and sweet, with some vanilla and a little bitterness in the finish, as well as a pretty good kick from the alcohol. very rich and almost creamy mouthfeel. not bad drinkability for such a strong brew, but i think i'd like this more if they could lower the price a touch and sell it in an 8oz bottle, perfect for pouring into a nice snifter."
"Notes: This beer is uber-complex on the palate, and it feels like it's harmonious although somewhat random. All of the flavors are competing for center-stage, but it's not disjointed. It's like they all share the limelight and take their proper turns. This is perhaps the most complex beer I've ever tasted and I'm Wow-ed by it. Two pints way up!"
"Well done Sam. Always keeping it interesting at Dogfish Head."
"Interesting? Yes. Enjoyable? Yes. Remarkable? No. I'd much rather have an ImmortAle or World Wide Stout for the price."
"D- So expensive but i love it."
"12 ounce bottle...pours a deep, deep brown/maroon...very little head...but with high abv totally understandable. Smeel is rich and deep...molasses, malt other subleties. Taste is super rich with malt, molasses, cognac, port wine and very understated alcohol...absolutely great. Mouthfeel is likewise outstanding with a smoot hrichness much like that you would get in a deep smooth black forest cake. Extremely drinkable..dangerously so...hard to imagine it is 12 abv. The best brew I've had recently."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, appearance is almost a black, opaque dark brown with a full two fingers of tan head that exhibit great retention. Aroma is sweet, malt and wood characterize the nose, rounded out by some dark dried fruit and caramel/toffee undertones. Taste is syrup-sweet, smoky wood flavor, chocolate and caramel, pipe tobacco caramel malt, earthy grain undertones. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, makes a light syrupy mouthfeel that goes down slow and smooth. Finishes slightly bitter and sweet, light drying effect once the coating it leaves on the tongue subsides. Drinkability is great, hides 12% abv like it was only 4%, dark and malty, wood flavors come and go with every sip. Highly recommend, would seek out again."
"D: Pretty drinkable considering the high gravity of the beer and the intensity of the flavors mixed together."
"Thanks. I am grateful. The calamari was great, and I dig the banana peppers. Its my birthday, and I celebrate it with Theobroma's predecessor. Complex and enjoyed in private rather than at monitor. Dogfish is in the lead. Has been before; is now and I believe the future. Chocolate syrup, vanilla, breath of hops. A derosion of thought within every sip. Intense, and once again, to be respected. Rather an imperial stout than a hispanic wood age. A gorgeous sight and a gracious surprise."
"Looking for something along the lines of a slow drinkable I stumbled across this gem upon the advice of the storeowner of Wine Palace in West Bridgewater, MA. It's an unfiltered brown ale that the brewers at Dogfish Head age in handmade wooden brewing vessels. Right away you notice distinct caramel and vanilla. Dogfish Head says that's partly attributable to the exotic Paraguayan Palo Santo wood that the brewing vessels are made from. The beer is as dark as they come; there's no light getting through this one. It's not burnt or heavy in any way, but rather the highly roasty and malty brew is bursting with flavor and extremely drinkable. At 12% abv you absolutely ""smell"" the heat at your nose and sense the alcohol on your tongue, but it's not overpowering by any stretch. If you're not accustomed to extreme beers then this is not for you. However, if you have a penchant for big flavor and drinkability then the Palo Santo Marron should be on your list of must haves."
"The darkest night imaginable fills my glass. Delicious scent of bitter chocolate with some caramel notes. A heavy bodied beer filled with malty, bitter chocolate and great roast. Beautifully disguised alcohol that is unique and lovely. A wonderful syrupy concoction that could take you to the deepest parts of the subconscious. Still waters run deep rings true here. A gorgeous beer made of black magic potions and I am the living dead. Congrats Dogfish."
"Pours a very dark brown,with no light showing thru,with a giant light brown head. The head is huge and leaves great lacing. The smell is strong with dark fruit,figs,prunes,and raisins,roasted malt,and alcohol. The taste is like the smell,dark fruit,alcohol,roasted malt,and candy sugar. A very different flavor and better than I expected. The m/f is heavy with all the flavors mixing well. A very good beer,unsual like I would expect from Dogfish Head, and something that just has to be tried."
"I had no idea what to expect when I poured this beer, but I was pleasantly surprised by the two fingers' of thick, foamy, deep-brown head that it produced. This was above a deep, dark -brown beer with ruby highlights and light penetration only at the edges of the glass. The nose had a very organic scent, like fresh-cut wood intermingled with bananas. Mouthfeel was medium with flavors of anise, chocolate, and caramel on the tongue. It may seem like this would be too sweet for a self-avowed hophead, but it was actually more bitter than sweet and with a subtle alcohol heat interwoven into the flavor. It was on the finish that I got the vanilla that the label mentioned, as well as a banana flavor. It was an interesting beer, but its (relatively) high ABV made it a one-and-done."
"Pours thick and pretty much black in color. Thin brown head with a little sticking around for lacing. The aroma is roasted malts, caramel, wood and some alcohol noticeable. The flavor is heavy roasted malts, somewhat burned, chocolate, oak with slight traces of coffee. Mild bitterness. Interesting that while some of the flavors are a little intense there is absolutely no alcohol noticed, which I got in the aroma. One of the easier drinking 12% brews I've ever had. Good beer but didn't necessarily excite me. Seemed like an Imperial Porter, which I admit are not my favorite."
"D-You would never guess 12%. Very smooth and enjoyable. The dryness is most welcoming. A very interesting and unique brew. DFH does it again by making the ""odd"" a highly drinkable beer."
"D: Pretty damn smooth and drinkable considering the ABV on this bad boy and how well the alcohol burn is hidden as well. Just a tasty beer all around."
"D: Very strong, but me like it strong, Dad! Dadfishhead thank you!!!"
"Poured from a 12 oz pink bottle into my standard pint glass. Dark, rich brown in color with maple edges in my glass. The head is dark tan that recedes quickly after the pour. Smells of rich vanilla, banana, butter and molasses followed with hints of figs, honey, spirits, heavily roasted malts. Very complex with along of rich and flavorful scents going on. The smell very inviting. Onto the best part... This is a velvety, medium to full-bodied beer with a rich combination of complex flavors. Much like nose, the most dominant flavors in the taste spectrum include thick vanilla, banana, spices including nutmeg, pumpkin and/or cinnamon and hints of chocolate. The beer finishes with the nut brown reminants you'd come to expect. This beer was a perfect topper after enjoyed a grilled, dry rubbed ribeye. Good stuff, I definitely recommend it for being a unique beer, but not a nut brown beer."
"Overall, very nice brew. I'm definitely trying to get more for winter...this will make a nice ""snuggler"" brew."
"D: A decent taste and mouthfeel combo. As you drink this beer, it becomes more drinkable. The alcohol tends ton recede, allowing the burnt malts and wood tastes to make themselves much more evident. A nice beer and worth a try."
" Great beer from a great brewery. Love wood in a beer and used immensely in this beer. Palo Santo wood works good in a big sweet brown ale."
"Bottom line: I really like this American Brown Ale as it has all sorts of good flavours going on and it's a wonderful sipper. Highly recommended!"
"Finally a good use for brown beer. Malty and so I can use this to turn people on to craft beer. The wood worked superb wonders without being overbearing, and balanced not too sweet. Dark brown and rich-looking, above average mouthfeel. Very drinkable for 12%. Roastiness also there and well constrained. Six months later, room temperature, more chocolate, thick and woody."
"D - Alcohol comes through quite a bit in this one. I'd also like a little less carbonation as well. Still, this brew boasts some nice complex flavors and aromas. Certainly well done, but not my cup of tea. Definitely a sipper!"
"d - 12%? really? i never would have guessed..."
"This is a huge sipping beer with so much complexity that it shouldn't be ""Drinkable"" it should be savorable. I will definitely be laying some of this down. Really nice effort."
"Many Dogfish Head brews seem overly sweet/malty to me, but this one strikes a nice balance, which is especially amazing considering its strength. In fact this beer is almost dangerous. I really enjoyed the complexity and uniqueness of this brew. Recommended..."
"How has this one been off my radar for so long? There is a mild carbonation that really lets the flavors come through. It's so smooth its hard to taste the 12% abv. However at about half a glass you sure can feel it. Outstanding."
"Pours a deep brown, almost impenetrable, with some very slight ruby highlights. Nose predominantly roasted malt, and some wierd wood. Taste follows with good roasted malt character, Some sort of a sweetness to the wood flavor in here. Some vanilla and a bit of spice. Mouthfeel is solid here, with some good viscosity as I would expect from what I would call an imperial brown ale. Drinkability is pretty good for the abv but this one is quite hot. Overall a very unique brew, but quite strane. The wood (im assuiming) imparts a very strange and unique flavor to the brew. A good beer, and a fun drinking experience. Try it."
"Pours a dark marron with caramel colored head dissapates quickly with little lacing. Strong alcohol in the smell, a warning to drink slow and enjoy, I think of brandy or barrel aged bourbon as much as beer, though there are definate hints of dates, vanilla, and candy malt. The alcohol gets more powerfull as the beer warms, but the flavor deepens accordingly. And what a flavor, the strong alcohol in the nose dissapears on the lips leaving a sweet vanilla begining, a delicious maltness, definate caramel presence and a soft enveloping earthy finish. I can't belive how smooth this beer is, and how delicious. It rolls over the tongue and begs for another sip. Serve at cellar temp. This is a worthy offering."
"I bought a single at Cloverleaf for ~3.50 and drank it from a Chimay chalice. The beer was really dark colored and opaque, looked like a stout without much of a head. It had a potent aroma, brandy and chocoloate and dark fruits and alcohol. It was really appealling but daunting, you can tell it's a sipper from the first sniff. The taste was really complex, lots of sweetness from malts, chocolate, brown sugar or toffee, dark fruits like plums and raisins, and brandy or whiskey, kind of similar in ways to KBS. The mouthfeel is way thicker than I imagined it would be, and drinkability is as good as can be hoped from such a rich and complex thick ale. I nursed the glass for 1-2 hours."
"M/D - Full bodied and very smooth and creamy. 12% is tough but still a very drinkable beer. Would probably be better as a sipper, but it is deceptively sessionable."
"Incredibly dense mouthfeel, viscocity and texture. Flavor and aromas seemed to be all locked up until it had some time to warm and open up then it gave way to some rich aromas of coffee, caramel, cedar and tobacco. Rich soy/teriyaki flavors with ruby port-like sweetness at the core."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Full bodied with a slightly warm mouthfeel from alcohol. Low carbonation is appropriate. Dry finish on this beer. This is definitely one to be sipped, enjoy it over a long period of time. I'm sure that at some point I will pick this up again, though I am always on the quest to try something different so I doubt it will be anytime soon. Be sure to get this one though if you've not yet had it."
"Hoo-boy. Four or five sips & I can feel my belly warming to the Jim Beam, I mean Palo. This would be a good beer to have out in the ice-fishing shack. Although clearly the basic formula has been tampered with significantly, this is the best brown ale I've had to date. Good beer!!"
"Pours super dark brown, practically black with a dark brown creamy head. Good lacing, very very thick like sludge. Nose is full of dark heavy fruits and alcohol, more like a sherry than a beer. Taste is also very intense, fermented raisin and plum up front with some banana towards the end, and of course alcohols. This definitely is not a good summer beer, but one that definitely needs to be tried."
"Looking forward to serving this warm with a nice steak (when my budget allows me to buy both). Will definitely be looking to store some of these in my cellar, as long as I can be patient enough."
"Pours a three finger light brown head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Totally black color. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is sweet roasted chocolate, no wood, high ABV is hidden, mellow finish. $4.20 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Poured almost blackwith a big tan head. Its like an imperial brown. you can smell the alcohol and complexity of this beer.Nose had notes of wine, vanilla, licorice, spices, and wood. The taste is very compex with maple, oak and vanilla. Lots of sugar and a great malt profile. ABV is very well hidden. I believe this is as good as it gets for a Brown."
"with duct tape over their mouth"
"drinkability: strong but cant put it down"
"An excellent offering from DFH, I am glad this one is a year-round beer. I wonder what another 6 months would do to it, but I highly recommend it at any age."
"Ahhh, this beer had limited release in the Philly area...at least I had a heck of a time locating some...untilI went to the Rehoboth... The brandy glass of the nectar of the gods arrived, and immediately put a smile on my face! The caramel the vanilla, words just can't express the wonder of this magnificent brown ale. Sam C gets the unique flavour for the Palo Santo tree in Paraguay, thus, the name Palo Santo Marron!!!"
"For being a brown ale, this one pours a deep dark black with a big three finger dark brown head. Nice layer of webbing left on the sides of the glass as this one falls. First whiff I get is maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla, and sweet caramel. Very complex, malty smelling brew. Taste begins nutty and sweet with big caramel and butterscotch notes. The wood emerges midway with a touch of booze and molasses as well. Vanilla and cane sugar round out the moist aftertaste, this is a damn fine tasting beer for sure. Full body with a thick and chewy feel. Carbonation is very subtle but fits in well with the beer. I have no idea how this beer is 12%, I could put this down just as easy as a normal brown ale and that's just scary. Dogfish beers have been pretty hit or miss with me, but this one is definitely a winner. Wow..."
"Definitely caught off guard by the ABV on this one (I meant no disrepect). This guy pours dark and brown - real dark with little head retention and gives off a woody, kind of chocolate smell. The taste is a strong malt body with a slight nuttiness and heavy on the chocolate and malevolent fruit rounded off by the aged wood it was stored in, and has a full, thick mouthfeel. I didn't feel too loaded down after one of these but I would enjoy the adventure of making a session out of it."
"This is a very special beer that should be consumed by professionals."
"2008 vintage malt beverage aged on Palo Santo wood. This poured like an imperial stout, an opaque black with a bit of dark brown head. It smelled strongly of oak and mocha and licorice, with prominent alcohol. It tasted very strong and complex, like oaky cooking vanilla, barley malt, and mocha bitter-sweetness. It was quite thick with no carbonation, and had a lasting bittersweet aftertaste with alcohol warming. Overall this was totally unique with lots of elements that were well blended and balanced. Its wonderful flavor and body kept it from being too difficult to drink, despite how bold it was, and the complexity of the boldness was great to sip and contemplate."
"Despite the ABV, this is quite drinkable. Dangerously so! Another great beer from Dogfish Head!"
"Pours with some viscosity and creates a thick and dense brown head that sticks around forever. Lacing comes in full sheets. The body is dark and does not allow light to get through. Aroma is very, very nice. Very penetrating. Rum soaked berries and rich malts and chocolate and barrel properties and figs and raisins. The flavor is pretty rich and decadent. Vanilla and caramel mingle with boozy rum notions, maple syrup and treacle. Almost like a jacked up milkshake. It's boozy, but it's 12%. So it's to be expected. Creamy mouthfeel. Interesting beer."

"D: For how high its ABV is, it really drinks smoothly. Obviously, this isn't your run-of-the-mill brown ale, but I would strongly encourage anyone who hasn't to pick up some of this stuff."
"Pours a dark brown/ black color with a brown-ish head. In the aroma, oaky, woody, alcohol, and hints of chocolate. In the taste, alcohol, and chocolate malt. Kind of wine-ish. A smooth and a medium to big bodied mouthfeel, and a small dry, alcohol, and malty aftertaste. Big but good, alcohol is nice, a nice woody presence."
"D - Wow. Would love another, but never had two back-to-back. In favor for later."
"Pours a surprisingly, superdark, inky black with a great caramel-brown colored head which retains very well. Nice lacing. Smells very roasty, hints of vanilla, dark chocolate, grains, lactose, and tons more. If I didn't know any better, I would swear that this is some kind of Double Stout. Then comes the tasting. Roasty, cherries, vanilla, burnt caramel, figs, very apparent alcohol bite and extreme warmth in the chest. Lots of hoppiness in the finish as well. Very heavy bodied, inky, good carbonation, finishes pretty dry. Very enjoyable brew from DFH as would be expected. This one is definitely a sipper. One to kick back, and take time with all it's complexities and subtleties. Definitely one I shall revisit soon."
"Overall: Truly unique beer from DFH which seems to be their thing and well done which usually seems to be their thing. If you can get it try it, its uniqueness is certainly worth investigation."
"D- Considering the alcohol content, the beer is very drinkable"
"Pours to a deepest dark brown almost black body with a carmel brown colored one inch head leaving only a skim after a couple of minutes. Nose has dark richness with woodsy malt and dark fruit with a hint of hops. Big richness in the way of carmalized malt teams with distinct woodsy oak notes with first sip. Dark fruits and some slightly sour cherry tones are there in the middle of the palate. A cherry nyquil feel hints at the back of the tongue also. I would call this a brownest dark red ale. Big and rich throughout. Attractive fat thick mouthfeel. Very drinkable for 12%."
"Drinkability: 12% abv, but it's so smooth and sweet it's hardly noticeable. I really like this one - don't know why it took me so long to pop it open. It's been sittin' in my fridge for at least six months! Highly recommended."
"It's rare to find a truly unique beer these days, and Dogfish Head has come through with a winner. The pour was great with nice lace and a silkiness that lined the glass beautifully. The aroma was quite intense with brown sugar, slight coffee and dark chocolate tones and prune scents all mixed together to form a very inviting scent. Flavors were very intense with slight port wine flavors mixed with bitter dark chocolate and a smoky aftertaste. It was a big surprise that there was not more of an alcohol flavor in there but the 12% blended in perfectly. Highly recommended and definantly let it warm a bit for maximum flavor."
"Drinkablity/Conclusion- Quite the drinkable and enjoyable beer at 12%. Expensive, but well worth it."
"Mouthfeel dances the fine line between medium and thick. Moderate carbonation. A sure sipper, but the alcohol, as mentioned, lacks the presence I had expected. Damn good beer, but a bit pricey. I bought a single so I missed out on the DVD."
"Despite quite a bit of alcohol warmth, this stuff is still quite drinkable. I can imagine the warmth wouldn't bother me on cold, snowy maine day, so maybe 85 and humid wasn't the best time to drink this. Oh well, I'll make sure to pick up a couple more and store them away for this winter."
"taste is thick, sour, dark chocolate, prunes, alcohol in the back, wood, some roasted malt, end is somewhat bitter."
"1st bottled batch. Appears very dark in the glass, a super opaque cloudy brown with a well developed light tan head, that fades into a collar in the glass. Nose isn't super vibrant and doesn't have a lot complexity. Mainly dominated by roast, it also has hints of caramel, raisin and a touch of palo santo wood. Flavor has much complexity than the nose. Roast, brown sugar and burnt toffee, with light hints of apple and plum, alcohol and palo santo wood. I like this ale pretty well."
"This beer was so drinkable. It's really smooth not too bubbly and certainly not filling. I enjoyed just sipping and trying to figure out what flavor was coming next. This was truly one of the better beers I have ever enjoyed."
"Taste isn't as boozy although the mouth does feel a bit warm after each drink, very slick in the mouth and sticky, good carbonation level, take your time with this one as it can be a bit much, strong malt backing, strong dark fruit presence with a wooden aspect."
"D-Unique....a great sipper with a load of unique flavors...a winner in my book..."
"On tap at the restaurant in Rehobeth, this one was served in a mid sized snifter, minor head, but leaves rich, tight lacing. Malt and rum in the nose. Dense coating and smooth layers of dark malt notes and waves of enjoyment. More rum, some raisins, vanilla, malt and more malt picked up. Tasty, complex creation, fine night capper."
"Probably the most unique brown ale i have ever encountered. DFH has developed a perfectly balanced high alcohol content beer. The distinct flavors hit your mouth in stages: Vanilla is strong up front then gives way to the wood aged aspects along with a smokey flavor that finishes clean and leaves a nice hint of the caramel and the alcohol at finish. The drinkibility is impressively high. Will defininetly be good with anything off the BBQ!!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Foamy tan head, half an inch and laces well. The color is a dark/opaque brown, no light through except the edges when glass is tilted. Reminds me more of an abbey or stout color. Nutty, licorie, and malt are all on the nose. The taste is much the same as the aroma. The difference comes from the slick oils that coat the mouth from probably the hops. A big brown ale, but the taste reminds me more of a stout. Big bodied, alcohol is well hidden in the big flavor profile. Just drink a couple in a sitting."
"This original creation from DFH pours a very opaque brown with garnet/runy tint. There is little to no head, just a small amount of lacing. The first sniff is malty with a lacquer like scent. The initial sip is woody, malty with an ethanol like alcohol burn, but in no way bad. Its got a coffee like flavor that shows up at the back of the mouth. There's a hidden almost prune like flavor hidden there among the hopless oaky flavors that deveolp mid glass. This is a very complex beer with many many layers of flavor dancing around the high octane base. I wasn't sure what to expect. I've never seen anything like this. Its right in line with the DFH modus operandi. I am not disappointed. Great beer, needs to be treated with respect. Well done."
"Tastes just like it smells, but the mouthfeel is heavy and complex. So, it is definitly a sipping beer. And what a wonder to sip and enjoy!"
"12 oz. pour at The Blue Tusk in Syracuse. Deep, nearly opaque brown with mahogany around the edges. Thin dark tan head that sticks around. Lots of lacing. Aroma of chocolate, hazlenuts and figs. Flavor to match with a nice roastiness and hints of vanilla coming through as well. The mouthfeel is quite heavy, which is appropriate for this beer. Meant to be sipped and enjoyed over an extended period of time. Very tasty."
"This is definitely a sipping beer. Serve it in a wine glass, snifter, tulip, whatever. If in pint glass, take small sips. Because of this I lowered the drinkability score. It's a fine beer though, worthy of the Dogfish Head lineup. Recommended."
"D: I'm not sure this was the best choice to go with dinner... maybe I'll let the rest warm up and enjoy in half an hour or so. Otherwise, this is a wonderful sipper!"
"."
"The alcohol is completely hidden. Would be a great after dinner drink."
"This was probably the most interesting brown ale I've ever had. Definitely worth a try."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into standard pint glass. Beer pours a very very dark Mahogany, firm pour yields almost no head that vanishes very quickly leaving wispy clinging vestiges along the side of the glass. Moderate lacing. Nose consists almost entirely of ceder and dark malt with a light hint of hops and alcohol. On the palate dark and viscous malt, hints of vanilla, ceder and light sour cherries. Wood really adds to the flavor. Silky smooth, almost creamy, chewy with a nice long finish that starts to show a bit of the 12% abv. Mouthfeel is everything you want in a beer, complex layers of flavor. If I had to mark this down for anything it would be drinkablility. This is really a sipping beer and I would have trouble drinking more then one. Excellent offering."
"Wow. I don't know what this is as far as style, but it certainly is *not* a brown ale. It poured up absolutely black; better than some stouts. Smell was dark fruits, some spice, perhaps, dark roasted (burnt?) malts and alcohol. Taste reflected the same with emphasis on the dark fruit and alcohol, although I don't believe this drank like a 12%'er; 9....9 and change maybe, but not 12. Mouthfeel was sensational! (IMO) *This* is the kind of beer I like to relax with shortly before bed. Heavy. Thick. Almost oily. Perhaps the second week of July in Ga. isn't the best time for this one; perhaps the second week of November would be better. Nevertheless, I'm rather impressed with this one, whatever style it's supposed to be. The flavour in this is just delicious! (The label on the bottle says Brown Ale, too, but...)"
"D - This is a BIG beer not to be taken lightly... Warming feeling in the chest like a strong brandy or whiskey... To be sipped and savored, not rushed... One of the more complex beers I've ever tried..."
"D - Very drinkable but that 12% ABV will wreak havoc. An amazing beer that's going down way too quickly. Congrats to DFH for a really great brew!"
"Very, very good."
"Definatly recommend. DFH delivers once again!"
"Really delicious."
"Edit: I had another bottle and it was silky smooth, not even approaching over carbonated. Mouthfeel is superb. Flavors show more cappuccino-like espresso notes than I remember...more dessert-like."
"drinkability is pretty good, it's loaded with flavor and alcohol without a lot of burn. a little bit if a sipper obviously, but quite good and drinkable for what it is."
"Even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Very drinkable, a rich and tasty beer."
"Perfect carbonation for this big bodied brew, makes for a good strong sipper. This stuff has really grown on me since the first pint Sam bought me a month or so ago at O'Brien's...great on tap or from the bottle!"
"drinkability is great. there's no way this seems like 12%. the malt and bitterness are balancing out the alcohol very well. i like the barrel character too. definitely distinct from your usual barrel-aged offerings, but nice. interested to see how this one will change with age."
"Pours a deep opaque black/dark brown, no light gets through, imperial stout black, thin tan head forms, quickly settles to a thin ring, few lace spots. Smell is sweet, brown sugar/molasses, booze, lots of dark fruit, touch of chocolate, biscuit, quite sweet, sherry, licorice, wood, neat. Taste is brown sugar and caramel, chocolate, wood, licorice, fruits, sherry, more licorice, alcohol, pretty neat! Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, some warmth but pretty damn smooth for 12%. Thanks Russ!"
"Another delightful example of the way DFH thinks outside the box. Brown ale/imperial stout hybrid, and marvelously creative."
"The flavor packs a powerful punch of slightly bitter dark chocolate, sour whiskey-esque booze, sweet caramel, and a touch of toasted chestnut and almond. The alcohol heat is certainly noticable, making this beer a definate sipper, but its actually a quite pleasant, warming ""burn"". The carbonation level is higher than I'd expected for a 12% ABV, and the finish is bittersweet, slightly hoppy, and full of caramel-chocolate liquor notes. Overall, I'm digging this beer, and glad I picked up a 4-pack. It seems like the kind of beer that would age well."
"Overall- Great beer. Very interesting beer. DFH does a great job with this one."
"There is very low carbonation with this beer, but it is super thick and full bodied, which really worked here. Each sip kept me wanting more, and even with the high ABV, this was a very drinkable ale...a nice balance between flavors and texture. This is the perfect beer to sip on before bed after a long day of work."
"There's a ton going on here. It's really terrific in the mouth, initially rushing the palate with the carbonation and multiple flavors, but the longer you sit with it the better things turn out to be. Lots of complexity, lots of alcohol content, lots of good beer."
"As drinkable as a beer with 12% abv can be, I suppose. Really flavorful and robust."
"Drinkability is fair, this is one tough brown ale at 12%, the specialty wood does a good job of accenting and not dominating the flavor profile, the stiff alcohol presence puts this in the range between traditional strong ale and ""sipping"" dessert beers, a nice treat for brown ale fans"
"Drinks easy for the complexity & ABV, the hotness does detract a bit. One to sip by a fire or enjoy with dessert or meat. This would be one to offer up to wine snobs"
"D - Very rich, but full of Palo Santo Marron wood essence, this has to be one of the best browns Dogfish head makes. I enjoyed this and drank it quickly not realizing the 12% abv it contained, so I consider it drinkable and very well made. I really like the taste the wood gives this with earthy sweet flavors."
"12oz bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours an opaque dark brown/black body with a quickly dissipating thin head of tan head. Smells chocolaty with woody notes. Tastes like chocolate and coffee, with strong woody notes. Full bodied, bordering on viscous, with ample carbonation to clean the palate. Drier than I expected, though still sweet, and the wood adds an interesting quality to the beer, complimenting the dryness... Having said that, it's a solid tasty strong American brown. Not entirely sure yet whether it was worth the 14$ per four-pack though..."
"Cheers"
"Poured into a snifter pours a pitch black with a ring of foam that stays the entire time. Smell has a sweet scent of candy apple, a bit of pine as well. Taste is a bit sweet at first with a strong alcohol burn as it goes down with an aftertaste of roasted coffee and pine, very unusual and nothing like I have tasted before, just a bit of hop character in the mix as well. I had big hopes for this beer, I feel this one probably ages well and will be very good say a year from now, overall has a sweet coffee taste to it."
"Overall, quite good. Not something I would want more of than 1 at a time, but a nice dessert drink. DFH puts out another very interesting beer, I'm curious as to what a few years of age would do to this."
"Wow! You could tell me that it was brewed in a bathtub and I'd be love'n this. Without a doubt one of the best beers that i've had the pleasure of considering this year. Let's get right on over to the drinkability quotient...because i may have to open a second one to finish this review. The 12% ABV is masterfully integrated. The smell is amazingly complex. The aroma comes across as a silky rich vanilla, deep-dark caramel, ""going to loose your mind in this double stout"" character. The mouth feel is equally complex. Scoring mega-points for imagination and creativity. It's smooth with an altogether silky coating texture. Full flavored, the taste is a mirror image of the nose. Vanilla and darkened malty caramel that lingers well. ""Swing...and a miss!", just not gonna do this one justice. GOING BACK FOR MORE."
"Overall, a very interesting, very very different beer, that I enjoy quite a bit.... just not right now. This would be great in the dead of winter, not June. I'm going to pick up a few more bottles to hold onto for a few years. I think this would age pretty nicely. Well worth picking up and trying for the price."
"For as thick as it looks it's has a nice body. A creamy fluff in the mouth. The alcohol content in this a very deceiving because the brew has such a mellow taste. Slow roasted coffee with a hearty amount of vanilla and a dash of maple syrup. A kiss of hops in the finish and a nice warming in the chest as it goes down. There's quite a few levels of complexities from start to finish so the high end booze content is hardly noticed but watch out cuz it will sneak up behind ya."
"Pours a dark black with a thin tan head that falls to nothing fairly quickly. Nose is kind of a woody molasses thing. Very slight coffee tone. Flavor is smooth with a nice roasted character. Smooth profile overall. Feel is slick and smooth. Lower carbonation. Overall very easy to drink. Smooth and a nice character to it. Not really overly complex or anything, but it's workin'."
"Tastes rich chocolatey and nut with malt sweet dominated by a drying roast. Vanilla with some creaminess. Not particularly complex, but enjoyable. Alcohol sting is present at a level much lower than I would expect. Waaay to much carbonation. Md-thick mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: Why am I picturing Newman liking is fingers and salivating ""It's the wood that makes it good""? This is so mellow and smooth I'm amazed it's a 12% ABV. And this was bottled on 4/15/08... 2 months ago? Amazing. I got this as single for $3.49 in downtown Princeton, NJ where things are overpriced to begin with... a real bargain. I'm surprised DFH doesn't put the exclamation point on this one and charge $8. Kenny... Kenny..."
"Palo Santo Marron pours a dark brown with a dark brown head from a twelve ounce brown bottle. The aroma is intense and complex, I get vanilla, caramel, dough, wood, alcohol and more. The mouthfeel is medium to thick. At first the flavor strikes me as fruity, hints of vanilla and licorice, wood, caramel and alcohol. The alcohol is fairly well hidden, but it's there and I can feel the warming. Worth a try, especially if you like bigger beers."
"D - Very good. I really enjoyed this one. I am surprised that they labeled this as a malt beverage. It is a pleasant."
"You'd never think this was a brown ale. There is some brown in the appearance, but only as dark brown highlights. Looks more like a double stou of sorts. Good dark brown head after the pour, but it quickly recedes. The aroma is a striking, banana, vanilla, marshmellow, with wood undertones mix. WOW! Thetaste starts with brownies mixed with marshmellows and rice krispie treats. The some hops mix wth a little coffee and bananas with a big dollop of vanilla cream wit some very exotic woody undertones. The palate is a complex, yet silky smooth with a well integrated and balanced alcohol content. The kind of sipping beer you sip and think to yourself, ""what and awesomely unique beer."""
"D- Easy to drink. I have to try and drink it slow as the high abv can come back and get ya."
"Really a great beer, and has to be my favorite DFH brew thus far. Went down way too quick for that abv though. Whew!!"
"Overall, a nice new entry from Dogfish Head, but I couldn't see myself drinking it often even if it was available here in Texas. This was my only bottle but I'm interested to read reviews of this with some age on it."
"I feel like I'm reviewing two different beers. Given my impression of this fresh, I'm only willing to raise my marks to ""average."" A definite candidate for cellaring - way way too hot for the moment IMO."
"It poured brown/black, murky with a tan head. Good lacing. Smell is woody and caramelly. Taste is roasty, bitter, and brown. Also some moderate alcohol presence but I had no idea it was 12% when I had it. The body was both good and bad so I gave it a 3. The body was real thick and oily but it was very smooth and consistent. Drinkable as a nice sipping drink for sure but not any faster than 45 minutes for the 8 oz pour that I had."
"It's a good beer, and while perhaps unique in creation, this is not so ""off-centered"" tasting. That said, I enjoyed it - make no mistake - and I hope to see similarly creative projects from them in the future..."
"D - This is an awesome beer. I love dogfish and this is yet another great beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"Dogfish always redefines my definition of what a style could possibly be, and they have acoomplished again. A brown ale could be anything from a Samuel Smith brown to this, Sam Calagione never fails to do something different."
"I'd say try it. I'm glad I did a single, I wont be buying a 4 pack. Too pricey."
"a beautiful dark beer with a really deep tan head that fades to lace rather quickly. The smell is a really complex mix of malt and wood, the vanilla is quite aparent, but there's a lot more going on there, as with the smell the taste doesn't dissapoint... malty malty wood, I like it a lot. The chocolate malt provides a bit of dryness in the mouthfeel that's really nice in a beer that has a potential to be overwhelmingly sweet. Once again, I don't think I would have a problem drinking my limit of this beer which would probably be about three."
"D- Interesting beer here that I am enjoying being able to try but I don't think this flavor profile is really my favorite out there. I probably won't buy it again any time soon, but it was fun to try as it definitely is an ""off-centered ale"""
"Complaints? Hmm ... as noted this is more of a one sitting beer, you're there to respect it and pick apart its offerings. It's a bit tart if we're getting picky. Well-crafted without a doubt, its an unreplicated offering and as such has added to the beer world."
"Mahagony coloring, tastes kind of nutty but sweet, also smoky. Very complicated. Also has a bit of a berry taste initially. Also has a very malty taste to it. Has a banana tasting finish to it. For such a high ABV It makses the alcohol well. Feels sudsy on the tongue. As strong as this beer is it is really really drinkable."
"Poured opaque black into a pint glass with a latte-colored head that rose and frothed with the pour, but soon dissipated. Smell is dark roast coffee and wood with some sharp alcohol - should mellow out with aging. Taste is marvelously complex. Vanillas and caramels out front with good bitter roastiness and slight alcohol burn. This is like the Dogfish Indian Brown Ale gone to college. It lost some of that hoppiness and gained a whole lot more depth. Mouthfeel is great, silky smooth and full, none of the thinness that similarly alcoholic beers have. Drinkability suffers from the 12% though, but one of these after a barbeque dinner while everyone is sitting around swatting bugs as the sun goes down sounds alright to me."
"Overall, this is one complex beer with many different flavors coming together for an incredible experience."
"D - I didn't really know what to expect for sampling this. I don't typically drink a lot of beers in the 10%+ range unless I'm over at my friends house but this one is definitely one I could enjoy as an after dinner drink. One of the better offerings I've had from DFH."
"this is tied with the rochy 10, and the westy 12 as my favorite beer ever. an absolutely timeless creation by the always forward thinking dogfish head brewery."
"dark brown, almost black out of the bottle, not unlike coffee. looked thick when pouring, but wasn't really thick to drink. had a cream colored head about 1 cm high. smelled like coffee and cedar chips. tastes of coffee (again), molasses, prune juice and cognac were detected. i also thought i tasted a hint of soy sauce (the light kind). very creamy texture and smooth going down. the carbonation seemed to be just right and lasted the whole glass. not much in terms of a wood taste, but it seemed to have a woody dryness to it that coincided with a little bitterness. the alcohol was detectable but just right. I shared a sip with some Japanese friends who described it as tasting like boiled konbu, which is a thick, dark-green seaweed used for making soup bases and sauces. this is definitely a sipping beer that i think would be nice on a chilly night beside an open fire."
"The beer pours a dark brown, almost black color with a 1/4"" tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a warm crystal and roasted malt scent along with a nice vanilla aroma laid over a mild woodiness. The taste is just as good. It has a smooth malty flavor that is rich and complex. It's dry and roasted with hints of vanilla and a sweet crystal malt finish. The wood mellows the 12% abv. and adds another layer of compleity. The mouthfeel is perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is one tastey beer. I'm glad Dogfish is back making extreme ""beers", not wine/beers; or whatever you call their last few new ones. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Very tasty beer. The 12% ABV may limit you. Very thick and heavy as well. Your limitations are what would hold you back, not the beers. Very good and very complex. Good job."
"Jeez, what a nice beer! I poured this into a goblet. It was a very dark brown, almost black beer with a medium-sized lighter brown head. There was a tiny bit of lacing. It had a fruity, caramel aroma. There was a pronounced vanilla taste, as well as the fruit and caramel. Hops appeared late. The alcohol was very noticeable, but tempered by the vanilla. A rich, rewarding beer. I imagine it would cellar well."
"Pretty much same experience as out of the bottle, per my review. The ABV seems to be hidden better."
"Something here doesn't mesh like it is actually two different beers in one. Imperial British Pale Ale and an Imperial Porter mixed. Thing is they don't really mix here so much as they coexist so you don't get the Black & Tan effect. Here you get the fruity and dark show."
"Popped a 12 oz bottle with a 4/15/08 born on date. Put my nose to the top - wow - like a sweet imperial licorice stout with your typical dogfish head undertones. Poured like motor oil to spread that sweet imperial licorice and caramel malt scent all over. Sipped it to notice it was roasted and charred around the edges with an alcohol wallop. It's super strong and the 12% alcohol is definitely apparent. If I didn't know it was a nut brown ale of some sort I would think it was a sweetened imperial stout. Very dark. It's almost like the alcohol separates itself from the rest of the ingredients as it swishes around in my mouth. I'd better subtly sip this one or I'll be a goner in no time. It's very complex and compelling and I find myself wanting to figure it out but that'll leave me laid out. Mmm. I like it."
"D: A great big beer. Dogfish can be extreme, too extreme at times, but this is not one of those times. Great effort!"
"Frankly, it is difficult to rate a beer like this. It is unlike any other beer I've ever tasted. I know Dogfish like to push the envelope, but this brew really is remarkable in the extent to which it plays by its own rules, even by Dogfish's standards. If for no other reason, this brew is worth trying (even at $13 for a 4-pack) for its uniqueness."
"Don't think I could drink more than one of these in a sitting due to the strength of it, but it's something I could sit down every once in a while and have."
"Drinkability> Minus one point for being so dangerous (strong)"
"It's a thoroughly fascinating beer, but not for the reasons I'd have expected. The Palo Santo wood plays a minor role, but a congruent and beneficiary one. This ultimately plays out like a huge malt-bomb English Russian Imperial Stout (think: Sam Smith, but much larger) all full of Fruit Cake, Earth, Booze, and Wood."
"D- The alcohol may not be harsh, but it does make it self known. This is definitely a sipper. A really interesting beer and worth a try."
"This beer packs a George Foreman punch in a Bernard Hopkins body.Unbelievable!"
"Poured into a DFH glass a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tannish head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some nice tones of vanilla, cherries, figs, plums, raisins, and caramel notes. The taste is sweet, malty, nice notes of dark fruit, with some caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, another different take of the style from DFH. Highly recommended, thanks Joe."
"This is very dark for a brown ale. The color is a woody brown and looks black in my glass. A nice mocha head settles to a thin cover. This is a bit hot right now with notable alcohol aromas. There are also rich malts, vanilla and caramel. The taste is quite complex and could use a couple years to mellow out. Flavors of roated malts, earthy oak, alcohol, vanilla and rich candy. Full body silks over my palate. Very drinkable considering the strength. Gets better every sip I take."
"Well, this is certainly the finest brown ale I've ever had and I'll go so far as to say that it is probably one of the finest brews I've ever had.. I wasn't expecting this at all but this stuff was delicious..."
"Pours dark brown with slight ruby highlights. Nice two finger tan head really sticks around and firm sheet of lacing clings all the way down. Wood, chocolate, leather, smoke, and some earthy tobacco. Very nice. All the same in the flavor with an herbal tea like component. The wood really shines and blends extremley well with the chocolate malts. Hops keep things in check and add a nice spicy birch beer like quality. Nice creamy feel, with just enough carbonation. Hefty abv is extremely well hidden behind a curtain of complex and enjoyable flavors. This is a great canidate to put in the cellar and see what happens. Really enjoyed this."
"O/ M - Full to heavy body. Alcohol intensifies with warmth. Very complex w/ wood notes. Incredible beer."
"5.0 D: One bottle was plenty, but I wouldn't have wanted any less. Very good sipper."
"D: Split a 12oz bottle and that suited me just fine. Really nice beer. Hopefully dogfish will keep making this."
"D- Splitting a 12oz bottle is a good idea."
"D: Very good brown ale. This is a must try. From start to finish this one does not dissapoint. But at 12% ABV, it's a sipper. Skal."
"While this isn't a beer to session, it is great for sipping. I preferred to let it warm up a little. It is smooth, and chocolately, and rich. It's like drinking dessert."
"Dark, rich and mysterious. Palo Santo Marron is a hell of a strong and complex beer."
"Strong, unique effort from DFH...definitely different from anything I've ever tried. Well worth trying at least one bottle. It would be interesting to see how this ages."
"Palate wise it is noticeably syrupy in body, with gooey roasted malt & maple up front, balanced by tartness from wood and hops. Carbonation carries through nicely and somehow the alcohol is entirely disguised."
"single from Whole Foods Raleigh, bottled 04/15/08"
"The beer pours an opaque brownish-black with a creamy mocha like head (just as the video says). Even with the massive alcohol content, the head lingers and laces well, probably due to the addition of wheat. The aroma is quite potent with caramel and molasses like sweetness dominating rounded off by a bit of chocolate and mysterious spice. Sipping the beer, it rushes forth with a massive sweetness. Again flavors of chocolate, caramel, and brown sugar are present, but the wood has added its own spicy, earthy characteristic unlike any other wood aged beer I have had. Alcohol is present in the finish, but provides more of a warming sensation and does not bring down the drinkability. This may be due to the smoothness that Scotch Ale yeasts tend to impart. The beer displays a full body and smooth carbonation. Amazingly, this beer is easy to drink considering the 12% ABV. While this is massively sweet and malty, it is pleasant and balanced. Oftentimes, Dogfish Head will put out incredibly interesting beers that I feel compelled to try once and then never return to. This beer on the other hand is one I would certainly get again, and considering the alcohol, I just might do that and age it a few years."
"D - As others have said, I find it hard to believe this is 12% ABV, which I guess makes it incredibly drinkable. On the other hand, it gets very filling as the beer wears on. Oak works well in this beer, maybe better than most of the oak aged stouts I've had to date. Another interesting and style-defying beer from Dogfish."
"Comments: Oh Dogfish Head, the things you guys do to push the boundaries of 'craft beer'. A quick sorting of the BA database for 'American Brown Ale' finds only 3 beers having more than an 8% ABV, none (besides this) above 10%. At a whopping 12%, this leads me to believe PSM in a whole other category. And 'Imperial Brown Ale' doesn't cut it either..."
"I stand by my initial observation that this invokes a RIS much more than a Brown Ale. Interesting, because I believe when I reviewed Indian Brown Ale, I thought it tasted more like a stout than a brown ale. In any event, from a brewery that's always trying to out-extreme itself -- often resulting in a mess -- this is a huge beer that is actually quite sensible and enjoyable."
"Nicely complex beer that is easy to drink. I recommend it. I would have never guessed this beer is 12% abv."
"Actually not nearly as thick as the appearance would seem to indicate. All-in-all, it's a good beer but with limited appeal. Still, it's one of the better barrel-aged beers I've had in a while. This was a GREAT partner with some Swiss milk chocolate."
"d: A sipper, no doubt about it. I like the unique flavor imparted from the exotic wood barrels. A rich and boozy beer. Enjoyable, if not quaffable. An extreme brown ale, the best of the style that I have had."
"Beer is good. Happy big brown beering."
"Bottle courtesy of Jay23: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some nice lacing. Aroma of vanilla and oak is pretty pleasant with some light roasted malt notes. Taste is a mix between some roasted malt notes with a mix of vanilla and oak and some creamy lactose notes. Full creamy body is really enjoyable with some great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done and probably one of the best new seasonal from Dogfish."
"Poured a black color into a standard pint glass. Definitely not a ""brown ale"" by the look of it. Little carbonation - if any. Malty nose with sugar & vanilla undertones. Taste is definitely a sweet surprise. Has a very sweet taste - not at all what I was expecting. Also got some dried fruit in the taste. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied. Drinkability takes a small hit b/c of the 12.0% ABV."
"If I can find it again, I'll pick this one up again for a special occasion. A slow sipper for sure, and one that compliments a time of deep thought and introspection very well."
"Smell is roasty. Taste is much the same with the wood flavor having a real presence in the beer. Full and smooth on the mouthfeel. At 12% this is a real sipper. A good offering from Dogfish Head."
"Taste is vanilla, wet wood, some carame, plums, prunes and malt. The alcohol is well masked, the beer is very drinkable and smooth. Tasted like a weaker world wide stout (i see a theme here)."
"The beer is very smooth and easy to drink. It's a little on the heavy side, but again, it was expected. I give this one 2 very enthusiastic thumbs up and strongly recommend it."
"A good solid beer, but not an exceptional one. Given the high abv., I probably will not come back to this one again."
"I'll be seeking more of these out."
"Overall: Fairly drinkable, but somewhat undistinguished. Not something I'd buy again, but I'd drink it again if someone else was buying, and I'll certainly drink the other three."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a deep chocolate brown with just a little light showing through a quick to form quick to fade brown head atop.Alot of stuff going on in the nose deep wood and vanilla mixed with dark fruit and chocolate just really appetizing.This brew went down very easy for such a high abv I thought it would be more of a sipping brew (wich it could be)but it glided down quite easily,flavors of dark fruit, chocolate, vanilla-like nuget and caramel mixed with slight wood this would be a fine dessert brew.A great beer almost like a port flavor wise,ejoyable."
"D: This is a real heavy brew. A sipper for sure. I'd be hard pressed to go through more than one of these. Actually, this is a good brew to share with either your significant other or a friend so you can last the night and taste some others. Strongest brown ale i've ever tasted."
"T + M + D: Smoky and sweet. Dark fruits, a bit of caramel notes... it starts to become a little sweet in the mouth after a while. DFH loves to make these extreme, huge brews, and while I applaud them for trying to go all out, sometimes the result is just alright. I feel this is one of those instances. The mouthfeel gets a little thick and sticky after a glass, though it starts off being pretty rich and creamy. Being such a huge ABV, this is a sipper, and it definitely gets a bit on the sweet side after a while. That said, it's ultimately a pretty good beer, and a decent effort from Dogfish Head... I like many of their offerings much better than this, but it's an interesting brew. Certainly give it a shot."
"I was impressed with the first two categories but the rest was downhill. I keep trying these beers from DFH and am continually let down. Perhaps, I have learned my lesson. I will not be having this one again, assuming I can even finish this one."
"Appeared like a porter, very little head with slight retention. Had a strong roasted coffee nose with a hint of hops. Very tasty brew, lots going on and the wood added a depth of flavor that is almost indescribable. Coats the palate with a rich sweet mocha aftertaste. Not overpowering, but a solid brew that I'm sure I will have again. Very drinkable and delightful. Does well as it approaches room temperature."
"Edit: Sorry, the astringency and dryness from the wood really hurt this beer. Just not working for me..taste lowered from 3.5 to 3.0."
"Overall it's pretty damn good. The alcohol kills the drinkability(sessioness) but I would take this over most Brown Ales out there. I love Wood."
"I love the adventurous spirit at dogfish, undertakeing a huge project like this, the Palo santo tank that they built for this beer cost $150,000. All for good beer. Palo santo is a cool wood that doesnt sink in water and this is a cool beer that i will have again"
"You can always count on Dogfish for interesting beers, and this one is certainly no exception. It's definitely not your typical brown ale, but it's very good. I wouldn't want to have it every day, but as a change of pace or special occasion beer, it would be great. I definitely recommend giving this one a try."
"A complex and drinkable beer, this ought to go well with steak or other heavy meat dishes."
"Very nice offering from Dogfish head."
"The body is a bit bold, but I believe that only enhances that wonderful, warming mouthfeel. This is a great sipping beer, a great steak beer, a great fire place beer, aw hell, just a great beer!"
"D - This was a lot better than I expected this beer to be young. Look forward to aging this one, and trying it in 6 months, or a year."
"Ovr: I'm not a huge DFH fan, though I agree most of their beers are solid, some even really good. This is prbably me favorite so far. I think of this as a stout, or robust porter, and the flavros are great and in complete balance. I'll age a few of these, and I can only imagine hwo smooth this will be with a year on it."
"Smooth, creamy and IMO probably the best brown ale produced in the US. If you're in the area and it's still on tap, stop by and get a glass."
"This beer poured a very dark brown, almost black color and formed a medium tan foamy head that left latticed lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, caramel and coffee. The flavor was of malt, coffee, chocolate and prunes. The body was medium light and the finish is slightly burnt. The warming aspect of the alcohol comes through in the finish. I am not used to such a high octane brown ale but Dogfish actually pulled it off."
"T: I think this beer could stand to have more of its listed flavor of vanilla and caramel show through. it ends up with a much smokier and woody flavor. i think caramel would be a great balance for this but i think it is a bit overdone. that said it is very complex and rich. This is a fun and different beer. and if you like smoke in your beer, this one will knock your socks off"
"Overall, an example of what a skilled brewer can do with a big abv beer. Huge, without being heavy."
"Pours black with some brown highlights and a thin head that settles to a very thin ring. Smells yeasty and a bit woody, but its definitely not oak, and it is quite subtle. Slightly spicy notes of licorice and cedar, as well as an earthy maltiness. Dry. The taste is remarkably smooth and subtle for the high abv. Very pleasant flavors of vanilla, dry malt, a touch of woody astringency, spice, and some brandied fruit. Very smooth and quite creamy in the mouth. Different and quite tasty, and as is often the case with dfh brews, the backstory is very interesting."
"D = Good drinkability, very nice taste and well rounded beer that is a good way to end an evening."
"Overall, a rich and enjoyable brew, although a stretch to call this an American brown ale due to the ABV and wide array of flavors. However, it just plain works as most of these ""unorthodox"" DFH brews do."
"This is why I love Dogfish Head. They can make a regular brew with excellent results, but they can make one of their trademarked Off-centered ales, and come out with a masterful brew. While this isn't the best beer ever, or the best Dogfish beer, it is a perfect example of the dedication to quality at the Dogfish Head brewery."
"D - Drinkability is better than expected. The 12% is hidden well. It comes across as an 8 - 9% beer. Flavors are balanced and interesting. I would have more of these but the abv means a limit of one per session."
"This was an interesting beer. I wasn't sure what I was drinking. I had friend give me a bottle and I did not read it just opened and poured. At first sight I was thinking it was a Stout of some sort due to the intense color. The smell and first taste didn't help identify what it was either. There is a strong oak flavor and my only guess was a Oaked RIS but with a twist. I liked everything about it but would have never guess it wasn't a RIS. It should be on your must try list just not on the must have it now list. The 12 percent does sneak up on you so enjoy the ride."
"D: Very easy to drink, such a tasty and complex beer, I'm glad Dogfish decided to send this out to CA."
"Another winner created by Sam Calagione. Find this one (then drink it). Highly recommended."
"This is something to seek out. A special beer brewed by a special brewery. Masterful!"
"A wonderful - sipper? - 12% abv, would not have known. My guess would have been 6 to 7. Smooth, exciting and creative. This is a well-made ""experimental"" brew, to say the least."
"This is a truly unique and well-crafted Brown Ale. Highly recommended."
"Palo Santo means Holy tree, When I bought this beer, a burning bush tried to take the beer from me and drink it. It said ""give me your beer"" I told the bush ""no"" and ran away. The bush was jenna bush. I wouldnt give her the beer, I like it too much."
"Surprised to see this in my neck of the woods, so I jumped all over it, had heard a lot of great things about this one and they were all true, would love to drink again, recommended for sure"
"Very highly recommended. Look forward to aging one of these for a bit. Amazed that the wood does make a difference."
"Alcohol is cleverly concealed but for some warming effects. This helps drinkability. I look forward to trying this one again to get a better handle on its many nuances."
"Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. This is a very nice beer drinkability takes a hit from the aftertaste and the ABV. I would recommend trying this very unique beverage."
"The sweet malt and spicy aromatics make this a dauntingly more-ish beer. The alcohol quickly encourages you to sip sparingly. An excellent balance."
"Very tasty, and while the alcohol is heavy on the nose, it's well hidden in the flavor. Good sipping beer."
"A well balanced, full bodied, gently carbonated and very drinkable big strong beverage. Sold."
"On tap at the Moan and Dove. This drink was very dark with a chocolate brown-colored head with eventual lacing. The aromas were strong in the malt department with some vanilla and mocha hints as well. Taste was wicked awesome: sweet chocolate flavors wrapped around smoky malts. Great medium body that added a slight crispness to the beverage. Overall, wicked good."
"Drinkability: nice flavor profile has you wanting multiple bottles of this, but the high ABV bringsthe desires back into check. Very enjoyable brew."
"Note: This beer is not made to sit in the goblet for an extended period of time. It fails rapidly after a time."
"Drinkability - This is a great sipper. Drinks more like an imperial stout. ABV is hidden well. Recommended."
"D - Bold but not overpowering. Only the alcohol prevents this from scoring higher."
"Overall a beer that blows my mind. The flavors are utterly complex but stay in the sweet/malty range. The Santo Palo wood is no gimmick. I admit to never tasting this wood before, but the wood flavor and transmitted texture is very apparent. The creamy, soft and low carbonated body makes it a satisfying and fulfilling ale to quaff (careful!!!). I'm 2/3 the way through my bottle and I can testify to feeling a little chest and (face) cheek warmth. Complex, unique and something to behold. Spectacular job DFH!!!"
"D- This is very tasty flavorwise. I am totally impressed with my first DFH experience."
"Aroma is strong and malty with smoky hints and a streak of molasses. It pours a luscious deep brown with a thick, fluffy, beige head. Flavor is rich and malty with hints of molasses and a burnt undertone. Aftertaste is lively and very enjoyable. If you like stouts and porters, your probably will find this beer to be right up your alley."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a solid medium body. Nice mellow carbonation makes this an easy drinker. The 12% is not at all noticeable, making this one almost too drinkable. A few of the other big abv Dogfish beers have a syrupy sweetness in my opinion, however the Palo Santo does not at all. This is just a damn fine beer with a great flavor. One of my new DFH faves, I hope they keep this around!"
"D- Smooth enough to hide the ultra powerful 12 percent ABV to the point that it is barely noticeable. The flavors make this one a slow sipper, but the smoothness is such that it is easy to forget ones self and gulp it down."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, not too thick, with a nice finish that lasts for awhile. This is a scarily drinkable brew for 12%. It goes down smooth and easy, and is full of flavor."
"Another extreme beer from Dogfish, although I would categorize this as an Imperial Stout, not a brown ale. Nice complexity. It's too strong for me to detect something as subtle as the wood it was conditioned in."
"Drinkability: I love Dogfish Head's experimental efforts and this beer is among the best they have released, if not the best"
"D. This is very drinkable. I had two! It is smooth and a new favorite to add to the list of great beers from DFH."
"Poured into a pint glass with tan finger high head. Body color was opaque and black. Taste was sweet with some caramel and some malts. The taste did last in the mouth for sometime. The nose had a hint of chocolate. Very drinkable beer, very scary how good it was."
"Drinkability: Obviously not a session beer, but I found myself wanting to have more."
"This is one heck of a brown ale from DFH. A nice one to sit back, sip, and enjoy."
"Pours a dark porter brown color, nearly an opaque stout with a solid quarter inch of dirty tan head. They may call it a brown, but it looks like a stout; still pretty sexy. Aromas are signature DFH, sweet, sticky candy and fusel alcohols! Digging deeper, I can get some slightly roasty malts, chocolate, vanilla, and yes, some oak; but it's not overdone. It's a very fresh cut wood smell like you would get in a carpentry shop, really nice. On the palate, this beer just blooms. Flavors are much more brown like. There's just a touch of roasted malt, not unlike most American Browns, some caramel, fruity esters with a slightly watery finish. Despite the ABV, this beer is quite drinkable. DFH often struggles with these high gravity beers, but this one truly shines. The finish is more roasted bitterness and just shy of being dry. Carbonation is low and mouthfeel is quite heavy. It is really an extreme beer and I can't wait to see what DFH has in store next. I would like to see some more oak character, I felt it was rather lacking for a beer that stakes its name on it."
"This is one of the more unique beers I have tried in a while and I find it difficult to categorize except that it's damn good. I hope DFH continues to push the envelope. Outstanding beer."
"Another of the unusual formulations to come out of Dogfish Head, Palo Santo Marron poured out closest in looks to a Porter. The body was dark brown coming out of the bottle, but in the glass, it looked pretty black. The head was quite large and settled down to a three plus finger layer of craggy foam. The smell was quite nondescript for a beer with such a complex origin. All I could smell was a little toffee, chocolate, and chicory. The taste was much more typical of wood barrel aged beers than the smell. I got a dash of vanilla, some sweet gummy flavors, a little chocolate, and a sour finish. I was somewhat disappointed that the alcohol was not hidden at all. I think this has some rough edges still which beg to be smoothed out by more aging. The mouthfeel was creamy and oily and the body was a little thicker than I was anticipating. Not a bad foray into wood aged beers, but more time is needed to mellow this baby out."
"So the smell is sweet and very boozy, smells good but isn't very unique. Some chocolate and roasted malts coming through, and they come much more to the forefront on the taste. I didn't really get any sense of the woody taste, not really sure what to look for. Enough hops in here to balance out the sweetness. It tasted good, but not really very unique. Mouthfeel was medium, not quite full enough for the beer at hand. Drinkability is good, but not great. Maybe i am just missing this one completely, i don't really get what everybody sees in this one, and I love dogfish head. Its a cool concept, but i think the beer just falls a bit short."
"Extremely drinkable for style. Amazing stuff that I hope to revisit soon."
"Overall, the alcohol is a bit harsh. If it was as noticeable (or high), this would be a pretty decadent dessert drink."
"D: Mighty damn tasty"
"Aggressive dark brown pour into a tulip with reddish/mahogony highlights. Lots of bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. Big mocha head that recedes quickly. Even swirling brings only a bit of it back. Aromas are most heavily of sugar and wafts of auslese like alcohol that I have come to associate with big DFH beers. Drinks very smoothly, with no evident carbonation. Smokey tastes coming from this one, along with burnt carmel. Some coffee notes as well. Remeinds me more of a stout than anything else - Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti comes to mind. However, this is sweeter - not at all cloying though. Bitterness provides a balance, but that is all. Alcohol remains in the background. Another tastey over the top beer form DFH. Not something that I would be in a rush to drink again, but a nice beer to hold onto for special occasions."
"Just cracked open the first bottle of my 4 pack. Poured in to a pint glass. This beer poured a VERY dark brown (damn near black) with a small light-brown head which quickly dissolved, leaving a nice ring and small thin layer of bubbles. The nose is very sweet with alcohol creeping through. Some fruity notes also appear. I had this in the fridge for a couple of days, but the aroma really started to shine when it warmed up a bit. Very roasty and chocolatey on the first taste, with a nice warming feeling due to the high alcohol content. The brew has a fruity after taste that sticks around, but is quite pleasant. For being so incredibly dark of a beer, it wasn't as heavy as I was anticipating. As much as I want to kill my the rest of my 4 pack, I really want to see how well this beer ages."
"(original date of review: 2/24/08)"
"Poured into a snifter. A lot darker than i expected almost black. Ring of bubbles with some bubble-continental plates floating around. strong lacing. Odor is of strong fermented molasses along with raisins dates a little bit of smokey wood. Taste, at first, is a combo between a wee heavy and a sweet stout, with sugary, almost watery peat flavors. smokiness and vanilla comes through next, drying out the mouth. A definite alcohol presence, but tempered somewhat by the smokey flavor. Comes out overall more like a porter than a brown ale, imo, but it also sort of isnt trying to be any one style, i dont think. Wood gets a bit tannin-y and bitter towards the end, but not too badly. Medium bodied, surprizingly so. The first of these big dogfish head beers i've had that wasn't cloying and syrupy and all together hard to drink. Actually its hard to pick out all that alcohol in here. quite a nice drinking beer. Reminds me of alaskan smoked porter in some ways."
"Epic is an understatement when describing this beer. Full bodied and deliciously smooth. This is one of the best Dogfish beers I've ever had. Flavors of malt, vanilla, caramel, and nuts, with subtle hints of black cherries and fruity spice. This is a perfectly balanced brown ale with a chewy mouth feel and milky smooth finish. A must try for anyone who enjoys good beer."
"I'm putting the other 3 bottles away to see how it ages. Being as complex as it is, I'm looking forward to seeing how it evolves!"
"The last time I encountered this fine brew was last summer the week it was tapped at the Rehoboth Beach brewpub. Nice to see the decision that I yearned for, that is to turn it into a production beer. Looks deep dark mahogany with barely any ruby highlights when held toward the light large mocha tan head forms thick and takes it's time dying down even with double digit abv that's good retention not too mention the lacing that forms in even thick patches with each sip. Aromatics are full of raisin tartness with a sharp sweet brandy note about it, complex as all hell with a lively herbal incense like quality sweet brown sugar caramelized and drizzled over it all. Maybe just a touch of anise or some other herbal quality arising from the hop profile. Flavors blend so well with smoky, earthy, and woody tones all playing off one another. Mild medicinal alcohol presence but sweet dark roasted malts and caramelized sugars dominate the flavor base, deep fruit accents round it all out with more exotic spiciness kicking. Completely original nothing else to compare this brew to an experience every craftbeer drinker should try to obtain. Body is full with sticky residual sugars given it a light syrup texture even slow churned carbonation bubbles arising, really finishes with a smoky cigar box like note. Drinkability is excellent your 	12 oz portion will be gone before you realize it, yes I know 12% it's hard to tell really blended well and aged to perfection here. I can't wait to try more brews aged in the new wooden tanks. This beer really helps regain Dogfish Head some of the credibility that it had for so long. A lot of their beers were becoming hit or miss this embodies the artform of brewing."
"Another interesting beer from an adventurous brewery. Recommended."
"Drinkability: A lot of love went into this beer. Even though I thought the DVD was great and enhanced my whole experience (not to mention DFH gets an additional thumbs up for using The Books for the open and close tune), this is a great and unique brew. Balanced, rich, flavorful, lingering, and top notch all around. Completely singular and worth the $12 or so for the 4-pack. Pick some up if you can find it. I'm hoping to let this age and see what happens, but I'm not sure I can wait."
"12 oz bottle. Pours nearly black with a dark red tint and 1.5 cm tan head that is bubbly and quickly diminishing. Aroma of wine, wood, and dark fruit. Initial flavor of aged wine and cherries. Flavor ends more woody and alcoholic. Light to medium body, limited lacing, lasting aftertaste, and strong alcohol presence. Limited drinkability based on alcohol level and personal dislike for wine, but a nice job on specialty beer."
"Pours almost black with a thick dark, tan head. Looks like an imperial stout. Very complex aroma, with notes of wine, vanilla, licorice, spices, and wood. Taste is equally rich and complex. Very smooth. Velvety mouth feel. Almost like a combination of a Quad and a RIS. Hiodes the alcohol very well. Finish lacks bitterness. That's about the only complaing I have about this one. Extremely nice offering from DFH."
"up more as soon as I can. I would really have to recommend this one to anyone who is a fan of big creations or wood aging. It is tremendously well done and refined, and one of the best things I have scene come out of Dogfish in a long time. Highly recommended."
"I simply must purchase a 4 pack for extended cellaring, and perhaps a bit more for the meantime... if there was a beer to convert people to high alcohol beers, this would have to be it, I think. Just a fantastic drinking experiment. Kudos."
"I've been a big fan of the DFH hoppy beers and knew this was a departure from that. I read the label, but I really didn't understand what I was in for. This beer is just amazing."
"Taste & mouthfeel - Rich roasty malt, vanilla, cinnamon and chocolate. The mouthfeel is chewy, almost like a liquid molasses cookie. Quite a bit of subtle complexity; I've had this a couple of times now and I'm still not entirely sure how to describe it. A nice toasty bitterness in the finish balances the initial sweetness. This is a true imperial brown - it retains the character of a brown ale without ever dipping into stout territory. Remarkably drinkable for 12%. A solid DFH offering."
"D: It was a solid brew with excellent balance, a clean finish and little after taste. The hight ABV and full body might make it a two or three bottle limit for any session."
"Taste is singular and complex, with a lot more going on than even the nose would suggest. Confusing but not overbearing. It has the profile of a classic Old Ale due to the high amount of added dark sugars, but the herbal/woody flavors shift the whole thing just to the left of that. I highly recommend it, but even though this is my second tasting, I haven't quite got a handle on this. I should have bought more. The remaining two will be fun to age."
"Purchased from South Bay Liquor. Surprisingly dark with a small tannish head. Aroma has plums, brown sugar, and a touch of alcohol. Taste is very much coffee, chocolate, and some alcohol. There is also a little bit of plum I smelled underneath it at all. The aftertaste is where the wood comes out. Mouthfeel is medium and very smooth. A tasty beer, but not quite as good as I expected it to be."
"Toasted malts and woodsy bitterness up front. Charred character takes over, backed by brown sugar, maple syrup, molasses, and dates. A little alcohol makes its way through. Accents of vanilla, tobacco, and even some anise. Numbing herbal bitterness in the finish with plenty of leftover dark fruit and molasses sweetness. Medium-full body with a relatively dry finish. Drinks pretty easy for 12%! Glad to see such another interesting, well-made beer added to the DFH line-up."
"Poured from bottle into a goblet. Dark, syruppy brown with a thin tan head. Head dissapates quickly, leaving thin lacing. Smell is of roasted malts with hints of sugar, vanilla and maybe a slight hint of alcohol. Taste is as I expected- strong malt flavor with a bite. You can taste the alcohol in this beer, but it is balanced with the malts and the smokey aftertaste. I get a nice warming sensation as I drink it. It also gets easier to drink as it warms. (I let it sit in the goblet for about 15 minutes out of the fridge, but it seemed to need more warming- maybe serva at cellar temp) One of the more enjoyable strong beers I have had in some time."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable. The 12% is quite well hidden within this fine beer. The palo santo wood really brings a little some extra to the beer, like when they give you extra peanuts on a flight."
"D: To be enjoyed with other admires of beer (m1ked). Age would glorify this brew."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Not perfectly balanced in taste, but unique in subtle character enough to make it appealing. High abv is really well masked in flavor, enhancing rather than detracting from the beer, but definitely warm on the throat and stomach."
"In some ways reminiscent of an imperial stout, but still so different in so many ways. It pours deep, deep brown and viscous-looking, with a butterscotch-colored head. The wood aromas leap out of the glass. Initial taste impressions are suggestions of caramel. licorice, a hint of chocolate and dates. And big roastiness at the core. But the overall impression is more of an ""imperial brown ale," with those great, and yet not overpowering, wood flavors. The alcohol makes itself noticed in a lingering dryness at the end. Just when I feared DFH might be running out of creative territories to explore, they come up with this gem. Nice work. Highly recommended."
"D- This beer gets big points on creativity, but it if wasn't for all the hype and DVD I would have assumed it was just a brown ale with a bit of an off flavor. It is still a nice sipping brown ale but I don't think it was worth the deforestation of a region in South America. I'm only kidding but it did cross my mind."
"Poured into a snifter. PSM pours a deep rich mahogany, if not almost black. Nice tan head on op, with a decent retention level. Mild lacing. Oaky, very sweet aromas, figs, plums, some dark spices, along with some dark fruits, vanilla, and caramel. Vanilla and caramel tastes up front. Not quite the flavor I expected from a brown ale, which sets this one from the rest. It almost starts like an oak aged imperial stout. Some bourbon as well. Mouthfeel is creamy, with a great carbonation level. Very complex palate. Extremely smooth for 12%. Very nice drinkability and its a sleeper. Absolute greatness which is expected when drinking DFH."
"A bit of warming alcohol, but not what you would expect for a 12% beer. The wood used here gives it a nice flavor, good effect. Medium body, with a fair enough amount of carbonation. Very nice."
"THIS IS A GREAT BEER!!! Good job by the guys at DFH."
"I might have to get more of this!"
"Medium-full in body. Thinner than expected, but in a good way. Incredibly smooth and creamy, but not thick, syrupy, or cloying. Awesome beer - a sipper that drinks way too easily. Excellent - try if you can."
"Poured from 12oz bottle from PP bottle shop. Poured a blackish brown color ( it looks black but when pouring the stream from the bottle to glass was more on the brown color) with a mocha colored head. Smell is mixture of the malt, carmel, yeast, and the wood aroma. Taste is vanilla, carmel, dark fruit, with slight coco flavor. Mouthfeel is great with a fullbody syrup mouthfeel without being to sweet and a nice low carbonation level. This beer is extremely drinkable for 12% with great full flavor. Great job Dogfish head."
"D - wow! Am I glad I bought 2 packs of this! Definitely a beer I will enjoy over the coming months, and one I'd like to ""cellar"" (I don't actually have a cellar) for next winter. Seriously, this is excellent. If you can get a hold of it, watch the DVD and enjoy one of these. One of the best DFH I've had in a long time for sure. Great work DFH! Totally worth the price."
"Drinkability is surprisingly very good. This is a very well crafted and interesting beer that is actually VERY easy to sip. Certainly a beer that is worth trying."
"Poured a very dark reddish brown with a thin mocha head that left an even thinner ring and some spotted lacing. Smells of coffee and chocolate with sweet malts and a little vanilla. Tasted of coffee with some earthy wood tones and a slight bitterness and tart bite. The mouthfeel was a little thick but flowed down silky and smooth. Overall this one is something to come back to on a regular basis and I wouldn't mind putting some down to see how they age."
"D - Very interesting. The woody flavor becomes more prominent as it warms."
"Drinkability: This stuff is great. Very rich in flavor, definately not a session brew, but I could sip my way through a few on a relaxing evening with good friends. I highly recommend this one... drink it now, and lay one down for a couple years."
"I also like the idea of releasing a DVD with the beer. Haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but it's a great idea and will hopefully provide some insight into the idea behind the beer and working with the wood fermentors. Definitely worth tracking down."
"I know they have a few at the local Anderson's Store in lima."
"Pours an inviting dark black color with a deep brown head that disappears rather quickly. Aroma of coffee, chocolate and nuts. Taste is like the aroma, but with some woody notes and dark fruits. Full-bodied and smooth; goes down well. A bit of tingle from the invisible carbonation. No noticeable alcohol in the taste or aroma, which is a big plus. This was a real joy to drink. Highly recommended."
"Everything about this one is unique. The wood gives sweet characteristics that complement the roastiness of the malts well in the nose as well as the taste."
"This is surprisingly smooth and a great beer but I probably won't drink it that often. I'm glad I only bought one 4 pack."
"Good stuff here. Wish I could afford to drink a case of these and wish I could handle more than two because of the abv."
"A very interesting brew for sure, would like to age a couple and see what happens."
"Overall- Sweet, creamy, and smooth. I could drink several of these!!"
"D- This beer seems very complex and full of flavors, none of which I really liked. It's quite different from any other beer I've had. Not sure I'd drink it again. For anyone who lkes a very earthy beer with a prevalent woody character, you may love it."
"I would highly recommend this beer."
"""if you have the means, I highly recommend one"" - ferris bueller"
"Deep, very dark bown in color. Somewhat foamy head. Woody, sweet smelling aroma. Strong, malty flavor with a deep and earthy flavor to it. There is a slight, spicey flavor I cannot pinpoint but I have tasted it before. The lingering sweetness/woody flavor is great. No visible trace of any alcohol. Very full and smooth body. Simply an amazing beer. I was so impressed when I first had this at the brewpub when it was a one off. To me the best beer DFH has done-period."
"Got mine at the Firehouse Liquors (that dude has some good ones) and he is selling 4 packs for $16.99 and singles for $4.95. I bought two so I could try one and cellar one for at least a year to see how they differ. Maybe longer. Supposedly it says you can age this one for up to 8 years. I am not so sure about that but with the dark malts and the 12% abv, I suppose it is possible and maybe worth a shot."
"Mouth feel is quite pleasant. Bubbles are light and body is filling without being over bearing. Really good finish. I'd never suspect 12% ABV."
"D - Reasonably drinkable for such a strong beer, though the flavors are quite heavy and I certainly do not feel like opening another bottle tonight. It is quite complex and well worth trying; one of Dogfish Head's more successful experiments."
"Eric"
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is about medium on the tongue, slightly creamy and alcohol is nowhere to be found except for slight warming. Drinkability is good. Alcohol is concealed well. Overall a good beer, not blown away by it. Kind of hard for me to pick out in definite wood character, maybe with some cellaring it will come out more."
"Pours black with a small pumpkin pie tan head that quickly recedes. Malty and sweet cola aroma, bourbony, roasty twang. Vanilla is soft and subtle but is stronger when agitated. Nice vanilla sweetness rolls over the tongue in the taste and mixes with the cola like sweetness. A bourbony warmth of alcohol comes on in the finish and blends nicely with a woody dryness. Mouthfeel is on the full side, thick and malty, slightly prickly carbonation and a good bite of alcohol and dryness at the back of the throat in the finish. A very good beer, definitely look forward to a couple of years on this one."
"Drinkability is hurt by the massive woody taste, I almost drain poured it but finished it anyway. No way I want another one. I'll be looking to trade the 3 I have left."
"It's medium bodied, with low carbonation. Very easy to drink - it goes down smoothly. A very interesting beer."
"D: Obviously, the wood aging is a bit overboard for me. How 'bout some subtlety?"
"I could suck this one down in minutes, i am trying to restrain myself since i have to drive somewhere after this one beer. I need to seek out more of these.. this is my favorite DFH beer to date."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Good, creamy, rich, and thick mouthfeel dominate this beer, with a decent drinkability that only took a slight hit due to the very hefty 12% ABV, which was very well masked behind a rich conglomeration of sweet, unique flavors... Very good stuff... Another winner from Dogfish... Definitely recommended..."
"Once again, Dogfish Head has created a beer that wine lovers would turn their heads towards. I would love to cellar this beer for a year just to see what happens. I could just sense that the woody notes of the beer would creep even closer to the top!"

"I've never had a 4-pack to come wiht a CD before. I thought I was getting a deal with Left Hand 6-packs with the free sticker. Our homebrew club recently brewed an Imperial Brown and aged it in a Four Roses Bourbon Barrel for the '08 NHC. Interesting to compare the differences. This beer surely qualifies for a Double Brown without loosing any balance, falling into Porter or Stout territory. A nice chocolaty, nutty flavor with a hearty helping of malt, sweetness, and berry-like esters. Good hopping rates give the beer a grassy, piney flavor while offsetting the heavy sweetness. The wood gives a well-roundness to the flavors, but don't give a whole lot of wood flavor or astringency. Quite delicate in it's balance, despite a dominant alcohol (ethanol)taste and slightly harsh textures, but does thin the weighted brew a bit. Surprised to see a fizzy head formation that didn't last any time at all, nor did the carbination -- strange for DFH."
"The four pack came with a DVD glued to the side. I almost didn't see it."
"D: It doesn't get much more drinkable for a 12% brew. If I had much more, I'd have another but I want to save and savor these."
"I can't wait to age these (that sounds dumb). I will get more to drink now as well. Last summer I made a pilgrimage ot Rehoboth Beach. I need to find another excuse to do that so I can taste some of this on tap. Wonderful."
"D- This is a nice strong brown ale. I am not sure I could have it all the time but it is tasty."
"palo santo marron has just been released in bottles as well as on tap at the brewpub in rehoboth. It is served in the 8 oz. snifter and pours a deep dark brown to black with a little amber quality. The smell is very earthy and very sweet with some chocolate notes and the dark roasted malts. The taste is very good but unusual. You can definitely taste the wood in the beer. It is described as an epic brown ale and it does just that. The mouthfeel is pretty thick and a little creamy. The drinkability hurts a little due to the weight and size of this beer. Dogfish keeps it coming with the craft beer and I am always blown away by their creativity."
"This one was hard to find only 10 cases came to Athens! Had this beer at Trappeze Pub! The appearance was impressive for a 12% abv. it had a decent size head with some patchy lacing. The nose had rich woodsy smell with dark fruity undertones. The taste was really smooth for being so high in alcohol,which gave the brew a sherry like quality. Caramelized apples and light notes of sherrywood and spice really add to the complexity. The mouthfeel was solid but not extremely silky for being oak aged. The drinkabilty is great for a night cap! This one will sneak up on ya!"
"D - Get out your finest glass, serve slightly warm and call it a nightcap. Thats what im doing right now. This beer is wonderful. Certainly one of the more interesting brews i have ever been able to sample."
"The thick and creamy mouthfeel give way to flavors of dark sweet chocolate malts (especially on the front), vanilla, light sweet dried fruit, strong coffee, and a mild smokiness I imagine was imparted by the Palo Santo barrels. There's a heck of a lot going on here, and the best way to experience it is through a not-too-cold tasting. As it warmed the flavors became even more intense and the balance shifted slightly. I wish it weren't quite so carbonated, but that's a pet peeve I have with too many ales to complain too bitterly!"
" Which is fine with me, but may make this one harder to down for some."
"I'm glad I scarfed up the last few 4-packs I could find around here in South Jersey. I found a bonus - on the 4-pack itself was a DVD where the folks at DFH explain what went ito the making of this brew."
"D: Very good. The alcohol presence was virtually non-existant making this one quite drinkable."
"I have to disagree in calling this a brown ale. First of all, the beer poured a thick, black color with a thin, dark head into a 12-oz pilsner glass. The smell was of caramel, currants, roasted malt, and just a hint of vanilla. The appearance and smell were more in line with a stout (an Imperial stout, I guess, due to the 12% ABV). The initial taste was of sweet caramel malt, thick and viscous, transitioning into a very full-bodied toasted malt and alcohol finish - very ""stout-ish"". Very smooth and balanced for a 12% ABV brew - possibly the smoothest high alcohol beer I've ever had. I can't honestly say I could pick out the contribution the Palo Santo wood made to the beer, but this is a great brew nonetheless, even if the style categorization seems to be wrong."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and extremely smooth. Carbonation is excellent. It is strong at 12%. I probably wouldn't drink more than one or two in a sitting. But, it's extremely drinkable. Definitely not hard to put away. Overall, this is a damn fine beer. Very unique. I would strongly suggest picking it up while you have the chance."
"This is an intensely special beer and one should take the time to enjoy it. Like most Dogfish Head brews, it's expensive but worth a try. Next time I have one, it will be at cellar temp. I hope this will bring out more of the subtle flavors."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 2/11/08. Served in a Dogfish Head snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. The aroma is great and very unique. I assume the stronger part of the aroma (since it's something that's not familiar to me) is from the Palo Santo wood. I can also smell some vanilla, toffee, and cream. The taste of this beer is just all over the place. With each sip it seems like I can taste something different. I can taste wood, chocolate, toffee, vanilla, roasted malt, molasses, coffee, dark fruit and little bit of booze. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy, coating and a little bit slick. Drinkability is pretty good too, it's smooth and it doesn't seem like a beer that's 12% ABV. I don't think I could drink more than a couple of these at a time, but it's very enjoyable. This is one of the better (and most unique) beers I've had in a while. I definitely recommend this, get some if you can!"
"Music enjoyed whilst sampling: He's Back by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones"
"Age has softened and smoothed this beer, bringing out the deep, fragrant wood, earthy, spicy and mildly tannic. The base beer has held up pretty well too with just a touch of oxidation (unfortunately mildly papery). Some buckwheat honey. The palate opens with caramel and cocoa before segueing into  burnt toffee, buckwheat honey, earth and spice. Really, really impressive stuff. 4/4.25/4/4.5/4.25"
"This is a good beer. A damn good beer in fact. Mouth coating with maybe the longest finish I've had in a brew. It just sticks with you and stays and stays and stays and...well you get the picture. Very rich and creamy. Tastes nearly like it smells with very litte in way of the wood used. Not sure how much of the wood could really infuse the beer anyway being a 10,000 gallon barrel. Gooey brown sugar with rummy raisins, roasted almost burnt malts, date, black fig, plums and nutty berry like middle. A damn good beer however this one is so big and rich it could take quite awhile to drink one let alone more. With age in the bottle I see that changing."
"D- Not so drinkable 1 maybe 2 beers a sitting. I drank it by itself thought maybe if paired with food if maybe the taste and drinkability would increase"
"It's pretty drinkable and would be far better if it didn't have the odd mouthfeel."
"d: I sampled the first batch at the Rehoboth Beach brewpub in the fall of '06. I remember tasting a lot of wood, vanilla, and booze. It wasn't bad then, but whatever changes they made are a huge improvement. I love DFH for their willingness to experiment. It doesn't always work, but this is certainly a success."
"The beer poured a brownish black color with a thick tan head. The nose of the beer was a soothing toasted malty aroma. There was also a touch of coco in the nose. The beer had a full body and the taste gives you more of the strong malty backbone which is very pleasing. With the abv at about 14% this is a ver strong beer but Mike did a great job of melding the taste profile with the high abv. It does not at all overpower the last. Although I didn't get much of a woody taste from the rare wood that it was aged on, it is still an enjoyable beer and if you are lucky enough to come across this at a DFH event, get yourself some."
"I had the pleasure of stopping into the Rehoboth bar and finding this gem on tap. Deep reddish brown in color and peppery to the taste. The GM was on scene and showed me a sample of the paolo santo wood that they age the beer with. Odd looking South American hardwood with a blue tint that gave the beer the peppery taste I mentioned. The taste was excellent and drinkability was good enough to drink 2 or 3 of them. At 12% abv you may not want to drink more than that. Those small snifters pack a wallop. Limited edition beer not available for carry out so stop into the bar while it lasts!"
"A little too heavy and sweet for me. Perhaps a smaller glass would have been better."
"Finished with a sharp alcohol bite. Lost some drinkability due to the bite, but it was still very tasty. Think it would be perfect for aging if bottled. Doesn't seem like any brown ale I've ever had."
"Overall this is another different, unique creation from DFH. The abv snuck up on me and that made it a 3.5 instead of a 4.0. You don't smell or taste the alcohol, but you feel it. This was a good one, so hurry up and get some before it's gone."
