"O- one of the more flavorful brown ales that I’ve had in a while, sweet, malty & nutty as a brown ale should be"
""
""
"Had on draft well balanced great taste"
"It is a very average brown ale. It tastes like beer but is nothing special."
""
""
"Overall- Excellent brew, first time drinking this and it won't be the last."
"Overall- A mediocre brown ale. Could use more complexity and balance as far as the malt goes. So-so"

"best head i've had on an ""american brown ale"".  perfect hopping."

"In Pop!ping the cap, I released a bunch of gas and even the bottle gave off a hissing noise. I had a feeling as to what this might mean, but I began a heavy-handed pour anyway. It was not long before the glass began filling with foam and I had to back off in order to allow it to settle. I am going to be frank here and say that due to its overcarbonation, I was irritated and impatient, neither of which are conducive to a positive review. It finally settled into two fingers of dense, soapy, light-tan head with good retention. Color was Brown to Dark Brown (SRM = > 22, "

"Poured copper-brown with a foamy head that lingered very well; smell was that of caramel and just a hint of chocolate or cocoa. Mouthfeel rather thin for the style. The taste was more bitter than I had expected, and rather flat; I wonder if perhaps this bottle was past it's prime (I couldn't find an ""enjoy by"" date). Since I can't get Duck-Rabbit in my state, it may be a while before I try this one again, but I'll definitely give it a go with a sample that's known to be fresh."

"Overall/Drinkability:  A very interesting combo of strong malts and bittering hops. Tasty, but didn't pair well with pizza. Still, full flavored and I look forward to another. Interestingly, one per evening for me with this one."
""
""
"The bottle claimed something to the effect of ""dark beer specialists", so I had my hopes up. I was not disappointed. The beer pours out a beautiful, clear ruddy brown with a nice cap of creamy tan head. It clings to the glass and leaves nice lacing. Aroma-wise this one is spot-on. Dark caramel and roasted nuts play off each other with just a little hint of earthy hops to round it out. Flavor-wise, this one is great. The hops take a more dominant role but the balance becomes much better and enjoyable. There's a little bit of fizz from the carbonation but it has a nice weight to it and is mostly smooth on the palate. An under-appreciated style, frequently butchered. This is just about perfect."

"Overall: The beer looks great, smells great, Tastes, pretty good, and overall, I'd consider it good to go. Not something I'd typically drink, but pretty good. I'd buy it again."
""
"D) An alright brown ale. This is my second attempt at trying this brown ale in hopes of improvement. I wish the body was a little bit heavier and the taste profile would last longer."

"Overall, it has a pleasant, bold, malty flavor with a nice, soft balance with the hops/alcohol. Taste-wise, I could have a couple in a sitting, but it's more of a one-a-day beer."
""
""
"The beer foamed when I poured from the bottle to my glass. The head was dense and took a long time to receed. The color is a brown, and the beer has a slight opacity to it. I could smell hops, but only faintly and nothing else. I tasted more hops than I expected, but then again this is an American Brown and not an English Brown. There was roasted malt to balance the hops. No alcohol burn, which was what I expected."

"I poured this okay beer into my tumbler at 40 degrees. The beer poured a pretty nice head, mahogany colored it was pretty. Pretty nice head also. The beer was slightly hoped at the finish not too bad and the beer had a bit of a bitter finish . Not going to buy again as it was just not GREAT."
""

""

"Overall: This is a very surprising brown ale. It has such a pronounced level of smokiness to it, a level found more in porters or stouts or rauchbiers rather than a brown ale, that it was completely surprising, and at first, off-putting. However, once I realized that the smokiness was the beers predominate flavor profile, I found the beer to be quite pleasant."

"Overall this is a really tasty ale and at a relatively low abv you could have a couple. The nutty taste is fantastic, one of the best brown ales I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer had a tremendous amount of head that was off-white with a a tinge of brown. The beer had a malty aroma with a hint of toffee. Tastes malty and finishes dry. There is a low amount of hop flavor but a good amount of bitterness that hits you upfront and lingers. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side. Definitely worth trying."

"Great sweet nutty malty aromas - slight hop bitterness. taste is mild sweet chocolatey malt, slightly nutty, and a nice dose of bitter hop flavor. Its a tad bitter but otherwise super easy to drink. My first DR brew...really nice."
"Dark brown in color with a heavy amber hue a slight haze. Poured with a huge beige foam that slowly reduced to a thick cap that left random sticky lacings on the glass. Sweet dark chocolate, black patent malt and black coffee aromas. Medium bodied with assertive carbonation. Burn malt and intense coffee flavors are prominent. Floral hop flavors blossom through the middle to the end. Finishes with sweet dark chocolate on the edges with bitter dark ground coffe down the middle. Fairly intense flavor for a brown ale."

"This is a very good brown ale. Had a lot more flavor than I expected. Had a stronger hop flavor than most brown ales I've had which I thought was very interesting. I was surprised that I like so much. Overally a very good beer! I look for this now everytime I'm out..."

"not much to say about this beer too much head a beauiful beer in a glass but overall i got nothing to say new or maybe old about this beer its does nothing for me so drink and enjoy and read other reviews about this beer fall short for me cat wait to tryother duck rabbit beers but this one does nothing for me"

"picked this one up during a mix six run back in december . glad it didn't go bad in the bottle . poured from the bottle into a mug. nice amber color with a fluffy head. aroma is a bit strong .the roasted chocolate is nice part of this particular brew. makes me wish that it was easier to find beer from this brewery."
""
""
""
"O - A decent brown ale, Not super outstanding, but good to have more than one of."
"Overall – A fairly nice, not too sweet, brown ale that is a little more on the bitter and dry side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Five sips in, I didn't like it at all. It grew on me and I actually had to go back and change some of the ratings. A good beer, not great. I'd get it again in a mixed six-pack or on draft at a bar, but not a sixer or case."
""
""
""
""
""
"Darker amber pour, with a small tan head that receded to a ringlet; moderate lacing. Roasty malts in the nose, cocoa, grassy hops. Taste of caramel malts, sugar sweetness, cardboard, toasted grains, grassy hops for a decent bittering balance. Light-medium body. Decent, but not memorable. Not really my style."
"O: Very easy to drink and quite enjoyable - I really enjoy the coffee flavors from the roasting that sneak into the middle of the taste. Alcohol is well hidden and I could easily put a few of these down in a session."
""
"O: Aroma aside, this is at best an unexceptional brown ale ... disappointing from the ""dark beer specialist"". QC issues at work?"
""
""
"I didn't take to this initially but it has a really admirable flavour and complexity. Found it a bit to bitter, and the hops can be a bit powerful here. Nevertheless it has a lot of interesting things going on and it worth trying. A really interesting interpretation."

"Overall a great brown ale that was full of complex flavors and easy to drink. Malts, hops, nutty and sweet accents all add up to a stellar beer that was highly drinkable and a leader in this class."

"brown ales are usually pretty simple, session beers. this is a little generous on the abv for the style, and way tastier than most. definitely liking this one!"
"Overall: I wonder if my sample was off or from a bad batch? I only had one bottle of this, but it doesn't inspire me to try another one. Others descripe this as highly carbonated, but mine was almost completely flat, like a real ale. Well, the bottle doesn't have a marked date on it, so who knows -- I'll just have to review it as I got it, which is to say as a very bad beer, most of it ended up going down the drain."

"O: This is in my top three brown ales. Definitely the best smelling brown I have found. IMO the smell of the beer is almost half of the experience. Go grab this beer if you can."
""
""
""
"Thanks to tone77 for this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Medium body and solid carbonation this could be sipped or drank with more haste. Very drinkable and highly enjoyable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Nice roasted malt notes upfront followed by a nice hit of earthy hops, baking chocolate, freshly ground medium roast coffee and a lingering but not overpowering bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy and really works well with the beer. Drinkability is insane. One of the best browns I've ever had."
""
""
"Taste has a bitter, punchent bite as well as coffee notes. There is a roast burnt flavor that I don't care for and ruins it for me."
""
""
""
"Sorry to be negative but I didn't care for it at all."
""

"O: Pleasant & enjoyable"

"D - This is a good beer. It's flavor isn't as great as the smell, but still... It is nice. I wouldn't mind having this again."
""
""
""
""
"This is a rather complex brown ale. The flavors are so well blended and yet distinct that each sip reveals a new subtlety. This is a brown ale I'll go back to."
"O: A decent brown. May be a tad bit too bitter for my preference in browns these days, but it's appropriately within the style."

"Overall this a very nice brown ale that I would definitely revisit. I would prefer a little less carbonation and smoother mouthfeel."
"O – Really like this brew. Has the nice roasty sweetness of a nice brown ale that moves over to finish with a nice bitter bite. Nice drinkable brew."
"Solid body, long finish with lingering flavors of toffee malts."
"Overall nice beer, taste is just a touch not sweet enough for my taste is browns."
"O- Nothing spectacualr about this brown. It's not that it's bad, but a bit too hoppy and heavy on the carbonation. Decent sipping brown. Wouldn't turn one down, but a little of a letdown-"
"not sure if this was a singular issue or what, but yikes, not a fan if not"
"O: A big and thick brown ale for sure. Heavy on the dark roast flavors and light on the sweetness and carbonation."
"O – A very nice brown ale balanced on the roastier side of the style."
"Great brown ale, not to sweet and very drinkable."
"Overall Impression: More roasty than the average brown ale, but it's still well put together. Not extremely drinkable, but it's not a terrible thing. It starts to wear on you due to the strong roastiness and heavy aftertaste. Couldn't imagine drinking more than one of these in a single sitting. One bottle drank slowly is very enjoyable, almost reminds me of enjoying a fine cigar."
"O: A standard, hoppier brown ale. Looks nice. Not bad overall."
"D/O- I'm not so sure this bottle wasn't infected. Tried reading through some of the ""low"" reviews and some claimed the same issues...HUGE head, acidity, etc. So for now, this review stands. If I acquire another bottle and find it to be different I'll update accordingly."
"Color is a dark brown, but when held to light there is a reddish hue all the way through. The huge tan head lasts a long time, fading to a disc by the end, and leaves quite a bit of lacing. Scents of coffee and citrus were detected upon opening, but a bit on the weak side. Hops dominated the taste - a slight malty cocoa up front, which quickly changes to floral and grapefruit rind notes. Not overly bitter, but quite flavorful. The mouthfeel was noticeably lacking - really quite thin and watery. Enjoyed the taste, but this could be a much better beer with improved mouthfeel."
"Overall, a very drinkable brown ale, but with how much I loved their Rabid Duck RIS, I was expecting it to be a little bit better. The flavors are nice, but nothing out of this world, and the mouthfeel is a tad thin. I also wish the bitterness was dialed back a bit. A solid brew, but nothing special."
"Overall pretty good, very drinkable brown."
"D-Overall this brew was very good and solid. Nothing flshy about this brew but a super solid brown ale. If im ever in the mood for a brown ale id grab for this one. Not gonna nock ur socks off but solid"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, a bit nutty. Taste has hops, caramel, a bit of nuttiness, finishing with considerable bitterness. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality brew."
"Thinner than expected, but nice medium body. Overall, a very interesting and enjoyable beer."
"O: A+ Love this beer and could drink it all day. Highly recommended. Absolutly lovley."
"Chocolate and earthy smell. Poured in a pint glass, good half in beige head. Good hoppy bitter taste with some good smokey but not as bitter as I would have really liked. Clean finish. I don't feel like I could drink more than two at a sitting. Refreshing but not crisp. First time I tried this brewery and I look forward to trying some of their heavier beers."
"To me, this is a situation where the brewer went above and beyond, hopping up this already solid brown ale and creating something that's true to the style and also unique. I'll be back for more."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I enjoyed this beer more than I had expected since I tend to find most brown ales relatively undistinguished. In this case each sip followed easily from the prior one and the beer was too soon gone. I’ll certainly be happy to have this one again and am looking forward to trying it some evening with burgers from the grill. My overall impression is of good, well made beer with some features that distinguish it from the run of the mill browns and justifies giving it a good score."
"Overall impression: Great beer, one that makes you rethink the possibilities of the humble brown ale."
"O: this is a good brown ale. if available around here I would recommend it"
"A very complex, very different brown ale. Interesting components, but they all work nicely. Really enjoyed this beer."
"o: A pleasant surprise overall. Not that I didn't expect this to be good, I just didn't expect so much assertive bitterness."
"O: This was the poster child for brown ales of the dark, toasty variety, but other than that, there was really nothing memorable about this one."
"Overall this could quite possibly be the best American Brown Ale out there. A great beer from a great brewery."
"O - a very good example of the style."
"Duck Rabbit usually makes really good brews. I picked up this one after the 2010 ACBF once I got back home. After having several good brews from Duck Rabbit there I thought for sure this would follow in it's footsteps. Something didn't go to plan. I found the taste of this beer to be a bit off. I can't really put my finger on it either. The appearance was great, great looking mahogany color with little shades of red. The aroma was nice too but the flavor to me was just not quite right."
"Drinkability is good for me, but it's a little unbalanced in places I think. I could have this again and wouldn't complain but I think I know I would go for something else if I had the choice."
"Overall: A very solid American brown ale. The label reads ""beautifully bitter", and it is. Really well done. Worth trying!!!"
"Pours a clear reddish brown, thin cream colored head, couple of rings of lace. Smell: fig, plum, apple skin, caramelized sugars, mildly leafy and earthy. Taste: caramelized sugars, sweet and tangy plum, earthy and herbal hopping. Not a whole lot going on, but nice. Medium bodied with a creamy feel. Best by 4/2011."
"Overall I thought it was a disappointing offering from DR as I absolutely LOVE the amber an milk stout"
"Overall an exquisite brown ale with tons of flavor, tasting so good it leaves you wanting more..."
"Tough one to grade."
"D: This is enjoyable, but a bit hamstrung by how bitter it is. The bitterness isn't bad, but it overshadows the maltiness of a beer style that's supposed to feature it fairly prominently. A solid, if unbalanced, brown ale."
"M/D - Lively carbonation and medium bodied with a good balance of flavors. The nose doesn't do this beer justice. I really dig the drinkability of this beer and would be happy to have a few in an evening, but could see the flavor getting old if you were to drink a few."
"D: Decent drinkability as it goes down easily and there's nothing hampering that, but there isn't enough going on/what's going on isn't enjoyable enough to keep me wanting more."
"(55th)"
"i probably need to revisit this beer sometime if i can land it again... its rather intriguing, i just cant give a wholly formal review."
"Cheers!"
"I had this a Village Whisky, home of the best burger in the world...but I digress. Duck Rabbit was proudly poured in my pint, with a nice brown and off white head that had nice lacing. It has a decent nose, full of chocolate, caramel, nuts, etc. Some sweetness up front, but finished OK, not great. The hops were there but not much of presence as I expected."
"I really want to love Duck-Rabbit, cuz when they are on they are great, but the quality control issues really need to be dealt with, but this has been going on for a few years so we'll just see..."
"D - This was just an average brown ale...all the characteristics were there...the nut flavor was just a little too pronounced for me"
"Poured into a pint glass. Pour brings a brown colored beer with a bit of amber in there. Off white head that starts out with two fingers slowly recedes. Not too much lacing. The nose is some caramel, toffee, bread, and nuts. The taste is mostly some slight bread with a bit of caramel dressing. Good feel with a bit of sweetness. Drinks fairly well, but is a bit ordinary."
"D: This has a nice flavor but the hypercarbonation keeps it from being very good."
"D: Goes down alright, the bitter chocolate and citrus could be blended a bit better. Not too filling, decent kick, ok representation of style. I'd opt for other brown ales, but wouldn't turn this one away."
"Overall: This is a nice American Brown Ale. I would recommend trying this one out if you haven't yet. Another solid offering from Duck-Rabbit."
"d- this wasnt the first brown ale ive had but its the first that made me want to try more brown ales. wish i could get this back home"
"D- A very drinkable brown that has a different to me and my American palate leafy green hop note, which I find adorable."
"D. This did not taste as smoothi as other brown ales. The more I drink duck rabbit the more i want to make the trip out to Farmville."
"The taste is bigger than expected from the smell, with a complex malty base that stands out pretty well. Bread crust and a very slight candy (chocolate, caramel, toffee) flavor are swirling around as well. There is a bitter hop edge underneath all this. The mouth feel is thick enough to give this beer a full body as well. Overall a good beer and certainly better than expected, for some reason."
"Lots of carbonation with this one out of the bottle. However, I managed to contain everything in the glass. :} Once things settled down a bit - this dark amber-brown brew has a nice light hoppy aroma. Medium mouthfeel. This one has a fruity-bittering hop presence on the first sip. The finish is wonderfully roasty, almost a bit of chocolate too that lingers for a long time. Next sip is then sweet on the top side, bitter in the middle and roasty again. This is one rather complex, but very drinkable and enjoyable brown ale. Thanks to Glid02 for this one."
"Its a good beer, but it needs to have the carbonation issue worked out a bit and it would be much better"
"I might have to re-rate this at a later time."
"D - based on the taste, I am not sure I'd seek this out again."
"Some stellar drinking here, impressive flavor profiles from the malt and hops yet still very sessionable. Duck-Rabbit raise the benchmark a few notches in the American Brown Ale style with this one."
"Poured a dark brown body with massive head on top of a light but solid malt smell: dark chocolate, roasted, bread, hints of coffee, toffee; also some bitter hops in background. The taste is similiar to aroma as a smooth, medium body and slight creaminess passes over the tongue leaving both a residual sweetness from dark chocolate and caramel and there is a dry edge that is bready. Some minor sweet and citric hops in backbite lend themselves to the crisp finish. Good balance although I prefer browns w/ a lil' less hoppiness and more sweetness."
"Cheers!"
"Clear reddish-brown in color with a full frothy head. Smells good with a strong roasted grain character and some chocolate and toffee. Taste is unique and delicious. Toffee and roasted malts are balanced nicely with floral and grassy hop flavors. Finish is a little dry. I certainly could put down a couple of these. A nice approach to the style and a good all-around ale."
"very drinkable."
"Poured into a Duck-Rabbit pint glass. Big bulky beige head 1 1/2 inches. Nice amber brown with beautiful marble lacing along the sides of the glass. A thin head remains throughout no matter how long it sits(very nice). It has the inviting smell of a box of fine Belgium chocolates. A slightly bitter taste with a mixture of sweet gourmet mocha coffee. Much more character and spunkiness than your typical brown ale and a bit heavier too. I must say that this is my favorite local brewery and 99% of the time they can do no wrong but also it is a bit high priced. You should not have to take out a loan to buy a six pack. I only live right down the road. That should at least eliminate some shipping cost, am I right?"
"The beer pours a rusty brown, with ruby highlights when backlit. The toffee head is absolutely massive and rocky. Retention and lacing are both out of this world, probably the best looking brown ale I've ever seen. Despite that, the nose is a little weak and especially the promised hoppiness suffers. The flavor is much better, caramel and biscuity malts, with just a hint of roasted chocolate. Grapefruit from the amarillo is a wonderful touch on the back end, and a brief spicy flourish from the Saaz closes things out nicely. I had worries about the carbonation given the mountainous amount of head that foamed up from my pour, but it was surprisingly restrained. The body was just a little bit thin though. Duck Rabbit nailed almost everything about this beer, I can only hope they expand their distribution more to the northeast."
"D- The palate is skewed too much towards the hop (bitterness) for the style... which becomes an overwhelming factor halfway through the bottle. The drinkability suffers accordingly."
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer."
"I tried looking at other reviews to see if others had the same experience with this beer that I did, and what I conclude is that a majority of tasters also tasted the same acidity that I taste. So this is likely not a contamination or defect, but just how the beer is. Also, because the beer didn't gush or smell sour, I don't think it's spoiled, just not good."
"Drinkability: Actually very surprising and tastey that puts up a nice little fire, but doesn't put out the warmth. Did satisfy for an ale."
"Nicely drinkable, though not the greatest brown out there. Distinctive, but never over-the-top, I can imagine it perfectly complementing barbecue ribs with hash and rice."
"D- that taste that I'm not liking...its really getting to me and making me not want to drink anymore, but I will because I'm a trooper. I'd be willing to try this again to see if this bottle was an anomaly...but that almost metallic bitterness...ugh."
"I have yet to have a Duck Rabbit beer that I didn't like, and this one is no exception. I have to admit that I expected this one to be a little more malty, but it is a pretty good brown ale."
"Drinkability: This is a solid brew that would be a great session beer in the shoulder months. The subtle hop presence balances the crafty use of malts. I am a fan!"
"D: This is a nice easy-drinking beer even for warmer days. It is not overpowering and I could easily have another."
"Good, drinkable brown ale - caseworthy to say the least. If you see it, grab it - good sh!t..."
"Drinkability: A very nice, sessionable brown here. Unoffensive and easy going."
"This is a unique flavored brown ale, and a good change of pace. I find this to be complex and drinkable and hits a nice balance in the flavor department to make this very sessionable. I am very surprised by its bitterness - it works excellent. Good stuff."
" D- There is a weird blend of citrus earthy hops and roasted malts. The chocolate and lemon are odd with a tartness that is almost lactic but a bit more charred malt. This beer is a bit like eating dessert after brushing your teeth. The flavors really fight against each other."
"D - a little bitter for the style in my opinion. there are many brown ales I find more drinkable"
"Overall, an odd beer. The style is more like an Old English Porter. I guess as it warmed up it got a little interesting and grew on me, but along with the other stuff I've had from Duck Rabbit in the past month I probably won't seek anything else out from them."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly creamy. It's a pretty drinkable beer, I enjoyed it and it went down pretty easy. it had some good flavors and very good head retention that definitely made it a more enjoyable beer to drink."
"D = I don't know, I find this too unpalatable to really say it's drinkable. I can imagine people whose primary enjoyment of beer being the hops aromas and flavors feeling otherwise. Still, this is a measure of how drinkable I find it and I just can't give it high marks. Overall and average beer. I wouldn't turn it down, but there are many, many beers, including most other Duck-Rabbit beers I would chose before it."
"Not sure I'd want 3 or 4 in a row, but on a cold winter day -- nothing better!"
"I would try this beer again since I like hoppy brown ales and think this beer has a lot of potential when consumed fresh."
"The cask and hand pump left an incredibly smooth but very flat and thin mouthfeel. All things considered: flat taste, sour bitterness, it is a highly drinkable beer for this style."
"HV"
"I poured this beer from the bottle into a pint glass. The color of the beer is a redish brown. It had about 2 fingers of head that went away very fast. The aroma is sweet with the smell of carmel, malt, and notes of butterscotch. There is a small to medium amount of lacing. The taste is bitter compared to the smell. It has a malty, hoppy, roasted flavor with lots of carbonation that tickles and foams in the mouth. The after taste is very hoppy. This is a decent brown ale but the hoppiness of it is a surprise because the smell is so sweet."
"D-Not a beer I'd rush out to get, but I might try it if the opportunity to get some that was a little fresher came about."
"Overall, I was a bit disappointed with this brew. Despite being from North Carolina, this was the first Duck Rabbit offering I'd tried and I was slightly let down. It was a unique take on the style, but just tasted a little off to me. I still look forward to seeking out some more brews from Duck Rabbit, though."
"Two fingers of loose foam, light tan in color, dimples as the bubbles quickly pop, most of the lacing slides away easily. Dark brown-red brick in color, the zinc orange starts to show around the rims, fairly clear for its level of darkness. The nose is decidedly malty but in no way overly sweet, mineral water and straw bundle notes pair up with cocoa, chocolate powder, good cherry to red grape fruit scents, cornbread, pecan shells, stays lively without seeking attention. Medium-bodied, the carbonation has it cresting early in the mouth but isn't disguising any flaws or such. Caramel, milk chocolate, carob, coffee bean, dry and dusty but deep. Has that same metallic mineral ring to it, like organic in feel. Cherry, white grape, apricot fruit flavors. Pinch of nutmeg or allspice. Finishes with elevating bitterness and hard to peg why. Enjoyable enough but nothing especially noteworthy."
"D - In my opinion, the high carbonation creates a barrier between me & an otherwise perfectly enjoyable beer; it just seems off. Other than that, it's easy enough to drink."
"12oz bottle picked up in NC last weekend. The beer is darkly clear, a translucent reddish brown color with a thick frothy foam that laces into solid chunks on the glass. It smells just the way I want a brown ale to, roasted malts and a little chocolate, not so much of the hops from the label (""hoppy and beautifully bitter""). The beer tastes much hoppier than it smells. The spicy hops (maybe saaz) are a nice counterpoint to the rich malts, very well done. I'd like more sweetness from the malts, but they present more with roasted bitterness. A nice lingering bitterness in the aftertaste, more from hops than malts I'd guess. A well done beer but probably my least favorite of the line-up so far."
"overall a solid hoppy brown ale...which is what its supposed to be..spot on.."
"Not a bad drinker -- another beer that, for me, promised more in the aroma than it delivered in the taste, but I could see getting cozy with this one & having a few over cards or something."
"Drinkability: Just a fine and well-balanced beer that is slightly filling. I would gladly enjoy more of these, especially as an afterdinner kind of drink."
"Drinkability is very good. Brewed for mass quantities, nice flavors, looks good. Would probably be even better on tap. I would like to see this, Legend Brown or Low Down Brown as replacements for Newcastle at bars and restaurants."
"D: Pretty drinkable and definitely interesting."
"pours a clear cherry mahogany body with a small beige head that lasts a few minutes. Minimal patches of lace are left on the glass. Aroma features citrusy hops, chocolate malt, and some hazelnut. Mouthfeel is light medium bodied with more carbonation than expected. Taste has grapefruit and pine cone hops, chocolate malt, and lots of roasted, almost burnt, malt bitterness. Nice touch of nuttiness that tastes like hazelnuts. Finishes with a pine hops bitterness that is fleeting. I would estimate the abv. to be around 5%, but it's not noticed. A nicely executed brown ale that is quite tasty and pleasantly drinkable."
"D: A very good but not great American brown due to the medicinal bitterness that taints the overall impression."
"Bottle, best by 12/9. Pours a nice dark brown color with 1/4 head. I love brown ales with some hoppiness and this is one of those browns. Just the right balance of malt and hops. Slightly overcarbonated which lowers the mouthfeel score, I would love to try this on tap. In keeping with reviewing only beers fresh from NC, this is a top ribbon getter in the state fair."
"12 ounce bottle, best by December 2009. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a brown/red color with an inch and half tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is toffee, spicy hops, chocolate, nuts and bread/grain. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like bready malt, spicy and earthy hops, nuts, caramel and chocolate. Good balance between the malty and hoppy flavors. Mouthfeel/body is light, but it's also a bit coating and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. This is one of the hoppier brown ales I've had, and it was a nice surprise. I could have this as an occasional session beer, I thought it was a good overall brew."
"l"
"It drinks like an average brown: heavier than the alcohol justifies, and too little of what makes craft beers crafty. I got this selection as a single from Total Wine, and it's been upright in a normal refrigerator since I bought it. Still, almost anything that blows up over the countertop takes a hit on the drinkability standard."
"Review from notes taken on: 7/23/09"
"Pours a dark brown, earthy color. Decent light brown head, good retention and lacing. Smell is off roasted malts and piny and spicy hops, hints of carmel, nuts and fruit. Taste is very piney and woodsy hop forward, spicy and bitter. Hides the roasted malts that typically stand out in a brown ale. Medium bodied, slightly over carbonated for a brown ale, very bitter bite that lingers a little too long in the palate. Not my favorite brown ale, give me a traditional malt forward one instead."
"Haven't had many Brown's yet, but this one I could drink all night compared to some others I've had."
"Don't drink and review."
"I almost finished it."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I'm really starting to appreciate Duck Rabbit more and more."
"This was well worth a try, and I really enjoyed the beer, but my personal preference is a little more malt and a little less hops."
"D - An ""OK"" beer. Not particularly memorable, but worth trying. I could easily put back a few of these."
"Pours a good moderately dark brown with some very nice head (too much, really) and decent lacing. Nice deep scent, malty and dark with hints of sweetness (crystal malt?); could've been deeper, but was still nice. Very good flavor, a nice deep ale, good malt thickness, slight nutty flavor, sweet finish with a very nice American hop bite mixed in. Well balanced and very smooth."
"A great beer, but for the style, it seems a bit off."
"Pours a nice brown with a huge tannish head. After letting it warm for some time, it is quite nutty. Not overly so, but clearly present. Seems to be a bit out of whack with what almost seems like an alcohol burn? Odd. Still though, pretty workable. Feel is standard. Fairly easy to drink. But I am not sure if this is how it was intended and will try again in the future when I have the chance."
"D: Easy going down, but not sure I would buy this regularly even if it were available.. good, but not great."
"12 oz. Pretty dark brown pour, large off white head. I thought this was one of the best brown ales I've had in a long time. Aroma reminds me more of a porter, malt, roast and nut, a little more floral. Taste also reminds me of a porter, but more nutty. Slightly more maltiness. Light/medium body, maybe just a bit too much carbonation, same as with their porter. Very balanced, not blown away by nut, tea or old sock qualities. A good drinker, if you're in the mood for a brown."
"Nicely drinkable. Not among the best browns I've ever had, but still good."
"Stronger roasted malts & good hops. The bitter roasted malt flavor lingers again after the hopiness dies down. Some chocolate notes. This one packs a flavorful punch."
"It's a bit of a different take on the style but definitely worth a try. I've enjoyed the other beers I've from Duck Rabbit so far more at this point though."
"Very floral hop aroma, same floral hop flavor well balanced with just the right amount of malt for my taste with a slight caramel flavor. Up there with the best of other brown ales."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with biting carbonation."
"Drinkability: I like this beer a lot, and I think if I have a go-to domestic Brown, this would be it. No new ground is broken, and even though I've never had this hoppy of a Brown before, it's still not overbearing and I think ends up melding the old-school and new-school, if you will, quite well."
"Pours a clear mahagony brown color with a big foamy light tan head that resists fading. A reasonable amount of Belgian lacing left behind. The smell is chalky NECCO chocolate and roasted malt. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied. The taste is nice, but on the edge of being overly roasted. The chocolate notes in the nose are also reflected in the flavor. In my case, the intensity of the lingering roasted character put me off some. Thanks much to brentk56 for the opportunity to try this one."
"M/D - good carbonation and mouthfeel, unique flavor for a brown ale, nice amount of citrus hop flavor"
"A hoppy aggressive American brown, that I say deserves your attention. Not sure I'd session this one all night, but a desert beer or nightcap seem about right."
"No secrets here, per the label ""Hoppy and beautifully bitter"". That may be a nice escape from the typical English style brown ale. Appears a deep chestnut mahogany brown hue with a light khaki head form fine bubbled even layers of lacing as it dwindles. Aroma has a big nutty chocolate tone with caramel and toffee blended in as well, but a strong air of herbal and earthy hops is provided as well. Flavor was raw with hop bitterness earthy herbal hops was right, those nutty dark chocolate tones are overshadowed by the wave of alpha hop bitterness giving the flavor a really dirty muddled flavor overall. Sharp acidity with a back end of sweetness finishes very dry in acidic, carbonation level is soft on the mouthfeel but body is medium with a slight level of oily hops. At this point just brew an IPA if you want to keep it a dark beer go black with your IPA, but compared to Terrapin and DFH's versions of a hoppy brown this one goes a bit overboard. Drinkability is kinda hurtin' due to the lack of cohesion of flavors, abrasive hops within a traditional brown doesn't work to well."
"Fantastic, and is bound to become a mainstay in my fridge."
"A tasty brown that flows easy."
"Drinkability on this one is high as it won't get too sweet and it isn't too hoppy. This beer has complexity but doesn't bash you over the head with it. I would pair this with... well, just about anything."
"Had a bottle at the Liberty St. Tavern in Allentown, PA. It's good to see more Duck-Rabbit beers around. Appeared a clear brown with a short tan head. The beer was very smooth with a mix of candy caramel and cocoa malt flavors mixed into a balanced body. It's not too dry, not too sweet, and not too sweet. Just a good, sessionable brown ale."
"Extremely drinkable, great session ale."
"D - A hop lovers Brown Ale... An interesting take on the style... Solid and respectable..."
"There isn't necessarily anything wrong with this beer, but there would have to be a pretty weak selection for this to be my drink of choice at one of the local bars. For the style and overall I just find it lacking in aroma and taste complexity, but I will give this another try in hope that this bottle was just past its prime."
"Drinking Duck-Rabbit Brown Ale brought to mind burgers and fries drenched in malt vinegar. It would go very nicely with a sloppy cookout meal."
"Overall, not a bad brew, but not one that I would really recommend to many folks. Lacked a certain richness, perhaps"
"I was nervous the date would bring down this beer after smelling it, but the taste was quite good."
"Easy to drink and quite sessionable I would go back for more"
"D- A nicely balanced and slightly bitter brown ale with a low abv. Not my favorite style but this was good for a gander, need to try it on tap to compare."
"I am not in love with this, not bad, nothing wrong with it, for me the flavor is understated."
"As I said, the mouthfeel here is medium bodied and soft. It has a good quenching quality to it and it's juicy. Good carbonation...refined and lazy. I think the beer keeps it interesting enough, though I would never claim this as my favorite American Brown Ale. This is modest in many ways, which is good for some beers, bad for others. Here I will consider it a good thing."
"Pours surprisingly clear brown with a big fluffy head that falls to nice lacing. The aroma is fairly conventional - roasted, with notes of coffee and wood. It is in the flavor where the surprise comes - it is at once thin and mouth-filling, with a deep bitterness that develops slowly on the back of the tongue. The foretaste has chicory, wood, coffee, dark caramel, but then the flavor dies off quickly - at first I was disappointed, thinking the beer was weak and inadequate. But moments later, that rich, spicy bitterness comes up and spreads across the tongue. It tastes like the hop bitterness of a good IPA, but with a slightly harder edge and some of the burn of of an exotically spiced Middle Eastern or Indian dish. The mouthfeel is surprisingly clingy and has a good bite of carbonation."
"This was my first of The Duck-Rabbit brews and being a North Carolinian, I'm proud of this one :) A six-er that will make it to my fridge more often."
"As always, an excellent, above-par beer from Duckrabbit."
"D = Moderately drinkable but not something I would seek out."
"Best of both worlds in this one...dark beer with an excellent hop presence"
"D - Above average beer and very sessionable, but not a very complex beer. Would certainly drink again but wouldn't be a brown I would make a point to go out and find."
"Drinkability: This was a way bitter brown..Most likely the most bitter I have had. A little too hoppy for my liking, this is my least favorite of what I had from Duck Rabbit. I will not search for this again."
"I prefer my brown ales less hoppy - the dry hop quality and the toast, almost roasty presence seem to emphasize each other in a way that makes both a bit more dry and unpleasant."
"Overall this is a hoppy brown that's tasty, though I wish the malts had more of a presence."
"After the dubious start, this becomes a very assertive brew. I want a little more malt in the finish, but this has a nice roasted aspect to the bitterness that off-sets the hops and adds to my enjoyment."
"On-tap during my first visit to Foundation. Served in a tall skinny pint glass a nice crisp brown with a thin diminishing head that left slight lacing on the glass. Aroma was a nice blend of citrus hops with a touch of pine and nice sweet malts backing it up. The taste was a nice balance of citrus hops and caramel malts. The beer was light and refreshing with smooth carbonation. This had long been my favorite year round Duck Rabbit beer and it certainly does not disappoint on draft."
"Body is medium, carbonation is appropriate. Finish is pretty dry. Quite tasty, and another quality offering from The Duck-Rabbit."
"The taste leaves a little nutty flavor that is nice. Not very drinkable, but good."
"M/D - Thin bodied, verging on watery. Just not quite there. Easy drinking though, just wish there was a little more body behind it."
"This taste real good. Nice caramel malts there's something else almost vanilla or some oakiness to it, and then there's a nice bright hoppy finish. Nice complexity for such a low abv. If you're looking for alot of flavor and not much alcohol you this is your beer. Nice carbonation and very drinkable. This is an awesome session brew."
"Okay, now that we are getting DR in Knoxville now, and have met a few of the staff from DR here and at Sexual Choc. release, this continues to be my beer of choice for a premium beer but not high grav. I love this brown ale! Just right amount of hop, smoothness of a brown ale and very drinkable. Like someone said in a previous review, monster head so pour carefully."
"I hope this beer lasts longer than the outdoor rabbits in the cage of my chinese neighbor. More are missing every month."
"D-Save the mouthfeel this brew is quite unique due to the healthy hop dose. A nice hybrid beer with the malty characteristics in a brown you would expect with a kick of hops to make it ""American"". A pleasant, easy drinking and flavourful brew."
"D: Very drinkable. This goes down very well. I really look forward to trying theie other offerings."
"D: This is a decent example of a brown ale. It's pretty well made and easy to drink."
"Very tasty and unique brown. If they would only lower the carbonation a bit, this would be a beer I'd go to often."
"F/P: Flavor is initially sharp & bitter followed by a malty mid palate featuring toasty & bready notes with a definite roasted flavor. Citrus hops come in to wash out the malt and it finishes bitter and somewhat astringent/minerally. Medium body and ample carbonation. Overall it's somewhat perplexing as the different flavors seem to step on each other and the finish becomes unpleasant at times."
"D: Fairly drinkable, I'd love to try this fresh."
"D - Drinkability is good. Stays smooth and goes down quite easy. This one could really shine if not for the excessive carbonation. Not sure if this is really what the brew is supposed to be like. I wouldn't mind getting another one of these just to test out my carbonation theory. If I am right, then this one would be worth the effort to track down again."
"This one pours a dark chestnut brown, and the foamy tan head that accompanies the pour hangs around for the entire life of the beverage. Smells of dark ripe fruit, coffee, nuts, and alcohol are certainly discernible, but the strong presence of dark malts is not to be ignored! The flavor is dominated by espresso and bittersweet chocolate; the bitter hops at the finish is strong, and easily reminds one of the many Indian Brown Ales so much in vogue these days. It's a bit dry for the creamy brown ales I'm familiar with, but that's not a mark against it. My only complaint is the high carbonation; just a little too much fizz for my taste."
"This was my least favorite offering from Duck Rabbit as I have been very pleased with the rest of their brews. I'm not sure what the deal was with the foam, but I don't think she spoiled. Was ok beer, but I have had far better Browns..."
"Overall, a nice beer."
"A nice little brown ale that was quite tasty and I would certainly purchase this beer more often if it were near me."
"The mouthfeel is a little too carbonated, it gets better once you work out some of that carbonation via swirling. Overall a pretty good brown ale although I prefer less of a roasty presence, or none at all in a brown ale."
"Pours the dark, dark brown with the typical, massive DR head that almost comes out of the glass. Retention and lacing are very good. The aroma is an interesting balance between the citrus hops and the sweet caramel malts. The taste has the same caramel malts but with more noticeable chocolate and nut tastes to go along with it. The citrus hops show up and give the finish a little bit of bitterness. The mouthfeel is creamy and, of course, highly carbonated. This is a decent brew from DR and I do like the hop presence that balances out the malts well. Recommended."
"Overall: Very interesting. It's more hoppy than your average brown ale, but not to the point of being too hopped up. If you like brown ales and/or IPA's, you'll like this."
"I think that this beer is better served cold. And the smell is better than the taste."
"Served in a pint glass. It's dark but clear, with a thin off-white head. Nose is gentle malts. Taste is malts, slight alcohol, and some dry fruits. Mouthfeel is very good, full and nice. Drinkability is great. Nice simple brew."
"Pours a light molasses with a big bubble three finger khaki colored head that slowly dies down to a thin frothy layer. Solid lacing left on the sides of the glass. Smell begins with a full nutty aroma with some brown sugar. Light floral hops and a bit of caramel malt tingle the nose as well. There's also the slightest bit of a metallic smell which I'm not too fond of, fortunately it's not strong enough to overpower the other excellent aromas. Taste starts off with sweet caramelized almonds and and toasted malts. Midway is some earthy and piney hops with some cane sugar. Aftertaste is woody and a bit dry. Medium body with a creamy feel. Carbonation is a bit of a distraction seeing it's slightly over the top, but this is still a very well crafted brown ale. The low abv and full flavor makes this a very enjoyable session beer. Thanks again Grant!"
"For some reason I didn't write down who I got this from. Thanks to whoever it was! Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Dark amber color, with a small head that sticks around. Aroma of nuts, some caramel, and a little chocolate. Tastes like roasted malts, a little caramel and some hops. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy and well carbonated. I know brown ales are generally supposed be simple and I like that about them. But this one definitely leaves me wanting more complexity. Bummer."
"Lightly sticky in the mouth, coating, lingering."
"It pours a nice dark brown, barely transparent, with a fairly persistent off-white head. Aroma is rich and rather malty with some hop undertone and hints of spice. Flavor is surprisingly hoppy and fairly but not unpleasantly bitter; there is some maltiness and a touch of spice. Texture is fairly smooth."
"D - Very impressive take on the style. Bottle described it as ""hoppy and beautifully bitter."" I agree whole heartedly on this one. But not sure how many I could have ain a sitting. Will search it out again sometime."
"D-Pretty darn good."
"I was able to try this during a tasting with some friends. Duck-Rabbit has an interesting logo. I saw the duck first so does that make me a creative person? D-R calls itself ""the dark beer specialists"" and they call the Brown Ale ""hoppy and beautifully bitter."" A dark brown body with a thin tan head. Good carbonation with a little bit of a fruity, nutty aroma. Is it apricot? The hoppiness and bitterness are definitely there."
"I usually pour strong but be careful with this one as that style pour equaled an over four finger biscuit like rocky tan head that actually jumps out of the glass. Body is the blackest of browns, showing only brown hints on the edges. Nose is musky with a crisp mineraly spice profile that leans twords peppery and a bit of dark fruit. Brashly attacks the tongue with first sip with crisp backed green apples and strong raw biscuity spice mingled with a bitter sour feel. A long dark burnt malty feel stays long on the back of the tongue. The raw mineral laced bitter bite almost has a nutty feel. A solid brown ale that does not have any frilly sweetness that seems like it was added just for sweetness sake. Nicely drinkable and unique."
"This is a delicious and expectation-bending brown ale. It poured with a big off-white head and a deep brown body. The smell was an intoxicating mix of rich malt and strong hops. The taste was a rich and complex mix of mild caramel malt, strong and complex American and European hop flavor and a hint of roasted malt on the finish. Saaz finishing hops in a Brown Ale? Brilliant!"
"Probably one of the better Brown Ales I've had and my introduction to this brewery. I'm looking forward to trying the rest now."
"This is very well done and quite drinkable."
"I seriously enjoyed this beer. It is easy to drink and one that has a low enough ABV to drink all night. A good everyday beer."
"D - Not bad in the flavor department, but I think this beer is a bit over-carbonated and thin. However, I like how the hops and malts interact here, resulting in quite a bitter brown ale with a nice, complex taste and aroma."
"It pours a dark amber/brown with a huge, foamy head. It demonstrates a full hoppy flavor, coming from Amarillo and Saaz hops. It had a fabulous aroma and equally pleasing flavor; not an English Brown, but a hopped-up American brown. First wort hopping raises the IBU's without creating an overpowering hop aroma or bitterness, resulting in a more balanced beer."
"Came across this ale while in Corolla, NC on vacation. As a huge fan of brown ales and generally darker beers, I felt I should give it a try. Out of a bottle, the ale reeked of strong, dark malts. Upon tasting, the flavor, in terms of sheer strength and persistence, nearly knocked me out of my preverbial socks. The dark chocolate and nutmeg malts are ever-lingering and almost hard to notice anything over. The other characteristics of the beer I feel are masked by the absolutely intense malt flavor. Hopping is decent, but not marked when compared to malt flavor side by side. Carbonation is decent, but somewhat high for what I like to see in an ale of this type. Drinkability is slightly below par to me. I would not want to have more than one at any given sitting. Nothing stuck out to me about this beer past its over-pronounced maltiness and unrefined hoppiness. I would probably not purchase again. That being said, if you are looking for a huge bomb of a dark ale, this just might be for you. C+."
"D - quite good. I haven't had anything I haven't liked by this brewery yet (this is 7/8 beers they make that I've tried now, haver the 8th sitting in the fridge) and this certainly does a nice job continuing the trend. Not too heavy and pretty drinkable as a whole. Goes down nicely. Quite like it!"
"Overall- Very surprised. Not so much with the brewery because they are very consistant with their brews, just that I am not too fond of the style. However, I found this beer VERY enjoyable. Great job, guys!"
"Pours out a rusted nut shell with a moderate sized, frothy head that leaves tons of thick, raised lacing. What hits the nose first is a very fresh and raw hop aroma, courtesy of saaz dry-hopping. Underneath this is a backbone of malty aromas of brown sugar, chocolate, and a hint of maple. Flavor starts off with a sweet mix of nuts and caramel with a back note of roast malt. The hops kick in with some lemon rind and a very herbal/tea-like presence with some floral jasmine rounding it out. Finishes dry, bitter, and with a lingering hop presence in the mouth. I'm so used to coming across overly sweet brown ales made in the US, that this is one incredibly refreshing example. Mouthfeel is moderate, without any real residual sugar left on the tongue. The carbonation compliments the hops very well. Very drinkable. A surprise of a brown ale, for sure."
"The overall impression is that this is a pretty good beer. It's satisfying, but not too filling. I personally like the hoppy taste, which is a little bit more than most of the brown ales that I have had the opportunity to sample thus far. All said, not bad."
"D: A different take on a brown ale than I'm used to, pretty much what the bottle advertised. I ended up enjoying the look and smell of this beer more than the actual taste. I like the finish and aftertaste but the beer itself is too bitter, carbonated and thin for me and ends up tasting like a soda."
"Recommended. A nice brown ale that is unique enough to keep interesting."
"Body is a little light but the rich flavor and smooth drinkability make this more interesting then your average brown."
"Drinkability- It was alright but if you think it is going to be like Newcastle guess again ."
"Very drinkable, interesting take on the style. Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for sending this one in my direction."
"A nice, long, almost warming finsih made this a perfect drink for a cool fall night."
"Drinkability - I didn't enjoy this one very much, mostly due to the brashness of the hops. My palate adjusted some, but not enough."
"Enjoyed all the duck-rabbits, look forward to getting all the reviews in after a couple more of each. Looking forward to having them get these up the east coast."
"This is hands down the best brown ale I've ever had. Brown ales are usually so boring that they're afterthoughts, but this is one that I would drink again and again if I could get my hands on it regularly. Awesome brew. Thanks again Kevin!"
"D: This would make for a good session ale. I'm not a huge brown ale fan, so I probably wouldn't go back to it, but it's a decent example of the style."
"D: The taste is big but the alcohol isn't. That being said, I can see more than a bottle or two being too much on the tastebuds."
"Well... 5 minutes later and i finnally have it all in my glass. First smell gives me a somewhat boozy impression. This is replaced with a sweet malty note and some nutty undertones. I still can't get through the head to get a taste of this thing. Finnally I get a sip that isn't all foam and it's not bad. Again some nutty undertones with a big malt base. Strong nutty aftertaste. Carbonation level is high. Not a bad tasting beer, but who wants to wait 10 minutes to be able get though the foam and taste it. OK but not worth the trouble."
"Clear brown color with a strong pillowy off-white head. Smell is roasty with hints of caramel and plenty of earthy hop aroma. Taste is earthy in the beginning but gains a nice nuttiness in the middle. Lingering nuttiness and roast in the finish that is quite nice. High carbonation with a medium body. Pretty nice beer, but there are just a few things that take away from what it could be. The lingering aftertaste is awesome, but it isn't that great for me when it hits the tongue, and the mouthfeel wasn't quite on for me. Worth a try, you may love it."
"Pours a dark brown color, lots and lots of carbonation, huge four finger plus tannish foamy head, lots and lots of sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, slight toffee/chocolate/, and caramel. The taste is malty, slightly bitter, with some toffee/chocolate/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brown ale from DR, recommended."
"Bottle courtesy of Turdfurgeson: Poured a clear deep brown color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention. Aroma of deep caramel malt with some light molasses. Taste is also dominated by some sweet caramel malt as well as molasses with some light toffee notes. I also found it to be quite hoppy for the style but it still made enjoyable. Body is quite full with some good carbonation. Pretty good overall if maybe a tad too sweet for my liking."
"Mouthfeel is bitter, yeasty, medium bodied, with roasty, and nutty grains lingering along the palate."
"D: Not exactly what I'd reach for if looking for a brown ale. There was nothing timid about this, which presented a problem. With all those flavor characteristics coming together, pushed forth by a surge of bubbles, it seems to miss the mark for any brown ale, American or otherwise. Balance seemed too far out. Yet oddly, I feel like waiting a year or so and trying this one again, just to see if I taste it differently."
"Light bodied,slightly grainy texture,with a mouthwatering dryness. Very refreshing. The best brown i've had to date one to compair other to. Wish this beer was avalible locally. Pick this one up if your're lucky enough to run across it. Hell, send me some too."
"D: Very drinkable beer, just not very pourable!! good flavor, good smell but they need to tone the carbonation back a bit. Thanks to limesmut for this beer via trade!"
"Drank good, but too much coffee, would've made more sense a mocha porter IMO. If you love coffee flavors in your beer, this your brown ale of choice"
"Didn't know style when I tried it, but was pretty sure it wasn't an English Brown Ale - way too hoppy. I am having trouble getting past the carbonation and the hops. Both could be toned down to allow other aspects of the beer to shine through."
"Ruby-red and brown at the same time. Head is very healthy fluffy 2 inch foamy tan. I smell rubber at first and then malts. The smell is not bad by any means, in fact it is quite good. It tastes like roasted malts and is hoppy. Bitterneness on the label is accurate but not what I would expect. Nice stuff."
"Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for sending this my way. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my standard shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a deep translucent brown color with about a finger of quickly fading head that settles to about a quarter inch. Smells of roasted sweet caramel malts, followed by a hit of hops and a touch of alcohol. Tastes of sweet caramel with citrus notes followed by a bitter roasted grain flavor and a slight alcohol burn (at 5.6% ?). Carbonation is completely overdone on this one. Very bubbly, so much so that I find it hard to think about anything else while drinking it. Got this one in a trade and I'm far from sad that i wasn't sent a pair of these."
"Notes: From NoNameBIF, courtesy of mikesgroove."
"Taste is full of big coffee and chocolate notes, with some nutty malts as well. Mouthfeel is smooth, refreshing, and well carbonated, and a noticable bitter chocolate finish caps this baby off. In the end, it's surprisingly drinkable for a DuckRabbit. Not too thick, and not too shabby. Quite a brew here, perhaps DR's best in my opinion."
"Pours a gorgeous deep ruby-brown with a thick, fluffy head that leaves billowy lacing. First smell is burnt malt followed by a slighty sweet, citrusy note. This is a unique aroma for me. The taste is bitter - both from the roasted malt (a coffelike bitter) and the hops (citrus?). There is little sweetness, and that makes this seems very unbalanced to me, but I find it quite tasty nonetheless and very drinkable as well."
"D - Didn't realize the ABV until after I finished...a very drinkable brown, but a little higher wouldn't hurt."
"D: Actually, after a couple of these, I would be full. But it tastes great. Kudos to the brewer. This is a keeper."
"Initial pour  wow by far the foamiest commercial beer Ive ever seen. Wait, wait for it to subside enough to taste.meanwhile, nice aroma. Malty and fresh hops are quite noticeable. Still plenty of head, but lacing looks weird. The taste is malty and a bit bitter. It has a roasted type flavor. The mouthfeel is very full, but not too heavy. This is quite a delicious number that goes down smooth with lots of flavor  very drinkable."
"D- It is pretty good. One of the best brown ales I have had."
"Thanks to oldirtysurfer for the sample. Best before March 2007. Clear light mahogany/russet with persistent, driving carbonation and a massive creamy pale tan head of froth. Spicy floral hop aromas, with satsuma blossom and grapefruit predominating. Very intriguing nose -- all hops. And this is a brown ale! Big, bright, and juicy blood orange and grapefruit notes pop out all over the front of the palate with a slight mineral bite amongst the bready flavors in the middle, becoming earthier near the end. Very unique and experimental, even, for the style. Light body, juicy and crisp mouthfeel. Pairs excellently with mildly spiced Indian cuisine. Recommended."
"Poured a deep rich brown with a huge creamy head and a huge lace down the side, this looks very inticing to say the least! Smell was of roasted nuts with a hint of hops. Caramel sweetness undertones as well, smells thick and very fresh. The taste was very full. Nice roasted tones and caramel was the predominant flavors. Very complex though as there was much hoppiness at both the beginning and the finish. The finish was very nice, very dry and left you looking for more. This was yet another great brew from Duck Rabbit, they are really climbing the charts for off the hook beers here, have not had a bad one yet, and I am chilling my first wee heavy so look for that tomorrow!"
"And, of course, another fine frosty sent by blackie !!"
"This looked like a pretty standard brown ale with a good sized head and clear dark brown color. The nose was a mixture of sweet malts and floral hops. Those floral hops were slightly offputting; I think the late hop additions need to be cut back. The taste moved as I swallowed from typical slightly sweet and bitter brown ale to an attack of flowery hops at the end. It seemed a bit of place, and as the glass warmed up the floral hops became a bit overpowering."
"12oz. bottle poured a dark brownish red color with a large lightly tan head that left lots of lacing on the glass. Has a nice citrusy hop smell. Taste is rich dark roasted malt with a bitter citrus hop flavor that cuts right through at the end. Mouth feel is more like a thick and creamy stout. This is a highly drinkable beer, nice and smooth with rich robust malts and slight tang of bittering hops."
"Pours a dark ruby brown with a good head and nice lacing. Smell is roasty and a little sour. Pretty roasty taste for a brown ale and with a grainy sourness on the finish. Not very malty or sticky, quite dry and refreshing. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and decently carbonated. The roasty sourness bugs me a bit and makes it less drinkable."
"D - If i wasnt in the mood for a murphy's or o'hara's id defintely drink this. Excellent american brown ale, a few of these would be ok with me!"
"I think this could be great if they cut down on the charred maltiness and let the hops balance it out. When you let it sit in the mouth before swallowing, its pretty delicious, but it leaves the tongue feeling scortched. Its worth getting another just in case I got a slightly ""off"" one."
"M/D- Bubbly, crisp, bitter, and mildly heavy....another great beer from a young brewery....one that I have grown to love."
"Thanks for the bottle Mikesgroove."
"D: Tasty, very easy-to-drink, not filling at all, this is definitely a poundable beer."
"I recommend trying if you get a chance!"
"thanks to oldgrowth for this. poured a nice mahogany with a light tan head. aroma honey, hops, citrus, floral, some nuttiness. flavor lots of hops, dry, nutty, spicy, a nice bitterness. this is a little different from other brown ales that I have had . not to bad"
"($7.99 / 6-pack)"
"Malts dominate here, I can recognize the Saaz among them. Tones of caramel and coffee and a dry, complete aftertaste and finish. Complex but compact and very tasty. Not a style I've loved in the past but this is really good. Duck Rabbit rides again."
"We should expect good things from any brewery who specializes in 'dark beer'. There are no exceptions here. Pours a dark, nearly opaque, brown with an abundance of carbonation and retention; laces well. Smells chocolatey and roasty without the bite of rosted grains. Maybe a light fermentation flavor that resembles lactose. Also with a hint of dehydrated fruits and pecans. Very smooth texture, nearly silky. Holds firm into the finish. Hops add a consistent bittering and piney flavor throughout. Tough to find a better Brown."
"I will not seek this one out again."
"No doubt, this is a very enjoyable brew, and even if it doesn't conform to typical brown ale standards, I enjoy Duck Rabbit's willingness to brew in a freer style...and this applies to the rest of their line. Rules are mere guidelines/suggestions...just focus on making (and drinking!) great and unique beer."
"Average beer and drinkability. Good enough to sample, but not my first choice for a brown ale."
"Drinkability: Despite the marathon pour, and the thin mouthfeel, this is a pretty solid beer. Thanks to AKSmokedPOrter for the bottle."
"Pours with a rocky peaked head of duff colored loosely packed medium sized bubbles that steadily settles. Leaves patchy chunks of foam clinging to the glass. Crystal clear mahogany with no visible carbonation streams. The smell is filled with medium roasty notes, light coffee, and a slightly wood smoke and molasses note. There is an initial smoky note, light, but distinct that starts things off. A modest roast malt picks up and leads into the bitter, but complimentary hop bite. Equal parts roast malt and bittering hops, there is a pleasing long roast bitterness in the finish that lingers at the corners. Medium body with plenty of carbonation, it has a round feel to it. This is a solid brown ale that goes down easily."
"The body is good as should be. Carbonation is light as should be. Overall a good beer that could be smoother but still a good taste and well represented on a harsher brown flavor. If your color blind does it matter what color the animal you see is?"
"Ale pours a deep chestnut brown with a lovely white head that sticks around quite a while. Aroma is fairly hoppy with a some malt. Flavor is good roasted chocolate with hops coming through the middle and finish. Good twang of bittnerness on the end without being harsh. Body is substantial, but not cloying. Very satisfying ale, probably the best brown I've had."
"This is a very drinkable beer."
"This is one of the better brown ales I have had. The beer is a deep brown. I don't think I have seen a darker brown ale. The head was about two fingers and is still a nice coating. It smells a little like caramel. The taste is smooth. There is a roasted character in the taste. In the mouthfeel there is a small amount of lingering bitterness. Just right!. The drinkability is very good for the style. One of the best brown ales I have had."
"I would definately have another, very good with hot wings."
"A very nice example of an often-overlooked style. Poured much darker than the average brown ale. Roasted malt flavor rushed to the front, with some bitter cocoa powder and slighty huskyness. A smooth sweetness immediately followed, quickly fading to a rather tart and slightly sour finish, calling to mind the mildest hint of a Oud Bruin. An interesting and well-integrated flavor profile."
"Last swigs: Dry brown like an English porter almost. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the bottle."
"Duck-Rabbit Brown Ale is yet another quality dark beer from ""The Dark Beer Specialists"". These words don't usually leave my fingertips, but it would be even better if the malt load was dialed up and the hop load was dialed down just a tad. If bitter browns are your thing, Duck-Rabbit has what you seek."
"Not my favorite brown ale. I liked the D-R Milk Stout better. I wouldn't buy this again, but I will probably try other D-Rs."
"A very good example of brown ale. Find it if you can you won't be disapointed."
"The label is notched as having a best by date of January 2006."
"My experience with Duck Rabbit Brown Ale was like riding a roller coaster. It pours a beautiful mahogany with an average head. This is definitely an attractive beer. The aroma. . . I'm almost embarrased to say that I could only discern latex paint. I tried and tried. I even opened another bottle later and compared notes. The sniffer was working, but this smelled like it was brewed by Sherwin Williams. Everything else was impressive, including the flavor of dark chocolate malts and a nice hint of smokiness. In spite of odd aroma, this is actually a good beer. It would be great with brie and fruit."
"Poured a very nice shade of brown with a very strong sustaining head. Nose is a noticeable of toasted malts. Taste is interesting, more like a stout than a brown. Toasted malts fade into a nice blasting finish of hops. Mouthfeel is almost creamy and is very lively on the palate. Overall drinkability is very good, another nice beer from this NC brewery."
"Drinkability: Much better than when I first came across this beer back in November '05."
"This beer vexes me...the first one I had was pretty pleasant, but the one I had tonight wasn't anything special; my opinion seemingly changed on every sip. It's worth trying, in any case."
"Frothy, 2-finger ochre head atop a dark brown-ruby clear body. Head retains to a thick, thin layer, with loose suds in light lacing. Looks great. Grass-floral hop aroma with solid bready malt sweetness in the nose. Gentle carbonation in a thin, slightly astringent body, sweet raisin and roasted malt with refreshing balancing citrus, crisp piney bitterness emerging nicely in the finish. Pretty hoppy for the style, but like the label promised. Something in the body and flavor is just a little lacking but the extra hop kick and everything else rounds it out and makes for a good sessionable beer. Will definitely return to this and check out other offerings."
"Overall, a very tasty brown. A little on the hoppy side as the bottle suggests. I've been very pleased with all of the Duck-Rabbit beers, I tried them as soon as they hit the stores earlier this year and have been coming back to them regularly ever since."
"Overall it is decent, but I liked the other beers Ive sampled from this brewery more."
"Holy explosive head! This was an ""Oh Shit!"" on the pour as it foamed up about 5/8 of the glass and threatened to boil over (in my imperial pint glass, no less!). Took F-O-R-E-V-E-R to get the head to die down so I could manage a taste. Pillowy tan lace all over the glass and clumps on the glass. Roasted malt aromas mixed with a metallic scent and a dash of campfire ashes. Flavor has an upfront bitterness to it, followed by a sweeter middle of caramel and chocolate. Maybe some coffee notes as well? Finishes with a long-lasting bitterness. A taste of metal and more ash seeps in. Super-carbonated mouthfeel detracts from the overall experience. Quaffable."
"Drinkability is nice bought for my wife as she likes brown ales she had a couple and switched to a Gaelic Ale which again indicates this isn't true to style but I would be up for more myself."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head above the red-tinged brown brew. Head fades slowly, with excellent lacing. Aroma is hearty darker grains, coupled with some fruit hops essences. Taste is grain husk malt sweetness upfront, moves into a hoppy middle, and then closes with some more pronounced citrusy hops bitterness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent, with creaminess and an all-around ease-of-use. This one was one of those session browns that you sit down with all day."
"Somewhat of a cross between a Brown Ale and a Pale Ale. Rich malts mixed with a large amount of hops and bitterness. A brown ale that pushes the limits on the style scale that is pretty damn drinkable. A change of pace for hopheads if they want one."
"Thanks to blackie for the opportunity to try this unique beer."
"Drinkability: Well I already hinted that it's very drinkable. Very tasty. Not overly complex or harsh. I'd recommend this as my favorite from the DuckRabbit."
"Pours a tawny brown with a nice tight one finger almond colored head,nice aromas of caramel and roasted malts although quite subtle.Somewhat dry from the get go some earthy nuttiness and roasted malt flavors along with a touch off wood I do pick up some nice dry bitterness from a healthy dose of hops for a brown.I have been breaking away from this style and becoming more of a hophead but this suits me fine,nicely crafted and will buy again."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown with a thin white head that dissapates quicklly. Smell is malty sweet molasses aroma with a hint of citrus hops in the background. Taste is almonds with a hint of molasses and brown sugar and a biscuit like malt profile. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth. A very drinkable brown ale, if nothing spectacular."
"12 ounce bottle. Best before 6 05 on label."
"I loved this beer, though it tweaks the guidelines for the style. Poured well with a khaki head, that dwindled. Tremendously roasty nose. Roasty like a stout. Very dark brown in color, but not black. Flavor is malty and roasty with hop bitterness on the back-end, then a slight aftertaste. BJCP says a brown ale should be a light-flavored, malt-accented beer that is readily suited to drinking in quantity. This beer is very flavorful and very well suited to drinking in quantity. I really liked this one. Check it out."
"Drinkability: Good with red meat or BBQ. Not terribly drinkable because the hop flavor is a bit haphazard, especially considering the style."
"12 oz bottle served into an imperial pint glass, pours a clear cherry mahogany body with a small beige head that lasts a few minutes. Minimal patches of lace are left on the glass. Aroma features citrusy hops, chocolate malt, and some hazelnut. Mouthfeel is light medium bodied with more carbonation than expected. Taste has grapefruit and pine cone hops, chocolate malt, and lots of roasted, almost burnt, malt bitterness. Nice touch of nuttiness that tastes like hazelnuts. Finishes with a pine hops bitterness that is fleeting. I would estimate the abv. to be around 5%, but it's not noticed. A nicely executed brown ale that is quite tasty and pleasantly drinkable."
"Drinkability: Clearly an American Brown as there are plenty of hops; nice to have a brown ale with a lot of flavor"
